One killer, multiple victims. The serial killer.As the number of serial killers worldwide has risen steadily – from theemergence of Jack the Ripper in 1888 to Harold Shipman and Ivan Milat, thebackpacker killer of the Australian outback – the need to understand thisdisturbing phenomenon is becoming more urgent. But to understand why serialmurder is on the rise, we must first understand how the serial killer thinks.Using privileged access to the world’s first National Centre for the Analysis ofViolent Crime, Colin Wilson and Donald Seaman bring you this incisive study ofthe psychology of serial killers and the motives behind their crimes.From childhood traumas to issues of frustration, fear and fantasy, discover whatturns an ordinary human being into a compulsive killer."},{"pageContent":"THE SERIAL KILLERSA Study in the Psychology of ViolenceColin Wilson and Donald SeamanLogo Missing [../Images/logo.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"This bookis dedicated toSpecial Supervisory Agent Gregg O.

It is not intended to bea comprehensive history of serial murder – that would require a far longervolume – but an attempt to understand the complex mechanisms that lead to a‘habit of killing’. So although there has been an attempt to offer at least somebrief account of the most notorious serial murderers of the twentieth century,there are many omissions: for example, Adolf Seefeld, Peter Manuel, WilliamMacDonald, Herb Mullin and Randall Woodfield. On the other hand, considerablespace is devoted to some criminals who do not, strictly speaking, qualify asserial killers: notably Hiroko Nagata, Cameron Hooker, and Gary Heidnik. Thereason, which will become clear from the text itself, is that these peopleenable us to understand an important facet of the psychology of the serialkiller. This understanding, which has emerged over the course of the pastdecade, amounts to a minor revolution in the science of criminology. Now it ispossible to state that, with the researchers of the FBI Behavioural ScienceUnit, and of similar groups that are following their example in other countries,we are at last in a position to understand some of the answers to one of themost disturbing riddles of the twentieth century."},{"pageContent":"OneA Short History of Sex CrimeSINCE THE EARLY 1980s, American law enforcement agencies have become aware ofthe emergence of an alarming new phenomenon, the serial killer.This recognition came about, it seems, through analysis of the steep rise in sexcrime and ‘motiveless murder’. Ever since the 1960s, ‘multiple murder’ had beenon the increase. The ‘Manson Family’ had killed at least nine people. VaughnGreenwood, the ‘Skidrow Slasher’ of Los Angeles, killed nine homeless vagrants.Necrophile Ed Kemper killed ten, including his grandparents and mother. Paranoidschizophrenic Herb Mullin killed thirteen. Dean Corll, the homosexual murdererof Houston, Texas, killed twenty-seven boys. John Wayne Gacy of Chicago admittedto killing thirty-two boys. Patrick Kearney, the ‘Trash Bag Murderer’ of LosAngeles, killed twenty-eight men. William Bonin, the ‘Freeway Killer’, killed aminimum of twenty-two young men. The ‘Hillside Stranglers’, Kenneth Bianchi andAngelo Buono, raped and killed a dozen girls. Ted Bundy killed twenty-three.Randall Woodfield, the ‘I.5 Killer’, murdered forty-four. The South American sexkiller Pedro Lopez, ‘the Monster of the Andes’, admitted to killing threehundred and sixty pre-pubescent girls. In 1983, a derelict named Henry Lee Lucasmade headlines in America when he also confessed to killing three hundred andsixty people, mostly women.All this raised a disturbing possibility: that perhaps a fairly small number ofkillers were responsible for the rise in sex crime and motiveless murder.(‘Motiveless murders’ had risen from 8.5% in 1976 to 22.1% in 1984.) America isa large country, and many killers roam from state to state, moving on beforepolice have a chance to catch up with them. Twenty-two-year-old Steven Judy, whomurdered a mother and her three children in 1979, admitted before his executionthat he had ‘left a string’ of murdered women across America. The family ofSherman McCrary – three men and two women – travelled from Texas to California,robbing drug stores and restaurants, and also abducting waitresses and shopassistants, whose violated bodies were left in lonely places. For this kind ofkiller, murder becomes a habit and an addiction. Henry Lee Lucas told police: ‘Iwas bitter at the world . . . Killing someone is just like walking outdoors.’ Italso became clear that such killers murder out of some fierce inner compulsion,and that after the crime, experience a sense of relief and a ‘cooling-offperiod’. Then, like the craving for a drug, the compulsion builds up again,until it is time to go in search of another victim. It was this type of murdererfor whom the police coined the term ‘serial killer’. One police officersuggested that there could be as many as thirty-five serial killers at large inAmerica, and that the number could be increasing at the rate of one a month.More recent estimates have been as high as five hundred.What has caused this epidemic of mass murder? One thing at least is clear: thatit is part of a pattern that has emerged since the Second World War. In order tounderstand it, we need to go much further back to the beginning of the ‘age ofthe sex crime’.The emerging pattern first became clear (to Colin Wilson) in the late 1950s whenhe was engaged in compiling An Encyclopedia of Murder with Patricia Pitman: ‘Thepurpose was to try to provide a standard work that would include all the“classic” murders of the past few centuries and serve as a reference book forcrime writers and policemen. Pat Pitman chose to deal with domestic murders andpoisoning cases, while I wrote about mass murderers like Landru, Haigh andChristie.‘I was soon struck by an interesting recognition: that sex crime was not, as Ihad always supposed, as old as history, but was a fairly recent phenomenon. Itwas true that soldiers had always committed rape in wartime, and that sadistslike Tiberius, Ivan the Terrible, Vlad the Impaler and Gilles de Rais certainlyqualify as sex criminals; but in our modern sense of the word – that is, a manwho commits rape because his sexual desires tend to run out of control – sexmurder makes its first unambiguous appearance in the late nineteenth century.The Jack the Ripper murders of 1888 and the murders of the French“disemboweller” Joseph Vacher in the 1890s are among the first recordedexamples. Some of the most famous sex crimes of the century occurred after theFirst World War: these included the murders of the “Düsseldorf Vampire” PeterKürten, of America’s “Gorilla Murderer” Earle Nelson, of the child killer AlbertFish, and the extraordinary crimes of the Hungarian Sylvestre Matushka, whoexperienced orgasm as he blew up trains.‘Were there no sex killers before the late nineteenth century? As far as I havebeen able to determine, the answer is no. At first I was inclined to believethat a French peasant named Martin Dumollard was an exception. In the 1850s helured a number of servant girls seeking work into lonely places, then murderedthem and buried the bodies; but the records reveal that his motive was to stealtheir belongings, and there is no evidence of sexual assault. For mostworking-class people of the period – and this included the “criminal class” –life was hard, and when they committed murder, it was for money, not sex.’What then caused the ‘age of the sex crime’? One reason was certainly thenineteenth-century attitude to sex, the kind of prudery that made Victorianhousewives conceal table legs with a long tablecloth in case the mere thought oflegs caused young ladies to blush. In earlier centuries, sex was treated withhealthy frankness. As soon as the Victorians started to regard it as a shamefulsecret, it began to exercise the fascination of the forbidden. The rise ofpornography dates from the 1820s; there were indecent books before that, buttheir purpose was to satirise the clergy, and they were usually about priestsseducing nuns and penitents. Then, in the 1820s, there emerged books with titleslike The Lustful Turk and The Ladies’ Telltale, about virgins being kidnappedand raped by Mediterranean pirates and little girls being seduced by the butler.If we wish to trace it to its beginnings, it could be argued that the age of thesex crime begins in the year 1791, with the publication of a novel calledJustine, or The Misfortunes of Virtue, by Alphonse Donatien de Sade. The Marquisde Sade is the patron saint of pornography and sex crime. Contrary to thegeneral impression, Sade never killed anyone; his most reprehensible exploit wasmaking small cuts in a prostitute’s skin and pouring hot wax into them. For anumber of similar misdemeanours, he was thrown into prison at the age ofthirty-seven, and stayed there for thirteen years, until the time of the FrenchRevolution. For a man of Sade’s imperious temperament, prison must have beenunimaginable torment. For three years he was plunged into transports of despairand self-pity. Then he began to recover and to direct his hatred and resentmentinto literary channels. Resentment mingled with frustrated eroticism to produceworks of almost insane cruelty. His favourite fantasy was of some virtuous,innocent girl who falls into the hands of a wicked libertine and is flogged,raped and tortured. His most characteristic work is a huge novel called The 120Days of Sodom, a long sexual daydream about four libertines – including a bishopand a Lord Chief Justice – who retire to a château and set out to indulge everypossible kind of sexual perversion. Brothel madames tell stories about theirmost debauched clients, stimulating the libertines to rape, flog and torture asmall band of young men and women who have been procured for their pleasure.Yet, oddly enough, Sade is never pornographic in the modern sense of the word;there are no gloating descriptions of sexual acts. His real desire is to screamdefiance at the Church and State; he loves to show judges abusing theirauthority, and monks and nuns engaged in debauchery and corrupting children. Hisdescriptions of torture are anything but sexually stimulating; even devotees ofpornography find them repetitive and nauseating.Sade was far more than a mere advocate of torture and murder; he regardedhimself as the first truly honest philosopher in the history of human thought.The so-called ‘great philosophers’ he regarded as liars and lackeys. Allanimals, he says, seek pleasure as the greatest good; the body was obviouslymade for pleasure, expecially sexual pleasure. Then why do we not spend ourlives seeking pleasure? Because it would not suit our rulers. They try topersuade us that unselfishness, hard work and self-sacrifice are virtues, andthat there is a God in heaven who will judge us for our misdeeds. This isuntrue; there is no God, and if we were not such slaves, we would throw off ourshackles and devote our lives to the pursuit of ecstasy. Would this not lead usinto doing harm to others? Of course it would, says Sade. Why not? Animalsdevour one another; that is the law of Nature. The only truly honest attitude tohuman existence is one of total selfishness. The truly courageous man choosescrime rather than virtue, for he knows that virtue was invented by our rulers tokeep us in subjugation. Kings and popes know better; they spend their lives inevery kind of debauchery . . .Sade was released from prison in 1789, and for a time scraped a living as aplaywright. (He was never, even in his youth, a rich man, and the fierceunderlying resentment of his works owes a great deal to poverty.) Then he wasarrested again for publishing filthy books, and spent the rest of his life in anasylum, where he died in 1816. His works began to enjoy a certain vogue inEngland, and his obsession with ‘the forbidden’ gave rise to the first trulypornographic novels of the 1820s: works whose purpose was not to denounce theChurch and the legal profession, but merely to serve as an aid to masturbation –what one French writer called ‘books that one reads with one hand’. It issignificant that many of these early pornographic works are about the seductionof children and schoolgirls. In the Victorian age, prostitutes were cheap; infact, few working-class girls would have turned down the offer of five shillings– a week’s wages – in exchange for half an hour in a rented room. In thecircumstances, rape of adult women would have been superfluous; this is why mostsex crimes were committed against children – children were still ‘forbidden’.There was one Victorian gentleman who devoted his whole life to the pursuit ofsexual pleasure, and whose career may be regarded as highly instructive in thepresent context. In his anonymous autobiography, My Secret Life, he simply callshimself Walter, and his identity remains a mystery. He describes how his sexualeducation began at the age of twelve, when he lifted his baby sister’snightdress. In his mid-teens he succeeded in pushing a servant girl on the bedand taking her virginity. From then on, Walter devoted his life to sex. He spenthours of every day peering through cracks in bedroom doors, watching servantgirls undress or using the chamberpot. With his cousin Fred he spent days in abasement which had a grating through which he could peer up the skirts of womenwho walked overhead.What emerges most clearly from his eleven-volume autobiography – published athis own expense in the 1890s – is that his craving for sex was not a desire togive and receive mutual satisfaction, but an expression of the will to power. Inthe second volume he describes picking up a middle-aged woman and a ten-year-oldgirl in Vauxhall Gardens, and having intercourse with the child, standing infront of a mirror, ‘holding her like a baby, her hands round my neck, shewhining that I was hurting her . . .’ He adds: ‘I longed to hurt her, to makeher cry with the pain my tool caused her, I would have made her bleed if Icould.’ The same attitude emerges again and again in his descriptions ofintercourse: ‘In the next instant . . . I was up the howling little bitch.’ ‘Hercry of pain gave me pleasure, and fetched me.’My Secret Life affords an important insight into the mind of the Marquis deSade. The normal reader finds it difficult to understand how sexualgratification can be associated with pain and violence: with the gouging out ofeyes or the mutilation of genitals. ‘Walter’ was no sadist, yet his craving forwomen was basically a desire to violate them. Sade had always enjoyed floggingand being flogged. Incarcerated in a damp cell, with only his imagination tokeep him company, the daydreams of flogging and violation turned into daydreamsof murder, torture and mutilation. The human imagination has this curious powerto amplify our desires. Yet it is important to note that, even when releasedfrom prison, de Sade made no attempt to put these fantasies into practice. Hehad already exhausted them by writing them down. In the same way, ‘Walter’s’sadism never developed beyond a desire to cause pain in the act of penetration,because he had an endless supply of women with whom he could act out hisfantasies. The essence of sadism lies in frustration. As William Blake put it:‘He who desires but acts not breeds a pestilence.’Most of ‘Walter’s’ early encounters with teenage whores took place in the 1840s,when the streets were full of starving women and children for whom fiveshillings meant the difference between life and death. By the 1880s all this hadbegun to change. The Public Health Act and the Artisans’ Dwellings Act of 1875had made an attempt to grapple with disease and poverty. When H.G. Wells came toLondon as a student in 1884, his cousin Isobel – whom he later married – workedas a retoucher of photographs in Regent Street, and many of his fellow studentswere women. The typewriter had been invented in the 1860s, and businessmen soondiscovered that women made better typists than men. Drapers’ shops were now fullof women counter assistants. All of which meant that – although there were stillplenty of prostitutes on the streets – there was now a whole new class of‘unavailable’ women to excite the concupiscence of men like ‘Walter’. The resultwas that, in the last decades of the nineteenth century, rape of adult womenbecame far more common, and sex crime – in our modern sense of the word – madeits appearance. In 1867, a clerk named Frederick Baker lured a little girl namedFanny Adams away from her companions in Alton, Hampshire, and literally tore herto pieces. In 1871, a French butcher named Eusebius Pieydagnelle killed sixyoung women with a knife, experiencing orgasm as he stabbed them. (He has aclaim to be the first serial killer.) In Italy in the same year, Vincent Verzeniwas charged with a number of sex crimes including two murders – he experiencedorgasm in the act of strangulation. In Boston, USA, in 1873, a bell-ringer namedThomas Piper murdered and raped three women, then lured a five-year-old girlinto the belfry and battered her to death with a cricket bat; he was interruptedbefore the assault could be completed, and hanged in 1876. In 1874, afourteen-year-old sadist named Jesse Pomeroy was charged with the sex murders ofa boy and a girl in Boston and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1880,twenty-year-old Louis Menesclou lured a five-year-old girl into his room inParis and killed her, keeping the body under his mattress overnight; when hetried to burn her entrails he was betrayed by the black smoke. He wrote in hisnotebook: ‘I saw her, I took her.’Crimes like these were regarded as the solitary aberrations of madmen, andscarcely came to the attention of the general public. The crimes of an Americanmass murderer named Herman Webster Mudgett, alias Henry Howard Holmes, should benoted as an exception. Holmes began as a confidence trickster, and in the late1880s he built himself a large house in a Chicago suburb that would become knownas ‘Murder Castle’. When Holmes was arrested in 1894 for involvement in aswindle, police soon came to suspect that he was responsible for the murder ofan associate named Pitezel, and three of Pitezel’s children. Furtherinvestigation revealed that Holmes had murdered a number of ex-mistresses, aswell as women who had declined to become his mistress. Moreover, as Holmeshimself confessed, killing had finally become an addiction which, he believed,had turned him into a monster. The total number of his murders is believed to betwenty-seven, and they qualify him as America’s first serial killer. He washanged in 1896.It was the crimes of Jack the Ripper though – which will be further discussed inthe next chapter – that achieved worldwide notoriety and made the police awarethat they were confronted by a new type of problem: a killer who struck atrandom. The murders took place in the Whitechapel area of London between 31August 1888 and 9 November 1888. The first victim, a prostitute named Mary AnnNicholls, was found in the early hours of the morning with her throat cut; inthe mortuary, it was discovered that she had also been disembowelled. The nextvictim, another prostitute named Annie Chapman, was found spreadeagled in thebackyard of a slum dwelling, also disembowelled; the contents of her pockets hadbeen laid around her in a curiously ritualistic manner – a characteristic thathas been found to be typical of many ‘serial killers’. The two murders producednationwide shock and outrage – nothing of the sort had been known before – andthis was increased when, on the morning of 30 September 1888, the killercommitted two murders in one night. A letter signed ‘Jack the Ripper’, boastingof the ‘double event’, was sent to the Central News Agency within hours of themurders. When the biggest police operation in London’s history failed to catchthe murderer, there was unprecedented public hysteria. As if in response to thesensation he was causing, the Ripper’s next murder was the most gruesome so far.A twenty-four-year-old prostitute named Mary Jeanette Kelly was killed anddisembowelled in her room; the mutilations that followed must have taken severalhours. Then the murders ceased – the most widely held theories being that thekiller had committed suicide or was confined in a mental home. From the point ofview of the general public, the most alarming thing about the murders was thatthe killer seemed to be able to strike with impunity, and that the police seemedto be completely helpless.The French police found themselves confronting the same frustrations in themid-1890s when a travelling killer who became known as ‘the Disemboweller of thesouth-east’ raped and mutilated eleven victims, including three boys. (It isinteresting to observe that many sex criminals have been tramps or wanderingjourneymen; it is as if the lack of domestic security produced an exaggeratedand unnatural form of the sex needs.) He was finally caught – after three years– when he attacked a powerfully-built peasant woman, whose husband and childrenheard her screams. He proved to be twenty-eight-year-old Joseph Vacher, anex-soldier who had spent some time in an asylum after attempting suicide. Thelesson of the case was that Vacher had been able to kill with impunity for threeyears, although his description – a tramp with a suppurating right eye andparalysed cheek – had been circulated to every policeman in south-east France.The failure was doubly humiliating because France was now celebrated throughoutthe civilised world as the home of scientific crime detection. As early as 1814,the great doctor Mathieu Orfila had written the first treatise on poisons,revealing how they could be detected in the body; but for many years, otherbranches of crime detection had remained crude and inefficient. Throughout thenineteenth century, police had been pursuing more or less hit-or-miss methods ofdetecting criminals, relying on informers and policemen who knew the underworld.The chief virtue of a detective was simply immense patience – the ability, forexample, to look through half the hotel registers in Paris in search of the nameof a wanted man. All that changed in 1883 when a young clerk named AlphonseBertillon invented a new method of identifying criminals by taking a wholeseries of measurements – of their heads, arms, legs, etc. These were thenclassified under the head measurements, and it became possible for the police tocheck within minutes whether a man arrested for some minor offence was a wantedmurderer or footpad. ‘Bertillonage’ was soon in use in every major city in theworld. The science of identification also achieved a new precision. In 1889, adoctor named Alexandre Lacassagne solved a particularly baffling murder when heidentified an unknown corpse by removing all the flesh from the bones andrevealing that the man had suffered from a tubercular infection of the right legwhich had deformed his knee. Once the corpse had been identified, it wasrelatively simple to trace the murderers, a couple named Michel Eyraud andGabrielle Bompard.The next great advance occurred in England, where Sir Francis Galton realisedthat no two persons have the same fingerprints. The first case to be solved by afingerprint occurred in a small town in Argentina in 1892; a young mother namedFrancisca Rojas had murdered her two children and tried to put the blame on apeasant called Velasquez; an intelligent police chief named Alvarez observed abloody fingerprint on the door, and established that it belonged to Francisca;she then confessed that she had been hoping to persuade a young lover to marryher, but that her ‘illegitimate brats’ stood in the way . . . Whenfingerprinting was introduced at Scotland Yard in 1902, it was so successfulthat Bertillon’s more complicated system was quickly abandoned. All over theworld, ‘bertillonage’ was quickly replaced by the new fingerprint system.1[../Text/chapter_001.xhtml#ft001]It was at this point, when science seemed to be transforming the craft of themanhunter, that killers like Jack the Ripper and Joseph Vacher made a mockery ofall attempts to catch them. A well-known cartoon published at the time of theRipper murders showed policemen blundering around with blindfolds over theireyes. Scientific crime detection depended on finding some link between the crimeand the criminal. If a rich old dowager was poisoned, compiling a list ofsuspects was easy; the police merely had to find out who would benefit in herwill, and which of these had access to poison. But the sex killer struck atrandom and, unless he left some clue behind, there was nothing to link him tothe victim.One important advance offered hope of a partial solution. In 1901, a youngViennese doctor, Paul Uhlenhuth, discovered a method for testing whether abloodstain was animal or human. Blood is made up of red cells and a colourlessliquid called serum. Uhlenhuth discovered that if a rabbit is injected withchicken blood, its serum develops a ‘resistance’ to chicken blood. And if a dropof chicken blood is then dropped into a test tube containing serum from therabbit, the serum turns cloudy. It was obvious that the same method could beused to detect human blood, for when an animal is injected with human blood, itsserum will then turn cloudy if a drop of human blood – or even a few drops ofdried blood in a salt solution – is introduced into it. In 1901, Uhlenhuth usedhis method to help convict a sadistic killer of children. Ludwig Tessnow was acarpenter, and in 1898 he had been a suspect when two little girls were killedand dismembered in a village near Osnabrück. Tessnow had insisted that brownstains on his clothes were wood dye, and the police believed him. When, threeyears later, two young brothers were killed in the same manner – literally tornto pieces – on the island of Rügen, Tessnow was again a suspect; again heinsisted that stains on his clothing were of wood dye. The police sent hisclothes to Uhlenhuth, who was able to show that some stains were of human blood,and that others were of sheep’s blood (Tessnow was also suspected ofdisembowelling sheep). He was executed in 1904.Tessnow had been living in the areas where the murders took place; but if he hadbeen a tramp, like Vacher, he might never have been caught. This may not havebeen apparent in 1902, but as the rate of sex crime began steadily to rise inthe second decade of the twentieth century, it became increasingly obvious. If asex criminal observed a reasonable degree of caution, there was nothing to stophim from going on for years. In Cinkota, near Budapest, a plumber named BelaKiss killed at least a dozen women between 1912 and 1914, storing most of thebodies in oil drums; he had been conscripted into the army by the time someonefound the corpses in his cottage, and he was never caught. In Hanover soon afterthe First World War, a homosexual butcher named Fritz Haarmann killed aboutfifty youths, and disposed of their bodies by selling them for meat. GeorgGrossmann, a Berlin pedlar, killed an unknown number of girls during the sameperiod, and also sold them for meat. (When police burst into his flat in 1921,they found the trussed-up carcase of a girl lying on the bed, ready forbutchering.) Karl Denke, a Munsterberg landlord, made a habit of butcheringstrangers, and eating their flesh; when he was arrested in 1924, police foundthe pickled remains of thirty bodies, and Denke admitted that he had been eatingnothing but human flesh for three years. These four killers escaped noticebecause they killed their victims on their own premises. All were undoubtedlymotivated by sex.Sex killers who moved around were equally elusive. Between 1910 and 1934, anitinerant carpenter named Albert Fish tortured and killed an unknown number ofchildren – he confessed to four hundred – and was finally caught only because hewas careless enough to put a letter describing one of the murders in an envelopethat could be traced. During 1926 and 1927, a travelling rapist and murdererkilled twenty-two women in America and Canada, starting in San Francisco andending in Winnipeg, and in the meantime travelling as far east as Philadelphia.Most of the victims were landladies who advertised rooms to rent, and theirnaked bodies were usually found in the room they were offering. For a long timethe police were not even aware of what the killer looked like, but eventually awoman to whom he had sold some jewellery – taken from a victim – was able todescribe him as a polite young man with a simian mouth and jaw. The policeeventually caught up with Earle Nelson, the ‘Gorilla Murderer’, simply becausehe was unable to stop killing, and left a well-defined trail of corpses behindhim. In Düsseldorf during 1929, an unknown sadist attacked men, women andchildren, stabbing them or knocking them unconscious with a hammer. Eightvictims were killed; many others were stabbed or beaten unconscious. The killer,Peter Kürten, was eventually caught when one of his rape victims led police tohis flat. In Cleveland, Ohio, in the mid-1930s, a killer who became known as the‘Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run’ killed and dismembered a dozen men and women,mostly derelicts and prostitutes; in two cases, two victims were killed at thesame time and the dismembered parts of the bodies mixed together. The murdersceased in 1938, and the ‘Cleveland Torso Killer’ was never caught.Yet in spite of the notoriety achieved by these mass murderers, sex crimeremained at a fairly low level during the 1930s. It accelerated during theSecond World War – partly because the anarchic social atmosphere produced a lossof inhibition, partly because soldiers were deprived of their usual sexualoutlet. By 1946, sex crime had doubled in England from its pre-war level. Inlarge American cities, it had quadrupled by 1956. Even in Japan, where sex crimewas still rare, a laundry worker – and employee of the American army – namedYoshio Kodaira raped and murdered ten girls in Tokyo between May 1945 and August1946. He had made the mistake of giving his last victim his name and addresswhen he offered her a job in his laundry, and she had left it with her parents;Kodaira was hanged in October 1949.By the time I began compiling An Encyclopedia of Murder in 1959, a strange newtype of crime was beginning to emerge – ‘the motiveless crime’. In April 1959, abachelor named Norman Smith, who lived alone in his caravan in Florida, watcheda television programme called ‘The Sniper’, then took a pistol, and went outwith the intention of shooting someone – anyone. The victim happened to be a MrsHazel Woodard, who was killed as she sat watching television. Colin commented:‘Apparently he killed out of boredom,’ and compared it with the case of NathanLeopold and Richard Loeb, the two wealthy Chicago students who decided to commita murder simply as a ‘challenge’. In May 1924 they chose at random afourteen-year-old boy named Bobbie Franks and battered him to death with achisel. They were caught because Leopold lost his glasses at the site where thebody was dumped. The strange motivation – or lack of it – led journalists tolabel the murder ‘the crime of the century’. In June 1949, a prettynineteen-year-old brunette named Ruth Steinhagen checked into the EdgewaterBeach hotel in Chicago, and sent a note to a man whom she had adored from afarfor two years: baseball player Eddie Waitkus, the unmarried first baseman of thePhillies; she asked if she could see him briefly to tell him something of greatimportance. In her room, she pointed a rifle at him and shot him dead. Asked whyshe did it, she explained that she ‘wanted the thrill of murdering him’. By thelate 1950s, such crimes were ceasing to be unusual. In July 1958, a man namedNorman Foose stopped his jeep in the town of Cuba, New Mexico, and with a rifleshot dead two children as they stood beside their mother; when caught, heexplained that he wanted to do something about the population explosion. InFebruary 1959, a pretty blonde named Penny Bjorkland accepted a lift from a manshe knew slightly, and shot him dead with a revolver; traced through the bullet,she explained that she was curious to see if she could commit a murder and nothave it on her conscience.During the 1960s, there was a perceptible rise in such crimes. In 1960, a youngGerman named Klaus Gosmann knocked on the door of a flat he had chosen atrandom, and shot dead the man who opened the door, as well as his fiancée, whowas standing behind him. Then he turned and walked away. He committed four more‘random’ murders before he was caught. In November 1966, an eighteen-year-oldstudent named Robert Smith walked into a beauty parlour in Mesa, Arizona,ordered five women and two children to lie down on the floor, and shot them allin the back of the head. Both Gosmann and Smith were highly intelligent,regarded by their professors as good students. Yet apparently both suffered froma sense of boredom, of unreality. Smith’s explanation of his motive provides thevital clue to this new type of murder. ‘I wanted to become known, to get myselfa name.’ He felt that killing seven people would ensure that his name appearedin newspapers around the world. The ‘motiveless murderer’ who began to emerge inthe late 1950s was usually suffering from a kind of ego-starvation, a desire tobe ‘recognised’. In short, such murders are not committed out of sexualfrustration, but out of a frustrated craving for ‘self-esteem’.This seemed to provide an interesting clue to what was going on. In the 1940s,the American psychologist Abraham Maslow had suggested an interesting theory ofhuman motivation, which he called the ‘hierarchy of needs’. Maslow pointed outthat if a man is starving to death, his basic need is for food; he imagines thatif he could have two square meals a day he would be completely happy. If heachieves this aim, then a new level of need emerges – for security, a roof overhis head; every tramp dreams of retiring to a country cottage. If he achievesthis too, then the next level emerges: for love, for sex, for emotionalsatisfaction. If this level is achieved, then yet another level emerges: forself-esteem, the satisfaction of the need to be liked and respected.These four ‘levels’ could be clearly seen in the history of criminality over thepast two centuries. In the eighteenth century there was so much poverty andstarvation that most crime was committed out of a simple need for survival –Maslow’s first level. By the mid-nineteenth century, the most notorious crimesare domestic murders that take place in respectable middle-class homes, and themotive is a desire to preserve domestic security. Towards the end of thecentury, Maslow’s third level emerges: sex crime. In the mid-twentieth century,the fourth level – self-esteem – becomes a motive for murder. It is as ifsociety is passing through the same stages as the individual; and since societyis composed of individuals, this may be less absurd than it sounds.Now obviously, no murder can be genuinely without motive; when we label a crimemotiveless we are simply admitting that it cannot be classified under the usualheadings. When we drum our fingers impatiently on the tabletop, the action seemsto have no motive, but a zoologist would say that it is a ‘displacementactivity’, and that it is due to frustration. In the same way, Robert Smith’smurders in the Arizona beauty parlour were not truly motiveless; they were anexpression of boredom and resentment. This leads to the recognition thatresentment can be detected in the majority of motiveless crimes. This resentmentis often totally paranoid in character – like the desire to ‘do something aboutthe population explosion’ that drove Norman Foose to shoot two children. A morerecent example occurred near Santa Cruz, California, when a ‘dropout’ with anobsession about the environment murdered a whole family. On 19 October 1970 thehouse of Dr Victor Ohta, an eye surgeon, was seen to be on fire. Firemendiscovered five bodies in the swimming pool – those of Dr Ohta, his wife and twochildren, and his secretary Dorothy Cadwallader. Under the windscreen wiper ofhis Rolls-Royce was a note that declared that ‘today World War III will begin’,and that anyone who misused the environment would from now on suffer the penaltyof death. ‘Materialism must die or mankind must stop.’ It was signed: ‘Knight ofWands – Knight of Pentacles – Knight of Cups – Knight of Swords’ – these beingcards in the Tarot pack. The surgeon’s estate car had been driven into a railwaytunnel, obviously in the hope of causing a serious accident, but a slow-movinggoods train had pushed it out of the way.In nearby woods there was a colony of ‘hippies’, and one of these told thepolice about a twenty-four-year-old car mechanic named John Linley Frazier whohad recently deserted his wife and moved into a shack near the village ofFelton; it was approached by a kind of drawbridge across a deep ditch, andFrazier apparently drew this up every night. He had told other hippies that hehad burgled the Ohtas’ house on an earlier occasion, and that they were ‘toomaterialistic’ and ought to be killed. Frazier was taken in for questioning, andhis fingerprints on the Rolls-Royce established his guilt beyond all doubt. Theevidence indicated that he had planned the murders several days in advance, andhe was sentenced to death. It also became clear at the trial that there was nofoundation for his charge that the Ohtas were destroying the environment – theyhad taken care to leave the woodland around their house untouched. Nor couldOhta be accused of materialism – he helped finance a local hospital and oftengave free treatment to those who could not afford his fees. The murders werebased upon the same kind of paranoid resentment that had led Charles Manson towrite ‘Death to pigs’ in blood on the bedroom wall of one victim.Does not the use of a term like ‘paranoid resentment’ indicate that such akiller should be regarded as insane, and therefore not responsible for hisactions? There are certain cases where this is obviously true – as when thekiller suffers from delusions or hears imaginary voices; but it is difficult todraw an exact dividing line between paranoia and a resentment based on self-pityand envy. When Judge Ronald George, who tried the case of the HillsideStranglers of Los Angeles, Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono, was asked whethersuch acts did not prove them insane, he replied: ‘Why should we call someoneinsane because he or she chooses not to conform to our standards of civilisedbehaviour?’ This seems to apply to the majority of ‘motiveless murders’ sincethe 1950s, as well as to many acts of political violence, as will be seen.There is an additional complication to be taken into account. In the case of theOhta killings, there was no evidence of sexual assault. But many ‘motivelessmurders’ involve rape or other forms of sexual violence. At first this soundslike a contradiction in terms until we recall that most ‘motiveless murders’involve boredom and resentment. The murder of Bobbie Franks is a case in point.Leopold and Loeb had originally meant to kidnap a girl and rape her. Yet even ifthey had done so, the murder would still be classified as a motiveless crime,since the motive was not sex, but a desire to prove themselves ‘supermen’. Thedetermining factor has to be the psychology of the killers.This can also be seen in the case of multiple killer Carl Panzram, executed in1930. When Panzram was arrested for housebreaking in Washington, DC in 1928,no-one suspected that he was a murderer. For many years he had been known inmany American prisons as the toughest troublemaker they had ever encountered –in one prison he had burned down the workshop and wrecked the kitchen with anaxe. When guards discovered a loosened bar in his cell, Panzram received abrutal beating and was suspended from the ceiling by his wrists. A young guardnamed Henry Lesser was shocked, and sent Panzram a dollar by a ‘trusty’. Atfirst Panzram thought it was a joke; when he realised that it was a gesture ofsympathy, his eyes filled with tears. He told Lesser that if he could get him apencil and paper, he would write him his life story. The result was one of themost extraordinary documents in the annals of criminality. Born on a mid-westernfarm of Prussian immigrant parents, Panzram had been in trouble from an earlyage. His father had deserted the family and life was hard. Carl envied morewell-to-do boys at school and, when he burgled the house of a neighbour, wassent to reform school. Always tough and rebellious, he was repeatedly beaten,and the more he was beaten, the more he dreamed of revenge. Hitching a lift on afreight train, he was sodomised by four hoboes. From then on, he frequentlyinflicted sodomy – at gunpoint – on people he disliked. His sense of injusticedrove him to a frenzy of resentment. This in turn finally drove him to murder.He stole a yacht, then lured sailors aboard and raped and killed them. InAfrica, working for an oil company, he sodomised and murdered a black child, andshot six negroes in the back ‘for fun’. Back in America, he continued to rapeand kill male children, bringing his total of murders up to twenty.When Henry Lesser asked him: ‘What’s your racket?’, Panzram smiled and replied:‘I reform people.’ When Lesser asked how, he replied: ‘By killing them.’ Heliked to describe himself as ‘the man who goes around doing good’. He meant thathe regarded life as so vile that to murder someone was to do him a favour. Heexplained in his autobiography that he felt that the guilt for his murders wouldsomehow be visited on the people who had done him harm. This is a typicalexample of the strange upside-down logic of the ‘motiveless’ killer: when hekills, he feels he is somehow taking revenge on ‘society’ – unaware that thereis no such thing as ‘society’, only individuals.In Leavenworth Jail – where he had been sentenced to twenty-five years on thebasis of his confession – Panzram murdered a foreman with an iron bar and wassentenced to death. When the Society for the Abolition of Capital Punishmenttried to intervene, he told them not to waste their time. ‘I look forward todeath as a real pleasure . . .’ His wish was granted on 5 September 1930.The same ‘suicidal’ urge can be seen in many mass murderers and serial killers.In his book Compulsive Killers, the psychiatrist Elliott Leyton speaks of ‘theserial killer whose murders provide both revenge and a lifelong celebritycareer, and the mass killer who no longer wishes to live, and whose murdersconstitute his suicide note’. The ‘resentment killer’ feels that he is killingwith a definite aim: to prove to himself that he is not a weakling and a loser,to take revenge on society, and so on. He soon realises that killing brings himno closer to his objective; in fact, it leaves him with a curious sense ofmeaninglessness and emptiness – and the knowledge that he has placed himselfbeyond the bounds of normal society. The result may be suicide, or an act ofcarelessness that invites arrest. Panzram challenged the jury to sentence him todeath, declaring: ‘If I live I’ll execute some more of you.’ Steve Judy, therapist killer already mentioned, told the jury: ‘You’d better put me to death.Because next time it might be one of you, or your daughter.’ Harvey Glatman, aLos Angeles photographer who raped and murdered three girls, asked his publicdefender to request the death penalty. Gary Gilmore, who committed two pointlessmurders in the course of robbery in 1976, begged the jury to sentence him todeath, and died by firing squad in January 1977.The element of resentment can clearly be seen in one of the most widelypublicised cases of the 1960s, the ‘Moors murders’ (which will be discussed morefully in Chapter 5). Like Carl Panzram, Ian Brady, the illegitimate son of aGlasgow waitress, became a burglar at the age of eleven because he envied thewell-to-do boys in the ‘posh’ school to which he had been sent by the localauthorities. After several years on probation and a period in reform school, hediscovered the ideas of the Marquis de Sade, and became enthusiastic aboutSade’s ‘philosophy of selfishness’. He began to daydream about ‘the perfectcrime’; but it was not until he met an eighteen-year-old typist, Myra Hindley,who became completely infatuated with him, that he began seriously to considerputting the dreams into practice. Between 1963 and 1965, with Myra Hindley’shelp, he raped and murdered five children. Myra was completely dominated byBrady, and it seems to have been this heady sense of power over another person –Brady had always been a loner – that led, eighteen months after they becamelovers, to the first murder, that of sixteen-year-old Pauline Reade. It was inplanning his fifth murder, that of a seventeen-year-old homosexual named EdwardEvans, that he made the mistake that led to his arrest. He had become friendlywith Myra’s brother-in-law, sixteen-year-old David Smith. Brady had alreadyconverted Myra from Catholicism to atheism and Nazism. David Smith proved anequally apt pupil, writing in his journal: ‘Rape is not a crime, it is a stateof mind. Murder is a hobby and a supreme pleasure.’ ‘God is a superstition, acancer that eats into the brain.’ ‘People are like maggots, small, blind andworthless.’ However, when he witnessed Brady murdering Edward Evans with an axe,he suddenly understood the gap between the theory and practice of sadism, andtelephoned the police.The result was the murder trial whose impact on the British public can only becompared with that of the Jack the Ripper case nearly seventy years earlier.Before Brady and Hindley had murdered ten-year-old Lesley Ann Downey, they hadtaken pornographic photographs, then made a tape recording of her screams andpleas for mercy, which they concluded with some lively music. Played in court,it created a sense of unbelief and shock. The novelist Pamela Hansford Johnson,who, together with her husband C.P. Snow, attended the trial, found that it hadthe quality of a nightmare. She records that one of the most frightening thingsabout the accused was their sheer ordinariness. They seemed unaware of theenormity of what they had done. She goes on to cite other recent crimes ofbrutality and vandalism, and the strange ‘affectlessness’ of the perpetrators –the plea: ‘I was bored.’Yet in assuming that Brady’s murders were committed out of boredom, she isoverlooking the real motive. Detective Chief Superintendent Peter Topping, inhis book on the case, quotes Myra Hindley: ‘She felt he enjoyed the perversesense of power that his physical superiority over children gave him . . .’ Andin fact, the Moors murder case is about power rather than about sex. And thecraving for power springs, in turn, out of resentment. In this respect, atleast, Brady is not unlike the majority of human beings – the need forself-esteem is common to everyone. Ernest Becker analyses it in his book TheDenial of Death: ‘We are all hopelessly absorbed with ourselves . . . Inchildhood we see the struggle for self-esteem at its least disguised . . . Hiswhole organism shouts the claims of his natural narcissism.’ And this does notapply merely to spoilt children. ‘It is too all-absorbing and relentless to bean aberration, it expresses the heart of the creature: the desire to stand out,to be the one in creation . . . he must desperately justify himself as an objectof primary value in the universe; he must stand out, be a hero, make the biggestcontribution to world life, show that he counts more than anyone else.’ Whenthis ‘urge to heroism’ and self-assertion is frustrated, it turns intoresentment. And in Brady’s case, as with so many other serial killers, theresentment turned to murder.Four years later, a Los Angeles jury found themselves baffled as they listenedto the evidence against Charles Manson and three of his female ‘disciples’,Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie van Houten, accused of involvementin the death of nine people, including film star Sharon Tate. There was aslightly insane air about the whole trial, and it was the weird logic ofManson’s supporters that created the mad atmosphere. Like Hitler after hisunsuccessful putsch of 1923, he seemed determined to turn it into a trial of hisaccusers. ‘You make your children what they are . . . These children –everything they have done, they have done for the love of their brothers.’ Askedif she thought that killing nine people was unimportant, Susan Atkins counteredby asking if the killing of thousands of people with napalm was important,apparently arguing that two blacks make a white. Yet in private, reported theprosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi, Manson had allegedly confessed to thirty-fivemurders.It is tempting to dismiss all this as the confused rhetoric of drug addicts. Yetit is worth studying more closely because it is so typical of theself-justification of the serial killer. What Manson was really implying wasthat the laws of an unjust society deserve to be broken, and that in doing this,criminal violence is justified. Even if we accept his argument, it is difficultto see how his victims were responsible for the injustice. His attitude is basedon self-pity; he told the psychiatrist Joel Norris that he saw himself as the‘ultimate victim of society’. Manson played guitar and wrote songs, and hebelieved that he deserved to be as successful as Bob Dylan or the Beatles. Hisreasoning seemed to be that since he was not successful, then someone must be toblame, and someone deserved to suffer. Carl Panzram had written: ‘Before I left[home] I looked around and figured that one of our neighbours who was rich andhad a nice home full of nice things, he had too much and I had too little.’ Andpunishment only made him dream of getting his own back. ‘Then I began to thinkthat I would have my revenge . . . If I couldn’t injure those who had injuredme, then I would injure someone else.’ This is what Jean Paul Sartre has called‘magical thinking’ – which means thinking with the emotions rather than reason.And it inevitably leads to absurd results. An old joke tells of an Arab in thedesert who asked another Arab why he was carrying an umbrella. ‘I bought it inEngland. If you want it to rain you leave it at home.’In 1959 a labourer namedPatrick Byrne, who had raped and then decapitated a girl in a Birmingham hostel,told the police: ‘I was trying to get my own back [on women] for causing mynervous tension through sex.’ But then none of us is free of this tendency toirrationality. Is there anyone in the world who doesn’t swear when he stubs histoe, or feel victimised when a traffic light changes to red just before hearrives?Sartre himself was not free from the tendency to magical thinking; his leftismwas based on a lifelong detestation of the bourgeoisie (the class to which hisown family belonged), and he once declared that true political progress lies inthe attempt of the coloured races to free themselves through violence. In fact,much of the extreme leftism that Sartre espoused has its roots in the kind ofnegative thinking that we have observed in Panzram, Brady and Manson. (The same,of course, applies to many extreme right-wing groups, such as the AmericanWeathermen or the Italian Ordine Nero.) When we analyse the thought process thatleads to crime, we see that it involves looking around for someone on whom wecan lay the blame. What Panzram, Manson, Sartre, Karl Marx and the majority ofserial killers in this book have in common is that they lay the blame on‘society’. And what these people also have in common is that they have blindedthemselves to the idea that they themselves might be partly to blame for theirproblems.The nearest Japanese equivalent to the Manson case involved members of a groupwho called themselves the United Red Army Faction, the Rengo Sigikun, anorganisation formed in 1969 by radical students. Nine members of the Red ArmyFaction were responsible for hijacking a Japanese Air Lines jet on 31 March 1970and were released in North Korea. After a raid on a Mooka gunshop in February1971, members of the group escaped with large quantities of arms. Later thatyear, thirty-seven policemen were injured in a bomb explosion while trying tocontrol a demonstration in the Meiji Park in Tokyo. In the autumn, the wife of apolice official died when she opened a parcel bomb that arrived through themail. In both cases, the suspects were Tsuneo Mori, leader of the Red ArmyFaction, and Hiroko Nagata.In February 1972, police searching empty holiday residences in the area of MountKasha, Gumma province, found fingerprints of a wanted radical in a cottage atthe foot of the mountain. While police watched the cottage from hiding, a vancontaining five young people was spotted in the nearby town of Matsuida. Twowere captured; the other three escaped into the mountains. The following day, anarmy of police with tracker dogs combed the area. Suddenly an armed man ran outof the bushes and tried to stab a policeman; a woman came to the man’s aid as hestruggled. When finally subdued, they proved to be Tsuneo Mori, thetwenty-seven-year-old leader of the Red Army Faction, and Hiroko Nagata. Theoperation also seems to have flushed out six more revolutionaries – four men andtwo women – who went into a shop in the railway station of Karuiwaza, Nagano – aholiday resort – to buy cigarettes. Their smell and the state of their clothesled the woman behind the counter to suspect that they had been sleeping rough,and she told the station manager, who notified the police. The radicals fled toan empty villa, taking hostage the wife of the caretaker, and it was soonsurrounded by police. After a ten-day siege and the death of two policemen theradicals surrendered. The youngest of the captives was a sixteen-year-old youth.Meanwhile, Tsuneo Mori had confessed to the police that his group had murderedtwelve of their own members during the time they had been in hiding on MountKasho. Following his instructions, police unearthed three decomposing corpses ina cedar forest – one man and two women, one of whom was eight months pregnant.Medical examination revealed that the cause of death was freezing in sub-zerotemperatures; all three had been bound and left in the open to die. The womenproved to be members of another radical organisation which had merged with theRed Army Faction – the Chukyo Anti-Japan-US Security Pact. Nine more bodies wereeventually discovered, bringing the total to three women and nine men. Policesearching for the corpses in the mountains admitted that their efficiency hadbeen improved during the previous year when they had searched for the eightvictims of a sex maniac called Kiyoshi Okubo in the same area; they had learnedto tell a grave by the colour of the earth.What gradually emerged was that Tsuneo Mori was not the one who was mainlyresponsible for the murders. The person who had inspired them had been HirokoNagata. Mori was a weak character, who felt that he had to maintain hisleadership through harshness; he spent much of the interrogation in tears.Hiroko Nagata, a pharmaceutical graduate, was altogether stronger. But herinferiority complex about her unattractive appearance had turned to murderousparanoia in the freezing winter hideout where the thirty Red Army members hidfor three months. (They frequently made long treks in the moonlight, staggeringwith exhaustion, to other empty cabins; Mori urged them on by reminding themthat Mao Tse Tung had suffered worse things during the Long March.) A womanmember who escaped told of candlelight discussions of points of Marxistdoctrine, ending with demands for ruthless ‘self-criticism’. All this led toharsh punishments, and to a series of ‘loyalty purges’ rather like the Stalinpurges of the thirties. One twenty-two-year-old youth – the founder of theChukyo group – was beaten, then stabbed to death by his two younger brothers,who were ordered to carry out the murder to prove their loyalty. A woman whoescaped – leaving her three-month-old baby behind – had watched her husbandstabbed to death but had not dared to protest in case she was killed too. It hadbeen Hiroko Nagata who had led the discussions, often losing her temper andbecoming hysterical. She liked to tell other members of the group that they weretoo materialistic. It was Nagata, too, who had ordered that the hair of thethree dead women should be cropped close to the skull as a punishment; one ofthem had been tied up naked and confined in a narrow space below the floor,another tied to a pillar for several days until she died. Her crime was wearingearrings.In prison and under interrogation, Hiroko Nagata at first remained arrogant,ordering the investigators around, demanding coffee, turning her back on them.But as police pointed out the various mistakes that had led to her arrest, shesuddenly admitted: ‘We’ve been licked’; thereafter she began combing her hair,which until then she had kept in a ‘revolutionary’ state of untidiness.In January 1973, Tsuneo Mori hanged himself in prison. Hiroko Nagata wassentenced to life imprisonment.In retrospect, the most incomprehensible thing about the murders is that theother members of the group permitted them. This may be due partly to the naturalobedience to authority that characterises the Japanese (one of the survivorsdescribed how all used to listen, with averted eyes, as Mori and Nagataharangued them). But it also seems clear that the group were totally dominatedby their leaders, just as the Manson family was dominated by its father figure,and Myra Hindley by Ian Brady. In effect, they were brainwashed – and this againseems to be a phenomenon that is often associated with revolutionary movements.When heiress Patty Hearst was kidnapped at gunpoint by a group calling itselfthe Symbionese Liberation Army on 5 February 1974, it was as a ‘capitalist’hostage; the ‘Army’s’ motto was ‘Death to the Fascist insect that preys upon thelife of the people’. After her father had distributed two million dollars’ worthof food to the poor – on the orders of the ‘Army’ – Patty Hearst sent herparents a tape stating that she had been converted to the revolutionaryideology, and denouncing the food distribution as a sham; shortly afterwards shetook part in the armed robbery of a bank. In May, the ‘Army’s’ Los Angeleshideout was surrounded by police; in the battle and the fire that followed, theleaders of the movement were killed. Yet Patty Hearst continued ‘on the run’with the remaining members of the gang until her arrest in September 1975. Hertrial led to a sentence of seven years’ imprisonment but she was released onprobation after eight months and quickly returned to the non-revolutionary viewsof her early days.In the Red Army Faction case, perhaps the most striking thing is thedegeneration of Tsuneo Mori and Hiroko Nagata as they realised that theypossessed absolute power over their followers. For Hiroko Nagata at any rate,murder became a pleasure. This is again something that can be observed in themajority of serial killers. Killing and inflicting torture become an addiction.Yet perhaps this is hardly surprising when we consider that de Sade’s attitudetowards society is also ‘revolutionary’, and that there is a definite linkbetween his political views and his ‘sadism’. He takes it for granted that allauthority is unutterably corrupt, and bases his philosophy of murder and tortureon this completely negative attitude. Since the masters are vile, and the slaveslittle better than maggots, both deserve utter contempt. In Nagata and Mori, thesame attitude led to torture and executions. In other Marxist revolutionarygroups it has often led to a kind of ruthlessness that springs out of paranoia –as when, on 21 June 1977, Italian ‘Red Army’ terrorists burst into the roomwhere Remo Cacciafesta, dean of Rome University’s School of Economics, waslecturing, and shot him in the legs, shouting that he was teaching his studentsto adapt to a fundamentally immoral society. The common denominator of politicalrevolutionaries and serial killers is resentment and ‘magical thinking’.What is responsible for this increase in ‘magical thinking’ that has led to theincrease in serial murder and political violence? In 1935, the philosopherEdmund Husserl suggested a link between political brutality – of Hitler, Stalin,Mussolini – and the gradual decay of faith in rational certainty that hadoccurred over the past two centuries. His argument was less far-fetched than itsounds. For practical purposes, the philosophy of revolution can be traced backto 1762, the year Rousseau’s Social Contract appeared, with its famous openingsentence: ‘Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.’ The corollary wasthat he is not free because various wicked authorities have entered into aconspiracy to deprive him of his freedom. Rousseau was weak and neurotic, and heurgently wanted to find somewhere to lay the blame for his own unhappiness. Sohe created the myth that there was once a golden age when all men lived togetherin perfect harmony, and that this came to an end because a few evil men seizedpower and enslaved the rest. It followed, of course, that the answer to theproblem was for the oppressed to strike off their chains and overthrow theoppressors. His philosophy, as developed by Marx, has eventually come todominate half the globe, until it is a part of the air we breathe. We take itfor granted that all right-thinking young people hold strong views about socialjustice, and to regard ‘protest’ with favour and authority with disfavour. Weeven take it for granted that most people hate the police. The tendency to ‘lookfor somewhere to lay the blame’ has become a part of our intellecutalinheritance, and it is impossible to understand the psychology of the serialkiller without taking it into account.In practice, the kind of violence typified by the Red Army Faction – and thekind of irrationality that seemed to lie behind it – produced a powerfulbacklash. There was a general feeling that people who are willing to commitmurder for their political ideology are dangerous cranks who have no place in acivilised society. Groups like the Japanese Red Army, the Italian Red Brigades,the Baader-Meinhof gang and the Symbionese Liberation Army were hunted down withthe full approval of the public. The suicides of Ulrike Meinhof and AndreasBaader in 1977 seemed to symbolise the end of an epoch. By the mid-1980s,Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost and perestroika had made the politicsof violent revolution seem oddly irrelevant. Yet it was at about this point,when a new age of reason seemed to have dawned in politics, that the generalpublic became aware of the emergence of the serial killer.In England, it was the case of the ‘Yorkshire Ripper’ that brought a generalawareness of the problems of tracking down a random killer. It was appropriatethat the press should have labelled him the Yorkshire Ripper, for he was themost notorious serial killer in Great Britain since the days of Jack the Ripper.The first three attacks occurred in the second half of 1975. Two women wereknocked unconscious by hammer blows dealt from behind; in the first case, theattacker had raised her dress and was about to plunge the knife into her stomachwhen he was interrupted and ran away; in the second, he made slashes on thewoman’s buttocks with a hacksaw blade. The third victim, a prostitute, wasknocked unconscious with the hammer, then stabbed to death. She was the first ofthirteen murder victims over the course of the next five years. Some wereprostitutes; some were simply women or girls who happened to be out walking inthe dark. In most cases, the victim was stabbed and slashed repeatedly in thearea of the stomach and vagina, although the killer stopped short of actualdisembowelment.By early 1978, the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper had become the biggest policeoperation ever mounted in Britain. Yet the problem facing the police – as in allsuch cases – was the sheer number of suspects. In the early years of thetwentieth century the great criminologist Edmond Locard had stated the basictenet of forensic detection: ‘Every contact leaves a trace’; but in the case ofa random killer, the ‘traces’ left behind are useless, since they afford no clueto his identity. The police had to hunt the Yorkshire Ripper with the‘needle-in-the-haystack’ method – checking thousands of remote possibilities. Inthis case, the numberplates of all cars seen regularly in red-light districtswere noted, and the drivers interviewed. When one murdered prostitute was foundto be in possession of a new £5 note, the police traced the batch of notes fromthe bank to twenty-three factories in Bradford, whose employees theyinterviewed. These included T. & W.H. Clark (Holdings) Ltd, an engineeringtransport firm, and among those they interviewed was a bearded, powerfully-builtyoung man named Peter Sutcliffe; but they were satisfied with his alibi. In thefollowing year Sutcliffe was again questioned because his car had been seenseven times in a red-light district, but he was believed when he said that hehad to drive through it on his way to work. The car registration numbers hadbeen fed into the police computer at Hendon; but the names of suspectsinterviewed were not fed into a computer. So the constable who talked toSutcliffe about his car numberplate had no idea that he had also beeninterviewed in connection with the £5 note. It had been noted in reports at theLeeds police headquarters, but a huge backlog meant that these had not yet beenprocessed – after all, 150,000 people had been interviewed and 27,000 housessearched. So Peter Sutcliffe was enabled to go on killing for two more years.When further investigation of the £5 note reduced the number of firms who mighthave received it from twenty-three to three, Sutcliffe was questioned yet again,and his workmates began jokingly to call him Jack the Ripper. In fact, whenSutcliffe was interviewed this time, he was wearing the boots he had worn whenmurdering his tenth victim, a nineteen-year-old clerk named Josephine Whitaker;the police had taken a mould of the imprint, but the police who questioned himdid not think to look at his feet.After the thirteenth murder – of a student named Jacqueline Hill – the policedecided to set up an advisory team of experts to study the murders all overagain. These went to examine all the murder sites and used a computer toestimate their ‘centre of gravity’. This led then to the conclusion that thekiller lived in Bradford rather than Leeds, where many of the murders had takenplace. The next obvious step was to interview again every suspect who lived inBradford – especially those who had already been interviewed in connection withthe £5 note. Since the clues now included three sets of tyre tracks and threesets of footprints, it seems certain that this latest investigation would haveidentified Peter Sutcliffe as the Yorkshire Ripper. In fact, he was caughtbefore that could happen. On 2 January 1981 two policemen on a routine patrol ofthe red-light district of Sheffield stopped their car to question a couple in aparked Rover. The man identified himself as Peter Williams; a check on the carwith the police computer at Hendon revealed that it had a false numberplate.Taken in for questioning, Sutcliffe soon admitted his identity. In the RipperIncident Room at Leeds, it was noted that the size of his shoes corresponded tothe imprints found by three bodies. The constable who had arrested him recalledthat he had requested permission to urinate before accompanying the police. Hiscolleague, Sergeant Robert Ring, returned to the spot – an oil storage tank –and found a knife and a hammer. Faced with this evidence, Peter Sutcliffefinally confessed to being the Yorkshire Ripper. The initial motive of theattacks had been a brooding resentment about a prostitute who had cheated him of£10, which had become (in the illogical manner of serial killers) a desire topunish all prostitutes. After a while, violence had become an addiction, and heattacked any woman he saw walking alone after dark. In May 1981 he was sentencedto life imprisonment, and subsequently removed to Broadmoor, a secure hospitalfor the criminally insane.The Yorkshire Ripper case taught the police an important lesson. If suspects,like car number plates, had been fed into a computer, Sutcliffe would probablyhave been taken in for questioning in 1978 – when he was wearing the boots whoseimprint was found beside Josephine Whitaker – and three lives would have beensaved. A computer would have had no problem storing 150,000 suspects and 22,000statements.Yet even with the aid of a computer, the task of tracking down a random serialkiller like Sutcliffe would have been enormous. It could only display suchdetails as the methods of known sex offenders, and the names of suspects who hadbeen interviewed more than once. In their next major investigation of a serialkiller, the Surrey police began with a list of 4,900 sex offenders – which, asit happened, contained the name of the man they were seeking. The ‘RailwayRapist’ began to operate in 1982; at this stage two men were involved in sexualattacks on five women on or near railway stations. By 1984 one of the men hadbegun to operate alone. He threatened his victims with a knife, tied theirhands, and raped them with a great deal of violence. Twenty-seven such attacksoccurred in 1984 and 1985. In January 1986, the body of nineteen-year-old AlisonDay was found in the River Lea; she had vanished seventeen days earlier on herway to meet her boyfriend. She had been raped and strangled. In April 1986,fifteen-year-old Maartje Tamboezer, daughter of a Dutch oil executive, wasaccosted as she took a short cut through woods near Horsley, and dragged off thefootpath; she was also raped and strangled. Her attacker was evidently aware ofthe most recent advance in forensic detection, ‘genetic fingerprinting’, bywhich a suspect can be identified from the distinctive pattern in the DNA of hisbody cells. The killer had stuffed a burning paper handkerchief into her vagina.A man who had been seen running for a train soon after the murder was believedto be the rapist, and two million train tickets were examined in an attempt tofind one with his fingerprints.A month later, a twenty-nine-year-old secretary named Anne Lock disappeared onher way home from work; her body was found ten weeks later. Again, an attempthad been made to destroy sperm traces by burning.It was at this point that the police forces involved in the investigationdecided to link computers; the result was the list of 4,900 sex offenders, soonreduced to 1,999. At number 1,594 was a man called John Duffy, charged withraping his ex-wife and attacking her lover with a knife. The computers showedthat he had also been arrested on suspicion of loitering near a railway station.(Since the blood group of the Anne Lock strangler had been the same as that ofthe ‘Railway Rapist’, police had been keeping a watch on railway stations.)Duffy was called in for questioning, and his similarity to the ‘Railway Rapist’noted. (Duffy was small, ginger-haired and pockmarked.) When the police tried toconduct a second interview, Duffy was in hospital suffering from amnesia,alleging that he had been beaten up by muggers. The hospital authoritiesdeclined to allow him to be interviewed. Since he was only one of two thousandsuspects, the police did not persist.At this point, the investigation team decided that an ‘expert’ might be able tohelp. They asked Dr David Canter, a professor of psychology at the University ofSurrey, to review all the evidence. Using techniques similar to those used bythe Yorkshire Ripper team – studying the locations of the attacks – he concludedthat the ‘centre of gravity’ lay in the North London area, and that the rapistprobably lived within three miles of Finchley Road. He also concluded that hehad been a semi-skilled worker, and that his relationship with his wife had beena stormy one. When Canter’s analysis was matched up against the remainingsuspects, the computer immediately threw up the name of John Duffy, who lived inKilburn. Police kept him under surveillance until they decided that they couldno longer take the risk of leaving him at liberty – another schoolgirl had beenraped with typical violence since Duffy was committed to hospital – and arrestedhim. When a fellow martial arts enthusiast admitted that Duffy had persuaded himto beat him up so he could claim loss of memory, the police were certain that hewas the man they were seeking. Five of rape victims picked him out at anidentity parade, and string found in the home of his parents proved to beidentical with that which had been used to tie Maartje Tamboezer’s wrists. Whenforensic scientists matched fibres from Alison Day’s sheepskin coat to fibresfound on one of Duffy’s sweaters, the final link in the chain of evidence wasestablished; although he continued to refuse to admit or deny his guilt, JohnDuffy was sentenced to life imprisonment.Dr David Canter has described the techniques he used to pinpoint where therailway rapist lived:2 [../Text/chapter_001.xhtml#ft002]‘Many environmental psychology studies have demonstrated that people formparticular mental maps of the places they use. Each person creates a uniquerepresentation of the place in which he lives, with its own particulardistortions. In the case of John Duffy, journalists recognised his preferencefor committing crimes near railway lines to the extent that they dubbed him the“Railway Rapist”. What neither they nor the police appreciated was that thischaracteristic was likely to be part of his way of thinking about the layout ofLondon, and so was a clue to his own particular mental map. It could thereforebe used to see where the psychological focus of this map was and so specify thearea in which he lived.’By the time John Duffy was arrested in 1986, the techniques of ‘psychologicalprofiling’ had already been in use in America for a decade, and the use of thecomputer had also been recognised as a vital part of the method. A retired LosAngeles detective named Pierce Brooks had pointed out that many serial killersremained unapprehended because they moved from state to state, and that beforethe state police realised they had a multiple killer on their hands, he hadmoved on. The answer obviously lay in linking up the computers of individualstates, and feeding the information into a central computer. Brooks’s programmewas labelled VICAP – the Violent Criminal Apprehension Programme – and the FBIAcademy at Quantico, Virginia, was chosen as the centre for the newcrimefighting team. VICAP proved to be the first major step towards the solutionof the problem of the random sex killer.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/chapter_001.xhtml#fn001] For a more detailed account of the historyof crime detection, see Written in Blood: A History of Forensic Detection, ColinWilson, 1989.2 [../Text/chapter_001.xhtml#fn002] New Society, 4 March 1988"},{"pageContent":"TwoProfile of a Serial KillerUP TO THE time this book went to press, no defendant facing charges of multiplemurder in any British court had ever been described in proceedings as a ‘serialkiller’, or his alleged crimes as ‘serial murder’. No such classificationobtains either in British legal terminology or, indeed, in everydayconversation.Even now, despite increasing use of the term in media reports, it is doubtful ifone layman in a hundred in Britain knows what distinguishes the serial killerfrom all other multiple murderers. That is certainly not because none are to befound in the annals of British crime; on the contrary. The reason is that theiridentification and acceptance as a unique species of murderer is new, so newthat outside the United States – the country worst affected by these mostdangerous of all killers – the civilised world is only just waking up to thethreat they pose to society.Paradoxically, the man generally regarded as the archetypal serial killer isalso the world’s most notorious murderer: Jack the Ripper. ‘The Ripper’ – theonly name by which we know him, for he was never caught – stalked and mutilatedhis victims in the gas-lit alleys of London’s East End more than one hundredyears ago. How many women he killed during that brief reign of autumn terror in1888 is uncertain. Four, perhaps five; by no means an exceptional tally in thecontext of the violent 1980s, yet nonetheless a series of murders which continueto excite worldwide interest – fascination, even – both because of theirsavagery, and persistent conjecture as to the identity of the Ripper and hisfate.While his identity may never now be satisfactorily established, modern criminalprofiling techniques enable us to discern a clearly identifiable pattern in thefive Ripper murders. Their significant behavioural thread lies not so much inthe modus operandi which governed all five homicides – the ‘pick-up’, followedby the slitting of the victim’s throat – as in the post-mortem mutilation whichaccompanied four of the murders (the Ripper was disturbed during the course ofthe other one).Such a ritual, sexually sadistic trait is a hallmark of a certain kind of serialkiller. The modus operandi may vary over time; it is chosen basically because itis practical – and because it works. Changes may be introduced should some flawemerge (perhaps during the early murders, which do not always proceed to plan),or even deliberately to try to confuse the investigating police. The ritualaspect of the crime, however – which is conceived of fantasy, and endlesslyrehearsed in the offender’s mind before he kills for the first time – is his‘signature’, his mark; and it is principally this ‘signature’ which enables aseries of crimes to be linked through behavioural analysis.The most advanced, systematic profiling technique in use today – the CriminalInvestigative Analysis Programme, devised and developed by agents of the FBI’sBehavioural Science Unit at Quantico, Virginia – is based on the tenet thatbehaviour reflects personality. Thus, expert crime scene interpretation (basedon police and medical reports, photographic and forensic evidence, etc.),translated into identifiable behavioural characteristics, enables the FBIanalyst to profile the type of offender responsible – as distinct from theindividual. Such detailed behavioural analysis is not a theoretical aid tocriminal investigation: it works. It is used every day by FBI analysts atQuantico, and is especially effective when dealing with apparently ‘motiveless’murders (i.e. where there is no apparent connection between murderer andvictim). The same behavioural analysis technique is used to combat a variety ofoffences, notably serial murder but also in cases involving abduction, rape,arson, drug trafficking and certain planned terrorist crimes, such as hijackingand hostage-taking. The scope for expansion would appear to be almost limitless,given time for research; meantime its greatest immediate value in the UnitedStates lies in aiding local law enforcement agencies in the tracking down andarrest of serial offenders.No violent criminal instils a greater sense of fear and outrage among thecommunity than the serial killer. The sadistic nature of his crimes, especiallyin the relatively rare cases involving torture and/or mutilation, inevitablyattracts maximum publicity; while public alarm is further heightened by anawareness that – unlike most other murderers – many serial killers deliberatelytarget total strangers as their victims. The net result is a vicious circle ofever-increasing fear and publicity as each new murder is discovered, all of itcombining to add significantly to existing pressures on the police concerned.However, thwarted from the outset by a lack of clues to the murderer’s identity(a situation aggravated by the apparent absence of any connection betweenassailant and victims), the investigation may drag on for years in the face ofmounting criticism and even hostility. (One recent example in Britain involvedthe six-year-long hunt for Peter Sutcliffe, alias the Yorkshire Ripper, whokilled thirteen women before he was caught in 1981 – and then during a routinepolice patrol check, as mentioned in Chapter 1.)Man’s quest for a composite profile of ‘the murderer’ is not new. Pioneeringwork in the eighteenth century, using physiognomy (the art of judging characterby facial features), and phrenology (the study of cranial bumps and ridges,vis-à-vis the development of mental faculties), failed to reveal significantcommon physical similarities. A more recent, twentieth-century theory held thatchromosomal imbalance (caused by the presence of an additional male, or ‘Y’,chromosome in the genes), increased the probability of violent criminalbehaviour. This supposition, however, was challenged when Richard Speck – theAmerican multiple murderer who killed eight nurses in one night in 1966, and whowas thought to suffer from such an imbalance – was found on examination to haveno extra chromosome. Subsequent research showed that most males with such animbalance display no abnormally violent behaviour. The FBI profilers (oranalysts, as they are officially called) use behavioural traits commonlyidentified in convicted, sexually-oriented murderers as their analyticalmainstay; and that this technique stands the test of time is clearly borne outby scrutiny of the 1888 Ripper murders.All the five Ripper murders were obviously sexually motivated. All five victimswere the same type of person, i.e. prostitutes. All were actively soliciting inthe same general ‘red-light’ area on the nights they met their deaths. Four ofthe murders – those of Mary Ann Nicholls, Annie Chapman, Catherine Eddowes, andMary Jane Kelly – were plainly ritualistic, with post-mortem mutilation.Nicholls was disembowelled. So was Chapman. But, unlike Nicholls (whose robuststays precluded mutilation above the level of the diaphragm), Chapman’s uteruswas cut out and removed, her entrails severed from their mesenteric attachmentsand left draped symbolically over one shoulder. Eddowes was similarly mutilated,except that in her case the left kidney was removed with the uterus. Followingthat murder a letter from someone, claiming to be the killer, referred toanthropophagy (cannibalism), viz. ‘(the kidney) tasted very nise [sic]’.Mary Jane Kelly, the last of the Ripper’s victims and the only one found dead inher room, suffered the most bizarre mutilation. On this one unhurried occasionwhen, having changed his modus operandi, he ran less risk of being disturbed,the Ripper’s mutilation of the body was more elaborate than hitherto. The roommeasured only twelve feet square, so that every detail loomed large. Kelly’sthroat was cut so deep she was all but decapitated, drenching sheets andpalliasse in blood. She was dressed only in her chemise. The rest of her clotheswere found folded on a chair, while other items of female clothing – including askirt and hat – had been burned in the grate, apparently to provide light forthe ritual mutilation.The Ripper cut off the wretched woman’s nose and both breasts, and – as if theywere trophies – displayed them on the bedside table, together with strips offlesh carved from her thighs. Her forehead was flayed, the abdomen ripped open,her uterus and liver cut out. The uterus had vanished: the liver was left forthe police to find, neatly positioned between Mary Jane Kelly’s feet. In afinal, symbolic gesture the Ripper had taken one of the woman’s hands and thrustit deep inside her gaping belly.Only Elizabeth (‘Long Liz’) Stride – the first of his two victims to die on 30September 1888 (hence the night of the ‘double event’) – was spared mutilation.This was not from any sense of compassion on the Ripper’s part, but strictly tosave his own skin. Bruises found on Stride’s shoulders and collarbone indicatedwhere he grabbed hold of her before dragging her to the ground. A single sweepof his knife was enough to sever her windpipe (all five of his victims died inthis way, with their throats slit right to left). On this occasion, however, ashe knelt to rip open Stride’s abdomen, he was disturbed and forced to flee –possibly by the approach of a horse and cart, whose driver (a steward in anearby working men’s club) first discovered the still warm corpse.The Ripper wasted little time in stalking a replacement prostitute victim.Within the hour, and only half-mile away in Mitre Square, Aldgate, he accostedand murdered streetwalker Catherine Eddowes – who ironically had just beenreleased from Commercial Street police station. In the words of ConstableWatkins, the ‘peeler’ who found her body, the crime scene revealed by hisbull’s-eye lantern resembled nothing so much as ‘the slaughter of a pig inmarket’. A curious feature of this murder was that the Ripper placed part of theintestine between her left arm and body.Pathologist Dr F. Gordon Brown commented that the abdominal cuts had ‘probablybeen made by one kneeling between the middle of the body’, and said there hadbeen little or no bleeding since they were inflicted after death. However, KateEddowes had also sustained multiple facial wounds (one of which severed the tipof her nose), while the gash in her throat ran almost from ear to ear. ‘All thevessels in the left side of the neck were severed,’ said Dr Brown, ‘and all thedeeper structures in the throat were divided down to the backbone. Both the leftcarotid artery and jugular vein were opened, death being caused by haemorrhagefrom the cut artery.’Such an attack would undoubtedly have left bloodstains on the Ripper’s hands,cuffs, some outer clothing and, very probably, his boots (elastic-sided bootswere widely worn in 1888). He evidently paused afterwards to wash his hands in asink in the passage north of the Square; the bloodstained water was stillvisible when Major Smith, the acting City Police Commissioner, arrived on thescene. The Ripper’s disciplined conduct in the wake of his earlier streetmurders indicates a calculated awareness of the risks he ran. Each mutilation,carried out at the murder scene, was a ‘high risk’ situation, and he made offfast afterwards with his body-part souvenirs. If that was an obvious precautionto take, his ability always to make his way apparently unnoticed through ill-litstreets and alleyways – burdened by the urgent need of a wash at very least, andmost likely a change of clothing – speaks of methodical advance planning on theRipper’s part.Furthermore, on the night of 30 September 1888, his awareness of the hue and crycertain to follow the discovery earlier of Stride’s body half a mile away wouldhave been doubly acute: this was a time when Ripper-mania was at its height indockland London. And yet – on this one occasion when the ritual mutilation hadbeen denied him – he now took an even greater risk by remaining in the samegeneral area and committing a second murder within the hour. Not content withthat, he also made time to sever and remove the coveted body parts from thissecond victim before attempting to flee: no easy task in any circumstances, onthat darkened strip of pavement where Eddowes was murdered. As Doctor Brownrevealed at the inquest, ‘The left kidney was completely cut out and taken away.The renal artery was cut through three-quarters of an inch . . . the membraneover the uterus was cut through and the womb extracted, leaving a stump of aboutthree-quarters of an inch. The rest of the womb was absent – taken completelyaway from the body, together with some of the ligaments . . .’The conclusion must be that the ritual was of supreme importance to the Ripper.More than that, it was a clamorous, overpowering need, a compulsion, whichoverruled all other considerations that night – personal safety included. Suchcriminal characteristics were so rarely encountered in the late nineteenthcentury as to be wholly incomprehensible to the average police officer, nomatter how experienced. Outside the fictional world of Sherlock Holmes orSergeant Cuff, most investigative thinking then was directed towards far moreelementary criminal motivation.Thanks to the FBI’s criminal investigative technique – based on the behaviouralanalysis of violent crime – the clues which abound in those 1888 murders pointclear as a signpost to the type of person responsible. The main traits so faridentified, i.e. the repetitive, sadistic nature of the crimes; the targeting oneach occasion of an identical kind of ‘stranger’ victim (a prostitute), with allfive murdered in the one general area; and the evident planning behind themurders, from attack to escape, stamp the Ripper unmistakably as a serialkiller.The same research has also established that the serial killer is to a largedegree sexually motivated, and often decides in advance on the type of victim heintends to target (as opposed to specific individuals); so that the crime may bea true ‘stranger murder’ in all respects. (‘Stranger murder’ is a term oftenused by the American press to describe serial killing.) Since the selectiveprocess must turn on the psyche of the murderer concerned, it follows that therange of possible serial murder victims will encompass the whole spectrum ofsociety; from the youngest infant to the aged and infirm, and from the whollyrespectable to the brazenly disreputable.Although his victim may be a random choice, the serial killer may nonethelesshave planned the murder with considerable care. Once decided on the type ofperson he intends to kill, he will possibly stake out a specific locale: ashopping precinct, perhaps, or a school playground, an old folks’ home, asingles bar, a lonely bus stop – or busy main road even, if hitchhikers are histarget – to await or cruise for those victims of opportunity likely to beencountered there. Moreover, before he launches his first attack he is likely tohave methodically reconnoitred the locale – his way in and way out, nearbytraffic lights, roundabouts, one-way streets, any factor likely to impede hisgetaway in an emergency – until satisfied he has a practical escape routeavailable. Such a precaution will be doubly important if the serial killerintends to abduct his victim and dispose of the body elsewhere.Given obvious changes in traffic conditions, the same characteristics mayplainly be seen in the Ripper’s behaviour one hundred years ago. Prostituteswere the type of people he elected to murder, and Whitechapel was the locale hestaked out for victims of opportunity. That he knew his way well through thosegas-lit alleys is self-evident; no matter how close the hue and cry, he gotclean away each time without once being stopped for questioning. Over the years,a number of theories have been expounded as to why the Ripper murdered (women)prostitutes only. Sexual motivation aside, the most popular has always been thathe was some kind of moral avenger: a man who dealt out rough justice to allwhores, because one had infected him (or some close relative) with syphilis. Onthe other hand his twentieth-century counterpart Peter Sutcliffe, alias ‘TheYorkshire Ripper’, who murdered thirteen women over six years on the assumptionall were prostitutes, claimed that a voice from the grave told him that he had aGod-given mission to do so. Sutcliffe had in fact once worked briefly as agrave-digger: however, his plea was rejected by the trial court as a ruse to tryto obtain a lenient sentence.The simplest and perhaps most likely explanation may be that prostitutes havealways presented an easy, and even obvious target for the sexually-motivatedkiller. They symbolise carnality; they actively invite an approach, oftentouting for custom; and no potential ‘high risk’ victim ever risks injury ordeath more readily than by entering the nearest dark alleyway with a totalstranger. Because of widespread poverty, and the influx of workless Irish andEast Europeans into Britain in the late nineteenth century, the Ripper’s chosenkilling ground at Whitechapel was notorious for prostitution. He could guaranteeto find victims of opportunity there on every foray he made: whores were asthick on the ground in the East End at night as were the fleas in theirdoss-house bedding.Hindsight apart, contemporary written evidence exists which appears to confirmthat the Ripper had targeted whores as his intended victims before he committedat least three of the five murders attributed to him. In a letter, thought to begenuine, to the Central News Agency in London and post-marked 27 September 1888(i.e. three days before the ‘double event’, and six weeks before the murder ofMary Jane Kelly), the writer – who signed himself ‘Jack the Ripper’, thuscoining the immortal nickname – declared: ‘I am down on whores and shan’t quitripping them till I do get bucked’.This trait, of first choosing a type of victim to murder and then staking out alikely locale in which to trawl for them, can be identified time and again inthe behaviour of modern serial killers. Dennis Nilsen, the thirty-seven-year-oldhomosexual British civil servant and serial killer, prowled the ‘gay’ bars ofSoho for four years between 1979 and 1983 looking for homeless, vulnerableyouths. His modus operandi was to ply each ‘pick-up’ with drink, offer him a bedand then strangle him with his tie as he slept. Next morning he would eithersecrete the body beneath the floorboards of his home in Muswell Hill, northLondon, or dismember it and dispose of the pieces elsewhere. Each murder leftNilsen ephemerally replete but wholly unmoved, like a spider despatching a fly.He described his reaction after he deposited victim number ten (and third corpseto be dealt with in this way) under the floorboards. ‘That was it. Floorboardsback. Carpets replaced. And back to work at Denmark Street’ (the offices of theManpower Services Commission). Sheer carelessness in disposal of body parts leddirectly to Nilsen’s arrest. His practice was to boil the severed heads, or burnthem with the trunk and limbs on bonfires and flush the lesser remains down thetoilet. Instead he blocked the drains – and was caught.Peter Sutcliffe, the ‘Yorkshire Ripper’, scoured the red-light districts ofBradford, Leeds, Sheffield and elsewhere during a six-year search for victimsprior to his arrest in 1981. Like Jack, he targeted prostitutes: and in thatperiod he intercepted thirteen ‘victims of opportunity’ – by no means all ofwhom were streetwalkers – and killed them all with exceptional violence. Hiscompulsive urge to murder whores led him to presume that every woman heencountered in those areas where he lay in wait was a prostitute: in fact, fiveof the thirteen were respectable passers-by. All were subjected to the samedegree of violence, and most of the bodies were mutilated after death.On one occasion Sutcliffe returned to the murder scene days after the attack,and further mutilated the still-undiscovered body by attempting to sever thehead with a hacksaw. To return to the scene of the crime is a common behaviouralcharacteristic in certain serial killers. They do so for a variety of reasons:to check on the progress (if any) made by the police, to relive the fantasywhich inspired the murder, and to commit acts of further mutilation and/ornecrophilia.Prime importance is placed by FBI analysts on the role of fantasy in serialmurder. Detailed, ongoing research shows that some convicted serial killersenact violent fantasies – including acts of murder – in their minds at seven andeight years of age, occasionally even earlier. These aggressive daydreamscontinue to develop and expand through adolescence into manhood, the age whentheir violent dreams are usually first translated into the physical act ofkilling. (Some serial killers commit murder in their teens. In the next chapterwe discuss one youth who committed four murders by the age of fifteen: pp.129–31, The Profilers.)Serial killers are almost invariably found to have experienced environmentalproblems in their early years. In many cases they stem from a broken home inwhich the parents are divorced or separated, a home with a weak or absentfather-figure and dominant female, sometimes a home-life marked by a lack ofconsistent discipline. As policemen and probation officers have long known, thepsychological damage resulting from such a deprived or miserable childhood alltoo often manifests itself in a number of recognisably aggressive traits. Theyinclude defiance of authority, theft, persistent lying, acts of wilfuldestruction, arson, cruelty to animals and other children; with such symptomsaccompanied by long periods of daydreaming (or fantasising) – thatever-available trapdoor leading into a private, make-believe world where theunhappy young can shape their revenge on society for all ill-treatment, real orimagined.In the context of serial murder, the triad of youthful behaviour most frequentlyseen as indicative of violence ahead is: enuresis (bed wetting) beyond the ageof twelve (although analysts also recognise that there may be several differentreasons for this). Next is arson – sometimes committed by children as young asfive or six. Its long-term significance lies in the type of arson offence. A‘disorganised’ young arsonist is likely to cause smaller fires and leastmonetary damage. In contrast the ‘organised’ arsonist – the one who thinksthings through – usually starts his fires from the outset in occupied buildings.His intention is to hurt people, as well as to inflict maximum monetary damage.The ultimate state of the behavioural triad is cruelty, to animals and otherpeople. ‘We’re not talking here about kicking the dog,’ said one analyst. ‘We’retalking about throwing puppies on to bonfires or tying firecrackers to the cat,that kind of behaviour. One serial killer talks about “Tying a cherry-bomb tothe cat’s leg, lighting it – and blowing the cat’s leg off. Made a lot ofone-legged cats.”’ This trait can be seen in children on both sides of theAtlantic who grew up to be serial killers. Moors murderer Ian Brady won achildhood reputation as an embryo psychopath who threw cats from tenementwindows in the Glasgow Gorbals. When Ed Kemper, the Californian serial killer,was thirteen he cut the family cat into pieces with his Scout’s knife.‘The next step is aggression against people. He chooses animals first becauseanimals can scream, they show fear, they bleed, they do all those things we do –but they’re not people. This time, it’s projection. Now he’s getting even withsociety.’ Hostility to society is one of the hallmarks of the adult serialkiller. Some express it in the murders they commit, others express it in words.We know that the man calling himself Jack the Ripper wrote ‘I am down on whoresand shan’t quit ripping them till I do get buckled’. When actress Sharon Tatebegged the Manson ‘Family’ gang to spare her for the sake of her unborn child,Tex Watson, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel responded by stabbing hersixteen times, inflicting several wounds after her death. Finally Atkins dippeda towel in the actress’s blood and wrote ‘Pig’ on her living-room door. DennisNilsen – a heavy drinker – clearly felt this need to ‘get even’ with society ineach murder he committed – including those he could barely remember nextmorning. While awaiting trial, he wrote from jail to the police who hadquestioned him: ‘God only knows what thoughts go through my mind when it iscaptive within a destructive binge. Maybe the cunning, stalking killer instinctis the only single concentration released from a mind which in that state knowsno morality . . . There is no disputing the fact that I am a violent killerunder certain circumstances. It amazes me that I have no tears for thesevictims. I have no tears for myself or those bereaved by my actions. Am I awicked person, constantly under pressure, who just cannot cope with it, whoescapes to reap revenge against society through a haze of a bottle of spirits?’The same detailed behavioural research which first indentified the importance offantasy in the evolution of the serial killer also examined the part played bypornography. Between 1979 and 1983 agents from the FBI’s Behavioural ScienceUnit conducted an in-depth psychological study of thirty-six convicted,incarcerated sex murderers held in United States prisons nationwide. Of thosethirty-six murderers, twenty-five were serial killers: the other eleven wereeither ‘spree’ killers (a detailed classification of murderers appears in thenext chapter), or single or double sex murderers. Nearly half of those whoco-operated with the FBI analysts (43%) were found to have been sexually abusedin childhood, one third (32%) during adolescence, and a slightly largerpercentage (37%) over the age of eighteen. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most admittedto ‘sexual problems’ as adults. More importantly in the context of pornography,nearly seventy per cent said they felt ‘sexually incompetent’ (as adults), andrelied heavily on visual stimuli – with a large majority rating pornography asthe most effective stimulus.Pornography is seen by analysts of the Behavioural Science Unit as a factorwhich fuels the serial killer’s violent fantasy, rather than as a cause of themurders he commits. In particular they condemn the ‘bondage’ type pornography –so frequently portrayed on the cover of American detective magazines – as thesex stimulus most likely to fuel, say, the Bundy-type murderer’s fantasies.‘That is what appeals most to the sexual sadist. To see a woman who is bound, orrestrained in some way with a gag round her mouth, looking terrified as someonethreatens her with a knife or a gun. That is their fantasy: to dominate andcontrol, to inflict pain and suffering on the victim. To see this portrayed onthe cover of the magazine may fuel that fantasy – but it’s not the cause of themurder (he commits). Such killers have these desires, they have this violenttendency within them, and that’s why they’re attracted to this type ofpornography. We find the sexual sadist and the really violent offender moredrawn to this type of pornography than what one might call “classical”pornography, with its explicit sexual content. What the sexual sadist looks foris dominance, control over the victim, and that’s what he sees in this kind ofmagazine cover. Bundy may have blamed pornography for his “sick obsessions” butthat kind of statement is typical of the serial killer. He always blames someone– or something – else for what he’s done; he is not to blame, it’s never hisfault.’Although the original survey of the thirty-six murderers was completed in 1983,the practice of interviewing convicted offenders by FBI analysts is a valued,ongoing process. No inducement of any kind is offered to the prisoners concerned– some of whom may be on Death Row, awaiting the outcome of their appeals – inreturn for their co-operation. Furthermore, no visitor may carry weapons insideprison for obvious security reasons, with the result that the lone FBI agentswho carried out those pioneer interviews ran considerably personal risk inquestioning convicted, violent murderers who literally had nothing to lose, nomatter how they reacted. That practice ceased after one agent – who conducted asolitary interview with a serial killer weighing close on three hundred pounds(more than twenty-one stone) and standing six feet nine inches tall – rang threetimes in fifteen minutes without response when attempting to alert the prisonstaff that the interview was over. The serial killer (FBI agents do not identifyviolent offenders who co-operate in Behaviour Research Interviews) whose crimesincluded the decapitation of most of his victims, was fully aware of theinterviewer’s dilemma. ‘I could screw your head off and place it on the table togreet the guard,’ he said. The agent bluffed his way through until the warderarrived, and was not harmed; but today all FBI agents work in pairs wheninterviewing violent offenders in jail.Such interviews may last from four to seven hours. One agent talks with theprisoner, while his colleague monitors the conversation. Even so the authoritiesrecognise that there must always be some element of risk involved. Some penalinstitutions require signed waivers ruling out negotiation in the event ofhostage-taking, and/or to release the state from responsibility should death orinjury result from the interview. While neither analyst nor offender may claimto enjoy the experience, it can prove beneficial to both parties – if for vastlydifferent reasons. Some murderers who have admitted their crimes find relief intalking freely about them. Others feel flattered to be included in a work ofreference. Not a few try to impress the interviewer with their innocence. Forthe analyst it is a unique opportunity to meet face to face with an offenderwhose violent, sometimes bizarre crimes are a matter of record: a rare chance toprobe the psyche of the kind of serial murderer he may encounter time and againin the investigative years ahead.With most serial killers except ‘medical serial killers’ (see here[../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_50]), their individual libido is mirrored in thekind of victim they mark down for murder. The heterosexual targets females,homosexuals prey on fellow ‘gays’ and the bisexual serial killer makes nodistinction between male and female victims. Ted Bundy, a heterosexual andformer law student at the University of Washington in Seattle, was a handsomeand intelligent undergraduate who enjoyed normal sexual relationships with anumber of female students before he turned Peeping Tom and, ultimately, one ofthe worst serial killers in United States criminal history.At first, whenever opportunity occurred during the four years in which he was anactive serial killer (he spent half the time in custody, but twice escaped),Bundy scoured university campuses, student rooming houses and youth hostelssearching for ‘look-alike’, attractive female victims. His modus operandi was touse guile, plus his undoubted surface charm, to lure them to a waiting car. Thecar was almost always stolen; in a sudden Jekyll-and-Hyde switch of character hewould club them over the head, abduct and drive them to some lonely spot, thenrape and sexually abuse his victims before strangling them and dumping theirbodies like so much refuse. ‘Throwaways’, he called them contemptuously.After his second escape from custody in 1977, Bundy deteriorated into a drunken,disorganised ‘blitz’ type of serial killer. While he continued to target femalestudents, he now attacked them in a wild ‘overkill’ fashion after breaking in totheir quarters. On the night of his penultimate attack in January 1978, he brokeinto a student rooming house in Tallahassee, Florida, and battered four girlsunconscious. One he raped and strangled. He sexually abused another, who died onher way to hospital. A third girl suffered a fractured skull, and the fourth abroken jaw. Bundy fled. Three weeks later he murdered again, and for the lasttime. His victim was a twelve-year-old schoolgirl whom he abducted, strangledand sexually violated. He was arrested shortly afterwards – not for her murder(the child’s body was not found for a month) – but for firing on a trafficpoliceman who gave chase while Bundy was driving a stolen car. Bundy, who wasusing an assumed name, was identified in custody (the FBI had profiled him) andlater charged with the three Florida murders only. He was tried and foundguilty, and – after a decade of highly-publicised and largely self-conductedappeals – Ted Bundy was executed in 1989.Negro drug pusher, burglar, rapist and heterosexual serial killer Carlton Gary,alias ‘The Stocking Strangler’ of Columbus, Georgia, assaulted, raped andstrangled five elderly white women in Columbus in the late 1970s. His victimswere all complete strangers who lived alone, and whose homes Gary broke into inthe exclusively white Wynnton district of the city. A sixth white woman ofseventy-eight, whom Gary raped when he broke into her Wynnton home immediatelypreceding the fifth murder, escaped death only because she fought him off longenough to sound a burglar alarm and summon the police. Gary escaped, and themurders ceased abruptly in February 1978. Although a native of Columbus, Garyhad moved east in the mid-1970s. After escaping from a New York state prison in1977, he returned to Columbus and committed the Wynnton murders. At that time hewas not a suspect; then in 1979 – a year after the Wynnton murders had ceased –he was arrested elsewhere in Georgia on unrelated charges. After interrogationhe was charged with three of the Wynnton stranglings, together with associatedcounts of rape and burglary. In 1986 he was tried, found guilty and sentenced todeath in the electric chair. Gary, now thirty-seven, is on Death Row awaitingthe outcome of appeals which may not be decided until the early 1990s.One racial criminal behaviour characteristic links the Carlton Gary homicides inColumbus, Georgia, with nine serial murders committed in New York City in 1974by Calvin Jackson – another heterosexual negro ex-convict – and a series of atleast seven murders, committed a decade later and more than four thousand milesaway in Stockwell, South London, by the bisexual British serial killer KennethErskine.By early summer in New York in 1974, five women – mostly elderly – had beenfound dead in their rooms over a period of two years in the run-down Park PlazaHotel at 50 West 77th Street. Foul play was not suspected. All were thought tohave died either from acute alcoholism or (in one case) asphyxia, that mighthave been self-induced. Then Yetta Vishnefsky, who was seventy-nine, was founddead in Room 605. This time no pathologist was needed to establish the cause ofdeath. She had been bound with her own stockings, and knifed in the back: thepost-mortem examination revealed that she had been raped. Shortly afterwardsKate Lewinsohn, who was sixty-five, was found dead in Room 221 with a fracturedskull. She, too, had been raped. And on 8 June Winifred Miller was found burnedto death in her bed in Room 406.While the police investigation into those three murders was continuing, a ninthvictim – sixty-nine-year-old Mrs Pauline Spanierman – was found by a maid,battered to death in her room in the adjacent twelve-storey apartment house at40 West 77th Street. On this occasion there was a suspect; a black man, weighingabout one hundred and forty pounds (ten stone) and five feet seven inches tall,who had been seen making his way down the fire escape at the Park Plaza athalf-past three that morning, approximately the time that Mrs Spanierman wasmurdered. The precise description led the police to Calvin Jackson, anex-convict and former drug addict, who worked at the Park Plaza as a porter –and shared a room there with a woman named Bernice Myers.Jackson (who, it transpired, was also wanted for questioning in connection witha series of murders in Buffalo, New York State) confessed to the nine Park Plazakillings and stood trial in 1976. Psychiatrist Dr Emilia Salanga, one of a groupof mental specialists who considered Jackson to be unfit to plead, told thecourt ‘[Jackson] told me he enjoys killing. He said it was like sex, and that hehad sex with his victims sometimes before and sometimes after he killed them. Hebelieves that his body and mind were being controlled, and he told me he hadthought of seeking out a priest. He thought he was the Devil, and he wantedhimself exorcised.’His confession, which was tape-recorded, appeared to tell a different story: ofa man determined to kill a certain type of woman, with rape a secondary motive.‘When I came in the room, she was scared and offered me some sex. I guess thatwas in hopes I might leave, that I’d be satisfied just to have sex with her.’And with another victim: ‘I lied to her. I told her I was not going to kill her.Then I strangled her with my hands. I made sure she was dead by forcing her facedown into a pillow . . . I think one sock might have been burned off when Istarted the fire in the bed.’ After first returning to the courtroom for aruling on the definition of ‘intentional murder’, the jury returned a verdict ofguilty; and on 6 July 1976 Jackson was sent down for four terms of lifeimprisonment.Kenneth Erskine, who was born of mixed West Indian and Scottish parentage, wasdubbed ‘The Stockwell Strangler’ by the British press after he terrorised theSouth London district of that name for four months in 1986. Between early Apriland late July that year he strangled at least seven old-age pensioners – fourmen and three women, aged from sixty-seven to ninety-four – and sodomised fiveof them in the process. Erskine, who was described by counsel as ‘a killer whoenjoyed killing’, was believed by police to have murdered two other elderlyvictims during the same period, but no charges were preferred through lack ofevidence.Erskine, a slim coffee-coloured man of twenty-four (but said to have a mentalage of only eleven), targeted old folk exclusively. His modus operandi was tobreak in to their flats with great stealth – in one case he squeezed in throughthe cat-flap – and surprise his victims in their sleep. He would then clamp onehand over their mouths and strangle them slowly with the other, by alternatelyincreasing and lessening the pressure on their throats. By offering (andpromptly denying) his old, terrified victims the long-drawn-out hope of life,Erskine heightened the erotic pleasure he derived from the act of murder. Heinvariably tidied up the room afterwards, tucking his naked victims neatly intobed with the sheets drawn up to their chins. Because of their age and inabilityto resist strongly, the bruising on their throats was usually too slight to beobvious to the naked eye. Hence, his first victim – whose body was examined bothby a doctor and a policeman – was wrongly thought to have died in her sleep andwas shortly to be cremated when a relative noticed that the television set wasmissing. (As with the Carlton Gary murders in Columbus, Georgia, and the CalvinJackson homicides in New York City, robbery was Erskine’s secondary motive.)The identifiable racial behaviour link that stamped his crimes – like those ofGary and Jackson – as the work of a coloured man was his sexual assault of theelderly; it is the only sex crime that blacks commit more often than whites.No-one knows why – it is a statistic established by years of patient criminalbehaviour research. Interestingly, the same behavioural research shows that mostserial killers are young, male, and white – again there seems no logical reasonwhy – and most serial killers, regardless of colour, commit their first murderbetween the ages of twenty-five and thirty.One of the earliest known bisexual serial killers was Joseph Vacher, an ex-armycorporal sometimes referred to as ‘The French Ripper’ and a near contemporary.Vacher murdered eleven people in the countryside around Belley, in south-eastFrance (some forty miles from Lyons), between 1894 and 1897, when he wasarrested and later guillotined. His victims were mostly farm workers. Seven werefemales, whose ages ranged from sixteen to fifty-eight; the four males were allyouths of fourteen to sixteen. The murders ceased for a period of six months in1896 when Vacher served a brief prison sentence (for vagrancy), and resumedalmost immediately on his release.Vacher carried a set of knives with him as well as a cudgel, which bore thelegend ‘Mary of Lourdes: who does good, finds good’. He stabbed, raped anddisembowelled the females, and sodomised and castrated each of the youths.Several of the bodies bore the imprints of his teeth. He was caught when heattacked a powerfully-built peasant woman, who fought him off until her familycame to the rescue. Vacher, who was then aged twenty-eight, was a former mentalpatient who had recently been discharged as ‘cured’. At his trial he claimedthat his ‘madness’ dated back to a bite from a rabid dog years earlier. However,he was found guilty of the murder of a shepherd boy (his final victim) andexecuted on New Year’s Eve, 1897.Although serial killers are mostly male, women serial killers have always beenwith us. Two of the earliest-known pre-date Jack the Ripper. Bavariansolicitor’s widow Anna Zwanziger was sentenced to death in 1809 for the murderof two women and a child. Sentence was carried out two years later. HélèneJegard, a Breton peasant, was executed in 1852 for the murder of twenty-threepeople, including her sister. Both killers were arsenic poisoners. As if theneed to kill was an addiction, Zwanziger told the judge it would have beenimpossible for her to cease poisoning others and described the virulent poisonas her ‘truest friend’.In the 1960s a number of young female serial killers were found guilty ofmultiple murder. In Britain in 1966 Myra Hindley and her lover, Ian Brady – theso-called ‘Moors Murderers’ – were jointly charged with three murders, two ofthem of children aged ten and twelve respectively. Brady, a self-confesseddisciple of de Sade, was found guilty of all three murders: Hindley guilty oftwo, and of being an accessory to the third. Such was the sense of publicoutrage it was known as ‘the trial of the century’. The trial judge describedthe pair of them as ‘sadistic killers of the utmost depravity’.In August 1969, four young American women serial killers – Susan Atkins, Lynette‘Squeaky’ Fromme, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie van Houten, all members of thenotorious Manson ‘Family’ gang – took an active part in two apparently‘motiveless’ murders which stunned Los Angeles. In the first, film star SharonTate (then eight months pregnant), three of her friends and a delivery boy wereeither knifed repeatedly or shot dead. Two days later, husband and wife Leno andRosemary LaBianca were first tortured and then stabbed to death. RosemaryLaBianca suffered forty-one knife wounds, her husband twelve – plus fourteen‘puncture’ wounds from a large, double-pronged meat fork. The victims in bothsets of murders were complete strangers to the Manson gang. All four women‘Family’ members were sentenced to death – sentences which were commuted to lifeimprisonment in 1972, after the California Supreme Court voted to abolish thedeath penalty for murder.A newly-identified sub-species of serial murderer has emerged with increasingfrequency in today’s welfare-oriented society, often in institutions caring forthe elderly and infirm – the medical serial killer. This type of multiplemurderer may be male or female, and although clearly less violent than, say, theManson ‘Family’ women or the male, Ripper-style ritual murderers, theseself-styled ‘mercy killers’ consistently claim large numbers of victims beforethey are apprehended.In November 1981, a heavily-moustachioed Los Angeles male night nurse namedRobert Diaz – then aged forty-two, a man who had always wanted to be a doctorbut felt he was too old for medical school – was arrested and charged with themurder of twelve patients by injecting them with massive doses of Lidocaine, apowerful heart drug. It was a case which aroused nationwide concern in theUnited States. In April of that year, a deputy coroner in San Bernadino County,Los Angeles, received an anonymous telephone call from a woman who said nineteenmystery deaths had occurred in two weeks at the Community Hospital of theValleys, near Perris. Police enquiries showed there had been eleven deaths atPerris, and one other at nearby Banning Hospital between 29 March and 25 April1981. The twelve were all hospital patients, aged between fifty-two andninety-five; and all had died suddenly after complaining of dizzy spells orseizures, and were found to have high blood acidity and an unusual blueish tingeto their skin from the waist up.The first break in the investigation came after a doctor at the Perris hospitalreported the disappearance of confidential papers relating to patients in theintensive care unit. Suspicion fell on Diaz; a warrant was obtained, andalthough the search of his home failed to reveal any papers, police found twovials of Lidocaine, a syringe and some morphine. Diaz’s explantion was thatnursing staff often pocketed part-used vials of medicine and later found theyhad taken them home in error.Subsequent enquiries showed that supplies of Lidocaine, stored at Perris andre-submitted to the Chicago manufacturers for tests, in some cases contained anunusually low drug content; while in at least one other instance a vial wasfound to have a far higher Lidocaine content than that stipulated on the label.On 23 November 1981 Diaz was arrested and charged with the twelve murders.District Attorney Thomas Hollenhurst said the charges followed a number ofexhumations, and a study of hospital records, which showed a ‘common plan anddesign’ in the twelve deaths. All had occurred at hospitals where Diaz wasworking at the time. The victims died either during the shift he worked on(usually between lam and 4am) or shortly before 7am, when he went off duty:‘There almost appeared to be a time for dying.’ He also said Diaz had been onduty on ten of the shifts in which patients had died over a twelve-day period.Diaz responded by filing a multimillion dollar suit against the Riverside Countyauthorities, in which he alleged defamation of character and violation of civilrights. His trial for murder, however, went ahead in March 1984. Some witnessestestified that Diaz – who liked to ‘play doctor’ – sometimes predicted the deathof patients whose condition appeared stable; and die they did. Other nurses saidthey had seen him flitting from room to room ‘like a butterfly’ late at night,administering injections which had not been prescribed by a doctor. Diaz himselfdenied injecting any patient with a fatal overdose of Lidocaine, although headmitted he sometimes took on the role of doctor in emergencies ‘because thedoctors on duty did absolutely nothing’.Robert Diaz was born in Gary, Indiana, one of a family of thirteen children. Hejoined the United States Marines when he was eighteen, but deserted and wassubsequently discharged as unsuitable. He lived in a fantasy world and liked tobe called ‘Dr Diaz’ when only a nursing student. He told some of his fellowstudents he had lived an earlier life, in the body of an ancient Egyptian king;with others he purported to be a descendant of ‘El Cid’ – real name RodrigoDiaz, the Spanish knight and folk-hero who defeated the Moors in the eleventhcentury. His motive for murdering the twelve patients seemed obscure, althoughprosecutor Patrick Magers said Diaz committed the crimes ‘for his own amusementand entertainment’ while playing doctor. On 30 March 1984 he was found guilty ofall twelve murders, and sentenced to die in the gas chamber.In March 1983 Dr Arnfinn Nesset was found guilty of murdering twenty-two elderlypatients under his care at the Orkdal Valley nursing home in central Norway. Thedoctor – a mild-looking, bespectacled man of forty-six – killed them all inthree years by injecting curacit into their veins. Curacit is a derivative ofcurare, the vegetable poison which South American Indian tribes paint on thetips of their arrows to kill animals and enemies. (It paralyses the motornerves, including those in the respiratory system, to cause swift but agonisingdeath.)How many unsuspecting elderly patients Dr Nesset murdered in this way isuncertain. He himself told police during the preliminary investigation ‘I’vekilled so many I’m unable to remember them all’. At one stage it was thoughtpossible he might have been responsible for as many as sixty-two suspiciouspatient deaths, dating back to 1962 and the first of three such institutionswhere he had worked. In the event, no post-mortem examinations were made becauseof the difficulty in tracing curacit in the human body with the passage of time;so, once Dr Nesset retracted his alleged confession and the trial began, he wascharged only with the twenty-five murders the prosecution felt it could prove.The patients involved – fourteen women, eleven men – were aged betweensixty-seven and ninety-four. It took the clerk of the court a quarter of an hourto read the lengthy indictment. No fewer than 150 witnesses were called, yet acurious feature of the prosecution case was that none had actually seen Nessetadminister a lethal injection. (A number had seen him alone with patientsshortly before they died, and evidence of injection by hypodermic syringe wasfound on their arms.) The murder enquiry was started when a woman reporter on alocal newspaper became suspicious about the deaths at Orkdal Valley nursinghome, after receiving a tip-off that Dr Nesset had ordered large amounts ofcuracit. Nesset, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, was found guilty oftwenty-two murders and one attempted murder; it took the jury three days toarrive at its multiple verdict. He was also found guilty of five charges offorgery and embezzlement (worth altogether about £1200 sterling, or 2000 USdollars), although this was not suggested as a motive for the killings.No clear motive was established, despite a lengthy police investigation. Theprosecution claimed that under early interrogation, Nesset had suggested avariety of motives – mercy killing, pleasure, ‘schizophrenia coupled withself-assertion’, and a morbid need to kill. Four psychiatrists who examined thedoctor found him sane and accountable for his actions when administering thepoison, but said his emotional development had been ‘disturbed’. They consideredthat Nesset, who was an illegitimate child, felt unwanted and isolated in thetightly-knit rural community on Norway’s west coast where he grew up. They saidthis left him with a marked inferiority complex, and aggressive tendencies whichwere liable to ‘erupt’ in certain circumstances. However, the three judges whoheard the case sentenced Nesset to twenty-one years’ imprisonment – the maximumfor murder under Norwegian law – and up to ten years’ preventive detention. Thetwenty-two murders of which he was found guilty were sufficient to make thedoctor the record mass killer in Scandinavian crime history.In Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1987 nursing attendant Donald Harvey – a dark-haired,handsome man of thirty-five – was sentenced to three consecutive terms of lifeimprisonment after pleading guilty to the murder of twenty-four people in fouryears. Most of them were elderly patients at the Daniel Drake memorial hospitalin the city, where he worked at the time of his arrest.Harvey, who was described in press reports as an ‘avowed’ homosexual, was bornin a quiet rural community in Kentucky. There was nothing in his ordinary,family background to suggest unhappiness or deprivation in childhood. Hisparents were regular Sunday churchgoers who worked hard all year, farmingtobacco. His teacher remembered Harvey as a ‘very attractive child’ who got onwell with everyone. Reactions were much the same when he went to work inCincinnati as a young man; at first all his nursing staff colleagues thought hima gentle, cheerful person incapable of harming anyone.In fact Harvey led a double life for at least four years in Cincinnati.Outwardly he was a pleasant young man ready to do anyone a good turn: the manno-one knew was a mass murderer who ‘talked about killing so matter-of-factlyyou’d think he was talking about going to the chemist, or ordering a sandwich’.He committed his first murder in 1983. On 10 April that year he baked a pie forelderly, ailing Helen Metzger who lived in the flat upstairs and relied upongood-neighbour Harvey for many favours. She thought it a typical kindness – butthe pie was laced with arsenic, and she died (presumably in agony) soonafterwards. Murder was not suspected.During the early 1980s a young man (who knew nothing of Harvey’s double life)moved in to share the apartment. Whether Harvey saw the young man’s parents as achallenge to his own domination of their son is not known; however, he laterconfessed to murdering the father, and attempting to murder the mother, bygiving them meals poisoned with arsenic. Again there was no suspicion of foulplay. According to Hamilton County prosecutor Arthur Ney at Harvey’s trial, theKentucky killer also administered arsenic occasionally to his young flatmate,never enough to kill him, deliberately, but because ‘(Harvey) just wanted to seehim suffer from time to time’.In 1985 Harvey was suspected of stealing body tissues from the VeteransAdministration medical centre in Cincinnati, where he had worked since 1976 as amortuary attendant. No charges were brought: instead he was allowed to ‘resign’– and promptly joined the Daniel Drake memorial hospital as a nursing orderly.As always he made a good first impression. Even his quips ‘I got another onetoday’, whenever a patient died in the ward where he was working – somethingwhich happened with increasing frequency over the next two years – were acceptedas in-jokes for a time: by the time they aroused suspicion, a total oftwenty-one patients had been murdered.On Harvey’s own admission some were poisoned with cyanide, rat poison, arsenicand even hepatitis germs. He suffocated others by drawing a plastic bag overtheir heads, or injected air into their veins to cause blood clots ending inheart failure. In March 1987 a post-mortem on a patient named John Powell, whodied suddenly following admission to the Daniel Drake hospital after a roadaccident, revealed traces of cyanide poison. Harvey, who refused to take alie-detector test, later confessed to the one murder. When a local televisionstation reported that staff at the hospital were concerned about other ‘mystery’deaths there, he confessed to twenty-four murders (including those of twenty-onepatients). Thanks to plea-bargaining, however, he evaded the death sentence.Although a list of the twenty-four names was found behind a picture in Harvey’sflat, the victims themselves were buried after first being embalmed – whichmeant no traces of poison were likely to be found. Furthermore, there was noeye-witness evidence against him: so that without the confession, the case mighthave collapsed. Even so, prosecutor Arthur Ney left the court in no doubt as tohis views: ‘He’s no mercy killer, and he’s not insane. He killed because heliked killing.’ That view was supported by Cincinnati psychologist Dr WaltLippert, who said ‘We expect our killers to look like Frankenstein, [but] it’sall about power. Donald Harvey could hurt these people – watch them die – andthey couldn’t do a thing.’In 1989 nursing sister Michaela Roeder was charged at Wuppertal, West Germany,with the murder of seventeen patients by injection with Catapresan, a drug whichaffects high blood pressure. Public prosecutor Karl-Hermann Majorowsky accusedher of playing ‘mistress of life or death’ over patients in the intensive careunit of St Peter’s Hospital in Wuppertal-Barmen, by her random selection of whoshould live or die. Twenty-eight bodies were exhumed after a nurse claimed tohave seen Sister Roeder injecting a cancer patient with Catapresan. Seventeen ofthe corpses were found to contain traces of the drug. Newspaper reports saidthat even before suspicion was first aroused, Sister Roeder – who denied themurder charges – had been nicknamed ‘The Angel of Death’ by her colleagues,because of the high death rate in the ward. She was alleged by police to haveadmitted involvement in six deaths ‘because she could not bear to see patientssuffer unnecessarily’.On 10 April 1989 Dr Alois Stacher – head of Vienna’s hospital system – told apress conference that four women nurses working at the Lainz Hospital had beencharged with the multiple murder of patients aged between seventy-three andeighty-two, and a warrant issued for the arrest of a fifth nurse. He said the‘bloody murders’, allegedly committed at intervals since 1983, totalled at leastforty-nine – probably the largest number of ‘series murders’ in Europeanhistory. When first interrogated, said Dr Stacher, the nurses claimed the deathswere ‘mercy killings’. He disagreed: ‘These nurses enjoyed killing, because itgave them an extraordinary power over life and death. They killed patients whohad become a nuisance to them, who had angered them or who posed a specialproblem.’The killing rate rose from one patient every three months to one a month andcontinued virtually unnoticed – until a chance remark by an off-duty nurse to award doctor was reported to Dr Stacher, who immediately called in the police.The nurses were alleged to have changed their modus operandi from time to time,to avoid rousing suspicion. The method most frequently used was to drownpatients by forcing water down their throats whilst holding their nostrilsclosed. ‘This is a painful death which leaves virtually no trace,’ said DrStacher. ‘Water in the lungs of an elderly person is considered quite normal.’The nurse named as leader of the death group was said to have confessedpersonally to murdering twenty-two patients in this way. Other methods allegedlyincluded injection of insulin, glucose and sleeping drugs. None of the accusedhad been brought to trial when this book went to press.One twentieth-century poisoner who appeared to be a straight throwback to theAnna Zwanziger type of serial killer (she regarded arsenic as her ‘truestfriend’) was Englishman Graham Young. Young, who was born in 1947, yearnedobsessively for publicity. His mother died when he was only a few months old,and the solitary, intelligent child grew into an adolescent odd-man-out whodisliked society generally and, perversely, transferred his admiration to Hitlerand the Nazis. Another of his early heroes was Dr William Palmer, the Englishmultiple murderer who poisoned his creditors and probably his wife, hismother-in-law, and four of his children before he was hanged in the 1850s.Graham Young began experimenting with poison in 1961 – when he was fourteen – byadministering small doses of antimony tartrate to his family. His elder sisterWinifred suffered considerably from what she thought to be a permanently upsetstomach. In April 1962 Graham Young’s stepmother died. When his father, who wasalso ill and growing steadily weaker, was taken to hospital the doctorsdiagnosed arsenic poisoning. Fifteen-year-old Graham Young was outraged. Hiscomment ‘How ridiculous not to be able to tell the difference between arsenicand antimony poisoning’ aroused immediate suspicion, and he was soon arrested.Vials of antimony tartrate were found on him and he was sent to Broadmoor, theasylum for criminal lunatics. While he was incarcerated there a fellow inmatedied of poisoning, in mysterious circumstances.Young was released after nine years, in February 1971. Far from being cured, hiscompulsion to carry on poisoning was undiminished. A few weeks after he took ajob with a photographic firm at Bovingdon in Hertfordshire, head storekeeper BobEgle began to suffer pains in the back and stomach. Mr Egle died in July 1971.Very soon so many of the staff were suffering from stomach upsets that the term‘Bovingdon bug’ became common parlance. In October the same year anotherstorekeeper, Fred Biggs, fell ill. On 31 October Graham Young noted in his diary‘I have administered a fatal dose of the special compound to F’. Mr Biggs diedthree weeks after he was admitted to hospital, cause unknown. In November 1971two more Bovingdon employees complained of stomach upsets, ‘pins and needles’ intheir feet and found their hair was falling out. Finally a team of doctors wascalled in to try to identify the deadly ‘Bovingdon bug’; whereupon Graham Young,a newcomer to the firm who was forever trying to impress by his knowledge,astonished Dr Robert Hynd, the presiding Medical Officer of Health, by asking ifthe ‘bug’ symptoms were consistent with thallium poisoning. (Thallium, or T1, isa metallic element found in flue dust resulting from the manufacture ofsulphuric acid, and causes gradual paralysis of the nervous system.)Such a question naturally aroused suspicion, and Scotland Yard was asked ifYoung had a criminal record. When his Broadmoor background became known he wasarrested on suspicion of murder. A subsequent search revealed his diary,complete with incriminating entries. At first Young claimed they were notesintended for a novel; but when he was found to have thallium in his possession(intended as a suicide potion if he were caught) he confessed to murdering bothstorekeepers, and was imprisoned for life. His sister Winifred, who had sufferedfor so long at his hands, told of her brother’s ‘craving for publicity, andnotice’ in her book, Obsessive Poisoner. She also said he spoke of lonelinessand feelings of depression when he called on her shortly before his arrest (hereferred to himself as ‘Your friendly neighbourhood Frankenstein’). When shesuggested he should mix more with other people, Young replied, ‘Nothing likethat can help . . . You see, there’s a terrible coldness inside me.’A number of serial killers express similar longings to be important. Some,mistaking fame for notoriety, hope to win acclaim by evading arrest whilecontinuing to commit murder galore. Many genuinely believe they cannot becaught, like Jack the Ripper, and even if mistaken are quick to voice theirsurprise. Kenneth Erskine, alias The Stockwell Strangler, told the police whoarrested him, ‘I wanted to be famous . . . I thought you were never going tocatch me’. After he was jailed for the last time, Ted Bundy expected authorsStephen G. Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth to write their book1[../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#ft001] not about his crimes, but about him: Bundy,the celebrity. Michaud overcame the problem by persuading him to speculate on‘the nature of a person capable of doing what Bundy had been accused of doing’ –which the killer happily did.Paul John Knowles, a young, red-headed American ex-convict who had spent halfhis adult life in jail, was a rapist and serial killer who murdered at leasteighteen people in the four months before he was arrested for the last time, inNovember 1974. He was then twenty-eight. Sandy Fawkes, a visiting British womanjournalist who by chance met Knowles before he was arrested and covered thecourtroom hearing (see here [../Text/chapter_007.xhtml#page_276]), recognisedthis longing to be somebody in Knowles’ evident pride on being interviewed bythe press. ‘He was having his hour of glory . . . He was already being referredto as the most heinous killer in history.’ His hour of glory, as it transpired,was no more than that – almost literally. As Knowles was being transferred thenext day to a maximum-security jail, he succeeded in picking the lock on hishandcuffs and tried to steal the escorting sheriff’s gun. FBI agent Ron Angel,however, was quicker on the draw – and shot Knowles dead.Regardless of the type of serial killer concerned, case histories show that mostprefer to work alone. There are a number of instances of convicted serialkillers working in pairs, but these are a minority group and usually consist ofdominant leader and accomplice. As with the loners, serial killers who work inpairs are usually male: the man-woman team, while not unknown, is rare. A serialkiller ‘pack’ is rarest of all; these too usually have a dominant leader (likeManson). The alleged Lainz Hospital medical ‘pack’ is unique, in that all itsfive first-reported members were female. The eight members of the Manson gangconvicted of the 1969 murders comprised four of each sex: pack leader Manson,Bruce Davis, Clem Grogan and Charles ‘Tex’ Watson, plus females Susan Atkins,Patricia Krenwinkel, Lynette ‘Squeaky’ Fromme and Leslie van Houten. No chargeswere brought against the other two women member of the ‘Family’ – Mary Brunnerand Linda Kasabian – who turned state evidence. On the premise that more thantwo serial killers constitutes a ‘pack’, the Texan homosexual murderer DeanCorll and his two accomplices, teenagers Elmer Wayne Henley and David OwenBrooks, rate among the more notorious. Together they took part in the torture,homosexual rape and murder of some twenty-seven youths in the 1970s. Finally,after Corll ordered Henley to rape and kill a girl of fifteen while Corllsodomised and murdered a male teenager, Henley refused and shot Corll instead.He and Brooks were later imprisoned for life for their part in the previousmurders.Almost all known instances of serial killers working in pairs have occurred inthe United States. They include Patrick Kearney and David Hill, alias ‘TheTrashbag Killers’, who murdered thirty homosexuals in Southern California in thelate 1970s and put their bodies out for collection in bags, as if they werenormal household refuse. Ex-convicts Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole werearrested in Texas in 1983 after a string of murders, of which Lucas was foundguilty of eleven. How many Lucas alone may have committed can only be guesswork:he killed for the first time at fifteen, and was fifty-one when finally arrestedin 1983. Whilst in custody he ‘confessed’ to more than three hundred murders,but withdrew the ‘confession’ later. (In any event it was worthless: like somany serial killers, Lucas was found to be a compulsive liar.)Also in the 1980s Vietnam veteran Leonard Lake and his accomplice, Charles Ng,abducted three women and kept them as their ‘sex slaves’ in a specially-builttorture chamber beneath their cabin near Wisleyville, in Calaveras County,California. The three women were murdered when their captors finally tired ofthem, as were the two young children abducted with their ‘sex slave’ mothers.Seven adult males who were subsequently lured to the cabin were also murdered,robbed and buried there.Two murderers who formed a rare ‘mixed’ pair of serial killers were British –Ian Brady and his mistress Myra Hindley, alias ‘The Moors Murderers’. In 1966they were jointly charged with three murders, two of them the murders ofchildren aged ten and twelve respectively. A unique feature of their trial wasthat Brady and Hindley stood in a dock protected by bulletproof glass, lest anattempt be made on their lives (there was widespread public outrage over thechild murders). Discreetly, the police described the screen as a ‘draughtexcluder’. Brady was found guilty of all three murders, Hindley of two, and ofbeing an accessory to the third. For both, the timing of the trial wasall-important: the death penalty for murder had been abolished just two monthsearlier.The numbers of victims murdered by some lone serial killers are occasionally solarge that the normal mind reels. The grim numerical record is thought to beheld by a thirty-one-year-old Ecuadoran peasant, Pedro Alonzo Lopez. Lopeztargeted young, pre-pubescent girls. Four makeshift graves were disturbed inApril 1980 when a river overflowed its banks near Ambato (south of the capitalQuito, in central Ecuador), and the bodies floated free to raise the alarm.Lopez was arrested shortly afterwards as he tried unsuccessfully to abduct agirl of eleven. He later confessed to killing ‘about’ three hundred and fifty,during the two previous years. In 1986 – again in Ecuador, this time in Quitoitself – a transient Colombian serial killer named Daniel Camargo Barbosaconfessed to murdering seventy-two girls a year earlier, and was jailed forsixteen years (reportedly the maximum penalty under the law).When set against such leviathan totals, the numbers of victims regularlyattributed to lone serial killers elsewhere sound almost respectably few. Infact, they serve only to underline how dangerous the species is. Ted Bundyadmitted to twenty-three murders before he was executed in 1989 in ‘Old Sparky’– criminalese for the electric chair in the state penitentiary at Starke, inFlorida. Most police investigators believe Bundy was ‘good’ for half as manyagain, probably thirty-four murders. John Wayne Gacy, the homosexual serialkiller from Chicago, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1980 for stranglingthirty-three youths. Charles Manson, who was sentenced to death (later commutedto life imprisonment) for nine murders committed in the summer of 1969,privately admitted to thirty-five. When he first heard this Deputy DistrictAttorney Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Manson and his ‘Family’, reckoned sucha total to be ‘sick boasting’: with hindsight, however, he came to think Mansonguilty of understatement.In the 1980s, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported the pending trial ofa man in Vitebsk, Byelorussia (or ‘White Russia’, some three hundred and fiftymiles west of Moscow), charged with murdering thirty-three women. The Tassreport was a rare admission, which served to underline the shock effect ofmultiple murder in communist Russia which, in the days before glasnost, censoredvirtually every public reference to violent crime in the USSR. The numbers ofvictims known to have been murdered by convicted British and European serialkillers tend to be lower than those of their American or Russian counterparts,if equally alarming in the context of lower national average homicide rates.Vacher, the French Ripper, murdered fourteen people. Peter Sutcliffe, theYorkshire Ripper, took thirteen lives. Peter Kürten, the Monster of Düsseldorf,who terrorised the Rhineland in the late 1920s (and is regarded by many assecond only to the Ripper himself in terms of sexually sadistic brutality), wasexecuted for nine murders, although he was probably guilty of more. KennethErskine, the Stockwell Strangler, was convicted of seven murders. Irish-bornJohn Duffy, ex-railwayman and long-term rapist turned serial killer, stood trialat the Old Bailey in 1988 charged with three murders, multiple rape and otheroffences. Duffy was found guilty of two of the murders, and five cases of rape:the judge described him as a ‘predatory animal’, and sentenced him to seventerms of life imprisonment.There are few set rules governing the criminal behaviour of all serial killers.Most commit murder – and will continue to commit murder again and again, for aslong as they remain free – whenever a compulsive urge, an uncontainable frenzytemporarily dormant within them, suddenly erupts and boils over. From thatmoment on the serial killer becomes every whit as lethal as a hired assassin,bent on killing his targeted victim (usually a total stranger) as soon asopportunity presents itself. Whatever potential risk may be involved is unlikelyto serve as a deterrent. For many serial killers the risk will have beencalculated when devising their modus operandi; for others, the greater anelement of risk incurred, the greater the ‘high’ they attain from the act ofkilling.Once in the thrall of this frenzy, the pent-up desires now unleashed will beevery bit as compelling, say, as the drug addict’s need of a ‘fix’. Thedifference is that this need can be assuaged only by murder, all too often themurder of a complete stranger; a type of person known only to the killerhimself, since both the type of victim and the way in which he or she will beput to death will have been conceived in fantasy, perhaps years before theymeet. Not until the fantasy-inspired murder has run its course – possiblyincluding violent assault, abduction, rape, torture and/or mutilation – will thefrenzy abate, and a ‘cooling-off’ period set in.What causes this indeterminate, emotional metamorphosis is uncertain. It may beremorse, or self-disgust even, once the enormity of the offence is fullyrealised. Or it may simply be a passing surfeit of murder and mayhem, with theirinevitable inner tensions. Whatever its mainspring, this unique, emotional breakin the murder cycle sets the serial killer apart from all other multiplemurderers. Dr James Dobson, the American psychologist who spoke at length withTed Bundy on the eve of Bundy’s execution in 1989, was told by Bundy that hefelt remorse only once – after the abduction, rape and murder of his firstvictim, student Lynda Ann Healy. ‘Then the sex frenzy overcame him, and hekilled again: and as each crime passed, he became de-sensitised.’The ‘triggering factor’ which drives the serial killer to commit murder isalmost endless in its variety, yet in the context of the violence of the crimeoften such a trivial thing. The type of victim he kills is always in the mind:conceived in fantasy, possibly years beforehand and uneasily dormant since. Theserial murderer himself is often an ‘underachiever’, an intelligent person (notan Einstein, but still of obvious promise); yet for some reason the potentialhas never been realised. Now, say, he has been sacked. To his mind, it willalways be unfairly; and all the deep-seated hostility he harbours againstsociety now erupts. He seeks out his symbolic victim – and kills. Another serialkiller may have a ‘dominant female’ stress problem. After a blazing row with hiswife/partner/mother he storms out, has a few drinks (or takes drugs), and endsup murdering a ‘stranger’ victim of opportunity: the classictransferred-aggression syndrome. Ed Kemper, an unmarried Californian serialkiller, lived – and quarrelled incessantly with – his divorced, dominant mother.His practice was to behead, and later sexually assault, pretty students (thetype of girl his mother told him he would never be able to date). After one rowtoo many, Kemper turned on his mother – and decapitated her. With some serialkillers, the triggering factor may be partly self-induced. Bundy, for example,blamed pornography for feeding his ‘sick obsessions’. Medical serial killers, onthe other hand, crave the ultimate power (over life and death); and once tasted,their need of it becomes addictive.No matter what emotion may spark off – or terminate – the unique ‘cooling-off’period, its duration can vary considerably in the same serial killer, from onemurder to the next: from an hour, say, to a day, a week, months possibly andeven years. We see this clearly in the irregular timing of the sixteen murdersattributed to the Italian serial killer who became known as ‘The Monster ofFlorence’ (Il Mostro), finally identified in 1993 as a 69-year-old farm labourernamed Pietro Pacciani. ‘The Monster’ haunted lovers’ lanes and holiday campsites near the Tuscan capital in late summer and autumn. He played Peeping Tombefore shooting the couple – the man first, then raping and mutilating the womanin Ripper style – eight couples in all, in 1968, 1974, 1981 (twice), 1982, 1983,1984 and 1985. Like Jack the Ripper, he sent body parts to taunt the police.When a psychiatrist suggested that Il Mostro was a mother’s boy because healways left the breasts intact, he sent the left breast of his next victim tothe investigating magistrate.Pacciani was arrested in January 1993 through a phone tip-off. A bullet embeddedin a post in his garden proved to be fired from the murder weapon, a Beretta,and some of the victims’ belongings were allegedly found in his home. Paccianihad already spent six years in prison for murdering a girlfriend’s lover in1951, and forcing her to have sex beside the corpse. The prosecution paintedPacciani as a brutal man who ‘treated his family like beasts’ and forced inceston his two daughters.But although sentenced to life imprisonment in 1994, he was freed on appeal inFebruary 1996. The public prosecutor, Piero Tony, then tried to reopen the case,alleging that he had a confession from a man he believed to be Pacciani’saccomplice in the crimes, Mario Vanni. Four witnesses who declined to be named(but were called by the prosecutor alpha, beta, gamma and delta) would offerevidence of the guilt of Pacciani and Vanni. But Judge Francisco Ferri declinedto accept this late evidence, and refused to reopen the case. As of thiswriting, Vanni remains in prison but Pacciani remains free.Sexually sadistic serial killers like the Ripper, Vacher, Sutcliffe, Kemper andII Mostro, etc., who torture and/or mutilate their victims, form a minoritysub-species of serial killer known as ‘lust murderers’. The sheer brutality oftheir crimes makes them the most feared of all sex murderers. In 1950, authorand criminologist Dr J. Paul de River said of them in his book, Crime and theSexual Psychopath, ‘The lust murderer usually, after killing his victim,tortures, cuts, maims or slashes the victim in the regions on or about thegenitalia, rectum, breast in the female, and about the neck, throat andbuttocks, as usually these parts contain sexual significance to him and serve assexual stimulus.’Thirty years later, two senior special agents from the Behavioural Science Unitof the FBI at Quantico – Robert R. (‘Roy’) Hazelwood and John E. Douglas – putthe lust killer under their joint behavioural microscope. Both agents werealready vastly experienced in the ways of the serial killer, and are recognisedtoday as authorities on criminal profiling. They describe lust murder as: ‘Oneof the most heinous crimes committed by man. While not a common occurrence, itis one which frightens and arouses the public as does no other crime . . . It isthe authors’ contention that the lust murder is unique, and is distinguishedfrom the sadistic homicide by the involvement of a mutilating attack ordisplacement of the breasts, rectum or genitals. Further, while there are alwaysexceptions, basically two types of individuals commit the lust murder . . . theOrganised Nonsocial and Disorganised Asocial personalities.’Briefly, they define the organised nonsocial lust killer as an egocentric whodislikes people generally, yet is adept at posing as an outwardly warm personfor as long as may be needed to gain his own ends. Behind the façade lies acunning methodical killer who is very much aware of the impact his sort ofmurder will have on society – and commits it for precisely that reason, to shockand offend. Usually he ‘lives some distance from the crime scene and willcruise, looking for a victim’. Like his disorganised, fellow lust killer he‘harbours similar feelings of hostility (to society) but . . . overtly expressesit through aggressive and seemingly senseless acts. Typically, he begins todemonstrate his hostility as he passes through puberty and into adolescence. Hewould be described as a troublemaker and a manipulator of people, concerned onlyfor himself. It is the nonsocial’s aim to get even with society and inflict painand punishment upon others.’In contrast, the disorganised asocial lust killer is a loner. ‘He experiencesdifficulty in negotiating interpersonal relationships and consequently feelsrejected and lonely. He lacks the cunning of the nonsocial type, and commits thecrime in a more frenzied and less methodical manner. The crime is likely to becommitted in close proximity to his residence or place of employment, where hefeels secure and more at ease . . . Family and associates would describe him asa nice, quiet person who keeps himself to himself, but who never quite realisedhis potential. During adolescence he may have engaged in voyeuristic activitiesor the theft of feminine clothing. Such activities serve as a substitute for hisinability to approach women sexually in a mature and confident manner.’Evidence unwittingly revealed by the scene of the crime – such as the locationof the body, the presence or absence of the murder weapon, and probable sequencein which the various criminal acts were performed – may also provide clues tothe type of lust killer at work. ‘Typically, the asocial type leaves the body atthe scene of death, and while the location is not open to the casual observerthere has been no attempt to conceal the body. Conversely, the nonsocial typecommits the murder in a secluded or isolated location, and may later transportit to an area where it is likely to be found. While there is no conscious intentto be arrested, the nonsocial type wants the excitement derived from thepublicity about the body’s discovery and its impact on the victim’s community.’By identifying the sequence of the criminal acts committed in a number of suchmurders – some obvious to the trained, naked eye, others revealed by thepathologist’s report – the two FBI authors established that lust killers usuallymurder their victims ‘shortly following abduction or attack . . . If howeverthere is physical or medical evidence indicating that the victim was subjectedto torture or mutilation prior to death, this factor indicates that theperpetrator is the nonsocial rather than the asocial type.’The two agents also found that few lust killers use a gun to murder theirvictims. Firearms generally are too impersonal a weapon for such sexuallysadistic murderers. To attain the ‘high’ they seek in the fulfilment of theirviolent, fantasy-inspired homicides, most prefer to use their hands moredirectly when despatching their victims. ‘Most frequently death results fromstrangulation, blunt force, or the use of a sharp, pointed instrument . . . Theasocial type is more prone to use a weapon of opportunity and may leave it atthe scene, while the nonsocial type may carry the murder weapon with him andtake it when departing the scene. Therefore the murderer’s choice of weapon andits proximity to the scene can be greatly significant to the investigation.’Even a superficial study of lust murders committed in countries thousands ofmiles from the United States – and in some instances, committed a century ago –reveals numerous behavioural characteristics similar to those noted by the twoFBI authors in their survey. Jack the Ripper slit the throats of his fivevictims, and disembowelled four of them with a sharp, pointed long-bladed knifewhich he took with him on every foray into the streets of Whitechapel. (He didnot leave the knife at any murder scene, nor was it found by the police. Itsdetailed description comes from pathologists, who gave evidence at thesubsequent inquests.) Joseph Vacher carried a whole set of knives with him, plusa cudgel, throughout the three years he was ‘working’ in south-eastern France.They were recovered after his arrest. Similarly Peter Sutcliffe used two knivesand ‘blunt force’ (in his case, a ball-headed hammer) to murder his victims.Thanks to the alertness of the uniformed police sergeant who arrested Sutcliffeon suspicion, both knives and the hammer were recovered next day.Because he targeted two victims simultaneously, even Italy’s ‘Monster ofFlorence’ – one of the few lust killers known to use a gun when committing themurder – may be seen as an exception who proves the rule. II Mostro used his .22pistol to eliminate the main threat (the male victim) at the outset; he thenturned it on the female to silence her before she could raise the alarm. Havingthus established control over the situation, he then attended to the principaltask – the ritual ‘signature’ mutilation – by using a sharp knife to disembowelthe female and remove selected body parts. Californian lust killer Ed Kemper’smodus operandi in the early 1970s was similar in certain respects. Because hetargeted two female students at a time, he carried a gun to shoot them deadbefore transporting the bodies for mutilation (when he used a hunting knife,which he called ‘The General’).Latterday British serial killers (as distinct from lust killers) Dennis Nilsen,Kenneth Erskine, and John Duffy also strangled their victims. So did JohnReginald Halliday Christie, London’s notorious ‘Monster of 10 Rillington Place’,in the 1950s; but none mutilated their victims. Erskine and Christie used theirbare hands: although Christie, who was a necrophiliac, had first to ply hisprostitute victims with drink, and finally render them insensible with coal-gasinhalation before he was physically capable of rape-strangulation. Perhapscoincidentally, the civil servant serial killer Dennis Nilsen used his tie tothrottle his victims. John Duffy, once regarded as a comparatively ‘non-vicious’rapist – only to become a singularly vicious killer – used a stick and length ofstring (or an article of clothing taken from the victim) to form a tourniquet,and so exert immense pressure round the murder victim’s throat.Among the many theories about Jack the Ripper’s lifestyle, perhaps the mostwidely accepted was that he was a doctor. This stemmed largely from the premisethat such precise mutilation, carried out in the dark and aimed at the removalof selected organs from a human body, necessarily required specialist skillswhich could only be acquired in medical school. While never discounting thepossibility, no FBI criminal profiler at Quantico would accept that suppositionper se. Although such murders remain comparatively rare, research shows thattwentieth-century lust killers with no medical training whatsoever sometimesdecapitate their victims, and/or remove arms, legs, feet, hands, breasts,buttocks, genitals, etc. in the course of their fantasy-inspired murders. Theydo so not necessarily to destroy the victim symbolically (though that may applyto some): often the intention is to retain certain body parts, for much the samereason as the big-game hunter mounts the head and antlers taken from his prey,and the lepidopterist pins rare, dead butterflies to his board – as trophies ofthe chase.A few serial killers collect bodies. Christie stripped some of his victimsnaked, and stored them in his kitchen cupboard (in his case as sexual partnersas well as trophies: evidence of sexual intercourse was found in all (three)cupboard corpses). Robert Hansen, the Alaskan baker and big-game enthusiast whohunted his naked prostitute victims through the snow before shooting them dead,was a trophy hunter. As a married man with a family, it would have beenimpossible for him to store human ‘trophies’ at home alongside the elk antlersand bearskins adorning the gun room. Instead, he stole items of paste jewelleryfrom his victims – and hid them in his loft, so that he could relive hisfantasy-inspired murders at will.Jewellery – usually rings, brooches, bracelets and earrings – are commonly takenby serial killers from their victims as ‘souvenirs’, regardless of monetaryvalue; as with Hansen, the motive is gratification. Others collect footwear andclothing, fetish items mostly such as stiletto-heeled shoes, nylon stockings,suspender belts, brassieres and panties. When Scotland Yard detectives searchedJohn Christie’s house in Rillington Place shortly before they arrested him in1953, they discovered some of the more bizarre ‘souvenirs’ collected by anyserial murderer – four sets of pubic hair, neatly waxed, stored in an otherwiseempty pipe-tobacco tin. The sets were never matched to any of the bodies foundon the premises.Some serial killers take video films and/or still pictures of their victims,dead and alive, as ‘souvenirs’ (see Harvey Glatman, pp. 149–52). Police inCalifornia in the 1980s found pornographic ‘snuff’ videos made by Leonard Lakeand Charles Ng as they tortured and abused their three abducted ‘sex slaves’ atWisleyville (see here [../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_60]). Other serial killerstape-record the screams and pleas for mercy uttered by their victims; these,too, are stored and kept for subsequent gratification at will. On Boxing Day1964, the ‘Moors Murderers’ Ian Brady and Myra Hindley tape-recorded the criesof ten-year-old Lesley Ann Downey, as they stripped the child and forced her topose for pornographic pictures shortly before they murdered her. The recording,which was taped to the background music of Christmas carols, was played to thejury at the Moors Murderers’ trial two years later. Although they deniedtorturing the child, the judge said in his summing-up: ‘One will never forgethow the recording started with that fantastic screaming from the girl. What washappening before that screaming, and a woman’s and a child’s voice only werebeing heard?’As well as the torture and mutilation of their victims, and the theft ofjewellery or clothing as souvenirs, some serial killers also practiseanthropophagy. This is not a recent phenomenon; there were written indicationsof cannibalism following the murder of Kate Eddowes in 1888 (see here[../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_35]), and there have been a number of knowncases during the present century. In the early 1920s Karl Denke, who ran aboarding house in Munsterberg, Silesia, murdered at least thirty of his male andfemale lodgers. With rare Teutonic attention to detail he then entered theirnames, deadweight, and date of death in a ledger before pickling the choice cutsin brine, and eating them. Denke committed suicide shortly after his arrest in1921, by hanging himself with his braces.Joachim Kroll, alias ‘The Ruhr Hunter’, murdered some fourteen people over aperiod of seventeen years before his arrest at Duisburg, in West Germany, in1976. Most were women. Kroll, a small, balding man who sported tinted glasses,ate the flesh of five of his younger female victims; three teenagers and twochildren, aged four and five. He was caught eventually, not by any feat ofinvestigative skill but because, like Dennis Nilsen (see here[../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_40]), Kroll blocked the drains. He had a meal ofhuman flesh and vegetables cooking on the stove as police entered his apartment.Possibly the most notorious known flesh eater in sex-crime history was the NewYork painter and decorator, Albert Fish. Fish was a true sadist. Six years afterabducting and murdering a girl of ten, he wrote an anonymous letter to thechild’s mother, admitting the murder, saying ‘how sweet the flesh tasted,roasted in the oven’. As if by poetic justice, a design on the envelope betrayedFish’s whereabouts, and he was caught in 1934 by a dedicated policeman from thecity’s Missing Persons Bureau, who put off retirement for two years to get hisman. Fish, by then a man of sixty-four, confessed to the murder of some fourhundred children over the preceding quarter-century. Unfortunately Fish – likeHenry Lee Lucas (see here [../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_60]) and most serialkillers – was a compulsive liar; but although his overall confession was suspecthe was thought to be responsible for ‘dozens’ of child murders, and was executedby electric chair in 1934. One behavioural characteristic he confirmed was thatwhile mutilation of their victims is common to both categories of lust killer,anthropophagy is indicative of asocial involvement.Special agents Hazelwood and Douglas also established that one of the oldestcrime fiction chestnuts – that the murderer returns to the scene of the crime,like a moth to a candle – is true of both types of lust killer, ‘albeit fordifferent reasons . . . While the asocial type may return to engage in furthermutilation or to relive the experience, the nonsocial type returns to determineif the body has been discovered and to check on the progress of theinvestigation.’ So compelling is the urge of the non-social killer to check onpolice progress that some frequent the bars used by off-duty detectives, eitherto eavesdrop or even intrude on their converstion on some pretext. Ed Kemper(see here [../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_63]) was almost a ‘regular’ at hislocal police haunts. Another serial killer ‘returned to the scene after it hadbeen examined by police laboratory technicians and deposited articles ofclothing worn by the victim on the day she died. In both of two other cases, thekiller visited the cemetery site . . . and left articles belonging to the victimon her grave. Such actions appear to further his “will to power”, or desire tocontrol.’One major riddle bequeathed by Jack the Ripper was why did he cease killing soabruptly after his ritual mutilation of Mary Jane Kelly – victim number five –on the night of 8 November 1888? The two most widely accepted theories are thateither he fled the country to avoid arrest, or that he committed suicide. Thefirst seems unlikely, for a variety of reasons. Despite claims to the contrary,Scotland Yard patently did not have the remotest clue to his identity; it is acase which remains unsolved after more than one hundred years. Furthermore,while murderers of every kind frequently leave a particular area to avoidarrest, statistics show that ‘working’ serial killers rarely cease killing oftheir own volition – and certainly not because they change location. Thereverse, in fact, is often the case: serial killers change location to avoidarrest in order to carry on killing.Ted Bundy is one recent notorious example. Following the hue and cry whichattended his first eight murders in 1974, Bundy moved from Washington (state) toUtah, and later from Utah to Colorado, killing afresh each time; and after heexcaped from jail a second time and moved to Florida, so the murders beganagain. Earle Nelson, alias ‘The Gorilla Killer’ of the 1920s, murderedtwenty-two people (mostly landladies) between February 1926 and June 1927. Hewas on the move all the time, from California to Oregon, down to Iowa, across toNew York state, back to Illinois and across into Canada – where he was caught,and hanged, in 1928. Because it pays serial killers in the United States to betransient (driving from one state into another, which will have separatejurisdiction, automatically lessens the chances of arrest), FBI analysts atQuantico now use computer links via Washington to monitor cases geographically(see here [../Text/chapter_003.xhtml#page_122]). Had the Ripper felt constrainedto quit England in November 1888 for fear of arrest – because of the hue and cry– he would still have been unlikely to be able to resist killing again: homicideis the serial killer’s raison d’être. Furthermore, in an era when the‘signature’ ritual mutilation of a victim was so rare as to bring him lastingnotoriety, it is logical to assume that any new spate of ritual mutilationmurders – no matter where they occurred – would inevitably have attractedmassive publicity.Suicide is indeed a possibility, although perhaps less likely than may besupposed. Modern research shows us that serial killers rarely take their ownlives; one possible reason being that the majority tend to ‘externalise’ (i.e.to blame others – not excluding the victim – for their crimes) rather than admitresponsibility themselves. We have evidence of that from statements made byconvicted offenders. Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen told the investigatingpolice he would never have harmed his victims had they not been prostitutes.‘I’m not saying I hate all women, I don’t. I’d do everything in my power, anyway, shape or form for [a good woman] and to see no harm ever came to her, but Iguess prostitutes are women I’m putting down as lower than myself . . . It’slike it was a game, they had to pitch the bail before I could bat.’ Ed Kemper,the giant Californian who decapitated his mother (whom he abhorred), blamed herfor the murders of his several female student victims. ‘Those girls are deadbecause of the way that mother raised her son,’ he would say, as if he himselfwere another person. After beheading his mother, he cut out her larynx (asymbolic gesture, to signify that she could never nag him again), and threw itin the garbage disposal machine. When he switched on, the machine malfunctionedand the larynx flew up out again. ‘Even when she was dead, she was stillbitching at me,’ Kemper complained. ‘I couldn’t get her to shut up!’The lone exception to the ‘externalisation’ thought process is sometimes found –in the ranks of the lust killer, a category of serial killer which certainlyincludes Jack the Ripper. However, in their 1980 survey (see here)[../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_64] FBI agents Hazelwood and Douglas say ‘Seldomdoes the lust killer come from an environment of love and understanding. It ismore likely that he was an abused or neglected child who experienced a greatdeal of conflict in his early life and was unable to develop and use adequatecoping devices. Had he been able to do so, he would have withstood the stressesplaced upon him and developed normally in early childhood . . . These stresses,frustrations and subsequent anxieties, along with the inability to cope withthem, may lead the individual to withdraw from the society which he perceives ashostile and threatening.‘Through this internalisation process, he becomes secluded and isolated fromothers and may eventually select suicide as an alternative to a life ofloneliness and frustration. The authors have designated this reaction to life asdisorganised asocial.’ Whether the Ripper belonged to this category is unclear.Perversely, he exhibited certain behavioural characteristics which could fitboth types of lust killer. For example the location of the bodies (all leftwhere they were murdered), clear evidence of post-mortem mutilation, and theindication of anthropophagy which followed the murder of Kate Eddowes, all pointto the disorganised asocial type. Similarly, the absence of clues at the sceneof the crime (notably the Ripper’s removal of the murder weapon), and subsequentletters to the Central News Agency (as if to involve himself in theinvestigation), suggest the more calculating organised non-social type.In itself, this is not unusual: FBI analysts at Quantico frequently encounterserial killers who display ‘mixed’ organised and disorganised characteristics.By carefully weighing all the available evidence – police report, results offorensic tests, pathologist’s report, crime scene photographs, etc. – they stillproduce an accurate profile of the type of offender responsible. Pathologists’reports aside, little else of analytical value is available today on the Jackthe Ripper murders, for nineteenth-century police investigators had nospecialised technique for analysing such apparently ‘motiveless’ murders.Ongoing, modern research suggests there could well be a third, entirely feasibleexplanation for the abrupt cessation of the Victorian serial murders; that theRipper may have been arrested and jailed for some unrelated offence aftermurdering Mary Jane Kelly in November 1988, and thus removed from societyinvoluntarily. This is frequently found to be the case in the United Stateswhenever a series of violent crimes (rape as well as murder) ceases abruptly,without the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible. Forexample, the ‘Boston Strangler’ committed the first of his thirteen murders on14 June 1962. His victim was Anna Slesers, a fifty-five-year-old seamstress.Victim number thirteen died on 4 January 1964. She was Mary Sullivan, a studentof nineteen who was working her way through night school. Her murder reduced thecity of Boston to near panic, as the police searched in vain for the unknownkiller and the manhunt entered its third calendar year. Then in February 1965 aman named Albert DeSalvo – detained at the time in a Boston mental institution,awaiting trial on charges not immediately connected with the murder inquiries –began boasting incessantly to other inmates about his sexual exploits. Among hiscaptive audience was George Nassar, a schizophrenic who himself faced charges offirst-degree murder.It suddenly dawned on Nassar that DeSalvo was Boston’s most wanted man. He toldhis lawyer, the remarkable F. Lee Bailey, who also represented DeSalvo after heconfessed to being the Strangler. Ironically, when DeSalvo was jailed for lifein 1967, he was removed from society permanently: within six years he wasstabbed to death by an unknown fellow prisoner. (See Albert DeSalvo, alias theBoston Strangler pp. 206–18).Similarly the Manson gang was arrested in the autumn of 1969 only after ‘Family’member Susan Atkins – by then in custody on an unrelated charge – told acellmate about her involvement in the Sharon Tate murders. The Hollywood murderswere front-page news, the information immensely valuable to any remand prisonerhoping to bargain for her release; and as soon as it filtered back to the LosAngeles police department, Susan Atkins’ accomplices were quickly rounded up andthe whole gang brought to trial.Many serial killers habitually commit offences other than homicide – CarltonGary was also a burglar, Ted Bundy a car thief, Robert Hansen an obsessionalshoplifter. As a result, when a run of violent serial crimes ends suddenlywithout the arrest of a suspect, the investigating law enforcement officers inthe United States do not automatically regard suicide as a likely reason.Statistics show that such offenders are usually: one, in custody for someunrelated offence, or two, have left the area because the publicity generated bytheir murders has made them increasingly nervous of arrest. When this happens,the move will probably have been planned to avoid arousing suspicion – bychanging jobs, perhaps, or joining the armed forces. Should a cycle of similarviolent crimes suddenly start up elsewhere, they will – once reported to the FBIat Quantico – be automatically linked to the previous offences by VICAP (seehere) [../Text/chapter_003.xhtml#page_119] the Violent Criminal ApprehensionProgramme databank. If no such new outbreak is reported, the analysts may thenexamine a third possibility; that the suspect has died, either from accident,natural causes – or suicide.Although the 1980s was the decade in which murder and the serial murderer camevery much to the fore, violent crime of every kind had been on the increase inthe United States for years beforehand. A general rise in crimes of violence inthe United States started circa 1963, and with it a sea change in traditionalAmerican habits also manifested itself. Increasingly over the next two decades,and especially in the big cities, it became the accepted practice for manypeople never to open their doors to callers without first vetting them – eitherby voice identification, or via a closed-circuit television screen. In someareas – in Hollywood for example, following the Manson gang murders – the moreaffluent took to hiring private guards and/or dog handlers to provide additionalsecurity; but no matter what precautions were adopted, the national violentcrime graph continued inexorably to rise.By 1980, the country faced the worst crisis in its criminal history. A floodtideof violence – rape, arson, aggravated assault, armed robbery, abduction andstreet mugging – reached record levels, and there was no sign of abatement.Above all 1980 was a year of murder galore. Special agent Roger L. Depue, thenhead of the FBI Behavioural Science Unit’s training and research wing atQuantico (and later Administrator of the newly-formed National Centre for theAnalysis of Violent Crime), painted a grim word picture of America’s entry intothe 1980s. ‘More than 20,000 people were being murdered per year as we enteredthe new decade. The year 1980 itself became a record year, with more than 23,000people becoming victims of homicide. It was unprecedented mayhem. The rates forother serious violent crimes such as aggravated assault, forcible rape, androbbery were equally disturbing. Predatory stranger-to-stranger violent crimewas increasing steadily, while the number of cases cleared by arrest weredecreasing. It was a downward spiral. Something had to be done.’The record total of 23,000-plus murders in 1980 meant that the homicide rate inthe United States had more than doubled since the graph began its upward climbin 1963. It represented an average rate of 63 murders a day, 440 each week,1,900 per month – an orgy of homicide which tarnished the national image abroad,as well as arousing fear and anger at home. In contrast the sum total of murderscommitted in 1980 in Britain – with a population numbering roughly one quarterthat of the United States – was 549.There was no mistaking America’s reaction. Public outrage and alarm, which hadrisen hand-in-hand with each successive upward surge in lawlessness, came to ahead. Now the Administration was compelled to find some way of applying thebrakes; nothing less would suffice. Lois Haight Herrington, who chaired thePresident’s Task Force on Victims of Crime, minced no words when delivering herreport to the White House. ‘Something insidious has happened in America: crimehas made victims of us all. Awareness of its danger affects the way we think,where we live, where we go, what we buy, how we raise our children, and thequality of our lives as we age. The spectre of violent crime and the knowledgethat, without warning, any person can be attacked or crippled, robbed, orkilled, lurks at the fringes of consciousness. Every citizen of this country ismore impoverished, less free, more fearful, and less safe because of the everpresent threat of the criminal. Rather than alter a system that has provenitself incapable of dealing with crime, society has altered itself.’Clearly it had; America was in danger of becoming a fortress society.Fortunately, new techniques to help combat violent crime – particularly theapparently ‘motiveless’ murders which were consistently making the headlines –had already been devised and successfully employed by agents from the FBI’sBehavioural Science Unit at Quantico, Virginia. In essence, these men were‘reading’ the crime scene for behavioural clues which would enable them toprofile the type of offender responsible (as distinct from the individual).Another way in which the new method differed from traditional ‘psychologicalprofiling’ was that this technique of criminal analysis – which combinedbehavioural clues deduced from crime scene evidence, statistical probability,and the intuitive judgement which comes to the investigator from years ofexperience – offered a systematic approach to crime investigation, as opposed toguidance based on the professional assessment of a psychologist or psychiatrist.The idea sprang from hours of two-way discussion between Behavioural ScienceUnit instructors and ‘students’ (many of whom were experienced police officers)attending specialist training courses at the FBI Academy at Quantico. Then asnow, informal exchanges about bizarre or unusual homicides confronting‘students’ in their home areas were constantly encouraged. In time theinstructors – who alone provided the continuity – were able to say to newclasses: ‘We traded ideas recently on a similar case with another class – andthey’ve since made an arrest.’ The lessons learned would then be passed on, andcontact maintained. As other arrests followed, and more and more commonbehavioural traits began to emerge, so the FBI instructors reversed the process– and began to translate crime scene evidence, backed by police reports, autopsyfindings and so on – into positive behavioural characteristics, which enabledthem to build a profile of the type of offender responsible for apparently‘motiveless’ crimes.One important early accomplishment was their ability to identify murderers aseither ‘organised’ or ‘disorganised’ offenders. In itself it provided animmediate, easy to picture, lead to the type of criminal involved: basically,the organised serial killer plans his crimes, whereas the disorganised type ismore of an opportunist. The opportunist is more likely, for instance, to murderhis victim with the nearest weapon to hand – a stone, say – while the organisedkiller usually carries the murder weapon with him (knife, gun, length of rope),plus the restraints he intends to use (gag, handcuffs, etc.). Earlyinvestigations produced failure as well as success. The problem was that thefledgling law enforcement-designed technique of profiling sex killers byorganised and disorganised classification depended over-heavily on investigativeexperience (and often, intuition): further guidelines from within the samebehavioural concept were urgently needed.To this end a second important, related step was taken in the late 1970s toextend the scope of this new profiling technique. FBI agents from theBehavioural Science Unit, together with other agents specially trained for thetask, began carrying out a survey of thirty-six convicted sex murderers held injails throughout the United States. Of these, twenty-five were serial killers.The rest were either single, double or ‘spree’ (see next chapter for homicideclassification) killers. Twenty-four were organised murderers, twelvedisorganised. It was the first time in any country that such a survey – and onthis scale – had been conducted. Given the co-operation of the convicted men(some of whom were on Death Row, see here [../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_43])the potential value of the information available, in terms of criminal behaviouranalysis, was immeasurable.Each FBI interviewer possessed detailed knowledge of the offender’s serialmurders and criminal record overall, from courtroom transcripts, police records,prison, probationary and psychiatric reports. Every scrap of information on thevictims’ background and lifestyle was also collated. What the prison interviewsafforded was a unique opportunity to match established facts with the offender’seye-witness account of all that transpired before, during and after each murderhe had committed. The quest for common behavioural characteristics in both theorganised and disorganised types of serial killer included questions aboutchildhood and adolescence – the all-important ‘rearing environment’ which hadshaped them, first into children who tortured pets or set fire to houses, andfinally into adults who committed fantasy-inspired serial murder. Only such men– some awaiting almost certain execution – could reveal the thinking behindtheir selection of the ‘stranger’ victims (or types of stranger victim) theytargeted, often abducted, almost invariably physically and sexually assaulted,and sometimes tortured before murdering. Only they possessed first-handexperience of the compulsive frenzy (or ‘voices’) which drove them to performeach ‘signed’ mutilation of their victims’ bodies; or could describe the variousphases they passed through in the course of each bizarre murder, and describethe various stratagems they adopted to evade detection and arrest for so long.By any investigative standards, here was priceless material for analysis. TheFBI does not disclose the names of the murderers who took part. However, theinformation they volunteered was sufficient to form an encyclopaedic databankguide to future behavioural analysis; a guide which is continually beingreviewed and extended as new material flows in. (So successful was the originalsurvey that prison interviews of convicted serial killers is now an ongoingprocess.) Even before it was fully completed – in 1983 – enough had been learnedto ensure that no time was wasted when US Attorney General William French Smithcalled on all the agencies of the Justice Department for urgent recommendationson how best to contain and reduce the record 1980 violent crime figures.In November 1982, following a meeting between members of the CriminalPersonality Research Project advisory board (who had instituted the thirty-sixkiller survey) and other specialists, the bold concept of a single NationalCentre for the Analysis of Violent Crime, or NCAVC, was put forward. Thatproposal was unanimously adopted seven months later by a conference of all theinterested parties, held at the Sam Houston University’s Centre for CriminalJustice in Huntsville, Texas. The delegates further agreed that the NCAVC shouldbe founded at the FBI Academy in Quantico, and run by the agents of the eliteBehavioural Science Unit. President Reagan then formally announced itsestablishment on 21 June 1984 when he gave it the primary mission of‘identifying and tracking repeat killers’.The NCAVC was never envisaged as a replacement for traditional crimeinvestigation by local law enforcement agencies: there is no substitute forprompt, on-the-spot investigation by trained police officers. The need for anational centre arose because of the continuing rise in violent crime throughoutthe United States, a situation worsened by the ease with which transient serialoffenders – killers, kidnappers, rapists and arsonists alike – could remain atlarge, simply by crossing the state lines in a country served by numerousindependent jurisdictions. The NCAVC sees its proper role as a clearinghouse-cum-resource centre in the combined national fight against all violentcriminals.That said, the NCAVC is some clearing house. Standards of entry into the FBI areuniformly high, and only agents of exceptional calibre are recruited into thespecialist Behavioural Science Unit. Most of its supervisory special agents (orSSAs) hold at least a Master’s degree. The NCAVC uses the latest advancements incomputer engineering to combat serial violent crime nationwide, including VICAP(the Violent Criminal Apprehension Programme) and PROFILER (another world first:a robot, rule-based expert system programmed to profile serial murderers), bothof which are discussed in detail in the next chapter. Research on new projectsis continuous – the Behavioural Science Unit has long been known as lawenforcement’s ‘Think Tank’ in the United States – and no great vision isrequired to anticipate the further advances which will be made in the comingdecade. Here, surely, is the blueprint crime-fighting centre for every advancednation in the twenty-first century.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#fn001] The Only Living Witness, New York: LindenPress/Simon & Schuster, 1983."},{"pageContent":"ThreeThe ProfilersOVER THE YEARS, the name of one man more than any other – James A. Brussel, M.D.– has become synonymous with the art of psychological profiling. In themid-1950s this spare, pipe-smoking American psychiatrist, with the forte voiceand fund of knowledge concerning errant mankind, profiled the then unknown ‘MadBomber’ of New York with quite superlative accuracy – right down to the way hewould wear the jacket of his double-breasted suit: buttoned. This was after justone meeting with the investigating city police, who had had the Mad Bomber ontheir ‘wanted’ list for sixteen years. James Brussel was that good. Small wonderthe press dubbed him ‘The Sherlock Holmes of the Couch’.For many years no-one knew why the Mad Bomber had declared his one-man war onConsolidated Edison, the firm which supplies New York with electric light. Thecampaign began on 16 November 1940 when a home-made metal pipe bomb was found ona windowsill at the Consolidated Edison plant on West 64th Street. It failed toexplode, but a note wrapped round it left no-one in doubt as to the bomb-maker’sintention. ‘CON EDISON CROOKS – THIS IS FOR YOU’, it said. There were notell-tale fingerprints. In those days, no-one made telephone calls claimingresponsibility. Moreover, there was a real war being fought in Europe, wherecities were being razed by bombs; so, perhaps understandably, the discovery ofone, dud, home-made, explosive device in Manhattan failed to make a line in thepapers. The same lack of publicity attended a second unexploded pipe bomb, foundin the street a few blocks from Consolidated Edison headquarters on the cornerof Irving Place and 14th Street a year later. Within another three months,America herself was at war.Somewhat magnanimously the unknown bomb-maker wrote to New York city policeheadquarters, pledging a truce for the duration. As with all his letters it washand-printed in neat, capital letters, and signed with the initials ‘FP’. Heused hyphens instead of commas and full stops, and old-fashioned phrases(‘dastardly deeds’ was his favourite). ‘I WILL MAKE NO MORE BOMBS FOR THEDURATION OF THE WAR – MY PATRIOTIC FEELINGS HAVE MADE ME DECIDE THIS – LATER IWILL BRING THE CON EDISON TO JUSTICE – THEY WILL PAY FOR THEIR DASTARDLY DEEDS –FP’[.]The ‘Mad Bomber’, as he was later dubbed by the press, kept his word. World WarTwo was long over before the first bomb exploded, on 24 April 1950. It wreckedthe phone booth in which it was planted, outside the New York Public Library onFifth Avenue; by chance, there were no casualties. Over the next six years heplanted bombs in subway lockers, phone booths or holes cut in cinema seats fromBroadway to Brooklyn – fifty-four altogether by his count by March 1956. Anumber of people were injured: again by chance, only a handful seriously. Partof a letter sent by ‘FP’ that month to the New York Herald Tribune warned ‘THESEBOMBINGS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL CON EDISON IS BROUGHT TO JUSTICE – MY LIFE ISDEDICATED TO THIS TASK’[.]On 2 December 1956 he struck again. His most powerful device to date exploded inthe Paramount cinema in Brooklyn injuring seven of the audience, threeseriously. On Boxing Day the Journal-American published an open letter callingon the Mad Bomber to give himself up, while offering him space to air hisgrievances. He rejected the appeal by return of post: ‘PLACING MYSELF IN CUSTODYWOULD BE STUPID – DO NOT INSULT MY INTELLIGENCE’, but clearly welcomed thepublicity, by declaring another bombing truce until mid-January 1957. He alsolisted the fourteen devices he had planted in 1956, several of which had notbeen discovered. A police search uncovered eight. Five were dummies. The restwere armed, but for technical reasons had failed to explode.Still the police did not know where to look, or for whom. Then by responding toa second open letter in the Journal-American on 10 January 1957, the Mad Bomberinadvertently revealed the first clues to his identity. ‘I WAS INJURED ON A JOBAT CONSOLIDATED EDISON PLANT – AS A RESULT I AM ADJUDGED TOTALLY AND PERMANENTLYDISABLED – I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY AID OF ANY KIND FROM COMPANY – THAT I DID NOTPAY MYSELF – WHILE FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE – SECTION 28 CAME UP’[.] Section 28 ofthe New York State Compensation Law requires legal claims to be submitted withintwo years of injury. An immediate search of Consolidated Edison files failed tounearth the complaint which could identify the Mad Bomber. A third appeal by thenewspaper, asking for further details of his injuries, failed to elicit a quickresponse. As the search went on, the police asked Dr Brussel to help them byprofiling the unknown wanted man.While the police had not consulted him before in a criminal investigation, JamesBrussel was no stranger to the world of the criminally insane. Although inprivate practice, he was also assistant commissioner of the New York State’smental health department. He had formerly been assistant director of a mentalhospital. During World War Two he had served in the US army as a seniorneuropsychiatrist, and was recalled in the Korean war as head of theNeuropsychiatric Centre at El Paso, Texas. He knew of the Mad Bomber, of course,from the newspapers. He now listened to the police version, studied photographsof the unexploded bombs and read through a host of letters inked in neat,capital letters. In his loud voice he then delivered the psychological profilewhich has since become legend.The Mad Bomber’s sex? Dr Brussel assumed him to be a man: most bombers are. Thatwas to prove correct, as did his professional diagnosis that the offender’smarathon resentment of Con-Edison, for offences real or imagined – plus histotal disregard for the lives of others when settling old scores – to be theconduct of a man suffering from acute persecution mania: a paranoiac.Correction. A middle-aged paranoiac. Why? Because paranoia usually reaches adangerous stage in patients in their mid-thirties, and this bombing campaigndated back to 1940. Elementary, my dear Watson.To James Brussel, the bundle of letters on his desk, each one meticulouslyprinted in neat, inked capitals to justify the mayhem it portended, denoted aneat, formally polite, yet hugely dangerous, mad author. To his psychiatrist’seye the flowing shape of the ‘w’s, with their pointed tips, represented tokenfemale breasts. Experience had taught him the Oedipus-complex was not uncommonamong paranoiacs. He had learned from the police how the Mad Bomber cut holes incinema seats to plant his bombs. Was this, he wondered, the explanation for thebombing campaign – a sexual problem, sparked off by real or imagined resentmentof male authority in the shape of Consolidated Edison management?Dr Brussel was wrong there. Events showed it to be a straight grudge vendettawith no sexual overtones. In most other respects his profiling was inspired. Hewas certain of one thing; the Mad Bomber was not homosexual. Brussel saw him asa brooding, solitary person of average height and ‘athletic’ build (this last astatistical characteristic of most paranoiacs) who either lived alone or waslooked after by some older, unmarried female relative – an aunt perhaps, or asister. (The police found he lived with two doting, older unmarried sisters.)The stilted phraseology suggested either an immigrant American or – given hisage – one born of immigrant parents who learned the new English language fromVictorian-era books. Brussel decided he was a first-generation American of Slavdescent (Slav because he chose bombs as his weapon), which in turn suggested hemight also be a Roman Catholic. Remarkably, the police found Dr Brussel right onall counts. The Mad Bomber was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1903 of Polishimmigrant stock. Furthermore, he attended mass every Sunday up to the time ofhis arrest.In his protest letters, the Mad Bomber constantly complained of a ‘serious’illness resulting from injuries caused by an accident at work – date unknown,but clearly pre-1940. Wearing his hat as a qualified medical practitioner, JamesBrussel narrowed the list of probable illnesses to three – cancer, tuberculosisand heart disease. He thought, wrongly, it had to be heart disease. Why? Cancerwould almost certainly have killed him by 1957, and tuberculosis could besuccessfully treated. A feasible deduction – yet on this one day when he seemedalmost clairvoyant, Dr Brussel overlooked the one behavioural characteristic heknew better than most: that all paranoiacs think they know far more than meredoctors, and so rarely consult them voluntarily. Subsequent, obligatory medicalexamination showed the Mad Bomber to be suffering from TB.But that is to carp. In almost every other respect his proved to be anear-perfect profile of the unknown, dangerous criminal who had terrified NewYork for more than a decade. All the police lacked was a name – and that wassoon forthcoming. A Consolidated Edison secretary traced the missing file, andhanded it to them. The cover was labelled ‘Metesky, George’. Inside was his 1930address in Waterbury, Connecticut. (He had since moved to a different street,but was quickly located.) There was also a letter from Mr Metesky, complainingabout the company’s ‘dastardly deeds’, while his personnel slip showed him to bea Roman Catholic. For good measure the Journal-American’s third open letter hadreaped dividends too. A hand-printed letter, signed ‘FP’, listed the date of hisaccident at work as 5 September 1931. It matched the date in the firm’s file –the last shred of evidence needed to identify Metesky as the Mad Bomber.He was dressed in pyjamas when the police called, since it was after midnight:none the less he addressed them with formal courtesy. ‘You think I’m the MadBomber, don’t you?’ he said, but did not admit to it: he volunteered theinformation that ‘FP’ stood for ‘Fair Play’, but little more. When the policediscovered his bomb factory (complete with bomb parts, lathe and metal tubing)in the garage behind the house, they allowed Metesky time to dress beforeleading him away. As his two sisters watched and wept, the ‘Mad Bomber’ leftwith shoes a-gleam, his hair neatly brushed, sporting a collar and tie beneathhis blue, double-breasted suit – buttoned, naturally: exactly as the SherlockHolmes of the Couch had pictured him, days earlier.1[../Text/chapter_003.xhtml#ft001]By combining identifiable behavioural characteristics with statisticalprobability, his own considerable professional skills – and no little intuition– James A. Brussel blazed a trail that day for future crime investigation. Yetsuperlatively accurate though his resultant psychological profile proved to be,the technique was not enough in itself to change traditional law enforcementprocedures. It left obvious, inherent problems still to overcome. Chief amongthem was that too much responsibility rested on the professional judgement ofthe consultant. Had Dr Brussel been mistaken the police search for the MadBomber might well have been further delayed, perhaps irrevocably misdirected.Some sort of safety net was needed. But where to look for it? Simply to increasethe number of professional consultants was clearly not the answer.Even the most experienced of mental health consultants are liable to submitopposing views when jointly asked to profile some unknown, violent offender. Aclassic example was provided during the ‘Boston Strangler’ investigation in the1960s. On that occasion Dr Brussel was invited to serve on the distinguishedmedical-psychiatric advisory committee which included six such professionalconsultants. In the event there was a wide divergence of opinion among them, andthe eventual committee report – which found there were two Boston Stranglers,one a homosexual – proved to be completely inaccurate (see Albert DeSalvo, pp.206–18.)That said, the concept of investigating violent crime by behavioural analysiswas clearly a viable one, given the right formula; and the challenge was takenup in the early 1970s by FBI agents from the Behavioural Science Unit atQuantico (see here [../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_76]). The essentialdifference in approach was that instead of attempting to identify an individualoffender via a combination of mental health diagnosis and statisticalprobability, the FBI agents proposed to use their professional analysis of thecrime scene (drawing on police reports, autopsy findings and photographicevidence, in addition to statistical probability), to profile the type ofcriminal responsible. The type of violent offender they had in mind was everybit as difficult to apprehend as any Mad Bomber. Their concern was the sexkillers, some of whom were undoubtedly responsible for the ever-growing numberof apparently motiveless murders being committed nationwide: ‘motiveless’ in thesense that there was no apparent connection between killer and victim.The first investigation in which the new technique was successfully employed wasin 1974. Four FBI agents took part, three of them instructors from Quantico, thefourth a field agent from Montana. Howard D. Teten, an experienced former policeofficer from California and a gifted, natural profiler who joined the FBI in1962, was the senior. Within seven years he was appointed an instructor inapplied criminology at the old National Police Academy in Washington, DC. In1972 he moved on to the newly-formed, replacement FBI National Academy atQuantico, where he introduced the practice of informal discussion of bizarrehome town murders with each incoming student class. Years earlier Teten had madea point of meeting James Brussel to exchange investigative ideas and techniqueswith the man who profiled the Mad Bomber with such uncanny accuracy: theclassroom talks were simply an extension of the same, mutually-educativeprocess. He was joined at Quantico in 1972 by another far-sighted FBIinstructor, Patrick J. Mullany. Mullany, too, was a staunch believer in theclassroom exchanges. ‘The more we did, the more we realised the possibilities.’Their opportunity to put theory into practice came soon enough. In June 1973 aseven-year-old girl named Susan Jaeger from Farmington, Michigan, was abductedfrom a Rocky Mountains campsite in Montana. Sometime in the early hours anintruder slit open her tent with his knife, and overpowered Susan before shecould alert her parents, William and Marietta Jaeger, who slept close by. Oncethe alarm was raised an intensive search failed to reveal any trace of themissing child, or any clue to the identity of her abductor. When the FBI waslater called in, the case was referred to Quantico through agent Pete Dunbar,then stationed in Bozeman, Montana.Combining their own investigative experience with the police report,photographic evidence and Dunbar’s local knowledge, Teten, Mullany and anewly-joined instructor named Robert K. Ressler (also destined to become asenior member of the FBI’s Behavioural Science Unit) employed the new crimeanalysis technique to help track down the abductor. They concluded he was ahomicidal Peeping Tom who lived in the vicinity of the camp – this was a remotearea – and spotted the Jaegers during the course of a periodical, summer’s nightsnoop round the campsite, with Susan Jaeger a victim of opportunity. Statisticspointed to a young, male, white offender (they are almost invariably young men:white because Susan Jaeger was white, and such offences are usuallyintra-racial). The absence of any clues to his identity, the fact that hecarried a knife with him to and from the campsite and made off with his victimwithout any alarm being raised, indicated an organised violent criminal.Sexually motivated murder frequently occurs at an early age, yet this was notthe handiwork of some frenzied teenager. This bore the stamp of an older person,perhaps in his twenties. Statistical probability made him a loner, of average orpossibly above average intelligence. Gradually the three instructors fittedtogether each piece of the behavioural jigsaw puzzle. The length of time thegirl had been missing without word – and no sign of a ransom demand – persuadedthem Susan Jaeger had been murdered. They thought it likely her abductor wasthat comparatively rare type of sex killer who mutilates his victims after death– sometimes to remove body parts as ‘souvenirs’ (see here[../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_64]).Early on in the investigation an informant contacted FBI agent Dunbar with thename of a possible suspect – David Meirhofer, a local, twenty-three-year-old,single man who had served in Vietnam, By chance Dunbar knew Meirhofer, whoseemed a quiet, intelligent person. More important, there was no known evidenceto connect him with the abduction. Then in January 1974, the charred body of aneighteen-year-old girl was found in nearby woodland. She had known Meirhofer,but avoided his company; otherwise there was no known circumstance to connecthim with the crime. Inevitably, however, he became a possible suspect for thesecond time: but on this occasion David Meirhofer volunteered to undergo both alie-detector test and interrogation after injection with the so-called ‘truthserum’ (sodium pentathol) to prove his innocence. He passed both tests soconvincingly that Dunbar felt compelled to believe him.Not so the Quantico profilers. Experience had taught them how some sex killersdeliberately seek ways of inserting themselves into an investigation, if only tofind out how much the authorities know. As a precaution, they advised SusanJaeger’s parents to keep a tape-recorder by their telephone. On the firstanniversary of their daughter’s disappearance, an anonymous male caller rangtheir home in Farmington and boasted to Mrs Jaeger that he was keeping Susanalive, and prisoner. Instead of upbraiding him, Mrs Jaeger responded gently: andby turning the other cheek reduced her anonymous caller to tears. Analysis ofthe tape identified the voice as Meirhofer’s. However, such unsupportedidentification was then insufficient under Montana law to obtain a warrant tosearch Meirhofer’s apartment, where the profilers believed he kept the‘souvenirs’ which would tie him to Susan’s murder, and possibly that of theeighteen-year-old.The answer was supplied by FBI instructor Mullany. He reasoned that if MrsJaeger could reduce David Meirhofer to tears by telephone, a face-to-facemeeting might prove even more rewarding. Such a step called for fortitude on theparents’ part, but William Jaeger escorted his wife to Montana where she metMeirhofer in his lawyer’s office. He appeared totally controlled, and saidnothing to incriminate himself. The Jaegers returned home, thinking the plan hadfailed; but they were wrong. Shortly afterwards they received another phone call– this time from Salt Lake City, Utah, some four hundred miles south of Bozeman– from a man calling himself ‘Mr Travis’. He told Mrs Jaeger that he was the manwho abducted her daughter – but she recognised the voice, and called his bluff.‘Hello, David’, she said.Backed now by Mrs Jaeger’s sworn affidavit, FBI agent Dunbar in Bozeman obtainedhis search warrant. As the Quantico profilers had predicted, he unearthed the‘souvenirs’ – body parts, taken from both victims – which proved Meirhofer’sguilt. At that, the man who had passed both ‘truth tests’ so convincingly alsoconfessed to two more unsolved murders (of local boys). Although he was notbrought to trial – David Meirhofer hanged himself in his cell – he became thefirst serial killer to be caught with the aid of the FBI’s new investigativetechnique. It was a breakthrough which, within a decade, was to lead directly tothe accurate, systematic profiling technique known as the ‘CriminalInvestigative Analysis Programme’, or CIAP – which today forms the NCAVC’s mainweapon in the fight against these elusive, predatory serial offenders.Under the stewardship of Howard Teten and Patrick Mullany (both of whom havesince left the FBI), new names began to emerge during the 1970s as expertBehavioural Science Unit profilers in their own right. Among them were specialagents Robert ‘Roy’ Hazelwood, now a leading authority on serial violent crimeinvolving sexual assault; Robert Ressler, the then newly-joined instructor whohad won his spurs in the pioneer Meirhofer case, and John E. Douglas. JohnDouglas, a strapping, stylishly-dressed man now in his mid-forties, wasrecruited into the FBI as a graduate from Wisconsin State University. LikeHoward Teten, Douglas showed a natural aptitude for profiling; and within sixyears, while still in his twenties, he was posted to the crack FBI BehaviouralScience Unit at Quantico.He and Robert Ressler spent long hours of off-duty time in the latter part ofthe 1970s interviewing convicted sex murderers, thereby amassing a stockpile ofcommon behavioural characteristics to feed back into the ever-expanding criminalprofiling programme. In earlier years Teten, Mullany and the giants of the pasthad been forced to rely too much on personal investigative experience tosupplement crime scene analysis, and so focus each new search for the type ofoffender responsible. Now the newcomers took this hitherto untried ‘short cut’(of prison interviews) to build on the infant organised/disorganised findings.They sought subject material in whichever states they happened to be working atthe time, and persuaded the interviewees to help solve such riddles as why somekillers deliberately hide the bodies of their victims, while others just asdeliberately leave them to be found by passers-by whose immediate reaction is toinform the police, and so raise the alarm.The appalling injuries inflicted by some of the prisoners on their victims wasalready a matter of medical record. What the FBI agents now sought to discoverwas what caused the offenders to dismember, or ‘depersonalise’ these victims(beat them until their faces were unrecognisable) – many of them total strangersuntil the moment of the attack? Had the prisoners themselves been sexuallyabused as children or adolescents? Were they incapable of normal sex? Didpornography ‘turn them on’? What did their bizarre acts of mutilation mean tothe killer who ‘signed’ all his homicides in this way? Why did some offenderstorture live victims, and others mutilate them only after death?All of it was interrogation with intent: the aim was to identify commonbehavioural characteristics peculiar to certain types of murderer. But they wereall ‘gut’ questions, which needed to be put with rare tact. It was the firsttime that law enforcement officers had attempted to ‘read’ every facet of someparticularly brutal murder through the eyes of the criminal responsible.Furthermore – as so often occurs in instances of unconventional research – theinterviews were ‘unofficial’. Had there been any adverse reaction by way oflegal complaint, say, or prison incident, the consequences for the pioneerresearchers concerned could have been disastrous. Patrick Mullany (who becamemanager of corporate security with the oil giant, Occidental Petroleum, afterleaving the FBI) was quoted in a 1989 newspaper interview as saying that theseunofficial interviews ‘had the potential to crack back and hurt them badlycareer-wise’.Fortunately, none did. The information gained from those early interviews was toprove invaluable, particularly in so-called ‘motiveless’ murder cases (i.e.where there is no apparent connection between murderer and victim). A convincingearly demonstration of its importance in this field was afforded in 1979, duringthe manhunt in New York City for the killer of schoolteacher Francine Elveson.Miss Elveson – a tiny four-feet-eleven-inches, twenty-six-year-old Plain Janewho suffered from a slight curvature of the spine – was found naked, badlybeaten about the head and face and with her body mutilated, spreadeagled on theroof of the Pelham Parkway Houses apartment building in the Bronx where shelived with her parents. So severe was the physical assault that her jaw and nosewere both broken, and the teeth in her head pounded loose. Her nylon stockingswere loosely tied round her wrists and ankles, even though no restraint had beenneeded: she was unconscious, or already dead, when that was done. Her pants hadbeen tugged over her head, hiding her battered features from view. There weretoothmarks visible on her thighs and knees.Using a pen taken from her handbag, her killer had scrawled a challenge to thepolice on one thigh: ‘You can’t stop me’. On her stomach it was four-letterabuse: ‘Fuck you’. Both the pen and the dead teacher’s umbrella were foundthrust into her vagina, and her comb (also taken from the handbag) wedged in herpubic hair. Her pierced earrings had been removed from the lobes, and placed oneither side of her head. Both breasts were mutilated, by cutting off each nippleand placing it back on the chest. There were no deep knife wounds: thissuggested the killer had used a small weapon – a penknife, probably – and takenit with him. A pendant which the victim habitually wore, manufactured in theshape of a Jewish good luck sign (Chai), was missing – presumably taken by herassailant. Now the dead woman’s limbs were arranged in the shape of the pendant,as if to form a replica.Francine Elveson was attacked within minutes of leaving her parents’apartment-house flat shortly after 6.30 a.m. on 12 October 1979. Her body wasfound on the roof some eight hours later, after she failed to arrive at theschool for handicapped children where she taught. The police report showed theattack took place as she made her way downstairs, when she was batteredunconscious and carried up to the roof for the ritual that followed. Medicalevidence revealed that she had not been raped. The cause of death wasstrangulation; she had in fact been twice strangled, manually first and thenwith the strap of her handbag. Lack of forensic evidence – fragments of skintissue, fibres, etc. – under her fingernails indicated that she had made noattempt to fight off her assailant. Traces of semen were found on her body, butgenetic fingerprinting was then unknown, 2 [../Text/chapter_003.xhtml#ft002] sothat there were no apparent clues to the identity of her murderer.Because of its bizarre features the case attracted much publicity, but despiteintensive police investigation which included questioning some 2,000 people,checking on known sex offenders and patients undergoing treatment in mentalhospitals, the search for Miss Elveson’s killer became bogged down. Finally inNovember 1979 the FBI was called in. Even the police investigators thought theywere on a hiding to nothing. One experienced murder squad detective was quotedas saying, ‘Frankly I didn’t see where the FBI could tell us anything, but Ifigured there was no harm in trying’. Crime scene photographs, together with thepolice report, autopsy findings, etc., were duly forwarded to the FBI’sBehavioural Science Unit for analysis.Enter special agent John Douglas, to profile the type of person responsible –from his desk at Quantico, some three hundred miles away. He knew from thepolice report that Miss Elveson, who was self-conscious about her size andphysical deformity, had no boyfriends. That ruled out a lovers’ quarrel.Moreover it was spontaneous choice which led her to leave for work that morningvia the stairs, rather than use the elevator. Those two factors meant it was achance encounter between victim and murderer – yet an encounter with someone whopromptly spent a long time on the roof mauling his victim in broad daylight. ToJohn Douglas that meant he was no stranger to the building; he knew its routinewell enough to feel confident he would not be disturbed during the ritualmutilation murder that ensued.Again, the fact that he was in the building at that hour suggested someone whomight live, or perhaps work there. And Miss Elveson – this shy, almost reclusiveyoung woman who shunned men because of her appearance – had neither screamed normade any apparent attempt to ward off a man who suddenly lashed out as theypassed on the stairs. It had to mean that either he was someone she knew, ifonly by sight, or who was wearing an identifiable uniform – postman, say, orjanitor – whom she believed she had no reason to fear.The offender left ‘mixed’ crime scene characteristics, as many sex killers do.He used restraints (organised), yet left the body in full view (disorganised).He ‘depersonalised’ his victim (disorganised), yet having mutilated her bodytook the knife with him (organised). On balance, however, John Douglasclassified him as a ‘disorganised’ offender, acting out a fantasy ritual whichhad probably been inspired earlier by a bondage article and/or sketches in somepornographic magazine. The FBI agent profiled him as white (Francine Elveson waswhite), male, of roughly her age (say between twenty-five and thirty-five), andof average appearance, i.e. who would not seem in any way out of character inthe apartment building environment. Statistics pointed to a school ‘dropout’type, possibly now unemployed. Because of the time at which it happened, thecrime seemed unlikely to be either drink or drug-related. Francine Elveson’skiller was a man who found it difficult to behave naturally with women, and wasalmost certainly sexually inadequate. (The ritual mutilation provided thegratification he craved – a fact borne out by forensic evidence, which revealedtraces of semen on the body.) He was the type of sex offender who would keep apornography collection, while his sadistic behaviour pointed to one with mentalproblems.He left the body in view because he wanted it to shock and offend. That decisionwas part and parcel of his implied challenge to the police, inked on thevictim’s thigh – ‘You can’t stop me’. It ws a challenge which John Douglasbelieved meant he was liable to kill again, should opportunity arise. Hisprofile stressed the importance of the attacker’s prior knowledge of theapartment building where the victim lived – and her apparent lack of alarm asthey met on the stairs. Once the answer to these two, connected factors wasfound, the rest of the puzzle would slot into place.Armed with the profile, the investigating police re-examined their list ofsuspects. One man in particular seemed to fit the description like a glove. Hisname was Carmine Calabro. He was thirty years old, an unmarried, out-of-workactor; an only child, and former high-school dropout with a history of mentalillness. He had no girlfriends. He himself did not live in the apartmentbuilding where Francine was found murdered, but his father – whom he oftenvisited – lived there and was a near-neighbour of the Elvesons. The problem wasthat it seemed impossible for Carmine Calabro to be the killer.The police had interviewed Calabro’s father (as they had every other resident inthe complex) before calling on the FBI for help. The father told them that hisson – who lived elsewhere, and alone – was an in-patient undergoing psychiatrictreatment at a local mental hospital, which appeared to rule him out as apossible suspect. Now enquiries were redoubled, and the police discovered that –because security was lax – patients at the hospital concerned were able toabsent themselves almost at will. When they learned that Carmine Calabro wasabsent without permission on the evening before Francine Elveson was murdered,he was arrested – thirteen months after the body had been found.Carmine Calabro pleded not guilty to the murder at his trial. However, theevidence given by three forensic (dental) experts – whose independent testsshowed that impressions from Calabro’s teeth matched the bite marks on the deadteacher’s thigh – proved conclusive, and he was imprisoned for twenty-five yearsto life. The police had got their man, but this had been a further, impressivedemonstration of the value of the FBI’s behavioural analysis technique when thelaw enforcement agencies are confronted by an apparently motiveless murder.Above all, it had been a virtuoso performance by special agent John Douglas,whose startling accuracy of profiling matched that of the legendary James A.Brussel in the case of the Mad Bomber twenty-two years earlier. Aptly, one ofthe warmest tributes came from the head of the police task force assigned to theElveson murder investigtion, Lieutenant Joseph D’Amico. ‘They had [CarmineCalabro] so right’ he said, ‘that I asked the FBI why they hadn’t given us hisphone number too.’Official recognition of the importance of the FBI’s new investigative techniquesoon followed. In 1982, the Behavioural Science Unit at Quantico received agrant of 128,000 dollars from the National Institute of Justice to extend thepractice of interviewing convicted, incarcerated offenders. More FBI agents –some from outside the Behavioural Science Unit, specially trained for the task –were brought in and a mass survey of convicted, incarcerated murderers wasbegun. Its objective was to develop and expand the emergent criminal profilingtechnique: and since the organised/disorganised classification of offenders fromcrime scene evidence was law enforcement’s principal weapon in applying thattechnique, it was here that the main thrust of the research was directed. Theflood of information emanating from these prison interviews helped: one, toenumerate common behavioural charcteristics in convicted sex killers (in whoseranks America’s serial killers were to be found), and to relate thosecharacteristics directly to crime scene evidence; two, to identify significantdifferences in the crime scene behaviour of organised and disorganisedoffenders; and three, to highlight specific characteristics (sociological,environmental, etc.) which could be used statistically to profile the type ofoffender responsible for a particular crime.The FBI lists five categories of murder. They are felony murder (committedduring the commission of a felony or serious crime, such as armed robbery,hijack, arson, etc.); suspected felony murder; argument-motivated murder (asdistinct from criminally-motivated homicide, domestic dispute, etc.); murdercommitted for ‘other motives’ (any identifiable motive not included in the firstthree categories); and murder committed for ‘unknown’ motives. Many sex murdersmay wrongly be included in this last category, since the underlying sexualmotivation is often difficult to recognise by any but the trained observer.The lowest denomination, i.e. the murder of one person in circumstancesunrelated to any other murder, is classed as ‘single homicide’. Similarly, twovictims in the one location and in the course of an otherwise unrelated event isa ‘double homicide’, and three victims murdered in like circumstances a ‘triplehomicide’. However, when four or more persons are murdered in one location in anotherwise unrelated event, the classification is upgraded into two categories,‘family’ and ‘classic’ mass murder.Family mass murder, as the name implies, is the killing of four or more membersof one family by another member of that family. The most bizarre case incontemporary American crime history is the alleged murder by John List, a NewJersey insurance salesman and former Sunday-school teacher, of his mother, hiswife and their three children in 1971. List disappeared from his eighteen-roomedmansion in Westfield, New Jersey, on the night of 9 November 1971 when –according to the police – he shot dead his entire family with a 9mm automaticpistol. The five murders remained undiscovered for a month. When found, thebodies lay side by side on sleeping bags in the front room, as if in anundertaker’s parlour. Their heads were covered, their arms folded across theirchests. Four of the victims had been killed by a single shot, behind the leftear. The fifth – the Lists’ second son, John, aged fifteen – had ten bulletwounds to the head and body.A police search of the house then revealed a five-page ‘confession’ allegedlywritten by the missing John List Snr. Two days later his car was found,abandoned in a car park at Kennedy airport in neighbouring New York. Thecontents of the ‘confession’ were not disclosed, although the police describedthem as a ‘play by play’ account of what List had done, and why. Press reportssaid he was in financial difficulty at the time, and had been siphoning off cashfrom his mother’s account.Nothing more was heard of List for eighteen years. Whether he was alive or deadwas uncertain, but there were indications of careful planning and he was placedon the FBI’s wanted list as a federal fugitive. Then in June 1989 a televisionreconstruction of the New Jersey family mass murder – shown on the top-ranking‘America’s Most Wanted’ programme – screened two facial likenesses of how JohnList (by then aged sixty-three) might look after eighteen years on the run. Onelikeness was a sculpture, the other a robotic, computer-built ‘photograph’.The bust, which proved to be incredibly accurate, brought three hundredtelephone calls to the FBI from viewers who identified the person portrayed as‘Robert Clark’, an elderly married man then living in a suburb of Richmond,Virginia. When interviewed, ‘Robert Clark’ (who had married a woman from Denver,Colorado, in 1977) denied he was John List, but was subsequently finger-printedand arrested. Within hours, the family mass murder case took a dramatic newturn. An FBI spokesman announced that the Bureau was reopening its file on theUnited States’ most wanted hijacker – a man hitherto known only as ‘D.B.Cooper’.D.B. Cooper was the name given by a man who bought a ticket for a North-WestAirlines flight from Portland, Oregon to Mexico on Thanksgiving Day,3[../Text/chapter_003.xhtml#ft003] 24 November 1971. After the plane was airbornehe handed a hijack note to a stewardess, which said he was carrying a live bomband was taking over the aircraft. The pilot was forced to head north, and landedat Seattle, Washington, where ‘D.B. Cooper’ demanded and was given 200,000dollars in twenty-dollar bills and four parachutes. In turn he allowed the otherpassengers and some of the cabin crew to disembark before ordering the pilot totake off again for Mexico. Once airborne, however, the pilot was forced to leveloff at 10,000 feet over the snowy Cascade Mountains range south of Seattle,whereupon the hijacker attached one parachute harness to the suitcase containingthe ransom money, strapped a second on himself, and baled out, via thetail-section passenger entrance. No trace of ‘D.B. Cooper’ was found, dead oralive, despite a massive ground search; and the theory that he might haveperished during or after descent – this was grizzly bear country – appeared tobe strengthened by the discovery nine years later of 5,800 dollars of the ransommoney, washed up on the banks of the Columbia River (which marks the borderbetween Washington State and Oregon). Whatever the fate of the resourceful ‘D.B.Cooper’, John List – alias ‘Robert Clark’ – left Virginia in handcuffs on 8 June1989 for Newark, New Jersey, to face charges of family mass murder dating backto 1971. No date for his trial – which could perhaps shed new light on the ‘D.B.Cooper’ hijack – had been set when this book went to press.The second category of ‘mass murder’ – classic mass murder – i.e. the killing offour or more (non-family) victims in a single location at one time – is a typeof homicide which is becoming increasingly frequent worldwide. Charles Whitman,a twenty-five-year-old architectural engineering student at the University ofTexas, in Austin, was an early classic mass murderer. In August 1986, afterfirst murdering his wife and mother (by stabbing both to death), he piled ahandcart with guns, ammunition, ropes, a radio and supplies of food, barricadedhimself in a campus tower at Austin and blazed away at everyone who came intohis sights. Within ninety minutes Whitman shot dead sixteen men and women andwounded thirty more, some seriously. Police eventually surrounded the tower andshot him dead.Classic mass murderers are usually found to be mentally ill men, who unleashtheir growing hostility to society in an orgy of stabbing or shooting (mostly)random victims. Whitman himself had earlier called on the campus psychiatrist,and spoken of spasmodic ‘rages’ which caused him to assault his wife and attimes threatened to overwhelm him. However, he cancelled a subsequentappointment, saying he ‘would work things out himself’. Instead, he ran amok.The post-mortem revealed that he had a brain tumour.A number of similar classic mass murders have occurred since the Whitmanshootings, particularly in Australia and Canada as well as the United States.The most recent, which also took place on a university campus, was at theUniversity of Montreal in December 1989. There Marc Lepine, a single,French-speaking, unemployed young man of twenty-five who himself aspired tobecome an undergraduate, burst into classrooms brandishing a semi-automatic .22Storm Ruger rifle. At first some students thought it was a joke. ‘You’re all abunch of feminists,’ he shouted – but then opened fire selectively on womenstudents, killing fourteen and wounding nine more before taking his own life.Four men students were also wounded in the course of the massacre.It transpired that Lepine, a dark-haired, heavily bearded man who was obsessedby books and films about war, bore a grudge against all women – whom he blamedfor ‘a life filled with disappointments’. Police found a letter on him whichcontained a ‘hit list’ of fifteen prominent Quebec women, and was filled withcomplaints that ‘feminists . . . have always spoiled my life’. He entered thecampus without arousing suspicion by carrying the semi-automatic rifle wrappedin a green refuse bag. He opened fire first in the engineering buildingcafeteria, killing three girl students. Next he burst into a classroom on thesecond floor, separated the two sexes at gunpoint and – after ordering the mento leave – fired bursts at the screaming girl students, killing six and woundingseveral others. ‘It was a human hunt, and we were the quarry’, said studentFrançoise Bordelau later. ‘I heard the man say “I want the women!”’ Lepine movedon to shoot dead three women undergraduates working in the computer room, andstalked those who fled through the corridors, firing as he went. Finally heturned the gun on himself.FBI profilers list two other kinds of multiple murderer – ‘spree’ and ‘serial’killers. A spree killer is one who commits murder in two or more locations withno cooling-off period between the homicides – all of which are related in thatthey form part of a single event. Such events may be of indeterminate length,and involve more than one local police force. On 6 September 1949 Howard Unruhwalked through his home town of Camden, New Jersey, firing a 9mm Luger at anyonewho crossed his path. In the one deadly twenty-minute event he murdered thirteenchance victims and wounded three more. This was officially classed as a spreekilling because the killings were carried out in different areas of the town.The most notorious spree killer in British criminal history was atwenty-seven-year-old, unmarried man named Michael Ryan. On 19 August 1987 Ryan– who had no previous criminal record – murdered sixteen people and woundedfourteen others in what became known as ‘The Hungerford Massacre’, and took hisown life when cornered by the police. Ryan lived alone with his mother inHungerford, a market town in rural Berkshire on the ancient Roman road to Bath.He was a fantasist who found difficulty in establishing any kind of normalrelationship with women. Instead, he invented ‘girlfriends’. Male acquaintances(Ryan had no close friends, of either sex) knew him as a loner who bragged abouthis women friends and even spoke of his former ‘wife’, who had divorced him forhis adultery. He also claimed to be an ex-paratrooper and a trained pilot. Noneof it was true. Relatives – who had never seen him with a girl – thought him apleasant, quiet young man who neither drank to excess nor took drugs. Yet allthe evidence suggests that a singularly clumsy bid by Ryan to rape at gunpoint arespectable married woman – who had never set eyes on him before, and was outfor the day with her children – was the single event which sparked off the‘Hungerford Massacre’.It may be an indication of the kind of mental hurdle the prospect of sex with awoman presented to Ryan that, on the sunny summer’s morning he set out forSavernake Forest – a beauty spot nine miles from Hungerford – he armed andequipped himself like a man marching off to war. He stowed a semi-automatic AK47Kalashnikov assault rifle, loaded with armour-piercing bullets, and an Mlcarbine (as used by US infantry in World War Two and the Korean war) in the bootof his car, and tied a 9mm Beretta pistol to his wrist. He further donned abullet-proof waistcoat and a ‘Rambo’-style headband, and carried full survivalkit (groundsheet, filled water bottle, food, spare magazines, etc.) with him. Itlater emerged that he had been seen at Savernake earlier: the events of 19August suggest it may have been for reconnaissance.Sometime that morning Mrs Susan Godfrey, a thirty-three-year-old housewife wholived near Reading and had driven her two children, aged four and two, toSavernake for a picnic treat, became Ryan’s first chance victim of the day. Heforced her, at gunpoint, to strap her children in the back seat of her car, andmade her accompany him into the forest carrying her blue family picnicgroundsheet. Mrs Godfrey died shortly afterwards in a hail of bullets fired fromthe Kalashnikov, presumably as she attempted to flee. She was not sexuallyassaulted. Ryan apparently panicked and headed back to Hungerford, leaving thechildren unharmed. He stopped briefly at a service station on theHungerford-Marlborough road to fill up with petrol. He then aimed a burst fromthe AK47 at the woman cashier (who knew him by sight) – but she escaped unhurtby diving to the floor, and rang the police. Ryan reached Hungerford ten minuteslater and went on the rampage, murdering fifteen people – including his mother,and the first (unarmed) policeman to arrive on the scene – and burned hismother’s house to the ground, before holing up in the school he attended as aboy. Rather than surrender to the armed police who then surrounded the building(and tried to talk Ryan into giving himself up) he put the Beretta to his templeand pulled the trigger.It was this nine-mile drive from Savernake Forest – where he murdered MrsGodfrey – to the second killing ground at Hungerford which, by FBIclassification, changes Ryan from ‘classic mass murderer’ into ‘spree killer’.This is not to split hairs: such meticulous classification is of majorimportance to the Quantico criminal analysis programme, which is based on commonbehavioural characteristics identified in specific types of violent offender.FBI analysts, for example, define a serial killer as a murderer who is involvedin three or more separate events, with an emotional cooling-off period betweeneach homicide. As we have previously noted (see here[../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_62]), this cooling-off period is the main traitwhich distinguishes the serial killer from all other multiple murderers. Otheridentifiable differences may be found in their choice of victim. Serial killerstend to preselect a type of victim to murder, whereas classic mass murderers andspree killers will both murder whichever human targets happen to presentthemselves. Similarly the serial killer controls the successive stages of eachmurder he commits (to a larger or lesser degree, depending whether he is anorganised or disorganised offender); while neither the classic mass murderer northe spree killer is likely to have an opportunity to do so once the lawenforcement agency concerned closes in on him.Again, serial killers rarely commit suicide when apprehended (see here[../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_71]). Yet spree killers frequently take theirown lives, even when they cannot fail to be aware that no death sentence awaitsthem in law. Michael Ryan, ringed by police in Hungerford and unable to escape,was one such example: the death penalty for murder in Britain had been abolishedfor eleven years at the time of the ‘massacre’. Many classic mass murderers alsoseem not to want to live, once their own compulsive urge to kill has abated.Some, like Marc Lepine, then shoot themselves. Others – Charles Whitman, forexample – carry on killing until the law enforcement agency concerned is leftwith no recourse but to kill them; offender behaviour which some regard not asdefiance of authority, but as an oblique form of suicide.Similarly, the specific classification of single homicides – possibly committedin different locations over an indeterminate period and not immediatelyconnected – may enable them to be linked as series murder, either by forensicevidence or crime scene analysis. Another demonstration of the value of homicideclassification by behavioural analysis was provided by the Francine Elvesoninvestigation (pp. 91–4), during which the FBI profile advised the police thatthe (then unknown) offender was liable to kill again unless apprehended.Sometimes a serial killer will turn spree killer. Heightened tension is usuallythe cause, for example during an investigation in which the serial killer ispositively identified. As pressure on the offender mounts hourly from policevigilance and media publicity, so the man on the run puts aside the cooling-offperiod and kills repeatedly, spree-style. Even his motivation for killing maychange. Instead of stalking a specific type of victim for sexual gratification,he may murder from sheer desperation – for instance, if he urgently needs to buytime by changing his getaway car and so throw his pursuers off the scent.This was the scenario which unfolded in 1984 during the nationwide hunt bypolice and FBI for the most notorious serial-turned-spree-killer in US criminalhistory, Christopher Bernard Wilder. ‘Chris’ Wilder was an unmarried, wealthyAustralian-born racing driver and entrepreneur who arrived in Miami in 1970,aged twenty-five. He invested in commerce and property and lived in style, witha Cadillac alongside the Porsche racing car at his luxury home in Boynton Beach,an Olympic-size swimming pool, and a speedboat tied up at the quay. An athletic,neatly-dressed man with a beard and moustache, Wilder was also an ablephotographer; good enough to boast of many a conquest by promising to transformaspiring models into cover-girls for smart fashion magazines.In 1980, unknown to his friends on the Grand Prix circuit, he was charged withraping two teenagers at Palm Springs, California. It was a case which attractedlittle publicity. The teenagers said they felt ‘dizzy’ and were raped by Wilderafter he photographed them eating pizzas – which he supplied – ostensibly for anadvertising feature. He told the court the girls were willing participants whosued only when they learned he was rich. In the absence of any forensic evidenceto support the drug allegations, Wilder was bound over for five years. Then inAugust 1983, during a brief return visit to Australia where he was alleged tohave posed as a professional photographer and agent, Wilder appeared in court inSydney charged with abducting and raping two fifteen-year-old girls. By then heheld dual US and Australian citizenship; and after he had pleaded urgentbusiness in America and with relatives standing bail, the hearing was put backuntil April 1984.How many murders he may have committed following his return to Miami isuncertain, since he did not live long enough to stand trial. But in the sevenweeks between 26 February and 12 April 1984 Chris Wilder is thought to haveattacked and abducted at least eleven women, ten of whom were duped intobelieving he was a professional photographer. Eight of the ten were eithermurdered or disappeared – presumed murdered – during the course of a marathon,serial-turned-spree-killer manhunt which started in Florida, moved north toGeorgia, headed west through Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and Nevada intoCalifornia, then swung back east via Indiana, New York, Massachusetts and NewHampshire to within a few miles of the Canadian border, where Wilder – thequarry – was shot dead.Three of the four victims whose bodies were found had been raped and stabbed todeath. The fourth – Wilder’s last victim, and oldest of the eleven atthirty-three – was shot dead and dumped in a gravel pit. He hijacked her car ina desperate attempt to shake off his pursuers, and made no attempt to molesther. The fate of the four missing women remains unknown. The three who survivedwere all abducted, bound hand and foot, gagged with adhesive tape, beaten,raped, sexually abused and tortured by Wilder with an electric prod; one alsohad her eyelids sealed with superglue. Two of them escaped – one outwittedWilder, the other was stabbed several times by him and left for dead. Wilderhimself freed the third – a sixteen-year-old girl whom he had abducted ten daysearlier in Torrance, California. She lived because she developed what issometimes called the ‘Patti Hearst’ syndrome (see here[../Text/chapter_001.xhtml#page_24]) – a shocked condition, in which a kidnapvictim may identify with her captor(s) as the only means of saving her life.Wilder first came to the attention of the Miami police in February 1984following the disappearance of a Cuban model named Rosario Gonzales. MissGonzales, a pretty twenty-year-old who was engaged to be married, vanished froma Grand Prix race meeting in which Wilder competed (he came seventeenth) andwhere she had taken a part-time job. Wilder was questioned when her fiancé toldthe police he photographed the missing girl during the meeting. Wilder agreedthat he had, but said she had approached him for help in finding work as amodel, and insisted they had not met again.Two weeks later Elizabeth Kenyon, aged twenty-three and a part-time teacher andmodel, vanished after pulling in at a service station in Coral Gables, Miami,with a male companion who paid for the petrol. Miss Kenyon told the pumpattendant (whom she knew) that she was on her way to the airport for aphotographic session. Two days later the car was found abandoned at Miamiinternational airport. She was never seen again. When enquiries revealed thatWilder knew and had photographed Elizabeth Kenyon before her disappearance, hewas again questioned by the police. He denied meeting her on the day she droveto the airport, and the garage attendant was unable to describe the man he hadseen with Miss Kenyon in the car.This time, however, the investigating police persisted with their enquiries, anddiscovered that Wilder had twice appeared in court on rape charges, in PalmSprings and Sydney. Two days later, on 20 March 1984, Miami detectives drove toBainbridge, south Georgia, where a nineteen-year-old woman student had beensexually assaulted by a man answering Wilder’s description. Guests in a motel atBainbridge had broken into a locked bathroom overnight to rescue a screaming,hysterical, naked girl whose hands were tied behind her back and her ankleshobbled by nylon cord. A strip of silver-coloured adhesive tape hung from onecorner of her mouth, and she was unable to open her eyes. After treatment inhospital she told the police that a well-dressed, bearded man approached her theprevious afternoon in a shopping centre at Tallahassee (in north Florida, fivehours’ drive from Bainbridge), claiming to be a fashion photographer. He allayedher suspicions by showing her a montage of pictures. As she posed fully-dressedfor photographs in nearby public gardens the man hit her, hid her bound andgagged inside a sleeping bag in the boot of his car, and drove to Bainbridge –where he smuggled her into the motel room under cover of darkness.After submitting her to an ordeal of beating, rape, and torture he eventuallyallowed her to use the bathroom – with her hands tied behind her back, herankles hobbled, and (as a further precaution against escape) her eyelids sealedwith superglue. Once inside she managed to slide the bolt with one hand, heldher face against the corner of a cabinet to tear the sticking plaster from hermouth – and screamed. All her rescuers saw of the man were the rearlights of hiscar. However, she was able to identify Wilder from photographs carried by thepolice from Miami, and the manhunt began.By the time detectives reached Wilder’s house at Boynton Beach the bird hadflown. Enquiries revealed that he had drawn 50,000 dollars from the bank, andbought an air ticket to Sydney. This proved to be a false trail; Wilder hadresold the ticket to add to his cash in hand. His two expensive cars were stillin his garage, but the two-tone Chrysler he used to abduct thenineteen-year-student from Tallahassee (one of a fleet of company cars owned byWilder) was missing. An alert was put out, while frogmen searched the canalflowing past his house for bodies: no trace of Miss Gonzales or Elizabeth Kenyonwas found.Then on 23 March 1984 the body of Terry Diane Walden, a twenty-three-year-olduniversity nursing student who disappeared two days earlier from a shoppingcentre in Beaumont, Texas, was found floating in a canal on the outskirts of thetown. She had been beaten, bound hand and foot, and stabbed to death, gaggedwith adhesive tape similar to that used to silence Theresa Ferguson (murdered on18 March) and the unnamed student subsequently kidnapped in Tallahassee. Medicalevidence showed that Terry Walden, who was clothed, had been raped. Herorange-coloured Mercury Cougar was missing: Wilder’s two-tone company Chryslerwas found abandoned in the shopping centre car park. The chase was on again.On 25 March English-born Suzanne Logan, aged twenty-one and a bride of only ninemonths, drove her husband to work in Oklahoma City. After calling at a localshopping centre – where she was seen talking to a well-dressed, bearded man –she failed to arrive home. Three days later and three hundred miles away herbody was found on the banks of a reservoir near Junction City, Kansas. She toohad been beaten, raped and stabbed to death. Silver-coloured plaster stilladhered to her mouth, and she was bound hand and foot with nylon cord.Charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and rape were filed against Wilder inKansas, with bail (should he be apprehended) set at two million dollars. FBIassistant director Oliver Revell told a press conference in Washington, DC, thatWilder’s murders represented ‘a classic case of sexual, series murders that takeplace so many miles apart the local authorities cannot readily connect them’.Wilder became one of the FBI’s ‘Ten Most Wanted’ fugitives, and all policeforces were asked to keep a lookout for Terry Walden’s distinctive MercuryCougar.The trail led next to Colorado where Sheryl Bonaventure, a blue-eyed blonde ofeighteen who wanted to be a model, vanished from a shopping centre in GrandJunction. She was never seen again. With Wilder heading westward, a trap was setfor him in southern California where two Grand Prix meetings were due to takeplace, at Long Beach and Riverside. However, on 1 April seventeen-year-oldMichelle Korfman from Boulder City, Colorado – who modelled clothes for a localdepartment store, and had entered a nationwide, magazine-sponsored ‘Miss Teen’beauty competition in Las Vegas, Nevada – was reported missing. Wilder, whoarrived in Las Vegas the night before the competition, coolly took a front-rowseat and invited entrants seeking a career in modelling to contact him later atCaesar’s Palace Hotel. Miss Korfman, whose car was found parked there, has notbeen seen since.Wilder missed the trap set for him by only a few miles. Instead of driving toLong Beach for the Grand Prix, he went instead to Torrance (another suburb, tothe west of Los Angeles) on 4 April and abducted a sixteen-year-old girl who‘wanted to become a model’. After telephoning a boyfriend to announce that aprofessional photographer was to pay her one hundred dollars for a photosession, she too disappeared. For a time the trail went cold. Then on 10 April asecond sixteen-year-old was reported missing, this time from a shopping centrein Merriville, Indiana.Two days later – and more than one thousand miles still further east – thesecond missing girl was seen bleeding profusely as she staggered along a roadnear Barrington, in upper New York state. A passing motorist (who thought shewas an accident victim) drove her to the nearest hospital, where she was foundto have multiple knife wounds. After an emergency operation she told the policethat a girl of her own age had approached her in Merriville on 10 April, andasked if she would take part in a photographic session. She explained that thephotographer required two models for the assignment, and would pay themtwenty-five dollars apiece. The Merriville teenager agreed – only to be draggedinto a waiting, orange-coloured Mercury Cougar by a man armed with a gun. Hegagged the girl with adhesive tape, and sexually assaulted her on the back seatas the other sixteen-year-old drove. The three of them spent that night in amotel at Akron, Ohio, where the girl driver warned the Merriville teenager notto resist Wilder or ‘they would both be killed’.They spent a second night in a motel at Syracuse, New York State, where theMerriville captive was again sexually abused and tortured. Next morning, 12April, Wilder’s picture was shown on television – and as soon as he had shavedoff his beard, the trio left Syracuse in a hurry. ‘We’ve got to change cars,’said Wilder. Shortly afterwards he stopped in a wooded area, and promised torelease the Merriville girl unharmed if she said nothing to the police toincriminate him. Although she gave her word, Wilder stabbed her repeatedly andleft her for dead.Early that afternoon a lorry driver saw what he thought was a tailor’s dummy ina gravel pit near Victor, N.Y. It was in fact the body of a woman named BethDodge: she had been shot dead, after leaving work to drive home for lunch in thenearby town of Phelps. At first no-one realised Wilder might be the murderer:Beth Dodge was older than the type of victim he usually targeted, and had notbeen sexually assaulted. However, all doubts evaporated when the Mercury Cougarwas found abandoned twenty miles away – while Beth Dodge’s car, a PontiacFirebird, was missing. This in turn posed a new mystery. The Merriville teenagerwas alive and safe in hospital: but where was the sixteen-year-old fromTorrance, and was she still alive?In fact Wilder had driven the Torrance girl to the international airport atBoston, Massachusetts, in the Pontiac. On arrival he paid for her airline ticketback to Los Angeles – and handed her five hundred dollars in cash. ‘I’ve got afeeling the end is close,’ he told her, prophetically. ‘You just go home andforget what’s happened.’ Unpredictably violent to the end, however, he thendrove into Boston and all but succeeded in abducting another young woman, whosecar had broken down. It took only seconds for Wilder to force her into thehijacked Pontiac at gunpoint – but he had no opportunity in a Boston street tobind and gag victim number twelve. She escaped by jumping out at the first setof traffic lights, and was later able to identify Wilder from policephotographs.Next day – Friday the 13th (of April 1984) – two New Hampshire state troopers onpatrol at Colebrook, eight miles from the Canadian border, spotted the Pontiacat a filling station. Wilder had time only to grab his .357 Magnum revolver fromthe glove compartment before Trooper Leo Jellison – 6(prime) 2(doubleprimd) inheight and weighing some 250 pounds, or seventeen stone – landed on top of him.Two shots sounded in quick succession. The first bullet passed clean throughWilder’s body to enter the trooper’s chest, but missed the vital organs. Thesecond shot killed Wilder instantly. In that short, desperate struggle it wasnot clear if Wilder had tried to kill Trooper Jellison – or himself. Either way,the 5,000-mile chase was over.The mystery of the ‘missing’ Torrance teenager was solved the same day when shearrived back in California, and was interviewed by police. She said she did notknow why Wilder spared her: she had been raped and tortured like his othervictims, and he had threatened to kill her several times. She admitted leadingthe Merriville sixteen-year-old to the car where Wilder lay in wait, but saidshe was too terrified of him to disobey his orders.Although the marathon chase was eventually brought to a successful conclusion,it emphasised the enormity of the task facing individual law enforcementagencies when attempting to track down and apprehend transient violent criminalsin a land as vast as the United States. The mounting toll of victims Wilder leftbehind him served only to underline – yet again – the imperative need in Americafor a national resource centre, staffed and equipped to monitor, advise – andwhere need be, assist – at every turn in such a fast-developing situation.Fortunately, such plans were already well advanced. Within two months ofWilder’s death the essential, first administrative step toward fulfilling thatrequirement was taken by President Reagan, with the formal establishment of theNCAVC at Quantico on 21 June 1984.By then serial murder had been a cause of growing concern in the US for at leastthree decades. In 1950, Dr Paul de River wrote about the ‘lust killers’, nowrecognised as a most dangerous sub-species of serial killer (pp. 64–9). In theearly 1960s the thirteen serial murders committed by Albert DeSalvo, the BostonStrangler, reduced the state capital of Massachusetts to near panic. The 1970swere positively a vintage decade in America for notorious serial killers. Amongthem were Gerald Schaefer, the Florida deputy policeman suspected oftwenty-eight murders, Californian schizophrenic Herb Mullin (ten murders), EdKemper (ten murders), Texan homosexual Dean Corll (twenty-seven murders), JohnGacy, another homosexual, from Chicago (thirty-three murders), ‘HillsideStrangler’ Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono (nine murders), and Ted Bundy(twenty-three admitted murders, but thought to be ‘good for thirty-four’). Smallwonder that President Reagan reflected the nation’s concern in 1984, by givingthe newly-created NCAVC as its primary mission ‘the identification and trackingof repeat killers’.An important factor which added to the widespread fear aroused by ‘working’serial killers in the United States in those early years was that no-one knewhow many were at large at any given time, or the sum total of lives they claimedeach year. On the other hand their crimes were such that they were quiteproperly reported by the media in full, so that at times the American publicmust have felt some new plague had come among them. Again, serial killers werenot recognised as a distinct species of murderer until agents of the FBI’sBehavioural Science Unit first learned to identify and profile them from crimescene analysis. Hitherto such bizarre cases were often recorded as ‘sexmurders’, ‘unknown motive’ homicides, or simply as ‘unsolved’. The reason whymany remained unsolved was not lack of effort by the local law enforcementagency involved, but rather the lack of a tested technique to investigate theseseemingly motiveless, clue-less murders in a prescribed, systematic manner.That situation changed once the NCAVC became operational and CIAP (the CriminalInvestigative Analysis Programme) was introduced. In a joint survey published inthe FBI’s Law Enforcement Bulletin in December 1986, headed ‘Criminal Profiling:A Viable Investigative Tool against Violent Crime’, the authors – special agentsJohn Douglas and Alan Burgess – made the specific point that: ‘Sexualhomicides . . . yield much information about the mind and motivation of thekiller. A new dimension is provided to the investigator via the profilingtechnique, particularly in cases where the underlying motive for the crime maybe suddenly hidden from even the more experienced detective.’President Reagan called the offenders ‘repeat killers’. Credit for coining theterm ‘serial killer’ is given to FBI special agent Robert Ressler, one of thethree Quantico instructors who took part in the test-case Meirhofer investigtionin 1974 (pp. 86–9). In an article in the New York Times magazine of 26 October1986, journalist and author Stephen G. Michaud wrote: ‘Mr Ressler started usingthe term [serial killer] because such an offender’s behaviour is so distinctlyepisodic, like the movie house serials he enjoyed as a boy.’ In June 1983, oneyear before the establishment of the NCAVC, a Senate Judiciary committee debatedthe impact of serial murder on American society, under a heading that said itall: ‘Patterns of murders committed by one person in large numbers with noapparent rhyme, reason or motivation.’ The four principal subjects listed fordebate were ‘Missing and murdered children’, ‘Sexual exploitation of children’,‘Unidentified bodies’ and ‘Serial killers’. Thus the term passed officially intothe American idiom.When responsibility for leading the campaign to reduce violent crime in theUnited States was delegated to the Behavioural Science Unit of the FBI in June1984, the NCAVC had four main programmes to administer. They were research anddevelopment (Quantico’s traditional ‘think tank’ role), training, profiling andconsultation, and VICAP (the Violent Criminal Apprehension Programme). Whilethese four still form the bedrock of the Centre’s programming, theiradministration is divided between two wings of the Behavioural Science Unit,viz. Instruction and Research (BSIR), and Investigative Support (BSIS). Thoughthe two wings have separate functions, in the long term they are whollycomplementary.BSIR looks to the future. In addition to furthering research and trainingincoming agents for their new, specialist duties, this wing is responsible forprogramming law enforcement in the United States in the twenty-first century.BSIS, or the ‘operational wing’, deals with today’s problems. It uses the mostmodern technology to help reduce the unacceptable levels of violent crime –particularly in the field of serial murder, rape and arson, but also including avariety of other offences ranging from kidnapping, extortion, certain aspects ofterrorism (hostage survival, etc.), and tampering with consumer goods – a growthindustry in many countries in recent years – to public corruption. Research inall areas is unceasing at the NCAVC. ‘PROFILER’, the first automated profilingsystem to be employed in criminal analysis, is already operational. Althoughthere are still some areas in which it cannot match the human analyst – notablythe hunch, that intuitive judgement which comes to the human investigator onlyafter years of experience – this computerised system delivers such accurateanalyses that Quantico’s ten senior analysts use it constantly as a consultant,and apprentice analysts in training. A second expert system is in the pipeline,designed to apprehend the serial rapist and based on information gleaned frommass interviews with convicted offenders.FBI unit chief John Henry Campbell commands the Behavioural Science Unit atQuantico, and with it the NCAVC. The two wings of the Centre each have their ownunit chief, subordinate to John Campbell. BSIS, the ‘operational wing’, is ledby supervisory special agent (SSA) Alan E. Burgess. Alan Burgess – a quiet,confident executive known as ‘Smokey’ to FBI colleagues – is also Administratorof the NCAVC.4 [../Text/chapter_003.xhtml#ft004] SSA John Douglas, widelyacknowledged as the most experienced of modern profilers, is manager of theoperational wing’s ‘cutting edge’ – the CIAP, or the Criminal InvestigativeAnalysis Programme. Together, the two men make a powerful crime-fighting team.The programme itself is operated by ten senior analysts, the only ten of theirkind in the world.Under the stewardship of Alan Burgess and John Douglas, these ten men form theaces in the pack at Quantico. They wage their unique, solitary war againstserial offenders either from a desk sixty feet underground (the NCAVC is housedin a former nuclear bunker, originally intended for intelligence personnel inthe event of an atomic war), or from a plane or car seat; they travelextensively, both in and beyond the United States. They are officially known as‘criminal investigative analysts’, rather than ‘profilers’. Profiling is whatthey do, but not as before: psychiatrist Dr James Brussel gave the New York citypolice a genuine ‘psychological profile’ of Mad Bomber George Metesky in 1957(pp. 81–6). The FBI analysts at Quantico are not psychiatrists. They are trainedinvestigative agents who draw on police reports, their own murder scene analysisbased on photographic, medical and forensic evidence, VICAP data and theautomated PROFILER system – plus their years of experience – to compile asystematic analysis of both the type of offender responsible, and the crimeitself.Although the responsibility for listing each component of an analysis rests withthe special agent concerned, all at BSIS work on the principle thatinvestigative experience shared is knowledge gained: ‘The more minds at work,the better.’ Tremendous importance is therefore placed on the daily ‘groupprofiling conferences’, where every known detail pertaining to each incomingcase goes into the melting-pot of expert, round-table discussion. Otherspecialist advice, in the fields of pathology, forensic science, sociology,legal problems, etc., is also always available at Quantico. Should further localknowledge be sought, the ten Quantico analysts – each of whom has responsibilityfor a given area nationwide – are backed by a force of one hundred and tenspecially trained FBI agents (known as Field Profile Co-ordinators), stationedthroughout the United States. Although the co-ordinators have several duties,special attention is always given to serial murder investigations.To gauge the extent of the possible workload facing the operational wing atQuantico, one need only examine the violent crime statistics in the US for 1988– the most recent available when this book went to press. The sum total of alltypes of homicide for the year – 20,675 – was some 3,000 down on the peak 1980figure. However, murder represented a mere one per cent of violent crimeoverall. Nationwide, there was an average rate of one violent crime every twentyseconds, including one ‘aggravated assault’5 [../Text/chapter_003.xhtml#ft005]every thirty-five seconds, one robbery a minute, one forcible rape every sixminutes, and one murder every twenty-five minutes.In itself, that total of 20,675 murders was an increase of 3% over the precedingyear. Worst hit were the big cities (average 4% up). The bigger the populationof the city, the greater the rise in the murder rate; those with more than aquarter of a million inhabitants registered increases ranging from 1% to 8%. InNew York – the biggest city in the country, the ‘Big Apple’ – there were 6,530murders in the 1960s decade: that total more than doubled to 15,569 during the1970s: the sum total for the 1980s is expected to show a further increase ofbetween 2,000 and 3,000. Much of this rise in the big city murder-rate isundoubtedly drug-related. Dr Thomas Reppetto of the New York Citizens CrimeCommission put the blame squarely on gang wars arising from the drugs traffic.‘In 1988,’ he said, ‘40% of the killings were drug-related, as opposed to 20–25%in the early 1980s. A lot of this was the result of wars on the street betweendifferent gangs.’To try to relate serial murder to the overall violent crime figures is morecomplicated. The FBI’s uniform crime rate for 1988 breaks down types of homicideby percentage as follows: argument-motivated (i.e. non-criminally motivated)34.3%; calculating all percentages on the sum total of 20,675 homicides, thisrepresented some 7,300 murders and the biggest single category. Felony andfelony-related homicide accounted for a further 20.2% (say 4,200 victims), and‘miscellaneous’ (any identifiable motive not covered by the aboveclassifications) 18.9%, or 3,800 victims. A total of 26.6% (approximately 5,200murders, the second biggest category) were classed as ‘unknown’ motive.The 1988 figures also showed that, on average nationwide, 70% (or 14,480) of allmurders committed in the United States were solved by the law enforcementagencies. The 30% unsolved represented 6,200 homicides: and somewhere among thatnumber must lie the bulk of all unidentified serial murders committed during theyear. The problem facing the NCAVC is, in what proportion? Even theobvious-seeming clues may be misleading. According to the uniform crime ratereturns, 12% of all homicide victims in 1988 (say 2,480) were murdered bystrangers. By no means all ‘stranger’ murders, however, are committed by serialkillers. For lack of evidence to the contrary, a percentage of felony-relatedand miscellaneous homicides will inevitably have been included among the sumtotal of 6,200 ‘unsolved’ cases. Likely examples would be the habitual offender– facing certain long-term imprisonment if apprehended – who kills when murderpresents his only opportunity to escape unidentified. Similarly, ‘first-timers’may kill unintentionally and flee in panic. In a country such as the UnitedStates, where one violent crime was committed every twenty seconds on averageduring 1988, such ‘stranger murders’ could conceivably add up to a formidabletotal over twelve months. As the nineteenth-century Scottish author ThomasCarlyle once observed, ‘You might do anything with figures’.When we were commissioned to write this book, we were aware that some observersin the US – the country worst affected – believed that serial murder claimedthousands of lives there each year, possibly 5,000 or more. It so happens thatwe have both lived and worked in America, and Colin continues to visit the USregularly and the average sum total of 20,000 murders of all kinds each year –compared with today’s 700 or so in Britain – occasioned no surprise. What wasintriguing, however, was the remarkable apparent disparity in the two serialmurder rates. If these unofficial estimates were accurate, they represented aratio not of thirty to one (as with the overall homicide total), but ofthousands to one.In Britain, where Jack the Ripper sent shivers down every spine more than onehundred years ago, the serial killer remains a rarity. One can count the numberto emerge over the past three or four decades on the fingers of both hands:Christie (hanged in July 1953), Brady and Hindley (sentenced to lifeimprisonment in 1966), Sutcliffe (jailed for a minimum thirty years, 1981),Nilsen (sentenced to life imprisonment in 1983), Erskine (jailed for a recordminimum of forty years, in January 1988), and Duffy (sentenced to a minimumthirty years imprisonment, one month later). One has to think long and hard torecall many others.One instance apart,6 [../Text/chapter_003.xhtml#ft006] serial killers are atwentieth-century phenomenon in the United States. Among the more notorious inthe first half of the century were Earle Nelson (p. 12), and Carl Panzram (pp.16–18). Nelson, who murdered twenty-two women in seventeen months in the late1920s, employed the simplest of modus operandi to maximum effect. He targetedlandladies who put ‘Room to Let’ notices in their front-room windows (a commonpractice in the Depression years that followed World War One), waited until thetwo of them were alone and then raped, strangled and robbed them before movingon. As with Chris Wilder sixty years later, simply to cross from one state intothe next virtually ensured temporary respite from pursuit. Carl Panzram was atough, long-term offender who had been homosexually gang-raped as a young man.He exacted revenge from society by committing twenty murders, mostly homosexualin nature, starting in 1918. In 1930 Panzram, by then thirty-eight years of age,contrived his own execution by murdering a prison guard – a crime which he knewto mean an automatic sentence. In 1934 Albert Fish, a New York painter anddecorator, was executed for the murder of a ten-year-old girl whose flesh hecooked and ate. Following his arrest, Fish confessed to four hundred childmurders; and while that confession was discounted (p. 70), he was believed to beresponsible for ‘dozens’ of murders. In general however, before World War Twoserial murder in the United States was rare in comparison, say, with thegangster killings of the Prohibition era.Ed Gein, a necrophiliac serial killer and devotee of the wartime Naziconcentration camp medical experimentalists, is thought to have inspired theAlfred Hitchcock thriller ‘Psycho’ by his macabre deeds in the late 1950s. Onone occasion he plundered a Wisconsin graveyard by night for edible body parts,and flayed one corpse to fashion a waistcoat ‘souvenir’. Some time later, whenpolice called at his house to question Gein about a missing elderly woman, theydiscovered the gutted torso of one of his earlier female victims hanging fromthe beams. Gein, who is believed to have committed nine murders in all, wasdetained in an institution for the criminally insane. As an old man in his lateseventies, he was interviewed by FBI agents – who were conducting their masssurvey of known sex murderers for the Criminal Analysis programme.Serial murder in the United States began to surface in earnest during the 1960s,along with all other forms of violent crime. Albert DeSalvo set the pace earlyin the decade, with thirteen murders in eighteen months – a reign of terror thatthe city of Boston is unlikely ever to forget. As we have already shown, he wasfollowed over the years by the likes of Schaefer, Corll, Mullin, Kemper andBundy, a deadly quintet who between them murdered at least a hundred men andwomen. One of the most recent of these so-called ‘high-scoring’ serial killerswas Richard Ramirez, alias ‘The Night Stalker’ – twenty-eight years of age,unmarried, a drifter and satanist from El Paso, Texas.In the fifteen months between June 1984 and August 1985 the Night Stalkermurdered thirteen people and sexually assaulted several others in the suburbs ofLos Angeles, terrifying the local communities in the process. His modus operandiwas to break into houses by night at random, taking whatever opportunity offeredby way of sex, robbery and murder. Men were shot or stabbed to death as theyslept. The women were beaten, raped and sexually abused, regardless of age: mostwere then murdered by strangulation, stabbing or shooting. Their children (ofboth sexes, some as young as six) were either sexually assaulted in their homesor abducted, to be raped or sodomised before being turned loose on the streets,miles away. All Ramirez’ attacks were marked by extreme cruelty; on one occasionhe gouged a woman’s eyes out. He ‘signed’ some of his murders by sketching inlipstick a pentagram – a five-pointed star, often associated with satanism – atthe scene of the crime, either on the victim’s body or the wall above.Ramirez, who had been profiled by the FBI at Quantico, was positively identifiedfrom a smudged fingerprint found on a getaway car. In a bid to prevent any moremurders, the local law enforcement agencies then issued his photograph to themedia. Shortly afterwards, Ramirez was recognised by a grocer’s assistant; heran into the street, but was chased by an angry mob after trying to steal awoman’s handbag, overpowered and arrested. In September 1989, after a triallasting five months, Ramirez was found guilty of thirteen murders and thirtyassociated felonies (five attempted murders, eleven sexual assaults and fourteenburglaries). When the jury later recommended that he should die in the gaschamber, Ramirez flaunted his satanic beliefs to the media crowding thecourtroom. ‘Big deal, death comes with the territory,’ he jeered. ‘See you inDisneyland!’ He now awaits the outcome of an appeal.Perhaps the most graphic illustration of the threat the serial killer poses tosociety lies in the fact that the Night Stalker’s victim count (thirteen murdersin fifteen months) is positively ‘low-scoring’ compared with some. As we haveshown (pp. 60–1), the highest known individual tally of serial murders restswith the Ecuadoran peasant Pedro Lopez. After his arrest in 1980, he confessedto murdering ‘about’ three hundred and fifty young girls in two years. In theUnited States a half-century earlier, Earle Nelson killed more people morequickly (twenty-two in seventeen months) than did Ramirez; while Albert Fishprobably murdered more than Nelson and Ramirez put together. Nor are suchnumbers exceptional. Since the sharp rise in all types of homicide began tomanifest itself in America in the 1960s, serial killers such as John Wayne Gacy(thirty-three victims), Gerald Schaefer (twenty-eight), Dean Corll(twenty-seven) and Ted Bundy (at least twenty-three), etc., have all murderedmore people than Ramirez, but over a longer period.In our view this represented an important field for research in any realisticassessment of the serial killer problem. Broadly speaking, were the unofficialestimates of the numbers killed annually in the United States correct? If theywere, why should one country – and that one the leader of the western world, astable society enjoying an enviable prosperity – suffer such a plague of serialmurder, yet the rest of us largely be spared? That the US suffers more homicidesannually than any other western nation is a matter of record, and that thisshould apply pro rata to serial murder would seem only logical. However, whilethe anti-gun lobby blames the constitutional right to bear arms for much ofAmerica’s huge annual murder total, there appeared to be no rational explanationfor the apparently phenomenal rise in the serial murder rate. Clearly, there wasonly one oracle to consult on this problem; and in September 1989 – courtesy ofthe FBI – Donald Seaman became the first author from Britain to be grantedaccess to the National Centre for the Analysis of Violent Crime at Quantico.The NCAVC is not normally open to the public, and security is impressive. TheCentre lies sixty feet underground, directly below the FBI Academy. The academyitself stands in a 600-acre enclave of woodland, encircled by thousands moreacres of lowland Virginia countryside – which in turn comprise the great USMarine Corps base at Quantico. Guards in strategically-placed checkpointsmonitor all traffic, in and out. The sound of small-arms fire echoes from rangesalongside the road threading through the outer perimeter. Within the FBIenclave, more gunfire sounds from indoor and outdoor ranges; all law enforcementofficers selected to undergo an eleven-week training course at the academy areissued with a .38 Police Special. In the Hogan’s Alley complex – a ghost town,complete with a bank, shops, service station, cleaner’s, fast-food restaurantand cinema (forever showing the programme seen by Public Enemy Number One JohnDillinger in Chicago in 1934, immediately before he walked out to his death in atrap sprung by the FBI) – students undergoing specialist training fight everykind of street battle they are likely to encounter in a lifetime of duty. At alltimes there are enough armed, disciplined men in place here to fight a smallwar.Entry to the NCAVC is via the Academy front door, and a foyer of which anyfive-star hotel would be proud; the one difference being that the ‘counterclerk’ here wears police uniform, sergeant’s stripes, and a .38 on his hipinstead of the customary clerical grey. Once signed in and tagged with a badge,visitors are escorted along a corridor and down by elevator to the BSIS wing, afuturistic high-tech beehive of a crime-fighting centre, the only one of itskind in the world. Its business is the analysis of violent crime, not thephysical arrest of violent criminals. There are no cells here, no interrogationrooms, no ‘Most Wanted’ posters; only desks and computers. On arrival visitorsare introduced to an NCAVC senior analyst who will act as guide and mentorthroughout their stay in this windowless, air-conditioned, subterranean wingwhich seems a world away from the blue skies and sunshine, and ranks offlowering dogwood, spruce and pine bordering the FBI Academy grounds sixty feetoverhead.Our guide is supervisory special agent Gregg O. McCrary (the ‘O’ stands forOliver). SSA McCrary is forty-four years old, married with two children, and wasborn in New York State. He has been an FBI agent for half his life. Before hejoined the elite ‘A (for analyst) Team’ here at Quantico he was a FieldProfiling Co-ordinator, and before that he served in FBI counter-intelligence.He stands some six feet in height, a spare, upright figure with a pale face,carefully trimmed moustache and brown hair flecked with grey. As with allpersonnel in the NCAVC he is smartly dressed, reflecting the evident highmorale. Equally, this is the FBI at work; McCrary’s dark blue blazer reveals nohint of the Smith & Wesson 9mm semiautomatic below, fully loaded with twelverounds in the magazine, plus one (for emergencies) already in the chamber.No law enforcement officer in the United States carries a gun for show. Thehandgun is also criminal America’s favourite weapon, as the FBI uniform crimereport lying on McCrary’s desk will testify. It says that during 1988,45% of allthe 20,675 murder victims in the US – 9,300 people – were shot dead withrevolvers or pistols, with a further 10% killed by shotguns or rifles. Ittherefore comes as no great surprise to discover that FBI agent and senioranalyst McCrary is a man of many parts. He is also a crack shot and formerfirearms instructor. In addition, he holds a black belt in the martial art ofshorinji kempo – a blend of the better known karate (punch, kick and block) andaikido/ju-jitsu (defensive) techniques. Instructors in this rare martial arttravel worldwide from their headquarters in Todatsu, Japan, to ensure that itsexacting standards become in no way debased. In McCrary’s case this entails twovisits (and two gruelling workouts) each year, physical examinations which hedescribes, with feeling, as a ‘most humbling experience’. In his capacity as amartial artist, McCrary was formerly an FBI instructor in defence tactics – andin the field, a ‘Special Weapons and Tactics’ (SWAT) team leader. A SWAT team isdeployed only in high-risk situations.Visitors start with a brief tour of the Investigative Support wing. The jewel inthe NCAVC’s technological crown is unquestionably VICAP, the Violent CriminalApprehension Programme. This unique, multi-million-dollar computer system actsbasically as a serial crime databank, with the master computer housed at FBIheadquarters in Washington, DC, forty miles away. Its task is to store, collateand analyse all unsolved, homicide-related crimes reported to the NCAVC by lawenforcement agencies nationwide, and fed on-line from Quantico via a securetelecommunications network.When a new case is submitted, the master computer in Washington simultaneouslyretrieves more than one hundred cases from the appropriate modus operandicategory, and overnight checks them against all other cases in store forsimilarities and discrepancies. Once that search is completed, a printed,computerised report is telexed back to Quantico – listing the ‘top ten’ matchingcases in pecking order. This remarkable crime-pattern analysis technique isknown as ‘Template pattern matching’, or more usually ‘The Template’ by VICAPanalysts working in the BSIS, or Investigative Support, wing. It wasspecifically designed and programmed for VICAP in the mid-1980s by the unsungheroes of the FBI’s backroom Technical Division.As soon as the Template is received at BSIS in Quantico, the VICAP analyst (asdistinct from the ‘senior analyst’, or profiler) determines which if any of thetop ten matches are linked with the new case as one series crime. Suppose, say,there are four. After consultation, the VICAP analyst then informs the four lawenforcement agencies involved, asks if they want a profile, and puts each intouch with the others so that the least possible time is lost in mounting aco-ordinated attempt to apprehend the offender.The VICAP system, straightforward in concept yet fraught with problems indevelopment, took twenty-seven years to evolve from a germ in one man’s mind tooperational readiness by 1985. It was the brainchild of Commander Pierce Brooks,retired now but formerly of the Los Angeles Police Department and first managerof the VICAP programme. During the course of two ‘unusual’ murder investigationsin 1958, Brooks – then a homicide detective – became convinced that both unknownkillers had murdered before. In those days there was no central source whichstored data on the modus operandi of transient multiple murderers. InsteadBrooks had to search computerised newspaper files and books in the city libraryfor the information he needed: a laborious task which gave rise to his dream ofan automated, central, permanently-updated, violent crime databank to serve allAmerica’s law enforcement agencies. Gradually his idea won support; and in the1970s, the US Department of Justice funded a VICAP task force of senior homicideinvestigators and analysts from more than twenty states to evaluate the Brooksproject. They were later joined by men from the FBI’s Behavioural Science Unit,where the concept of an American NCAVC was then under examination. As a result,VICAP and the complementary Criminal Analysis Programme were merged into thesingle crime-fighting system in use today.The first twelve months following the formal establishment of the NCAVC in June1984 were employed as a test-bed period for all aspects of the nascent VICAPsystem: a formidable task. There were major technological problems to solve,first in designing and programming the unique computer system required, andadditionally in dovetailing complementary internal procedures at Quantico. Therewas also one fundamental difficulty to overcome. VICAP’s role is to analyse, notinvestigate, serial violent crime. The two tasks call for quite different skillswhen co-operating to solve the same homicide. This meant tabling acomprehensive, dual-purpose crime report designed to cover every type of case –yet which would enable the analyst at Quantico to profile the specific type ofoffender responsible, by using behavioural patterns emanating from theinvestigative feedback.To no-one’s great surprise, many setbacks were encountered. Most important, fromthe operational point of view, it soon became apparent that fewer crime reportswere being returned than had been anticipated, and after six months the entireprocess was overhauled and simplified. The outcome was a VICAP Crime AnalysisReport which has remained unchanged since 1986, a ten-section questionnairelisting: administrative detail (law enforcement agency, county, town, stateetc); everything known about victim; ditto offender; description if any ofvehicle used; modus operandi; condition of victim when found (including use ofrestraints – gag, handcuffs, bonds, etc., evidence of torture if any,indications of removal of ‘souvenir’ items, other than clothing); cause ofdeath; forensic evidence; request for profiling (a tick in the required box issufficient); and details of related cases, if any.The VICAP form lists the types of crime dealt with by the system, as follows: 1. Solved or unsolved homicides or attempts, especially those that involve an abduction; are apparently random, motiveless, or sexually oriented; or are known or suspected to be part of a series. 2. Missing person, where the circumstances indicate a strong possibility of foul play and the victim is still missing. 3. Unidentified dead bodies, where the manner of death is known or suspected to be homicide.The report form also reminds investigators that ‘Cases where the offender hasbeen arrested or identified should be submitted, so unsolved cases in the VICAPsystem can be linked to known offenders’. According to SSA McCrary, thisreminder is of crucial importance. ‘The strength of VICAP – and inversely, itsweakness – lies in getting these reports sent to us. The difficulty lies inconvincing local investigators, who feel they have enough paperwork to do andenough forms to fill in as it is, that it is to their benefit to fill in onemore. Because if these reports aren’t submitted, and no-one tells us about thecrimes, we have no way of knowing these serial killers are out there.‘Right now California is about to send us several thousand unsolved homicides,cases spread over the last ten years or so which as yet have not been entered inthe VICAP system. It’s going to mean an awful headache for someone when all thishits us, but the fact remains – the more cases we get, the better job we can do.As a matter of fact attempts are being made to set up legislation, which wouldmake it mandatory to put all unsolved homicides into the VICAP system.’These crime analysis reports are entered into the master system via the BSIScomputer, which stands in its own centre along the corridor. Because it needscontrolled atmosphere and humidity to function at maximum efficiency, casualentry to the centre is barred by cypher and key locks. All the visitor seesthrough the protective screen is a red light, pulsing in the computer’s steelface like a great bloodshot eye as it ‘talks’ to Washington. Crime reportsapart, ‘Old Red-Eye’ is also used for the BSIS Artificial Intelligence System(‘AI’), and other in-house tasks such as the PROFILER system. It also has anadditional onward link with the National Crime Information Centre (NCIC) inWashington. The NCIC is linked in its turn, by telecommunications network, withall 17,200 police departments and other law enforcement agencies scatteredthroughout the United States: and entry to this system enables the NCAVC torequest ‘off-line’ checks (for instance, when attempting to monitor themovements of transient serial offenders).VICAP analyst Kenneth A. Hanfland works from an office close by the BSIScomputer centre. As he describes his job this big, cheerful man from Oregonsounds oddly reminiscent of, say, an art expert called in to check on theauthenticity of a painting; years of comparing and contrasting Template‘matches’ with crime reports have given him rare assurance in assessing themodus operandi of specific types of serial killer. After a while theconversation turns to British serial killers: and VICAP analyst Hanfland and SSAMcCrary both hear for the first time of Kenneth Erskine, alias The StockwellStrangler. They learn that Erskine committed seven murders in fifteen weeks in1986, targeting old age pensioners exclusively, the majority of whom weresexually assaulted. No further description of Erskine is given, other than toadd that he was aged twenty-four and British. Hanfland nods, and asks: ‘He’scoloured, right?’ McCrary agrees – and they are right (see here[../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_48]).The question is, how can any analyst know the offender’s race from those baredetails? Senior analyst McCrary explains: ‘In the FBI we don’t go into the racearea as such, except in so far as it applies to profiling. Obviously, when thepolice in any multiracial society are looking for a specific type of offender,it’s important for them to know if he’s black or white. As it happens, mostserial killers are white. No-one knows why, but the statistics show it to be so.‘Most violent crime is intra-racial, i.e. white on white, hispanic on hispanic,and so on. The exception is the black offender, who crosses the racial line morefrequently than do other offenders. You told us just now that this strangler inLondon targeted old folks exclusively, and sexually assaulted most of hisvictims . . . and it’s a statistical fact that sexual assault of the elderly isthe only sex crime that blacks commit more often than whites. Again, no-oneknows why.’VICAP analyst Hanfland’s next-door neighbour in the underground complex issocial psychologist Dr Roland Reboussin. Dr Reboussin – he is a doctor ofphilosophy – is a bespectacled, middle-aged, civilian member of the BehaviouralScience Computer Engineering Services Sub-unit: a boffin. His unique role in theoperational wing lies in the administration of PROFILER – the first ‘expertsystem’ to profile serial offenders by computer.Expert systems are part of that domain within the computer sciences known as‘artificial intelligence’. Their function is to employ the computer in givenareas, in a way which simulates the processes of human intelligence. To achievethis they require a ‘knowledge base’ – which may consist of up to five hundredrules – to guide the automated system towards its interpretative decisions inwhichever field the expert system obtains. This knowledge base is made up of‘artificial intelligence’ – i.e. expertise culled from the minds of humanexperts employed in a variety of areas: commercial, medical and most recently,criminal investigative analysis.Dr Reboussin refers with genuine pride to the many successful uses of the expertsystem. ‘In the commercial world they are used to search for mineral deposits,to fly and navigate passenger-carrying aircraft, to land NASA’s shuttles aftertheir journeys through space, and to serve a host of complex electronicsystems . . . One famous example in medicine is Mycin, an expert system whichdiagnoses diseases of the blood.’ How does an expert system work? ‘Well, takeMycin. Each rule in the Mycin knowledge base is an “if-then” statement: forexample, “If the patient’s temperature is over 100F, then an infection may bepresent”. The user, however, never sees the rules. Instead it is the expertsystem which puts the questions, and uses its knowledge base to diagnose theillness from the information supplied by the user.’PROFILER employs the same technique in investigative analysis. The artificialinformation on which its knowledge base is built is similarly a compound ofhuman skills, culled mostly from the NCAVC’s related investigative disciplines.Its initial rules were developed by observing the complete investigativeanalysis process (based on field reports, crime scene evidence, pathology,forensic science, victimology, etc.), performed in a group setting. Individualexpert human analysts further checked and adjusted every rule until the first150 were ready for the prototype PROFILER trials.In a joint paper entitled Expert Systems for Law Enforcement published in August1989, Dr Reboussin and his fellow author Mr Jerry Cameron, Chief of Police atFernandina Beach in Florida, explained how the basic system worked. ‘Informationabout the victim and the crime scene is essential to the analysis process.’After stressing that the analysis is designed to profile the type of offenderresponsible, rather than the individual, they continued: ‘With detailedinformation as to age, sex, occupation and daily habits of the victim, theautopsy report, and a specific description of the crime scene, the behaviour ofboth the victim and the offender during the crime can be reconstructed. Theresult of this analysis is a description of the (type of) person who committedthe crime, which includes physical characteristics (age, sex, and race),behavioural characteristics (whether the offender lives near the scene of thecrime, lives alone, or is unemployed), and personality traits andcharacteristics (the nature of relationships with women, or volatile temper). Anintermediate trait would be the nature of the offender’s relationship with thevictim.’Now two years old and fully operational, PROFILER provides an accuratecomputerised profile of the type of offender responsible for serial violentcrime. The depth of the profile is limited, as always, by the number of rulesprogrammed into the system; already these have risen to some 270, and thisknowledge base is continuously being expanded (see here[../Text/chapter_005.xhtml#page_180]). Although it is unable as yet to match thehuman analyst in all areas, PROFILER has already become an efficient workingrobot member of the ‘A Team’ at Quantico.Each of the ten senior analysts has his own computer, which he uses to bring upPROFILER on-screen to compare the various aspects of both human and automatedprofiles. Should any variance emerge both are re-examined to discover why, sothat the difference may be resolved. Dr Reboussin and Police Chief Cameronemphasise that the computerised programme ‘will never replace skilled humaninvestigative analysts, nor is it intended to do so . . . Rather, the systemwill function as an analyst’s assistant or consultant in several ways’.Laymen pose the question: what if there should be a conflict between man andmachine? The professionals do not see it that way. McCrary explains: ‘The humananalyst has the last word in profiling: it is his responsibility. You have tosay “I’m doing the profile, tnd this is what it is – A, B, C, D and E, rightthrough”. Having said that, obviously there may be areas where queries arise.Take a case in which the offender displays mixed characteristics, a frequentoccurrence. The human analysis may read simply “mostly disorganised”, whereasthe computer says “Point 75 disorganised, point 25 organised”. Okay, it’sconfirming in effect what you’ve said, but has made the point definitively. Onother occasions there may be an area where you think, “Why doesn’t the computersee it this way as strongly as we do?” This time you re-examine both profilesand you realise, “Ah! I’d forgotten that”, and adjust accordingly. That, ofcourse, is the great strength of the computer. It never forgets anything.‘Given that, what emerges ultimately is the sole responsibility of the humananalyst. We don’t actually ask the computer if we’re right, for the simplereason that it doesn’t have the final say. Now, I feel comfortable profiling.With experience, and enough successes, I guess you become confident in whateveryou’re doing, that’s only natural. But I hope never to feel overconfident: I’maware that I neither know all there is to know about profiling, nor do I knowall there is to learn about profiling. Equally, the computer doesn’t have thebenefit of “experience” – whereas we humans do. So I look on PROFILER as onemore tool to use when completing what has to be a carefully thought out,fine-tuning process.’At the NCAVC there is total belief in the fine-tuning process called CIAP, theCriminal Investigative Analysis Programme, which has successfully wedded humanand computerised techniques. ‘By the end of this year (1989), we will expect tohave dealt with more than seven hundred cases’, says McCrary. ‘That doesn’t meanseven hundred serial murder cases, and in any event not all serial murder casesrequire profiling. For example, if the law enforcement agency already have asuspect, they don’t need a profile. But they might still ask us for a“personality assessment”.’ (A situation in which, without knowing the identityof the suspect, a profiler uses the behavioural analysis technique to answer thequestion – is the suspect capable of such a crime?) The BSIS wing at Quanticofurnished such an assessment in the case of Robert Hansen, the Alaskan big-gamehunter and serial killer who stalked his human victims gun in hand as if theywere wild animals (see here [../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_68]).‘We may also be asked for specific investigative strategies, and/or interviewtechniques,’ he said. ‘At other times we may give on-site assistance during theinvestigation. Some cases we deal with will be over quickly, others will provemore difficult. All of it is time-consuming, a heavy workload at times. Oneanalyst may find himself involved in fifteen or even twenty cases – and that’spressure. But we’re in the young stages of this whole analysis process as yet;and I firmly believe that we’re headed in the right direction, and that this isthe way to do it.’We catch a glimpse of the pressure that faces everyone in the ‘operational wing’the moment we step inside McCrary’s office. A mass of paperwork relating to onemore homicide – police report, photographic evidence, pathologist’s report,forensic details, and victimology – waits on his desk alongside his computer,telephone, notepad, legal and investigative reference works, et al. This newinvestigation centres on a torso murder, one in which the nude, headless,legless body of an adult white male was discovered – wrapped in a tarpaulin anddumped at a lay-by for truck drivers – on Route 8, south of Torrington in upperConnecticut. The police investigation has encountered problems, and they havesubmitted a VICAP crime report requesting a profile; a task assigned to SSAMcCrary. After studying the relevant documents, discussing every feature of thecase at daily group conference, and consulting with various NCAVC residentadvisory specialists, McCrary furnished the police with a profile. The‘Template’ is still awaited from the master VICAP computer at FBI headquartersin Washington.Because this is an ongoing case, no details of the profile can be disclosed. Weknow, however, that it will have listed some twenty or more components,including the age, sex, race, marital status (or equivalent), IQ, school andcollege grades, and the ‘rearing environment’ of the type of offenderresponsible; plus personality traits, life-style, demeanour, appearance andgrooming, the kind of job he holds and past employment history, his behaviourduring the murder, from Phase One (his meeting with the targeted victim) toPhase Four (disposal of the body, after dismemberment and mutilation); where theoffender lives in relation to the body disposal site, his motive for the murder– everything bar his name.Even so, the early signs indicate that this may prove to be one of the ‘moredifficult’ homicides to solve. Connecticut, where the body was dumped, coversmore than 5,000 square miles in area: not nearly as big as Texas, say, orCalifornia (or most states), but still the size of Northern Ireland. And if infact Connecticut turns out to be where the unknown killer lives – one of theprofiling decisions McCrary has to make – to track him down is never going to beeasy. In this case the task is further complicated by the fact that the murderedman (whom the police have identified as a known homosexual, aged twenty-six,with convictions for both prostitution and burglary) was also transient, and onboth counts a ‘high risk’ victim – a homosexual hitchhiker. He set off on hislast hike from Nevada – almost the entire breadth of the United States away –nine days before his body was found, hitching lifts mainly from truck drivers.At what point along the route he was picked up, propositioned, attacked andmurdered is uncertain: a vital profiling component, which will have called for avery finely-tuned decision by SSA McCrary.Every twist and turn in this torso murder analysis would seem to provideseemingly obvious behavioural clues, yet equally evident contradictions. Forexample: the victim’s head and legs are both missing, while the torso has beenmutilated by emasculation and removal of the nipples. Even to the untrainedobserver, it would seem logical to assume that this combined dismemberment andmutilation must have taken hours to perform. In turn this would appear to be aclear indication that the murder was pre-meditated and methodicallythought-through, even though the victim was one of opportunity. To execute sucha crime successfully would necessitate a secure base, where the offender knowshe will be able to work undisturbed during those hours of surgery; and he willneed more time afterwards to wash away all traces of his sawbones task – and tohide the incriminating body-parts – before setting out to dispose of the torso.The place best suited for such a lengthy and potentially risky chore wouldobviously be the killer’s home and/or workplace. As we have shown, one of theprofiler’s first tasks is to calculate where the offender lives in relation tothe scene of the crime. In this case, only the body disposal site is known thusfar: in itself a not uncommon feature in homicide investigations. But what isdoubly baffling (in behavioural terms) is why the murderer first‘de-personalised’ his victim (by severing and retaining the head), only to dumpthe body in a truckers’ lay-by on a main road, thus ensuring it would be foundwith the least possible delay. Furthermore, why compound the felony, literally,by deliberately leaving the victim’s arms (and more importantly, his hands)attached to the torso – as if to invite identification by fingerprinting?There are a number of possible reasons why a lust killer – which is clearly whatthis offender is – may remove and retain his victim’s head. One might be thatthe murderer is a ‘souvenir’ collector, a psychopath who stores selected bodyparts to re-live at will the violent fantasy which first inspired the crime. Butthat would not explain the apparent behavioural contradiction in first‘de-personalising’ the victim, only to ensure his identification at the earliestpossible moment. By the same token, no matter why he beheaded his victim itcannot have been to thwart identification. Nor is this apparent contradictionthe product of a confused mind. The modus operandi shows this to be ameticulously planned murder, patently the work of an ‘organised’ offender –which points to a causative decision, and one more riddle for the analyst tofathom.At this moment, the telephone rings to involve McCrary in yet another serialmurder enquiry – thus rendering all questions on the torso case superfluous.(The ten senior analysts in the BSIS wing are each allotted a separate nationalarea of responsibility. In normal circumstances, all serial cases reported inthat area are automatically assigned to the analyst concerned; while the initialreport of each new case will come in one of two ways – mostly from VICAP crimereturns, but sometimes through direct calls to the NCAVC.) Today’s direct callcomes from another state in SSA McCrary’s ‘area of responsibility’ – RhodeIsland, Connecticut’s eastern neighbour.The caller identifies himself as a psychiatrist who has been asked to take partin a televised discussion of the triple murder ten days earlier of housewife MrsJoan Heaton, aged thirty-nine, and her daughters Jennifer, ten, and Melissa,eight, at their home in Metropolitan Drive, Warwick, Rhode Island. All threewere found dead from multiple stab wounds, and also suffered severe blows to thehead and body, following a break-in. Preliminary medical tests showed noevidence of sexual assault. According to press reports, the police have found notrace of the offender or the murder weapon, despite house-to-house enquiries.Local residents fear that this triple murder is the work of an unknown serialkiller – the same person responsible for the unsolved murder, two years earlier(in July 1987) and one street away, in which twenty-seven-year-old RebeccaSpencer, also the mother of two children, was found stabbed to death in her homeafter a break-in. Can the NCAVC help?Because of the similarities in the two events, SSA McCrary – who has notreceived the all-important VICAP crime report – checks out the call. First herings the FBI’s Field Profiling Co-ordinator for the area. That brings welcomenews: the co-ordinator has already spoken with the local police, who haverequested a profile. Their VICAP report, together with the relevant documentaryevidence, will shortly be on its way to the NCAVC. McCrary himself then callsthe local Captain of Police to discuss various aspects of the case, and reportsthe facts in his turn at the BSIS group conference.Within six days of the initial phone call to McCrary, the police at Warwick,Rhode Island, had their suspect in custody – and a confession to all fourmurders. In order of events: on receipt of the police report, crime sceneevidence, forensic details and VICAP report, analyst McCrary furnished a profileby return of a youthful, black offender who lived within walking distance of theHeaton family home. He said this was the type of offender who came from adomestic background of a weak or absent father-figure and dominant femaleinfluence, and would have a police record of ‘Peeping Tom’ prowling activity. Hewould also, said McCrary, be the kind of offender who takes and retainssouvenirs of his crime. The detectives in Warwick, who from the outset believedthe two ‘events’ to be the work of one murderer, now used the BSIS profile as ascreening mechanism.As soon as they identified a suspect who matched the profile components, McCraryprovided an interview strategy. Within hours Craig Price – a burly, coloured,fifteen-year-old high school student standing five feet ten inches tall andweighing two hundred and forty pounds (seventeen stone) – confessed both to theHeaton murders, and that of Rebecca Spencer in 1987. A search warrant wasobtained and – as predicted in the profile – a knife, thought to be the murderweapon, and certain other items (believed to be ‘souvenirs’ but not publiclyidentified) were recovered.As well as demonstrating the efficiency both of FBI analysts and the NCAVC’sCriminal Investigative Analysis Programme, the Heaton-Spencer serial murder caselooks set to make legal history in the United States. When Craig Price appearedbefore Judge Carmine R. DePetrillo in Kent County Family (‘Juvenile’) Court on21 September 1989, he admitted killing Mrs Joan Heaton, her two daughters, andRebecca Spencer. In an adult court he would have faced charges of first-degreemurder. However, because Price was under sixteen at the time all four murderswere committed (he was aged thirteen when he knifed Rebecca Spencer), he wascharged with ‘delinquency, by reason of murder’. The four homicides and tworelated burglaries were entered as evidence of his ‘delinquency’.Under the existing laws of Rhode Island, no matter how many murders a childunder sixteen may commit, he or she may be detained only until theirtwenty-first birthday – when they are automatically freed. Furthermore, in nocircumstances may any child adjudged to be ‘delinquent’ be sent to an adultcorrective institution. Accordingly, Judge DePetrillo ordered Price to bedetained in state training school (for treatment and rehabilitation) until theage of twenty-one. Ironically, twenty-one is the age at which serial killers arereckoned to be entering their prime years as mulitple murderers; so the Pricecase aroused considerable public concern.Earlier attempts, in 1988 and 1989, to introduce legislation which would enablejuveniles charged with a capital offence to be tried in adult court, regardlessof their age, were defeated in the Rhode Island General Assembly. However, afterthe Price Family Court hearing, Representative Jeffrey J. Tietz – chairman ofthe House of Representatives’ Judiciary Committee – said that reform of thestate juvenile justice laws would be one of his committee’s ‘highest priorities’in the next session. Should such legislative reform be proposed, it will almostcertainly mean calling FBI Behavioural Science Unit experts at the NCAVC totestify on their research into the behavioural characteristics of serial killersgenerally, including their development years and their response – if any – toattempted rehabilitation.There is increasing international interest in the achievements of the NCAVCduring its first five years of operational life. By September 1989 there hadalready been enquiries about CIAP and its offspring computerised techniques fromAustralia, Canada, Britain, Norway, West Germany, Italy, the Caribbean,Singapore, Hong Kong, Costa Rica – and Communist China. (The Chinese request forinformation was put on ice following the Tiananmen Square massacre.) In August1989 two Australian officers started a ten-months profiling course in the BSISwing of the NCAVC, the first to be invited from any foreign country. WhileDonald Seaman was in Quantico an Italian police officer, attending anothertraining course at the FBI Academy, brought with him the documentary evidencerelating to the sixteen murders committed to date by ‘II Mostro’, the Monster ofFlorence (pp. 63–4). The police in Florence were later furnished with a profile.Under the aegis of the Home Office, British officials have also visited theNCAVC to evaluate the Criminal Investigative Analysis Programme and otherrelated techniques. Significantly, Douglas Hurd (then Home Secretary) told thePolice Superintendents’ Association at their Torquay conference in 1989 that thegovernment was considering the establishment in Britain of a national, FBI-stylecriminal intelligence unit. He said that although the proposed unit would not begiven operational powers like the FBI, ‘ . . . we should ask ourselves whetherthe increasing sophistication of major crime, whether the link between drugtrafficking and other crime, make it necessary to bring all criminalintelligence together in a national unit’.Agents of the Investigative Support wing of the NCAVC have had their setbacks aswell as successes in the past five years. By December 1989 the task forceinvestigating the Green River serial murder case in Seattle, Washington, wasthought to be on the point of disbandment after five years of continuous enquiry(aided by BSIS profiling and on-site FBI investigative support) at a minimumestimated cost of fifteen million dollars. The Green River case – in terms ofvictim count the worst known, unsolved, serial murder case in American crimehistory – involved the deaths or disappearance of some forty-nine women, mostlySeattle prostitutes, between 1982 and 1984. It took its name from the river areain King County, Washington, where the first five victims were found. All fivehad been strangled. Thereafter as each new victim was discovered, the cause ofdeath was recorded simply as homicidal violence; most were just heaps of bones.Only one man was arrested and named as a ‘viable’ suspect during the entireinvestigation. He was William Jay Stevens II, aged thirty-nine. He was arrestedin June 1989 following a tip-off prompted by the Manhunt TV screening of thecase. Despite lengthy interrogation, however, no murder charges were filedagainst him. Finally, in November 1989, the Green River Task Force commander andKing County police chief, Robert Evans, declared: ‘The guy is a prolific thiefand a world-class liar, but after we looked at everything we took’ – a referenceto a police search of Stevens’ quarters – ‘and interviewed everybody we couldinterview, I can’t tell you in good conscience I think he’s responsible for anymurders in King County.’ Whoever murdered the forty-nine Green River victims wasthought to have posed as a police officer to lure them to their deaths. Stevenshimself was subsequently transferred into custody in Arizona, to await trial oncharges arising from the cache of twenty-nine handguns, video films and items ofpolice equipment found during the search of his quarters. (See Chapter 9 for afull description and eventual conclusion to the Green River Killer case.)One senior FBI agent who took part in the Green River investigtion was thelegendary profiler, SSA John Douglas. It almost killed him. The pressure of toomany cases over too many years finally caught up with him in Seattle in 1983,and fellow agents found him in a state of collapse suffering from paralysis ofthe left side, a temperature of 105, and a pulse rate of 220. Doctors diagnosedviral encephalitis, and rated his chances of survival as slim. Douglas provedthem wrong. After two months in hospital, and five more convalescing, hereturned to duty. Today he is manager of the Criminal Investigative AnalysisProgramme in the ‘operational wing’ of the NCAVC – with his matchless skills asa profiler available at every session of the BSIS daily group conference (seefootnote p. 111).SSA McCrary spoke about the stress that goes hand-in-hand with profiling. ‘Afterreviewing the case material in detail, we often visit the significant sites – bywhich I mean abduction and/or murder scenes, if known, or the body recoverysites – to familiarise ourselves with the areas in which the killer worked. Theend result is the construction of our analysis, including a profile of the typeof offender responsible . . . But when you first arrive at the scene of a seriesof ongoing murders, you enter a pressure-cooker environment. The stress isalmost palpable, and it transfers to you all too easily. Even though we’retalking about mental effort, it leaves you physically drained: exhausted.’For McCrary, 1989 ended and 1990 began with a non-stop round of serial murderinvestigation. Some new cases took him overseas, to the Caribbean and CentralAmerica. The majority were in the United States, in his eastern ‘area ofresponsibility’. His busiest spell came in what was intended as a week off inup-state New York, between Christmas and New Year. On 22 December 1989 theHarris family of four – Mr Warren A. ‘Tony’ Harris, aged thirty-nine, his wifeDolores, forty-one, and their children, Shelby, fifteen and Marc, eleven – werefound murdered in their home on Ellis Hollow Road, Ithaca, at the foot of LakeCayuga. All had been shot in the back of the head with a small-calibre handgun,doused with petrol and set ablaze. Three of them were bound. A VICAP report,requesting a profile, was sent to the NCAVC – and McCrary was assigned to theinvestigation, aided by Lieutenant John Edward Grant of the New York statepolice ‘special services’ unit at divisional headquarters (who had previouslyundergone training with the Behavioural Science Unit at Quantico).On 30 December 1989 the Ithaca Journal headlined their arrival in a front-pagelead story: ‘FBI agents called in. “A Team” assigned to Harris murder.’ Shortlyafterwards – and unknown to the readers – the newly arrived ‘A Team’, led by SSAMcCrary, profiled the type of offender responsible as black, male, aged betweenthe late twenties and early thirties, with a criminal record of burglary andarmed robbery. The profile also said he lived in the area, in rented property,possibly with a white woman.On 7 February 1990, after using the profile as their screening mechanism andcarrying arrest and search warrants, New York state police entered a house inIthaca. The man they hoped to question chose to open fire instead. No policewere injured, but the suspect died in an exchange of shots. He was thirty-threeyears of age, black, and had a criminal record for burglary and armed robbery. A.22 handgun (later identified by ballistic experts as the weapon used to executethe Harris family) was recovered. Subsequent enquiries revealed that the gunmanhad a common-law relationship with a white woman, a few miles away.The age of the serial killer is always the most difficult component to gaugewhen furnishing a profile. In the BSIS wing they take the age of twenty-five asa starting-point, then add or subtract years on the basis of the ‘experience’they adjudge to be reflected in the crime scene evidence. The aim is to reducethe profiled age to a span of seven years or less. The problem they face is thattheir decision has to be calculated from the offender’s mental and emotional ageas distinct from his chronological age, which may prove to be very different.Because of this possible variant, each profile carries a caution that no suspectshould be eliminated on the basis of age alone. (We see a clear example of theage ‘variant’ in the case of the British serial killer Kenneth Erskine, aliasthe Stockwell Strangler. Erskine was twenty-four at the time of his trial in1988: police revealed later that he had a mental age of only eleven.) FBIanalysts take twenty-five as a starting-point because statistics show thatincipient serial killers usually – but by no means always – commit their firstmurder when aged between twenty-five and thirty.The McCrary-led ‘A Team’ gave on-site assistance during the holiday period intwo other, unrelated serial murder investigations in up-state New York: one atWindsor, the other at Rochester. The Rochester case concerned the unsolvedmurders of eleven prostitutes – all ‘high risk’ victims because of the nature oftheir trade, a factor which makes profiling more than usually difficult. On thisoccasion the profile said that the unknown killer would return to the scene ofthe crime (pp. 70–1). He did. Following his arrest by the Rochester police, theastonished offender led his captors to the spot where two of his victims wereburied.Such accurate profiling seems almost uncanny to most outsiders. In fact it isbased squarely on the far-sighted, meticulous research which began in theclassrooms of the FBI Academy at Quantico, at the persuasion of Howard Teten andhis handful of fellow instructors in the early 1970s – and blossomed into themass survey of thirty-six convicted, incarcerated, sex killers carried out byagents of the FBI, under the aegis of the Behavioural Science Unit, between 1979and 1983. Among the more meaningful behavioural characteristics which theyexamined in offenders were their ‘rearing environment’, their history ofphysical, sexual and psychological abuse, the influence of violent, sexualisedfantasy on their adult lives, their unnatural preference for ‘solo sex’(masturbation), and their failure during the critical development years tofulfil their academic promise.Their rejection of family ties made them self-centred loners. They blamed theirown failures on an unjust world, in which their hatred for society flourishednaturally. Their response to the physical, psychological and/or sexual abusethey encountered in their formative years was to inflict it on others: first intheir fantasy world, and then – as the fantasies grew increasingly violent – ondumb animals and finally, people. Their rejection of normal relationships led tomasturbation as an outlet; an unnatural preference stimulated by pornography and‘Peeping Tom’ activity and ending, inevitably, in sexual assault. The wholeinterwoven pattern of unreasoning hatred of society, violent fantasy and sexualimmaturity fused eventually into an overwhelming desire to dominate others – byforce.And murder, say the analysts, is the ultimate expression of this ‘will to power,or desire to control’ (see here [../Text/chapter_002.xhtml#page_71]).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/chapter_003.xhtml#fn001] George Metesky did not stand trial for thebombings.

Freud once commented that achild would destroy the world if it had the power. In this sense, the mind ofthe serial killer is that of a child. Fantasy takes precedence over actuality.And the fantasy is about power.This fact was noted by agent Robert R.Hazelwood, of the FBI Behavioural ScienceUnit. ‘One individual we talked to had a very ritualistic method of operation.For example, he would select six victims in advance. On the evening he woulddecide to rape one of the victims he would put on his “going-in clothes”, as hereferred to them: an oversize pair of tennis shoes to confuse the police, baggynondescript coveralls, a ski mask and work gloves. He would then enter theresidence and stand by the victim’s bed and count from one to ten in incrementsof one half. And then he would leap on the victim, rape her, and thenimmediately leave after tying her up. And when I asked him why he counted toten, he stated that he was putting off the rape. And I said: “I don’tunderstand.” And he said: “Rape is the least enjoyable part of the entirecrime.” I asked him: “In that case, why didn’t you just turn around and leave atthat point?” And he stated to me: “Pardon the pun, Mr Hazelwood, but after allI’d gone through to get there, it would have been a crime not to have rapedher.”‘Now the actual time he spent with the victim was less than two minutes. He toldus this was the least enjoyable part of the entire crime. Which substantiatesthe fact that sexual assault services non-sexual needs – it’s power needs, it’sanger needs, and the need for control.’This sounds an incredible statement. After all, we know that some rapists spendhours with the victim, raping her again and again. It can only be understood ifwe remember that ‘self-esteem’ crime is a fairly recent phenomenon. It springsout of the desire for ‘recognition’, a craving to ‘become known’ – or at least,to feel that you deserve to become known. When Hazelwood speaks of the need forcontrol, he is not referring simply to control over the victim. This type ofcriminal has a sense of inadequacy, of inferiority, which produces a burningfeeling of resentment. The crime relieves his anger and produces a sense ofpower, of being ‘worthwhile’, of being in control of himself. As strange as itsounds, such crimes are an attempt to leave behind his immaturity and to growup. When rape is involved, sex is not the prime objective. The prime objectiveis to feel himself the master – of himself and other people, and to hope thatsome of this feeling will stay with him.A case that received nationwide publicity in America in 1985 is perhaps theclassic illustration of the power syndrome.On 19 May 1977 a twenty-year-old girl named Colleen Stan set out to hitchhikefrom Eugene, Oregon, to Westwood in Northern California, where she intended tohelp a friend celebrate her birthday. At Red Bluff, a young couple in a blueDodge offered her a lift; the woman had a baby on her knee, and her husband wasa mild, bespectacled individual. Half an hour or so later, in a filling-stationrestroom, Colleen had an odd intuition that she was in danger and ought toescape; unfortunately she ignored it. When the young couple suggested turningoff the main road to look at some ice caves in a national park, Colleen raisedno objection. When the car stopped in a lonely place, the man placed a knife toher throat, then handcuffed her hands behind her back. He placed a strap roundher head and tightened it under her jaw so she could not open her mouth. Then hebound her, and placed a peculiar wooden box over her head. It had obviously beenpurpose-made, and when it had been closed it left her in total darkness, hardlyable to breathe.Hours later, the man took her into the cellar of a house, and stripped hernaked. His motive was not rape. Instead, he suspended her from the ceiling withleather straps, and whipped her. Then the man and his wife had sexualintercourse beneath her feet. Later, the ‘head box’ was again clamped round herneck, and she was placed in a large wooden box, about three feet high, andlocked in for the night. He also placed a ‘prickly object’ between her thighs.It was designed to give her an electric shock, but failed to work.The next day she was chained by her ankles to a rack, and given food. When sheshowed no appetite, he hung her from the beam again and whipped her until shewas unconscious. Later the man made her use a bedpan, which he himself emptied.Then the headbox was clamped on again and she was locked up in the box.This went on for weeks. When she became dirty and unkempt, he made her climbinto the bath. He raised her knees and held her head under water until she beganto choke. He did this over and over again, taking snapshots of the naked,choking girl in between. After that, her female jailer tried to comb her hair,then gave up and snipped off the knots and tangles with scissors.The man’s name was Cameron Hooker, and he had been born in 1953. He was a shy,skinny boy who had no close friends. When he left school he went to work as alabourer in a local lumbermill. His only reading was pornography, particularlythe kind that dealt with flagellation and bondage. His daydream was to flog nudewomen who were tied with leather straps. When he was nineteen, he met a plain,shy fifteen-year-old named Janice. She was delighted and grateful to be askedout by this quiet, polite youth who drove his own car and treated her withrespect. So far she had fallen in love with boys who had ignored her or treatedher badly; in fact, the worse they treated her, the more she adored them.Cameron Hooker was marvellously different. When he explained that he wanted totake her into the woods and hang her up from a tree, she was frightened butcompliant. It hurt her wrists, but he was so affectionate when he took her downthat she felt it was worth it. In 1975 they married, and she continued to submitto strange demands, which included tying her up, making her wear a rubber gasmask, and choking her until she became unconscious. Finally, he told her of hisdream of kidnapping a girl and using her as his ‘slave’. Eventually, she agreed.She wanted a baby, and longed to live a normal life; perhaps if Cameron had a‘slave’, he would stop wanting to whip and throttle her. It sounds incrediblebut, as we shall see later, such total compliance of a medium-dominance woman toa high-dominance male is by no means unusual.That is how it came about that Colleen Stan was kidnapped on that May afternoonin 1977, and taken to their basement in Oak Street, Red Bluff, where she was tospend the next seven years.After a month or so, Janice felt she could no longer stand it. The idea ofholding someone captive sickened her. What was worse was that the captive was anattractive girl. Even though her husband had agreed that there would be no sexbetween him and his ‘slave’, it was obvious that he was deriving from Colleenthe same sexual satisfaction that he derived from tying up his wife. Janicedecided to weaken the ties with her husband. She went to stay with a sister, andfound herself a job in Silicon Valley. She returned every weekend, but thisbrought about the situation she had been trying to avoid. Left alone with his‘slave’ for the whole week, Cameron Hooker gave way to temptation. He madeColleen perform oral sex on him, reasoning that he was not going back on hisbargain so long as there was no vaginal intercourse. He also burned her with aheat lamp, administered electric shocks, and throttled her until she blackedout. Six months after the kidnap, he started giving her small tasks, such asshelling walnuts or doing crochet. The Hookers sold the results of her laboursin the local flea market.In January 1981, Hooker discovered an article in an ‘underground’ newspaperabout a company of white slavers who made girls sign a slavery contract, anddecided that Colleen should do the same. And on 25 January Colleen was made tosign a long document declaring that she handed herself over, body and soul, toher Master, Michael Powers (alias Cameron Hooker). She had to agree to obeyevery order cheerfully and instantly, to maintain her body parts in such a waythat they should always be open to him – for example, she was never to wearpanties, and to make sure that, when in the Master’s presence, she always kepther knees apart. Finally, after protest, Colleen signed – and was told that hernew name was Kay – or K – Powers.Now she was allowed to come upstairs and help with household chores, but ifCameron came in and shouted ‘Attention’, she had to strip off her clothes andstand on tiptoe with her hands above her head. Soon after this, Janice herselfsuggested to her husband that he should have sex with his slave. Perhaps shewould hoping that he would cite his original agreement and refuse; in fact, hepromptly brought Colleen up from the basement, spreadeagled her naked on thebed, with a gag in her mouth and her wrists and ankles tied to the corners, thenraped her. Janice, meanwhile, rushed off to vomit in the bathroom. After that,Colleen was put back in the box.A point came when he decided that he would prefer to live in a more secludedplace. He gave notice of leaving to his landlord, and bought a trailer on someland beyond the city limits. Nearby ran the Interstate 5 highway – which, in twoyears time, would earn itself a new and sinister significance as its name becameassociated with a random serial murderer known as the I.5 killer. Underneath alarge waterbed, Hooker constructed a kind of large rabbit hutch, which was to beColleen’s home. Colleen was moved in – blindfolded and handcuffed – oneafternoon, and immediately confined in her new quarters.Now life became a little freer. She was let out for an hour or so every day toperform her ablutions and help with the chores. She made no attempt to escape –Hooker had told her all kinds of horror stories about what happened to ‘Company’slaves who tried to run away: having their fingers chopped off one by one wasthe least of them. To remind her that she was his slave he periodically hung herfrom the ceiling and flogged her with a whip. He also burned her breasts withlighted matches. There were compensations. In the autumn, Hooker went up intothe mountains to cut wood on the land of the company that employed him; he tookhis slave with him. He made her work; he also made her swim in a pond and runalong a dirt road. When she was ‘disobedient’, he tied her down on a kind ofmediaeval rack and ‘stretched’ her. This excited him so much that he strippednaked and made her perform oral sex. On another occasion he raped her on the‘rack’. Janice was not told of these sexual episodes. Soon after this, the slavewas made to drink most of a bottle of wine, then to perform oral sex on Janice;it made her sick.Early in 1980, after nearly three years of captivity, Colleen was allowed anamazing excursion. She was permitted to dress up in some of Janice’s clothes,make up her face, and accompany Janice to a dance. There they met two men andwent home with them. Janice vanished into the bedroom with one of them, whileColleen stayed talking to the other. Cameron Hooker apparently suspectednothing, and his wife’s liaison continued for the next two months, until itfizzled out. After that, Janice, still unsuspected, had another short affair.Colleen was also allowed more freedom – she was allowed to go out and jog on herown. Incredibly, she still made no attempt to escape – Hooker had brainwashedher into seeing herself as a well-behaved and loyal slave. As a reward forobedience, she was allowed to write to her sister – without, of course,including a return address – and even, on one occasion, to telephone her family,with Hooker standing beside her monitoring everything she said. She told themshe was living with a couple who were ‘looking after her’. When they wanted toknow more, her Master made her hang up. Soon after that he took her on a visitto his own family, on their ranch outside town. This passed off so well that hedecided to take the ultimate risk, and allow her to go and see her own parents,who lived in Riverside, Southern California. In March 1981, he drove her toSacramento, and ordered her to wait in the car while he went into an officeblock that belonged to the sinister Company who owned her. When he came back, hetold her they had granted permission to visit her family. The visit to Riversidewas brief, but went off perfectly. Hooker was introduced as her fiancé Mike, whowas on his way to a computer seminar. Colleen Stan spent the night in herfather’s home, then visited her mother – who lived elsewhere – without divulgingwhere she had been for four years, or why she had failed to keep in touch. Thefollowing day, her Master rang her and announced he would be arriving in tenminutes to take her home. Colleen was upset that Hooker had broken his promiseto allow her to spend a full weekend with her family, and sulked all the wayback to Red Bluff. When they got back, the Master decided that enough wasenough. The slave’s period of liberty came to an end, and she was put back intothe box.This period lasted another three years, from 1981 until 1984. On one occasion,out of sheer frustration, she kicked out the end of the box and climbed out. Shehad no thought of running away – the Company would be sure to track her down.Oddly enough, when Hooker came home from work he was not angry, as she expected,but simply repaired the box.The relationship between Hooker and his wife was becoming increasingly tense –she disliked being tied up and whipped. At one point she left him for a few daysand went to stay with her brother. When she came back, she and Cameron had along, honest talk; she confessed about her two early affairs – her husbandseemed indifferent – while he admitted that he had been having sex with Colleen.(This deeply upset Janice.) Then, in an attempt to repair their marriage, theybegan reading the Bible together. Colleen had already found refuge in thereligion of her childhood, and now she joined in the prayer sessions. Cameron,meanwhile, worked on a kind of underground bunker that would be a dungeon forthe slave. It was completed in November 1983, and then Colleen was installed.When the winter rains came, howerer, the dungeon began to fill with water, andthey had to take her out again and let her back indoors.Janice and Colleen, whose relationship in the past had often been stormy –Janice was inclined to boss her around – had now become close friends as well asfellow Bible students. Cameron Hooker still flogged his slave – on Companyorders – but was also treating her better, giving her more food, and allowingher to babysit with his two daughters. And in May 1984, seven years after herabduction, he sent her out to find a job. She was hired at a local motel as amaid, and proved to be such a hard worker that she soon received promotion. Oneday, another maid offered her a lift home, and went into the mobile home; shewas puzzled when Colleen told her that a small backpack contained everything shepossessed. Cameron Hooker came home while Colleen, Janice and the maid weretalking, and stared at them with such hostility that the maid felt uncomfortableand left.Colleen believed implicitly that she was the slave of ‘the Company’; she oftenmentioned it to Janice, and Janice felt increasingly guilty and uncomfortable athaving to support her husband’s lies. Her new religious faith made it difficult.It became harder still when she and Colleen – with Cameron’s permission – beganto go to the local church together. Cameron tried to turn the Bible to his ownadvantage, quoting the passage from Genesis in which Abraham went to bed withhis wife’s maid Hagar, and suggesting that Janice should take the same liberalattitude towards Colleen. As usual, he finally got his way; he even persuadedJanice to share the bed, and entertain him with lesbian acts with Colleen.Janice was so upset by the new situation that she asked Cameron to strangle her– something he did frequently, but only to the point of unconsciousness. Heagreed, but either lost courage, or was suddenly struck by the thought of theinconvenience of disposing of the body; at all events, Janice woke up to findherself still alive.On 9 August 1984 Janice made her decision. She went to speak to Colleen at work,and told her the truth: that there was no ‘Company’, that she was not a slave,that Cameron was merely a pervert. Colleen was stunned. Her first reaction wasto quit her job. Then she and Janice called on the pastor of their church, andgave him a confused outline of the story. He advised them to leave Hooker. Butit was too late in the day for Colleen to take a bus to her family in Riverside.Instead, they picked Cameron up from work as usual, and went back to the mobilehome. That night Janice pleaded that she felt ill, and she and Colleen slept onthe floor together. As soon as Cameron had gone to work at 5 a.m, they beganpacking, and fled to the home of Janice’s parents. Colleen wired her father toask him to send her a hundred dollars. The next day she took the bus to southernCalifornia. Before she left, she telephoned Cameron to tell him that she knew hehad always lied to her, and that she was leaving; he cried. Then Colleen wenthome to begin a new life.For Janice, there was no new life. Cameron begged her to go back to him,promising to reform, and she gave in. But she took him to see the pastor, whoadvised him to burn his pornography and bondage equipment. He said he would. Heeven kept his promise, and made a bonfire of them in the back yard, but within ashort time he began building up his collection of porno magazines again.Meanwhile, back in Riverside, Colleen had told her family about her seven-yearordeal. She rejected the idea of going to the police. She and Janice had talkedover the telephone – they kept in touch daily – and Colleen agreed that Camerondeserved another chance. She even talked to Cameron and agreed not to go to thepolice. With his wife back at home and his former slave in Riverside, he musthave felt perfectly safe.Janice had now found another confidante – a doctor’s receptionist. It was to herthat, on 7 November 1984, she finally poured out the truth. Her new friend senther back to talk to the pastor. And the pastor, when he finally heard the wholestory, talked her into ringing the police.What Janice Hooker had to tell them was not simply the story of Colleen Stan’sseven-year ordeal. She had been keeping a more sinister secret. In January 1976,more than a year before Colleen had been abducted, they had offered a lift to agirl in the nearby town of Chico. She told them her name was Marliz Spannhake,and that she was eighteen years old. When the time came to drop her off at herapartment, Cameron had grabbed her and driven off to a lonely spot, where thegirl had been tied up, and her head clamped in the ‘head box’. Back at home,Hooker stripped off her clothes and hung her from the ceiling. Then, perhaps tostop her screams, he cut her vocal cords with a knife. He tortured her byshooting her in the abdomen with a pellet gun, and finally strangled her. In theearly hours of the morning, they drove into the mountains, and Hooker buriedMarliz Spannhake in a shallow grave.The police were able to verify that a girl named Marie Elizabeth Spannhake hadvanished one evening in January 1976; but although Janice accompanied them upinto the mountains, they were unable to locate the grave. That meant that therewas not enough evidence to charge Cameron Hooker with murder. Two detectivesflew down to Riverside to interview Colleen Stan, and as they listened to thestory of her seven years of torment, they soon realised that they had enoughevidence to guarantee Cameron Hooker several years in jail. Hooker was arrestedon 18 November 1984.The trial, which began on 24 September 1985, made nationwide headlines; the ‘SexSlave’ case seemed specially designed to sell newspapers. The jurors learnedthat Hooker was to be tried on sixteen counts, including kidnapping, rape,sodomy, forced oral copulation and penetration with a foreign object. Theprosecutor, Christine McGuire, had hoped to be able to introduce the Spannhakemurder as corroborative evidence of Hooker’s propensity to torture, but hadfinally agreed to drop it if Hooker would plead guilty to kidnapping. Hooker’sattorney, Rolland Papendick, made no attempt to deny that Colleen Stan wasabducted against her will, but argred that she had soon been free to leave, andthat she had stayed voluntarily. The evidence, he said, showed that Colleenloved Cameron, and had stayed for that reason. His argument was that Janice hadregarded Colleen as a rival who would supplant her, and had therefore told herabout ‘the Company’ to get rid of her. Even after her return to Riverside, saidPapendick, Colleen had frequently telephoned Cameron Hooker. And that is why,suspecting that Cameron meant to desert her and move to Riverside, Janice hadfinally decided to turn him in. In the witness box, Janice admitted that sheknew Colleen was in love with Cameron, and that she wanted to have a baby. Thejury’s sympathy was obviously beginning to waver towards Cameron. But when adoctor described the scars on Colleen’s wrists, ankles and thighs – includingelectric burn marks – and a psychiatrist talked about brainwashing, it began toswing in the other direction. Even so, when the prosection and defence hadpresented their closing arguments, the case seemed balanced on a knife edge. On29 October 1985 the jury retired; on 31 October – Hallowe’en – they filed in todeliver their verdict. Cameron Hooker had been found guilty on ten counts,including kidnapping, rape and torture. On 22 November Judge Clarence B. Knightdelivered the sentence. After describing Cameron Hooker as ‘the most dangerouspsychopath that I have ever dealt with’, he sentenced him to several terms ofimprisonment amounting to a hundred and four years.One question remains unanswered – the question that Christine McGuire raises onthe last page of her book about the case, Perfect Victim: how did Cameron Hookerdevelop his peculiar taste for torturing women? She has an interesting commentfrom someone on the case who wished to remain anonymous:‘People like to believe in an Einstein or a Beethoven – geniuses – but they hateto believe in their opposites. A genius is a mutant, something unnatural. Butjust as some people are born with extra intelligence, others are born withoutmuch intelligence or without fingers or limbs or consciences. The human body isphenomenally complex, with trillions of cells, and trillions of things can gowrong. Cameron Hooker is a fluke, an accident of internal wiring. His instinctsare simply the opposite of yours and mine.’Many police officeers who have had to deal with serial killers would concur withthat analysis: that however old-fashioned and unsubtle it sounds, some peopleare simply born bad. Or, to put it less crudely, that some unknown hereditaryfactors cause some people to be naturally more vicious than others. But whilethis is undoubtedly true, the Quantico interviews with thirty-six killersdemonstrated that family background plays a crucial role. The interviewers noteda ‘high degree of instability’ in the family backgrounds, hostile or poorrelationship with the father, and physical and/or sexual abuse in childhood orteens. Another study1 [../Text/chapter_004.xhtml#ft001] pointed out that a largeproportion of criminals are ‘highly sexed’ in childhood, and have peeped inthrough bathroom keyholes on females undressing, or initiated sexual games –sometimes amounting to rape – with girls at school.Equally important is the fact that, as every psychiatrist knows, sexualperversions seldom appear fully fledged; they sprout, like seeds, from smallbeginnings. In his book Sex Perversions and Sex Crimes, James Melvin Reinhardtcites a typical case of a urophile – a man who liked to sniff and drink women’surine – who began (as a child) simply by being sexually attracted by littlegirls. One day after he had seen a little girl urinating, he lay down on theground and sniffed the spot, masturbating at the same time. The taste thusinitiated finally developed into an obsession with female urine. We can seeclearly that it was merely a matter of association of ideas. Reinhardt goes onto point out that the same thing applies to sadism and masochism: that they aresimply a development of ‘moral and aesthetic sensitivities that are ordinarilyprevalent in a reasonably well socialised man’. He cited the case of a patientwhose masochism dated from the day – when he was seven years old – when amaidservant encouraged him to fondle her feet and toes. Then he experiencedorgasm while watching a poodle licking the toes of a maid while she was reading.One day he persuaded the maid to allow him to lick her toes, and againexperienced an ejaculation. This led to fantasies of being beaten and humiliatedby women. If the maid had asked him to bite or scratch her instead of fondlingher toes, it is conceivable that he might have developed into a sadist instead.Fantasy, Reinhardt believes, is the key to the development of sexual perversion.The perversion often has its origin in some casual incident, like themaidservant who enjoyed having her toes fondled. Since the fantasist feelsashamed of his autoerotic activities, he tends to avoid too much contact witheveryday reality, preferring to spend as much time as possible in the dreamworld inside his own head, and so fantasy reinforces itself and develops thoughlong sessions of autoerotic daydreaming. The daydreams are often given adirection by pornography. Eventually, a time may come when the dreamer feels thecompulsion to burst out of this world of unreality with some act that gives hima sensation of being truly alive. The following case is typical.In October 1975 Robert Poulin, an eighteen-year-old schoolboy, suddenly wentberserk with a shotgun in Ottawa; he entered a classroom at his school and shotseven students, afterwards blowing out his own brains in the corridor. In theroom where he lived – in the basement of his parents’ home – firemen called to ablaze found the charred naked body of seventeen-year-old schoolgirl Kim Rabat,who had been repeatedly raped and sodomised, then stabbed to death. She was agirl on whom Poulin was known to have a ‘crush’, and he had spoken to her at thebus stop that morning and persuaded her to go back to his room. A trail of sexmagazines running up the stairs revealed that the fire had been intended to burndown the house. Investigators also found his journals, which revealed that hehad spent the past two years daydreaming of sex and reading pornography. Sevenmonths before his suicide he had written: ‘I thought of committing suicide, butI don’t want to die before I have had the pleasure of fucking some girl.’ Heplanned to waylay a girl in a dark alleyway and force her to have sex atgunpoint – he even bought a model gun for that purpose. He also seems to havemade a few attempts to waylay a few girls in a local park – at least, he answersthe description of a youth who had been exposing himself and attempting sexualassault. Then he saw an advertisement for a blow-up life-size doll, and wrote:‘I no longer think that I will have to rape a girl’. When he bought the doll, itproved to be a disappointment, and he went back to his schemes for rape,culminating in the morning that he spent violating Kim Rabat. He left no recordof his feeling after the rape, but it seems safe to assume that he found thereality totally unlike his daydreams.Why did Poulin, unlike most sexually frustrated young men, turn to rape andmurder? The inquest revealed all the essential clues. Poulin had been consideredby everyone who knew him a perfectly normal youth, quiet and intelligent. (Thebook about him – by Christopher Cobb and Bob Avery – is called Rape of a NormalMind.) But there had been a great deal of parental conflict, particularly withhis father, an ex-Air-Force pilot with a disciplinary obsession, now aschoolteacher. Poulin felt deep hatred for his family, and had consideredkilling them all. The fact that he lived alone in a basement that was separatefrom the rest of the house – and had done so since he was twelve – is a measureof his failure to communicate with the rest of the family (which included threesisters but no brother) or theirs to communicate with him. His father’sinterests were military, and he wanted Robert to follow suit. In fact, Roberthad decided that he wanted to enter the Royal Military College in Kingston whenhe left school. A few days before the murder, he had been turned down forofficer training. This disappointment – and the thought that he would not beable to escape from his family after all – was clearly what motivated thedecision to rape and kill. It could be seen as a form of suicide, but, as theinvestigators finally concluded: ‘He was crying out for some sort ofrecognition: something he had wanted all his life.’A case that bears many resemblances to that of Robert Poulin – and whichoccurred two decades earlier – allows us a glimpse of what might have happenedto Poulin if he had actually carried out his intention of becoming a serialrapist. In the late 1940s, a young masochist named Harvey Murray Glatman wasreceiving psychiatric treatment in Sing Sing, where he was serving five yearsfor robbery and attempted rape – he had pointed a toy gun at a girl in Boulder,Colorado, and ordered her to undress. Released in 1951, he set up a TV repairshop in Los Angeles, and became an enthusiastic amateur photographer. For thenext six years he remained solitary, daydreaming of tying up girls and rapingthem. At the age of twelve he had discovered that looping a rope round his neckand half-throttling himself brought on an orgasm. His mother had been deeplyconcerned – Harvey was very much a mother’s boy – but was reassured when adoctor assured her that her son would outgrow it.On 30 July 1957 Glatman called at the apartment of a young model who hadrecently arrived from Florida and looked at her portfolio. His story was that hewas a magazine photographer named Johnny Glynn. He was fascinated by aphotograph he saw on the wall of a nineteen-year-old model named Judy Ann Dull.She was married, with a fourteen-month-old daughter, but separated from herjournalist husband. Glatman finally obtained her telephone number. The followingday, he contacted her and asked her to pose for photographs later thatafternoon. She was reluctant until he explained that they would have to use herapartment, since his own was being used. Her own home seemed safe enough; butwhen he arrived that afternoon, he told her that he had managed to borrow astudio from a friend. It was, in fact, his own apartment.Once there, he told her to take off her dress and put on a skirt and sweater.Then he explained that he had to tie her hands behind her – he was taking aphotograph for the cover of a true detective magazine. Dubious but compliant,she allowed him to tie her hands behind her, tie her knees together, and place agag in her mouth. He took several photographs, then unbuttoned her sweater,pulled down her bra, and removed her skirt. After that he took more photographs.Finally, when she was clad only in panties, he laid her on the floor and startedto fondle her. She struggled and protested through the gag. Glatman becameimpotent if a girl showed signs of having a mind of her own – total passivitywas required for his fantasy. He threatened her with a gun until she promisednot to resist, then raped her twice. After that, both sat naked on the setteeand watched television. Judy promised that if he would let her go she wouldnever tell anyone what had happened. Glatman pretended to agree – he wanted tomake her co-operate. He told her that he would drive her out to a lonely placeand release her, then he would leave town. Then he drove into the desert nearPhoenix, Colorado, and strangled her, after first taking more photographs. Heburied her in a shallow grave.Seven months later, Glatman met twenty-four-year old divorcee Shirley AnnBridgeford, a mother of two children, through a lonely-hearts club; he wasregistered as George Williams, a plumber by profession. When he made a date withher over the telephone on 8 March 1958 he told her they were goingsquare-dancing. But when he picked her up at her mother’s home in Sun Valley, hetold her he would rather take her for a drive in the moonlight. A hundred milessouth of Los Angeles he stopped the car and tried to fondle her; when sheprotested he produced a gun and ordered her into the back seat; there he rapedher. Then, in the Anza Borrego desert, he tied her up, took more photographs,and strangled her with a rope. He took her red panties as a keepsake.Shirley’s mother reported her disappearance, but ‘George Williams’ proved to beas untraceable as ‘Johnny Glynn’.Five months later, he dialled a nude modelling service, and spoke totwenty-four-year-old Ruth Rita Marcado, a strip-tease dancer who also modellednude. He gave his name as Frank Johnson. When he called on her on 22 July 1958,some instinct made her plead illness and send him away. The following evening hewent to her apartment with his automatic pistol, and took her up to her bedroom.There he tied her up and raped her. Then, telling her they were going for apicnic, he marched her down to his car. He drove her out to the desert, where hehad killed Shirley Bridgeford, and spent a day taking photographs of her – boundand gagged – and raping her. In between rapes he released her and allowed her toeat. Then he told her he would take her home. On the way, he stopped the car for‘one more shot’, tied her up once more, and strangled her with a rope.Three months later, in September, he tried to persuade another model back to hisstudio; she found him ‘creepy’ and declined. She finally contacted a friendnamed Lorraine Vigil, who was short of money. Glatman called at her house anddrove off with her. On a quiet road in a small town called Tustin, he stoppedand threatened her with the gun. When he told her he wanted to tie her up, shetried to jump out of the car. He threatened to kill her, but she felt she hadnothing to lose, and grabbed for the gun. It went off, frightening them both.She jumped from the car and struggled with him; she even managed to grab the gunand pull the trigger; but it had jammed. They were still struggling when apassing motor-cycle policeman pulled up, and produced his own revolver.When police searched his apartment, they found the ‘bondage’ photographs of histhree previous victims. Identified in a line-up by witnesses who had seen him,Glatman confessed in full to the three murders. At his trial he asked for thedeath penalty. The judge agreed, and on 18 August 1959 Glatman died in the SanQuentin gas chamber.There is a sense in which Glatman is the archetypal sex killer – and thereforethe archetypal serial killer. He was an ugly little man with a face like arabbit and ears like jug handles – the kind who never looks anyone straight inthe eyes – and from a fairly early age, he must have taken it for granted thatno woman would ever gaze at him with adoration. Before his attempt at rape inBoulder, Colorado, he had undoubtedly spent years daydreaming about sex, untilthe loss of contact with reality that springs from daydreams made it seem anunattainable ideal. Forcible rape seemed the only way of losing his virginity.In fact, the girl screamed, and he was arrested. He broke bail to flee to NewYork, where he had more success as a stick-up man – always preying on women –until he became known as the ‘Phantom Bandit’. Caught breaking and entering, hereceived five years in Sing Sing. On his release, his mother paid for him to setup a TV repair business. For six more years he indulged in autoerotic daydreams.Apart from his interest in bondage, his sexual desires were normal; he merelywanted to be allowed to explore the body of an attractive girl and then makelove to her. He took up photography because it gave him the opportunity tophotograph unclothed models in a public studio, but his glimpses of the nudefemale form only made his celibacy more agonising. At the age of thirty-one –and probably still a virgin – desperation finally overcame Glatman’s nervoustimidity, and he persuaded Judy Ann Dull back to his apartment. His intentionwas probably not rape – he realised that this would probably land him in SingSing again – but merely to reach a climax of autoeroticism looking at a boundand half-naked girl. But when it came to removing her skirt, nothing matteredbut to satisfy a craving that had been tormenting him for almost two decades;whatever it cost, he had to possess her. When he had raped her, and she satsubmissively beside him on the settee, watching television, he must haverealised that he had burnt his boats. For this delightful but in some waysperfectly ordinary experience he had bartered away the next ten years of hislife. Like Robert Poulin after the murder of Kim Rabat, he must have felt like aman who has awakened from a bad dream. If only he could trust her not to go tothe police he would undoubtedly have been glad to let her go, but commonsensetold him that was unlikely, and that his only chance of escaping theconsequences was to kill her. He later described how, when she lay dead, he wasconsumed by remorse, and begged forgiveness of her dead body. As he drove backto Los Angeles, he knew that what he had done might cost him his life. If thepolice found his fingerprints in the flat from which he had collected her, theywould quickly identify him as New York’s ‘Phantom Bandit’ and trace his presentwhereabouts – they might even be waiting for him when he got back home. At thatpoint, Harvey Glatman was ready to swear that if he escaped the consequences ofthis day of insanity, he would live a life that would do credit to a Trappistmonk.As the days and weeks passed, and the police made no headway with the case ofthe disappearing model, fear and remorse were replaced by memories of asubmissive girl who had allowed him to do whatever he liked. Eight months later,the craving to repeat the experience had become overwhelming.The murder of Shirley Bridgeford again filled him with remorse. This time itmight be easier for the police to trace him, since he had joined thelonely-hearts club that had supplied her name. Once more, weeks of anxietygradually gave way to confidence. Now there was a new fear: the realisationthat, sooner or later, he would have to do it again. The desire to rapesubmissive girls had become a compulsion.He later confessed that the murder of Ruth Rita Marcado was his most traumaticexperience so far. In the hours he spent with her – raping her ‘four or fivetimes’ – he found her so likeable that he was strongly tempted to let her go,but that would have been too dangerous. After her death, he felt far worse thanafter killing the other two girls.Only three months later, he was again in the grip of the old compulsion. Herealised that the times between rapes was becoming shorter: eight months afterJudy Ann Dull, four months after Shirley Bridgeford, now only three months afterRuth Marcado. He was like a man who has fallen into the clutches of ablackmailer, and realises that he will never escape. When the final rape wentdisastrously wrong, and the door of the police cell clanged behind him, theremust have been a certain feeling of relief. Now at least he could no longer giveway to the compulsion to which he had become a slave. When the case finally cameto trial all desire to escape the consequences of his acts had vanished. LikeCarl Panzram, he only wanted to die. This is why he begged his defence lawyer tomake sure that he received the death penalty.To understand Glatman is to understand the basic psychology of the serialkiller. The first crime produces fear, revulsion, remorse. But it is also like adose of an addictive drug. Again and again, serial killers have confessed thatthey were unable to stop: again and again – from America’s first serial murdererH.H.Holmes to the Yorkshire Ripper and Henry Lee Lucas – they have used the sameimage: that it was if they had fallen into the power of the devil.In the case of Robert Poulin and Harvey Glatman, the sex was uncomplicated bysadism. In an earlier case, that of Donald Fearn, the power fantasy alsoinvolved torture. Fearn, a twenty-three-year-old railway mechanic of Pueblo,Colorado, was fascinated by the practices of a sect of Indians called thePenitentes, whose religious ceremonies involved torture and crucifixion. InAugust 1941 Fearn’s wife became pregnant, and by the following April, when shewas in hospital giving birth, he decided to carry out his plan of kidnapping andtorturing a girl. On the evening of 22 April 1942, as a prettyseventeen-year-old named Alice Porter walked home from a nursing class, hepulled up alongside her with a gun, and bundled her into his car. A neighbourheard the girl scream, and looked out in time to see a light-coloured Ford sedandisappearing down the street. Fearn drove the girl out to an old one-room ranchbuilding twenty-five miles away, and there raped and tortured her for six hours,binding her with red-hot wires and stabbing her with an awl. Finally he struckher with a hammer, shot her twice through the head, and threw her body down acistern. Three days later, police located a garage owner, who had been arousedat 4 a.m. on the day after Alice Porter’s disappearance, to tow a light-colouredFord sedan out of the mud. Police went to the spot, and found the abandonedranch at the top of the nearby hill. A table inside was covered withbloodstains, and on the floor there were scissors, pliers, baling wire and ashoemaker’s awl – Fearn’s torture kit. In the cistern outside, police found thebody of Alice Porter. From the handle of an awl they were able to lift distinctfingerprints, but these failed to match those of any known sexual offender. Thepolice visited every garage in Pueblo, asking if the proprietor had seen alight-coloured, mud-stained sedan. One of them had – it was in the garage atthat moment, waiting to be washed. When Donald Fearn walked in to collect it,the police asked him to come to the station for questioning, and took hisfingerprints; these matched those found on the awl. When the two sets of printswere placed in front of him, Fearn confessed. ‘I always wanted to torture agirl.’ He went on to describe how he had waited outside a nursing class everynight for weeks and followed the student nurses home; Alice Porter was the onehe finally chose as his victim.On 23 October 1942 Fearn was executed in the gas chamber in Canon City jail.The Fearn case exhibits an important aspect of the psychology of the sex killer:that the victim is not, in fact, chosen totally ‘at random’. Fearn had selectedAlice Porter, and followed her around for a week before he killed her –establishing her routine – partly because she lived on a lonely block, but alsobecause she conformed to his fantasy image of the girl he wanted to violate. Thefantasy has already determined the type of person to be selected as the victim.In most cases she is selected because she strikes the fantasist as thevictim-type; there may be some look of vulnerability about her that excites him.This can again be seen in the case of Cameron Hooker. He apparently murdered thefirst girl he picked up – Marliz Spannhake – because she screamed and struggled.She was not the ‘victim’ type. Colleen Stan was. Janice Hooker commented afterthe case that her husband had picked a victim who was submissive, compliant, andwho tended towards destructive relationships. She went on to make the perceptivecomment: ‘I chose not to be a victim. I hope Colleen makes that choice. Not justto walk out, but to make a total change, to become an unvictim, to take charge’.If Colleen Stan had been that kind of person – an unvictim, the dominant typewho ‘takes charge’ – it is almost certain that Cameron Hooker would not havekidnapped her; he would have recognised her as unsuitable for his purposes, andlet her go.In order to understand a psychopath like Cameron Hooker, it is also necessary torecognise the importance of Reinhardt’s observation that sadism and masochismare simply a development of tendencies that are already present in thereasonably ‘well socialised’ male. It is not unnatural for a young and healthymale to want to ‘fuck some girl’, as Robert Poulin put it: any girl. The act ofpenetration brings a sense of triumph, a sudden expansion of self-esteem. Theself-esteem of the Casanova-type of male – and most young men would like toemulate Casanova – depends upon ‘conquest’, as the self-esteem of the hunterdepends on the amount of game he can ‘bag’. In 1980 in Hanover, West Germany, aplumber named Robert Bilden – who had acquired himself a reputation of beingirresistible to women – was tried for a particularly brutal rape. In the springof that year, he met a pretty nineteen-year-old girl named Tina Schuster, whowas shy and intensely prudish. Bilden began assiduously courting her, assuringher that his bad reputation was entirely unmerited. When he had established hisgood behaviour over a period of many months, she finally consented to go todinner in his apartment when he told her that his schoolmistress from fifthgrade would also be present. The ‘schoolmistress’ was, in fact, a prostitutenamed Helga Tallman. After the meal, the prostitute threw herself on the girland held her down while Bilden removed her clothes; then Helga Tallman subjectedher to oral sex, which was intended to excite Tina but in fact made her feelsick. After this Bilden raped her violently – her inner thighs were bruised asshe struggled to prevent penetration – and continued to do so for the rest ofthe night. Bilden and the prostitute also engaged in sex, urging the girl towatch them in the mirror over the bed. As soon as she managed to escape, earlythe following morning, she rushed to a doctor, who called the police. Bilden wassentenced to five years’ imprisonment, Helga Tallman to sixteen months. But thecase raises the question: why had Bilden risked jail when he could have spentthe night with any number of willing girls? Because, with her innocene andprudishness, Tina Schuster struck him as ‘the perfect victim’. The ultimatepleasure was to rape a shy virgin. It produced a far more powerful sense ofconquest, of self-esteem, than the seduction of a ‘willing’ victim.It must be recognised that this element of ‘conquest’ is present in all malesexuality. If it were absent, the male would find the female totallyundesirable. In ‘normal’ relationships, protectiveness and affection outweighthe desire for ‘conquest’, but do not replace it; without it, the relationshipwould be non-sexual. The novelist Thomas Mann remarked that the words of themarriage ceremony ‘These twain shall be one flesh’ are misleading, for if theywere really ‘one flesh’ they would have no attraction for one another;attraction is based upon ‘strangeness’, which in turn implies ‘forbiddenness’.In a fantasist like Cameron Hooker – and Hooker, like most fantasists, had beena shy and introverted child – the normal male desire for ‘conquest’ is raised toa pathological level by fantasy. Reinhardt’s chapter on sadism is entitled‘Fantasy Finds a Victim’, and includes a typical case in which sadistic fantasywas translated into actuality. In the autumn of 1953, Raymond and Betty Allenset out to drive from Pennsylvania to their new home in San Jose, California,towing an aluminium trailer behind their car. On the morning of 1 December abig, white-haired man struck up a conversation at a gas station; the Aliens sawhim several times later that day, driving in the same direction. That night,when they were parked at a caravan site in Arizona, Raymond Allen woke up tofind a flashlight on his face, and was knocked unconscious by a blow on thechin. When he woke up, he and his wife were tied hand and foot. The white-hairedman – Carl J.Folk – demanded money, then drove the car – still towing thetrailer – for several miles before he went too close to a ditch andhalf-overturned it. For the next hour or so, he raped and tortured Betty Allen,burning her with matches and cigarettes, and biting her all over. Allen had tolie there in the next room, listening to her screams. These eventually ceased.Finally Folk went to sleep, and Allen managed to untie his legs. He escaped fromthe caravan and ran down the road; a car stopped, and the driver untied hishands. Allen went back to his car and took a revolver from under the front seat.In the trailer, Folk was pouring petrol over Betty Allen and her baby. When hewent into the next room, he discovered that Raymond Allen was missing. He lookedoutside, saw Allen, and asked with mild surprise: ‘What are you doing there?’Allen then shot him in the stomach. (Five other shots missed.) Betty Allen wasdead, strangled with a sheet round her neck.Folk recovered from his wound, and was found guilty of murder and executed inMarch 1955. An earlier victim – a seventeen-year-old girl – had been luckierthan Betty Allen. In 1949, she had answered an advertisement for a domestic inan Albuquerque newspaper; the big white-haired man who met her seemed harmless,so she climbed into his car. He drove her to a lonely stretch of road, thenordered her out and tore off her clothes. Then he tied her to a tree, and beatand raped her repeatedly. She noted the number of his car as he drove off, andFolk – the proprietor of a travelling carnival – was arrested. By the time thecase was due for trial, the girl had had a mental breakdown and was in hospital.Folk was confined to the same hospital for three years, and was then released toact out his sadistic fantasies with Betty Allen.If the case of Carl Folk demonstrates the incubation of the sadistic ‘powersyndrome’ in a mentally unbalanced individual, the case of Robert Hansen is anexample of how it can develop in an apparently stable one.In the early 1980s, police in Anchorage, Alaska, took note of the disappearanceof a number of ‘exotic dancers’. In Anchorage, the temperature is so low that itis impractical for prostitutes to walk the streets. The majority of them solvethe problem by working in topless bars, and making appointments with clients forafter hours. Few people notice when such a girl vanishes, although bar ownerswere often puzzled when their dancers failed to show up to collect their pay.And when, in 1980, building workers on Eklutna Road discovered a shallow gravewhich had been partly excavated by bears, and containing the half-eaten body ofa woman, it seemed likely that she might be one of the missing women. Since thestate of the body made it impossible to identify, she became known in therecords as ‘Eklutna Annie’.Two years later, on 12 September 1982, hunters found another shallow grave onthe bank of the Knik River, not far from Anchorage; this time it was possible toidentify the body in it as twenty-three-year-old Sherry Morrow, a dancer who haddisappeared in the previous November. She had been shot three times, and shellcasings near the grave indicated that the weapon had been a high-velocityhunting rifle which fires slugs – a .223 Ruger Mini-14. Here, once again, theinvestigation reached a dead end since it was impossible to interview everyowner of such a rifle. An odd feature of the case was that the clothes found inthe grave had no bullet holes, indicating the that the girl had been naked whenshe was killed.A year later, on 2 September 1983, another grave was found on the bank of theKnik River; the girl in it had also been shot with a Ruger Mini-14. The victimwas identified as Paula Golding, an out-of-work secretary who had found herselfa job as an exotic dancer in a topless bar. She had started work on 17 April1983 and had failed to return eight days later, leaving her pay chequeuncollected. The bar owner commented that he had been reluctant to hire herbecause she had obviously been a ‘nice girl’, who was only doing this becauseshe was desperate for money. Again, there were no clues to who might have killedher.Investigators checking the police files made a discovery that looked like apossible lead. On the previous 13 June a policeman had seen a girl runningfrantically towards him with a handcuff dangling from one of her wrists. She wasa seventeen-year-old prostitute, and a medical examination at policeheadquarters revealed that she had been tortured. She told of being picked up bya red-haired, pockmarked little man with a bad stutter, who had offered her $200for oral sex. She had accompanied him back to his home in the well-to-do Muldoonarea, and down to the basement. There he had told her to take off her clothes,then snapped a handcuff on her, and shackled her to a support pillar. Thetortures that followed during the next hour or so included biting her nipplesand thrusting the handle of a hammer into her vagina. Finally, he allowed her todress. Then he told her that he owned a private plane, and was going to take herto a cabin in the wilderness. The girl knew that he intended to kill her – sheknew what he looked like and where he lived. So as they crossed the airfield,she broke away and ran; the man gave up the chase when she reached the streetlights.Her description of the ‘John’ convinced the police that it was a respectablecitizen called Robert Hansen, a married man and the owner of a flourishingbakery business, who had been in Anchorage for seventeen years. Driven out tothe Muldoon district, the girl identified the house where she had been tortured;it was Hansen’s. She also identified the Piper Super Cub aeroplane that belongedto Hansen. The police learned that Hansen was at present alone in the house –his family were on a trip to Europe.When Hansen was told about the charge, he exploded indignantly. He had spent thewhole evening dining with two business acquaintances, and they would verify hisalibi. In fact, the two men did this. The girl, Hansen said, was simply tryingto ‘shake him down’. Since it was her word against that of three of Anchorage’smost respectable businessmen, it looked as if the case would have to be dropped.However, after the discovery of Paula Golding’s body three months later, theinvestigating team decided that the case was worth pursuing. If Hansen hadtortured a prostitute, then decided to take her out to the wilderness, he couldwell be the killer they were seeking.The investigators decided to contact the NCAVC team in Quantico, Virginia. Whatthey wanted was not a ‘profile’ of the killer – they already had their suspect –but to know whether Robert Hansen was a viable suspect. What the Alaskaauthorities were able to tell the Quantico team was that Hansen was a well-knownbig-game hunter, who had achieved celebrity by bagging a Dall sheep with acrossbow in the Kuskokwim Mountains. The answer was that Hansen was indeed aviable suspect. A big-game hunter might well decide to hunt girls. Since hecollected trophies, then it would be likely that he had kept items belonging tohis victims. If the police could obtain a search warrant, they might well findtheir evidence.What was also clear was that if Hansen knew he was a suspect, he would destroythe evidence; it was therefore necessary to work quickly and secretly. The firststep was to try to break his alibi. No doubt his friends had been willing toprovide a false alibi because it would cost them nothing. If they could beconvinced that it might cost them two years in prison for perjury, they mightfeel differently. The police approached the public prosecutor and asked him toauthorise a grand jury to investigate the charges of torture against theprostitute. Then the businessmen were approached, and told that they would becalled to repeat their alibi on oath. It worked; both admitted that they hadprovided Hansen with an alibi merely to help him out of a difficult situation.They agreed to testify to that effect.Now Hansen was arrested on a charge of rape and kidnapping. A search warrantenabled the police to enter his home. There they found the Ruger Mini-14 rifle,which a ballistics expert identified as the one that had fired the shells foundnear the graves. Under the floor in the attic the searchers found more rifles,and items of cheap jewellery and adornment, including a Timex watch. Mostimportant of all, they found an aviation map with twenty asterisks markingvarious spots. Two of these marked the places where the two bodies had so farbeen found. Another indicated the place where the unidentified corpse of a womanhad been found on the south side of the Kenai Peninsula in August 1980, a crimethat had not been linked with the Anchorage killings. The investigatorsdiscovered that her name was Joanna Messina, and that she had last been seenalive with a red-headed, pockmarked man who stuttered.At first Hansen denied all knowledge of the killings, but faced with theevidence against him, he finally decided to confess. The twenty asterisks, headmitted, marked graves of prostitutes. But he had not killed all the women hehad taken out to the wilderness. What he wanted was oral sex. If the womansatisfied him, he took her back home. If not, he pointed a gun at her, orderedher to strip naked, and then run. He gave the girl a start, then would stalk heras if hunting a game animal. Sometimes the girl would think she had escaped, andHansen would allow her to think so – until he once again flushed her out andmade her run. Finally, when she was too exhausted to run further, he killed herand buried the body. Killing, he said, was an anticlimax; ‘the excitement was inthe stalking’.In court on 28 February 1984 the prosecutor told the judge (a jury wasunnecessary since Hansen had pleaded guilty): ‘Before you sits a monster, anextreme aberration of a human being. A man who has walked among us for seventeenyears, selling us doughbuts [sic], Danish buns, coffee, all with a pleasantsmile on his face. That smile concealed crimes that would numb the mind.’ JudgeRalph Moody then imposed sentences totalling 461 years.For the investigating detectives, the most interesting part of Hansen’sconfession was the explanation of why and how he had become a serial killer.Born in a small rural community – Pocahontas, Iowa – he had been an ugly andunpopular child. His schoolfellows found his combination of a stutter andrunning acne sores repellent. ‘Because I looked and talked like a freak, everytime I looked at a girl she would turn away.’ He had married, but his wife hadleft him – he felt that it was because he was ugly. He married again, came toAlaska, and started a successful bakery business – his own father’s trade. Butmarriage could not satisfy his raging sexual obsession, his desire to have adocile girl performing oral sex. Since Anchorage had so many topless bars andstrip joints, it was a temptation to satisfy his voyeurism in them; then,sexually excited, he needed to pick up a prostitute. What he craved was oralsex, and many of them were unwilling. Hansen would drive out into the woods,then announce what he wanted; if they refused, he produced a gun.Since he was by nature frugal, he preferred not to pay them. In fact, it emergedin his confession that he was a lifelong thief, and that this was a result ofhis meanness. ‘I hate to spend money . . .1 damn near ejaculate in my pants if Icould walk into a store and take something . . .1 stole more stuff in this damntown than Carter got little green pills.’ Yet his next sentence reveals that itwas more than simply meanness that made him steal. ‘Giving stuff away, you know,walk out in the parking lot and walk to somebody’s car, and throw it in the damncar. But I was taking it . . .1 was smarter than people in the damn store. Itwould give me – uh – the same satisfaction – I don’t know if you want to call itthat – but I got a lot the same feeling as I did with a prostitute.’ The linkbetween stealing and oral sex was ‘the forbidden’. This seems to explain whymany serial killers – Ted Bundy is another example – begin as habitual thieves.The murders had started, he said, with Joanna Messina, the woman he had met in atown called Seward. She was living in a tent in the woods with her dog, waitingfor a job in a cannery. Hansen had got into conversation with her and taken herout to dinner. Afterwards, they went back to her tent, near a gravel pit, whereHansen hoped she would be prepared to let him stay the night. When they were inbed, she told him she needed money. His natural meanness affronted, he calledher a whore and shot her with a .22 pistol; then shot her dog, destroyed thecamp, and dumped her body into the gravel pit.According to Hansen, he was violently sick after the murder. Not longafterwards, he picked up a prostitute and asked her if she would fellate him.She agreed, and they drove out along the Eklutna Road. Then, according toHansen, she became nervous and ran away; when he gave chase, she drew a knife.He took it from her and stabbed her to death. That was how the unidentifiedcorpse known as ‘Eklutna Annie’ came to lie in a shallow grave, to be dug up bya hungry bear.This time, Hansen did not feel nauseated. In fact, he said, when he looked backon the murder, he experienced an odd pleasure. Then he began to fantasise abouthow enjoyable it would be to hunt down a woman like an animal . . . Like so manyother serial killers, Hansen had discovered that murder is addictive.Over the next three years he drove about sixty prostitutes out into thewilderness and demanded oral sex. If they complied satisfactorily, he drove themback to Anchorage. If not, he forced them to strip at gunpoint, then to fleeinto the woods. When the hunt was over and the girl lay dead, he buried thebody, and made a mark on a map – he even tried to guide officers back to some ofthe murder sites, but had usually forgotten exactly where they were. Once, whenthey were hovering over Grouse Lake in a helicopter, he pointed down. ‘There’s ablonde down there. And over there there’s a redhead with the biggest tits youever saw.’When Robert Hansen was tried in Anchorage, the death sentence had been abolishedin Alaska, but it had still been in existence thirty-four years earlier, whenanother sadistic killer had been tried there for murder. The case of HarveyCarignan provides some interesting parallels with that of Robert Hansen. OnSunday 31 July 1949, stationed in Anchorage, he went on a drinking spree, andpicked up a fifty-seven-year-old woman named Laura Showalter. They walked to anearby park, but when the soldier tried to remove her underwear in broaddaylight, she fought him off. The soldier went into a frenzy, and beat herviolently with his fists – so violently that her face was virtually obliterated.Then he tried to rape her. At that moment, a man walked towards them. Thesoldier looked up and snarled: ‘Move on.’ The man, assuming that they wereengaged in lovemaking, hurried away. The next morning he went past the samespot, and found the woman still lying there. The rape had not been completed.Six weeks later, on 16 September a soldier tried to rape a girl on a desertedAnchorage street at eleven o’clock in the morning; she succeeded in fighting himoff. She described him as tall, and as strong as an ape. Later, the policepicked up a man answering to her description – a soldier named Harvey LouisCarignan, born in 1927. Carignan eventually confessed to the murder of LauraShowalter, and was sentenced to death. However, the police had omitted a vitalstep in the legal proceedings – to charge him with the murder before taking himbefore a marshal for interrogation – and on appeal, the sentence was overturned.Harvey Carignan might have gone free but for the second rape attempt; for thishe was sentenced to fifteen years.He was paroled in 1960, but his freedom did not last long. Four months later hewas arrested for burglary and attempted rape; for this he received five and ahalf years. Paroled in 1964, he was soon sentenced to another fifteen years forburglary. Good conduct earned him so much remission that he was back on thestreets by 1969. This time he made a determined attempt to adjust to ‘life onthe outside’, and found himself a wife in Seattle. The marriage soon failed, andCarignan narrowly avoided another life sentence – he was waiting for his wifewith a hammer, but it was his stepdaughter who came down to the basement. Hepacked up and left. A second marriage in 1972 was slightly more successful; heleased a gas station in Seattle and settled into his wife’s home. But afteralmost twenty years in jail, his sexual daydreams were all of teenage girls. On1 May 1972 he placed an advertisement in the want-ads column of the SeattleTimes, offering a job at the Sav Mor Garage. It was answered by afifteen-year-old girl named Kathy Sue Miller, who wanted a job for the summervacation. The next day, she went off to meet the owner of the station. It wasthe last time she was seen alive by her family. Her schoolbooks were found inEverett, twenty-six miles from her home. Harvey Carignan was questioned bypolice – he had been away for several hours on that day – but he continued todeny meeting Kathy. Her violated body was found on 3 June 1972 among denseundergrowth north of Everett. She had been killed by a tremendous blow from someblunt instrument. There was still no proof that Harvey Carignan had ever metKathy Miller.When he became tired of being questioned by the police, Carignan decided toleave town. He drove south to California. Between February 1972 and December1973, eleven girls were murdered in the Sonoma County area, near San Francisco.Most had been battered to death, one with a crushing blow to the back of theskull, and seven had been raped. Carignan has never been accused of any of thesecrimes, but they are consistent with his method. Early in 1974 he moved back tohis former home, Minneapolis. On 28 June a woman waiting at a bus stop wasknocked unconscious by a blow to the back of the head. When she woke up, she wasin a pick-up truck with a scowling, bald-headed man. When he tried to place herhand on his flies, she made a grab for the door handle. He seized her by thehair, but it proved to be a wig; the woman fled, leaving it in his hand.On 9 September 1973 a thirteen-year-old runaway named Jerri Billings washitchhiking in north-eastern Minneapolis. The pick-up truck that stopped for herwas driven by a huge man with a bald head and a receding, ape-like chin. Whenthey had driven a short distance, he unzipped his fly, then grabbed her by theback of the neck and forced her head down to his penis; she was made to performfellatio on him. Then, still driving fast, he order her to remove her jeans andpanties. She thought it was a preliminary to rape, but was mistaken. What he didwas to force a hammer handle into her vagina, and move it up and down as thoughit were a penis. After that he made her fellate him again. When she tried toraise her head, he hit her a blow with the hammer. Soon after this he stopped ina cornfield, and made an attempt to sodomise her. Unable to penetrate, he madeher fellate him again, then – amazingly – allowed her to dress and drove her tothe nearest town. He ordered her to tell no-one what had happened. She kept hersecret for nearly two months, then went to the police. They had no leads on therapist, and the investigation lost momentum.In January 1974 Carignan offered help to three Jehovah’s Witnesses whose car hadbroken down. One of them was an attractive twenty-eight-year-old named EileenHunley. In May of that year, they began to see a great deal of one another, butby July, she was disillusioned; he drank too much and had a hair-trigger temper.She told him she did not want to see him any more. On 10 August 1974 EileenHunley vanished.A month later, on 8 September two teenage girls, June Lynch and Lisa King, werehitchhiking in Minneapolis when a big middle-aged man stopped to offer them alift, and offered them money if they would help him bring down a truck fromMora. He turned off into some woods and asked June Lynch to go with him. LisaKing heard her friend scream and ran to see what was the matter. June was lyingon the ground, bleeding from the head, and the man had gone. In hospital, it wasestablished that June had been hit on the head with a hammer seven times and wassuffering severe concussion.On 14 September the big man driving a green Chevrolet picked up anineteen-year-old girl named Gwen Burton, whose car had broken down, and offeredto drive home to get tools. When they were outside town, he grabbed her by theneck and forced her to fellate him. After this he ripped off her jeans andunderwear, then throttled her. She recovered consciousness to find herself lyingon a blanket in a field. The man forced her to commit oral sodomy, then inserteda hammer handle into her vagina, tearing the hymen. After that he punched her inthe stomach, knocking the wind out of her, and battered her with the hammer.When Gwen Burton woke up again, she succeeded in crawling to a road, where atractor stopped for her. In hospital, her life was saved by immediate surgery –there were fragments of bone in the brain tissue. She recovered eventually, buther health was permanently impaired.On 18 September 1974 the body of a woman was found in Sherburne County, north ofMinneapolis; she had been killed with hammer blows, and her vagina had beenlacerated by some hard object, probably a hammer handle. She was eventuallyidentified as Eileen Hunley, missing since August.A few days later, the man in the green Chevrolet picked up two girls, andoffered them twenty-five dollars to help him recover a car. On a lonely road hebegan to talk about rape, and when one of the girls asked how far they still hadto go, he hit her in the mouth. Their abductor had to stop for gas, and thegirls managed to escape.On 20 September an eighteen-year-old girl named Kathy Schultz disappeared fromMinneapolis; the following day, her violated body was found by two hunters fortymiles north of Minneapolis; she had been killed with hammer blows.Now, at least, the police had several good descriptions of the man they sought:middle-aged, balding and very big, and driving a green Chevrolet. On 24September 1974 two policeman on patrol saw a man who answered that description,and watched as he approached a green Chevrolet. When they pulled up behind thecar, it drove off at speed; they eventually forced it to move over. The driveridentified himself as Harvey Carignan. When four of the attacker’s victimsunhesitatingly picked him out in a line-up, Harvey Carignan’s career of rape andmurder was at an end.On 14 February 1975 Harvey Carignan was tried on charges relating to GwenBurton, the girl who had been sodomised and left for dead.The line taken by Carignan’s defence was that he was guilty but insane. Carignanhimself told the jury that he had picked up Gwen Burton because God had told himto. In fact, he insisted that he frequently held conversations with God, andthat it was God who told him to kill. The jurors chose to disbelieve that he wasinsane, and found him guilty on all counts. Before sentencing, he was tried forthe attack on the thirteen-year-old schoolgirl, Jerri Billings. This time,Carignan simply denied that he had ever seen her. Again the jury disbelievedhim, and found him guilty. Harvey Carignan was sentenced to sixty years inprison. Even with one third remission for good conduct, this meant that he wouldserve forty years.In the following year, Carignan saved the taxpayers the expense of a trial whenhe pleaded guilty to murdering Kathy Schultz. He unexpectedly pleaded not guiltyto murdering Eileen Hunley. Again, the evidence was against him, and he wassentenced to life imprisonment.After the Gwen Burton trial, Harvey Carignan was sent to St Peter State Hospitalfor a psychiatric examination. The story he told made it clear that here was yetanother classic case of the serial killer syndrome. He had been an illegitimatechild and the father – a young doctor – declined to stand by the girl he hadmade pregnant. Harvey was an undersized, lonely child who wet the bed far beyondthe usual age. His mother had been only seventeen at the time of his birth, andshe showed little affection for the child who had disrupted her life. ‘She waspretty mean,’ Carignan told psychiatrists. His mother married when he was four,and bore a second son. Harvey’s life became even more lonely and loveless. Asthe bedwetting became worse, he was sent to live with an aunt and uncle. Theysoon tired of him and sent him back. When he also began to steal, he was sent toa reform school in Mandan, North Dakota. He was only just twelve years old, andhe stayed there until he was eighteen, old enough to join the army.In order to escape from a life that he found intolerable, Harvey Carignan becamean obsessive reader and daydreamer. He was, in fact, highly intelligent, and indifferent circumstances, would probably have done well. In spite of his almostpermanent scowl, he possessed a great deal of charm; in jail he was a modelprisoner, and one of his warders described him as ‘a perfect gentleman’.Perhaps the strangest part of Carignan’s account of his childhood is hisinsistence that he was sexually assaulted by several older women; this, heinsisted, was what made him feel defensive and hostile towards women, so thatany sign of rejection turned to uncontrollable rage. The psychiatrists wereinclined to doubt the truth of the story; but there can be little doubt thatCarignan believed it happened. It was his rage at being rejected by an olderwoman in Anchorage, Alaska, that led to his first murder, and to the deathsentence that almost ended his career of murder three decades earlier.In her book on the case, The Want-Ad Killer, Ann Rule comments: ‘There is,today, no known treatment that is effective in changing the structure of theantisocial personality. The defect is believed to originate in early childhood,usually before the age of five, and once the child is so damaged, his completelack of compassion for others only becomes more solidly entrenched as he growsto manhood.’In Carignan’s case, as in that of Cameron Hooker, Robert Poulin, Harvey Glatman,and other killers discussed in this chapter, the frustrated craving foraffection turned into a craving for power over the women who denied it. Thisseems to explain why, although normally sexually potent, Carignan preferred toviolate his victims with a hammer handle. Rape with a penis would have seemedclose to an act of love-making, and Carignan had no intention of expressinglove: only rage, and the desire to obliterate.While a psychologist would undoubtedly classify Folk, Hansen and Carignan as‘degenerates’, none could be described as a psychotic: that is, as clinicallyinsane.Reinhardt comments: ‘While I do not attempt here to draw fine distinctionsbetween “degeneracy” and various forms of psychoses, there is no question in mymind that many sadists, as well as other sexually perverted types, suffer markedpsychoses’ – in other words, are technically insane. Reinhardt is discussing asadistic pervert named Albert Fish, who was executed in Sing Sing in January1936. Fish remains the classic example of the psychotic serial killer.On 28 May 1928 a mild-looking old man called on the family of a doorman namedAlbert Budd in a basement in Manhattan. He explained he had come in answer to ajob advertisement placed in a New York newspaper by Budd’s eighteen-year-old sonEdward. His name, he said, was Frank Howard, and he owned a farm on Long Island.The old man so charmed the Budds that the following day they allowed him to taketheir ten-year-old daughter Grace to a party; she left in a white confirmationdress, holding Howard’s hand. The Budds never saw Grace again; the address atwhich the party was supposed to be held proved fictitious, and no farmer by thename of Frank Howard could be traced on Long Island. The kidnap received widepublicity, and the police investigated hundreds of tips. Detective Will King ofthe Missing Persons Bureau became particularly obsessed with the crime andtravelled thousands of miles in search of ‘Frank Howard’.Six years later, the Budds received an unsigned letter that was clearly from thekidnapper. He stated that he had taken Grace Budd to an empty house inWestchester, then left her picking flowers while he went inside and stripped offhis clothes; then he leaned out of the upstairs window and called her in.Confronted by this skinny naked man, Grace began to cry and tried to run away;he seized her and strangled her. Then he cut her in half, and took the body backhome, where he ate parts of it. ‘How sweet her little ass was, roasted in theoven. It took me nine days to eat her entire body. I did not fuck her tho Icould of had I wished.’ (In fact, Fish was to admit to his attorney that thiswas untrue.) Finally, he took the bones back to the cottage and buried them inthe garden.With a brilliant piece of detective work, Will King traced the writer – theletter had arrived in an envelope with the inked-out logo of a chauffeurs’benevolent association on the flap. One of the chauffeurs finally admitted thathe had taken some of the association’s stationery and left it in a room he usedto rent on East 52nd Street. This now proved to be rented by a tenant who calledhimself A.H.Fish, and his handwriting in the boarding house register wasidentical with that of the letter writer. King kept watch on the room for threeweeks before Albert Fish – the mild little old man – returned. He agreedunhesitatingly to go to headquarters for questioning, but at the street door,suddenly lunged at King with a razor in each hand. King disarmed and handcuffedhim. Back at police headquarters, Fish made no attempt to deny the murder ofGrace Budd. He had gone to her home, he explained, with the intention of killingher brother Edward, but when Grace had sat on his knee during dinner, haddecided that he wanted to eat her.He took the police to the cottage in Westchester, where they unearthed the bonesof Grace Budd. Later, under intensive questioning, he admitted to killing aboutfour hundred children since 1910. (The figure has never been confirmed, and ajudge involved in the case placed the true figure at sixteen.)Soon after his arrest, Fish was visited by a psychiatrist named FredrickWertham, who would appear for the defence. ‘He looked’, wrote Wertham, ‘like ameek and innocuous little old man, gentle and benevolent, friendly and polite.If you wanted someone to entrust your children to, he would be the one you wouldchoose.’ When Fish realised that Wertham really wanted to understand him, hebecame completely open and forthcoming.Fish was a strange paradox of a man. His face lit up when he talked of histwelve-year-old grandchild, and he was obviously sincere when he said: ‘I lovechildren and was always soft-hearted.’ He was also deeply religious, and readhis Bible continuously. The answer to the paradox, Wertham soon concluded, wasthat Fish was insane. He genuinely believed that God told him to murderchildren.Albert Hamilton Fish had been born in Washington, DC, in 1870; his father, ariverboat captain, was seventy-five at the time. Various members of the familyhad mental problems and one suffered from religious mania. One brother wasfeeble-minded and another an alcoholic. The father had died when Fish was fiveyears old, and he was placed in an orphanage, from which he regularly ran away.On leaving school he was apprenticed to a house painter, and this remained hisprofession for the rest of his life. Access to other people’s homes also gavehim access to children. He was twenty-eight when he first married, but his wifeeloped with the lodger. Later, there were three more marriages, all bigamous.Fish talked with complete frankness about his sex life – he had always enjoyedwriting obscene letters, and no doubt confessing to Wertham gave him the samekind of pleasure. Wertham wrote:‘Fish’s sexual life was of unparalleled perversity . . .1 found no publishedcase that would even nearly compare with his . . . There was no known perversionthat he did not practise and practise frequently.‘Sado-masochism directed against children, particularly boys, took the lead inhis sexual regressive development. “I have always had a desire to inflict painon others and to have others inflict pain on me. I always seemed to enjoyanything that hurt. The desire to inflict pain, that is all that is uppermost.”Experiences with excreta of every imaginable kind were practised by him,actively and passively. He took bits of cotton wool, saturated them withalcohol, inserted them in his rectum and set fire to them. He also did this tohis child victims. Finally, and clearly also on a sexual basis, he developed acraving going back to one of the arch-crimes of humanity – cannibalism.‘I elicited from him a long history of how he preyed on children. In manyinstances – I stated under oath later “at least a hundred” – he seduced them orbribed them with small sums of money or forced them and attacked them. He oftenworked in public buildings and had an excuse for spending times in cellars andbasements and even garrets. He would put on his painters’ overalls over his nudebody, and that permitted him to undress in a moment . . .‘Most, if not all, of his victims came from the poorer classes. He told me thathe selected coloured children especially, because the authorities didn’t paymuch attention when they were hurt or missing. For example, he once paid a smallcoloured girl five dollars regularly to bring him little colouredboys . . .Frequently after a particularly brutal episode he would change hisaddress completely . . . Altogether he roamed over twenty-three states, from NewYork to Montana. “And I have had children in every state.” He also made a habitof writing letters to women, trying to persude them to join him in whippingboys.‘Fish told me that for years he had been sticking needles into his body in theregion near his genitals, in the area between the rectum and the scrotum. Hetold me of doing it to other people too, especially to children. At first, hesaid, he had only stuck these needles in and pulled them out again. They wereneedles of assorted sizes, some of them big sail needles. Then he had stuckothers in so far that he was unable to get them out, and they stayed there.“They’re in there now,” he said. “I put them up under the spine . . .I did putone in the scrotum too; but I couldn’t stand the pain.”‘I checked this strange story on a series of X-rays of his pelvic and abdominalregion. They showed plainly twenty-nine needles inside his body. One X-ray ofthe pelvic region showed twenty-seven. They were easily recognisable asneedles . . . Some of them must have been years in his body, for they wereeroded to an extent that would have taken at least seven years. Some of theneedles were fragmented by this erosion so that only bits of steel remained inthe tissue.’Ih his middle fifties, says Wertham, Fish began to develop psychosis withdelusions and hallucinations. (He was fifty-eight when he murdered Grace Budd.)‘At times he identified himself with God and felt that he should sacrifice hisown son. He tried to stick needles under his fingernails but could not stand thepain. He made the poignant remark: “If only pain were not so painful!”‘He had visions of Christ and his angels . . .He heard them saying words like“stripes”, “rewardeth” and “delighteth”. And he connected these words withverses from the Bible and elaborated them delusionally with his sadistic wishes.“Stripes means to lash them, you know.”‘He felt driven to torment and kill children. Sometimes he would gag them, tiethem up and beat them, although he preferred not to gag them, circumstancespermitting, for he liked to hear their cries. He felt that he was ordered by Godto castrate little boys . . . “I am not insane. I am just queer.” Aftermurdering Grace Budd he had cooked parts of the body with carrots and onions andstrips of bacon, and ate them over a period of nine days. During all this timehe was in a state of sexual excitement.‘His state of mind while he described these things in minute detail was apeculiar mixture. He spoke in a matter-of-fact way, like a housewife describingher favourite methods of cooking. You had to remind yourself that this was alittle girl that he was talking about. But at times his tone of voice and facialexpression indicated a kind of satisfaction and ecstatic thrill. However youdefine the medical and legal borders of sanity, this certainly is beyond thatborder.’It became apparent that Fish was a wanted killer who had become known as ‘theBrooklyn Vampire’, who committed four child murders in 1933 and 1934, luringlittle girls to a basement, flogging them, then garrotting them with a rope. In1932, a sixteen-year-old girl had been killed and mutilated near Massapequa,Long Island, where Fish was painting a house. Other murders almost certainlycommitted by Fish were those of seven-year-old Francis X. McDonnell on StatenIsland in 1924, four-year-old Billy Gaffney in Brooklyn in 1927, andeleven-year-old Yetta Abramowitz, who was strangled and mutilated in the Bronxin 1927. (Billy Gaffney’s mother subsequently had a series of nervous breakdownsfrom grief.) Detective Will King, who investigated these murders, was notallowed to introduce them as evidence, since the D.A. was anxious to prove thatFish was sane, and too many murders might throw doubt on this.To Fish’s delight, he was sentenced to death – he remarked with unconscioushumour that being electrocuted would be ‘the supreme thrill of my life’. When hewas on Death Row, the prison chaplain had to ask him not to ‘holler and howl’ soloud as he masturbated during services. In the execution chamber on 16 January1936 he mumbled ‘I don’t know why I’m here’ just before the switch was thrown.Wertham records that he tried hard to get Fish’s sentence commuted. ‘To executea sick man is like burning witches’, he told the prison governor. He went on tomake this important observation – even more relevant today than it was in 1936:‘Science is prediction. The science of psychiatry is advanced enough that withproper examination such a man as Fish can be detected and confined before theperpetration of these outrages, instead of inflicting extreme penaltiesafterwards. The authorities had this man, but the records show that they paid noattention.’ Understandably, the governor was unmoved. Like the D.A, he probablyrecognised that Fish was legally insane, but felt that it made no difference –that there was no point in burdening society with the keep of such a man. WhatWertham had failed to recognise is that the execution of a murderer like Fishactually serves a ritual function. The public wants to see sadistic killersexecuted, in the same way that children want fairy stories to end with thedefeat of the wicked giant. It serves the purpose of exorcising the horror.In December 1927 twelve-year-old Marion Parker, daughter of a Los Angelesbanker, was kidnapped. When her father went to the appointed spot to pay theransom, he saw his daughter sitting in a car beside the kidnapper; the man tookthe money and promised to. let Marion out at the end of the street. She provedto be dead, her hands and legs hacked off, her body disembowelled, and hereyelids propped open with wire. A bloodstained suitcase found the next day wastraced back to a man named William Edward Hickman, who had a grudge againstMarion’s father, and he was eventually arrested in Washington State. Psychiatricexamination revealed that he was insane, believing that angels had ordered himto kidnap Marion. Yet although his insanity was beyond doubt, so was hisultimate execution; the horror of the crime demanded the ritual exorcism in thedeath chamber, or at least in a prison cell. The serial killer has no monopolyon irrationality.What turns a man into a sado-masochist? In the case of Albert Fish, fortunately,we know the answer. In 1875, his father suffered a heart attack in thePennsylvania Station. Unable to provide for twelve children, Ellen Fish wasforced to consign most of them to an orphanage. The five-year-old boy had noidea why he had been suddenly abandoned; he was deeply miserable, and at firstran away repeatedly. Discipline in the St John’s Refuge was rigid and severe;the matron made them pray for hours every day and made them memorise chaptersfrom the Bible. The slightest infringement of discipline was punished byflogging, administered by the matron. Fish discovered that he enjoyed beingwhipped on his naked bottom. His fellow orphans teased him because punishmentalways gave him an erection. What they did not know was that watching other boysbeing whipped also produced sexual excitement in him. Since it was aco-educational institution (although the boys and girls were kept strictlysegregated outside class) there was naturally a great deal of sex talk. After awhile, the young Fish was initiated into masturbation and other sex games. Bythe time his mother took him away from the orphanage two years later – she hadobtained a government job – sado-masochism had been firmly ‘imprinted’ in theseven-year-old boy. He told Wertham of an occasion when he and some friends hadsoaked a horse’s tail in kerosene and set it on fire.He was a sickly and introverted child, and a fall from a cherry tree producedconcussion; thereafter he suffered severe headaches, dizzy spells and a severestutter. (It has been pointed out that a large number of serial killers havesuffered head injuries in childhood.) He continued to wet the bed for manyyears, and his companions taunted him about it. Fish’s reaction to the jeers wasto retreat into a world of daydreams. At about this time he insisted on beingcalled Albert (the name of a dead younger brother) rather than Hamilton becausehis schoolmates called him Ham and Eggs. He began to suffer from convulsivefits.The daydreams were often of being beaten or watching others being beaten. Whenhis elder brother Walter came home from the Navy and showed Albert books withpictures of naked men and women, and told him stories of cannibalism which heclaimed to have witnessed, more sado-masochistic traits were ‘imprinted’. Hisfavourite reading was Poe’s story ‘The Pit and the Pendulum’, with its detailsof mental torture, and this led him on to study everything he could find aboutthe Spanish Inquisition. He became a devotee of true murder cases, and begancarrying newspaper clippings in his pockets until they disintegrated. (He wascarrying an account of the Hanover ‘butcher’ Fritz Haarmann when he wasarrested.) Yet at the same time he continued to be a devoted student of theBible, and to dream of becoming a clergyman. Having become habituated to sexualand religious fantasy from an early age, he saw no contradiction between them.When he was twelve, Fish began a homosexual relationship with a telegraph boywho excited him by describing what he had seen in brothels. This youth alsointroduced to Fish peculiar practices such as drinking urine and tastingexcreta. By his late teens, Fish was tormented with a violent and permanentsexual appetite that never left him alone. (But this is less unusual than itsounds; the majority of teenagers could tell a similar story.) When he moved toNew York at the age of twenty, he quickly became a male prostitute, and spentmuch of his weekends at public baths where he could watch boys. It was at thistime that he began raping small boys. By now the pattern was set, and even amarriage – arranged by his mother – failed to change it. A period in Sing Sing –for embezzlement – virtually ended the marriage, and he returned tohomosexuality. After his wife’s desertion, he began to show signs of mentaldisturbance; he heard voices, and on one occasion wrapped himself up in a carpetand explained that he was following the instructions of St John. Then began hisperiod of wandering around the United States and working as a painter anddecorator; during this time, he told Wertham, he raped more than a hundredchildren, mostly boys under six.When he was twenty-eight, a male lover took him to see the waxworks gallery in amuseum; there he was fascinated by a medical display showing the bisection of apenis. He returned to see it many times, and ‘imprinting’ occurred again,leading to a new obsession with castration. During a relationship with amentally defective homosexual, Fish tied him up and tried to castrate him. Therush of blood frightened him and he fled. Now he began adding castration to hisrapes, on one occasion severing a child’s penis with a pair of scissors. Hebegan going to brothels where he could be spanked and whipped. He committed hisfirst murder – of a male homosexual – in Wilmington in 1910. In 1919 hemutilated and tortured to death a mentally retarded boy. From now on, murderalso became a part of his pattern of perversion.Here, then, we are able to study in unusual detail the development of asado-masochistic obsession. It is impossible to doubt that it began in the StJohn’s Refuge in 1875, when he was first whipped by the matron of the EpiscopalSisterhood. It is possible to say with some degree of confidence that if Fishhad not been sent to an orphanage at the age of five, he would never havedeveloped into one of the most remarkable examples of ‘polymorphous perversion’in the history of sexual abnormality.Then why did his fellow orphans never achieve the same dubious notoriety?Presumably because they lacked his intensely introverted temperament, thetendency to brood and daydream about sex and pain. In short, they lacked theability to retreat so totally into a world of fantasy. It is difficult to avoidthe conclusion that what turned Fish into a dangerous pervert was precisely thesame tendency to morbid brooding and fantasy that turned Edgar Allan Poe into awriter of genius.How far does this enable us to understand the serial killer? It enables us, atleast, to grasp that there is a link between his abnormality and what werecognise as normality. Fish was turned into a serial killer by a kind of‘hothouse’ conditioning that led him to spend most of his childhood broodingabout sex. We must bear in mind that he was born in 1870, at a time when sexcrime was almost non-existent. By the time of the Jack the Ripper murders, Fishwas eighteen – old enough, in theory, to have committed them himself. But he wasstill living in a world of Victorian morality and Victorian behaviour, where‘dirty books’ were still banned – most of the ‘obscenity’ prosecutions of thatperiod now strike us as incomprehensible – and prostitution regarded with deepdisapproval. Fish became a fully-fledged pervert by accident, starting with theaccident of being sent to an orphanage at the age of five. If Fish had beenalive today, he would have had no difficulty finding material to feed hisfantasies, from hard porn magazines to ‘snuff videos’. In most large Americancities he would have found streets lined with male and female ‘hookers’ willingto cater to every perversion. It becomes possible to see why, some twenty-fiveyears after the relaxation of the laws governing pornography, serial crimesuddenly began to develop into an epidemic.There is an important basic difference between Albert Fish and the other killersin this chapter. Fish enjoyed pain, and so when he inflicted it on his victims,he felt – in some obscure and muddled way – that he was doing them a favour. Theimpulse that drove Hooker, Glatman, Fearn, Folk and even Robert Poulin was puresexual aggression, the will to power. But the development of the obsessionfollowed the same path in all of them, including Fish: fantasy fuelled byfrustration. The fantasy, in turn, is subject to ‘the law of diminishingreturns’, so that it becomes distorted and unbalanced. This seems to be one ofthe few basic rules in the development of sadists and sex killers.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/chapter_004.xhtml#fn001] The Criminal Personality by Samuel Yochelsonand Stanton Samenow, 3 vols, New York 1976–88."},{"pageContent":"FiveThe Jekyll and Hyde SyndromeIT SEEMS SELF-EVIDENT that, if Fish had not been caught, he would have gone onkilling indefinitely; but is this obvious ‘truth’ as incontestable as it seems?A man who does not wish to be caught does not write a letter in a traceableenvelope, with the telltale initials merely inked out. It is almost as if hewanted to be caught – or as if, at least, he no longer cared. This seems to be aversion of the ‘suicide syndrome’ discussed in the first chapter. (One third ofall murderers commit suicide.)To recognise the ‘suicide syndrome’ is also to recognise that sadistic killersare not really a species apart from other human beings. They become suicidal forbasically the same reason that anyone else does: because they recognise thattheir lives are unfulfilled, and are likely to remain so. When the killerrecognises clearly that his actions have turned him into a social outcast, a‘monster’, the result may be suicide, or some absurd ‘mistake’ that leads to hisarrest. He is, in effect, two people, a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The ‘mistake’ isJekyll’s attempt to destroy Hyde.On 10 December 1945 a maid entering the Chicago apartment of a thirty-year-oldex-Wave named Frances Brown was alarmed to see that the pillow on the bed wasbloodstained; in the bathroom she found the woman’s naked body draped over theside of the bath. On the wall over the bed, someone had scrawled in lipstick:For heavenssake catch meBefore I kill moreI cannot control myselfFrances Brown was kneeling beside the bath, and she was naked. A pyjama top hadbeen folded loosely round her neck; when this was removed, police discovered aknife driven in with such force that it protruded from the other side of herthroat. She had also been shot twice. The body had been carefully washed afterdeath, and wet bloodstained towels lay on the floor.Four weeks later, on the morning of 7 January 1946, James E. Degnan went intothe bedroom of his seven-year-old daughter Suzanne, and saw that she was not inher bed, and that the window was wide open. He called the police, and it was apoliceman who found the note on the child’s chair; it said she had beenkidnapped and demanded $20,000 for her return. Later that afternoon, Suzanne’shead was discovered beneath a nearby manhole cover. In another sewer policefound the child’s left leg. The right leg was found in another sewer, and thetorso in a third. The arms were discovered – also in a sewer – some weeks later.The case shocked the nation, but the police seemed to be unable to develop anydefinite leads.Six months later, on 26 June 1946, a young man walked into an apartment buildingin Chicago, and entered the apartment of Mr and Mrs Pera through the open door;Mrs Pera was in the kitchen preparing dinner. A neighbour who had seen the youngman enter called to Mrs Pera to ask if she knew a man had walked into herapartment. The young man immediately left, but the neighbour called him to stop.Instead, he ran down the stairs. He pointed a gun at a man who tried to stophim, then ran out of the building. Minutes later, he knocked on the door of anearby apartment and asked the woman who answered for a glass of water,explaining he felt ill. She sensed something wrong and rang the police. In fact,an off-duty policeman had already seen the fleeing youth, and ran after him.When cornered, the young man fired three shots at the policeman; all missed. Asother police answered the call, the burglar and the police grappled on thefloor. Then one of the policemen hit him on the head – three times – with aflowerpot, and knocked him unconscious.The prisoner turned out to be a seventeen-year-old youth named William GeorgeHeirens, and he had spent some time in a correctional institution for burglary.When his fingerprints were taken, they were found to match one found on theDegnan ransom note, and another found in the apartment of Frances Brown. In theprison hospital, Heirens was given the ‘truth drug’ sodium pentathol, and asked:‘Did you kill Suzanne Degnan?’ Heirens answered: ‘George cut her up.’ At firsthe insisted that George was a real person, a boy five years his senior whom hemet at school. Later, he claimed that George was his own invisible alter-ego.‘He was just a realization of mine, but he seemed real to me.’ Heirens alsoadmitted to a third murder, that of a forty-three-year-old widow, Mrs JosephineRoss, who had awakened while he was burgling her apartment on 5 June 1945;Heirens stabbed her through the throat. In addition to this, he had attacked awoman named Evelyn Peterson with an iron bar when she started to wake up duringa burglary, then tied her up with lamp cord; he had also fired shots throughwindows at two women who had been sitting in their rooms with the curtainsundrawn.The story of William Heirens, as it emerged in his confessions, and ininterviews with his parents, was almost predictably typical of a serial sexkiller. Born on 15 November 1928, he had been a forceps delivery. He was anunderweight baby, and cried and vomited a great deal. At the age of seven monthshe fell down twelve cement steps into the basement and landed on his head; afterthat he had nightmares about falling. He was three years old when a brother wasborn, and he was sent away to the home of his grandmother. He was frequently illas a child, and broke his arm at the age of nine. The family background was farfrom happy; his mother had two nervous breakdowns accompanied by paralysis, andhis father’s business failed several times.Heirens matured very early sexually – he had his first emission at the age ofnine. Soon after this, he began stealing women’s panties from clotheslines andbasement washrooms, and putting them on. (After his arrest, police found fortypairs of pink and blue rayon panties in a box in his grandmother’s attic.) Hecame to think of sex as something ‘dirty’ and forbidden. This was confirmedwhen, at the age of thirteen, he walked into the school washroom and found twoboys playing sexually with a mentally retarded boy; he refused to join in. Beinga good-looking boy, he was attractive to girls; on eight occasions he attemptedsome form of sex play, touching their breasts or pressing their legs, but thishad the effect of upsetting him so much that he cried. There was a deep conflictbetween his sexual obsession and his rigid Catholic upbringing. He found normalsexual stimulation repellent. From the age of thirteen he had been burglingapartments, entering through the window, and experiencing sexual excitement – tothe point of emission – as he did so. After this, he lost interest in underwear,and began to experience his sexual fulfilment by entering strange apartmentsthrough the window. He often urinated or defecated on the floor. He also beganlighting small fires.He was arrested for the first time in the same year – 1942 – charged with elevenburglaries and suspected of fifty; in many of them he had stolen guns andwomen’s dresses. He was sentenced to probation and sent to a semi-correctionalCatholic institution. After a year there he transferred to a Catholic academy,where he proved to be a brilliant student – so much so that he was allowed toskip the freshman year at the University of Chicago. Back in Chicago, the sexualobsession remained as powerful as ever, and led to more burglaries. If heresisted for long, he began to experience violent headaches. On one occasion, heput his clothes in the washroom and threw the key inside in order to make itimpossible to go out; halfway through the night, the craving became too strong,and he crawled along the house gutter to retrieve his clothes.Once inside an apartment, he was in such a state of intense excitement that anyinterruption would provoke an explosion of violence. This is why he knockedEvelyn Peterson unconscious with an iron bar when she stirred in her sleep. Onanother occasion he was preparing to enter what he thought was an emptyapartment when a woman moved inside; he immediately fired his gun at her, butmissed.None of the victims was raped – the thought of actual sexual intercourse stillscared him. Sexual fulfilment came from the ‘forbiddenness’, the excitement ofknowing he was committing a crime. After the ejaculation, he felt miserable; hebelieved that he was a kind of Jekyll and Hyde. He even invented a name for hisMr Hyde – George. Although he later admitted that the invention of an alter-egowas partly an attempt to fool the psychiatrists, there can be no doubt that hefelt that he was periodically ‘possessed’ by a monster. This is why he scrawledthe message in lipstick on the wall after killing Frances Brown. It may alsoexplain why he eventually courted arrest by wandering into a crowded apartmentblock in the late afternoon and entering a flat in which a married woman wascooking the dinner as she waited for her husband to return from work. Dr Jekyllwas turning in Mr Hyde. In July 1946 Heirens was sentenced to three terms oflife imprisonment in Joliet penitentiary.It is clear that, unlike most of the sex killers discussed in the previouschapter, Heirens was young enough to experience deep guilt about what he wasdoing. The same is true of Heinrich Pommerencke, a German serial killer of thepostwar years.On the morning of 9 June 1959 a tall, slim young man with a girlish complexionentered a tailor’s shop in Hornberg, in the Rastatt-Karlsruhe district of WestGermany. The tailor, Johann Kohler, was glad to see him, for the youth hadordered some clothes two months earlier, and had failed to collect them. Heexplained that he was working as a waiter in a hotel in Frankfurt, and pulledout a wad of notes to pay for the clothes. After changing in a cubicle, thecustomer looked at himself in a mirror and asked if he could leave his old greysuit behind while he went for a haircut. When the young man had gone, the tailordecided to move the suit – as well as a bulging briefcase – to a safer place. Ashe lifted them, the lid of the briefcase opened, and a sawn-off rifle fell out.It seemed a strange item for a respectable young man to be carrying about, andthe tailor decided to notify the police.The inspector who arrived from the local police station looked through thecontents of the briefcase; it proved to contain money, a box of cartridges, somepornographic literature, and half a rail ticket from Karlsruhe to Zingen. Theseitems made the inspector thoughtful. He had already received a report of arobbery at nearby Durlach railway station the previous night, and the burglarhad been interrupted by a railway employee. He had pointed a sawn-off rifle atthe employee and made his escape. It was obviously possible that the young man,whose name was Heinrich Pommerencke, was the burglar.The pornography and the railway ticket gave rise to another suspicion. A girlhad been raped in Zingen less than two weeks earlier by an intruder who hadclimbed through her bedroom window, and throttled her into submission. She hadseen the rapist in the moonlight, and her description sounded like the owner ofthe briefcase.When Pommerencke returned, the inspector asked him to accompany him to thepolice station. As soon as they were outside, the young man fled like a hare.The inspector chased him on his bicycle, and another passing policeman joined inthe chase. Pommerencke was cornered in a fairground and taken in handcuffs tothe police station.Commissioner Heinrich Koch also examined the contents of the briefcase, thenaccused the young man of the burglary at Durlach. He observed the look of reliefthat passed briefly over Pommerencke’s face, and knew that the inspector wasprobably right about the rape. In fact, Pommerencke not only admitted theDurlach burglary, but three others in the surrounding area. Two of these hadbeen at Karlsruhe and Rastatt. And Koch was aware that there had also been rapemurders in these places. In the previous March, there had been a rape murder inHornberg itself. But for the time being, Koch decided, he would allowPommerencke to think that he was only suspected of burglary.Two weeks later, in police headquarters in Freiburg, Heinrich Pommerencke wasidentified by the rape victim from Zingen as the man who had entered herbedroom. Pommerencke heatedly denied that he was the rapist. Then a waitress whohad been attacked in Karlsruhe – but managed to escape – also identified him asher assailant. When Koch tried a bluff, and told him that blood spots found onhis grey suit had been identified as belonging to the same group as three murdervictims, Pommerencke finally lost heart and decided to confess.It was the typical story of a sex criminal. Born in Bentwisch, near Rostock inEast Germany, in 1937, Pommerencke had been the child of a broken marriage. Hehad been an abnormally lonely child, but had been in the grip of a powerfulsexual urge from an early age. ‘When I was a boy I never had a friend in theworld . . .Other men always had girlfriends with them. I wanted girlfriends too,but I never succeeded.’ He was shy, clumsy and tongue-tied. At the age offifteen he began hanging around the local dance hall and made a few clumsyattempts to attack girls. In 1953, at the age of sixteen, he fled to WestGermany and found work as a waiter and a handyman. He also served a term in jailfor burglary. He always lived alone in rented rooms, read pornography, anddaydreamed of sex.Then, in late February 1959, in Karlsruhe, he went to see a film called The TenCommandments. ‘I saw half-naked women dancing around the golden calf. I thoughtthen that many women were evil and did not deserve to live. I knew then I wouldhave to kill.’When he left the cinema he bought a knife, then followed a pretty waitress downa deserted street. He seized her from behind and threw her to the ground,tearing at her clothes. When he held a knife to her throat, she screamed, and apassing taxi driver heard her. As the taxi approached, Pommerencke fled. Hisdesire was so overpowering that he continued to stalk women. He followed athirty-four-year-old cleaning woman, Hilda Konther, and attacked her near herhome. This time no one heard the scream. The next morning, her body was foundlying in some bushes; she had been raped and stabbed to death, and the clotheshad been literally torn from her body by a man who was obviously in a sexualfrenzy.On 26 March 1959 he stalked an eighteen-year-old beautician, Karin Walde, inHornberg; he knocked her unconscious with a heavy stone, then tore off herclothes and raped her. Finally, he killed her, using the stone as a bludgeon.On 2 June 1959 Pommerencke bought a platform ticket at Freiburg, and slipped onboard the Italian Riviera Express. There he waited on the front platform of oneof the carriages until he saw a girl go into the toilet. He removed the bulbfrom the ceiling of the corridor, and as the girl came out, seized her andhurled her out of the open platform door and on to the line. Then he pulled thecommunication cord and, as the train came to a halt, jumped off and hurried backdown the line. He found his victim – twenty-one-year-old teaching student DagmarKlimek – unconscious beside the tracks, about two miles back. He dragged herinto the bushes, tore off her clothes and raped her. Then he stabbed her throughthe heart. When daylight came, he walked to the village of Ebringen, washed inthe fountain, then hitched a lift with a motorist back to Freiburg.Five days later, on 8 June, he waited near the station at Rastatt. Aneighteen-year-old secretary, Rita Walterspacher, came out of the station andturned down a deserted road. As Pommerencke moved swiftly towards her, the girlsensed that she was about to be attacked, and ran away screaming. A woman on thetrain saw the running girl, and noted that the man who was pursuing her wastall, young and wore a grey suit. As she watched, he flung his arms round thegirl and pulled her into some woods at the side of the road. The woman assumedthat they were a courting couple playing games, and forgot about it until sheheard on the radio of the disappearance of a young girl near Rastatt. RitaWalterspacher’s body was found concealed under a pile of branches. She had beenstrangled, and her clothing torn off her. Her purse was missing from her handbag– Pommerencke made a habit of taking any money he found on his victims.To the police investigating the case, it was obvious that the murderer was a manin the grip of such sexual frenzy that he would pursue a screaming girl in fullview of a train, and drag her into the woods. The similarity in method in allfour rape murders convinced them that all were committed by the same man, andthat he would go on killing until he was caught. By the time RitaWalterspacher’s body was discovered later that day, the rapist was already incustody in the Hornberg police station, having made the absurd mistake ofleaving his briefcase containing the sawn-off rifle in a tailor’s shop . . .Like William Heirens, Pommerencke was not cut out to be a serial killer; hiscrimes produced a powerful inner conflict, deep feelings of guilt. CommissionerGut, head of the Freiburg murder squad, had speculated that the murderer ofHilda Konther and Karin Walde was a Jekyll and Hyde personality. And Pommerenckeadmitted after his arrest: ‘Everything I did was cruel and bestial. From thebottom of my heart I would like to undo all this.’ His incredibly careless actof leaving a gun in a tailor’s shop may be interpreted as his own attempt toundo it all. On 22 October 1960 he received a life sentence with hard labour.The foregoing cases underline a point of fundamental importance for theunderstanding of the criminal personality: that by definition, all criminals areself-divided. The criminal is one who decides to take what he wants from societyby force or stealth. In the act of doing this, he has become an ‘outsider’ –that is, he has placed himself outside society, ‘beyond the pale’. But he has nodesire to remain outside society; that would amount to psychological suicide. In1961, two American psychologists, Samuel Yochelson and Stanton Samenow, began aprogramme to study criminals in St Elizabeth’s Hospital, Washington DC. Bothwere liberals who believed that criminals were really ‘victims of society’,people with ‘deep psychologic problems’. The conclusions they reached dismayedthem both. In their book The Criminal Personality, they admit that they havefound that the chief characteristics of the criminal are weakness, vanity andself-delusion. ‘The greatest fear of these criminals was that others would seesome weakness in them and they reacted very angrily to being “put down”.’ Thatis to say, the urge to self-esteem – to be liked and respected by others – wasparamount in them. Men who distinguish themselves in the public eye, fromcreative geniuses to famous sportsmen, are doing something of which everyone canapprove. As the criminal commits a crime, he knows that he is doing somethingwhich, if discovered, will turn him into an outcast. So there is a basicconflict between his criminality and his craving to be admired. (In thisrespect, the Mafia forms an exceptionally interesting subject of sociologicalstudy, in its attempt to transform the criminal into an accepted member ofsociety, a ‘man of respect’.) A part of him dreams of taking the ‘social route’to self-esteem, becoming respected and famous. Another part is in a hurry and isin favour of taking short-cuts. (Every crime is in essence a short-cut.) RobertPoulin, William Heirens and Heinrich Pommerencke developed an exceptionallypowerful sex-drive at an early age, when normal fulfilment seemed only a remotepossibility. Since most young people are notoriously amoral – a child is moreconcerned with his own needs than other people’s – they found it easy to driftinto sex crime. As the personality matures, there is a subconscious recognitionthat this conflicts with the urge to self-esteem, the desire to be ‘recognised’.Jekyll becomes increasingly resentful of the Hyde who is obstructing hisevolution. It is arguable that, in Poulin’s case, this led to the decision tocommit suicide, and, in the case of Heirens and Pommerencke, to the act ofcarelessness that led to arrest.We have seen that specific patterns of crime can be identified with specificperiods. You would not expect a sadistic sex murder to be committed in, say,1810 – not because men were less corrupt and degenerate in 1810, but becausesexual sadism had not yet emerged in the field of criminal activity. Similarly,the crime of self-esteem seems to be a phenomenon that emerges in the 1960s. Itis hard to imagine a murderer of the 1940s saying, like Robert Smith: ‘I wantedto become known, to get myself a name.’Crime – particularly murder – produces the feeling of being ‘beyond the pale’.Case after case demonstrates that the ‘self-esteem killer’ copes with thisproblem in a manner reminiscent of the Marquis de Sade: by telling himself that,in the war against society, he is in the right and society is in the wrong. Thisexplains why such killers often keep journals. If possible, he finds himself anaccomplice – or, in the case of the Manson clan, a group of accomplices – whoshare his antisocial outlook. If he lacks accomplices, he may choose the rathermore dangerous course of taking a ‘normal’ acquaintance into his confidence. Inthis way, Dr Jekyll can be propitiated by a kind of intellectual sleight ofhand: if a ‘normal’ person knows about his crimes, then they cannot be trulyabnormal, and he himself cannot be ‘outside society’.One of the most characteristic of such cases occurred in America in the late1950s; although it involved sex crime, the self-esteem element is so obtrusivethat the case may be regarded as a kind of watershed or turning point.On Sunday, 11 January 1959 an old blue Chevrolet forced another car off a lonelycountry road in Virginia, and a tall, thin young man with staring eyes advancedon it waving a revolver. He ordered the Jackson family – consisting of CarrolJackson, his wife Mildred, and their two children, Susan, age five, and a baby,Janet – into the boot of his car, and sped off. Carrol Jackson was later founddead in a ditch; underneath him lay Janet, who had also been shot. Two monthslater, the bodies of Mildred Jackson and Susan were uncovered in Maryland;Mildred Jackson had been strangled with a stocking and Susan battered to death.Two years earlier, in June 1957, a man with staring eyes had approached acourting couple in a car – an army sergeant and a woman named Margaret Harold –and asked for a lift. On the way he pulled out a gun and demanded money; whenMargaret Harold said: ‘Don’t give it to him’, he shot her in the back of thehead. The sergeant flung open the door and ran. When police found the car, theyalso found the body of Margaret Harold lying across the front seat without herdress; a police spokesman described the killer as ‘a sexual degenerate’. Nearthe scene of the crime the police discovered a deserted shack full ofpornographic pictures.Five months after the murders of the Jackson family, in May 1959, the policereceived an anonymous tip-off that the murderer was a jazz musician named MelvinRees; but police were unable to trace Rees. Early the following year, a salesmannamed Glenn Moser went to the police, acknowledged that he was the author of theanonymous tip-off, and told them that he now had the suspect’s address: MelvinRees was working in a music shop in Memphis, Arkansas. Rees was arrested there,and soon after he was identified by the army sergeant as the man who had shotMargaret Harold. A search of the home of Rees’s parents uncovered the revolverwith which Carrol Jackson had been shot, and a diary describing the abduction ofthe Jacksons and their murder. ‘Caught on a lonely road . . .Drove to a selectarea and killed the husband and baby. Now the mother and daughter were allmine.’ He described forcing Mildred Jackson to perform oral sex, and then rapingher repeatedly; the child was also apparently raped. (Full details have neverbeen released.) He concluded: ‘I was her master.’ The diary also described thesex murders of four more girls in Maryland. Rees was executed in 1961.Violent sex murders were common enough by the late 1950s. What makes this oneunique for its period was Rees’s ‘Sadeian’ attitude of self-justification. Onthe night before the Jackson killings, Rees had been on a ‘benzedrine kick’, andin the course of a rambling argument had told Moser: ‘You can’t say it’s wrongto kill. Only individual standards make it right or wrong.’ He had alsoexplained that he wanted to experience everything: love, hate, life,death . . .When, after the murders, Moser asked him outright whether he was thekiller, Rees disdained to lie; he simply refused to answer, leaving Moser todraw the self-evident conclusion. Rees was an ‘intellectual’ who, like Moorsmurderer Ian Brady in the following decade, made the decision to rape and killon the grounds that ‘everything is lawful’. He may therefore be regarded as oneof the first examples of the curious modern phenomenon, the ‘high IQ killer’.His sexual fantasies involved sadism (Mildred Jackson’s death had been long andagonising) and power. In that sense, his crimes anticipate those of the serialkiller who was to emerge two decades later.Unfortunately we know nothing of Rees’s background, or what turned him into aserial killer. Yet on the basis of other cases, we can state with a fair degreeof confidence that parental affection was lacking in childhood, and that he wasa lonely introverted child who was not much liked by his schoolmates. It isdifficult, if not impossible, to find a case of a serial killer of whom this isnot true.Rees and Glatman are early examples of the ‘power-motivated’ criminal, acategory that would become so familiar in the 1980s. Germany’s version of theCameron Hooker case came to public attention in May 1984. On 3 May anineteen-year-old girl named Beate Koch was walking along a country road nearthe village of Pillnach – not far from Regensburg – when she was attacked by aman who dragged her into the nearest house – his own. She recognised him as amember of the academic community from the University of Regensburg, Dr UlrichKochwald, whose field was sexual research. Kochwald was an odd-looking man – sixfeet four inches tall and very thin, with protruding eyes that were magnified bypebble glasses; the top of his head was bald, but thin blond hair descended fromthe back and sides to his shoulders. Having threatened to kill her if she didn’tstop struggling, Kochwald tore off her clothes, raped her, and beat her with arope. Then he handcuffed her and forced her down to the basement, where she wassurprised to discover that she was not the only prisoner. Another handcuffedgirl was confined there – also naked – hanging from a hook in the ceiling. Thiswas twenty-four-year-old Sabine Pauli; she was one of Kochwald’s students, andhad been flattered when he invited her to lunch one day. After lunch, he hadattacked her, raped her, and taken her to the basement, where she had been eversince. Kochwald beat her regularly and treated her as a ‘sex slave’. Since herfamily lived far away, no-one had yet noticed her disappearance.That night, Beate Koch succeeded in escaping. The two women were close enoughtogether for Beate to lift herself by locking her legs around her companion, andjerking the handcuffs clear of the hook in the ceiling. Sabine urged her not tobother about releasing her, but to leave as quickly as possible. Beate staggeredhome through the dark, and arrived there covered in mud and scratches. Herparents had notified the police of her disappearance, and a local sergeant hadalready obtained search warrants for various houses along the road between thevillages. Within a short time the sergeant was knocking on Dr Kochwald’s door;when Kochwald opened it, the sergeant informed him that he was under arrest, andhandcuffed him to a radiator. Then he hurried down to the basement, and freedSabine Pauli, who was covered with bruises and cigarette burns.Newspaper publicity caused another of Kochwald’s victims to come forward. Hername was Susanne Wagner, and she had lived with Kochwald for some time after thebreak-up of his marriage. But they had quarrelled a great deal, and on 4 June1981 she had announced that she was leaving him. Kochwald’s reaction was tohandcuff her, tear off her clothes, and drag her to the basement, where he hadhung her from a hook in the ceiling, then beat her with a rope. He hadterrorised her and kept her prisoner for the next year. Sometimes she washandcuffed to the kitchen stove, sometimes to the radiator in Kochwald’sbedroom. Later, when he was certain that she was too terrified to try to escape– he told her he would hunt her down and kill her – he even allowed her to goaround without handcuffs. He kept her naked, hoping that this would deter herfrom showing herself in public. On 24 May 1982 she managed to slip her handcuffsby greasing her wrists with soap, and escaped through a window. A passingmotorist took her to hospital, but Susanne was so afraid of Kochwald that shehad told no-one of her year in captivity.On 22 May 1986 Ulrich Kochwald was sentenced to five and a half years in jailfor kidnapping.As in the case of Melvin Rees, we know nothing of the psychological backgroundthat turned Kochwald into a sadist. But other cases in this chapter wouldsuggest that this unnattractive man – noted at the university for the dullnessof his lectures – had been an unattractive and lonely child, with a tendency tofantasise. The latter is confirmed by Susanne Wagner, to whom he had confidedthat he had always dreamed of keeping several women as sex slaves, and that hehad once enquired into the possibility of becoming a Mohammedan – so that hecould have four wives – but had discovered that in Germany bigamy is illegal,even for Moslems.We have seen that the Jekyll and Hyde syndrome has many strange variations. Thesufferer may attempt to deal with it through a variety of techniques, rangingfrom intellectual self-justification in the manner of de Sade to making someabsurd error that leads to arrest. In a few cases, the ‘suicide syndrome’results in actual self-destruction.On 16 July 1973 a hysterical teenage girl who identified herself as Mary EllenJones rushed into a police station in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and told thepolice that her boyfriend had been murdered, and that she had been repeatedlyraped by the killer. Two days previously, the young couple – who had met onlythe day before on the local beach – had been offered a lift by a middle-aged mandriving a white Dodge van. He had introduced himself as ‘Eric’, and offered togive them work in his home in south Miami. Once inside the bungalow, the man hadthreatened them with a gun and told them to undress. Then he ordered them toperform various abnormal sex acts while he took photographs. In order to holdthe camera, he had to place the gun beside him. The youth – sixteen-year-oldMark Matson – waited his chance, then hurled himself at their tormentor. He wasnot quick enough; ‘Eric’ snatched up the gun and fired three times, hitting theyouth in the head, shoulder and chest. Then he dragged the body into thebathroom, and took the girl through a steel-lined door and into a soundproofcompartment at the end of his bedroom. There he shackled her to the wall, andraped her repeatedly for twenty-four hours. At the end of that time, when shewas expecting to die, he unchained her, telling her: ‘I’ve taken a life, but nowI’m going to give you your life.’ He drove her back into Fort Lauderdale andreleased her.She hurried to the nearest police station. When the police learned she was arunaway, they telephoned her home in Frankfort, Kentucky; the girl’s mother toldthem that she was a pathological liar, and advised them not to believe a wordshe said. The mother then wired money, and the girl was sent home by plane toKentucky.Five days later, on Saturday, 21 July 1973, a housewife in South Dade County wasremoving washing from her clothesline when she noticed that her next-doorneighbour, Albert Brust, was sitting in a chair on his lawn, oblivious of thefalling rain. And when her son mentioned that Brust had been there for the pasttwo days, she rang the Fort Lauderdale police and told them: ‘I think there’s adead man in the garden next door.’An autopsy revealed that Albert Brust, a forty-four-year-old Dade Countybuilding inspector, had taken a dose of cyanide in chocolate milk. When thepolice entered his house, they noticed the unpleasant smell, like rotting meat.It came from the bathroom. When the shower curtain was pulled aside, they foundthemselves looking at a wall of concrete, from which a little blood was seeping.It had to be demolished piecemeal before it revealed a mutilated body, minus itshands, feet and head. The head had been obscenely placed between the thighs, andthe hands and feet were found embedded in the concrete. At that point, thepolice remembered Mary Ellen Jones’s story, and realised that she must have beentelling the truth.A search of the rest of the house made it clear that Albert Brust was a ‘sexfreak’ obsessed with torture. In fact, the room at the end of the bedroom – inwhich the teenage girl had been raped – had obviously been designed as a torturechamber, with chains hanging from the ceiling, and a variety of whips, cat o’nine tails, belts and padlocks. An item of furniture of peculiar design wasapparently a ‘Chinese raping stool’. There were also pornographic videos andbooks, and obscene pictures on the walls. Yet he possessed many gramophonerecords, and the bookcase contained a wide range of philosophical texts, fromSpinoza and Voltaire to Unamuno and William James’s Varieties of ReligiousExperience. Brust also owned several volumes of the Marquis de Sade, whose workshad been published openly in America in the 1960s.Investigation into Brust’s background revealed that he was a New Yorker, born in1929. When he was twenty-one, he had been sentenced to a term of from three toten years in jail for abduction, assault, robbery and grand larceny. In prisonhe learned carpentry and welding, and taught himself calculus. He became aconstruction worker for twelve years before moving, in 1972, to Dade County,Florida, where he obtained a position as an inspector of buildings. This ugly,short little man had few friends. He drove a powerful motor cycle, andfrequented a local motor-cycle shop, apparently hoping to find sex (he wasbisexual). The owner of the shop commented that Brust described himself as aJekyll and Hyde personality, and that he talked a great deal of sex, suicide andmurder. Brust had told him that he had killed someone in New York and disposedof the body in the East River, and that he had once ‘concreted’ somebody. ‘Whenyou first kill someone,’ Brust told him, ‘it’s like breaking the ice. It’s anobstacle in the beginning, but after that nothing.’These remarks led the police to dig up Brust’s back garden and to search hishouse carefully for more signs of ‘concreting’. They found nothing.Like so many ‘loners’, Brust kept a journal, and it revealed a negative, morbidpersonality. ‘Rape, murder, suicide. These thoughts are constantly withme . . .Of course, this is not mentally ‘healthy’ – there is no doubt that bypresent standards I am mentally ill, a hopeless sociopath.’ ‘My reason tells methat I have nothing to live for. Intellectually, sexually, occupationally,socially – everywhere a dead end. The pain now outweighs the pleasure and everyday adds weight to the logic of self-destruction.’ ‘I need this safety valve,this writing, to keep me straight and calm and determined to bring my – deathproject – to a successful end.’ The ‘death project’, apparently, was suicide. Hesuffered, he said, from ‘alienation and sexual frustration and creativeimpotence.’ There is a classic statement of the problem of the ‘romanticoutsider’: ‘While my books have a tranquilising effect on me, reinforcing the DrJekyll side of my personality, it is also true that they paralyse me intoinaction. They cause me to think about death, to be fatalistic and pessimistic,prone to suicide.’ ‘The culprit is my emotions. Once stirred, blind rage tendsto take over and I get both homicidal and suicidal.’ Brust’s philosophy was thatman was evil, that government was useless, and that society must be strictlycontrolled. These views led him to express admiration for Hitler; he alsoenjoyed talking, in a mock-German accent, about what should be done with Jews.Brust was irritable, sarcastic and aggressive. ‘He thought he was above everyoneelse,’ said one of his acquaintances. ‘And the terrible thing was, it was true.’Brust had passed a University of Chicago correspondence course in algebra andanalytic geometry; but years of frustration had developed a highly intolerantpersonality. ‘He hated Catholics, cats, dogs – almost everything,’ said themotor cycle shop owner. He craved a woman, but was only willing to contemplate arelationship with one who was willing to be his slave. He told a womanpsychology student that he had once thought of marrying a blonde femaleacquaintance, ‘big in bosom and bottom’, and decidedly dumb, but had changed hismind. Incredibly, it seems probable that, at forty-four, he was still a virgin.‘After work I always get home as soon as possible to enjoy my solitary sanctuaryand its music and books and TV. No sex yet, but I’m working on it – slowly, butwith determined resolve. I know what I want. I need someone for sex, yes – butnot an idiot I have to cater to. Enter the Brustian solution . . .’ The‘Brustian solution’ was to kidnap a girl and hold her as his slave in the‘torture chamber’. His opportunity came when he saw Mark Matson and Mary EllenJones hitchhiking out of Fort Lauderdale; but the orgy that followed left him asunsatisfied as the murder of Kim Rabat had left Robert Poulin – whom, in spiteof the twenty-seven-year age difference, Brust resembles in so many ways. ‘Ihave miscalculated’, Brust wrote.’ . . .1 know I can save the situation by a lotof disagreeable work’ – he obviously meant recovering Mark Matson’s body andburying it in the garden – ‘but I see no good reason for going on. What wouldcome next? The whole business is not worth it; life is not worth the troubleafter all.’ After completing this entry, he poured himself a glass of chocolatemilk, added cyanide, and sat down on his lawn to drink it.In 1987, another ‘sex slave’ case made headlines across America; this time ithad ended in two fatalities. The psychiatric evidence that emerged means that weknow a great deal more about Gary Heidnik than about Melvin Rees or AlbertBrust. But although a jury found him sane, there can be little doubt thatHeidnik was as psychotic as Albert Fish. The case offers an example of yetanother stratagem by which the unconscious mind deals with the problems of theJekyll and Hyde syndrome.Towards midnight on 24 March 1987 a black prostitute, Josefina Rivera, knockedfrantically on the door of her boyfriend’s apartment in Philadelphia. VincentNelson had not seen her since the previous November, when she had gone out on arainy evening to ‘turn a trick’. Now he was shocked to see how much she hadchanged in four months; she looked like a concentration-camp victim. He was evenmore startled by the words she was babbling – his first suspicion was that shewas full of drugs. She seemed to be saying that three women were being keptchained up in a basement, and that two more were dead. Nelson finally called thepolice. The two men who arrived in a squad car were at first equally sceptical;but when she showed them marks around her ankles where she had been manacled,they decided that it might be worth investigating after all. The house in whichJosefina alleged she had been held was three blocks away, on a slum streetcalled North Marshall. A thin-faced, bearded man opened the door, and raised hishands when he saw drawn guns. Had they come about his child support payments? hewanted to know. The policeman assured him it was more serious, and took him toheadquarters – the Sex Crimes Unit. His name was Gary Michael Heidnik, and hewas forty-three years old.At five o’clock the following morning, police with a search warrant broke downthe door at 3520 North Marshall Street – arousing the neighbours – and rusheddown to the basement. On a mattress in the middle of the room lay two blackwomen, huddled under blankets; they screamed as the police burst in, but whenthey realised that the intruders had come to rescue them, they shouted ‘We’refree!’ and kissed their hands. Neither seemed to be embarrassed by the fact thatthey were naked from the waist down. In a deep hole in the floor – covered overby a board – there was another black woman, this one completely naked, withshackles on her ankles and her wrists handcuffed behind her back.The story that emerged was appalling and incredible. Josefina Rivera had beenthe first captive. Heidnik, driving an expensive car, had picked her up towardsmidnight on 26 November 1986. Josefina was also impressed by the walls of hisbedroom, which were papered with five and ten dollar bills. After sex, she beganto dress again, but as she did so, Heidnik seized her by the throat andthrottled her until she came close to blacking out. When he released her, shegasped that she would do whatever he wanted if he promised not to hurt her. Hehandcuffed her and took her down to a cold, mildewy basement. There he chainedher, fixing around her ankle a clamp of the type used to suspend a car exhaust.The next day, he came down to the basement, and dug a hole in a spot where theconcrete had been removed. She was afraid it was her grave, but his manner as hetalked reassured her. He told her that what he wanted most in all the world wasa large family, and that he intended to capture ten women, keep them in thebasement, and make them all pregnant. He explained that he had once had a babydaughter by a black woman – he seemed uninterested in whites – but he had helpedher sister to escape from a mental institution. As a result he had been chargedwith the rape of the sister and sentenced to four years in prison – which wasunfair, since the sex had been voluntary. His daughter had been placed in ahome. ‘Society owes me a wife and family,’ he told her – after which he made herperform oral sex on him, then had vaginal sex with her.Later that day, Josefina succeeded in forcing open the boarded-up window, andscreamed as loud as she could, but the run-down neighbourhood was used toscreaming women; the only person who paid any attention was Heidnik, and he beather and threw her down the hole he had dug. Then he left her with the radioplaying rock at top volume.Two days later – on 29 November – Heidnik added another captive to his harem, awoman called Sandra Lindsay, who was black and mildly retarded. She hadapparently known Heidnik for years, and had even carried his baby – Heidnik hadbeen furious when she had had an abortion. She told Josefina that she had noidea why her former lover had made her a captive. She also mentioned theastonishing fact that Heidnik was a bishop in his own church.The following day Heidnik made her write a note to her mother, telling her thatshe would be in touch; he mailed this from New York.The basement was cold, permanently lit by a naked bulb, and covered in litter.The daily routine consisted of beatings, rapes, oral sex and a prison diet ofoatmeal and bread. No-one in the outside world seemed to know or care where theywere. In fact, Sandra’s mother had reported to the police that she thought herdaughter was being held by a man called Gary Heidnik, but a mentally retardedfriend of Heidnik’s whom the police questioned mis-spelled the name Heidaike,and when it failed to show up on the police computer – where there were severalentries under Heidnik’s name – the search was dropped.One by one, other captives were introduced to the basement. On 22 December itwas Lisa Thomas, a black high-school dropout who accepted a lift in Heidnik’sCadillac. On 1 January 1987 Deborah Dudley was added. Heidnik was to regret this– Debbie proved to be more argumentative than the other two, and had to bebeaten more often. On 18 January eighteen-year-old Jacqueline Askins, anotherprostitute, was ‘captured’. Her ankles were so small that he had to shackle themwith handcuffs. On 23 March he brought his final captive, a twenty-four-year-oldprostitute named Agnes Adams; Josefina Rivera – now allowed out of the cellar –had been with him when he picked her up. By then, two of his captives were dead.In February, Sandra Lindsay had been suspended from the ceiling by her hands fora week as a punishment for trying to escape from the hole. On 7 February shedied of exhaustion. On 18 March Heidnik filled the pit with water, made threewomen – exempting Josefina – climb into it, then tortured them with shocks froma bare electric wire. It touched Deborah Dudley’s chain and killed her.By that time, most of Sandra Lindsay’s body had been put through a meat grinder,and her head cooked in a saucepan. Three days after her death, neighbourscomplained of the stench of cooking meat. The policeman who investigated thecomplaint accepted Heidnik’s assurance that he had merely burnt his dinner. Hedid not ask to look into the cooking pot on the stove.In an attempt to make his captives deaf – so they could not hear him – Heidnikhad pushed a screwdriver into their ears and twisted it round, damaging theeardrums. Josefina Rivera was the only one who was not subjected to thistreatment. She had gained Heidnik’s trust by ‘snitching’ on the others when theyplotted to escape, and beating them under Heidnik’s orders. (She was not theonly one; Heidnik forced them all to beat one another.) She was often taken outto fast-food restaurants, and for rides in his Cadillac and Rolls-Royce. On 24March she finally persuaded him that it was time to go and see her family. Hetrusted her, and dropped her off at the spot where he had picked her up fourmonths earlier. She lost no time in rushing to the apartment of her boyfriend;by the next morning Heidnik was in custody. The sergeant who had arrested himhad found a human forearm in the freezer. A few days later, Josefina led policeto the body of Deborah Dudley, buried in a shallow grave in a wood in NewJersey.Any police officer with a knowledge of serial killers would have been able topredict certain elements in the early history of Gary Michael Heidnik, as itemerged during his psychiatric examination that he hated his father – probablyhis mother too, that his childhood had been loveless and lonely, that he hadbeen ridiculed by other children, that he was shy, and that much of hischildhood had been spent in a world of fantasy. All this would have beencorrect. In fact, he was an object of ridicule because of the shape of his head:he was called ‘football head’, and this was due to the fact that, at an earlyage, he had fallen out of a tree on to the crown of his head. (As alreadyremarked, there seems to be a remarkably high incidence of childhood headinjuries among serial killers.) After that, said his brother Terry, he hadexperienced a personality change.Gary Heidnik had been born in November 1943, son of a toolmaker in Cleveland,Ohio. His mother was of Creole descent, and was a heavy drinker. The result wasthat Heidnik’s parents separated when he was two. Ellen Heidnik would commitsuicide in 1970 when dying of cancer. The father, Michael Heidnik, soonremarried, and the stepmother did not take to her new children. The fathershowed them little affection; he was a stern disciplinarian. Gary was a bedwetter – another characteristic that the Quantico research unit found to betypical of serial killers – and his father would hang the soaking sheet out ofGary’s bedroom window for everyone to see. This is perhaps one reason why Garyloked forward to becoming a soldier. He attended a military academy in Virginiabefore – at the age of eighteen – he joined the army.From an early age Gary Heidnik had been fascinated by high finance – perhapsbecause his childhood fantasies involved becoming a millionaire. He read thefinancial pages as other children read comics, and when the opportunity finallypresented itself, showed himself to be a skilful operator in the stockmarket. Henever became a millionaire, but at the time of his arrest he had more than halfa million dollars.In the army Heidnik saved his money and became a ‘loan shark’. He lost $5,000when he was suddenly sent out to Germany. Here he was beset by the the mentalproblems that were to plague him for the rest of his life. He suffered fromdizzy spells and headaches. This may have been due to the head injury as achild, or to the fact that, like so many of the flower children of the sixties,he had been taking hallucinogenic drugs. Doctors prescribed Stelazine, a majortranquilliser with powerful effects. In January 1963, when he was nineteen, thearmy decided that he was a schizophrenic personality and granted him anhonourable discharge.Back in the US, he went to Philadelphia and began training as a psychiatricnurse; he also gained credits in a number of subjects at the University ofPennsylvania, including marketing. (His IQ was 130, about 30 above average.)Attempts at settling with his mother, then his father, were failures. His fatherwanted to get him permanently out of his life, and broke with him (as he haddone with Gary’s brother Terry). From then on he was in and out of mentalhospitals – a total of twenty-one times. He also attempted suicide thirteentimes. (His brother Terry also had mental problems and was suicidal.) He tookmany overdoses, drove his motor cycle head on into a truck, and drank down aground-up light bulb.In the spring of 1971 he drove to the west coast on a sudden impulse and, as hestood on the sea shore, had a revelation from God: to start a church. Whilestill under psychiatric treatment he joined the United Church of Ministers ofGod and founded his own congregation in Philadelphia. His aim, he says, was tocare for the mentally and physically handicapped. In this he was undoubtedlysincere. Although his church did not take up collections, it went in forfundraising activities such as bingo and loan-sharking. In 1975, Heidnik wasable to open an account with the stockbrokers Merrill Lynch, in the name of hischurch, with $1,500. With skilful investment, it made him a rich man.In 1976 Heidnik had his first brush with the law. A man to whom he was rentingan apartment tried to climb into a locked basement to switch on the electricity,which Heidnik had turned off. Heidnik was waiting for him with a gun, and fired;the man turned his head and was only grazed. For reasons that are unclear, thecharge of assault with a deadly weapon was dismissed.By March 1978 Heidnik was a father; the mother of the child was a mentallyretarded black woman named Anjeanette Davidson. She had a thirty-four-year-oldsister named Alberta, who was in a mental institution near Harrisburg. On 7 May1978 Heidnik and Anjeanette went to see Alberta and took her on an outing. Whenthey failed to return her, police searched the house where Heidnik was living,and found Alberta hiding in a basement. Medical examination revealed that shehad recently had sexual intercourse, and gonorrheal infection in her throatrevealed that she had recently been subjected to oral sex. Heidnik was arrestedand charged with unlawful imprisonment and deviate sexuality. He was sentencedto four years’ imprisonment, most of which was spent in a mental ward. At leastone of the guards concluded that he was faking when, after years of ‘mutism’, hemet an old friend and began chatting normally. Heidnik would later tell JosefinaRivera that if he was caught, he would be able to fake insanity.Heidnik’s house was always full of women; he seemed to be sexually insatiable.There were many regular girlfriends; one of them told how Heidnik would insiston having three-in-a-bed sex. He also had a taste for mentally retarded blackwomen – many drawn from his congregation.In 1983 Heidnik decided that he wanted an oriental wife having heard, no doubt,that oriental girls are trained to obey their husbands in all things. Amatrimonial agency found him a Filipino girl named Betty Disto. In September1983 she flew from Manila to Philadelphia; they were married within three days.A week later she came in from a shopping trip and found her husband in bed withthree black women. Heidnik assured her that all American males did it. From thenon he often brought home mentally retarded black women for sex. He often madeher watch, after which she was ordered to cook for him. He also forced her tosubmit to sodomy. She left him in January 1986. A court ordered him to pay her$135 a week.In November of that year, Heidnik decided it was time to inaugurate his plan fora harem, and kidnapped Josefina Rivera . . .When the story of Heidnik’s arrest broke on 26 March 1987 newspaper headlinesdeclared: MAN HELD IN TORTURE KILLINGS, MADMAN’S SEX ORGY WITH CHAINED WOMEN,and WOMEN CHAINED IN HORROR DUNGEON. No-one realised at the time that thedescription ‘madman’ was literally true, and that Heidnik was as psychotic asAlbert Fish. When the information on Heidnik’s background emerged, it wasinevitable that his defence would be one of insanity, and when Heidnik’s trialopened in May 1978, this is the course his attorney, Charles Peruto Jnr, chose.Even as he did so, Peruto must have realised that the jury would be unlikely toaccept it: that in a case involving rape and torture, a sentence of detention ina criminal lunatic asylum would be regarded as a disappointing anticlimax. Onepsychiatrist, Dr Clancy McKenzie, argued that the birth of Heidnik’s brotherTerry when he was seventeen months old had caused a trauma that meant that apart of his brain had failed to mature beyond seventeen months, and that it wasthis infantile part that had kidnapped and raped women. Judge Lynne Abraham wasopenly sceptical of this explantion. Nevertheless, McKenzie’s theory of whyHeidnik kidnapped six women was highly plausible: that after his wife left him,he was determined that no woman should ever leave him again. When the prosecutorCharles Gallagher asked whether it was possible to fake schizophrenia, McKenziereplied indignantly that it would be impossible to fake it with him. Hisimpatience is understandable; he was aware that no amount of psychiatricevidence would convince the jury that Heidnik did not deserve the deathsentence.He was right. On 1 July 1988 Gary Heidnik was found guilty on eighteen counts,including two of first-degree murder. The following day, he was sentenced todeath. When someone telephoned Heidnik’s father, asking if he wanted to knowwhat the verdict was, he replied: ‘I’m not interested.’Heidnik’s life story seems to be typical of the serial killer: the hostilefather, the broken home, the head injury, the lonely and introverted childhood,the abnormally powerful sex drive. We can also see that one of his basicproblems was self-esteem. His preference for black, semi-retarded women revealsan inferiority complex; he feels he lacks the qualifications for approachingmiddle-class white girls; if he had found himself in bed with such a girl, hemight well have become impotent. In order to be potent, he must feel that thepartner is thoroughly ‘below’ him, little more than a sex slave.From the psychiatric point of view, the revelation on the Pacific coast was oneof the most interesting events in Heidnik’s life. It can be seen as a cry fromthe unconscious mind, a demand that he should find some way to developself-esteem. Becoming a bishop in his own church was the answer; it offered himan established position in the community, and an abundance of sexual partners.His subsequent success as a stock-market speculator confirmed that new position.In a mentally stable person, all this success would have brought about apersonality transformation; but Heidnik’s psychoses were too deep-rooted forthat. To feel wholly secure, he needed to be a family man as well as a bishop.At first his Filipino wife seemed to offer the solution; but it was essentialthat, like the wife of some oriental potentate, she should accept the rest ofthe harem. When she refused to do so and left him, the whole structure ofself-esteem was suddenly threatened. The solution was something that the sanepart of him knew to be criminal: to kidnap women and keep them as sex slaves.But how could a bishop be a criminal? This is tantamount to asking the question:how can Dr Jekyll co-exist with Mr Hyde? Heidnik’s response was the same as thatof Albert Fish: collapse into a delusional state in which anything he did wasjustified by some divine command. From then on, he could kidnap, rape andtorture with total moral self-approval.Then was the jury mistaken to decide that he was sane? Not entirely, for Heidnikhad undoubtedly learned to use his mentally unstable state as a weapon ofsurvival. Like Albert Brust, he knew he was mentally ill, and was cunning enoughto use it to his advantage. We can observe the same mechanism in HeinrichPommerencke. The craving for sexual satisfaction had produced powerful sexualtensions, but ‘Dr Jekyll’ was too strong to allow Mr Hyde to commit rape. Thecatalyst was an American biblical epic, The Ten Commandments. When he saw thehalf-naked women dancing around the golden calf, Pommerencke suddenly decidedthat women are the source of all the world’s troubles, and that he would bejustified in committing a sex crime. Did he really believe anything soillogical? The answer to that question depends on what we mean by belief. TheTen Commandments provided the excuse he required to overcome his scruples aboutmurder and rape. Most ‘conversion’ is of a similar nature. A system of beliefoffers a release of tensions and a design for living. Some beliefs may beregarded as more or less realistic – such as the belief in political freedom.Others – Nazism is an obvious example – are little more than an excuse for therelease of negative emotion. Pommerencke accepted the ‘revelation’ that womenare evil as an excuse to release his sexual tensions; he had entered into astate of ‘voluntary delusion’ – but Dr Jekyll was not wholly deceived, and the‘mistake’ that led to Pommerencke’s arrest suggests that he was fighting back.Gary Heidnik went one step further: the craving for mental and social stabilityalso led to the belief that women are evil and deserve to be treated as slaves;but the ‘conversion’ was so complete that Dr Jekyll was not only overruled butconsigned to oblivion in some remote Siberia of Heidnik’s mind.The Heidnik case suggests the conclusion that in most murders that involveinhuman sadism – Fish is another obvious example – the criminal is technicallyinsane: that is, suffering from delusions that disguise what he is doing fromhimself. This conclusion is supported by a case that occurred in Italy duringthe period when Heidnik was kidnapping his ‘sex slaves’.Beginning in February 1985, middle-aged prostitutes in the Turin area wereabducted and tortured, then murdered; the bodies were dumped in ditches. Thekillers cut off fingers and toes and made numerous cuts and burns all over thevictin’s body. The third and fourth victims – who vanished from a villagefestival – had been suspended by the wrists and whipped to death. The fifthvictim had been tortured for two days before her death. The sixth and seventhwere mutilated in a manner reminiscent of Jack the Ripper. On 28 June 1957 ahandsome young man in a sports car picked up a thirty-six-year-old prostitute onthe highway from Turin to Piacenza. She was considerably younger than most ofthe victims (whose ages had ranged from mid-forties to mid-sixties), and it mayhave been this realisation that made the driver decide to dispose of her withoutfurther ado; he stopped the car and shot her through the head, then dumped thebody in a cemetery. A few miles further on he was halted by police making aroutine check on cars, and their suspicious were aroused by his nervousness;then one of them noticed blood on the passenger seat and a gun sticking out of abag on the back seat. Giancarlo Guidice, a thirty-four-year-old lorry-driverfrom Turin, immediately confessed to the murder of Maria Rosa, and led thepolice back to her body. A search of his apartment revealed an elaborate torturekit of handcuffs, knives, scissors and other instruments. Fingerprints of threeof the murdered women were also found in his apartment. Psychiatrists concludedthat Guidice was driven by an overwhelming rage against older women – a ragethat almost certainly had its origin in his relationship with his mother.Psychiatric examination also revealed that he was incurably insane, and in March1989 he was confined in an institution for criminal psychotics. Police andforensic scientists who had studied the corpses had already concluded that theywere dealing with a madman.Even clinical insanity is not the ultimate stratagem of the unconscious mindwhen faced with intolerable conflict. There is a still more bizarre extremeknown as multiple personality, in which Robert Louis Stevenson’s division intoJekyll and Hyde becomes a psychological reality. One of the most bizarre casesof this type on record is that of the rapist Billy Milligan.During a three-week period in October 1977, three girls were kidnapped from thecampus of Ohio State University in Columbus, driven out to remote spots in thecountryside, then raped. Each was also made to cash cheques and hand over themoney. The victims went through mugshots at police headquarters, and quicklyidentified their assailant as a twenty-two-year-old ex-convict named WilliamStanley Milligan; but even as the police were on their way to arrest him,Milligan was telephoning his local police station to give himself up. Whenarrested, he stared in front of him in a strange, trancelike manner, andappeared to grasp very little of what was happening; the police, understandably,thought he was merely being unco-operative.In prison, Milligan attempted suicide by banging his head against a wall. By nowit was obvious that he was not malingering, and a doctor diagnosed acuteschizophrenia. When a psychiatrist went to see him in his cell, he denied thathe was Billy, and explained that his name was David. Asked where Billy was, hepointed to his chest and said: ‘He’s sleeping. In here.’ David stated that hewas eight years old. The following day, Billy identified himself in a cockneyaccent as Christopher, aged 13. He mentioned that he had a three-year-old sisternamed Christine, also British. The next day it was sixteen-year-old Tommy, apainter and electronics expert. Then came Danny, a fourteen-year-old boy who hadonce been buried alive. After this it was Arthur, a cool, controlledtwenty-two-year-old Englishman who spoke fluent Arabic, and who seemed to be akind of ringmaster of this circus of personalities. He told the psychologistthat the robberies had been committed by a Serbo-Croat personality called Ragen,but added that Ragen had not committed the rapes. A psychiatrist who went to theprison convinced that he was about to confront a faker left several hours latershaken and totally convinced that he was dealing with a genuine case of ‘MPD’ –multiple personality disorder.Multiple personalities have been known to doctors since the early nineteenthcentury. One of the first, Mary Renolds of Pennsylvania, woke up one morning in1811 with a totally blank memory: she had to be taught everything, like a baby.Five weeks later, the original Mary came back. For the next decade or so, thetwo Marys shuttled in and out of the body until, in middle life, they eventuallyfused together. There have been many famous cases since then – two of the mostrecent being those of Christine Sizemore, documented in the book The Three Facesof Eve, and ‘Sybil’, a girl with fourteen personalities, described in the bookSybil by Flora Rheta Schreiber. Most ‘multiples’ have had highly traumaticchildhood experiences, and it is now widely believed that the most importantcommon factor is sexual assault by an adult – often a parent – in childhood.This, according to Billy Milligan, explained how he had originally began tosplit into sub-personalities: at the age of eight, he had been frequentlysodomised and beaten by his stepfather, Chalmer Milligan, who also used to beatBilly’s mother. In order not to hear his mother’s screams, Billy closed his eyesand became a deaf child called Shawn. Soon several other personalities –including the physically powerful Ragen – were also sharing the body. When heattempted suicide – by throwing himself off the school roof at the age offourteen – the ‘others’ took over, and put Billy to sleep. He remained asleepuntil his arrest eight years later.Unfortunately, some of the twenty-two personalities who were sharing the bodywere criminals; one of them, Kevin, committed a robbery that landed ‘Billy’ injail. It was also Kevin, in association with a nineteen-year-old lesbian calledAdalana – yet another of the Milligan menagerie – who abducted the girls.Adalana raped them, and Ragen robbed them. When Danny woke up in the body andrealised that something terrible had happened, it was he who rang the police togive ‘himself’ up. In fact, the police had by then identified the rapist, andwere already on their way to arrest him. After psychiatrists had diagnosed BillyMilligan as a multiple personality, he was sentenced to detention in a mentalhospital, and the psychiatric treatment to fuse his multiple personalitiesended.Many mysteries remain. If the various personalities of Billy Milligan were allfragments created by his unconscious mind, how is it that one of them couldspeak fluent Arabic and another Serbo-Croat? Whatever the solution, it seemsclear that Billy Milligan displayed a far more severe form of the self-divisionthan can be seen in so many psychotic killers, from Albert Fish to Gary Heidnik.The sadist is a retarded personality, trapped at an infantile stage ofdevelopment by a tendency to live in a world of fantasy; his sense of reality isas weak as that of a child, and this is why he is capable of treating otherhuman beings as if they were mere objects. We can see, for example, that therealisation of Cameron Hooker’s daydream of possessing a ‘sex slave’ had theeffect of transforming him into something more like a socially normal humanbeing. The sadistic murder represents a muddled quest for fulfilment: sexualfulfilment and fulfilment of the urge to self-esteem. In a few rare cases, suchas that of Hooker, it actually achieves its object. The most striking of theseoccurred in Boston in the 1960s.Between June 1962 and January 1964 the city of Boston, Massachusetts wasterrorised by a series of murders that achieved worldwide publicity. The unknownkiller, who strangled and sexually abused his victims, became known as theBoston Strangler. The first six victims were elderly women, whose ages rangedfrom fifty-five to eighty-five.On 4 June 1962 fifty-five-year-old Anna Slesers was found in her apartment inthe Back Bay area of Boston. She had been knocked unconscious with a bluntinstrument – later determined to be a lead weight – and then strangled. Thebody, clad only in an open housecoat, was lying on its back with the legs apart.No semen was found in the vagina, but she had evidently been sexually assaultedwith some hard object such as a soda bottle. The apartment had been ransacked.Two weeks later, on 30 June, sixty-eight-year-old Nina Nichols failed to callback a friend after a telephone conversation had been interrupted by a ring atthe doorbell. The friend asked the janitor to check her apartment. Nina Nicholswas lying on the bedroom floor, strangled with a stocking, her legs open in arape position. Her killer had also bitten her. Medical examination revealed thatshe had been sexually assaulted with a wine bottle after death. There was semenon her thighs, but not in the vagina.Two days later, on Monday 2 July, neighbours of a sixty-five-year-old retirednurse named Helen Blake, who lived in Lynn, north of Boston, became anxious atnot having seen her for two days, and sent for the police. Helen Blake was lyingface downwards on her bed, a stocking knotted around her throat. Again, therewas dried semen on her thighs but not in the vagina. Mrs Blake had apparentlybeen killed on the previous Saturday, the same day as Nina Nichols.On 21 August Mrs Ida Irga, seventy-five, was found dead in her apartment. Deathwas due to manual strangulation, after which a pillow case had been tied roundher neck. She had been sexually assaulted with some hard object, and bitten. Itwas estimated that she had been dead for two days.The last of the elderly victims was sixty-seven-year-old Jane Sullivan, anothernurse. She was found in a kneeling position in the bathtub, her face in sixinches of water. She was a powerful Irishwoman, and had evidently put up atremendous fight – her assailant must have been very strong to overpower her.Two stockings were knotted around her neck. She had been killed on the day afterIda Irga, but the body was not found for more than a week; consequently it wasimpossible to determine whether she had been raped, but she had been sexuallyassaulted with a broom handle.Boston was in a state of hysteria, but as weeks went by without furtherstranglings, it slowly subsided. A hot summer was succeeded by a very coldwinter. In the early evening of 5 December 1962 two girls rang the doorbell ofthe apartment they shared with a twenty-year-old black girl, Sophie Clark, andwere surprised when she failed to answer. They let themselves in, and foundSophie lying on the floor; she was naked and in the rape position. She had beenstrangled with nylon stockings knotted round her neck. Medical examinationestablished that she had been raped, and a semen stain on the carpet beside thebody indicated that her killer had later masturbated over her. This was thefirst case in which rape was unquestionably established, and it led to thespeculation that her killer was a second Boston Strangler, one who preferredyoung girls.Three weeks later, on the last day of 1962, a businessman stopped his caroutside the apartment of his secretary at 515 Park Drive and blew his horn. Whenshe failed to come down, he assumed that she had already left, but when he foundthat she was not at the office, he rang the superintendant of her apartmentbuilding to ask him to check on her apartment. Patricia Bissette, twenty-three,was lying in bed, covered with the bedclothes. She had been strangled withstockings, and medical examination established that she had been raped.On 18 February 1963 a German girl named Gertrude Gruen survived an attack by theStrangler. A powerfully built man with a beaky nose, about five feet eightinches tall, knocked on her door and told her he had been sent to do work in herapartment. She was suffering from a virus, and only allowed him in after someargument. The man removed his coat and told her that she was pretty enough to bea model. Then he told her she had dust on the back of her dressing gown; sheturned, and he hooked a powerful arm round her neck. She fought frantically, andsank her teeth into his hand until they bit to the bone. The man pushed heraway, and as she began to scream, he ran out of the apartment.The police were excited when the girl reported the attack – and then frustratedwhen they discovered that the shock had wiped all traces of the Strangler’s facefrom her memory.A month later, on 9 March 1963, the Strangler killed another elderly victim.Sixty-nine-year-old Mrs Mary Brown lived in Lawrence, an industrial towntwenty-five miles from Boston. The fact that her breasts had been exposed and afork stuck in one of them should have suggested that she had been murdered bythe ‘Phantom’ (as the press had now labelled the killei). However, because herskull had been beaten to a pulp with a piece of brass piping, she was notrecognised as a Strangler victim – it was assumed that she had disturbed aburglar. In fact, she had been manually throttled.The next victim was also nontypical. On 9 May 1963 a friend oftwenty-three-year-old graduate student Beverly Sams was puzzled when she failedto answer the telephone, and borrowed a key from the building supervisor.Beverly had been stabbed in the throat, and a stocking knotted around her neck.She was naked, and her legs spreadeagled and tied to the bed supports. Medicalexamination revealed that she had been raped.Four months later, on 8, September friends of a fifty-eight-year-old divorcee,Evelyn Corbin, wondered why she failed to keep a lunch appointment and letthemselves into her flat. Evelyn Corbin was lying almost naked on the bed, nylonstockings knotted around her throat and her panties rammed into her mouth. Therewas semen in her vagina and in her mouth.On 23 November 1963, the day President Kennedy was assassinated, the Stranglerkilled his next victim in Lawrence. She was Joanne Graff, a Sunday-schoolteacher. She had been strangled with stockings and raped.The final victim was strangled on 4 January 1964. She was nineteen-year-old MarySullivan, who was found by room-mates when they came back from work. She wassitting on the bed, her buttocks on the pillow, her back against the headboard.Her knees had been parted, and a broom handle inserted into her vagina. Semenwas running from the corner of her mouth. A card saying ‘Happy New Year’ hadbeen propped against her foot. The killer had placed her body in a positionwhere it would be seen as soon as anyone opened the door.The murders ceased; but a rapist who became known as The Green Man – because hewore green clothes – began operating over a wide area that includedMassachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. On one occasion heraped four women in a single day. He gained entrance to the apartment –sometimes forcing the lock with a strip of plastic – and often threatened thevictim with a knife. When she was stripped, he would caress her with his handsand mouth; then, if he judged she wanted him to, he ‘raped’ her. (He was laterto insist that the ‘Green Man’ had never raped an unwilling woman.) He was neverphysically violent, and had even been known to apologise before he left.On the morning of 27 October 1964 a young married woman was dozing in bed afterher husband had gone to work when a man entered the bedroom. He was dressed ingreen trousers, a green shirt, and wore green sunglasses, and he insisted thathe was a detective. After seizing her by the throat he threatened her with aknife. He tore off her nightclothes, stuffed a pair of panties into her mouth,and tied her wrists and ankles to the bedposts. Then he kissed and bit her fromhead to foot, finally ejaculating on her stomach. His sexual appetite wasobviously enormous; he continued to abuse her sexually for a great deal longerbefore he seemed satisfied. Then, after apologising, he left. The girl calledthe police immediately, and went on to descrbe her assailant in such detail thata police artist was able to make a sketch of his face. As one of the detectiveswas studying it, he commented: ‘This looks like the Measuring Man.’ The‘Measuring Man’ had been a harmless crank named Albert DeSalvo, who had beenarrested in 1960 for talking his way into girls’ apartments claiming torepresent a modelling agency. If the girl indicated that she might be interestedin modelling, he would take her measurements with a tape measure. After that hewould thank her politely and leave. The aspiring model would never hear from himagain, and it was this that made some of them so indignant that they reportedhim. The police were baffled, since there seemed to be no obvious motive –although some girls admitted that they had allowed him to raise their skirts tomeasure from the hip to the knee. On a few occasions, he had allowed himself anintimate caress; but if the girl protested, he immediately apologised. One girl,as he crouched with his hand on her panties, had said: ‘I’d better get theseclothes off or you won’t get the right measurements’, and stripped. On thisoccasion, as on a number of others, the ‘Measuring Man’ had ended up in bed withthe girl.On 17 March 1960 a police patrol that had been set up to trap the ‘MeasuringMan’ saw a man acting suspiciously in a backyard in Cambridge, Mass., andarrested him. Girls identified him as the ‘Measuring Man’, and he finallyadmitted it – claiming that he did it as a kind of lark, in order to makehimself feel superior to college-educated girls. In May 1961 DeSalvo wassentenced to serve two years in the Middlesex County House of Correction. Heserved eleven months before being released. He had told a probation officer thathe thought there was something wrong with him – that he seemed to be wildlyoversexed, so that he needed intercourse six or more times a day. No-onesuggested that he needed to see a psychiatrist.Albert DeSalvo had clearly graduated from caressing girls as he measured them torape. He was arrested on 5 November 1964 and identified by some of his victims.On 4 February 1965 he was committed to the Bridgewater State Hospital, a mentalinstitution in Massachusetts.Bridgewater had – and still has – many sexual psychopaths in residence, and manyspoke freely about their exploits, particularly in the group therapy sessions.Albert DeSalvo was not reticent about his own sexual prowess, which wasapparently considerable. He described how, in the summer of 1948, when he wasseventeen, he had worked as a dishwasher in a Cape Cod motel, and spent muchtime swimming and sunbathing on the beach. There were many college girls there,and they found the powerfully-built youth attractive. Word of DeSalvo’s amazingsexual prowess soon spread. ‘They would even come up to the motel sometimeslooking for me and some nights we would spend the whole night doing it down onthe beach, stopping for a while, then doing it again . . .’Possibly because he encountered a certain scepticism – he had a reputation as aboaster – DeSalvo began hinting that he had done far more serious things thanraping a few women. Only one of his ward-mates took him seriously: a murderercalled George Nassar. At first, Nassar also thought DeSalvo was merely boasting– particularly when he confided that he was the Boston Strangler. What finallyconvinced him was DeSalvo’s detailed knowledge of the crimes. ‘He knows moreabout them stranglings than the cops.’Nassar knew there was a large reward for the Boston Strangler, and he spoke tohis attorney, F.Lee Bailey, who had achieved fame when he obtained freedom forDr Sam Sheppard, accused of murdering his wife. Bailey was also sceptical –there are endless fake confessions to almost every widely publicised murder –but when he went to see DeSalvo on 4 March 1965, he soon realised that thissounded authentic. DeSalvo was not a man of high intelligence – although brightand articulate – and it seemed unlikely that he could have read and memorisednewspaper accounts of the murders. He even mentioned a murder that no-one knewabout – an old lady of eighty or so who had died of a heart attack as he grabbedher. In fact, DeSalvo’s account enabled the police to identify her aseighty-five-year-old Mary Mullens who had been found dead in her Bostonapartment two weeks after the murder of Anna Slesers, the first Stranglervictim. DeSalvo’s descriptions of other murder scenes made it clear that he knewdetails that had never been published. Most important of all, he knew exactlywhat the Strangler had done to various victims. This information had beendeliberately suppressed, giving rise to all kind of wild rumours of torture andperversion. DeSalvo knew, for example, precisely what position Mary Sullivan –the last victim – had been left in, and that she had a broom handle insertedinto her vagina; and he was able to describe in precise detail the rooms of mostof the victims.There were some odd complications. Several witnesses who had seen a man enteringapartment buildings where stranglings had taken place failed to identify DeSalvoas the man. And two women who had seen the Strangler – including Gertrude Gruen,the German girl who had fought him off – not only failed to identify DeSalvo,but identified George Nassar as the strangler. Yet DeSalvo’s incredibly detailedknowledge of the crimes finally convinced most of those involved with the casethat he alone was the Boston Strangler.In the long run, all this proved irrelevant. Albert DeSalvo stood trial for theGreen Man rapes, and in 1967 was sentenced to permanent detention in the WalpoleState Prison, where he could receive psychiatric treatment. On 26 November 1973DeSalvo was found dead in his cell, stabbed through the heart. No motive wasever established, and whoever was responsible was never caught.In January 1964, while the Boston Strangler was still at large, the assistantattorney general of Massachusetts, John S. Bottomly, decided to set up acommittee of psychiatrists to attempt to establish some kind of ‘psychologicalprofile’ of the killer. One of the psychiatrists who served on that committeewas Dr James A.Brussel, the man who had been so successful in describing NewYork’s ‘Mad Bomber’ (see here [../Text/chapter_003.xhtml#page_81]). When heattended his first meeting, Brussel discovered that there was a sharp divisionof opinion within the committee. One group believed that there were twostranglers, one of whom killed old women, and the other young girls; the othergroup thought there was only one strangler.It was at his second meeting of the committee – in April 1965 – that Brussel washit by a sudden ‘hunch’ as he listened to a psychiatrist pointing out that insome cases, semen was found in the vagina, while in others, it was found on thebreasts, thighs, or even on the carpet. When it came to his turn to speak,Brussel outlined the theory that had suddenly come to him ‘in a flash’.‘I think we’re dealing with one man. The apparent differences in M.O., Ibelieve, result from changes that have been going on in this man. Over thetwo-year period during which he has been committing these murders, he had gonethrough a series of upheavals . . .’The first five victims, said Brussel, were elderly women, and there was no semenin the vaginas. They had been manipulated in other ways – ‘a type of sexualmolestation that might be expected of a small boy, not a man’. A boy gets overhis sexual obsession with his mother, and transfers his interest to girls of hisown age. ‘The Strangler . . . achieved this transfer – achieved emotionalpuberty – in a matter of months.’ Now he wanted to achieve orgasm inside youngerwomen. And with the final victim, Mary Sullivan, the semen was in her mouth andover her breasts; a broom had been inserted in the vagina. The Strangler wasmaking a gesture of triumph and of defiance: ‘I throw my sex in your face.’This man, said Brussel, was a physically powerful individual, probably in hislate twenties or early thirties, the time the paranoid reaction reaches itspeak. He hazarded a guess that the Strangler’s nationality was Italian orSpanish, since garrotting is a method used by bandits in both countries.Brussel’s final ‘guesses’ were startlingly to the point. He believed that theStrangler had stopped killing because he had worked it out of his system. Hehad, in effect, grown up. And he would finally be caught because he would beunable to resist talking about his crimes and his new-found maturity.The rest of the committee was polite but sceptical. But one year later, Brusselwas proved correct when DeSalvo began admitting to George Nassar that he was theBoston Strangler.In 1966, Brussel went to Boston to interview DeSalvo. He had been half-expectinga misshapen monster, and was surprised to be greeted by a good-looking, politeyoung man with a magnificent head of dark hair. (Brussel had even foretold thatthe Strangler would have well-tended hair, since he was obsessed by theimpression he made on women.) Brussel found him charming, and soon realised howDeSalvo had talked his way into so many apartments; he seemed a thoroughly niceyoung man. Then what had turned him into a murderer? As usual, it proved to bethe family and childhood background. DeSalvo’s father was the worst kind ofbrute. He beat his wife and children mercilessly – on one occasion he broke hiswife’s fingers one by one. He beat one son with a hosepipe so badly – forknocking over a box of fruit – that the boy was not allowed on the beach allsummer because he was covered in black and yellow bruises. He often brought aprostitute home and had sex with her in front of the children. Their mother wasalso less than satisfactory. She was indifferent and self-preoccupied, and hadno time for the children. As a child Albert had been a ‘loner’, his only realfriend a dog that lived in a junkyard. He developed sadistic compulsions at anearly age. He and a playmate called Billy used to place a dog and cat in twocompartments of an orange crate and starve them for days, then pull out thepartition, and watch as the cat scratched out the dog’s eyes. But, like so manypsychopaths (Albert Fish and Gary Heidnik, for example) he could displayconsiderable charm and make himself liked.The real key to DeSalvo was sex. From an early age he was insatiable, ‘walkingaround with a rail on most of the time, ready to take on any broad or fag comealong, or to watch some broad and masturbate . . . thinking about sex a lot,more than anything, and needing it so much all the time. If only somebodycould’ve seen it then and told me it was not normal, even sick . . .’ DeSalvo ishere exaggerating; a large proportion of healthy young males go around in muchthe same state. DeSalvo’s environment offered a great deal of sexual stimulus.He participated in sex games with his brothers and sisters when he was five orsix years old. At the age of eight he performed oral sex on a girl at school,and was soon persuading girls to do the same for him. Albert DeSalvo was turnedinto a sexual psychopath by the same kind of ‘hothouse environment’ that hadnurtured Albert Fish. Combined with the lack of moral restraint that resultedfrom his family background, his tremendous sex urge soon led him to rape – hisown estimation was that he had raped or assaulted almost two thousand women.During the course of the Green Man attacks, he raped four women in a single day,and even then tried to pick up a fifth. This was something that Brussel hadfailed to recognise. The Strangler had not been ‘searching for his potency’ – hehad always been potent. During his teens, a woman neighbour had asked him if itwas true that he had a permanent erection, and when he modestly admitted it,invited him into her apartment. ‘She went down on her knees and blowed me and Icome almost right off and she said: “Oh, now you went and come and what am Igoing to have to get screwed with?”, and I said: “Don’t worry, I’ll have a hardon again in a few minutes”.’ When he left her, she was exhausted, but he wasstill unsatisfied. It was not potency DeSalvo was searching for, but emotionalstability.Yet Brussel was undoubtedly correct about the main thing: that DeSalvo’s murderswere part of an attempt to grow up. The murders of elderly women were acts ofrevenge against the mother who had rejected him; but the murder of the youngblack girl Sophie Clark signalled a change. When he knocked on her door DeSalvohad no idea that she would be so young – he was looking for elderly women, likehis mother. Her white dress and black stockings excited him. He talked his wayinto her apartment by claiming to be a workman sent to carry out repairs – themethod he invariably used – then, when she turned her back, hooked his arm roundher neck and squeezed until she was unconscious. After that he raped her, thenstrangled her. The experience taught him that he preferred young girls to olderwomen, and caused the change in his method.Yet from the beginning, DeSalvo suffered from the same problem as so many sexkillers: self-division. A month before he killed Anna Slesers – the first victim– DeSalvo talked his way into the apartment of an attractive Swedish girl,claiming that he had been sent to repair the ceiling. ‘She was laughing and shewas very nice. An attractive, kind woman.’ In the bathroom she turned her backon him, and DeSalvo hooked his powerful forearm round her neck. As he began tosqueeze, he saw her face in the bathroom mirror, ‘the look of awful fear andpain.’ ‘And I see myself, the look on my own face . . . and I can’t do it. Itake my arm away.’ The girl asked him what he was going to do, and he admittedthat he was going to rape her and possibly kill her. ‘I tell you now that I wasashamed – I began to cry.’ He fell on his knees in front of her and said: ‘OhGod, what was I doing? I am a good Catholic man with a wife and children. Idon’t know what to do . . . Please call the police.’ The girl told him to gohome. ‘She was a kind person and she was trying to be good to me. But how muchbetter it would have been if she had called the police right then and there.’The episode is an interesting confirmation of a theory advanced by Brussel tohis fellow committee members: that the Strangler only attacked women who turnedtheir backs on him, because it seemed a form of ‘rejection’.After killing Sophie Clark, he came very close to sparing his next victim,Patricia Bissette. ‘She was very nice to me, she treated me like a man – Ithought of doing it to her and I talked myself out of it.’ She offered himcoffee, and when he offered to go out and get some doughnuts, told him she hadfood there. ‘Then it was as good as over. I didn’t want it to happen but then Iknew that it would.’ After he had throttled her into unconsciousness and wasraping her, ‘I want to say that all the time I was doing this, I was thinkingabout how nice she had been to me and it was making me feel bad. She had treatedme right, and I was doing this thing to her . . .’At other times, Mr Hyde took over – as in his next murder, that of Mary Brown inLawrence. This murder was not, at the time, recognised as one of the Strangler’scrimes, because its ferocity seemed untypical. DeSalvo described how he hadknocked on the door and explained to the grey-haired lady who answered that hehad come to paint the kitchen. She let him in without question. In his pocket,DeSalvo had a piece of brass pipe that he had found in the hallway. ‘As shewalked to the kitchen, her back was to me. I hit her right on the back of thehead with the pipe . . . this was terrible, and I don’t like talking about it.She went down and I ripped her things open, showing her busts . . . she wasunconscious and bleeding . . . I don’t know why but then I hit her again on thehead with the pipe. I kept on hitting and hitting her with the pipe . . . thisis like out of this world . . . this is unbelievable . . . oh, it wasterrible . . . because her head felt like it was all gone . . . terrible . . .then I took this fork and stuck it into her right bust.’ As in so many othercases, DeSalvo was unable to say why he did it. (Similarly, he had been unableto explain why he rifled the apartments after committing the murders: he was notlooking for anything specific and apparently took nothing.) What he failed torecognise was that, like so many other serial killers, he had been taken over –literally possessed – by a sadistic compulsion, the sheer joy of destruction.Yet even as he did it, he continued to feel ‘This is terrible.’DeSalvo never suceeded in overcoming his feeling of guilt. He intimidated thetenth victim, twenty-three-year-old Beverly Sams, with a knife; she made himpromise not to rape her, because she was afraid of pregnancy. When he had herlying on the bed, DeSalvo decided to gag her. ‘Then I thought that I wouldn’twant a broad like that, with her stupid ideas to see me, so I tied a blindfoldover her eyes.’ When she recovered consciousness and discovered that he wasraping her, she called him an animal. This enraged him enough to make him stabher. When he could kill like this – giving rein to his resentment – heexperienced no guilt.The last victim, Mary Sullivan, tried to reason with him, to talk him out ofrape. Her words struck home. ‘I recall thinking at the time, yes, she is right,I don’t have to do these things any more now . . . I heard what this girl issaying and it stayed with me.’ At the time he was angry, and hit her severaltimes. As he tied her up and prepared to rape her, he realised ‘I would never beable to do it again’. After raping her, he strangled her manually, while shestruggled to get up. ‘This is what I don’t like to talk about. This is killingme even to talk about.’ After death, her face looked ‘surprised and evendisappointed with the way I had treated her’. Then DeSalvo propped her upagainst the head of the bed, straddled her chest, and masturbated so that thesperm would strike her face. ‘She is sitting there with the stuff on her noseand mouth and chin. I am not in control of myself. I know that something awfulhas been done, that the whole world of human beings are shocked and will be evenmore shocked.’ He went into the kitchen and fetched a broom, then inserted itinto her vagina, ‘not so far as to hurt her . . . you say it is funny that Iworry about hurting her when she is already dead, but that is the truth . . . Ido not want to hurt her’. And, after leaving the apartment; ‘as far as I wasconcerned it wasn’t me. I can’t explain it to you any other way.’ When Brussellater pressed him to explain why Mary Sullivan was his final victim, he admittedthat she had reminded him of his daughter. Dr Jekyll was back in control.That he would now remain in control was demonstrated in a sensational manner. InFebruary 1967, a month after being sentenced to life imprisonment, DeSalvo andtwo more inmates escaped from the Bridgewater mental institution. The city ofBoston was plunged into panic. Interviewed by the press, Brussel wasunconcerned. He pointed out that DeSalvo had left a note behind, apologising fortaking unauthorised leave, and explaining that he was only doing so to drawattention to the fact that he was receiving no psychiatric treatment. Hepromised that he would harm nobody. Brussel stated that he was sure DeSalvowould honour his promise. In fact, DeSalvo gave himself up after only thirty-sixhours. His protest failed in its purpose – he was transferred to the virtuallyescape-proof Walpole Prison, but still failed to receive any psychiatrictreatment.At least Brussel had proved his point. The Boston Strangler had raped andmurdered his way to a kind of maturity."},{"pageContent":"SixFolie à DeuxSOON AFTER MIDNIGHT on Sunday 2 November 1980 a young couple emerged from arestaurant in Sacramento, California, and walked towards their car. They hadspent the evening at a Founder’s Day dance in the restaurant, and were wearingformal evening dress. On their way through the car park, they were accosted by apretty blonde girl whose swollen stomach suggested an advanced stage ofpregnancy. As they stopped politely to find out what she wanted, the girlpointed an automatic pistol at them, and ordered them to climb into the backseat of an Oldsmobile. The front passenger seat was occupied by a big man with asullen expression.At that moment, a student who happened to know the young couple – and who was inthe mood for a practical joke – decided to climb into the driver’s seat of theOldsmobile, as if about to drive away. His position prevented him from seeingthe gun in the hand of the sullen-faced man, but a glance at the face of hisfriends told him something was wrong. A moment later, he was startled when thepretty blonde screamed: ‘What the fuck are you doing in my car?’ and slapped hisface. As he watched her drive away with a squeal of tyres, Andy Beal had thepresence of mind to concentrate on the numberplate of the speeding car, and towrite it down on a piece of paper. Then he hurried to the nearest telephone andrang the police. When the registration number was fed into the motor vehiclecomputer it revealed that the car was registered to twenty-four-year-oldCharlene Williams, with an address in Sacramento.The abducted couple were twenty-two-year-old Craig Miller and Beth Sowers,twenty-one, and when, the next morning, the police went to call on CharleneWilliams at the home of her parents, Chuck and Mercedes, they were stillmissing. The attractive girl who opened the door to the policemen acknowledgedthat she was the owner of the Oldsmobile, but denied any knowledge of thekidnapping. She explained that she had been drunk the night before, and that hermemory was hazy. But she insisted that she had spent the evening alone. It wasafter they had left Charlene Williams that the officers learned that CraigMiller had been found in adjoining Eldorado County; he was lying face down, withthree bullets in the back of his head. By the time the police returned toCharlene’s residence, the Oldsmobile had gone, and so had Charlene. As thepolice looked into her background, they soon had reason to believe that she hadbeen accompanied by her thirty-four-year-old ‘husband’ Gerald Armand Gallego,who had a lengthy record which included three years in jail for armed robbery.The couple had left in a hurry, and so were unprepared for a long flight. Twoweeks later, Charlene contacted her parents and asked them to wire five hundreddollars. When she went to collect it at a Western Union office in Omaha,Nebraska, police were waiting for her. Her ‘husband’ was also taken intocustody. Five days later, on 22 November 1980, the body of Beth Sowers was foundin a field in Placer County. Her evening gown was badly torn, and she had beenshot three times in the back of the head. Medical examination revealed that shehad been raped.By the time Gerald Gallego was in custody, the Sacramento police had learned agreat deal about him, and it suggested that he was a multiple sex killer.Heredity may have played some part in his makeup – his father had been executedfor three murders in 1955, at the age of twenty-eight. Gerald was unaware ofthis when he had his first encounters with the law, at the age of ten. When hewas thirteen, he was sentenced to a period in a youth penal facility for havingsexual relations with a seven-year-old girl. He married at the age of eighteen,and his first wife bore him a daughter, Sally Jo. By the time he was thirty-twohe had been married seven times. He had also been committing incest with hisdaughter since she was eight. Then, when she was fourteen, he sodomised her andraped her girlfriend. The teenagers went to the Butte County police, and Gallegowas forced to flee.By this time – 1978 – Gallego had already known Charlene for a year. A quiet,shy girl, she was the only daughter of a wealthy Sacramento businessman, and hadled a pampered existence. At college she had become acquainted with drugs andsex and, by the time she was twenty-one, she had been married and divorcedtwice. She had met Gerald Gallego on a blind date, and was fascinated by his airof macho brutality, and his need for violence during sex. They lived togetherfor a while, then married in 1978. (In fact they were not legally married, sinceGallego had omitted to get a divorce from a previous wife.) Charlene was notonly aware of his criminal record, but of his intense fantasy life. Gallegoconfided that his greatest desire was for the ‘perfect sex slave’ – preferably ateenage virgin – whom he could hold captive and order to fulfil his demands,which included oral sex and sodomy. As Charlene later confessed, she had agreedto help him in his quest.On 11 September 1978 they had driven to a shopping mall in Sacramento, andCharlene had accosted two young girls, Rhonda Scheffler, seventeen, and hersixteen-year-old friend Kippi Vaught. She lured them back to the Oldsmobile withthe suggestion that they might like to smoke some marijuana. Once there, theywere forced into the back of the van – which had been fitted with a mattress –and Gallego was able to put into operation his fantasy of rape, while Charlenesat in the front of the van. The girls were then driven to a site fifteen mileseast of Sacramento, where both were ‘executed’ with three bullets in the head,and their bodies dumped.Gerald and Charlene Gallego soon became highly efficient killers. The nextvictims, nine months later, were a fourteen-and a fifteen-year-old girl, KayeColley and Brenda Judd, picked up at the annual county fair in Reno on 24 June1979; their bodies have never been found, although according to Charlene Gallegothey are in a shallow grave near Lovelock, Nevada.Ten months later, on 24 April 1980, two seventeen-year-olds, Stacy Ann Redicanand Karen Chipman-Twiggs, were abducted from a Sacramento shopping mall; theirdecomposed bodies were found near Lovelock, Nevada, in July 1980. They had beenkilled by hammer blows to the skull.Linda Teresa Aguilar was five months pregnant when she disappeared somewherebetween Port Orford, Oregon, and nearby Gold Beach on 6 June 1980, less thanthree months after the two previous victims had vanished. Her body was foundthree weeks later in a grave nine miles south of Gold Beach; she was bound witha nylon rope, and beaten with a blunt instrument; sand in her windpipe revealedthat she had been buried alive.Five weeks later, on 17 July 1980, a thirty-four-year-old Sacramento waitress,Virginia Mochel, vanished after she walked out of the tavern where she worked.Police learned that she had been talking to a married couple in the tavern: aman who was drunk and boisterous, and a pretty but subdued girl. Her naked bodywas discovered in October near Sacramento, the hands tied behind her withfishing line.It was in the following month that Gerald and Charlene Gallego waited in the carpark outside the Carousel restaurant in Sacramento, and Gallego saw a prettygirl in evening dress whom he decided he wanted to possess. Beth Sowers was withher fiance, Craig Miller, but that made no difference. Charlene forced them intothe van at gunpoint, Miller was despatched a few miles away, then Beth Sowerswas taken back to Gallego’s apartment and dragged into the bedroom. In the nextroom, Charlene Gallego listened to her cries and pleas as she was made to caterto Gallego’s perverted sexual demands. Then the crying girl was dragged out ofthe bedroom and thrown back into the van, to be taken to her place of execution.After that, Charlene dropped Gallego off at his flat, and went back to the homeof her parents, where she lived. The next morning the police arrived – theprompt action of the student who had taken her registration number had finallyput an end to the killing spree.Gallego proved to be a difficult prisoner; he had always had a reputation foraggression, and during his previous jail term had told a prison counsellor: ‘Theonly thing that interests me is killing God.’ Now, at the arraignment, he leaptto his feet and screamed at reporters: ‘Get the hell out of here! We’re notfunny people. We’re not animals.’ He fought violently, overturning tables andchairs, before he was subdued.Charlene Gallego was at first unco-operative, but was eventually persuaded toenter into plea-bargaining in exchange for testifying against her ‘husband’. Herstory made it clear that she had also been Gallego’s ‘sex slave’; she explainedthat she needed the emotional security he provided. This is why she felt she hadto comply with his demand for help in kidnapping more ‘sex slaves’. Her husband,she said, had pursued his aim of the ‘perfect love slave’ obsessively, evenrating his victims on their performances.On 21 June 1983 Gallego was sentenced to die by lethal injection. In accordancewith her plea bargain, Charlene Gallego received sixteen years in jail.Before the 1960s, cases of ‘duo’ sex murder in which one of the participants wasa woman were unknown. The reason is obvious; more than any other criminal, thesex criminal tends to work alone and to take no-one else into his confidence. A1980 FBI report on lust killers states: ‘The disorganised asocial lust murdererexhibits primary characteristics of social aversion. This individual prefers hisown company to that of others and would be typified as a loner.’ This applies tomost sex killers from Jack the Ripper to Heinrich Pommerencke. Such men may evenbe married – like the Düsseldorf murderer Peter Kürten or the Boston Strangler –but their wives seldom suspect that their husbands are sex killers. The veryidea of a wife helping her husband to rape another woman seems absurd. So why isit that such cases began to appear in the 1960s, and that their number hascontinued to increase? It can hardly be unrelated to the fact that the 1960salso saw the emergence of the ‘self-esteem’ killer. In fact, as the Gallego casemakes clear, ‘duo’ sex crimes are crimes of self-esteem. As agent RobertHazelwood observed: ‘Sexual assault services non-sexual needs – power needs.’This is not invariably true – or at least, it used not to be true. RobertPoulin’s craving for a woman was simply a desire to lose his virginity, to ‘fucksome girl’; the same is true of Heinrich Pommerencke. They were like starvingmen who steal food. The archetypal sex criminal was described by the Austriannovelist Robert Musil in The Man Without Qualities (1930-43). Moosbrugger isarresting for stabbing a prostitute to death. Musil writes:‘As a boy, Moosbrugger had been a poverty-stricken wretch, a shepherd-lad in ahamlet so small that it did not even have a village street; and he was so poorthat he never spoke to a girl. Girls were something that he could only lookat . . . Now one must imagine just what that means. Something that one cravesfor, just as naturally as one craves for bread or water, is only there to belooked at. After a time one’s desire for it becomes unnatural. It climbs over astile, becoming visible right up to the knees . . .’This describes the typical sex criminal of the first half of the twentiethcentury; he craves sex as he craves bread and water. (It shows keen insight onMusil’s part to make Moosbrugger a travelling journeyman; it has already beenobserved in an earlier chapter that a large number of sex killers have beentramps and vagrants.) As the last remnants of Victorianism gradually melt away,‘it’ ceases to be visible only up to the knees; it wanders around on beaches inbikinis; underwear advertisements show it in a state of undress that hints atbedrooms; magazines like Playboy show it naked in seductive poses. This is whythe desire of a Moosbrugger – or Pommerencke or Poulin – finally becomes‘unnatural’.The new type of sex killer who began to appear in the 1960s was not driven bymere desire, but by self-assertion. In 1973, the police of Veracruz, Mexico,finally caught a sex murderer who had been preying on courting couples since1968. He was thirty-one year old José Solano Marcelino, and he had made a habitof shooting the man, then raping the girl. ‘When I had the luck to find only onecar, I’d sneak up on the pair inside. I was always armed with a gun, and my facewas masked by one of my wife’s stockings . . . When I pointed the gun at them Icould see, and enjoyed, the fear of death in their eyes. I liked it so much tosee the male squirm, and the woman frightened and crying, that I’d make mythreats last for a long time. When I could see that the panic was driving thecouple to the brink of madness, I’d shoot the man. Then I’d take the woman. Ifshe tried to give me trouble by fighting or screaming, I’d bang her over thehead with the gun and tie her up. I never wanted to have sex with an unconsciouswoman, and so when they fainted, I waited before I had a session with them.’Asked why he killed the men he explained: ‘I guess I sacrificed them because Igot a kick out of it, like I did out of tormenting them before I put them out oftheir misery. And then later it gave an added tang to sexing their women.’Marcelino had been arrested on suspicion of being the lover’s lane rapist inMarch 1969, but an emotional appeal from his lawyer, who described him as aloving husband who adored his children, had led to his release. While the policecontinued to keep him under surveillance, he ceased the attacks. In 1970, hebegan again, until he had killed or seriously wounded more than a dozen men. Thewomen were raped repeatedly, then tortured. ‘I’d prick them here and there withmy knife, and squeeze and pinch to make them quiver with fear. It made me feelgood to see the women suffer, and the fear and horror in their eyes fedsomething in me that was sometimes even more pleasurable than having sex withthem.’Finally, he crept up on a couple who were picnicking, and hit the man – GregorioSanchez Luna – with a stone, then shot him dead. After that he made the girl,Maria Josefina Martinez, strip and drag the body into the bushes. Then, fromfive in the afternoon until three the following morning, he raped her and played‘torture games’. Finally, sated, he drove off. After he had left, she made herway to the highway and contacted the police. Since Marcelino had failed to wearhis stocking mask – for the first time – she was able to give the police anaccurate description, which they instantly recognised as the man they had heldfour years earlier. He was arrested in a dawn raid, and immediately identifiedby his victim. Sentenced to forty years in jail, the rapist remarked: ‘Well, ifthat’s the way it is, that’s the way it is. But I did have one hell of a timefor five years.’Gerald Gallego’s attitude towards women was also sadistic and manipulative. Theywere there for his pleasure and his use. Most women quickly came to recognisethis lack of give and take, and declined to co-operate – hence Gallego’s sevenmarriages in fourteen years. But Charlene Gallego was masochistic and eager tobe manipulated. Her only desire was to serve her master; it was a kind ofreligious conversion. If Gallego’s condition for continuing the relationship wasthat she should help other women to their deaths. It only proved that herhusband was thrillingly unlike other men. Gallego’s pleasure lay in dominating,hers in being dominated.The importance of ‘dominance’ – the ‘pecking order’ – in animal behaviour hasbeen recognised only in fairly recent times. It was first noticed in flocks ofdomestic fowl – in which dominant individuals tend to peck subordinate ones.Only then was it slowly recognised that all animals, including human beings,have a ‘pecking order’, a kind of chain in which everyone is more dominant orsubordinate than someone else. In groups such as lions, gorillas or rats,dominance is usually established by aggressive encounters, but once one of theanimals has won the fight, all aggression usually evaporates, and the losershows submissive behaviour from then on. The other challengers seem to acquire asense of social responsibility, and he (or she) passes beyond the range ofquarrels. The same phenomenon can often be seen in politicians who have beenpromoted to prime minister or president; a very mediocre party hack oftendevelops genuine leadership qualities. This helps to explain that fundamentalhuman craving for power, and why those who have acquired power cling to it sotightly. Supreme power places one above the ‘rat-race’.One of the most exciting observations about ‘dominance’ was made during theKorean war. Attempting to understand why there had been so few escapes ofAmerican prisoners, observers discovered that the Chinese had made use of aninteresting technique. They had watched the prisoners carefully to establishwhich of them were ‘dominant’; then they had taken these dominant prisoners, andplaced them under heavy guard. As soon as the ‘leaders’ had been removed, theother prisoners became more or less inert, and could be left almost withoutguards.The most interesting observation was that the number of ‘dominant’ prisoners wasalways the same: one in twenty, or five per cent. In fact, the explorer Stanleyhad known about this ‘dominant five per cent’ at the turn of the century.Bernard Shaw once asked him how many people in his party could take over theleadership if Stanley himself was ill; Stanley replied: ‘One in twenty.’ Shawasked if that was exact or approximate; Stanley replied: ‘Exact.’Observations of zoologists like Lorenz and Tinbergen indicated that this appliesto all animal species: five per cent are ‘dominant’. A psychologist named JohnCalhoun made an equally interesting observation: that when rats are overcrowded,the dominant five per cent becomes a criminal five per cent. Overcrowded ratsexpress their dominance in behaviour in completely uncharacteristic of rats innatural conditions: for example, in rape and cannibalism. Some animals – likeSika deer – simply die of stress when overcrowded. Human beings seem to have afar higher resistance to stress than any other animal; they tend to react toovercrowding – like the rats – by developing criminal behaviour. It issignificant that no serial killer has so far emerged from a socially privilegedbackground; the majority were brought up in overcrowded slums. The zoologistDesmond Morris remarked that cities are ‘human zoos’, and added: ‘Under normalconditions, in their natural habitats, wild animals do not mutilate themselves,masturbate, attack their offspring, develop stomach ulcers, become fetishists,suffer from obesity, form homosexual pair-bonds, or commit murder. Among citydwellers . . . all these things occur.’ The conclusion to be drawn may be thatthe ‘crime explosion’ will continue until such time as the population explosionhas been brought under control.Overcrowded slums have always existed, and, of course, crime has always existedin overcrowded slums. Why should they produce sadistic sex killers in the secondhalf of the twentieth century? The answer to this question has already emergedin earlier chapters. In societies with a high level of poverty, theft is thecommonest form of crime. In more ‘successful’ societies, sex crime makes itsappearance, as overcrowding in slums produces the ‘criminal rat’ syndrome, withthe dominant five per cent expressing their dominance through rape. In ‘affluentsocieties’, where a higher level of education means that all levels of societybegin to glimpse the possibility of wealth and achievement, the craving for‘upward mobility’ becomes as urgent as the craving for sexual fulfilment, and‘self-esteem’ crime makes its appearance. (It may or may not be significant thatself-esteem murder made its appearance at a time when the pop star had become awell-established phenomenon, so that every underprivileged teenager could beginto glimpse the possibility of wealth and fame.) In the second half of theeighteenth century, thinkers like Rousseau and Tom Paine stated the fundamentalprinciple that all men have a right to freedom; in the second half of thetwentieth century, there is a powerful unstated assumption that all men have aright to fame and celebrity.Abraham Maslow – who was the first to describe the ‘hierarchy of needs’ – alsomade an important observation about ‘dominance’. He had become curious about thesubject after observing the behaviour of monkeys in the Bronx zoo. They seemedto engage in almost constant sex – something that has been observed among manyanimals in captivity; but what puzzled Maslow was that the sex often seemed‘abnormal’ – males would mount other males, and sometimes females would evenmount males. It slowly dawned on him that this was because sex was a form of‘dominance behaviour’; what was happening was that the more dominant animalswere asserting themselves by mounting the less dominant animals. (Robert Ardreyhas pointed out that under natural conditions ‘sex is a sideshow in the world ofanimals’; it only assumes exaggerated importance in captivity – anotherobservation that may help to explain the rise in sex crime.)Maslow also observed that if a new monkey is added to a group of monkeys, thenewcomer would often get beaten up, the attack often being led by a previouslynon-dominant monkey. He noted that the previously non-dominant monkey wouldoften behave with extreme ferocity, as if making up for its previously inferiorstatus. Here again we glimpse a parallel with the sadistic behaviour of many‘self-esteem’ criminals.Perhaps his most interesting observations concerned dominance in women. In 1936,Maslow began a series of Kinsey-type interviews with college women – hepreferred women to men as interviewees because they were capable of greaterfrankness; male answers tended to be distorted by self-esteem. His findings,stated in a paper of 1939 (and another three years later) was that femalesexuality is related to dominance. The higher-dominance females went in for morepromiscuity, lesbian relations, masturbation and sexual experimentation(fellatio, sodomy, etc.).What surprised him was that he discovered that his subjects tended to fall intothree groups: high dominance, medium dominance and low dominance. Amedium-dominance woman might have a high rating for sex drive, but her sexualexperience was usually limited; she tended to be a ‘one-man woman’. Alow-dominance woman (and these were difficult to get into the study group) wasinclined to feel that sex was strictly for child-bearing, and one low-dominancewoman who was sterile refused her husband sex even though she had a high sexdrive. (It is important to note that all three groups could have a high sexdrive, but that the amount of sex they indulged in depended on how dominant theywere.) Medium-dominance women had a romantic attitude to sex; they liked to bewooed with lights and flowers and soft music, and they liked the kind of malewho would be a ‘good provider’ – someone who was stable rather than exciting.Low-dominance women seemed to feel that sex was rather disgusting. Most of themthought that the male sexual organ was ugly, while high-dominance women thoughtit beautiful.The really significant observation that emerged from the study was that thewomen tended to prefer males who were slightly more dominant than themselves,but within their own dominance group. Low-dominance females preferred the kindof man who would admire them from a distance for years without pressing hissuit. They found medium- and high-dominance males rather frightening.Medium-dominance women found high-dominance males frightening. High-dominancewomen like the kind of man who would sweep them off their feet, and inlovemaking hurl them on a bed and take them with a certain amount of force. Onehighly dominant woman spent years looking for a male who was even more dominantthan herself, and failed to find him. When finally she discovered a man ofslightly superior dominance, she married him and remained faithful; but sheenjoyed picking fights that would make him violent and end in virtual rape – anexperience she found immensely exciting. One high-dominance woman who could havean orgasm virtually by looking at a man admitted to not having orgasms with twolovers because they were too weak. ‘I just couldn’t give in to them.’When writing his biography of Abraham Maslow in the early 1970s, Colin Wilsonwas struck by the fact that this dominance relation seems to explain many crimepartnerships – for example, the Leopold and Loeb murder case (mentioned inChapter One), in which two Chicago students from wealthy families committedvarious crimes – ending in murder – for ‘kicks’. Most commentators on the caseremain content with the dubious explanation that they wanted to prove that theywere ‘supermen’; but the master-slave relationship between Richard Loeb andNathan Leopold makes us aware of what really happened. Loeb’s ego – hisself-esteem – was nourished by his ‘slave’; but it was not enough to expressthis self-esteem merely by dominating Leopold (who, in any case, wanted to be‘used). Like any juvenile delinquent, Loeb had to express it by ‘defyingsociety’, committing petty crimes for pleasure rather than gain. It was thiscraving to express his dominance through ‘defiance’ that led to the scheme tokidnap and murder a child. Without his ‘slave’, Loeb would almost certainlynever have become a killer.The most significant observation about the case is that Leopold and Loebbelonged to two different dominance groups: Loeb was ‘high-dominance’, Leopoldmedium. This, according to Maslow, seldom happens in ordinary humanpair-bondings. To begin with, the high-dominance person is seldom sexuallyinterested in people outside his own dominance group. He may cheerfully sleepwith medium- or low-dominance women, but he is incapable of taking any personalinterest in them. If, in fact, he consents to relations with a person outsidehis dominance group – out of loneliness and frustration – the resultant boost tohis ego can amount to a kind of intoxication. In a well-adjusted person, thiswould usually lead to an increase in self-confidence. In a person whosedominance has been suppressed – as in Maslow’s ‘previously inferior monkeys’ –the result may be criminal behaviour, which could be interpreted as a kind ofchest-beating to demonstrate triumph.In some cases, the relationship between a high-dominance and a medium-dominanceperson may amount to a kind of hypnosis. In November 1899, a New York lawyernamed Albert T. Patrick knocked on the door of the Madison Avenue apartment ofWilliam Rice, a wealthy retired businessman in his eighties. The man who openedthe door was Rice’s valet, Charles Jones, and Patrick lost no time in trying topersuade Jones to betray his employer, and furnish some evidence that could beused in a lawsuit against Rice. Jones, who was the old man’s only friend,refused with horror, but there was something about the beady eyes and dominantgaze of Albert T. Patrick that fascinated him, and when Patrick returned a fewdays later, he allowed himself to be persuaded, and agreed to forge a letter inwhich his employer apparently agreed to abandon the lawsuit. When Patricklearned from Jones that Rice had left his fortune of three million dollars to acollege in Texas, he persuaded Jones to co-operate in a scheme to forge a newwill, leaving the fortune to Patrick. The next step was to poison Rice withindigestion pills laced with mercury. When these failed to bring about thedesired result, Jones was ordered to kill the old man with chloroform. By now hewas so completely under Patrick’s domination that he complied. As soon as theold man was dead, Patrick hurried to the bank with a forged cheque for $25,000,but Jones had accidentally made out the cheque to ‘Abert’ T. Patrick, and whenthe teller noticed this, the scheme began to go wrong. The bank manager demandedto speak to Mr Rice on the telephone and Jones had to admit that the old man wasdead. Soon after this, Jones and Patrick found themselves in adjoining cells.Patrick now handed Jones a sharp knife and said: ‘The jig’s up. It’s no use. Yougo first and I’ll follow.’ Jones was so completely under Patrick’s spell that hecut his throat without pausing to reflect that it would be impossible forPatrick to get the knife back . . . In fact, Jones recovered, and turned state’sevidence. Patrick was sentenced to death, but was finally pardoned and released.Almost half a century later, in 1947, Raymond Fernandez, a petty crook with atoupee and gold teeth who specialised in seducing and swindling lonelymiddle-aged women, met an overweight nurse named Martha Beck through alonely-hearts club. Fernandez had become a crook after a serious head injurythat caused a total personality change. (We have already noted how many serialkillers have suffered head injuries.) His first sight of Martha was a shock –she weighed fourteen stone – but she seems to have possessed a certain wistfulcharm. Once in bed, they discovered that they were soul-mates, and their sexlife became a non-stop orgy. When Martha learned how Fernandez made a living,she proposed to join him – posing as his sister – adding only one refinement:that they should murder the women after he had seduced and robbed them. (Infact, Fernandez may have poisoned a widow named Jane Thompson in the year beforehe met Martha, but this has never been established – her death was certified asbeing due to acute gastro-enteritis.) In the course of a year they murdered atleast three women, the last being a forty-one-year-old mother and hertwenty-month-old daughter. Suspicious neighbours called the police, who soondiscovered two freshly cemented graves in the cellar. Tried in New York, theywere both electrocuted on 7 March 1951, Martha having some difficulty squeezinginto the electric chair. Wenzell Brown’s book on the case, The Lonely HeartsMurders, makes it clear that Martha was the dominant one of the pair, whileFernandez was weak, vain and easygoing. Both had had the unhappy childhood thatseems so typical of mass murderers. Martha’s obesity made her feel a ‘freak’,and because she was pathetically eager to please, she allowed men to fondle herintimately while still a child. Fernandez was a sickly and puny little boy whosehighly dominant father despised him; he spent his childhood wrapped indaydreams. When he and three other teenagers were caught stealing chickens, thefathers of the other boys agreed to act as guarantors and they were released;the father of Raymond Fernandez refused to co-operate and he went to prison.Even after the head injury that changed his personality, he never displayed anysadism towards the women he swindled. It seems to have been the partnership withMartha that turned him into ‘America’s most hated killer’.Perhaps the clearest example of the influence of the dominance syndrome oncriminality is England’s Moors Murder case.Between July 1963 and October 1965, Ian Brady and his mistress Myra Hindleycollaborated on five child murders. They were finally arrested because theytried to involve Myra’s brother-in-law, David Smith, in one of the murders, andhe went to the police.Ian Brady, who was twenty-seven at the time of his arrest, was a typical socialmisfit. The illegitimate son of a Glasgow waitress, he was brought up in a slumarea of Clydeside. Until the age of eleven he seems to have been a good student;then he was sent to a ‘posh’ school, together with a number of other re-housedslum boys, and began to develop a resentment towards the better-off pupils. Fromthen on he took to petty crime; his first appearance in court was at the age ofthirteen, on a charge of housebreaking. He had served four years on probationfor more burglaries when he moved to Manchester to live with his mother and anew stepfather in 1954. As a result of another theft he was sentenced to a yearin Borstal. Back in Manchester, he went back on the dole. It was a dull life ina small house, and he seems to have been glad to get a job as a stock clerk atMillwards, a chemical firm, when he was twenty-one.It was at this point that he became fascinated by the Nazis and began collectingbooks about them. They fed his fantasies of power. So did his discovery of theideas of the Marquis de Sade, with his philosophy of total selfishness and hisdaydreams of torture. It becomes clear in retrospect that Brady always had astreak of sadism. A childhood friend later described how he had dropped a catinto a deep hole in a graveyard and sealed it up with a stone. When the friendmoved the stone to check on his story, the cat escaped.For Brady, the Nazis represented salvation from mediocrity and boredom, while deSade justified his feeling that most people are contemptible. Brady particularlyliked the idea that society is corrupt, and that God is a lie invented bypriests to keep the poor in a state of subjugation. Stifled by ennui, seethingwith resentment, Brady was like a bomb that is ready to explode by the time hewas twenty-three.It was at this time that a new typist came to work in the office.Eighteen-year-old Myra Hindley was a normal girl from a normal familybackground, a Catholic convert who loved animals and children, and favouredblonde hair-styles and bright lipstick. She had been engaged, but broken it offbecause she found the boy immature. Brady had the sullen look of a delinquentElvis Presley, and within weeks, Myra was in love. Brady ignored her, probablyregarding her as a typical working-class moron. Her diary records: ‘I hope heloves me and will marry me some day.’ When he burst into profanity after losinga bet she was deeply shocked. It was almost a year later, at the firm’sChristmas party in 1961, that he offered to walk her home, and asked her outthat evening. When he took her home, she declined to allow him into the house –she lived with her grandmother – but a week later, after another evening out,she surrendered her virginity on her gran’s settee. After that, he spent everySaturday night with her.Myra found her lover marvellously exciting and sophisticated. He wore blackshirts, read ‘intellectual’ books, and was learning German. He introduced her toGerman wine, and she travelled as a pillion passenger on his motorbike. Hetalked to her about the Nazis, and liked to call her Myra Hess (a combination ofa famous pianist and Hitler’s deputy). He also introduced her to the ideas ofthe Marquis de Sade, and set out converting her to atheism, pointing out thediscrepancies in the gospels – it did not take long to demolish her faith. Healso talked to her a great deal about his favourite novel, Compulsion by MeyerLevin, a fictionalised account of the Leopold and Loeb murder case.It was in July 1963 – according to her later confession – that he first began totalk to her about committing ‘the perfect murder’, and suggesting that sheshould help him. In her ‘confession’ (to Chief Superintendent Peter Topping) shealleges that Brady blackmailed her by threatening to harm her grandmother, andby showing her some pornographic photographs of her that he had taken on anoccasion when he had slipped a drug into her wine. The photographs certainlyexist – thirty of them – some showing them engaged in sexual intercourse andwearing hoods. (These were taken with a time-lapse camera.) Emlyn Williams, whosaw them, states that some show keen pleasure on their faces, which would seemto dispose of Myra’s claim that they were taken when she was unconscious.Whether or not she was telling the truth about blackmail, it seems clear thatBrady could have persuaded her to do anything anyway.In her confession to Chief Inspector Peter Topping (published in 1989 in hisbook Topping), she described how, on 12 July 1963, she and Brady set out ontheir first ‘murder hunt’. By now Myra Hindley owned a broken-down van. She wassent ahead in the van, with Brady following behind on his motorbike. Her job wasto pick up a girl and offer her a lift. The first child they saw was Myra’snext-door neighbour, so she drove past her. The second was sixteen-year-oldPauline Reade, who was on her way to a dance. Myra offered her a lift, and sheaccepted. In the van, Myra explained that she was on her way to Saddleworth Moorto look for a glove she had lost at a picnic. If Pauline would like to come andhelp her search, she would give her a pile of records in the back of the van.Pauline was delighted to accept.Once on the moor, Brady arrived on his motorbike, and was introduced as Myra’sboyfriend. Then Brady and Pauline went off to look for the glove. (Since it wasJuly it was still daylight.) By the time Brady returned to the car, it was dark.He led Myra to the spot where Pauline Reade’s body was lying. Her throat hadbeen cut, and her clothes were in disarray; Myra accepted that Brady had rapedher. That, after all, had been the whole point of the murder. Together theyburied the body, using a spade they had brought with them. Brady told her thatat one point Pauline was struggling so much that he had thought of calling forher to hold the girl’s hands – clearly, he had no doubt that she wouldco-operate. On the way home, they passed Pauline’s mother and brother,apparently searching for her. Back at home, Brady burned his bloodstained shoesand trousers.In an open letter to the press in January 1990, Brady was to contradict MyraHindley’s account; he insisted that injuries to the nose and forehead of PaulineReade had been inflicted by her, and that she had also committed some form oflesbian assault on Pauline Reade. According to Brady, Myra participated activelyand willingly in the murders.Five months later, Brady was ready for another murder. On Saturday 23 November1963 they hired a car – the van had been sold – and drove to nearby Ashtonmarket. There, according to Myra, Brady got into conversation with atwelve-year-old boy, John Kilbride, and told him that, ‘If Jack would help themlook for a missing glove, he would give him a bottle of sherry he had won in theraffle’. Because Myra was present, John Kilbride accompanied them withoutsuspicion. They drove up to Saddleworth Moor, and the boy unsuspectinglyaccompanied Brady into the darkness. Myra Hindley claims that she drove aroundfor a while, and that when she came back and flashed her lights, Brady came outof the darkness and told her that he had already buried the body. He alsomentioned taking the boy’s trousers down and giving him a slap on the buttocks.In fact, Myra said, she was fairly certain that he had raped John Kilbride. Hehad explained that he had strangled him because the knife he had was too bluntto cut his throat.In June the following year – in 1964 – Brady told her he was ‘ready to doanother one’. (Like all serial killers he had a ‘cooling-off period’ – in thiscase about six months.) According to Myra, he told her that committing a murdergave him a feeling of power. By now they had their own car, a Mini. On 16 June1964 she stopped her car and asked a twelve-year-old boy, Keith Bennett, if hewould help her load some boxes from an off-licence; like John Kilbride, KeithBennett climbed in unsuspectingly. The murder was almost a carbon copy of theprevious one; Keith Bennett was strangled and buried on Saddleworth Moor. Bradyadmitted this time that he had raped him, and added: ‘What does it matter?’Keith Bennett’s body has never been found.On Boxing Day 1965 Brady and Hindley picked up a ten-year-old girl, Lesley AnnDowney, at a fairground at Ancoats. Myra Hindley had taken her grandmother tovisit an uncle. They took the child back to the house, and Brady switched on atape recorder. Myra claims she was in the kitchen with the dogs when she heardthe child screaming. Brady was ordering her to take off her coat and squeezingher by the back of the neck. Then Lesley’s hands were tied with a handkerchiefand Brady set up the camera and a bright light. The child was ordered toundress, and Brady then made her assume various pornographic poses while hefilmed her. At this point, Myra claims she was ordered to go and run a bath; shestayed in the bathroom until the water became cold. When she went back into thebedroom, Lesley had been strangled, and there was blood on her thighs – fromwhich Myra realised that she had been raped. At eight o’clock that evening theytook the body up to Saddleworth Moor and buried it.In his open letter to the press in January 1990, Ian Brady denied that Myra hadplayed no active part in the murder of Lesley Ann Downey. ‘She insisted uponkilling Lesley Ann Downey with her own hands, using a two-foot length of silkcord, which she later used to enjoy toying with in public, in the secretknowledge of what it had been used for.’In October 1965, Brady decided it was time for another murder. He had alsodecided that he needed another partner in crime, and that Myra’sseventeen-year-old brother-in-law, David Smith, was the obvious choice. Smithhad already been in trouble with the law. He seemed unable to hold down a job.His wife was pregnant for the second time, and they had just been given aneviction notice. So Smith listened with interest when Brady suggested a hold-upat an Electricity Board showroom. On 6 October Smith came to the house hoping toborrow some money, but they were all broke. Brady suggested: ‘We’ll have to rolla queer.’ An hour later, Brady picked up a seventeen-year-old homosexual, EdwardEvans, and invited him back to the house in Hattersley. Back at the flat, Myrawent off to fetch David Smith. They had only just returned when there was acrash from the living room. Brady was rolling on the floor, grappling withEvans. Then he seized an axe and struck him repeatedly: ‘Everywhere was onecomplete pool of blood.’ When Evans lay still, Brady strangled him. Then hehanded the bloodstained hatchet to Smith, saying ‘Feel the weight of that’. Hismotive was obviously to get Smith’s fingerprints on the haft. Together, theymopped up the blood and wrapped up the body in polythene. Then Smith went home,promising to return the next day to help dispose of the body. But Brady hadmiscalculated. Smith might feel in theory that ‘people are like maggots, small,blind and worthless’, but the fact of murder was too much for him. When hearrived home he was violently sick, and told his wife what had happened.Together they decided to phone the police, creeping downstairs armed with ascrewdriver and carving-knife in case Brady was waiting for them. The followingmorning, a man dressed as a baker’s roundsman knocked at Brady’s door, and whenMyra opened it, identified himself as a police officer. Evans’s body was foundin the spare bedroom. Forensic examination revealed dog hair on his underclothes– the hair of Myra Hindley’s dog – indicating that he and Brady had engaged insex, probably while Myra was fetching David Smith.Hidden in the spine of a prayer book police found a cloakroom ticket, which ledthem to Manchester Central Station. In two suitcases they discoveredpornographic photos, tapes and books on sex and torture; the photographsincluded those of Lesley Ann Downey, with a tape recording of her voice pleadingfor mercy. A twelve-year-old girl, Patricia Hodges, who had occasionallyaccompanied Brady and Hindley to the moors, took the police to Hollin BrownKnoll, and there the body of Lesley Ann Downey was dug up. John Kilbride’s gravewas located through a photograph that showed Hindley crouching on it with a dog.(When later told that her dog had died while in the hands of the police, shemade the classic remark: ‘They’re nothing but bloody murderers.’) PaulineReade’s body was not found until 1987, as a result of Myra Hindley’s confessionto Topping. Brady helped in the search on the moor and as we know, the body ofKeith Bennett has never been recovered.Brady’s defence was that Evans had been killed unintentionally, in the course ofa struggle, when he and Smith tried to rob him. Lesley Ann Downey, he claimed,had been brought to the house by Smith to pose for pornographic pictures, forwhich she had been paid ten shillings. (His original story was that she had beenbrought to the house by two men.) After the session, she left the house withSmith. He flatly denied knowing anything about any of the other murders, but thetape recording of Lesley Ann Downey’s screams and pleas for mercy made it clearthat Brady and Hindley were responsible for her death. Both were sentenced tolife imprisonment.Perhaps the most interesting point to emerge from Myra Hindley’s confession wasthat Brady ‘didn’t show a lot of interest in her sexually’, but for the firstfew times they had normal sexual intercourse. There were times when he justwanted her to relieve him, and on a couple of occasions he had forced her tohave anal sex with him, which she described as being ‘dreadfully painful’. Onother occasions he liked her to insert a candle in his anus while he relievedhimself. Nothing could demonstrate more clearly the lack of enthusiasm of thehigh-dominance male for the medium-dominance female. Sexual excitement mustinvolve a sense of conquest, and this girl had been a pushover. To enjoy sex hehas to ‘use’ her. The first time was satisfactory because she found it painful.Sodomy was no doubt enjoyable for the same reason. He has no desire to give herpleasure; she, as the ‘slave’, must give him pleasure – by masturbating him orinserting a candle in his anus while he masturbated himself (the ultimateindignity) – while receiving none herself. All this made no difference. She saidshe could not stress strongly enough how totally obsessed and besotted she waswith Brady. After he finally invited her out and she became in her own words ‘aSaturday night stand’, she would spend the week in a fever of anxiety waitingfor Saturday night to come round again. She said she could not explain theinfatuation, but it stemmed partly from the fact that Brady was so differentfrom anybody else she had met. ‘Within months he had convinced me there was noGod at all: he could have told me that the earth was flat, the moon was made ofgreen cheese and the sun rose in the west, I would have believed him, such washis power of persuasion, his softly convincing means of speech which fascinatedme, because I could never fully comprehend, only browse at the odd sentence hereand there, believing it to be gospel truth.’She goes to the heart of Brady’s psychological motivation when she says: ‘Hewanted to get rich and become “a somebody” – not just do a nine-to-five jobworking for somebody else.’ This was the source of that curious and irrationalresentment that seems so typical of the criminal – anger at feeling that lifehad cast him for the role of a nobody. In his 1990 ‘confession’, Brady explainedobscurely that he saw the murders ‘as products of an existentialist philosophy,in tandem with the spiritualism of Death itself’. What is clear is that, likePanzram, Brady felt that somebody deserved to suffer for his own miseries.Topping remarks: ‘On one occasion when I was with him he told me that he did notbelieve in God, that it was a nonsense to believe in a deity. But he said thatafter the killing of John Kilbride, he looked up into the sky, shook his fistand said “Take that, you bastard!”’ We may recall that Gallego had told a prisoncounsellor: ‘The only thing I really care about is killing God.’ The phrasinghere is interesting. It is obviously impossible to ‘kill’ God. All that ispossible is to ‘defy’ God, to try to get revenge on God, as William Hickmantried to get revenge on Perry Parker by kidnapping and killing his daughterMarian. Gallego’s resentment was so fierce that the word ‘defy’ seemedinadequate; he had to speak of ‘killing’ God, because killing was his ultimateway of expressing resentment. This is the vital key to the self-esteem killer:the desire to ‘get back’ at somebody. The artist Paul Gauguin said: ‘Life beingwhat it is, one dreams of revenge.’One of the first recorded cases of a wife acting as a procurer for her husband’srape victims occurred in 1963 in Lansing, Michigan. On 4 July twenty-year-oldLloyd Higdon and his wife picked up the fourteen-year-old daughter of aneighbour and offered to take her for a drive. Instead she was tied up and takento Higdon’s house; there she was ordered to undress and, when she protested,told that if she refused she would be sold into white slavery and never see herparents again. The girl removed her own clothes and made no resistance to rape.She was then driven home and told never to mention it. Unable to conceal herstate of shock, she finally told her parents. Higdon was arrested, but sinceintercourse had taken place with her consent, a court decided to regard it asstatutory rape, and he was sentenced to a term of between four to fifteen years.He was out two years later. On the afternoon of 17 July 1967 he and his live-ingirlfriend, Lucille Brumit, aged twenty-nine, picked up thirteen-year-oldRoxanne Sandbrook in Lansing; the girl already knew Higdon, who lived only threestreets away. She was driven to a rubbish dump near Jackson, Michigan, whereHigdon tried to rape her; when she resisted, he strangled her. Her body wasfound on the dump a month later, in an advanced state of decomposition.Interviews with the dead girl’s friends revealed that she often babysat for thenext-door neighbour of a known sex offender, Lloyd Higdon – who happened to beserving a term in the local jail for violating his parole and leaving the area.Questioned separately, Higdon and Lucille Brumit finally admitted to theabduction of Roxanne Sandbrook. Higdon pleaded guilty to murder, and receivedlife imprisonment.Since that time there have been many similar cases, in some of which it becomesclear that the woman played an active part in the rape and murder. In 1968 MrsJoyce Ballard of Chatham, Kent, admitted to enticing a twelve-year-old girl intoher flat so that her husband, Robert Ballard, could assault her. Ballard, whowas obsessed by books on torture and witchcraft, tied up the girl, cut open herveins, and stabbed her; then – probably appalled by what he had done – hecommitted suicide. Joyce Ballard was sentenced to three years in prison.A case that took place in Western Australia in 1986 may be cited as anothertypical example. On Monday 6 November a half-naked teenage girl ran into ashopping centre in Fremantle begging for help; she later told police that shehad been dragged into a car the previous evening by a man and a woman and takento a house where she was chained to the bed and raped repeatedly. On Mondayafternoon the couple left her unchained in the bedroom, and she succeeded inescaping through a window. The police went immediately to the house in MoorhouseStreet, Willagee, where the girl had been held, and arrested David and CatherineBirnie, both thirty-five years old. Questioned by detectives from Perth’s MajorCrimes Squad, they quickly admitted murdering and burying four other girls infour weeks, and led the police to the graves. In the Glen Eagle Forest,thirty-four miles south of Perth, police discovered three naked bodies inshallow graves, and another on the edge of a pine forest near Wanneroo, fiftymiles north of Perth. They were identified as twenty-two-year-old Mary Neilson,a psychology student at the University of Western Australia, Noelene Patterson,thirty-one, an airline hostess, Denise Keren Brown, twenty-one, a computeroperator, and a fifteen-year-old schoolgirl, Susannah Candy. The women hadvanished between 6 October and 5 November 1986 – the last victim, Denise Brown,was murdered earlier on the same day that the teenage girl was abducted andraped.It soon became clear that Catherine Birnie had played an active part in themurders. She had taken photographs of the corpses, one of which showed herhusband in an act of intercourse, and had helped him to kill the women. Thevictims were abducted – two of them while hitchhiking – and taken to theBirnies’ house, where they were chained up in a bedroom and repeatedly raped.Mary Neilson had gone to the Birnies’ house to buy car tyres. (Birnie worked ina car-wrecking yard.) She had been held at knifepoint and chained to the bed;Catherine Birnie watched while her husband raped her. Then she was taken to theGlen Eagle National Park, where she was raped again. She was begging for herlife as Birnie garrotted her with a nylon cord. After this, both Birniesmutilated the body to prevent it from swelling in its shallow grave.On 20 October fifteen-year-old Susannah Candy was picked up while hitchhiking.She was held prisoner and raped for several days. During this time she was madeto write two letters to her parents, explaining that she was safe and well. Shewas finally strangled by Catherine Birnie.Noelline Patterson had been abducted after her car had run out of petrol; theBirnies had helped to push it to a service station, after which she was forcedinto their car at knifepoint. According to a workmate of Birnie’s, the couplealready knew Noelline Patterson, and had helped to wallpaper her home. Duringthe three days she was kept prisoner, Birnie showed so much interest in her thatCatherine Birnie became violently jealous. It was she who finally insisted thatNoelline should be killed. Birnie gave her a heavy dose of sleeping tablets, andstrangled her while she was unconscious. (When she showed the police Noelline’sgrave in the Glen Eagle Forest, Catherine Birnie spat on it.)Denise Brown was also hitchhiking when the Birnies abducted her at knifepoint on4 November. She was taken to the house at Willagee, chained to the bed and rapedover a two-day period. Then she was taken to a pine plantation near Wanneroo;Birnie raped her again, and stabbed her twice while doing so. He failed to killher, and Catherine Birnie handed her husband a bigger knife, with which hestabbed her in the neck; but even in her grave, the victim tried to sit up.Birnie had to fracture her skull with blows from the back of the axe before shecould be buried. Three days later, they abducted the seventeen-year-old girlwhose escape led to their arrest.The Birnies were also suspected of being involved in three earlierdisappearances of women; but it has been pointed out that this seems unlikely,since they confessed so readily to the four later murders. The pattern of themurders suggests that the abduction of Mary Neilson was unplanned – that Birniedecided to rape her when she came to the house to buy tyres, and that havingexperienced the pleasure of possessing a ‘sex slave’, he went on to abduct theother four girls. Case after case of this kind indicates how quickly sex crimebecomes an addictive obsession.Because the Birnies pleaded guilty, little evidence about the crimes, or aboutthe psychology of the killers, emerged in court. Newspaper reporters tried tomake up for this by interviewing their relations and acquaintances. Birnie’stwenty-one-year-old brother James – who had himself been in prison for sexoffences – stated that his brother was a violent and romantic man, a complex andcontradictory character who often gave his women flowers and chocolates, but whoowned a huge pornographic video collection and needed sex six times a day.During a temporary break-up with his wife, Bernie had forced his brother topermit sodomy. As a twenty-first birthday present, James was allowed to makelove to his brother’s wife.David Birnie was the oldest of five children; the family had broken up when hewas ten, and the children had been placed in institutions. Birnie’s mother toldreporters she had not seen him in years. The father, a laundry worker, had diedthe previous year.Catherine Birnie had also had a lonely and miserable childhood; after hermother’s death she had been sent to live with her grandparents in Perth. ‘Peoplewho knew her well said she rarely laughed and had few pleasures. She never had aplaymate and other children were not allowed in her grandparents’ house.’ Hergrandmother died in front of the child in the throes of an epileptic fit.She had known David Birnie since childhood. When she became pregnant at sixteen,she and Birnie teamed up and went on a crime rampage, breaking into shops andfactories. They were caught and convicted, but Birnie escaped and they committedanother string of burglaries. Again, both were convicted. When she was released,Catherine Birnie became a domestic help, and married the son of the house; theyhad six children. Birnie, in the meantime, had an unsuccessful marriage, andbecame a jockey; his employment terminated when he tried to attack a womansexually wearing nothing but a stocking mask. After sixteen years of marriage,Catherine met Birnie again and began an affair with him. Two years later, sheleft her husband, walking out without warning, and went to live with Birnie. Apsychologist who examined her after her arrest said that he had never seenanyone so emotionally dependent on another person.Birnie’s counsel read a statement in which Birnie said he was extremely sorryfor what he had done, and was pleading guilty to spare the victim’s families theordeal of a trial. ‘He does not wish to present any defence of insanity. “I knewand understood what I was doing and I knew it was wrong.”’Their trial, on 3 March 1987, lasted only thirty minutes, and both Birnies weresentenced to life imprisonment.There is an obvious difference between the Birnie case and the Moors Murders.Although Myra Hindley was brought up in the home of her grandmother, she had anemotionally secure childhood, and was a well-adjusted teenager. Yet both womenbecame criminals as a result of becoming emotionally dependent on a man withcriminal tendencies. Both participated willingly in abductions which they knewwould lead to rape and murder. Myra Hindley claimed to have taken no active partin the rapes and murders (although Brady was later to deny this and insist shehad participated in both); Catherine Birnie watched with pleasure and evenstrangled one of the victims. Yet it seems clear that neither woman would havebecome involved in crime except under the influence of a high-dominance male. Ifwe consider again the case of Patty Hearst and the ‘Symbionese Liberation Army’,it is hard to avoid the conclusion that ‘brainwashing’ may be a far morefrequent phenomenon than is generally realised.On 20 June 1955 a fourteen-year-old girl, Patty Ann Cook, was sunbathing on aninflated mattress in her backyard in Rome, Georgia, when a green pick-up truckstopped, and the driver asked directions. Then he asked her if she would like alift to the swimming pool, and she accepted eagerly. A neighbour saw them driveoff. Instead of taking her to the pool, Willie Cochran, an ex-convict in hismiddle thirties, drove on to a remote logging road, dragged her from thevehicle, and raped her. After that he shot her through the head, and dropped herin the river, weighted down with a big monkey wrench. After the girl’sdisappearance, Cochran came under suspicion because he was a known sex offender,and drove a green pick-up truck. Under police questioning, he involved himselfin contradictions, and finally confessed to the murder. Cochran was electrocutedin August 1955. The case is made memorable by a remark made by the judge, J.H.Paschall: ‘The male sexual urge has a strength out of all proportion to anyuseful purpose that it serves.’ The comment could stand as an epigraph to thehistory of sex crime.While it would be a mistake to assume that all serial killers are riven by thekind of resentment that motivated Brady and Gallego, there can be no doubt thatall are driven by a sexual urge that ‘has a strength out of all proportion toany useful purpose that it serves’. We have seen that the combination of ahigh-dominance, highly sexed male with a medium-dominance and emotionallydependent female can lead to strange examples of partnership in sex crime.Another widely publicised case of the seventies demonstrates how a combinationof a high- and a medium-dominance male can produce the same effect.In the four months between 18 October 1977 and 17 February 1978 the naked bodiesof ten girls were dumped on hillsides in the Los Angeles area. Newspaperschristened the killer ‘the Hillside Strangler’. In fact, it was known to thepolice from an early stage that two men were involved; sperm inside the deadwomen revealed that one of the rapists was a ‘secretor’ (one whose blood groupcan be determined from his bodily fluids) and one a non-secretor.The first victim was a black prostitute named Yolanda Washington, who operatedaround Hollywood Boulevard. Her naked corpse was found in the Forest Lawncemetery near Ventura Freeway; she had been strangled with a piece of cloth. Twoweeks later, on 1 November 1977, fifteen-year-old Judy Miller, a runaway, wasfound in the town of La Crescenta, not far from the Los Angeles suburb ofGlendale. She had been raped vaginally and anally, then strangled, and marks onher wrists and ankles, and in the area of her mouth, indicated that she had beenbound with adhesive tape. It was not until the last weeks of November, aroundThanksgiving, that the police realised that they had an epidemic of sex murderson their hands; seven more strangled corpses were found, tossed casually onhillsides or by the road, as if thrown from a car. The youngest victims were twoschoolgirls, aged twelve and fourteen; the oldest was a twenty-eight-year-oldscientology student, Jane King. The last victim of the Thanksgiving ‘spree’ waseighteen-year-old Lauren Wagner, and burn marks on her palms suggested that shehad been tortured before death.Los Angeles has about seven murders a day, but this number of sex murders in afew weeks was something of a record. Women became afraid to go out alone atnight, and shops ran out of tear gas and Mace (similar to CS gas). By the timeLauren Wagner’s body was discovered, Los Angeles was in a state of panic.In this case, at least, they had an important clue. Lauren Wagner had beenabducted as she climbed out of her car in front of her parents’ home. Aneighbour had looked out of her window to see why her dog was barking, and hadheard Lauren shout: ‘You won’t get away with this.’ She had then seen two menforce the girl into a big dark sedan with a white top, and drive away. The womanhad seen the men clearly; the elder of the two had bushy hair and was‘Latin-looking’, while the younger one was taller, and had acne scars on hisneck. The following day, her telephone rang, and a voice with a New York accenttold her she had better keep quiet or she was as good as dead.If the police had grasped the significance of this phone call they could haveterminated the career of the Hillside Stranglers forthwith, for the only way aman could have obtained a telephone number without knowing the name of thesubscriber was through some friend at the telephone exchange. A check with theLos Angeles exchange would have revealed the identity of one of thestranglers . . .There would be two more victims. One was a seventeen-year-old prostitute namedKimberley Diane Martin; on 15 December 1977 her naked body was found sprawled ona vacant lot near City Hall. A man had telephoned a call-girl agency the eveningbefore and requested a blonde in black underwear to be sent to the TamarindApartment building in Hollywood; Kimberley Martin was despatched, anddisappeared.On 17 February 1978 someone reported seeing an orange car halfway down a cliffon the Angeles Crest Highway. The boot proved to contain another naked body,that of twenty-year-old Cindy Hudspeth, a student and part-time waitress; shehad been raped and sodomised by two men. After this, the Hillside murdersceased.Almost a year later, on 12 January 1979, the police chief of Bellingham, a smallcoastal town in Washington State, was notified that two students, Karen Mandicand Diane Wilder, were missing. On the previous evening, Karen Mandic had toldher boyfriend that she had been offered $100 by a security supervisor named KenBianchi to do a ‘house-sitting’ job – to spend an evening in an empty housewhile its security alarm was repaired.Bianchi was a personable young man from Los Angeles, and he had been inBellingham since the previous May. He was known to be an affectionate husbandand father, and a conscientious worker; it seemed unlikely that he had anythingto do with the disappearance of the two girls. In fact, he denied knowing them.Later that day, the bodies of the girls were found in the rear seat of KarenMandic’s car, parked in a cul-de-sac.Kenneth Bianchi was immediately picked up. His air of bewilderment seemed sogenuine that the police were convinced they had the wrong man. His common-lawwife Kelli Boyd, who had recently borne his child, was equally certain thatBianchi was incapable of murder. When Bianchi’s home was searched, and thepolice found stolen property in his basement, it became apparent that he was notas honest as everyone had assumed. Medical evidence left no doubt that he wasthe murderer. Both girls had semen stains on their underwear; so did Bianchi.Diane Wilder had been menstruating, and Bianchi had menstrual stains on hisunderwear. On the stairs leading down to the basement of the empty house, policefound a pubic hair identical to Bianchi’s. Carpet fibres on the clothes of thedead girls corresponded to the carpet in the basement of the house. What hadhappened became clear. Bianchi had offered Karen Mandic the ‘house-sitting job’.When she had arrived, he made some excuse to take her in alone – probably toturn on the electricity. As she preceded him to the basement, he strangled herwith a ligature – the angle of the marks on her throat showed that the killerwas standing above and behind her. Then he went out and got Diane Wilder. Whenboth girls were dead he had completed some kind of sexual assault – no semen wasfound inside them – then placed them in Karen’s car and driven it away. Bothgirls had been sworn to silence about the house-sitting job, ‘for securityreasons’, and he had no idea that Diane had told her boyfriend where she wasgoing.When Sergeant Frank Salerno, a detective on the Hillside Strangler case, heardof Bianchi’s arrest, he hurried to Bellingham. Bianchi sounded like the tall,acne-scarred young man seen outside Lauren Wagner’s home, and his cousin AngeloBuono, who lived in Glendale, Los Angeles, sounded exactly like the other – thebushy-haired, Latin-looking man. Buono was a highly unsavoury character. He hadbeen married four times, but all his wives had left him because of his brutality– when one of them had refused him sex, he had sodomised her in front of thechildren. He had also been a pimp, forcing girls into white slavery – andBianchi had been his partner. He was an obvious suspect as the second HillsideStrangler.At this point a strange and interesting development occurred. Bianchi’s lawyerhad been impressed by his apparent sincerity in denying that he knew anythingabout the murders; so was a psychiatric social worker. They sent for ProfessorJohn G. Watkins of the University of Montana, and suggested to him that Bianchimight be suffering from the same problem as Billy Milligan (see here[../Text/chapter_005.xhtml#page_204]) – multiple personality. Watkins placedBianchi under hypnosis, and within minutes, Bianchi was speaking in a strange,low voice, and introducing himself as someone called Steve. Steve seemed be anunpleasant, violent character with a sneering laugh, and he declared that hehated ‘Ken’ and had done his best to ‘fix him’. Then he described how, oneevening in 1977, Ken Bianchi had walked into his cousin’s home, and found Angelomurdering a girl. Steve had then taken over Ken’s body, and become Buono’swilling accomplice in the Hillside Stranglings . . .Suddenly, it began to look as if there was no chance of convicting eitherBianchi or Buono for the murders. If Bianchi was ‘insane’, then he could not beconvicted, and he could not testify against his cousin in court. Anotherpsychiatrist, Ralph B. Allison, the author of a classic on multiple personalitycalled Minds in Many Pieces, also interviewed Bianchi and agreed that he was agenuine ‘MPD’. Soon after the arrests, there was even a book written about thecase, The Hillside Strangler by Ted Schwarz, which accepted that Bianchi was amultiple personality.At this point, the prosecution decided to call in their own expert, Dr Martin T.Orne. A simple experiment quickly convinced Orne that Bianchi was faking. Goodhypnotic subjects can be made to hallucinate the presence of another person.Orne hypnotised Bianchi and told him that his lawyer, Dean Brett, was sitting inan empty chair. Bianchi immediately did something that Orne had never seenbefore in a hypnotised subject – leaned forward and shook the invisible lawyerwarmly by the hand. In Orne’s experience, a truly hypnotised person never triesto touch the hallucination. Orne also felt that Bianchi overplayed thesituation, saying ‘Surely you can see him?’ A subject who genuinely ‘saw’ hislawyer would assume that everyone else did too. Bianchi was clearly fakinghypnosis. Was he also faking multiple personality?Again, an experiment provided the answer. Orne dropped a hint that most‘multiples’ have at least three personalities. The next time he was underhypnosis, Bianchi immediately produced another personality, a frightened childnamed Billy. It now seemed virtually certain that Bianchi was malingering.It was the police who proved it beyond all doubt. Allison had asked ‘Steve’ ifhe had a last name, and Steve had mumbled ‘Walker’. Salerno had seen the nameSteve Walker in Bianchi’s papers. It proved to be the name of a graduate inpsychology from California State University. One of Bianchi’s dreams had been tobecome a psychiatrist, but he had possessed no qualifications. He had overcomethis with a little confidence trickery. He had placed an advertisement in a LosAngeles newspaper offering a job to a graduate in psychology. Thomas StevenWalker had answered the advertisement, and sent Bianchi some of his academicpapers. He never saw them again. Bianchi used Walker’s name – and papers – toobtain a diploma from California State University, requesting that the nameshould not be filled in because he wanted to have it specially engraved. When hereceived it, Bianchi simply filled in his own name, and set himself up as apsychological counsellor.The fact that there was a real Steve Walker, and that Bianchi knew of hisexistence, finally left no doubt whatever that Bianchi was malingering. At asanity hearing in October 1979, Orne’s opinion carried the day; Bianchi wasjudged sane and able to stand trial. Now he realised that he might go to theelectric chair for the Hillside Stranglings in Los Angeles, Bianchi hastened toplead guilty to the two Bellingham murders, and to engage in plea-bargaining: toplead guilty to the Bellingham murders and to five of the Hillside Stranglingsfor a life sentence with a possibility of eventual parole, in exchange fortestifying against his cousin Angelo Buono. The plea of guilty made the expenseof a full-scale trial unnecessary, and on 21 October Kenneth Bianchi wassentenced to life imprisonment. He sobbed convincingly, and professed deepremorse.He was flown to Los Angeles, where his cousin had been arrested, but the casewas still far from over. Incredibly, the Los Angeles prosecutor’s office decidedthat since the chief witness against Buono was his cousin, and that Bianchi wasclearly unreliable – if not insane – it might be best to save the cost of atrial by dropping all murder charges against Buono. This extraordinary decisionwas fortunately overturned by Judge Ronald M. George, who decreed that Buonoshould stand trial anyway.Even in prison, Bianchi made strenuous efforts to persuade various women tosupply him with alibis, and one of them actually agreed to claim that he waswith her on the night of one of the murders; at the last minute, conscienceprevailed and she changed her mind.There was still another strange development to come. In June 1980, Bianchireceived a letter from a woman signing herself Veronica Lynn Compton, who askedhim if he would be willing to co-operate on a play about a female mass murdererwho injects semen into the sex organs of her victims to deceive the police intothinking the killer was a male. When Veronica Compton came to see him in prison,Bianchi became distinctly interested. She proved to be a glamorous brunette whowas obviously slightly unbalanced. She was fascinated by murder, and togetherthey fantasised about how pleasant it would be to go on a violent crime spree,cut off the private parts of their victims, and preserve them in embalmingfluid. Soon afterwards, they were exchanging love letters. Bianchi now suggestedthat he should prove her love by putting into operation the scheme she haddevised for her play: that she should murder a woman in Bellingham and injecther with sperm through a syringe, so that it would appear that the strangler wasstill at large. The infatuated Veronica agreed. Bianchi provided the sperm bymasturbating into the finger of a rubber glove, and smuggling it to her in thespine of a book. Veronica flew to Bellingham and registered at a motel calledthe Shangri-la. In a nearby bar she got into conversation with a young womancalled Kim Breed, and after several drinks, asked her if she would drive herback to her motel. At the Shangri-la, Kim Breed agreed to come in for a finalquick drink. In the motel room, Veronica vanished into the toilet, then came outarmed with a length of cord; she tiptoed up behind the unsuspecting girl andthrew the cord round her neck. Kim Breed was something of an athlete; shemanaged to throw her attacker over her head. As Veronica Compton lay, winded, onthe carpet, Miss Breed fled. When she returned to the motel with a male friend,her attacker had checked out and was on her way back to Los Angeles.It proved easy to trace her through her airline reservation. Veronica Comptonwas arrested, and in due course, the ‘copycat slayer’, as the newspaperslabelled her, received life imprisonment for attempted murder.The trial of Angelo Buono, which began in November 1981 and ended in November1983, was the longest murder trial in American history. When it came toBianchi’s turn to testify, it was obvious that he had no intention of standingby his plea-bargaining agreement; he was vague and contradictory. When JudgeGeorge pointed out that he could be returned to Washington’s Walla Walla – anotoriously tough jail – he became marginally more co-operative. Bianchi spentfive months on the stand, and the murders were described in appalling detail.Buono was finally found guilty of seven of them. Since his cousin had alreadyescaped with life imprisonment, the jury recommended that he should not besentenced to death. Buono received a life sentence with no possibility ofparole. Bianchi was returned to Walla Walla to serve out his sentence. In 1989,he married a ‘pen pal’, Shirlee J. Book, whom he met for the first time the daybefore the wedding.Through the detailed evidence given by Bianchi, it slowly became clear what hadturned the cousins into serial sex killers. Angelo Buono, born in New York inOctober 1935, had been in trouble with the police from the age of fourteen, andspent time in reformatories. He married for the first time at the age of twenty,but his brutality – and his penchant for sodomy – led to divorce; three moreunsuccessful marriages followed. In 1975, Buono set up his own car-body repairshop in Glendale, and became known as an excellent upholsterer – one of hiscustomers was Frank Sinatra. In spite of a certain brutal coarseness, he wasalways attractive to women, and liked to seduce under-age girls. His cousinKenneth Bianchi joined him in Los Angeles in 1976.Kenneth Alessio Bianchi was born in May 1951, the child of a Rochester (N.Y.)prostitute who gave him up at birth; he was adopted at the age of three months.(Zoologists have pointed out that the most important ‘imprinting’ occurs in thefirst weeks of a baby’s life; if a child receives no affection during this time,it remains permanently incapable of any deep relationship, and may become apsychopath.) He proved to be a bright, intelligent child, but a compulsive andpointless liar. Unlike his highly dominant cousin Angelo, Bianchi was aweak-willed person whose chief craving was to be regarded as a ‘somebody’, andhe would lie and deceive indefinitely to this end. When rejected by girlfriends,he had a tendency to turn violent. He was also a habitual thief. Unable to holddown a regular job, and turned down by the police force as obviously unsuitable,he decided to move to Los Angeles at the age of twenty-four.He moved in with his cousin Angelo, and was deeply impressed by the way theolder man bedded teenagers and induced them to perform oral sex. He applied tojoin the Los Angeles and the Glendale police, but both turned him down. It wasthen that he decided to set up as a psychiatrist, and placed the advertisementthat brought a reply from graduate Steven Walker.After a few months, Buono became bored with his weak-willed cousin and asked himto move out. Bianchi found a room in an apartment block and obtained a job witha real-estate company, which he soon lost when marijuana was found in his deskdrawer. Armed with his forged graduation certificate, he rented an office andset up as a psychiatrist, but patients failed to materialise. It was then thatBuono made the suggestion that they should become pimps. Bianchi met asixteen-year-old girl named Sabra Hannan at a party, and offered her a job as aphotographic model. When she moved into Bianchi’s house, she was raped, beaten,and forced into prostitution. So was a fifteen-year-old runaway named BeckySpears, who was subjected to sodomy so frequently that she had to wear a tamponin her rectum. These were only a few of Buono’s ‘stable’ of women.Problems arose in August 1976 when a Los Angeles lawyer rang and asked for agirl to be sent over. Becky Spears looked so obviously miserable that he askedher how she became a prostitute; when she told him her story he was so horrifiedthat he bought her a plane ticket and put her on the next plane home to Phoenix.Buono was enraged when Becky failed to return and made threatening phone calls.The lawyer countered by sending an enormous Hell’s Angel to see him, backed by anumber of equally muscular friends. When Buono – who was working inside a car –ignored his callers, the Hell’s Angel reached in through the window, liftedBuono out by his shirtfront, and asked: ‘Do I have your attention, Mr Buono?’After that the lawyer received no more threatening phone calls.This episode was almost certainly crucial in turning Buono into a serial killer.An intensely ‘macho’ male, he was undoubtedly outraged by the humiliation; inthe curiously illogical manner of criminals, he looked around for someone onwhom he could lay the blame, and his anger turned against women in general andprostitutes in particular. Soon after, his pride received another affront. Froman experienced professional prostitute, Bianchi and Buono had purchased a listof clients who liked to have girls sent to their houses. When he tried to useit, Buono discovered that he had been swindled: it was a list of men who wantedto visit a prostitute on her own premises. The woman who had sold him the listwas nowhere to be found. She had been accompanied by a black prostitute namedYolanda Washington, who worked on Hollywood Boulevard. On 16 October 1977Bianchi and Buono picked up Yolanda Washington, and both raped her beforeBianchi strangled her in the back of the car. She was the first victim of theHillside Stranglers.The experience of killing a woman satisfied some sadistic compulsion in both ofthem. On 31 October 1977 they picked up a fifteen-year-old prostitute named JudyMiller and took her back to Buono’s house at 703 East Colorado. There she wasundressed, and taken into the bedroom by Buono. After he had finished with her,Bianchi sodomised her. Then they strangled her, suffocating her at the same timewith a plastic supermarket bag. The murder was totally unnecessary since thegirl would have been glad to accept a few dollars.The next victim was an out-of-work dancer named Lissa Kastin. They stopped herand identified themselves as policemen – a method they used in most cases – thentook her back to Buono’s house. There she was handcuffed and her clothes cut offwith scissors. Both men were repelled by her hairy legs; so Bianchi raped herwith a root beer bottle, then strangled her, while Buono sat on her legsshouting ‘Die, cunt, die!’ (Buono invariably referred to women as ‘cunts’.)Bianchi enjoyed strangling her, and allowed her to lose consciousness and reviveseveral times before killing her.A few days later, Bianchi fell into conversation with an attractive Scientologystudent, Jane King, at a bus stop. When Buono drove up and offered him a lifthome, the girl also accepted. Back in Buono’s home they were delighted to findthat her pubis was shaven. Because she struggled when being raped, they decidedthat she needed a lesson. A plastic bag was placed over her head while Bianchisodomised her, and she was allowed to suffocate to death as he came to a climax.The shaven pubis gave them the idea that it would be exciting to rape a child.On 13 November they approached two schoolgirls, fourteen-year-old Dollie Cepedaand Sonja Johnson, twelve, and identified themselves as policemen. The girls hadjust been shoplifting, and made no objection when asked to accompany the‘policemen’. In Buono’s house, both were raped, then Sonja was murdered in thebedroom. When Buono came back for Dollie, she asked: ‘Where’s Sonja?’, and Buonotold her: ‘You’ll be seeing her soon.’When Bianchi had been living in the apartment building in Hollywood, he had beenenraged when an art student next door spurned his advances. So Bianchi and Buonocalled on twenty-year-old Kristina Weckler and Bianchi told her he was now apoliceman, and that someone had crashed into her Volkswagen outside. Sheaccompanied them down to see, and was hustled into their car and taken back toBuono’s house, where Bianchi obtained his revenge for the earlier snub. Theydecided to try to kill her by a new method – injecting her with cleaning fluid –but when this failed, they piped coal gas into a plastic bag over her head,strangling her at the same time.On 28 November 1977 they saw an attractive red-headed girl climbing into hercar, and decided to follow her. Lauren Wagner was having an affair with amarried man, and had just spent the afternoon in his bed. The two ‘policemen’told her they were arresting her as she pulled up in front of her parents’ home,and she was dragged, struggling, into their car. A dog barked, and a neighboursaw what was happening, but failed to grasp its implications. At Buono’s house,Lauren Wagner pretended to enjoy being raped, hoping that they would allow herto live. They tried to kill her by attaching live electric wires to her palms,but these only caused burns; they were finally forced to strangle her. The nextday, Buono obtained the telephone number of the house where the dog had barkedby ringing a friend on the exchange, then made the threatening phone call.In December, the prostitute Kimberley Martin was summoned by telephone to theTamarind Apartments, where Bianchi lived, then taken back to Buono’s where shewas raped and murdered. Both men agreed she was no good in bed.The final Hillside killing was virtually an accident. On 16 February 1978 a girlnamed Cindy Hudspeth came to Buono’s garage to see about new mats for her car.Bianchi arrived at the same time. The opportunity seemed too good to miss. Thegirl was spreadeagled naked on the bed and raped for two hours. Then she wasstrangled, and her body packed into the boot of her Datsun, which was pushed offa cliff on a scenic route. Bianchi had noted the spot some time before when hehad been fellated there by a teenage girl.Buono was becoming increasingly irritated by his cousin’s irresponsibility, andwas anxious to break with him. So when Bianchi’s girlfriend, Kelli Boyd, decidedto leave him and go back to her parents in Bellingham, Buono encouraged Bianchito follow her. Bianchi took his advice in May 1978. He could see that his cousinwanted to be rid of him, and it rankled. He felt like a rejected mistress. Thisseems to be the reason that, in January 1979, he decided to prove that he wascapable of committing murder without Buono’s help. He chose as his victim KarenMandic, a girl with whom he had worked in a big store. When he learned she wasliving with a friend, he told her to bring the friend too, but Karen Mandicfailed to keep her promise to tell no one where she was going, and KennethBianchi found himself under arrest. In prison, he sent a cautiously wordedletter to Buono, indicating that he had no intention of ‘snitching’. Buono’sresponse was a carefully worded phone call threatening violence to Bianchi’sfamily if he changed his mind. It was Buono’s biggest mistake. Bianchi wouldalmost certainly have been glad to remain silent if he felt he was protectinghis hero. Buono’s response turned hero-worship to hostility, and Bianchi decidedto forget loyalty and concentrate on saving his own skin by inventing a criminalalter-ego. That scheme came very close to succeeding; but when it failed,Bianchi had thrown away his last defence.Back in Buono’s presence, in the courtroom in Los Angeles, the old hero-worshipseems to have reasserted itself, and he decided to go back on his word to helpput Buono behind bars. In the event, it made no difference.Is it possible that Bianchi was a genuine multiple personality? Judge Georgecriticised psychiatrist John D. Watkins, who first diagnosed Bianchi as an MPD,for ‘incredible naiveté’. Watkins himself remains unrepentant, commenting: ‘TheKenneth personality . . . always smoked filter-tip cigarettes and held thembetween first and second fingers, palm towards the face. The Steve personalityalways tore the filters off and held the cigarette between the thumb and firstfinger, palm away from the face. Bianchi still continues to show the samealternation now in prison, although the law is no longer interested in his truediagnosis.’1 [../Text/chapter_006.xhtml#ft001]Yet two pieces of evidence contradict this view. When asked by his employer inBellingham if he knew Karen Mandic, Bianchi insisted that he had ‘never heard ofher’. Yet he had made her acquaintance that summer when both had worked for thesame department store. Unless his alter-ego ‘Steve’ was in charge during thewhole of his time at the store – in which case ‘Ken’ would have been puzzled bylong periods of amnesia – this must have been a lie.Again, ‘Steve’ told Dr Watkins that he had first become involved in murder when‘Ken’ had walked in on Angelo Buono and found him killing a girl. His moredetailed confession makes it clear that this is untrue; the first murder(Yolanda Washington) and all subsequent ones involved them both.Most multiple personalities – probably all – have experienced severe traumas inchildhood, often involving sexual abuse and brutal beatings; investigations intoBianchi’s childhood background revealed none of this; it was normal andaffectionate. His allegations of ill treatment by his mother – made to thepsychiatrists – proved to be untrue.What may be of more significance is that soon after his arrest in Bellingham,Bianchi saw the television film Sybil, based on the case study by Flora RhetaSchreiber, about a girl with fourteen personalities. It was after this thatBianchi’s social worker began to suspect him of being a ‘multiple’.Dr Allison later retracted his view that Bianchi was a ‘multiple’; he explainedthat he had since become a prison psychiatrist, and was shocked to discover thatcriminals were habitual and obsessive liars, capable of offering as many as halfa dozen differing and incompatible views of the same event. Altogether, thereseems to be little doubt that Bianchi was faking multiple-personality disorder.From the point of view of the study of serial killers, one of the major pointsto emerge from the case is that the murders were not primarily sex crimes. Threeof the victims were prostitutes, and a fourth had expressed her intention ofbecoming one. In these instances, rape was obviously unnecessary; the realmotive for the crime was satisfaction of the sadistic sense of power that camefrom torture and murder. The case is an interesting illustration of Hazelwood’sremark that sex crime can service ‘non-sexual needs’ such as power and anger.In his book on the Hillside Stranglers Two of a Kind, Darcy O’Brien mentionsthat while Veronica Compton was in prison she entered into a romanticcorrespondence with another serial killer, the ‘Sunset Slayer’ Douglas Clark,and that Clark sent her a photograph of a body he had decapitated. It seemsclear from her behaviour – her playwriting activities and her attempt at a‘copycat crime’ – that Veronica Compton belonged to Maslow’s high-dominancegroup. Her attempts to enter into relationships with mass murderers may beinterpreted in the light of Maslow’s observation that even high-dominance womenseem to require a male who is of slightly higher dominance. In fact, the case ofthe Sunset Slayer illustrates such a bizarre relationship.On 9 August 1980 the headless body of a man was found in a car park on a streetin Van Nuys, a Los Angeles suburb; he had been shot and stabbed to death. Acheck with the licensing department revealed that the car belonged to a mancalled Jack Murray, and that his home was not far from the place where he wasfound. Searching the house, the police found evidence that, until a few monthsago, he had lived with a nurse called Carol Bundy. She had now apparently movedin with a man named Douglas Clark. The name struck a chord in the minds of theinvestigating officers. A few days earlier, an unknown man had telephoned thepolice to tell them that several recent murders of prostitutes had beencommitted by a boilermaker named Douglas Clark; but it was only one of manytips. On the other hand, one of the murders being investigated involved thedecapitation of a Sunset hooker named Exxie Wilson. Her headless body, togetherwith that of her room-mate Karen Jones, had been found on 24 June 1980 in thearea of Studio City and Burbank. Both had been shot. Exxie Wilson’s head hadbeen found in a box dumped in a driveway in Burbank. The hair had been washedand the face had been made-up like a Barbie doll; the mouth contained traces ofsperm. It seemed an unusual coincidence that Douglas Clark’s girlfriend shouldalso be associated with a case of decapitation . . .Carol Bundy, a good-looking but overweight woman of thirty-seven, was arrested,and under police questioning she stated that Jack Murray had been murdered byher new lover, Douglas Clark. However, Carol Bundy’s nursing supervisor had adifferent story to tell: that Carol had admitted to her that she had killed JackMurray; her reason was that Murray was threatening to tell the police that Clarkwas ‘the Sunset Slayer’. It seemed likely that Murray was the man who had madethe phone call about Clark.Clark himself was now arrested – a handsome, bespectacled man in hismid-thirties. His story was that he had merely agreed to help Carol Bundydispose of Murray’s head after she had killed him. (The head was never found.)He alleged that Carol Bundy had blackmailed him into helping her by threateningto show the police a photograph of himself having sex with an eleven-year-oldgirl.Clark insisted that Carol Bundy and her ex-lover Jack Murray were murderers ofsix prostitutes in the Hollywood area. He also admitted that he had been wearingwomen’s underwear since he was a child, and that his sexual tastes were ‘kinky’.When police found two guns at his place of work, and a bullet fired from one ofthem matched a bullet found in Exxie Wilson’s head, it began to seem likely thatClark himself was the man who had been killing prostitutes by shooting them inthe head.The story that now emerged as Clark and Bundy tried to implicate one anotherstartled even the Hollywood police officers, accustomed to cases involvingsexual perversion. Clark, it seemed, was a necrophile, one who enjoys havingsexual intercourse with dead bodies. He cruised along Sunset Boulevard until hehad found a prostitute who was willing to perform oral sex on him – mostHollywood prostitutes being willing to oblige for a sum of thirty to fortydollars. If the fellatio was successful and he reached orgasm, the girl wasusually allowed to go free. If it was unsuccessful, he shot her through thehead, then undressed her – keeping her underwear as a masturbation fetish – andhad intercourse with the body. Finally, the victims were dumped off freewayramps or in remote canyons.Clark finally admitted that he had been responsible for a stabbing that he hadtaken place on 2 April 1980. He had picked up a young prostitute outside aSunset Boulevard supermarket and requested oral sex. While she was engaged infellatio, he pulled out a knife and stabbed her repeatedly in the back, the headand chest. In spite of this – and an attempt to throttle her – she managed toopen the door of the estate car and fell out; Clark quickly drove away. The girllater recovered.The bullets linked Clark to at least six murders over a period of four months.The first had occurred on 2 March 1980 when the body of a teenage girl had beenfound in the Saugus-Newhall area of Los Angeles County; she had been shot todeath with a small-calibre pistol. The last was discovered on 30 June 1980: thenaked body of a seventeen-year-old runaway named Marnette Comer was found in aravine near Sylmar, in the San Fernando valley; she had been shot four timesthrough the head, and her stomach had been slit open. (Clark later admitted thatthis was to hasten decomposition.) On 11 June, two teenage girls had disappearedafter a party: fifteen year old Gina Marano and her stepsister Cynthia Chandler.Their bodies were found the next day, dumped in the same manner as the HillsideStrangler victims, off a freeway. They had been shot through the head, afterwhich their bodies had been sexually abused.Four days later, a friend of Cynthia Chandler received a phone call from a manwho identified himself as ‘Detective Clark’, and told her that the two girlswere dead. On 22 June the same man called again, to describe in detail how thegirls had been killed and then raped. The caller declared that he had seen thegirl to whom he was speaking at the party where he had picked up Gina andCynthia, ‘and now I want to do the same to you’. He told her he was having anorgasm while he was talking to her. The girl was to identify the voice as thatof Douglas Clark. It emerged later that, after killing the stepsisters, Clarkhad gone back home to fetch Carol Bundy, so she could share in his pleasure; butshe was not at home.Later that same day, Clark went back to the room of Exxie Wilson, a prostitutefrom Little Rock, Arkansas, and shot her through the head. After he haddecapitated her, Karen Jones returned home. Clark was about to get into his carafter placing the head in the boot; he pursued Karen down the street and shother. Then he went home and placed the head in the refrigerator. Carol Bundydescribed how he had taken it with him into the shower and used it for oral sex.According to Carol, she then washed the hair and made up the face as an act ofbravado. ‘We had a lot of fun with her.’ She admitted that it was she who haddumped the head, in its cardboard box, in the driveway in Burbank.It emerged that Carol Bundy had talked to her ex-lover, Jack Murray, about hernew paramour’s murders, and it was Murray’s threat to tip off the police thatled her to shoot him and cut off his head. (Bullets found in his body came fromher gun.) This in turn led to her arrest, and to that of Douglas Clark.Carol Bundy told the police that she and Clark had come together because theywanted to co-operate on crimes. He treated her badly, she said, and although hewas ‘extremely good in bed’, he was not very interested in normal sex. It had tobe ‘kinky’, and he preferred teenage girls. One of his fantasies was to cut agirl’s throat and have sex with her as she bled to death. The furthest he hadgone in this direction was to stab the young prostitute as she fellated him.At Clark’s trial in October 1982, his lawyer argued that he was insane, whileClark himself insisted – without much hope of convincing the jury – that he hadplayed no part in the crimes. On 28 January 1983 Clark was convicted of killingsix girls and sentenced to die in the gas chamber. Carol Bundy had originallyplanned to plead guilty but insane, but at her trial in May 1983 she changedthis to a plea of guilty; she was sentenced to life imprisonment.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/chapter_004.xhtml#fn001] Quoted in Open to Suggestion, The Uses andAbuses of Hynposis, by Robert Temple, 1989, p. 394."},{"pageContent":"SevenThe Roman Emperor SyndromeCASES LIKE THE Moors Murders, Gallego, Birnie, and the Sunset Slayer, make thereader aware that something very strange is happening to our society. DouglasClark told the jury: ‘I don’t march to the same drummer you do. If we were alllike me, Sodom and Gomorrah might look a nice place to stay.’ It might seem faircomment to say that killers like Clark, Heidnik, Gallego, Birnie, and Brady area sign that our world is rushing down a Gadarene slope into decadence and ruin.Yet such a verdict might be premature. There is nothing in the career of anymodern serial killer that could not be paralleled by equally horrifying eventsfrom the past – from the lives of Tiberius, Caligula, Tamerlaine, Ivan theTerrible, Vlad the Impaler, Gilles de Rais, Countess Elizabeth Bathory anddozens of others. The historian John Addington Symonds, in a section on ‘TheBlood-madness of Tyrants’ in his Renaissance in Italy, suggests that it might beexplained in medical terms, ‘a portentous secretion of black bile producing themelancholy which led him [Ibrahim ibn Ahmet] to atrocious crimes’. We can seethat this explanation simply fails to go to the heart of the matter. Tyrantsbecome cruel because they are unaccustomed to contradiction, and the leastopposition to their ideas fills them with a genuine conviction that the objectordeserves to die a painful death. They do not see it as a matter of cruelty, butof righteous anger and just punishment.In the past, only two groups of men were in a position to behave in this way:men in authority (which includes men like Gilles de Rais whose wealth seemed toplace them beyond the law) and men who regarded themselves as ‘outside society’– bandits and outlaws. The latter were often involved in incidents ofhair-raising cruelty – as can be seen, for example, in A Hangman’s Diary by thesixteenth-century Nuremberg executioner Franz Schmidt, who describes robbersdisembowelling pregnant women, while others forced a wife to eat fried eggs offthe corpse of her husband. In both cases – tyrants and outlaws – the brutalityseems to spring from a sense of being outside or above society and the law. Thisfeeling, as we can see, was shared by Ian Brady, Gerald Gallego and DouglasClark. ‘I don’t march to the same drummer you do.’What seems to have happened is that the advance of civilisation has raised thegeneral level of comfort so that large numbers now have a security that wasunknown even in the nineteenth century. The trouble is that leisure and comfortalso produce boredom, a desire for sensation, which explains why an increasingnumber of criminals have come to behave like Caligula or Gilles de Rais, and toregard their victims as ‘throwaways’. Melvin Rees, Ian Brady, Gerald Gallego,Douglas Clark, are modern examples of what might be called the ‘Roman emperorsyndrome’.As to Clark’s strange sexual perversions, we only have to read the first generaltextbook on the subject – Krafft-Ebing’s Psychopathia Sexualis, published in1886 – to see that this was just as common in the nineteenth century, and thatmany of the perversions were even more bizarre than Clark’s. It tended to be awell-kept secret, known only to a few doctors and police officers. After the‘swinging sixties’ had made pornography more generally available – particularlyhard-core videos – it was inevitable that a small number of addicts shoulddecide to experiment in rape and murder. For the sexual criminal, the mostimportant step is the one that bridges the gap between fantasy and actuality.After that, rape or murder becomes a habit. Perhaps the surprising thing is thatso few pornography addicts take that step.The sexual criminal who best illustrates this descent into violence is alsoperhaps the most notorious of modern serial killers. Theodore Bundy developedinto a Peeping Tom as a result of catching an accidental glimpse of a girlundressing through a lighted upstairs window. From then on, he began to prowlthe streets of Seattle at night, looking for bedroom windows to spy through. ‘Heapproached it almost like a project,’ according to his biographers Stephen G.Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth, ‘throwing himself into it, literally, for years’.Then, ‘like an addiction, the need for a more powerful experience was comingover him’. He made clumsy attempts to disable women’s cars, but since these wereparked in the university district, they usually found help without anydifficulty. Bundy regarded this as a kind of game, a flirtation with danger;‘but the habit grew perceptibly more insistent, just as Ted had become a bolderand bolder thief over the years’. One evening in the summer of 1973, afterdrinking heavily, Bundy saw a woman leaving a bar and walking up a dark sidestreet. He found a heavy piece of wood in a vacant lot, and stalked her. ‘Therewas really no control at this point.’ ‘The situation is novel,’ said Bundy(speaking of himself in the third person), ‘because while he may have toyedaround with fantasies before, and made several abortive attempts to act out afantasy, it never had reached the point where actually he was confronted withharming another individual.’ Nevertheless, he got ahead of the girl and lay inwait for her, but before she reached the point where he was hiding, she stoppedand went into a house. Bundy told his interviewers: ‘The revelation of theexperience and the frenzied desire that seized him really seemed to usher in anew dimension to that part of him that was obsessed with violence and women.’(Like so many other serial killers, Bundy saw himself as a dual-personality, aJekyll and Hyde; he referred to Mr Hyde as ‘the Hunchback’.) ‘What he had doneterrified him, purely terrified him. Full of remorse and remonstrating withhimself for the suicidal nature of that activity’ – Bundy also recognised murderas a form of suicide – he quickly sobered up. He was horrified by therecognition that he had the capacity to do such a thing.’Nevertheless the craving to watch girls undressing was too strong to beresisted. One night he was peering through a basement window at a girl preparingfor bed when he discovered that the door had been left open. He sneaked into herroom and leapt on her, but when she screamed, he fled. ‘Then he was seized withthe same kind of disgust and repulsion and fear and wonder at why he wasallowing himself to attempt such extraordinary violence.’ He was so upset thathe gave up his voyeuristic activities for three months; but on 4 January 1974 heagain crept into a basement after he had watched a girl undressing. He wrencheda metal bar from the bed frame and struck her repeatedly on the head. Then,apparently finding himself impotent, he rammed the bar into her vagina. The girlrecovered after a week in a coma. It took Bundy a month to recover from thetrauma of what he had done. Next time he carried his fantasy through to the end.On 31 January 1974 he entered a students’ lodging house and tried bedroom doorsuntil he found one that was unlocked. It was that of twenty-one-year-old LyndaAnn Healy. This time he seized her by the throat and ordered her to remainsilent. Then, either at knifepoint or gunpoint – it never became clear which –he forced her to dress, then bound and gagged her, and made her walk out of thehouse with him. He drove her out to Taylor Mountain, twenty miles from Seattle,then spent hours acting out his sexual fantasies. The interviewers asked himwhether there had been any conversation with his victim. ‘There’d be some. Sincethis girl in front of him represented not a person, but again the image, orsomething desirable, the last thing we would expect him to want to do would beto personalise this person.’ Finally, he bludgeoned her to death and left thebody on the mountain. Lynda Ann Healy would be the first of four girls he rapedand murdered in the same place.Perhaps the most frightening thing about Bundy’s account of himself is thedescription of how he descended into sex murder by a series of almostinfinitesimal steps. Any normal male might experience sexual excitement at acasual glimpse of a woman taking off her clothes near a lighted window. Anynormal male might return to a place where he knew he could watch a girlundressing. Any normal male might become increasingly obsessed by watching girlsundress until he had turned it into a ‘project’. At what point would the normalmale draw the line? Possibly at actually harming another human being – but then,Bundy also drew the line there, until his craving pushed him the inevitable stepfurther . . .In the months following the murder of Lynda Ann Healy, Bundy’s compulsionincreased. Four more girls – Donna Gail Manson, Susan Rancourt, Roberta Parksand Brenda Ball – were abducted, raped and murdered in the same way. On 14 July1974 he abducted two girls on the same day – Janice Ott and Denise Naslund –from Lake Sammamish Park. Both were approached by a good-looking young man withhis arm in a sling, who asked for help in lifting a boat on to the luggage rackof his car. People sitting near Janice Ott heard him introduce himself as Ted,and heard her ask him to sit down and talk for a while before she went off tohelp him. Bundy abducted her at gunpoint, took her to an empty house, and rapedher. Then he went back to the park, picked up his second victim, and took herback to the same house, raping her in front of Janice Ott. Finally he killedthem both and dumped their bodies in undergrowth a few miles away.In September 1974 Bundy moved to Salt Lake City to study law. If he wished toremain uncaught it would obviously have been sensible to stop killing girls,since if he used the same modus operandi in two places, it would be a great dealeasier to track him down. (In fact, Bundy’s name already appeared on a list ofpolice suspects – two women had named him as the possible killer – but since thelist comprised 3,500 names, he was only one of many.) But he would have beenunable to stop, even if he wanted to: the ‘hunchback’ was now in full control.So in Salt Lake City five more girls were abducted and raped between October1974 and January 1975. One girl escaped. Seventeen-year-old Carol DaRonch was ina supermarket complex on 8 November 1974 when a good-looking young manapproached her and identified himself as a detective. He told her that her carhad been broken into, and lured her into his own car – a Volkswagen – on thepretext of taking her to the police station. Then he snapped a handcuff on oneof her wrists and pointed a gun at her head. The girl grabbed for the doorhandle and fell out of the car; the man was following her, holding an iron bar,when the headlights of an oncoming car illuminated them both; Bundy leapt intohis car and drove off. Later that same evening, he abducted anotherseventeen-year-old, Debbie Kent, from a school concert, and murdered her.On a Saturday night in August 1985, a policeman in a patrol car was startledwhen a Volkswagen pulled out from the pavement and drove off at top speed. Thepoliceman followed and finally made the car pull over. Its driver was Ted Bundy,and handcuffs and burgling tools were found in the trunk. By now, the crimecomputer in Seattle had reduced the list of suspects to ten, and Bundy’s namewas at number seven. When Salt Lake City police realised that Bundy was fromSeattle, they made him stand in a line-up in the Hall of Justice. Carol DaRonchand two other witnesses identified him as the abductor of 8 November. On 27December 1976 Bundy was found guilty of aggravated kidnapping and sentenced tobetween one and fifteen years in prison.By now police were also gathering evidence to link him with the disappearance ofa twenty-three-year-old nurse, Caryn Campbell, from a holiday hotel in Colorado.In January Bundy escaped from the Colorado courthouse, but was recaptured withindays. The following December he escaped again by unscrewing a light fitment, andthis time succeeded in making his way to Tallahassee, Florida, where he rented aroom in a student hostel. Now, with everything to lose, he was still unable toresist the compulsion to murder. On the night of 15 January 1978 he entered astudent rooming house on the university campus and attacked four girls in quicksuccession with a wooden club. One was strangled with her tights and raped;another died on her way to hospital; the other two were to recover. An hour anda half later, still unsatisfied, he broke into another rooming house and clubbedanother girl unconscious; he was disturbed by the girl’s next-door neighbour,and fled. Bundy returned to the anonymity of his student rooming house, where hewas known as Chris Hagen.A month later, on 9 February 1978, he abducted a twelve-year-old schoolgirl,Kimberley Leach, from the Lake City Junior High School; she was his youngestvictim. Her body was found two months later in an abandoned shack. By this time,Bundy had been arrested – again by a policeman in a patrol car who was puzzledby his erratic driving.At his trial in Florida, Bundy maintained his innocence, insisting that it waspure coincidence that he had been in the areas where sixteen girls had beenraped and murdered. Teeth marks on the buttocks of one of his victims weredemonstrated by a dental expert to be Bundy’s own, and he was found guilty andsentenced to death. (Bundy had insisted on conducting his own defence, andrejecting the plea-bargaining that might have saved his life.) Before hiselectrocution on 24 January 1989, he had confessed to another seven murders,bringing the total to twenty-three, and was obviously prepared to confess tomore when time ran out. Police remain convinced that the total could amount toas many as forty.Bundy differs from most serial killers in one basic respect: his childhood wasapparently normal and happy. Nevertheless, his background was far from ‘normal’.Theodore Robert Bundy was an illegitimate child, born in November 1946 to arespectable and religious young secretary, Louise Cowell, in a home forunmarried mothers in Philadelphia; his mother has always refused to disclose thefather’s identity. The child was left alone for several weeks before being takento the home of his grandfather, a market gardener, and that initial periodwithout parental affection may account for his later inability to form closerelationships. His grandfather was a despotic and violent man who often beat uphis wife, although he doted on the baby (who was explained to neighbours as anadopted child). When his mother decided to move to Tacoma (Washington state)when the baby was four, Ted was miserable at losing the only ‘father’ he hadever known. Louise Cowell married an ex-navy cook, John Bundy, but the childnever formed any close relationship with his stepfather, finding him boring anduncultured.As a schoolboy Bundy was an incorrigible fantasist, daydreaming of being adoptedby the cowboy star Roy Rogers, and trying, at one point, to persuade his motherto allow him to be adopted by an uncle who was a professor of music. He soonbecame a thief and habitual liar. He also became an excellent skier, but he hadstolen much of the equipment on which he learned. He experienced a basic driveto ‘be somebody’, to be famous, but a streak of self-pity, the feeling that theworld was against him, prevented him from making the kind of effort that mighthave led to success.Although good-looking, the young Bundy was also shy and introverted – it was notuntil his early twenties that he lost his virginity while sleeping off a drunkenevening on a friend’s settee, when the lady of the house came and ‘raped’ him.The ultimate key to Bundy – and probably to the majority of serial killers – isobviously his immensely powerful sex drive. From an early age he was acompulsive masturbator; he fantasised about necrophilia, and later became adevotee of hard porn. His long-term girlfriend told how he liked to tie her upwith stockings before sex; but such acts could not satisfy his desire – likesome legendary caliph – for sexual variety and for total control of his partner.He later admitted that he often strangled the victim during the sexual act;vaginas were stuffed with twigs and dirt and one victim was sodomised with anaerosol can.Perhaps the most important single factor in turning Bundy into a serial killerwas a relationship with a fellow student named Stephanie Brooks. Bundy fell inlove with her in his late teens; she was beautiful, sophisticated and came of awealthy family. To impress her he went to Stanford University to study Chinese;but he was lonely, emotionally immature, and his grades were poor. ‘I foundmyself thinking of standards of success that I didn’t seem to be living up to.’Stephanie wearied of his immaturity and dropped him. He was shattered and deeplyresentful. His brother later commented: ‘Stephanie screwed him up . . . I’dnever seen him like this before.’ One consequence of the emotional upset wasthat Bundy returned to thieving on a regular basis; he began shoplifting andstealing for ‘thrills’. On one occasion he even stole a large potted plant fromsomeone’s garden, and drove off with it sticking through the open roof of hiscar.He formed a relationship with a young divorcee, Meg Anders, and became afull-time volunteer for the black republican candidate for governor. He alsofound a job working for the Crime Commission and Department of Justice Planning– other males in the office envied his confidence, charm and good looks. WhenStephanie Brooks met him again seven years after dropping him, she was soimpressed by the new and high-powered Ted that she agreed to marry him – theyspent Christmas of 1973 together. Bundy’s object, however, was not to win herback but to get his revenge for the earlier humiliation. When, in the new year,she rang him to ask why he had not contacted her since their weekend together,he said coldly: ‘I have no idea what you’re talking about,’ and hung up on her.Then, as if his ‘revenge’ had somehow broken an inner dam and inspired him witha sense of ruthless power and confidence, he committed his first murder.The vital clue to Bundy lies in a comment made by his friend Ann Rule, a Seattlejournalist, in her book The Stranger Beside Me. She remarks that he becameviolently upset if he telephoned Meg Anders – his long-time girlfriend inSeattle – from Salt Lake City, and got no reply. ‘Strangely, while he was beingcontinually unfaithful himself, he expected – demanded – that she be totallyloyal to him.’ This is one of the basic characteristics of a type of person whohas been labelled ‘the Right Man’ or ‘the Violent Man’.The insight came to the science-fiction writer A.E. van Vogt in 1954, when hewas preparing to write a novel about a Chinese prison camp run by anauthoritarian dictator figure. It struck van Vogt that what dictators seem tohave in common is a total and irrational conviction of their own ‘rightness’,and of the stupidity and wrong-headedness of anyone who opposes them. It is, infact, the ‘Roman emperor’ syndrome noted at the beginning of this chapter. Allchildren regard themselves as the centre of the universe; but if they maintainthis attitude beyond early childhood, we regard them as thoroughly obnoxious.Emperors like Caligula and Nero maintained the attitude into adulthood – becauseno-one had the courage to gainsay them – and their cruelties were less theresult of sadism than of total self-centredness.The ‘Roman emperor’ syndrome arises out of the natural need of all human beingsfor some degree of self-esteem and self-confidence. Self-confidence means theability to stick to our own aims and beliefs in the face of opposition. It is asnecessary to nursery schoolchildren as to millionaire businessmen. Once most ofus have established what we regard as a comfortable degree of self-confidence –that is, adequate to our everyday needs – we turn our attention to othermatters: schoolwork, making a living, etc. For various reasons, some people failto achieve this ‘comfortable’ level, perhaps because some early trauma haspermanently undermined them, perhaps because they are surrounded by people whoserespect they totally fail to win. Low-dominance people are inclined to accepttheir rather poor self-image; high-dominance people may develop a lifelongcraving for the respect of others.Again, some of these people may develop into ‘achievers’ – even such dubiousachievers as Hitler and Stalin. Others may simply become remarkable for the sizeof their egos. Others become boasters and liars. Van Vogt noted that a certainpercentage of these people achieve a sense of security in a peculiar manner:they marry, produce a family, and then behave exactly like a dictator, treatingtheir wife and children as their subjects. Not even the slightest hint ofcontradiction is allowed. The personality of such a man (or woman) is totallynon-flexible. In no circumstances will he ever admit that he is in the wrong, orhas made a mistake. If evidence that he is in the wrong is placed so firmlyunder his nose that he can no longer ignore it, he is likely to explode intoviolence. This is why van Vogt christened him ‘the Violent Man’ or ‘the RightMan’.Van Vogt began by studying newspaper accounts of divorce proceedings, and notinghow often husbands could treat their wives – and children – with appallingirrationality, flying into a rage at the least sign of opposition, and yetexpecting to be allowed to do exactly as they liked. One such man, a commercialtraveller, had an endless series of affairs (these being an important prop tohis self-esteem), yet would knock his wife down if she so much as smiled atanother man. Oddly enough, most such men seem to their colleagues at work to beperfectly normal; the Right Man never tries to indulge his power fantasies withhis superiors or equals.He is, of course, living in a kind of sand castle, and it can be destroyed ifhis wife has the courage to kick it down – that is, to leave him. Van Vogt notedthat in such cases – when the ‘worm turned’ – the husband would often experiencetotal psychological collapse, sometimes resulting in suicide. His security isbuilt upon a fabric of self-delusion, and he has become skilled in refusing toface this fact. If it is no longer possible to avoid facing it, he feels thatthe foundation of his life has been swept away.Bundy was good-looking and intelligent; but he was a late developer, and earlyfrustrations and disappointments seem to have convinced him that he was a‘loser’. This may be deduced from his compulsive thieving – potential ‘winners’are too concerned with their future to risk being labelled a criminal. Bundy’sstealing became a compulsion after Stephanie Brooks had ‘dumped’ him; itobviously contained mildly suicidal elements, the feeling that ‘Nothing mattersany more’. In spite of his intelligence he was a poor student, and his gradeswere usually Bs. The tide began to turn when he worked for the JusticeDepartment and the Republican candidate, but by that time he was already acompulsive Peeping Tom. ‘Revenge’ on Stephanie Brooks also came too late; itonly served to rationalise his feeling that all women were bitches and deservedto be raped. The Right Man can justify any action that he wants to take, nomatter how immoral. Most of the cases van Vogt observed involved Right Men‘cheating’ compulsively on their wives. Bundy went several steps further andbecame a compulsive rapist and killer as he had become a compulsive thief.As soon as we understand this curious mechanism of self-deception, we can seethat it seems to apply to most serial killers. Angelo Buono was another ‘RightMan’, a man who was capable of sodomising his wife in front of the children to‘teach her a lesson’. When one of his prostitutes ran away, it was the kind of‘desertion’ that all Right Men fear. When his threatening phone calls led tohumiliation at the hands of an outsize Hell’s Angel, all his outragedself-esteem became directed – with typical irrationality – against women.Murdering women and dumping them like trash on hillsides restored his machoself-image. There was no reason to chant ‘Die, cunt, die’ as he sat on LissaKastin’s legs and watched Bianchi strangling her; she had never done anything tomerit his hatred. But the Right Man was murdering and humiliating all women.Similarly, the Right Man syndrome can be seen to be the key to Cameron Hooker,Melvin Rees, Harvey Carignan, Gary Heidnik, Gerald Gallego, David Birnie,Douglas Clark and Ian Brady. Heidnik’s collapse into insanity when his Filipinowife walked out on him is typical of the Violent Man. So is HeinrichPommerencke’s sudden decision that all women deserved to die. The same appliesto cases of folie à deux, like the Moors Murder case. For Ian Brady, MyraHindley was the equivalent of the Right Man’s family – a kind of little dictatorstate, which enables him to indulge his power fantasies. When the sense ofpower-starvation is so overwhelming, the appetite increases with feeding, thestarved ego swells like a balloon.It should now be clear that the Right Man syndrome is a form of mild insanity,allied to that of a madman who believes he is Napoleon. It cannot be describedas true insanity because it does not involve psychotic delusions. (Fish, forexample, was not a Right Man; he was genuinely insane.) Gary Heidnik occupies ablurred space between the Right Man syndrome and genuine psychosis; it is almostimpossible to say how far he was insane, and how far he was merely sufferingfrom the Right Man’s delusions of power and grandeur. The Right Man syndrome, inits most primitive form, is simply a desire to behave like a spoilt child, topunish those who refuse to do what the child demands. Robert Hansen and DouglasClark are examples of this stage: they only killed girls who failed to bringthem to orgasm.It is easy to understand the development of the syndrome. There is nobody in theworld who does not want ‘his own way’. Most of us learn to make realisticadjustments to not getting our own way. This is obviously easier for someonewhose life is fairly stable. Children with serious problems – difficult parents,broken homes, traumatic frustrations – tend to react to disappointments with anout-of-proportion sense of misery and defeat. They compensate by fantasy, andperhaps (like Bundy) by lying and stealing. These reactions have an identicalroot; both are attempts to take what the world refuses to give freely. If this‘naughty boy’ aspect goes unpunished (as with Bundy) it can develop into a kindof self-indulgence that strikes us as insane, but which is actually a calculatedand conscious form of wickedness.This type of serial killer is epitomised by Dean Corll, the homosexual massmurderer of the 1970s. Corll, like most serial killers, had a difficultchildhood, with a father ‘who did not like children’, and the parents eventuallydivorced. Meanwhile, Dean (born 1939) had become a mother’s boy. His motherstarted a candy company which was to provide her sons with a living. In 1968, onthe advice of a psychic, she moved away from Houson, and left Dean, who was thenin his late twenties, on his own. Life was easy; he smoked pot, sniffed glue –although he had a heart condition – and made advances to young boys. When heturned thirty, he became thin-skinned and secretive about his age. His formerfriends noticed that he became moody; he preferred the companionship of a numberof teenage juvenile delinquents. These included Elmer Wayne Henley, a child of abroken home, and David Brooks. The latter, a convicted thief and something of asadist, had on one occasion been knocked unconscious by Corll, tied to a bed,and repeatedly sodomised; nevertheless, he and Corll remained friends. He hadintroduced Henley to Corll. With the aid of his two friends, Corll began luringteenage boys to the house, then raping and killing them, often after variousforms of torture, such as biting the genitals.The first killing took place in 1970, when Corll murdered a hitchhiking studentnamed Jeffrey Konen. Most of the other victims came from the run-down Heightsarea of Houston. Corll’s usual method was to wait until they were unconsciousfrom glue-sniffing, then to chain them to a board and sodomise them, sometimesfor days, before strangling them with a rope. In December 1970 he murdered twoboys – James Glass, fourteen, and Danny Yates, fifteen – at the same time. Twobrothers – Donald and Jerry Waldrop – were killed in January 1971. Between 1970and 1973, Corll murdered twenty-nine boys, with the aid of Brooks and Henley.(Brooks seemed to enjoy causing pain, and on one occasion, shot a boy afterinserting the barrel of the revolver up his nose.) Most of the bodies wereburied in a rented boatshed, wrapped in plastic sheeting. The youngest victimwas a nine-year-old boy who lived in a shop opposite Corll’s apartment.The end came on the morning of 8 August 1973. Henley had arrived at aglue-sniffing party with another youth and a fifteen-year-old girl. Corll wasfurious about the girl – ‘You’ve spoilt it all’ – and Henley woke up to findhimself tied and handcuffed, and the vindictive Corll standing over him with agun. ‘I’ll teach you a lesson.’ Finally, by offering to help rape and torturethe other two, Henley succeeded in persuading Corll to release him. The twosemiconscious teenagers were then undressed and chained up. Henley tried to rapethe girl, but failed. Corll was in the process of raping the youth when Henleysaid: ‘Why don’t you let me take the chick outa here? She don’t want to seethat.’ When Corll ignored him, Henley grabbed the gun and ordered him to stop;Corll taunted him: ‘Go on, kill me.’ Henley fired repeatedly, and Corllcollapsed. Henley then rang the police and informed them: ‘I’ve just killed aman.’ When the police arrived, Henley told them the story of the attempted rapesand the shooting, and added that Corll had boasted of having killed other boysand burying them in a boatshed. In the boatshed in south Houston, policeuncovered seventeen bodies, then Henley led them to sites where another ten wereburied. Henley’s estimate was that Corll had murdered thirty-one boys.Henley’s knowledge of the burial sites made it clear that he was not as innocentas he pretended; eventually, both he and David Brooks were sentenced to lifeimprisonment.One of the most widely published photographs of Corll, as an adult, shows himclutching a teddy bear. Jack Olsen’s book on the case, The Man With the Candy,makes it clear that Corll never grew up. The murders were simply the expressionof a kind of ‘spoiltness’, a desire to have his own way.The same also seems to be true of another widely publicised case of mass murderin the 1970s. Between 1976 and his arrest in December 1978, John Wayne Gacy, aChicago building contractor, killed thirty-two boys in the course of sexualattacks. Gacy’s childhood – he was born in 1932 – was in many ways similar toCorll’s, with a harsh father and a protective mother. He was a lifelong pettythief. Like Corll, he also suffered from a heart condition. In childhood, he hadbeen struck on the head by a swing, which caused a bloodclot on the brain,undetected for several years. He married a girl whose parents owned afried-chicken business in Waterloo, Iowa, and – again like Corll – became asuccessful businessman. (Maslow would point out that this indicates that bothbelong to the ‘dominant five per cent’.) He was also known as a liar and aboaster. His marriage came to an end when Gacy was imprisoned for sexuallymolesting a teenager (although Gacy always claimed he had been framed). Out ofjail, he married a second time and set up in business as a building contractor.He was successful (although notoriously mean), and was soon regarded as a pillarof the local community – he was even photographed shaking hands with First LadyRosalynn Carter, the wife of President Jimmy Carter. His own wife found hisviolent tempers a strain, and they divorced.In 1975, while he was still married, one of his teenage employees vanished; itwas after this that his wife noticed an unpleasant smell in the house. Aftertheir separation in the following year, Gacy made a habit of picking up teenagehomosexuals, or luring teenagers to his house ‘on business’. handcuffing them,and then committing sodomy. They were finally strangled, and the bodies disposedof, usually in the crawl space under the house.In March 1978, a twenty-seven-year-old named Jeffrey Rignall accepted aninvitation to smoke pot in Gacy’s Oldsmobile. Gacy clapped a chloroform-soakedrag over his face, and when Rignall woke up he was being sodomised in Gacy’shome. Gacy raped him repeatedly and flogged him with a whip; finally, hechloroformed him again and left him in a park. In hospital, Rignall discoveredthat he had sustained permanent liver damage from the chloroform. Since thepolice were unable to help, he set about trying to track down the rapisthimself, sitting near freeway entrances looking for black Oldsmobiles.Eventually he saw Gacy, followed him, and noted down his number. Although Gacywas arrested, the evidence against him seemed poor.On 11 December 1978 Gacy invited a fifteen-year-old boy, Robert Piest, to hishouse to talk about a summer job. When the youth failed to return, policetracked down the building contractor who had offered him the job, and questionedhim at his home in Des Plaines. Alerted by the odour, they investigated thecrawl space and found fifteen bodies and parts of others. When Gacy had run outof space, he had started dumping bodies in the river.Gacy’s story was that he was a ‘dissociated’ personality, and that the murderswere committed by an evil part of himself called Jack. In court, one youthdescribed how Gacy had pulled him up, posing as a police officer, thenhandcuffed him at gunpoint. Back in Gacy’s home, he was sodomised, after whichGacy made an attempt to drown him in the bath; but Gacy changed his mind andraped him again. Then, after holding his head under water until he becameunconscious, Gary urinated on him, then played Russian roulette with a gun whichturned out to contain only a blank. Finally, Gacy released him, warning him thatthe police would not believe his story. Gacy proved to be right. The jury whotried him believed a psychiatrist who told them that Gacy was suffering from anarcissistic personality disorder that did not amount to insanity, and on 13March 1980 John Wayne Gacy was sentenced to life imprisonment.In cases like these, it seems clear that the answer should not be sought inpsychological diagnoses so much as in weakness and self-indulgence. AlthoughGacy’s biographer Tim Cahill tries hard to make a case for Gacy as adoom-haunted necrophile (he once worked in a morgue), the psychological evidenceshows that both he and Corll were childish and undisciplined personalities inthe grip of total selfishness.The same probably applies to the only British example of a homosexual serialkiller, Dennis Nilsen. Between December 1978 and February 1983, Nilsen murderedfifteen young men whom he had lured to his flat in north London, and got rid ofthe bodies by dissecting them, boiling the pieces, and disposing of them invarious ways – even leaving them in plastic bags for the dustbin men to collect.On 8 February 1983 a drains maintenance engineer called at a house in MuswellHill to examine a blocked drain; he found that it contained decaying flesh thatlooked human. When Dennis Nilsen, a thirty-seven-year-old employment officer,returned home, he was questioned by the police, and immediately pointed to awardrobe; inside were two plastic bags containing two severed heads and a skull.Nilsen insisted that there was no sexual motive in the crimes, but this is hardto believe. The son of a drunken father and a puritanical mother, he had thekind of lonely childhood that seems typical of serial killers. His troublesbegan, according to Nilsen, when he was seven years old, and was taken by hismother to see the corpse of his grandfather – to whom he had been deeplyattached. A necrophiliac obsession began to develop. After twelve years as anarmy cook, and a period in London as a policeman and security guard, he obtainedwork in a job centre in Soho and began living with a man. It was after this manleft in 1977 that Nilsen began to invite young males – picked up in pubs – backto his flat, get them drunk, then strangle them.Nilsen’s biographer Brian Masters accepted Nilsen’s curious explanation that hewas killing out of loneliness – the book is entitled Killing for Company – andthat having a corpse around the flat gave him a sense of companionship; butsince Nilsen admitted that he was a necrophile, this explanation is hard toaccept. What is quite clear from Masters’ book is that Nilsen was a man of highdominance; Masters went to see him in prison and reported that Nilsen behaved asif interviewing him for a job. One of his acquaintances reported: ‘The onlyoff-putting thing about him was his eyes. They can stare you out, and not manypeople can stare me out.’ Others found his immense loquacity tiresome; Nilsenregarded himself as an intellectual, and had a high opinion of himself. Thisseems to be the most probable explanation of why he turned to murder. When theman with whom he was living, David Gallichan, announced that he was leaving – hehad been offered a job in the country – he was surprised when Nilsen’s reactionwas a cold and highly controlled rage. ‘It was as though I had insulted him, andhe wanted me to go immediately.’ This is, of course, the reaction of a Right Manon being abandoned by someone whom he has been accustomed to dominate; the wholefoundation of his insecure self-esteem is shaken. This may also explain why,since his arrest and life imprisonment, Nilsen seems to have taken a certainpride in being ‘Britain’s biggest mass murderer’.One final important fact must be taken into account: that Nilsen, like TedBundy, was an extremely heavy drinker. He met his victims in pubs, then broughtthem back home to consume large quantities of vodka. Alcohol had the same effecton Nilsen and Bundy that drugs had on Dean Corll and on the Manson clan,creating a sense of unreality, a kind of moral vacuum without inhibitions. Inthis vacuum, murder meant very little.Perhaps the most basic characteristic of the serial killer is one that he shareswith most other criminals: a tendency to an irrational self-pity that canproduce an explosion of violence. In that sense, Paul John Knowles may beregarded not merely as the archetypal serial killer but as the archetypalcriminal.Knowles, who was born in 1946, had spent an average of six months of every yearin jail since he was nineteen, mostly for car thefts and burglaries. InFlorida’s Raiford Penitentiary in 1972 he began to study astrology, and startedcorresponding with a divorcee named Angela Covic, whom he had contacted throughan astrology magazine. She flew to Florida, was impressed by the gaunt goodlooks of the tall red-headed convict, and agreed to marry him. She hired alawyer to work on his parole, and when he was released on 14 May 1972, Knowleshastened to San Francisco to claim his bride. She soon had second thoughts; apsychic had told her that she was mixed up with a very dangerous man. Knowlesstayed at her mother’s apartment, but after four days Angela Covic told him shehad decided to return to her husband, and gave him his air ticket back toFlorida. We have seen that, when the Violent Man is rejected by a woman, theresult is an explosion of rage and self-pity that contains a suicidal component.Knowles conformed to type; he later claimed that he went out on to the streetsof San Francisco and killed three people at random.Back in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida, on 26 July 1974 Knowles got intoa fight in a bar and was locked up for the night. He escaped, broke into thehome of a sixty-five-year-old teacher, Alice Curtis, and stole her money and hercar. He rammed a gag too far down her throat and she suffocated. A few dayslater, as he parked the stolen car, he noticed two children looking at him as ifthey recognised him – their mother was, in fact, a friend of his family. Heforced them into the car and drove away. The bodies of seven-year-old MyletteAnderson and her eleven-year-old sister Lillian were later found in a swamp.What followed was a totally unmotivated murder rampage, as if Knowles had simplydecided to kill as many people as he could before he was caught. The followingday, 2 August 1974, in Atlantic Beach, Florida, he broke into the home ofMarjorie Howie, forty-nine, and strangled her with a stocking; he stole hertelevision set. A few days later he strangled and raped a teenage runaway whohitched a lift with him. On 23 August he strangled Kathie Pierce in Musella,Georgia, while her three-year-old son looked on; Knowles left the childunharmed. On 3 September near Lima, Ohio, he had several drinks with an accountsexecutive named William Bates, and later strangled him, driving off in the deadman’s white Impala. After driving to California, Seattle and Utah (using Bates’scredit cards) he forced his way into a caravan in Ely, Nevada, on 18 September1974, and shot to death an elderly couple, Emmett and Lois Johnson. On 21September he strangled and raped forty-two-year-old Mrs Charlynn Hicks, who hadstopped to admire the view beside the road near Sequin, Texas. On 23 September,in Birmingham, Alabama, he met an attractive woman named Ann Dawson, who owned abeauty shop, and they travelled around together for the next six days, livingoff her money; she was murdered on 29 September. For the next sixteen days hedrove around without apparently committing any further murders; but on 16October he rang the doorbell of a house in Marlborough, Connecticut; it wasanswered by sixteen-year-old Dawn White, who was expecting a friend. Knowlesforced her up to the bedroom and raped her; when her mother, Karen White,returned home, he raped her too, then strangled them both with silk stockings,leaving with a tape recorder and Dawn White’s collection of rock records. Twodays later, he knocked on the door of fifty-three year old Doris Hovey inWoodford, Virginia, and told her he needed a gun and would not harm her; shegave him a rifle belonging to her husband, and he shot her through the head andleft, leaving the rifle beside her body.In Key West, Florida, he picked up two hitchhikers, intending to kill them, butwas stopped by a policeman for pulling up on a kerb; when the policeman asked tosee his documents, Knowles expected to be arrested; but the officer failed tocheck that he was the owner of the car, and let him drive away.On 2 November Knowles picked up two hitchhikers, Edward Hilliard and DebbieGriffin; Hilliard’s body was later discovered in woods near Macon, Georgia; thegirl’s body was never found.On 6 November, in a gay bar in Macon, he met a man named Carswell Carr and wenthome with him. Later that evening, Carr’s fifteen-year-old daughter Mandy heardshouting and went downstairs, to find Knowles standing over the body of herfather, who was tied up. It emerged later that Carr had died of a heart attack;Knowles had been torturing him by stabbing him all over with a pair of scissors.He then raped Mandy Carr – or attempted it (no sperm was found in the vagina)and strangled her with a stocking. The bodies were found when Carr’s wife, anight nurse, returned home.The following day, in a Holiday Inn in downtown Atlanta, Knowles saw anattractive redhead in the bar – a British journalist named Sandy Fawkes. Shewent for a meal with him and they ended up in her bedroom, but he provedimpotent, in spite of all her efforts. He had introduced himself to her as DarylGolden, son of a New Mexico restaurant owner, and the two of them got on wellenough for her to accept his offer to drive her to Miami. On the way there, hehinted that he was on the run for some serious crime – or crimes – and told herthat he had a premonition that he was going to be killed some time soon. He alsotold her that he had tape-recorded his confession, and left it with his lawyerin Miami, Sheldon Yavitz. In another motel, he finally succeeded in enteringher, after first practising cunnilingus and masturbating himself into a state ofexcitement. Even so, he failed to achieve orgasm; she concluded that he wasincapable of it.Long before they separated – after a mere six days together – she was anxious toget rid of him. She had sensed the underlying violence, self-pity, lack ofdiscipline. He pressed hard for another night together; she firmly refused,insisting that it would only make the parting more difficult. He waited outsideher Miami motel half the night, while she deliberately stayed away; finally, hegave up and left.The following day, she was asked to go to the police station, and there for thefirst time realised what kind of a man she had been travelling with. On themorning after their separation ‘Daryl Golden’ had driven to the house of somejournalists to whom he had been introduced four days earlier, and offered todrive Susan Mackenzie to the hairdresser. Instead, he took the wrong turning,and told her that he wanted to have sex with her, and would not hurt her if shecomplied. When he stopped the car and pointed a gun at her, she succeeded injumping out and waved frantically at a passing car. Knowles drove off. Later,alerted to the attempted rape, a squad car tried to stop Knowles, but he pointeda shotgun at the policeman and drove off.Knowles knew that he had to get rid of the stolen car. In West Palm Beach, heforced his way into a house, and took a girl named Barbara Tucker hostage,driving off in her Volkswagen, leaving her sister (in a wheelchair) andsix-year-old child unharmed. He held Barbara Tucker captive in a motel in FortPierce for a night and day, then finally left her tied up and drove off in hercar.The following day, Patrolman Charles F. Campbell flagged down the Volkswagen –now with altered licence plates – and found himself looking down the barrel of ashotgun. He was taken captive and driven off, handcuffed, in his own patrol car.The brakes were poor so, using the police siren, Knowles forced another car –driven by businessman John Meyer – off the road, then drove off in Meyer’s car,with Meyer and the patrolman in the back. In Pulaski County, Georgia, Knowlestook them into a wood, handcuffed them to a tree, and shot both in the back ofthe head.Soon after, he saw a police roadblock ahead, and drove on through it, losingcontrol and crashing into a tree. He ran into the woods, and a vast manhuntbegan, involving two hundred police, tracker dogs and helicopters. In fact,Knowles was arrested by a courageous civilian, who saw him from a house, and hegave himself up quietly.The day after his appearance in court, as he was being transferred to amaximum-security prison, Knowles unpicked his handcuffs and made a grab for thesheriff’s gun; FBI agent Ron Angel shot him dead. Knowles had been responsiblefor at least eighteen murders, possibly as many as twenty-four.Sandy Fawkes had seen Knowles in court, and was overwhelmed by a sense of his‘evil power’. She had no doubt that he now had what he had always wanted: he wasfamous at last. ‘And enjoying his notoriety. The papers were filled withpictures of his appearance at Midgeville and accounts of his behaviour. Thestreets had been lined with people. Sightseers had hung over the sides ofbalconies to catch a glimpse of Knowles, manacled and in leg irons, dressed in abrilliant orange jumpsuit. He had loved it: the local co-eds four-deep on thesidewalks, the courtroom packed with reporters, friends, Mandy’s school chumsand relatives of the Carr family. It was an event, he was the centre of it andhe smiled at everyone. No wonder he had laughed like a hyena at his capture; hewas having his hour of glory, not in the hereafter as he had predicted, but inthe here-and-now. The daily stories of the women in his life had turned him intoa Casanova killer, a folk villain, Dillinger and Jesse James rolled into one. Hewas already being referred to as the most heinous killer in history.’So at last Knowles had achieved the aim of most serial killers: ‘to becomeknown.’ He was quoted in a local newspaper as saying that he was ‘the onlysuccessful member of his family’.Yet the central mystery remains, the mystery with which we are confronted againand again in dealing with serial killers. Sandy Fawkes describes him as charmingand intelligent. She also describes how, as they watched a group of picnickers,with a man swinging his small child around, he watched with a ‘tender smile’.‘He seemed to be so ordinary and yet so lost, as if he knew that scene wouldnever be his, he could not join, would always be separate.’ When she asked himif he had many friends he replied: ‘I find it difficult to get close to manypeople,’ and she adds: ‘The impression was one of rejection, a history offailure to relate.’ Their curious sexual relations seem to illustrate the samepoint – his need to masturbate before he could generate the excitement toachieve penetration.The odd thing that emerges from her book Killing Time is that, in many ways,Knowles was obviously a normal, decent human being, capable of playing his roleas a ‘social animal’ rather better than most people. Yet the man who killed twosmall children because he thought they had recognised him, who shot so manyother people without compunction, was – in the precise sense of the word – awild animal rather than a human being, a creature like a tiger or a mad dog.What could cause such a transformation? Most of us can instinctively understandit, but it is difficult to capture in words. Like so many other criminals, hewas trapped in a sense of being unlucky, but then, so are a vast number of humanbeings who never break the law. We know nothing of what made Knowles into thekind of person, although the reason obviously lies in his family background. (Hetold Sandy Fawkes that he disliked his father.) What we can sense is that hesomehow exaggerated his problems, his ‘failure to relate’. When he went to SanFrancisco from prison in Florida, he was hoping to become ‘normal’. Rejection bythe woman he had hoped to marry produced the response that ‘rejection’ alwayscauses in Right Men: a kind of suicidal violence. He went on a rampage ofmurder, like a naughty child who tries to make his parents feel sorry forpunishing him. His own high dominance also made him capable of raping andmurdering women without guilt or regret: the high-dominance male can generatelittle personal feeling for medium- or low-dominance females – they are merelyobjects to be used. Sandy Fawkes was different, a female within his owndominance group with whom he could have formed a permanent relationship, but,like his bride-to-be in San Francisco, she also sensed his lack of discipline,the low bursting-point that would have made him a liability as a husband. It wasafter he felt that she had also rejected him that he reverted to his old habitof violence; the attempt to rape Susan Mackenzie was probably an attempt to makeher ‘feel sorry’ for her rejection.Here once again, we feel instinctively that it was all somehow pointless, thatKnowles was acting on unnecessarily pessimistic assumptions. The judge whosentenced Ted Bundy to death evidently felt the same. ‘Take care of yourself,young man. I say that to you sincerely. It’s a tragedy to this court to see sucha total waste of humanity. You’re a bright young man. You’d have made a goodlawyer. I’d have loved to have you practise in front of me. I bear you noanimosity, believe me. You went the wrong way, partner. Take care of yourself.’This was a recognition that, as a high-dominance male, Bundy might have beencapable of considerable achievement. Bundy’s downfall was his sexual obsession,the craving to prove his ‘superiority’ by using and discarding women likecigarettes. Knowles was not primarily concerned with sex, but – like CarlPanzram – with ‘getting his own back’ on society. But as Joyce Cary’s GulleyJimson once remarked, ‘You never get your own back – it’s always moved on.’In speaking of the Right Man, Van Vogt used the interesting phrase: ‘He makesthe decision to be out of control.’ Our first response to this is the feelingthat he has phrased it badly; surely he means ‘the decision to lose control’ or‘to go out of control’. But Van Vogt is making an important point. Knowles’sdecision was not simply to lose control. He recognises that control, discipline,constructive effort, amounts to a state of being, and he make a conscious choiceof the opposite state. He decides to have a low bursting-point.Such a decision is not only irrational; it is self-destructive. Once they canactually see the negative consequences of their conduct, ‘mad dog’ killers likePanzram and Knowles are intelligent enough to recognise this. By that time it istoo late.‘Realise that most Right Men deserve some sympathy,’ says van Vogt, ‘for theyare struggling with an almost unbelievable inner horror.’ At first sight, thisis perhaps the strangest remark in van Vogt’s account of the Violent Man.‘Unbelievable inner horror.’ Is he not overstating the case?To realise why this is not so, we need to understand that members of the‘dominant five per cent’ need success as much as they need food and drink. It isdifficult to imagine anything more frustrating than a dominant male (or female)stuck in a position that allows absolutely no expression of that dominance. Afew people of this type ‘sublimate’ their dominance into creativity, and becomewriters or artists or musicians; they may even achieve the success they crave inthis way. Many simply remain frustrated and develop ulcers. A certain percentageretreat into a kind of fantasy world in which they are anonymous geniuses orheroes, men whose greatnessis simply not recognised by their fellows. Van Vogtcomments that such men are ‘idealists’, meaning that they live in their ownmental world and prefer to ignore aspects of reality that conflict with it. Whenreality administers hard knocks, they go through a crisis of self-justification,and usually end up more certain than ever that they are right and the world iswrong. Typical of this strange, lonely fantasy was the card displayed in the cabof the Yorkshire Ripper: ‘In this truck is a man whose latent genius, ifunleashed, would rock the nation, whose dynamic energy would overpower thosearound him. Better let him sleep.’ In fact, Peter Sutcliffe had been a shy,lonely child who had developed into a shy, lonely adult. It is also typical thatSutcliffe’s violent attacks began after he suspected that his future wife wasbeing unfaithful to him; the superman fantasy was being undermined, and he hadto do something about it before it collapsed and buried him in its ruins. Yet,as van Vogt goes on to observe: ‘If they give way to the impulse to hit orchoke, they are losing the battle, and are on the way to the ultimatedisaster . . . of their subjective universe of self-justification.’ He was, ofcourse, thinking about the ‘normal’ Right Man, not the Right Man who hassurrendered completely to the urge to hit or choke, and become a serial killer.What happens to such men? We have seen that the first stage is that they becomesubject to the ‘Jekyll and Hyde syndrome’, where the sane and non-violent partstruggles against the ‘hunchback’. Like Bundy, they may be horrified by whatthey have done and swear never to do it again; but the hunchback has becomestronger through being indulged, and they are soon using their talent forself-justification to excuse murder: life is cruel, the law of existence issurvival of the fittest, society is rotten and deserves what it gets . . .As soon as we become aware of the ‘Right Man pattern’, we can see it again andagain in cases of serial killers, even those who, at first sight, seem to bebasically motivated by sex. In April 1980 a Colombian man was arrested inAmbato, Ecuador, when he tried to abduct an eleven-year-old Indian girl from themarket place. A few days earlier, the rain-swollen river had overflowed itsbanks and revealed the bodies of four missing girls; ever since then, police hadbeen looking for a multiple sex killer. The prisoner, thirty-one-year-old PedroAlonzo Lopez, denied that he had anything to do with the murders. A pastor whoposed as a fellow prisoner finally extracted a confession; soon, Lopez had toldpolice that he had killed about three hundred and sixty girls, and was leadingthem to some of the burial sites.Lopez later told the story of his life to American journalist Ron Laytner. Theseventh son of a prostitute in Tolima, Colombia – with twelve brothers andsisters – he was thrown out of the house by his mother at the age of eight forsexually fondling one of his sisters. Kindly neighbours took him in, but thenext day his mother took him to the edge of town and left him. He took a day tofind his way home, laughing at his success. The next day his mother took him ona bus to another town and left him there. That night, a man found the cryingchild and promised to be a father to him; in fact he took him to an emptybuilding and raped him.In Bogotá, where he was begging, a visiting American family sent him to a schoolfor orphans, but a woman schoolteacher tried to seduce him when he was twelve,and he ran away after stealing money.At the age of eighteen, in prison for stealing a car, he was grabbed by fourmale prisoners and raped. He swore revenge. It took two weeks to manufacture aknife; then he lured the rapists, one by one, into a dark cell and killed threeof them; the fourth stumbled on the bodies and fled, screaming, from the cell.Two years were added to his prison sentence – the murders were looked on asself-defence.Once out of prison, he began abducting and raping very young girls, preferablyunder the age of twelve. He would then kill them and bury the bodies. They weremostly Indians, and no-one paid much attention to their disappearance. TheAyacucho Indians caught him carrying off a nine-year-old girl and, aftertorturing him, prepared to bury him alive. An American missionary intervened andtook the bound rapist in her jeep to the nearest Peruvian police outpost. Thepolice were not interested, and sent back across the border into Colombia, wherehe continued to murder girls – his total was by this time around a hundred. Hereturned to Ecuador for, as he explained, its girls are more gentle and trustingthan those of Colombia. His method was always the same – to walk around marketsuntil he saw a girl with ‘a certain look of innocence and beauty’. He wouldfollow the girl, if necessary for days, until her mother left her alone. Then hewould approach her and tell her that he had a present for her mother. He wouldlead her by the hand to the outskirts of the town, then rape and kill her. Hehoped one day to rape a white child, attracted by their fair hair, but touriststended to keep an eye on their children.In April 1980, the man who had become known as ‘the Monster of the Andes’ usedhis usual technique to lure away the eleven-year-old daughter of Carlina RamonPoveda; but the frantic mother caught up with her daughter, walking hand in handwith her abductor. She denounced him shrilly, and when he called her a dirtyIndian, summoned some Indian men to come and help her; they held Lopez downuntil the police arrived.In the murders of the three men who raped him, we see the typical response of aRight Man to humiliation. When Lopez was making his complaints to journalist RonLaytner, he declared: ‘I cannot see the sky. This is wrong, for I am the Man ofthe Century. I will be famous in history.’ Like Knowles, he felt he had finallyachieved ‘success’. Asked to explain how he justified his murders, he toldLaytner: ‘The arrival of life is divine. It comes through the act of sex. And soif an innocent person dies in the act of sex, it is also divine. That personwill find heaven without suffering in this world.’ It sounded curiously likePanzram’s explanation that he was ‘doing people good’ by murdering them, sincelife was so vile that to kill someone was to do him a favour . . . The Right Manlives in a strange universe of fantasy and self-justification, and the serialkiller ‘punishes’ society through murder.By one of those grisly coincidences that are so frequent in the world of murder,a second ‘Monster of the Andes’ was operating in Ecuador within five years ofthe arrest of Lopez. He was Daniel Camargo Barbosa and, like Lopez, he came fromColombia. In 1985 he was serving a life sentence in Colombia for rape andmurder, but succeeded in escaping into Ecuador. During 1986, he raped andmurdered seventy-two women and girls in the area of the port of Guayaquil. Hewas arrested in Quito when a policeman noticed bloodstains on his clothing. Aslightly built man of fifty-seven, with a great deal of natural charm, he seemedan unlikely mass murderer. Like so many serial killers, he was avid for‘recognition’; he began to boast about his murders, and willingly led detectivesto the sites of fifty bodies. He even appeared on television, and when askedwhether he had accomplices, replied proudly: ‘No, I did it all myself.’ Askedwhy he had committed his crimes, he explained: ‘When one has been the victim oftraumatic experiences in childhood, one grows up with the mental conditions forcommitting these acts’, a reply that indicates that, like so many serialkillers, he possessed a relatively high I.Q. Like Lopez, he was sentenced tosixteen years in prison, the maximum possible under Ecuadorian law.Henry Lee Lucas might be regarded as the American equivalent of Pedro AlonzoLopez, at least as far as the number of his victims is concerned: he hasconfessed to three hundred and sixty murders. A rather mild-looking character,who has become deeply religious since he was sentenced to death, he seems atfirst an altogether less obvious example of a Violent Man; but, as the evidencemakes plain, appearances can be deceptive.Born in 1937 in Blacksburg, Virginia, Lucas was the son of a prostitute and arailway worker who had lost both legs in an accident. His mother seems to havedetested the child and treated him with sadistic cruelty, once causing braindamage when she struck him on the head with a piece of wood. His teacher, whooften gave him hot meals, described him as one of the most impoverished anddesperate hill children she had ever met. An accident led to the loss of oneeye, so that he had to have it replaced with a glass one. By the age of fifteenhe had become a juvenile delinquent, and was sent to a reformatory for breakingand entering. ‘I started stealing as soon as I could run fast.’ He had also bythis time committed his first murder, attempting to rape a seventeen-year-oldgirl at a bus stop and strangling her when she resisted. In January 1960, hemurdered his mother during the course of a quarrel, slashing at her with aknife. (He claims that he had no idea that she was dead, and that her death wasdue to a heart attack.) He was sentenced to forty years in prison, where he madeseveral suicide attempts. He was recommended for parole after ten years. Infact, he seems to have felt secure in prison and wanted to stay there; whenparoled, he told the board that he would kill again. On the day he left prison,he kept his word, raping and killing a woman in Jackson. The murder remainedunsolved until he eventually confessed to it.There followed an unsuccessful marriage, which lasted only a short time. InCarbondale, Pennsylvania, he met another drifter, Ottis Toole, a homosexual witha penchant for cannibalism. The two teamed up and, according to Lucas’sbiographer Max Call, ‘left a bloody trail through Michigan, Ohio, Indiana,Illinois and Wisconsin’. Call claims that they kept the head of one murdervictim in the trunk of the car for two days. ‘I was bitter at the world,’ Lucasclaimed. ‘I hated everything.’ ‘Killing someone is just like walking outdoors.If I wanted a victim I’d just go to get one.’Ottis Toole’s parents liked Lucas enough to appoint him the guardian of theirtwo youngest children, Becky Powell, nine, and her younger brother Frank. A yearor two later, she left her Florida home with Lucas and her brother Ottis, andbecame Lucas’s mistress. She was present during a number of his killings, andeven helped to bury the bodies. (Lucas claimed that it was his care in disposingof the bodies that prevented the law from catching up with him for so long.)When Becky was thirteen she was caught and sent to a juvenile detention centrein Florida; with the help of Lucas and her brother she escaped, and the three ofthem went on another killing spree. Lucas claims that he was also a contractkiller for an organisation called ‘Hand of Death’, but this part of his storyis, to say the least, unverified. What is certain is that in 1982 he was paid tolook after an eighty-eight-year-old woman named Kate – ‘Granny’ – Rich, and thathe was to murder her later. Before then, he and Becky had become members of afundamentalist sect called House of Prayer in Stoneberg, Texas, and lived andworked there for several weeks. Under the influence of the religious teaching,Becky decided she wanted to go back to Florida and finish her sentence in thereformatory. Lucas wanted her to stay, but finally agreed. On the way to Floridathey quarrelled, and when Becky suddenly slapped his face, he stabbed her todeath. He dismembered the body and buried it. As far as Lucas was concerned, themurder of Becky was the beginning of the end.Back in Texas at the House of Prayer, he took Kate Rich for a long drive andboth drank cans of beer. A quarrel developed, or Lucas became angry at herquestions about Becky; he stabbed her to death, raped the body, and hid it in aculvert.Lucas was the chief suspect in Granny Rich’s disappearance, but there was noevidence against him. In June 1983 his friend Reuben Moore, head of the House ofPrayer, reported to the police that Lucas owned a gun, a felony for anex-convict. He was arrested and in prison underwent a religious conversion thatled him to confess to murdering Becky and Kate Rich. He also confessed to atotal of three hundred and sixty murders.In fact, many of these admissions proved to be false, but several were verifiedby the investigators: a recent figure is 199 murders in twenty-seven states –including the rape and murder of the woman in Jackson, of a West Virginia policeofficer, and of an unknown female hitchhiker known simply as ‘orange socks’.Lucas was eventually sentenced to death for eleven murders; his accomplice OttisToole also received a death sentence.Sheriff Jim Boutwell of Williamson County, Texas, who came to know Lucas well inprison, noted in 1985: ‘Henry Lee Lucas is helping write a new chapter in thehistory of law enforcement . . . Henry’s confessions, and the subsequentinvestigations, have exposed the mobility of crime in the United States.’ Infact, it was the Lucas case more than any other that made America aware of theexistence of the mobile serial killer.Since Lucas was a masochist, a man who apparently enjoyed being dominated bywomen, it may seem doubtful that he should be classified as a ‘Right Man’, butmany points in his confession confirm it. From the murder, at the age offifteen, Lucas killed those who resisted him. Lucas was a high-dominance, highlysexed male, with an extremely low bursting-point. ‘Sex is one of my downfalls. Iget sex any way I can get it. If I have to force somebody to do it, I do. If Idon’t, I don’t. I rape them; I’ve done that. I’ve killed animals to have sexwith them . . .’ He also admitted that he had skinned animals alive during histeens.Asked about the problems of interrogating Lucas, Sheriff Boutwell replied: ‘Youdon’t interrogate him . . . You talk with him just as a conversation. Thegood/bad guy role that officers traditionally use with suspects wouldn’t workwith him . . . If at any time you indicate you disbelieve him . . . you’ll ruinyour credibility with him.’ Boutwell describes a case in which a police officerhad driven three thousand miles to interview Lucas and, even though he had beenwarned against it, called Lucas a liar within the first two minutes. His journeywas wasted; Lucas immediately refused to hold any further conversation. This is,of course, the behaviour of a Right Man, a man who refuses, in anycircumstances, to admit that he could be wrong or a liar. Boutwell alsocommented on Lucas’s high I.Q. and remarked that successfully interrogating himdepended upon an appeal to his ego. Lucas was allowed all kinds of privileges –as much coffee as he liked (he was a coffee addict) and endless cigarettes.Asked by the interviewer whether this was not ‘babying’ him, Boutwell againemphasised that this was the only way to get Lucas to co-operate – to take carethat he felt he was not just an ordinary prisoner.The murder of Becky Powell seems to have been a watershed for Lucas. It isobvious – from his confession – that he loved her in a way he had never lovedanyone; she was at once his wife, mistress and daughter, the only person who hadever accepted him without criticism, who regarded him as a kind of god – thekind of ego-balm that the Right Man craves above all else. Yet, because of thatfatal tendency to explode under pressure, he killed her. Now he was not only onhis own, but deprived of his one reason for living. The murder of Granny Rich –one of the few people who had treated him with kindness – may have been amasochistic gesture of defiance and despair, like shaking his fist at the sky.One thing becomes very clear from the study of serial killers: that defiance anddespair are part of the syndrome. The psychologist Joel Norris, the author ofSerial Killers: The Growing Menace, writes of a killer who had ‘reached thefinal stage of the serial murderer syndrome: he realised that he had come to adead end with nothing but his own misery to show for it’.Norris is writing about Leonard Lake, perhaps the most horrific serial killer ofthe 1980s. He earns this gruesome distinction by a kind of ruthlessness andsadism that seem to belong in the pages of a horror comic.The murders – of at least twenty-five people – came to light in the summer of1985. On the afternoon of Sunday 2 June an assistant at a hardware store, SouthCity Lumber, in San Francisco, observed a slight, bespectacled youth walking outof the store with a $75 vice for which he had not paid, and called a policeman.The man – who was obviously Asiatic – was putting the vice in the boot of a car,and when the policeman approached he immediately ran away. An older, beardedman, explained that his companion thought he had already paid for it. Thepoliceman pointed at a hold-all in the car boot. ‘What’s in there?’ ‘I don’tknow. It belongs to him . . .’ The bearded man opened the hold-all, and revealeda 22 automatic pistol with a silencer. Since this was against the law inCalifornia, the policeman told the man that he would have to accompany him toheadquarters.There the man offered his driving licence for identification; it was in the nameof Robin Scott Stapley. The policeman said he would have to do a computer check,and that the suspect would then have to post bond before he could be released.The man asked if he could have a glass of water, and when one was provided put aplastic capsule into his mouth, swallowed and drank it down; seconds later, heslumped forward. His interrogators at first assumed he had suffered a heartattack; but in hospital it was discovered that he had taken a cyanide capsule.Four days later, he died.Meanwhile, the computer check had revealed that he was not Robin Stapley; thelatter was a twenty-six-year-old who had been missing for months. A furthercheck revealed that, soon after Stapley had been reported missing, his pick-uptruck and trailer had been in a minor accident in San Francisco. The slight,Chinese youth who had been driving said he took full responsibility for theaccident, and that there was no need to report it, but the driver whose goodsvehicle had been grazed had to report it under his company’s rules. The pick-uptruck then proved to belong to the missing Robin Stapley. By this time, theChinese youth and the truck had vanished.The car the two men had been driving proved to be registered in the name of PaulCosner. Cosner had also been reported missing. He had told his girlfriend thathe had sold the car to a ‘weird-looking man’ who would pay cash, and had drivenoff to deliver it; no-one had seen him since. When forensic experts examined thecar, they discovered two bullet holes, two spent bullets, and some bloodstains.In the pockets of the man who had died from cyanide poisoning police found billsmade out to ‘Charles Gunnar’, with an address near Wisleyville, in CalaverasCounty, 150 miles north-east of San Francisco. The sheriff there, ClaudeBallard, was able to tell the investigators that Gunnar owned a small ranch, andthat he lived with a young Chinese named Charles Ng (pronounced Ing). In fact,Ballard had already been checking on the two men. They had been advertisingvarious things for sale, such as television sets, videos and articles offurniture, and Ballard had suspected they might be stolen. However, checks onserial numbers had come to nothing. What was more ominous was that Gunnar hadoffered for sale furniture belonging to a young couple, Lonnie Bond and BrendaO’Connor, explaining that they had moved to Los Angeles and had given him thefurniture to pay a debt. No-one had heard from them since. At a nearby campsite, another couple had simply vanished, leaving behind their tent and a coffeepot boiling on the stove.By now, a check on the dead man’s fingerprints had revealed that he had acriminal record – for burglary and grand larceny in Mendocino County – and hadjumped bail there. His real name was Leonard Lake.The ranch house, in Blue Mountain Road, proved to be a two-bedroom bungalow setin three acres of land. The sight of the master bedroom increased theforebodings of the detectives; hooks in the ceiling and walls, and chains andshackles found in a box, suggested that it might be some kind of torturechamber. A wardrobe proved to contain many women’s undergarments and some filmynightgowns. On the hillside at the back of the house there were burnt bones thatlooked ominously human. In a cinderblock bunker cut into the hillside theydiscovered more hooks and chains, and walls covered with pictures of girlsposing in their lingerie. What was disturbing about this was that the backdropof many of these showed a forest scene mural that covered one of the walls; theyhad obviously been taken in the same room. The expression on some of the facessuggested that the girls were not enjoying it.The grimmest piece of evidence was a filing cabinet full of videotapes. Thepolice slipped one of these – labelled ‘M Ladies, Kathy/Brenda’ – into therecorder, and found themselves looking at a frightened girl handcuffed to achair, with a young Chinese – Charles Ng – holding a knife beside her. Then alarge, balding man with a beard enters the frame, takes off the handcuffs,shackles her ankles, and orders her to undress. She does so reluctantly,hesitating before removing her knickers. The bearded man tells her: ‘You’ll washfor us, clean for us, fuck for us.’ After this, she is made to go into theshower with the Chinese. A later scene showed her strapped naked to a bed, whilethe bearded man tells her that her boyfriend Mike is dead.Two five-hundred-page journals – in Lake’s handwriting – left no doubt what hadbeen happening. His fantasy was to have women as sex slaves, but he was willingto go a great deal further than Cameron Hooker or Gary Heidnik. One couple –Brenda O’Connor, her boyfriend Lonnie Bond, and their two-year-old baby – hadbeen invited to the house for dinner; the man and baby had been killed, andBrenda O’Connor had been handcuffed in the chair, while Ng cut off her clothes.On the video she asks: ‘Why do you guys do this?’, and he tells her: ‘We don’tlike you. Do you want me to put it in writing?’ ‘Don’t cut my bra off.’ ‘Nothingis yours now.’ ‘Give my baby back to me. I’ll do anything you want.’ ‘You’regoing to do anything we want anyway.’ Lake’s journal commented: ‘The perfectwoman is totally controlled. A woman who does exactly what she is told to do andnothing else. There is no sexual problem with a submissive woman. There are nofrustrations – only pleasure and contentment.’Other videos showed the girls being raped and murdered; there were alsosnapshots of dead bodies, and bags of human bones that seemed to have beenboiled.By now police had dug up four bodies from a trench at the back of the house, twoof them blacks. Ng had been seen driving to the ranch with two black men, yetwas known to hate blacks and Hispanics. He had also taken various transients towork at the ‘ranch’; now it began to look as if some of them may never haveleft. Another person who had disappeared was Lake’s younger brother Donald, whohad failed to return after a visit to his brother in an earlier ‘survivalistcompound’ in Humboldt County. Two months before Lake’s arrest, a San Franciscocouple, Harvey and Deborah Dubs, together with their sixteen-month-old son, hadvanished from their San Francisco apartment, and the detective who had lookedinto their disappearance had been told that a young Chinese-looking man had beenseen moving out their furniture; by coincidence, the same officer was nowworking on the Lake case . . .Ng was now one of the most wanted men in America, but had not been seen sincehis disappearance. A few days later, a San Francisco gun dealer who had beenrepairing an automatic pistol belonging to Ng notified the police that Ng hadtelephoned him from Chicago asking if he could send him the gun by post. Whenthe gun dealer had explained that it would be illegal to send handguns acrossstate lines, Ng had cursed him and hung up.On Saturday 6 July 1985, five weeks after Lake’s capture, a security guard in adepartment store in Calgary, Alberta, saw a young Chinese slipping food underhis jacket. When challenged, the thief drew a pistol, and as they grappled hefired, wounding the guard in the hand. The man ran away at top speed, but wasintercepted by other guards. It became obvious that he had some training inJapanese martial arts, but he was eventually overpowered. Identificationdocuments revealed that he was Charles Ng. A Canadian court sentenced Ng to fourand a half years in prison for armed robbery, but resisted the demand that heshould then be extradited to California, on the grounds that California stillhad a death penalty.FBI agents looking into Ng’s background learned that he was the son of a wealthyHong Kong family. Born in 1961, Ng had been educated at a private school innorth Yorkshire, from which he had been expelled for theft. Although Ng wasnever short of money, he was a lifelong kleptomaniac. He had lived for a whilein Preston, Lancashire, then his parents sent him to San Francisco to completehis education. At the age of eighteen, Ng had been involved in a hit-and-runaccident, and to escape a jail sentence, joined the marines. At Kaneoke Air Baseon Oahu in Hawaii, he was arrested for thefts of weapons amounting to more thaneleven thousand dollars. He escaped and made his way back to San Francisco,where he met Lake, and became his close companion; they were later arrested onburglary charges in Mendocino County, where Ng was identified as an armydeserter. Convicted on the Hawaii arms theft charges, he spent some time in theFederal Prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. When paroled, he found a job as awarehouseman in San Francisco, and took an apartment there. He spent much of histime at Lake’s ‘ranch’ at Wisleyville. Comments by Ng’s attorney made it clearthat Ng liked to think of himself as an anti-social ‘outsider’; he boasted ofplacing cyanide in the salt cellars at the Hawaii air base, dropping heat tabsinto mail boxes, and of ‘assassinating’ a man in California.FBI agents flew to Calgary to question him. Ng’s story was that he knew aboutLake’s murders, but had taken no part in them. Ng described how Lake had killedcar dealer Paul Cosner, whose car he was driving when arrested, and also howLake had killed two employees of a removal company, one of whom was burnt todeath.Leonard Lake, born in 1946 in San Francisco, had an even more disturbinghistory. He had been in the marines in Vietnam, but had been discharged ashaving psychiatric problems. Joel Norris’s investigation into Lake’s backgroundrevealed a classic picture of a child rejected by both parents at an early age,and raised by his grandmother, a strict disciplinarian. Both his father andmother came from a family of alcoholics. The grandfather, also an alcoholic, wasa violent type who subjected the child to a kind of military discipline. Hisyounger brother Donald, his mother’s favourite, was an epileptic who hadexperienced a serious head injury; he practised sadistic cruelty to animals andtried to rape both his sisters. Lake protected the sisters ‘in return for sexualfavours’ – from an early age he had displayed sexual obsession that seems tocharacterise the serial killer. He took nude photographs of his sisters andcousins, and later became a maker of pornographic movies starring his wife. Hisfantasies were of the same type as Cameron Hooker’s – total domination overwomen.Lake shared another characteristic of so many serial killers: he lived in aworld of fantasy – boasting, for example, of daring exploits in Vietnam when, infact, he had never seen combat. Like so many Right Men, he was skilful in hidinghis abnormality, teaching grade school, working as a volunteer fire-fighter, anddonating time to a company that provided free insulation in old people’s homes.Like the boy-killer John Gacy, he seemed an exemplary citizen; but his outlookwas deeply pessimistic. He believed that World War Three would break out at anymoment, and this is why he had built the bunker – stocked with food – at theranch. Like other ‘survivalists’, he often dressed in combat fatigues, andtalked of living off the land. Once out of the marines, his behaviour had becomeincreasingly odd. In his original ‘survivalist compound’ in Mother Lode,Humboldt County, the police found maps of the area with crosses marking ‘buriedtreasure’ – almost certainly bodies. It was there that he had murdered his bestfriend from the marines, Charles Gunnar, and assumed his identity. After beingforced to flee from the earlier compound because of burglary charges, he hadmoved to Wisleyville. A marriage to a girl called Cricket Balazs had broken up,but she had continued to act as a fence for stolen credit cards and other items.Lake seems to have loved her – at least he said so in a last note scrawled as hewas dying – but he nevertheless clung to the paranoid notion that women wereresponsible for all his problems.In his journal, Lake describes himself ‘with death in my pocket and fantasy inmy soul’. He daydreamed of a more heroic and violent era – Vikings and Norsesagas – and of having chained girls as sex slaves (the ‘cells’ in his bunkerwere built for them). According to Norris, the later journals show increasingdisillusionment. ‘His dreams of success had eluded him; he admitted to himselfthat his boasts about heroic deeds in Vietnam were all delusions, and theincreasing number of victims he was burying in the trench behind his bunker onlyadded to his unhappiness. By the time he was arrested in San Francisco, Lake hadreached the final stage of the serial murderer syndrome: he realised that he hadcome to a dead end with nothing but his own misery to show for it.’What has happened, we can see, is that Lake has gone one step beyond most RightMen: instead of merely fantasising about being a lone ‘outsider’, an outcastfrom a materialistic society, he translated his fantasies into reality, actingwith a casual ruthlessness that is rarely seen even among serial killers,murdering men – even babies – so that he could lay his hands on women and turnthem into sex slaves. But when fantasy is brought into contact with reality, itis bound to melt away. Our sense of our own humanity depends on feelingourselves to be members of society, on having at least a few close relationswith other human beings. To kill men – one of them his own brother and anotherhis best friend – and rape and torture women, was bound to cause a sense ofrevolt in the part of him that still had a capacity for human warmth. He wassystematically raping his own humanity. The published extracts from the tapessuggest that Lake and Ng were still sufficiently human to be aware of this. (Forexample, they tell Kathy Allen – who had gone there looking for her boyfriendMike Carrol – that they intend to keep her prisoner for a month then let her go;but since she was their prisoner, they had no practical reason to try and spareher feelings.)What Leonard Lake did was to act out the fantasies of the Marquis de Sade – who,as we have seen, might be regarded as the patron saint of serial killers. Whathe proved was the basic incompatibility between these fantasies and our humannature. Even hangmen have to feel that they are useful members of society. EvenNazi torturers had to tell themselves that they were serving a cause. To behavelike Haroun Al Raschid or Ivan the Terrible is to commit mental suicide. If Lakehad chosen to bluff it out in the San Francisco police station, sticking to hisstory that he was Robin Stapley, he might well have walked out a free man. Yethis journals reveal that he had ceased to be a free man many months before. Thetime to end a meaningless existence had arrived, and Lake became his ownexecutioner."},{"pageContent":"EightInto the FutureTHE QUESTION REMAINS; why is it that serial killers have appeared at thisparticular point in history? One psychiatrist, discussing Leonard Lake – who wasborn in 1946, the same year as Ted Bundy – suggests that an unusual number ofmales were born in the year after the war and that, statistically speaking, aproportion of them were bound to become killers. Others have pointed out thatmany serial killers have been sexually abused in childhood, and suggested thatan increase in the sexual abuse of children has led to the rise of the serialkiller. In Compulsive Killers (1986) Elliot Leyton has produced a ‘social’theory of serial killers. He points out that the fifteenth-century multiplemurderer Gilles de Rais – who raped and killed at least fifty children in hischâteau at Machecoul – lived in an era when the established order in France wasstriving to reassert itself against the assaults of peasants and merchants.Gilles was obsessed by the excesses of Tiberius and Caligula, and strove toemulate their lifestyles. His crimes, Leyton suggests, were a personalisedexpression of this aggressive attitude of his class – his victims were allchildren of peasants. In our own time, he suggests, serial killers have beenmembers of the working class or lower middle class, struggling with a sense ofalienation and frustration. For them, murder is a form of class assertion.There is certainly some truth in this notion; so far there have been noupper-class – or even upper-middle-class – serial killers. The reason for thismay be the one suggested in Chapter Seven: that serial murder may be a humanexpression of the ‘overcrowded rat syndrome’, and that upper- and middle-classchildren are unlikely to suffer from overcrowding.The overcrowded rat theory suggests that the reasons for the appearance ofserial murder are primarily social, and this tends to be confirmed by the studyof sex crime. As we have seen, sex crime – in our modern sense of the word – wasvirtually unknown in the eighteenth century; it made its appearance in thesecond half of the nineteenth century, and was undoubtedly linked to ‘Victorian’attitudes towards sex; that is, to the fact that sex was unmentionable inrespectable society, and therefore ‘forbidden’.To understand the crimes of killers like Bundy, Gallego and Lake, we also haveto recognise that, in another respect, human attitudes towards sex have hardlychanged in many thousands of years. From the Iliad to the Morte D’Arthur, theimage of woman has been much the same: the archetypal heroine is gentle, modest,decorous, virtuous and free from vanity. While sexually desirable, she isuninterested in sex, and only grants it to the male who has proved himself‘worthy’ of her. As far as most males are concerned, she is essentially‘forbidden’. If she shows preference for one of her many wooers, the othersexperience agonising jealousy because their goddess has rejected them. Helen’selopement with Paris, like Queen Guinevere’s infidelity with Lancelot, seemsdoubly shocking because we feel her to be the embodiment of all the femalevirtues.The twentieth century has seen a gradual ‘emancipation’ of our attitudes towardssex. From Wells’s Ann Veronica, through Ulysses and Lady Chatterley’s Lover, toHuxley’s Brave New World, modern writers have assured us that perfectly nicegirls can enjoy copulation and even commit adultery. We nowadays accept thatwhen a girl refers to her ‘boyfriend’, she usually means the man she sleepswith, and that a girl who has had many lovers is not necessarily a harlot. Yetwhile the conscious mind has adjusted to this new state of affairs, ourinstincts continued to harbour the old ‘forbidden’ female archetype, modest,gentle and virtuous. So in spite of enormous changes in our sexual attitudes,modern man’s reaction to a pretty girl is in most respects exactly like that ofthe troubadours or the knights of the Round Table: she is an unknown country, asovereign state, that he would love to be allowed to explore. Brave New Worldremains mildly titillating because its apparently ‘nice’ young ladies discussthe men they have slept with openly without any sense of guilt. We feel the samesense of shock that we would experience if Jane Austen’s heroines talked openlyabout their adulteries.In other words, so as far as sex is concerned, ‘modernity’ is only a superficialoverlay; but there is a field in which change has been genuine and profound:that of political freedom. We are living in the first era in which, for a largeproportion of the globe, the Rights of Man have become a reality. They have beendiscussed and analysed for more than two centuries; but the truth is thatpolitical freedom means very little without economic freedom; a desperately poorman is, by definition, one of the oppressed, whether he lives under democracy ordictatorship. It is only in the second half of the twentieth century thatwelfare states have been able to offer the majority of their citizens somedegree of security from starvation. The result is that ‘rights’ that were oncetheoretical have finally become an actuality. Every tramp knows that the policehave no right to arrest him without good reason; every schoolboy knows that aschoolmaster who loses his temper and hits him runs the risk of dismissal. It isno longer necessary to be wealthy or influential to ensure impartial treatmentat the hands of the law.The negative side of the coin – and it may be a small price to pay – is anincrease in the kind of boredom and apathy that were once regarded as diseasesof the rich, and in the self-pity and resentment that flourish in such fertilesoil. We have seen that the beginning of the thought process that leads to crimeinvolves looking around for someone on whom we can lay the blame. In thatrespect there is a basic similarity between the psychology of Charles Manson andhis drug-addict disciples and terrorist organisations like the Japanese Red Armyfaction, the Baader-Meinhof gang and the Symbionese Liberation Army. When welearn that Ian Brady shook his fist at the sky after one of his murders, thatGerald Gallego declared ‘his only desire was to kill God’, and that Leonard Laketook pride in declaring himself an atheist, we can begin to understand how thelogic of resentment can lead to total rejection of ‘conscience’, as it looks foran ultimate scapegoat.It was towards the end of the eighteenth century that political philosophersbegan to argue that most men are poor because the social system is unjust. KarlMarx went a step further and declared that the poor have the right to seizetheir neighbour’s wealth, for if the neighbour was honest he would not bewealthy. By the end of the nineteenth century, Marxism had begun to achieve acertain academic respectability. Nowadays, there are hundreds of academics in‘capitalist’ universities all over the world who make no secret of their Marxistaffiliations.The sexual revolution took longer to gather momentum, as we have seen, becausewhen a society is economically deprived, sex is a secondary issue. Once asociety is affluent, sex becomes one of the major issues. It is important tounderstand that the attitude that seems typical of sex criminals is also sharedby many ‘respectable’ members of society, including its leading intellectuals.H.G. Wells was well known in London as a tireless adulterer who kept photographsof his mistresses on the mantelpiece; his wife was expected to accept his needfor affaires. Bertrand Russell was a lifelong seducer who was pursuing teenagestudents well into his seventies, when his virility began to fail. Thetheologian Paul Tillich was a pornography addict who was still seducing femalestudents in his eighth decade. A recent biography of the Catholic artist EricGill reveals that he practised a lifelong promiscuity, which included incestwith his sisters and daughters, as well as bestiality and a passion foradolescent girls. In the various artistic communities that he formed, hedemanded the droit de seigneur over all the attractive women, and becameintensely jealous if they allowed themselves to be seduced by other males. Thepainter Augustus John shared Gill’s enthusiasm for incest (as becomes clear fromMichael Holroyd’s biography), and also his attitude of droit de seigneur overwomen in his immediate entourage. (It may or may not be relevant that John was amediocre artist until he dived into the sea and knocked himself unconscious on arock; after his recovery, he became a major artist.)How can intelligent men justify this kind of self-indulgence? The answer is thatthey have no difficulty whatsoever. Wells’s argument was that in order to evolveas a writer he needed to evolve as a human being, and that it would beimpossible to evolve as a human being if he went around in a state of permanentsexual frustration. His affaires, he claimed, filled him with creative energyand a sense of the wonder of the universe. His wife was expected to accept thisor agree to a separation; she seems to have accepted it, but lived a lonely andunsatisfying existence, dying of abdominal cancer in 1927. (Augustus John’s wifecommitted suicide.)Wells was a member of a privileged class, an intellectual elite, and he demandedsexual freedom as a right of his class. As we have seen, the slow increase inpersonal liberty in the twentieth century means that the ‘privileged class’ hasexpanded until it includes most dominant and intelligent males. If Melvin Reesor Ted Bundy or Leonard Lake had been called upon to present a reasoned defenceof their crimes, they would all have sounded much like H.G. Wells. The maindifference, they would have argued, is that Wells, as a famous writer, had aqueue of young ladies eager to share his bed. They, as intelligent nobodies,were forced to take a short cut. But since they all believed that ‘onlyindividual standards make murder right or wrong’, and that nature intended usall to be predators, they had no hesitation in risking life and liberty in thename of individual self-development. They would also have gone on to argue, withthe self-justification that never fails the Right Man, that the blame should beplaced squarely on modern society, with its endless sexual stimulation – fromsoft-porn magazines on every newsstand to the obligatory bedroom scene in everyfilm. Man surely has a right to get rid of his frustrations?There has been, so far, no sexual equivalent of Karl Marx to argue that womenhave no right to withhold their bodies from sexually frustrated males, and oughtto be raped. Yet this obviously describes the attitude of Rees, Bundy, Gallego,and most of the other serial killers in this volume. Every rapist could beregarded as an advocate of the ‘propaganda of the deed’. And the ‘elitistargument’ summarised above is sound in at least one respect: that if the levelof sexual stimulation in a society continues to rise, an increasing number ofhighly-sexed dominant males will cross the threshold into rape. As suggestedelsewhere, ‘when there is underlying social frustration, it is the criminal whoprovides a measure of that tension. If a new and horrifying type of crimeoccurs, a type that has never been known before, it should not be regarded assome freak occurrence, any more than the outbreak of a new disease should bedismissed as a medical oddity.’ Criminals might be compared with the rats whodie first in a plague.1 [../Text/chapter_008.xhtml#ft001]The rise of sexual fetishism provides an interesting example of the mechanism.The word was invented by the nineteenth-century psychologist Alfred Binet, whopointed out that if early sexual excitement is associated with some object, suchas a woman’s hair or shoes, it may become ‘imprinted’, so that the same objectcontinues to produce excitement, just as the ringing of a bell made Pavlov’sdogs salivate. In fact, one of the earliest cases of fetishism on record datesfrom April 1790, when London was terrorised by a man who, in the words of thechronicler Archenholtz, committed ‘nameless crimes, the possibility of whoseexistence no legislator has ever dreamt of’. These nameless crimes amounted tocreeping up behind fashionably dressed women and slashing at their clothing witha sharp knife, which occasionally caused painful wounds; it was also allegedthat he would hold out a nosegay to young ladies, and as they bent to sniff it,would jab them in the face with a ‘sharp pointed instrument’ hidden among theflowers. ‘The Monster’ apparently became obsessed with the pretty daughter of atavern keeper, Anne Porter, and followed her in St James’s Park, making obscenesuggestions. On the night of 18 January 1790, when she was returning from a ballwith her two sisters, he came up behind her, and she felt a blow on her rightbuttock. Indoors, she discovered that she had a nine-inch knife wound which wasfour inches deep in the centre. Six months later, out walking with a gentlemannamed Coleman, she recognised the ‘Monster’ in the street. Coleman followed theman to a nearby house, accused him of being the attacker, and made a kind of‘citizen’s arrest’. The man denied being the ‘Monster’, but Anne Porter faintedwhen she saw him. He proved to be a slightly built man named Renwick Williams, amaker of artificial flowers. At his trial, Williams insisted that it was a caseof mistaken identity; and offered an alibi. The jury chose to disbelieve him,and he was sentenced to six years in prison for ‘damaging clothes’. During themonths he was attacking women, Williams created a reign of terror: rewards wereoffered and walls covered in posters describing his activities. The prosecutingcounsel talked of ‘a scene that is so new in the annals of humanity, a scene soinexplicable, so unnatural, that one might have regarded it, out of respect forhuman nature, as impossible . . .’ ‘The Monster’ clearly created a profoundsense of psychological shock amongst his contemporaries, of the kind produced acentury later by the Jack the Ripper murders.A century later still, another bizarre precedent was created by the behaviour ofa sexual deviate who became known in California as the Panty Bandit; he wouldhold up underwear shops or beauty parlours in the Los Angeles area, order awoman to remove her panties and/or tights, and then masturbate with the garmentdraped over his face before snatching money from the till. Police wereaccustomed to dealing with nuisances who stole underwear from clotheslines orfrequented laundromats in search of soiled panties, but had never encountered aman who would masturbate in front of a crowd of customers and then make off withthe underwear. In the summer of 1988, the ‘Panty Bandit’ was nominated PublicEnemy Number One in California. His activities revealed that he was at leastdisinclined to use his gun. In one shop, he ordered a woman to masturbate him;she made a grab for his gun, and he punched her in the face and ran away. On 23October 1988 a shop assistant succeeded in notifying the police shortly afterthe bandit had left, and a man driving a Honda Civic was caught after a chase.He was thirty-three-year-old Bruce Lyons, and in his car the police found a boxfull of stolen underwear. Lyons was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Theseverity of the sentence reflects a recognition of how easily the Panty Banditcould have progressed to rape and murder.In the two centuries that separate Renwick Williams from Bruce Lyons, it isclear that extraordinary social changes have taken place – changes that wouldhave been incomprehensible to Dr Johnson, but which would have been perfectlyunderstood by his contemporary the Marquis de Sade. Sade lived in an atmosphereof unreality, a world of dreams inside his own head. He was one of theprivileged few who could afford that indulgence. Two centuries later, anaffluent society had created conditions that could spawn potential de Sades bythe thousand.We are now also in a position to understand what has happened since the days ofRenwick Williams – how, in the increased prosperity of the nineteenth century,the age of economic crime gave way slowly to the age of sex crime, and how thisin turn is being displaced by an age of crimes that ‘service’ the craving forself-esteem, the will to power. Rees, Bundy, Hooker, Lake, Heidnik, simplyrefused to accept that they were not Haroun A1 Raschid and could do whateverthey liked. Bundy admitted that, at any point during his crimes, he could havestopped himself if he had wanted to; he simply had no desire to stop. He haddecided that he had a right to kill, just as a thief decides that he has a rightto steal.But exactly how great is the problem of the serial killer? In Serial Killers:The Growing Menace, Joel Norris estimates that in America there may be as manyas five hundred at large at any given time; other estimates vary – ElliottLeyton guesses a hundred. An altogether more balanced estimate was provided byFBI agent Gregg McCrary. Asked about the number of serial killers, he said:‘There were six thousand or more unsolved murders last year (1988), and the bulkof the serial killer victims will undoubtedly be somewhere in that number. (But)the unofficial estimates of three hundred, four hundred or five hundred even, donot seem to me to be reasonable . . . There’s less than a hundred out there – inmy view less than fifty. My estimate is between thirty and fifty. Working onthat figure, and using as a guide our experience of many serial killersaveraging ten or less victims apiece at the time of their apprehension – therewill be exceptions, of course – an estimate of a few hundred serial murders peryear (in the US) would probably be most accurate.’About the success rate, he commented: ‘Again this is very difficult tocalculate. We reckon to “identify” between thirteen and fifteen serial killerseach year. By “identifying” I mean identify as working, not as individuals: andof those we reckon that half – seven say – will be caught and brought to trialwith the help of CIAP profiling. Now seven doesn’t tell you the full story. Takethe Bundy case, for example. Bundy was charged with just three murders, thethree he committed in Florida. But he admitted to twenty-three, and a lot of lawenforcement guys think he was good for half as many again, around thirty-fourmurders. Now we profiled Bundy. OK, he was arrested under another name fordriving a stolen car, but he was identified in custody as Bundy – and executedtwelve years later, still for only three murders. But how many murders do youclaim in the “success rate” – in other words, in this arrest and conviction of aman in which profiling played a part? Was it three murders, twenty-three orthirty-four? So “success rate” is not accountable in the most meaningful sense –i.e. the number of murders cleaned up with the aid of profiling.’Between three hundred and five hundred murders a year sound an alarming total,but it is a long way short of the four or five thousand that has been suggested.These figures makes it clear that America is not full of maniacal serial killerswho wander around and kill hundreds of people over the course of years. Most ofthem, as we have seen, commit their crimes over a fairly brief period and in arestricted area. The mobile serial killer is the exception, and the VICAPcomputer means that the chance of catching him has been enormously increased.Compared with the most frequent type of murder – domestic killings – the numberof victims of serial murder remains relatively small. It is interesting to notethat in the decade from 1979 to 1989 – the period during which most of theserial killers in this book committed their crimes – the American murder rateremained stable at around 20,000 a year. To imply that serial murder is ‘agrowing menace’ comparable to AIDS is clearly something of an exaggeration.What was clear, even as early as the 1960s, was that ‘motiveless murder’constituted a new and baffling type of crime. Sex crime, as we have seen, wasdifficult to solve because in most cases there was only a casual connectionbetween the criminal and the victim. Nevertheless, police were often able tocatch serial rapists because a certain pattern was discernible in their crimes.In 1973, two rapists in Houston, Texas, made a habit of abducting girls who weregetting into their cars late at night, driving them to a remote spot, thensubjecting them to hours of sexual humiliation before leaving them naked. Afterforty rapes and two murders, the police decided to ‘stake out’ every car park inHouston, using vast numbers of men, including civilian volunteers. On the secondnight of the stake-out, when the rapists tried to abduct another girl, policeheard her scream, and the men were arrested before they could escape. MichaelOhern, twenty, and Howard Braden, nineteen, both received sentences of lifeimprisonment without possibility of parole. It was a laborious way of catchingrapists, but it worked. When, on the other hand, a killer who became known as‘Zodiac’ committed five murders and severely wounded two more victims in the SanFrancisco Bay area in the late 1960s, a vast police operation failed to trap himbecause the killings were motiveless and random; his identify remains unknown.We have seen how the major breakthrough occurred in the mid-1970s, with thesetting up of the Behavioral Science Unit at the FBI Academy in Quantico,Virginia, with a grant of $128,000 from the National Institute of Justice. Theoldest and most experienced of its agents was Howard Teten, who taught a coursein applied criminology; he seemed to have a natural talent for ‘profiling’criminals. On one occasion he was able to solve a case over the telephone – themultiple stabbing of a girl in California. From the frenzy of the attack, Tetenjudged that it was a sudden impulsive act, and that it sounded like a teenager,a ‘social isolate’, who would be weighed down by guilt and ready to confess. Headvised the police to look in the neighbourhood where the girl was killed. Infact, when a policeman knocked on a door and was confronted with a skinnyteenager, the boy blurted out: ‘You got me.’We have also seen how, when the police of Platte City, Missouri, were confrontedwith the sex murder of a schoolgirl, Julie Wittmeyer, in 1977, the BehavioralScience Unit was able to ‘profile’ the killer so accurately that theinvestigators were immediately able to identify him in their list of suspects.In the case of the Anchorage killer Robert Hansen, FBI agent Glenn Flothedescribes how he telephoned the Unit. ‘I started to tell the guy from the FBIabout Hansen and he goes, ‘No, no, no – tell me about the crimes and let me tellyou about the guy’. After describing the crimes, the agent told him that thekiller probably was a respected member of the community, and probably stuttered.‘He basically outlined Robert Hansen.’ Psychological profiling has raised theold-fashioned ‘hunch’ to the level of a science. In the FBI handbook SexualHomicide: Its Patterns and Motives, it is estimated that psychological profilinghas ‘helped focus the investigation in 77 per cent of those cases in which thesuspects were subsequently identified’ – a highly satisfying success rate.Equally important in the investigation of serial murder has been the use ofcomputers. It was the case of Henry Lee Lucas, in 1983, that made state policeforces aware of the need for co-operation; Lucas himself told Sheriff JimBoutwell that he realised he owed his immunity to lack of co-operation betweenstates. Computerisation of fingerprinting has also been a major advance. LosAngeles computerised its fingerprints in 1985, and within the first threeminutes of the operation of the new system, it identified a fingerprint liftedfrom a stolen car as that of a twenty-five-year-old drifter, Richard Ramirez –thus giving an identity to the unknown serial killer so far known only as the‘Night Stalker’; Ramirez was later sentenced to death for thirteen murders.Perhaps the most exciting advance of recent years has been the development of‘DNA fingerprinting’ – the discovery, made by Dr Alec Jeffreys in 1985, that theDNA molecules contained in every single cell of our bodies are almost asindividual as a fingerprint, so that a rapist can be identified from his semen,a fragment of skin beneath a victim’s nails, or even a single hair. It meantthat virtually every rapist could be identified from some trace of evidence lefton the victim. Since 1985, the number of ‘random’ sex criminals who have beencaught through genetic fingerprinting has continued to increase dramatically,demonstrating that genetic fingerprinting is probably the most importantinnovation in crime detection since the original discovery of fingerprintclassification in the 1890s.What this book has tried to demonstrate is that the serial killer is a virtuallyinevitable product of the evolution of our society. What is happening todaycould be compared with what happened in Europe in the eighteenth century, whenthe soaring population rate in the large cities2[../Text/chapter_008.xhtml#ft002] combined with the introduction of a new cheapdrink called gin to produce an unparalleled crime explosion. Cities like Londonand Paris became vast pestilence-infected slums, and the ‘overcrowded rat’syndrome proceeded to operate on the human population. In fact, in these twocities the crime explosion was brought under control with remarkable ease by anew and efficient police force. As the Industrial Revolution brought moreovercrowding – between 1800 and 1900 the population more than doubled – the ageof economic crime gave way to the age of sex crime. In the mid-twentiethcentury, the age of sex crime merged into a new age of self-esteem crime; andthere was an important difference. Any medium-dominance male might commit rapeif he happened to be drunk and sexually frustrated. As far as we can see,self-esteem crimes are always committed by members of the ‘dominant five percent’ – and, moreover, by the type van Vogt called Right Men. (There may beexamples of serial killers who are not Right Men or members of the dominant fiveper cent, but not one has been encountered in this study.) The attitude of thedominant male towards women is always predatory, especially towards non-dominantwomen. In Hermann Hesse’s novel Steppenwolf – about a lonely ‘outsider’ – a poemwritten by the hero captures this attitude perfectly:The lovely creature I would so treasure,And feast myself deep on her tender thigh,I would drink of her red blood full measure,Then howl till the night went by.In the late nineteenth century there were just as many frustrated,high-dominance working-class males in the world, but poor education and the gapbetween social classes kept them ‘in their place’. By the mid-twentieth centuryincreasing literacy and the erosion of class barriers meant that increasingnumbers of these males were able to articulate their resentment. Some of thesehad the kind of traumatic childhood that seems typical of serial killers –lonely, physically abused, unwanted by parents, accident-prone (often sufferinghead injuries) and obsessed by sexual fantasies – and the result was bound tobe, sooner or later, a sex-crime explosion. This is what we have witnessed inthe last four decades of the twentieth century, and there seems no reason toassume that the early decades of the twenty-first century will show anyimprovement – on the contrary, it seems inevitable that Europe will followAmerica into the age of serial murder. Joel Norris speaks optimistically aboutthe development of ‘profiles that could lead to the development of a diagnosticor prediction instrument’; but although we have seen how psychological profilingcan be used to trap serial killers, it seems unlikely that it will ever enablepsychiatrists to recognise them in time to prevent them from becoming killers.The best we can hope is that social changes will eventually remove theconditions that incubate the type.What this means, unfortunately, is that there is no simple short-term solutionto the problem of the serial killer, any more than there has ever been a simplesolution to the problem of crime and violence. The long-term solution, for ourdescendants of the twenty-first century, would be to attack the basic causes:‘overcrowded rat’ syndrome, child abuse, social frustration. We have seen that,so far, all serial killers have emerged from the same social group – the workingclass or lower middle class – and in that case, the theoretical solution wouldbe to improve social conditions until some of the worst features havedisappeared. Theoretically, a Utopian society with a low birth rate, ampleliving space and a high general level of prosperity should cease to produceserial killers. However, until we have learned to control the populationexplosion, such a society is obviously no more than a pleasant daydream.Nevertheless, it is worth recalling the story of how the eighteenth centurycrime explosion in England was brought under control by the novelist HenryFielding. When Fielding became a magistrate in 1748, at the age of forty-one,London was swarming with footpads and robber gangs, and the roads were infestedwith highwaymen. With no police force except part-time parish constables, theLondon criminal had never known any organised opposition. Fielding suggested toParliament that it should vote him six hundred pounds to try to stop the crimewave and the money was granted. He next organised a group of parish constables,all of who knew the most notorious thieves by sight. Victims of robberies wereurged to hurry to Fielding’s house in Bow Street, from which ‘thief-takers’would set out in hot pursuit. (This is why they became known as Bow StreetRunners.) Fielding describes his satisfaction as newspaper reports of robberiesdiminished day by day, until eventually they ceased altogether. As the roadssurrounding London were patrolled by heavily armed constables on horseback,burglars and highwaymen who were accustomed to immunity hastened to moveelsewhere. In putting a stop to London’s crime wave, Fielding used only half thesix hundred pounds.The lesson – known to every police officer – is that in controlling crime,prevention is better than cure, or at least more immediately effective. In thisrespect, the advances in crime detection that have occurred since the 1970s areeven more impressive then those of the Bow Street Runners. In 1986 special agentRoger Depue, then head of the FBI Behavioral Science Instruction and ResearchUnit and Administrator of the NCAVC, expressed the new sense of optimism when hedeclared: ‘The concerted efforts of the US Congress, the Department of Justiceand Federal, State and local justice agencies to bring violent crime undercontrol have made a difference in America. They have contributed to slowing thedownward spiral, and increasing the risk for the violent offender. The NCAVC wasborn out of these national efforts and represents the new feeling in America. Weare not only going to fight back – we are going to win.’--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/chapter_008.xhtml#fn001] A Criminal History of Mankind, page 605,Colin Wilson, 1984.2 [../Text/chapter_008.xhtml#fn002] Between 1750 and 1800 the population ofEurope rose from 147 million to 187 million."},{"pageContent":"NineUpdateTHE AIM OF this book has not been to simply retell the histories of known serialkillers, but to provide the reader with an understanding of what creates anddrives such a predator. Serial murder is a social aberration that has arisenwithin the last two hundred years and – thanks to modern forensic policing andbehavioural science – might effectively cease to happen within the nextgeneration or so. Other once universal forms of crime have been driven out ofexistence by both technology and society’s willingness to combat themcreatively; banditry and slavery, to name just two. So it is not too much tohope that the serial killer might soon go the way of the Viking raider and theRoman gladiator: a gruesome evidence of human cruelty, only to be found in thepages of history books.Until that happy day, however, there are always new cases to record and oldcases to update . . .Andrei ChikatiloThe Russian Andrei Chikatilo operated throughout the 1980s, mostly around thecity of Rostov on Don. He was able to go on killing for such a long periodlargely because of the Soviet policy of refusing to give publicity to criminalcases, in a futile effort to convince the world that, compared to the decadentWest, Russia was virtually free of crime. The result was that the citizens ofRostov were unaware that Russia’s worst serial killer was working in theirmidst, and therefore had no chance to take precautions, or to warn theirchildren about plausible strangers.Andrei Chikatilo was born in the farming village of Yablochnoye, in the Ukraine,on 6 October 1936. Ukrainians are an ethnic minority in Russia, and because somany peasants opposed ‘collective farming’, Stalin treated them as his personalenemies; millions died in the starvation of the early 30s. Chikatilo’s familywere very poor and lived in a one-room hut; his parents worked hard in thefields for very little pay.Medical examination of Chikatilo after his arrest showed abnormal electricalactivity of the brain which dated from birth – ‘probably the result of somethingthat happened in the uterus.’ His skull was slightly hydrocephalic, the pupilsof his eyes of different sizes, and when he stuck out his tongue, it came out tothe right-hand side.In spite of these abnormalities, Chikatilo was in no way mentally sub-normal,and was a good student at school, and undoubtedly of a high IQ. He was fond ofhis father, a kind, easy-going man, but his mother, Anna, was a virago who nevershowed affection, either for Chikatilo or for his sister Tatyana, seven yearshis junior. She had been dead almost twenty years at the time of her son’sarrest.When Chikatilo was five, his mother told him about a male cousin who hadvanished two years before his birth, and who – according to her – was killed andeaten by starving peasants. (According to his sister, it was an older brotherwho had vanished.) This, Chikatilo claimed, preyed on his mind and promoted atendency to morbidity.During the war – when the Ukraine was occupied by Germans – Chikatilo saw theaftermath of a bombing raid, with dismembered corpses and pools of blood. Helater told a psychiatrist that when he saw this, he experienced an excitementthat was almost sexual.This underlying sadism was reinforced by an immensely popular novel of thepost-war period, Molodaya Gvardiya (The Young Guard), which was about patrioticyoung communists who fought against Nazism. They were shown beating up Germansand throwing them down mine shafts, and Chikatilo enjoyed indulging in revengefantasies based on the novel. He saw himself as a young partisan who torturedGerman prisoners for information. And he later told in interrogators that duringhis first murder, he experienced a ‘high’ that made him feel like a youngpartisan. In the novel, all the young partisans are finally killed, whichintroduced an undertone of masochism into his fantasies.In his teens, he began to grow large and powerful – his new nickname was ‘AndreiSila’, meaning ‘Andrew the Strong’. He read voraciously, and displayed aprodigious memory. At sixteen he became editor of the school newspaper, and wasappointed school ‘agitator for political information’, which entailed readingaloud (and explaining) articles from Pravda. But he remained virtuallyfriendless, and was paralysingly shy with the opposite sex. When, on oneoccasion, he found a more-than-willing girl, he was so terrified that he wasunable to achieve an erection. He became convinced that he was impotent andwould never have a normal sex live. This only increased the morbid intensity ofhis masturbation fantasies.At eighteen he tried to enter Moscow University to study law, but was turneddown because – he believed – of his father’s war record. Instead he trained asan engineer at technical college. After a two-year course he was sent by theYoung Communist League to work in a factory in the dreary town of Nizhno-Tagil.Again he tried sex with local girls, but always failed at the crucial moment.The only time he succeeded achieving sexual satisfaction was when a girl triedpushing him away; he held her tight as she struggled, and found that herstruggle induced an orgasm.There were three years of national service – during which he joined theCommunist Party – followed by a job as a telephone engineer in a small town nearRostov. Once his fellow engineers saw him masturbating in the woods – his shortsightedness made him unaware that they were within sight – and it was yetanother humiliation to increase his deep self-pity.When he was 27, his sister Tatyana – now married – decided to become amatchmaker, and introduced him to a shy girl called Fayina who was looking for ahusband. His timidity gradually vanished and they married. But on their weddingnight, he was impotent as usual – it was a long time before he could succeed inintercourse, and even then, it was seldom more than four times a year. Twochildren – a boy and a girl – were born.After obtaining a degree in Russian philology and literature from RostovUniversity in 1971, Chikatilo found himself a job as a schoolteacher inNovoshakhtinsk, in the coalfields. He was a hopelessly bad teacher; awkward,irritable, and inclined to mumble.He soon began to enter the dormitories of teenage girls when they were in theirunderwear; several described him masturbating with his hand in his trouserpocket. In May 1973, swimming with a fifteen-year-old pupil, he was unable torestrain himself from fondling her breasts and genitals, and her screams excitedhim even more. In 1974, he was forced to resign from his job, but no mention ofthe reason was made in his work record.He found a job in Shakhti at a technical school, where his youngest pupils werefifteen, and for a while kept out of trouble. But in 1978, he went into theboys’ dormitory in the middle of the night, pulled back the bedclothes of afifteen year old, and began to suck his penis. The boy woke up. When Chikatilotried to repeat this two nights later, the boys were all waiting for him anddrove him away. As usual, he remained isolated and disliked, both by pupils andcolleagues, while his neighbours found him a thoroughly unpleasant man.It was at this time that he bought his small hut at the other end of the town,and began picking up female down-and-outs and trying to entice children there.And in December of that year, 1978, he committed his first murder – that ofnine-year-old Lena Zakotnova. He started a conversation with her as she waswalking home from school; when she revealed that she desperately needed to go tothe toilet, he persuaded her to go into his shack. There he hurled her to theground and began tearing off her clothes. But even when she was subdued, hefailed to achieve an erection to have sex with her. He ejaculated anyway, andpushed the semen into her with his fingers, rupturing her hymen. The bloodfilled him with excitement, and he pulled out a penknife and stabbed herrepeatedly. Afterwards he carried her body to a nearby stream and threw it in.Although Chikatilo was questioned nine times by the police, another man with arecord of sex crime, Aleksandr Kravchenko, was arrested for the murder, andexecuted.Chikatilo committed his next murder almost three years later, in September 1981.He met seventeen-year-old Larisa Tkachenko at a bus stop, and persuaded her towalk with him to nearby woods. She was almost certainly willing to have sex withhim, but he was too excited. He threw her down, bludgeoned her with his heavyfists, and choked her to death. Then he bit off one of her nipples andejaculated over the corpse.This murder established the pattern for all Chikatilo’s later murders – over 50of them. He would lure someone to the woods, batter them into submission,usually stab them to death, achieve a climax, then leave the body covered withleaves or buried in a shallow grave.In the following year, he committed seven murders – five of these girls, rangingin age from ten to nineteen, and two boys, aged fifteen and nineteen. As hecontinued to kill, Chikatilo became increasingly sadistic. He liked to inflictdozens of stab wounds on his victims, none serious enough to kill, to bite outthe tongues, and to emasculate the boys. He is known, on many occasions, to havecarried cooking equipment with him, and may have practised cannibalism.By the end of the following summer, 1983, the number of his victims hadincreased to fourteen, and the Rostov police began the hunt for a sex killer.But, shielded by public ignorance, Chikatilo went on to kill three more timesthat year – two women and a fourteen-year-old boy. By September 1984, his totalhad risen to 32.Chikatilo’s method was to hang around train stations and travel on buses, tryingto make pick-ups. On 13 September 1984, a police inspector followed Chikatilofor hours, watching him accost women, and even being fellated by one of hispick-ups on a bench. He arrested him, and felt certain that he had caught themurderer when he discovered a knife, a rope and a jar of vaseline in hisbriefcase. Yet Chikatilo was saved by a strange chance – he was one of thoserare people whose blood group was different from the group of his semen – hisblood was type A, his semen type AB. Unaware of this, the police decided torelease him.For nine months he stopped killing, then was driven by his compulsion to startagain. He killed prostitutes, and young boys and girls – one boy was only nine.By late 1990 the number of victims had reached 53, and the hunt for the serialkiller was being organised from Moscow. The police set up surveillance patrolson small railway stations near wooded areas. When the body of a 22-year-oldwoman was found in woods near Donleskhoz station on 13 October 1990, a policemanrecalled interviewing a suspicious-looking man a week earlier. He had asked foridentification, and been given a passport that bore the name Andrei Chikatilo.The policeman had sent in a report but – typically – it had been lost.When police learned that Chikatilo had been questioned about the murder ofnine-year-old Lena Zakotnova in 1978, they were fairly certain they had theirman. He was arrested on 20 November 1990, and when his semen group was tested,it was proved to be AB, like that of the murderer. Soon Chikatilo confessed, andeven led the police to bodies that had never been found.His trial opened on 14 April 1992; Chikatilo, kept in a cage to protect him frompublic fury, raged and shouted at the court, and even waved his penis at thepublic, shouting: ‘Look at this useless thing! What could I do with that?’He was sentenced to death on 14 October for 52 murders, and on 14 February 1994was executed by a pistol shot in the back of the head.Jeffrey DahmerJeffrey Dahmer, a homosexual killer, was dominated by the same morbidcompulsions as Chikatilo: but while Chikatilo enjoyed torturing living victims,Dahmer was fascinated by the dead.Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer, born 21 May 1960, had killed seventeen young men, twelveof them in his apartment in Milwaukee, between March 1988 and his arrest on 22July 1991. On that evening, a slim black man ran out of Oxford Apartmentsshouting for help, and stopped a police car. He was wearing a handcuff on onewrist, and said that a white youth had threatened to kill him. Police went toapartment 213, and were met by a tall, good-looking young man, who apologisedfor causing a disturbance. Noticing an unpleasant odour of decay, the policeforced their way in. When one of them opened the door of the refrigerator, hewas shocked to find a human head. Minutes later, they found another severed headin a freezer, three skulls in a filing cabinet, and four more elsewhere. Akettle contained severed hands and severed male genitals. Packets of meat provedto be human flesh.The man who had escaped, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards, told how he had met Dahmerin a shopping mall and accepted his invitation to a ‘party’ in his apartment. AsDahmer plied him with drink, Edwards became oddly sleepy. Then Dahmer snapped ahandcuff on his wrist, and held a butcher’s knife against his chest as theywatched a video of The Exorcist. Finally, Dahmer said he intended to stripEdwards and take photographs, then to kill him and eat his heart. At that pointEdward kicked him and ran for the door, then fled for his life.At the police station, Dahmer seemed relieved to tell his story. As a child, hehad been obsessed by the dissection of animals, stripping birds and rats oftheir flesh to preserve their skeletons. Although his background was comfortablymiddle class, his parents fought violently, and they preferred his youngerbrother. At eighteen, Dahmer committed his first murder. While his parents wereaway he picked up a nineteen-year-old hitchhiker, Stephen Hicks, and took himback to the house to drink beer. When Hicks finally said he had to go, Dahmerbegged him to stay, and, when he refused, picked up a dumbbell and knocked himunconscious, then strangled him. After that, he undressed him and masturbated onthe body, then dismembered it in the crawl space under the house. Later, afterburying it, he dug it up and smashed the bones into fragments with a hammer.During the next nine years Dahmer joined the army, but was discharged fordrunkenness – he had been a heavy drinker since his school days. He moved inwith his grandmother in West Allis, near Milwaukee, and found himself a job in achocolate factory. He also discovered gay bars, where he was known as amonosyllabic loner. It was there that he began slipping drugs into drinks, oftenleaving his drinking companion unconscious. He was banned from one bar for doingthis.In 1986 he was in trouble with the law for exposing himself to two boys, and puton probation. On 15 September 1987 he committed his second murder. After goingto bed with a 24-year-old man, Stephen Tuomi, in a hotel, he strangled him inthe night. He managed to remove the body in a large suitcase, and dismembered itin the basement in his grandmother’s house. He left it out in garbage bags forcollection.Between January 1988 and July 1991 he committed fifteen more murders. The methodwas basically much the same. He picked up a young male, usually black, andinvited him home – either to his grandmother’s, or, after she had asked him toleave, to his own apartment on N. 24th Street. There the victim was knocked outwith a drugged drink, then violated and strangled. The body was thendismembered, parts kept for cooking and eating, and the rest left out in garbagebags.All Dahmer’s confessions were sensational; but the story of one teenage victimwas so appalling that it created outrage around the world. On 26 May 1991,fourteen-year-old Laotian Konerak Sinthasomphone had met Dahmer in front of thesame shopping mall where the killer was later to pick up Tracy Edwards; the boyagreed to return to Dahmer’s apartment to allow him to take a couple ofphotographs.Unknown to Konerak, Dahmer was the man who had enticed and sexually assaultedhis elder brother Keison three years earlier. Dahmer had asked thethirteen-year-old boy back to his apartment in September 1988, and had slipped apowerful sleeping draught into his drink, then fondled him sexually. Somehow,the boy had succeeded in staggering out into the street and back home. Thepolice were notified, and Dahmer was charged with second degree sexual assaultand sentenced to a year in a correction programme, which allowed him to continueto work in the chocolate factory.Now the younger brother Konerak found himself in the same apartment. He was alsogiven drugged coffee, and then, when he was unconscious, stripped and raped.After that, Dahmer went out to buy some beer. On his way back to the apartment,Dahmer saw, to his horror, that his naked victim was talking to two blackteenage girls, obviously begging for help. Dahmer hurried up and tried to grabthe boy, but the girls clung on to him. One of them succeeded in ringing thepolice, and two squad cars arrived within minutes. Three irritable policeofficers wanted to know what the trouble was about.When Dahmer told them that the young man was his lover, that they lived togetherin the nearby apartments, and that they had merely had a quarrel, the policemenwere inclined to believe him because he looked sober and Konerak looked drunk.So they left the youth in Dahmer’s apartment – to be strangled, violated anddismembered.When Dahmer was released from the correctional centre in March 1990 – where hewas serving his sentence for the assault on the elder Sinthasomphone brother –he had already murdered five times. On 13 March 1990 he moved into the OxfordApartments. During the next eighteen months he would kill twelve more victims,the last three in just over two weeks, between 5 July 1991 and 22 July 1991,when he was arrested.After his seventh murder – that of a black homosexual named Eddie Smith on 14June 1990 – Dahmer came very close to being caught again. He invited afifteen-year-old hispanic youth back to his apartment, but instead of drugginghim, tried to knock him unconscious with a rubber mallet, then to strangle him.The youth fought back, and somehow managed to calm his attacker. Incredibly,Dahmer let him go, after making him promise not to notify the police. But inhospital, the youth broke his promise. However, when he begged the police not tolet his foster parents know he was homosexual, they decided to do nothing aboutit.Dahmer came to court in January 1992, charged with fifteen murders. After beingsentenced to fifteen terms of life imprisonment, he commented: ‘I couldn’t findany meaning for my life when I was out there. I’m sure as hell not going to findit in here.’Dahmer was murdered in Wisconsin jail on 28 November 1994. He was hit on thehead with an iron bar by fellow convict Christopher Scarver, who believed he wasthe Son of God.Aileen WuornosAileen (‘Lee’) Wuornos has been described as the world’s first female serialkiller, but this is not strictly accurate. To begin with, there have been others– Anna Zwanziger, Jeanne Weber, Belle Gunness. But secondly, Aileen Wuornos wasnot a serial killer within the definition offered in this book: an obsessive‘repeat killer’ driven by sex. Her motive in killing seven men was robbery.Two days before Christmas in 1989, two friends came upon a badly decomposed bodyin woods near Ormond Beach, Florida; it was identified as a 51-year-oldelectrician named Richard Mallory. He had been shot four times with a .22revolver.During the next twelve months, five more victims were found in almost identicalcircumstances: David Spears, 43 (1 June 1990), Charles Carskaddon, 40 (6 June1990), Troy Burress, 50 (4 August 1990), Charles Humphreys, 56 (12 September1990), and Walter Gino Antonio (19 November 1990). All had been killed in ornear their cars, and money and valuables stolen. The same handgun had been usedin all six killings. A 65-year-old part-time missionary, Peter Seims, had alsovanished in early June.On 4 July 1990, a car that was being driven too fast skidded off the road inMarion County, Florida, and ended in a field. Witnesses saw two women, one talland blonde, the other short and brunette, get out and hurry away. The car provedto belong to the missing missionary, Peter Seims. Sketches were made from thedescriptions of witnesses, and published in the press. Members of the publictipped off the police that the pair were probably Tyria (‘Ty’) J. Moore, 28, andher live-in lover, 34-year-old Aileen (‘Lee’) Wuornos.Then the police found some of the belongings of the first victim, RichardMallory, in a pawn shop. The pawn ticket bore a thumb print – obligatory inFlorida – that proved to belong to Lee Wuornos.Lee Wuornos was known as a hard-drinking butch lesbian who made a living as aprostitute, and spent her time playing pool in sleazy bars with long-hairedmotorcyclists. She was arrested on 9 January 1991 outside a bar. Tyria Moore waslocated at her sister’s home in Pennsylvania, but not arrested – the police hadsoon ascertained that she had been elsewhere at the time of most of the murders.In return for immunity from prosecution as accessory after the fact, Ty led thepolice to the creek where Lee Wuornos had thrown the .22 revolver used in themurders. She then made bugged phone calls to her lover, urging her to confess.Lee, who was clearly deeply in love with Ty, finally agreed. On 16 January 1991,she made a three-hour video-taped confession to murdering the seven men –including Seims, whose body was never found.Aileen Carol Wuornos had been brought up by her grandfather and grandmother – inTroy, Michigan – whom she believed to be her real parents; she was unaware thather mother had deserted her when she was a baby. She was also unaware that hertrue father was a child rapist who had hanged himself in prison. Her motherwalked out on her two babies because she was unable to cope. Lee’s grandparents– both Finnish immigrants – were heavy drinkers, and her grandfather was afoul-tempered disciplinarian who turned her into a rebel who hated authority.Lee herself was highly dominant, and had a quick temper. At the age of elevenshe lost her virginity to a local youth. Then, discovering that sex gave herpower over boys, she plunged into it with an enthusiasm that soon earned her areputation as the neighbourhood tart. She introduced her elder brother Keith toincest. And one local boy was surprised – and delighted – when a pretty girl inshorts slipped him a note offering a ‘suck and fuck’ in exchange for a packet ofcigarettes. The eighteen-year-old youth who served in the local cigarette storeoften bartered a packet of cigarettes for oral sex in the back room. When theyoung man boasted about it to a group of friends, he was mortified to learn thatLee had performed the same service for all of them earlier the same day.When she was fourteen, Lee became pregnant – she claimed she had been raped byan older man, but this seems doubtful. (Later she was even to name her brotheras the baby’s father.) In the local maternity hospital, a caseworker made thememorable comment that Lee had ‘no concern for the future, only for what todaywould bring’.Lee lacked self-control. When she lost her temper, she poured out a stream offoul language. She always carried a knife, and once, in a rage, screamed thatshe had already killed someone and chopped them up, then buried them in a field.It was something of a relief to the rest of the family when she drifted down toFlorida.Married at the age of twenty to a man nearly 50 years her senior, she was soondivorced due to her habit of spending the whole day in bars playing pool. Atabout this time, Aileen announced that she had discovered she was gay. Therefollowed an affair with a woman called Toni. But her temper and her drunkennessmade all her relationships brief. When, in 1981, she robbed a late-nightsupermarket, netting $35, she received three years in a correctional centre.When she finally left Michigan, after her brother’s death from cancer, shehitch-hiked to Colorado and quickly found her way to bars frequented by bikers.She enjoyed the sensation of being a ‘biker’s moll’, a female outlaw riding onthe back of a motorcycle and defying the world. One night she passed out fromalcohol, and woke to find herself naked and tied to a bed; the whole gang hadtaken advantage of her while she was unconscious. Yet even this failed to upsether Bonnie-and-Clyde image of herself as the female outlaw.For the next few years she continued to live out this image – working as aprostitute, getting arrested again and again for drink-driving, carrying aconcealed weapon and brawling. Then, in June 1986, she found what she had beenlooking for all her life – someone to love.She met Tyria (pronounced Tyra) Moore in a gay bar in Daytona Beach. Tyria wasanything but good-looking, being overweight and big chinned, but she was stable,caring, and easy to get along with. Ty and Lee were instantly attracted to oneanother, and that same night Ty took Lee back to her bedroom. For almost threedays they stayed in bed together, going out only to purchase a large dildo.The relationship was basically that of man and wife, with Lee as the husband. Tywas working as a motel maid but Lee made her give it up; she would support her.Now, suddenly, she had an aim in life. Ty was both her wife and her child, andevoked an unselfishness that Lee was probably unaware she possessed.Yet although this relationship gave her life new meaning, there was one majorproblem. A prostitute’s stock-in-trade is her physical attractiveness. Now inher 30s, Lee was grossly overweight, and her face showed the ravages of heroutbursts of fury. It was becoming harder to pick up clients and she oftenaccepted a mere $10 or $20 for sex. Yet she often hitch-hiked with johns whoobviously had hundreds of dollars in their wallets. There was only one objectionto turning highway-robber – that she would soon be recognised and caught. Butthere was an alluring alternative: to kill them and then take their wallets.The drama of Lee Wuornos’ story spawned two movies, an opera and several booksbefore she was executed by lethal injection on 9 October 2002. As she was leadout of the court, following her first conviction and death sentence in 1991,Wuornos had shouted: ‘I’m going to Heaven now. You’re all going to Hell!’Shortly after her death, an anonymous joker posted a message on a website thatwas hosting an online discussion about her execution. Signed Satan, it simplyread: ‘Umm . . . Could you guys take her back?’Fred and Rose WestThe Frederick West murder case has aroused more worldwide interest than anyBritish case since Jack the Ripper.Fred West was a builder who lived in a semi-detached house in Gloucester, withhis plump and bespectacled wife Rosemary, and a large number of children, threeof them obviously half-caste. A short, powerfully built man with piercing blueeyes and a simian profile, he was known as a hard worker, devoted to DIY, andwas always adding extensions to their house, 25 Cromwell Street, where they hadbeen living since September 1972. In the early days the house had been full oflodgers, mostly men, although later lodgers were mainly female.Between August 1992 and June 1993, Fred West had been in jail, accused of rapingand sodomising one of his daughters, and the children were taken into care.During this period, his eldest daughter, 28-year-old Anne Marie (whose motherwas not Rose), described to Detective Constable Hazel Savage how she herself hadbeen taken down to the basement at the age of eight by her stepmother andfather, and deflowered with a vibrator. Her father had started having sex withher when she was nine – on at least two occasions she had been held down by herstepmother Rose, on whom she had once been made to perform cunnilingus. Itseemed that Rose also worked as a prostitute – not primarily for profit, butbecause her husband liked to watch her having sex with other men – and when AnneMarie was ten, she had also been forced to prostitute herself to male clients.(Many of these clients – particularly the black ones – were ‘freebies’, becauseRose was as obsessed by sex as her husband was, and was virtually insatiable.)Anne Marie had finally run away from home when she was fifteen, after becomingpregnant by her father. (The baby was aborted.)Together with the evidence of the daughter who had been raped, this testimony ofAnne Marie seemed to provide the police with a watertight case against both theWests. But aware of the misery of her half-brothers and sisters, who werelonging to be home, Anne Marie finally withdrew her testimony. The consequencewas that when, on 17 June 1993, Fred and Rose West stood side by side in thedock in Gloucester, they were acquitted for lack of evidence. (In fact, theiracquittal did the younger children no good, for they were kept in care.)It was a remark by one of these younger children that made Hazel Savagedetermined to pursue the case further. The child was overheard to say that theywere not allowed to talk about what went on inside 25 Cromwell Street, for fearof ‘ending up under the patio, like my sister Heather’.Heather West, the oldest child of Fred and Rose West, had not been seen sinceJune 1987, when she was sixteen. According to the Wests, she had run away with alesbian, and had gone to work in a holiday camp. But she had left herunemployment benefit uncollected, which sounded unlikely for a girl about toembark on a new life.Hazel Savage’s superiors were unhappy at the idea of digging up the Wests’garden, for if they didn’t find anything, they might sue for harassment. But thepolicewoman’s insistence finally prevailed, and on Thursday 24 February 1994,police arrived at 25 Cromwell Street with a search warrant. Fred West was atwork, repairing a roof, and was located with some difficulty. He promised tocome immediately, but in fact arrived many hours later – a delay that is stillunexplained. (The likeliest explanation is that he went to another of his murdersites to cover his tracks.) West hurried to the police station, and told areporter he met outside that he had not murdered his daughter Heather. Back atCromwell Street, Rose was telling police that she had been out shopping whenHeather had left home, so she had no first-hand knowledge of what had happened.The Wests spent a gloomy night at 25 Cromwell Street, with a policeman sittingbeside the excavation in the garden. Two of their elder children, Stephen andMae, were there to keep them company.The next day, when the police returned, Fred West unexpectedly volunteered toaccompany them to the police station. In the car, he suddenly confessed to themurder of his daughter Heather. He claimed that Heather had been jeering at himso he put his hands on her throat ‘to wipe the smirk off her face’, thenrealised she was dead. He had cut up the body with a freezer knife, and laterburied it at the bottom of the garden. He even went back to show the policewhere he had buried it. He told them they were wasting their time diggingoutside the bathroom, and directed them to the bottom of the garden.It was not until the next day, Saturday, that the diggers smelt decaying flesh,and knew they had finally found Heather. She had, as Fred had claimed, beendismembered; her nails, found apart from the skeleton, suggesting that they hadbeen pulled out, either before or after death. Certain fingers and toes werealso missing.What puzzled pathologist Dr Bernard Knight was that when he had reassembled thebones, like a jigsaw puzzle, he had a femur (thigh bone) left over. There had tobe another body down there.Told about this, West admitted that there were two more bodies buried in thegarden – one of them a former lodger, Shirley Anne Robinson, a bisexual who hadbeen carrying his baby. He was not sure of the name of the other, but referredto her as ‘Shirley’s mate’. She was buried near the bathroom wall – the spot hehad tried to direct the police away from.What had happened seems clear. Fred West had been hoping that only Heather’sremains would be found, and that he would be able to claim that it was anaccident, and serve a few years in prison for manslaughter. Now they had foundthe extra femur, he had to perform a quick exercise in damage limitation. Theyknew there had to be a second body, and would certainly go on looking after theyfound it. So it would be better to admit to a third body, and then hope theywould stop there . . .More digging uncovered ‘Shirley’s mate’ – in fact a schoolgirl called AlisonChambers, who had disappeared in 1979 (and who, in fact, had never knownShirley), and Shirley Anne Robinson. Both bodies had been decapitated, both hadmissing fingers and toes, and Shirley’s baby had been cut from the womb. It wasbecoming increasingly clear that Fred West had some morbid obsession aboutmutilation and dismemberment – a kind of ‘butchery complex’.Strongly suspecting that there were more bodies, the police now decided to digup the basement of 25 Cromwell Street – to the disgust of Rose West, whothreatened to sue for damage to her property. Five more bodies were found in thebasement, and another under the floor of the outside bath-room, in what had oncebeen the inspection pit of a garage.West continued to insist that Rose knew nothing of the murders. But the policehad reason to believe otherwise. In January 1973, both Wests had appeared incourt on a charge of sexually assaulting and causing bodily harm to aseventeen-year-old girl called Caroline Raine. In November 1972, Caroline hadbeen given a lift by the Wests and offered a job as their live-in nanny. Shestayed only six weeks, because Fred talked endlessly about sex – abortion,lesbianism and group orgies – while Rose made passes at her and walked into thebathroom when she was naked. Soon after leaving, Caroline had seen the Wests inTewkesbury, and had accepted a lift. Rose got in the back with her and begancaressing her breasts. When Caroline objected, Fred stopped the car and punchedher unconscious. She woke up with her hands tied with a scarf and her mouthtaped. She was taken back to Cromwell Street and stripped naked. Fred floggedher between the thighs with the buckle end of a belt, then, while Rose performedoral sex, Fred had sex with Rose from behind. Later, when Rose left the room,Fred raped Caroline. But the next morning they begged her to return as theirnanny. Caroline agreed because she saw that as her only chance to escape, butcalled on a friend and told her what had happened. At home, her mother, noticingher condition, persuaded her to tell the story, then rang the police.But when Fred and Rose West appeared in court in January 1973, Caroline decidednot to go through the public ordeal. The Wests were not charged with rape, butmerely with assault, and fined £50 each.The case of Caroline Raine convinced the police that Rose was an aggressivelesbian who had probably played an active part in the murders. This seemedconfirmed by the evidence of another girl – known at the trial only as ‘Miss X’– who had been in a children’s home in Gloucester, and met the Wests when shewas thirteen. She had regarded Rose as a kind of elder sister, and often went to25 Cromwell Street for tea and sympathy. Two years later, after running awayfrom the home, she called on the Wests, and was taken by Rose into a bedroomwith two naked girls. There she was stripped by Rose, and watched while one ofthe girls was taped, face downward, on the bed, and penetrated anally with avibrator. After that, Fred West raped the girl, who was obviously terrified.Then it was Miss X’s turn; she was also taped down to the bed, and some hardobject inserted in her anus, causing her to bleed. After that, Fred raped hervaginally, while Rose held his penis. Eventually, Miss X was allowed to go. Shefelt so angry and betrayed that six weeks later she took a can of petrol to thehouse, intending to set it on fire, but was unable to go through with it.By now the police were looking into other disappearances – that of Fred’s firstwife Catherine (known as Rena), Rena’s daughter Charmaine (who had last beenseen in 1971, when she was eight), and that of a friend of Rena’s named AnnaMcFall, who had lived with Fred in a caravan in the mid-1960s, and becomepregnant by him.Fred eventually admitted to these three murders, and led the police to thebodies. Charmaine was found buried under the floor at their previous lodging, 25Midland Road, in Gloucester – only a stone’s throw from Cromwell Street. Renaand Anna McFall were found buried in two adjoining fields near Fred’s childhoodhome in Much Marcle, Herefordshire.When it became clear that Fred West had been in prison – for theft – at the timewhen Charmaine vanished, detectives concluded that Rose must have killed her,and left Fred to bury her when he came out of prison in June 1971. It also beganto seem likely that West had murdered his first wife Rena because she was tryingto find out what had happened to Charmaine.All the bodies showed signs of Fred West’s strange ‘butchery complex’, withmissing fingers and toes, as well as – occasionally – other bones like kneecapsor vertebrae.But who were the victims at Cromwell Street? At first it was assumed that allhad been lodgers of the Wests, but little by little it became clear that thiswas not so.Nineteen-year-old Lynda Gough, whose body was found in the old ‘inspection pit’,was a rebellious girl who objected to her father’s attempt to dictate the kindof boyfriends she ought to go out with. In the autumn of 1972 – when the Westsfirst moved into Cromwell Street – she had met one of their lodgers, BenStanniland, in a local cafe. She returned to Cromwell Street and had sex withhim. Later she had sex with other lodgers. She also became friendly with theWests, who offered her a job as a nanny.On 19 April 1973, she left a note for her parents saying she had found a flat,and would come and see them. But they never saw her again. When her mother, JuneGough, heard that she knew the Wests, she called at 25 Cromwell Street. RoseWest came to the door, and Mrs Gough recognised the slippers she was wearing asLynda’s. But Rose claimed that Lynda had left and gone to find a job inWeston-super-Mare.According to Geoffrey Wansell in An Evil Love, based on West’s own confessions,Lynda Gough became at first a willing partner in the Wests’ sexual experiments.These soon extended into sadism and masochism. Finally, Lynda was suspended byher ankles over a hole in the cellar floor, and sexually abused. ‘Other peoplemay well have been invited to have sexual intercourse with this helpless girl,’Wansell says. Finally, Lynda was tortured. ‘Her fingers and toes were almostcertainly cut off while she was conscious, and her hands and wrists shortlyafterwards. Both her kneecaps were removed, as were seven ribs and herbreastbone.’ Wansell believes all this happened while she was alive – but thesimple truth is that no one knows.Not long after murdering Lynda, the Wests deflowered eight-year-old Anne Marie.She was Fred’s eldest daughter; her mother was his first wife Rena. One day inthe summer of 1973, Anne Marie was taken down to the basement and undressed.There, her hands were tied above her head and attached to some iron object, agag was tied round her mouth, and her legs were tied apart. She was in theclassic pose that sadists love: the helpless victim. Then a vibrator wasinserted inside her, causing pain that seemed to go on for ever. She looked downat a glass bowl between her legs, into which blood was dripping. Then they lefther like that while they vanished upstairs – almost certainly to have sex –before returning and repeating the torture. When finally released, she limpedaway, hardly able to walk. Rose laughed, finding it funny. Later, she told AnneMarie: ‘All parents do it to their daughters – it’s a father’s job.’A few weeks later, after her ninth birthday, her father began having sex withher.The Wests’ next victim was picked up that November, as she was walking home toher grandmother’s after a visit to the cinema with a boyfriend. She wasfifteen-year-old Carole Anne Cooper, known as Caz. Like so many of the Wests’victims, she was the child of a broken home, and her father and stepmother hadplaced her in a children’s home in Worcester. After being taken back to 25Cromwell Street and bundled into the basement, she had been used as a sexualplaything, and probably flogged and tortured. She was killed – most likely by aviolent blow to the back of the head – and then buried in the cellar where AnneMarie had been deflowered.The next murder seems to have been a crime of opportunity. Twenty-one-year-oldLucy Partington was a student of medieval literature at Exeter University, and aniece of the novelist Kingsley Amis. Her parents had separated, and she hadspent Christmas with her mother and stepfather in the pleasant village ofGretton, Gloucestershire. Gretton happens to be a few miles from Bishop’sCleeve, where Rose West’s parents lived. Lucy had spent the evening of 27December 1973 with a friend in Cheltenham, and was waiting for the last bus whenthe Wests drove by, almost certainly returning from a day at Bishop’s Cleeve.Lucy was offered a lift, or perhaps dragged into the car, and taken back toCromwell Street. It is possible that she was kept alive for several days, for on3 January 1974, Fred West went to the local hospital with a bad cut on his hand,which may have been sustained when he was hacking up Lucy’s body. Lucy was alsoburied in the cellar. West explained the increasing stench to lodgers by blaminga broken sewer.During the next two years, three more victims joined Caroline Cooper and LucyPartington under the floor: 21-year-old Therese Seigenthaler, a Swiss sociologystudent who was hitch-hiking to north Wales, who vanished on 16 April 1974;fifteen-year-old Shirley Hubbard, a shop assistant, who vanished on 14 November1974; and eighteen-year-old Juanita Mott, a factory worker who vanished on 12April 1975. In the past, Juanita had visited a boyfriend who lodged at 25Cromwell Street, and may well have called there on the day she vanished. Whenher body was found, she had been elaborately gagged with nylon tights and a bra,and bound with a plastic clothes line in a manner that suggested she had beensuspended from a beam in the ceiling. (Later, the police would discover holes intwo beams in the Wests’ basement.)There was now no room for any more bodies in the cellar, and we do not knowwhether, during the rest of 1975 and in 1976 and 1977, the Wests went on killingand buried the victims elsewhere. But we do know that in the spring of 1977,Rose West picked up a teenage prostitute named Shirley Anne Robinson in aGloucester pub. Shirley was yet another product of a broken home who had beentaken into care, then turned to shoplifting and prostitution. She had hadlesbian girlfriends but, like Rose, was bisexual. Rose invited her to move into25 Cromwell Street, where she became the lover of both Fred and Rose. In October1977, she realised she was pregnant, and Fred was delighted. He told onevisitor: ‘This is my wife, and this’ (pointing to Shirley) ‘is my lover.’Shirley wrote to her father in Germany, saying that she had never been so happy,and enclosed a photograph of her and Fred, with the comment: ‘This is the man Iam going to marry.’This, fairly certainly, is why Shirley became the next victim – the first to beburied in the garden. Fred told his brother-in-law: ‘Shirley’s mooning about meall the time . . . She’s got to fucking go.’ On 10 May 1978, when Shirley waseight months pregnant, she vanished. The Wests told the other lodgers that shehad gone to join her father in Germany.Sixteen-year-old Alison Chambers was the last of the Wests’ murder victims inthe 1970s. Again, she was the child of a broken home, and had been taken intocare. She ran away from the children’s home a few weeks before her seventeenthbirthday, and moved in with the Wests. From there she wrote to her family sayingthat she had met a ‘nice, homely family’, and that when she was seventeen, shewould go to live on a farm they owned. But Alison did not live to see herseventeenth birthday. When her body was found in the garden in 1994, many boneswere missing, including her kneecaps, two ribs, ankles and toes, and somevertebrae. West had obviously enjoyed practising his perverse trade of humanbutchery once more.It was their next – possibly their final – victim who was to lead to theirdownfall. Heather was the eldest child of Fred and Rose West, and – for manyyears – their favourite. But when she was thirteen, her father began to ask whenshe intended to get rid of her virginity, and to suggest that he was the rightperson to do it. He was also making advances to Heather’s sister Mae, whostopped wearing a skirt because of her father’s habit of putting his hand up it.He also liked to remove her blouse and bra, and caress her breasts. Heather andMae kept watch for one another when they had a shower, for their father liked tocome in and caress them around the shower curtain. He also filled their bedroomwalls with holes, so he could watch them undressing. (Mae had lost her virginityto a male visitor when she was eight.)When she was sixteen, Heather confided to a schoolfriend that her father made ahabit of coming into her bedroom at night and forcing sex on her. When she leftschool, she hoped to find a job in a holiday camp in Torquay, and when this fellthrough, she cried all night. The following day – 19 June 1987 – she vanished.Her parents told her brothers and sisters that she had run away with a lesbian,and occasionally Rose pretended to answer the phone to Heather, and held longconversations with her.And so life continued, apparently normally, until that day in August 1992, whenWest raped another of his daughters, and was arrested. The children were takeninto care, and one of them was overheard to say that his sister was buried underthe patio . . .Now Fred West was under arrest, the newspapers lost no time in exploring hisbackground. They learned that he had been born in 1941 and brought up on a farmcottage in Much Marcle, Herefordshire, until he was forced to leave home at theage of nineteen after being charged with impregnating his thirteen-year-oldsister. West’s father Walter had, it seemed, also felt that his daughters werehis own sexual property, often telling them: ‘I made you; I can do what I likewith you.’ West’s mother, Daisy, had retaliated by taking her son into her bedwhen he was twelve.But the crucial events of Fred West’s adolescence were undoubtedly two headaccidents, the first of which took place when he was seventeen, and crashed intoa wall on his motorbike. He was unconscious for nearly a week, and his familynoticed the change in his disposition: he became broody and silent, withexplosive outbursts of temper. When he was nineteen, he put his hand up theskirt of a girl as they were standing on the platform of a fire escape; shepushed him down, and he was unconscious for 24 hours.Head injury has played an important part in the lives of many murderers,including Joseph Vacher, Fritz Haarmann, Earle Nelson, Albert Fish, RaymondFernandez, Richard Speck, Gary Heidnik, John Gacy, Henry Lee Lucas and RandyKraft, and one writer states that Ted Bundy was injured at birth by a forcepsdelivery. It seems certain that the two head injuries were responsible forturning Fred West into a serial killer.It was unfortunate that a sex maniac like Fred West should have met anymphomaniac like Rose Letts. Twelve years his junior, she was born in Devon in1953; her father, an electrician, was a typical ‘Right Man’ who treated his wifeand family with brutal harshness. Bill Letts was also a pedophile who isbelieved to have initiated a sexual relationship with his daughter in her earlyyears. When Rose was fourteen, she seduced her eleven-year-old brother Graham.Soon after this, she had an affair with a 30-year-old man. Rose was alreadyfully sexually experienced when she met Fred West at the age of fifteen, in1969.He had been married to Scots born Rena Costello since 1962; she had been ajuvenile delinquent and a prostitute. After a period of living in Glasgow, whereFred worked as an ice-cream vendor, they had moved to a caravan near Gloucester.It was there that West took a job as a butcher – a job that must haveintensified his obsession with dismemberment.Rena was already pregnant – with Charmaine – when she met Fred; Charmaine’sfather was an Asian bus driver. When, in the spring of 1966, Rena returned toGlasgow because of Fred’s violence and brutality, her friend Anna McFall stayedbehind and became West’s mistress. She was pregnant with West’s baby when shevanished in the spring of 1967; her body was found in Fingerpost Field, nearMuch Marcle, in June 1994. She was almost certainly the first of West’s victims.The second, West later confessed, was a fifteen-year-old waitress named MaryBastholm, who worked in a Gloucester cafe where West was doing some buildingwork; she vanished on 6 January 1968, and her body has never been found.In the following year, West met Rosemary Letts, who had just left school. He wasliving in a caravan in her home village, Bishop’s Cleeve, and she soon becamehis mistress. She seems to have agreed to take part in West’s favouriteperversion, voyeurism, in this case allowing Fred to watch while she had sexwith his workmates. By the time they moved into 25 Midland Road, Gloucester, inthe spring of 1970, the sixteen-year-old Rose was already a prostitute. Sheconfided this to a neighbour, Liz Agius, a young mother who lived next door.Fred also confided to Liz that he would like to tie her up, beat her, and makelove to her.One day, after a cup of tea, Liz Agius felt oddly drowsy and fell deeply asleep.When she woke up, she was naked in bed with both the Wests, and Fred admittedthat he had raped her while she was drugged. Apparently Mrs Agius was not toooffended, for she remained a friend of the Wests for long after.In November 1970, West was sentenced to prison for the theft of some tyres. Itwas while he was in prison that eight-year-old Charmaine vanished – almostcertainly strangled by Rose in a fit of temper. (Rose’s own children, Stephenand Mae, later wrote a book called Inside 25 Cromwell Street, in which they talkabout her ungovernable temper, and how she would administer brutal beatings toboth of them – apparently achieving some sexual enjoyment from it.)In September 1972, the Wests moved into 25 Cromwell Street. Just over two monthslater, they abducted Caroline Raine, beginning their career of sadism and rape.After West’s arrest, his son Stephen often visited him in prison. West hadbecome lachrymose and sentimental. At first he seemed to believe that he mightescape with a ten-year sentence, and be back living in Cromwell Street in sevenyears. As he finally came to grasp that he faced a life in prison, he becameincreasingly depressed. He admitted to Stephen that there were many bodiesburied elsewhere, and claimed that he had tortured and raped his victims on afarm, only having sex with them after they were dead. But this could well havebeen an attempt to protect Rose, who had by now been charged with ten of themurders, although West insisted that she knew nothing about them. He was alsoupset that Rose seemed to have turned against him, announcing publicly that shehated him and wished him dead.On New Year’s Day, 1995, West made the ultimate sacrifice for Rose, and hangedhimself in Winson Green prison, Birmingham. He told her in a letter found in hiscell: ‘I haven’t got you a present. All I have is my life. I will give it toyou . . .’Rose West’s solicitor announced to the press that the case against her hadalways been flimsy, and that now it was flimsier still. It certainly seemed thatthe evidence against her was purely circumstantial. But the police knewsomething of which the general public were unaware: that Rose had taken part inthe rape of Caroline Raine and ‘Miss X’, as well as playing an active part insexual assaults on Anne Marie. The DPP was fairly certain that when these factswere known, a jury would have no difficulty in deciding that Rose West hadplayed an active part in the murders.They were correct. When the trial opened in Winchester on 3 October 1995, thedefence, led by Richard Ferguson QC, made a determined attempt to have thisevidence excluded. The judge, Mr Justice Mantell, rejected this, pointing outthat if one of Bluebeard’s wives had escaped, her evidence would have beenhighly relevant to the prosecution’s case.This decision was the turning point of the trial. It would last seven weeks,until 22 November, but in effect it was all over. Once these three women gavetheir evidence, revealing Rose West as an active participant in sadism and rape,it became impossible to believe that she had known nothing of the murders atCromwell Street. On 22 November 1995, she was sentenced to life imprisonment.Inevitably, the West case brings to mind that of Gerald Gallego and CharleneWilliams (described in Chapter 6). When this book was written, the only accountof the case was a book called All His Father’s Sins, by Ray Biondi and WaltHecox. Since then, Venom in the Blood by Eric van Hoffmann offers an in-depthstudy that makes it clear that Charlene was not the innocent victim that Biondiand Hecox suggest – that, on the contrary, her part in the murders was notunlike that of Rosemary West in the Gloucester case. According to Hoffmann,Charlene Williams was a bisexual nymphomaniac, and it was she who suggestedkidnapping girls. All the victims were forced to have sex with Charlene as wellas Gallego – Charlene liked to bite one of the girls while the other brought herto climax with oral sex, and in one case bit off the victim’s nipple. As absurdas it sounds, Gallego emerges at the end of the book as her victim.Ivan MilatBetween December 1989 and April 1992, seven hitch-hikers disappeared in southernAustralia. They were a Melbourne couple, James Gibson and Deborah Everist (both19), who vanished on 30 December 1989, German backpacker Simone Schmidl, 20, whovanished on 20 January 1991, German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer, 21, and AnjaHabscheid, 20, who vanished on 26 December 1991, and British backpackersCaroline Clarke and Joanne Walters (both 22), who vanished on 18 April 1992. Thebodies of the two British victims were found six months later, on 19 and 20September, in the Belanglo State Forest, near Bowral; Caroline had been shot tentimes in the head, and Joanne stabbed fourteen times in the chest and neck –suggesting two murderers. Both had been raped, and the fact that there were nodefensive wounds on the hands suggested that they had been tied up.A year later, on 5 October 1993, the skeletal remains of James Gibson andDeborah Everist were discovered near a fire trail in the Belanglo State Forest,and a task force to hunt the ‘Backpacker Killer’ was set up. On 1 November 1993,sniffer dogs discovered Simone Schmidl’s badly decomposed body, and three dayslater, the bodies of Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habscheid were found. Anja hadbeen decapitated, and it seemed that she had been forced to kneel while thekiller cut off her head in a kind of ritual execution.The hunt for the Backpacker Killer made headlines for the next six months, butlittle progress was made. The break in the case came when 40-year-old RichardMilat commented at work that there were more bodies still to be found, and thatkilling a woman was like cutting a loaf of bread. The workmate reported thiscomment to the police, and as a result, on 22 May 1994, police surrounded thehome of Ivan Milat, Richard Milat’s 50-year-old brother, in Eaglevale, a Sydneysuburb, and arrested him. A week later he was charged with the backpackermurders. In his garage, police found evidence to link Milat to the murders,including a bloodstained rope of a type used to bind some of the victims, asleeping bag belonging to Deborah Everist, a camera like the one owned byCaroline Clarke, and spent cartridges like those found near Caroline Clarke.Then a crucial witness came forward. On 25 January 1990, 24-year-old PaulOnions, a British student from Birmingham, was offered a lift by a short, stockyman in his 40s, with narrow, slit-like eyes and a drooping moustache. This manidentified himself as ‘Bill’ and said he was Yugoslavian. Onions was on his wayto Victoria to do some fruit picking, and ‘Bill’ said he could take him as faras Canberra. As they neared the Belanglo State Forest, the driver brought hisfour-wheel-drive car to a halt and produced a revolver, which he pointed at hispassenger, announcing: ‘This is a robbery.’ As he bent and produced a boxcontaining rope from under the seat, Onions leapt out and ran. The man chasedhim, firing a shot and screaming for him to stop. Just as Onions thought he hadlost him, he felt a hand grab his shoulder, and they rolled on the ground.At that moment a van came over the hill, and Onions ran in front of it. Thedriver, Joanne Berry, with her four children and her sister’s child, was forcedto stop. Onions clambered through a sliding door in the back and begged her todrive on. ‘He’s got a gun.’ As they drove off, they saw the man run to his owncar and drive off.Joanne Berry took Onions to Bowral police station, where he reported theincident. But, oddly, no action was taken, and when Onions left Australia fivemonths later, he had still not heard a word from the police. In fact, the reporton the attack had been mislaid.Four years later, Onions heard about the hunt for the backpacker killer, andrang the New South Wales police. His description of ‘Bill’ proved to fit IvanMilat, and after Milat’s arrest, Onions flew to Australia and identified Milatas his assailant. A blue shirt found in Milat’s garage was tentativelyidentified by Onions as the one he left behind in Milat’s car.Milat was a roadworker who was apparently obsessed by hunting and guns. He wasborn on 27 December 1944, the son of an Australian mother and Croat father. Thefamily consisted of ten boys and four girls, and the boys were always in troublewith the law. In his twenties, Milat was charged with car theft and breaking andentering, and went to prison several times.In 1971 Milat was suddenly in more serious trouble. He picked up two femalehitch-hikers, both in their late teens. Both women were under medication fordepression, and neither noticed when Milat turned off the highway. He stopped,produced two knives and two pieces of rope, and announced that he intended tohave sex with them both, or that he would kill them. One of the girls, agedeighteen, agreed, and allowed Milat to have sex with her on the front seat.When Milat stopped at a petrol station, the girl ran inside and told theattendant that she had been raped, and that the driver was holding her friend.Several employees of the station ran out, and when the other girl scrambled outof the car, Milat drove off at speed. When he was pulled over later by police,there were no knives in the car, and although he admitted having sex with thegirl, he claimed that it was with her consent. In any case, he said, the girlswere both screwy.Milat, who was already on two charges of armed robbery – one of a bank – nowfled to New Zealand, and he was not brought back and tried until 1974. He wascleared on the various charges and freed. (One of his brothers went to prisonfor the bank robbery.)In 1979, Milat gave a lift to two women hitch-hiking along the Hume Highway,then pulled off the road near the Belanglo State Forest and said: ‘OK, which ofyou girls wants it first?’ They fought back and ran into the bush; Milat triedfor two hours to find them. Yet neither woman reported the attack until theBackpacker Task Force was set up fifteen years later.Milat, it seems, was a ‘control freak’; in common with Fred West, he wanted tosee his victims bound and gagged. There was evidence that, as he killed more andmore victims, he enjoyed taking more time over it – half a dozen cigarette buttswere found near the scene of one murder. Some victims were paralysed by beingstabbed in the spine, then sexually assaulted and killed at leisure – both menand women were raped. (The judge at the trial would not give full details of theinjuries, in order to spare relatives.)A friend of Milat’s ex-wife Karen gave evidence that suggests that Milat wasanother ‘Right Man’, who demanded total obedience; Milat was obsessive aboutkeeping the house neat and tidy, and when Karen was sent shopping with a list,she had to stick to every item on it, or risk him flying into a violent rage.She had to ask him for every penny she spent, account for every minute of hertime, and bring back receipts for everything. Milat’s younger brother George –who later went on record as saying that his brother must now pay the price ofhis crimes – reports that Milat would fly into a rage with his wife whereverthey happened to be, and that on one occasion, after knocking a cup of coffeeover, he called her a stupid bitch.When Karen walked out, and Milat could not find her, he burnt down the garage ofher parents.It was soon after his wife left him, in 1989, that he began the murders.The trial of ‘Ivan the Terrible’ (as the press inevitably dubbed him) lasted forfour months, and ended on 27 July 1996, when Milat was found guilty on all sevencounts, and sentenced to life imprisonment by Judge David Hunt. Hunt alsocommented that he was convinced that Milat had not acted alone. In fact, Milat’sbarrister had already suggested in court that the murders had been committed byMilat’s brothers Walter and Richard. And in a television interview on the dayafter the trial, these two brothers were accused by the interviewer of beingaccomplices.Although the ‘Backpacker Killer’ is now in prison, most Australians feelstrongly that the full truth about the murders has still not been fullyrevealed.Donald ‘Pee Wee’ GaskinsArguably the nastiest known serial killer of modern times – if sheer number ofvictims and sadism of murders are the deciding factors – was a harmless-lookinglittle man with a high voice called Donald ‘Pee Wee’ Gaskins. An unimaginablesadist, he tortured over a hundred victims to death.Born in the backwoods of South Carolina in 1933, Gaskins came to the attentionof a writer named Wilton Earle in the 1980s, when Gaskins was under sentence ofdeath. He had been originally locked up for killing a number of ‘businessassociates’, people involved with him in a racket involving respraying andselling stolen cars, but he had escaped an execution sentence only to re-earn aplace on Death Row for daringly killing a fellow inmate. Earle, impressed by theelaborate way in which Gaskins had committed this murder, wrote to ask him if hewould like to dictate his autobiography. Gaskins invited Earle to visit him inprison and, in unsupervised conversations, revealed that he was a sadistickiller who had tortured dozens of victims to death.This claim that he tortured victims until they died was in itself unusual; mostserial killers are actually quite cowardly at the point of murder and, fearingdiscovery or being hurt themselves by their victims, they generally kill asquickly as possible. Many serial killers, as we’ve seen in this book, like tomutilate their victims, but this is almost invariably done after the victim issafely dead and therefore silent and unresisting.Gaskins, on the other hand, was the sort of monster that the Gestapo would haveloved to have recruited. Making sure that he had his victims away from allpossible help, he would experiment with cruelty until they either died of shockand exertion or he finally put them out of their misery. He told the horrifiedWilton Earle that he had killed victims with crushing, strangulation, cuttingand stabbing with blades, poisoning, drowning, beating them to death with hisfists and shooting them in the head execution style. A particular favourite ofGaskins’ was to cut off pieces of flesh from a victim and then cook and eat thefragment in front of them while they were still alive.Gaskins’ confessions, published by Earle in a book called Final Truth, were soappalling that transcribing them gave Earle a nervous breakdown. The book waspublished after Gaskins was electrocuted in September 1991.At least some blame for the creation of such a monster must go to the brutalityof the American penal system itself. Sent to reform school for burglary as ateenager, Gaskins was soon gang-raped by twenty youths. Only five foot, fourinches tall – thus his nickname ‘Pee Wee’ – he was an easy target for bulliesand sex abusers. This was the first of many terms in prison, during which timehe became a dangerous man in his own right. Prisons are often called ‘schools ofcrime’, and Gaskins was a star pupil. He eventually compelled the frightenedrespect of fellow inmates when he murdered a particularly dangerous prisoner,one of the jail’s ‘power men’. (In fact, always a clever killer, Gaskinsmurdered him while he was all but defenceless – the man was sitting on thetoilet at the time.)In the mid-1960s Gaskins was imprisoned for the statutory rape of atwelve-year-old girl named Patsy. A week later, he had escaped by jumping froman open window of a second storey waiting room in the Florence County courtroom.He was at liberty for six months before being recaptured and sentenced to fouryears in the South Carolina Central Correctional Institution. He was released in1969.After this, he resolved that, in future, if he ever decided to rape anotherwoman, he had better kill her too and hide the body. The first time he did this,he later told Earle, he was so carried away by the sensation of power that hebecame hooked and started to rape and murder women regularly – in fact, heclaimed that he felt the undeniable need to rape and kill every six weeks.In November 1970, Gaskins was questioned by the police about the disappearanceof his own 15-year-old niece, Janice Kirby, but he denied all knowledge of herwherea bouts. Police had to drop the matter due to lack of evidence.A month later he was again under suspicion – this time, for a horrifying sexmurder. A 13-year-old girl named Peggy Cuttino, daughter of a prominent localpolitician, had disappeared in the small town of Sumter; her mutilated andtortured body was found in a ditch. Again, Gaskins was questioned and released.In late 1975, Charleston police became worried over the disappearance of a13-year-old girl named Kim Ghelkins, last seen leaving her home with anovernight bag. It was hoped that she had simply run-away from home, but whensome of Kim’s clothes were found in a mobile home rented by Gaskins – whosestepdaughter was a friend of Kim’s – a warrant was issued for him.Gaskins was arrested on 14 November 1975, and charged with contributing to thedelinquency of a minor. Yet, even on this relatively lesser charge, police wereunable to find enough evidence to charge him. Fortunately, just as they werepreparing to let him go, his trusted friend Walter Neely suddenly became a bornagain Christian, and decided to tell everything he knew.That same afternoon – 4 December 1975 – Neely led the police to the graves oftwo young men who had been shot in the head and buried in a swamp. The followingday he led them to four more corpses, two men and two women. On 10 December,Neely was able to help them locate two more graves.All these victims turned out to be associates of Neely and Gaskins in the stolencar fencing racket. Neely told the police that Gaskins had killed them all forbusiness-related matters, so Gaskins was presented at his trial by prosecutorsas a gangland assassin, not the serial killer that he in fact was, over andabove his gangster activities.On 24 May 1976, Gaskins went on trial in the Florence County Courthouse, and wassentenced to die in the electric chair.On Death Row, Gaskins began to think hard about how he could escape execution.One possibility was to confess to more murders, and engage in plea bargaining.So he confessed to the murder of his niece, Janice, and her friend, Patty AnnAlsbrook. He claimed he had killed them as a result of an argument when he hadcaught them taking drugs. (In fact, as he later admitted to Wilton Earle, bothhad been sex crimes.) In exchange for his confession, Gaskins’ death sentencewas commuted to life imprisonment. With eleven murders to his credit – anddozens as yet unknown – he prepared to face a lifetime behind bars.In late 1980, there came a welcome diversion. He was asked if he would undertaketo murder a fellow prisoner, Rudolph Tyner, a 24-year-old drug addict, who hadkilled an old couple in the course of holding up their grocery store. Tyner wason Death Row, but hoped that the sentence would be commuted to life.The son of his victims, Tony Cimo, was embittered at the thought of Tynerescaping the electric chair, and decided to take justice into his own hands.Through a friend of a friend, he approached Gaskins. Bored and frustrated,Gaskins rose to the challenge of committing a murder under the nose of thewarders.The first step was to get to know Tyner and gain his trust, which Gaskins did byslipping him hashish. The murder itself was brilliant – and bizarre – in itsingenuity. Gaskins suggested he install a home-made telephone between theircells, running through a heating duct. Tyner’s phone contained plasticexplosive. When, at a prearranged time, Tyner said: ‘Over to you’, Gaskinsplugged his end of the wire into an electric socket . . . the explosion rockedthe whole cell block and Tyner was blown to pieces.The authorities were so shocked by such a freakishly violent death in the mostsecure part of the prison that they initially believed that it had been theresult of an accident of some kind. Then the evidence of plastic explosives wasfound and the prisoners’ rumours of murder began to be picked up. Tony Cimo, themost likely person to want Tyner dead, was arrested and confessed everything. Heand Gaskins stood trial for the murder of Rudolph Tyner. Cimo received eightyears. Gaskins was sentenced to the electric chair.During his early days in prison, after his arrest for the murder of KimGhelkins, Gaskins had often been interviewed by reporters; now he was almostforgotten – a mere car thief and contract killer who had murdered a number ofcrooked business acquaintances. One or two criminologists had talked aboutwriting about him, but it had all come to nothing. But Gaskins disliked his lossof celebrity status; as, knowing that he was, in fact, South Carolina’s worstmass murderer, he felt he deserved to be famous.So when, in 1990, he was approached by author Wilton Earle, who felt that hisstory might be worth telling, Gaskins cautiously agreed. He was running out ofappeals, and guessed that his appointment with the electric chair could not belong delayed – a year at the most. As he came to trust him, Gaskins agreed totell Earle what he called the ‘final truth’. But there was one stipulation: thatnothing should be published until after Gaskins had been executed. Among otherthings, his rape of a small child and the murder of at least one baby woulddisgust even his fellow Death Row prisoners. Even if he was not himself killedfor being a paedophile, his last days before he was executed would be madehellish by their loathing.Earle agreed. What he did not know when they made the agreement was that he wasabout to hear the most appalling and terrifying story of serial murder in thehistory of twentieth century crime. What was revealed over many sessions withthe tape recorder was that Gaskins was a compulsive and sadistic sex killer,whose list of victims amounted to well over a hundred – Gaskins himself wasuncertain just how many. The details of the ‘final truth’ were often sonauseating and horrific that Earle must have doubted many times whether theycould be published.Gaskins’ problem, as it emerged in the tapes, had always been an overdevelopedsex impulse. His need for sex was so powerful and compulsive that, whenever itcame to him, he experienced a heavy feeling that rolled from his stomach up tohis brain, and down again. He compared it to the pain women suffer beforemenstruation. When this happened, he would drive up and down the coastal highwaylooking for female hitchhikers.But having served two terms for rape, he had vowed it should never happen again.His solution was simple: to kill his victims. And having raped and killed hisfirst hitchhiker with a knife, he quickly discovered that torture and murderwere becoming an addiction. After a while, it made no difference whether thevictim was male or female, adult or small child; it was the torture – and thesense of power – that gave him pleasure. In effect, he became a character out ofone of Sade’s novels, working out new ways to satisfy his desire to hurt anddegrade.Gaskins estimated that in the six years between September 1969 and his arrest inNovember 1975, he had committed between eighty and ninety ‘coastal kills’, anaverage of fourteen a year. He distinguished these murders of hitch-hikerspicked up on the coast road from his ‘serious murders’, those committed forbusiness or personal motives like revenge.Hours before his execution on 6 September 1991, Gaskins tried to commit suicidewith a razor blade that he had swallowed the previous week, then regurgitated.He was found in time, and given twenty stitches. Soon after midnight, he walkedinto the execution chamber without help, and sat in the chair. After his wristand ankles had been strapped, a metal headpiece was placed on his skull, with awet sponge inside it. Before the black hood was placed over his head he gave athumbs-up salute to his lawyer. Three buttons were then pressed by three men –so that none of them would be sure who had been responsible for the execution.The BTK StranglerWichita, the largest city in Kansas, is a mid-sized and prosperous communitywith half a million inhabitants and a low crime rate; the last place in theworld you would associate with sadistic murder.That changed suddenly after 15 January 1972, the date of one of the mosthorrific crimes in the history of the mid-west. On that day, 15-year-old CharlesOtero returned from school to find that his mother, father and two siblings hadbeen killed. His mother and father, their wrists and ankles bound, lay dead intheir bedroom. His 9-year-old brother Joe, wearing a hood, was dead in hisbedroom. His 11-year-old sister Josephine had been hanged from a pipe in thebasement, wearing only a shirt and socks. Two more children – Danny, 15, andCarmen, 13 – had also been at school during the killing spree.Although there were semen traces all over the house, there had been no rape.Since all four had been strangled with cords, it looked as if the killer was asadist who gained pleasure from the act of strangulation, and the sense of powerit gave him to watch people suffer. This had been a well-known sexual perversionsince the case of the strangler Vincent Verzeni was described in PsychopathiaSexualis by Richard von Krafft-Ebing in 1886. The killer had probably used a gunto gain control, then taken his time – about an hour and a half – in terrorisingand killing the victims. It seemed likely he had gained entrance when the father– 38-year-old Puerto Rican Joseph Otero – was taking Charlie and two morechildren to school. He had then tied up the mother, Julie, 34, and her twochildren, and waited for Joseph to return. It had obviously been carefullyplanned.The police had no leads. But nine months later, a tip to look in a certainlibrary book revealed a letter from the killer, promising more murders. Hedeclared ‘I find it hard to control myself’, and admitted that he felt he waspossessed by a monster. Naturally the press pounced on such a lurid story andsoon the murderer had a media nickname: ‘the BTK Strangler’ (short for BindTorture Kill) often shortened to just ‘BTK’.Three months after the Otera murders, 20-year-old Kathryn Bright and her19-year-old brother Kevin came home soon after midday to find an intruder with agun, who told them he needed money to escape from the police. He tied Kathryn,then took Kevin into the bedroom and tried to strangle him. When Kevin resistedhe was shot in the head. Then he heard sounds of distress from his sister, anddragged himself into the next room, only to be shot again; in spite of this hesucceeded in escaping and getting help. But it was too late: Kathryn had beenstabbed three times in the stomach and later died in hospital. The killer hadalso tried to strangle her.The murders ceased for three years. The next victim was 26-year-old mother ofthree Shirley Vian, found strangled on 17 March 1977, on her bed; her threechildren, locked in the bathroom, had escaped through a tiny window; the killerlater admitting he had intended to kill them too.Nine months later, on 8 December 1977, it was the murderer himself who rang thepolice and told them that a girl named Nancy Fox had been killed. The call wasquickly traced, but police found only a dangling public phone. 25-year-oldsecretary Nancy Fox had been strangled in the night, and semen indicated thatthe killer had masturbated over her.Then came an eight-year gap, and the next victim, 53-year-old widow MarineHedge, was strangled in her home on 27 April 1985. The killer then took her inthe boot of her car to a nearby Lutheran church and took photographs of the bodyin various types of bondage, then drove her to a ditch, where he covered herover. Her disappearance was not attributed to BTK.The strangler would later reveal that women like Marine Hedge were his‘projects’, observed and stalked for days or weeks before he struck.This was also true of his next victim, a 28-year-old married woman named VickiWegerle, to whose house he gained entry on 16 September 1986, by claiming to bea telephone repairman; he strangled her after holding her at gunpoint, then tookphotos of her. Although he thought she was dead when he left her, she actuallylived for a short time. Her husband found her dying on his return from work.The killer gained entry to the house of the eleventh and final victim,62-year-old Delores Davis, on 19 January 1991 by hurling a concrete blockthrough her window, then telling her he was on the run and needed food andmoney. He handcuffed her, pretended he was leaving, then went back and strangledher. Then he took her body in the boot of her own car and dumped it under abridge.For thirteen years nothing further was heard from BTK. But on 19 March 2004, thenewsroom of the Wichita Eagle received a letter from him acknowledgingresponsibility for the death of Vicki Wegerle – whose husband had been chiefsuspect since 1986 – enclosed with a photograph of her driver’s license andphotographs of her body.Immediately, the fear was back again. But it proved unnecessary. BTK was aboutto make the mistake he had been so careful to avoid for thirty years, and itcame about because of his craving to play games with the police.There were no less than eleven communications between March 2004 and February2005, including a letter describing the Otero murders, cards with images ofbondage of children on them, and even a misleading ‘autobiography’, giving falsedetails of his life, which led to a public appeal to anyone who might recognisethe writer. There was also a cereal box containing a bound doll with a plasticbag over its head, and another containing a bound doll symbolising JosephineOtero.Then BTK made his mistake; he asked the police if he could send a message on afloppy disk, and on being assured (via a newspaper advertisement) that it wouldbe acceptable, he sent one to a television station. But electronic traces on thedisk indicated it had been formerly used by the Christ Lutheran Church inWichita by someone called ‘Dennis’.A man named Dennis Rader, aged 60, president of the church council, was keptunder observation, and his daughter was approached by the police for a bloodsample. The DNA proved to be the same as that in the semen left at crime scenesand, on 25 February 2005, Rader was arrested and charged. He seemed almostrelieved, and quickly confessed.The trial, from 27 June to 19 August 2005, ended with the expected guiltyverdict, and Rader received ten life sentences which would last 175 years. He ispresently serving them at the El Dorado Correctional Facilty, Kansas.The UnabomberWhat is now called ‘eco-terrorism’ – that is, illegal militant action takenagainst people or organisations that are believed to be damaging the environment– has been taking place since the 1960s. Most such actions are, fortunately,relatively harmless – animal rights activists set laboratory test animals free,demonstrators trespass into restricted areas to make protests andanti-globalisation riots occasionally wreck multinational-owned burger outlets.But such ‘eco-terrorists’ generally revere human life as much as they do alllife on the planet, so rarely try to actually harm other people. One exception,however, stands-out . . .On 25 May 1978, a small parcel bomb wounded a security guard at Illinois’Northwestern University. This was the first amateurish attack made by the serialkiller who later became known as ‘the Unabomber’. Over the next eighteen years,the Unabomber sent homemade, but increasingly sophisticated, parcel bombs toeducational establishments, technology companies and corporate businesses.Police were doubly flummoxed by this method of attack: not only was the killermurdering strangers – the first and greatest problem in serial crimeinvestigation – but he or she was also striking from a distance, using theunwitting US Postal Service as an accomplice. There were no personal links tolead from the victims to the killer and no possibility of chance eyewitnessesidentifying the murderer.Between May 1978 and December 1985, the Unabomber is known to have sent outnine, fortunately non-fatal, parcel bombs. Two were intercepted and defused, butthe others injured eighteen people, some seriously. One of these bombs – thatwounded United Airlines president, Percy A. Wood – earned the bomb maker themedia nickname ‘the Un. A. bomber,’ later simplified to ‘the Unabomber.’December 1985, in Sacramento California, saw the first fatal Unabomber attack.Hugh C. Scrutton tried to remove a package left lying in the car park behind hiscomputer rental shop. It exploded, killing him. This bomb had not been deliveredby the Postal Service; it had simply been left in the parking lot. It seemedlikely, therefore, that the killer had put it there in order to watch, from adistance, the result of his handiwork. Unfortunately, nobody had seen the boobytrap bomb being planted.The next bombing followed the same pattern. On 20 February 1987, a bomb was leftin the parking lot outside a computer firm in Salt Lake City. This time,however, a secretary in the firm spotted the bomber placing the booby trap. Shethought it odd that the tall man in the hooded sweatshirt and aviator darkglasses should leave a lump of wood with nails sticking out of it right where inmight damage somebody’s tyres but, unfortunately, before she could alert anyoneher boss, Gary Wright, drove into the lot, got out of his car and kicked thelump of wood out of the path of his tyres. The resulting explosion took off hisleg, but did not kill him.Police were delighted to have a description of the Unabomber – albeit a slightlysketchy one – and plastered the artist’s reconstruction all over the nationalmedia. Any doubt that the Unabomber meant his bombs to kill had been removed bythe last two attacks: both bombs had been packed with metal fragments, designedto shred their victims with flying shrapnel. But at least he seemed to havegiven up killing from a distance – the temptation to see the results of hismurders obviously had been too great.Unfortunately, the publication of the witness description inadvertently removedthis advantage. The Unabomber stopped sending bombs for six years – presumablyfrightened that the police might identify him – and when he struck again he didso using his older, and for him safer, method of delivery: the US Mail.On 22 June 1993, a parcel bomb badly injured Dr Charles Epstein, a leadinggeneticist at the University of California, partly destroying his hand andsending shrapnel through his chest and across his face. Only swift medical aidsaved his life.The next day a similar parcel bomb badly hurt computer scientist Dr DavidGelernter of Yale University. He lost most of his right hand, and the sight andhearing on his right side. He too survived, but only with extensive medicaltreatment.On 10 December 1994, a parcel bomb killed New York advertising executive ThomasMosser. Some doubted that this was a genuine Unabomber attack until it waspointed out that one of Mosser’s corporate clients was the Exxon oil company –responsible, in many people’s eyes, for recklessly polluting the environment.Less than five months later, on 24 April, timber industry lobbyist Gilbert B.Murray picked up a parcel, supposedly sent by a firm called ‘Closet Dimensions’.As Murray picked up the package, one of his staff members joked: ‘It’s heavy.Must be a bomb.’ The blast was particularly powerful, destroying Murray’s headand upper body, but not killing anyone else. Fortunately, he was to be theUnabomber’s last victim.In 1995, in the wake of the Oklahoma bombing, the Unabomber sent a ‘manifesto’to the Washington Post and the New York Times – threatening to blow up apassenger jet if it were not promptly published. It proved to be a ramblingscreed that attacked big business, environmentally damaging government policies,scientific research and progress in general. The opening paragraph read:The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for thehuman race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us wholive in ‘advanced’ countries, but they have destabilized society, have made lifeunfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespreadpsychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) andhave inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development oftechnology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings togreater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it willprobably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and itmay lead to increased physical suffering even in ‘advanced’ countries.It was plain that the Unabomber believed that all development since theIndustrial Revolution was dangerous and damnable. He was evidently awell-educated, well-read man, and many of the things he stated were simplyextreme extensions of mainstream environmentalism. But he was also delusionaland self-justifying; insisting that his bombing campaign had been the only wayto make the media pay attention to his message. It may have been true that therewere few avenues to attack modern technology through the conventional,pro-technology US media, but killing to get people’s attention completelyundermined the credibility of his manifesto.And the fact that he had almost certainly watched the explosions that killedHugh C. Scrutton and crippled Gary Wright placed the Unabomber firmly in theserial killer category. Whatever environmental and political self-justificationhe offered, he was not an ecological activist: he was a homicidal sadist.Fortunately, the manifesto was the last terror package the Unabomber was ever tosend. David Kaczynski, in Montana, read the Unabomber’s manifesto and realisedwith horror that it sounded just like the rantings of his hermit-like olderbrother Theodore. Most telling was the reversal of the old homily: ‘you can’thave your cake and eat it.’ The Unabomber, insisting that the positive uses oftechnology were not worth the negative side effects, wrote: ‘you can’t eat yourcake and have it.’ This was a family habit, picked up from their mother, and itsinclusion convinced David that Theodore was the Unabomber.With natural misgivings, David Kaczynski informed the FBI, who raided Theodore’sisolated Montana cabin and found plenty of proof that he was indeed theUnabomber.Theodore J. Kaczynski had been a brilliant academic – in 1967, at just 25, hehad been appointed Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Berkley University,California – but, in 1969, Kaczynski suffered a total emotional breakdown andhad subsequently become a recluse in Montana. Living in an isolated log cabin,Kaczynski believed he followed a life that was in tune with nature – makingbombs with some parts carefully hand-carved from wood and roiling in hatred forthe modern world.In 1996, Ted Kaczynski was sentenced to four life sentences, with parolepermanently denied.The Green River KillerFor over two decades the mystery of the Green River serial killer hung over theAmerican north-west. And not just police investigators were shamed by their lackof success in apprehending the killer; so were local media organisations – oneof which publicly revealed the existence of a police trap set for the murdererin the early days of the hunt. Moreover, Washington State, seen by many as anidyllic, rural state, was revealed to have a darker underbelly: just like NewYork or Los Angeles, it was a place where many teenage girls ended up asprostitutes . . . and where the killer of such girls could escape justice fordecades.On 12 August 1982, a slaughterman discovered a bloated corpse floating in theslow-flowing Green River, near Seattle, in Washington State. The policepathologist succeeded in lifting an excellent set of prints from the swollenflesh, which enabled the criminal identification department to name the victimas 23-year-old Debra Lynn Bonner, known as ‘Dub’; she was a stripper with a listof convictions as a prostitute. She was the second of literally dozens of womenwho would be found during the next three years.The first had been found a month earlier, half a mile downstream, strangled withher own slacks, and had been identified as 16-year-old Wendy Coffield. In spiteof her age, she had a record as a prostitute – indeed, as a ‘trick roll’:someone who sets up her clients (‘Johns’) for robbery.Within three days of the finding of Debra Bonner, Dave Reichert, the detectivein charge of the case, heard that two more bodies had been found in the GreenRiver. Both women were black, both were naked, and they had been weighted downto the river bottom with large rocks. They were only a few hundred yardsupstream from the spot where Dub Bonner had been found, and had almost certainlybeen there at the time.As Reichert walked along the bank towards the place where Dub had been found, hediscovered another body. Like the other two, she was black, and was lateridentified as 16-year-old Opal Mills. The fact that rigor mortis had not yetdisappeared meant that she had been left there in the past two days. Which inturn meant that if the police had kept watch on the river after the first bodieswere found, the killer would have almost certainly been caught.It was the first of a series of mischances that would make this one of the mostfrustrating criminal cases in Seattle’s history.The next – and perhaps the worst – occurred two days later, when a local TVstation fatuously announced that the riverbank was now under round-the-clocksurveillance, thus destroying all chance of catching the killer on a returnvisit.The medical evidence on the other two women, Marcia Chapman and Cynthia Hinds,confirmed that the Green River Killer was a ‘sick trick’; both women had pointedrocks jammed into their vaginas. Like the others, they were prostitutes workingthe Strip – the main road – leading to Seattle’s Sea-Tac Airport.On Saturday 28 August 1982, Kase Lee left her pimp’s apartment to ‘turn atrick’, and vanished. The next day Terri Milligan took an hour off fromsoliciting to go for a meal; apparently a car pulled up for her as she walked tothe fast-food joint, and, unwilling to reject business, she climbed in.The following day, 15-year-old Debra Estes – known to the police as Betty Jones– was picked up by a blue and white pickup truck; the man drove her to remotewoodland, made her undress at gun point, then ordered her to give him a ‘blowjob’. After that he robbed her of $75 and left her with her hands tied. This manwas pulled in by police who recognised the description of his pickup truck, andidentified as the attacker. But a lie-detector test established his innocence ofthe Green River murders. And while he was still in custody, 18-year-old MaryMeehan, who was eight months pregnant, disappeared, and became victim numbernine.Within three weeks of her rape, Debra Estes would become the tenth victim of theGreen River Killer. Six more victims in August, October, November and Decemberwould bring his total up to at least sixteen – the largest annual total for anyAmerican serial killer up to that time.Yet it would be exceeded in the following year, 1983, when twenty-six womenvanished, and the remains of eight of them were found near Sea-Tac Airport orclose by. In March, special investigator Bob Keppel, known for his brilliantwork on the Ted Bundy case, was asked to write a report on the investigation. Itwas devastating, with hundreds of examples of incompetence and failure to followup on leads. For example, when the driving license of victim Marie Malvar wasfound at the airport, and the police notified, they did not even bother tocollect it – although it might well have contained the killer’s fingerprint.In 1984, four victims were found together on Auburn West Hill, six more inwooded areas along State Route 410, and two near Tigard, Oregon, the lattergiving rise to the speculation that the killer had moved to live in a newlocation. In January a Green River Task Force of 36 investigators was formed,with a then staggering $2 million budget. By 1988 the cost of the investigationwas to reach over $13 million.Among the hundreds of suspects interviewed by the police was Gary Leon Ridgway,35, a mild-looking man with fishlike lips, who worked for the Kenworth TruckPlant and was known to pick up prostitutes – he even admitted being obsessed bythem. He also confessed to choking a prostitute in 1982, but claimed this wasbecause she bit him.By 1986, with the investigation stalled, Ridgway’s file was re-opened, and hisex-wife interviewed about his preference for sex in the open, often near theGreen River. Ridgway was placed under surveillance. And still women disappeared– although no longer with quite the same frequency.In December 1988, a television special on the case, ‘Manhunt Live’, led to 4,000tips from the public, and to the arrest of 38-year-old William J. Stevens, whohad a criminal record. But although both police and media believed the GreenRiver Killer had been arrested, credit card receipts proved Stevens had beenelsewhere at the time of some of the murders, and he was released.And so throughout the 1990s, the case marked time, while Reichert, the chiefinvestigator, admitted that his obsession with the killer had caused seriousproblems in his marriage.Genetic fingerprinting had first been used in 1986, and had led to the solutionof many murders. The main problem was likely to occur if there was not enoughDNA material for testing, or if it was old. In 2001, a major breakthrough camewhen the Washington State crime lab acquired the equipment to extract usable DNAfrom old samples and multiply the quantity by the method known as STR, or shorttandem repeats. (This is also known as the PCR, or polymerase chain reaction,which amplifies genetic samples by ‘unzipping’ the double-stranded DNA molecule,and making two exact copies.)Now a major review of samples of semen evidence began. And by September 2001, ithad paid off. Semen samples, taken from Opal Mills, Marcia Chapman and CarolChristensen, three of the earliest victims, proved to be from Gary Ridgway.Paint fragments and fibre evidence taken from the grave of Debra Estes in 1988were also linked to Ridgway. So when Ridgway was finally arrested on 30 November2001, he was charged with four counts of murder.At first pleading innocent, he later agreed to change his plea to guilty toavoid the death penalty.Ridgway’s account of how he became a serial killer occupies the most fascinatingchapter of Reichert’s book: Chasing the Devil. As with many killers, theproblems seem to have started with his upbringing. He was a chronic bed-wetter,and his mother would drag him out of bed and parade him in front of hisbrothers, then make him stand naked in a tub of cold water. His father seems tohave been a timid nonentity. But as an employee of a mortuary he stronglyinfluenced his son’s fantasies by describing at length interrupting someonehaving sex with a corpse. Ridgway began to fantasise about this. When he saw hismother sunbathing he had imagined having sex with her, but now he dreamed ofkilling her and violating the body.Like so many serial killers he was sadistic to animals, and once killed a cat bylocking it in a refrigerator. He also claimed that, as a teenager, he oncedrowned a little boy by wrapping his legs around him and pulling him under thewater. And later he would stab and injure another small boy, although he wasnever caught.Joining the US Navy, Ridgway was sent to the Philippines, and there began to useprostitutes regularly. They quickly became his lifelong obsession.He had discovered he enjoyed choking people during a quarrel with his secondwife, Marcia, when, on an angry impulse, he wrapped his arm round her neck frombehind (a method also used by the Boston Strangler). In addition he enjoyedtying her up for sex. In 1975 they had a son, Matthew, whom he adored. Areligious phase lasted until 1980, when they divorced. Yet, during theirmarriage, he constantly used prostitutes.He embarked on killing after his divorce. Because he seemed a feeble-looking‘milquetoast’ his victims felt no alarm about him, and allowed him to get behindthem. He often took them back to his house, had sex, and then killed them.Later, he found he preferred to kill them first and have sex with the bodies. Healso confessed to revisiting bodies several times for more sex.He even admitted to a fantasy – never carried out – to overpower a prostitutethen impale her with an upright pole inserted into her vagina; a favouritepractice of the original Dracula, also known as Vlad the Impaler.This apparently innocuous little man was able to carry on killing for many years– partly because he looked so harmless, partly through luck and largely throughthe general incompetence shown by investigators and the media at the start ofthe investigation. Reichert emphasises that Ridgway was full of self-pity,regarding himself as the main helpless victim of his sinister urges.On 5 November 2003, Ridgway pleaded guilty to 48 murders, and received 48 lifesentences.Jack UnterwegerJack Unterweger, poet, dramatist and serial killer, qualifies as one of thestrangest criminals of the twentieth century.From the point of view of law enforcement, his case began on 14 September 1990,when the naked body of a shop assistant, Blanka Bockova, was found on the banksof the Vltava River, near Prague. She had been beaten and strangled withstockings. Although lying on her back with legs apart, atampon was still inplace, and there were no traces of semen. She had been out drinking with friendsin Wenceslas Square the previous evening, but had decided not to leave with themat 11.45. The police were baffled; there were simply no leads.On New Year’s Eve 1991, in a forest near Graz, Austria, nearly 300 miles southof Prague, another woman was found strangled with her pantyhose. She wasHeidemarie Hammerer, a prostitute who had vanished from Graz on 26 October 1990.Although fully clothed, there were signs that she had been undressed and thenre-dressed after she was dead. Bruises on her wrist suggested rope or handcuffs.Again, no semen was present. Some red fibres found on her clothes were preservedas forensic evidence, as were minute particles of leather, probably from ajacket.Five days later, a badly decomposed woman was found in a forest north of Graz.She had been stabbed and strangled – again, probably with her pantyhose. She wasidentified as Brunhilde Masser, another prostitute.There was another disappearance from Graz on 7 March 1991, a prostitute namedElfriende Schrempf. Her decomposed body was found eight months later, on 5October, in a forest near Graz. And still the police had no clue to thismultiple killer of prostitutes.When four more prostitutes, Silvia Zagler, Sabine Moitzi, Regina Prem and KarinEroglu, disappeared in Vienna during the next month, it looked as if the killerhad changed his location. Although the police claimed there was no establishedconnection between the crimes, the press began to speak of a serial killer. Theycalled him ‘the Vienna Courier’.And at this point, investigators found a vital lead. Ex-policeman AugustSchenner, retired for five years from the Vienna force, was reminded of the MOof a murderer he had met seventeen years earlier, in 1974. His name was JackUnterweger, and he was now a famous writer and media personality.The case dated back to the time when Unterweger was 23. Two women had beenstrangled. The first, Margaret Schaefer, 18, was a friend of Barbara Scholz, aprostitute, who had turned him in. Scholz told how they had robbed Schaefer’shouse, then taken her to the woods, where Unterweger had strangled her with herbra after she refused oral sex. He had left her naked and covered with leaves –just as in most of the more recent killings.The second 1970s victim, a prostitute named Marcia Horveth, had been strangledwith her stockings and dumped in a lake. Unterweger was not charged with thismurder, because he had already confessed to the first and had been sentenced tolife. Nevertheless he had pleaded guilty to the murder of Horveth, claiming thatas he was making love to her, he had seen the face of his mother before him.This, apparently, was his reason to kill her. A psychologist diagnosed him asexually sadistic psychopath with narcissistic tendencies.Unterweger, a good-looking youth who was the son of a prostitute and an AmericanGI, had been illiterate when he went to jail. He had already been in prisonfifteen times, for offences including rape and car theft. He had even been apimp. But in prison for life, he set about learning to read and write. Then heedited the prison newspaper, started a literary review, and wrote hisautobiography, a book called Purgatory (‘Fegefeur’), which professed that he wastotally rehabilitated, and had killed the prostitute because he hated hismother.The book made him an overnight literary celebrity and intellectuals began tolobby for his release. He was paroled on 23 May 1990, after sixteen years. Andhe was now a celebrity, who quickly became rich when his book was made into amovie. Since then he had written plays, had given readings of his poetry, andwas a regular guest on TV talk shows. He habitually wore a white suit and droveexpensive cars. Moreover, as a magazine writer, he had even interviewed thepolice about the ‘Vienna Courier’, and been critical of their failure to catchhim. Could this charming, brilliant new literary celebrity be a serial killer?As they reviewed the evidence, the Vienna police – and especially a detectivecalled Ernst Geiger – decided the answer had to be yes. To begin with, when theychecked his credit card receipts to establish his whereabouts at the times ofcrimes, they learned that Unterweger was in Graz in October, when BrunhildeMasser was killed. And he was there again in March when Elfriede Schrempfvanished. He was also in Bregenz, from where Heidemarie Hammerer was taken, inDecember and, moreover, resembled the last person with whom she was seen.Unterweger had been in Prague the previous September, and when the policecontacted their counterparts in Prague, they learned about the murder of BlancaBockover. Of course, all this could hardly be coincidence. After months ofsecretly investigating the celebrity, investigators finally decided that it wastime to show their hand.They interviewed Unterweger on 2 October 1991. Naturally, he denied everything.Moreover, he renewed criticism of the police for their failure to catch theVienna Courier. Support for him among Viennese intellectuals and his societyfriends remained strong. (But how could they admit that their enthusiasm for hiswriting had unleashed a killer on Vienna? Was it not more likely, as Unterwegertold them, that the authorities were persecuting this ex-criminal who had nowbecome their scourge?)Undeterred, investigator Ernst Geiger went on with his search. Prostitutes whohad been with Unterweger testified that he liked to handcuff them during sex –which was consistent with some of the marks on the wrists of the ViennaCourier’s victims. Police tracked down the BMW that Unterweger had bought on hisrelease from prison, and found in it a dark hair with skin on the root. It wastiny, but using the PCR technique to make multiple copies of DNA, they were ableto identify it as belonging to victim Blanca Bockover.A search of Unterweger’s apartment revealed a red scarf whose fibres matchedthose found on Bockover, as well as a leather jacket, and receipts fromCalifornia, where Unterweger had gone to research a magazine article onprostitution in Hollywood. A check with the Los Angeles Police Departmentrevealed that there had been three murders of prostitutes in the five weeksUnterweger was there, while the ‘Courier’s’ activities in Vienna ceased. Allthree women – Irene Rodriguez, Shannon Exley and Sherri Long – had beenstrangled with their bras and left out in the open.It seemed that Unweger had gone to the LAPD and introduced himself as a Europeanwriter researching red light areas. He went on with police in patrol cars, andwas treated as a distinguished guest.It was time to arrest the suspect. In February 1992 a judge signed a warrant.But when the police arrived at his apartment, Unterweger was gone. They learnedfrom his friends that he had gone on holiday with his latest girlfriend,18-year-old Bianca Mrak, whom he had picked up in a restaurant, and with whom hehad been living since the previous December.It seemed they had gone to Switzerland, and then, when friends tipped him off bytelephone that there was a warrant out for him, to New York.Before leaving Europe, Unterweger had telephoned Vienna newspapers to insistthat the police were trying to frame him. He also made an offer: if the officerin charge of the case would drop the warrant for his arrest, he would returnvoluntarily to ‘clear his name’. He had alibis, he said, for all the murders –on one occasion he had been giving a reading of his work.Unterweger and Bianca moved to Miami, Florida, and rented a beach apartment.They were running short of money, and Bianca took a job as a topless dancer.Bianca’s mother also kept them supplied with money by telegraph.When the police learned about this, they called on the mother, and prevailed onher to inform them the next time her daughter made contact. And when Biancaasked her mother to telegraph more cash to the Western Union office in Miami,two agents were waiting for them. The alert Unterweger spotted them and fled,urging Bianca to go in another direction. But he was caught after runningthrough a restaurant, causing havoc, and out at the back, where an agent with agun arrested him. When told he was wanted for making a false customs declarationin New York – he had failed to admit his prison record – he looked relieved. Butwhen they added that he was also wanted in Vienna for murder, he began to sob.Learning that he was also wanted in California, where his semen had been foundin one of the victims, Unterweger decided to resist extradition to Europe andopt for trial in Los Angeles. Then he was told that California – unlike Austria– had a death penalty. So he immediately changed his mind.Back in Vienna, the final outcome was inevitable. The strength of the evidenceagainst him was overwhelming. As the trial – which began in April 1994 – draggedon for two and a half months, his support among journalists and former admirersbegan to ebb away. He failed to produce any of the unshakeable alibis he hadpromised. On 28 June 1994, a jury found him guilty, and he was sentenced to lifeimprisonment.American agent Gregg McCrary, who had been actively involved since 1992 as apsychological profiler, advised the Vienna police to keep a suicide watch onUnterweger, since he had frequently boasted that he would never spend anotherday in prison. They failed to heed his warning, and a few hours after beingsentenced to life imprisonment, he hanged himself in his cell with the cord fromhis jumpsuit.Andrew CunananIn 1994, the Hollywood director Oliver Stone released the movie Natural BornKillers – a deliberately shocking story of a young couple who travel aroundAmerica brutally killing strangers for fun. A satire on the media’s casualattitude towards violence and murder, Stone’s film was clearly meant to becontroversial, but perhaps he got more than he bargained for.The very media Stone was satirising became almost hysterical over the film, withtelevision and newspaper pundits wailing that it could inspire weak-mindedpeople (not themselves, of course) to become serial killers. On the whole thisseems an unlikely possibility; as we have seen in this book, the path tobecoming a serial killer usually involves being abused as an adolescent,followed by years of sadistic sexual fantasies – no movie could recreate such apsychological downward spiral in those who watched it. But within three years,the US was traumatised by a series of killings that seemed as random andheartless as any of those depicted in Stone’s film.The case started, some believe, when 28-eight-year-old male prostitute AndrewCunanan began to suspect he had contracted AIDS. He went for a blood test inearly 1997, but could not bring himself to collect the results. After that datehis friends began to notice that the usually humorous and effervescent Cunananseemed increasingly depressed – perhaps because he assumed that he indeed hadthe fatal disease.Another cause of depression in Cunanan was his jealous fear that two of hisformer boyfriends, Jeffrey Trail (a former Navy officer) and David Madson (aMinneapolis architect) were seeing each other behind his back. In an attempt tosoothe his ex-lover’s suspicions, Madson invited Cunanan to fly from his home inSan Diego to Minneapolis to meet with him and Trail to talk matters over. Themeeting, on 27 April 1997 in Madson’s apartment, proved stormy and ended withCunanan grabbing a meat mallet from a kitchen drawer and beating Jeff Trail’sskull in.It is a mystery just why David Madson – a respected and successful professional– then helped Cunanan to roll the corpse in a rug, and then went on the run withthe killer, but he did. The mystery will remain unsolved because Cunanan shotMadson dead and left him in a roadside ditch several days later. Ironically, therevolver Cunanan used had belonged to Jeff Trail.At this point, Andrew Cunanan seems to have decided to live the life of acarefree outlaw, and never made any particular effort to cover his tracks – evenleaving photographs of himself in Madson’s Cherokee Jeep when he abandoned it inDanville, Illinois, a week after the murder of Jeff Trail.As he left no diaries, or similar indication to his mental workings, it is amatter of conjecture why Cunanan became a serial killer. However, his nextkilling almost certainly stemmed from a sick urge to re-enact a scene from oneof the sadomasochistic pornographic videos he loved to watch (and had at leastonce ‘acted’ in).After abandoning Madson’s Jeep, he walked a few blocks and approached72-year-old Chicago-based property developer Lee Miglin. Drawing his revolver,Cunanan forced Miglin into the garage of Miglin’s home and bound and gagged theold man with duct tape. Then, apparently recreating a scene from a video calledTarget for Torture, he beat and kicked Miglin, stabbed him several times in thechest with a pair of pruning shears, then slowly sawed the old man’s throat openwith a hack saw. Cunanan then crushed the corpse to a pulp with Miglin’s own car– driving over it backwards and forwards several times. Then, after stealingsome ornamental gold coins from the house, Cunanan simply drove off.Is this evidence that movies like Natural Born Killers and Target for Torturecan turn people into serial killers? It would seem more likely that the sort ofperson who will eventually become a serial killer is highly likely to want towatch sadomasochistic movies. But sadists with no access to such material stillbecome serial killers – so blaming the movies for serial crime is asover-simplistic as blaming wars on Hollywood, because the politicians whodeclare wars sometimes watch war movies.The Miglin murder, taking place as it did in a separate state from the first twokillings, allowed the FBI to become involved in the case. They realised thatthey had a very unstable serial killer on the loose (Cunanan had killed therequisite three people to earn this categorisation). The Federal Authoritiesissued a nationwide police alert and placed Cunanan at the top of the Ten MostWanted list. Yet he avoided all attempts to catch him, either through incredibleluck or, more likely, grotesque police bungling. Cunanan certainly wasn’t makingmuch effort to avoid detection, driving Miglin’s stolen, blood-spattered Lexusall the way to New Jersey before dumping it to steal a new vehicle.To do this he murdered 45-year-old William Reese – a harmless grounds keeper atthe Finn’s Point Cemetery, near Pennsville. It seems that Cunanan arrived at thecemetery, abandoned the Lexus and then approached Reese and asked for an aspirinand a glass of water (both were found spilled next to the body). Following himinto the grounds keeper’s lodge, Cunanan shot Reese dead and stole his Chevypickup truck. Then he drove to Florida.It seems certain that Cunanan pre-planned his next killing – that of thehigh-flying fashion designer Gianni Versace. At fifty, Versace was at the top ofhis profession and counted international idols like Princess Diana among hisclosest friends. When it was later discovered that, some years before, Versacehad met Cunanan at a San Francisco party, some wondered if the homosexualfashion designer and the gay toy boy had been lovers, but there is no evidenceto back this conjecture. For whatever reason Andrew Cunanan had decided to killVersace, it doesn’t seem to have been a crime of passion.For two months Cunanan wandered about Miami quite openly, keeping an eye onVersace’s favourite clubs and restaurants. The fact that the Miami police failedto pick Cunanan up in this time is a matter of considerable embarrassment to thedepartment – especially as it was quickly realised – as soon as Reese’sabandoned Chevy was found – that the killer might be at large in the city.On the morning of 15 July 1997, Cunanan finally caught sight of Gianni Versaceoutside his Miami mansion. As the designer went to open the gate, Cunananstepped up behind him and shot him twice in the head, killing him instantly.This was to be Cunanan’s last murder. He went into hiding as hundreds of lawofficers and FBI agents flooded the city to hunt for him. Eventually, eight daysafter the Versace killing, he was discovered hiding in a luxury houseboat by thecaretaker. Before the police could capture him, however, Cunanan shot himself inthe temple with Jeff Trail’s revolver.Some experts believe that Cunanan went on his killing spree because he thoughthe was dying of AIDS. While it remains uncertain just what it takes to turn aperson into a serial killer, it is clear that fear of retribution is the mainbreak that stops many borderline sadists from becoming habitual killers.Perhaps, with that break removed – thinking he had nothing left to lose – AndrewCunanan gave in to his dark temptations.Ironically, although it has never been officially confirmed, it is rumoured thatthe AIDS test carried out during Cunanan’s autopsy proved negative. If true, hemight have never become a serial killer if he had had the courage to collect theresults of his blood test earlier in the year.Dr Harold ShipmanEven before it was suspected that Jack the Ripper had had medical training,doctors have been looked upon with a hint of suspicion. After all, they not onlyhave our lives in their hands, as the saying goes, but they also have the skillsand tools to kill with comparative ease.Fortunately, killer doctors are a great rarity. The sort of people who are drawnto care for others – and to spend years training to do so – are not very likelyto choose to become murderers as well. As always, however, there are exceptionsto the rule. In fact, it was a doctor who was possibly the most prolific serialkiller known to criminologists.In September 1998, police arrested Manchester GP Harold Frederick Shipman, onsuspicion of murder. At the time, even investigators found it hard to convincethemselves that this pleasant-mannered man, with a practice of over 3,000patients, could be a killer. But as the evidence mounted, they began to suspectthat he was actually the most ruthless killer in British legal history.It is clear from what we know about his life and background that Shipman was notone of those people who impress others with their vitality and charisma. On thecontrary, he seemed a rather quiet and colourless little man. Born in Nottinghamin 1946, he struggled out of his dull working-class background because he wantedto live up to the expectations of his mother, Vera. ‘Fred’ was her favourite,and she deeply believed in him. When she died of cancer when he was 17, he felthe had to justify her belief in him, and in spite of an initial failure, gotinto Leeds University Medical School, where he was a less than brilliantstudent.His problem was always a certain lack of self-belief. At medical school heremained a loner, without close friends and without even that indispensableappendage of the randy medical student, a girlfriend.Then came the event that transformed his life. On the bus that took him tomedical school every morning, he noticed a plump, quiet girl among theteenagers. Primrose Oxtoby was a ‘plain Jane’, who was completely under thethumb of her parents. They were so strait-laced that they would not even allowher to attend a youth club – and Primrose would never have dreamed of trying toassert herself.She was three years Shipman’s junior, and when he realised that she regarded himwith wide-eyed admiration, he was hooked. Because she adored him, this quiet,shy virgin became an addiction. Unfortunately, soon after she surrendered hervirginity, she discovered she was pregnant. They married in 1966, but herparents were so shocked that they disowned her.Shipman later admitted her pregnancy was ‘a mistake’. But it was a mistake hehad to live with, and his daydreams of a great career in medicine were over. AndPrimrose was not even a very good housekeeper – police who later came to searchtheir house were shocked by the dirt and general untidiness.There followed three years in which Shipman was a junior houseman in PontefractGeneral Infirmary. It was dull, grinding work, and by now there was a secondbaby.His first professional appointment as a GP came in March 1974, in the small townof Todmorden, in the Pennines. And it was there Dr Shipman became a drug addict.He claimed later that he began taking pethidine, a morphine derivative, becauseof a back injury. Whether the excuse was true or not, Shipman certainly foundthat pethidine made life seem brighter and more bearable. He obtained the drugby forging prescriptions or over prescribing it for patients who needed it, thenkeeping the extra.One year later, Dr John Dacre, a senior partner in the practice, checked theprescriptions and asked Shipman what was happening. Shipman confessed, andbegged for a second chance. This was denied him, and at his trial for forgingprescriptions in February 1976, he was temporarily suspended as a doctor andfined £658. Primrose had to temporarily return to live with her disdainfulfamily.And it was probably after his drug habit had been exposed that Shipman turnedinto a killer. At least one man in Todmorden, the husband of Eva Lyons – who wasdying of cancer – believed that Shipman injected his elderly wife with anoverdose of morphine as a ‘mercy killing’. Soon thereafter, eight more elderlypatients were found dead after Shipman had been to see them.It was a year later, in 1977, that Shipman became a member of the DonnybrookHouse practice in Hyde, Greater Manchester, an area made notorious by formerresident Ian Brady (see here) [../Text/chapter_006.xhtml#page_232].By this time Shipman had developed the characteristics of a male whose attemptsto express his dominance have always been frustrated: touchiness and swollenself-esteem. He enjoyed bullying, and taking his frustrations out on those overwhom he had authority. He was once so brutal to a young female drugsrepresentative, out on her first assignment, that she burst into tears. If areceptionist forgot his coffee, he was seen to go white with rage. And when hiswife once rang him to say that she and the kids were hungry and waiting to eatdinner he snapped: ‘You’ll wait until I get there.’Oddly enough, his patients felt that he was the ideal doctor – caring, patientand endlessly helpful. But then, a man of Shipman’s immense self-centrednesswould have wanted to be seen as a good doctor: it was important to him to beadmired. But for those who had nothing to contribute to his self-esteem, hecould scarcely bring himself to be polite.Shipman came under suspicion after the sudden death of elderly patient KathleenGrundy, on June 24, 1998. Mrs Grundy had apparently left a will in which herconsiderable fortune – over £300,000 – was left to her doctor, Harold Shipman.But the will was carelessly typed, and two witnesses who had also signed itwould later explain that they had d one so as a favour to Dr Shipman, who hadfolded the paper so they could not see what they were signing.Mrs Grundy’s daughter, Angela Woodruff, reported her suspicions to the police.Detective Inspector Stan Egerton noted that this looked like a case of attemptedfraud. But could it be more than that? The death rate among Shipman’s patients,especially elderly women, was remarkably high. On the other hand, there seemedto be no other cases in which Shipman had actually benefited from the death ofone of them, at least, not in their wills. (In fact, when Shipman was finallyarrested, police found a large quantity of valuable but old-fashioned jewellery– worth around £10,000 – which was apparently stolen from dead patients.)The above average death rate had been noted by one of Shipman’s colleagues, DrLinda Reynolds. In 1997, she had realised that Shipman seemed to have beenpresent at the deaths of an unusually high number of patients – three times asmany as might have been expected – and reported her suspicions to the localcoroner. This all came to nothing because there seemed to be no reason why apopular GP should kill his patients.Mrs Grundy’s body was now exhumed, and the post mortem showed that she had diedof an overdose of morphine. (This is easy to detect because morphine remains inthe system for a long time after death.) After that, another fourteenexhumations of Shipman’s patients revealed the same thing. Moreover, it wasclear that these fifteen were only a small proportion of the victims.When he was questioned on suspicion of fifteen murders, Shipman angrily deniedany wrongdoing. He was sure that he had covered his trail so carefully that hewas safe, but the investigators soon discovered that he had made extensivechanges in his patients’ records to make them seem more ill than they actuallywere. He was almost certainly unaware that the computer automatically registeredthe date and time of every one of these changes.On 7 October 1998, Shipman was full of self-confidence when he was interviewedby the police and confronted with evidence of his crimes. But when a womanDetective Constable began to question him about changes he had made in thepatients’ records, pointing out that many of them had been made within minutesof the death of the patient, he began to falter and flounder. That evening hebroke down and sobbed.Yet there was no confession. From that moment onward, he simply refused tocooperate during interviews, often sitting with his back to the interviewer andrefusing to speak.In most cases of serial murder, there is a clear sexual element. Where Shipmanwas concerned, the only hint of a possible sexual hang-up can be found in thecase of 17-year-old Lorraine Leighton, who went to see him about a lump in herbreast. In her case, Shipman abandoned the kindly, sympathetic manner thatendeared him to so many patients, and made such rude comments about the size ofher breasts that she fled the surgery in tears.One thing that seems clear is that Shipman felt no guilt about killing hispatients. After his imprisonment, someone said something that implied acomparison between him and Myra Hindley; Shipman snapped: ‘She is a criminal. Iam not a criminal.’He was given fifteen life sentences for murdering fifteen of his elderlypatients by injecting them with lethal doses of diamorphine (medical heroine).Yet a government report later concluded he possibly murdered between 215 and 260people over the 23-year period of his general practice.Statistically speaking, Shipman had 236 more in-home patient deaths than wouldnormally be expected for an average doctor working in the geographical areasthat he did. Unfortunately, as Shipman was found hanged in his cell on themorning of 13 January 2004, and disinterment and effective forensic autopsies onso many bodies is practically impossible, we will probably never know just howmany people Harold Shipman murdered.Why he became a murderer is also difficult to comprehend. Unlike most serialkillers, there seems to have been no sexual or sadistic element to Shipman’smurders: he killed most of his victims in their own homes, convincing them thathe was giving them a normal, harmless drugs injection, soothing them beforeadministering the fatal dose with his most gentle bedside manner and, as oftenas not, a nice cup of tea. But these were definitely not mercy killings:although all his known victims were elderly, few were actually seriously ill oreven in particular discomfort.As Shipman is now dead, apparently leaving no confession or diaries, we can onlyguess at why he killed. One possibly important fact may be that Shipman, at theage of seventeen, had watched his mother die of lung cancer. He would hurry homefrom college to comfort and chat with her, but it was only a daily injection ofmorphine, given by her GP, that visibly eased her pain.Was Shipman masochistically re-enacting his mother’s own death each time heinjected a lethal dose of diamorphine into an elderly patient? Given hischaracter, it seems more likely that he simply enjoyed the god-like power ofhanding out death. To him his victims, like everyone else in his life, lived anddied for the sole purpose of feeding his bloated ego.The Snowtown Bodies in Barrels CaseEvidence of Australia’s worst known case of serial killing was first discoveredin Snowtown, a tiny hamlet of just over five hundred inhabitants about a hundredmiles north of the city of Adelaide. On 20 May 1999, police in Adelaide searcheda derelict bank and found six black plastic barrels in the abandoned vault. Thebarrels contained the remains of eight corpses, some dismembered and allpartially dissolved in hydrochloric acid.Forensic investigation revealed that the barrels had only recently been hiddenin the vault, while most of the victims had been dead for months or years.Evidence of at least one murder was also found in the vault itself, togetherwith a variety of gruesome implements. These included ropes and electrical tape,a selection of knives, a shotgun, a saw covered in dried blood and a weldingmachine that could administer powerful electric shocks. Pathologists examiningthe human remains found evidence that these items had been used to torture thevictims before they were killed.The day following the discovery, investigating officers arrested three men inthe northern suburbs of Adelaide: John Justin Bunting, aged 32, Robert JoeWagner, 27, and Mark Ray Haydon, 40. A few days later they also arrested JamesSpyridon Vlassakis, aged 19. Digging in Bunting’s garden at that time alsouncovered two more corpses.As the investigation and identification of the victims progressed, a bizarrestory emerged. The ringleader of the killers was John Bunting, a short butpowerfully built abattoir worker, originally from Queensland. Questioning theteenager Vlassakis, who turned Queen’s evidence to get a lighter sentence,revealed Bunting’s declared motivation for the murders: he claimed to be acrusader for justice.Police forces around the globe dread and generally make great efforts to arrestvigilantes, since such people generally go beyond the law to punish those thatthey feel are ‘the real criminals’. In John Bunting’s case, however, he hadbecome a far worse monster than any of the victims that he had chosen for‘execution’.Even on the most cursory examination, Bunting’s claim to be a hero – doing thejob that he felt that the police and justice system failed to do – was obviouslya self-delusional sham. He particularly targeted anyone known or rumoured to bea paedophile, but he also tortured and murdered people for being gay, becausethey used illegal drugs and, in one case, for being obese. This, combined withhis willingness to accept the flimsiest rumour as definite proof that someonewas a paedophile, indicates that Bunting’s vigilantism was merely a cover forhis own sadistic and homicidal tendencies.Unfortunately, at the time of writing, many details of the Bunting case remainuncertain, largely because the authorities have placed a large number ofsuppression orders on matters pertaining to it – over 250, in fact. Indeed, oneof these uncertain details is just why so many suppression orders are necessary.It seems that Bunting was himself an abused child, from which experience,presumably, sprang his pathological hatred of homosexuals and paedophiles.Bunting had arrived in Adelaide in the early 1980s, intending to move on toPerth, but his car broke down and he never found the motivation to move on.Bunting’s first contact with the Adelaide gay community came through his thenlover, Suzanne Allen. Through her he met, and pretended to befriend, a localtransvestite and paedophile called Barry Lane. Sometime in the early 1990s Lane,in turn, introduced Bunting to Robert Joe Wagner. Like Bunting, Wagner had beensexually abused as a child. He had run away from home at fourteen and had endedup under Barry Lane’s ‘protection’. Although heterosexual, Wagner had beenforced to be Lane’s lover for four years. He was thus, understandably, filledwith seething resentment. Bunting got Wagner away from Lane’s clutches and beganto mould his anger into something that he could use in his own plans.Their first victim was another former lover of Lane’s: 22-year-old ClintonTrevise. In August 1992, Bunting and Wagner persuaded him to come on a ‘socialvisit’ to Bunting’s home. There they beat him to death with a shovel, then theydrove his corpse to the suburb of Lower Light in North Adelaide and buried it.Police found Trevise’s skeleton two years later but, at the time, the murderinvestigation went nowhere.The now twenty-year-old Robert Wagner continued to be Bunting’s main informanton the local gay community. Using information gleaned from him, Bunting setabout designing what he called his ‘spider wall’ – a collection of names, linkedby pieces of string to indicate who knew whom. It was over this map that Buntingendlessly plotted his future killings.In the meantime Bunting had taken a new lover, a middle-aged mother of twocalled Elizabeth Harvey. This did not end his friendship with Suzanne Allen,however, and it was through her that he found his next victim. In 1995 Allen hadrented out the caravan in her garden to a mentally handicapped man called RayDavies. Allen’s daughter accused Davies of being a paedophile, and this alonewas enough evidence to convince Bunting. In December 1995, he and ElizabethHarvey kidnapped and tortured Davies, then murdered him. His body was buried inBunting’s back yard.It is not known if Suzanne Allen knew about or objected to Bunting’s killing ofher tenant. She herself disappeared in 1996. Bunting later claimed that he andWagner had found her lying dead in her home of an apparent heart attack. So thepair of them dismembered her corpse and buried it in the same unmarked grave inwhich they had dumped Davies.In 1997 Bunting in stigated three killings. The first, in April, wasnineteen-year-old Michael Gardiner whose only ‘crime’ seems to have been that hewas openly homosexual – Bunting described him as ‘the biggest homo’.Next Bunting decided to kill Robert Wagner’s former abuser, Barry Lane. For thiskilling he and Wagner recruited another of Lane’s ex-lovers, eighteen-year-oldThomas Trevilyan. Lane was tortured by having his toes crushed with a pair ofpliers before he was strangled.Finally, that year Bunting and Wagner killed their fellow murderer, ThomasTrevilyan. He had spoken in public about the murder of Lane, so they decided tosilence him with a fake suicide. They hanged him from a tree in the hills nearAdelaide.Over the past few years James Vlassakis – the teenaged son of Bunting’s loverand fellow murderer Elizabeth Harvey – had also fallen under the older man’scharismatic spell. It therefore must have come as something of a surprise to himwhen, in April 1998, he came across Bunting and Wagner stuffing the corpse ofJames’ friend, 29-year-old Gavin Porter, into a barrel full of acid.Porter was neither a homosexual nor a paedophile, but he was a drug addict andhad made the mistake of leaving a spent needle on the sofa in Elizabeth Harvey’shouse. Bunting decided that this was enough reason for Porter to die, andstrangled him in his parked car.If James Vlassakis had found Bunting with just Porter’s body, he might have beenkept out of the murderous conspiracy. Unfortunately Bunting and Wagner haddecided to also get rid of the corpses of Barry Lane and Michael Gardiner innearby barrels. Since they could hardly pretend that Porter was their onlyvictim, they decided to let James into the secret of their ‘vigilantism’. Heseems to have been more than willing to keep their secret, but it was decidedthat James had to be involved in a killing too, just to make sure he had noincentive to go to the police.James told Bunting that his half-brother, 21-year-old Troy Youde, had abused himwhen they were both children. The two boys and their mother were both living inBunting’s house at the time, so it was a simple matter of dragging Troy out ofbed and helping James to murder him. This took place in September 1998.It remains uncertain how Elizabeth Harvey reacted to the disappearance of herson – she must have been at least suspicious knowing, as she did, that Buntingwas a predatory murderer – but Harvey died of cancer in 2001, before herinvolvement in the torture and killing of Ray Davies had come to light.Now that there were three regular members of the murder gang – Bunting, Wagnerand Vlassakis nicknamed themselves ‘the Three Amigos’ – they dropped anypretence that they were acting in the name of justice. A woman called JodieElliot had fallen in love with Bunting, and the gang decided that her mentallyhandicapped son, Fred Brooks aged eighteen, would be a nice, safe target fortheir next murder. Within a month of the killing of Troy Youde, they lured Fredto Bunting’s house. There they spent a long time torturing him – with electricshocks, cigar burns and a lighted sparkler forced up his penis – before theykilled him. Bunting then, with her demanding son out of the way, proposedmarriage to the unsuspecting Jodie Elliot.In November 1998 they spotted another target: 29-year-old Gary O’Dwyer who hadbeen disabled in a car accident and was living on a pension. As with FredBrooks, the Three Amigos had no vigilante reason to torture and kill O’Dwyer;they didn’t even know who he was. But he looked like he wouldn’t be able to putup much of a struggle and, Bunting pointed out, O’Dwyer looked a little likeJames Vlassakis’ dead half-brother.In that same month Bunting also killed Elizabeth Haydon – the sister of JodieElliot. He had two reasons for killing Elizabeth: she had outraged his moralsensibilities when, despite being married to his friend Mark Haydon, she hadadmitted to being attracted to Bunting . . . and she was obese. Bunting killedher while Mark Haydon was out of the house, but admitted the crime when he gotback. Haydon had already been involved in at least the covering up of one of theprevious murders, and apparently took the killing of his wife with equanimity.The two friends dumped her body in a barrel full of acid.The last victim of the gang was the step-brother of James Vlassakis, 21-year-oldDavid Johnson. By this time, in May 1999, the gang had moved the barrelscontaining most of their victims to the abandoned vault in the Snowtown bank.They evidently meant this secret crematory to also be their new base ofoperations, as they lured Johnson there, then tortured and murdered him. In thiscase, their motive seems to have been purely financial – they forced him toreveal his cash card PIN number before they killed him, then emptied his bankaccount.In the meantime, the police were at last closing in on the murderers. ElizabethHaydon’s brother hadn’t believed Mark Haydon’s contradictory explanations forhis wife’s disappearance, so called in the law.Officers were immediately suspicious that a mother of two small children hadgone missing, yet her husband had not bothered to report the matter. Perusal oftheir unsolved files for the area then turned up the fact that Barry Lane andClinton Trevise had been lovers, and that both had known Wagner and Bunting.Since Mark Haydon was a close associate of Bunting and Wagner, the policesuddenly saw that they might have two (or more) disappearances and one death,all linked in the case. Close surveillance of the group led officers to theSnowtown bank vault and the horrific discovery that they had, in fact,discovered the worst known case of Australian serial killing.Tried in 2003, Bunting and Wagner claimed total innocence. Bunting was convictedof eleven murders. In the case of Suzanne Allen – Bunting’s 47-year-old lover,who he claimed to have found dead of natural causes – the jury could not come toa verdict: the body’s dismemberment and decomposition made it impossible todetermine the cause of death. Wagner was convicted of being involved in seven ofthe murders. Both were sentenced to life with no chance of parole. Vlassakis,who had turned Queen’s evidence and pleaded guilty of involvement in three ofthe murders, was given 26 years.Mark Haydon eventually admitted to assisting in two murders after-the-fact –that of his wife and of Troy Youde. Further charges were dropped for lack ofevidence and Haydon was convicted on seven counts of assisting murder and wassentenced to 26 years.The impact of the killings on the Snowtown and the North Adelaide areas wasgrim. Residents of the tiny Snowtown even considered changing the municipality’sname in the hopes of putting off the steady stream of ghoulish sightseers whowished to see (and smell) the vault that had contained the half-dissolvedbodies.And fans of Australian rules football, when watching games played againstAdelaide’s team, have been heard to chant derisively: ‘BODIES IN A BARREL! YOUKEEP YOUR BODIES IN A BARREL!’The Washington DC SniperThe classic 1971 cop movie, Dirty Harry, was largely based on the real-life‘Zodiac’ murders that took place around the San Francisco Bay area in the late1960s (see here [../Text/chapter_008.xhtml#page_305]). However, the scriptwriters made one significant change to the modus operandi of their fictionalserial killer: he used a sniper rifle to kill from a distance.Fortunately this seemed to be more of a flight of fantasy – perhaps inspired bythe frequent sniper killings made by both sides during the Vietnam War – thansomething that a real serial killer might do. As the reader will have seen againand again in this book, serial killers are typically sadists who like to beclose to their victims to more intensely enjoy the sense of power they get fromending lives. No serial killer has been known to use sniper rifle as their mainmethod of killing . . . until the turn of the 21st century, that is.On the 2 October 2002, James D Spring, a program analyst at the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration, was crossing a car park in the Weaton districtof Washington DC. There was the crack of a gunshot and Spring was hurled to theground; he had been shot dead by a single, high-velocity rifle bullet.It was immediately plain to investigators that this was no ordinary murder –even in crime-riddled DC, police rarely see murders by sniper fire. The highvelocity rifle is a specialist weapon demanding specialist skills; it’s not thesort of gun used in gang drive-by shootings. Moreover, whoever had killed JamesSpring had done so expertly with a single shot, suggesting either military orparamilitary training. Given the events of 11 September, just over a yearbefore, some officers feared that the murder had been a terrorist incident.Over the following 24 hours – between 3 and 4 October – five more DC residentswere killed by long-range sniper shots. James Buchanan, aged 39, was killedwhile cutting the grass at a car dealership in the White Flint area. PrenkumarWalekar, a 54-year-old taxi driver, was killed as he filled up with petrol at astation in the Aspen Hill area. Sarah Ramos, a 34-year-old mother, was killedwhile reading a magazine on a bench outside a post office in the Silver Springdistrict. Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera, aged 25, was killed as she vacuumed her van ata petrol station in Kensington district. The last fatality that grim day was aretired 72-year-old carpenter, Pascal Charlot, who was killed while standing ata bus stop in the inner city – however, he was not the last victim. A43-year-old woman was also shot while crossing a parking lot in Fredericksburg –a town 40 miles south of Washington DC – but fortunately she survived.The assassin clearly liked to move about and had wasted no time. One harassedpolice officer grimly commented that his local county homicide rate ‘just wentup 25 per cent today’.This concentration of murders in such a short period suggested either aterrorist operation or a so-called ‘spree killer’. At this stage, few policeofficers thought it likely that they had a serial killer on their hands.The difference between a spree killer and a serial killer is not just one oftime, but of motive. Serial killers are cold and ruthless hunters, taking a lonevictim at a time, cautiously, usually over a period of weeks, months, years andeven decades. Spree killers, on the other hand, murder lots of people then,after a few hours, generally turn the gun on themselves.What evidence we have (since such murderers are almost never taken alive to giveconfessions) is that spree killers egotistically decide to sacrifice others,before they kill themselves, as a bloody and final act of defiance to the worldthat they are rejecting. The difference seems to be that serial killers areessentially sadistic perverts (disinclined to risk their liberty, let alonephysically endanger themselves) while spree killers are often social misfits whobecome homicidally violent after suffering a massive mental breakdown. Leavingaside the actual killing, the difference in motivation between a serial killerand a spree killer is as wide as the difference between that of a rapist and asuicide bomber.Panic spread across Washington DC as soon as the story hit the broadcast news: asniper was stalking the capital and nobody was safe. Some people refused toleave their homes and many didn’t dare use self-service petrol stations as theseseemed one of the killer’s favourite hunting areas. Suddenly, DC residents had ahorrible taste of what life had been like in Sarajevo during the 1990s Yugoslavcivil war.After a few days’ pause, the killing began again. A thirteen-year-old boy wasshot in the stomach as he got off his school bus in the Maryland suburbs ofWashington DC. Surgeons struggled to save his life, but he died of massiveinternal injuries. The following day, the killer returned to the scene of theboy’s murder and left a tarot card with the words: ‘Dear Mr Policeman. I am God’written on it.On 9 October, the sniper once again moved away from the suburbs of WashingtonDC, killing civil engineer Dean Harold Meyers, 53, at a petrol station in theVirginia town of Manassas. Two days later, Kenneth H Bridges, 53, was shot deadat a petrol station near the town of Fredericksburg. On 14 October, the sniperkilled Linda Franklin, aged 47, who was shot as she and her husband loaded theircar outside a shop at the Seven Corners Shopping Centre, on one of northernVirginia’s busiest intersections. Ironically, Linda Franklin was an FBI analyst.On 19 October, the sniper attacked what was to be his last victim. A 37-year-oldman was shot once in the stomach as he left a restaurant in the town of Ashland,70 miles south of Washington. He suffered severe damage to his internal organs,but survived.Suspicion that the sniper might be an Islamic terrorist seemed partly scotchedby the bizarre tarot card note left at a crime scene: no radical Moslem wouldclaim to be ‘God’, not even in jest. More evidence to this effect came in theform of a letter found at the Ashland crime scene. The writer again referred tohimself as God, and accused the police of incompetence – adding that it wastheir fault that five people had had to die. Presumably this indicated that hehad expected to be caught after the first two days of his killing spree. Theletter demanded a $10 million ransom to stop the killings and added chillingly:‘Your children are not safe anywhere or at anytime.’ So, the sniper wasapparently a murderous extortionist, not an Islamic terrorist.By this stage the police were, understandably, becoming desperate. In an attemptto pacify the sniper they even complied with a bizarre demand he had made. Apolice spokesman read the statement ‘we’ve caught the sniper like a duck in anoose’ on national television. This was a cryptic reference to a folk tale inwhich an overconfident rabbit tried to catch a duck, but ended up noosed itself.The sniper evidently wanted the authorities to feel that they were hisplaythings as much as his murder victims were.Then, on 24 October, the police caught him . . . or rather, them. There turnedout to be two perpetrators working together: John Allen Muhammad, aged 41, andJohn Lee Malvo, aged 17, the older Afro-American, the younger Afro-Jamaican. Amember of the public had noticed a car parked for a long time in a road stop onthe Virginia Interstate Route 70, and had become suspicious. The police wereinformed and investigated as a matter of routine – having little thought thatthey were about to catch the Washington Sniper. Muhammad and Malvo were foundfast asleep in the car, but fortunately the officers did not simply move themon. Closer inspection of the vehicle showed that it had been modified to allow aman to lie inside it and to aim a rifle while remaining unseen.Muhammad, who seems to have done all the actual killing, turned out to have beenan ex-US Army soldier who had served in the 1992 Gulf War and had subsequentlyconverted to Islam. Lee Malvo was a Jamaican who lived with Muhammad andevidently regarded the older man as a father figure (nobody has ever suggestedthere was a sexual relationship between the pair). Both were convicted ofmurder, extortion and terrorism charges in 2003. Muhammad was sentenced to deathand Malvo to life imprisonment without chance of parole.Malvo originally claimed to have been the sole killer – called the ‘triggerman’in Virginia state law – but later retracted this confession, admitting that hehad only made it to move the potential death sentence onto his own shoulders.This was rather less heroic than it at first sounds because, being a minor atthe time of the killings, he was much less likely to actually be executed.Malvo also claimed that Muhammad was a convert to the Nation of Islam – anIslamic black separatist movement – and had told him that the killings weresolely to extort money from the white-dominated US government. This money, hewent on, would be used to fund a separate nation that could be populated solelyby young black people (and the middle-aged Muhammad himself, presumably).The fact that such a goal was patently impossible – given international law, thecertain tracing of the extortion money and numerous laws that protect youngpeople of all races – suggests that Muhammad was spinning a tale to his youngfriend to justify his urge to kill. It seems certain that Muhammad was simply aserial killer – a man addicted to murder. Support for this explanation came whenit was suggested that the Washington DC killings had not been his first.Investigating police believed that Muhammad was responsible for several as yetunsolved murders."},{"pageContent":"BibliographyAll His Father’s Sins (The Gallego Case), Ray Biondi and Walt Hecox, PrimaPublishing Co., 1988.Federal Bureau of Investigation: Criminal Investigation.Analysis/Sexual Homicide, 1985 (Law Enforcement Bulletins, 1980, 1985, 1986).The Boston Strangler, Gerold Frank, New American Library, 1966.Before I Kill More (The Heirens Case), Lucy Freeman, Award Books, 1955.The Trial of Brady and Hindley, edited by Jonathan Goodman, David and Charles,1973.Killing for Company (Nilsen), Brian Masters, Jonathan Cape, 1985.The Nilsen File, Brian McConnel and Douglas Bence, Futura Macdonald, London1983.Serial Killers: The Growing Menace, Joel Norris, Doubleday, New York, 1988.Killer, A Journal of Murder (the Autobiography of Carl Panzram), edited by JamesE.
