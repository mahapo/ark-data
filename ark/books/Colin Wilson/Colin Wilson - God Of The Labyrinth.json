He left school at 16 and worked atvarious jobs while reading and writing in his spare time. His study The Outsiderwas published by Victor Gollancz in 1956 and became an overnight sensation inEngland and America, bringing widespread popular and critical attention to its24-year-old author; the book has never been out of print. He followed TheOutsider with two further nonfiction works, Religion and the Rebel (1957) andThe Age of Defeat (1959), which were not as well received, before turning tofiction in 1960 with Ritual in the Dark, a novel he had worked on since age 17.He continued to write prolifically in numerous genres, both fiction andnonfiction, including works on the occult, crime, and serial killers. Hisextensive output of fiction includes two subsequent novels featuring GerardSorme, the protagonist of Ritual in the Dark—Man Without a Shadow (1963) and TheGod of the Labyrinth (1970)—as well as novels in the vein of H. P. Lovecraft,including The Mind Parasites (1967) and The Philosopher’s Stone (1969).Wilson has published more than 150 books and resides with his wife Joy inCornwall, where he has lived for more than fifty years. Gary Lachman (b. 1955) was born in Bayonne, New Jersey, but has lived in Londonsince 1996. A founding member of the rock group Blondie, he is now a full-timewriter with more than a dozen books to his name, on topics ranging from theevolution of consciousness and the western esoteric tradition, to literature andsuicide, and the history of popular culture. Lachman writes frequently for manyjournals in the United States and United Kingdom, and lectures on his work inthe U.S., U.K., and Europe.

CorleySet in Dante MT 11/13.2 INTRODUCTION No Mean Minotaur Anyone familiar with Colin Wilson’s work will know that throughout it all runs aparticularly vital thread: his obsession with sex. From his first book TheOutsider, which begins with the anti-hero of Henri Barbusse’s novel Hellcatching a glimpse up a wind-blown skirt, to later works like The Misfits,Superconsciousness, and The Angry Years, Wilson has maintained a tenaciousanalytical grip on what he calls the ‘sexual illusion’. But although for sheerentertainment and stimulation his prose passes muster with more well-known andintentionally erotic writers such as D.H. Lawrence and Henry Miller, Wilson’sfascination with sex is never aimed at the act itself. Sex, for Wilson, isimportant because of what it can tell us about his other lifelong obsession:consciousness. Through practically all his work, from the first Gerard Sormenovel Ritual in the Dark to mammoth studies like The Criminal History ofMankind, Wilson has been erecting—if I may put it that way—a phenomenology ofsex. And if his Origins of the Sexual Impulse—an entry in his ‘OutsiderCycle’—brings to bear some of the insights of Edmund Husserl and Alfred NorthWhitehead upon the problem of sex, in The God of the Labyrinth he resolutelyleads this philosophy to the bedroom. But don’t worry: both the philosophy andthe sex in Wilson’s third Sorme novel are more interesting and exciting thananything the Marquis de Sade got up to in his boudoir.I first discovered The God of the Labyrinth in the late 1970s in Los Angeles, ina wonderful old bookshop, Papa Bach, that sadly no longer exists. For somereason they kept a large supply of UK imports and by the time I came upon the1972 Mayflower paperback edition of The God of the Labyrinth, with its fleshycover, I had already added The Mind Parasites and The Black Room to myburgeoning Wilson library. (The Mind Parasites, by the way, is one of the fewWilson novels without a good helping of sex; The Black Room however has enoughfor two.) For Wilson sex is the closest that most of us get to a mysticalexperience. It reveals a powerhouse of energy and purpose that, for the mostpart, remains hidden from us. This inner force—what Wilson, borrowing fromHusserl, calls ‘intentionality’—can be elicited by crisis or threat, or even bya determined act of concentration. It can also arrive unbidden, of its ownvolition, in what G.K. Chesterton called a sense of ‘absurd good news’. But itis most pleasantly, immediately, and effectively awakened by sex.And this, indeed, is what Gerard Sorme, Wilson’s fictional alter-ego, discoversas he, and his own alter-ego, the philosopher-rake Esmond Donelly, deflowermaidens and relax the virtue of worthy women in two centuries and on twocontinents.The God of the Labyrinth is a kind of sexual Pilgrim’s Progress, and the titleof the expurgated American edition, The Hedonists, makes this clear. Sorme makeshis way through nymphomaniacs, sadists, masochists, pyromaniacs, lascivioushypnotists, erotic philosophers, fetishists, and a sexual secret society.Through it all he repeatedly asks what seems a ridiculously naïve question: ‘Whyshould a man want to thrust his erect penis into a woman?’ Neither De Sade norLawrence nor Miller actually ever asked this question. I can’t think of anywriter on sex who really does, from the erotically deadpan Michel Houellebecq tothe radical Freudian Otto Gross. They all accept it as a given, simply ‘how itis’. Even that arch dark magician of sex, Aleister Crowley, the model forCaradoc Cunningham in the second Sorme novel Man Without a Shadow (otherwiseknown as The Sex Diary of Gerard Sorme), never actually poses this question. Butphenomenology, as Wilson knows, is about jamming an epistemological crowbarunder such implicit, ‘obvious’ givens as the fact that when aroused all a manwants to do is to enter that warm embrace. What Wilson discovers is thatalthough the sensual pleasure of sex is indeed delightful, the real location ofecstasy is not in the genitals but the mind. Asking why a man wants to inserthis penis into a woman’s vagina is like asking why the mind wants to know andunderstand itself and the universe. Both are about penetrating the unknown,piercing the darkness, and entering a strange, mysterious world.And what happens when we do manage this is remarkable. ‘Human beings are likecar tyres,’ Wilson tells us. ‘To get the best results, you need to keep theminflated.’ We can think of sex as a kind of air pump. When gripped by the sexualillusion our tires become rock hard. Yet, soon after, they spring a leak and thepressure drops. What Wilson has been trying to do for more than half a centuryis to discover a way of keeping our tires hard, so that they can cover anyterrain. That is, of keeping the mind, not the penis, erect. We can think of itas a kind of mental Viagra. One way of doing this is to recognize that it is theinner concentration triggered by sex, and not the sex itself, that does thetrick.What fascinates Sorme/Wilson is ‘the gap between the mind and reality.’ Likethreat, crisis, or an unusual effort of concentration, sex can bridge the gap.Yet when the spell passes, it returns, and that hair’s breadth distance makesall the difference between being alive and merely living. De Sade, Casanova,Crowley, Georges Bataille and other seekers of some ultimate sexual releasespent their lives pursuing a phantom, thinking that it was the sex itself thatgave them reality, as if Proust went on eating madeleines, hoping for anotherwhiff of Combray, instead of getting on with writing À la recherche du tempsperdu. Yet Proust knew that Combray was not in the madeleine, but in his mind.Esmond Donelly knows this too, and his taste for sweets—for him bedding womenwas just a piece of cake—soon passes to more serious fare.I have concentrated on the philosophical element of this novel, but its literaryqualities are considerable too. Well in advance of Umberto Eco or Dan Brown,Wilson is writing about a mysterious secret organization, in existence forcenturies, whose members come from the upper echelons of society. Theinspiration for the book came from Borges, and Wilson takes the Borgesianliterary detective tale, with its blend of real and fictional scholarship, andruns with it. Wilson is also in advance of the postmodern appropriation ofpopular culture, using specific literary forms self-consciously, forphilosophical purposes. He has written science-fiction, detective, horror, spy,police procedure, and in this case even erotic novels, using each as scaffoldingfor his phenomenological pursuits. His ‘timeslips’ into 18th centuryIreland—similar to those in The Philosopher’s Stone—are very much like thosePeter Ackroyd uses in his novels Hawksmoor and The House of Doctor Dee. Onereason why Wilson’s literary value is overlooked in his native country, I think,is that, unlike Ackroyd, he has an optimistic outlook and takes ideas seriously,something that is apparently not done among British literati. Yet recently, someliterary heavy-hitters like Philip Pullman have spoken out against the idiocy ofignoring Wilson’s work. It’s about time and the literary generation who turnedtheir noses up at the indefatigable Outsider is long gone anyway.The God of the Labyrinth has all the best elements of Wilson’s fictions. It is agripping philosophical-erotic detective story, packed with ideas and convincingmystical and sexual encounters which leave the reader with a powerfullyincreased sense of the sheer possibilities of life. That I would say is thecentral effect of Wilson’s fiction: that it shows us how interesting thingsreally are, and that the power of making them interesting lies in our own minds.His prose often has the power to elicit that inner force of intentionality thatis the subject of everything he writes. In this sense, reading Wilson onintentionality makes one’s consciousness more intentional. A neat trick that allgood writing pulls off: of making the mind more awake. Valancourt Books shouldbe applauded for making this and other of Wilson’s fiction available for a newgeneration, and I am grateful to them for having an excuse to return once againto the adventures of Gerard Sorme. ‘We have to master the strange trick ofallowing the body to remain quiescent, while pushing the mind to exploreinterior savannahs and mountain ranges,’ Sorme/Wilson tells us. They are right.So sit back, relax, and get ready to enter a very exciting labyrinth.

God keep from harm the one whose long codpiece has been worth tohim, in one day, one hundred and sixty thousand and nine crowns. God keep fromhurt the one who, by his long codpiece, has saved a whole city from dying offamine. And by God, I’m going to make a book On the Advantages of Long Codpiecesas soon as I have time’.In fact, he did compose a large book, and a very good one, complete withdiagrams; but it has not been published yet, as far as I know.Rabelais, Bk II, Ch. 15 Esmond Donelly died in December 1832, at the age of eighty-four. Towards the endof his life, he became fascinated by numbers, and corresponded with the greatmathematician Gauss, who quotes him in the preface to the fifth edition of theDisquisitiones Arithmeticae. It is in one of his letters to Gauss that Esmondspeaks about the ‘magical’ properties of the number 137—which is, of course, aprime. Coming across a copy of this letter the other day in the archives of MrXalide Nuri, I was thrilled to realise that this book will be published exactly137 years after Esmond’s death. I take it as an auspicious sign. The story of my ‘quest for Esmond Donelly’ begins on April 10 of this year. InJanuary, I had flown to New York to begin a lecture tour that took me fromFlorida to Maine, from New Mexico to Seattle. I had taken my family with me—mywife Diana and my daughter Maureen (Mopsy), aged three, but since it wasimpractical for them to travel with me, they stayed with friends in New Haven,and I spent weekends with them whenever I was on the east coast. After twomonths or so of one-night-stands, the strain was beginning to tell, and Istruggled to pre­serve a degree of detachment by writing every day in a journalnotebook. On re-reading these entries recently, it struck me that there could beno simpler way of beginning this account than quoting them exactly as I wrotethem. April 10, 1969It is eight thirty in the morning, eastern time—five thirty for me, since I flewin from Portland, Oregon, yesterday. I am propped up on my bed in the campusguest room, drinking tea and eating buttered whole-wheat biscuits; at ninethirty I have to address convocation. They tell me Dylan Thomas slept in thisroom, and caused a scandal by allowing the football team from Koyukuk, the maleuniversity on the other side of town, to sleep on the floor and vomit in thewashbasin. That man’s energy must have been fantastic. After nine weeks oflecturing around America, I’m in a state of glassy-eyed exhaustion. I alwaysknow when I’m getting run-down because objects suddenly take on a curious,intense quality. Diana packed me a cake of ordinary green kitchen soap—motelsprovide tiny cakes that slip out of your hand in the shower—and when I went topick it up this morning I had to stop and stare. It’s hard to explain thesensation. It wasn’t simply that it seemed as green as a piece of malachite; italso seemed soft, almost fuzzy, as if it was trying to expand. Seen in thesemoments, objects seem to have another dimension or sense: hardness, colour,smell, taste . . . and something else, quite distinct from these. In a humanbeing you might call it person­ality, or even soul.I walk around the room in this dream-like state, feeling like a new-born baby;oddly helpless, yet strangely happy. When I poured hot water on this tea—sent tous from Findlater’s in Dublin—I had a momentary sensation of dissolving in therising steam, and the smell of the tea became exotic, almost frightening.These tours are killing. My agent wants me to do another one next year, but theidea revolts me. The best moments are sitting alone on airports, eatinghamburgers and drinking fresh orange juice. Occasionally in these moments, Iachieve a beautiful detach­ment, a sense of the sheer size of this country, andfeel suddenly contented. It also happened two nights ago, sitting in the motelbar in Portland, watching cars and buses slashing through the black rain,tearing the reflection of the neon sign into red shrap­nel. And I never fail toexperience a certain delight as I approach an airport bookstall, even if I onlyhave five minutes between changing planes, and I already have more paperbacksthan I can carry. At O’Hare yesterday, I bought Apollinaire’s DebauchedHospodar, a surrealistic piece of pornography, and I read about the poor devil’smiserable life while waiting for the plane. And then it came to me with greatclarity: my business and the business of all writers: to refuse to be a part ofeveryday life, to stand aside, even if this demands a pose of brutality ornihilism. We must not be absorbed. There is a perfectly simple relation betweenthe mind and its environment. The environment carries us along like a stream,and the mind is like a small engine that can carry the boat upstream—or at leastenable it to stay in the same place. While the engine works, man isfundamentally healthy; if it stops, he is no better than a piece of driftwood. Convocation went well enough—I talked about the nature of poetry and mysticism.Afterwards, half a dozen girls dragged me along to the Coffee Shop and asked mequestions. They’d all read my Diary (which the American publisher issued underthe sickening title The Sex Diary of Gerard Sorme—a court case about it inBoston cost me every bloody penny of the royalties), and they were full ofquestions about Cunningham. Strange—that even through the unflattering medium ofmy pages, Cun­ningham’s personality can still exercise its fascination overgirls. I’d love to see him turned loose in an American girls’ college—I think hewould have met his match. The most aggressive sexual impulse in the world woulddrown in this sea of unripe American girlhood. At the University of Portland, Igave a seminar with the girls sitting around in a circle—a marvellous panoramaof long legs and mini-skirts. But when a group of them took me out to lunch, Irealised that the American girl hasn’t changed since James’s Daisy Miller. Theapples look appetising enough, but they turn out to be made of wood.A curious coincidence. I had lunch with Mervyn Dillard, head of the Englishdepartment here, and he asked me if I knew any­thing about Esmond Donelly.Apparently Donelly was a famous Irish rake, contemporary of Sheridan, who spenthis life begetting bastards in the area of Galway. Some of his correspondencewith Rousseau was published in Berne around 1800 under the title Of theDeflowering of Maids, although apparently his family declared the work to be aforgery. Now Grove Press are issuing the book in America, with an Introductionby Mervyn Dillard. I told Dillard that I’ve lived in Galway for seven years andnever heard of Donelly. Either he’s been totally forgotten, or his memory hasbeen suppressed.When I got back to the guest room, there was an envelope from my agent full ofmail, including a letter from some people called Linden Press, which I inserthere: Linden Press, 565 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016April 6, 1969Dear Mr Sorme,I gather from the interview in the New York Times Book Review that you arelecturing over here. The interview mentioned that you were returning shortly, soI hope this letter reaches you quickly.I’ve been an admirer of your Sex Diary ever since its publication. The otherday, I remembered that you’d dated the Introduction from Moycullen. In Memoirsof An Irish Rake, which we are publishing in the fall, Esmond Donelly describesseducing both illegitimate daughters of the priest at Moycullen, Father Riordan.In view of your local knowledge, I wonder if you would be interested in writingan Introduction to our edition? I might also add that we would be happy tocommission a book about Donelly, if you should feel any inclination to undertakesuch a work.In the event of your receiving this letter before leaving the country, I wonderif you would call me collect at this number, so we might discuss a meeting?Looking forward to hearing from you, I amYours sincerelyHoward Fleisher Having an hour to spare before the car would take me to the airport, I phonedthe number he gave me. He sounded amiable enough—wasn’t disappointed that I’dnever heard of Donelly before today. I explained that I don’t get into New Yorkuntil late next Friday, and he’ll meet me at Kennedy and take me out to his homeon Long Island. This coincidence about Donelly impresses me. Such things happenwith absurd frequency. The other day, I heard the name of the Russian poetLomonosov on the car radio; a few hours later, I saw it in an encyclopedia whenI was looking up something else. The coincidence made me won­der, so the nexttime I went into a campus book store, I asked the manageress if she’d gotanything by Lomonosov. ‘It’s funny you should ask—a book of his poems came inyesterday.’ I bought it, read the Introduction, and immediately decided I have amagnificent character for a novel. Ten years ago, I would have regarded such aprocedure as superstition. Now I eagerly follow the lead of coincidence. April 11, Wilkes-Barre airportTen minutes before my lecture this morning, the head of the English departmenthanded me my correspondence. There was a letter from Jim Smyth in San Franciscotelling me that Helga Neisse has committed suicide—she jumped from the Berkeleytower, somehow climbing over the protective wire they’ve put there to preventsuch things. I was feeling tired, rather bored, when the letter reached me; assoon as I read it, I seemed to wake up, and the fatigue became an illusion.I also feel guilt, although it is a pointless guilt. I met Helga Neisse throughJim, who attends nude parties where everyone takes psychedelics and the girlspaint their bodies. She was tall, dark-haired, rather listless; she had spentthe previous night with Jim. We spent a couple of hours eating fish and chipsand drink­ing pints of Youngers in the Edinburgh Castle while Jim talkedastrology. He said the war in Vietnam would go on for at least another yearbecause the stars were in conflict. And she suddenly said: Why did the starsbother to influence human existence when it was basically meaningless anyway?Wouldn’t it be better to leave everything to chance? When I mentioned I waslecturing at Berkeley at midday the next day, she offered to drive me out there.She came to the hotel the next morning, and said she’d spent the night readingmy Methods and Techniques of Self-Deception. She certainly looked as if she’dbeen up all night. I hate dis­cussing my books, but I got the feeling she was onthe edge of a breakdown and I ought to try to help. What amazed—and baffled—mewas that she took it absolutely for granted that life is meaningless. She saidthis to me as if she was saying that water was wet. When I tried to explain thatI didn’t think so, she said that this was the message she’d got from my book:human beings are incapable of being honest with themselves, so they turn theirlives into little plays in which they are the central character; they invent thefantasies called religions, philosophies, and so on. I tried to explain that, upto this point, her interpretation was accurate enough; but that I was beingdestructive only to clear the ground for real thinking. What the mysticsexperience is not religion or philosophy, but reality. She asked in ahopeless—almost annoyed—tone: ‘What is reality?’ I said she didn’t have to askthat, because she already knew. If you are thirsty, and you take a long cooldrink, the feeling of the drink going down your throat is reality. It is quitedifferent from talking about a drink, or thinking about one. Human beings alsohave an odd capacity for experiencing a kind of emotional reality (asdistinguished from physical). It was what I experienced the other day with thebar of soap, or what I experience at least once a year when I first smell thespring. The senses seem to go very calm, and you get the sense of really seeingthings, as Wordsworth saw the Thames from Westminster Bridge. And there is afeeling exactly like the real taste of cool water against your throat. I toldher that her feeling of futility was a kind of reality-starvation, whichproduces the same kind of exhaustion and misery as real starvation or thirst.I lectured at Berkeley, and a students’ committee took me out to lunch; Helgacame too. Afterwards, they took us to the top of the clock tower, and our hosttold us that there had been several suicides in the past year or so—one morethan from the similar tower at Stanford. I suppose this gave her the idea.We drove back to town and she talked all the way. Then she said she wanted to dosome shopping, and asked me to go with her. I said firmly that I wanted torest—too many hours of talk­ing and lecturing leave me exhausted. But I invitedher out to a meal in Chinatown. I read Hölderlin and then slept until seven. Shecame to the hotel at eight; we had some wine in my room, then walked toChinatown. She told me she’d spent the afternoon walking around the docks. Ibegan to understand why she seemed so exhausted. We drank Californian wine withthe meal, and she seemed to relax. She talked about her problems—her marriage toa homosexual whom she’d failed to ‘reform’, affairs with various phonies—shecouldn’t resist anything that sounded like a poet, painter or philosopher. And Ibegan to see the real trouble: laziness, weakness, desire for something tohappen to her, for some Avatar to appear and give her the Answer. When we wereinto the second bottle of Almedan, she suddenly became verycomplimentary—explained that she had been trying to meet me since I was here inJanuary. She explained she wasn’t asking anything of me except that I should bea friend, write to her now and then, and so on. I said I’d do my best. ‘It’s notthat I want to sleep with you. I sleep around too much.’ My feeling was thatthere was nothing I wanted less than to sleep with her. On the previous evening,I’d thought her attractive, and rather envied Jim his night with her. And tenyears ago I’d have slept with her anyway, without thinking about theconsequences. Now I was clearly aware that she was trying to bargain with me,offering me something in exchange for something I could give her. I didn’t wantto be her debtor.We spent an hour in the City Lights Bookshop, met some friends of hers, andmoved to a café across the road for more wine. At midnight, I said I had to getback—I had to be up the next morning to lecture at Palo Alto. She said she’dwalk down to Sutter with me because she needed the fresh air. At the corner ofSutter, I tried to persuade her to get into a taxi, and she said she neededcoffee to sober up. So, very reluctantly, I let her come to my room. (The nightclerk is a friend of mine, and only winked.) I didn’t think she had seduction inmind—she seemed to be just lonely—but I was determined it wouldn’t happenanyway. She spent ten minutes in the bathroom while I made coffee. I went in thebathroom, leaving her to pour the coffee, and it reeked of perfume—I still can’timagine what she had been doing with it, for she wasn’t wearing any. When I cameout, she was lying on one of the twin beds with her eyes closed, looking verypale. I asked her if she felt all right and she said no, but she’d be ok in amoment. I put the coffee on the table at the side of the bed, and she reachedout and groped for my hand. Then she said: ‘Would you kiss me please, justonce?’ I was still being paternal; I patted her on the head, said, ‘Yes, yes,all right’, and bent over her. She had a soft and attractive mouth, even thoughthe lower lip was slightly chapped. Kissing her was a shock—like what I’d beensaying to her earlier about swallow­ing a cool drink and merely thinking aboutit. She gave a kind of moan, and lay there passively; when I tried to pull back,she made the same noise in her throat. It was an uncomfortable position—my neckwas aching—so I put one knee on the bed. She suddenly began breathing deeply andregularly, as if im­mensely relieved, and her hand brushed against my trousers,as if by accident, and rested there. The inevitable response occurred. I hadbeen curious all day whether she was wearing stockings or tights. I knew thiswas my last chance. If they were tights, or if she was wearing a panty girdle, Icould linger a moment politely, then tell her to drink her coffee, while myexpectations subsided. If not . . . Her thighs opened as my hand touched herknee; then I reached the bare flesh above the stocking. A moment later, my handreached the crossroads, and I found she was wearing no pants. She must haveremoved them in the bathroom. By this time she’d unzipped my fly and was holdingme. Even at this point, I knew we could stop, even though I was like a batteringram and she was already moving herself against my hand. But it would have seemedpointless. Within seconds, I was inside her. I must admit there was a terrificsurge of sheer delight; it was pure male and female coupling, withoutpersonalities. Her warmth, as she closed around me, seemed predestined. Itlasted only a short time. We were both so excited that we reached a climaxwithin seconds. I lay inside her for a moment, looking at her face; she lookedvery peaceful. Then she said: ‘Let’s take our clothes off and get into bed.’ Itwas a reasonable suggestion, and we followed it. But the rest of the nightwasn’t the same. She had got what she wanted; I had got what I had beendetermined to avoid. What bothered me most was that she didn’t seem capable ofaffection. She enjoyed the sex with a physical abandon I haven’t seen veryoften—proving again that promiscuous women are not necessarily frigid. But inbetween, she wanted to talk about her problems, about men, about psychology,about my lecture. . . . We had to talk in whispers, so as not to disturb thepeople in the next rooms.On the train to Palo Alto the next morning, I cursed myself for not bringing myjournal notebook, for I suddenly saw that I had important material. I hadn’twanted to go to bed with Helga because I knew in advance that it would leavenothing behind. Then why do I get such physical pleasure from Diana, althoughI’ve been married to her for seven years? For years now, I’ve been trying todefine the basis of the sexual impulse. Why should a man want to thrust hiserect penis into a woman? There must be a reason; to say it’s an instinct is noanswer. When Mopsy was a baby, I used to wonder why she sucked her thumb andheld her ear with the other hand; then I noticed other babies doing it. I wonderif this is connected with breast feeding—whether a baby automatically reachesout for the other nipple as it sucks, and treats its ear as a nipple? Thereought to be an analogous answer to the sexual impulse.Helga told me a strange story. When she first went to college, she was a veryrepressed young lady from the middle west who held strong views on sex beforemarriage, especially as her mother had told her that a husband can always tellif his wife is not a virgin, and would probably desert her on the spot. For sixmonths or so, she went out with various boys, permitted a little petting, butstopped them short if they tried to remove her pants. At the beginning of herjunior year, she moved in with another girl, who told her that she had solvedthe problem by means of an artificial vagina. This object fitted around theloins by means of a belt; it was little more than a kind of rubber tube that layon the pubis, and the opening slit had to be moistened with olive oil. Helgasaid she didn’t think it would work; her boyfriend had already told her he wouldbreak with her if she didn’t come across. But she tried it, borrowing herfriend’s artifice. To her surprise, the boyfriend didn’t mind in the least. Theyslept together in motels at weekends; she insisted on wearing panties, in casethe boy got carried away. But she said he didn’t even try to perform normalintercourse; he brought on her climax by caressing her after he’d had his own.She subsequently used the same thing with two more boyfriends, believing thatshe was being marvellously virtuous, until one night she got carried away andasked the boyfriend to make love normally.I remembered that Diana had told me the same sort of thing about her earliestsexual experiences. She once quarrelled with her boyfriend, and went to bed witha man she’d met only that afternoon, to spite him. Before they even went to hisroom, she explained that she was a virgin and wanted to remain one. He agreedimmediately, and they spent the night petting without actual intercourse.Now I suddenly saw that this is an important clue. Of course he hadn’t demurred.There was Diana, a pretty, middle-class girl with a slim figure and demuremanners. He wants to know her. She is like something in a museum case with thelabel ‘Do not touch’. There is a story in Maupassant of a criminal on the runwho poses as a lady’s maid, and helps a beautiful woman to dress and undress formonths. This is how a man wants to know a woman who sits opposite him on theUnderground, or stands at the perfume counter in an expensive store. The actualpene­tration of her vagina is the least important part of it; merely the finalsymbol of surrender. He can look at her and think: ‘I’ve had her.’ But he hashad her almost as completely once he has spent a night in her room, watched hertake off her clothes, let his hands wander all over her body and felt hers onhis, watched her dressing and combing her hair, seen the way she appliescosmetics, the kind of toothpaste she uses. The hunger of the male for thefemale is the hunger for her female-ness, her alien femininity, for everythingabout her.Again, I was always fascinated by Kleist’s story of the Marquise Von O——, inwhich Russian soldiers invade a town and drag off the young countess to rapeher. She is rescued by a Russian officer, and faints from her ordeal. A fewmonths later, to her amazement, she discovers that she is pregnant, and is socertain of her innocence that she puts an advertisement into the news­papersasking the father to come forward. Eventually, the father does so—it is theyoung officer who rescued her. Kleist had the sense to make the story endhappily; most of the romantics would have had her committing suicide out ofshame and the officer becoming a monk out of remorse. Goethe apparently saidharsh things about Kleist’s story, declaring that it was too absurd to be trueto life. Which demonstrates that Kleist knew more about human nature thanGoethe—or at least, about sex. There is no need to postulate that the officer isa rake. He rescues her in the spirit of a knight of the round table. When shefaints, he places her tenderly on a divan. She lies as still as if asleep; hefeels curiosity about what her lower half would look like unclothed, for heknows he has only to raise her skirt to her waist to see her naked—these werethe days before pants. He does it cautiously, afraid she will wake up, slips hishand between the thighs to open the legs. And then it doesn’t matter if shewakes; suddenly all that matters is to get his tight trousers off and bringtheir nakedness into contact. He does it and finds her easy to enter; he has anorgasm immediately. Ashamed, he withdraws, expect­ing to see her stirring; butshe lies still. He adjusts her clothes, then his own (he would do it in thatorder); then he goes away for water. When he returns, she is sitting up, andregards him with gratitude. This is the moment; will she know that a strangerhas visited her darkest recess? But she is so bruised and shaken that shenotices nothing . . . Yes, Kleist understood that raging male curiosity thatthirsts for knowledge of the female as dry ground thirsts for water. Goethe musthave understood something of it too. What else was it that made Faust seduceMargaret? She is an ordinary peasant girl, not particularly bright, and if hewas her doctor, he would simply feel paternal about her. But she is alien,strange; he is not even sure what a peasant girl wears under her Sunday frock;he badly wants to know.Which explained my relative indifference to Helga the morn­ing after. She hadalready laid herself bare to me; her defeat, her laziness, her longing forattention and reassurance. There was only one more thing to find out: was shewearing tights or pants? That first time of entering her was natural sex, thekind of sex that animals must have when they couple. After that, our minds wereback to dilute it. . . .She has written to me twice since then: the first time to describe herinvolvement with a middle-aged company director, the second to announce herengagement to a student at San Francisco State. I hadn’t replied to her secondletter when I heard of her death.And the news of her death brought a shock of reality. I realised that thefatigue of this lecture tour is false. It is the result of the same lack ofcontact with reality that led to her suicide. The last time I saw her—I left SanFrancisco on the night plane the same day—was at Jim Smyth’s apartment. He hadput a record on his gramophone and lowered the needle on to it. Nothinghappened—silence. He checked the loudspeakers by putting his ear against them,and peered at the needle to see if it was coated with fluff. He lowered thepick-up arm again. Nothing. Then I noticed that the arm was lowered by apneumatic device designed to prevent scratching, and I suggested that it wasn’tlowering the needle completely on to the record. He got down on all fours andpeered at it; no, he said, the needle was touching the record all right.Nevertheless, he made some adjustment to the pneumatic device; immediately, theroom filled with music. It had lowered the needle to within a hundredth of aninch of the record—so close that the gap could not be seen with the naked eye.Yet the gap was enough to make the difference between silence and music.What fascinates me is the gap between the mind and reality. Extreme boredomwidens the gap; so does fatigue. But the gap can be so slight that to allintents and purposes we are in contact with reality. Then a sudden shock fillsthe inner-being with music, and you know that there was no contact. You weredeceived. You were in your private vacuum, slowly suffocating to death. Later—en route New YorkI owe a debt of gratitude to Helga: her death has snapped me out of the state ofwill-lessness I was letting myself drift into. Human beings are like car tyres;to get the best results, you need to keep them inflated. If your tyre is flat,and you drive it a couple of miles, you’ve destroyed it. The same when the willis flat. I’ve been allowing my will to get steadily flatter over the past weekor so, and wondering why I get so exhausted.De Sade argues that all men are sadists, because even the most virtuous get acertain odd satisfaction from contemplating the misfortunes of others. He’sright, but it’s nothing to do with sadism. For some strange reason, boredommakes us lose all sense of reality. You might think, for example, that a man whohas been rescued from a tent at the South Pole would be incapable of boredom forthe rest of his life, because every time he began to take things for granted,he’d simply recall how close he’d been to death, and see his presentcircumstances as entirely delightful, no matter how dull they are. In fact, sucha man would be as easily bored as a man who has spent his whole life working onthe same farm; perhaps more so. The misfortune of others some­times awakens usfrom our strange sleep.I am fascinated by this flaw in human nature—implied by the existence ofboredom. Eradicate it, and you would have the superman. Saturday, April 12, Great Neck, Long IslandFatigue makes good resolutions difficult to keep. I arrived at Kennedy late lastnight, and was met by Howard Fleisher—small, Italianate, full of bounce andenthusiasm, who drove me out to this place—fine house on a cliff-top, which hesays he bought from the widow of a famous Mafioso who was killed by MurderIncorporated. Fleisher is one of these people whose manner implies that you’vegot to like him, because you and he have so much in common. . . . I keptexpecting him to put one arm round my shoulders and call me ‘kid’. He’sobviously in a great many businesses besides publishing—in fact, I suspectLinden Press is a sideline acquired for tax purposes. As we drove back, he toldme solemnly that he knew immediately that the Sex Diary wasn’t straightpornography, that I’m a sincere person with ideas I want to express . . . Icringed. We got back to his place at 11.30, and the door was opened by astrikingly beautiful negress whom he introduced as his secretary. There was alsoa younger girl, Beverley, who seemed dowdy by comparison; she shares a flat withSarah (the secretary) and is studying at secre­tarial school. The girls had laidon an excellent cold supper, including crab and lobster. By the time I’d eaten,and drunk two beers, I was feeling less hostile to my host, but so tired I couldhardly keep my eyes open. But Howard (he insisted on Christian namesimmediately) actually got bouncier and more enthusiastic after midnight. Hetalked about the new freedom in literature, the revolt on the campuses, and saidthere was a new generation to cater for, a generation hungering for ideas, forfreedom of expression, for straight, honest talking. I tried to find out what hemeant by ideas and freedom of expression, but as far as I could discover, hemeant freedom to express aggressive impulses without restraint and uninhibitedpornography.He described the play he means to finance in an off-Broadway production. A younggirl brings home a drunken football player after a college game, and he forcesher on the bed and rapes her. The rape is supposed to go on throughout the play,and this is symbolised by projecting her face, as she lies on her back, on to ascreen at the back of the stage. She imagines all the men she would havepreferred to take her virginity, beginning with her father, and the play is aseries of fantasy scenes in which she becomes increasingly abandoned. As eachseduction scene comes to an end, the face on the screen convulses with ecstasy.Each scene begins with the seducer as he is in real life—polite, re­pressed,etc—and then her imagination transforms the situation until it ends in bed. Atthe end of the play, the football player staggers off her, gasping, and says:‘Sorry, I just can’t go on’, and she gets up, smooths down her underskirt, andsays: ‘Weak­ling.’The two girls thought it a marvellous plot, and I had to pre­tend to beenthusiastic too. Finally, at about 3 a.m., he showed me to my room and, as heleft, winked and pointed to the room next door. ‘Beverley’s in there, if youwant her.’ I muttered something about it being very kind of him, and fell into acoma­tose slumber. Just before I fell asleep I remembered that I’d forgotten tocall Diana in New Haven.This morning, Beverley woke me up at about nine with break­fast, and asked me ifI slept well. I thought I caught a satirical inflection, and wondered if she’sas demure as she looks. I was feeling depressed. Listening to Howard for threehours last night had got me into a state where all I wanted to do was get out. Iwanted to shout: ‘Let me alone. I hate every damn thing you stand for.’ I don’tthink he’d have been offended. He’d have said: ‘No you don’t. You only think youdo. . . .’, and talked faster than ever.He came in while I was eating my breakfast—an English breakfast of eggs, baconand marmalade—and handed me the manuscript of Donelly’s book. It was only aboutsixty typescript pages long. I asked what had happened to the rest, and he said:‘Yes. Well . . . er . . . that’s the problem.’ After another half-hour ofvoluble explanations and assurances that he always stands by his friends, Ibegan to gather what I should have realised last night. He’s jealous of GrovePress for publishing de Sade and My Secret Life before anyone else thought ofit. But he doesn’t see why he shouldn’t go one better and produce every volumementioned in Ashbee’s Bibliography of Prohibited Books. He is starting with atranslation of the confessions of Brother Achazius of Düren, a Capuchin monk whoran a society in which he flagellated and screwed his female followers. Howardlent me the typescript—it was definitely one of those ‘books you read with onehand’. He has also commissioned a book called Scandalous Priests, although hedid not explain where he got the material.Finally, we got to the point. He will pay me $5,000 to do research aroundMoycullen and Ballycahane (Donelly’s birth­place), which will cover the cost ofan Introduction. If I can produce more ‘material’ for the book itself—i.e. if Ican unearth more manuscript by Donelly, or forge it myself—he will pay me afurther $10,000. He obviously doesn’t really mind whether I find more of Donellyor write it myself. He points out that Alex Trocchi wrote most of the fifthvolume of Frank Harris’s My Life and Loves, and has since published it under hisown name. The main thing is that I should be prepared to take the blame, if anyarises.The prospect of that much money is tempting. We shall be lucky if we have $500left of the money I’ve made on this tour. I told Fleisher I’d think about it,and he left me with the type­script.I spent the rest of the morning in bed, getting increasingly depressed as I readDonelly. I don’t understand how he managed to keep the friendship of people likeSheridan and Rousseau. He seems to be just a dirty-minded ruffian. Worse still,I suspect he is simply a liar. The women he seduces—starting with his sister andthe maidservant—all sound like versions of the same wish-fulfilment fantasy.They all begin by resisting virtuously and say­ing: ‘Fie, for shame.’ Then, whenhe gets his finger into the ‘coral slit’, they gasp, and their thighs ‘part asif involuntarily’. From then on, it’s straightforward progress until they moanwith ecstasy in bed. Either Fleisher is a bigger fool than he looks, or he knowsdamn well he’s been swindled and doesn’t care.He came in and told me we were expecting guests to lunch. This was about thelast straw—I felt anything but sociable. I went into the bathroom, and turned onthe shower. Suddenly, I felt dizzy, and had to cling on to the curtain rail. Isat down on the lavatory seat and stared at the flowered bath-mat, feeling thewaves of depression trickling over me. I thought of Helga—that last morning, asshe had sat on the edge of the bed, pulling on her stockings. She said: ‘I’mglad we slept together. We may as well take what pleasure we can get.’ She saidno more, but I understood her. She meant that life is meaningless. We hadclimbed into bed together, fucked like two animals, slept and got up again; butwe were strangers, too honest to have illusions about love ortenderness—alienated from one another and the universe. And suddenly I wanted toexplain to her. I wanted to tell her that the world seems meaningless becauseher subconscious has gone to sleep. When we’re happy, bubbles of pleasure keeprising up from the subconscious—memories, smells, places. When you’re exhausted,the subconscious goes off duty, and the result is the state Sartre calls‘nausea’. You see things without the penumbra of meaning supplied by the lowerdepths of the mind. St Augustine says: ‘What is time? When I do not ask myselfthe question, I know the answer.’ Quite. Isolating a thing in consciousness robsit of its meaning. The fact that con­sciousness sees the world as meaningless isneither here nor there. Consciousness isn’t supposed to perceive meaning; it’ssupposed to perceive objects. But how could I explain this to a girl who isfirmly jammed in a state of total nervous exhaustion? To get her out of it, shewould have to be persuaded to make an effort. And she won’t make an effortbecause she says all effort is point­less. She’s trapped in a vicious circle.I was determined that I wouldn’t make the same mistake. I snapped myself out ofit, stepped into the hot shower, and thought about seeing Diana tomorrow andflying home in ten days’ time. . . .But lunch was as bad as I’d thought it would be. The guests were obviously richneighbours, and Fleisher had invited them solely because they were richneighbours. It came to me how much of this kind of thing goes on inAmerica—people drinking and talking together when they have nothing incommon—and I plunged back into a state of irritable depression. I felt thatFleisher had no right to inflict these damn bores on me—fat businessmen andtheir silly wives, and their chatter about the holiday villa they’ve just boughtin Florida or on the Carmel peninsula. Beverley was on the far side of the roomwith a fat young executive type whose wife was away for the weekend, and thisirritated me more than ever because I felt she was there to entertain me—even ifI didn’t want to sleep with her. I wanted it to be my choice.I went out on to the terrace, by the heated swimming pool, and looked across thesound to Connecticut. The air was warm and mild. Suddenly I decided I’d tellFleisher I didn’t want anything to do with his damn book. I couldn’t evenundertake the Introduction without dishonesty, because Donelly struck me as avicious bore. I’d leave right after lunch and catch the after­noon bus to NewHaven. . . .I was just about to go in and tell Fleisher when Beverley came out bringing me aplate of smoked salmon and a beer. She said: ‘You look bored.’ And I said—ratherangrily, as if I blamed her—‘I am. I’m sick of this whole bloody thing.’ I saidI intended to leave immediately after lunch. Her concern surprised me. She said:‘No, you don’t have to do that. Wait until after the others have gone.’ Herattention flattered me, and I promised. Five minutes later, Howard came out andasked me how I felt. I said I was fine but that I was thinking of leaving laterin the day. He also got very concerned, and hurried off into the house.I ate the salmon and some cold meat, and went up to my room. I was sitting onthe bed reading the Donelly typescript when Beverley came in. She looked veryunsure of herself. ‘I’ve brought you some cranberry pie.’ I said thank you, andshe sat on the bed. She said: ‘Howard says I’m to persuade you not to go.’‘Why?’ She hesitated, then said: ‘It means a lot to me. I want you to stay.’ Isaid ‘Why?’, more surprised than ever. She rambled on vaguely about only havinganother year of study before she could take a well-paid job, and it graduallydawned on me that Fleisher was paying for her studies, and that, in return, shewas expected to ‘entertain’ guests like myself. I suppose it all fitted in.Sarah was Fleisher’s secretary and his mistress; Beverley shared a flat withSarah. . . . Then I gathered that Fleisher had been angry with her for notspending the night with me. I said: ‘But didn’t you explain that I was fastasleep?’ She said: ‘Yes, I know you were. I came in to see.’I was eating my cranberries—although I didn’t want them—out of embarrassment. Itwas one of those awkward, stupid situations. I couldn’t say: ‘All right, takeoff your clothes, and we’ll make up for lost time.’ I said: ‘But I explained toHoward that my wife and daughter are waiting for me in New Haven.’ She saidmiserably: ‘Yes, I know.’ I said: ‘But what difference does it make whether Ispent the night with you or not?’ But in fact, I could guess. Fleisher was oneof those men who are determined to have their own way. He had read my book anddecided that I was the person he needed to supply his Donelly book with arespectable image. And if I’d spent the weekend in his house, with a girl he’dimported for me, then I’d be under some sort of obligation to him.I said: ‘Look, I don’t think I can accept this commission. This book is just astupid piece of pornography. It’s not even well-written pornography. It doesn’tconvince.’ I read her the scene where he gets into bed with his sister when sheis men­struating, and she allows him to take her virginity. ‘An Irish girl inthe 1780s wouldn’t even have allowed her brother to know she was menstruating.’I found nevertheless that reading it aloud produced a stirring of the loins thatmade walking uncomfort­able, so I sat down on the window-sill—a deep one. Sheobjected that manners were more free in the eighteenth century, and that perhapsDonelly was simply a careless writer who left out import­ant steps in theseduction. I said: ‘All right. How about this, then.’ I turned to the scenewhere he describes seducing his sister’s schoolfriend. Beverley moved to myshoulder, and let her breast press against it. The scene describes how she isstanding with him, watching a parade go past; he unlaces her bodice and sucksher nipples, then inserts his finger in the ‘coral slit’. They end by havingintercourse with her sitting down on him, her legs astride his. I said I thoughtit was preposterous, but I was aware that my voice sounded strained. Thecombination of the pornography, and her breast leaning hard against my shoulder,had me in a state of tension that would have been obvious if I hadn’t beenholding the typescript in my lap. She was wearing an off-the-shoulder blouse offluffy pink wool that went well with her golden skin. As I finished reading, shewet her right index finger, reached around my head, and placed it gently in myear. I don’t know where she learned the trick, but the effect was shattering.Suddenly, this was her situation, and she knew it; the awkwardness had gone. Ireached up and pulled the blouse right off the shoulders, then pulled down thecups of her bras­sière, a small thing that was little more than a band of lacymaterial. Both her nipples were erect and very pink; I took them in my mouth inturn, and worried them with my tongue. She slid on to my knee, pushed themanuscript on to the floor, and unzipped my trousers. We sat there in thatposition, both breath­ing very heavily. I wondered whether she wanted to moveover to the bed, but her fingers caressed with a sort of skill that made me wantto sit quite still, letting her go on. I could see past her shoulder, out of thewindow, the black outlines of trees against the sea, their branches only justcovered with green shoots. They looked magnificently hard, as if they were madeof some black and silver metal. Then my climax came, and the trees lurched, andsomething inside me went very hard, so that everything I looked at was hard,hard and very beautiful, beautiful as only the hard and clean can be. She bentover me, and inserted her tongue in my mouth, holding it there until I graduallysubsided in her hand. I gave her my handkerchief, and she wiped her fingers. Shepulled my hand, and we moved to the bed, and simply lay there, fully clothed. Iwas beginning to fall asleep when some slight sound made me look up. In themirror, I saw the reflection of the door opening. Fleisher peeped in, saw us,and instantly withdrew again. Beverley was asleep, her lips open. I suddenlyfelt pity, and an upsurge of a feeling that was basically love. Fleisher hadtold her to come and give herself. She had done her best; she had set out togive me pleasure without think­ing about her own, and my handkerchief held theresult. I kissed her parted lips; then, when she stirred, her forehead.When I got downstairs, I told Fleisher that I wanted to leave immediately, butthat I would accept his contract. He said: ‘Sure, man, that’s ma boy’, andpunched me on the shoulder. LaterI began the last entry at Great Neck and finished it in the bus station atKennedy. Now, travelling back to New Haven, I recall that Bergson stumbled uponthe answer to Helga’s sense of meaninglessness. In one of his essays, hedescribed how a stage magician (Houdin, I think) trained his five-year-old sonto in­stantaneous observation. The boy was shown a domino, but not allowed tocount the dots. Later, he was asked to recall how many dots there were; i.e. hehad to count them ‘in imagina­tion’. Then he was shown two dominoes, and toldnot to count the dots; again, he had to ‘imagine’ them when they had been takenaway and recall how many dots there were. He was being trained to take visualphotographs with his memory. Later, he was taken past toyshop windows, allowedto glance in for a second, then asked to write down all he could remember.Within a short time, he could write down forty or fifty items from memory.Houdin was training the boy to pretend he possessed second sight. The boy wouldgo on stage, and glance at the audience for a minute or so while his fatherintroduced him. In that time, he would ‘photograph’ all the visibleobjects—watch-chains, etc. Then he would be blindfolded, and some signal fromhis father would enable him to identify the object roughly. He would, of course,hear the voice of the man who handed it over and be able to judge where he wassitting.Bergson points out that the essence of this method was not allowing the boy tocount the dots. Instead of interpreting what he saw, as we all do in everydayperception, he was asked merely to let the upper level of his mind photographit. The upper level became dissociated from his feelings, intuitions,judgements, etc, and could move much quicker; it was ‘travelling light’.Clever young people soon learn this trick—particularly if they are cramming forexams. They learn to dissociate the levels of the mind. But observe what thismeans. You teach yourself to photograph ‘facts’ without their meaning. If I wasasked to memorise the contents of a toyshop window, I should say: ‘That’s a fireengine in the middle, and a doll in that corner, and a teddy bear in that one. .. .’, and I wouldn’t memorise more than two or three objects in several seconds.This easily becomes a habit: grasping things without their meaning. It becomesdifficult to re-connect your upper levels with your instincts and feelings. Thehorse refuses to be har­nessed to the cart, as it were. You go around merely‘seeing’ things without their meanings. And you say: ‘The world is meaningless.’ Monday, April 14, Charleston, S.C.A Sunday with Diana and Mopsy has me feeling more sane. I spent yesterday toyingwith the idea of scrapping the Donelly fragment and writing Fleisher a completebook of Donelly memoirs. But this morning, just before I left New Haven,Fleisher rang me. He had just remembered that I was going to Baton Rouge, and hewanted to tell me that a descendant of Donelly’s—Colonel Monroe Donelly—isliving at a place called Denham Springs. I shall be there for thirty-six hours,and try to call on him.I keep thinking about Beverley. Not just about her, but about what happened tothe trees as I stared at them. I keep trying to put it into words. Just as, whenyou’re feeling miserable, every­thing you look at seems tinged with yourmisery—becomes a kind of symbol of your misery, like grey skies or fallingautumn leaves—so in the moment when the orgasm convulses the whole body,everything becomes a symbol of the sense of power. This explains why I detestDonelly. His insipid little orgasms led nowhere; he never tried to pursue themto their source in himself. [Entries for the following week are omitted] Monday, April 21What has happened over the past twenty-four hours is so amazing that I mustdescribe it in detail.On Saturday morning, and again on Saturday evening, I lectured at LouisianaState University—good lectures, in spite of this blanket of tiredness that Ican’t shake off. (But I don’t much enjoy lecturing. I keep remembering thatcomment of the Marquis of Halifax: ‘The vanity of teaching doth often tempt aman to forget that he is a blockhead.’) Early Sunday morning, I ate breakfast atthe motel, and hired a taxi to take me out to Denham Springs, some ten milesaway. (Fleisher offered to pay all such expenses.) I purposely hired the taxifrom Denham Springs. It was driven by a middle-aged negro. I asked him if heknew where Colonel Donelly lived. Oh yeah, he said, he knew the Colonel allright. He lived a mile outside town. He asked me if I was a friend of theColonel’s, and I said I’d never met him, but was hoping to find him at home. Hesaid: ‘Well, maybe he’ll see you and maybe he won’t. With the Colonel, you cannever tell what he’ll do.’ He proved to be as talkative as most American taxidrivers, and in twenty minutes he’d told me a great deal about Donelly. Therewasn’t much that I liked. He moved to Louisiana from Mexico shortly after thewar, and bought land outside the town. He got it cheaply because it was swampyand full of snakes. He hired heavy equipment and had the land drained andcleared; then began to farm, growing rice, sugar and oranges. He paid well, buthe became known as a man who drove himself and his hired labour. Thehands—mostly negroes—lived in wooden barrack-like buildings. Donelly was acomplete tyrant, although he had a reputation for fanatical fair­ness. Hesettled disputes himself, and even ordered whippings, which he occasionallycarried out himself. Anyone who wished to leave could do so. He lived alone, andwas never known to sleep with a woman. His only servant was a huge, moroseMexican he brought with him. There were rumours that he beat the man—the soundof blows and curses was sometimes heard from inside the farm building—but theservant never complained. He died of typhoid a few years later.In 1962, the Standard Oil Company—which has a big refinery at BatonRouge—discovered oil on his land and offered him a large price for it. Donellyfinally rented part of the land to them. And although he had plenty of farmingland left, he gave up farming, dismissed his labourers, and lived a hermitexistence. He had been living alone ever since, growing thinner and moretaciturn. Several times a year he vanished—it was believed he went to NewOrleans. A resident of Denham Springs claimed to have seen him in a brothelthere, but it was not widely believed.We were within a few miles of Denham Springs, and the driver advised me to rollup my window. He explained we were about to pass a chicken factory that hadrecently burned down, and the bodies of the dead birds had not yet been removed.We passed the place on the right—little more than a large wooden shed, as far asI could judge from the burnt remains. Even with the windows closed, thesickening smell came in. The driver told me they had many fires in the area. Thelabourers’ quarters on Donelly’s farm had been burnt down, as had a barn full ofhay.This didn’t surprise me. The only thing that surprises me about the south partof America is that the whole thing doesn’t burst into flame in midsummer.Although it was not yet eleven in the morning, the air was like a furnace.We drove through the sleepy little town, where everything looked very empty andquiet on a Sunday morning, then turned to the right, down a steep, narrow trackthat wound below the town. Half an hour’s cautious driving—to conserve thesprings of the taxi—brought us to straggling wooden farm buildings that lookeddeserted. I paid him and got out. He said: ‘I’d better jus’ wait ’n’ see if he’sgonna let you in. He might just decide he’s not.’ So I crossed the dusty yard,past rusting farm equip­ment, towards the main building. A mangy yellow-coloureddog growled at me, but made no attempt to get up.Before I reached the door it opened, and Donelly stood there. I knew it must beDonelly—he looked too European to be any­body else; the kind of man one used tosee on old advertisements for Planter’s Tea and Camp Coffee: thin, sunburned,with a face in which all the muscles showed through. He watched me approachwithout speaking, then said: ‘You’re Mr Somme?’ It was a relief. I expected himto say: ‘Who the hell are you?’ I said I was. He nodded, very briefly, and heldopen the door for me to go in.The room was bare and tidy, like an officer’s billet. Donelly hadn’t smiled orshaken hands. But I turned as he came in the door—he stood there to watch thetaxi drive away—and thought he was watching me with an oddexpression—speculative, like a cat watching a hedgehog. He said: ‘Can I offeryou tea?’, and I said yes with enthusiasm. He went out, and left me alone. Itwas clear he lived in this one room. There was a camp bed, an uncomfortablearmchair and an ordinary wooden chair, and a small folding table. The floor wasbare and clean. There was an old green safe in the corner of the room. Half adozen prints on the wall—of bare-fist boxers squaring up to one another, andfine horses. No books.Donelly came back with the tea, and a plate of buttered cream crackers. I gotthe feeling that he wanted to unbend, to say something friendly, and hadforgotten how. As he poured the tea he asked me if I’d had a good trip. I saidyes. I resisted the temptation to talk to try to fill the silence. As I sippedmy tea—which was well made—I recalled Heine’s definition of silence as theconversation of Englishmen, and found it hard not to smile. Finally, I stoppedtrying. Donelly looked at me at that moment, and I turned my smile into afriendly grin, and said: ‘Well, it’s really a pleasure to find an Englishmanliving in this weird spot.’ He said stiffly: ‘I’m Irish.’ ‘Same thing at thisdistance’, I said, wondering if he’d throw something at me. But he gave a kindof frozen smile and said: ‘Yes, I suppose so.’ For some curious reason, the icewas broken. He said: ‘So you live in Moycullen? Where abouts?’, and I describedthe cottage we’d rented, and the house we’d moved into. Then he asked me if Iknew any­thing of the Domenech murder case—the girl who was found at the bottomof the cliffs of Moher two years ago. I knew all about it, and described it indetail. She was an American girl whose lover killed her for her traveller’scheques. I knew the fisherman who found the body, and the member of the localgardai who was called to view it. The face was apparently unrecognisable, butthe murderer had made the mistake of leaving one item of clothing on the body—apair of black lace panties. These con­tained the name tag of an Americanmanufacturer, and even­tually led to her identification. I had also spoken tothe detective inspector from Dublin who took charge of the case, and he told mesomething of the methods he used. All this first-hand infor­mation fascinatedDonelly, and I began to hope he might feel co-operative on the subject of hisancestor.Towards midday, the heat was becoming oppressive. Donelly removed his pullover,and sat at the table wearing only a shirt—open to the waist—and his trousers. Ialso removed my jacket. He suggested that we might have a drink, and I agreed.Donelly produced a bottle of black rum. I knew I had no more lecturing untilTuesday, so I accepted without misgiving. Donelly pro­duced more butteredcrackers, and opened tins of sardines. After we had said ‘Cheers’, he brought upthe subject of Esmond Donelly. He said:‘I suppose this publisher chap told you I told him to go to hell?’‘No, he didn’t.’ That was typical of Fleisher—suggest I call on Donelly withoutexplaining that he’d already met a hostile reception. Perhaps it was just aswell; I wouldn’t have called if he had.He asked: ‘Have you seen this manuscript?’‘Yes. I’ve got it with me.’ I took it from the inside pocket of my jacket. Hetook it eagerly. After reading half a page, he threw it down on the table with agesture of disgust.‘Just as I thought. A forgery. Just a stupid bloody forgery.’‘Are you sure?’ I was astounded.‘Of course I’m sure. Haven’t you read Esmond’s Diary?’‘I’m afraid I haven’t. I didn’t even know it existed. Is it published?’‘Of course it is. Published in Dublin in 1817.’He went out of the room. A few minutes later he returned and tossed a smallleather-bound volume on the bed. The title was The Diary of Esmond Donelly,Gent. It was published by Telford’s, Dublin. The Epistle Dedicatory wasaddressed to Lord Chesterfield:‘My Lord, I have often had cause to remember your saying that the worst bred manin Europe, if a lady let fall her fan, would certainly take it up and give it toher; the best bred man in Europe could do no more. It was this reflection uponthe similarity of talents of the great and humble within limited spheres ofactivity that hath nerved me to offer this unpretend­ing volume to yourLordship. . . .’There was no need to read further. The man who could write this graceful,well-turned prose could not be the gloating moron who wrote: ‘Within seconds mylucky doodle was in her virgin niche, my sperm sticking my balls to her arse.’This last quotation catches the essence of the style of Fleisher’s manuscript. Iwould not argue that the same man could not have written the Epistle Dedicatoryto Chesterfield and the above sentence; but an in­tuition that amounted to acertainty made me feel that it was not so. I said:‘I see what you mean. You don’t think it’s possible that the style of a privatejournal might differ from that of a travel diary?’‘It differs from his unpublished diaries too.’‘Have you seen them, then?’ I tried not to sound too eager.‘Oh yes.’ He said it casually, and poured himself more rum. I wolfed half adozen sardines and a buttered biscuit before drinking more, and reflected that Icould spend the afternoon and evening asleep in my motel room.I then told Donelly about my meeting with Fleisher, explain­ing that I had neverheard of his ancestor before this time. He agreed that that was not surprising.Donelly’s journal had no more merit than a dozen others of the period, ThomasTurner, Mary Cowper, the Earl of Egmont; and was simply not in the same class asFanny Burney. Esmond Donelly was known to students of Irish literature; but heis not even mentioned in the Cambridge History of English Literature.By way of extenuating Fleisher’s motives, I pointed out that there is seldomsmoke without fire, and that if there is a rumour that Donelly kept ‘sexdiaries’, it might well have some founda­tion. He stared at me with his coldeyes, his face expressionless, then said finally:‘Assuming it might have some foundation, do you suppose his descendants areeager to see such things published? You know Ireland.’I saw his point. The Irish are not precisely bigoted about matters of morals;they have a certain flexibility. But the southern Irish are Catholics; there ismuch banning of books, and the Index is still a matter to be reckoned with. Icould understand that the Donellys of Ballycahane might well find suddennotoriety embarrassing, even if profitable.Towards one o’clock, I was distinctly drunk, and I said I ought to leave. To mysurprise, he objected. ‘No, no. You can have food here. I’ll cook eggs andbacon. Or there’s sweet corn.’ He went off to the kitchen, and I read a fewpages of Esmond Donelly describing Venice. The heat was making me drowsy. Infact, I was almost asleep when Donelly woke me up as he brought in an enormoussaucepan that was full of corncobs. He poured half a dozen of these into a deepoval plate, stuck a huge slab of butter on them, and told me to eat. I havenever eaten so much sweet corn in my life; but it was superb. Donelly, to myastonishment, washed down his food with rum. I was impressed by the quantity hecould hold. Between us, we had emptied the best part of a bottle, and I had onlytaken two glasses. But I could see no sign that he was drunk; his speechremained slow and precise; the voice kept the acid, slightly sarcastic tone. Theonly change was in the subject matter of his conversation. He began to talkabout sex. He held up a corncob—from which he had chewed the seeds—and said thathe had heard of a book in which a girl’s virginity is taken with a corncob. Itold him it was Faulkner. Donelly said Faulkner had not invented the episode:that a corncob is a well-known expedient if a girl’s hymen proves too tough tobe penetrated by the more usual method. Then he went on to tell me an anecdoteof one of his negro farm workers who had found his daughter masturbating with acorncob. He described how the man had tied her hands to a hook on the wall andlashed her with a leather belt; then ended by inserting a far larger cob intothe girl by way of driving home the lesson. He told me this story coolly andreflectively, as he ate another corn­cob; but he did not look at me as hetalked. He went on to tell me more anecdotes—all involving floggings. He openedanother bottle of rum as he talked. Logic told me that this succession ofanecdotes about flogging and incest could not really spring from a disinteresteddesire to give me a picture of life in the deep south; but his manner certainlybetrayed no sadistic intention. It struck me that he had lived alone for a longtime; he was sex-starved and lonely, and enjoyed having a fellow-countryman totalk to. There was nothing very abnormal about that.But I began to wish that I’d timed my visit for later in the day. It began tolook as if he intended keeping me here all after­noon and evening. I couldleave, of course, but Donelly was my only source of information about hisancestor, and I had taken five thousand dollars to write about this man. Guiltalone would have kept me sitting there as long as I was welcome.As the afternoon wore on, I began to yawn every minute or so; but Donellyappeared not to notice. He had brought in a deck chair, and sat in this, withhis feet on the wooden chair. He insisted that I take the uncomfortablearmchair, and put my feet on the bed. We were now drinking beer—Budweiser fromthe tin—and he was smoking cheroots. Periodically, I tried to bring theconversation back to Donelly, but he evaded the sub­ject. Finally, at about fouro’clock, he asked me if I felt like a walk. I said all right—anything to breakthe hypnotic daze. I was beginning to feel rather irritable with him. He couldsee I was sleepy; he might at least have suggested that I doze for half an hour,or left me to read Esmond Donelly’s journal. But he wanted to talk, and heobviously didn’t care whether I was sleepy or not.In spite of the heat, Donelly put on a clean shirt and tie, and a sports jacket.I carried my own jacket slung over my shoulder. He looked as if he was on hisway to his London club for a midday drink; I felt crumpled, sweaty andwill-less. Aware by now that he was talking from some compulsion, I scarcelypaid attention to what he said, walking along beside him over the rutted fields.The great yellow hound followed us; its legs were so long that it seemed to bemoving in slow motion. Donelly walked with long strides, pointing out variousobjects of interest with his cane. ‘That’s known as the lynching tree. The Klanhanged three negroes there a few years back.’ ‘What had they been doing?’‘Setting fire to hayricks.’ Some of the areas of woodland we strolled throughwere pretty, but I was amazed by the quantity of rusty tins and Coca Colabottles lying in the undergrowth. We leaned on a fence to watch the oilderricks, and I suddenly noticed that Donelly was wearing a revolver in aholster underneath his jacket. ‘What’s that for?’ ‘In case of snakes’, he said.He evidently felt that the noise of the derricks interfered with conversation,for he hurried me on. I noticed that he kept glancing at his watch. ‘Are wegoing anywhere in par­ticular?’ I asked. The flow of talk stopped for a moment.‘No.’ He looked blank. I was beginning to feel thirsty, and his tension wascommunicating itself to me. ‘Where are we going?’ ‘Oh, I thought we’d juststroll along for a mile or so, then make our way home.’ The word ‘stroll’ was soinappropriate that I smiled. ‘I ought to think about getting back.’ He ignoredthe remark. But he consulted his watch again. The great yellow dog was growlingand barking at a clump of grass in a ditch. I peered down, and saw a black snakecoiled there, hissing. As it saw me, it slithered off. I expected Donelly toshoot at it, but he only said: ‘Come on.’We clambered over a fence and on to a dirt road. There were farm buildings a fewhundred yards away, and a mail box indi­cated that we were now on somebodyelse’s land.Donelly said suddenly:‘Hello, that looks like a fire.’‘Where?’He pointed across a field next to the farm, but all I could see was a faint wispof smoke rising from an open barn full of straw. But a few minutes later, flameswere shooting high into the air, and the black smoke billowed and twisted like amaterialising genie. Donelly was suddenly running, his gun banging against hisbuttock, and the great dog loping alongside like a small pony. We scrambled overa fence and crossed a field with pigs rooting in the black mud. Men were alsorunning from the direction of the farm buildings.I could see no point in running. There was obviously nothing we could do, andthe fire would certainly not burn itself out before we arrived. So I walkedacross the field, my hands in my pockets. Five minutes later, I joined Donelly.It was certainly an impressive blaze; the flames were so powerful they carriedup fragments of burning straw that slowly rained on us or drifted in grey wisps.It was impossible to approach closer than fifty yards; the heat was tremendous.Something exploded—a barrel perhaps—and a part of the roof fell in. Showers ofsparks rose like fireworks. I said something to Donelly, but he ignored me. Ilooked at his face, and looked away quickly. His jaw was set and rigid, and hiseyes were staring as if they were made of blue glass. It was as if he wasdrinking in the noise and smoke. Even when smoke blew towards us, and made myeyes water, he went on staring. His fists were clenched in his trouser pockets.There was something about the set of his face that made me realise that he wasexperiencing a weird exaltation. To some extent, I could understand it. The firewas majestic; there was something sym­phonic about the crackling and the heatand the shower of sparks.I felt that some of the other spectators were looking at us with a certainresentment, as if we had no right to be there; so I retired to the fence and saton it. Half an hour later, when nothing remained of the barn but the metaluprights, the fire engine arrived.Someone behind me said: ‘Mind tellin’ me your name?’, and I found a burlypoliceman looking at me with an expression of sour disapproval. Two men werestanding behind him, holding guns; they looked like farm labourers. I gave myname, and said that I was with Colonel Donelly. At this, the elder of the twomen said: ‘Oh, you’re with Donelly, are you?’, and I wondered why his tone wasso hostile. The cop frowned at him, then said to me: ‘Do you mind tellin’ me howlong you been here?’ ‘Since just after the fire started. We were taking a walk.’The questions puzzled me, but it seemed easier to answer. ‘Who are you?’ When Iexplained that I was lecturing at Baton Rouge, his tone became more civil. I hadthe lecture contract in my pocket, and an I.D. that I always carry in America. Iwas on the point of asking if it was against the law to stop and watch a fire,but it hardly seemed worth while. The cop examined my papers, said thank youpolitely, then strode over to Donelly, fol­lowed by the two men. The greatyellow dog stood by Donelly’s side, and as the men approached, it growled andstarted to crouch, as if for a spring. Donelly held its collar. Theconver­sation was brief; I saw him pointing towards me. Then he came across tome, yawned, and said: ‘Well, I think we may as well get back.’ The fire enginehad finally got water spraying on to the smouldering ashes, and clouds of steamcame up, carrying ash and fragments of charred wood.‘What was that all about?’‘Oh, they’re very suspicious of strangers in this area.’‘But they couldn’t have suspected us of starting the fire.’He shrugged, then began to whistle an Irish jig. He walked back with the samelong strides, but it struck me that he had ceased to be tense. During theearlier part of our walk, he had talked and walked like an automaton—or a manwith his mind rigidly fixed on something else. Now he was human, relaxed. As weentered the house, he even placed his hand on my shoulder and said: ‘Well, Ithink we both deserve a long cool drink.’He produced bottles of English ale—Worthingtons. As I watched him pouring, andhumming to himself, something silly came into my head. Exhaustion had given me afeeling of reck­lessness; I obeyed the impulse and said it.‘I don’t suppose you had anything to do with it, did you?’For a moment I wondered if I had gone too far. But he held out the beer with thehappy, innocent smile of a schoolboy.‘What an odd question. How could I?’And suddenly, with a certainty I cannot explain, I knew that he had. Perhaps itwas the way he said it, or the immediate way he had understood the question. Aninnocent man would have hesitated, wondered if he had understood me correctly. Isat in the armchair and drank deeply. When I looked at him again, the certaintyhad vanished. He had been with me all day. . . .‘Here’s to Esmond Donelly.’I drank. It seemed irrelevant.He went into the kitchen, and I heard sounds of food being prepared. He hadswitched on a radio—another sign of relaxa­tion. A cool breeze blew through theopen window. The more I thought about it, the more I was inclined to believethat he had some fore-knowledge of the fire. It all fitted in: the attempts topersuade me to stay; the obsessive, mechanical conversation; the absurdly longwalk on a hot afternoon; the gun he carried and the great dog; the increasedpace as we came close to the hay­stack and the glances at his watch. The man wasa pyromaniac. Probably he had set his own out-buildings on fire. Perhaps he hadfired the chicken factory too. Perhaps—I suddenly felt a cold shock—perhaps hehad caused the fire for which the negroes were lynched. But how had he done it?An accomplice who started the fire as we approached? Too dangerous, surely? Sometiming device? That must be the answer.I finished my ale and began to doze. I woke up when he brought in the food—yams,french fries and sausages. He poured more beer; I ate from a tray on my knee. Hewas obviously very hungry; I watched him furtively as we ate in silence. Hedidn’t look like a Count Dracula, guarding his terrible secret. He looked like atired, worn-out man of fifty who habitually drove himself too hard and could notbe bothered to eat proper meals. I knew it was my duty to mention my suspicionsto someone—perhaps to the head of the English department at the University ofLouisiana. But I knew I wouldn’t. He was my host. I could only hope he gotcaught soon.It was nearly nine o’clock when I finished eating. I said:‘You’ve been very kind, but I really ought to think about getting back. . . .’He was piling the dishes on a tray. He said casually:‘What, before you’ve seen the Donelly manuscript?’I was unable to believe I had heard correctly.‘Manuscript?’‘That’s what you came for, isn’t it?’‘Do you have some of his manuscript?’He nodded as he carried the tray out. When he came back, he took a key from hispocket, and opened the green safe in the corner. He said:‘These are not for publication, of course.’There was a wooden box in the top part of the safe and, on the lower shelf, anumber of buff envelopes. He took out one of these and handed it to me. Therewas a great wad of papers that had been sewn together with waxed twine. Thehandwriting was distinctive and idiosyncratic, but easy enough to read: Falmouth, March 6, 1787The glass is sinking; the west wind gently breathing upon the water, the smokesoftly descending into the room, and the sailors yawning dismally at the door ofevery ale house. Beckford has left me to go in search of his lady love on thehill; I remain here, lulled into a state of drowsy tranquillity, watching twoyoung girls, beautifully shaped, and dressed with a kind of provincial elegance,walking by the edge of the sea. Ah, these delicious, glorious creatures! Whowould question the assertion of Zozimus the Panopolitan that woman did notspring from the same root as man, but was created to people some other star, andallowed to stay in our male world as an afterthought! Are they not the suprememystery of creation, the visible presence of magic in this draffish and Boeotianworld?Godwin said the illustrious Bishop of Cambrai was of more worth than hischambermaid, but I would not ex­change ten bishops for the pretty minx whoshared my bed last night. The wench—whose name is Clara—served us at supperyester-eve, and Beckford, whose tastes lie not in that direction, said the girlhad a behind like a boy. I said I thought it too shapely for a lad, at least, tojudge by the little bosoms I could see when she bent over the table to pourmelted butter on my lobster. When she came close to me, I whispered that I wouldgive her a crown for a kiss, and she laughed and blushed. Until Beckford spokeof her, I had paid her but small attention; but now my notions had become fixedupon her, the little god of pleasing anguish entered my breast and made apincushion of my heart. Each time she came into the room I looked upon her as ifI had newly fallen in love; indeed, for a moment it would have seemed no greatprice to marry her for the sake of a closer investigation of her charms.Although I believe I have less of the feminine in me than Beckford, I own to thecon­suming curiosity of a Pandora, that is capable of dismissing all otherconsiderations. When she came close to me to refill my glass, I passed my armabout her and allowed my hand to rest upon her thigh, knowing that if sheobjected to this, we would get no further. But she stood quietly, like awell-trained horse; then the landlord came in with more negus, and I withdrew myhand. I had no further opportunity to caress her during the meal; but when Ileft the room, I slipped a guinea into her hand and whispered: ‘This is for you,my dear. There’s five more waiting if you’ll come to my room when everyone isabed.’ She said nothing, lowering her eyes, but took the money. Later, Beckfordtold me that he had discovered that she was married to a fisherman, and that Ihad probably wasted my money. I replied that money given to a pretty girl isnever wasted, if she be virtuous, for it must be regarded as a votive offeringto Aphrodite, who will acknowledge the compliment in her own good time.On this occasion, Beckford proved to be wrong, for the nymph slipped between mysheets at three in the morning, after I had given up all hope, and thereafterdenied me nothing. I asked her in a whisper what had become of her husband; shesaid he was out with the fishing fleet. She was wearing a coarse linen shift,which I soon had about her throat. I kissed her and called her many soft words,for I have never had patience with the fellows who rob a girl of her virtue andthen treat her as if the robbery hath deprived her of all right to considerationor tenderness. Added to which, I was aware that the girl was a gift of thefoam-born goddess, and deserved a part of the worship due to her donor. So Icaressed her ears with soft words and the tip of my tongue, and then allowed itseloquence to speak to her breasts, and even to the velvet walls of the templeitself. By this time, the stirrings of her buttocks betokened excitement,whereupon I transferred my tongue to its proper resting place in her own mouth,and entered her as softly as a man slipping into bed. We fucked quietly andgently, barely moving the mattress, until her knees gripped me suddenly, and shespent with a shudder that was like the silver explosion of a sky-rocket. I laythere within her for a long time, kissing her lips as if to make up for alifetime of ab­stention, hardly able to believe that this milk-white priestesswas the same Clara who poured the gravy on my roast beef and gave me a glimpseof nipples that looked newly formed. Although her buttocks were now still—thosebuttocks that were too round to be a boy’s—my steed quivered within her, as ifunable to believe itself in so delicious a stable. I resolved to lie thereunmoving and see how long I could hold the starry fluid; but she undid me byslipping her hand between our bodies and caressing my balls with herfinger­tips; the seed gushed, and the earth drank the rain. We continued thesport until daylight, when she left me. I lay there and meditated upon theargument I had with Beckford in the coach yesterday: that the Greek manner oflove is more spiritual and exalted than that known between men and women. In myoverflow of felicity I could have wished Beckford the company of Clara’sfish-spouse in his four poster; but could the mating have been other than hairyand lusty, as befits knights jousting with lances of flesh? Such a unionpartakes of the bemuscled bounty of the sun, not of the green water-magic ofArtemis. I read on, forgetting Donelly’s presence. His remark that this was not forpublication kept my excitement within bounds of restraint; but I had the feelingthat I’ve experienced at other crucial moments in my life—for example, when Imet Austin at the Diaghilev exhibition; almost a sense of repeating a scene youhave already rehearsed.Donelly was back at the rum bottle. I refused a glass, but accepted a Budweiser.When I reached the end of the section, I put the manuscript volume down.‘Are you quite sure you wouldn’t be willing to have this published?’‘I think so.’I said: ‘It rather makes nonsense of the whole project. I see now what you meanabout Fleisher’s version being a forgery. But I don’t see how I can recommendFleisher to publish his version. It would be absurd.’‘I agree.’‘Is there no chance of a compromise?’He lit a cheroot.‘The family would be most upset if the papers were pub­lished.’‘But you said you weren’t on good terms with the family.’‘Neither am I. That’s no reason for spiting them.’From a man who had just burned down someone’s haystack, this struck me as alittle over-scrupulous. I changed my line of approach and asked him how thepapers had come into his hands. He seemed to think about this for a moment.‘Yes, I suppose there’s no harm in telling you that. When Donelly visitedRousseau at Neuchâtel in 1765—Donelly was about seventeen at the time—hepresented him with an essay, written in French, refuting Hume and d’Alembert.This is men­tioned by John Morley in his Life of Rousseau. Donelly and Rousseaubecame friends, in spite of the age gap. But Rousseau was having a hard time ofit. The clergy in Neuchâtel were all preaching against him, and he was accusedof bewitching a man who’d died of colic. One morning, Donelly found that someonehad balanced a huge stone outside Rousseau’s door so that it would fall on himwhen he came out—it would certainly have killed him. Esmond removed the stone,and the next night he set up the booby trap outside the house of theblacksmith—who was a particular enemy of Jean-Jacques, and who was also the onlyman strong enough to lift the stone without help. It broke the blacksmith’s armand collar bone. But it didn’t help poor Rous­seau, who had to leave townanyway—the people got to the point of stoning him in the streets. Two yearslater, when Rousseau was staying in London as the guest of David Hume, Donellyasked him what had become of the manuscript, and Rousseau said he’d left itbehind in Paris, and would return it when he went back. He never did.‘Shortly after the war, I was staying at Lausanne and I was introduced to abookseller named Clouzot, who had a business in Neuchâtel. I told him the storyof Donelly’s manuscript and he said he might be able to help me. Six monthslater, he wrote and offered it to me for sale—at a fairly reasonable price, Imight add. I think he found it at the house of the man from whom Rousseau hadrented his house, in a trunk of odds and ends. He also found pages of a traveljournal by Donelly.‘A few years later, Clouzot wrote to ask me if I was still in­terested inDonelly manuscripts. He’d come across another in Geneva. I knew that Esmond hadrented a house in Geneva and spent most of the last twenty years of his lifethere. But he moved back to Ireland a year before he died in 1830, and took mostof his possessions. I’ve no idea how this particular manuscript got left behind,although I do have a rather interesting theory. Byron visited Esmond atGeneva—he’d met him through Sheridan. A few weeks later, Byron was writing toHobhouse from Pisa that he was reading a “most bawdily diverting manuscript byold Esmond.” I presume Esmond was Donelly—in which case, it’s possible thatByron borrowed the manuscript and forgot to return it.’I had to admire the lucid way Donelly told the story; well into his secondbottle of rum, he discoursed as soberly as a clergyman arguing abouttransubstantiation.The odd thing was that I was suddenly feeling indifferent about the wholebusiness. I rather resented Donelly having this much power over me. I hadalready decided to return Fleisher’s $5,000 and forget the whole thing. So Ididn’t give a damn whether Donelly could be persuaded to change his mind. And assoon as I decided that I didn’t care, I felt free and indifferent. I decidedthat, whatever happened, I would leave in half an hour and get back to themotel. I asked Donelly how he had become interested in his ancestor. He saidhe’d discovered the published travel diary in the family home in Ballycahane. Iasked him how much of his life he had spent there.‘Very little. We moved to Dublin when I was five, and to Malaya when I wasnine.’‘Did you ever think of keeping travel diaries?’ I asked the question withoutreal interest, to fill in time, as it were. The result was an incredible floodof self-revelation. He said heavily:‘I have never kept a diary because there are too many things I’d never dare torecord.’‘That didn’t deter Esmond.’He gave an odd, twisted smile.‘Esmond’s sex life was the kind he could write about. Mine isn’t.’I thought he was referring to the burning of the hayrick. I noddedsympathetically and said I understood. He said, with a kind of wearyself-mockery:‘I doubt whether you do. When I was eight, we had a gover­ness who spanked usand played with our penises.’‘We?’‘My brother Esmond and I. Esmond was a year my senior. This girl was a Scot fromGlasgow—one of those big, healthy wenches. We both adored her from the moment wesaw her. We followed her around like lap dogs. One day, we were chasing oneanother round a table with a porcelain bowl on it, and the bowl fell off andsmashed. Our parents were out, and we begged Bridget not to tell them. Sheagreed to hide the broken frag­ments, but said she’d have to punish us both. Wewere both delighted at the idea. She told us to go up to our room and get ourtrousers off. When she came up with the cane, we were both naked. She sat on thebed and made each of us bend over her knee, then gave us ten strokes each.’‘Did it excite you?’‘Not really—at least, the punishment didn’t. What excited me was being naked andpressing against her legs.’I won’t try to give the rest of the story in his own words, because he went intoall kinds of minor detail that wasn’t im­portant. What he said was that he andhis brother both agreed they enjoyed being punished by Bridget. The next timethey were alone in the house with her, they deliberately broke some­thing, andwent through the whole performance again. This was in 1928—the era of shortdresses. He was able to press his penis against her knee as she spanked him, andsaid that the sensation was so exquisite it almost made him faint. This time,she saw that he had an erection as he backed away, and reached down to touch it.Donelly’s parents had believed in never trying to force back the foreskin, sothe glans of his penis was hidden by it. The girl said this was unhealthy, andbegan gently pulling the skin back. He said that, from that moment on, he andhis brother thought of nothing but how they could persuade her to spank themagain. After a week or so, they no longer had to smash things to obtain theirspankings. As soon as they were alone in the house with the girl, they wouldpropose to play at schools. She was the schoolmarm. They would give the wronganswers or cheek the teacher; after a while, she would order them to their room.There they’d undress, and then they’d go through the whole charade, ending withher pushing back their foreskins ‘for medical reasons’. One night when theirparents were away, she allowed them to climb into her bed, and removed hernightdress. Donelly said this was oddly disappointing, even though she wentthrough the usual sex play. They needed this image of her fully dressed,inflicting just punishment, in order to feel excited.It came to an end when he was nine; they went to Malaya, where his father wasmanager of a tin mine. While they were away, they heard that Bridget hadmarried, and were plunged into despair; each had bet the other that he wouldmarry her when he grew up.Two years later, they had almost forgotten her. Then one day, their mother askedthem how they would like Bridget to come to take care of them again. Her husbandhad left her, and she wanted to get away from Scotland. She joined them whenthey were on holiday in London, and returned with them to Malaya. Donelly saidshe had become bigger and heavier, and that they both found her more attractivethan ever. As soon as they were left alone with her, his brother said: ‘Will youspank us if we’re naughty?’, and she said: ‘Of course.’ Donelly said they bothshuddered with delight.For the first few weeks after their return, nothing happened. They had nativeservants, and she was afraid of compromising herself. But the hot climate andlack of sexual outlet soon began to erode her caution. The natives wanderedaround almost naked; she claimed that her upbringing had been strictly religiousand that she found this shocking. The boys took pleasure in teasing her andsometimes pinching her, and she would slap them. They could tell from theincreased hardness of the smacks that they were an outlet for something elsebesides annoyance. She saw them naked after a bath one night, and remarked onthe develop­ment of Donelly’s sexual member. Esmond was jealous; that night, heand his brother had a bitter fight which ended with black eyes and cut lips.One day, she caught them hiding in a shed and smoking, and told them she wouldpunish them on the spot. This was what they had been waiting for. It wasimpractical to remove all their clothes; they only lowered their trousers, andpressed against her. He said that when it was over, all three of them were veryred and breathing heavily; he was sure she had had an orgasm (although, ofcourse, he did not understand this at the time).A few days later, his mother had taken Esmond into the nearby town to buy himclothes; Donelly was alone in the house. He went up to Bridget’s room and foundit empty. He opened her wardrobe, and found the dress that she used to wear whenshe beat them in Dublin—a brown dress of some stiff material. He placed it onthe bed, undressed, and lay on it, smelling its distinctive smell. Suddenly, heheard the door slam. He recog­nised Bridget’s step. She went through the houseto the kitchen. He wanted her to see him lying on her dress, so he knockedsomething over. She called: ‘Who is it?’ and came upstairs. He pretended to beasleep, and opened his eyes with a start as she stood over him. She appeared tobe genuinely annoyed that he had looked in her wardrobe, and said: ‘I shall haveto punish you—get up.’ Even before he bent over her, he had an erection, but shepretended not to notice it. She picked up a hairbrush and made him bend overher. This time, he noticed that her knees were farther apart than usual, andthat by cautiously pressing on her dress, he could make it slide up her thigh.He tried to peer up her legs, but they were facing the door, and there was notenough light. Suddenly, she said: ‘This place isn’t high enough. Move around theother side’, and moved to the side of the bed that faced the window. He bentover her again, and inadvertently pushed her dress higher. She opened her kneeswider, raising one of them to place it on a footstool, and he could see to thetops of her thighs. She was wearing very loose knickers with wide legs and, withher knees apart, the crotch hid nothing. He began moving his erect memberagainst her knee as she beat him. She changed her position, and her other handbrushed against it, then slowly closed round it. Suddenly, she began to beat himwith fury, striking as hard as she could, and at the same time he felt a sharppleasure in his loins that made him feel faint. He half fell across her, and shewent on beating him; then she shuddered, and dropped the brush. She said: ‘Oh,you’ve made me feel ill’, and lay back across the bed, closing her eyes. He alsolay on the bed. He said they were both exhausted. Nothing further happened thatday. When they heard his mother returning half an hour later, he hurried to hisown room. He told his brother later: ‘I’m going to marry Bridget and have herbeat me every day.’This situation continued for three years, and during that time Bridget becameengaged to a mining engineer, and had normal sexual intercourse with him. Shekept putting off marrying him because she said Mrs Donelly could not do withouther help in the house; the real reason was that she wanted to stay close to thebrothers and continue the beatings. Finally, the engineer won; she married himand they moved to South America.For a week or so, the brothers were desolated. Then one day, Esmond said:‘Pretend you’re Bridget.’ He lay down on the bed, while his brother beat himwith a leather strap. Esmond had an orgasm. Afterwards, Esmond wielded thestrap; Donelly imagined it was Bridget, and also had an orgasm.Back in England, at the age of fourteen, Donelly and his brother were sent to aminor public school. Donelly was made a fag; Esmond, a year older, was not.Donelly was such an unsatis­factory fag that he had the pleasure of being beatenonce a week. And one day, after beating him, the prefect removed his trousersand sodomised him. Since his behind was still painful, the experi­ence wasdoubly excruciating, and Donelly enjoyed it more than any experience so far. Buthe discovered that sodomy without the preliminary beating gave him no pleasure.It is unnecessary to say that I did not leave at the end of half an hour. I evenaccepted more rum. Donelly talked on and on, detailing his experiences in thebrothels of the world. The man had so many fixations and perversions that itwould take another twenty pages to detail them—women’s hair, patent leathershoes (women’s), tennis shirts, rubber boots and raincoats, guns, whips, canes,razor blades. . . . Towards midnight, he showed me his collec­tion of guns, ofobscene photographs, and of whips and canes. He handed me a cat-o’-nine-tailsand asked me to try it. I swished it through the air, and he closed his eyes asif he was listening to delightful music. Then he said dreamily: ‘Would you liketo use it?’‘On you?’ I had guessed this was what he was leading up to.‘Yes.’‘No. I’d feel silly.’He gripped my arm.‘Not even in exchange for the manuscript?’‘You’d let me take it?’‘You could copy it and return it.’‘All right.’His voice became a croak.‘Come in here.’We went into the next room. There was nothing in it but an enormous,old-fashioned double bed with a mattress that looked as comfortable as a woodenboard. Attached to each of the four corners there were leather strapsculminating in handcuffs.He undressed slowly, without embarrassment. I noticed that the curtains on thewindows were very heavy. Now I knew why Donelly had been glad to get rid of hisfarm labourers. In a wooden building of this sort, the sound of blows was boundto carry for some distance, particularly in the still southern nights, where acicada can be heard a mile away.He lay down naked, face downwards, and I looked at him squarely for the firsttime since we had been in the room. His back, buttocks and thighs were littlemore than welted scar tissue. It looked like a snow-covered road after half adozen vehicles have driven back and forth over it. It was amazing that he couldfeel anything.I had to snap the handcuffs on his wrists, then on his ankles, and tighten thestraps until he was stretched out. I left them rather slack at first, but hesaid impatiently: ‘Tighter.’ Then, with his face turned towards me, his eyesclosed, he breathed: ‘Now.’ I knew there was no point in holding back. What Iwon­dered was whether I could go too far and make him ask me to stop. So Iraised the thing above my head—it had a vicious swing—and brought it down ashard as I could. It hissed like a skyrocket. I was astounded to see the deep redmark it made. I hesitated for a moment, and he said between clenched teeth: ‘Goon, keep on, don’t stop.’ So, remembering my part of the bargain, I laid in ashard as I could. If I’d been hurting him, it would have been impossible; but itwas obvious that he was gain­ing the most ecstatic delight from it. I becameworried when the blood began to trickle, and to hit my face in spots as Istruck; but if I stopped, he groaned: ‘Please.’ At one point, he said ‘Stop’,and I thought he’d had enough; but he only said: ‘Now the cane’, and I had tofetch a vicious officer’s cane covered with leather, and beat his buttocks andthighs with it. To begin with, I tried to make it snap by hitting him as hard asI could—my arm was getting tired—but it made no difference. It only bent. Afterten minutes, I sank on to a wooden chair and said: ‘It’s no good, I shall haveto rest.’ He lay still, and I realised he was unconscious. I tried shaking himby the shoulder, but his eyelids didn’t even stir. I was glad he was stillbreathing. If he’d died, it might have been difficult to explain that I wasdoing this in the cause of literature.I went back to the other room and poured myself a beer. Then I went and got thesafe key out of his trouser pocket, and opened the safe. The other envelopesproved to contain letters and other papers. There was nothing more relating toDonelly in it. I took the box from the upper compartment and looked into it. Ared cross on its side indicated that it was a medical chest, and at a firstglance the contents confirmed this—rolls of bandages, a tin of adhesiveplasters, bottles of antiseptic. It struck me that if Donelly got himself beatenonly once a year, he would need a good stock of bandages and antiseptic. Oncloser inspection, I saw there were certain items whose purpose was notimmediately apparent—a number of green tubes, sealed at either end, small roundcaps with wires attached which even I recognised as detonators, a bottle of acoarse brown-coloured powder. I exam­ined one of the tubes. It was made ofplastic, and there was a removable plastic cap at either end. I took out bothcaps, and tried to peer through it like a telescope; but there was a blockagehalfway down; the tube was divided into two compartments. Under the ceilinglight, the dividing wall looked like metal.I opened the bottle of powder and sniffed it. It had a distinc­tive smell, butnothing I recognised. I picked up a bottle of a yellow liquid, and removed itsglass stopper. I recognised this smell from my schooldays: concentrated acid,either hydro­chloric or nitric. I found a saucer in the kitchen—peeping in atDonelly as I went past—and poured a small quantity of the brown powder in it.Then I cautiously poured a drop of the acid into the other side of the saucer,so that it formed a small pool. I tilted the saucer so the acid flowed acrossit. As soon as it met the powder, there was a fierce crackling, and I jumpedback­wards. Something spattered on my face in drops, and burned; I rushed to thekitchen and rubbed my face with a damp cloth. Smoke was already billowing out ofthe other room and into the corridor. The powder in the saucer was crackling andhissing, throwing off sparks. I opened the front door, and then reached outcautiously for the saucer; as I did so, it split in two. But the crackling hadstopped—I had used a very small quantity of the powder. I raked the two halveson to a newspaper, and took them outside; they were still so hot that the paperwas scorched. It took ten minutes or so for the room to empty of smoke.So the problem of the haystack fire was solved. The method was simple andfoolproof. The brown powder would be sealed in one half of the tube. The acidwould be carried to the scene of the fire in a small bottle—there were severalin the box. It would be carefully emptied into the second half, and a hole wouldbe made in the cap to allow the hydrogen to escape. Then the tube would be setcarefully on end, with the acid half uppermost, in the barn or haystack. Donellypresumably knew exactly how long it would take for the acid to eat through themetal dividing the two compartments; if the acid was diluted, it could possiblytake twenty-four hours. Probably he had placed the miniature fire-bomb in thehaystack in the dark hours of Sunday morning. No wonder he looked pleased as hestood watching the fire. It was a triumph of exact timing.I replaced the box in the safe, together with the other papers, and locked it.Then I returned the key to Donelly’s trousers. I was even tempted to solve themoral problem of Donelly’s pyromania by fusing one of his time-bombs and leavingit in the safe among the papers, so that his arson kit would be destroyed. Butit might burn down the house with Donelly in it. That would be poetic justice,but unnecessarily cruel. (Or would he enjoy it?)I covered Donelly with blankets, but left him attached to the bedposts. If I wasgoing to sleep in the house, I would prefer to feel safe; his set of guns andrazors made me nervous. Then I locked the door and climbed into the single bed.Early this morning, I went into Donelly’s room, and found him asleep. Hisbreathing was regular. I unlocked the handcuffs, and he stirred and groaned. Byhalf past six, I was walking down towards the town. I found a roadside café openand ate fried eggs, ham and grits, then rang the taxi driver who brought me. Byeight o’clock I was back at the motel, and I wrote most of this account before Ileft to catch my afternoon plane. I have posted the Esmond Donelly manuscriptback to Diana, so she can type it before we fly back to Shannon on Thursday.Considering how much I’ve drunk in the past twenty-four hours, I feel remarkablywell. April 22, Dallas, TexasI found myself wondering this morning why I had gained a certain pleasure frombeating Donelly. Is there a hidden sadistic component in me, a touch of Austin?And then, after my lecture this morning, the answer struck me. In an odd sort ofway, Donelly’s perversions are a proof of the freedom of the human spirit. Allanimals shrink from pain. Donelly had deliberately acquired the oppositeattitude. He had chosen that pain should be a value, and he made it avalue—something he enjoyed. I know the explanation lies in association of ideasand so on—Bridget, sex, pain—but that makes no difference. If a man can chooseto experience pleasure from a beating, he can also choose to experience mysticalecstasy at the sight of a tree or a leaf. He is not necessarily a victim of hischanging emotions and physical needs. That is why I couldn’t betray him. In adistorted way, there is a touch of the saint about him. A saint without apurpose.On Friday, April 25, we flew back to London, and I had no more time for longjournal entries, for reasons that will become clear.We had intended to return by sea; but the literary puzzle represented by EsmondDonelly made me impatient to return; I was afraid that some other researchermight get to Ballycahane first. But I wanted to spend a day in the BritishMuseum, finding out anything I could about Donelly. Before we left New Haven(where Diana had been staying with friends), the Donelly manu­script was sentback to Denham Springs by registered mail; Diana had made two typed copies. Theplane trip from Kennedy to London was my first opportunity to study thetypescript.It was tantalisingly short. I had not realised, when Colonel Donelly showed itto me, that the manuscript included Esmond’s Refutation of the Theories of DrHume, with some reference to the Discours Preliminaire of d’Alembert. I hadsupposed that Donelly had bought the manuscript already sewn together, butevidently this was not so. The Refutation was thirty or so pages long; Donelly’sjournals were less than twenty (of which I have already quoted three).What most impressed me about Esmond Donelly was the modernness of his mind. Thelanguage is the language of Wal­pole or Gray; the thought was often closer toGoethe, or even William Blake. The central point of his argument against Humeand d’Alembert is very simple: that when man outgrows religious authority, heusually becomes the victim of his own triviality. When does man most frequentlyexperience the sensation of free­dom? he asks, and answers: When he is bored.‘Boredom is to be free, but to experience no particular impulse to make use ofthe freedom.’ And he invents a Swiftian parable to illustrate his point. In themidst of the high mountains of Tartary, he says, there is a valley in whichdwells a race of small but sturdy and healthy people. From the earliest times,it has been part of the religious observance of these people to carry two heavyweights, in the shape of a water-bottle, on either side of the waist. They wouldno more think of walking abroad without their weights than an Englishman wouldthink of walking naked along White­hall. They wear them from birth to death, andthere are strict penalties for removing them. But the greatest pleasure of thisrace is the exercise of walking, and a small band of rebels declare that theweights are intended to make walking uncomfortable. Then even bolder spiritsdeclare that man should be able to fly like a bird or float like a balloon, andthat the weights are in­tended to prevent them from enjoying the freedom forwhich they were created. There is a revolution; the king is executed (aremarkable anticipation of the execution of Louis XVI), and the people tear offtheir weights. To their amazement, nothing hap­pens, except that they find ithard to maintain balance without them. The more timid spirits resume theirweights; the bolder ones practise walking without them, and soon declare that itis merely a matter of habit. They are so delighted with this new accomplishmentthat at first they walk day and night, striding from one end of the valley tothe other, and even attempting to climb the mountains. They soon discover thatthe mountains are sheer walls of rock that cannot be scaled. And now some of theweightless ones fall into a frenzy and rush frantically from one end of thevalley to the other until they collapse with exhaustion. Others attempt to scalethe steep walls out of the valley, and either fall down when they are exhausted,or cast themselves down out of terror or despair. But by far the larger numberof the weightless ones simply sit at home, utterly bored, since they know everyinch of the valley. They jeer at the people who still wear weights, calling themsuperstitious hogs. But after a few generations these weightless ones are dead,for their lack of exer­cise makes them grow immensely fat and die at an earlyage. Finally, only those who wear weights continue to survive; they elect aking, and for many generations the Great Revolt is only a terrifying memory.Until a sect arises that declares that man was created to fly like a bird. . . .The story sounds utterly pessimistic, an allegory of original sin. But I aminclined to reject this view. For Donelly says: ‘There were some of thoseclimbers who were never seen again; yet certain shepherds whose flocks fed underthe shadow of the great walls affirmed that they heard voices hallooing from farabove their heads, where the slopes of the mountain vanished into the clouds.’In other words, perhaps a few of the climbers got beyond the cliffs and over thetop of the mountains.What Donelly is saying—and it is a remarkable perception for aseventeen-year-old boy—is not that ‘Men need weights’, but that the men of thevalley need weights. They are healthy, sturdy and adventurous (i.e. lovewalking), and the only way in which to maintain these qualities in their tinyvalley is to wear heavy weights. But a few among them, a very few, are bornclimbers. . . .Donelly was a born climber—that was obvious. And this was what baffled me. Thisman had lived to be eighty-four (accord­ing to Colonel Donelly); he was atalented writer, an original thinker, a friend of Rousseau and Wilkes. Why,then, had he left so little mark on history? If the Refutation of Hume and thepublished travel diary were all I had to go on, I might have concluded that herewas a talent that spent itself early, like Rimbaud or Wolf. But the unpublishedjournal could leave no possible doubt that his talent remained unimpaired. Sowhat had happened?I should add, in parenthesis, that the purely philosophical part of theRefutation contains some of its most interesting pages, characterised by apsychological subtlety that was at least a century before its time—I could thinkof nothing like it before F. H. Bradley. He cites Hume’s Abstract of a Treatiseof Human Nature, in which Hume argues that the notion of cause and effect isderived from our habits, and is not a ‘necessary con­nection’. Hume says:‘Supposing a man such as Adam were created in the full vigour of understanding,but without experi­ence’, would it not be impossible for him to see thenecessary connection between cause and effect? If, for example, he were watchingtwo billiard balls striking one another, he could not possibly infer, by the useof his intelligence, that they would click and then career off in oppositedirections. For all he knows they might coalesce, or leap up into the air, orsimply stand still side by side.Donelly plunges quickly on that phrase ‘in the full vigour of his understanding’and points out that it is a sleight of hand. ‘Hume implies that Adam’sperception of the billiard balls will be innocent and unprejudiced, when, infact, a completely inno­cent perception, like that of a newly born baby, wouldnot per­ceive the balls at all, or rather, would perceive them without takingthem in, as I might peruse a letter written in an unknown tongue. If Adam is tobe allowed the full vigour of understand­ing, enough to watch the balls withinterest, then he must also be allowed some knowledge of cause and effect. Hemay not know whether the balls will spring apart or combine together like twodrops of water, but he knows that something will happen, which is to say that heknows an effect must follow the cause.’ No, a man as perceptive as this must make some mark on his age. How, then, is itpossible that I had never heard of him? Even if he wrote very little himself,others would mention him—Boswell, for example, or even Crabb Robinson. Totalobscurity for such a man is inconceivable.I had written to a friend in the British Museum from Dallas, asking if he wouldfind me any available material on Donelly; I hurried there promptly at nineo’clock on the Saturday morning after my arrival in London. Tim Morrison—of theDepartment of Printed Books—invited me down to the staff canteen for coffee. Ihad told him all about Fleisher—even about the sugges­tion that I might forgesome Donelly manuscript. Tim’s approach to life is grave and cautious—he oftengives me the impression of a man peering cautiously over a hedge as heapproaches a subject in his precise, hesitant manner.‘I suppose you know what you’re doing. I mean, you don’t want to land in gaolfor fraudulent misrepresentation. . . .’I assured him there was no danger of that, and produced the typescript of theRefutation of Hume. He read it carefully for ten minutes, while I drank mycoffee and glanced at the head­lines of the Guardian. He said:‘I agree this seems genuine. There’s only one thing that bothers me. Why did hegive it to Rousseau? With views like this, he must have thought Rousseau acomplete fool.’‘I’m not sure. There’s an element of optimism in Donelly that probably respondedto Rousseau. Besides, Rousseau isn’t as simple-minded as most people seem tothink. He never really suggested that people ought to go back to nature.’‘No. No.’ He seemed abstracted. I asked him if he’d found me any books onDonelly. He frowned into his coffee cup, then said: ‘You’d better come andlook.’We walked back to his office, which is approached through a labyrinth ofcorridors and spiral stairways. It was immaculately tidy. On the desk there werehalf a dozen volumes with slips of paper stuck in them. He told me to sit at thedesk. Then he sat in the armchair opposite, lit a cigarette, and returned to theRefutation of Hume.The books were disappointing. There was an edition of the travel diary that Ihad already seen, printed in London in 1821 by John Murray, Byron’s publisher,with a brief preface (by the publisher) describing Donelly as ‘an Irishgentleman and scholar’, but offering no other biographical information—not evenwhether Donelly was still alive. (He was, though; he was seventy-two in 1820.)There was a brief reference to him in Gil­pin’s English Diaries in theSeventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries (1876), and a quotation from his diary in abook on Venice by an author whose name I have forgotten. The only interestingreference to Donelly occurs in a letter of Byron to Francis Hodg­son in June1811 (Collected Works, edited by Prothero and Coleridge, Vol. 9, p. 420):‘Sherry [Sheridan] told me that he never knew a wilder character than my father[‘Mad Jack’ Byron], although he had known Wilkes and Donelly in their youngerdays.’ And in another letter to William Gifford (Vol. 13, p. 193) he remarks: ‘Iwas much struck by Esmond Donelly’s assertion, that it was the comparativeinsignificance of ourselves and our world, when placed in competition with themighty whole, of which it is an atom, that first led him to imagine that ourpretensions to eternity might be overrated.’While I was making a note of the various items—I had to pad out my Introductionsomehow—Tim was looking through some papers in a cupboard. When I had finished,he placed a single sheet in front of me. It was a photostat of a page ofmanuscript. The handwriting was not difficult to read, although there were a fewfs instead of ss. It read: . . . was satisfied he meant to fulfil his engagement.The custom of eating dogs at Otaheite being mentioned, Goldsmith observed thatthis was also a custom in China: that a dog butcher is as common there as anyother butcher; and that when he walks abroad, all the dogs fall on him. johnson:‘That is not owing to his killing dogs, Sir. I remember a butcher at Lichfield,whom a dog that was in the house where I lived, always attacked. It is the smellof carnage which provokes this, let the animals he has killed be what they may.’goldsmith: ‘Yes, there is a general abhorrence in animals at the sign ofmassacre. If you put a tub full of blood into a stable, the horses are like togo mad.’ johnson: ‘I doubt that.’ goldsmith: ‘Nay, Sir, it is a fact wellauthenticated.’ This passage is followed by several lines that have been blacked out verythoroughly. Then it goes on: thrale: ‘You had better prove it before you put it into your book on naturalhistory. You may . . .’ I looked up at Tim with a feeling of bafflement, suspecting he had given me thewrong page. He placed another photostat in front of me, this time of a typedsheet. It read: goldsmith (contd): ‘I was told as much by Esmond Donelly, who assured me he hadtried the experiment.’ johnson (rising into warmth): ‘Ay, Sir, I don’t doubtthat such a man would be capable of that and worse.’ gold­smith: ‘He does notlack convivial qualities.’ johnson: ‘Indeed, I believe he is a phoenix ofconvivial malice. The same might be said of the Devil.’ goldsmith: ‘Yet he knowshorses.’ thrale: ‘You had better prove it . . .’ Tim said:‘Boswell usually blanked out the passages he wanted to cancel so they couldn’tbe read. That’s a page of the manuscript of the Life of Johnson—Yale let us havephotostats of most of the Isham collection. They’ve deciphered most of thecancelled passages.’‘Amazing. How did you find it?’‘I didn’t. I mentioned your interest in Donelly to the man who’s cataloguing thephotostats. By complete chance, he’d seen Donelly’s name the day before.’‘So there may be other references to Donelly in the manuscript of Boswell?’‘It’s possible. If we find any, I’ll let you know.’I spent the rest of the day in the Reading Room, but found nothing else ofinterest. Back at Kensington Square (where we were staying with JeremyWorthington, one of the directors of the John Jameson whiskey firm), I discussedmy day’s work with Diana and Sue Worthington. We agreed that it was clear thatJohnson disliked Donelly, which seemed to indicate that he knew of Donelly’sreputation as a rake. But why should he flare up so quickly at the mention ofhis name? Boswell was a rake too; so was Wilkes, with whom Johnson came toterms. Why pick on Donelly? What did he mean: ‘he’d be capable of that andworse’?Sue thought that it probably meant nothing at all except that Johnson wasirritated at Goldsmith’s gullibility. I was inclined to agree. Then Sue said:‘You ought to ask Jeremy about Boswell. He knows someone who discovered someBoswell manuscript.’This was interesting news. I had spent part of the day read­ing Boswell’sjournals, and the story of their discovery, which is fascinating reading. Sinceit has some relevance to this narrative, I will outline it briefly. Boswell diedin 1795 in his mid-fifties, probably of cirrhosis of the liver. Three of hisfriends were appointed his literary executors—the Reverend William Temple, SirWilliam Forbes and Edmund Malone. Boswell’s instructions were that these friendsshould read his private journals and papers and publish whatever they thoughtinteresting. They read the papers, but apparently decided that the stuff waseither too boring or too shocking to be worth publishing. After Macaulay’smurderous essay on Boswell (1843), the latter’s stock sank so low that he wasvirtually forgotten. The Victorian ladies of his family who occasionally glancedinto the papers were so shocked by what they saw that they felt justified incirculating a rumour that the Boswell diaries had been destroyed. One canunderstand the effect of a passage like the following (for November 25, 1762): I picked up a girl in the Strand; went into a court with intention to enjoy herin armour [contraceptive]. But she had none. I toyed with her. She wondered atmy size, and said if I ever took a girl’s maidenhead, I would make her squeak. Igave her a shilling and had command of myself to go without touching her. In the mid-1870s, Birkbeck Hill, editor of Boswell’s Johnson, was practicallythrown out when he went to Auchinleck—the seat of the Boswells—and asked to seethe Journals.In 1905, the last of the Boswell line died, and the estate passed to Lord Talbotof Malahide, near Dublin, including the ebony cabinet containing papers thatBoswell had mentioned in his will. An American professor, Chauncey Tinker,became interested in Boswell and advertised in the Irish Press for material onhim. He received an anonymous letter suggesting that he try Malahide Castle. Aletter to Malahide produced no effect, so Tinker finally decided to call there.This time he was in luck. Lord Talbot allowed him to see a small part of thecollection of Boswell papers. Subsequently, an American lieutenant-colonel,Ralph Isham, heard of the papers, and succeeded in buying them from Lord Talbotin 1927. Professor Geoffrey Scott, and then Professor Frederick Pottle, setabout the task of publishing this vast body of material—more than a millionwords. And from then on, new Boswell manuscripts continued to turn up. A croquetbox at Malahide Castle proved to contain more Boswell letters and the manuscriptof the Tour to the Hebrides with Dr Johnson. In 1930, Professor Abbott ofAberdeen was going through the papers of Sir William Forbes—one of Boswell’sexecutors—and discov­ered another rich cache of letters and manuscripts. Forbeshad obviously borrowed some of the papers to examine them, in accordance withthe will, and then forgotten to return them to Auchinleck. And in 1940, stillmore Boswell papers were found in an old cow barn on the Malahide estate,including the manu­script of the Life of Johnson; the page I had seen in theMuseum came from this manuscript. No one has ever explained quite how Boswell’spapers got into a cow barn.Obviously, the Boswell manuscripts were thoroughly dispersed. In fact, theearliest discovery was made in 1850 by a Major Stone in Boulogne, who boughtsomething in a grocer’s shop and found it wrapped in a letter signed ‘JamesBoswell’. Stone was able to buy a whole pile of letters written by Boswell tothe Reverend William Temple—a clergyman to whom he confessed the filthierepisodes of his life—and he later published them, suit­ably bowdlerised. Thosehad apparently got to Boulogne through Temple’s daughter, whose clergymanhusband moved there in 1825. When they died, their papers were sold—or given—toa pedlar of wrapping paper, who passed them on to the grocer.Tracing the complicated history of the Boswell papers had made me aware of thedifficulties I might face in the quest for Esmond Donelly. Obviously, no amountof patience and diligence would be of any avail unless luck was on my side.Oddly enough, I had a curious feeling of confidence, which may simply have beenthe outcome of my intense interest in Donelly and the literature of hisperiod—for, apart from Blake and Goethe, I have always found the writers of theeighteenth century a pretty disappointing bunch, and therefore never taken thetrouble to study them.From what Sue Worthington had told me, I assumed that Jeremy was acquainted withsome member of the Talbot family, or perhaps with whoever had discovered thepapers in the cow barn. As soon as he came in the door, I asked him:‘What’s the name of your friend who found some of Boswell’s papers?’‘Oh, he didn’t actually find them. They were found by a chap called O’Rourke inPortmarnock.”‘Not Malahide?’‘No, not Malahide, although it’s pretty certain they came from Malahide. As faras I can make out, some of the Boswell papers were borrowed by a retiredclergyman named O’Rourke during the first world war, and they never gotreturned. His son found them after his death.’‘What happened to them?’‘Well, they’re in the hands of a strange old maniac called Isaac JenkinsonBates, who lives in Dublin. His nephew’s one of our testers in the distilleryand he told me about them one day.’‘Have you ever seen them?’‘No. The old boy’s pretty cagey about them. Obviously, they really belong to theMalahide estate—or perhaps to this American university that bought the papers.’‘But do you know anything about them?’‘Nothing much, except that some of the stuff’s pretty porno­graphic.’‘That sounds odd. I mean, what would a clergyman be doing with it?’‘He was probably a dirty-minded old man.’‘Do you know the address of this Jenkinson character?’‘Not offhand, but I’ve got to ring Dublin on Monday—I’ll ask Hurd—that’s thenephew.’And there the matter stood for the weekend. I knew that my chances of getting tosee the old boy were limited, if he was as cagey as Jeremy said; but there wasjust a hope that his nephew might be able to apply pressure. On Monday, Jeremy rang me from his office. He had just spoken to the old man’snephew. Hurd had verified that Jenkinson Bates was extremely cautious aboutshowing his material. But in the course of the conversation, he had mentionedsomething that sounded promising. Bates was extremely interested in murder. Soit was not impossible that he had read my book The Sociology of Violent Crime.Jeremy suggested that I write to him on the subject of Irish murder in theeighteenth century, and try to make his acquaintance that way. Jeremy gave meBates’s address at Baggot Street in Dublin.There was not a great deal more to do in London. I spent two more days there,seeing friends, lunching with publishers and drinking cocktails. Under normalcircumstances I would have enjoyed the total change from lecturing; but now Ithought about nothing but Donelly. I wrote a letter to The Times LiterarySupplement about my interest in Donelly, and another to the Irish Times. And Ispent a futile afternoon in the British Museum, trying to discover if IsaacJenkinson Bates had ever written a book on murder; if he had, it was not in theMuseum. On Wednesday morning, Sue Worthington drove us to London Airport tocatch the plane for Shannon. Just before we left the house, Jeremy rang, andasked to speak to me.‘I’ve just been talking to Jim Hurd again. He mentioned something that mighthelp you in your approach to old Bates. Apparently the old man believes that theIreland’s Eye murderer was innocent. Do you know anything about the case?’‘I remember a little. Man called Kirwan.’This was a valuable piece of information. At midday we caught our plane, landingin Shannon just over an hour later. Tom Kenny, our local garage man, had drivenour old car down to the airport to meet us. Two hours later, we were back inMoycullen.There is an immense feeling of relief in returning home from a long journey. Ilove Ireland: the narrow roads, the shabby small towns, the incredible green ofthe fields, the low clouds, the peaty lakes. I began to feel something likeresentment of Donelly, for preventing me from relaxing completely for a week orso.Our house stands half a mile outside Moycullen, up a narrow, rocky lane thatbecomes a torrent in the rainy season. It is an eighteenth-century vicarage,built of grey limestone, the walls covered with lichen and ivy. We bought it in1963, on the proceeds of the ‘Sex Diary’. In our absence, Diana’s formerhusband, Robert Kirsten, had been looking after the house for us. Since 1960 hehas been Composer in Residence at a series of American universities, and hasbeen enormously successful. Last autumn he decided he needed a long period ofsolitude to com­pose, so we invited him to stay with us. He’d been in the housesince January; Mrs Healy, the wife of the shepherd down below us, cooked hismeals. Kirsten had left for Dublin three days before we returned—two of hischamber operas were being per­formed there, and he was to conduct. The house wasempty and peaceful. Mrs Healy had lit fires in the dining room and our bedroom,giving them a cheerful brightness. Our house tends to be dark, since it issurrounded on three sides by trees, and some of the rooms are panelled inmahogany; except for the electric lights, it could be the setting for one of LeFanu’s novels.I stood at our bedroom window—Mopsy was jumping up and down on the bed andmaking its springs creak—and looked out over Lough Corrib. There was a slightdrizzle that was little more than mist. The trees, with their spring buds,looked black and wet. There is a hypnotic quality about our part of Ireland;visitors to our house find themselves sleeping for twelve hours at a stretch,and still yawning at four in the afternoon. As I stood there, the firelightflickering on the walls, I experienced an enor­mous relaxation that made merealise how much my lecture trip had tired me. My emotions seemed to sink into adeep feather bed; a great peace and detachment came over me. And it struck mesuddenly that Esmond Donelly might have looked out on this scene, nearly twocenturies ago, and seen very much what I now saw. Then I remembered Fleisher’sassertion that Donelly had seduced both illegitimate daughters of the localpriest, Father Riordan, and I felt jarred. If it had been one daughter, it wouldhave been understandable; some pretty, innocent country girl, probably broughtup by a neighbouring farmer or shepherd (perhaps an ancestor of Sean Healy), whomight have seen Donelly as he paused at the local grocer one day for a glass ofwhiskey or porter, and been fascinated by the well-dressed, cul­tured gentleman.And Donelly would look at the healthy cheeks, and think how pleasant it would beto remove the coarse linen dress and run his hand over the shapely body as ifshe was a thoroughbred horse. This would be natural and pleasant; but theseduction of two girls indicated a gloating sensuality, an obsession withconquest.Mopsy said: ‘Daddy, can I have a bath now?’, and broke my train of thought. Iundressed her, put her into the bath, then went downstairs to open the bottle ofCalifornian burgundy I had stood near the fire—I had brought it all the way backfor the pleasure of drinking it in my own sitting room. I put a record on thegramophone—Delius’s violin concerto—and allowed myself to sink into a state ofblurry and soft-edged melancholy. The wine was very slightly warm. Most of thewine authorities say that one should never expose it to direct heat, but I findthat ten minutes in front of a fire never does a vin ordinaire any harm. Ipoured myself a large glass-full, and drank half of it straight down—the way Ilike to drink the first glass of wine of the evening. It quenches the thirst,gives the best of its flavour to the palate, and produces an immediate warmglow. Our cases stood by the door, still unpacked; but I wanted to enjoy thesavour of being back in my own home. Our sitting room has a distinctive, notunpleasant smell—resembling somewhat the smell of old books. Most of ourfurniture was bought by Diana at local auctions—she has a passion for jumblesales and auctions—and there is not an item that could be described as modern.Looking around, it struck me that Esmond Donelly might have sat in a room suchas this; for all I know, he had sat in this very room. I reached out for one ofthe shopping bags Diana had carried on the plane, and found the typescript ofDonelly’s Refutation of Hume, and opened it casually. . . . I am not criticising Mr Hume’s logic, which is invariably cogent. But I amsuggesting that his temperament is such as to blind him to certain varieties offeeling. His logic may demolish the aspirations of the alchymists; but what doeshe know of their visions? I stopped to think about this. It was obviously worth a critical footnote,pointing out the similarity of the idea to Blake’s: How do you know but ev’ry bird that cuts the airy wayIs an immense world of delight, closed to your senses five? And again I wondered: How could such a man be a boasting Casanova, pursuingwomen out of some absurd obsession for mere quantity? And what had Johnsoncalled him: ‘a phoenix of convivial malice’? Somehow, this was the last phrase Iwould think of applying to the author of the Refutation of Hume.The record finished; I went to turn it over, and looked for a moment out of thewindow that faces west. The clouds were low on the hills of Iar Connaught, butthe sky behind them was bright. On the opposite hillside, a row of poplars stoodagainst the skyline. For a moment, I was back in the bedroom at Long Island,tasting the faintly smoky taste of Beverley’s small nipples, then feeling theexploding warmth of loins as I looked past her shoulder at the trees on thecliff top. I pushed away the blurry melancholy, grasped at the flavour ofhardness that came over the poplars, and knew again with sudden total insightthat human beings must never accept the ingredients of present-consciousness,that greater horizons always lie beyond the bounds of immediacy judgements. Fora moment, I was Esmond Donelly, asking what Hume knew of the alchemist’s vision.The contradictions van­ished; suddenly, I understood Donelly. For him, thealchemist was not a transmuter of metals, but a transmuter of conscious­ness;and sex was the philosopher’s stone that could transmute the base metals ofordinary consciousness into vision.Mopsy yelled: ‘Daddy, I want to get out.’ I got Diana out of her kitchen andsent her upstairs. I wanted to fix this insight and explore it. Because therewas still an obvious problem. No one would deny that sex has this power to raiseconsciousness to a higher intensity; since Lawrence, it has become a commonplaceof the twentieth century. But Lawrence also knew another secret of the sexualimpulse: ‘What many women cannot give, one woman can.’ Ever since I had beenwith Diana, my own interest in seduction had waned to a mere curiosity. I couldlook at a pretty girl and wonder what kind of bra and panties she was wearingunder her clothes or whether she lay passively in bed or moved violently, butthe curiosity was not strong enough to lead to pursuit. In recent years, I hadeven been surprised to discover an increasing tendency to reject those harmlessforms of mutual satisfaction that are offered with ‘no strings attached’. A girlat a party once said to me frankly: ‘Why don’t we share a bed afterwards? It’sbetter than masturbating in separate beds.’ I agreed and we spent the nighttogether, with ‘no strings attached’. But in the morning, I realised that itwasn’t entirely true that there were no strings. Two bodies had interpenetrated;so had two worlds. I didn’t particularly like her world; it was too vague andfutile. Like planets that have approached too close, we had caused seismicdisturbances in one another. I can no longer remember what she was like in bed;but I can clearly remember certain anecdotes she told me about the failure ofher marriage, that still disturb me. I would have done better to leave herspinning in her own orbit.This is why I suspect Casanova’s veracity. He was neither stupid norinsensitive—that much is clear. Yet there is little evidence in the Memoirs thatthese mutual disturbances took place. A girl is young and ‘amiable’; she beginsby rejecting the liberties he tries to take, until his blandishments ‘changeanger to a softer passion’, after making him promise not to despise herafterwards, she allows him to undo her corset strings. Even if the girl is aseventeen-year-old virgin just out of a convent, there is never any suggestionof the usual difficulties, physical or psycho­logical; only vague references tospending ‘several delicious hours’ or ‘giving ourselves up to an ecstasy ofpleasure until daybreak’. There is a dream-like air about it all. Donelly was no Signeur Jacques Casanova de Seingalt, that was clear. And thenecessity of finding out more about him became an almost physical discomfort. Iwent into the dining room, where I keep my books on law and criminology, andsearched until I found an account of the Ireland’s Eye murder case. It wascom­monplace enough. William Bourke Kirwan was an artist who lived at Howth withhis wife in the year 1852. One afternoon in September, they hired a boatman torow them out to Ireland’s Eye, the attractive little island that lies a mileoutside Howth harbour—and within sight of Malahide. It was a still day, and atseven o’clock, screams were heard from the island. At eight, the boatman arrivedand found Kirwan still sketching—a sus­picious circumstance, since it was dark.Kirwan said he wasn’t sure where his wife had gone—he presumed she was somewhereon the other side of the island, still swimming. They found her in a shallowrock pool, her face badly bruised, her lungs full of water. Although a verdictof accidental death was returned, the circumstances were so suspicious that thebody was exhumed. Kirwan was sentenced on circumstantial evidence; he claimednot to have heard the screams which could be heard on shore; he had a mistresswith a baby in Dublin. Many people believed him to be innocent, and the deathsentence was subsequently commuted to penal servitude. He later married hismistress, and emigrated to America.I went to my study, switched on the electric fire, and typed out a letter toIsaac Jenkinson Bates, saying that I intended writing about the Ireland’s Eyecase in a book on murder, and wondered if he would mind explaining to me why hebelieved Kirwan innocent. Then I walked down the hill and posted it. After that,I felt relaxed enough to read Mopsy a story about Peter Rabbit. I was up early the next morning, and took a stroll around Ross Lake. When I cameback, Diana said: ‘Miss Donelly of Croom rang up. She wants you to ring herback.’‘Did she sound friendly?’‘More or less. She says she’s written you a letter.’There were two large cardboard boxes full of the correspon­dence that hadarrived while we were in the States; so far, I had not worked up the energy togo through them. Now, while Diana cooked me egg and bacon, I emptied them on thefloor of the study. I told Mopsy to sort out all those that had been re­directedfrom my publisher—these could wait. I opened two parcels of records, and severalbooks from publishers who hoped for a favourable quote they could use inadvertising. (Regret­tably, they never send the books I would like to get free;only the ones that are likely to get bad reviews.) Finally, I found the letterwith a Limerick postmark, addressed in a neat, round hand.I must confess that I had not been entirely frank with her in the letter I hadwritten from New Haven. I saw no point in getting doors slammed in my face fromthe beginning. So I had simply told her that I had heard about Esmond Donellyduring my lecture tour—leaving her to infer that someone in my lecture audienceshad raised the name—and wanted to write an essay on him for a future book. Itook the risk of adding that I had spoken to Colonel Donelly and seen a copy ofDonelly’s Travel Diary.Her reply made me feel ashamed of myself. Dignified but friendly, she said thatshe was happy to hear that her ancestor was not entirely forgotten, and that shehad spent years trying to persuade an English publisher to reissue the Diary.She and her sister would be delighted to see me any time I cared to call. In themeantime, they would write to the solicitor who was holding the Donelly papersin safe-keeping and get him to bring them to the house. . . .Again I had pangs of conscience, and felt inclined to drop the whole thing. ThenI fortified myself with a glance at the manu­script I had already uncovered, anddecided it would be absurd to drop a venture whose beginnings had been soauspicious. I rang the exchange and got put through to Miss Donelly’s num­ber. Abrisk, rather English voice answered.‘Ah, Mr Sorme, it was kind of you to ring back. Your wife tells me you only gotback from America late yesterday. You must be quite exhausted.’I said I was feeling fine, and enquired when they expected to get the papersfrom the solicitor.‘Oh, they’re here now. He was very prompt. We’ve been reading them through. It’ssimply fascinating material. How do you propose to travel? By train?’When I said by car, she asked me why I didn’t drive over immediately and havelunch with them. I looked at my watch, and said I could be there bymid-afternoon. Before I hung up, she said:‘I hope you won’t be offended if I ask you one question.’ My heart sank. ‘I hopeyou’re not interested in any of the nasty stories about him?’‘Nasty stories?’ I saw myself entangled in a web of evasions and half-truths.But she said:‘My sister saw one of your books in the library, a book about murder. I hopeyou’re not interested in the silly rumours about Esmond and Lady Mary Glenney?’I was able to say, with an enormous sense of relief, that I had never heard suchrumours. She said in a business-like voice:‘Good, I’m delighted to hear it.’ There was a click, and she suddenly snapped:‘Tina, are you listening on the other line?’A timid voice said:‘Yes, dear.’‘I wish you wouldn’t. It’s a most annoying habit.’ The line suddenly went dead.I stared at the phone for a moment, then hung up. Before leaving the house, I rang an old friend at the University of Galway,Professor Kevin Roche. His assistant said he was at home. I rang him there.‘Do you know anything about Esmond Donelly?’‘The fellow who wrote a book about deflowering virgins?’‘Do you think he really wrote it?’‘I don’t see why not. My copy has his name on the title page.’‘Do you have it there? Could I come and see it?’‘Certainly. When would you like to come?’‘Now,’ I said. And within forty-five minutes I was in Kevin’s study, overlookingGalway Bay, and with a fine view of Inishmaan and Inishmore.I had already decided to pursue my policy of discretion, for news travels fastin Ireland. So after we had exchanged civilities, and I had accepted a smallglass of Bushmill’s, I handed Kevin the manuscript of the Refutation of Hume,and told him that I had been asked to edit it for publication.‘Rather short, isn’t it?’‘I’m hoping to find other things—letters and journals. I’m just going to see theMisses Donelly at Ballycahane.’He handed me the paperback book that lay on his desk; it had been printed by theObelisk Press in Paris. Of the Deflowering of Maids, by Esmond Donelly. A shortintroductory note signed Henry V. Miller repeated the facts I already knew aboutDonelly—his date and place of birth, his travel diaries; the fact that thepresent volume was published in German by Brockhaus of Leip­zig (who was alsothe publisher of Casanova’s Memoirs) in 1835, and by an anonymous Dutchprinter—obviously translated from the German edition—in English in 1863. Iopened it to a chapter called: ‘Of the Fallacy that all Women are Alike in theDark’. robin. Pray, sir, continue with your instruction, for I hang upon your words.lord cobald. You flatter me, my dear boy. But I find it highly gratifying thatyou agree with me about the import­ance of acquiring this tender knowledge. Wemust next consider the fallacy, propagated by Claude de Crébillon and MrCleland, that has been expressed in the words ‘All cats are grey in the dark’.You may take my word for it that, when I look back over a lifetime of women, Ican remember no two who were alike when their thighs were apart. I am not nowspeaking merely of the formation of the nether regions of delight, which may beplump or boney, fleshy or firm, downy or bristly, but of what I might call thesoul that dwells in the cunt. No man of breeding would confuse the dark wine ofBurgundy with the clairet of Bordeaux, and even a child can tell the differencebetween an apple and a pear, though one be soft and juicy and the other hard andastringent. So it is with women. And just as the taste of a wine is judged bythe first mouthfull, so the individual flavour of a girl may be most clearlygrasped in the first movement of encunting, as the velvet head is received bythe coral lips. I have known wenches that were sharp and fresh, like an appleeaten by moonlight, others that were syrupy and soft, like a pear or a peach;others who were hard and round in the arms, but sweet within, like a melon.robin. Indeed, sir, I understand you well, for my two sisters, who were bornwithin an hour of one another, are as different as could be in bed.lord cobald. Your penetration delights me [a Freudian pun, this]. Pray acquaintme with your own view of the difference between them. For I myself have neversucceeded in telling one from the other by appearance alone.robin. As to that, sir, my mother herself often calls one by the other’s name.Yet between the sheets they are as unlike as could be. Agatha is such as youdescribe, syrupy and soft like a peach. When I enter her, her cunt welcomes mewith warm and tender embrace, as is appropriate from a sister who loves herbrother. And then, sir, I feel as if I have become my own prick, and am tenderlyengulfed from head to foot. The sensation is not unlike immersing in a warmbath, as I do every Candlemass. Now Christina, on the other hand, produces amost lewd and lustful sensation as I slip within her, for she seems toexperience surprise that a man should perform so strange an operation, or eventhat she should be lying there naked. In consequence, I find myself imaginingher fully clothed, in the brown velvet dress with silver buttons she wears whenpouring tea, or the green gown she wears for riding in the park, and the shockof finding her cunt defenseless makes me drive into her like a stallion, so ’tiswonder that her belly has not swelled before this.lord cobald. Your gift of expression is remarkable, my dear boy. That isprecisely the difference I have observed between them. You are lucky to havesuch gifted sisters. My own sister, when I finally succeeded in overcoming hermodesty, was pleasing enough, but as tasteless and fuzzy as an apple that hasbeen left in the bowl too long. I put down the book, and looked across at Kevin, who was still absorbed in theRefutation of Hume. If he had looked up, I would have said: This is anotherforgery. The first page might have been written by Donelly, for it has the kindof psychological penetration I have come to expect of him. But the paragraphabout the sisters has more than a touch of de Sade’s Philosophy in the Bedroom,while the last sentence has a touch of cruelty that is not justified even by itspsychological insight.But by the time Kevin looked up from the typescript, I had changed my mind aboutspeaking. If I explained why I was certain it was a forgery, I would have toadmit that I knew more of Donelly’s work in this manner. So, instead, I maderemarks about it being fascinating stuff. Kevin himself was delighted with theRefutation, and asked me if he might get it copied, to write an article on thedevelopment of Donelly’s style. I promised to let him have it when I had shownit to the Misses Donelly, and left him. It was after midday, and I wanted to getto Limerick. It was only after I had gone through Oranmore that I remem­bered Ihad forgotten to ask him if he knew anything of a scandal involving Lady MaryGlenney.I dropped off Diana and Mopsy in Limerick, where they could do a few hours’shopping, then drove south on the Cork road, through flat, drowsy, pastoralcountry that looked almost feverishly green in the April sunlight. I stopped inBallycahane to enquire for Castle Donelly, and was told that I had come too farand would have to go back towards Adare and turn off the road. With theseinstructions, I managed to draw up at the front door of Castle Donelly at aboutthree o’clock.It is not, of course, a castle, but a Queen Anne house, built of silvery brickwith red brick Corinthian pilasters; the walls are covered with ivy, and thehouse has an atmosphere of neglect that is so common to great Irish houses,particularly in Con­naught and Munster. A fine flight of water-lily steps—whichare curved—ran up to the front door. Their surface was so irregular that Iwondered how anyone could get up and down without twisting an ankle. The RiverMeigh runs beside the house, and the ruins of Adare Abbey stand against theskyline. It came as a shock to realise that this house looked new and smart whenDonelly was born in it—for it was built around 1700—and that the walls wereprobably free of ivy even when he died here. It was like taking a leap back intothe past, and it brought a dis­turbing sense of passing time.Before I had reached the top of the steps, the door was opened by a vigorouslady in riding clothes; she had cropped iron-grey hair, and stood with her legsastride, like one of Rowlandson’s country squires. The handshake was as hard andfirm as a man’s.‘I’m Eileen Donelly. Delighted to meet you.’ Her accent was English upper class,with a touch of Irish in the vowels. ‘I’m glad you made it.’The place was impressive and cold, with a huge flight of stairs running to murkyupper regions; there was a great deal of marble, which contrasted oddly withpeeling Victorian wallpaper. But the library she led me into had a large fire.Another lady, also in male attire, was knitting by the fire. She was introducedto me as Miss Tina; she was small and sweet-faced, and female clothes would havesuited her better. I suspected that the riding breeches were to keep out thecold. They offered me tea, and Miss Tina went off to make it. Miss Eileen stoodin front of the fire, her legs apart, hands behind her back, and made generalconver­sation about the weather, the countryside, and so on. Then we talkedabout America. She seemed to be very curious about America, and after tenminutes or so, remarked casually that she had heard that Americans would offerlarge sums for houses such as this. I said this was probably so. How much? sheasked. I took a very quick guess, and said that the right person would prob­ablypay twenty-five thousand for it. ‘Pounds or dollars?’ she asked quickly. I saidpounds. At this she looked very thoughtful. And as Miss Tina poured the tea,using a beautiful eighteenth-century tea-service that might have been the oneRobin’s sister Christina used, I realised suddenly why they were so interestedin this revival of Esmond Donelly’s reputation. These two had no children; whyshould they not sell this huge and uncomfortable house, and buy themselves apleasant flat in London? I began to feel less guilty about my quest. Thepublication of Memoirs of An Irish Rake would certainly increase theirancestor’s reputa­tion more than that of the travel diary or the Refutation ofHume.Miss Tina asked me about Colonel Donelly, and I told her a little about hiscareer in recent years. She looked very sad.‘Poor man. We really ought to write to him, Eileen.’‘Maybe. I seem to remember there was something a bit rum about him. Did you findhim odd, Mr Sorme?’‘No, not in the least,’ I said.‘Of course, he’s only a second cousin,’ said Miss Eileen thoughtfully. I couldsee she was thinking of marriage—probably to Tina. It struck me that ColonelDonelly would probably like Eileen; she looked as if she might be a skilful handwith a riding crop. I made a mental note to drop Donelly a line.Miss Eileen said: ‘Well, if your wife’s in Limerick, you don’t want to spend allafternoon here, I suppose. Dreadful place, Limerick. Lot of damn fanatics. Theyburned one of my an­cestors back in 1540. Bishop Donelly, known as Holy Joe.Didn’t like his politics.’ She led me into a small room adjoining the library. Asingle-bar electric fire was burning, so that it was not too cold; it alsocaught something of the western sun. On a small table there were two largefolders, the kind made to look like books. She opened one of them, and my heartraced to recognise the handwriting on the topmost sheet of yellow foolscap. Shesaid:‘I’ve stuck bits of paper in the places I thought might interest you. He’srather good at descriptions—there’s a rather splendid one of Pisa. Well, I’llleave you to it. Tina’ll be in the library if you want anything.’She left me alone, and I began to read avidly: Rue de Grande Chaumière. Sept 11, 1766[when Donelly would be eighteen]My dear Papa,The letter of recommendation to M. Blaizeau proved ex­tremely useful, and Idined with his family last night. He sends you his kindest best wishes. Hisbusiness has suffered reverses in recent years, but he still lives verystylishly. He excused himself early on account of his gout, and Mme Blaizeau andher two amiable daughters accompanied me on a stroll along the Promenade duJardin Turc, whose coffee houses present singular and astonishing spectacles.They are not only crowded within, but other expectant crowds are at the windows,listening with à gorge deployé to certain orators who harangue their audiencefrom chairs. . . . I glanced quickly through the rest of the letter. It was all pleasant,informative stuff of the kind one might expect from Horace Walpole or ArthurYoung—obviously, the letter of a young man who is anxious to assure his parentsthat he is not wasting his life or substance. I glanced quickly through the restof the letters, reading one here and there at random. As I read, my sense ofdisappointment deepened. There was nothing here of the kind that I could notfind in the Travel Diaries; in fact, there could be little doubt that parts ofthese letters had been used in the Travel Diaries.The two folders contained an enormous number of papers: letters, legaldocuments, a fragment of a novel that reminded me, in style, of Fanny Burney’sEvelina, household accounts, letters of introduction—the kind of thing thatwould delight an academic biographer. I took notes—for the sake of appearances,in case Miss Eileen looked in on me—rather than out of interest. There wassomething very frustrating about all this stuff, most of which dated from the1760s to 1785. I wanted to know the names of the Mesdemoiselles Blaizeau, andwhether Donelly had been attracted to either of them. There were severalreferences to them over the next few months; but not a word to indicate whetherthey were plain or pretty, let alone whether Donelly was roman­tically inclinedtowards them.I tried to cheer myself with the thought that I would be a fool to expect thathis family papers would contain revelations. Anything of the sort would havebeen destroyed during the Victorian era, or perhaps even by the Donelly sisterswho were my hostesses. Somehow, I doubted that the sisters had removed anythingfrom these family papers; they were too innocent, too open-faced about theirancestor.Miss Tina peeped in the door and asked me if I would like more tea. I declinedwith thanks. She asked how I was getting on. I said politely that I found it allmost interesting. Then I drew from my pocket the copy of the quotation fromBoswell, and showed it to her. I said:‘Have you any idea why Dr Johnson should have disliked Donelly?’She shook her head. ‘No. Except . . . didn’t he dislike the Irish anyway?’I said I didn’t think so.‘There’s nothing in these papers to indicate that Donelly was a “phoenix ofconvivial malice” either. He emerges as a rather respectable, sober sort ofperson.’She said: ‘Oh, I don’t think he was terribly respectable.’‘Why not?’‘Oh, I don’t know. There were stories—rumours. Nothing very definite. He spent alot of time in Switzerland and Italy, didn’t he? I believe people were ratherwicked in those days.’She said this wistfully, looking out at the river, in which the tall forms ofthe ashes were reflected. After a moment, she said: ‘Of course, Dr Johnson mayhave been making a sort of pun. Esmond’s journals had a picture of a phoenix onthe cover.’I thought about this for a moment.‘No, that’s impossible. Johnson made the remark in 1773. The earliest edition ofthe travel diary is 1791.’‘I don’t think that’s true. I’m sure we have an earlier one. Would you like tocome and look? My eyes are not very good.’We went into the library, and she said vaguely:‘I seem to remember it’s on one of those shelves up there.’The books stretched up to a height of about ten feet. I took a library ladderthat rested against the wall, and climbed up to the shelf she indicated. It tookme about five minutes of searching before I came upon a number of leather-boundvolumes with Donelly’s name on the spine. Some of them were the small,pocket-size edition of the Journal I had seen at Colonel Donelly’s. This was anedition of the travel diary in four volumes, printed in London in 1793, with thenote ‘3rd edition’. There was also a larger volume, beautifully bound in aleather that showed little sign of wear even after two centuries. It wasentitled: Observa­tions upon France and Switzerland, by Esmond Donelly, Gent,printed for J. J. Johnson (and a great list of other names), London, 1771. Thefront cover and the title page bore the image of a phoenix rising from itsflames, the stylised kind of emblem to be found in heraldry. As I stared at it,it struck me that the feathers on its breast would be taken by a modernpsychologist for phallic symbols. After all, the feathers of a bird pointdown­wards, and taper towards the end; these pointed upward, and were shapedlike sausages. I said:‘It’s strange that no one has mentioned this earlier. Colonel Donelly didn’tseem to know about it.’‘Probably not. I believe the whole edition was destroyed.’‘Why?’‘There was a fire. You’ll find it mentioned in one of the letters. I saw it onlythe other day.’I climbed down, bringing the book with me. Miss Tina went into the other room;after a five-minute search, she handed me the last sheet of a letter. Thepostscript read: Calamity! Tooke has just told me that Johnson’s ware­house in the Strand hasburnt down, and every copy of my book with it. It is fortunate that the accidenthas cost me nothing. The letter was dated September 11, 1771. This, then, explained why theObservations upon France and Switzerland had never been heard of. And, as Icould see, even this copy had not been read from beginning to end, for many ofits pages were still uncut. I turned over its pages, until my eye was arrestedby the word ‘phoenix’; I turned back to the previous page and read the wholepassage. In Heidelberg, the carriage in which Donelly proposed to take anexcursion broke down. The innkeeper told him that no other was available, butthat the local pastor, the Reverend Kries, had a carriage which he occasionallyhired out to distinguished visitors. Donelly found Kries in his gardenover­looking the Neckar, and was taken to see the carriage, in a nearby barn;the pastor remarked that it had not been used all winter, and would be dusty anddamp. Donelly looked at it and decided that it could be made presentable with afew minutes’ work; the pastor declined to take money for its hire. On the wayout of the barn, Donelly noticed the wooden image of a phoenix lyinghalf-covered by straw. He asked the pastor what it was doing there, and was toldthat it had been included in a lot of furniture he had bought at auction a yearbefore. Feeling that it was unsuitable for a vicarage, he had thrown it into thebarn. Donelly, rather surprised, enquired why it should not be suitable for avicarage. He seemed surprised at my ignorance, and asked me if I was not aware that thebird was the symbol of a sect of heretics, sometimes known as the Brethren ofthe Free Spirit, sometimes as the Sect of the Phoenix. I replied that I onlyknew that the phoenix was sometimes used as a sign outside the shops ofapothecaries, and that I presumed it had some alchemical significance. Whereuponthe learned man discoursed to me upon the history of the Sect of the Phoenix. Itarose in Europe at the time of the Black Death, when it became widely believedthat venereal lascivious­ness was a remedy against the disease. The basicargument ran thus: there can be no true spirituality without inward­ness; mancan never know the truth while he casts around outside of his soul, entanglinghimself in outward things. In the crisis of sexual pleasure, the spirit is moreconcentrated than at any other time. The Brethren of the Free Spirit believedthat God is everywhere and in everything; every stirring of delight is arevelation from God. In the name of this belief, all manner of lewd excesseswere performed, sometimes upon the very altar. The Inquisition uprooted thesedoctrines with cruel severity, but the Sect of the Phoenix proved to share thenature of its symbolic bird, and arose ever and again from the ashes of thestake and the funeral pyre. And since, according to Herodotus, the life­time ofthe phoenix is five hundred years, we may confi­dently affirm that the sect willcontinue to flourish for at least another century.I replied that I had read in the Epistle to the Corinthians of St Clement ofRome that the phoenix is a symbol of Christian resurrection, but the good manreplied that this is Popish bedevilment, and that everyone knew that St Clementhad been tied to an anchor and thrown into the sea as a punishment for hisenormities. I thereupon offered to relieve him of this symbol of Popishdegeneracy, and we settled upon the sum of three thalers. This was the end of the passage—no mention of what became of the carved phoenix.I copied out the whole section in long-hand. Then I went into the library andasked Miss Tina if she knew of a carved phoenix in the house—it seemed to methat it would be an appropriate symbol to place on the cover of the projectedvolume of Donelly’s Memoirs. She said she had never heard of it, but that shewould ask her sister. Before I could stop her, she had left the room. I sat onthe arm of a chair, and idly glanced through the Observations. It slipped off myknee and fell on the floor, standing on end with its pages open. As I picked itup, it struck me that its back cover was thicker than the front one. Moreover,the flyleaf did not appear to be properly attached; unlike the front flyleaf, itwas not glued to the last page of the book. I bent the cover slightly, to seewhy it was loose, and realised that there was a pocket between the cardboardcover and the flyleaf, which had been made by glueing only the edges of theflyleaf to the cardboard. Inside this pocket there was a folded sheet of paper.I drew it out and opened it. The paper was of excellent quality, very white andvery thin. It contained only a fine drawing of a phoenix, rising from its nestof flame, and the inscription: Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas, which Irecognised to be a tag from Virgil meaning ‘Happy the man who has been able todiscover the causes of things’. What impressed me was the bird itself; the wingsand tail feathers were of gold, as were the flames rising from the nest; therest of it was as exquisitely tinted as a Blake drawing. In the lower right-handcorner, in the unmistakable writing of Esmond Donelly, was the sentence:‘Received, September 1, 1771’. If it had not been for this date, I would havefound it difficult to believe that the drawing was not far more recent, for thepaper was whiter and finer than any I had previously seen from this period, andshowed no sign of ageing.I heard Miss Tina coming back, and I slipped the paper into the book. She toldme that there was definitely no wooden phoenix in the house, unless it washidden in one of the attics. I thanked her, and apologised for giving hertrouble. Then I returned the Observations to its place on the shelf. Miss Eileencame in and asked me how I was getting on, and was obviously disappointed when Isaid I would have to leave. I assured her that I had found a great deal ofvaluable information among the papers, and showed her my notebook to prove it.The two sisters both accompanied me to the door, and told me to come back anytime.I drove back to Limerick in a very thoughtful mood. It might be said that theafternoon had been wasted; but this was not entirely true. I had learned thatEsmond had two sides to his personality: the dutiful son and writer of traveldiaries, and ‘the erotic traveller’, to borrow a phrase of Sir Richard Burton’s.And no scholar, studying the material at Castle Donelly, would have suspectedthe existence of the erotic traveller.And then there was the minor puzzle of the phoenix. I talked to Diana about itas we drove back to Galway. The letters estab­lished that the Observations uponFrance and Switzerland had been printed in July 1771. The Heidelbergepisode—when he had bought the phoenix—took place in August of the previousyear. For some reason, Donelly had used the phoenix as a symbol on the cover ofhis book—perhaps an exact copy of the one he had bought from the Reverend Kries.On September 1, he had received the beautiful drawing of the phoenix I had seen,with its Latin tag about discovering the causes of things. Presumably, thismeant received in the post. Diana objected that he might have ordered it to beengraved and received it from whoever had tinted it. I disagreed. If that wastrue, why had he bothered to write ‘Received, September 1’? If I receive throughthe mail a book I have ordered, I may well write my name and the date inside it;I do not write ‘Received’, because it is obvious that I have received it. We usethe word ‘received’ to acknowledge payment of bills, or in speaking of a letteror parcel. My own theory was that Esmond had received the drawing of the phoenixunexpectedly, and that it came anonymously—otherwise, he would surely havewritten ‘Received from So-and-so’, or even enclosed the covering letter with thedrawing?Then who could have sent the drawing? Someone interested in the phoenix as asymbol? Or—I suppose it is just conceivable—some member of the ‘Sect of thePhoenix’ mentioned by Kries? The latter was an exciting possibility, althoughonly re­motely conceivable. Diana thought it far more likely that some lady hadsent him the drawing as a souvenir, perhaps with a billet doux. I wished I hadexamined it more closely. The paper might have had a watermark that would givesome notion of its origin; a paper so expensive would surely have the symbol ofits manufacturer embossed on it? I should also, of course, have compared thedrawing closely with the phoenix on the cover of the book. If they wereidentical, then it would certainly argue that Esmond had commissioned someone tomake a drawing of the bird he had bought from the Reverend Kries.There was also the curious fact that Esmond reported that the whole edition ofthe Observations had been destroyed less than two weeks after receiving thephoenix. And it may or may not have significance that he never again used thesymbol of the phoenix on his books—at least, it was not on the edition of thetravel diary I had seen in Louisiana, or the one at Castle Donelly.I had no idea how one could check whether such a fire had occurred; presumablyit would mean finding out what had become of the firm of J. J. Johnson, andtrying to trace their records. I found this notion discouraging; I have noparticular talent for this kind of detective work. Boswell, unfortunately, wasin Edinburgh practising law from 1769 to 1772, or he might well have mentionedthe fire—since J. J. Johnson was also Dr John­son’s publisher. This explains why the days following my visit to Castle Donelly were completelyuninteresting as far as this narrative is con­cerned. The Donelly letters hadbeen my chief hope; now I was not sure what I should do next. I phoned orvisited every public library between Cork and Sligo. Some of them had a copy ofthe Travel Diary; none of them had anything else. Kevin Roche tried to behelpful, suggesting various acquaintances in the aca­demic world who might knowsomething about Donelly; none of these leads came to anything. I wrote to TimMorrison in the British Museum, and to every antiquarian bookseller I knew. Andalthough Tim was unable to unearth any more references to Donelly, he was ableto add one more item to my file on the Sect of the Phoenix. What he wrote was asfollows: I’ve spoken to Ted Malory, who is our expert on the mediaeval church, about yourSect of the Phoenix, and he has some useful bits of information. He tells methat there is no evidence that the Sect of the Phoenix and the Brethren of theFree Spirit are the same thing. The latter were a here­tical sect, founded byAlmeric of Bena, who was expelled from the University of Paris in 1204, and diedin 1209. Their doctrine, apparently, was that man becomes united with Godthrough love, and that when this has happened, man is incapable of sin. So theypractised a great deal of sexual licence, and a lot of them were burnt at thestake, including Marguerite of Hainault, a beguine nun, who seems to have beenalso a nymphomaniac.The only reference Ted can find to the Sect of the Phoenix occurs in St NilusSorsky (1433-1508), at the end of his third tract on spiritual prayer. Mytranslation (from the German edition of 1903) is a very rough one:‘It is often believed that heretical notions are a danger only to those who holdthem, and to others who come into contact and are contaminated through them. ButSt Theo­dosius tells us that they are hateful to God for their own sake, and mayresult in suffering (or punishment) for the innocent. The case of the Sect ofthe Phoenix in the pro­vince of Semiriechinsk provides the most terrible exampleof this. They believed that men and women may grasp the divine revelationthrough carnal delight rather than prayer, and their village (settlement) nearLake Issikoul was full of abomination and harlotry. Then the Lord God sent adisease that destroyed them all, and subsequently spread through the country ofthe hyperborean Scythians, and sub­sequently to all the world. This was in theyear of our Lord 1338.’Incidentally, you may be interested to know that the Russian archaeologistChvolson believes that the Black Death may have started in a Nestoriansettlement near Lake Issyk-Koul in Semiriechinsk—which is Kirghiz territory,near the borders of China and India. This view is supported by Professor R.Pollitzer, Plague, World Health Organisation Publication, Geneva 1954, p. 13. All this was fascinating, of course; but it raised so many un­answerablequestions that it was also very frustrating. Who had founded the Sect of thePhoenix, and why? What were its doc­trines? The eleventh and twelfth centurieswere a time in which many heretical sects were founded: the Waldenses, theAlbigenses, the Khlysty—the latter have often been accused of hold­ing frenziedreligious ceremonies that turned into sexual orgies. If the Sect of the Phoenixwas regarded as sufficiently dangerous to be responsible for the Black Death,why was it not better documented?This was not as irrelevant as it sounds. If I could not find out much more aboutEsmond Donelly, then I might at least pad out my Introduction with suchmaterial. As to the text itself, it could consist of excerpts from Of theDeflowering of Maids and Fleisher’s spurious MS, as well as the undoubtedlygenuine manu­script I had obtained from Colonel Donelly, together with theRefutation of Hume. This meant that my main problem was still to find morematerial for my Introduction.On the Saturday after our return from America one of those coincidences occurredthat I have learned to take for granted in matters involving any kind ofobsession. Diana and our daily help, Mary, were sorting through an old box ofletters, with a view to burning as many as possible. Mopsy picked up a letterwith a rather elaborate woodcut across the top, showing the serpent twinedaround an apple tree, whispering to Eve. In the way that children have when theyfeel they are not getting enough attention, Mopsy came across to the study whereI was writing, and said: ‘Look what I’ve brought you, Daddy.’ Think­ing Dianahad sent it, I glanced at the signature: Klaus Dunkel­man, then at the letter.It was dated 1960, and was a ‘fan letter’ about the Sex Diary, which had beenpublished early that year. The writer asked me if I was familiar with the workof Wilhelm Reich, and went on to quote the titles of books I ought to read. Itwas a familiar kind of letter, even to the suggestion that the writer might havea great deal to teach me if I cared to listen, and that we ought to inaugurate along correspondence. Diana had scrawled on it: ‘Answered, 9/11/60’. I presume Ihad thanked him for his suggestions, and promised to read the books hementioned. I was now about to drop the letter into my waste-paper basket when myeye caught the name ‘E. Donelly’. The sentence read: ‘Körner’s ideas have, ofcourse, been anticipated by several other thinkers: de Sade, Crowley, E.Donelly, Quérard, Edward Sellon, etc.’ Körner was apparently a disciple ofReich’s, who believed that the orgasm held the secret of psychological health.The address on the letter was Compayne Gardens, West Hampstead. It seemedunlikely that the writer would still be there after nine years, but it was worthtrying; so I dropped him a line, mentioning my interest in Donelly.On the following Monday, I had to reconsider the embarrass­ing problem of theMisses Donelly of Castle Donelly. A letter arrived, signed by them both, butpresumably written by Miss Eileen. She said how pleasant it had been to meet me,and how she had been able to see at a glance that I was trustworthy and thatEsmond’s reputation would be safe in my hands. I groaned with embarrassment as Iread it. She was glad that a writer of my reputation had at last becomeinterested in Esmond, and felt that I would be the right person to do thestandard biography. . . . I dropped the letter on the bed and drank my tea; myfirst inclination was to throw it in the waste-paper basket and forget it. Ithought she was a damned nuisance and ought to let me alone; I had better thingsto do than writing a standard bio­graphy. Of course, a revival of interest inEsmond would be greatly to her advantage; she might sell his papers to someAmerican university at a comfortable figure.But the problem nagged me. I had intended simply not to contact them again.After all, I had not made use of any of their materials; I owed them nothing.Now I had to plunge further into deception, or commit a breach of good mannersby ignoring her letter. Suddenly, I decided that there was only one simplecourse: to tell her the whole truth. I slipped on a dressing-gown and hurriedinto my study, anxious to get it over with. It was a long letter—it was bound tobe, since I was determined to un­burden myself. I began by pointing out that shemust be aware that the book Of the Deflowering of Maids was attributed toEsmond—that I had even seen a copy in the home of a professor in Galway. I toldher about the New York publisher, and ex­plained that he was determined to goahead anyway, whether I co-operated or not. I explained that Fleisher’smanuscript was a fake, and that, in my own opinion, the only way of vindicatingEsmond, under the circumstances, would be to publish as much of his genuine workas possible. I also told her frankly that there was nothing in her Donellypapers that could be of the least use to me, since his letters home were asblameless as one might expect.On my way down to the post box, I told myself that this was probably a stupidthing to do; I had not mentioned it to Diana, since she was sure to try todissuade me. Miss Donelly might even write a letter to the T.L.S. denouncing myproject and drying up all sources of information. But it was a risk I had totake. I dropped the letter into the box with the feeling of a man point­ing agun at his own head.The next morning, I was still dozing when the telephone rang. Diana picked upthe bedside extension, then said: ‘Miss Eileen Donelly for you.’ I groaned. Iwas tempted to tell her to say I was out; but my conscience won through. If shequarrelled with me, at least I could go ahead without hating myself.Her voice barked: ‘Hello, Mr Sorme?’‘Speaking.’‘I’ve just had your letter. I’m jolly glad you’ve been so frank with me. Mostdecent of you. I rang you up to say I quite see your point.’‘You do?’ I was breathless, and wondered what she was leading up to.‘Look here, from what you say, there’s nothing much we can do about thispublisher chap.’‘I’m afraid that’s so.’‘Right. Then the next best thing is to make sure things don’t get out of hand.We’ve got to keep a close eye on him. Tina and I agree that we ought to give anyhelp we can.’I said that I was delighted, of course. In fact, I didn’t know what to think. Ineeded time to collect my thoughts. But she gave me no time.‘We’d like to talk this over with you. When could you come over here?’‘Any time that’s convenient.’‘How about later today?’I said all right, and felt a wave of relief as the line went dead.By the time Diana had made tea, I had begun to understand what had happened. TheDonelly sisters had nothing to lose by the publication of Esmond’s ‘sexdiaries’, particularly if they managed to sell the house. I had assured themthat the diaries were not mere pornography; that they would cause a steep risein Esmond’s reputation; that in these days of sexual frankness, no one would batan eyelid. I had cited Boswell’s journals and so on. Miss Eileen had decidedthey might as well be on the bandwagon. And full access to her papers wouldindeed be useful in writing the biographical part of the Introduction. But ifshe was hoping to persuade Fleisher to disgorge another fifteen thousand dollarsfor the use of her material on Esmond, she was due for a disappointment.I was feeling pretty gloomy as I drove to Limerick shortly after midday. I hadcalled on Kevin Roche and borrowed Of the Deflowering of Maids, and I now hadthe other fragments of the ‘sex diary’ with me, including Fleisher’s originaltype­script. But it was a beautiful day; the air smelt fresh, and every­thinglooked so green that it was impossible not to enjoy it. And as soon as I relaxedand decided to forget the Donelly sisters, I experienced a great sense of warmthand richness, of the immense potentialities of the world that are obscured byour tendency to remain jammed in our petty motives. It crystallised further as Isat drinking a beer outside a grocer-tavern a few miles south of Gort, listeningto the rippling of water as it flowed under a bridge and ran towards LoughCutra. It was suddenly unimportant whether I drove on to Limerick, or sat here.The stream would go on flowing; that tree with its lime-coloured leaves, thatover­looked the stream, would remain itself. And it struck me that here is oneof the strangest and most important things about human existence: this capacityof the mind to detach itself from people and events, to stop identifying withhuman emotions, and to identify instead with the timeless, the world of Nature.What happens? I stood on the parapet of the bridge and watched the waterreflecting the sunlight, and it seemed that something in me followed the flow ofthe water, ran away towards the lake. When I returned to the car and drove on, Ihad the odd sensation that my soul was free of my body and was flying alongsidelike a bird, taking occasional swoops and dives. When my mind came back to theDonelly sisters, I had ceased to feel foreboding.I experienced a momentary apprehension as I saw Miss Eileen coming down thesteps to meet me; but she dispelled it by taking my hand in her mannish grip andsaying: ‘Well, well, it’s pleasant to see you again.’ We went into the library.Miss Tina was not there. I took a seat on a dusty nineteenth-century couch, inthe sunlight, and let Miss Eileen do the talking. I had to admire her forthrightintellect.‘Well, as we see it, there’s no point in trying to stand in the way of thisbook. As you say, it was bound to get published sooner or later. So the bestidea is to try to keep it in your hands. Which university were you at, by theway?’ I said I wasn’t, but she brushed this aside. ‘Don’t suppose it matters.You’re obviously a competent, intelligent sort of chap. If you get in first withyour book on Esmond, the others’ll have to fall in line.’ She was taking it forgranted that I would write a full biography of Donelly, and I didn’t want todisappoint her at this stage, so I nodded and said nothing. Miss Tina came inwith tea and cakes, and greeted me like an old friend. And when we all had cupsand plates of sandwiches, she said:‘I must say, it came as quite a surprise to hear that Esmond was so notorious.I’d never heard of this book about deflowering virgins.’ She said it entirelywithout embarrassment. I took the opportunity to produce the book out of mybriefcase, as well as the typescript of Colonel Donelly’s MS. While they lookedat them, I said: ‘I wonder if you’d mind if I look at Donelly’s books again?’ Itook down the Observations, and the four-volume Travels, and retired to thewindow seat, so as not to embarrass them. Periodically, I heard Miss Eileenmutter: ‘I say!’, and she would pass the book to Miss Tina, who would glancequickly at me, then read avidly, making clicking noises with her tongue.I opened the Observations and took out the drawing of the phoenix. I held it upto the light. Yes, there was a watermark, partly obscured by the drawing. Andthen I had to restrain the impulse to laugh loudly. It was in the shape of aphoenix!I compared the tinted drawing (or it could have been an etch­ing) with theembossed phoenix on the cover. They were iden­tical in outline, but there werehalf a dozen differences. Quite definitely, they were not the same bird.When Miss Eileen looked over at me, I showed her the draw­ing of the phoenix.She glanced at it, said: ‘Umm, rather nice’, and handed it back to me. She wasclearly not interested.Miss Tina said: ‘Have you showed Mr Sorme the letters, dear?’‘Ah no, I forgot.’ She went into the small room next door, and returned with abundle of papers tied with tape. ‘Tina said you wanted to know if there was awooden phoenix in the attic. So we had a good search. Didn’t find your phoenix,but we found a lot of old papers—great boxes full. I don’t think most of ’emhave got anything to do with Esmond, but these seem to be letters addressed tohim.’I quickly untied the tape. As soon as I began to separate the papers, somethingfell out of an envelope to the floor. I picked it up. It was an oval miniature,without its frame, and had been painted on a piece of some carved white shell ormother-of-pearl. It was a painting of a very beautiful girl, with her hair inringlets down to her shoulders. It had nothing written on it.The letters themselves were not in Esmond Donelly’s hand­writing; some seemed tobe from someone called Thomas Walgrave, some from William Aston, some fromHorace Glenney. They seemed to be in no kind of order. Some were in envelopesand some were not. Walgrave was apparently a clergyman of Dublin, and Astonlived in Cork. Glenney, I soon realised, had been a fellow student of Donelly’sat Göttingen, and was appar­ently the son of Lord Glenney of Golspie, inSutherland.In the midst of this pile of letters there was a parchment envelope with nothingwritten on it. Inside, I found a slip of paper cut to the same shape as theminiature; written on it, in Esmond Donelly’s handwriting: ‘Lady CharlotteIngestre, 2nd d. Earl of Flaxstead’. Also in the envelope, there was whatappeared to be a page of a letter in Donelly’s handwriting. As I read this, Iknew I had found something else for my book. Voltaire has argued, in his Philosophical Dictionary, that sect and error aresynonymous, since there is no room for sectarian opinion in matters that areknown to be true; for example, in geometry or science. Our religiousprofessions, he says, should be confined to matters on which all minds agree.But he goes on to assert that all minds agree upon the worship of God and uponhonesty. This is not true, for the Bhoudistes do not accept God, and the Jesuitshave reservations about honesty. Is there, then, any common ground for religiousagreement?I would argue, my dear friend, that there is no man of intelligence who does notrecognise this world to be a mystery. It takes only a moment’s thought torecognise that our certainties are the certainties of habit, obeyed by us likethe rules of piquet or whisk [whist], but in no way self-evident.Religions assert that what lies outside the rules of the games we play isunknowable, or known only to God and the angels. But science has taught us thatanything may be understood if the method of inquiry be sufficiently subtle andlogical.I would argue that our certainties are not seen, but felt, as I now feel thewarmth of the sun upon my hand as I write. I would argue that our habit ofattempting to get at truth by the method of seeing or reasoning has blinded usto its true nature, like a man who tries to tell the difference between Canarysack and cold tea by sight alone. The mys­tery of the world becomes apparent tous in moments when our spirits are profoundly moved or disturb’d, if thedis­turbance be harmonious. In these moments of mystery, it is as if we becameaware of the vibrations of an underground stream, like the one I heard nearVevey, and may sometimes feel so close to it that we can hear the noise of itsrushing.When I am suffering from ennui, it is like being deaf with a cold in the head; Ihear nothing. When I look upon the face of Charlotte Ingestre, the deafnessvanishes; I hear the rushing beneath my feet.And surely if religion is this sense of the mystery of creation, and of theproximity of the mystery, then there are no objects so conducive to holiness aswomen and moun­tains? Why should it not be . . . The fragment breaks off here, halfway down a page, as if the writer wasinterrupted. But the words ‘my dear friend’ seemed to suggest that Donelly hadbeen making a preliminary draft of a letter, and that he suddenly decided thathe may as well start copying it into the letter itself. Who was its recipient?The envelope containing the fragment was in the midst of letters from HoraceGlenney, and Glenney’s own letters to Donelly quoted Voltaire, Fontanelle andd’Alembert; it was a reasonable assumption that Glenney, Donelly’s collegefriend from Göttingen, was the recipient of his confidences and of his religiousspecula­tions.Miss Eileen had put down the typescript, and was looking out of the window in aslightly dazed manner. I asked her:‘Have you ever heard of a Lady Charlotte Ingestre?’Both she and Miss Tina looked startled. It was the latter who said, after aglance at her sister:‘Why, yes. She was the daughter of the Earl of Flaxstead. . . .’She paused, as if embarrassed. Miss Eileen finished, in an almost sepulchralvoice:‘And the sister of Lady Mary Ingestre, who later became Mary Glenney.’I needed no reminding about the latter; the name had been in my head ever sincelast week, when Miss Eileen had first mentioned it over the phone. I said:‘Did you know that Esmond was in love with Lady Charlotte?’Miss Tina said: ‘They say he was in love with all three of them.’‘Three?’‘Lady Mary, Lady Charlotte and Lady Maureen.’ She glanced nervously at hersister. Miss Eileen shrugged, and said:‘I suppose he’ll have to find out about it anyway.’Miss Tina said: ‘They were certainly all very beautiful.’‘Do any pictures exist?’‘Oh yes. Romney’s portrait is quite famous.’‘Where is it?’They looked mildly surprised at my ignorance.‘Here, of course.’‘Could I see?’The two of them got up without speaking, and led the way out of the room. In thehall, Miss Eileen vanished for a few minutes. She returned with a huge key. Wecrossed to a pair of great mahogany doors. Miss Tina said:‘The insurance people insist that we keep the gallery locked. Some of thepictures are worth rather a lot.’Miss Eileen unlocked the door, and a breath of cold, musty air came out. Sheswitched on lights, and we went into the ‘long gallery’. It was icy. The windowswere covered with shutters, and the tables and chairs with covers. I could wellbelieve that no one had been in it for at least a year. She led me to a rathersmall picture on the end wall. It needed cleaning, but even that could notdetract from the beauty of the three faces. The girls were posed conventionallyagainst a background of trees and part of a fountain. Charlotte, whose portraitI had already seen, was immediately recognisable. The only thing the sisters hadin common was beauty. Charlotte’s face was pink-cheeked and inno­cent, anarcadian face. The girl sitting next to her, playing with a poodle, was visiblymore intelligent, a fine, delicate face with a swan’s neck, the hair short,almost boyish. Miss Tina identified her as Mary, who later became Lady MaryGlenney. Maureen, clearly the youngest, had a face that would become verybeauti­ful, and that was also gentle and generous. She was obviously impulsiveand warm-hearted, the kind who would burst into tears at a sad story. One of herhands reached out to caress the dog—a gesture plainly symbolic of a nature thathad to give affection.Miss Tina said with pride: ‘Esmond only paid Romney thirty guineas for that.We’ve been offered five thousand pounds for it.’I could see why Esmond was rumoured to be in love with all three sisters. Afterstaring at the portrait for five minutes, I was close to it myself. Each one hadqualities in her face that seemed to emerge as one stared at it; I could havewritten a novel about the three of them.‘Do you have a portrait of Esmond?’‘Oh yes, two. One by Raeburn and one by someone called Zoffany.’The Zoffany portrait told me little; the face was immobile, lacking any spark oflife; it showed Donelly in officer’s uniform, leaning against a tree. He wasapparently fairly tall and thin. The face was long, lantern-jawed, the noseprominent.The Raeburn was altogether more rewarding. It was unpre­tentious, with almost nobackground; it was in some respects little more than a sketch. But Raeburn hadcaught a sort of eagerness in the face, which seemed to lean forward as iflistening to an interesting anecdote. It was not exactly a handsome face; thebony nose and high cheekbones made me think of Sherlock Holmes, but the mouthwas too sensual. Turning back from this to the Zoffany, I now saw otherqualities in the latter: the size of the chin, a sort of control about theposture, like a thorough­bred horse standing still at a parade.As we left the room—all three of us frozen—I said:‘I think that Esmond has all the qualifications for attracting crowds ofadmirers and commentators.’‘Do you think so?’ They both looked eager.‘This business of being in love with three beautiful girls makes him quite afigure of romance—very Byronic. What a pity the rest of his journals havedisappeared. He’s a far more interesting character than Boswell.’Miss Tina said: ‘I once saw a film about Chopin. They did it rather well. Icried all the way through.’‘I imagine they might want to make a film about Esmond.’‘Would we make a lot of money?’‘I imagine so.’‘We’d share with you, of course,’ said Miss Tina.‘Do you know any details of the romance with the three sisters?’‘Not really. It’s just a family story.’‘What about the death of Lord Glenney?’Miss Eileen said: ‘He was shot. I don’t know many details, but my father oncelooked them up in the Dublin National Library, so it shouldn’t be too difficultto check. There was talk about Esmond being suspected, but Father said hecouldn’t pos­sibly be guilty. I hope you’ll make that clear.’‘I’ll certainly do my best.’Before I left, they showed me up to the attics. They were very dark, very dusty,and full of lumber that had accumulated for centuries: broken picture frames,baulks of timber with no obvious purpose, broken furniture, porcelainwash-bowls, bundles of paper that might have been anything from farming accountsto the missing diaries. I glanced into some of these and under­stood whatProfessor Abbott must have felt in the attic at Forbes House, surrounded bymanuscripts. But the memory of Abbott gave me an idea.‘Have you any idea whom Esmond appointed as his literary executor?’They looked at each other blankly.‘No. We’ll try to find out.’Before I left, I said that I might have to come back again very soon to look atthe papers. At which, to my astonishment, Miss Tina said: ‘Wouldn’t it besimpler if he took them with him, dear?’, and Miss Eileen said withouthesitation: ‘Oh, certainly.’ They helped me bundle them into the back seat ofthe car, and waved aside my offer of a receipt. I drove off feeling ratheroppressed by their trust. Then, as I thought about it, I began to understand thereason. They were lonely and rather broke, living alone in magnificent butdraughty grandeur, with no expecta­tions except to get older. They probablywondered which one would go first. When they were dead, the house would probablypass to some distant member of the family in Canada or New Zealand. And now thegreat world was knocking on their door; there was something to dreamabout—publishers, film rights, scholars visiting them. They wanted to believe inall this, and therefore they wanted to believe in me, to accept me completely,to regard me with a certain affection. What I had regarded as the greatestobstacle—Esmond’s reputation as a writer of porno­graphy—turned out to benothing of the sort, since I declared the pornography spurious, and meant tostate this opinion in print. The fragment of Donelly’s journal I had obtainedfrom Colonel Donelly was sexually frank, but no more so than Boswell; above all,it was well written.These considerations made me feel better. I thought there was a very fair chancethat there would be a Donelly revival when Fleisher brought out the Memoirs.Altogether, it was a satis­factory outlook. When I examined the new batch of letters, I knew that we now had a book, whetheror not any further Donelly MSS turned up. Apart from the Donelly manuscript,this was the most fascinating material yet.It is difficult to imagine three correspondents more completely different incharacter than Thomas Walgrave, William Aston and Horace Glenney, and theyrevealed the complexity of Donelly’s own personality. Walgrave was a Dublin manwhose chief inter­ests were astronomy and mathematics, and his letters toDonelly were mainly concerned with these subjects. Aston was studying theologyat a Protestant seminary in 1772, the date of the first letter, and later becamea clergyman at Ballincollig, near Cork (where his family home was situated). Hewas greatly troubled by what appeared to be two opposing trends in Donelly’scharacter: towards infidelity and towards ‘enthusiasm’ (i.e. fanaticism ormysticism). When Donelly quoted Voltaire, Bayle or Montesquieu, Aston repliedwith arguments from the sermons of Jortin, Ogden, Tillotson, Smalridge andSherlock. All this I found unbelievably stuffy and dull—the lengthyhair-splitting on transubstantiation, predestination, the truth of theScriptures, etc. But it was clear that Esmond did not find it boring, forAston’s replies were long-winded and circumstantial, indicating that hiscorrespondent’s were equally so.It was the Glenney letters that fitted in with what I already knew of EsmondDonelly. When sorted into their correct order (with a certain amount ofguesswork—several were undated), they ran from May 1767 to Christmas 1771.Glenney and Esmond were together at Göttingen for most of this time, so thecorres­pondence was not as voluminous as in the case of Aston. Clearly, theyexchanged letters when they were apart for any length of time, and this was notoften, for they were very close friends.The story of their relationship, which I was able to piece together fromGlenney’s letters,* is as follows. When Esmond Donelly had met Rousseau andBoswell at Neuchâtel, he pro­ceeded on to Milan, where he spent the Christmas of1764. In January, he spent a week in Venice, then spent a further week in Grazen route to Göttingen. Here he made the acquaintance of Georg ChristophLichtenberg, who later became an eminent philosopher (but who, at this period,was interested chiefly in mathematics and astronomy) and of the Hon. HoraceGordon Glenney. The latter was a handsome, dark-skinned youth with an almostJewish cast of countenance and a pronounced Scottish accent; slightly older thanDonelly, but immensely less sophisti­cated; the second son of a Scottish lairdfrom one of the wilder regions of that country. Lichtenberg, Glenney and Donellyhad one thing in common—a lively interest in the opposite sex. Göttingen wasfull of healthy young farm girls, ‘bouncing creatures from the valleys of theHarz or the Solling’, wrote Lichtenberg, ‘who have never seen a sum larger thana thaler, and to whom the braided hat of the nobleman is an object of awe, andthe requests of such a hat, royal commands’. Göttingen was a town of highacademic reputation, unlike Halle, Jena and Giessen, which were full of loutswhose chief interest was in duelling. But, like most other towns in Germany, itwas a highly ordered, highly regimented place, where the peasants were used toobeying the will of their masters. (It was also, of course, a part of England,since George III was Duke of Hanover as well as King of Great Britain; this wasno doubt the reason that Esmond’s parents chose it.) Esmond and Horace Glenneywere delighted to discover that these delicious creatures did not have to beseduced, like the girls on their estate at home; Glenney mentions in one of hisletters that Lichtenberg twitted him with accusation that he aimed at takingevery maidenhead in Hanover, in preparation for a lifetime of abstention when heshould return to his own puritanical country.* Which will be published as an appendix to Donelly’s Memoirs.Compared to Esmond, Glenney was a fool; or, if not a fool, at least a manwithout intellectual breadth. Esmond dominated him completely, and Glenneyapparently infuriated a professor called Kästner by telling him that Esmond wasone of the greatest minds in Europe after Moses Mendelssohn. (After this,Kästner used to address Esmond ironically as ‘Magister Doctissime’.) Whatfascinated Glenney about Esmond was the com­bination of intellectuality andphysical vitality. Litchenberg was brilliant, but he was also a hump-backedcripple. Esmond was a fine swordsman, a good horseman, a good swimmer, afavourite with ladies, and also something of a poet, a philosopher and a mystic.Glenney had been subjected to heavy parental domina­tion; he was inclined to bedour and repressed. Within a few months, Donelly was describing him as ‘anapostle of gallantry, carnality, seduction, ribaldry, stupration anddefloration’. Soon they became bored with the serving wenches of the town, andbegan to pay court to the daughters of professors and other respectablecitizens. Both were apparently amazed and delighted with their success, andEsmond came dangerously close to getting married to the youngest daughter of aparson from Norten-Hardenberg, a Fraulein Ulrica Duessen. But it should not beassumed that Esmond and Glenney were inseparable. Glenney would have beendelighted if they had been; but Esmond was also interested in reading Kant, andstudying mathematics and astronomy. Glenney makes several references to hisfeeling of being neglected. But he admired Esmond so whole-heartedly that heaccepted whatever attention Esmond could spare.The letter Glenney wrote to Esmond on December 29, 1766, is fairly typical. Hespends a page and a half complaining that Donelly declined his invitation tospend Christmas at the family seat near Golspie, and describing the rigours ofthe journey north in late November. Glenney’s description of the food eaten onChristmas Day has to be read to be believed, beginning at seven thirty in themorning with a breakfast of oat cakes, braised salmon, roast beef, ham, kidneysand porter. But the main item of the letter, inevitably, is the description ofhis amorous adven­tures over the holiday. ‘I was at first determined that Ishould obtain the favours of a girl named Maggie McBean, the daughter of one ofour tenant farmers who had already shown a tender­ness towards me before I left,although she sware then that she would rather die than lose her self respect.’The defloration of Maggie proved easier than he had expected; it wasaccom­plished in a barn after a dance at which the young laird had been thecentre of interest to the local girls. (In a district so sparsely populated, thelord and his tenants mixed freely.) Glenney was tempted simply to continue anaffair with Maggie, ‘which indeed I would have done without further thought thanat any time in the past; but I now bethought me of your excel­lent principlethat the basic aim of life is a certain freshness of experience, and I had toconfess that my desire for the girl was lukewarm, and that the sight of herlinen cap and her check cloth apron no longer produced their old effect. Itried, without success, to devote my mind to study. . . .‘On the 28th, my sister Mary (whom you met in Perth) returned from Kincardine,where she had spent Christmas with Fiona Guthrie, the daughter of an old friendof my mother’s. My sister, as you know, is thin and small for her age(fourteen), and I may say without undue pride that she loves me with a warmththat I have done little to deserve. It came as somewhat of a shock to discoverthat Fiona had changed a great deal in the eighteen months since I last saw her.She is in that charming stage where the manners and thoughts of a child remain,while the body is that of a grown woman. She has a charming, rosy face, and anupper lip that is too short for its companion, giving her mouth an outthrustappearance which might be mistaken for petulance. As a child she had been atomboy (if that word may be deprived of all connotations of immodesty), and Ihad often romped with her and swung her by the wrists. And now, since she hadgrown so pretty, I decided I might do worse than follow Mr Sterne’s advice andcultivate a sentimental† relation with her, even though it should be somewhatone-sided . . . [I have in­serted leader dots where there are digressions on hismotives, since they serve no real purpose.] This proved to be easier than Iexpected, for all I had to do was to treat her as I treated Mary, with muchattention and brotherly affection. I give you my word that my thoughts up tothis stage were as blameless as Pastor Geiss could have wished. Their room had afire, and I spent hours there drinking dishes of tea and describing the customsof Hanover, feeling for all the world like Othello the Moor. I found the tenderregard of these two children more pleasing than the study of Flaccus, andconvinced myself at one point that this was what Rousseau had in mind, when hespeaks of the bliss of the second state of nature.† In Sterne’s day, this did not mean emotional, but characterised by idealisticor elevated feelings.—Editor.‘Alas, my elevated feelings suffered their first defeat on the second day of thenew year, about half an hour before dinner. The girls were romping when I cameinto the room, and when I joined in their game, I could not help noticing thebouncing of her bosoms as she jumped upon the bed to escape Mary, nor the fineshape of her calves as she leapt down again. When I paid her a compliment on thechange in her shape, she was not em­barrassed, but laughed at me, and Marydeclared it was through the eating of too much mutton. Then they asked me toread to them from Grandison, which I accordingly did, sitting before the fire onthe hearthrug, while they sat beside me and sewed the blue muslin dresses theyare both to wear for the ball at Strathpeffer in February. After a while, Marybecame so absorbed that she laid by her sewing and placed her head on my lap,stretching her legs out to the stool; some minutes later, Fiona did the same;but since Mary had usurped the soft part of my thigh, she had to lay her cheekhigher still, upon something that soon ceased to be soft. She also curled up insuch a manner that the back of her skirt came high upon her thighs, revealingthe shapeliest leg I have seen this Christmas. I soon noticed that the buttonsdown her back had started to come undone, and allowed my free hand to wander inthe gap and stroke her flesh, which she appeared to enjoy . . . I can assureyou, my dear Ned, that the beating of my heart did not improve the quality of myreading. When the bell rang for supper, I was delighted to observe herreluctance in sitting up; she pretended this was because she had fallen asleep,but I, who could see the movements of her eyelids, knew better.‘On the following day, there was no further progress, since the ministerreturned our sleigh, and father and brother Moray took them out for a drive toshow them the view of the towers of Dunrobin Castle. But when I saw Fiona beforewe supped, she said: “We missed our reading today. You must read twice as muchtomorrow.” I pulled her close to me, and let my hand wander over her back. Sheasked what I was doing, and I said: “Seeing how many buttons are done up.”‘The next day, the Wednesday, was sunny and cold, and [Lord] Glenney was out allday calling on a retired lady about her sheep. When Jamie told me this news, Itold him I would sleep again and take my breakfast and hot water at ten. Shortlythereafter, as I stood in my nightshirt making my ablutions, Mary came in andasked if I would go with them through the empty rooms. Soon Fiona came seekingher, and both admired the material of the shirt, which was one of those I boughtin Strasbourg at the linen fair. Then Fiona told a story of a man­servant of heraunt, who was running about in his shirtsleeves preparing the table for guests.She told him to put on his coat, but he replied: “Indeed, my lady, there’s saemuckle rinnin’ here and there, I’m just distrackit, I hae cast off my coat andwaistcoat, and faith I dinna ken how lang I can bear my breeks.” We all laugheda great deal at this, and I noted with satisfaction that she regarded my stateof undress with no more embarrass­ment than Mary, which indicated that shethought of me as a brother. So before I put them out, that I might dress, Ipassed an arm around the waist of each of them and squeezed, and remarked thatFiona’s plumpness would keep a man warm with­out his nightshirt.‘I must not describe the morning in full, for this letter would become as longas a sermon by Warburton; so let me say only that we joked and laughed a greatdeal, and I took every oppor­tunity to chase them both, both to keep warm in theempty wing, and to accustom Fiona to my familiarity. It was, of course,necessary to devote much of my attention to Mary, to stimulate the sense ofrivalry between them and make Fiona accept my squeezes as natural. I met noresistance here, for both were full of high spirits. . . . You will take note ofthe lesson of all this, Ned, and incorporate it in your History. The situationhere reveals the truth of Lichtenberg’s assertion that the feelings enter intocombination like chemicals. Mary was my sister and took every opportunity toremind Fiona of this, as though I were on loan; Fiona accepted the loan and thebrotherly attentions that went with it. Since I was now licensed to treat Fionaas I would treat Mary, I had only to treat Mary with the familiarity I would useupon Fiona to make the whole thing appear natural.‘The advantage of this appeared later in the afternoon, when I went to theirroom to read Grandison. I knew they intended to try on the blue muslin dressesbefore they sewed on the tapes; so I went early. Fiona was still sewing herdress, but Mary stood in her chemise, trying on a whalebone corset. They askedme to give advice from the male point of view, which I did with pleasure, whilehelping Mary to tie the corset. I told them that in Paris, the women of thecourt often wore dresses that left their breasts completely exposed. Mary saidshe would not like that, and I slipped a hand into her chemise, and felt thetiny, hard breast that was barely formed, and said she would have reason toobject to such a fashion. At this she pulled the chemise off both shoulders,exposing both bosoms, and asked me if I did not think they would grow a greatdeal larger. She was not as inno­cent as she pretended; she wanted me to seethem, to prove she was not a child, and she knew I was curious. I pretended toconsider the question without prejudice, and told her that the relation of thesize of the nipple to the total circumference would give some idea of theirfuture development—upon which, I took one of the nipples between my fingers andbegan to pinch it. After a few moments, it became stiff; so did another earlyriser, and I was tempted to bend forward and take the other one between my lips;but I feared it might ruin the professorial air. . . . After this, I helped heron with the dress, and discoursed like a milliner on the relative virtues ofmetal or bone as a material for buttons, and of the advantages of loops overbuttonholes.‘By now, Fiona had laid down her needle, and I asked her if I could not help toundo her buttons, which this time were between her breasts. She seemed to beshy, but my faithful Mary rallied like a Hessian, and told her she would neveragain have such an expert lady’s maid, upon which, the girl entered into thespirit of the game and allowed me to undo her and pull the dress off hershoulders. This time I took no liberties with the delicious orbs that were nowexposed to my sight, for I sensed that Mary would be jealous; instead, I helpedher on with her blue dress, and took care to keep my front turned away fromthem, lest they should note the evidence of my absorption in my new trade.‘The maid came in to make up the fire, and I sat in a chair and pretended to beabsorbed in a book. But as soon as we were alone again, I suggested that wemight commence our reading before it became too dark (for it was now afterfour). Mary said they would change first, but I told her it was not worth thetrouble, and that in any case, they should learn whether the dresses wouldcrease. This reasoning convinced them, and they sat beside me on the rug. Assoon as I began to read, Mary again placed her head on my lap, and Fiona quicklyfollowed her lead. Both had placed themselves so that neither could see theother, and I took double precautions against peeping by resting the book againstMary’s head so it would fall down if she moved. You will observe that thismanoeuvre left both my hands free, although my position made any sudden movesimpossible. I slipped my left hand into the open back of Fiona’s dress, andallowed my right one to rest on Mary’s breast. I removed it to turn over a page,and replaced it inside the dress, upon her right bosom, and began to gentlypinch and tweak the nipple. After the next page, I moved it to her left, and didthe same there. From the increased force of her breathing I guessed that she wasbecoming somewhat less interested in the wearisome virtues of Sir CharlesGrandison. When I had finished tweaking the nipples, I gently stroked thebreasts, and observed with amusement the involuntary parting of her thighs.‘Absorbed for the moment in the pleasure I was so disinter­estedly bestowingupon Mary, I contented myself with a vague caressing of Fiona’s back. As it was,I felt like a juggler betwixt Grandison and my two winter flowers. But when Maryhad sunk into a trance of contentment, I began to consider the duties of myright hand. Since the dress was low cut, and the back was undone, it was noproblem to slip my hand under the armpit, and on to her right bosom. Themovements of her skin under my caress told me that this advance would not berejected. Indeed, she stretched like a cat, and made a single movement with herhips that made me fear that an unbidden guest would burst his flap and peep outto see what was happening. Her breasts were fuller and weightier than Mary’s,but the nipples were smaller, and when I began to pinch the right one, I couldonly judge the result from the increased rate at which her breath came and went.I found this so delightful that after a while, I moved my hand to her mouth, andpinched the lower lip, then played with it between my thumb and forefinger. Thenher lips closed around the finger, and she sucked it as if it were a comforter.When I tired of this, I slipped my hand into her bosom again, this time down thefront of the dress, and devoted some attention to the neglected breast.‘A log on the fire fell with a shower of sparks, and at the same time, the bookfell from off my legs. I was not entirely sorry, for the chair against which Iwas leaning had slipped, and I was becoming cramped. Fiona sat up and said shewould have to leave us for a moment. I was on the point of recommending the potunder the bed, but thought this would place too great a strain on her modesty,and so held my peace. This was something of a feat, for by now I was in such astate of eagerness that I could have driven my ardent Pegasus through a crack ina brick wall.‘When we were alone, I let my hand return within Mary’s dress; she covered itwith her own. I asked her if she liked me to do that, and she said it gave her apleasant feeling that was like icy water. The room was now dark except for thelight of the fire, and she had moved around to warm her shins. I was in such astate of impatience that I had almost ceased to calculate the consequences. Withone hand still pinching her breast, I leaned forward, pulled up her dress, andran my hand roughly over the inside of her thigh, then up to the source ofdelight. It was smooth and almost unprotected. I first pressed it with all myfingers; then, discovering it was warm and moist, allowed my middle finger totrace its course upward. She whispered, “Be careful, Fiona won’t be long”, and Iswear she must have read my mind, for I was about to move on her and findwhether the inner folds would welcome a larger guest. I knew her admonition wassensible, for the privy was only at the end of the passage. But I needed somefurther outlet, if I was to preserve my sanity; so I quickly undid the buttonsat the top of my flap, seized her hand, and pushed it inside. She knew what toexpect, since she had often seen it as a child, but must have been startled atits expansion. She sat up and peered at it by the light of the fire, payingparticular attention to the vermilion head, which she squeezed and prodded, andsmeared a little smooth moisture around in a circle. At that moment, we heardsteps outside, and I could have cursed Fiona and wished her in hell. When shecame in, we were both respectable again, and my heart was beating so loud that Iwas afraid she could hear it across the room.‘She sat down by my side, and said: “It’s too dark to read. Tell us aboutGöttingen.” “What would you like to know?” “Tell us again about the time thestudents fought the journey­men.” So with a few deeps breaths to master theracing of my pulse, I told them again the familiar old story. Mary stretched outher feet to the fire, and for a few minutes, I could think of nothing but thepleasant spot I had been exploring, and of how I could find an excuse to get heralone. But a few moments’ thought convinced me this was impracticable, so Idecided to see what advantage could be drawn from the present situation. Marywas lying as before, with her head against my thigh; Fiona, as before, curled upwith her cheek against my breeches, her dress pulled over her knees in front,but free of the back of her thighs. I caressed her breast, as before, then, whenI felt her responding, moved my hand down to her buttocks. This alarmed her fora moment, as I could tell, but as my hand rested there without movement, shegrew reassured, and I began stroking her side under the dress. Mary glancedacross once to see what we were about, but evidently decided it was no businessof hers, and from then on, kept her eyes turned to the other corner of the room.‘We all knew the bell would sound soon, and this added to our pleasure. When Isaid: “It will soon be time to sup”, Mary pressed herself tighter against me,and Fiona muttered impatiently. This decided me that it was time to pressforward; I let the hand on Fiona’s buttocks move down, and pull aside the clothof the dress. A moment later, my hand was resting on her bared behind,delighting in its softness and the gentleness of its curve. Indeed, it was sucha delight to touch that I could have kept on caressing it until the bell rang.But bethinking myself of my more serious business, I changed my positionslightly to extend my reach, and explored further. Her bent position made itimpractical to move around to the front of her thighs, but it meant she wasaccessible from my present position. Here, as in the case of the bosom, she wasmore developed than Mary, although the hair was soft as down. This new movementalarmed her and she jerked suddenly, so I removed my hand to soothe her. I wascertain by now that she must be aware of my state, for she could scarcelybelieve that the mound against which her cheek rested was a burglar’s jemmy. Oneof the buttons was only half done-up; it took but the slightest movement torelease it. I am certain she did not observe this. But I could tell from herstillness that she would not have me believe her offended, so I returned my handto its former position between her buttocks, and allowed it to rest there, thefinger tips pressing in unison. She stirred, then lay still. My voice had becometight, and I had no idea what I was babbling, but I was equally certain thatthey were also indifferent. I allowed my middle finger to probe. At first, I wasdisappointed, and believed myself mistaken about her; but after a moment, myfinger parted the fold, and I saw that her con­dition was much as Mary’s hadbeen a quarter of an hour earlier. The need for calm had so far reduced theviolence of my feelings that I was able to observe the different texture of thismoisture; that it was less plentiful, but more slippery, like the feel of amackerel as you take it off the hook.‘She was moving now, with small movements of her hips, and very cautiously, incase Mary looked round. I moved my lap, as if to ease cramp, and she raised hercheek for a moment. When she replaced it, I felt her hair against theimportunate nose of my charger. During this time, I had not forgotten tocontinue to pinch the tiny nipple under my other hand. Fiona moved again, and Ifelt her ear, then her bare cheek. She had moved her uppermost thigh to make myaccess more easy. I longed now for the feeling of her lips, for her head wasraised slightly.‘At this moment, the bell rang, and we all started as if it had been acannonshot. But I kept up my caressing, and the three of us were still,listening to the racket, and wishing the fellow dead. It stopped, and none of usmoved; neither did I now bother to speak. Then the tip of my finger found theentrance of the robber’s cave, and slipped within; at that moment, my suppressedfluids leapt upwards and bubbled forth. I doubt whether the two of them knew whyI tensed; but both of them lay still until it was over, while my spirit leapt upwith the sparks of the fire, and the moment of supreme guiltlessness convulsedme like the lightning.‘Mary was the first to sit up. She yawned, and stretched, and made as if she hadfallen into a doze. Then Fiona did the same, but cast a quick glance down to seethe source of the moisture that had bedewed her hair.‘I hurried down to table, buttoning as I went; and when my father enquired aboutthe two girls, I said I had not seen them, and sent Jamie up to call them. Theycame down wearing their other dresses, and apologising for falling asleep infront of the fire. Fiona sat next to me, and I looked with satisfaction at themoist place on her hair.‘And now, my dear friend, in closing this Grandisonian epistle, I must onceagain pay tribute to the inspired teaching that has led to these satisfactoryconclusions. The man who can spend two hours upon such a sweet pinnacle ofecstasy has experienced something of the state of the gods, and must becomelarger of soul thereby . . .’Glenney’s letter concludes with a page and a half of reflections of this sort—Ishall not quote them because their style is bom­bastic, and by no means up tothe standard of what went before—and the assurance that he will press hisadvantage, and attempt to complete the work he has begun. That he wasunsuccessful appears from a letter he wrote the following June, in which hecongratulates himself on not having accomplished his design, ‘for the thought ofthe complications that might have ensued makes me sweat and shake with ague’. Hewas not, I think, referring to the possibility of the girls becoming pregnant,but simply to the personal complications involved in being the lover of totallyunsophisticated girls. He eventually became Fiona’s lover in 1768, two yearslater, and Mary’s in 1775, as we shall see. I have quoted the above passage at such length because it makes certain thingsclear. First, the reference to ‘inspired teaching’ indicates that in matterssuch as these, Glenney regarded himself as Esmond’s pupil. Can one, in fact,accept everything he has written about that afternoon of January 2, 1767? My ownin­clination was at first to dismiss much of it as wishful thinking,particularly as the whole development of the passage indicates the influence ofCleland and Crébillon fils. But then, Glenney was not a particularly clever man;even some of the felicities of the above letter are borrowed from Esmond. Onemight say, in fact, that the chief interest of this letter is that it revealshow far Horace Glenney had taken on the stamp of Esmond’s personality. In manyways, it might have been written by Esmond. No, I think that what had happenedhere is altogether more interesting. Like most young noblemen of his time,Glenney was thoroughly licentious from an early age—he mentions elsewhere thathe was first seduced by a farmer’s wife at the age of eleven, and that atthirteen he had a bad week when another girl’s menstrual period was late. But hewas licentious in a stolid, unimaginative sort of way, pinching the bottoms ofchambermaids, boorish and clumsy with girls of his own class, completelytongue-tied with women he really admired. He was bullied and then patronised byhis father, and was in awe of his elder brother (who died in 1770 of biliousfever, after a three-day drinking bout on brandy and madeira). He hardly knewhis mother, who had separated from his father ten years earlier because he beather with a riding crop. Horace Glenney was an emotionally retarded countrybumpkin. Then he met the brilliant Esmond, who might have been twenty years hissenior as far as maturity went. I do not think that Horace Glenney washomosexual, but I think the only adequate way of expressing what happened atGöttingen is to say that he fell in love with Esmond. He picked up his ideas,his mannerisms, his literary style, his preoccupations. It was as if Esmond wasa wizard, and Glenney the sorcerer’s apprentice. Women sighed and yielded as ifby magic. There was an amazing quality of a daydream-come-true about it all. Hereturned to Golspie House, and girls treated him like a hero back from the wars.But although he was four hundred miles or so from the beloved, he lived andthought as though they were still in Göttingen together. Instead of sleepingwith every girl in sight, he imposes a discipline upon himself, studies hisHorace and Aristotle, and then decides upon a ‘sentimental’—that is, an elevatedand rather detached—relation with his sister’s pretty girlfriend—in doing whichhe is anticipat­ing Novalis, Poe, Dowson, and various other romantics who fellin love with children. Inspired by his ideals, he rises above his normallimitations. And then—proof that the gods are still with him, that the magic isworking as infallibly as ever—he realises that these two admire him as much asMaggie McBean and the other farmgirls, and that he can play with fire to hisheart’s content. The daydream remains unbroken. He has absolutely no sexualinterest in his sister; he knows her too well. But like leaves, they fall intothe whirlpool of the daydream, and from his god­like eminence, he can choosewhat to do. How shall the dream finish? Shall he pluck the maidenheads like twoblackberries, exercise his droit de seigneur? He hesitated; there can be nodoubt he would have succeeded if he had really wanted to. It was sensible of hisfather to put the girls in the same bed; time sped by, and in mid-January he setout on the return journey to Göttingen, taking the long and arduous route viaLondon, in order to travel with Esmond, rather than the much shorter route fromDundee to Cuxhaven. It is also interesting that the only occasion when Glenneyagain invited Esmond back to Golspie for Christmas was in 1770, when Mary wasstaying with friends in Brighton. For Mary and Fiona, Horace was still ‘thedistant beloved’, and he was not going to make the mistake of allowing them tomeet the original mould from which he was cast.As it is, one can gather from the length and detail of this letter the burstingpride that Glenney felt as he made his report to his teacher. He had been alone,with no one to advise him, and he had passed the test with top marks . . .Let me admit that my first response to Glenney’s letters was unsympathetic, andthat my feelings about Donelly experienced another fluctuation downward. But itis necessary to explain that I was not disapproving on moral grounds—as anyreader of the Sex Diary will know. Like Donelly, I have always been fascinatedby the problem of sex because it seems to hold the key to the secrets of a moreintense consciousness. I have always been obsessed by the way that sexualexperience seems to slip through the fingers like fairy gold. And I must repeathere a number of key experiences that seem to me to hold an important clue tothe mystery.In 1955, I had spent an afternoon in bed with a girl named Caroline, a dramastudent I had met through Gertrude Quincey. I have never understood why, butCaroline was one of those girls who produce in me a curiously intense level oflust, of purely physical desire. She once told me that when I made love to her,she sometimes pretended she was being raped, and that it increased the pleasure.This made me realise that, almost uncon­sciously, I was pretending that I wasraping her, treating her purely as a hungry man would treat a tender steak,absorbing and devouring with a ravenous appetite. On this particular afternoon,I had made love to her a great many times—seven or eight. It was like a game. Onone occasion I came back from the bathroom and she was sitting in her panties,trying to hook her bra; I threw her back on her bed, pulled aside the leg of thepanties, and entered her with almost a single movement; and again later, whenshe was fully dressed and ready to go, made love to her against the door. Therewas always an element of shock, of suddenness, in our coming together.Afterwards, I felt completely exhausted, blissfully relaxed, as if I had drainedoff every ounce of sexual desire, and could turn my mind to more importantthings. Then I went outside to get the milk off the doorstep. I lived in abasement flat, and a girl walked past the area railings, so close that I got aglimpse above the tops of her stockings. It was like a kick in the stomach. Irealised with a shock that my sexual desire had not been drained; only myimmediate curiosity about Caroline. The well was appar­ently bottomless.The same realisation came some months later, when I was on my way to spend thenight with Caroline—who was by this time sharing a flat with a girlfriend. Icalled in at a ladies’ shop to buy her a pair of stockings. Behind me, as Istood at the counter, there were a number of those cubicles in which women tryon dresses. I turned casually, and saw that a woman was in one of the cubicles,her back to me, without a skirt or underskirt. Again, there was the shock oftremendous desire. Yet the woman was middle-aged, as I saw when she turned;under ordinary circum­stances, I would not have given her a second glance.Leaving the shop, I was uncomfortably aware that my night with Caroline wouldnot touch this depth of sexual response.This led me to formulate the notion that sexual perversions are an attempt toescape this oddly unsatisfying element in the normal sexual act. It is thesituation of the normal sexual act that produces the disappointment. (There isthe story of the psychiatrist who advised an impotent man to try self-hypnosis;before he got into bed, he was to close his eyes and repeat over and over again:‘She is not my wife, she is not my wife . . .’) All forms of perversion consistin adding an element of the forbidden to the normal situation: the girl has towalk up and down in black stockings, and so on. Colonel Donelly’s story aboutbeing whipped by the governess makes the same point. This is a rather gloomyview of the nature of the sexual impulse, since anything ceases to be forbiddenonce you can persuade someone else to participate in the daydream. Sex becomesthe pursuit of an ever-receding goal. . . .In Dublin five years ago, a minor occurrence modified this view. I was walkinginto the library of Trinity College when I met a girl coming out; she waswearing white stockings, and something about her face produced an intense shock.I had never seen her before, and I tried for ten minutes to place her. Then Iremembered: she reminded me of a girl called Hazel who used to nurse meoccasionally as a child. She was a pretty girl, who was ten or eleven when I wasfour or five. I looked upon her as a kind of extra mother; I was never so happyas when she was caressing me or changing my clothes or helping me to put on myshoes. By the time I was ten, she was married. I knew about the physical detailsof the sexual act, and it seemed horribly exciting and wicked. One day, I sawHazel in the grocer’s, looking as pretty as ever, wearing a black skirt andwhite stockings. The thought that her husband had the right to raise this skirtand remove her stockings suddenly filled me with an anguished jealousy. Ithought of the things they must do in the dark, and I looked hard at her face,thinking that it must have left some sign—of dreamy ecstasy, or perhaps ofwickedness. I imagined that their life, when he came home from work, must be onelong, gloating orgy. Yet she looked perfectly ordinary, just I had always knownher, perhaps a little thinner, without the pink bloom. . . .And the thought of Hazel—whom I had forgotten for fifteen years or more—broughtback memories of other girls I had admired when I was very young: a girl wholived two doors away who seemed to me a saint; a girl in the next street, whoseoval face struck me as the most beautiful thing I had seen; a maternal aunt, notmuch older than Hazel, who sometimes took me to the pictures and then out totea. . . . It came as a shock to remember how many of these girls—all older thanmyself—I had regarded as goddesses. It had never struck me before that I spentmy childhood in a kind of matriarchal society, surrounded by women whom Iworshipped, from whom all I asked was a smile, a caress. For in my teens, Ithought of women as desirable creatures who had the whip-hand over man becauseof the treasure between their thighs, which they could withhold or bestow atwill. It was man’s job to get the treasure, by persua­sion, trickery orviolence. . . . And from then on, I devoted myself to the usual male task ofransacking as many treasure chests as possible; they were the prey, I thehunter. Yet the tendency to idealise them remained strong, and seemed tocontradict the philosophy of the sex war. Now I understood. The sex war wasnonsense. What I wanted from women was still what I had wanted from Hazel—theelder-sisterly compassion and tender­ness, the caresses, the attention,producing an immediate sense of security and self-confidence. I had oftenobserved the feeling of peace that comes as the penis passes that ring of muscleat the mouth of the vagina, and slips into the warm, caressing inner folds. NowI saw that this was simply the ultimate caress. In a moment of affection, Hazelmight reach out and touch my cheek gently, or rest her hand on my head, and Iwould experience an immediate flow of satisfaction. The peace of entering awoman’s body was an intensified version of this; it is a caress, a gesture oftenderness, but she is caressing the most intimate part of your body with themost intimate part of hers. The aggressiveness that Lawrence called ‘the sexwar’ develops from the starvation of this need, just as criminality may developfrom poverty. Even the Casanova obsession can be explained in thisway—particularly the type of Casanova who wants to keep his women totallyfaith­ful to him, while he is allowed to do as he likes. It is the desire forthe total assurance of female love and approval. All the women in the world lovehim; they are all willing to give him their love; even the knowledge that he isin bed with someone else makes no difference. . . .All this led me to recognise why I have lost interest in the sex war in the lastfew years. In Diana and Mopsy, I have a two-woman admiration society; the hungerfor security has been fed until it is drowsy. The kind of self-confidence thatis the gift of women has been achieved, and I can devote my full attention tomore serious matters, to questions of philosophy and human evolution.All this explains my impatience with Horace Glenney, and with what I supposed tobe Esmond Donelly’s philosophy of libertinism. I felt that it indicated eitherunfulfilment or im­maturity: the small boy’s desire for security. It was notthis particular episode—of Fiona and Mary—that irritated me, because Iappreciated that it was uncalculated; he wanted a ‘sentimental’ relation, and itturned into a sexual one. But other letters indicated that he was capable of acoarser approach. For example, in the Christmas of the following year, hereturned home via a northern route, sailing from Amsterdam to Grimsby, anddecided to spend a few days at Osnabrück, looking at the cathedral and thecastle. The inn was crowded, and Glenney was placed in an upstairs room over awashhouse, which he shared with his manservant, a cockney named Doggett. Sometime after midnight, he went downstairs to relieve himself, then stood for awhile with his back against the wall of the washhouse, which was warm. As hestood there, a girl came out of the inn and went into the washhouse; once inthere, she undressed, ladled warm water into a basin, and washed herself, whileGlenney peeped in at the window. Then she dressed, and went to bed in anotherroom of the same building. Glenney was about to follow her, when he heard aman’s voice, which seemed to come from her room. The next morning, he toldDoggett to find out all he could about the girl, and whether she would beavailable that night. Doggett came back some hours later and told him that shewas a respectable girl, a niece of the innkeeper, and that she was engaged to acarpenter’s assistant. She could not marry him because his master refusedpermission. The innkeeper had flatly refused to lend the man enough money to setup in business on his own. Glenney reasoned that it was probably thisapprentice’s voice he had heard coming from her room the night before; hedecided to abandon the idea of sleeping with her.Later in the day, Doggett told Glenney that he had heard a rumour that the girlwas pregnant—she had spells of sickness during her work. Glenney scented a newapproach. He told Doggett to try to get into her confidence, and find out howmuch money her lover would need to set up his own shop. ‘I would have given athousand guineas for the pleasure of leaving one lot of life-fluid in thatvirtuous little womb.’ But it turned out that her lover could set up in businesson a far smaller sum than this, a hundred and seventy-five thalers, theequivalent of about twenty-five guineas. Doggett told her that his master had akind heart and might be worth approaching—these English milords were extravagantand rash. Accordingly, the girl knocked timidly on Glenney’s door in the lateafternoon, and was told to come in. She made her speech about her lover’s needfor money, about how he would repay it, and so on. Glenney opened his purse andshook out a pile of gold pieces. Then, as the girl’s eyes were riveted on these,he took her round the waist, and whispered that she could earn the money for herlover very easily. She tried to break away and leave the room, and he told herthat he knew she was pregnant. This upset her; she hesitated; Glenney pointed tothe money, and whispered that no one would ever know. It would only take fiveminutes. And she would live happily ever after. . . . She allowed him to kissher, and caress her breast. She closed her eyes, and had evidently decided thatit was worth it, when they heard someone calling her. She broke away; Glenneytook the money and pressed it into her hand, then kissed her again. She hurriedaway.That evening, she waited at table. He caught her eye twice, and she blushed. Sheowed him her body. Glenney knew there was no danger of her returning his money;Doggett found out she had been to see her lover early in the evening; she hadundoubtedly taken him the money.That night, Glenney waited until he heard her cross the yard and go into thewashhouse. This time, she only undressed to her chemise. Glenney opened the doorand slipped in. She looked terrified, and begged him to leave. She explained ina whisper that ‘he’ was waiting in her room. Glenney whispered that this wouldnot take a moment. He spent a few minutes pacifying her, persuading her to bequiet. Then he unbuttoned his trousers, pressed her back against the copper, andpossessed her there and then. After this, he whispered that if she wantedanother twenty-five guineas to set up house, she should come to his room thenext day. Then he dressed and left her.He was furious when she did not avail herself of his invitation. He met her oncein a corridor and looked at her questioningly; she shook her head and hurriedaway. Doggett had no success in persuading her either. She had kept her part ofthe bargain, but to Glenney it seemed the height of unreasonableness that shehad given herself to him once, and now withheld herself. ‘I would have spentevery guinea I possessed for a night in bed with the virtuous little devil.’ Hetold Doggett to try black­mailing her by threatening to tell her lover, andthen, when this didn’t work, contemplated kidnapping her and carrying her off ina coach. But the girl had had enough; that night, she vanished. Presumably shejoined her lover, who was now inde­pendent of his master. In a very bad temper,Glenney took coach for Amsterdam, and consoled himself with the thought that‘that five minutes against the copper was worth twenty-five guineas of anybody’smoney’. The whole episode has a rather nasty flavour. He had seen her undressedand he wanted to have her; the dis­covery that she was in trouble only added tohis determination. He could have waited, and got her to come to his room thenext day; she was obviously prepared to keep her side of the bargain. But itwould be more piquant to possess her in the circumstances in which he had firstdecided to have her—particularly as her lover was waiting in her room. It isinteresting to note his use of the word ‘virtuous’. The girl was not virtuous,for she was pregnant. But it was this vision of her that made him want her:respectable, virtuous, in love with someone else. How appropriate to hoist upher chemise and fuck her against the copper, with his trousers around hisankles! But having done it, he wants to occupy the conquered territory, repeatthe whole pleasurable business. He would not normally try blackmailing a girlinto bed, or think of abducting her in a carriage; but this ‘virtuous’ girlproduces a desire to conquer, to degrade; even when he is finally frustrated, hedwells on the thought that she has been had by him; if she remains faithful forthe rest of her life, nothing can take that away. It is the coarsest kind ofmasculine sadism that informs the whole episode. But Glenney describes it in hisletter to Donelly as if certain of his approval. My own feeling was that ifDonelly did not find the whole business as unpleasant as I had, then he was asbad as Glenney. They were just a pair of dirty-minded rakes. But since I hadnone of Donelly’s letters, I had no way of knowing his reaction to HoraceGlenney’s revelations. For the next ten days, my ‘quest’ for Donelly marked time. I must confess to anappalling laziness, or, rather, to a perverse disinclination to occupy myenergies upon any task for which I am being paid. I felt as if reading thevarious letters and docu­ments borrowed from the Misses Donelly was a kind ofhome­work, and I resented it. Instead, I filled page after page of my journals,on topics relating to phenomenology, and studied Witt­genstein, whose Zettel hadjust arrived from Blackwells.Then several things happened at once. The Irish Times pub­lished my letterappealing for material about Donelly; two days later, The Times LiterarySupplement printed the letter I had written from London. Klaus Dunkelman finallywrote me an apologetic letter from Hampstead, explaining that my letter to himhad not been forwarded, but had been left lying on the hall table at his oldaddress, where it was accidentally noticed by a friend. A Mr W.S.K. Aldrich ofCork wrote to say that he had been a friend of the late Jane Aston, who died in1949, and had various letters in Donelly’s handwriting. He was not sure what hadbecome of them. Finally, Clive M. Bates, the grandson of Isaac Jenkinson Bates,wrote to me from Dublin to say that his grandfather had been ill, but that if Ihappened to be in Dublin, he would be happy to see me. He added that hisgrandfather was delighted that I concurred with his views on the Ireland’s Eyemurder, and would like to discuss it in person. A postscript added: ‘I have seenyour letter in today’s Irish Times. I may be able to offer a few suggestions.’The cautious wording of this last sentence excited me. He could not even bringhimself to mention Donelly. It seemed to indicate that he almost certainly knewsomething: too much even to trust himself to hint at it.Klaus Dunkelman’s letter was very long, and discussed my books at length. Butits references to Donelly were brief. He said that he had heard the namementioned by Otto Körner, the disciple of Wilhelm Reich, who spoke of Donelly asbeing one of the first writers to note the importance of the orgasm forpsycho­logical health. However, said Dunkelman, he was unfortunately unable tooffer me more details, since he had now severed con­nection with Körner. As faras he knew, Körner was now back in Germany. My inclination was to hurry to Dublin to see Clive Bates; but there was too muchelse to be done, and besides, haste might spoil everything. So I wrote him anon-committal letter, talking about my project of a biographical introduction toa book of Donelly’s journals, and adding that I hoped to see him some time soon.Then I turned to the matter of tracking down the Donelly letters that hadbelonged to Jane Aston—although with­out much enthusiasm. No doubt they would beDonelly’s letters on the subject of Jortin, Tillotson and other sleep-inducingsermonisers. I drove to Cork and interviewed Mr Aldrich, who was able to tell methat Jane Aston had relatives at Belgooly, near Kinsale. I drove there anddiscovered that they had gone to Cork for a day’s shopping. So I went to Kinsaleand booked a room in a hotel, then called back on Mr Philip Aston—a retiredcoastguard—at seven in the evening. It proved to be a wasted trip: he knewnothing of Donelly letters; but he gave me the address of Fr Bernard Aston ofLimerick. I called on him the next day, on my way back to Galway. He had heardof the Donelly papers, but had no idea what had happened to them. He suggestedthat I contact Jane Aston’s doctor, George O’Hefernan, of Cork, who knew herwell. (A slight droop of the eyelids hinted that the relationship was closerthan he could approve.)I was beginning to get a Kafka-ish sensation of being directed from one officeto another and never getting any nearer the objective; I was tempted to give up.I wanted to quote half a page of Donelly on the subject of sin and redemption;but it began to seem more trouble than it was worth. When I got home, fortifiedby a good-size glass of claret, I rang directory enquiries in Cork and asked forthe number of Dr O’Hefernan. They said there was only one listed, but he wasex-directory. With a sinking feeling, I asked if I could be put on to thesuperintendent. Then I took another long drink. A man came on the line,explained the superintendent was away at the moment, and asked if he could help.I knew it would be impossible to persuade them to give me the number, but hopedit might be possible to get the superintendent to ring Dr O’Hefernan and ask ifhe would speak to me. Ireland is an easygoing, obliging sort of country. So Iexplained my business—that I was a writer, that I wanted to trace certaindocuments, and that I thought Dr O’Hefernan might be able to help me. Thegentleman on the other end asked me to hang on; ten minutes later, he returned,and told me that the O’Hefernan in question was not listed as a doctor. Ithanked him and hung up; that seemed to be the end of the trail.But a couple of hours later, as I was dozing and listening to The Pirates ofPenzance, the telephone rang. Diana took the call, and told me the Corksuperintendent wanted to speak to me. It was the same man. He had looked throughold listings and found Dr O’Hefernan, and then somehow managed to trace him forme. The address was in Killarney. I thanked him effusively, and took his nameand address so that I could send him a copy of one of my books. Then, althoughit was now after ten, I got through to Dr O’Hefernan’s number. I told him myname, and explained I was a writer. He immediately became very friendly, andtold me he had published a few books himself. He had never heard of me; but whenI brought up the subject of Esmond Donelly, he recalled that he had seen myletter in the Irish Times, and had been meaning to write to me. Yes indeed, hehad a large number of Donelly’s letters, as well as some other papers, and Iwould be most welcome to examine them at any time that would be convenient tome. I fixed on the next day.There is no space here to describe the twenty-four hours I spent with GeorgeO’Hefernan, although it certainly deserves description. A short, stockily builtman with rosy cheeks, white hair and a white moustache, he was one of thosepeople who seem to have been born happy and full of interest in everything thathappens. He presented me with copies of his books, Clonmacnoise and Other Poems,Mangan and his Circle and Memoirs of an Irish Rebel, as well as his volume oftranslations from the Gaelic. He had known Yeats well, spent many evenings withJoyce in Paris, and been a drinking companion of Gogarty; I made a note of hisstories in my journal, for the versions in Memoirs of an Irish Rebel are a greatdeal tamer and less Rabelaisian than the versions he told me. The doctor was thesoul of hospitality; he invited a dozen friends in for dinner, and we consumedseveral gallons of home-made ale as well as a great deal of Jameson’s. In theearly hours of the morning, when the last of his guests had wandered unsteadilytowards his car, he told me the story of his association with Mrs Aston duringthe last twenty years of her life—she died at forty-eight of pneumonia. Finally,he took me to a great floor-to-ceiling cupboard in the spare bedroom—where I wasto sleep—and showed me piles of rolled manuscripts, letters tied in bundles andheavy black folders. ‘You’ll find plenty of Donelly’s stuff among that lot’, hesaid, and left me to look through it. It was 4 a.m., and the room was chilly inspite of a single-bar electric fire. I had drunk too much, and had a slightheadache. But I started pulling papers out of the cupboard on the off chance ofseeing Esmond’s hand­writing. After disturbing a few spiders and a quantity ofdust, I found a bundle of letters addressed to William Aston. I had now clearedout most of the bottom shelf of the cupboard. In the corner, at the back, therewere two black-bound volumes. I pulled these out and glanced into one of them;the handwriting was Esmond’s. I glanced at the front page; it started halfwaythrough a paragraph. I opened the other volume. It consisted of octavo-sizedpages that had been bound together; the opening page read: ‘October 11, 1764. Ihave often determined that I should keep a journal in which I would record myeveryday doings, but have so far failed to hold to the intention. I have lostrecollection of so many interesting events that I have at last determined tocarry this resolution into effect, whatever the cost in labour or candles. . ..’I undressed, pulled on my pyjamas, and clambered into bed, no longer interestedin sleep. In 1764, Esmond was just sixteen years of age. This journal wastherefore the earliest of his writings that I had seen so far. The handwritingwas neater and easier to read than in the later journal. My feeling of triumphwas so strong that I was tempted to rush along to Dr O’Hefernan’s bedroom andshow him. It was only my suspicion that he shared it with the plump young womanwho kept house for him that made me restrain myself. What surprised me was thatO’Hefernan had not mentioned these journals. He told me that he knew there wereletters from Donelly, but that was all. The inference was that he did not knowof their existence. And when I asked him the next morning, he confirmed this.The journals of an Anglicised Protestant Irishman of the eighteenth century heldno interest for him, for he was a Catholic and a patriot, and his feelings aboutCromwell were more violent than most English­men’s about Hitler.I read until dawn, slept for about three hours, until the housekeeper woke mewith tea, then pulled on my overcoat over my pyjamas and went back to thecupboard. Within half an hour, I had sorted out three more bundles of lettersand two more bound journals, as well as the manuscript of his Travel Diary. WhenDr O’Hefernan came in to tell me breakfast was on the table, he found mesurrounded by papers and covered with dust, sitting opposite an empty cupboard.When I showed him the journals, he smiled and said: ‘Good. I’m glad you didn’thave the trip for nothing.’ I took the opportunity to ask the question that hadbeen on my mind all night. ‘Do you mean I can make use of all this material?’‘Sure. Why shouldn’t you?’ ‘Would you prefer me to work here, or could I borrowit?’ ‘Oh, which­ever you like. Come on down now and eat something.’ And hepadded off in his slippers and dressing-gown, while I sat there chortling like amadman. And I must confess that as I studied the journal, I began to regret that I hadaccepted Fleisher’s contract. Fifteen thousand dollars had seemed a magnificentsum at the time; but with all this material at my disposal, I felt I deserved agreat deal more. For the new journal removed the last of my doubts aboutDonelly’s intellectual stature. It showed me why Horace Glenney admired him somuch. He was a man who was obsessed by the elusive nature of human experience.But let him speak for himself: My cousin Frances tells me I have too good a conceit of myself, but I callheaven to witness that this is untrue. I am often the most wretched andself-derogatory creature under the sun, and my dissatisfaction often reaches apitch where it would be a temptation to blow out my brains. I am writing thisjournal that I might attempt to introduce some kind of order and continuity intomy life, for I am heartily sick of my own disapprobation. Women do oftencomplain that men lack constancy; but why should we have constancy in love whenwe have none in any other form of thought, feel­ing or desire? Yesterday, thefamous Doctor Gillis preached at our church, and I was greatly moved, and sworethat I would in future alter my life according to his recommenda­tions, and liveonly by the approval of my conscience and sense of virtue. But today it is toowindy and cold to venture outdoors, and this morning I read the fables ofGellert in the German for an hour before my usual distemper over­came me, and Ibecame sunk in a monstrous lassitude. Since then, I can see no way in which myconscience or sense of virtue can operate upon this life-consuming weari­ness.My conscience may tell me how to avoid doing wrong, but it cannot tell me how toescape tedium. And is there anything deadlier for a creature made in God’slikeness than this same tedium? For God is God because he can create; so a mancrushed by tedium is most un-Godlike.Dr Gillis made a most ingenious comparison between the body and the mind, sayingthat the body has its own system for disposing of injurious or pestilenthumours, whether natural or the product of sickness, whereas the mind has none.If I have a boil, it will discharge of itself; if I am costive, a green applewill loosen the obstruction; but if I am full of bile or envy, no purgative willserve; either I must give expression to my animus, or withdraw it by an act ofcontrition. There is no natural channel; it must be, like Macduff, ‘from itsmother’s womb untimely ripped’. And is this not even more true of this toediumvitae that stifles me? It is a constipation of the soul, a boil that refuses todischarge.I know that I cannot be happy without a feeling that my activity is directed tosome purpose, but I know not how to imbue my soul with purpose. Half an hour agoI took up Thomson’s Winter and read: Thro’ the hush’d air the whitening shower descends,At first thin wavering; till at last the flakesFall broad and wide, and fast, dimming the dayWith a continual flow. The cherish’d fieldsPut on their winter robes of purest white.’Tis brightness all, save where the new snow meltsAlong the mazy current . . . Why do these words cause a peace like falling snow to descend upon my senses? Isthere not within me some appetite for sublimity that is now choked by weariness,as my belly’s hunger is blunted and made sickly if I eat too many sweet cakes?And is this appetite not arous’d from its slumber by the memory of winterfields? And also by the sound of the clash of swords in Ossian? And also by thebouncing of a soft bosom when a girl runs upstairs? Why do we not possess a rodto strike the rock of the soul, and make a spring gush forth? Esmond has here sounded the fundamental theme of the journal: what we would nowcall the hidden powers of the sub­conscious. It obsesses him; he returns to itagain and again. ‘The powers of Nature surround us all the time; the mightyrushing of the torrent, the cannonades of the wind; the very stars dance throughthe heavens to tell us that nothing in the world stands still except the soul ofa wretch who knows only disquiet and self-reproach.’ He asks repeatedly whyman’s intelligence should exclude him from the life of the universe, andspeculates whether this is the meaning of the story of Adam and Eve: thatknow­ledge itself, the ability to think, was that which separated man from God.Even at sixteen, Donelly shows a remarkably wide acquaintance with theeighteenth-century divines, and even quotes George Herbert. And then, on page 48of volume one—dated a week before Christmas—the tone changes. I suspect he hadre-read his sentence about the ‘rod to strike the rock of the soul and make aspring gush forth’, for he speaks again of bouncing bosoms. The bosoms he had inmind were those of his cousin Sophia, who was staying with them for the holiday,together with her mother and father. Sophia Montagu, a cousin of ElizabethMontagu (one of the original ‘blue stockings’), became a noted beauty of theperiod, and even at this time—when she was barely nineteen—she had attracted agreat deal of attention when staying at the Mayfair home of the famous hostess.Esmond was a good-looking boy, but she probably thought of him as anunsophisticated country cousin. Esmond was analytical enough to know he was notin love with her, for he wrote: ‘S is a fool, but a beautiful fool who has manypoints of resemblance to a goddess.’ And later: ‘Sophia told me that she hadheard Mr Boswell argue with Dr Johnson in favour of polygamy, and that MrsMontagu replied that there was no woman alive with so little judgement as towant more than one husband at a time.’ Boswell’s idea took root; so didRousseau’s Nouvelle Héloïse, which he read in French, and Richardson’s ClarissaHarlowe. In Rousseau’s novel, the heroine Julie and her tutor Saint-Preux becomelovers, and Rousseau argues that this is right and natural between two peoplewho love one another and are prevented by circumstances from marrying.Richardson’s novel is moral by comparison: an account of the abduction and rapeof the virtuous Clarissa by the rake Lovelace; Clarissa dies of mortification,and Lovelace is killed in a duel. Esmond heaps mockery on Richardson in the nameof Rousseau. Why should a girl go into a decline because a man has donesomething that is perfectly natural? The presence of his pretty cousin kept thesubject of sexual intercourse to the forefront of his mind, and in a short timehe is expressing views that made him decide to keep his diary a secret. Likemany other critics, he suspected that Richardson’s attitude to the rape ofClarissa was not one of horrified disapproval, but of vicarious pleasure. ‘Forwho would not enjoy ravishing a beautiful girl, especially if she wereuncon­scious and know nothing of it.’ He asks why Richardson allows Clarissa tobe ravished when she is drugged, instead of in the manner of Lucrece, andanswers: ‘If the girl is too virtuous to surrender her body in any other way,then Lovelace is right to adopt this course. The girl’s beauty, like that ofcertain tropical birds, is intended to allure the male sex; why should shecomplain if she is too successful? She complains because her aim is to get ahusband in exchange for her virtue. But supposing the prospec­tive husband findsher a fool and has no wish to devote his life to her support? Is he bound by hishonour to foreswear the pursuit? Why should he not try to pluck the flowerinstead of buying the whole garden?’It is interesting to observe that he does not actually answer the question ofwhy Richardson preferred to have Clarissa un­conscious when she is raped. But itcontinues to trouble him. He asks: ‘Is it not because the man’s sense ofobligation lessens his pleasure? Would it not destroy my pleasure in a bottle ofwine if I knew I had to pay fifty pounds for it tomorrow?’ He goes on to discussBoswell’s idea of polygamy, and asserts that this is only another expression ofthe male’s natural desire to pay homage by ‘pouring a libation ofprocreation-juice into its proper orifice’.The interest in Sophia came to nothing; but at least it served to start Esmondthinking about sex. This leads him to give a full and interesting account of hissexual experiences so far. They had taken place only six months before; the girlwas a lady’s maid his elder sister, Judith, had brought back from Lyons. Hecalls her Minou, although apparently her real name was Marie: When I returned from Dublin, Judith had been home about six weeks. At first, Ipaid Minou no attention, finding her face somewhat plain; her chin was toolarge, and she had a nose like a button. But on the second day after my return,as I lay upon the newly scythed grass near the edge of the stream, I heard herlaughing and saying: ‘No, no, this is not the place’, and a man’s voice mockingher accent: ‘No, thees ees goot place.’ It was Shawn Rafferty, who tends thehorses and helps with the garden, a great hulking lubber whose right cheek isscarred by the kick of a foaling mare. His trousers and waistcoat never fit him,for they are the cast-offs of his elder brother, who is six inches shorter. Iwas unable to see either of them, for they were lying in the long grass under anapple tree. After a few minutes of silence, she said again: ‘No, not here.’‘Come to the barn then.’ ‘No, I cannot. I must go back to help with the tea.’(Judith has afternoon tea, a custom she picked up abroad.) But I heard herpromise to return to the barn after tea; then she stood up, brushed her dresswith her hands, and hurried away. Shawn Rafferty got up, tied his trousers atthe waist with a piece of rope, and went off towards the barn.I knew Shawn’s reputation among the village girls, although I had never beenable to understand it, for his scar and the wall eye give him a most formidableappearance. My sisters call him the Cyclops. But now I was all agog withcuriosity to know what he intended to do with her, although it was not difficultto guess. I had watched him guiding the erect organ of an impatient stallioninto a mare, and I had no doubt that he was well versed in the use and controlof his own machine. But I knew nothing of the coupling of man and woman; and Inow decided that, should the opportunity present itself, I would remedy thisdefect in my education. I thereupon betook myself to the hay barn—for I guessedthis was the one he meant—and climbed up into the loft, among the bean sacks andbales of fodder. All the floor had been covered with the hay, and the smell wasmost delicious. It was my guess that they purposed to enjoy their union uponthis natural carpet; but in case he should take it into his head to look aloft,I hid myself behind the sacks in the corner.Half an hour later, Shawn came in and began turning the hay with a fork; I couldnot see him, but I knew him by his voice as he sang ‘Molly Malone’. Then he cameup to the loft, bringing great armfuls of hay, which he scat­tered and spread onthe floor within a few yards of where I lay. From this I guessed they intendedto hold their nuptials up here, and not, as I had supposed, down below.A few minutes later, Minou came in, and for a while there was no sound. I raisedmyself to my knees and peeped out over the sacks; they were standing near thedoor, and she had her arms round his neck. Then they talked in whis­pers, and hepointed to the ladder; I lay down and closed my eyes, so that they might thinkme asleep in case they came upon me. He came up first, then turned and helpedher off the ladder, which stretched beyond the platform. The light was poor, butI could see them well enough. He stood with his back to the wall, and she flungher arms round his neck, and gave him a long kiss. Then she took one hand away,and reached down to the rope, which she untied with one pull. His trousers felldown to his knees, revealing enormous and hairy buttocks that were turnedtowards me. Her hand moved around between them and I could only guess what itwas doing. Then she suddenly dropped to her knees before him, and her facedisappeared behind the curve of his thigh. I saw his hands take hold of herhead, and his buttocks begin to move. Then he said: ‘Ah, stop it or I shall losethe best of it’, and they stayed like that a moment more, neither of themmoving. While she crouched there, he fumbled with the back of her dress; thenshe stood up, and he raised it from the floor, while she held up her arms asthough he were a lady’s maid, allowing him to draw it upwards. He took it off,and laid it carefully upon the floor; and as he turned sideways, I saw hisinstru­ment of love standing like a maypole, and swaying as he moved. It was notas big as that of the stallion, but it was one of the largest I had ever clappedeyes upon. Meanwhile, as he lifted her chemise, I was able to see her figure,which was so sweetly rounded that I could not believe it belonged to theuninviting face. As she stood there, her arms pinioned above her head by thechemise, he bent his head and brought his mouth down to her breast, which heworried between his lips, while her hands closed over the pole that prodded herbelly—its length being ample to accommodate both of them. Then he pulled off thechemise and tossed it on the floor, and they both sank down upon the hay. Iraised my face above the sacks, but could see little, for they were sunk intothe hay, and the light down there was poor. Suddenly, she gave a sharp cry, andI was afraid she had seen me, and ducked back again; then I heard him hushingher, and she cried out again, but less loud. The hay rustled as though tenthousand rats were in it, and she continued to utter cries and moans, as thoughshe were in pain. Then the rustling became so furious that I peeped up again,and saw him moving his buttocks upon her as though he hoped to make a hole inthe floor, while I saw that her knees were now bent, and her feet were in thesmall of his back, so that had there been more light, I could have viewed theexact site of the operation. Then she tried to cry out again and he placed hishand over her face, while his movements stopped as if frozen. They lay there,quite still, then he gave a great sigh, and seemed to shrink from her. Sheunwound her legs from his hips, and let them lie straight, while he lay thereupon her without moving.I must confess that all this had me wrought up to a con­siderable pitch ofexcitement, which had reached its own moment of release some minutes beforetheir motions had ceased. Now that it was over, I hoped they would dressposition. But the silence that ensued convinced me they had themselves and allowme to escape from my cramped fallen asleep, although I dared not move to findwhether my guess was correct. After some ten minutes had passed, they began tomove again; but the rustling continued so long that I inferred they had onlyreturned to their amorous congress. I peeped over the sack and discovered thatmy guess was only half correct; for he still lay like a stricken gladiator,while she crouched upon all fours, and seemed to be trying to bring some life tothe embers by blowing upon them. After a while, this had its effect . . . Esmond’s account goes on for so long that it would be point­less to quote moreof it here. The girl was a nymphomaniac, although Esmond was too inexperiencedto recognise this. She roused her cavalier to further activity three times, andfinally left him sleeping so deeply that Esmond was finally able to tiptoe pasthim without being detected.But the next development is so typical of Esmond that it must be recorded here.He admits that he was unable to see what went on; but the sounds were sounmistakable that this was unneces­sary. And now, having seen the girl naked,his only thought was how he might share her with the stable boy. He repeatsseveral times that the beauty of her shape amazed him; he had always thoughtthat the Greek sculptors exaggerated the beauty of the female form. On the wayback to the house, it struck him that the girl could probably be blackmailedinto giving herself; he only had to threaten to tell his sister that she and thestable boy were lovers. He went to his own room to wash and brush the dust offhis clothes, then went through the servants’ quarters to Minou’s room. Thereseemed to be no one about; he opened the latch and peeped in. Her room was empty, and for a moment I debated whether to wait there or returnto my own. Then I heard the sound of water from the annexe—a small closetdivided from the rest of the room by a partition—and knew that she was within. Iclosed the door behind me and tiptoed into the room; but a board creaked, andshe called: ‘Who is there?’ I said, as quietly as I could: ‘Esmond.’ She lookedout and said: ‘Oh, pardonnez moi, I am not dressed.’ I stood there, feeling atrifle foolish, and felt myself blushing, which made me angry. She seized herdress, which lay upon a chair, and held it up to her neck, asking: ‘You have amessage?’ But she was smiling as though she found me pleasing, and this servedto dispel my unease. I was staring so hard, trying to determine whether or noshe was wearing her chemise, that she remained not long in doubt of my purpose.It was the first time I had known that an exchange of opinions could take placewithout a word being uttered. Her eyes roved from my feet up to my head, andback again. I said: ‘It is cold in here’ or some such foolishness, and thenstepped forward, and took her hands, peeping over the top of them. She waswearing the chemise, but it hung low upon her neck, and the sight of the twounsupported orbs so trans­ported me that I hesitated no longer, but took thedress from her and dropped it on the bed. Above the left breast I saw the marksof two rows of teeth, and as she seemed about to protest, I pointed to these.She looked down at them and said something in French which I did not catch, andbent my head to the small nipple that now stood exposed. While she looked, Islipped off the strap of the chemise. I expected her to jerk away, but she stoodthere quietly and suffered me to take it between my lips; then, after a moment,placed her hands on my head and stroked the hair. Then she unbuttoned mywaistband and fore-flap, and reached within to the rod which craved to do herhomage. I wasted no more time, but pressed her backward to the truckle bed, andlaid my hand upon the nether parts, which were wet, for she had been washingthem when I came in. Then, without removing my trousers or hose, I dropped uponher, and entered her without difficulty, the passageway having been alreadystretched and lubricated by my predecessor. Even in this moment of excitement, Ifelt surprise to observe how tightly my member was gripped, as though noprevious tenant had distended the velvet walls. I was resolved to stay unspentas long as possible, but she undid me by clasping me tight with her thighs andwriggling her buttocks so deliciously that I was unable to hold out longer, andallowed the molten surgings to gush within her, while she wriggled and criedout, though less loudly than in the barn.The noise of footsteps outside the door gave us cause to fear that someone hadcome to investigate, but they passed, and I climbed out of bed and slid thebolt, then drew off my trousers and hose, and returned to the bed, which hadmoved some feet from its original position on its wheels. Though there wasscarce room for the two of us turned sideways, we pressed together mostcomfortably, and after some minutes, she gave me several long kisses, whosemanner at first surprised me, since I was unaware that the tongue might usurpthe function that is more normally assigned to the lips. After this, she drewback the coverlet, and examined my lower parts with curiosity, praising theirwhiteness and smoothness, and stroking my thighs and knees. . . . Again, the description is too lengthy to quote. They stayed in her room an hourlonger, and the remarkable girl induced him to make love to her three timesmore. After this, they talked, and Esmond confessed that he had watched her withShawn Rafferty. Instead of being indignant, she laughed loudly, and then askedhim if he was not jealous. ‘I was not then. I am now.’ She told him that thiswas absurd, since men and women were intended to give one another pleasure.It is hard to say whether Esmond was fortunate or unfor­tunate in his choice ofhis first mistress. It is true that his own views on promiscuity were alreadywell developed; but a more normal love affair—with an emotional as well as aphysical side—would have helped to counterbalance these. He was still unawarethat there was anything abnormal in Minou’s physical demands, since he foundhimself able to make love to her as often as she wished. Neither is it entirelytrue that the strong attraction between them was without its sentimental side;there was even a point where he considered eloping with her. He ceased to thinkabout Clarissa and Lovelace, or Julie and Saint-Preux, and thought of theiraffaire in terms of Manon and Des Grieux—although he admits that he hadpreviously dismissed Prévost as absurd and unrealistic.It is a pity that Esmond tells us nothing of Minou’s previous history, or evenif he questioned her about it. It would be inter­esting to know whether herperverse sexuality was natural or acquired. She certainly seems to be a textbookcase of nympho­mania. She liked to be bitten, particularly on the breasts,buttocks and genitals, and liked to be beaten on the behind with a leatherstrap. She enjoyed sodomy as much as normal sex, preferably standing up orbending over the bed. As soon as she and Esmond were alone in any room of thehouse, she unbuttoned his trousers and toyed with his penis until he was erect;then, if there was no time for intercourse, she would masturbate him. If she didthis orally, she swallowed the sperm; if manually, she licked it from herfingers. On one occasion Esmond’s sister Judith entered the room while Minou wason her knees in front of him; she pre­tended to be cleaning his shoes whileEsmond hastily buttoned his trousers.During the two months that this affaire continued, she made no secret aboutspending as much time as possible with Shawn Rafferty, and Esmond was so fardominated by her that he did not complain. She also tried to persuade him tohide in the barn again and watch her making love with Shawn, but Esmond’spride—or his Protestant snobbery—revolted at this. He also vetoed her suggestionthat she should tell Shawn about her affair with Esmond, and that the three ofthem should join together for romps in the barn.In August, the affaire took an unexpected turn which leads one to wonder whetherMinou (her other name is not recorded) was not one of the most complex andincalculable women of her period. A girl named Delphine Lantier, an acquaintanceof Judith’s, came to stay at Castle Donelly. One infers from Esmond’sdescription of her that she was not conventionally beautiful, for he says thather face was made beautiful by its gentleness and the large brown eyes. She alsohad the misfor­tune to be slightly deformed; she was thrown from a carriage whena child, and broke a hip and shoulder-bone. Neither had been set correctly, sothat she carried herself awkwardly. Although her father was French, her motherwas Irish, and she spoke English perfectly. (It is significant that Esmond takesthe trouble to record the personal details of a girl of his own class, while heignores those of the far more complex and fascinating Minou.)Esmond was a romantic sixteen-year-old, and he looked speculatively at everywoman he encountered. If Minou was a Manon Lescaut, Delphine was altogethercloser to Julie—or perhaps to the docile and sweet-natured Claire in the samenovel. Esmond saw she was shy, and took pains to amuse her. He lent her LaNouvelle Héloïse, after making her promise to keep it under lock and key. (Thereason for this touch of secrecy is not clear, for he mentions elsewhere thatneither his father nor his mother could speak French; perhaps he wanted toestablish some sort of in­timacy.) But he was worried in case Minou should bejealous, and tried not to make his interest in the new arrival too obvious. Heunderestimated Minou! A few days later, after he had spent an hour with her inhis own bed, she told him that she thought Delphine was in love with him, andtold him he was stupid not to have noticed. Esmond decided to find out, by theusual methods—allowing his hand to brush against hers as he passed her,touch­ing her arm or waist when they were alone, to find out if she accepted thefamiliarity. She did. On a picnic in the abbey ruins, he caught her in a cornerand kissed her. She burst into tears, and he went away, worried and puzzled, toask Minou’s opinion. Minou told him that Delphine was more serious about himthan he about her, and that her tears came from her intuition of this, aremarkable piece of analysis. So on the next occasion when they were alone,Esmond asked Delphine: ‘Don’t you like me kissing you?’, and assured her that hewould never do it again if she objected. She blushed, whispered severaldisconnected sentences, and then, when pressed, admitted that she had noobjection. Esmond invited her for another ramble in the ruins, and spent theafternoon kissing her. On his return, he had to rush to Minou’s room and possessher; the self-restraint had been too much for him. Minou told him he was aclumsy lover. What he needed was tenderness and caresses. He should stroke herface, her arm—any part of her that happened to be exposed; accustom her torespond with pleasure to his touch, and then advance cautiously on the forbiddenregions. Esmond’s description of this campaign lasts for nine closely writtenpages; he was fascinated by the minutiae of seduction. After a week, he wasallowed to expose her breasts and caress them, and to kiss her above theknees—although she held down her dress with both hands to prevent a furtheradvance. They discussed Julie and Saint-Preux, and she agreed in theory that twopeople in their position should become lovers. In practice, she drew a sharp andclear line between caresses and lovemaking.And now the inimitable Minou produced a suggestion that dazzled him. She wasconvinced that Delphine was virtuous ‘by theory and inexperience’ (as she putit), but that her curiosity was healthy enough. She told Esmond to get Delphineto the barn on the following afternoon, and to make sure that she made no soundwhen Shawn Rafferty came up to scatter the hay for their usual session oflovemaking. ‘If she refuses to look, then she is virtuous, and you had betterescape from her before she marries you. If she looks, she is already yours.’As the hour drew near, Esmond became nervous, and decided several times toabandon the whole preposterous scheme. He suspected that a girl who could drawthe line so rigidly would give the game away by revealing the hiding place. Hissister announced her intention of calling on a neighbour that after­noon, andDelphine said she would go with her; Esmond heaved a sigh of relief. Then, atthe last minute, Delphine said she had a headache, and his mother said she wouldgo instead. Esmond began to play a kind of Russian roulette with Fate. He wantedthe project to fail, but he was willing to go through the motions—anxiouslylooking out for the first excuse to abandon it. He went to Delphine’s room athalf past three and asked her if she felt like going for a walk. She said shethought it was going to rain. Ten minutes later, the sun came out, and shesuddenly declared that the headache had gone and she felt like walking. Theytook their favourite stroll towards Adare, then walked back along the stream,paddling in the shallows. Esmond talked about his childhood, and the hours hehad spent reading forbidden books in the barn. (These seem to have been nothingworse than Mrs Aphra Behn’s The Nun and Smollett’s Ferdinand, Count Fathom.) Andas they crossed the empty farmyard, Delphine suggested that they look at thebarn. It was now half past four; there was a chance that Shawn would already bethere. But he was not. Esmond led the way up the ladder to the loft, then wentto the place he had already prepared in the corner—placing clean sacks on thefloor—and flung himself down. Delphine did the same without hesitation—no doubtthis was what she intended. We wasted little time in conversation, but fell immediately to kisses and softcaresses, which quickly passed to their usual point of familiarity. She waswearing no stays, so it was less trouble than usual to expose her breasts andcom­mence assault with my lips. I had observed before that I could increase herpleasure by biting the nipples very gently, whereupon she crossed her ankles andpressed her thighs tight with an involuntary motion, from which I drew theinference that the spot thereby compressed was ready for more delicateattentions. But when my lips moved above her knees, she quickly entangled herfingers in my hair and held me tight. We were in this position when we heardfoot­steps on the ladder, and she straightaway rearranged her gown, and wasabout to sit up when I placed my finger on my lips and shook my head. We satthere, scarcely breath­ing, and then I heard the swish of the hay as Shawntossed it upon the boards and proceeded to spread it with the fork. Then he wentbelow, and brought up another load, and I whispered to her to remain silent, andall would be well, for it was only the stable boy, a particular friend of mine.But when I tried to kiss her again she shook her head and pushed me away.We heard Shawn go down and out of the door, and she said: ‘Quickly, now is thetime to go.’ But as we stood up, we heard Minou’s voice below, and she quicklysat again without further urgence from me. I had so arranged the bales that wewere able to see between two of them without standing up. Delphine was alarmedand whispered: ‘What if they should come here?’, but I reassured her, pointingto the hay. It was then, I think, that she began to suspect what Shawn hadpurposed in spreading it thus, for I could see that she blushed.Shawn came up first and stood there, and Minou had no sooner joined him than sheflung her arms about his neck and gave him a most prolonged kiss, whose nature Icould imagine from having experienced it, for she had a marvel­lous skill inbringing fire to the blood through quick dartings of her tongue. Then she untiedthe rope at his waist, so that his breeches fell to his ankles, revealing thegreat crested cock raised in salute. I now observed with delight that Delphinewas following every motion with the most avid curiosity, and I recalled Minou’ssaying that she was already mine. Whereupon I reached out and pulled down theshoul­ders of her gown, and reached under her arms to place a hand on eachbreast. She made no attempt to prevent me; I could feel her heart beating withquick, heavy thumps beneath my fingers. Minou, without her skirts, was now onher knees before Shawn, who was turned sideways so that no detail of theiractions could escape us. He held her head in his hands, and moved it back andforth to suit his pleasure. I was more interested in wondering how I might takeadvan­tage of my present situation than in the progress of their lewd joys. Iremoved my hand from her breast for long enough to unbutton my flap and allow myown impatient steed to sniff the air, then returned to my caresses. Delphine waskneeling, and from a slight movement of her behind, I guessed the impatiencethat compressed the lips of her secret place. I therefore raised her skirt abovethe level of the knee, and allowed my hand to press her thigh. This time, shemade no move to hinder me. I raised it higher, and reached the tender mount,scarcely covered with light down; but when I attempted to insinuate a finger tipbetween the lips, she shook her head and compressed her thighs more tightly. Herbreathing was so heavy now that only the rustling of the hay prevented it beingoverheard. A quick glance through the aperture in the bales showed me that theywere still engaged in the preliminaries, although both were now lying down, andhis face was hidden between her thighs. I changed my position, without removingmy hand from her belly, and began to bite her breast. Her thighs yielded, and myfinger slipped in, to find lips that were plentifully lubricated by the tears ofthe love god. These were so unformed that I had to guess rather than sense thelocation of the berry that hid within the fold. I moved my finger back andforth, and her body moved to aid its motion, while I continued to bite hernipple—a position of some discomfort. Then her fingers gripped my hair, and herhips moved with a swift oscillatory motion; her thigh closed tight upon my hand,and a long sigh was squeezed from her bosom. Her body drooped, and she wouldhave fallen forward had I not been there to support her. The sounds coming fromthe hay had now risen to a fury, but she was as indifferent as if it had been astorm outside; she let herself sink upon the sacks, and closed her eyes, tuggingand smoothing her gown to re-cover her modesty. I subdued my impatience withsome difficulty, observing the regularity of her breathing; but after fiveminutes or so, fearing that she would sleep, and so lose me my advantage, I laidmyself beside her and kissed her. She lay there as though asleep, so I placed myhand on her knee, and slid it up to the mount. She shook her head, and turnedher mouth away, but made no other resistance. I now took her lifeless hand andlaid it upon my swollen member; she let it rest loosely for a moment, thenclosed it, but all in a manner so devoid of energy that I wondered if she knewwhat she clasped. The sounds from the other side of our barrier had ceased, andall was now so silent that a mouse would have been heard. Therefore, I made noattempt to improve my position, but lay there, my hand upon her wet and inertnether mouth, her own hand lightly holding the root of my life, which I movedever so slightly, being unable to tame its impatience. We lay thus for about aquarter of an hour; then I heard Minou’s whisper, and knew that she had renewedher energies, and now intended to arouse her sleeping swain, whose only replywas a grunt. But I knew the power of her arguments well enough to be assured ofher success; and it was not long ere the crackling of the straw enabled me topress my own panting suit. I exposed her bosoms, and fell to teasing and bitingthe nipples, meanwhile pinching the moist berry between my thumb and forefinger.Soon her thighs parted, and I took this as an invitation to rest between them;but when I raised myself upon her, she closed them again, and shook her head. Iheld it still with a kiss, and moved my weight upon her, letting my balls nestlein the hollow between her thighs, while the head of my charger nuzzled the coldspot I had been caressing. Her knees were pressed too tight to afford anylodgement in the cleft, but when I returned to teasing her nipples, theirpressure relaxed, and her ankles uncrossed. Although the head of my steed hadnow slipped down between her thighs, it had lost its direc­tion, and knew notagainst what place it battered. Feeling myself so close to the goal, I lostpatience and reached down with my hand, which swiftly rearranged the folds sothat the entrance lay clear. I gave a sharp push, and felt the head slip withinthe tight orifice, where it immediately encountered an obstruction. I gave afurther push, and she shook her head and moaned. Afraid now of the sound shemight make if I persisted, I contented myself with moving the head gently in andout of its new home, which each time closed around it like a garter. Soon, shealso began to move under me, and it was too much for my overcharged batteringram, which gushed forth its homage into the mouth that sucked it so shyly. Asthis happened, I groaned and pushed with all my might; the obstruction gave, herknees parted, and my steed buried itself deep within her as if drinking from ariver. Her arms clasped tight around me, and I sealed her mouth with a kiss. The tone of this whole incident gives the impression that Esmond was already askilled Casanova who left nothing to chance. The sequel reveals that this isuntrue. Casanova would have grown tired of the girl before he withdrew from her.Esmond decided he was in love with her, and that he would marry her. Perhaps hefelt ashamed of the stratagem that had overcome her resist­ance. He wascertainly aware of the damage that would follow if he showed any lessening ofhis tenderness towards her. She was already ashamed of herself for allowing himto see her sexual excitement, and still more for allowing him to take advantageof it. If he had abandoned her completely after her surrender, it would havestruck her as no more than she deserved. Esmond determined to prove this was notso. Left alone with her—after Minou and Shawn had left the barn, and the hay hadbeen tossed below again—he told her they were engaged. That night, when Minouraised the catch of his door, she found it bolted on the inside. The nextmorning, he sought her out and told her he was betrothed, and that from now onthey must cease to be lovers. She seems to have taken this philosophically; shewas even sympathetic enough to warn him to keep the engagement a secret from hisfather. He took her advice. But Delphine showed less tact; she confided hersecret to Esmond’s sister Judith, which proved to be the worst kind ofmiscalculation. Judith was appar­ently fond of Delphine, and under differentcircumstances might have welcomed her as a sister-in-law. But Delphine was aRoman Catholic, and the Donellys were Protestants. It was the most seriousobstacle, for in Ireland a Catholic was a pariah. The gentry were Protestants;Catholics were social outcasts. Delphine was the daughter of a Frencharistocrat, but this made no differ­ence, since they were in Ireland. Judithpointed this out; there were tears and long discussions. Esmond began to feel hehad made a mistake. It was a matter of total indifference to him whetherDelphine turned Protestant, or he became a Catholic, or they both becameBuddhists. He wanted to marry her because he felt he owed her love andprotection, and because seducing her had given him so much satisfaction. Nowthey were ‘en­gaged’, and she was not even willing to come to the barn. Heremarks ironically in his journal that they would both have been far happier ifhe had never mentioned marriage.Judith rather enjoyed her role as matchmaker; she advised Esmond to say nothingto their parents until Delphine could announce that she would become aProtestant. Three days later, she and Delphine set out for Dublin to present thecase to her parents. It was the last Esmond saw of her. Judith returned alone,and announced that the Chevalier de Saint-Ange had decided to return to Franceimmediately with his family. Esmond heaved a sigh of relief, and slipped backinto Minou’s bed. But two months later he also lost Minou, when Squire Donellycaught her in the stable with a new stable boy. The squire was broad­mindedenough, but he was concerned for the virtue of his son and heir. Minou waspacked off back to Lyons, third class, with a month’s wages and several ofJudith’s old dresses. Esmond presented her with twenty guineas that he had beensaving for a pony and trap, and told himself that he was glad to be able to callhis soul—and certain other vital organs—his own again. But a month after herdeparture, Esmond began his journal: ‘I am often the most wretched andself-derogatory creature under the sun. . . .’ He had tasted too many delightsto settle down to this tame existence of a gentleman farmer. Between them, Minouand Delphine had been a complete education in the art of love. He hadexperienced the delight of masculine conquest, the feeling of power over awoman’s emotions, as well as the complete abandonment of all his sexualinhibitions. He craved sex as an alcoholic craves his tipple, but there was noone who might provide it. He released his frustration in his journal, re-livingthe hours with Minou, the seduction of Delphine. He tried to read, but foundRousseau priggish, Voltaire shallow, Sterne irritating. Only Johnson’s Rasselas,Prince of Abyssinia satisfied the craving for seriousness, and he re-read ituntil he knew it by heart. Johnson raises the question of the human desire forsomething more than happiness, more than mere contentment. Six months earlier,Esmond might have supposed this was a desire for physical fulfilment, forexperience, for pleasure; now he knew better.And now occurs what is, for me, the most interesting section of the journal. Asrainy December dragged into rainy January, Esmond plunged into a crisis of acutenervous depression, accen­tuated by worry about his father who, in lateDecember, was attacked and severely beaten by a gang of malcontents whosemotives seem to have been vaguely political. It happened in the dark, when hewas returning from the house of an unpopular local judge; his horse was struckby a stone, and almost imme­diately afterwards another large flint struck himabove the left eye, knocking him unconscious. When he had not returned bymidnight, Esmond and a party of grooms went out into a storm to search for him,and found him dragging himself along the road, half naked, still bleedingheavily. The injuries looked more serious than they were; after ten days in bed,Edward Donelly was as well as ever. But no one could find any trace of theattackers, who may have been a party of sailors whose boat was undergoingrepairs at Tarbert, on the Shannon.The whole district was shocked by the violence, although Edward Donelly was nota popular man; there was too much squalor and misery in Ireland for thepeasantry to feel any sympathy for a relatively wealthy Protestant farmer.Robbery was common; there were almost as many brigands as in Corsica. But until1760 the country had been relatively peaceful; then, with George III, thetroubles began; there was agrarian unrest; the Catholic gentry began to recovertheir courage after the Jacobite suppression. Edward Donelly was not a supporterof George III, but as a Protestant he was regarded as an agent of the Englishusurpers. But Esmond had grown up in an atmosphere of security; the peasantrycould not be obsequious enough; he was always a ‘fine handsome lad who does yerhonour credit’ and so on. Now, in his state of nervous depression, it seemedthat they were surrounded by hostile neighbours, all waiting a chance to strikea blow in the dark.Shortly thereafter, Judith heard from Delphine. She was engaged to marry a locallawyer. Esmond was not mentioned in the letter—which was probably written underthe supervision of Delphine’s mother; but there was a sentence: ‘With how muchdelight I recall our happy hours of conversation in the old barn.’ Judith waspuzzled by the sentence; she had never been in the old barn with Delphine;Esmond understood. The absurd thing was that he had almost forgotten Delphine;he certainly had no desire to become her husband. Yet the letter filled him withjealousy and misery. He recognised that this was absurd, that he didn’t loveher, that he had been fortunate to avoid further involvement. It made nodifference; every time he thought of their caresses in the ruins of the abbey orthe hay barn, he experienced a violent sense of loss, made more unbear­able byhis recognition that it was the result of having nothing else to think about.In February, he was ill for three weeks with some gastric germ, and his thoughtsdwelt constantly on death, and on the corruption of the grave. He read Johnson’sprayers, brooded on Rousseau, and suddenly caught a glimpse of the Truth thathad always eluded him. Rousseau said that what is natural is good, that evilsprings from man’s sophistication, from his interference with Nature. But is notmind itself an interference with Nature, an artificial product? The animal needsonly as much mind as is necessary to overcome its everyday problems. Man hasdeveloped intellect to serve his laziness, to create a warm, comfortablecivil­isation; then, having created it (it is interesting to realise that Esmondthought of his own century as the last word in civilised sophistication), he hasnothing to do with himself but think. And every thought takes him further fromNature.But what horrified Esmond was the suspicion that this explained his own nervousexhaustion and boredom. His intelligence had condemned him to a sense ofunreality. Doctor Johnson stood before him as an appalling example of whathappens when a man is too intelligent: a lifetime of despair and self-torment,with brief flashes of well-being. Esmond began to consider seriously whether hewould not be better off dead. ‘Everything I looked at reminded me of my misery.Just as any memory of a lost mistress brings a pang of despair, so almost anynatural object could remind me of my lost innocence. The ruins of the abbeyreminded me of death; the muddy stream made me think of drowning; the bare treesreminded me of a gallows; the baying of a dog put me in mind of funerals. Andobjects that aroused no specific association—a saucepan, a horseshoe, abook—could bring a stifling despair that was like grief.’One rainy night in late February, Esmond sat in bed and con­fronted this senseof hopelessness. If his body felt no gratitude to be in a warm room, when thewind shrieked outside, would it be aroused to some response by the rain itself?He got up and dressed, pulled on a heavy coat, then slipped out of the house. Itseemed that his worst fears were realised. The wind made him cold; but hecontinued to feel indifferent to the discomfort. He walked to the abbey, and satin the shelter of a wall. Although his feet were wet, the thought of a warm firefailed to bring a spark of pleasure. Cows were taking shelter under the wall; heenvied them because they would appreciate the shelter of a warm, dry barn. Hewondered how much cold and discomfort it would take to arouse him from hisstupor of indifference.He walked back to the house, now soaked and cold. Passing the barn, he suddenlyrecalled Minou and Delphine—and experienced a flash of pleasure. He went intothe barn to re­capture its smell. An old horse snorted and breathed heavily. Heclimbed up to the loft, and found there was still a pile of hay there. He movedit behind the sacks; then took off his wet clothes, and covered himself with theprickly hay. This was the spot on which he had lain between Delphine’s thighs;as he lay there, re-living the experience, drowsiness overcame him, and he fellasleep. The last sound he heard was the snorting and champing of the horsebelow.His night in the barn was a turning point. In early March, the weather suddenlybecame warmer. Esmond went for a walk over the muddy fields, revelling in thesun, suddenly alive to everything. He stood by the muddy River Maigh, andwondered why he had never noticed how fascinating the ripples were. He washealthy and he was nearly seventeen; in a few months he would be setting out onthe ‘grand tour’. There would be many more Minous and Delphines. . . . In hisjournal for March 23, 1765, he writes: What I find myself utterly unable to comprehend is how human creatures can failto see the blessedness that is every­where in Nature? What strange disaster hasblinded our eyes to the most plainly observable of all facts? What dark godpresides over this labyrinth of our human destiny, watching us in case one of usshould by accident find his way out into the supreme simplicity of Nature? Two weeks before he set out for Dublin, and then Paris (April 17, 1765), he wasinvolved in another brief love affair. On a visit with his father to one of thetenant farmers, he saw the man’s thirteen-year-old niece, who was living withhim. The girl was extremely pretty. Esmond spent a night dreaming about her,wondering how he could see more of her. But the conquest proved to be easierthan he expected. The girl came over the next day to bring eggs. Esmond walkedhome with her, and arranged an assignation for that evening. She was fascinatedby him, and put up a minimum of resistance; although a virgin, she had had someprevious sexual experience. On that first evening, Esmond was allowed to exploreher breasts and thighs; the following afternoon, he met her in the barn, andtook her maidenhead on the same spot on which Delphine had lost hers. During thenext two weeks they met as often as possible, spent many more hours on the sacksin the barn, and swore eternal fidelity. But in this case, Esmond knew he wasnot in love. The ease of the conquest brought almost immediate disappointment.The girl was as pretty as ever, yet when he re-read his journal entry about thefirst time he saw her, it struck him as another of Fate’s saturnine jokes,another proof that human beings are trapped in a labyrinth, whose god is asupreme confidence trickster.On the morning of April 17, he took the Limerick-Dublin coach, and experiencedkeen satisfaction as the hills and fields of Munster receded behind them. Thistime, at least, the god of the labyrinth was defeated; the love affair hadbroken off before there was time for the bitter after-taste to creep in. It wasthen, on the thirty-six-hour journey from Limerick to Dublin (120 miles!), thatEsmond formulated one of his central ideas: that life is a battle against thegod of the labyrinth. He seemed to think of the god as a cross between anenormous spider and a fat man with pointed ears. And the field he would choosefor the encounter would be the field of sex. . . .Reading of Esmond’s journey to Dublin suddenly reminded me of Clive Bates, thegrandson of Isaac Jenkinson Bates. It was true that I now had more than enoughmaterial to complete Fleisher’s edition of Memoirs of an Irish Rake. I hadearned my $15,000. But this was no longer important. There was too much I wantedto know about Esmond—and when the book was pub­lished, a great many other peoplewould be equally curious. The field would be flooded with researchers. I wantedto find all there was to be found before the rush started. Esmond had begun toobsess me. Volume two of the Journal ended as he left London for Boulogne on May28, 1765, but surely it was impossible that he could have ceased to keepjournals after that time? There were many questions I wanted to answer. Whatabout the ‘murder’ of Horace Glenney, and the rumours about Esmond and LadyMary? What about the ‘affair’ with the three sisters? Why did Dr Johnson dislikeDonelly? And what of this ‘Sect of the Phoenix’, of which I had stumbled uponsuch tantalising hints?Two days after I arrived back from Dr O’Hefernan’s, I received a postcard fromMiss Tina. It said: ‘Eileen has a bad cold, but she has asked me to tell youthat Esmond’s literary executors were the Rev. William Aston and Lord HoraceGlenney, sincerely, Tina Donelly.’ For a moment, I was baffled. Aston, yes; Ihad already guessed as much. But how on earth could Horace Glenney be Donelly’sliterary executor when he predeceased him? I was strongly tempted to jump intothe car and drive off to Castle Donelly, for my reading of the journals had mademe curious to see it again. But I had already written to Clive Bates to tell himI intended to go to Dublin the following day, and the thought of so much traveldepressed me. I picked up the phone and got through to Castle Donelly. Miss Tinaanswered. The problem about Horace Glenney was cleared up in a moment. Thisreferred to Horace Glenney junior, the son of Esmond’s friend. Miss Tina said:‘I suppose it’s common sense, really. I mean, if he was in love with MaryGlenney . . .’‘But are you sure he was?’‘Not quite sure, of course. My father once told Eileen some­thing about it, butshe can’t talk at the moment.’‘Do you happen to know where Lord Glenney was shot?’‘At his home in Scotland, I believe.’I thanked her and hung up. As far as I could see, that disposed of the storythat Esmond murdered Horace Glenney; if there was even a suspicion of such athing, would he have asked Glenney’s son to be his literary executor? I was feeling very cheerful as I set off to drive to Dublin the next morning.This was not entirely connected with Donelly. I had intended to travel by train,so that Diana could have the use of the car, but on the previous day she hadseen an advertisement for a second-hand Landrover. I felt we could now affordthis, so we bought it on the spot. I knew it was absurd—the way that some quitesmall event like this can start a glow of optimism that turns into a bonfire;but the very absurdity fascinated me, and started my creative instincts flowing.The drive eastward also delighted me, and reminded me of when we first came tolive in Ireland and spent our days exploring the country. And now it struck methat all that matters in human existence is a certain intensity ofconsciousness, of meaning, and that we must discover the trick. When I boughtthis car, it had an automatic choke, and the damned thing would cut out almostas soon as I began driving, so that the engine would stop on the first hill intotown. So our local garage fixed an ordinary hand-choke instead, and now I keepit out until the engine is warm enough to take the hills comfortably. But if Iwake up in the morning with my mind cold and dull, there is no mental choke Ican pull out until the engine is heated up. I often spend hours, or even days,trying to cudgel my brains into a state of intensity, trying to work up theinner-pressure to settle down to writing. To some extent, I have discovered thetrick: ten minutes of intense, total concentration, involving the whole being—mymuscles as well as my brain. As I do this—if no one interrupts me—I can almostwatch the pres­sure of my consciousness rising, until things no longer seem dulland neutral. It is exactly like having your first drink of the evening—that warmglow that is not situated in the stomach, but in consciousness.And now the strange thing happened—a thing I cannot possibly convey to thereader, but which I can at least try to describe. The thought came to me thatthis was how Esmond had felt as he set out on his wanderjahre in 1765. And thentwo images fused together in my mind. One was of Esmond setting off in the coachfrom Limerick—something I had dreamed about in the night. The other was theimage of the trees on Long Island, suddenly looking as if they were cast out ofphosphor bronze, as Beverley bent over me. This latter image was very strong. Icould smell Beverley’s scent, feel the warmth of her bare breast against mycheek. And with these two images came an explosion of delight. What human beingswant is to achieve these moments of freshness and intensity, and not to losethem every time their attention wanders. They want continuity of consciousness.And supposing a man said to himself: ‘It is obvious that nothing is as importantas this: from now on I shall devote my life to the search for this intensity andcon­tinuity . . .’? And I knew, beyond all possible doubt, that some­thing likethis had passed through Esmond’s mind on that morning drive from Limerick. How?Because I had lived with Esmond for weeks, until I knew how his mind worked.And now, without any sudden change, any feeling of vision or inspiration, I hada hallucinatory feeling of being Esmond. It was absurdly strong. I knew I wasdriving through a small hamlet called Fardrum, a few miles beyond Athlone, andthat I intended to stop at the pub at Moate for a ham sandwich and a draughtGuinness. At the same time, I was seated beside the coachman on the box of ajolting coach, smelling the lathery sweat of the horses and the clean air of anApril morning, as well as the tang of peat smoke from the clothes of the driver.There was something very odd about the vividness of this image. It was not‘imaginative’ in the ordinary sense: I was not somehow ‘intending’ it. It was asif something had moved close to me, like a train passing the train in which Ihappened to be sitting, and giving me a sudden intimate glimpse into a passingcarriage. And all this did not surprise me. It seemed a natural part of theupsurge of delight. My mental pressure was high. The sky was a rather cool blue,and I felt as though it were an immense sheet of cool water. It struck me withsudden total certainty: time is an illusion. It is not an absolute state. If youare an insect sitting on a leaf that is swept down a river, you might think thatit is inevitable that trees keep passing you and receding behind you, that bytheir very nature trees only last a few moments, and the only unchanging realityis the ripple and splash of the water. But the bank is real, and if you couldget off your leaf on to the bank, you would find that it is quite solid andpermanent.As soon as I had this picture of time as something illusory, and of the realityof the world through which it flows, I saw my own childhood as something I couldreach out and touch, just as I can open a book to a page I read an hour ago, ormake a tape recorder rewind to an earlier part of the tape. And it struck methat Esmond’s life was no more distant; a mere two centuries ago, two lifetimes.Our trouble is the feebleness of consciousness, which fluctuates like theelectric current from a worn-out battery. If we could replace this with a newbattery, the mind could stride across centuries. . . .I stopped at Mike Kelly’s for my Guinness; it is a quiet, old-fashioned pub,with low beams, and a turf fire in the hearth. I asked for a ham sandwich, andthe landlady’s daughter replied that I should have it piping hot from the oven:and in fact, the great chunks of flakey ham were steaming. Having served me, shewent out, leaving me alone. I looked around, and reflected that, but for theelectric lighting, this place probably looked much the same in the days ofEsmond Donelly. And then, even clearer than before, I had the sense of becomingEsmond Donelly, or leaning over and looking into his consciousness as he swungpast me. This time, with my senses fortified by the smell of ham and the tasteof the stout, I made an effort of will to hold the sensation. For a moment iteluded me; then, as I relaxed and did not try to force it, it came back again: acombination of smells, feelings, ideas. And then, quite suddenly, it seemed tofocus, and everything became clearer. Esmond’s consciousness somehow coincidedwith mine, so that I could look back on his past, on Delphine and Minou, and onthe pretty farmgirl called Eillie (short for Eileen). What is more, this lastname was new to me; Esmond refers to her in his diary as E——, perhaps afraid ofcompromising a girl who lived so close. And this excited me. I was not naïveenough simply to accept that I had some­how ‘become’ Esmond. I knew too muchabout the dream-like workings of the mind to make any such assumption. Who hasnever composed music or poetry in his dreams, or created situa­tions so strangethat they seem to be someone else’s invention? If I could ever confirm that thegirl’s name was Eillie—and it was not impossible if I could find more ofEsmond’s journals—then I would be certain that this strange experience was aform of second-sight, not a waking dream.I resisted the temptation to drink more Guinness—knowing that it would make medrowsy—and drove on as soon as I had eaten my ham. I did not want to relax. WhatI wanted was to deepen this feeling of insight, of meaning. Twenty miles outsideDublin it started to rain, and I forgot about my concentration, suddenlyenjoying the sweep of the windscreen-wipers and the pattering of the great warmdrops. And then once again, without any effort, I ‘became’ Esmond. The housesand shops of Maynooth suddenly startled me, as if I had never seen them before.But as I drove past Carton—the great eighteenth-century house that once belongedto the Dukes of Leinster—I realised that I knew the place. I had been inside it.Of course, ‘I’ never had; it was Esmond who had been there as a guest of hisschoolfriend Robert Fitzgerald, Marquess of Kildare.All the time, as I drove into Dublin along the Conygham Road, I experienced thiseffect of ‘double consciousness’. If there had been someone in the car with me,I would have said: ‘This used to be the Chapelizod Road in 1765, and here itbecame Barrack Street.’ But before I entered the old Barrack Street, I wasdriving along Wolfe Tone Quay, and experiencing mild surprise to find myselfalready beside the Liffey. In 1765, I would have had to proceed from the cobbledChapelizod Road into Barrack Street, with the river visible over the LongMeadows to my right, and then along Gravel Walk, at which point I could haveturned right on to Arran Quay—at that time, the most westerly of the DublinQuays. I passed on my right the street—whose name Donelly had forgotten—that leddown to Bloody Bridge. At Grattan Bridge I was tempted to turn right, forgettingthat I could continue to O’Connell Bridge; in Donelly’s day, Grattan Bridge(then called Essex Bridge) was the last point at which one could cross theLiffey. I was bound for the Shelbourne in St Stephen’s Green; Donelly, when hewent to Dublin in 1765, proceeded to the ‘Dog and Duck’ in Pudding Row (now WoodQuay), the hostelry run by Master Francis Magin. (I knew this from his journal,although I had forgotten it.) There he ate a supper of Boyne salmon and roastlamb, washed down by a large quantity of sweet beer of low alcohol content, andthen fell asleep in a comfortable first-floor room to cries of ‘Any hare skinsor rabbit skins?’ and ‘Dublin Bay herrin’s’. It was all so vivid that I foundmyself taking the wrong turn at College Green, and having to make a detour toget to the Shelbourne. In my room there, I opened a bottle of Volnay I hadbrought with me—although it was only half past four—and found myself lesstroubled by these odd double-exposure effects. Even so, I only had to close myeyes to see clear pictures of a Dublin that was in many respects like the one Icould see out of my window (although in those days Stephen’s Green wassurrounded by a hedge and a ditch, not railings)—that was certainly just ascrowded and noisy—but whose streets were mostly cobbled, and whose houses seemedcleaner and more dignified. It also stank—particularly in midsummer—of sewageand fish. And the masts with furled sails that crowded the Liffey produced aneffect that was not unlike Canaletto’s Venice. After my third glass of wine, the‘double exposure’ faded altogether, and it struck me that Sheridan Le Fanu mighthave written a powerful and gloomy story about the double-tenancy of a humanbrain by two men of different centuries. I could even see that, viewed by atempera­ment like Le Fanu’s, it could have been a frightening experience. Butthen, Le Fanu’s basic outlook was defeated and negative. And this is the onlyfundamental question. I rang Diana to tell her I had arrived safely; as I hung up, a call came throughfrom Clive Bates. I had written to tell him I would be at the Shelbourne. Iasked him if he would like to join me for dinner. He accepted, and suggestedthat I go to have a drink with him first. He was in Ranelagh Road, opposite themonastery, and I walked over there at about five o’clock. He was a plumpishyoung man with a drawling Oxford voice. His flat was comfortable, and the drinkcupboard well stocked. There were a great many books, some of them on thetheatre and ballet. Clive Bates obviously had a private income or a good job, orboth. Everything about his room indicated that he was a man who was fond of hiscomforts. He had great charm and ease of manner; but something about his mouthsuggested that he might become very sulky or bad-tempered if he failed to gethis own way.While we drank vodka martinis, the conversation was general; then it turned tomy books, and to various writers we had both met. He had worked in the ForeignOffice for a while—after Eton and Balliol—and had met a great many literary andtheatrical figures in London. For my own part, I always avoid other writers;talking shop bores me, and there are few whose work I really admire. So theconversation soon began to bore me. After half an hour or so, I tried tactfullyto direct it into other channels. I asked after the health of his grandfather.‘Oh yes. The old boy wants to see you. I’ve been telling him about your work.’He looked at his watch. ‘He’s usually alone at about this time. Would you liketo drop over before we eat?’ I said yes, trying not to sound as eager as I felt.We drove over to Baggot Street, although it was close enough. Clive Bates had aPorsche that was so low I had a feeling that my buttocks were within an inch ofthe road. As we got in, Bates said:‘Of course, you’re doing all this for money?’For a moment I failed to understand him, and looked blank; he said:‘This Donelly chappie. I mean, he’s pretty second rate, isn’t he? I was lookingat his book on deflowering virgins the other day. It’s pretty crude stuff.’I started to say that I thought the book a forgery, and then, for some reason,held my peace. Instead, I explained about Fleisher and his commission.We parked in Baggot Street. Clive Bates said casually:‘By the way, have you ever heard of the Sect of the Phoenix?’I stared at him. And then a peculiar thing happened. Suddenly, I was Esmondagain, or rather, Esmond was looking out of my eyes. I said:‘Vaguely. Wasn’t it some kind of magical cult?’‘More or less. Donelly was a member.’‘How do you know?’‘It’s in my grandfather’s papers. He’s always been interested in this Sect ofthe Phoenix. He heard about it from a magician called Macgregor Mathers. You mayhave come across him?’‘Of course. I’ve got his translation of the Zohar.’There was no time for more conversation; we were ringing on a doorbell, and afew moments later a young nurse opened the door. Bates called her ‘My dearBetty’, and pinched her behind. She seemed embarrassed by my presence. We wentup to a first-floor bedroom. It was a dark place, although it was still lightenough outside; the curtains were half drawn, and a dim bulb burned over thebed.Isaac Jenkinson Bates was as frail as I had expected from his grandson’sdescription: a little, bald-headed old man with a parchment complexion. When heraised his hands from the counterpane to shake hands with me, they trembledconvulsively, and he quickly laid them flat on the bed again. He asked us if wewould like a drink. We both refused, but he insisted. ‘I know you young peoplelike a drink at about this time.’ He told the nurse to pour us sherry. Iaccepted it out of politeness, but it was awful stuff. The old man talked for afew minutes on the history of sherry, and his own theory of why it was oncecalled sack—because the grapes were strained through sacks. Then, halfwaythrough a sentence, he changed the subject to the Ireland’s Eye murder case. Ihad read up all I could find on it before I left home, but it proved to beunnecessary; he talked in a steady flow for another ten minutes or so.When he paused for a moment, Clive Bates said:‘Mr Sorme had heard of the Sect of the Phoenix.’‘Oh yes; well, of course, Donelly was a member of that, and a most disgustingand unpleasant sort of thing it was too. Yes, of course, you know it sprang froma belief that if a couple were copulating, they couldn’t catch a disease. So atthe time of the Black Death it became an excuse for every kind of licence. ByDonelly’s time it was just a kind of semi-magical sect of ruffians. Do you knowde Sade’s Hundred and Twenty Days of Sodom? I’m pretty certain that de Sade wassatirising the Sect of the Phoenix in that—you know, the four filthy old rakeswho set up a kind of sexual menagerie in a country house. Old Tom Wise alwaysthought that that was why de Sade spent most of his life in gaol. He knew toomuch about them.’Clive Bates interposed: ‘Thomas J. Wise. The literary forger, you know.’‘Well, he may or may not have been that. They say he was, but I’m not so sure.But he was always a damned good friend to me. And as I say, he was absolutelyconvinced that these Phoenix people were after de Sade . . .’Clive winked at me.‘But why should they be after him if he was as bad as they were?’‘He wasn’t. No. He was satirising them, you see.’I should explain that the old man’s explanations were not as clear as I havemade them here. His conversation was distinctly hard to follow, and punctuatedwith odd rumbles and snorts. I did not try to contradict his amazing statementabout de Sade, but my hope of getting any useful information sank lower. I askedhim how he had become interested in the Sect of the Phoenix.‘Saw a copy of that rare pamphlet. That was how I got to know Wise, as a matterof fact.’‘Which pamphlet, sir?’‘Oh, the famous one . . . Henry Martell and George Smithson. Clive, look in thetop drawer over there, will you?’The pamphlet was not in the top drawer; but after ten minutes—during which Batesmuttered dark accusations against the world in general, and his nurse inparticular—it was found in another cupboard. I snatched at it eagerly. It hadbeen placed in red morocco folders, and was in a rather battered condition. ANEXPOSURE OF THE EVIL CONSPIRACY KNOWN AS THE SOCIETY OF THE PHOENIX, by HenryMartell, M.A., and George Smithson, D.D. Printed for the authors by G. Robinson,the Old Bankside, 1793. Clive was asking, in his smoothest and most insinuatingtone:‘I don’t understand why you think it genuine when it came from a man like Wise.’The old man rose to the bait and became very snappy.‘I’ll thank you not to speak like that about Wise. He was no more a forger thanI am. He was trying to defend the memory of his friend Henry Buxton Forman.’I said:‘In any case, surely the actual text of the forgeries was always genuine? It wasonly a matter of spurious dating on pamphlets?’‘Quite’, said the old man, and then, to Clive: ‘You see, he knows more about itthan you do!’I left them to argue, and read avidly. The whole pamphlet took a high moraltone, and accused the Sect of the Phoenix of being the cause of the downfall ofLouis XIV. Since it will be printed complete in the appendix of the DonellyMemoirs, I shall not quote it at length here. If this pamphlet was old Bates’schief source of information on the brotherhood, I could see why he regarded itso unfavourably. I found myself reminded of certain pamphlets and articlespublished about Rasputin shortly after his murder in 1917—incredible, vagueaccusations of mon­strous conspiracies, wholesale rape and abduction, disgustingceremonies. According to the authors, it was primarily a magical organisation.The passage which aroused most discussion—after my article about it in theAtlantic Monthly—was the one describ­ing the way in which the Grand Master orany of his selected adepts could enslave girls by collecting three of their‘bloddied clouts’ after their menstrual period, cutting a hole in the middle ofany stain shaped roughly like the female genitals, and wearing this on the penisfor a period of seven days and nights. At the end of this period, the virginwill be impelled to answer the summons of the Grand Master to yield him hermaidenhead, and thereafter may be possessed by him at any time, even though theyare a thousand miles apart. There follows the strange story of Adele Crispin,who was possessed by the Grand Master on her wedding night, at the same timethat her husband was possessing her, and whose child had the features of theGrand Master—black hair, dark skin, and so on. (The Grand Master at the time wasthe Persian Abdallah Yahya, who boasted that he had left his seed in the womb ofevery pretty woman in Roman high society. The authors cite this as an example ofmonstrous de­pravity rather than as imaginative mendacity.) Abdallah Yahya wasmurdered and dismembered in 1791 by Hendrik van Griss, the monstrous Dutchman.Van Griss is supposed to have weighed over 300 pounds (150 kilos), and to havefrequently rendered his victims unconscious, or even killed them, by simplyallowing his weight to fall on them. Van Griss was Grand Master for only twoyears, during which time he was infected with syphilis by the Rumanian courtesanMaria Creanga, which is said to have been of such a deadly nature that by 1794Van Griss had become a putrefying, featureless mountain of flesh. In the Journalof Psychoanalysis for July 1969, Professor Aram Roth interpreted the whole storyin Freudian terms—beginning with the fetichistic activities with ‘bloddiedclouts’—and dismissed it as Gothic fantasy. In the September issue, MissMarganita Bondeson points out that there was no need for invention, since mostof the rituals described can be found in Arabic and Persian grimoires of theeighteenth century, and pointing out that Restif de la Bretonne has describedsomeone who sounds very like van Griss (under the name Cubières-Palmézaux) inhis Nuits de Paris of 1788, describing him as ‘the legendary pervert’. It was Iwho drew her attention to the Restif passage.‘They were criminals, these people,’ the old man said. ‘Criminal degenerates.You saw who introduced the sect to France?’I had indeed. The authors of the pamphlet stated that Gilles de Rais had becomea member of the sect in his seventeenth year (1421), initiated by a defrockedpriest. Martell and Smith­son were in agreement with St Nilus Sorsky that thesect was nothing more than a development of the doctrines of the Brethren of theFree Spirit. Having rejected all moral law, they aimed at the fullest expressionof the ‘organs of pleasure’. In its earliest days, say the authors, members ofthe sect dressed as monks, and specialised in rape and necrophily. They wouldoffer to keep vigil over dead bodies of young girls—and boys—and wait untileveryone was asleep before ravishing the corpse. The one thing to be said intheir favour, apparently, was that they tried to avoid doing actual physicaldamage to their victims. A young milkmaid who was raped by two of them was lefttied and gagged under a heap of leaves, to be found two days later. Another wastold that she would find herself pregnant with a monster if she dared to breathea word, and duly kept the secret until her next men­strual period reassured her.‘Since it was their rule never to kill the victim to avoid later recognition,they were obliged to become masters of disguise, and many of them carried boxesof different coloured dyes that they might change the colour of their habits atwill.’ Gilles de Rais was their first rich convert, having been received intothe sect by one Gilles de Sillé. The talk of alchemy at his trial was a blindalley, according to the pamphlet. The mass murder of children was simply anexpression of the ‘diabolical licentiousness’ advocated by the Sect of thePhoenix.Now if Rais was a member of the Sect of the Phoenix, Martell and Smithson wouldhave established their case that it was an evil and horrific organisation. Butin fact they offer no evidence for their assertion. I felt inclined to pointthis out to the old man, but it was difficult to interrupt the meandering floodof reminiscence. I finally managed to ask him if he had anything more on theSect of the Phoenix.‘Yes. I’ve a most interesting letter from Tom Wise. I corres­­ponded with himabout it—that would be in about 1905. Clive, look in that top drawer again.’Clive pulled a face, but obediently rummaged among piles of old papers. Thenurse came in with a bowl of steaming, aromatic liquid, which she placed in ametal frame on the bed. Old Bates then covered his head with a kind of plasticbag, and breathed in the fumes. I presume it was some cure for asthma. I offeredto help Clive Bates search for the papers. He said: ‘Oh, I expect you’ll findsome interesting stuff. . .’, and picked up the pamphlet I had been reading. Iglanced through a pile of old letters, but since I had no idea of what I wassupposed to be looking for, I felt the whole exercise was futile. I pulled out ablack folder from the bottom of the drawer, and glanced into it. What I saw mademe look quickly towards the old man, then at his grandson. Neither of them waspaying any attention to me. The folder contained a dozen or so pages ofmanuscript, and I recognised the handwriting. It was James Boswell’s. The firstsheet was headed ‘Saturday 1st February’, and someone had inserted the date 1766in pencil. Again I glanced at Clive. He was completely absorbed in the pamphlet.The old man was breathing wheezily and complaining to the nurse, who wasrearranging the bed. I drew up my chair to the drawer, and settled down toreading the manuscript. At one point, Clive Bates got up and glanced over myshoulder. I wondered if he would ask me what the devil I was doing; but he wentand sat down again, and continued reading.The account described Boswell leaving Paris in the company of Thérèse leVasseur, Rousseau’s mistress (whom Boswell had described in an earlierentry—which I discovered later—as ‘a little, lively neat French girl’); the pairwere on their way to England, travelling together for convenience. On the secondnight, they decided to share a bed at the inn. Boswell, to his deep chagrin,failed to perform his manly duties, and he burst into tears, ‘whose stains’, henoted, ‘can be observed on the previous page’. Thérèse restored his confidencethe following night by performing for him the service that Minou did for bothher lovers—kneeling in front of him and caressing him with her mouth. ‘The sightof her crouched in this humble position made me feel pity, which did so greatlyrestore my vigour that I laid her down on the carpet there and then, and came ather like a wild bull. I think she was well satisfied by my size, for she gave agasp of surprise, and then let out her breath in a sigh.’ I am quoting from thefew sentences that I managed to scrawl in pencil on a scratch pad that I had inmy pocket. I knew I was looking at the Boswell manuscript that Isaac JenkinsonBates had somehow extracted from Malahide. Quite obviously, he had no right tohave it. So I knew the chances of his allowing me to borrow it, or even copy it,were minimal.Clive Bates said: ‘Have you come to the bit about Donelly yet?’‘No.’ I was startled, and glanced at the old man. His head was completelyinvisible, and I was certain he had not heard. Clive said:‘Do read it. It’s terribly funny.’I muttered something, hoping that it would not dawn on old Bates to ask me whatI was reading, or if I had found Wise’s letter. I skipped over two pages ofBoswell apostrophising himself as ‘you’ and reflecting on his qualities of charmand moral seriousness. In the entry for Sunday, February 9, I found the name Iwas looking for. Boswell and Thérèse arrived at Calais in a rainstorm. They putup at a hostelry that he mentions simply as Mme Duchesne’s, where he and Thérèsetook a single large room on the ground floor. Boswell changed his clothes andwalked around the town. ‘Near the docks, someone clapped me upon the shoulder,and I turned to see Esmond Donelly, who had come there by the diligence fromDunquerque.’ They went back to Boswell’s lodging, where Donelly was able toprocure a room. Apparently Boswell and Esmond had met in Dresden. They had ‘acollation and a flask of good wine’, and talked about Wilkes and Horace Walpole,whom they had both seen in Paris. Thérèse came in—Boswell was unaware thatEsmond had met her with Rousseau at Neuchâtel—and Boswell says: ‘I had to own Iwas chagrined at the cordiality of her greeting, and the manner in which shekept on repeating that this was a delightful surprise.’ They decided to eatdinner together, and Esmond took them to an eating house. ‘At supper, he talkeda great deal of bawdy, and since Mademoiselle did not seem to be offended, Ijoined in, and felt my ill humour disappear.’ They returned to their lodgings,and Boswell said jokingly that he hoped Esmond would treat their meeting withdiscretion if he happened to see Rousseau in London. And then, with thein­credible frankness that is so typical of Boswell, he proceeded to tell Esmondof his failure with Thérèse, and of how he had been so alarmed on a lateroccasion that he drank a whole bottle of wine before going to bed with her. Theconversation became more intimate. Thérèse talked about the clumsiness of theEnglish in the art of lovemaking. Esmond thereupon shocked Boswell by offeringto demonstrate his own mastery of the subject there and then. And then it struckhim that if Esmond possessed Thérèse, he would have good reason for beingdiscreet if he met Rousseau; so he expressed his approval of the idea. It wasThérèse’s turn to look shocked, and Esmond twitted her with accusations ofprudery. At this, she decided that it would be pointless to conceal herinclination, and agreed to form her own estimate of Esmond’s prowess as a lover.‘Come, sir,’ said Esmond to Boswell, ‘let us show her that the Celts are thelife­blood of Europe.’ Thérèse giggled; Boswell was determined to show that hewas as sophisticated as his young friend (Esmond was eight years his junior),and accompanied them into the bed­room.What then happened was that Boswell and Esmond helped Thérèse to undress, andwhile she stood in her shift, both men began to caress her. Each one of themfixed his mouth on one of her breasts, while Thérèse held their two erectmembers in either hand, and commented that she had never held such finespeci­mens of lusty manhood. They removed her shift and laid her naked on thebed and Esmond performed an act of cunnilingus. Then Thérèse, groaning withexcitement, gasped ‘Vite’, and both Boswell and Esmond tried to hurl themselveson her simul­taneously. Boswell, being slighter, got the worst of the crash, andwhile he was still picking himself up, Esmond had penetrated her. Hisdescription of Esmond and Thérèse making love will undoubtedly rank as a classicof its kind. I had time to jot down only a few lines. Though small, she was of remarkable strength and vigour, and made him cling toher as though she had been an unbroken stallion impatient of her rider. Donellyclasped her buttocks firmly in both hands, and rammed as though he hoped todrive her head through the wall. As I stood there in my shirt, with my lanceupraised as though present­ing arms, I was unexpectedly struck by the absurdityof my position, and how it would have appeared to Dr Johnson or General Paoli,had they been able to stand there and observe me. But then, while they werestill galloping in mid-career, Donelly of a sudden cries: ‘Now it’s Bozzie’sturn’, and unsheathes his weapon, upon which our maid groaned and murmured:‘Unkind.’ So as to minimize her inconvenience, I leapt upon her like a brigandand drove my pole into the succulent embrace. But here my headlong fervour undidme, for she had no sooner received my tool than she also received a wombfull ofgushing seed, which leapt forth before I could prevent it or admonish myself topractise self-conquest. At this, my own head drooped so low as that of my tool,and my cheeks imitated its colour; but I was scarcely off her before Donelly hadreplaced me, and was soothing her disappointment with strokes that made theirbellies smack together. The description continues for two more pages, but this was all I had time tocopy. The nurse was helping old Bates to remove the plastic bag, so I quicklyread on to the end, describing how Boswell, after his first failure, redeemedhimself by fucking her vigorously, ‘with such style that I regretted that Icould not stand by to see it’. He was immensely gratified when Thérèse murmured:‘Ah, it is a sad fate to be an old man’s mistress.’ He, Esmond and Thérèse spentthe night in the same bed—which was big enough for them—and all three found thesituation so piquant that they would doze off for a while and then return tolovemaking. Boswell fell into a deep sleep while Esmond was persuading Thérèseto allow him to sodomise her, but he later rolled her on to her back and movedon top of her again. By this time, even Thérèse’s long-pent-up desire for ayoung stallion had been satisfied, and she lay passively, gasping slightly, asBoswell made love for the sixth time. ‘I was the last to possess her thatnight,’ he records exultantly, ‘but in honesty am compelled to admit thatDonelly did it seven times to my six.’ The following night, Boswell fell sickwith a stomach ailment, and spent the night in Esmond’s bed. He admits that hisheart has gone out of the sport, ‘although we saw a young girl of about fourteenin the baker’s who could have inspired me for the rest of the week’. Thefollowing day, Esmond informed them that business would keep him in Calais a fewdays longer. As the boat took them from the harbour steps to the ship that wouldcarry them to England, Boswell looked up and saw Esmond standing on thequay—with the pretty fourteen-year-old. Thérèse, luckily, did not notice them.On returning to Dover the following day (February 12), Boswell’s publishedjournal resumes: ‘Yesterday morning had gone to bed very early, and done itonce; thirteen in all. Was really affectionate to her.’ He does not record howhis score compares with Esmond’s.Clive Bates caught my eye and shook his head warningly. The nurse was removingthe plastic tent. I closed the manuscript which I had just finished, and slippedmy notes into my pocket. I picked up a pamphlet by Ruskin, and when the old manasked me what I had been reading, declared I found it fascinating. His grandsonsaid we ought to be leaving, and the nurse seemed to agree.‘Has your friend asked me all the questions he had in mind?’I said hesitantly: ‘There’s just one, sir. About Esmond Donelly . . .’‘Donelly? Who’s he?’Clive explained. The old man said:‘Ah yes, I remember now. Now he was a member of the Sect of the Phoenix.’‘How do you know?’‘Let me see . . . how do I know? Ah . . . Yes. Wise told me. It’s in that letterI wanted you to find. That pamphlet you’ve been looking at—it’s not by . . .whatever they’re called. It’s by another man, a friend of Donelly’s. I can’tremember his name. He had a title.’‘It couldn’t have been Horace Glenney, could it?’‘Ah yes, that’s the man. Lord Glenney.’‘But how did Wise know this?’Unfortunately, Bates interpreted this as another attack on Wise, and launchedinto a long defence of his old friend. I decided to leave it at that. Besides, Iwas hungry. I thanked him, promised to call again, and left. Outside, CliveBates said apologetically:‘You see, the old boy’s pretty ga-ga.’‘Have you read that piece of Boswell I was reading?’‘Ah, you knew it was Boswell, did you? Yes, of course I’ve read it. I think it’sa superb piece of bawdry. I keep trying to persuade him to send a copy to thatchap who’s editing the Boswell journals, but he won’t.’‘Naturally. It doesn’t belong to him.’‘Are you sure?’I outlined the story of the Boswell papers. He said:‘He always claims he bought it for five pounds. He says Lady Talbot came acrossit one day and asked her husband to destroy it. He said he would, but he agreedto sell it to Grandfather for a fiver.’‘It could be true. Does he have any more Boswell papers?’‘Not as far as I know. That’s the only one I’ve seen.’It had started to rain as we parked opposite the Shelbourne. Isaid—conventionally—‘Thank you for taking me. He’s a delight­ful old man.’‘Oh, he’s all right. You don’t know him.’I was curious, but decided not to press him. There was no need to. As we sat inthe bar, drinking red wine, he said:‘I would imagine that my grandfather is one of the worst compounds of unlikeablequalities that you would find in Dublin at the moment. To begin with, he’s aliar. He pretended he couldn’t remember Donelly’s name. Nonsense, of course. Heknows it as well as you do.’‘Then why . . .’He interrupted me: ‘Second, he’s probably the meanest man in Ireland . . .’ Forthe next five minutes, he offered me examples of his grandfather’s meanness thatwere certainly convincing enough; it may be an Irish type, for Maturin describesanother such at the beginning of Melmoth the Wanderer, who begs, with his lastbreath, that he might be buried in a pauper’s grave. Then followed stories ofhis grandfather’s petty dishonesty. ‘Then there’s that poor girl who looks afterhim. She’s only a student nurse, so he pays her next to nothing. But he gets herto sleep with him by promising to leave her money in his will. Of course, hewouldn’t dream of it.’‘Are you sure?’ I was astounded; he didn’t look healthy enough to survive a wetdream.‘Of course. She sleeps with me on her night off.’I was beginning to feel depressed. Clive Bates was describing his grandfather’sfaults with a relish that I found rather ghoulish.‘Why don’t you tell her he doesn’t intend to leave her money?’He winked. ‘She might leave him. That wouldn’t benefit him or me.’I suggested that we should take our wine in with us to the dining room. He said:‘Would you mind if we ate in the long bar downstairs?’‘No. If you prefer it.’We found a table by the window, looking out on the street. I asked:‘Who is your grandfather’s heir?’‘I suppose I am.’‘Then why do you dislike him so much?’‘That’s nothing to do with it. He’s an old swine. Anyway, I don’t need hismoney. I’m fairly well off. That’s why he’ll probably make me his heir. Hisnephew Jim—Jim Hurd—needs it more than I do . . .’He broke off and stared out of the window. It was still raining, and aragged-looking child was looking in at us. They stared at one another, then hegrinned. I asked:‘Do you know her?’‘No.’ But nevertheless he was beckoning to her with his finger. She shook herhead. He got up and went out. I expected to see her vanish before he arrived,but she stood there, looking cold, wet, and rather grubby. He said something toher; she shook her head. Then he took her by the shoulder, and propelled herahead of him. A moment later, they were back at our table. He said:‘You don’t mind her joining us, do you?’I said no. But I was more concerned about how the manage­ment felt. She wasolder than she looked through the glass—fourteen or fifteen, perhaps. Her hairhung in rats’ tails, and her nose was running. She wore a short jacket withpuffed shoulders and only one button. The rain had made streaks in the grime onher face. She looked as if she hadn’t washed for a fortnight; and to be honest,the rain seemed to bring out smells that con­firmed this. Clive asked her:‘What’s your name?’‘Florence.’‘Do they call you Flo?’‘Yes.’The voice was cockney. She sat there, chafing her cold hands together, looking apicture of misery. Our waiter was looking at us disapprovingly, and I thoughtthe manager was about to come over and ask us to leave—he was staring very hard.Clive said:‘Would you like some fish and chips?’She nodded, but continued to look numb and lifeless. Clive beckoned the waiterover, and gave the order with a sort of bullying flamboyance. My own feelingswere mixed. If he had invited her in out of kindness, then I approved, althoughI would have preferred to take her to somewhere quieter and darker. But he wassuch an odd and complex character that it was difficult to be sure of hismotives. I thought the girl looked uncomfortable and out of place. I finallysuggested that we might go up to my room, and have the meal sent up.‘No, no. Why should we? We’re all right here.’I was sitting next to the girl, and would have preferred to be less close. Itook her jacket from her to hang it up, and it smelt as if she had found it on arubbish dump, and as if it had at some point been used for wrapping fish. I havean unusually sensitive nose; but even so, it hardly seemed fair on ourneighbours.The meal was one of the most uncomfortable I have ever had, and I orderedanother bottle of wine in an attempt to forget the awkwardness. I could notunderstand why she had agreed to come in. She answered questions inmonosyllables, obviously afraid of raising her voice, and sat in a crouchedposition, as if still cold. Clive seemed oblivious of the atmosphere. He talkedloudly and cheerfully, telling me anecdotes about the Cannes Film Festival, andBergman’s latest film, that failed to arouse the slightest flicker of interestin me. I tried to talk to the girl, but it was clear that she preferred to beleft alone. I felt easier when the people at the next table left; and when herfish and chips arrived, she swamped them with vinegar and tomato ketchup, andher own damp, fishy smell was less noticeable. The girl refused a sweet, to myrelief. I had intended to put the meal on my hotel bill; instead, I paid cashand left the waiter a large tip. I didn’t feel like admitting that I was stayingin the hotel.Clive said, in his loudest and most aristocratic voice:‘Well, if we’re not having anything more, we may as well go and have cheese andbiscuits back at my place, eh?’I was so glad the meal was over, I made no objection. Besides, I expected thatthe girl would now leave us. The sight of her unhappy face was making me gloomy.The waiter’s pleasure at the size of the tip was a minor victory.Outside, Clive said: ‘Well, I don’t know how we can all pack in my two-seater.’I thought this was intended as a hint to the girl; but she only stood there. Hesaid: ‘Oh well, we’ll manage it. Come on’, and grabbed her arm firmly. I said:‘Won’t your parents be expecting you home?’She shrugged indifferently and said: ‘Naow.’In the Porsche, she sat on my knee. In the enclosed space—and Clive Bates askedme not to open my window—the fishy smell was stronger. She had to press backagainst me to get her knees in. Clive patted her on the knee, saying: ‘We’llsoon be home—oho, you got a hole there’—he was referring to her stocking. Thenhe winked at me, and said: ‘I envy you.’ I looked at him with mild amazement.Surely he couldn’t find this damp, snuffle-nosed child sexually desirable?Perhaps he had no sense of smell?Her passivity struck me as odd. When we stopped in front of his flat, I expectedher to raise some objection. After all, how did she know we didn’t both intendto rape her? But she stood there indifferently, until Clive took her arm and ledher to the door.She looked even more out of place in his well-furnished room. She threw off thecoat on to the settee, and went and crouched near the fire. She seemed totallyuninterested in her surround­ings. Clive said:‘Let’s play some music, shall we? Do you know James Oswald’s Dust Cart Cantata?No? You ought to. It’s delightful.’ I won­dered if this was supposed to be asatirical reference to the girl, but he produced a record of that title, and putit on the turn­table. He offered her a drink, but she refused. He brought outcheese, biscuits and stuffed olives; she refused these too. But when he offeredher a large tin of assorted biscuits, she took it without a word, and satmunching them, her legs spread apart in front of the fire, dropping crumbs onhis modernistic armchair and on the white carpet. I took a chair on the otherside of the hearth, but Clive moved close to her. I began to wonder if she wasdrugged; her small, sharp face remained utterly indifferent. It was not evensullen. When he talked to her, she either answered in monosyllables, or merelynodded or shook her head. When she had crunched her way through an incrediblenumber of biscuits, she asked for a drink. He went to the kitchen and broughther a bottle of Coca-Cola with a straw. When the Dust Cart Cantata was over, sheasked, with mild asperity: ‘Whyn’t you play something decent?’ He produced arecord of Mantovani and his orchestra, and this seemed to satisfy her, althoughshe said nothing.I wondered whether he was hoping I would go home and leave him alone with her;but when I suggested that it was late, he immediately contradicted me, andswitched on the television news. I sat there, sipping a brandy, knowing I shouldbe feeling drunk, and yet feeling as if I had been drinking water all day.The news was followed by a programme on the political troubles in NorthernIreland. Clive tapped me on the arm and pointed at the girl. She was asleep. Hesaid softly: ‘Rather nice, don’t you think?’ I found it hard to think of areply; finally, I said: ‘She needs a good bath.’ He looked unexpectedly sad,lowering his eyes. ‘Yes, poor thing . . .’‘Don’t you think you ought to get her home? Her parents could cause trouble?’‘Oh, I don’t think so. She could sleep here if she wanted to.’I gave up. He knew his own business best.She had fallen asleep with one leg over the arm of the chair, the otherstretched towards the fire; a change of position made her skirt slip back on herknees. Clive grinned at me, leaned forward, and carefully peered up her skirt. Iexpected her to wake up, but she didn’t. He turned to me. ‘Look.’ I shook myhead. ‘No thanks.’ ‘But look.’ He gave the impression he was trying to show mesomething important. I changed my position and looked up the skirt. The thicklisle stockings were all holes and ladders. She was wearing aertex cottonknickers, and they were so badly torn at the crotch that nothing was hidden. Ilooked away quickly—not out of prudishness, but because I would have feltashamed if she opened her eyes. I said:‘What about it?’He looked sad and thoughtful again.‘She obviously comes of a poor family. No wonder she’s not very clean.’ Hetouched her shoulder. ‘Do you want to sleep here?’ She stirred, but did not openher eyes, and I suddenly wondered if she was shamming. He felt the cloth of herskirt. ‘She’ll catch cold if she wears these much longer.’ He stood up, placed ahand under her arm and another under her knees, and picked her up. She moved herhead and said something. It struck me now that she was either pretending to beasleep, or he had put something in the drink he gave her. If so, it must havebeen chloral hydrate, to produce such total oblivion.I followed him to the bedroom—it would have been stupid to ask what he wasdoing. It was comfortable and warm. He laid her on the quilt of the large doublebed, then removed her shoes. After this, he looked around the waist of the skirtand found the zip. I asked: ‘Is that wise?’ He said: ‘I’m not going to put herin my bed with these clothes on. You said yourself they stank.’ He found the zipand pulled it clumsily down, then yanked the skirt off her feet. She was wearingno underskirt—only the stock­ings, held up by suspenders, and the panties, whosewaist-elastic was almost completely detached from the body of the garment.‘Pretty little figure’, he said. This was an overstatement; she was thin, andthe small belly was so flat that the hip bones stood out. He took hold of thebottom of the thin woollen sweater—it was of a muddy green colour—and raised it,then moved her on to her side so he could tug it over her head. She was wearinga bra that had once been white, and the straps at the back had been joined by apiece of black elastic tied roughly to the remains of the cloth. I felt theautomatic masculine stirrings as I looked at her. He snapped the elastic with atug. The small breasts were flat and undeveloped. He looked at me.‘Shall we have her?’I said positively: ‘No. Let her alone.’He reached down suddenly and placed his hand on the front of my trousers; Istarted back as though he had hit me. He grinned.‘You can’t pretend you’re not excited.’I mastered the impulse to hit him, and said: ‘Why don’t you put her into bed andlet her sleep?’‘No. She’d be disappointed.’ He pulled down the panties, and slipped his handbetween her thighs. ‘Feel.’‘No thanks.’‘Look.’ He held out the hand to me. It was moist. He said:‘I think I’ll have her.’ He unbelted his trousers, and pushed them down. Myfeelings were mixed. I was fairly certain that she was awake. But if she wasn’t,then I was an accessory to her rape. Since she hadn’t given consent, I was anaccessory anyway. I leaned forward and pinched her shoulder. She did not move.Clive Bates was now chuckling in an insane manner. He prodded her breast withhis finger. ‘Tell him you’re awake, sweety.’ He bent over, as if to kiss her,but instead took her lower lip in his mouth and bit it. With his enormous nakedbehind sticking towards me, he looked obscene. Then he pushed her thighs apart,and moved on to her. He guided his penis with his hand, gave a thrust, and wentinto her. Then he looked at me, with a blissful expression, and said: ‘Aa . . .ah!’ I turned and walked out of the room. Before I was out of the door, he wasafter me.‘Now come, my dear Gerard, don’t be such a prude. You know you find it exciting.Why don’t you come and watch, then I’ll watch you?’ He stood there at the door,still in his evening shirt and bow tie, with his penis erect and shiny.‘She’s not my type. I don’t want to sound offensive, but she’s not very clean.’‘No, I suppose not.’ His face had gone pink and shiny, and his eyes wereglittering with a feverish enthusiasm. ‘Still, we could bath her if you like?’‘Are you mad?’‘You’re just a prude, aren’t you, Gerard?’‘I wouldn’t say that.’He came and took my arm—the erection stayed undiminished, and I found it hard tokeep my eyes away. He said wheedlingly:‘I’ve done you a favour today. Listen, when the old man dies, I’ll inherit hismanuscripts. I’ll let you take what you like.’The situation suddenly reminded me of Colonel Donelly, and it was too much. Isaid:‘Look, if you want to screw her, go and do it. I won’t stop you. But I don’twant to. And I don’t want to bath her either.’ I said this quickly because Icould see he had his heart set on a three-part orgy.‘You won’t go away?’‘No. I’ll wait.’‘I’ll leave the door open.’ He rushed off into the bedroom, and I saw him flinghimself on her again. I thought she raised her knees to receive him. I went andfound a bottle of wine in his cupboard, and poured myself a large glass. Thesounds from the bedroom left no doubt he was enjoying it. They were interspersedwith groans, and comments like: ‘Oo . . . oh, you little bitch . . .’ Finally,the noises stopped. I went on eating cheese and olives, and reading a copy ofWaite’s Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross which I found on his bookshelf. I began tofeel sleepy. It would be untrue to say I was not, to some extent, sexuallyaroused. The girl’s extreme passivity had aroused my curiosity, and curiosityabout a girl is very close to the desire to take off her clothes. Now as I satin the armchair, the memory of her torn panties and exposed genitals came backand produced excitement. Under different circumstances, I could have made loveto her. What put me off was the personality of Clive Bates, and his attempt toenroll me as a co-rapist.It was after midnight and I thought of returning to my hotel. There weremovements from the bedroom, but I did not look up. Then Clive Bates was standingon the rug, completely naked, holding the girl in his arms again.‘I’ve brought her for you.’‘That’s kind, but I have to go.’‘Oh no, don’t go.’ He knelt down, and laid her on the white bearskin rug, at myfeet. She was also quite naked now. The pubic hairs were a reddish-gold colour,and some of them clung wetly to her skin. Then he went out of the room. I bentover and touched her arm. I said: ‘Are you awake?’ She made no movement. Therewas water running in the bathroom. A few minutes later, Clive Bates came out ofthe bathroom, carrying a red plastic bucket with steam coming from it.‘What are you doing?’‘I’m going to give her a bath.’The water was scented. He took a sponge out of it, squeezed it, and then soapedit with a great cake of lemon-coloured bath soap. He parted her thighs, andbegan carefully to wash her, ignoring the water that ran on to the rug. Then hetook a towel and dried her. After this, he carefully washed her breasts, thenher belly, thighs and knees. Then he turned her on her face, parted the cheeksof her behind, and repeated the operation. When he had dried her, he bent downand kissed it, then looked up and said: ‘There, it couldn’t be cleaner.’‘All she needs now are some clean clothes.’‘Oh, I expect we can arrange that.’He stood up.‘There, she’s all yours.’He turned and walked out of the room, and closed the bed­room door. It was atemptation. Watching him caress her with the sponge had given me an erection. Ibent over, and touched her breast. It was cold. I stood up and crossed to thebookcase, then tiptoed to the bedroom door and pushed it open. There was athump, and Clive Bates was sitting on the carpet, looking bewildered. Hiserection was back again. I said: ‘Excuse me. I just wanted to get something tocover her.’ I went to his bed, took off the eiderdown, and went back to the girlon the hearth­rug. As I covered her over, I thought I noticed a smile on herlips.I heard the bedsprings creak in the other room; I sat down and opened Waite onthe Rosicrucians. Then I got sleepy, and must have dozed off; I woke up when thebook slipped off my knees. I looked at the clock; it was two thirty. Suddenly,Florence sat up. She looked at the eiderdown.‘That was nice of you.’‘Not at all.’ We both spoke in low voices.She said: ‘Well, I s’pose I better go.’‘Like that?’‘No.’She went across to an antique chest of drawers in the corner, and pulled oneopen. She began to toss underwear on to the floor. She pulled open the bottomdrawer, and took out a pair of shoes. I said:‘You’ve been here before?’‘Abaht once a week on average.’Without embarrassment she climbed into a suspender belt—this time, one thatlooked new and fashionable—and then pulled on stockings. After this, she pulledon panties, and slipped into a bra, which she asked me to hook. I crept over tothe bedroom door and looked in, but this time there was no doubt that CliveBates was fast asleep. Florence had pulled on a nylon waist slip of the samepastel shade as the bra and panties; to my inexperi­enced eye, it lookedexpensive. She went to a cupboard near the door and took out a long plastic bagon a hanger, which proved to contain a lime-green two-piece suit. She went tothe mirror over the fireplace and brushed her hair with a brush she had takenfrom the drawer; her hair was now dry, and when brushed, it was the samered-gold I had noticed elsewhere. She made up her face with a few pats of apowder puff and strokes of lipstick. When she turned, I hardly recognised her.She still looked young; but I would now have guessed her age at twenty. She worethe well-cut clothes as if she was used to them.‘Ready?’‘Er . . . yes.’Out of the hall cupboard she took an overcoat that matched the suit, and anumbrella of the same colour. Finally, she settled a small red beret on the sideof her head. She switched off the electric fire, then the light, and we wentout, closing the door softly behind us.I asked: ‘Where do you live?’‘Oh, I shan’t go back. You at the Shelbourne?’‘Yes.’‘I’ll come back there and see if they’ve got a room. I can’t be bothered to goout to Malahide.’Her accent was still recognisably London, but no longer cockney.It had stopped raining, and we walked back through the empty streets. I askedher if she had ever known Clive Bates’s grandfather.‘Oh yes. He used to live out at Malahide. That’s where I met Clive. The oldboy’s just as bad.’‘In what way?’‘He likes ’em young. He used to leer at me when I was only ten.’She seemed quite willing to talk, and she talked casually, in a business-likeway, not as though she was making revelations. Clive had seduced her when shewas twelve—that is, he had offered to give her the money for an expensivebicycle if she came to his room half an hour after school for a few days. Shewas the illegitimate daughter of a bus conductress, and was badly dressed andunderfed. Although she did not say so plainly, it was fairly evident that Clivewas attracted by the torn clothes and runny nose. The loss of her virginity wasa painful shock. Clive had treated her very well, soothed and caressed her, madeher feel confident. Then one day, after he had carefully undressed her andsmeared her with olive oil, he suddenly drove with all his might and removed hermaidenhead with one violent stroke. She screamed and cried for half an hour,until he went down­stairs and brought up the bicycle she had wanted for so long.The appointments in Clive’s room continued, and the old man soon joined in. Theypaid her well, and the old man talked to her mother about adopting her. Themother knew what was going on, of course; but the money was too good to reject.Clive’s only objection was that she spent too much money on clothes. It was partof his fantasy that she should be a shabby urchin. He used to wander round thesecond-hand clothes bar­rows on the quays and buy up grubby clothes. These wouldarrive in the post, together with a short note telling her where to meet him,and at what time. She had to be picked up, and to behave as if she had neverseen him before. Whenever possible, he brought someone else along, and enactedthe curious rape scene that I had witnessed. I asked her if his friends everaccepted the invitation to possess her while she was apparently unconscious. Shesaid:‘Oh yes. You’re only the second who’s refused.’‘What happens then?’‘Oh, you’d be surprised. Sometimes they get so worked up watching one anotherthey carry on all night. If I’m lucky, the two men take a fancy to each otherand leave me alone.’‘Is Clive homosexual, then?’She said: ‘Oh, he’s everything.’The desk clerk seemed to know her; she took the key, and we went upstairstogether. On the second floor, where our ways parted, she said: ‘Shall I comeand talk to you?’ I knew what she meant. I said: ‘I think you ought to get somesleep. You’ve had a hard night.’ She grinned at me. ‘You’re nice. I wouldn’tmind . . .’ She stood on tiptoe and put her arms around my neck. I kissed her,and felt a sudden stirring. She said: ‘Goodnight’, and walked off down thecorridor. I repressed the desire to follow her, and went to my own room. Beforegoing to bed, I took half a dozen vitamin B tablets and drank a pint of water.It made no difference. I woke in the morning with a dry mouth and a head thatthrobbed like a dynamo.Two cups of coffee and some hot buttered toast made me feel more human. I sat inbed, reading the morning paper and wondering if a trip to Malahide Castle wouldbe worth the time and energy, but more tempted to put the ‘Do not disturb’notice on my door and sleep for the rest of the morning. The telephone rang, andit was like a circular saw cutting into my fragile con­centration. I wondered ifit was Clive Bates, and was tempted not to answer it. It rang again, and Ipicked it up. A man’s voice said: ‘Mr Sorme?’‘Speaking.’‘This is Alastair Glenney. You wrote to me.’I said: ‘Good heavens. How d’you do? It’s kind of you to call.’‘Your wife told me you were at the Shelbourne. Look here, what are the chancesof your coming to London?’‘It’s possible. What had you in mind?’‘It’s rather long to explain over the phone. But I’m absolutely fascinated byall this stuff about Esmond. I’ve got an idea I might be able to help. You knowGolspie was sold?’‘No, I didn’t.’‘I’m afraid so. Two years ago. They forwarded your letter. My elder brother waskilled in Switzerland—drowned in a boat­ing accident. Things turned out to be socomplicated—death duties and all that—that we decided to sell Golspie. It’sowned by a Canadian called Miller. I know there are great chests full of papersthere. And of course, they still belong to me.’‘Do you have access to them?’‘Oh yes. This Miller’s quite a decent chap. If you could get to London, we couldboth go up there.’I thought quickly.‘When would you be free?’‘Any time at all. I’m not working at the moment.’‘If I took a plane to London today, would you be free?’‘Oh yes, definitely. I’d be delighted to see you.’I took his telephone number, told him I’d ring him back, and hung up. First, Irang the airport. There was an Aer Lingus flight at twelve thirty-five, and Iwould have to be at the airport half an hour earlier to pick up my ticket. Iconfirmed the book­ing, then rang the desk to ask for my bill. After that, Irang Diana, but could only get on to Mopsy, who had been left in charge of thecleaning woman while Diana went to have her hair done. I told her to tell herMummy I would be flying to London and would ring later. Then I rang AlastairGlenney back, and said I’d be at Heathrow at 1.45. It was a rush, and my headthrobbed warningly, but I made it, scrambling on to the plane five minutesbefore take-off. I dozed during the trip, and woke up suddenly as the pilotannounced our landing.In the airport building, a voice over the loudspeaker asked if Mr Sorme would goto the Aer Lingus desk. I went there, and found a tall, fair young man waitingfor me.‘Mr Sorme? I’m Alastair Glenney.’He was younger than I had assumed—hardly out of his teens; his hair was long,and the blue jeans and donkey jacket were not what I would have expected on apeer of the realm. He was extremely good-looking; with shorter hair, he couldhave made a fortune as a male model.I said it was kind of him to meet me. He said:‘Not at all. If you hadn’t come to London, I’d have come to Ireland.’We walked about a mile to where his mini-minor was parked. On the way back intoLondon, he amplified what he had told me over the phone. His brother Gordon haddied at the age of twenty-eight, a year after getting married. They were thelast surviving Glenneys, and Golspie had become the joint property of hisbrother’s wife and Alastair, who was still at St Andrews. Death duties wereheavy, and when Gordon’s affairs were settled, there was little left but GolspieHouse (although Alastair had an independent income that came from agrandmother). Golspie was a white elephant, and the agent told them it washardly worth the trouble of selling—that the price it would fetch would hardlycover the legal costs. Nevertheless, they decided to sell. And within a fewweeks they received an incredibly large offer from a Canadian businessman whowanted a ‘Scottish castle’ to retire to. They closed the deal quickly; Alastairdecided this was the time to try to realise his ambition of forming a popsinging group, and moved to London. The group had not materialised, and he wasliving quietly in Holland Park and studying photography in the hope of becominga Press photographer.I asked him how he had become interested in Donelly.‘I think I’d better let Angela explain that. That’s my sister-in-law—Gordon’swife. She’s waiting back at the flat.’I must admit that I experienced a certain disappointment. Alastair Glenney wasobviously a pleasant young man, but he hardly seemed to fit into my search forDonelly. But I thought that it would add a touch of irony to my Introduction toMemoirs of an Irish Rake to mention that the present Lord Glenney was anunsuccessful pop singer who hoped to get into journalism. At least he seemed tobe interested in his family’s history; he outlined what had become of them inthe nineteenth century, and how Lord Alexander Glenney—his grandfather—hadmarried an American heiress in 1901 and temporarily restored the familyfortunes. His father had reduced them again by living in London and keeping halfa dozen mistresses.We arrived at his flat at about half past three. It was a soft, goldenafternoon, and I experienced a sudden sense of well-being as I stood on thepavement in Holland Mews and watched him lock the car. A girl stood at thewindow watching us, and he waved to her. ‘That’s Angela.’Angela Glenney was somehow very Scottish—slim, pretty, lively, withclose-cropped hair and a slightly freckled face. She wore a long woollen sweaterthat came almost to her knees, and jeans.‘Would you like tea? Or a drink?’I said I’d prefer tea at this hour. They both went into the kitchen, and Iglanced at the books on the shelves, and at the pictures. It was clear thatAlastair Glenney had brought them from Golspie: there was a fine set of Scottand John Galt in the original editions, and a great many other Scottish writersof whom I had never heard. The bookplates said Horace Glenney, but from thedates this was evidently the son—Esmond’s literary executor.In the corner of the bookshelf I saw a book called Letters from a Mountain, byReginald Smithson. The title page showed no publisher or date, but someone hadwritten ‘1780’ on a flyleaf. There was a design on the title page—of a mountainwith a bare tree, and an antelope. Something about it struck me as oddlyfamiliar. I felt suddenly dizzy, and sat down, closing my eyes. It seemed thatmy hangover was still with me. When I closed my eyes, the dizziness becamealmost vertiginous, so I opened them and stared again at the book. Then, withsudden clarity, I knew what was happening. I was ‘becoming’ Esmond again. Butthis time, I was not seeing the world with his eyes. It was as if we weresharing my head, and seeing things with an effect of double exposure. But I nowknew why the book was familiar. I had seen it before. It brought a sense offoreboding. Something unpleasant had been associated with it.I stared with sudden shock. The door opened, and Horace Glenney came in,carrying a tray. He looked at me, then said:‘Are you all right?’The double-exposure effect ceased, and I recognised Alastair Glenney. I said:‘Yes, I’m rather hung over, that’s all.’He looked at the book in my lap.‘Oh, you know that?’‘No.’Angela came in, and he said:‘Isn’t that amazing, Angy? He’s found the Letters from a Mountain. Doesn’t thatprove something?’They had made sandwiches, and I realised I was hungry. As I ate, the last tracesof the dizziness vanished. I was completely myself again. Three cups of hot teacompleted the cure. While I ate, she told me why they were interested in EsmondDonelly. After her husband’s death, Angela had decided to complete theuniversity course she had abandoned to get married. She enrolled at Edinburgh;her teacher was Professor David Smellie, the biographer of James Hogg, theEttrick Shepherd. When Smellie discovered that Angela was Lady Glenney, he waspleased and excited. He was writing a history of the Edinburgh Review, andGlenney had been one of the original contributors. He had been recruited by DrGilbert Stuart, a man whose chief personal characteristics were envy andrancour. The sharpness of its tone made the Review an immediate success when itsfirst issue came out in June 1773: Glenney contributed an excellent criticalarticle on Lord Momboddo, and a rather harsh review of a history by Dr Henry,one of the most successful Scottish writers of the day. Then, apparently,Glenney—like a great many other people—began to feel that all this bitternessand satire was point­less, and wrote Stuart a long letter—October1773—explaining his feeling that the Review ought to aim at being moreconstruc­tive; that there was, after all, some merit in Henry, Robertson, Blairand various others whose reputations had been scourged in its pages. Stuartwrote a friendly and reasonable reply, but then seems to have suspected thatGlenney had been ‘influenced’ by Henry or Blair, and wrote a second letter inwhich he called Glenney ‘an ecclesiastical lapdog’ (Henry was a ‘Reverend’).The remainder of the story can be found in Isaac D’Israeli’s Calamities andQuarrels of Authors. In November, the Scots Magazine (a rival) produced abrilliant defence of Henry and Robertson, which included a skilful and deadlyattack on Stuart. D’Israeli quotes this at length. In the pages of the Review,Stuart asserted that the author of the attack—signed ‘E.D.’—was Horace Glenney.Glenney replied immediately by letter, telling Stuart that while he approved ofevery word of the attack, its author was actually his friend Esmond Donelly. Theresult of this letter was a murderous review of Donelly’s Observations uponFrance and Switzerland in the February issue of Stuart’s magazine. D’Israelistates that Glenney wanted to challenge Stuart to a duel, but was dissuaded byDonelly.The battle rumbled on, even after Stuart’s magazine had col­lapsed. Stuart wentto London, and contributed periodically to The Gentleman’s Magazine. And it wasin that magazine, in June 1781, that there appeared a brief but vicious reviewof Letters from a Mountain, that described it as the ‘vapours of a mindunbalanced through lewdness and enthusiasm’. In the next issue of the magazine,it was announced that the author of the Letters from a Mountain was actuallyHorace Glenney.Stuart died five years later, at the age of forty-four—embit­tered, seethingwith hatred, convinced that his enemies had conspired to ruin him.This was the story told to me by Angela Glenney. It would have excited me morethan it actually did if I had not been so tired. Every time she mentioned HoraceGlenney, I looked at Alastair Glenney, and wondered if it was true that heresembled his ancestor. If he did, then I had my proof that I was in some kindof psychic contact with Esmond. When she finished, I asked if there was aportrait of Horace Glenney at Golspie.‘Oh yes.’‘What does he look like?’They looked at one another and laughed. Angela said:‘Terribly like Alastair. That’s why he’s so interested in him!’So there could be no possible doubt. Instead of feeling excited, I felt oddlyoppressed.I picked up Letters from a Mountain. ‘What is it about?’‘Oh, it’s a most weird piece of work. Dr Smellie thinks the form is influencedby Goldsmith’s Citizen of the World. It’s really a kind of Gothic novel—ratherlike Walpole’s Castle of Otranto. It’s really quite amazing for its period—whenyou consider that Mrs Radcliffe and Maturin hadn’t started writing.’‘Could you give me an outline of the plot?’‘It’s about two friends called Rodolpho and Conrad. They’re a sort of David andJonathan. When they fall in love with the same girl, each tries to persuade herto accept the other. They go to university together, and swear eternalfriendship and blood-brotherhood—you know the kind of thing. Then one day, whenhe’s standing in a bookshop, Rodolpho gets approached by a mysterious Moor namedAbdallah Saba, who offers to tell his fortune. He tells him that he’s destinedto be one of the rulers of the world, and invites him back to his home. Rodolphogoes—in spite of the warnings of Conrad—and falls in love with a girl calledNouri, who’s supposed to be Abdallah’s daughter . . .’ At this point, Alastairinterrupted: ‘Surely he doesn’t want to hear every blessed word of the stuff.’I assured him that I did. Angela went on. The Moor gets Rodolpho involved inmagic ceremonies involving a great crystal globe. They stand on top of a towerin the light of the full moon, and Rodolpho looks into the globe. He sees avulture that looks at him with yellow eyes, then suddenly seems to hurl itselftowards him. Rodolpho is saved from falling off the tower by Nouri. She thenbecomes his mistress and promises to marry him if his family will give theirconsent. She confesses that Abdallah is not her father, and that it is all aplot to involve Rodolpho in a terrible secret society that plans to destroyEurope.The next day, he finds that Nouri and her ‘father’ have left. He is in despair,and searches everywhere for them. One day, in an old church, he sees the figureof a vulture cast in bronze, and buys it for a few crowns. Then he writes atravel book, describing the places he has visited in his search for Nouri, andhas the cover embossed with the symbol of the vulture. A few weeks later,Rodolpho receives an envelope containing the symbol of a vulture, and a noteordering him to destroy every copy of his travel book. He does this by settingfire to the London warehouse of his publisher, and several people die in thefire, which spreads to adjoining houses. When this is done, the Moor contactshim again, and he is able to rejoin his lady love. Now he becomes a full memberof the evil secret society known as the Order of the Vulture. They feel thatNouri is a bad—or rather, a good—influence on him, and she is ordered torenounce him. She refuses, and is murdered. Rodolpho, now completely in thepower of the Order, accepts a mistress called Fatima, who is also a witch. . . .It would be tiresome to summarise the rest of the novel, which is confused andmelodramatic. There can be no doubt that it owes a great deal to The Castle ofOtranto, and that, in turn, it influenced Mrs Radcliffe and Maturin. Rodolpho istempted to do more and more evil deeds, in spite of Conrad’s attempts to savehis soul. Finally, he is ordered to murder Conrad. But this is too much. TheDavid-and-Jonathan bond is too strong, in spite of the years. At the lastmoment, Rodolpho throws down the dagger, and he and Conrad embrace. Rodolpho isin despair at his evil deeds, and they decide to go to Mount Athos to ask forpenances. On the last stage of their journey, Rodolpho is awakened in the nightby the voice of the dead Nouri. He gets up to follow it, and falls over a cliff.When the body is found, the face is so horribly contorted that the monks refuseto have it buried in holy ground, declaring that the corpse is obviously that ofa demon. Conrad himself buries it in the middle of a barren steppe, then goes onto Mount Athos, where he writes his story—in the form of a series of letters toa father confessor. As Angela Glenney summarised the plot, my fatigue vanished. I knew now that myinvestigation had taken a crucial turn. The most important piece of the jigsawpuzzle had fallen into place. I knew that Esmond had, in fact, received thesketch of a phoenix soon after publishing the Observations in 1771. I knew thatthe complete edition had been destroyed in a fire at the London warehouse of hispublisher. Now it was impossible to doubt that Esmond had been approached bysome envoy of the Sect of the Phoenix in 1771. At the same time, the rest of thestory could not be taken seriously. Esmond was not plunged into evil ways afterthat date. He and Glenney remained on close terms for years after, and the ScotsMagazine article of 1774 revealed that he was still an avid reader of sermons.It was not until nearly ten years later that Glenney wrote the Letters from aMountain.I owed this vital clue to Alastair and Angela Glenney. There­fore, it was clearthat I owed them the full story of my own researches. So when Angela said: ‘Now,what have you dis­covered about Esmond Donelly?’, I suggested we have a whisky;then I told them the full story, as I have written it here. It took three hours,and I finished it in a restaurant in Notting Hill Gate over dinner. I hadEsmond’s journals with me, as well as Glenney’s letters; I was glad of them, forthere were times when the whole thing sounded so absurd to me that it was arelief to convince myself it was not an involved dream. Angela listened withoutsaying much, her eyes never leaving my face. Alastair kept saying: ‘My God’, andwalking up and down the room. As we walked to the restaurant, he said: ‘Yourealise this is the biggest literary discovery since the Dead Sea Scrolls?’, andit sounded so funny that Angela and I both started to laugh.But it was when I told them that Esmond had appointed Horace Glenney’s son ashis literary executor that they became really excited. They had been hoping tofind some of Glenney’s material at Golspie; now it seemed possible that theymight find some of Esmond’s papers there too. Angela pointed out that Alastaircould be regarded as Esmond’s literary executor, since he was a directdescendant of Horace Glenney, and there were no Astons left alive. That meantthat if more Donelly papers were published, Alastair and Angela could share theprofits. I already had more than enough material for my own edition of Memoirsof an Irish Rake.We sat up until two in the morning talking about Esmond and Horace Glenney. Thechief regret, naturally, was that neither of them had taken any interest inGlenney before selling Golspie House. Angela remembered that her husband hadshowed her a room at Golspie where a murder had taken place—a man had been founddead under mysterious circumstances. Alastair thought he recalled something ofthe sort too; but when she described the room, it was not the one he rememberedas the ‘murder room’.I slept the night on a bed-settee in the sitting room; Angela was occupying thebed in the guest room. Alastair wanted to leave for Scotland the next morning,but Angela said she had some research to do at the Museum. I decided that Imight as well go with her. I spent the morning there, and found the ‘Martell andSmithson’ pamphlet on the Sect of the Phoenix. Tim Morrison was embarrassed whenI pointed it out to him, and said that he had overlooked it because its titlerefers to the ‘Society of the Phoenix’. To make up for the oversight, he had thepamphlet photostatted for me, so I was able to take a copy away.Angela and I ate lunch in a Greek restaurant near Cambridge Circus. I remarkedat one point that it was kind of them to trust me in this way. After all, wewere technically rivals. Sooner or later—probably sooner—they would havesearched Golspie House for the Glenney papers, and then the discovery—assumingthey made one—would be entirely theirs. She said:‘No. I’m glad you joined us. We both trust you.’I said thank you. She said:‘In fact, I’m delighted you came along. You know, Alastair used to adore hisbrother Gordon. It was Alastair who persuaded me to marry Gordon, in fact. Hewent on about his virtues at such length that I had to meet him. I wasAlastair’s girlfriend first, you know.’‘Didn’t he feel hurt when you married Gordon?’‘Oh no. He was delighted. You see, it brought him closer to Gordon—it meant he’dreally given Gordon something important. Anyway, what I started to say was—Ithink he’s inclined to look up to you as he did to Gordon.’‘But he’s only known me twenty-four hours.’‘That makes no difference. The odd thing is, you’re rather like Gordon,physically.’She stopped, and I thought she reddened. She drank a gulp of lager to cover itup. I saw what she was thinking: that if Alastair had presented her to Gordon,then I might be regarded as the next in the line of succession. We changed thesubject and talked about Donelly. Then I remembered something I had forgotten tomention: the letter from Klaus Dunkelman. I had his address and telephone numberin my address book. She said:‘Why not ring him? He might be interesting.’‘I suppose I ought to.’I went to the restaurant phone. A woman with a foreign accent answered, andsounded hostile until I mentioned my name. Then she became very friendly,introduced herself as Annaliese Dunkelman, and began to talk at length about mybooks. Finally, her husband came on the phone; he asked me if I could join themfor supper. I said I might be engaged then, but asked if I could go around laterthat afternoon. We made a date for four o’clock.I was not entirely happy about this development. It sounded as if it might be adead-end. But Angela said: ‘Good, he sounds interesting. Do you mind if I cometoo?’We spent another hour in the Museum; then, since the after­noon was so pleasant,decided to walk up towards Hampstead. We strolled up through Bloomsbury as faras Camden Town, then took a bus to Belsize Park. The Dunkelmans’ address was inKeats Grove.The door was opened by a tall, thin man with very thick glasses that made hiseyes seem distant and strange, like an octopus looking out of an aquarium. Helooked a little surprised to see Angela, but invited us in cordially. Wefollowed him along a corridor into a large sunlit studio. The floor was coveredwith stone dust, and there were huge Amazonian statues of women with massivebreasts and buttocks. A big, grey-haired woman put down her hammer and chisel tocome and greet us. She shook my hand enthusiastically, with a grip like alobster, and nodded perfunctorily at Angela. She was less tall than her husband,but built like a wrestler, and her arms—with the sleeves rolled up above theelbow—gave the impression that she could have felled any one of us with astroke. Her German accent was thicker than her husband’s, and I shall not try toreproduce it here, or its curious syntax. She placed a hand on my shoulder.‘Good, I have been waiting very impatiently. Ever since I read your Sex Diary Ihave wanted to meet you. Come along to my den.’ She turned to Angela and smiled.‘Do you mind? I want to talk to him alone. Klaus will show you the garden.’Angela was too surprised to object. And Frau Dunkelman grabbed my arm in a gripof iron, and steered me up a flight of stairs. I caught Angela’s eye for amoment, and she raised her eyebrows and bit her lower lip.Anna—as she insisted I call her immediately—led me into a small, comfortableroom that smelt of tobacco. On the sideboard there were three gallon bottlescontaining, respectively, gin, whisky and brandy. She offered me a drink, but Isaid it was too early. She poured herself an enormous gin, and filled it to thetop with tonic. Then she lit a cigarette in a holder that must have been a footlong, and flung herself into a deep armchair, crossing her knees. I have toadmit that her legs were not bad. At the same time, it made me uncomfortable tobe able to see so much of her at such short notice, for the short tweed skirtshe was wearing hardly reached the tops of her stockings when she was standingup. She indicated that I should sit in the chair opposite, which left me noalternative to contemplating her.‘Yes, you have great penetration for such a young man. How old are you? Really?You look much younger. When I read your book I said to Klaus: “Ah, what a pityhe does not live in London. There is so much we could teach him.” And now youare only here for one day! How preposterous! What can you do in one day?’She told me that my books all showed considerable intelligence, and greatintuition, but that what I lacked was experience. ‘You must not be offended if Itell you that in many ways you are immature.’ I said I wasn’t offended. Then,without explaining the transition, she began to speak about her ownqualifications for teaching the young. ‘I should be a schoolteacher like mymother. But I have no patience with large groups of students. What I would likeis two or three brilliant ones. I am creative, you see. My hands have to shapestone and clay, my mind has to shape souls.’ She stared at me penetratingly.‘Now I want to ask you a frank question. When you make love to a woman, can youhold back your climax until you have given her all the pleasure she needs?’ Ithought of Diana, and said I thought so. ‘No, no, that is not what I want tohear. I want a truthful answer. You must think of me as a doctor—as if I wasyour psychoanalyst . . .’ She took a long swallow of gin, reached out for afresh cigarette, and uncrossed her legs. It was hard to keep my eyes on herface. She glanced away for a moment, then looked back quickly, evidently hopingto catch me peeping. Then she leaned her head back against the cushion, her faceto the ceiling, and closed her eyes. I wondered whether this was some kind oftest. She was wearing panties that might have been made of pink cellophane, andshe was facing me with her feet on a leather pouffe, her knees spread apart, sothat without any effort I could see the open lips of the vulva, and the entranceto the vagina. She had no pubic hairs—she had obviously shaved them off. Herlegs and her bottom were shapely. But the powerful arms, the big shoulders, thegrey hair, made it seem as if she was some mythological monster, with a top halfthat didn’t belong to the bottom. I deliberately looked away towards the emptyfireplace, and kept my eyes there. She was saying:‘I sense that you are an extremely shy person who tries to cover it up. In this,you are rather like Klaus. Klaus is my son, of course.’‘Your son?’ I was astonished.‘Not literally. I mean that our relationship is mother and son. I am thecreative one, the earth mother, like Erda in Wagner. Our relationship is veryclose. I am his teacher. If you ask him, he will tell you that he has become adifferent person since he has known me—more profound, more sensitive. I havethis power to communicate my own talents to those I love. And when I say love, Imean, of course, the love of teacher and student, for there is none deeper thanthis . . .’Periodically, I glanced at her, to discover that she had sunk even lower in thechair, so that she was lying in the coital position. But she talked on without asign of embarrassment, as if she was standing in front of a class of studentsand discussing a diagram on the blackboard. What she seemed to be asking—in acomplicated and discursive way—was whether I would like to join Klaus as one ofher students, to absorb the benefit of her knowledge and creative talent. Shewas explaining to me the difference between the male and female intellect, whenthere was a gentle knock at the door. She ignored it and went on talking. Iexpected her to close her legs, or at least sit more upright, but she remainedcompletely unmoved. Klaus looked into the room.‘Are you coming downstairs, schatz?’‘In a moment.’ From where he was standing, his view of her genitalia was lessintimate than mine—I could have leaned for­ward and inserted a finger—but stillcomprehensive. He showed no surprise. ‘The young lady would probably like adrink too, and this room is too small.’ Then the footsteps of ‘the young lady’sounded on the stairs. I had to admire her timing. For a moment, I thought shemeant to lie there and allow Angela to join the spectators; but a few secondsbefore the steps reached the door, she yawned, closed her legs, and sat up.‘Come, then.’ She went to the door, and gave Klaus a playful but hard smack onthe rear. Then she beckoned to me, and we all trooped down­stairs. When her eyesfell on Angela, she frowned slightly, as if she was having difficultyremembering who she was, and then as if she had remembered and thought ‘Howtiresome’.We went into a larger room, furnished more formally. I accepted a small sherry;so did Angela. To my surprise, Frau Dunkelman now became very affable towardsAngela. Perhaps this was because Angela mentioned she had only met me the daybefore. She asked her how many of my books she had read; when she discovered theanswer was: ‘Hardly any at all’, she wagged her finger at her and told her thatshe should begin immediately. Now Angela was accepted into the flock as a‘student’, and lectured about creativity. Klaus sat in a corner, sipping tonicwater (‘He is not allowed to drink—it makes him sentimental’), and making noattempt to interpose. When Anna paused to take another drink, I asked him totell me something about Körner. He said quickly:‘I would not advise you to bother about him. He is a complete charlatan.’‘That is not quite fair,’ said his wife. ‘I agree that he has become acharlatan. But he was not always so.’ She addressed me. ‘Do you know aboutReich?’‘Not very much.’‘He was a great psychologist—as great as Freud. He believed that the only way tocreate a healthy society is to have people without sexual repressions.’‘That sounds like Freud.’‘Certainly. His basic ideas are very similar to Freud. His great contributionwas in the treatment of neurosis. He believed that repressions form a kind ofshell over the personality, like a tortoise, you know?’ She pulled a forbiddingface and made a motion with her hands to indicate armour plating. She pointed toher husband. ‘When I first met him, his face was like a mask—all the muscleswere tense. It was necessary to teach him to relax completely—to love hisgenitals.’Angela looked startled. I asked cautiously:‘In what way?’‘To be frank and open about his sexual functions. We used to hold therapy groupsin Stockholm. We would sit without any trousers or skirts, having a discussion,drinking coffee, and the men would be encouraged to play with their genitals,just like children. It was wonderful.’Klaus said solemnly:‘She used to come and sit beside me, and masturbate me while we discussed ourproblems. It was a great release—to learn not to be ashamed of genital play.When I was small, my nurse often beat me for touching my penis. Reich taught methat the penis is as much an instrument of social intercourse as the tongue orthe hands.’Anna, impatient of the interruption, thumped the arm of the chair with her fist,and said:‘If Reich’s theories had been properly understood, the last war would have beenimpossible. Hitler used sexual repression as a political weapon. The Germans arethe most repressed nation in the world. That is why they are so aggressive.’I asked: ‘And what about Körner? Where did he come in?’‘The groups in Stockholm were organised by Körner. He invented the notion ofgroup sexual expression, not Reich. Reich was still a little prudish, you know,and at this time he was already brooding on these mad ideas about orgoneenergy—you know, he thought he had discovered pure life-energy, and that it wasblue—he said it is orgone energy that makes the sky blue.’Klaus said gloomily:‘At this time, we believed that only Körner preserved the doctrine in itspurity. So when he came to London, we came with him.’‘And did you continue with your sexual self-expression groups?’‘Ach, yes, more than before. And that was the trouble. Reich warned us that ifwe were not careful, they would cease to have therapeutic value, and becomesexual orgies. Körner would not listen. He had a great obsessive idea—todisinfect the sexual impulse. That is how he put it. He said that sex must berid of all shame. After all, most sensitive people are socially shy. If theyhave to stand up on a stage and address an audience, they get stage fright. Butthey can get over this, and when they get over it, they express themselvesfreely, without fear. Körner wanted people to get over their sexual stagefright.’This was Klaus. His English was a great deal more fluent than his wife’s. Angelawas frowning. She said:‘But wouldn’t too much sexual freedom destroy all the fun?’‘No!’ They both shouted at once; Anna quelled her husband with a glance, andwent on determinedly:‘On the contrary, people are too ashamed to learn to enjoy sex. Why do you thinkthere are so many rapes and sex murders? Because there is a thick wall betweenthe sexes. A man gets on a bus, and sees a pretty girl, and he is like a foxwith a chicken. He does not rape her because there is no opportunity, andperhaps he is afraid of the law. This is not a natural relation between thesexes. All society is sex-starved. In a healthy society, he might sit beside heron the bus, and persuade her to masturbate him, without anyone paying anyattention. Why not? You’—her finger suddenly darted out at Angela, who wasleaning forward, her forearms on her knees. ‘Why do you sit in that position?You think it is natural. But it isn’t. You are wearing a mini-skirt because youthink it attractive. Why do you not open your knees boldly?’Angela, a little taken aback, tried to make a joke of it. ‘I might get raped.’‘No! That is not logical! Why do women wear short skirts? To interest the men.You play a game to see how high you can wear them. Do you not see what thismeans? You want to dis­play your genitals, but you are afraid. You want to makemen stare, but you are afraid of being raped. Is that not proof that there issomething wrong?’ Angela involuntarily tugged at the bottom of her mini-skirt.‘You see! Why do you wear it if you want to keep it down? Why do you not sitlike this?’ She leaned back in her chair and opened her knees, so that Angelagot the same view that I had had in the ‘den’ upstairs. Angela dropped her eyes.Anna, without closing her legs again, went on: ‘No! We must develop a societywithout sexual fears and inhibitions. If the young man on the bus wants to knowwhether you are wearing tights or panties, he should be allowed to look!’I interrupted, to divert attention from Angela:‘Why do you say Körner became a charlatan?’‘Because with a theory like that, it is possible to attract all the wrong peoplefor all the wrong reasons. That is what he has done. He says that his aim is totry to teach people to achieve mystical ecstasy through sex. But all he does isto organise petting parties.’It was difficult to stop the flow, which went on like this for half an hourmore. What she said struck me as good sense, to some extent. It is true thatmost people are obsessed with sex in a negative way. But when I thought of Dianaand Mopsy, and my study lined with books, it struck me that there are moreimportant things than sex. The ideal way to cure a man who is obsessed by sex isnot to tell him to masturbate on buses, but to get him to learn to enjoy musicand poetry and ideas. When I suggested this to the Dunkelmans, there was anoutburst of scorn. ‘That is merely what Freud called sublimation. It is arefusal to face the real problem. You suppress it and pretend to be inter­estedin something else.’I began to feel impatient. In any case, it was nearly seven, and Alastair wouldbe wondering where we were. I said we had to go. They tried to persuade us tostay to supper, but we excused ourselves. Anna said she would write me a longletter, and that perhaps I might help her with the writing of her book on sexualfreedom for all.As we stood up to go, Angela asked:‘By the way, do you know anything about the Sect of the Phoenix?’Anna shrugged.‘What is that? Some new fad of the young people?’It was obvious that the name meant nothing to her. Angela did not pursue thesubject. At the door, Dunkelman asked:‘You are leaving London tonight, yes?’‘Tomorrow.’‘I hope we shall meet next time you are here.’ He bowed stiffly. I said:‘I must also write to Professor Körner.’Anna said: ‘That would be no good. The police have ordered him to leave England.He is back in Germany.’‘Oh, I’m sorry. Why?’Klaus said: ‘He was nothing more than a professional brothel-keeper.’In the taxi, on the way back to Holland Park, Angela said: “You certainly seemto come across some astounding people. It’s really a pity we can’t meet DrKörner.’‘But it would probably be a dead-end. Admittedly, Dunkel­man told me it wasKörner who first mentioned Esmond Donelly, but I presume he’d simply read thebook on deflowering virgins.’We talked about the Dunkelmans. Angela said:‘I don’t think you’re right that Klaus is just a henpecked husband. I got a veryqueer feeling as he looked at me.’‘In what way?’‘I got a funny feeling that he was willing me to open my legs. You saw the way Iwas sitting—even his wife noticed it.’‘I suspect she’s half Lesbian, anyway.’‘I wouldn’t be surprised. I got a most unpleasant feeling talking with them. Didyou notice?’‘What kind?’‘Well—they’re so ugly, they’re really rather repellent when they go on aboutsex. And yet in another way, it has an odd fascination.’I knew what she meant. Until we went to the Dunkelmans, I had looked on Angelasimply as a rather pleasant, intelligent girl, but with no more sexual interestthan if she had been my sister. Now, sitting beside her, I found myself lookingat the curve of her breast under the black sweater, and having to repress adesire to fondle it. Anna Dunkelman had done this somehow, by direct­ingattention to Angela as a sexual object.She said suddenly: ‘I’m glad you were there’, and shivered, moving closer to me.It was natural to put my arm round her shoulder. A moment later, her face wasupturned to mine, and I was kissing her with a passion that startled me. It waslike taking a mouthful of food, and suddenly realising you are ravenouslyhungry. We clung tightly together, my tongue in her mouth, my hand crushing thebreast I had been looking at a moment earlier. There was not simply a desire tocaress her, but to hurt her, to squeeze her, to absorb her. She was clingingagainst me with complete abandonment, and when my hand moved downward, pressinghard against her ribs, then her stomach, her legs opened. My hand slid betweenthem, on top of the skirt, and pressed hard against her crotch; she gasped, andher mouth opened wider. Then my hand found its way under the mini­skirt, andinside her pants. I was in a state of acute discomfort, having got so far; thenatural thing would have been to remove the rest of her clothes and penetrateher. Since this was impos­sible, my body had become an iron bar of lust.The taxi hooted and swerved to avoid a car rushing the lights; we broke apartguiltily. She said: ‘I’m sorry.’‘Why?’‘That was my fault. I’ve been wanting you to do it ever since we left theDunkelmans.’We were still clinging together, and my heart was still pound­ing so hard that Icould hardly speak. She said:‘I’ve never done that before—not like that. I don’t know if you’ll believe me,but I’m quite a puritan inside.’I said, half-jokingly: ‘They’ve hypnotised us.’She looked at me seriously. ‘I think that might be it. I’m sure they have someodd power. I’ll tell you something that will shock you. If I’d been there alone,I’d have ended by giving myself to that awful Klaus.’I said, laughing: ‘If I’d been alone in that den for another ten minutes, I’dhave ended by making love to Anna.’‘But she’s so ghastly!’I told her about how she had sat with her legs open. It was true that afteranother five minutes, I would have obeyed the impulse to lean across and touchher, and then it would have been very easy to take out my erect penis and plungeit home. It would have seemed silly to refrain.The taxi stopped outside the house. She said:‘I’d better tidy myself up.’I knew what she meant. I also had the illusion that I was as dishevelled as if Ihad just crawled out of bed. I paid the taxi while she quickly added a touch oflipstick to her mouth and ran a comb through her hair.Angela opened the door with her key, and we went into the flat. Everything wasstill as we had left it that morning. She called: ‘Alastair.’ There was noreply. She shook her head and said: ‘No’, and I knew she was not commenting onAlastair’s absence. I put my hand on her breast. She said: ‘There’s not time.’But I knew she was not serious. I was still glowing with the curiously violentlust, which was almost feverish. I tugged the bottom of the sweater out of theskirt, and slid my hand underneath. She was wearing a cup-bra, and a slight tugexposed the breast. I took the nipple between my forefinger and thumb andpinched it. She moved into my arms, and her mouth opened again. I reached downfor the zip of her skirt and fumbled it undone. It dropped to the floor. Islipped my hands inside the elastic of the panties, and pushed them down as faras her thighs. Then I raised the black sweater; she lifted her arms, and let mepull it over her head. I undid the bra and it dropped to the floor. She stoodthere wearing a black suspender belt, the black panties around her knees. Herhand fumbled at the waist of my trousers, and I helped her undo it, and pushedthem down. We stood there, in the middle of her room, clinging together, bothhalf-naked. Then I stepped out of my trousers and under­pants, and led her tothe bedroom. As soon as I slipped into her, she groaned, and seemed to writheagainst me. I held her very close, and worked up and down with a steady,machine-like drive, one hand still on her breast. I had seldom known sex to beso vertiginous. I think that if a battery of photographers had appeared in thedoorway with flashlight cameras, we would have kept on making love, totallyunable to pull our bodies apart. The feverish sensation was still there, makingthe room unreal. We seemed to be all moisture. Our bodies perspired; themoisture from us ran down between her buttocks and on to the bed; our tonguesran in and out of each other’s mouths, so that our faces were wet; her breastsmade a squelching noise against my chest. It occurred to me that Alastair mightcome in at any moment, but there was a certain pleasure in the thought ofsomeone watching us. Then the pleasure was too exquisite to hold back; her bodyseemed to be begging me to pour the seed into her. We clung together, gasping,as the climax burst over us like a wave, and I felt the hot moisture gushingalong my member and into her. It seemed to go on for minutes. Then we relaxed,and I lay there, still inside her. A few minutes later, we lay side by side, andthe sweat felt cool. I opened my eyes and looked at her; and realised with ashock that this was Angela, the demure Scots girl who had struck me as ‘nice’but not my type. She opened her eyes, and looked startled to see me. Suddenly,we both remem­bered that half our clothes were lying in the other room, and thatthe door was open. I got up and went in to collect them. When I came back, shewas standing up, pulling on her panties. I went over to her and kissed her. Shegave me her mouth primly, as if it was a formal goodnight kiss. Then, as ifrepenting, she put her arms round my neck. She said:‘Whatever came over us?’I knew what she meant. It had not been ‘normal’ sex, the sex of two people whodecide they like one another and want to explore one another’s bodies. It hadbeen a kind of frenzy, as if we were two animals. And now I was ‘Mr Sorme’again, and she was Lady Angela Glenney, and we were two people who liked oneanother, but were not lovers. Except, of course, that it was impossible for usnot to be aware that we had just abandoned ourselves to one another.She said suddenly: ‘My God, I forgot. It’s the worst time of the month.’I placed my hand gently on her stomach. ‘Then there’s probably a little Sorme inthere.’‘Probably.’‘Do you mind?’She laughed suddenly.‘No. I don’t think so.’The telephone rang. It was Alastair, saying he was having a drink with some oldschoolfriends, and would not be back for another hour.Angela and I took a shower together. I felt oddly cool and fresh, totallyrelaxed. Every time I looked at Angela, I experi­enced a faint shock, as if whathad happened had been a sexual fantasy inside my own head.Half an hour later, as we sat on either side of the fire, sipping vodkamartinis, she said:‘I think they put something in the drinks.’‘An aphrodisiac, you mean? I don’t think so. Spanish fly has an irritatingeffect on the lining of the stomach—I once tasted some in Algiers.’‘But surely you don’t believe it was something psychic, do you?’I said: ‘I’ll tell you what I believe. I believe that Klaus wanted to make loveto you, and she wanted me to make love to her. If we’d stayed for supper, we’dhave finished up in bed with them. As it was, whatever they did to us made uswant one another.’ When I thought back on the fury of our lovemaking, I knewthere was something odd about it.She said: ‘It makes you wonder whether there’s really some­thing in thesestories about love potions—Tristan and Isolde, and all that.’‘I knew a man who could tell you—a man called Caradoc Cunningham.’‘Yes, I know about him. I read your book. I don’t think I’d like to meet him.’When Alastair came in half an hour later, she was cooking a meal, and the flatwas full of the fragrance of garlic and mint. He said: ‘I hope you didn’t gettoo bored without me.’ Angela said: ‘No, we found plenty to do.’ ‘To do?’ ‘Imean to talk about.’ He was joking, of course; he knew that neither Angela nor Iwere the type to become lovers within a few hours of meeting one another. In the night, I had disturbing dreams that I could not remember; but when I wokeup, I was Esmond again. This was the strangest sensation so far. I had drunk alittle too much Pommard after supper, and although I was not drunk, I had thatfeeling of slight separation from reality, of meaninglessness. On the otherhand, Esmond was wide awake. For him, this high-ceilinged room seemed familiarenough; the only slightly puzzling element was the occasional sound of a passingcar or lorry on the Holland Park Road. My sense of being back in the eighteenthcentury was stronger than it had been in Dublin, perhaps because there were nodistractions in the dark. I fell asleep again, and had confused dreams of HoraceWalpole, Lichtenberg, Boswell and Johnson. When I woke up in the morning, I hada very clear memory of Johnson saying emphatically—and spluttering with hislarge, pendulous lower lip: ‘The man is a lecherous rogue, sir, and you would dobetter to avoid him utterly.’We took a plane at 11.30, and were in Edinburgh an hour and a half later. We atelunch in the back room of a pub with Dr David Smellie, Angela’s professor, asmall man with a face like a terrier. He had once given one of my books aparticularly vicious review, so he smiled sheepishly when he was introduced tome; but when he made an oblique reference to the subject over lunch, I pretendedI had not seen it, and we got on well enough. There was no need for me to do agreat deal of talking—Alastair and Angela wanted to tell him all about EsmondDonelly, and my discoveries. He listened politely for a while, then said:‘I’m afraid I don’t see why you find him so interesting. It sounds to me as ifhe was a typical eighteenth-century rake. Did he ever think about anything butsex?’Angela looked at me; I think she was inclined to agree. I said:‘In a sense no. And in another sense, sex didn’t interest him at all.’He said snappily: ‘Isn’t that what is called casuistry?’‘No.’ He was unsympathetic, but I decided to try to explain. ‘I see Esmond as aman obsessed with the problem of meaning.’‘The meaning of what? Human existence?’ I recalled that he had made a number ofjeering comments in his review on what he called my ‘crypto-religiousobsession’. But I wanted to explain to the other two. I said:‘It’s a matter that either you understand or you don’t. To me, it’s aself-evident problem. Sometimes life is intensely interesting and meaningful,and this meaning seems to be an objective fact, like sunlight. At other timesit’s as meaningless and futile as the wind. We accept this eclipse of meaning aswe accept changes in the weather. If I wake up with a bad cold or a headache, Iseem to be deaf to meaning. Now if I woke up physically deaf or half­blind, I’dfeel there was something wrong and consult a doctor. But when I’m deaf tomeaning, I accept it as something natural. Esmond didn’t accept it as natural.And he also noticed that every time we’re sexually stimulated, meaning returns.We can hear again. So he pursued sex as a way of recovering meaning.’Angela asked: ‘How about Horace Glenney?’‘No, he wasn’t interested in Esmond’s search for meaning. He admired Esmond, buthe didn’t understand him.’‘Having read Of the Deflowering of Maids, I doubt whether there was anything tounderstand.” Smellie remained uncon­vinced. I said:‘I don’t believe Esmond wrote that book.’‘No? Then who did?’‘I don’t know. But the style isn’t Esmond’s.’He shrugged as if to say I could indulge in any fancies I liked, but it was noneof his business. I said:‘Do you happen to remember the date on the edition you saw?’‘Of course. 1790.’This excited me. The edition I had seen in Galway was printed in Leipzig in the1830s.‘Who printed it, and where?’‘There is no printer, but the university catalogue says it was printed privatelyin Edinburgh.’‘Are you sure?’‘I am not in the habit of confusing my facts.’ I recalled that this was anotherof his jibes, so I dropped the subject. But my cordiality as I shook his handhalf an hour later was not entirely feigned. Another piece of the puzzle hadfallen into place. And a suspicion I had already entertained began to seem lessabsurd. For assuming that the Deflowering of Maids was a forgery, who could havewritten it? Obviously, someone who was interested in making Esmond out to be arake and a writer of pornography. This might easily be Gilbert Stuart, who hadbeen friendly with Horace Glenney, and who had a motive for blackening Donelly’sreputation. But he was dead by 1786. That left only one obvious candidate:Glenney himself. And if the ‘Deflowering’ book was printed in Edinburgh, itbecame a distinct possibility.It was after four o’clock that we finally left Edinburgh in a hired car, andstarted on the long drive north—almost as far as from London to Edinburgh. Webroke the journey at Pitlochrie, and left early the next morning. By four thatafternoon we were on the last stage of the journey, from Dornoch to Golspie. Thewild, open moors and the sudden views of the sea were impres­sive; but whatreally occupied my thoughts was the sheer effort involved in making this samejourney in 1770—in a bumpy coach, over roads that were little better than dirttracks. Most of the people of Golspie had probably travelled no farther thanDornoch or Inverness. No wonder Horace Glenney was an object of such admirationwhen he returned from his European travels. We stopped in the village to ringFranklin Miller—the new owner of Golspie House—then drove on to the north-east.Golspie House stands on the slopes of Ben Horn, overlooking Loch Brora. As wedrove this last lap of the journey, I tried hard to relax, to see it withEsmond’s eyes; but it was no good. It was all too strange. The sight of thesquare, grey house brought a flash of recognition; but I could have beendeceiving myself.There was a great deal of scaffolding up at the front of the building; evidentlyits new owner was improving it. The drive had been tarmacked, and the lawnslooked well kept. It might have been an expensive hotel.Franklin Miller was a big, friendly man who looked as if he had been born to bea country squire. He seemed genuinely delighted to have us as guests. He led usinto the great library, where there was a huge log fire burning. We acceptedwhiskies, and met Mrs Miller, who begged us to stay for as long as we could.After walking around the grounds and down to the side of the loch, I asked if wemight spend an hour before dinner looking through the attic, where Alastair hadseen bundles of old papers. Our host told us to treat the house as if it hadnever changed owners, and went off to find out what his workmen were doing.‘I know where we can begin,’ Alastair said. ‘The family Bible. It lists thebirths and deaths of all the Glenneys of Golspie.’This was in the library, on a top shelf—a magnificent, shiny-leather thing thatweighed half a hundredweight. It was a ‘Great Bible’—the Cranmer version of1539. It struck me that it was probably worth nearly as much as Golspie House,but I didn’t like to say so. The half-dozen pages at the back were covered withwriting—page after page in illegible scrawl, written in faded ink, beginningwith an Alexander Gleinnie, who died in 1579 (before Shakespeare had leftStratford upon Avon), and who was apparently knighted by Henry VIII. TheGlenneys were raised to the peerage by James I. Sometimes, the dates werefollowed by the cause of death, ‘fever’, ‘cholick’, ‘of a twisted middle’(whatever that meant). There were several entries in the hand­writing Irecognised as Horace Glenney’s. His own name was followed by two dates: 1747,and 1796; but there was no men­tion of cause of death. His father died in 1778,upon which his brother Moray became Lord Glenney; Moray was killed ‘by a fallfrom a misen’ (mizzen mast?) in 1781, upon which his younger brother assumed thetitle.This at least was helpful; I now knew Horace Glenney’s dates. But not the causeof his death. I asked Alastair if he could remember which room had been showedto him as the ‘murder room’.‘Oh yes, of course.’ He led me out of the library, up the main staircase, andalong a corridor. He knocked on the door, then opened it. The room was nowapparently a guest bedroom; it overlooked the loch, and a workman was whistlingon the scaffold outside.Angela said: ‘This was definitely not the room Gordon showed me. That was in theother wing.’After some hesitation, we found this. It overlooked the back part of the house;there was a sheer drop outside the window to a small courtyard. It was a plain,cold room, and one wall was not panelled; the granite had been smoothed to forma flat sur­face. Angela pointed to a brown stain that ran down this to thefloor. ‘Gordon said that was a bloodstain—that he was lying in bed when someoneshot him from the doorway.’This was possible; it looked like a bloodstain. On the other hand, it seemed tome unlikely that the master of the house would sleep in a room like this. Whatwas more probable was that the bloodstain had led to the story of a murder.Three more flights of stairs took us to the attic, which proved so dark anddusty that Alastair went off to borrow a torch. Angela and I sat down on an oldchest, after I had brushed off the dust with my handkerchief. We were bothtired; it had been a long journey and we needed a good night’s rest. I put myarm round her shoulders, and she leaned her head against me. I let my cheek restagainst her hair, and closed my eyes. It was very quiet. There was no sound butthe hiss of the wind against the gables, and the distant chirruping of a bird.The feeling of her warmth against me was pleasant. And suddenly, withouttran­sition, I remembered. Or rather, Esmond remembered. The smell of dust wasfamiliar, and so was the smell of Angela’s hair. I realised what had been wrong.When we see new places, the mind finds them strange, and makes an effort tograsp them to adjust to them. It is this effort that destroys the instinctivefamiliarity of memory. I was so anxious to enter into the spirit of this house,to remember it, that I was forcing my own impres­sions upon it. Now, for amoment, I stopped seeing it as a strange place; I relaxed; and it was as if anold picture had superimposed itself on my new impressions of the house, and thenblended with them. I knew this place; I knew the loch and the hills and theglimpse of the sea down the valley. I also knew that Angela had been right. Theroom we had just seen was the one in which Horace Glenney was murdered. ButAngela was wrong in one respect; he had not been shot. He had been stabbed. Ifelt a curious certainty about this.Alastair came back with an enormous length of electric wire, and one of thosemetal cages with a bulb inside that car mechanics use. We attached the bayonetplug to a socket on the floor below, and hung the bulb over a low beam in theattic. Then we sur­veyed the place. Nothing was more obvious than that it hadnot been looked at for years. Alastair could not remember ever investigating itin his childhood. Everything was inches deep in dust and a kind of fluffy moss,and one half of the attic was closed off by a series of enormous spider websthat were so thick with dust that they made an opaque curtain. (I have oftenwondered how spiders make a living in closed attics.) There was obviously plentyto investigate, including a pile of broken bag­pipes. As soon as we movedanything the dust choked us. I broke the spider’s web with an old metal poker,and looked into the other part. There were all kinds of crates and boxes here,and piles of account books and bundles of paper. I tried undoing one of these,and it began to crumble away, just as if it was paper that had been made brittleby a fire. Other bundles were soaked through with a brown stain that made themillegible.After half an hour of this, we were all very thirsty, and had been sneezingsteadily about once a minute. Franklin Miller came up to investigate, lookedaround for a minute or two, then went away, after remarking: ‘Rather you thanme.’ Alastair said finally: ‘I think I’ll go down and have a beer. Anybodycoming?’ Angela said she was. I decided to stay on for a while, but five minuteswas enough. I began to think longingly of a long, cool pint in the local pub. Myeyes were smarting, and I was getting impatient, so that every time I moved Idisturbed more dust than was necessary. I felt as if I needed a good bath, andas if my hair was full of baby spiders. After pulling a huge chest out of itscorner, and struggling to undo a great leather strap that had hardened until itwas like steel, I moved over to the trapdoor to get a little fresh air. I satthere, yawning, think­ing that if Esmond intended to help me, now was the timeto get on with it. A spider walked over my neck, and I stood up so suddenly thatI hit my head on a beam, and sat down on the floor, with brilliant lightsflashing on and off. I sat there, staring up irritably at the spider that swungon a length of thread, sus­pended from a tattered diagram of an electricalcircuit that was pinned to the beam. It was the last straw. I climbed down theladder, and spent five minutes in front of an open window, brush­ing myself downand looking with envy at a man fishing from a boat in the loch.I reached up to unplug the attic light, when the thought suddenly struck me.Since there was no light in the attic, why was there a circuit diagram there? Iwent back up the ladder. I picked up a duster, and brushed away the spider’s webthat covered the sheet of paper. Now I looked closer, I saw why I had mistakenit for a circuit diagram. It was neatly drawn, with various small boxesconnected by lines. The boxes had letters written on them; and at the side ofthe sheet there was another list of letters, with writing beside each one. Isuspected what it was as I took it down; my intuition was working again. It wasso dusty that I could not read it in the dim light. I went down to the floorbelow, brushed it carefully with a clean handkerchief, and took it over to thewindow. It was a diagram—a diagram of the attic. If I had thought about it morecarefully, I would have noticed that the various chests and bundles in the atticwere laid out in a neat and orderly manner that suggested they had been arrangedby someone. And whoever had carefully arranged them had made this sketch to actas a key.Alastair called: ‘Are you coming down, Gerard? It’s dinner in half an hour.’I said: ‘Who was G. Rullion?’‘George Rullion? He was a sort of steward here in my grand­father’s time. Helived to be ninety-one in the gate lodge. Why?’I showed him the back of the diagram. The neat signature at the bottom read ‘G.Rullion’. I ran my finger down the list, and stopped opposite ‘K’: ‘Papers r. to9th Lord Glenney’. That was Horace Glenney. I turned the paper over. ‘K’ was aspace in a far corner of the attic.It proved to be an enormous tin chest, and the catch had rusted. We forced itopen with the poker. It was jammed with account books, letters, loose papers.Either it had been disturbed since ‘G. Rullion’ had filled it, or its contentshad been thrown in without much attempt at order. I opened a letter. It began‘My dear Mary’, and the contents seemed to be about some family problem relatingto the sale of a house in Guildford. I dipped into the chest, and opened severalothers at random. One was addressed to Miss Fiona Guthrie, and began ‘My dearMiss Guthrie’ and ended: ‘yours respectfully’. This was dated from Göttingen inAugust 1766—that is, a few months before the events he described in his letterto Esmond.Alastair and I tried to lift the chest down the ladder, but it was too heavy. Wedecided to leave it. We marched triumphantly down to the drawing room toannounce the discovery, and caused a gratifying amount of excitement. I leftthem to troop off to examine the chest, while I drank a glass of iced lager,then went and had a shower. When I rejoined them, they had piled bundles ofpapers and ledgers on the hearthrug, and were looking through them. I glancedthrough their finds, but could see nothing of importance.Dinner was half an hour late. We ate large amounts of pheasant and woodcock anddrank Beaujolais; after which we all became sleepy and retired to the lounge todrink coffee and watch the television news. At nine thirty, I asked if I mightuse the telephone; I had not contacted Diana since we left London.The line was a good one; I could hear her as clearly as if she was a mile away.I told her the news—that I had found some of Glenney’s papers, but nothing thatlooked promising. I asked her if she had any news.‘Not much. There’s a letter from a girl who wants you to go and live with her inMiami. And a man who wants you to write a book denouncing computers. And there’sa note from a man called Corner who says he’d like to meet you next time you’rein London.’‘How do you spell it?’‘K—O—R—N—E—R.’I shouted: ‘What! What’s his first name?’‘I can’t remember. Shall I find the letter?’‘Yes, please.’A few minutes later she was back, and reading it to me. It was Otto Körner, theman the Dunkelmans said had been deported. He was living in West Hampstead. Hesaid that he had read my letter about Esmond Donelly in The Times LiterarySupplement and that he would like to talk to me about him. He gave his telephonenumber.When she rang off, I rushed into the drawing room, chortling and waving thepaper with Körner’s address. I felt this was a major breakthrough—not so muchbecause I expected Körner to know anything about Esmond that I didn’t alreadyknow; but because I felt the gods were on our side. Miller was almost as pleasedas we were about it; he was beginning to get caught up in the ‘quest for EsmondDonelly’. He said: ‘Why don’t you call him right away?’ I needed no urging. Fiveminutes later, a voice that sounded like a comic German professor was sayingheartily:‘It iss very goot that you reeng, Mr Zorme. We haf much to discuss.’I said: ‘I saw the Dunkelmans in London two days ago. They told me you’dreturned to Germany?’‘What! They know that is not true! You must not trust them . . .’ He went on forten minutes about the Dunkelmans, frequently relapsing into German. He ended bystrongly advising me never to see them again. I wanted to find out what he hadagainst them, so I said mildly that they seemed a harmless couple. He shouted:‘What? Harmless? Why, that man is a murderer.’‘Are you sure?’‘Sure. He is a murderer. He marries a rich girl in Switzerland and boils herbody in a glue machine. At this time he is owner of a glue factory. He marriesthis girl—although he is already married—and after a few weeks, she disappears.Then a doctor analyses a sample of his glue and says it is made of human bones.But they cannot prove anything. He gets three years in prison for bigamy.’The story sounded so revolting as to be unbelievable. (In fact, I laterdiscovered that Körner had kept back the most horrible detail—that Klaus had cutoff her flesh with a razor in small slivers, and fed it to his pet piranhafish.) I talked to Körner for a few minutes longer, and promised to call on himon my way back to Ireland. He said: ‘Good. I hope you stay in London for a fewdays. I have much to tell you.’That sounded promising. I went back to give Angela the astonishing informationabout Klaus Dunkelman, and we ended by describing our visit in detail to ourhost and hostess. We omitted what happened after. I was so tired that I went to bed early. But I was awake at seven the nextmorning. Wearing my overcoat, I sat on a low stool in the attic, and carefullyremoved every bundle and ledger from the chest, placing loose sheets in a neatpile. I had been searching for half an hour when I came across the firstpromising find: a bundle of letters tied with a ribbon, and addressed in around, girlish hand to ‘Horace Glenney Esquire, Ferdinandstrasse 9 (der haus vonHerr Jülich), Göttingen’. These were letters written by Fiona Guthrie to HoraceGlenney, beginning in February 1767—a month after he had come close to seducingher. They were the letters of a girl in love; moreover, a girl who felt herselfto be engaged. The letters are full of gossip about her home, his sister Mary, adog he had given her. I found them pathetic to read because they made her real—aschoolgirl in love for the first time, a girl who has allowed her lover certainliberties because she can refuse him nothing, and who believes that he thinksabout her as continually as she thinks of him. One of them has a note from Mary:‘I hope the girls there are as ugly as donkeys.’ Horace seems to have replied atlength, and mentioned Esmond with too much enthusiasm, for Fiona writes: ‘I amsure your friend Esmond Donelly is a good and [illegible] student, but [I]really cannot admire him without having met him. . . . I would rather heardetails of your own doings.’ Apparently Horace spent too much time praisingEdmond.The following Christmas (1767) they seem to have had a quarrel about amaidservant: ‘I wish I could understand why you should want to touch so greasy acreature’: which no doubt explains why Fiona retained her virginity for anotheryear. It must have been a frustrating Christmas for Glenney after the failure ofhis attempted abduction at Osnabrück.I laid Fiona’s letters by for more careful study, and went on emptying thechest. Nearer the bottom, it seemed to be less dis­ordered, and account bookswere piled up in one corner. I took all these out and, when the last one hadbeen removed, saw a black metal box buried under bundles of paper. I tugged itout, and found it to be about eighteen inches long and nine inches deep. It wasunlocked. I opened it and found myself looking at a handwritten title page:‘Letters from a Mountain’, by George Smithson, D.D. I found the notebook I hadbeen using for my Donelly material. As I thought, the published edition ofLetters from a Mountain was by Reginald Smithson. But the pamphlet on the ‘evilSociety of the Phoenix’ was by Henry Martell and George Smithson, D.D. This waspublished ten years after the novel. Yet Glenney had changed the author’sChristian name. The inference was that Glenney had written the pamphlet beforethe novel, and had altered the name on the novel so as not to duplicate thatalready on the pamphlet.I picked up a handful of sheets at random and glanced through them. And almostimmediately, my eye caught the words ‘society of the phoenix’. I read thecontext. There could be no possible doubt; in the original manuscript—and theelisions and alterations made it clear that this was the original—Glenney hadreferred to the ‘Society of the Phoenix’, not, as in the published version, theOrder of the Vulture. Obviously, he had decided to change it—or been persuadedto change it. I took out the whole manuscript from the tin. The sheets on whichit was written were not regular in size; but the ones at the bottom were notablysmaller than the rest. Then I saw they were not part of the manuscript. Theywere in Esmond Donelly’s handwriting. The first one began: My dear Glenney,I beg you to believe me when I assure you, upon my most solemn word of honour,that you are wrong to fear for my safety. I can also assure you that you arecompletely mis­taken about the nature of our society. It is not ‘secret’ in theordinary signification of that term. Would you call the Royal Society ‘secret’?Yet a beggar who found his way into one of its meetings might believe they weretalking in some strange language to cloak their true purposes. I had discovered something that I had often daydreamed about in the past week orso: definite evidence of Esmond’s association with the Sect of the Phoenix.Trembling with excitement—and the damp cold of the attic—I made my way back tomy bedroom, clutching the tin box. I used the bedside phone—which our host hadthoughtfully installed—to ask the kitchen if I could have a light breakfast sentto my room. No one disturbed me, although I heard Alastair pass my door on hisway up to the attic. And during the next hour I learned more of Esmond Donellythan I had learned in all my weeks of research.I shall not quote these letters in full, for obvious reasons of space: theywould occupy some fifty pages. The story I pieced together from them was brieflythis. Esmond had learned of the existence of the Sect of the Phoenix from twosources: Rousseau, and Restif de la Bretonne. The latter was himself a member,as Esmond discovered later. Esmond had already evolved ideas that were close totheirs, as we have seen—and as these letters make very clear. He knew the Sectexisted, but he had no idea where to seek it. So he brought out the Observationsupon France and Switzerland, with the device of the phoenix on the cover, andthe brief account of their history attributed to a Lutheran pastor (who neverexisted). We know what happened then. He received the device of the phoenix inthe mail. And who was his first actual contact with the Sect? Absurdly andamusingly enough, it was the girl who first initiated him into the delights oflove: his sister’s maid Marie, or Minou. Minou had continued her career ofardent nymphomania in Paris, and had become the mistress of a member of theSect, who saw in her disinterested worship of the male genitals the true spiritof a devotee.Glenney and Esmond were close friends. But Glenney lacked the essential qualityof a member of the Sect: the disinterested pursuit of sex as a supra-personalexperience. Esmond suggested him as a member; and Glenney spent two days inParis with Esmond and Abdallah Mumin (who appears in Letters from a Mountain asAbdallah Saba—Glenney chooses as a surname that of the Grand Master of the Orderof Assassins). What happened is not clear, except that Glenney quarrelled withEsmond and left in a rage. Two months later, he and Esmond met again in London,and made up their quarrel—largely, apparently, at Glenney’s instigation. It wason this visit that they met Mary and Charlotte Ingestre, the daughters of theEarl of Flaxstead, who were staying with Esmond’s second cousin, ElizabethMontagu, and they made a joking compact to wed the two girls, and to share theirfavours between them. At some point, Glenney induced Esmond to tell himsomething about the Sect of the Phoenix. In London, they also met Restifagain—and the result was another quarrel, or rather, another outburst of furyfrom Horace Glenney. (All this confirmed my earlier guess that there was, onGlenney’s side, a strong homosexual element in the rela­tionship.) Glenney hireda Grub Street hack to do his research, and wrote the pamphlet ‘On the EvilSociety of the Phoenix’. Esmond got wind of this, and persuaded Glenney not topublish. Glenney agreed, and devoted the autumn of 1772 to the seduc­tion ofMary Ingestre, while Esmond laid successful siege to Charlotte. But in Novemberthere was a further quarrel; Glenney returned to Scotland, and wrote the Lettersfrom a Mountain between December and the following February. He wrote to Esmondto tell him that, while his promise bound him not to publish the pamphlet, hefelt that fiction was a different matter altogether. (And what was all this butan attempt to claim Esmond’s attention at any cost?) The result was the longletter from Esmond that I found in the back of the manuscript. For many years, you and I have been friends—nay, brothers. Many’s the bottle wehave emptied together, and many’s the wench whose virtue we have loosened by ajudicial mutuality of shakes and caresses. Why, then, do you choose this time todoubt me and accuse me of double dealing? What has happened to the brotherhoodwe swore in the inn at Heidelberg, when I had run a loutish fellow through thearm, and you had slashed t’other above the eyes and so blinded him? These reminders of past friendship, of meals eaten together and women seducedtogether, sound false coming from Esmond. Horace Glenney was of coarser stuff,and he knew it. What he was now doing was tantamount to blackmailing Esmond, andboth of them knew it. Their relation had been that of master and disciple. Theycame together when the brilliant Esmond had just discovered the delights of thefemale body, and he preached his gospel of seduction with the fervour of arevolutionary. We have seen how Glenney responded—in the episode of Fiona andMary. From the list of names Esmond mentions, we can infer that the two of themshared a great many mistresses at Göttingen. But Esmond was not fundamentallyinterested in sex as such. For him, sex was the key to a mystery, and it was themystery that interested him. Temperamentally, Horace Glenney bore manyresemblances to Casanova—whom he met once in Utrecht. He liked the good thingsof life, and he loved women. He could not understand why Esmond, his master inthe art of seduction, should not live in England’s capital and take up the HellFire Club where Sir Francis Dashwood had left off. For Glenney, this London—ofSheridan, Wilkes, Dashwood—was the most fascinat­ing place in the world:cockfights, horse racing, bare-fist boxing (a fairly new sport), nights at DruryLane, the company of beautiful women. What more did Esmond want? Why had hebecome such a spoilsport? Their joint seduction of the Ingestre sisters revealedthat their partnership was as irresistible as ever. And who was this formidableArab who spoke perfect French and who seemed inseparable from Esmond? WhenEsmond finally confessed that the man belonged to the Sect of the Phoenix,Glenney was appalled. Esmond had often spoken to him about this brotherhood; ithad fascinated him ever since Rousseau had mentioned it. Glenney had neverreally believed in its existence. And now Esmond was a member! That explainedeverything. Esmond was no longer a carefree seducer because he had fallen intothe hands of a secret society run by sinister foreigners, of whom this giant andscarred Arab was an example. Glenney’s reaction was a mixture of fear, anxiety,and jealousy—with the last predominating. He talked openly around London aboutthe Sect of the Phoenix—this must be where Johnson picked up the gossip aboutEsmond—and wrote his pamphlet. If Esmond had been less loyal, he would havereturned to Ireland and broken with Glenney. Instead, he tried to placate him.Or perhaps it would be truer to say that he tried to make Glenney understand thechanges that had taken place in him since their Göttingen days. I have always been of the opinion that this world is at bottom magical, and thatif we are not magicians, the fault lies in ourselves. Diderot makes d’Alembertsay: ‘Why am I what I am? Because it is inevitable that I should be.’ I havealways asked myself: ‘Why am I what I am? For it seems to me the most arbitrarything in the world.’ I might be anything or anywhere. My form is no more fixedthan is that of a wisp of smoke rising from a fire. On a still morn­ing, thesmoke may seem as stable as a column of marble; but we know that the slightestbreath of wind will change its form and disperse it into the atmosphere. I satone morn­ing on a bridge and watched the cataract that descends near Mont Blanc;and was struck suddenly by the reflection that men are surrounded by forces theyfail to understand, yet have the vanity to suppose themselves as enduring as therocks. In the days when men were hunters and fighters, they had no time tostagnate; they understood their own nature; they did not mistake smoke formarble. And in that respect, they understood the world better than M. Diderot orM. Voltaire understands it. Only a fool would wish to return to the state ofNumidian savages; and as to myself, I am neither a hunter nor a fighter. But Ihad long observed that when my battering ram sinks into its predestined home,whether it be between the thighs of a titled lady or a stable-maid, it becomesself-evident that this world is rich, warm and infinite. The blindness fallsfrom my eyes, the heaviness from my senses, and I see at once that man hasallowed him­self to be robbed of his birthright. But if this magic vision is mybirthright, why should I be content to accept it in disjoined fragments, as adog snaps up scraps of meat tossed upon the floor by its master? It is mine;shall I not seize it and hold it?This I have always believed. And I know enough of theology to know that thisbirthright is that which was lost to men through Adam’s sin. But how may we hopeto find that which was lost unless the search be systematic? I have alwaysbelieved there must be a way to recover this lost power. Now I have discoveredthat there are men who have devoted their lives to the search for this way, andcan teach me something of their methods. Can you truly believe that such men areevil, that their intention is to ensnare my immortal soul? And what would itsignify even if this were true? For neither you nor I believe that the soul canbe ensnared, except by dullness and too much concern with the unimportant.No, I am after more important quarry than the maiden­heads of infatuated girls. But what exactly did the Sect of the Phoenix do? Esmond expresses its basic aimin one sentence: ‘Our purpose is not to degrade and pollute religious feelingswith venery, but to raise venery to the level of a religious feeling.’ But howwas this to be done? Esmond is deliberately obscure; he had reason to dis­trustGlenney. But it is clear that when he came to Golspie—in April 1773—he toldGlenney a great deal more than he was willing to set down in writing; andGlenney, in turn, wrote down some of this material with the intention of usingit eventually in his book. I think it is impossible to doubt that Glenney alwaysintended to publish the book. I personally am reluctant to con­demn him. Thenovel is a remarkable achievement, in spite of its absurdities; one might almostsay that it constitutes Horace Glenney’s chief claim upon the interest ofposterity. Can a writer be blamed for deciding not to destroy his best work?From Glenney’s notes—which I shall summarise rather than quote at length—itseems clear that the Sect of the Phoenix had much in common with theRosicrucians or Freemasons. There was a Grand Master, who was a kind of pope,and who was elected by a committee known as ‘the dominoes’, presumably becausethey wore hoods with a short cloak, of the kind worn at masquerades. Eachcountry had only one domino—in France, it was the writer Choderlos de Laclos,author of Liaisons Dangereuses. Esmond later became the domino for Ireland.What is quite clear, both from Glenney’s notes and from Letters from a Mountain,is that there was always a certain basic difference of opinion within the Sectupon a fundamental point of doctrine. The Sect believed that man approaches thesense of the world as a ‘magical mystery’ more frequently through the sexual actthan through religion or art. (The important word here is frequently. No oneever denied that the ecstasies of mystics may reach greater intensity thananything to be achieved through sex. But they are rare. On the other hand, mancan approach the sexual mysteries every day.)All members of the Sect seemed to be agreed that mere uncontrolled promiscuityleads to boredom. But there was a con­siderable difference of opinion about theremedy. The tradition of the Sect—dating back four centuries—insisted that womenshould be treated as vessels of a religious mystery. The Hegumenos of SouthernRussia brought this idea to its fullest develop­ment in the late sixteenthcentury. On the other hand, the Huldeians, a nomadic German sect (whose namederives from the Teutonic goddess of marriage), were closer to those early‘monks’ who committed rape as often as possible. They believed that sex is mostintoxicating when it is violent and abrupt. In the eighteenth century, to be aHuldeian meant simply that one aimed at penetrating as many vaginas as possible,preferably virgins. It amounted basically to a cult of seduction. Horace Glenneywas a Huldeian without knowing it, and so was Esmond in his early days. Lacloswas a Huldeian; so were the Grand Master, Abdallah Yahya, and his successorHendrik van Griss. The man who was responsible for Esmond’s initiation, AbdallahMumin, belonged to the tradition of the Hegumenos. The original Hegumenos (namedafter their first leader, the renegade ‘hegumenos’ or abbot of an order ofBasilian monks) chose a beautiful young girl as a kind of pythoness, and anotherdozen girls as her handmaidens; these latter were also priestesses. The womenwere worshipped as divinities; but the males of the sect were allowed a certainamount of contact with the divinities, which could even culminate in sexualintercourse. In order to qualify for this, the male had to fast for three daysout of every week for many months beforehand, and go through a number ofwell-defined stages of approach to the mystery. If he could lie on the steps ofthe ‘temple’ naked on a winter night—from dusk until dawn—he was allowed to actas a servant to three of the priestesses for an hour every day, bringing theirfood and clean­ing their rooms. He was allowed to eat the left-over scraps offood. After more tests, involving sticking slivers of wood under his nails andburning himself on the tender part of his forearm, he was allowed to become a‘body servant’ to another three, laundering and sewing their clothes and washingtheir hair. Their physical waste products were regarded as sacred, and it washis job to take them into the depth of the forest and bury them in a place whereno other males of the tribe could find them. He was allowed to smear himselfwith excrement and wash it off with their urine—a privilege envied by all theother males of the tribe. The mingling of the worshipper’s semen with the wasteproducts of the ‘holy ones’ was regarded as the first degree of union with thedivinity. If he could pass increasingly difficult and painful tasks, he wasallowed an increasing number of privi­leges, until he might be one of the eightmen who were the body servants of the Holy One herself. In that case, he mightbe the one who was chosen by lot to participate with her in the cere­monies thattook place on the night of the full moon following the harvest, and to haveintercourse with her, dressed in the robe of a bull. The loins of the priestess,and the phallus of her worshipper, were carefully dried on a sacred napkin afterthis ceremony, and the napkin was divided into eight parts and given to theeight servants, who then wore it attached to the head of the penis for theremainder of their term of office.It can be seen, I think, that the basic idea of the Hegumenos was to try tobuild up a state of sexual frenzy combined with religious adoration, and thateach painful and difficult stage was designed to prevent the aspirant frombecoming in any way relaxed or casual about his task. If he lost his erection atany time in the presence of the priestesses, he would be flogged and sent backto the tribe in disgrace. This meant that he came to rely a great deal upon hisimagination. It will also be noted that his position was really that of amaidservant; he was treated as a woman, so that he would feel humiliated, andhis sexuality would become furtive. The whole idea was that sex should never betreated as something ‘above board’, normal, to be taken for granted. Everyobject associated with the ceremonies became sacred and fearful—and alsosexually exciting. The vagina of the priestess became an ultimate sacred goal,and the eight servants were envied by all the males for their possession of thefragment of napkin stained with her moisture.Esmond preferred the Hegumenos doctrine to that of the Huldeians. And much ofthe long letter to Glenney is taken up with argument against the kind ofseduction that Esmond had once advocated. He keeps repeating that it has nolasting effect; it leads to satiety.The next episode is one of the most interesting—and worst documented—in theEsmond-Glenney relationship. It can be pieced together from several sources,including letters from Esmond—those we found in the trunk in the attic—lettersand diaries belonging to Horace Glenney, and letters written by Mary and MaureenIngestre. These will all be quoted at length in the forthcoming volume. Thestory that emerges is as follows:When Esmond and Horace Glenney had their reconciliation in London in October1772, Esmond was staying at the house of his cousin Sophia, in St James’s. Shewas now Sophie Blackwood, having married Sir Edmund Blackwood, a wealthy brewer,whose father had been one of Handel’s backers. Lady Mary and Char­lotte Ingestrewere staying with Elizabeth Montagu, the blue­stocking, who was instructing themin astronomy. Esmond was fascinated by the delicious and innocent Charlotte,then 19½. Glenney was impressed by Lady Mary, brilliant, beautiful and moreself-possessed than her sister, although she was a year her junior. (This istypical of the different characters of the two men; Esmond, clever and dominant,preferred innocence and sweet­ness; Glenney, not entirely sure of himself, wasdazzled by the more intellectual of the two.)It seems likely that Glenney would never have aimed so high without Esmond’sencouragement; he felt more comfortable seducing his social inferiors. Whatimpressed Esmond was that most eligible men were shy of the Ingestre girlsbecause of their reputation for brilliance and wealth. The sporting set madecrude jests about them, and were secretly overawed by them, and the respectableyoung men—who probably sounded and behaved rather like Jane Austen’s Darcy or MrBingley—paid them grave compliments and tried to start intellectualconver­sations. Esmond’s response was simpler. He thought them both delicious,and remarked to Glenney that a man could spend an exquisite night between thetwo of them.Glenney knew that when Esmond said a thing like this, it was not mere wishfulthinking. If there was any man in London who could seduce the Ingestre sisters,it was Esmond. He had the ideal qualification for seducing intellectual girls—agood mind. He and Lichtenberg had been the two best mathematicians of theirgeneration at Göttingen. The Ingestre sisters actually knew Lichtenberg—they hadbeen introduced to him by no less a person than the King, at Hampton Court, andhad examined the King’s great telescope under Lichtenberg’s supervision.Obvi­ously, Esmond would have no trouble seeing a great deal of the Ingestresisters, since they were staying with Sophia’s cousin Elizabeth. Esmond’s owntelescope—made by Schwarmz of Ley­den—was an exceptionally powerful one. He setit up in an attic room in Sophia Blackwood’s house, pinned his diagrams on thewalls, and invited Elizabeth Montagu and her two charming guests to come andstudy the stars with himself and Lichtenberg. Elizabeth Montagu had not metLichtenberg; she was anxious to do so. Esmond had the foresight to have a smallmeal prepared in his ‘observatory’—pheasant, woodcock, capon, an Irish ham, andvarious other delicacies. The ladies asked many questions, and peered throughthe telescope for over an hour. Then the conversation shifted to philosophy, andEsmond and Lichtenberg discussed Leibniz, Voltaire, Hume and the inauguraldissertation of the brilliant German, Immanuel Kant, in which he argued thatreality is unknowable, and that the senses dictate the form of all our knowledgeof phenomena. (The Critique, which devel­oped these doctrines, would not bepublished for another nine years.) Elizabeth Montagu was deeply impressed; shesaid she had never heard such profound and disturbing discourse—no, not evenfrom Burke, Garrick or Dr Johnson himself. It was heady stuff, this Germancritical philosophy. The effect was achieved. Elizabeth Montagu later remarkedthat Esmond was one of the most eligible bachelors in London. And Esmond wasalready convinced that he had made a favourable impression on Char­lotte. Hetook her hand for a moment on the pretext of helping her on a dark corner of thestairway, and she allowed him to retain it several seconds longer thannecessary.Horace Glenney was not present on this occasion. We know exactly why, for Esmondexplains in one of the letters included in the manuscript of Letters from aMountain. Esmond knew that Glenney would not make an immediate impact on theladies, being rather shy. (What Esmond obviously means is that Glenney wouldhardly be noticed in company that included Lichtenberg, Elizabeth Montagu andhimself.) His entrance had to be pre­pared. Esmond found out what Mary Ingestrehad been reading, and Glenney spent twenty-four hours skipping through it andpreparing brilliant remarks. Esmond rode in the park with the sisters two daysafter their evening with the telescope, and told them about the delicate, shy,noble character of his friend Glenney. He told Mary that Glenney had beenbrought up in a strictly religious manner, and that his acquaintance with Germanphilosophy was undermining his faith; he invented a par­ticularly movinganecdote about Glenney in Chartres cathedral, asking with tears in his eyes: ‘Isall this beauty a monument to man’s ability to deceive himself?’ So when he tookGlenney to call on Elizabeth Montagu a few days later, there was no need toencourage Mary to take an interest in him. She took the first opportunity to gethim into a quiet corner, where she could question him earnestly about hisdoubts. The meeting was more successful than either of them could have hoped;she agreed to ride in the park with Glenney the next day, and spent the nightstoring up arguments from Butler and Tillotson on the evidence for divineworkmanship in Nature. Glenney, in turn, did a certain amount of spadework forEsmond, hinting at secret sorrows and lost love. There can be no doubt that theymade an impressive team.Esmond was ideally placed for spending a great deal of time with Charlotte.Elizabeth Montagu was his second cousin, and the girls had become friendly withSophia Blackwood. No one thought it unusual if Charlotte walked from Mayfair toSt James’s to call on Sophia and discuss what they should wear at LadySandwich’s autumn ball. And if Sophia was not at home, why should she not spendan hour discussing astronomy and meta­physics with Sophia’s cousin?By mid-October, Charlotte was admitting to Mary that she would be inclined toaccept if Esmond proposed to her. Mary passed this on to Glenney, who toldEsmond. He was surprised when Esmond did not seem particularly pleased at thenews. But Esmond was clear-sighted enough to see that the situation wasdeveloping too fast, and was beginning to look dangerous. If Sophia andElizabeth and Mary had all set their minds on match­making, he would probablyfind himself engaged before the end of the season. It was time for a temporaryretreat.It was at this point that Horace Glenney decided to elaborate his story of the‘lost love’. He confided to Mary that Esmond had been engaged to the daughter ofa Swiss pastor. Esmond’s father had objected to the idea of an alliance with thedaughter of a Calvinist parson and threatened to disinherit him. Like Gibbon,Esmond ‘sighed as a lover, but obeyed as a son’. They had been separated now forover a year, and she had written to tell Esmond that she was engaged to a winemerchant of Geneva. But Esmond had recently heard that this was untrue. She wasstill unmarried and unbetrothed, perhaps waiting for Esmond. . . .Esmond was furious when Glenney told him what he’d done. He had no wish to makeCharlotte miserable and jealous; he only wanted to disappear for long enough todiscourage the match­makers. Now they all believed he meant to return toSwitzerland to take another look at his lost love. It was no good denying sheexisted; no one would believe him.Riding with him in Marylebone Fields, Charlotte asked him to stay long enough topartner her at Lady Sandwich’s ball. Esmond knew this would be fatal; heexplained that this would be impossible. Charlotte returned home in tears. Thenext day, Mary Ingestre called on Sophia, and the two of them asked him to stay;Sophia said it was absurd to leave London at the height of the season, and thathis business in Ireland could wait. Esmond tried to put them off by saying thathe would return to London as soon as his business was completed, but it was nogood. Char­lotte was convinced that if he left London now he would never comeback to her.She called the following afternoon—when Sophia was out—and tried coaxing him.Esmond explained apologetically that he had to leave on boring family business,connected with the estate. She asked him point blank what the business was, andwhy it could not wait. Then she tried tears, and Esmond found himself pettingher and comforting her. He was twenty-four and very susceptible; she was verybeautiful. Some years later, in a letter to Laclos, he wrote: I have always been of the opinion that the most innocent and virtuous girls arethose whom Nature has schooled best in the art of seduction; and if they are inlove, they are almost irresistible. The only time I was ever seduced was by sucha virgin, a foolish friend had made her believe I intended to rush to marryanother woman to whom I had given proofs of my esteem. She came to persuade meone day when I was alone in the house. Until this time I had not so much askissed her. First I tried honesty; I told her that my friend was a fool and thatI had no intention of going to Switzerland. She asked why, in that case, I couldnot stay a few weeks longer. Then she cried, and I took her in my arms. When Ikissed her, she stopped crying; then began to kiss me with such passion that Ibegan to wonder if she was as virtuous as I had supposed. My common sense toldme it was time to stop, but when I tried to calm her, she stopped my mouth withkisses and clung the harder. Then she said she felt she was going to faint, andsat down on a sofa; I said I would go to fetch water, but she begged me to stayand sit by her. Now would you not consider it reasonable, under thesecircumstances, to make the assump­tion that she was innocent of the effect shewas having upon the organ of my adoration? My logic told me that if I pressedthe discovery upon her, she might be shocked into modesty and prudence.Therefore, as I knelt with my head upon her breast, I slipped my hand into theopen bosom of her dress and loosened one of her breasts from its corsage. Whenshe made no protest, I understood that she permitted it because she felt she waswinning me from the maid in Geneva. I became curious to see how far thisreasoning would carry her. I transferred my lips to her feet; she was wearing nostockings and her legs were smooth and soft. When my head reached her knees, shetwined her fingers in my hair, and I thought this was to prevent furtheradvances, so I moved on with determination. But she made no attempt to hinderme, even when I pushed up her skirts to her waist and un­covered a downy mountand lips that were still undeveloped. I pressed my lips to this nether mouth,although she wriggled, and kept them there until I had moistened it with myspittle. Then I moved up, upon her, and began to loosen my trousers. She nowsaid ‘No, no’ and moved her hips sideways, but otherwise made no determinedattempt to hinder me. I unsheathed my weapon, pressed its head against the lipsI had prepared for it, and began to move it up and down. When I felt the narroworifice below me, I thrust gently, felt the mouth open slightly, and then feltmyself tightly gripped by her. At this point, it was impossible to go further,and she lay there and gasped whenever I moved. I felt my climax come upon me,and withdrew in time to shed my dew upon the soft down at the base of her belly.Now she lay there, holding me tight, knowing now that she need fear nodesertion, and might reasonably expect a proposal. I felt her victory had beengained too easily; therefore after I had recovered my vital powers, I went tothe door and locked it, threw more logs on the fire; then went back to her—shewas standing looking at a telescope that stood on a tripod—and began undoing thestrings of her dress. She protested, but I ignored her, for I felt that if sheintended to become my wife, she should begin upon her duties imme­diately. Theprotests were not seriously meant, for she allowed me to remove every article ofclothing. I then made her lie in front of the fire, and went to work upon herbreasts with a will. When I tried to introduce my tongue into the temple oflove, she seemed shocked by such strange atten­tions; but soon grew accustomedto them. Thereupon, I tried again, and again had no more success than a childtrying to push down a wall. After spending again, this time inside the crampedchamber, I allowed her to dress. We went downstairs and rang for tea, and spenthalf an hour talking of marriage. After this, since we were still left alone, Itold her to come back to my room for one more try. She came unwillingly, beingsore. This time I laid her down with her skirts above her waist, anointed thegates of the temple with a little butter that I had brought up with me, andpressed in upon her. She made it more difficult by wincing from me whenever Ithrust, so half the force was lost. Then I whispered to her to open her kneeswide and press them against my hips. And as I drove forward, so also did she,throwing herself upon me like a warrior falling on his sword. Then I felt myselftightly gripped, so I almost wondered if I should ever withdraw; she cried out,and two more hard thrusts had me buried deep in her, my whole member grippedtight from the head to the root. And so we know how the apparently impossible came about, and Lady CharlotteIngestre yielded her maidenhood to a man who was determined to reject it.Esmond’s letters to Laclos seldom enter into so much physical detail; both menwere more interested in discussing the psychological peculiarities of women. Attwenty-four, Esmond was not experienced enough to divine that there was adistinctly masochistic element about Charlotte Ingestre; she wanted to bemastered and taken by a man who ordered her to lie down and open her legs. Shebecame Esmond’s mistress, and followed him around in much the same manner thatLady Caroline Lamb later followed Lord Byron. It is equally indicative of heryielding temperament that, having become his mistress, she ceased to talk aboutmarriage; again, her masochism revelled in her anomalous position.What happened next must be summarised briefly. Gossip about Esmond and hisdaughter may have reached the ears of the Earl of Flaxstead; he told her one daythat he had selected a husband for her—a respectable Scottish baronet who spenthis days hunting on his moors. She said she wanted to marry Esmond; her fathertold her to forget any such ambition; Esmond was a nobody, the son of an Irishlandowner without enough money to maintain a London house. There were scenes andhysteria; she was taken back to the family home at Weston upon Trent, where shefell ill for a few weeks. Mary Ingestre wrote to Sophia, asking her to adviseEsmond to return to Ireland, because while he was in London, her father wasdetermined to keep Charlotte away from it. Esmond went. Oddly enough, Marybecame hostile to her sister after this crisis; perhaps she resented the easewith which this gentle, sweet-tempered girl had captured Esmond, who would havebeen altogether better suited by Lady Mary.And what was the scandal about Lady Mary that the Misses Donelly had mentionedto me? It was that Mary preferred Esmond to Horace Glenney, whom she married inAugust 1773. This was largely Glenney’s own fault. Having installed his wife inthe west wing of Golspie House, and invited Charlotte to come and stay, he lostno time in asking Esmond. Esmond accepted promptly, and his relations withCharlotte resumed immediately; she spent every night in his room, returning toher own at dawn.The sequel is also described in a letter to Laclos, in which Esmond criticisesan episode from Prévost’s Memoirs and Adven­tures of a Man of Quality describinghow a virtuous lady got her maid to sleep with her lover, so she could preserveher chastity. Esmond says this is absurd, unless the lover was drunk. Some years ago, a friend and I were drinking port in front of the fire, longafter his wife and her sister had retired for the night. We fell to discussingthe different temperaments of the two women, and he remarked that he believed hewould have been happier if he had married the sister. We discussed the way inwhich their temperaments were reflected in their lovemaking, and soon discoveredthat the sisters had one thing in common: if asleep, they would allow themselvesto be made love to without fully awaking. This suggested to us the idea that wemight try what would happen if I were to get into bed with his wife, and he withher sister, my mistress. The idea seemed to us amusing, and we tried it. I wentalong to his room, which was in darkness, and very cold; I undressed and slippedinto bed. He had told me that if he desired to take her, he gently pulled her onto her back by her shoulder, pulled open her thighs by laying his hand upon herknee, and then mounted her with­out further caresses. This I did. Her back wasturned to me; when I was warm, I took hold of her shoulder and turned her over.She gave a low moan of protest, but lay still. I raised her night gown, whichwas of silk, caressed between her thighs for a moment, then moved on to her. Shewas soft and warm, and I scarcely moved, afraid to wake her, enjoying thecontrast of her with her sister. Then she moved her buttocks slightly and raisedher belly; this undid me, and I gushed inside her. When I withdrew, she turnedover again, and seemed to sleep peacefully. Half an hour later, I did the sameagain, but this time determined to get the most of the pleasure, and so moved upand down on her. This time she responded, moving with me, until we achieved ourecstasy together. We said nothing, and she slept again. An hour later I woke andfelt her hand on me, caressing my priapus with skilful fingered delicacy; wecame together quickly, and went at it for a long time. When it was over, shewhispered: ‘I wonder if Charlotte is enjoying her change as much as I am?’ Theywere the first words either had spoken. Before dawn, I went back to my own bed,and the next day learned that Charlotte had also detected my friend after theirfirst coming-together, although she had been asleep while he possessed her. What Esmond does not mention in this letter is that as a result of their nighttogether, Mary began to treat Esmond openly as a second husband—to Charlotte’sindignation. Now they had spent a night together, Mary no longer felt the needto hide her feelings for Esmond. She had always been fascinated by him—eversince that first meeting when Esmond and Lichtenberg had explained Kant’scritical philosophy. Her relation with her hus­band was entirely different; shewas fond of him but could not admire him. And she was aware that his mind—suchas it was—had been almost entirely formed by Esmond and, to a lesser extent, byLichtenberg. When Esmond returned to London—he had by this time bought the tall,narrow house in Fleet Street, close to Dr Johnson’s—Mary followed him, stayingwith Sophia Blackwood; and soon it was common gossip that Esmond slept withCharlotte and Mary in the same bed. There is no evidence for this, although itis likely that Esmond continued to be the lover of both women. We know that onNovember 23, 1773, Esmond wrote to the Earl of Flaxstead, making a formalpro­posal for the hand of his daughter, and that on the 28th he received a coldand brief note declaring that Charlotte was already betrothed to ‘a gentleman ofKent’. It is not known what pressure the Earl brought to bear on hisdaughter—who was still under age; Charlotte later told Mary that he hadthreatened to have her head shaved and send her to a Belgian convent. Two daysafter Christmas, Charlotte was quietly married to Sir Russell Frazer, ofSevenoaks, a gentleman whom Walpole refers to as ‘imbecilic’. The Earl is saidto have remarked to the father of Thomas Creevey, the diarist: ‘Now she is offmy hands, I don’t care how she compromises herself.’ Creevey’s story of a duelbetween Esmond and Charlotte’s father seems to be one of those inventions whosesource cannot be traced. If the ‘imbecilic’ Frazer knew the story of his wife’sinfatuation for Esmond, he had the sense not to be jealous; for Esmond andGlenney were frequent guests at Blades House, Sevenoaks, during the 1780s.Charlotte came to him with a handsome dowry, and it was said that Frazer kept aFrench mistress in Dover; so it may have been one of those typically civilisedarrangements of the eighteenth century. Sophia Blackwood described Charlotte ayear after her marriage as ‘blooming and very happy’. The story of Maureen Ingestre, the youngest of the sisters, is probably the mostinteresting of the three, and is unfortunately the worst documented. Boswellquotes Horace Walpole as saying that it must be a delightful experience to havehad the love of three such beautiful sisters, and that it is an experience thatevery man should have once in a lifetime. When Mary married Horace Glenney,Maureen was only thirteen, and her father refused to allow her to go to Londonto stay with Elizabeth Montagu, no doubt having heard what had happened to hisother daughters there. But once Mary was married, it was impossible to forbidMaureen to stay at Golspie. Besides, oddly enough, the Earl held Horace Glenneyin high esteem, and in 1781, when Glenney succeeded to the title, described himas ‘the kindest and most delightful man in England’. This is an aspect ofGlenney that should be borne in mind. As Esmond’s Leporello, he appears in anunfortunate light; but when not wracked by jealousy, or trying to emulateEsmond, he seems to have been a charming and kindly man, who became increasinglya typical member of the sporting aristocracy. (Another side of his nature is hisinterest in Scottish folk-tales. His conviction that Ossian was a forgery ledhim to seek out the genuine folk-tales of the highlands, which he combinedtogether, rather in the manner of Lönnrot’s Kalevala collection, into anarrative called Reliques of the North [1793].)In the letters at the back of Glenney’s manuscript, there is only one hint ofwhat took place between Esmond and Maureen Ingestre. In the second letter,Esmond writes: ‘A German tribe of the Upper Danube holds that certain virginsare sacred, and should be regarded as the holy receptacle of the mysteries ofcreation. . . . Such women may be known by a certain dreaminess in the eyes, asoftness of expression combined with the natural grace of a goddess. When menencounter such women, they have only one duty: to worship; and in worshipping,to confirm the goddess in her divinity.’ And by this, in the margin, there is ascrawl in Glenney’s hand: ‘He cd have [illegible] Maureen Ing.’And this, for the moment, was the sum of my knowledge of Maureen Ingestre. Laterthat day, Alastair, Angela and myself went through every item in the chest fromthe attic; but we found nothing more to our purpose. I shall write elsewhere ofthe manuscript of Esmond’s early novel Allardyce and Leontia, written when hewas nineteen, at Göttingen, and the long poem In Memory of Charles Churchill,written at about the same time. Both these were found in the library at GolspieHouse, and they were no doubt passed on to Horace Glenney junior in accordancewith Esmond’s will. The latter is by no means without merit. Charles Churchillwas one of the best-known poets of his period; a clergyman, satirist, bruiser(he had a tremendous physique), member of the Hell Fire Club, he died at the ageof thirty-three of a fever contracted when visiting Wilkes in France. Esmond methim, and apparently admired him, and in the manuscript of Letters from aMountain, ‘Churchell’ [sic] is mentioned as ‘one of the most notorious of theSociety of the Phoenix’. If this is true—and from all accounts of Churchill, itis very likely—then it raises the interesting possibility that Churchill was thefirst person to tell Esmond of the Sect.I was so excited by the discovery of these further materials that I wrote a longletter to Fleisher from Golspie House, out­lining my discoveries sofar—including the information about the Sect of the Phoenix—and suggesting thatI might write this present book as an introductory volume to Esmond’s Memoirs.There were still many unanswered questions: how had Horace Glenney died? whatbecame of Maureen Ingestre? above all, what happened to Esmond in his lateryears? But these could be left for later researchers.Before I left Golspie House, two days later, I had discovered partial answers totwo of these questions. We decided to leave at about ten o’clock in the morning,to try to get to Edinburgh late at night. We had breakfast early; and then,while Angela did some last-minute packing, I looked around the library. Many ofthe books had been spoiled by damp at some time, and someone had made a pile ofthese in one corner of the room, perhaps with the intention of having themre-bound. I was aware that this room must have looked much the same when Esmondand Horace Glenney did their late-night drinking here—and decided to exchangebeds. I tried several times to place my mind in a passive state, to try to‘receive’ Esmond, but the house was too busy and I could not concentrate. Then,very suddenly, it came; the library became familiar in an unfamiliar manner—thisis the only way I can describe it. Our feeling for places is made up mostly ofmemories and associations. Esmond’s memories of this library were very differentfrom mine. So, in a sense, it became a different place. And I found myselflooking at a high shelf in the corner, close to the window. I went across tothis. Already, ‘Esmond’ had faded. The shelf was empty, and the woodwork behindit was warped and stained with damp. It struck me that if there had been bookson this shelf, they might now be among the piles in the corner of the room. Iwent over to them and arranged them in a row on the floor, with the spinesturned upwards. None of the titles seemed at all interesting: sermons, a fewtravel books, Cowper’s poems, some Scott; even a Tauchnitz edition of HenryJames. I began opening them at random, glancing at title pages. I picked up AnAccount of the Sandwich Islands that was badly mildewed, the pages corrugatedwith damp. And as I looked at the title page, I knew I had found what I waslooking for. It was by Maureen Ingestre. It was printed by Murray, Byron’spublisher, in London in 1812, by which time Maureen would have been fifty-two.The book was dedicated ‘To the memory of Horace, Lord Glenney’. Under­neaththis, someone had written: ‘was stabbed in the right eye by unknown assassin,July 28, 1796’. The words, badly stained, were hardly legible.So when we left Golspie House that morning, I knew two more things about theGlenney family: that Horace had been stabbed, and not shot; and that MaureenIngestre travelled in the East in her later years, visiting Japan, Australia andthe Sandwich Islands. I later ascertained that the words written under thededication were in the handwriting of Glenney’s son.I was well pleased with myself; the visit had not yielded as much as I mighthave hoped; but everything it had yielded was valuable. Alastair and Angela werealso happy. They had not found the rest of the Donelly journals; but they hadfound a Bible worth twenty thousand pounds.The knowledge that Glenney had been stabbed provided material for speculation,particularly in view of the postscript to Esmond’s first letter: ‘I beg you todestroy, or at least suppress this work, not only in the name of our oldfriendship, but of your safety, and mine.’ Could Esmond have been in any dangerfrom the Sect? Could it be that Glenney’s death was the result of his decisionto ignore Esmond’s warning? There was at least one odd feature of the murder:that it took place in a small room on the second floor. If Glenney was killed inbed, why was he not in one of the large bedrooms overlooking the loch? I foundmyself wishing that I could contact Esmond and ask him; but no amount ofconcentration gave me the clue I needed.We arrived back at Alastair’s London flat at two o’clock on a Friday afternoon.It was a superb day; in fact, slightly too warm for comfort; I found myselfwishing I’d brought summer clothes. I was thinking of Esmond—whose body had beenmouldering in the family vault for more than a hundred years—and wishing I couldsomehow share the day with him.Alastair had business in the City; Angela and I ate a late lunch together. It isimpossible for two people to become sud­denly and violently intimate, and notcontinue to think of one another, in some sense, as lovers; and the kind ofwarmth that had grown up between us was not unlike that of husband and wife. Ifound myself telling her about these odd experiences of ‘being’ Esmond, and howthe last one had led me to the finding of the book by Maureen Ingestre. Iexpected her to find it inter­esting, perhaps amusing, but not really credible;after all, I had been soaking myself rather intensely in Esmond, so it wasnatural that I should feel like him sometimes. Her reaction surprised me; shewas perplexed and worried. I said:‘It’s nothing to get excited about. I find it rather interesting.’I found myself arguing the rationalist point of view I had expected her to take.She said that Alastair had talked about ‘feeling strange’ at Golspie, andwondered if his bedroom was haunted.Half an hour after lunch, when I was examining the manu­script of Glenney’snovel, she said:‘Do you think he’s trying to tell you something?’‘Who?’‘Esmond.’I tried to explain that I didn’t have a feeling of Esmond’s presence; I simplysaw things through his eyes, as if I were Esmond. You don’t try to tell yourselfsomething.She said: ‘I think we ought to ring that Dr Körner.’I had intended to, but I meant to leave it another twenty-four hours. I wantedto spend a quiet evening going through the various papers we had brought withus. Angela said:‘Let me ring him.’‘All right. If you want to.’Ten minutes later, she said:‘I’ve invited him over for a drink at six o’clock.’At about half past five, the phone rang; Angela took the call. She put her handover the receiver and said:‘It’s Anna Dunkelman . . .’I shook my head heavily, to indicate that I didn’t want to speak to her. Angelatold her I was out and wouldn’t be back until late. I went out to the bathroomwhile they talked, and had a shower. When I came back in, ten minutes later, shewas still talking. She hung up while I was changing in the bedroom.‘That woman’s quite dreadful. I wish I hadn’t given her this number.’‘What did she want?’‘She must have second sight. She said she’d just heard that Körner was inLondon, and wanted to advise you not to see him. Then she went on with long,rambling stories about how wicked he is.’‘What did she say he’d done?’‘Oh . . . quarrels about what Reich meant, and so on. But she said he’d beenspreading false rumours about them, and that she intended to sue him forslander. What it all amounts to is that she wants you to avoid Körner, and ifyou happen to meet him, don’t believe a single word he says.’I was sitting on the bed, tying my tie; Angela came over, and placed her hand onmy damp hair. I was mildly surprised, but assumed she was a little shaken andwanted comforting. I put my arm round her waist and gave her a squeeze. She tookmy hand in both her hands and pressed it against her breasts. I stood up, bentmy head to give her a reassuring kiss, and found myself holding her veryclosely, her body pressed tightly to mine. After we had kissed for a moment, shesaid in a strained voice:‘It’s dreadful, but I want you to make love to me.’‘There’s hardly time.’But she could feel me hardening against her. She slipped her hand into the topof my trousers, which were still unbelted, and gripped my erect member. I slidmy hand up her mini-skirt, and inside the crotch of her panties; she was morethan ready to be made love to. Then suddenly, she twisted away from me. I said:‘What is it?’ She burst into tears and said: ‘I hate myself.’‘Why?’‘It’s that foul woman. I think she uses hypnotism. As she talked to me . . .’She couldn’t go on. I held her close again, but this time without desire. Ipointed out that it was hardly shameful to be susceptible to suggestion. Alittle more questioning revealed that Frau Dunkelman had talked about sexualceremonies. Angela said:‘I know, but it felt so awful. I wanted to rape you.’‘Don’t let me dissuade you.’But we both knew the fever had passed. To prove it, I pressed her on to the bed,and kissed her gently, then stroked her breasts and thighs with my hand. Sherelaxed like a child. We could have made love then, but it would have been thegentle love-making of a married couple, an extension of our kisses, not anerotic frenzy. Ten minutes later, when there was a ring at the doorbell, I washaving a badly needed martini, and Angela was in the shower. Körner was a strange-looking man; tall, with stooped shoulders, and an almostcompletely bald head; he reminded me imme­diately of the conductor Fürtwangler.The chin seemed weak, and the face somehow indeterminate; yet the overall effectwas of a strange, introverted intelligence. His voice was rather high-pitched,but gentle, and almost hypnotic after he had been speaking for a few minutes.The German accent was strong. His grey suit looked expensive, but well worn andslightly baggy.He refused a drink—‘I take only a little fruit juice’—and then sat on the edgeof a deep armchair with his bony hands loosely between his knees, managing tolook at the same time uncomfortable and relaxed. When Angela came in, he leaptto his feet, and bowed over her hand with a natural courtliness and grace thatseemed an expression of his inner character. Angela suggested he sit on thesettee; this time, he flung himself back into a corner with exaggeratedcasualness and crossed his legs, revealing silk socks with a bright checkpattern. Then he began:‘Well, my dear Mr Sorme, this is really a great honour for me. I know your bookswell, of course. [This later turned out to be true; in his pedantic Germanmanner, he quoted from them extensively.] And let me say at once that I hope youwill find a few of my ideas as interesting as I find yours . . .’I could see that Angela was dying to ask him about the Dunkelmans, but it wasdifficult to interrupt the flow of conver­sation about ideas; besides, one gotthe feeling that he would find it trivial in comparison to discussing Hölderlinand Jaspers.I shall not try to report his conversation fully. It went on, fairly steadily,until he left at midnight. It ranged from German romanticism and metaphysics tothe ideas of Reich and his own development of them. I can only try to offer asketch of his central ideas.The Dunkelmans had outlined the position of Wilhelm Reich. Körner described itmuch more fully: the three periods, begin­ning with his work as a Freudian, thenhis breakaway from Freud into ‘character analysis’—which most psychologistswould consider his major contribution—and finally, his ‘crank’ period as a‘physicist’, when he believed he had discovered a mysterious energy called‘orgone’ that could be concentrated in various strange ways. What surprised mewas that Körner approved of Reich’s more or less materialistic theories aboutneurosis (Reich was a member of the Communist party until he was expelled forhis heterodox views on the causes of fascism).I began to understand Körner better when he talked about Reich’s concept of‘character armour’: how people develop various rigidities of character to coverup their inadequacies and insecurities, and how these rigidities may eventuallybecome a suit of armour that suffocates the person inside. Körner had obviouslytaken this to heart. It seemed to be his aim to have absolutely no characterarmour; he seemed utterly fluid and unprotected. He told us frankly how Reichhad cured him of a muscular stiffness that had caused him agonies of cramp. Thisstiffness was basically due to the embarrassment of an over­sensitive man—aswhen a schoolboy’s writing hand begins to feel stiff when the teacher looks overhis shoulder.After all this, it was difficult to understand how Körner made his transition tohis theory of the subconscious—although he himself professed to see noinconsistency. His notion, basically, is that civilisation and reason haveforced man into an artificial mould. He saw man’s ability to think logically asa fall from grace, a form of original sin. He called consciousness ‘artificialdaylight’, and compared it to electric lighting that has enabled man to see inthe dark, but which has the effect of sharply cutting him off from the nightoutside his windows. Animals, he said, are somehow identified with Nature; manis trapped inside his electric-lighted room of consciousness.This shows particularly in the sexual sphere, for sex belongs essentially tothat ‘night’ outside the windows. Animals slide into sex like a crocodilesliding off a sandbank into the water (Körner’s image); man has to dive in froma high bank. He gets there all right; but unless he is a good diver, the impactmay destroy him. It is true, he said, that sex depends upon the separateness ofmale and female, as a dynamo depends upon the polarity of magnets. But we haveexaggerated this separate­ness until it has become another lock on the prisondoor. Frustra­tions built up; we become alienated from society and from oneanother, as well as from Nature. The sickness shows in the increase in crime,and in the sickeningly barbarous nature of certain crimes—he cited a number ofexamples mentioned in my own books.The answer, according to Körner, is beautifully simple. Sex must be‘disinfected’, until the sexual relation between human beings is as natural asbetween animals. If the great sexual barrier can be removed from between people,the old link between the conscious and the subconscious will be re-established;man will have the advantage of his civilisation—which will cease to be aFrankenstein’s monster—and the simplicity of a healthy animal. The Book ofGenesis is right in declaring that ‘sin’ came with man’s consciousness of sexualshame. All shame must vanish.Alastair returned home while Körner was expounding Reich; he was so fascinatedthat he forgot to pour himself a drink. An hour later, I suggested that we allgo out for supper, and continue the ‘discussion’ (which was really almost alecture, although delivered with the most charming informality). We had Chabliswith the meal, and Körner drank two glasses, with water in. Then we walkedaround the block for a while—Körner said he needed constant physical exercise ifhis mind was working well—and then went back to the flat. I had certainreservations about Körner’s ideas, but I could see that the other two found themrevelatory. Without prompting, Angela described the sexual repressions of herchildhood, and Alastair told us how he had never lost the feeling of shame atbeing discovered masturbating in the lavatory of his public school by someonewho looked over the partition. I saw Angela looked startled at this; I supposeit had never struck her that boys are that highly sexed. And then, to myamazement, Angela proceeded to describe what had hap­pened to us last time wehad been to the Dunkelmans. I thought at first that she only meant to tell himhow Anna Dunkelman insisted on exposing herself; but after blushing, andglancing at me, she plunged on to talk about what had happened in the taxi. Itwas Alastair’s turn to look startled, if not shocked. She ended: ‘How would youexplain that?’Körner looked interested and concerned; he kept nodding his head slowly.‘They are cunning, very cunning. I had to expel them from our group because whatthey really wanted was to organise a society for sexual orgies. [When Angelasaid: ‘That’s what they said about you’, he nodded even more gravely.] You see,they are not truly civilised human beings. They belong to a more primitive stageof society—the stage of taboo and human sacri­fice. I will tell you what led toour final break. I had to go to Germany to arrange some legal affairs. I knewReich trusted them, so I left them in charge of our group. She came along to ameeting one day with a great wooden phallus—what you would call a dildo. Sheclaimed it had been used by an African tribe for the ceremonial deflowering ofcaptured virgins before they were sacrificed. You know that it is one of ourbasic principles that our exercises in intimacy should stop short of sexualinter­course. This is not because we regard it as bad, you understand, butbecause it releases the tension too quickly, and the tension should be built upuntil it can be used to transform the mind. [I thought of the Huldeians andtheir ceremonies with sacred virgins.] These two—these Dunkelmans—did not try tocontra­dict this idea directly. But they insisted that some of our intimacyexercises should culminate in a sort of priest making love to a woman with thedildo, and squirting warm milk into her at the moment of orgasm. Of course, theyall enjoyed this, and the girls used to get so excited that they all screamed asthe woman had an orgasm. Of course, the “priest” was usually Klaus Dunkel­man.He used to insist on being fully dressed, in an evening suit, but with his penissticking out of his trousers, and painted with bright colours like a snake.(Reich said that the Dunkelmans had every perversion described by Freud.)Fortunately, I came back after this had been going on only a short time. TheDunkelmans asked for a democratic vote of the members to decide who wanted tocontinue the practice. [Here Körner went red, and the veins stood out on hisforehead.] I told them there would be no vote. It was contrary to my ideas, andif they disagreed, they could go and form their own group. I offered to resigncompletely and form another group elsewhere. But of course, nobody wanted that—Ihad become the father figure. Only the Dunkelmans thought it would be a goodidea. I had to expel them. After this, they tried to start their own groups,without success. But you see [here he raised his finger like a prophet summoningheavenly fire] they possess no intellectual foundations. In short, they arebrainless.’ He pointed his finger at me. ‘And that is why they are so anxious togain your support. Your ideas would win them disciples. You would become FrauDunkelman’s lover . . .’‘God forbid’, I said.‘But you would. She knows how to gain power over men, as you saw. When she was amember of our group, she always wore the most beautiful underwear, as if she wasa ravishing young girl instead of an old harridan of fifty. And I know she foundmany lovers.’Angela asked: ‘Do you think she possesses some hypnotic powers, then?’‘No! Of course not. What you have just told me is simply a proof of what I havebeen explaining to you. The sexual gulf between human beings is not natural.Even the healthiest people are full of repressions. You are a rather puritanicalgirl—I would be prepared to guess that you have only had one lover? [Shenodded.] So then. This woman not only speaks frankly about sex and the need toabandon repressions; she demonstrates what she means. The balance between yourreason and your sexual energies is disturbed. The energies burst out like lavafrom a volcano, and you think she has bewitched you. You are doing it yourself.’He smiled happily at the completeness of his demon­stration. Angela said:‘And when she rang this evening . . .’‘It happened again! You were reminded!’ He suddenly understood what she hadsaid. ‘She rang you? What for?’ Angela told him, and he shook his head. ‘Ah, thecunning devils. I told you he was a murderer? In any country but Switzerland, hewould have been executed. The Swiss are too tolerant.’As midnight struck, he looked at his watch, and sprang to his feet like a Hussarleaping to attention. ‘I must leave you. Tomorrow is a difficult time for me.’He looked at us thought­fully. ‘I must be frank with you. My group is closelyintegrated because we have worked together for years, so new members are kept ona long probation. But in this case, I feel that haste is justified. I hadalready decided to ask friend Gerard to an intimacy group. If you two would alsolike to come along . . .’ Six hours before, both would have refused promptly;now they were so under his spell that they accepted with enthusiastic gratitude.I asked when.‘Tomorrow afternoon. You have a car?’Alastair nodded.‘Good. I shall send someone to fetch you at midday tomorrow. You will realisewhy I cannot give you the address.’He clicked his heels, bowed slightly, and left. I expected Alastair and Angelato hurry off to bed—I was ready to sleep—but I had forgotten they were both morethan fifteen years my junior. They began discussing what he had said, and keptappealing to me for my opinion. I was too tired to speak about my reservations.Then Angela asked him if he had been shocked about the episode of the taxi. Heflinched, then rose to it. ‘Not exactly shocked. Rather jealous. I suppose Ikind of think of you as part of the family.’She asked: ‘And what do you think of jealousy if we all followed Otto’s ideas?’(We were all on first-name terms.)‘I don’t know. Animals get jealous, don’t they?’‘That’s not the same. Otto said we’re not trying to get back to the animal.We’re trying to combine the animal’s naturalness with human intelligence.’I could see she would make an admirable disciple; she already had all theanswers at her fingertips.He said pacifically: ‘I suppose you’re right.’‘Of course I am. I love Gerard. [I blinked.] I love you too. Gerard likes youand you like Gerard. Why shouldn’t we treat one another as if we belonged to thesame family?’I felt that her logic was getting slightly mixed, but I said nothing. Finally, Iyawned, and intimated that I wanted to sleep. The bed-settee was in the room wewere sitting in. At this, she proposed that they should let me alone, and go andcontinue their discussion in his room. I opened up the settee, changed into mypyjamas, and was asleep within minutes. I woke at one point when the doorclicked; in the light from the window, I saw a naked figure—I could not tell ifit was Alastair or Angela—go to the bathroom. Then it re-emerged, and went backinto the bedroom. I sank back into a heavy sleep. The sunlight woke me at aboutfive o’clock. I opened my eyes, and was mildly surprised to find Angela’s headon the pillow beside me. When I stirred, I was even more surprised to find thatAlastair was lying on the other side of her. I went to the bathroom, thenclimbed into Angela’s empty bed, and slept for another four hours. I am notopposed to ‘intimacy’, but for sleeping purposes I prefer a bed to myself. The telephone rang five times that morning. We assumed it to be Anna Dunkelman,and left it unanswered. The sixth time, Alastair answered it; it was AnnaDunkelman. Alastair said we were both out for the day, and rang off beforefurther compli­cations could develop.At a quarter to midday, there was a ring at the doorbell. A powerfully-built,bullet-headed youth stood there. We invited him in, and he sat on the settee,looking shy. He refused tea and coffee, explaining that he did not drink either.We asked him what we should take with us for the weekend; he shook his headvaguely and said: ‘Er . . . nothing.’ His name was Chris Ramsay, and he hardlyseemed the type to be a disciple of Körner’s; there was something innocent andvery likeable about him, but he hardly seemed to be a man of ideas. He talkedabout wrestling, water-skiing and parachute jumping. We threw a few clothes intoone case, and went out of the house with Chris. He was driving a small sportscar. He suggested that I drive with him, and that the other two should follow inAngela’s Cortina. We drove off up the Edgware Road, then cut across to Barnetand Potters Bar. We drove through Welwyn Garden City, then turned off the mainroad. A mile or so farther on, we came to a long red-brick wall, with treesbehind it. Two peeling gateposts in whitewashed cement led to a drive full ofpotholes. The house was a fairly large but dilapidated Regency structure. Thelawns and flower beds were, on the whole, better tended than the house.The afternoon was mild and delicious. There was a smell of cut grass in the air,and the sound of water from a small weir behind the house. Chris told me theplace had belonged to one of Gurdjieff’s groups, and had been taken over bythem. Since the people in the nearby village were used to the oddities ofGurdjieff’s disciples, they were incurious about this new group. This, as Ialready realised, was just as well; it would have provided a sensational scoopfor the News of the World. And this was brought home immediately. Since Körnerhad appar­ently not yet arrived, I strolled around the house, through the wetgrass (there had been a shower as we came through Wel­wyn). Around the back ofthe house, under the shade of the trees, two naked figures were wallowing in thegrass. They sat up, smiled at me, then went on with their rolling. One was apretty but plump girl who looked about sixteen; the other was a stringymiddle-aged man. I said: ‘Excuse me.’ As I started to go away, the girl called:‘Come and join us.’ ‘Join you in what?’ ‘It’s an intimacy-with-Nature session.The wet grass feels delicious.’ I explained that I was new here. She asked: ‘Areyou shy?’ ‘No.’ It was a challenge. ‘Then come on.’ The man seemed to be aswelcoming as the girl—in his place, I would have resented the intrusion of athird party. I stripped off my clothes—there was no embarrassment in this, for Iusually wander around the house naked when I first get out of bed—and went overto sit down. ‘Try it,’ the man said. I laid down on the grass and rolled,feeling rather foolish. But he was right; it was a delicious sensation on thenaked skin. When I’d rolled until I felt a little chilly, I went and lay in thesun, which soon dried me. The man was now lying on his back, and the girl waspulling up handfuls of the grass and rubbing it into him, caressing him with it.After a few minutes of this, she lay down on her back, with her thighs open, andhe did the same, pulling up large bunches, with earth still adhering to some ofthem, and rubbing the grass quite gently over her breasts and belly. He said tome: ‘Come and help.’ I preferred a sitting position, to hide my rising interestin the girl, whose open legs aroused Pavlovian responses; but when, after amoment of effort, this vanished, I went over to them, pulled up some grass—theyhad moved because the previous spot was denuded—and tried to rub her as the manhad; I soon gave this up and followed my own instinct, lowering the wet ends ofthe grass until it touched her sunlit breasts, then letting it descend andcaress gently. I was successful; she gave a gasp of pleasure, and moved her hipssensuously. She said to the man: ‘He has a marvellous touch.’ I used the grassas I might have used my tongue if I had been trying to arouse her. When Ireached her navel, she opened her thighs wider.At this point, the man turned away and said: ‘I think I’ll go and bathe in thestream.’ He walked away quickly with his back to us. I said: ‘I’m afraid he’snot dead to the sins of the flesh’, and she burst into a gurgle of laughter thatbroke off in a gasp as I applied a fresh and cold bundle of grass. She saiddreamily: ‘I wish we were in a bedroom.’ ‘I didn’t think you were allowed thatkind of thing.’ ‘We’re not, strictly. But we haven’t all got your control.’Sighing, she moved on to her elbows, then buried her head against my thighs. Thewarmth of her mouth around me was delicious, but I was nervous in case anyoneshould come; we were completely exposed, with the house on one side—and anyonewho might be looking out of the windows—and the man who might return from thestream at any moment. I put my hands in her hair and gently pressed her away.‘Later. Not now.’ She said: ‘Promise?’ I said yes, and she moved back on to thegrass. It cost an effort to cause my flesh to subside, but I succeeded.I heard a car arrive on the other side of the house. The man was returning fromthe stream. I said: ‘I think I ought to go and look for Dr Körner.’ As I pulledmy clothes on again, I noticed that my loss of control had lowered the level ofthe intensity I had felt earlier. The girl lay there in the sun, her eyesclosed, a smile on her parted lips, looking as if she was having a slow-burningorgasm.It was not Körner, but a car containing four bespectacled young women, lookinglike schoolteachers or computer operators, and a thin young man wearing thickglasses. But I found Körner inside, in the large, bleak hall that seemed to befull of battered statuettes of Greek discus-throwers and goddesses with bunchesof grapes. Körner looked busy, directing where these should be placed; but whenhe saw me, he came over with a warm smile, shook my hand heartily, then held uphis hand for silence. The others came and gathered round, and Körner introducedme as the well-known author and philosopher. They all looked im­pressed. I foundthe build-up embarrassing; they were looking at me as if they expected me torise slowly from the ground. Körner took me by the arm. ‘One of our group is anantique dealer, and he has presented us with these. Some of them are not veryartistic, but we shall allot them as symbols to individual members.’‘Symbols?’‘For them to meditate on.’ He evidently felt that this was self-explanatory, forhe said: ‘Let me show you the rest of the house.’It was large and rather draughty, the kind of place that could only be madecomfortable by a millionaire. Körner and his students were trying to do itthemselves; and certainly a few of the rooms were impressively comfortable,indicating that at least some of the students could afford to present goodfurniture.Körner showed me to a sunlit bedroom. ‘This is where you will sleep. Unless, ofcourse, you prefer to join the intimacy group below.’‘They sleep together?’‘Yes, but with perfect chastity, of course. It is no hardship for them torestrain their desires. They know they are gaining a new intensity by doing so.’He went off into his lecturing manner, picking up a chunk of electric wire thatsome electrician had left on the window-seat. ‘You see, the reason that sex isso dis­appointing to most people is that they are like a thin wire that canhardly carry any current. You will agree that sexual ecstasy is like an electriccurrent? If you are healthy and you have been restraining your desires for along time, it becomes a high-voltage current. That is our whole aim—to turn usinto a heavy wire, like this one.’ He waved the thick copper wire under my nose.‘Once the wire can carry the current, the current will not be lacking. I thinkyou would agree with this?’I said I did; I knew that intense self-discipline increases one’s capacity forecstasy. But before I could express certain reserva­tions, Körner laid his handon my arm.‘And now, I wish to speak to you. You will gather that I have a purpose inbringing you here. Come and sit down.’ He evidently felt that this was serious.We sat in the sunlight in the window-seat. ‘It is not simply that I want you tobecome a member of our group—that is self-evident. You are completely qualifiedfor it. I would like you to become my second-in-command, my lieutenant—andeventually, my successor.’ He held up his hand to stop me interrupting. ‘You donot have to make a decision now, or even next week or next month. I want you tosee how we work, see whether you feel we could help you, or you could help us.You see, you have integrity. Most of the people around me are good students, butso far I do not see the qualities necessary for a leader. The Dunkelmans wantedto be leaders—but they would simply have turned our group into a kind ofbrothel, a personal harem for the two of them. Work like this requires purededication, the scientific spirit. You have this.’I made apologetic noises, and said I would need time to make up my mind. Deepinside me, I knew this was out of the question; I am a loner, not simply byinclination, but by nature. I didn’t want to mix with all these people.He patted my shoulder. ‘Of course. Take as long as you like. But there is onething I had better tell you frankly. So far, we have tried to keep ouractivities fairly quiet, because they could be misunderstood. But now the timehas come to go out and show ourselves openly, to make converts, to tell theworld of our aims. Because our aim is to prove that civilisation will never bestable until everyone thinks as we do.’He had become very serious, and I was not entirely unsym­pathetic; but suddenlyI thought of Anna Dunkelman’s picture of strangers masturbating one another onbuses, and found it necessary to stare out of the window to control my face. Aswe went downstairs, I said:‘I think this is a great idea. Angela and Alastair were com­pletely bowled overlast night. You’ve made two enthusiastic converts there.’‘Good. But we shall not be satisfied until I can say the same of you.’ As weapproached the group, still busily arranging statues, he gripped my arm. ‘Forthe moment, treat what I have told you in strict confidence.’ At two o’clock, lunch was announced. In the dining room, look­ing out on thelawn, a simple meal had been laid out on trestle tables—two huge tureens ofsoup, plates piled with cubes of cheese, whole-wheat rolls and biscuits. Körnerintroduced me to a bearded young man named Paul, who seemed to be hisassist­ant. Paul had horn-rimmed glasses, a northern accent, and an intenselyserious manner. He explained:‘We try to eat light meals. Otherwise, the body has too much trouble digestingfood, and the discipline does no good. This is actually a pretty large meal. Ourother group—the over-forties—eat much less.’ I gathered that Körner kept the twogroups separate, and had meetings on alternate weekends. Paul said:‘We have to be practical about this. Theoretically, there’s no age limit, ofcourse. But it’s our experience that older people are more interested in sexthan young ones. And if we allowed too many of them to join, the young oneswould leave. A lot of young girls don’t seem to mind older men, but young boysdon’t often take to women over forty. Of course, the groups can inter­mingle, tosome extent—but only by special invitation.’ This, apparently, explained thepresence of a number of men and women who were obviously over forty—even overfifty.There were about sixty people present in the hall, with a slight predominance ofwomen. They struck me as a fairly average group of people. I noticed that thereseemed to be a fashion among the women for long-sleeved dresses and spectacleswith rather heavy frames, giving them a studious appearance. There were noteenagers present; the girl I had seen in the garden seemed to be one of theyoungest there. I observed that a large proportion of the men seemed stronglybuilt, or wore bulky polo-neck sweaters to give an impression of size. Very fewof those present were strikingly good-looking, but I saw no one who wasdownright unattractive. The women, on the whole, were more intelligent-lookingthan the men. I saw very few men whom I would describe as ectomorphic types. Forall their appearance of being an ‘average’ group, I got the feeling that thesemight have been more carefully selected than at first appeared.They seemed to know one another very well; there was a great deal of laughter,of pushing and jostling, of hand-shaking and kissing between acquaintances, andoffering of plates and bowls of soup to one another. I found the friendlyatmosphere impressive, although I seemed to feel a certain tension behind it, alack of casualness and relaxation.Paul went off to speak to someone; a voice in front of me said: ‘Hello’, and Ifound myself looking down into the brown eyes of the girl I had met on the lawn.We were pressed together in the crowd, and as she smiled up, her hand reachedbehind her and gave my genitals a friendly squeeze. She said: ‘My name’s Tessa’,and beckoned me to bend my head. She whispered: ‘I don’t want lunch. Let’s go tobed.’ ‘I’m hungry.’ ‘Spoilsport.’ ‘Besides, they’d notice. I’m being givenspecial treatment.’ Paul came back, and frowned at her disapprovingly; I got thefeeling she was regarded as a disruptive influence.I ate my bread and cheese, and drank my soup. Then we went out of the frenchwindows and on to the lawn. A group of people were standing in a circle, andseemed to be doing some kind of exercises. They placed their hands on eachother’s shoulders, then moved forward, then leaned forward and drew together ina sharp knot like a Rugby fifteen. Paul said:‘This is a warm-up intimacy group. They’re trying to get rid of the constraintof urban life—touching one another, doing things together, trying to get rid ofthe feeling of separateness.’ A young man in a white polo-neck sweater wascalling out in­structions to the group, occasionally moving in among them andslapping someone on the shoulders or back. As I stood there, he went up to awoman of about forty, and did something to her breasts—apparently rearrangingher bra through her sweater—and ending by sharply slapping her buttock as if shewas a cow being driven into a field. Paul said:‘You see, they like being given orders. It helps them to throw off the feelingof responsibility—civilisation neurosis. The aim is to make them feel likeinnocent children again.’I noticed that the people in this ‘intimacy group’ were all dressed ratherheavily, in view of the heat. Paul explained that this was part of theprocedure; as they got rid of their sense of oppression, they could dress inlighter clothes. ‘You’ll see what I mean this evening.’I mentioned my chief misgiving: that since sex comes so naturally to humanbeings, all the high-minded aims of a group like this would tend to blur intomutual sexual excitation. He nodded in agreement.‘In a group of this size, it’s bound to happen to some extent, of course. We tryto take precautions. But you’d be surprised how little it happens. There are notaboos here, no repressions, and that makes a great difference.’We went back in the house. I asked him what he meant by ‘precautions’. ‘I’llshow you.’ We went up to a room on the first floor which I knew to be a women’sdormitory. Paul walked in without knocking. Half a dozen women were lying onbeds powdering their noses, and one was sitting in a bra and panties, taking offher stockings. They smiled at us, and seemed uncon­cerned. Paul went over to abed that had an open case lying on it, and tipped it upside down on the bed. Hescattered its con­tents over the surface of the bed—a grey woollen mini-dress,tights, underwear, some cosmetics—and glanced into a pink washing-case. No oneseemed to pay any attention. ‘I’m looking for contraceptives. It’s the surestway of telling if anyone intends to break the rules.’ He picked up the casebelonging to the woman who was still dressing. She said: ‘Oh, for heaven’s sakedon’t mess everything up. Let me show you.’ She took the gar­ments out one byone, opened them out and gave them a brief shake. Paul pointed to a pair of pinkFrench knickers. ‘They’re not much good.’ ‘I know. I left in a hurry and threwin the first thing I saw.’Outside, he explained: ‘We have spot checks every weekend, to see if they’vebrought contraceptives. Of course, we’ve no way of knowing if they’ve taken thePill.’‘Doesn’t that rather invalidate it?’‘Oh no. Otto advises against the Pill for health reasons any­way.’‘How about the men?’‘They’re checked by women. Anyone’s allowed to check anyone else. We try to be asingle family.’‘Why did you object to that girl’s knickers?’‘Wide legs. There’s no rule about it, of course, but if people intend to havesex, those panties are ideal—if the lights go on suddenly, the girl’s fullydressed.’‘The women are supposed to keep their panties on, then?’ I asked, thinking aboutTessa on the lawn.‘Oh no.’ He looked almost shocked. ‘That would miss the whole point of ourgroup—intimacy. But if they’re going to be caressed, they have to pull themdown, at least around their thighs.’ He went on earnestly: ‘You don’t seem tounderstand. We’re not trying to regiment people. But you know yourself that themore obstacles there are, the more interesting it becomes. So we try toprescribe silk panties with fairly tight legs, so that if they’re tempted tohave intercourse, the girl would have to take them right off. We don’t much likecrêpe nylon or French knickers because you can pull the leg aside too easily.Some of these things are no protection at all.’There was the sound of a gong from the hall. ‘What happens now?’‘We have lectures until five. I have to lecture myself, so I shall have to leaveyou. Attendance at lectures is compulsory, by the way. Anyone who skips lecturesis not really serious. We don’t tell newcomers that—it helps us to weed outpeople who come for the wrong motives.’ He advised me to wander around thevarious lectures, and to ask questions if I felt so inclined.I took his advice. The ‘students’ divided into four groups. Körner spoke to one;Paul to another; Chris to a third; and an attractive but slightlyschoolmistressy woman called Gwyneth to the fourth. I was glad to see thatAngela and Alastair were sitting eagerly in the front row of Körner’s group,which was out on the lawn. I sat at the back of this for twenty minutes or so,and heard him explaining why he was a materialist. ‘Idealists’, he explained,believe that such things as life, thought, ideas, can exist apart from matter,in some sense. His arguments against this view were devastating and, for me,completely convincing. As far as I was concerned, of course, they missed thepoint. I agree that minds and mental processes are inseparably linked withmatter; but I still believe that life has somehow entered matter from outside,not that it is an emanation of matter, as fire is an emanation of coal.I had a feeling that Körner would not welcome questions, so I moved on to thenext group, the lady named Gwyneth. She was giving an enthusiastic but, Ithought, rather muddled sum­mary of Reich’s ideas, and her talk about ‘vitalfluid’ that accumulates in the loins in sexual excitement seemed to medangerously close to Reich’s orgone energy. I wondered how Körner would feelabout all this. Gwyneth tried to draw me actively into the discussion, whichsoon became lively. Her group struck me as intelligent, and moreindependent-minded than I had expected—they disagreed with her on a great manypoints. I made some attempts to explain my own theories of the origin of thesexual impulse, and my theory of symbolic response, but I could see they foundthis very strange and, as one lady said, ‘unnecessarily abstract’. Thediscussion became so warm that we were all surprised when members of othergroups strolled on to the lawn and told us it was time for tea.In fact, we did not drink tea—which Körner disliked—but sanka—caffeinlesscoffee. We also ate wheaten biscuits spread thinly with butter. Gwyneth tookcharge of me, and told me she found my ideas fascinating. I found her verylikeable. About forty years of age, with a fresh, pink complexion, and ratherlarge, white teeth that made her smile amiable and dazzling, she tended toexaggerate the school-marmish style that seemed to be the prescribed fashion,wearing a long-sleeved black dress, and a necklace of gold leaves with a crosson it. I gathered she was on her local parish council, and held a good job in apublic relations firm. She had an enthusiastic and slightly woolly way ofdiscussing ideas that had its own charm; but I could not imagine how she had gotinto Körner’s group.After tea, we all went into the main room. This had little furniture, but goodcarpets that looked as if they had cost as much as all the rest of the furnitureput together. (Gwyneth explained that they were ‘donations’ from older members;I had my suspicions that some of the older members bought their way into thegroup with expensive gifts over and above the fees.) Although it was now growingchilly outside, this room was warmed by a log fire that burned in the hugefireplace. Now the people broke up in small intimacy groups, and I moved fromone to another, watching their activities with interest. And it soon becameclear that the earlier part of the day had been a mere prelude; this was thebeginning of the serious part. They joined into tight knots, pressing very closetogether, running their hands over one another’s bodies, starting at the ankles,moving up to the head. Many of the groups split into pairs, and repeated thepressing and fondling operation. There was nothing specific­ally sexual aboutthis; I noticed that hands lingered only briefly in the erogenous zones, butseemed much more interested in heads and in arms. A tall, thin girl drew me intoa group as I stood watching, and began to stroke me, pressing her hands togetheron my belly or chest, and then drawing them apart, pressing hard. After this, Idid the same to her, standing behind her, pressing my hands tight against herbelly, then massaging her as far as the hips. I repeated this operation on herbreasts and thighs; then, in accordance with her instructions, began to strokethe outsides of her legs, beginning at the waist and running my hands over herdress, down to her feet. I noticed she was wearing a suspender belt andstockings. After this, she caressed my shoulders, arms and head, running herfingers through my hair, along my cheeks, opening my mouth and putting herfinger­tips in, inserting her little finger into my ears. What she was doing wascaressing me as if we were lovers; but since we remained fully clothed, it had astrange quality of excitement, of the forbidden. If we had been alone, partlyundressed, it would have ended in coitus within minutes; this lingering mas­sagein a room with fifty or so other people had the effect of creating a new set ofresponses, breaking old habits.I observed that some other couples had fetched bowls of water and were washingone another’s hair; they did this near the open french windows, where there wasno carpet. The couples frequently split up and changed partners; after tenminutes of caressing the thin girl, I got a more heavily-built middle-agedwoman. At first I felt that the change was no benefit; but after five minutes ofcaressing, I noticed that we had achieved the effect of intimacy, of knowing andliking one another. After this, I got Tessa, who smiled and whispered in amock-seductive voice: ‘I’m afraid this is bound to be an anticlimax.’ To someextent she was right. My trousers concealed no secrets from her; neither did herdress from me. But the feeling of her softness through the dress was exciting.She made something of a joke of it, slipping her hand under my sweater andpinching my nipples hard. When I massaged her, and pushed her dress between herthighs, she said: ‘I hope no one examines me now. I’m soaked.’ ‘Is thatforbidden?’ ‘Of course. But I can’t help it. If people feel me down there, Ijust have an orgasm. I’ve had two already.’ After a few more minutes, she said:‘I’m bloody hungry. I’ve got a lot of chocolate in my room, if you want some.’‘Is that allowed?’ ‘Not really. But all this intimacy makes me ravenous.’At half past seven, the gong sounded, and Tessa said: ‘Thank God for that.’ Weall streamed into the dining room. I needed food. All the excitement made mefeel as if I’d walked twenty miles. The supper was slightly less sparse than theearlier meals: huge plates of cold beef and ham, tureens of tomato soup, hotvegetables (no potatoes), and wheat biscuits. To my surprise, I observed thatthere was also a bar, and Gwyneth—who took charge of me—told me I could havebeer or wine. She explained that there was no heavy drinking, but that a littlealcohol helped most people to relax and enjoy their meal. I observed withinterest that the ‘intimacy’ went on in the dining hall. Men and women, jostlingtogether, took the opportunity to caress one another, and even to kiss. Therehad been a certain amount of kissing in the previous session—of the arms andneck, mostly; now, I saw, they often greeted one another with kisses on themouth. Although some of these kisses were lingering, none could be described aspassionate, in the sense of indicating a desire to get into bed.I ate well, and a glass of beer greatly refreshed me. After the meal, I made myway across the hall to the toilet, but it proved to be occupied. I made my wayupstairs to a place where I recalled seeing a sign—a rather demure sign showinga man’s top hat and a lady’s handbag, with an arrow underneath point­ing downthe corridor. I followed its direction, and found myself in what was obviously anewly built toilet, with a number of booths as in public lavatories. But therewas no indication on the door as to whether this was a ladies or gents. As Istood there, footsteps sounded along the corridor; to my relief, I saw it wasTessa.‘I’m glad to see you. Which is the gents?’‘Oh, either. We don’t have two. Intimacy, see? Are you coming?’‘I suppose so.’ I had to admit to feeling shy, but could see that this wasillogical. I went into the end cubicle—and realised, with a shock, that the wallthat divided it from the next was made of glass. Tessa went into the next oneand grinned at me. Then, without self-consciousness, she hitched up her dress,pushed her panties down to her knees, and sat down. I said:‘Good God, this is a bit much, isn’t it?’‘I thought so when I came. But you soon get used to it.’‘But I don’t like farting where I can be heard.’‘Why worry? Dr Körner says it’s a natural voice of the body, like your speakingvoice.’I felt silly standing there, and so lowered my trousers and sat down. I hadnever felt less like relieving myself. Then more voices sounded outside, and twomore women came in. They moved to the cubicles at the other end, bared theirbehinds, and sat down—the glass was exceptionally clear. They did not evenglance at us, but went on talking about what Körner had said that afternoon.Their voices relaxed me, and the spring inside me unwound. Watching Tessa cleanherself with paper made me reflect that we are all more inhibited creatures thanwe recognise, and that once again Körner was probably right. But I made a noteto use the ground-floor toilet in future; that had ordinary walls. I wentdownstairs with Tessa.When I went back into the main hall, I found that most of the students weresitting on the floor on cushions. As I came in, Körner, who was standing nearthe fire, beckoned to me. I went over to him. He banged a bottle on a table forsilence, then said:‘And now I want to introduce you all to the noted novelist and philosopher,Gerard Sorme, who has been described as the most interesting British writersince Aldous Huxley and D. H. Lawrence. [I think he invented this on the spur ofthe moment.] Mr Sorme’s views on sex differ from ours in many respects, and I amnow going to ask him to say a few words about them. I should tell you that Ihave not warned him about this, so it will be completely impromptu.’I had no time to be surprised or nervous. I stood up and sketched my theory ofthe sexual impulse, its intentional nature, and the way that it illustrates myphenomenological theory of all human interaction with the world. When I feltthat I was losing them in Husserl, I talked of my feeling of the sexual impulseas a ‘key to the keepers of the keys of being’, and the relation between sex andthe mystical experience. I ended by trying to explain my most fundamental point:that sex gives us a glimpse of a concentration of the mind that would make usgod-like if we could command it in other spheres. I mentioned my idea that humanbeings are like grandfather clocks driven by watch-springs; that the body is tooheavy for the tiny spring of will-power. Only in sex do we seem to develop aspring powerful enough for a grandfather clock. I ended by saying that my owncentral interest was in the question of how to learn to tap the immense springsof the will.The discussion that followed was interesting, but not entirely to the point.Several people raised the objection that to allow such importance to the willwas dangerous. They were arguing a view similar to Lawrence’s—and Körner’s. Icould see that this was where I differed from them all; I did not distrust thewill or the intellect.It had been a long day, and I was feeling tired. It was now nearly teno’clock—time had passed very quickly—and I was beginning to feel like sleeping.It had all been very interesting and promising, and I felt Körner was on tosomething important; but it would take a great deal of thinking to clarify myattitude towards it all. I hoped that the evening would now break up intosomething more purely social, and that I could slip off to bed. And it was all along way from Esmond and Horace Glenney.Körner thanked me, and said he hoped that they would be seeing a great deal moreof me; then he introduced them to Angela and Alastair, who had to stand up,looking embarrassed. Everyone clapped politely, and began to stand up and moveout of the room. I asked Körner: ‘What now?’‘Ah, now the most interesting part begins. We have another intimacy session.’I was not entirely pleased. The previous one had been pleasant but tiring; Ididn’t feel like stretching my faculties again. He beckoned to me, and Ifollowed him out of the room, wondering if he would resent it if I suggestedskipping this final session. I started to speak, then changed my mind. Instead,I asked:‘I’d like to ask you about Esmond Donelly some time.’He looked at me and smiled.‘I think I may be able to tell you some interesting things. But we can discussthat later. Now we have other things to do.’ I followed him, rather wearily, upthe stairs. We turned right, and I thought we were going to the girls’dormitory. But he unlocked a door next to it, and went in. I followed him. Itwas a small room that had probably been a store-room, but was now empty exceptfor a few high stools. One wall contained a large window. To my surprise,Gwyneth was standing in front of it, rearranging her hair and staring in at us.‘This is a two-way mirror, of course.’It was the first one I had ever seen. ‘Are you sure she can’t see us?’‘Not unless I do this.’ He reached up and pressed a switch. Immediately, thewindow became a mirror in which I could see my face. ‘Now she can see us. I havereversed the polarity.’ He flicked the switch again, and Gwyneth smiled at usand waved through the window. I waved back, forgetting she could no longer seeus.‘What is it for?’‘For observation. You will see that the women are now chang­ing.’ This was true.In the crowded dormitory, women were stripping off dresses, underskirts andsuspender belts. Gwyneth, without self-consciousness, reached back behind herneck and undid a button, then pulled down her zip. She carefully peeled off thedress, and folded it on the bed. She was wearing a black underslip with a lacyhem that looked very fetching. She seemed to have forgotten us. She slipped offthe shoulder straps, and let it fall round her feet. She was apparently notentirely in favour of black underwear; she was wearing a white bra, a blacksus­pender belt that held up black stockings, and small white panties of lacycrêpe nylon. Evidently she was exempt from the rule that women should wearpanties that could not be stretched too far. Most of the other women I could seehad adhered to it. None were wearing bikini briefs. Most of them wore the pinkor blue satin things that completely encase the stomach, with elastic at thewaist, although in my own experience the elastic in the leg of these has a greatdeal of yield, and, pulled down an inch or two, they present no problem.A few other men joined us as we stood there. I saw that the women were allputting on grey woollen mini-skirts of the kind I had noticed earlier in the dayin the cases we had inspected.Körner said: ‘Come, it is time to change.’I had noticed that most of the men were now wearing a similar uniform of greyflannels and white T-shirt. We went towards the men’s dormitory on the nextfloor. The question I was about to ask was answered when a door next to itopened, and I saw several women standing in there, evidently watching the menundressing through a similar two-way mirror. Körner called in sharply: ‘Comealong, ladies. No more voyeurism. Time to change.’ They all hurried out; Inoticed Tessa was amongst them. And as we went into the dormitory, I turned andsaw that she slipped back into the observation room.In the dormitory, most of the men seemed to be nearly naked, and the onestanding near the mirror actually was. I asked Körner:‘What is the exact point of the mirrors?’‘Most people have a touch of the exhibitionist in them, even the most stable.And most people have a touch of the Peeping Tom. Here they can gratify itwithout feeling guilty. There is almost no sexual urge that has to be concealedin this place. We try to bring it all into the open, to make it straightforwardand above-board. Now, I think those trousers you are wearing will be suitable.You only need a shirt.’ He called to Paul, who was fully dressed, to find me ashirt. A few minutes later, Paul came back with a thin cotton T-shirt. Iobserved that this was exceptionally long, and tucked it into my trousers. Inoticed that most of the men were putting on underpants—of the brief varietyadvertised in health-and-strength magazines—and white tennis shoes. Many of themwere taking showers in the next room. Körner clapped his hands and called:‘Come, gentlemen, time to get dressed. There are no ladies next door now.’ Iremembered with a start that Tessa was still in there, and that I was undressingwithin a few feet of the mirror. I hoped she enjoyed it. Or perhaps she waswatching the other men.In the main room, a huge screen had been placed in front of the fire, which waslow. I saw Angela, looking very sweet in her grey mini-skirt. I noticed that,like many other women, she was wearing stockings. This part, apparently, wasoptional. She came over to me and took my hand. I said: ‘How do you feel?’‘Fine. It’s a bit shattering losing so many inhibitions all in one weekend, butit’s a marvellous experience. I can’t tell you how grateful I am for meetingKörner.’‘I wonder what happens now?’‘Don’t you know? More intimacy. The girl on the next bed has been describing it.This is the big moment. I hope I get you. I can’t bear some of those other men.I hate hairy males.’‘But what . . . ?’ Before I could go on, Chris called: ‘Are we all here?’Various voices answered: ‘Yes.’ ‘All right. Form the circle. Paul, will you takethe light?’ I wondered where Paul was intended to take it to; as we moved into acircle, hands on shoulders, the lights went slowly down. Men scurried to arrangethemselves next to women, but since there were slightly more women than men, afew women were bound to pair. Then there was total darkness. I asked Angela:‘What do we do now?’, but a strange voice answered: ‘We all walk into thecentre, mingle together, then take the first person of the opposite sex.’ Webegan to move forward. There were a few moments of confusion. I wondered how todistinguish women from men, and ended by touching breasts. (I discovered laterthat this was normal pro­cedure.) I found a girl and took her hand tightly.Paul’s voice called: ‘All ready?’ There were shouts of ‘Yes’, ‘No’. Slowly, thelights went up. I discovered I was holding the hand of a small, blonde girl Ihad noticed earlier. She was not pretty, and her blue eyes seemed short-sighted;but she had a charming, pert face. I asked her: ‘What now?’‘We can either join with other couples, or stay on our own. Which would youprefer?’‘Let’s stay on our own for the moment.’‘All right.’I looked at my next-door neighbour—the thin girl I had been with earlier in theday—and was startled to see that she was just in the process of stepping out ofher panties. The man she was facing—a rather good-looking, nervous man in hismid-thirties—was doing the same, blushing. She handed him her panties and tookhis underpants; she donned his underpants while he climbed into her panties.‘What’s all this for?’‘The beginning of the intimacy—we can change clothes ad lib. This is the bitdesigned for the fetichists, I think. Do panties do things to you?’‘They have a definite sexual connotation.’‘In that case, we’d better change.’ Without embarrassment, she slipped off apair of pink knickers, and handed them to me. I took more time to get mytrousers off and step out of my underpants. She said: How about your shirt?’ ‘Dowe change those too?’ ‘If you’d like to.’ The crotch of her panties was damp,and its contact with my scrotum produced a twinge of sexual excitement thatdissipated the last vestige of tiredness. Obviously, such a contact is basicallya contact between the male and female genitals at one remove. I began tounderstand what Körner meant by ‘suspended orgasm’. What he had done was to filla room with men and women, and in actual or potential sexual contact with oneanother, where the sexual stimulus was maximal, but group discipline heldeverything in check. Körner stood by the fire, watching us with a benevolenteye, and I found myself wondering what he was experiencing.I gave my partner—whose name was Norma—my T-shirt, and accepted her mini-skirt,which was approximately the same length. I noticed, as she removed her dress,that her bra was the low cut type that almost allows the breasts to escape.I pulled my trousers back up, and fastened the catch. I said: ‘I don’t know whywe bother to put them back on. These mini­skirts are long enough for modesty.’‘I know. But Dr Körner thinks that the act of actually taking off his trousersdestroys inhibitions in the male. In the girl, it’s taking off her knickers.’I saw her point. Some of the others seemed to want to go on changing clothes.The good-looking young man next to us had no sooner finished dressing thananother girl approached him. This time, I saw, he did not exchange clothes withthe girl, but with her male partner, who was already, presumably, wearing herpanties and singlet.Norma said: ‘This part bores me. Let’s move away from them.’ We moved to theedge of the group. ‘Shall I do you first, or will you do me?’ I said: ‘You’dbetter do me. I’m not sure how to go about it.’ ‘Would you rather stand up orlie down?’ ‘I don’t mind.’ I saw that some of the couples were taking foldedtables, that seemed to have retractable metal legs, from a pile in the corner,and setting them up in empty spaces. They were made of aluminium, and seemed tobe about six feet long. The man or woman would lie down, as if about to receivemassage treatment, and the ‘intimacy’ would begin as before. Norma proved moreexpert than any of my previous partners; or perhaps I was more excited. Shestood in front of me, and ran her hands over my chest, stomach, thighs, thendown to my feet. When she stood up, she unzipped me, and for a moment I wonderedif we were going too far. But she only reached inside and plunged her hands downmy legs, pinching gently and stroking as far as my knees. She made me sit down,and stood behind me, running her hands through my hair, inside my shirt—or,rather, dress—over my cheeks, inside my lips. I reached to my zip, to close it,but she pushed my hand away. ‘More inhibi­tions.’ ‘Sorry.’ She leaned forward,reached inside, and stroked my thighs, letting her hand wander freely. I hadgiven up all attempts to suppress my normal reactions; now she slipped her handinside the waistband, and let her fingertips run lightly up and down my stomach,then farther down. I controlled my voice to ask: ‘Is that allowed?’ ‘Oh, yes.It’s completely up to us now. Shall I stop?’ ‘I think you’d better.’ There was aburst of laughter from next to us. Two women and the man were laughing at theshy man, who was blushing. Others began to laugh as he blushed; but Körner,standing by the fireplace, looked stern and shook his head slowly. The manturned and hurried out of the room. Norma said: ‘Poor Mr McCann. He can neverrestrain himself. I’m afraid the women take it in turns to make him losecontrol.’The strange thing was that I was no longer feeling fatigued. A strange glow hadstarted inside me.We were interrupted by a group of six: four women and two men; they wanted tochange clothes again. Norma looked resent­ful, but slipped off my underpantsresignedly. She was handed a pair of black briefs in exchange. I was given theFrench knickers that I recognised from that afternoon. I exchanged themini-skirt for a longer one, worn by a pale, intense-looking girl. When this wasover, Norma said: ‘Come on, my turn now.’ And then, with a shock, I realisedthat I had been Esmond for the past five minutes, and that this explained why Ihad been feeling slightly puzzled by these odd garments. It was as if Esmond hademerged from some depth of my consciousness to find out what was going on. Assoon as I became aware of him, the effect of double exposure increased, so thatfor a moment I felt almost sick, and the sexual excitement vanished.We had found a quiet place on the edge of the crowd. Gwyneth, no longer lookingin the least school-marmish, was leaning back against the wall, her eyes closedin an expression of almost agonised ecstasy. A man was kneeling in front of her,his cheek against her thigh. When he turned his head I saw it was Alastair.Esmond said to him: ‘Greetings, comrade’, and Alastair looked suddenly startled.Gwyneth had sunk gently to the floor, and was half-sitting, half-lying, her eyesclosed, her knees apart. Then Alastair winked at me. ‘You should try her. She’smarvellous.’ The faun-like expression on his face was new to me—but not toEsmond. I realised that this was a lineal descendant of Horace Glenney.The effect of double exposure ceased to be unpleasant, as if Esmond and I hadmade a bargain to inhabit the same body without argument. The feeling wasclearer now than it had ever been, and I could no longer believe it was some oddquirk of my subconscious.I put my arms around Norma from behind, caressed her breasts, and then, with atwist of either hand, freed them from the brassiere that held them. She sankback gently against me, and I felt her dress rough against my bare flesh. Sheleaned her head back on my shoulder, her face raised, and I bent down andtouched her lips; as I did so, she reached behind her and gripped me tightlywith her hand. She said: ‘You’re getting over-­excited.’ I continued to strokeher, enjoying her response; she was like a cat that arched its back against meand purred. I realised, with sudden awe, that she had achieved the ‘suspendedorgasm’, and then realised, a moment later, that it was not I who knew it, butEsmond. He was infinitely more experienced in such things than I.Norma suddenly said: ‘Look, there’s a table free. Let’s go over. I can’t standup any longer.’ In fact, her knees seemed to be buckling. I helped her over to atable near the fire, where Körner was standing, looking benevolently at theroom, nodding and smiling. He patted me on the shoulder. Esmond said to him:‘Greetings, dark one.’ Körner’s hand dropped, and his face went very pale. Heleaned forward and stared into my face. ‘You knew all the time?’ ‘I’m not afool, domine’, Esmond said. Körner said quietly: ‘So you’ve been playing withme.’ It was not a question. ‘But why?’ I was touched by his expression of saddignity; I wanted to explain to him, but it was too ridi­culous. Then Körnerseemed to pull himself together. He pursed his lips, gave a wry smile, andshrugged. Then he went towards the door, and out of the room. I said: ‘What thedevil do you mean?’ But Esmond ignored me.Norma was lying on the table, her eyes closed, apparently asleep. I went over toher, and slipped off her shoes. Her small feet looked very white. I bent downand kissed the sole of her foot, and then took the toes in my mouth. She stirredand sighed. I moved my head up and kissed her thighs, at the same time slippingmy hand into the waist of the panties. This time she gasped and made no attemptto stop my explorations. In spite of the people around us, it was hard to resistthe temptation to move on to her.Glancing around the room, I saw that Esmond and I were among the last on ourfeet. I now understood why the carpet was so thick. Prostrate bodies were lyingeverywhere. I could see Angela, lying on her back, her legs open, withoutpanties, appar­ently fast asleep; Paul was lying beside her, one hand on herthigh, his eyes also closed. Gwyneth, who seemed indefatigable, was now naked,lying on the carpet, a man sucking her breasts. Another was stroking her legsand stomach, as her hips rose and fell gently. Other figures were entangled inabsurd configurations that looked as if they had been dreamed up by apornographer with a sense of the grotesque.Norma was holding my hand tightly, to prevent it escaping, and moving her thighsup and down with it trapped between them. As I looked down at her, a memorystirred; I tried to fix it, but it evaded me. I made another effort, staringhard at the rounded golden flesh of her thighs. It came to me that Esmond hadseldom made love to sunburned women. Although there was as little prudery in hisday as in our own, clothes were regarded as a part of the essential humanity ofmen and women; naked sunbathing would have been regarded as a curiouseccentricity. So the thighs of Esmond’s mistresses were always white and soft.And then, in some way that I fail to understand, Esmond and I ceased to be twomen inhabiting the same body, and were suddenly identified. To explain thiswould be of far more interest than to describe the mere physical events of thenext few hours; but I cannot do it. Language was not made to express thesubtleties of the human psyche. I can only say this: it is almost impossible forhuman beings genuinely to forget themselves, to escape their obsessiveself-preoccupation, and to realise that there is a world outside them. Blakeunderstood that every bird that cuts the airy way is ‘an immense world ofdelight, closed to your senses five’. But here, suddenly, in a flash, I wasinside somebody else’s consciousness, a human being whose life and experiencehad been in every way different from my own. It brought a feeling of tremendousdelight and freedom. It was like being let out of a coalmine. What had suddenlyvanished permanently was that basic fear that enters the mind of all intelligentpeople at some time in their lives: that they are really the only person in theuniverse, that life is an elaborate joke, a film show created by a bored god whoknows he is alone, and who has given himself amnesia to forget his loneliness.For here was Esmond’s conscious­ness, as undeniably real and elaborate as myown, mingled with my own.And in a flash I understood the meaning of sex. It is a craving for the minglingof consciousness, whose symbol is the mingling of bodies. Every time a man and awoman slake their thirst in the strange waters of the other’s identity, theyglimpse the immensity of their freedom.Esmond’s memory was far more powerful than my own. Because of the powers he haddeveloped, he could recall past epochs of his life with incredible vividness.And this, I now saw, was why he had chosen me. I have always been aware thathuman life is dream-like because most human beings exist pas­sively. Theirconsciousness is little more than a reflection of their environment. In thesexual orgasm, the voltage power of their minds surges, and they becomemomentarily aware that they are not forty-watt bulbs, but two hundred and fifty,five hundred, a thousand. . . . Then the voltage drops, and they sink back toforty watts without a protest. They are like empty-headed fools who cannotremember anything for more than a few seconds. Human beings are so mediocre thatthey can scarcely be said to possess minds in any real sense. In a flash, Iunderstood the absurd and obvious truth: nothing is worth possessing exceptintensity of consciousness. This is the truth we glimpse in the orgasm. If humanbeings understood it—if their minds were not so incapable of understanding eventhe simplest things—they would abandon all other pursuits for this one. Whatdoes it matter where you are, what you are doing, how much you possess, if yourmind is limp and feeble?—just as the most beautiful surroundings mean nothing toa man suffering from a fever. On the other hand, because Esmond had understoodthis, and pursued the secret, he had solved the problem that occupied Proustthroughout the twelve volumes of the Recherche du Temps Perdu, the problem ofhow to tap our enormous and unimpaired stores of memory. If I try to recall mychildhood, my memories are a dim carbon copy of the real thing. Yet someaccident, like Proust’s biscuit dipped in tea, can momentarily revive somedistant time as vividly as if it happened yesterday. Why is the memory sofeeble? Because consciousness is contented to run at forty watts, when it hasall the power of the universe available to it.In this moment, I recalled suddenly an event that should have taught me whatEsmond knew. A few years ago, a schoolgirl had written me a letter about one ofmy books. She sounded intelli­gent, so I met her in Cork—where she was at aconvent school. She was a dazzling girl—one of those lovely, healthy,self-confident products of a wealthy home with riding stables and great lawns.She fascinated me—not because she had any power over my emotions—which werefully committed to Diana—but because perfection always fascinates, in alandscape, a race-horse or a symphony. Apparently I fascinated her too, for shedeclared her intention of marrying me, although she was a Catholic and she knewI was married. She expected her family to use their influence to get a Papaldispensation.During the holidays, her family sent her to Dublin to stay with an aunt, and Iwas able to find opportunities to see her about once a week. The whole thing wasfairly innocent, physically. At sixteen, she was a romantic virgin; she wasinfatuated with me, but afraid of sex. And then one day, just before she was dueto return to school, she apparently decided that it was time to allow the affairto progress a stage further. It was a rainy August afternoon. We had parked insome woods at the edge of a great estate. And ten minutes or so after we hadbegun to pet in the back of the car, I realised that she had decided to allow meas many liberties as possible, without actually yielding her virginity. But herown temerity frightened her. She allowed me to unhook her bra and remove herpants, then suddenly began to worry in case anyone looked in through the windowsof the car—which were too steamed-up for anything to be visible. Aching withfrustration, I locked the doors of the car to reassure her. Then I set out tomake her forget her guilt in physical excitement. It took a long time—a verylong time. It struck me that part of her trouble was that she felt like a harlotwithout her pants, so I put them on again. This made her confident enough toallow me to lie across her, with her skirt around her waist; but when I tried tomove into a position where friction would satisfy my own excitement as well ashers, she became frightened again, and I had to start from the beginning. Ifound her so delicious that I would have happily started a hundred times over;she aroused in me the appetite of a starving man. To be in this situation,caressing the most beautiful girl I had ever kissed, seemed more like a sexualdaydream than reality. The final act of lovemaking was unimportant; absorbingher femininity was enough to slake my thirst. An hour later, when I realisedthat she had reached a pitch of excitement that dissolved all barriers, Ideliberately kept my word, and allowed my accumulated excitement to explodeharmlessly against her. It was enough that she had withdrawn all prohibitions.But as I drove home, after dropping her back in College Green, I was aware thatmy consciousness had not relapsed to its old level of fatigue. My two hours ofintense concentration had im­planted in it a habit of intensity, of refusal toallow the energies to sink back to their source in the subconscious. And as Idrove back slowly through the dark, I was aware that my mind had achieved a newlevel of power; the heartbeat of my vitality was deeper, stronger; my memoryfunctioned better than usual; my capacity for intuition was deepened. . . . Andthe long drive home failed to lessen the intensity; I arrived at dawn, feelingas fresh as when I set out from Dublin.And yet I had allowed myself to relapse back to the old level. My discovery waswasted: the knowledge that two hours of con­centrated effort can intensify themind until it approaches the vision of mystics. And now, in this room,surrounded by prostrate men and women, I rediscovered that insight. They lookedstrange to me, as if I had never seen them before. This room was not familiar.Familiarity is a function of the fatigue of consciousness; to a fully awakemind, everything seems new.I was free of sexual excitement. My chief feeling towards these people was oneof amused contempt. As Norma moved convul­sively against my hand, I felt thatshe was caught up in a reflex over which she had no control. At the same time,it struck me with great force that I was completely the master of my own sexualdesire. Whether or not these women attracted me, I could perform my malefunction. It was an interesting idea, although not particularly attractive. Itwas far more interesting to recall the exact intonation of Doctor Johnson’svoice and the aggressive outward thrust of his lower lip as he said: ‘Sir . ..’, the malicious twitch that convulsed the left corner of Voltaire’s mouthbefore he delivered himself of a witticism, the high, strained note of Shelley’svoice as he read his Adonais aloud to me. But Esmond had a point he wanted tomake, and since he was my mentor, I was willing to wait. At the moment, hewanted to demonstrate to me that sexual desire is entirely a matter ofimagination—or of intentionality, as I would say. My attitude towards Normacould be altered according to my own will. I could see her as a rather stupid,oversexed girl who was incapable of thinking beyond the pleasure of her loins,or as an incarnation of the earth goddess. And if I chose to regard her in thisway, then I should make a formal act of obeisance, like a priest before thealtar. Accord­ingly, I removed her pants, then my own, and climbed on to her.She opened her eyes in surprise for a moment, then gasped sharply as I enteredher, and began to move under me. Since this was an act of ritual worship, not ofdesire, I concentrated on giving her the maximum of pleasure, adjusting myforward drive to her movements.In spite of my detachment, it was like having sex for the first time in my life.Most of us are aware that sex is sometimes better than at other times. Enteringa girl can generate an electric shock like accidentally putting your finger intoa light socket, or it can seem dull and ordinary, a physical act like any other.This is because of the human capacity to go into a hypnotic state of blankness,of taking-for-granted. I was not only not taking Norma for granted; I was awarethat she was simultaneously every girl in the world. I felt like an eagle poisedin the air, looking down into an immense gulf.The power being generated by Esmond was affecting the others in the room. Theyfelt it as an obscure excitement, ‘a certain odour on the wind’. Some werewatching us; others were following my example and ignoring Körner’s rule againstactual copulation. I felt a hand running gently down my back, over my buttocks,then between my legs; it was Tessa, leaning over me, an oddly dreamy expressionon her face. Suddenly, I remembered whom she reminded me of; it was Minou Bauer,Esmond’s first mistress; I had not known her surname before, but now Iremembered it. I increased my speed, feeling Norma’s mounting excitement; then,as her stomach curved and pressed tightly against my own, I simulated a climax,feeling at the same time Tessa’s fingers squeezing and kneading me. Normarelaxed slowly; I withdrew. Someone said: ‘My God.’ It was Gwyneth, who wasstanding on the other side of us and staring with admiration at the member that,even to my own eyes, seemed unusually swollen. Alastair, who had just risen tohis knees from a girl I at first mistook for Angela, said with amazement:‘Incredible!’ Tessa seized my elbow and said: ‘Now me.’ Gwyneth pushed heraside, seizing me lower still, and said firmly: ‘No, me.’ As far as I wasconcerned, it made no difference. Esmond, for reasons of his own, was determinedto complete the demonstration. And although his memory was accessible to me, myown consciousness could not embrace the full extent of his intentions. I onlyknew that he intended to use my body to satisfy as many of the women who shouldchoose to call upon his services. And so, when Gwyneth leaned back against thewall, pressing the instrument of pleasure against her moist outer lips, Ireached my hand behind her, and guided it to the orifice; then, with an upwardthrust, penetrated and drove until she was pressed tightly against the wall. Theposition was not entirely comfortable, since I was taller than she. There was atable close behind me; I moved backwards and rested on its corner, drawing herastride me. She groaned, pressing down, then raised herself and plunged downquickly; I pulled her close to me, holding her tightly against me, somehowconscious of her as though she were a familiar musical instrument. It was herintention to remain there as long as pos­sible; her capacity for sexualstimulation was almost limitless, and the present situation appealed to anelement of exhibitionism in her nymphomania. Esmond had other plans; he wasskilled in the principle of the conditioned reflex; a few delicately sensualthrusts undermined her control; then a surge of what I can only describe assexual electricity made her contact points—the points of the nipples and thedistended anus—spark with an intolerable pleasure that approached pain. She gavea wailing scream, writh­ing and twisting, and I had to prevent her from fallingoff me. As I kept her pressed against me, the convulsions subsided; the moanchanged into a deep sigh. I pushed her gently off my lap, and supported her asshe sank to the carpet. The unfatigued godhead sprang upright like ajack-in-the-box, and I was startled by a burst of applause. Seated with my backto the rest of the room, I was unaware of the audience that had gathered towatch. Paul and Angela were leading the clapping and cheering. Paul said: ‘Youare a Master’, and I realised with a shock that he knew more of the Sect of thePhoenix than I had supposed. I restrained the immodest comment that Esmondstarted to make. Angela pushed towards me, but Tessa was there first, saying:‘No, it’s me’, and pressed me back against the table, trying to move on to me. Ihelped her—since she was even smaller than Gwyneth—and lifted her slightlybefore allowing her to sink down upon me. Her head collapsed on my shoulder, andshe gave a long sigh, then began to move slowly, as if tired, giving small criesas she did so, like some tiny animal being beaten. I put one hand up the T-shirtand pinched her nipple; she con­vulsed gently, her small tongue thrust deep intomy mouth, and went slack against me. As I eased her gently off me, a man with aScottish accent said loudly: ‘The man’s a freak.’It was Angela’s turn next; she pulled me over to the rug, in front of the fire,and flung herself down, her knees bent. With her, I made a new discovery. It wasas exciting as after the visit to the Dunkelmans. Obviously, there was somethingabout her, or about the psychic-chemical combination of the two of us, that madeus curiously well adapted for producing the maximum pleasure in one another.This is a factor that has seldom been observed by writers on sex, who seem tofeel that the difference between one act of intercourse and another is purely amatter of the meanings one chooses to project into it. It was so delightful withAngela that I was tempted to relax my control and cease to withhold my tribute,if only as a matter of common politeness. Five minutes would have been enoughfor recovery. But this was not part of Esmond’s purpose; he seemed to bedetermined to continue the exhibition, for reasons of his own. I began to feellike the engine of a powerful car that reaches the temperature of perfectperformance. There was no fatigue; my body seemed to hurtle forward at eightymiles an hour, the movements of my hips taking on a strangely weighted quality,almost resembling a pendulum. I increased speed to bring Angela to her climax,crushed her against me until her violence had spent itself, then moved on to thewoman who was already waiting on the other side of me. Something was happeningto me, a sense of dissocia­tion from my body, almost as if my mind had separatedfrom it, and hung above us. When I thought back on my ordinary sex life, itseemed an undisciplined waste. Each time a man moves into a girl, a god awakensin him, a god who is dissatisfied with the dreary, beetle existence we lead; whoknows that man was made for vast horizons, for infinite conquest, for a superbpurity of will. And as flesh encounters alien flesh, his brain is gripped by asharp clarity of purpose that refuses to tolerate the normal fuzziness andheaviness of the flesh. Like a superb officer, it can make this squad of sloppyrecruits we call the body drill like a crack regiment. Then the orgasm passes;the officer is forgotten, the sloppiness is back.Esmond was not doing this for fun. On one level, this was a demonstration.Without words, he was telling us that the real objection to Casanova, Don Juan,Frank Harris and the rest, is that their seductions were oases of purpose in adesert of un­discipline; they soared for a second like eagles, then plunged backinto the swamp. Esmond was telling me that the aim is to stay in the air. Whatwould we say of a general who drove out a horde of invaders, then retreated fromthe captured territory and allowed them to return immediately? But this is whathas happened to human beings; and they take it so much for granted that theinvaders plod in directly behind the retreating rearguard, with no attempt atconcealment. Esmond wanted to demonstrate that sexual intensity offers aninsight as valid as mystical vision, and far easier to induce; but if it is tobe effective, it must be disciplined with a passion equal to that of the yogi orascetic.After the fifth woman, the sex ceased to interest me; I was dazzled by the truththat had stared me in the face all my life. Every time we are deeply happy weknow that there is only one good: strength of will; and only one evil: toabnegate the will. If life is as good as we know it to be in our moments ofdelight, then all obstacles should be regarded as molehills; man should beundefeatable. As I looked around this room of naked goddesses, a deep joy rosein me. These were the mothers, the procreators of the race, whom men have alwaysenslaved and degraded. I worshipped them as divinities. Their loins are man’sentrance to the world of dreams, of greatness, of the primeval purpose that liesbehind matter. I saw no distinction between them, between the young and prettyand the tense middle-aged. The desire to serve them all was impersonal and freeof lust. I stood up, and took the hand of a thin, neurotic-looking girl who hadbeen waiting; we moved over to the corner of the room. A part of my being stoodbehind an altar draped in red velvet, in a temple of carved sandstone; I wore amask in the shape of the head of a great bird. Forty naked women stood in a rowbefore the con­gregation; their bodies shone with oil, and each held in her handa phial in which glowed a green, effervescent liquid whose nature I suddenlyunderstood. I woke up with the sunlight on my face, and with a surprising feeling ofwell-being. My muscles ached, but my body tingled with suppressed energy. Ilooked at the girl beside me—a girl whose name was unknown to me—and felt asurge of pity. Oddly enough, she had been a virgin. She had accepted me as ahusband; but I was Diana’s husband and Mopsy’s father. I have not men­tionedDiana much in the course of this narrative; but I had phoned her every day, andthought about her whenever I had time to relax and think. Unlike Esmond, I am ahome lover; now I wanted to get back to it.I slipped gently out of bed, and made my way back to my own room. I took acotton dressing-gown out of my case and a towel from the rack, and wentdownstairs. The morning was delicious, full of the smells of April grass. I mademy way to the stream, which was on the other side of a row of fuchsia bushes atthe edge of the lawn. A surprised rabbit hurried off into the undergrowth,without haste. The stream was shallow, but near the weir it was waist deep. Itwas so cold that I had to take my feet out after a few moments, and allow theache to subside. Then I lowered myself in, and squeezed water over my chest andback with a sponge. I stayed in until I began to feel cold, then spread thetowel on the dewy lawn, and stretched out in the sun. In ten minutes, I was dry.I knew I had to leave here before the others were awake. If I stayed, therewould be personal involvements with too many people. Every woman I had made loveto would feel that it was her right to take away a small part of my life. Myonly objection to this was that there were too many. I would have enjoyedgetting involved with every one of them; but there was only one of me.Back in the house, I woke up Angela—and told her I wanted to leave. She wasasleep in her own room, and she yawned, smiled, and opened her arms. I kissedher and shook my head.‘Not now.’ ‘You must be tired.’ She reached down, and slid her hand into mydressing-gown. ‘Good heavens.’ Her tongue went into my mouth. I tossed theclothes off the bed, and moved on top of her. She was still sleepy. It was warmand pleasant, but not explosive. I tried to withdraw for my orgasm, but sheshook her head, and held me tight. After this, I covered her up again. ‘Can Itake your car?’ ‘Of course, but you don’t have to go.’ I took her car key fromher handbag, and the front-door key of the flat. I said: ‘Apologise to Körner,and tell him he can reach me at the flat any time today. He’ll understand.’Ten minutes later I was driving towards London, suddenly intensely happy, mybrain seething with insights and ideas.What interested me most, of course, was the question of Esmond. My studies inpsychology and occultism (of which I have written a history) had convinced methat two personalities may exist in the same body. The strange case of ‘thethree faces of Eve’ is a classic of psychology that no one has tried to explain:the quiet, well-behaved housewife who would suddenly turn into a fun-lovingtart. The strangest feature of this case, reported by Thigpen and Cleckley,‡ isthat while the housewife was com­pletely ignorant of what happened when thegood-time girl took over her body, the good-time girl was conversant with allher alter-ego’s activities. And Diana told me of a case that she actuallywitnessed as a teenager. One of her uncles went moun­tain climbing inSwitzerland; one day, his sister-in-law—with whom Diana was staying—begantalking in her uncle’s voice, using his vocal inflections and tone of voice(although, of course, her voice remained feminine). This continued for threedays until her uncle’s body was found in a crevasse, then stopped.‡ The Three Faces of Eve, by Corbett H. Thigpen and Hervey M. Cleckley. London,Secker and Warburg, 1957. The ‘third face’ was the cured and integrated Eve.We have no explanation for such things, and it would not matter greatly if wehad; it would probably be the wrong one. All that interested me was that, insome sense, Esmond was not dead. This was the only outstanding and importantfact.There were other problems. What had Esmond said that pro­duced such a startlingeffect on Körner? What did Körner know about Esmond, and how did he find out?But this was only a small part of what occupied my mind as I drove back toLondon. What was really important was what I had learned last night. Esmond hadfound some way of sustain­ing the orgasm, keeping it burning for hours. Thismeant that he had taken a step beyond any human being who had so far existed.What fascinated me was the thought of the vistas of will and consciousness thathad been opened up. Already, my will felt stronger, my consciousness somehowbroader, deeper. All my life, I have obscurely felt myself in the grip of powersbeyond myself, that are somehow manipulating me by remote control. If I amtired, and my brain feels dull, I am easily discouraged, and become a badinstrument of these powers. On the other hand, if I keep faith, and drive myselfhard, and keep up a high level of optimism by sheer will and imagination, I havea sense of being used for a purpose that goes beyond my own, and seems to endowme with new powers. There is a sense of inevitability and ease, and I feelmildly surprised, like a sparrow that suddenly finds itself flying at the speedof a jet aeroplane.In Fifine at the Fair, Browning argues that man is like a swimmer, floating onhis back in a calm sea. He cannot fly like a butterfly; if he tries to raise hisshoulders too far out of the water, the rest of his body sinks. And if his headgoes under the water, he drowns. That, says Browning, is the position of theartist; only his head can emerge from life, and discover freedom in a world ofimagination; the rest of him is doomed to remain in the water, subject to thelaw of floating bodies. As an evolu­tionary existentialist, I have neveraccepted this stoical view. I am certain that these powers of imagination andecstasy developed by the romantics presage a new stage in human development. InFifine (which is about Don Juan), Browning accepts that man is inconstant, thathis sexual desires give him glimpses of some alluring reality, which vanishesand leaves him bewildered and empty-handed. What I had always suspected is thatthis need not be so. We possess powers we are hardly aware of in the dull roundof everyday life, to make the spirit rage like a tempest or sink into abreathless calm verging on ecstasy. In order to discover these, we must pushourselves to new limits. The man who sticks to everyday habit catches nostartling glimpses of self-discovery. But exploration of the physical universeoffers no possibility of new revelations. We have to master the strange trick ofallowing the body to remain quiescent, while pushing the mind to exploreinterior savannahs and mountain ranges.And quite clearly, Esmond, with the aid of sex, had taken a huge step in thatdirection. No wonder he was able to make use of my body and brain. We had bothdevoted our life to the pursuit of the same idea. Across two centuries, ourminds reached like outstretched hands, and clasped. There were many respects inwhich I had advanced further than had been possible for Esmond, for I hadexperienced another hundred and fifty years of European culture. But his willhad reached further and deeper than mine. What might not be possible for ourminds in com­bination? It was shortly after ten when I got back to the flat. I was raven­ously hungry.I found some good gammon in the refrigerator, and cooked half a dozen slices ofit with three eggs. After eating that, with toast, marmalade, apple juice andcoffee, I felt better. The feeling of well-being, of expanded awareness,continued. It struck me that the chief problem with human consciousness is thatit is focused upon the present most of the time. Only in moments ofrelaxation—holiday moments—do we achieve a state where it is at once fully awakeand yet unfocused. It is a trick; to overcome the old habit of allowingconsciousness to become relaxed when it is unfocused. Here was I, full of asense of strange potentiality, my mind completely alert, and yet not focused onanything in particular. The consequence was that almost anything I looked at orthought about filled me with excitement and elusive insights.Alastair had a rather fine edition of the poems of Chatterton on his shelf. Ihad never read the Rowley forgeries; yet as I looked at them, I had a sense ofknowledge, of familiarity. I took them off the shelf and looked at Chatterton’sdates: 1752-1770. He was four years Esmond’s junior, and apparently in Londonfor the last four months of his life—before he took a dose of arsenic. Esmondcould have met him. I sat in the chair by the window, the book open on my knee,and emptied my mind. Instantly, I was Esmond; he appeared like an old friend,behind my eyes, looking at the book. I knew the answer to my question. He hadnever met Chatterton—he had been in Göttingen when Chatterton was in London; buthe had spoken to Walpole about Chatterton the previous Christmas. Walpole hadbeen furious because the boy had sent him verses that purported to be by acertain Abbot John; Walpole had been taken in until the poet Gray declared themforgeries. He wrote to Chatterton, gently hinting that he should use his talentsto better purpose, and received in reply what he described as ‘an abusivescreed’. In telling Esmond this story, Walpole had omitted to mention that Grayhad discovered the forgery; he took the credit himself.The telephone rang; I assumed it would be Körner or Angela. But when the heavyGerman voice asked ‘Is Mr Sorme there?’, I knew I had made a mistake to answer.I said ‘Speaking’ with forced briskness.‘Ah, thank heavens. This is Annaliese Dunkelman. I have been trying to contactyou all weekend. How are you?’We exchanged polite courtesies for a moment; then she said: ‘Listen, it isimportant that I see you. Can you come over here?’‘I’m awfully sorry, but that’s impossible. I’m leaving for Ireland thisafternoon . . .’While I talked to her, I felt a curious tingling of the loins, and the thoughtof her open thighs and the genitals under rose-coloured silk suddenly came backto me with great clarity. It struck me that Esmond would understand this, but itwas too difficult to try to make my mind a blank as she talked. Suddenly, theline went dead. I assumed we had been cut off, and hung up. It struck me thismight be a good moment to ring Diana in Moycullen—so that if Anna Dunkelman rangback she’d find the line engaged. I dialled the operator, and a few minuteslater was talking to Mopsy, who told me that Mummy was in the greenhouse. A fewminutes later Diana came on the line, and told me she had been trying to get mesince yesterday; Fleisher had managed to get a film offer for his Donellymaterials, and wanted an immediate reply. The sum was very large indeed. ButFleisher proposed to take fifty per cent, which struck me as excessive. Wetalked for nearly twenty minutes; I told her I hoped to be back within a coupleof days, and to do nothing about the telegram. Then the doorbell rang. I saidgoodbye quickly, and went to glance out of the window. Anna Dunkel­man stood onthe front step.I was tempted not to answer it, but this seemed cowardly; besides, she hadprobably heard my voice on the telephone—I had opened the window. I went and lether in.She smiled at me in an exuberant, possessive manner.‘Ah, my dear Gerard, it is good to see you again.’ She seized both my hands, andpressed against me affectionately for a moment. I found myself wondering if shewas wearing the gauze panties, and felt a twinge in my loins.The astonishing thing was that she was the sort of person I would normally havefound downright repellent. She wasn’t bad-looking and her figure was good—ifhefty—but I found her basically masculine. In some odd way, this seemed toincrease her attraction by dissolving the normal male-female barrier, andsubstituting a comradely frankness. I had to admit, she had the charm andplausibility of the devil.She even had the subtlety not to refer to her attempts to con­tact me; thatwould have implied reproach. She was all warmth; we were old friends who hadcome together, and were delighted to see one another.She asked me where my friends were. I said they were out for the day. I thoughtI detected a flicker of self-congratulation. She said: ‘A pity. I wanted to meetthis young man. He sounds intelligent.’She unbuttoned her coat and I helped her off with it. She was wearing a dress ofsoft brown material, and her large breasts made it strain outwards. It was veryshort.She sat down on the settee—rather demurely, with her knees together, turnedsideways; but the shortness of her dress made it inevitable that she showed thetops of her stockings, and an area of thigh. I offered her coffee. She said:‘No thank you. I want to talk to you about many things. To begin with, if youare in Ireland, you need a literary helper, yes?’I said perhaps, very cautiously; but I must admit that I was beginning to wonderwhether Körner had not been exaggerating about the Dunkelmans. She radiatedwarmth, and a kindly vitality.‘Good. I have just the person. There is a young girl called Clara Viebig, aSwiss. When I told her I have met you, she can hardly believe it. She has allyour books, and a great scrapbook full of Press cuttings of you.’ She smiledconfidentially. ‘Of course, this is the kind of infatuation that happens toyoung girls—she has only just left college. She says she has written to youtwice but had no reply.’ (This could have been true; I reply to letters onlywhen I have no other writing to do.) ‘Now this girl has a lot of free time—herfather makes her a good allowance and she does some studies at LondonUniversity. As soon as I told her about your work on Donelly, she has offered tobe your literary correspondent in London. She wants nothing for this. She onlywants to work with you . . .’I found it all flattering. No writer ever gets so blasé that he doesn’t enjoyfemale admiration. I found myself charmed with Frau Dunkelman’sdisinterestedness; obviously, she was not the jealous type.‘Good. I told Clara we would try to go to see her some time today. She lives inNotting Hill Gate, so it is close. I have a picture of her.’ She opened herhandbag and took out a wallet. I stood up to fetch it; she also stood up, andbegan searching in the wallet. She was wearing some faint but very pleasantperfume, and the soft material of the dress moulded the curve of her breasts andhips. ‘Ah, here it is.’ She moved closer to me, and her buttock pressed lightlyagainst my loins. I experienced a tingle of desire that almost made me jump. Thepicture she was showing me was of a girl in ski-costume, standing at the top ofa ski-jump. The girl seemed to be pretty and slim, but it was hard to tell.What surprised me was the pleasure I was deriving from lean­ing against AnnaDunkelman. She was lightly pressed against me, leafing through pages of thephotograph wallet, and the warmth that came through the thin dress seemed tocommuni­cate itself directly to my penis. She seemed to have severalphoto­graphs of Clara Viebig. A close-up showed a pretty but slightly masculinegirl with high cheekbones and a great deal of dark hair. She reminded me vaguelyof Anna Dunkelman.Standing here behind her, looking over her shoulder, I was puzzled at theviolence of my desire. Our sexual responses are so complex that it is hard totell why a certain person exercises attraction; in this case, I was reluctant toplace the entire blame on my subconscious. I stared blankly at the picture ofthe girl, trying to remember something. Suddenly, Anna Dunkelman said: ‘You feelwarm.’ And without self-consciousness, she reached back and slipped her handbetween her buttock and my loins. She left it there, flat, for a moment, thenran a fingertip lightly along the length of my now throbbing penis. I did what Ihad been thinking about since she came in: reached down to the bottom of herskirt, and slipped my hand above the top of her stockings.‘That is good. We are friends. There is no reason why we should not treat oneanother with frankness. I am too old to be your lover, of course, and neither ofus want this. But there is still a vestigial male-female attraction between us.We can be frank about this.’It was the right approach. The thought of carrying Anna Dunkelman to bed wouldhave worried me. But she expected nothing. She said:‘You will find that Clara is much more your type. She is a sweet girl. We shouldgo and see her.’I thought this might be a good idea. I was beginning to experi­ence the sameunhealthy lust as in the taxi with Angela, the kind of thing an exhibitionistprobably feels: the desire to do some­thing indecent with my penis. AnnaDunkelman’s wet cleft seemed an ideal receptacle for it. On the other hand,caution told me it would be better to skip it. I said:‘Yes. Why don’t we go over there now?’‘Good. But first, I want to tell you a little about our plans . . .’ She took myhand quite naturally, and drew me to the settee. I sat down beside her. From herhandbag she took several typed sheets. ‘This is in German. Do you read German?Then I will translate.’ She was sitting in the familiar position, leaning back,her thighs apart, the dress over the tops of her stockings. Her thigh wastouching me, and I felt something like a faint trickle of electricity runningfrom it direct to my loins.And then, abruptly, Esmond was there, and everything changed. It felt as if Ihad suddenly stepped out of my body, and was looking at myself from some otherpart of the room. The fever passed away. At the same time, with no definablemental process, I understood. Anna Dunkelman had power, a curious, primevalpower that all women possess instinctively. But in most women it is buried underlayers of personality, of inhibition. Anna Dunkelman had learned to free thispower, and direct it. It would not be inaccurate to speak of it as a form ofmagic; the actual powers possessed by witches are basically of the same nature.And this, I saw in a flash, is why Witches’ Sabbaths are traditionallylicentious, with the stripping off of clothes, inter­course with goats, and soon. She throws off inhibition and learns to concentrate her natural sexualpower.Esmond understood Anna Dunkelman; he had known many of her type, and most ofthem were even more gifted. I found myself looking into Anna Dunkelman’s mind,and feeling a grue­some fascination. Unlike her husband, this one was not apervert. Perversion springs from some deep psychological block. Klaus washypnotised by the forbidden; the thought that anything was forbidden was enoughto give him an erection. Like de Sade, he wanted to be wicked, to spend his lifein a search for new and shocking things to do. Anna Dunkelman’s sexualitycomple­mented this perfectly. The maternal instinct in her had been distortedinto a kind of voracity. I saw clearly that she was bi­sexual, and that ClaraViebig was her lover. Her attitude to sex was oddly masculine: she would haveliked to be possessed by every healthy male in the world, and to possess everypretty female. And she was insatiably curious; she wanted to be ‘in’ oneverything. This, I saw, was her motive in grasping at me. I could add an air ofintellectual solvency to her ‘group’ and attract disciples. Her plan was that Ishould possess her and Clara Viebig before the day was out; then it would beClara’s task to keep a hold on me, with the airs of an infatuated disciple.I am not pretending that I could read Anna Dunkelman’s mind. All this was, in asense, speculation: but speculation based upon Esmond’s enormous experience. Itseemed obvious. And now I understood, it even seemed a little pathetic. She hadtoo much energy and not enough opportunity to use it. Why should she not graspat any possibility? It was understandable.She was unaware that she had ‘lost’ me; my insight came in a flash, while shewas still unfolding the typed sheets. She held these open in one hand; the othermoved between us, increasing the contact. And it was at this point that Esmondbegan to amuse himself. What he did was simply to draw upon my own sexualforces, and direct them against her. In fact, this was not entirely strange tome. I had always done it unconsciously, when in contact with any girl whoattracted me. If a woman wishes to attract, she may flutter her eyelids orflaunt her charms; but if she is subtle, she keeps the surface demure, and usesthe inner-telepathic charm that Anna Dunkelman was now using. The male seldomflaunts his attractions openly; from the beginning, his method is to appeardisinterested. In a sense, therefore, I had an advantage over Anna Dunkelman inthis matter. But I would not have known it without Esmond’s experience.I felt guilty about it; I didn’t really want to attract her. But I had to admitthat there was poetic justice in it. It had become a game, a duel with woodenswords.She started to translate; and then the hand holding the paper trembled. She wasresisting. She was used to being the witch, not the bewitched; she found thesensation unpleasant and bewilder­ing. I said politely: ‘Go on’, and increasedthe flow. She started to read: ‘The rules for a freely co-operative group ofstudents of Reich . . .’, then stopped. ‘We ought to find another name forthem’, I said. ‘Yes . . . we must think of a name . . .’ She regained confidenceand went on reading.I had observed that her dress was zipped at the back, and held at the top withan enormous button. Now I understood its signifi­cance. Her loins were a weaponof aggression, a fly-trap for males; but her breasts were part of herfemininity, the maternal part of her. I pointed at a sentence on the paper,saying: ‘What does that mean?’ The bone of my wrist touched the point of herbreast. She winced and drew away. I placed my hand firmly on the breast and heldit; for a moment, she lost control and tried to push it away with as littlecalculation as a frightened girl. Then she gained control again, and said in aremarkably steady voice: ‘That is a quotation from Reich . . .’ and began totrans­late it. I reached behind her, and carefully undid the large button. Sherepressed the temptation to stop me; after all, it was she who had talked about‘treating one another with frankness’. I pulled down the zip, and saw that herback was bare, except for the strap of her bra. I untied a bow at her waist, anddrew the zip down to its limit, below the top of her panties. She said: ‘You aredistracting me!’ ‘You’re distracting me.’ She tried to press back against thesettee, but she was too late; I had already unclipped the bra. She sat backhard, and for the first time her control slipped; she was suddenly unsure ofherself, tempted to fight me. Without looking at her face, I took hold of theshoul­ders of the dress, and drew it forward. It came away from her shoulders,which were white and statuesque. She would have looked excellent in ashoulderless dress in a Second Empire ball­room. Her breasts were large, andstill good. I was struck by their whiteness, and the contrasting red of thenipples. I placed a hand over each of them and felt warmth flowing into her.There was something admirable in the way she tried to regain control, and partlysucceeded. I knew what was happening to her, from the way her legs opened. Shewas experiencing the same feverish tingling I had felt earlier. She reached overand laid her hand on my trousers, then pulled down the zip of my fly. Before shecould reach inside, I said: ‘Stand up.’ She hesi­tated, then did as I ordered.The dress fell on to the floor; she stood there in the pink panties, with asuspender belt over them, and sheer stockings. I drew her close to me, and tooka nipple in my mouth. She began to tremble, and her hand strayed between herthighs and pressed tight. Then she saw that my own excite­ment was rising tomeet her, and reached her hand down. I transferred to the other nipple. Shesuddenly raised her hands to her waist and started to push her panties down. Thesuspender belt prevented this, so she had to push the belt down too. I reachedup one hand, and slid it between her thighs. Her genitals, which had obviouslybeen recently shaved, were very firm, and the faint smell of animal excitementthat came from them was pleasant. I felt her increasing tension, and herunwillingness to go any further; she wanted me to take the lead now. But as myfinger pressed into the warm cleft, she suddenly said: ‘Please!’ It came outlike an explosion.I laid her on the settee, and bared myself fully. As I moved on to her, shetried to reach down to guide me; I pushed her hand away. The panties andsuspender belt formed a tangle in the area of her loins. I brought the head ofmy penis against the material of the panties and pushed. It entered the cleftand was caressed by warmth. She made another attempt to push the gauzy materialaside, but as she did so, I pushed forward hard, at the same time pressing herbreast with one hand. Her resist­ance vanished; I felt her dissolve, gasping, asthe tide of the orgasm swept from her breasts to her loins, then back again. Atthe last moment, she sank into a solipsist universe in which there was only apleasure that came close to pain. Her eyes were closed tightly, her loinstensed, her body arched upwards. Slowly, the frenzy passed, and she relaxed. Shekept her eyes closed. I under­stood why; she did not want to look at me.The sound of the telephone startled us both. I zipped my trousers as I crossedthe room to it.A man’s voice said: ‘Mr Sorme?’‘Speaking.’‘You don’t know me. My name’s Nigel St Leger. I wonder if I could come and seeyou?’‘The Nigel St Leger?’He gave an embarrassed laugh. ‘I suppose you could say so. Could I come and talkto you about the death of Horace Glenney?’‘Well, yes, of course. When?’‘I’m quite close to you at the moment. Could I come over now?’‘Of course. Do you know the address?’‘Oh yes. Be with you in a few minutes.’When I looked around, Anna Dunkelman was already clasp­ing her bra. She saidnothing. She stood up, and I helped her to pull up her panties. I felt herresistance, but she made no attempt to prevent me. I picked up her dress andhelped her on with it. Then she said:‘I suppose you think I am very stupid?’‘No.’ I didn’t know what else to say.I could feel her getting angry. I held out her coat. She said:‘Why did you not tell me?’I said the first thing that came into my head.‘Perhaps I wasn’t allowed to.’She stared at me, suddenly interested. For a long moment her eyes stared intomine. She said:‘I think I understand.’That was more than I could say.She went towards the door.‘Well, we remain friends.’ She said it in her bluff, hearty manner. She was backin control again. She stood there, her coat open, her hand held out, her legsplanted firmly apart. But it seemed absurd. I looked at the upstanding breasts,and down to her thighs; she was a woman pretending to be a man.And then, suddenly, she blushed. I had not realised the look had been soobvious. She dropped the hand, turned without a word, and wrenched open thedoor. I made no attempt to follow her. To begin with, I was glad to see her go.Secondly, I suddenly felt sorry. Esmond’s game may have been amusing; but it hadleft her exposed and vulnerable. What could she do now? Try to cultivate herfeminine aspect? It would only lead to frustration. It struck me suddenly thatthere was one fundamental difference between Esmond and myself. He belonged tothe eighteenth century, before the age of sensibility. For him, Anna Dunkelman’sdiscomfiture was funny; and beyond that, unimportant.I went to the window as I heard the car draw up outside; I recognised Nigel StLeger before he stepped out on to the pave­ment. I had never seen him in thetelevision series that made him known to so many people; but I had a book abouthis cases, with a great many photographs. He was smaller than I had expected;but his walk had a determined forward drive that indicated something about hischaracter.I met him at the door. ‘Mr Sorme?’ He shook my hand, but the smile struck me asbleak. I led him into the flat. He was a good-looking man, powerfully built, inhis early fifties. I could imagine that his penetrating, rather cold stare hadworried a great many prisoners in the dock.I said: ‘Who told you I was here?’He looked at me sharply, as if tempted to say ‘I’m asking the questions’; thensaid: ‘Dr Körner, naturally.’He took a cigar case out of his pocket, and offered it to me; I shook my head.He came over to me as I stood by the window, and stared into my face. He said:‘I’ve never read any of your books, but I shall take care to do so now.’I said nothing. He crossed to a chess table near the window, and absent-mindedlymoved one of the chess-men.‘Do you play dominoes, Mr Sorme?’I said nothing. I was trying to make my mind a blank. St Leger stood looking atme, fixing me with his best prosecuting stare. Esmond said:‘Greetings, domino.’St Leger was startled, and showed it. He recovered by going to the settee andsitting down. He said:‘I gather you know a great deal, Mr Sorme. But you don’t belong to our house.And the Grand Master has never heard of you.’I knew I had better leave this to Esmond. There was no time to take my bearings.Esmond said:‘Then you should have, shouldn’t you?’St Leger lit his cigar.‘Apparently so. If all I hear is true.’ He tried to relax. ‘Let me make myselfclear. I am not denying your right to belong. Your qualifications are obviouslygreat. Incidentally, where do you live?’‘In Ireland.’‘Ah.’ I thought he seemed to expand. ‘Of course, there hasn’t been anything inIreland for seventy years. Perhaps we might do something there.’He stared at the tip of his cigar; I had a feeling that he wasn’t certain how tohandle this. Then he looked across at me.‘How did you find out, Mr Sorme?’Esmond offered me no lead. I decided to tell the truth.‘An American publisher asked me to write about Esmond Donelly. For the past fewmonths I’ve been trying to track down his journals and papers.’‘And you knew nothing before this?’‘No.’‘I see.’ He seemed relieved. There was a ring at the doorbell, and we bothstarted. He said: ‘Are you expecting someone?’‘No.’‘I see. Then I think I know who it is. Would you mind?’But it was Angela. She said: ‘Chris gave me a lift. He’s had a terrible row withOtto . . .’ She came into the room, and saw St Leger, who stood up politely togreet her. She obviously recog­nised him. I introduced them, and they shookhands. He displayed a great deal more cordiality towards Angela than he hadshowed so far.‘You’re a member of Dr Körner’s group? Charming! I presume it was you whointroduced Mr Sorme?’‘You know about them?’ she asked.‘Oh yes, I know about them.’ Angela looked at me, hoping for information. Isaid:‘Sir Nigel is the domino of the English house of the Sect of the Phoenix.’St Leger went pale; for a moment, I thought he was going to lose his temper.Angela said:‘Is he joking?’St Leger was obviously put out.‘He certainly has an unfortunate sense of humour.’Angela said to me: ‘Körner thinks you’re in the Sect of the Phoenix. What didyou say to him?’St Leger cut in: ‘If you’ll excuse me, I think this is a subject that should bedropped. It could be dangerous.’Angela said: ‘Dangerous?’St Leger stared at her for several seconds, then stood up and went over to thewindow. I got the impression he felt more com­fortable on his feet. He lookedout of the window, then said:‘You asked me about the assassination of Lord Glenney. It is not a subject aboutwhich I know a great deal, but I can tell you one thing. Glenney was not theintended victim. Esmond Donelly was.’As he said this, I experienced a momentary feeling of dizziness, as if somethinghad blurred in my brain. In some way I cannot explain, it was the sound of StLeger’s voice saying ‘Esmond Donelly’ that did it. I have said that during thepast week I had frequently felt as if Esmond and myself were inhabiting the samebrain. But we were like strangers, and his memory was not avail­able to me. Andnow, it was as if everything became clear, like a microscope suddenly becomingfocused; as if Esmond’s mind and mine clicked together and blended. I knew thatthis could have happened a week ago; but the final adjustment was wanting. Nowthere were no more questions; Esmond’s memory and mine had intermingled. Andnow, when Angela asked St Leger how he knew it was true, I found myself saying:‘I can tell you that.’St Leger said: ‘You can’t possibly know.’I said: ‘Glenney’s great mistake was to name names. In the original version ofLetters from a Mountain he names Abdallah Yahya as the Grand Master, andmentions that Hendrik van Griss was the domino of Holland. Esmond persuaded himto change the names in the printed version, but it still caused an upheaval inthe movement. Van Griss wanted to have Esmond assassinated; Yahya refused. In1791, van Griss poisoned Yahya. From then on, Esmond knew he might be killed anytime. He woke up one morning in Paris, and found a dagger driven into hispillow. This was one of their favourite tricks—to demoralise a man with fearbefore they killed him. It was used by the original Assassins—the Ismailis—byway of a threat. They once made Saladin raise a siege of the Assassin GrandMaster by leaving a dagger stuck in his pillow. Esmond took the warning, andwent to Russia, then to Greece. When he got back, he dis­covered that Glenneyhad committed the ultimate folly: he’d published his pamphlet denouncing theSect, and naming van Griss as the new Grand Master. That was the last straw asfar as van Griss was concerned. He had a little French assassin who’d trained inTurkey—a man called Jacques Crevea—and he sent him after Esmond. It was Creveawho killed Horace Glenney—in Esmond’s bed.’‘But what was Glenney doing in Esmond’s bed?’‘He’d told Esmond some silly story about seeing a ghost in his own room. Esmondagreed to sleep in it for a week—he didn’t believe in ghosts. Of course, Glenneydidn’t really believe he was in danger—the room was seventy feet above theground, and he kept the door locked. He didn’t know that Crevea was known as TheFly.’St Leger was looking astounded. He said:‘All this could be true, but I doubt it. No one knows the details. It became oneof the most closely guarded secrets of the Sect. There is probably only oneperson in the world at the moment who knows the details.’Angela waited for him to go on; then, when he was silent, asked:‘Who is that?’I said: ‘The present Grand Master.’She said: ‘Then it does still exist?’ She looked at St Leger. ‘And he wasn’tjoking?’St Leger turned around angrily.‘My dear young lady, my advice to you is to ask as few questions as possible. Iam extremely sorry that you returned when you did, and even more sorry that MrSorme has been so indiscreet.’I was beginning to feel angry with St Leger; the pompous manner was getting onmy nerves. I now understood a great deal about him. He had the basic requirementfor a domino of the Sect: the sexual obsession. It was present in his mannertowards Angela; she was potential bed-fodder; he was already imagining herspread underneath him, her eyes closed. He was an attractive man, sexually andpersonally. And he was a long way from being a fool. But he was an actor. Itshowed in the way he had walked across the room before his announcement aboutGlenney’s assas­sination. And I represented a serious threat to him; thisexplained why his manner towards me was so edgy. I felt disappointed that myfirst contact with the Sect should be through a man like this. I heard a cardraw up outside. St Leger said:‘And now, I think I must leave you.’I went over and stood beside him. It was a London Airport taxi. He was alreadymoving to the door. I said:‘I don’t think there’s any point in leaving. Since you were expecting him, wemay as well see him.’He said quietly: ‘Will you excuse me.’ He turned to Angela. ‘I hope we shallmeet again.’I slipped past him, and went to the door. He came after me, saying angrily:‘Really, Mr Sorme, this is . . .’A man had got out of the taxi, and was looking at the numbers of the houses. Hewas very big, and his face was brown and scarred. His eyes met mine; then he sawSt Leger behind me, and smiled. St Leger said, with sudden authority: ‘I wouldbe grateful if you would wait here a moment.’ He went past me and down thesteps. I saw no point in pushing him further, so I went back into the house.Angela was standing by the window.‘What on earth’s happening? Who’s that man?’‘I assume he’s something to do with the Sect of the Phoenix. Beyond that, Idon’t know.’From behind the curtains, I watched St Leger talking to the dark man. I said:‘He’s worried about you being here.’‘Would you like me to go out?’‘It might be the simplest solution.’The two men now came towards the house. I went out to meet them.‘The young lady is going out now, if you’d like to come in.’ The big man staredat me inscrutably. I thought he was going to ignore me. Then St Leger said:‘This is Mr Sorme. Mr Xalide Nuri.’ At this, he held out his hand, and said howdo you do. His silence, I realised, had been Eastern punctiliousness. Then Nurisaid:‘I think there is no need to trouble your friend. Mr St Leger has a car. Hecould take us to my home.’‘I’d be happy to.’ St Leger was showing his nervousness. It was not his day.I said: ‘Would you excuse me a moment?’ I went back into the house and toldAngela I was going with them. Then I asked her if she’d ever heard of a mancalled Xalide Nuri. She looked startled. ‘Of course.’ ‘Who is he?’ ‘Some sort ofmillionaire—oil, I think. His name’s always being mentioned with Onassis andPaul Getty. You must have seen it.’ I explained that the world of high financewas the least of my interests.‘Watch him. He’s the sort of person who has real power.’I went out again, closing the door behind me. A grey, chauffeur-driven Daimlerhad moved in front of the house. The chauffeur opened the door for us. As we satdown, Nuri said disapprovingly: ‘Too conspicuous.’St Leger reddened. ‘I always use it.’I saw Angela’s shape behind the lace curtain as we pulled away. She was probablywondering whether the Sect still main­tained a staff of assassins.Neither of them spoke until we were turning down Park Lane. Then St Leger said:‘It was kind of you to come so far.’ Nuri acknowledged it with a bow of hishead, as if it were a compli­ment. Then he said:‘It may, as you say, be important.’ There was no rebuke in his tone, but StLeger reddened again.My sense of Esmond’s presence had vanished. These events were too unusual not tocreate a tension in me, and tension made my own personality too dominant. Irelaxed by thinking about Anna Dunkelman. It had been a satisfyingexperience—and one of which I would have been incapable without Esmond. Hispersonality had a confidence, a forward-drive, that I found liberating.We had stopped in front of a house in Brook Street. Nuri said: ‘We are here.’Then he looked at St Leger. ‘Thank you for driving us here.’ His meaning wasclear. St Leger said: ‘It’s a pleasure . . .’, and opened the door for us. Istood there, blinking in the bright sunlight, looking at the gay summer dressesof women in Grosvenor Square, feeling that what was happening was somehowirrelevant.Before we reached the front door, it opened. I somehow expected an Easternmanservant, but it was an ordinary English butler who let us in. Without StLeger, Nuri seemed more relaxed. He said:‘I do not live here, but I keep this place for my weekends in London. It isconvenient.’It was a typical rich man’s house; comfortable, discreetly fur­nished. Only thebalustrade of the stairs suggested the East; it was of a fine, wrought ironworkthat might have come from a sultan’s harem.We went up the stairs, through a drawing room with a grand piano and Matisses onthe wall, into a library. He waved me to a deep armchair.‘Can I offer you a drink? Tea or coffee, perhaps? I drink coffee all the time.’He pressed a bell.Now I looked more closely at Nuri, I seemed to recognise him. Perhaps I had seenpictures of him. He was over six feet tall, and the face and bearing weresomehow those of a soldier. He wore a light, double-breasted grey suit. His hairwas short-cropped and going grey. The face was scarred, but handsome with thecold attraction of a bird of prey. His movements were economical, brief, as ifhe felt grace to be effeminate.He sat down opposite me and offered me a cigarette; I refused. He took out ablack and gold Russian cigarette and tapped it against the case.‘I have come from Paris to see you, Mr Sorme. Because if half of what St Legertells me is true, we have much to say to one another. Do you know who I am?’‘Yes. You’re the present Grand Master.’‘You guessed that, of course.’‘It was a fair inference. You’re not a domino, or St Leger wouldn’t have been sonervous of you.’He laughed, showing excellent white teeth.‘That man is a fool. He should not be a domino.’‘Then why is he? You have the authority to remove him.’‘Alas, no longer. Our organisation is more democratic than in the days of EsmondDonelly.’The butler came in, pushing a trolley, and left immediately. As he pouredcoffee, Nuri said:‘We must not waste time, Mr Sorme. We have much to say, and I have to be back inParis tonight. There is much about you that puzzles me. You seem to have accessto a great deal of information. That means either that someone has beenindiscreet, or that you have found documents of whose existence we wereunaware.’ I said nothing. He went on: ‘So far, you might be anyone. But now Idiscover that you are something of a prodigy. Our friend Körner tells me youhave undone two years of patient work with what sounds like an impossible feat.I presume he was not exaggerating?’ I said nothing. ‘I take your silence to meanhe was not.’ He placed the small cup of Turkish coffee in front of me. ‘Who areyou? Where do you come from? How do you know so much?’‘My name is Gerard Sorme, and I’m a writer. As to how I know so much, the answeris that I don’t.’Nuri offered me a plate of small, round biscuits with the coffee. They wereflavoured with cinnamon, and I found the taste agreeable. He said:‘That is a strange statement. I wonder if you would mind if I investigate it?’I did not understand what he meant, but I said no, of course not. He reached outand pressed a button. Neither of us spoke for the next few minutes. It was acomfortable feeling, sitting in silence; there was something in Nuri’spersonality that made it seem natural. The door opened very quietly, and a mancame into the room. I had to look carefully to decide that it was a man. Thetow-coloured hair was fluffy and long, and the face looked as if someone haddrained every drop of blood from his body, allowing the veins to collapse. Hiseyes were so pale that they seemed colourless. Although he was wearing Arabdress—a dirty yellowish robe—he was unmistakably a Westerner. Nuri paid noattention to him. He sat down on a low stool, roughly between the two of us. Isaw that his toes were long and knobbly, like something out of a horror film,and the nails were yellow, grainy and curved.Nuri said: ‘This is Boris Kahn.’ The man ignored us, staring into space. ‘Heused to make a living as a mind reader in the theatre. Then his powers developedto an extent that frightened him, and he became an addict of heroin. I found himcrawling one night in the gutter with a broken neck—he had fallen from asecond-floor window. Now he travels with me when I have important business. Heis completely mindless, but he knows when people are telling the truth.’ He tookanother cigarette out of the case, then said: ‘Did St Leger tell you I was theGrand Master?’‘No.’‘I didn’t think so. But I wanted to be sure.’I was looking at ‘Boris’ curiously. He was eyeing the cinna­mon cakes in my lapwith avidity.‘How does he indicate if someone isn’t telling the truth?’‘It would be easy enough to arrange a demonstration.’ He pointed towards thewindow, and snapped his fingers. Boris quickly hurried across to the window,bent almost double, like a frightened dog, and slipped behind a heavy velvetcurtain. Nuri pressed another button on the table. About thirty seconds later,there was a sound of feet pattering across the carpet of the room next door. Thedoor opened, and a girl ran in. She stopped at the door, glanced at me in anodd, suspicious way, then ran across to Nuri and flung her arms round his neck,making absurd chirruping noises. She was wearing long Arabic trousers and ablouse, but they were so transparent that she might as well have been naked. Iwould have judged her to be about sixteen. Her figure was well developed, herhair long and dark. She was kiss­ing Nuri repeatedly, like a small childwelcoming a favourite uncle. He smiled indulgently, and let her continue for amoment. Then he said to me:‘This is Kristy, the baby of our household.’ He sat her on his knee. ‘And how isour baby?’ His hand slipped inside the transparent trousers. She obedientlyopened her legs, and his hand slipped between them and felt her crotch. ‘Has shebeen good?’ The girl nodded her head enthusiastically, her face as vacant as adoll’s. It struck me that Nuri had a taste for mind­less people. ‘Has she hadany lovers since I was here last?’ She looked virtuous, and shook her heademphatically. From behind the curtain there came an odd noise, a kind of‘chuk-chuk-chuk’, like an animal coughing. The girl rushed over to the curtain,tore it aside, and dragged out Boris by his hair. She screamed: ‘Liar.’ He layquiescent on the floor, his cheek against the carpet, his buttocks raised in theair. When she drew back her slippered foot and kicked him in the ribs, he didnot even move. She rushed back to Nuri and flung her arms round him. ‘Baby’s nota liar. He’s a liar.’Nuri caressed her back affectionately. ‘How many?’‘None.’ The completely virtuous expression came back and she shook her head. Theodd chuk-ing noise came from Boris’s throat. She was about to leap up and rushacross to him again, but Nuri held her by the wrist, and repeated: ‘How many?’She pouted.‘Three.’The chuk-ing noise sounded again. She screamed at Boris: ‘I’ll kill you.’Nuri said indulgently: ‘Baby’s a bad little nymphomaniac, isn’t she?’‘Not,’ said the girl, looking like a Quakeress.‘Baby deserves a spanking, doesn’t she?’‘No.’ She was pleading. ‘He’s a liar.’‘How many?’She scowled across at Boris. ‘Seven.’No sound came from him. Nuri said: ‘Men, or times?’‘Men.’‘Seven smacks, then.’She stood up, pushed down the trousers to her knees, and then lay across hisknees. He took a leather slipper from under the chair, raised it, and gave theround, pink bottom a resounding smack. She yowled half-heartedly. The howlsbecame louder and more genuine as he smacked her six more times. At the seventhsmack, she leapt off his knee. He shook his head, and said:‘One more.’She bent over, and Nuri gave her one more hard smack. Then he said. ‘Now runalong.’When she had gone, Nuri said:‘Now, Mr Sorme, you say that you know nothing about the Sect of the Phoenix?’‘I didn’t say that. I know far less than you suppose.’‘I don’t see how that can be true.’ He looked across at Boris. I also looked atBoris, who was now sitting on the carpet, hugging his knees. Boris was lookingpuzzled.Nuri was looking at Boris. He said: ‘What does he mean, Boris?’Boris stared at him blankly out of his pale eyes, as if trying to avoid thequestion by pretending not to understand; but as Nuri’s hard stare remainedfixed, he said in a slow, stuttering voice:‘He . . . he . . . he . . . mm-m-means he . . . he’s . . . m-m-more than onep-p-person . . .’Nuri said: ‘Is that what you mean, Mr Sorme?’I said: ‘I’m afraid it would be pointless to try to explain. You’d doubt mysanity.’Nuri looked at Boris, and said like a whip-crack:‘What does he mean?’Boris, startled, said in his weak, throaty voice:‘He’s someone called Esmond.’Nuri’s eyes swept on to me; I could see that his face could be very menacing.‘You are not Gerard Sorme?’‘Yes.’‘Who is Esmond?’‘You know. Esmond Donelly.’He stared very hard at me, as if wondering if he had under­stood correctly.Then, to my surprise, the blood drained from his face, and the stare becamefixed. He said: ‘That is impos­sible’, but his voice was suddenly thick.And then Esmond was looking at him with my eyes, peering hard into his eyes.Nuri’s face changed. I would have liked to look into a mirror to see what hesaw. Whatever it was, it con­vinced him. It took him several seconds to controlhimself. His lips had gone white, and the red scars stood out on his grey face.He said:‘You were right, then. You learned how to come back.’Esmond only nodded. Boris was staring at Nuri in a frightened manner, like ananimal which cannot understand what is wrong with its master. Nuri stood up, andcrossed to the sideboard. He picked up a decanter, and his hand shook as hepoured into the tumbler. Then he gulped it down. Whatever it was—it was clear,like arrack—it made his eyes water, and constricted his breathing for a moment.He wiped the sweat from his face, then came and sat down, glancing up at Esmondas if hoping it had all been a mistake. He said:‘Forgive me. You cannot expect me to accept this easily.’ He leaned back in thechair and closed his eyes. Staring out through Esmond’s eyes, I found myselfpuzzled at why Nuri had been convinced so quickly. Esmond waited. It was hismoment. Nuri sat up, and gestured at Boris. ‘Get out.’ Boris hurried out of thedoor. Nuri said:‘What do you want me to do? Resign the mastership?’Esmond said patiently:‘No. I couldn’t become Master if I wanted to. Mr Sorme has other things to do.But there must be a return to the agreement of 1830.’Nuri made for the sideboard, and poured himself another drink without apology.He said:‘I don’t see how that’s possible. It would mean breaking our oath.’‘It’s the only way, believe me.’ He was being patient and reassuring. ‘Listen,Xalide, I don’t blame you. You’ve been an excellent Master. But important thingsare happening. Even this fool Körner is a portent of the future. New men aredeveloping. The human mind is reaching out for powers that I only glimpsed. Inmany respects, this Sorme knows far more than I do. You’ve got to be ready toplay an important part. You can’t do this as a secret society.’Nuri said: ‘The other dominoes would never agree.’‘They won’t have a choice. This man Sorme knows all about us. He will publisheverything that he knows. And it will be up to you to protect him.’Nuri sat down again. He was beginning to take a grip on himself, but I thoughthe looked ten years older. Esmond said kindly:‘Listen, Xalide, let me explain. When I joined the Sect, two hundred years ago,it was a society of lechers. Their basic idea was that a small élite shouldpossess complete sexual freedom. It was a good idea as far as it went, and Iaccepted it. I did what all the others did—rhapsodised about the magic, thepoetry, the mystical ecstasy of sticking the prick in a strange cunt. Ipossessed inner-power, and it developed until no woman could resist me for morethan a day or so. You know some of the things I did. I persuaded frightenedconvent girls to surrender their virginity in the course of an evening. I sleptwith three queens and eight princesses. I’ve possessed women I’d met only tenminutes before—inhibited women who thought afterwards that they’d beenbewitched. By the time I was thirty-five, I’d probably had a more complete sexlife than any man who ever lived. And then I began to outgrow it. I got tired ofbeing a mere instrument of a force I didn’t understand. When I felt like a godin the moment of supreme achievement, I asked myself the question: Is this thereal Esmond Donelly? Or am I the fashionable rake who uses his intellect andsincerity to seduce clever women? One day in Moscow, I watched a brutal cabmanbeating his horse, and before I knocked out his teeth, I felt sickened by hisgloating sadism. Later the same day, I got the youngest daughter of the Tsarinto a summer-house, and persuaded her to let me take her maidenhead. And as mypenis forced its way inside her, I had a sudden vision of the cabman’s face, andknew I was doing the same thing—deriving pleasure from imposing my will onsome­thing weaker, enjoying the sensation of power. And I realised that I’d beendoing this for twenty years, repeating the same stupid act as if to reassuremyself that I wasn’t a boring fool like the rest of the young bloods. Suddenly,I felt miserable and ashamed. My revulsion took the form of feeling sorry forthe girl, so I even contemplated the folly of asking her to elope with me. ThenI saw this would be another cul-de-sac. This is the end of most repentant rakes;they try to make themselves feel moral by treating the girl like a human beinginstead of a city under siege. In fact, it’s no more moral than dropping ashilling in the poorbox to salve your conscience. The answer was not tosubsti­tute one form of stupidity for another, but to try to understand thenature of the will-o’-the-wisp I kept pursuing through the undergrowth ofpetticoats.‘When I got back to Ireland, I saw a girl I had known many years before—a girlI’d seduced when I was fifteen. It brought back the memory of that summer in thebarn behind our house. I stood in the barn and remembered everything. And then Isaw what had gone wrong. When I first possessed Minou and Delphine, I expected afuture of infinite potentiality. I expected life to treat me like a favouritechild. And indeed, it did. But I allowed myself to become too passive. Iaccepted the pleasure, but I failed to make any real effort. The first time Ientered Minou, I felt god-like. But a hundred more seductions did nothing toredeem that promise of divinity. On the contrary, they destroyed it, for itbecame a matter of habit.’He stopped. His voice—I can hardly call it mine, for even to me it soundeddifferent—had had a soothing effect on Nuri, as he intended it to. It must alsobe remembered that Esmond was using my brain, my vocabulary, my memoryassociations, and that since these could express his thoughts more conciselythan his own natural language, the words came tumbling out at a speed that wassometimes hard to follow. The effort of concen­tration had calmed Nuri, restoredthe self-possession. Esmond said:‘Are you following my train of thought?’‘What you say is not strange to me. I have often been struck by similarthoughts, but I could see no answer.’‘The answer is closer than you think. Mr Sorme has almost found it himself. Ihad one great natural advantage—I had always thought of myself as a favouredchild. That is important—the optimism, the forward-drive. I had the audacity toask whether the god-like states did not represent the truth of my inner being.When I decided that the answer was yes, only one simple question remained: whydoes the mind sink back into a state of dullness when the orgasm is over?’‘Surely because we cannot sustain such intensity? A kettle that stays on thefire is soon empty.’‘No. That is muddled thinking. The ecstasy of the orgasm is not the result ofthe release of energy, but of the vision that accompanies it. You can have theorgasm without the vision, if your mind is tired. Or you can have the visionwithout the orgasm, if the mind becomes absorbed in poetry or music. Do you getmore tired than a blind man because you can see things that are invisible tohim? No, the contrary is true, for the blind man is more likely to be bored, andboredom leads to tiredness. The question at issue is vision, and I quickly sawthat we lose the vision because we stop trying to see it. We relax, we turn awayfrom it, like a man yawning and closing his eyes.‘I had known holy men, men who had walked over mountains and deserts seeking thesame vision, the constant awareness of the world as a mystery. Now I knew whythey were obsessed by open spaces. Man has developed the power to concentrate onsmall things, like a Swiss watchmaker. And, like the watchmaker, he has grownshort-sighted until he can no longer stare into the distance. The holy men weretrying to correct their myopia by seeking out distances. I now saw why they werewasting their time; they were trying to exchange one faculty for another, andpursuing mountains in the same muddled, repetitive way that I had been pursuingwomen.‘Do you understand me? As soon as I became fully conscious of the possibility ofa broader vision, I recognised that it depended upon the development of newfaculties and new powers of will. At first, I did the most obvious thing. As thepower of the orgasm flooded my brain, I tried to seize it, to refuse to allow itto recede. I soon found that I was developing a remarkable power ofconcentration. It is true that I could not cling on to the intensity of theorgasm. But once my mind was turned outward, like a young eagle that stares atthe sky and tries to launch itself into the air, I could concentrate on wideningmy vision. Man’s chief trouble is that he is timid. Every time he loses hissense of purpose, he stands still, and then retreats. Boredom makes him wanderin circles, and he wastes most of his life in this state. The pursuit of lovegives him a momentary contact with his hidden springs of purpose, and this hasbeen the deepest justification of our Sect. But the real need is plainly to turnthese springs into fountains that never dry up. Boredom should be impossible. Itis the emotional equivalent of losing your way in a desert. But as soon as thecompass was invented, this ceased to be a problem. I saw that my task was toconcentrate until I had developed a compass; a clear knowledge of my purpose. Isaw that boredom is the enemy of the god-like, and that all my powers had to bedirected to the overthrow of this enemy.’Nuri said: ‘And you did it. You succeeded.’‘Yes. And you will succeed too, now you have seen that it can be done. And Sormewill succeed. And when a dozen men have succeeded, the rest of the human racewill follow. The springs of purpose are not buried very deeply. Even that littlegirl who was in here has the power, if she knew how to direct it. It is a mentaltrick, like jumping on to a galloping horse.’The image I put into Esmond’s mind was of a man using a wave to carry hissurf-board, but he failed to understand it. Esmond lacked the concepts forexplaining himself fully, the notion of the ‘promotion’ from one level of thebeing to another, the recognition that the human personality is a series ofplatforms. But I had them.Nuri said: ‘May I ask some questions? Where are you now? Is there literallyanother world beyond this one?’Esmond laughed.‘What you call “this world” is what you can see through a crack in a door. It islike calling this room we are sitting in a world. Mr Sorme can explain this toyou better than I can. He talks about life-worlds. As to where I am now, Icannot explain this easily. As I developed the power of my will, I began tounderstand things that ought to be self-evident. When you are tired, the spiritis held close in the embrace of the body. The more you become healthy and alive,the more you have a sense of controlling your body from a distance, as thefalconer controls his bird. And at a certain point in the mental cycle, itbecomes possible to achieve a degree of control over this body that you cannoteven envisage. When this happens, all kinds of strange things can be done—forexample, I can project what you call my astral body to great distances.’‘And this is what happened when you appeared at the Berlin meeting of 1830?’‘Quite. But do not overestimate the importance of this power; it is a mereby-product. What matters is the new degree of control over the body. For oncethis is established, it is almost impossible to die.’Nuri said: ‘But you died.’‘As you see.’‘But your body died in 1832. You were buried in the family vault in Ireland.’Esmond said nothing; his memory was closed even from me. Then he said:‘Let us not waste time on irrelevancies. Let us say only that Mr Sorme has beenan invaluable instrument, and that you should treat him with the same confidencethat you would treat me. In return, he will be able to help you a great deal.Like myself, Mr Sorme is not basically interested in sex. He is some­thing of apuritan. But I think he has seen some interesting possibilities in Körner’sgroup. You can show him far more interesting things. I am relying on you.’‘What about you? Will you go away now?’‘No. But I really cannot keep imposing on Mr Sorme. He has his own work to do.’I said aloud—for Nuri’s benefit: ‘You’re welcome to drop in whenever you wantto.’‘Thank you. You are most hospitable.’Nuri said: ‘What do you want me to do immediately?’‘Nothing. Concentrate on the trick of leaping on the galloping horse. Andremember one thing. Pessimism is a leaden weight around the feet. Defeat isalways self-chosen. Mr Sorme can explain these things better than I can—he hashis own system of philosophy based upon a man called Husserl. And now, my dearXalide, I shall leave you. I would be grateful if you would also extend yourprotection to the present Lord Glenney, thegreat-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson of my friend Horace. Hecontains a large number of Horace’s elements, so in a sense you might regard himas a reincarnation. Say nothing of what has taken place to that fool St Leger.He is not to be trusted.’Then he was gone, and Nuri and I were alone. Nuri was not sure of this until Isaid: ‘He’s gone.’He stood up. “Well, Mr Sorme, I think we deserve a drink. Whisky?’‘A small one, thanks.’As he poured, I said: ‘How did you know that Esmond intended to come back?’‘There is a tradition, Mr Sorme, that he never died, and that the body buried inhis family vault was that of an old mendicant. He also said as much in hisdiaries, which are now at my house on the island of Hendorabi. You and yourfamily would be wel­come guests there if you would like to examine them. Theycease after the year 1800, which has always puzzled me. Now I under­stand.’‘There’s one thing I’d like to ask him. Did he give up sex after this insight ofhis?’‘I think I can answer that. You are aware that he chose the youngest of theIngestre sisters as a sort of divinity, and she later became a priestess at theheadquarters of the Sect in Constan­tinople? You can read about this in thediaries. I believe he chose her because he said she had some secret quality ofgrace that made her more purely feminine than any woman he had ever known. TheSect treated her as a kind of divinity after Esmond became Master in 1810. Afterthat, her daughter and then her granddaughter took her place. It is generallyassumed that Esmond was the father of her daughter.’‘Who wrote the books attributed to Esmond—The Deflowering of Maids and so on?’‘That was written by Glenney himself, at a time when he wanted to discreditEsmond with the Sect. But there were many later forgeries. As Grand Master,Esmond was likely to have works attributed to him as minor Elizabethans foistedtheir plays on Shakespeare.’‘What did Esmond die of?’He said: ‘That is something that puzzles me. The story told by his biographer,Ismat al-Istakri, is that he suffered a brain haemorrhage after a ceremony inwhich he penetrated fifteen young women. This, of course, is possible; as GrandMaster, it was sometimes his task to take part in such ceremonies. Yet I havenever been able to accept this story completely. Now I am less sure than ever.’‘Is this biography in English?’‘Unfortunately, it is in Arabic. But I can have it translated for you.’Glancing at my watch, I was surprised to see that it was after six. It struck methat Angela would be worrying about me. So I asked if I might make a phone call.I was right; Angela and Alastair were just debating whether they ought to callup the police. St Leger’s dark hints about Glenney’s murder had them worried.While I was still on the phone, the discreet butler sidled up to me. ‘Excuse me,sir, but Mr Nuri suggested that you might like to ask your friends to come herefor supper.’ I passed the suggestion on to them, and they accepted immediately.When I got back to the library, Nuri was wearing a beautifully brocadeddressing-gown, and four girls in transparent clothes were standing behind hischair. He said:‘Ah, Mr Sorme, I hope your friends have accepted my invita­tion? We have anotherhour to dinner. Have you ever tried the relaxing properties of an Imrali bath?It was invented by a Turkish Grand Master of the seventeenth century. Theseyoung ladies have learned the art to perfection. I suggest we have one now,before dinner, and perhaps you could explain how you came to hear about EsmondDonelly?’ It was the prelude to one of the most interesting evenings I have ever spent;but this is no place to describe it in detail. The history of the Sect of thePhoenix is a subject of such complexity and richness that it would be unfair tospeak of it here. When the editing of the Donelly papers is complete, I shallhope to under­take the writing of it myself. Nuri also told us something of hisown history, and ended by demonstrating some of those remark­able powers thatled to his appointment as Grand Master. (This had occurred after a spectacularstruggle with Ludwig Bindig, the German domino who was also an ex-Nazi. Bindigran the famous ‘sex camp’, whose existence has been denied by recent Germanhistorians.)We retired to bed, utterly exhausted, in the early hours of the morning. When wewoke up, Nuri had left for Paris. Later the same day I flew back to Shannon,where Diana met me. When we returned home, we found a telegram from Nuri, askingif we could join him at his home on Hendorabi the following weekend. His privateplane collected us at Shannon. In the four months since that date, we havebasked in the sun, and I have written this account of my quest for Esmond.My researches into Xalide Nuri’s archives—aided by his excellent librarian, DrFa’iq Khassa—have answered most of the remaining questions about Esmond, andabout the history of the Sect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenthcenturies. These results will be published in due course. Angela—who is alsoworking here—has already accumulated the basic materials for a biography ofEsmond, on which we shall probably colla­borate.The chief problem that faced me in writing about my ‘quest’ was how far I couldbe frank about certain episodes. I have accepted Howard Fleisher’s suggestionthat I write everything as it occurred, and leave it to him to decide how muchaltera­tion is necessary.§ I must also confess that I have not, so far, allowedDiana to read the manuscript; luckily, she is an under­standing girl, and I canlay most of the blame on Esmond.§ When this book was in the proof stage, I heard that the remains of ColonelDonelly had been found in his burnt-out farmhouse; foul play is not suspected. Ihave accordingly restored the passage on Colonel Donelly to the form in which Iwrote it.And what of Esmond? Since that afternoon in Brook Street, I have occasionallysensed his presence; but I cannot be certain that this is not my imagination. Ioften find myself thinking about a curious incident that took place late thatnight in Nuri’s home. Boris had been demonstrating his powers of second sightfor the benefit of Angela and Alastair. Nuri had put him into a hypnotic trance;and his answers to questions about our private lives were frighteninglyaccurate. Before he woke him, Nuri asked us if we had any questions we wouldlike to put to the sleeper. Angela said:‘Yes. Can he tell us where Esmond is at the moment?’Boris’s sightless face turned to me.‘He is Esmond.’ Note to The God of the Labyrinth Some time in 1968, the Daily Telegraph published a leading article deploring theincreasing amount of pornography that is being printed, and citing myself andMiss Brigid Brophy as two ‘serious’ writers who aim at larger sales by spicingtheir books with episodes that would have led to prosecution in less liberaltimes. I took no exception to this article, for it is true that I have writtenabout sex in some of my books in a way that would not have been legallypermissible fifty years ago. I do not think of myself as a writer ofpornography; but if someone else wishes to do so, it is surely a matter of thepoint of view? A few weeks later, the Telegraph article was syndicated in a NewZealand newspaper, and a reader wrote a letter indignantly defending me; hepointed out that more than half my books are about such subjects as philosophy,art, music and literature, and that of my seven novels, four have little or nosex. When I read this letter I was convinced; I was not a porno­grapher. It istrue that a New England bookseller had to appear in court for displaying The SexDiary of Gerard Sorme, but nothing came of this. The judge’s opinion was thatalthough I was totally devoid of literary talent, the book was not technicallyobscene.A few weeks after the Telegraph article, I was asked by a firm of solicitors ifI would appear in court to give evidence in favour of a Bradford bookseller whowas being prosecuted for selling My Secret Life, the sexual autobiography of ananonymous Vic­torian. I replied that I was too busy to travel to Yorkshire—atwo-day journey from Cornwall—but that they were welcome to quote my opinionthat the book was not pornography, and ought to be published openly in England.I offered to write a letter to this effect. And when I began thinking it out, Isaw the difficulty of the task facing the defence. My Secret Life has noliterary merit. When Grove Press published it in America, they argued that itwas a valuable social document of the Victorian era; but this is not trueeither. A sociologist could learn more from ten pages of Charles Booth or HenryMayhew than from the three thousand pages of My Secret Life. Its author was themale ver­sion of a nymphomaniac. Sex was a vocation. He tried every possiblekind of sexual experience over forty years or so, and then decided that it hadall been so fascinating that he ought to write about it. Who can deny that hewas right? It is true that not everybody would want to read it; but then, notevery­body wants to read autobiographies of soldiers, politicians andtravellers; that is no argument against them.One cannot even say that My Secret Life was written ‘with­out obscene intent’,or whatever the phrase is. He had enjoyed the sex, and he enjoyed writing aboutit. The man is a dirty-minded bore; to write at such length about sex arguescomplete empty-headedness. All the same, the book is real; it is a man’s life;it is ‘fact’, just as the massive volumes of White Papers the Webbs studied fortheir history of trade unionism were ‘fact’. Now I agree that there is a caseagainst the publication of certain kinds of unpleasant fact—for example, thedetails of sexual assault that emerge at murder trials; these could lead toimitative crimes. But anyone who imitates the author of My Secret Life will dono particular harm, or come to any; so this does not apply. I can think of novalid ground for suppressing the book—and certainly not for sentencing peoplewho sell it to two years in gaol—as happened to the Bradford bookseller.But the ‘fact’ argument can hardly be applied to de Sade and Fanny Hill (whosepublication I would also defend), particularly if they are kept fairlyexpensive, so that the cost acts as a ‘filter’ where minors are concerned. I donot like de Sade; I do not think him ‘significant’ in the way that Jean Paulhanand Mlle de Beauvoir apparently do. The basic spirit of his books is one ofschoolboy revolt—like writing dirty words on walls. But I would not be in favourof suppressing his books. As to Fanny Hill, Cleland admits he wrote it formoney; it is a prime example of what Sainte-Beuve called ‘books that one readswith one hand’. It is amusing, well written, and there is nothing in it thatevery adult reader does not already know. It must be borne in mind that to suppress a book—to declare that it is unfit forpublic consumption—is the literary equivalent of executing a criminal, orburning a witch, or having a political opponent thrown in gaol. It is difficultto defend it impartially—with detachment. Like the Index of the Catholic Churchor the Nazi burning of the books, it can only be defended on sec­tarian grounds:from the basis of accepted dogmas. We can argue against the open sale of drugs,or of intoxicating liquor to minors, on pragmatic grounds: it can cause physicaldamage. We know about the limits of the body; we know nothing about those of themind. This kind of argument cannot be transferred to books.I agree that all this sounds like special pleading—like a cunning lawyer whoknows he has an indefensible case, and decides to try to blur the lines andconfuse the issues. I get this feeling reading a great many liberal opponents ofcensorship. But when I look inside myself, I find I have a very definiteintuition of what constitutes pornography and what doesn’t. Let me try toexplain the nature of this intuition.I might take as a starting point a paragraph from my auto­biography, Voyage to aBeginning: The hero [of Ritual in the Dark] is obsessed by the feeling that there ismeaning in human existence, and that it is accessible to the mind—if only themind knew the right way to go about finding it. One of the commonest ‘meaningexperiences’ comes through sex, and therefore sex makes a valuable startingpoint for the search for meaning. (I italicize ‘starting point’ because it seemsto me that nothing can be more futile than sex carried on as a kind ofvocation—as by Casanova or Frank Harris.) Sex can be the starting point of the ‘search for meaning’, the denial ofSartre’s assertion that ‘it is meaningless that we live and meaningless that wedie’. This argument obviously applies to D. H. Lawrence, as well as to thosebooks of mine that the Telegraph had in mind. De Sade is defensible because healso saw sex as somehow containing the meaning of human existence. It is truethat there are basic errors in his thinking—the failure to reckon with the ‘lawof diminishing returns’—that invalidate his work in the last analysis; it is acurious monument of error, like the geocentric theory of the universe or thephlogiston theory of combustion, and it remains a useful symbol of aninteresting fallacy. It also makes an excellent starting point for existentialphilosophy. Dostoevsky’s Kirilov argues that if there is no God, then man isgod, and must prove it, and he carries this logic to the point of suicide. DeSade carries it into an ultimate defence of amorality. In either case, one canbegin to argue fruitfully.I get a feeling of real pornography when I read certain books that no one hasever thought of suppressing—books like No Orchids for Miss Blandish, or TheCarpetbaggers, or even some of the James Bond novels. Forster accused Joyce oftrying to cover the universe with mud; he was mistaken; the dirt and violence ofUlysses is intended to act in reverse, as an emetic. Joyce himself recognisedhis kinship with Swift. James Hadley Chase and Harold Robbins are out toplease—and to make money by pleasing. The sex and violence—particularly theviolence—are intended to make the meal more palatable. They are likebrothel-keepers in that they are willing to cater for anyone who is willing topay. And if one drags their premises into the light of day, one finds anotherversion of the de Sade argument: that what gives pleasure is, by definition,good. But de Sade, like Voltaire or some modern logical positivist, was arguingagainst ‘metaphysical’ notions of goodness. He says, in effect: ‘People say thatvirtue, self-denial, self-sacrifice, public spirit, honour and bravery are good.I say this is just confused thinking. To the level-headed realist, only pleasureis good.’ What he then pro­ceeds to do is to refute himself by trying todemonstrate his thesis at exhaustive length. The only thing that surprises us isthat he himself was not bored sick long before the end of Juliette. But at leasthe was clearly aware of the values he was trying to erode.Now no one criticises Conan Doyle or Rider Haggard for not being as intelligentas Thomas Mann or Aldous Huxley. They set up as entertainers, and the ‘values’they advocate—honour, bravery and so on—are in no way controversial. Since theirtime, the popular entertainer has become more realistic, more sophisti­cated.Unfortunately, not more intelligent. He rejects the older values—but not in thename of a questing intellect; only in the name of entertainment, of ‘givingpeople what they want’. But the rejection of values—if it is to be a usefulactivity—must be fully conscious of its own nature. When we come across peoplewho hold opinions they are not willing to think about, we rightly call themfools or bigots. And the objection to this kind of stupidity or bigotry is thatit is somehow life-denying. I have a digestive and an excretory system to dealwith the food I need to keep me alive. I have a mental digestive and excretorysystem to deal with my experience, and my growth as a human being depends uponthis as my bodily growth depends on the physical system. If either system getsblocked, I shall be slowly poisoned. Ian Fleming and Harold Robbins do notpossess a digestive and excretory system to deal with the values they reject.The result is a smell of decay, of a system blocked with its own wastepro­ducts. If one reads them for too long, the result is that feeling ofheadache, of dyspepsia, of futility, that is the outcome of severe constipation.This law also applies, of course, to much greater works of literature. One getsthe same feeling of futility if one reads too much of Rolland’s Jean-Christophe,or Powys’s Wolf Solent, or even War and Peace. These books possess a digestivesystem, but it is not big enough to deal with so much ‘experience’. It is worthobserving that a digestive system is not simply a capacity for abstract thought.Huxley or Mann are intelligent enough; yet their books are curiously static.What is important is a writer’s capacity to attack his experience; not simply to‘suffer’ it, but to get beyond it. Dostoevsky is never boring, in spite of hisclumsy style and meandering length, because of this feeling of smouldering firestrying to consume his material, as a furnace smelts ore.This defines my intuition of the nature of pornography. It is bound up with thequestion of the digestive system. We do not give rice to ducks, or suet puddingto small babies, because we know their digestive systems cannot cope; if I didso, knowing the result, I would be guilty of criminal negligence. The sameapplies to a writer who produces a sticky, undercooked mixture of sex andviolence, aimed at the ‘lowest common denominator’ of reader.This also explains why I would not consider My Secret Life, Fanny Hill or deSade truly pornographic. The test is whether it contains this element of poison,of life-denial. My Secret Life becomes very dull and repetitious after the firstfew hundred pages, but it is no more ‘poisonous’ than Hansard or theCon­gressional Record. The narrator is coarse and stupid, but he is not cruel ormean. One might object to his basic values: to his feeling that sex is the mostimportant human experience. But one can take it or leave it. There is nothing toprevent the reader putting a Beethoven quartet on the gramophone after reading adozen pages or so. The same is true of Fanny Hill. As to de Sade, reading himprovokes a reaction that would actually enhance the Beethoven quartet. Thetrouble with Hadley Chase or Harold Robbins is that after reading a few pages,one would no longer be capable of enjoying Beethoven. He would seem to beirrele­vant to this vicious, dangerous, violent world in which we live, a‘beautiful ineffectual angel’ living in his absurd musical dream­world.In short, pornography involves a sense of the debasement of values. If art is abattle between man’s mind and the material world, then the pornographer is onthe side of the world. It is interesting to note that Fleming, Harold Robbinsand Hadley Chase all exploit crime as well as sex, and often seem to equate thetwo as a kind of destructive activity. Shaw pointed out that we judge the artistby his highest moments, the criminal by his lowest. This means that art may beseen as an advocate of man’s highest moments as against his lowest. The writerwho exploits crime and violence purely to titillate the reader has become anadvocate of the lowest. But if he goes on to treat sex in such a way as tobracket it with crime as one of man’s lowest moments, the offence is compounded. But now to the next stage of the argument. It will be noted that Thomas Mann andAldous Huxley are also concerned about the battle between the material world andthe mind, and that both of them tend to be defeatists. I personally find Huxleyalmost as depressing as Graham Greene because the material world always seems towin by a short head. He talks about life-affirmation, but somehow, none of itever seems to get through in his books. His ‘affirmative’ people are alwaysunpleasant and stupid; his sensi­tive people are always weak. The same is trueof Thomas Mann, but his ‘objectivity’ makes it less oppressive.Life-denial, then, while it is an essential element of porno­graphy, is notrestricted to pornography. This raises the question of how far the converse istrue. Is pornography possible if the spirit of life-denial is not present?This is a more important question than it sounds. This ques­tion of morality andimmorality, health and decadence, has been concerning us for nearly a century,ever since the great Zola and Ibsen controversies of the 1880s. The arguments onboth sides have always been roughly the same. As early as 1782, Thomas Jeffersonwrote: ‘Those who labour in the earth are the chosen people of God. . . .Corruption of morals in the mass of cultivators is a phenomenon of which no agenor nation has furnished an example.’ These simple, primitive societies are likea healthy body; the rejection of ‘corruption’ is an automatic function of thehealth. When the ‘dubious’, the unhealthy, the corrupt, begin to find afoothold, it means, ipso facto, that decadence has set in. If my physical bodybecame more susceptible to germs, I would take steps to cure it, to reject thegerms; I would certainly not accept them as an interesting variation of theboring routine of being healthy. This is the line Max Nordau pursued in hisDegeneration (1893); decadence should be recognised for what it is, nottolerated and encouraged. Shaw’s counterblast, The Sanity of Art, wassub-titled: ‘An exposure of the current non­sense about artists beingdegenerate’, and its argument could be summarised in the words: ‘Notdegeneration, but develop­ment.’ Thomas Mann, who was writing his first storiesat this time, took a less positive position (which he maintained all his life):that as art becomes more sensitive and subtle, it develops and degenerates;evolution means degeneration, beyond a certain point. Spengler said the samething in The Decline of the West.Shaw disagreed fundamentally. He would have said: ‘Of course, evolution can meandegeneration, if sensitivity outruns vitality. But it does not necessarilyfollow.’ And this is obviously another form of the question we have alreadyraised. Mann and Huxley were writers in whom sensitivity outran vitality. Onemight have thought that if sensitivity outruns vitality, it ought—in theory—tobe possible to increase the vitality to match it. Neither of them believed thispossible. But is this true? Let us suppose I have a crude and oversimplifiedview of something. The result is a head-on collision with reality which leavesme wiser—more sensitive—but, for the moment, less confident and assertive. MustI remain like this for the rest of my life? Obviously not. I make a mentaleffort, I digest the experience, contemplate it until I have absorbed all itsimplications: that is, until I have mastered it. Then the confidence returns;the vital springs flow again. That is to say, it depends upon the same‘digestive’ act that I have already discussed in connection with pornography.This view presents an alternative to the Jeffersonian position: that simplicityand health and stability all go together. If you upset the stability, you willupset the simplicity and health; but with a certain effort and a certainoptimism, they can be re­established on a higher level, and the result will be agenuine evolution. The alternatives are not a stick-in-the-mud conserva­tism orgalloping decadence.All of which, then, would seem to argue not only that porno­graphy cannot existunless life-denial is present, but that what would be pornographic in thepresence of life-denial would cease to be so in the presence oflife-affirmation. The conclusion may sound abstract; but for me, it was of imme­diate practicalinterest. When I started writing my first novel, in my late teens, I wasobsessed by the problem that led Joyce to choose the Odyssey to provide thestructure for his own chaotic novel of modern Dublin. The problem was expressedby Yeats in the three lines: Shakespearian fish swam the sea, far away from land;Romantic fish swam in nets coming to the hand;But what are all those fish that lie gasping on the strand? That is to say, Shakespearian art held a mirror up to Nature: or perhaps oneshould say, a magnifying glass. Its basic unit was the event, the story.Character is important, but only within the story; after all, it would notreally matter if it was Hamlet who got jealous and murdered his wife, or Learwho became Thane of Cawdor. In romantic art, character became the story.Goethe’s Werther, Senancour’s Obermann, Hölderlin’s Hyperion, are notinterchangeable because they are the story. The magnifying glass moved closer,so that the basic unit ceased to be the event, and became the character.A story will tell itself if you let it. But a character has to be lived by theauthor. Goethe had to become Werther and Wilhelm Meister in a way thatShakespeare never had to identify with Hamlet or Lear. But still, if thenovelist got ‘into’ the charac­ter, the events then developed naturally; Wilhelmbecomes the manager of a theatrical troupe, and Faust becomes a publicbenefactor.That is, provided the character was clear-cut. But the essence of romanticismwas its self-division, its sense of a lack of definite identity. And slowly,Werther gives way to Stephen Dedalus, Rilke’s Malte Laurids Brigge, Sartre’sRoquentin, Camus’s Meursault—the last being the completely static hero—Kafka’sK. The fish no longer has strength to swim, or even thrash around; in Beckett,it only gasps and flutters its tail. There is a gain in detail—the magnifyingglass is now within an inch of the fish’s nose—but no story is possible. Andwithout a story, how can the novel be possible?Joyce’s solution was not generally applicable; in fact, as far as I know, he isthe only person ever to attempt the ‘mytho­logical method’. The novel hasstopped trying to solve the prob­lem; it has regressed to an earlier stage, andcome to terms with its loss of status.The drama passed through a similar crisis in the twentieth century. It alsodrifted into subjectivism, symbolism, expression­ism, even a kind of deliberatenightmare in Artaud’s theatre of cruelty. It was Brecht who attempted tore-establish contact with the beginnings, with the source of the stream. Dramabegan as spectacle, as a story told to an audience who knew it was not reality.So why try to compete with the cinema? Why not make the best of the limitation;in fact, affirm the gap between the audience and the players? Yeats had beentoying with the same idea—the theatre of ritual—but Brecht had the genius tocom­bine the theatre of ritual with the lecture platform, the music hall and thesoapbox.I had written several novels before it struck me that what I was doing was tobring the Brechtian alienation effect to the novel. My first novel, Ritual inthe Dark, began with a mytho­logical structure based on the Egyptian Book of theDead, until it struck me that if I intended to use a ‘framework’ that did notspring naturally from the inner-meanings of the story, I might as well choose aframework that could be accepted by ordinary readers. I chose the story of theRipper murders and the struc­ture of the psychological thriller. But it wasstill basically a realistic novel in the Dostoevsky tradition. In later novels,I aimed at the ‘alienation effect’ more consciously by choosing conventionalforms, and aiming at an effect approximating to parody. In Adrift in Soho, itwas the picaresque novel; in Necessary Doubt, the roman policier; in The Worldof Violence, the German bildungsroman with comic overtones; in The MindParasites and The Philosopher’s Stone, science fiction; in The Black Room,¶ thespy novel; in The Glass Cage, the detective novel again.¶ Still unpublished at the time of writing.Now the letter that defended me against the charge of writing pornography raiseda question in my mind. Could one use the form of the conventional pornographicnovel, à la Cleland or Apollinaire, as the basic framework of a novel, andachieve this same alienation effect? I had tried something similar in ManWithout a Shadow (whose title was later changed—without consulting me—to The SexDiary of Gerard Sorme) and I had observed then that writing about sex tends todestroy the aliena­tion effect because the reader becomes involved. But the SexDiary did not use the form of the pornographic novel, but of the confessionaljournal; it was a novel of ideas taking sex only as its starting point. It is aninteresting challenge, for the porno­graphic novel is more rigidly formalisedthan any other type I can call to mind; it has something of the symbolicrigidity of a ballet. So much the better for the alienation effect. Thechallenge is, of course, to endow this structure with life. The trouble with theconventional pornographic novel—Justine may be taken as an example—is that oneis aware that it is a series of ‘set pieces’ connected by an arbitrary thread ofnarrative, like a Monteverdi opera. I am far more interested in the story andthe ideas than in the set pieces. I must also admit that, formally speaking,this book does not obey the rules of the pornographic novel so much as those ofthe detective story—particularly the literary detective story of the sortpopularised in Russia by Irakly Andronnikov. The ‘sect of the phoenix’ isdeveloped from a hint by Jorge Luis Borges. In fact, if The Mind Parasites andThe Philosopher’s Stone borrowed the mythology of H. P. Lovecraft, the presentbook may be said to be based on the mythologising of Borges.The success or failure of this novel as an exercise in the aliena­tion approachshould not be taken as a measure of the value of the approach. I am convincedthat the answer to the problem of the ‘Shakespearian fish’ and the stranded fishlies in applying the alienation effect to the novel, whether or not it works inthis particular case. But I would argue that if it can work in this case, it canwork anywhere. There is a final point, which I raise with some hesitation, since it seemsobvious. As we grow from childhood into adulthood, we enter new ranges ofexperience that would have been impractical or undesirable for a child, fromdrinking alcohol and smoking to climbing mountains and listening to stringquartets. Sex stands out from all the other experiences as being one that mustbe treated as a kind of secret, as if it were some strange tribal initia­tioninvolving a name that may not be spoken. Now this may be essential for certainprimitive tribes, or patriarchal societies; but how far is it desirable for acivilisation like ours whose basic aim (whatever gloomy historians say) is‘sweetness and light’? The evolution of Western civilisation has been anevolution of reason; the rejection of the dogmatic and authoritarian element inreli­gion, and also (hopefully) in politics. This evolution did not come to ahalt when England rejected the pope, or Voltaire rejected Christianity; evenNewman and the Oxford apostles must be seen as a development of the same trend,an insistence on the claims of a deeper, subtler reason related to man’smetaphysical needs. Freud had to fight the same battle; to overrule socialtaboos and reticences with the demand for frankness and open-mindedness; so didD. H. Lawrence. The extermination camps of the Nazis may be seen as an attemptto return to a more primitive—and uncomplicated—form of society, in whichprob­lems are solved by force and dogma, not by reason.It seems to me that this development presupposes an import­ant humanisticpremise: that ‘forbidden-ness’ is bad in itself, although it may sometimesoperate for the good on a limited scale. For example, sex murders are notcommitted by people who think and talk about sex without inhibition, but bypeople in whom frustration has built it up into something forbidden and darklyalluring. ‘Forbidden-ness’ should not be confused with discipline, which isbasically a liberating factor. A good army is like a well-oiled machine; itsdiscipline is the factor that allows it to run without friction.If all this is true—and I find it hard to conceive any reason­able persondenying it—then it follows that mature adults should be able to think of sexualexperience as they think of any other form of experience—in art, science, sport,adventure. When I read Rider Haggard as a child, I experienced both detachmentand involvement. The detachment came from sitting in an arm­chair reading abook, the excitement from marching through snake-infested jungles with AllanQuatermain. This is the essen­tial quality of civilised experience—detachmentand involvement. But where sex is concerned, this notion is still not accepted.We are supposed to be either directly involved—in bed with a partner—or totallydetached, as when I read a case in Havelock Ellis and murmur ‘How interesting’.There seems to be an element of absurdity about this. Most adult readers havehad the basic experience that is described by Cleland or D. H. Lawrence; and,unlike cruelty or crime, this experience is not regarded as sociallyundesirable. Is there really such a gulf between the subject of sex and subjectslike history, adventure, sport? Is there any reason why civilised adults shouldnot, if they are so minded, read about sex with feelings of detachment, orhumour, or even a certain involvement? If we can say that a thing is ‘shocking’,without meaning that it is ugly or wicked, then it seems to me an excellent ideato use it to shock as many people as possible, until it has lost itsshock-effect, and can be seen calmly and without distortion. In a reallycivilised society—and we are still some distance from it—there will be noforbidden books, or forbidden ideas. ALSO AVAILABLE FROM VALANCOURT BOOKS Michael ArlenHell! said the DuchessR. C.
