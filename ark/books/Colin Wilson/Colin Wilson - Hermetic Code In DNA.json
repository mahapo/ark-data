Since I was overworked, trying tocomplete a book to a deadline, it took some time before I got around to readingit. My book was about ancient Egypt and was called From Atlantis to the Sphinx;its starting point was the theory of John Anthony West that the Sphinx may bethousands of years older than anyone had supposed. And the amount of readingrequired was enormous.One evening I was relaxing with a glass of wine when I noticed The InfiniteHarmony in a pile of books beside my chair. I picked it up idly, glanced downthe table of contents, and saw that the second chapter is devoted to ancientEgypt. Naturally, I turned to it immediately, and was soon reading withexcitement and absorption. I quickly learned something I had not come acrossbefore: that in the antechamber to the King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid,there is a square granite relief whose area is exactly equal to the area of acircle whose diameter happens to be precisely the same length as the antechamberfloor. What is more, when this length is multiplied by pi, the result isprecisely the length of the solar year: 365.2412 pyramid inches.I was fascinated. It had long been clear to me that the ancients attached somemystical significance to numbers and that the sophistication of their knowledgewas often greater than ours. Hayes reinforced my feeling that we are dealingwith a very ancient knowledge system whose secret has been lost.I was so excited that I looked around to see if I could locate the letter thathad accompanied the book. It had vanished. The inscription in the book showedthat it had been lying around my sitting room for months. And my wife had made anote of the sender’s address, which was in Moseley, Birmingham. I rang DirectoryEnquiries and asked them if they had a telephone number for Michael Hayes; theyhad. And although it was now after ten in the evening, I rang him. A girlanswered the phone, and went off to get her father. A few moments later, I wasspeaking to Michael Hayes, apologizing for keeping him waiting so long for areply, and telling him that I found his book enormously exciting.I asked him some questions about himself, and about how he had become interestedin the subject. He told me that it had started in his hippie days, when he wasliving in Mashad, in Iran, and was in the great mosque of the Imam Reza,impressed by the sheer number of worshippers, and by their devoutness. It wasobvious that to them, religion was a living reality, just as it had been to thethousands of worshippers who had brought stones for the building of Chartrescathedral in the twelfth century. And during his travels in Iran, India,Pakistan, and Afghanistan, Michael Hayes had felt exactly the same thing—thattheir religions had a living source. He experienced an overpowering sense ofbeing on the brink of learning some enormous secret.Back in England, he had decided that it was time he learned something about thegenetic code, and the mysterious letters DNA. He enrolled at a course atLeicester University. And there he took an important step closer to the secret.It proved to be numerical.The spiral-shaped DNA molecule involves four chemical bases called adenine,guanine, cytosine, and thymine. And these four can combine together insixty-four different ways to form triplet units called RNA codons.The number 64 struck a chord. Then he remembered what it was: that the Chinese“Book of Changes,” the I Ching, has sixty-four “hexagrams,” each made up of twodifferent lines. Any reader who has ever tried throwing down three coins toconsult the I Ching will recall that a preponderance of tails result in a brokenline,while three heads form an unbroken line:The first symbolizes the Chinese concept of “yin,” the feminine, the yielding,while the second is “yang,” the forceful and masculine. The coins are thrown sixtimes, and the six lines are laid on one another in a kind of six-deckersandwich.Those who use Richard Wilhelm’s translation, with the introduction by Jung, willrecall that the next step is to turn to the chart at the back of the book, whichcontains sixty-four numbers in a grid of squares, whose sides are eight unitslong. You then look up your “top” trigram along the horizontal edge, and your“lower” trigram along the vertical edge, and the square where the two trigramsmeet is the number of the hexagram you are looking for.In the early stage of his quest, Mike Hayes (as he prefers to be known) hadstudied the I Ching, and wondered idly why the number of hexagrams is eighttimes eight, not seven times seven or nine times nine. And now, with thecoincidence of the DNA code and the hexagrams of the I Ching, he found himselfwondering if this number 64 is some basic code of life.When he learned that there were eight trigrams hidden in DNA, he began to feelthat this was more than an odd coincidence. . . .All this Mike sketched out for me during that phone conversation. And when itwas over, I had decided that reading the whole book was a major priority.What I learned in The Infinite Harmony was that this coincidence was just thebeginning of a whole series of related discoveries. For example, the number 22plays a basic part in the DNA code. Proteins are formed by twenty amino acids,but with two codons forming start and stop signals, making twenty-two in all.And 22 also plays an important part in music, being the number of notes in threeoctaves on the piano. The followers of the Greek philosopher Pythagoras regarded22 as a sacred number, and also 3.Previously, studying the Russian mage Gurdjieff, Mike had also been introducedto something called the law of three. Positive and negative, good and evil,light and darkness, merely counterbalance one another, but a third force isnecessary to combine them—just as the two sides of a zipper are made tointerlock with the fastener in the middle, or two gases will only combine in thepresence of a catalyst that is itself unaffected.Studying the world’s major religions, Mike was struck by how often the numbers22, 3, and 7 occur. The number pi, the relation of a diameter of a circle to itscircumference, is 22 divided by 7. So now he began to look in detail at theworld’s major religions—ancient Egyptian, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Islam,Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Christianity. With increasing excitement,he realized that his numerical discoveries constituted a code that connectedthem all. The same code turned up in alchemy, which led him to label it theHermetic Code, after Hermes Trismegistus, the Greek god who is the patron ofalchemists, and whose best-known dictum is “As above, so below.” And so TheInfinite Harmony came to be written.His chances of publishing such a strange and abstruse book seemed minimal, yetits importance was recognized by an editor at Weidenfeld & Nicolson, and itappeared in 1994. But there the marvelous wave of coincidence and synchronicitythat had carried him so far seemed to run out of strength. The book was notwidely recognized, and opened no further opportunities. And just as Mike wasbeginning to experience a sense of anticlimax, I rang up, and said I intended towrite about it in From Atlantis to the Sphinx.I did just that, and the book came out in 1996, and went into severaleditions—partly because the whole subject of ancient civilizations had becomepopular as a result of Graham Hancock’s remarkable bestseller Fingerprints ofthe Gods, which argued that civilization may be thousands of years older thanarchaeologists believe.By that time, I had met Mike Hayes. He had spent a part of his childhood inPenzance, in Cornwall, and accepted eagerly when I suggested that he should takea few days off writing his second book, and come and renew his acquaintance withCornwall. We spent days driving around, talking endlessly, and he told me manythings about himself and his development that I shall not repeat here, sincethey are in the remarkable and absorbing introduction to this book.Mike proved to be a slightly built, fair-haired man who was in his mid-fortiesat the time I met him. And during the few days he spent in Cornwall (his wife,Ali, had to stay behind to look after their three daughters), I got the same oddfeeling I had experienced while reading The Infinite Harmony: that here was oneof those people that fate seems to throw down into the world to make someimportant discovery.This has always seemed to me true of all scientists and inventors. One of myfavorite television programs is Adam Hart Davis’s Local Heroes, in which hecycles from place to place, and comes upon dozens— in fact hundreds—ofremarkable men and women who have left something behind them, perhaps somethingas straightforward but essential as the lawnmower or hovercraft, perhaps someworld-changing knowledge like relativity or quantum theory.Mike Hayes, I soon came to feel, is one of these.And why do I think he is so important? Because if the genetic code and Mike’sHermetic Code—these numbers that recur constantly throughout all worldreligions—are identical, then there is a fundamental connection betweenmolecular biology and religion. And why is that important? Because ever sinceGregor Mendel created genetics in the nineteenth century, it has been regardedas a science of the mechanism of evolution. Darwin suggested that evolutionprogresses through a mechanical process of the survival of the fittest, but hewas not sure about the nature of the mechanism that creates species. Mendel’sdiscoveries pointed to the genes as the answer.But Darwinism plus Mendelism was even more mechanical than Darwinism alone. Atleast Darwin believed that his colleague Lamarck— and his grandfatherErasmus—might be partly correct in believing that the will of the individualinfluences evolutionary changes. But the neo-Darwinists who accepted Mendel’sdiscoveries as the mechanism of evolution felt that it explained everything.Evolution was now a totally mechanical process—like the erosion of a landscapeby geological forces—for the will of the individual cannot influence his genes.And the most influential of modern geneticists, like Richard Dawkins, are rigidmaterialists.I personally have been attacking this view for the past half century, and havepointed out anomalies that cannot be explained in terms of mechanicalevolution—for example, how a colony of little insects called the flattid bug cancrawl onto a dead twig and then shape themselves into the likeness of a livingflower—a flower that does not even exist in nature. This cannot be explained by“survival of the fittest.” It seems to involve some “group mind” operating at anunconscious level.Now, in showing the connection between the Hermetic Code and the genetic code,Mike Hayes has pointed to the fact that the essence of evolution can also befound in religion, and therefore in the realm of the evolution of consciousness.I found his introductory remarks about the insights he obtained through LSDexciting partly because of his comment, “I clearly perceived that (everythingsolid) is composed, literally, of sparkling, vibrant ‘particles’ of light,” aview that is of central importance to the argument of the book, and that echoesthe vision of so many mystics.Now, I had already come upon this notion in a book called Essay on the Origin ofThought (1974) by a remarkable young philosopher named Jurij Moskvitin. Lyingone day in the sunlight with his eyes half closed, he became aware of a kind ofmoving mosaic pattern through his eyelashes. It seemed to be made of tiny lightfragments, and as he slowly developed the ability to focus them, he recognizedpatterns like those in religious art, “art and ornamentation created bycivilizations dominated by mystical initiation and experience.” These forms, hefinally decided, were made up of “dancing sparks,” a little like the tiny linesin the work of the painter Signac. These sparks, which he decided looked alittle like tadpoles, make up our whole visual field, on which we impose shapes.He compares it to the way that, in a Dutch painting, a wineglass examinedclosely proves to be merely a few strokes of yellow paint. Moskvitin issuggesting that the external world our eyes reveal to us is simply a limitedversion of a larger inner world. I was reminded of Moskvitin’s thesis by MikeHayes’s theory of light—on which he expands greatly in this book.His insights were also close to those of a remarkable anthropologist calledJeremy Narby, who studied among the Ashaninca Indians of Peru, and becameconvinced that their extraordinary knowledge of the medicinal properties offorest plants was obtained through a visionary process involving the drugayahuasca.For example, the drug curare, used on poison darts, is made from a combinationof plants, and the first stage is to boil them for three days, while stayingclear of the deadly vapors. The final product kills monkeys without poisoningtheir meat, and also causes them to relax their grip so they fall from the treeto the ground, instead of clinging to the tree in a death spasm.But there are about eighty thousand species of forest plants. How did theIndians stumble on curare without poisoning themselves first, or wasting theirlives in endless experiment?The same questions arise with regard to ayahuasca. It is made up of two plants,one of which contains a hormone secreted in the human brain, a hallucinogen thatis rendered harmless by a stomach enzyme. In order to prevent it being renderedharmless (and useless as a drug), it has to be mixed with a substance from acreeper. Then it induces visions.How, Narby wondered, did the Indians discover anything so complex? Surely not bytrial and error—trying millions of possible combinations. The shaman’s answerwas that they learned it from drugs, which “told” them the answer.Narby learned a great deal from another anthropologist, Michael Harner, who hadalso experimented with drugs among the Indians. And Harner had declared that hisvisions emanated from giant reptile creatures “like DNA” that resided at thelowest depth of his brain.It struck Narby that DNA looks like two intertwined serpents (as Mike Hayes alsopoints out). The molecule also looks like a spiral ladder, and shamans the worldover talk about ascending a ladder to higher realms of the spirit.Narby himself tried ayahuasca, and reached the same conclusions as Harner. Thedrug introduced him to Harner’s “serpents”:Suddenly I found myself surrounded by two gigantic boa constrictures that seemedfifty feet long. I was terrified. . . . In the middle of these hazy thoughts,the snakes start talking to me without words. They explain that I am merely ahuman being. I feel my mind crack, and in the fissures, I see the bottomlessarrogance of my presuppositions. It is profoundly true that I am just a humanbeing, and, most of the time, I have the impression of understanding everything,whereas here I find myself in a more powerful reality that I do not understandat all and that, in my arrogance, I did not even suspect existed.He began to feel that language itself was inadequate, and that words would nolonger stick to images.But after this alarming beginning, things began to improve as he realized thatthe Indians know their way around in this bizarre reality, and that the mostapparently absurd things they had told him were true. And somehow, the Indiansseemed to be obtaining their information directly from DNA, a concept that seemsless odd when we remember Mike Hayes’s discovery of the similarity between thegenetic code and the I Ching.Later in The Cosmic Serpent, Narby writes, “It seemed that no one had noticedthe possible links between the ‘myths’ of ‘primitive peoples’ and molecularbiology.” And he goes on to make the important comment (in view of Mike Hayes’semphasis on music), “According to the shamans of the entire world, oneestablishes communication with the spirits via music.”Narby dares to ask, “Is there a goal to life? Do we exist for a reason? Ibelieve so, and I think that the combination of shamanism and biology givesundisputed answers to these questions.”Obviously, Jeremy Narby and Mike Hayes have been pursuing parallel courses, andarrived at very similar conclusions.A few words about the present book.In many ways, it is easier to absorb than The Infinite Harmony. To begin with,Hayes discusses in his introduction the pertinent biographical facts that enablethe reader to watch the discovery and unfolding of his ideas. This introductionsays everything that is in The Infinite Harmony, and makes it all beautifullyclear. He then plunges into the questions that are directly related to GrahamHancock’s thesis in Fingerprints of the Gods, Robert Bauval’s in The OrionMystery, and my own in From Atlantis to the Sphinx. Even I, who have now devotedabout ten years to these matters, was fascinated by his treatment of them. Healso points out that there is evidence that Neanderthal man knew about theHermetic Code seventy-five thousand years ago.I shall not try to summarize the rest of the book except to say that it isremarkable for the confidence he shows in handling an immense range of subjects,from modern physics to the paranormal, from evolutionary biology to musicaltheory, from yoga to superconductivity. I was familiar with some of thismaterial, but much of it was unknown to me, and the use he makes of it isstrikingly his own.The performance is often so dazzling, reminding a reader of a juggler who cankeep ten balls in the air at the same time, that the reader might easily bemisled into thinking that this is no more than a brilliant piece of eclecticexposition. But make no mistake: what Mike Hayes has discovered could be asimportant as the original discovery of DNA. Like Jurij Moskvitin and JeremyNarby, he has created a new paradigm—that is, he is looking at our familiaruniverse from a new angle, and making us aware of magical possibilities.COLIN WILSONColin Wilson is a prolific author and philosopher whose 1956 breakout work TheOutsider helped popularize existentialism in Britain. Later, when existentialismfell out of fashion, he became a symbol of the British version of the beatgeneration as a member of the “Angry Young Men,” in which he was the head of asmall group of existentialist philosophers. Beyond his early politicalinfluence, his more than 108 titles convey his enormous literary scope—rangingfrom philosophy, crime, occult, literary criticism, and short fiction—andinclude From Atlantis to the Sphinx, Atlantis and the Kingdom of theNeanderthals, and his autobiography, Dreaming to Some Purpose.

This, significantly, was when I firstchanced to think about that ultimate question in life: death. I remember feelinggreatly disturbed that I was unable to comprehend this truly awesome prospect.What made matters worse was the fact that the adults around me were not onlyequally clueless in this respect; it seemed to me that they didn’t even want tothink about it. But then this was England in the mid-fifties, and the grown-upshad just survived a horrendous global war. For many of them the unspeakablefacts of death must have been an all-too-prevalent and uncomfortable reality, soit is not surprising that I was usually given short shrift whenever I asked oneof the available big people to show me the netherworld on a world map.As it turned out, and for reasons I cannot explain, I have been drawn to ponderthis question many times over many years. So, if nothing else, the subject hasbeen a recurrent reminder to me of the transient, apparently futile nature ofindividual existence. But it has also, I think, been a primary factor indetermining one of my major motivations in life—to try to understand the meaningand purpose of our being, to establish some kind of meaningful perspective fromwhich to view our true position in the cosmic scheme of things. Basically, Isimply want to know what is going on around me. Don’t you?So, what is this thing death, this future happening looming over the horizon ofour lives like some conceptual black hole? Can the process be elucidated,defined in terms we can understand? My answer is a cautious yes, and I shallexplain why in due course.As for death’s equally mystifying opposite, the counterbalance we loosely calllife, this too cries out to be understood. Evolutionists think they have crackedit by charting the increasingly complex interactive development, over fourthousand million years, of the RNA and DNA molecules—which is fine, as far as itgoes—but where does the evolution of consciousness fit into the Darwinianpicture? Indeed, can it fit? That is, is it possible to explain the thoughtprocesses of the modern hominid in terms of the current theory of evolution?Actually I don’t personally know of any evolutionists out there who are aware ofthis fact, but the answer, once again, is yes. As I see it, the systematic,biomolecular process involved in the evolution of DNA is a perfect model of theworking of the healthy human mind.So what I currently have to offer is an ambitious, but serious, proposition,which is that life and death are in a certain and unique way entirelycomprehensible.As I said, what follows is the record of a personal journey, but this is also,by its very nature, an account of the entire evolutionary journey of theconscious hominid. What began for me in the fifties, with what might be called achance thought, has been happening to thinkers for many thousands of years. So,in effect, I have merely tuned in to an already existing stream of ideas, achannel of intelligent information whose list of presenters and pastcontributors reads like a roll call of the immortals—scientists, philosophers,saints, mythmakers, saviors.We will therefore have to go back in time to trace the origin of this “thought”of mine: back to ancient Egypt and Greece, and to China, India, Palestine,Arabia, and the Americas. One of the principal reasons for looking back is thatmost of these ancient cultures developed a religion, or a mythology, to explainthe mystery of life and death. Indeed, this almost wholly preoccupied theearliest peoples. And, significantly, although different cultures over themillennia have expressed their ideas in apparently diverse ways and idioms, theyall agree on one fundamental point: that there is an existence after death. Asit happens, the originators of all the major belief systems also concurred onone other fundamental point in respect of life.But first things first. My own personal account is the warp of this metaphysicaldesign, so we must for the time being stick to the minor plot; the greater weftwill be woven in chapter by chapter.In the early sixties, I dutifully went to grammar school, obtained mediocre GCEpasses, and subsequently took up a position selling advertising space for alocal newspaper. Disillusionment soon crept in. A large workplace can be aquagmire of trivia and petty jealousies and, to avoid being sucked in, I becamea corporate drifter, aimlessly careerhopping from one meaningless job toanother.Meanwhile my alter ego was heading off on a completely different trail. By thetime of the late sixties, he was already blowing in the wind, unwittinglyheading for a second memorable jolt. This happened when, quite by chance, I cameacross a certain psychedelic agent called purple haze.Purple haze was the name given to a particularly pure batch of LSD that hit thestreets of my town in the winter of 1968, one tiny tablet of which happened tocome my way. It cost me thirty bob and about eight earth hours, but such was itsimpact upon me that it changed my whole life, for, quite suddenly, after thisone, mind-blowing experience, I became absolutely convinced of the existence ofother dimensions beyond my own tiny, subjective conceptual domain. This newlyfound awareness made life appear much more interesting. But more perplexing.More trips inevitably followed, always, without exception, profoundlyilluminating, producing in me such powerful waves of emotion that I felt I couldvery easily be swept out to some mystic sea and be gone forever. Whether theseglimpses into other worlds were real or imaginary was a question I neverbothered to ask, but my perceptions were so vivid and incomparably impressivethat they made my molelike working life seem like a form of penal servitude.It has been more than twenty years since I last took a trip, and I have nointention of taking another in the foreseeable future. Neither do I recommendthe use of psychedelics to anyone. I am merely reporting here. My own“transgressions” were directed largely by circumstance. This thing—this drug—wasnew and radical, and virtually everyone in my peer group was experimenting withit. Obviously, in another time and another place, with different peers, I mighthave taken an alternative route to the present.So, to get to the point, which is to explain why my psychedelic experiencesshould be of such importance to my story. It has all to do with the impressionsI had then. To be sure, very little remained of the total experience after eachof these illicit forays into inner space, but certain key impressions did remainindelibly imprinted on my mind.The first was that everything solid or material—houses, trees, rocks, mountains,people—were all possessed with a kind of inner light of their own. That is, Iclearly perceived that these things, or objects, were composed, literally, ofsparkling, vibrant, “particles” of light.It is entirely possible, of course, that this is not so—that “things” are notcomposed of light at all—and that the impression was simply a drug-induced falseconsciousness. However, when the hallucination, or whatever it is, appears to beinfinitely more striking and meaningful than anything so-called reality canthrow up, then I think I have good reason to pay heed to it—which, indeed, Ihave done ever since. And, in fact, although I was unaware of this at the time,I was later to discover that my impression was corroborated by two quitedifferent and independent sources.In the first instance, Einstein had already shown that light quanta, i.e.,photons, were “particles.” Second, the idea that matter is simply one particularform of light has been common currency among the holy men of the East forcenturies.The second major impression (or hallucination) had to do with time—or, rather,the absence of it. I could never explain it, not even to myself, but in thesealtered states time seemed to stand still. I remember that the word eternal cameto mind more than once when I was attempting to describe this condition.Interestingly, this particular notion—that there are “timeless” realms, ordimensions, of existence—is not at all unique. In fact, it is part and parcel ofpractically every major religion and mystical belief system known. If you thinkof familiar scriptural concepts like heaven, eternity, time without end, therealm of Him that liveth for ever and ever, and so on, all these so-calledreligious notions seem to suggest that legions of contemplatives have in thepast had glimpses or feelings similar to mine. Further, as with the earlierimpression that matter is made up of vibrating particles of light, this secondidea of a “timeless” form of reality has also been quite clearly expressed inindependent sources. For example, through the development of modern quantumtheory, it has been discovered that, in the “world” of the subatomic particle,time as we know it (or as we think we know it) has no place: it is statisticallymeaningless.For me, this idea of an “eternal” dimension of existence was especiallyappealing, because it seemed to hint at a possible way out of the time-ladenquicksand in which we hapless mortals become immersed. That is, if there was anysubstance at all to my extratemporal experiences, then maybe we—you, me,everyone—need never truly die.I have always been an avid reader, but over the years my taste changed with mycircumstances. So, by the end of the sixties, works of fiction, classic andpopular, were gradually replaced by books on science and what my elder brotherTony laughingly called “all that esoteric stuff.” He was right, of course. Thehippies were on the move, traveling in droves to the East, reading books by andabout countless Indian holy men, Sufis, Western occultists, and Lobsang Rampaand Erich von Däniken to boot. I readily joined in the party, reading all kindsof spiritual and philosophical fare. Much of it I found pretty ineffectual:hearsay, vague allusions, apocryphal stories, parables, and outrightguesswork—but all in all I was temporarily hooked, greatly impressed by the vastnumbers of mostly sincere writers from all walks of life attempting tounderstand the nature of consciousness. Of all intellectual pursuits, theexploration of the human mind seemed to me to be the most worthwhile. If wecould reach journey’s end on this one, all other questions might fall neatlyinto place, side by side with their answers.The trouble was, although a lot of the books circulating in the seventiescontained many interesting ideas, after reading them I still had no idea whatwas really going on in people’s heads. So many writers claimed to have all theanswers, but when it came down to the nittygritty, everything seemed to end witha question mark. I had no inkling then that a major clue was in the offing, butI was soon to find a man who had some important answers. What is more, he wasn’tentirely unique.Usually with my wife, Ali, I made several trips to the East during theseventies. Often we would stop off and visit my brother, who at that time wasliving in Mashad in northeastern Iran. Tony, who never stopped travelingthroughout the whole of his abbreviated life, had at this stage in his journeymarried and converted to Islam.This was in the days of the pro-Western Shah, and Iran had a booming economy,affording plenty of opportunity to anyone with an entrepreneurial flair. Andyet, despite all this, the people remained deeply religious, especially inMashad, one of Iran’s holy cities, home of the great mosque of themuch-venerated Islamic saint Imam Reza, the fourteenth imam in a direct line ofhigh initiates that began with the Prophet Muhammad himself.During these visits, I was always struck by the intense fervor and passion ofMuslim worshippers there. Their tears were obviously very real, and theiremotions seemed to be charged with a vitality of a kind seldom encountered inChristianity. To these people, prayer was a genuine, wholehearted celebration, aloud, proud, public affirmation of their devotion to Allah and His Prophet.I must admit that my interest in Islam, although it impressed me greatly, neverpassed beyond an observational level. What intrigued me most about it was thesheer emotional power that this metaphysical phenomenon had so effectivelyharnessed. There was a self-evident force at work here—not a force that could beempirically measured according to established scientific criteria, but a realsource of power nonetheless, one so energetic, in fact, that it could somehowcause millions of people from different ethnic backgrounds all over the world tosimultaneously move, speak, and act in concert. Perhaps the most curious thingabout this remarkably well-coordinated mass movement of human beings is that itwas all set in motion by one man.When I try to picture Muhammad in my mind, I see a person of true genius, thelight of Allah sparkling in his eyes, a clear vision of the future march ofIslam stretching out before him. Here, quite evidently, was a man who knewexactly what he was doing, an individual who understood the workings of thehuman mind like few others. How else could he have created such a powerfulliving movement? Luck? Accident? I really don’t think so. There is a weird kindof magic afoot here, and it comes to us today in the form of a tangiblesupernatural force—the mysterious power of Islam. Now, this force exists, itcannot be denied, and I am saying that the person who purposefully created itwas—and indeed still is—without doubt a giant among men. Irrefutable evidence tosupport this view is provided daily, weekly, continuously for all to see, whenmillions of Muslims all over the world emulate their leader by taking time toalign themselves with this great spiritual source. Similar individuals haveappeared elsewhere in history, and we shall be meeting some of them in thisbook, but in my view the Prophet was the last.After my initial brush with Islam I soon started to recognize certainsimilarities with the other great religions. In particular, they had allapparently been set in motion by single individuals, then, incredibly, hadsubsequently inspired the voluntary participation, over thousands of years, ofmillions, billions of people.So eventually it became clear to me that there are very real forces profoundlyaffecting the human brain at work within these religious and philosophicalmovements. Think of Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism,Islam, and so on. Nowhere in the entire “civilized” world is it possible toavoid some kind of contact with one or other of these apparentlyincomprehensible influences. They emanate from every church, mosque, synagogue,and temple.Now, recognizing the existence of such forces is one thing, but understandinghow and why they operate so effectively is quite another. I pondered over thisunfathomable mystery for years, reasoning that the founders of the majorreligions must have had one fundamental factor in common, which enabled each ofthem dramatically to affect the lives of whole races of people—but what thiswas, I had not the least idea.A BREAKTHROUGHThen in France, some time in the mid-seventies, a fellow traveler called JohnMullins told me about a book he had read recently which had impressed him verymuch. I asked my wife to send me a copy from England. It was a propitious move.The book in question, In Search of the Miraculous, was an account by the Russianwriter Pyotr Demianovitch Ouspensky, of his meetings with George Gurdjieff, aGreek-Armenian teacher of “esoteric wisdom” whom he met in Moscow in 1915.Ostensibly the book is a record of talks given by Gurdjieff to his pupils over aperiod of about eight years. I had never heard of Gurdjieff or his principalpupil prior to this, but after reading Ouspensky’s brilliant piece of reportagefrom cover to cover, stopping only to eat, drink, and catnap, I can truthfullysay that encountering the teachings of this man was one of the most importantstages in my entire voyage of discovery. I could write a book on this book, butthat would be a digression—and in any case I would simply be diluting what iseasily obtainable from any good bookshop. The main thrust of Gurdjieff’steaching, however, I will briefly mention here, because it is relevant to thispart of my tale.Basically he taught that the universe and everything within it is made up ofvibrations, resonating, interactive “signals,” which permeate through all kinds,aspects, and densities of matter. This almost immediately struck a familiarchord in me, because it reminded me of my earlier impression that all matter ismade up of sparkling (vibrating) particles of light. What really made me sit up,however, was Gurdjieff’s explanation of how these vibrations move throughmatter, time, and space.Gurdjieff said that all processes, all “vibrations,” both in the world and inman, are governed by two fundamental laws—laws that were understood in theremotest antiquity.The first is the law of three, which says that every action, every phenomenon inthe universe, is the direct result of the mutual interaction of three forces:active, passive, and neutral. If you ever do something so basic as change athree-pin plug, or use a catalyst in a chemical experiment involving two othercompounds, or watch a referee do his job, or examine the structure of an atom,you will recognize immediately the action of these three forces. They arefundamental, everywhere; quite literally, universal. If you have only twoforces—active and passive—the result is either deadlock or destruction, but if athird, reconciliatory force is introduced, anything and everything can happen.Gurdjieff said that this concept was the basis of the Holy Trinity of Christiantradition. This in turn implies, of course, that Christianity itself wasformulated by people of a scientific turn of mind, people who understood theprinciple of the three interacting forces, the forces of creation. And, ofcourse, the Trinity, in one way or another, is a fundamental component ofvirtually every major religion, a fact that suggests that “science” itself—thescience of creation—is indeed rooted in the distant past. Scholars may arguethat the Trinity was in fact denied by certain monotheistic religions such asJudaism or Islam, which assert emphatically that there is only one God. Butconsider this: the most significant act of creation in the whole of Islamictradition was the revelation to Muhammad of “God’s words,” which weresubsequently compiled as the book known as the Koran. We thus have twoparticipants, Allah and His Prophet. We should note, however, that Muhammad issaid to have received his revelations not directly from God Himself, but throughan intermediary, the archangel Gabriel—enter the third force. This exactprinciple is described in the first verse of the first chapter of Genesis: “Inthe beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” You can’t get much clearerthan that. Creation is the result of three forces. This is the first law.The second ancient law is the law of octaves. This says that all vibrationsmoving through matter, and through man, develop—that is, ascend, descend, growstronger, weaker, and so forth—precisely as a musical octave develops, that is,in proportional steps of seven or eight. Now, this development, apparently, doesnot proceed uniformly, in a smooth ascension or descension, but erratically,with certain regular “glitches” in the line of motion. Just like a musicaloctave, in fact.For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the structure of the octave, or themajor musical scale, the notes Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, Do are each separatedby a series of intervals or tones, five of which are whole, and two of which areonly half-tones, like so:[images/1.jpg]or, as illustrated by the keys of a piano:[images/2.jpg]The half-tones—between the notes mi–fa and ti–Do—are the glitches justmentioned. Said Gurdjieff, “The seven-tone scale is the formula of a cosmic lawwhich was worked out by ancient schools and applied to music.”1[26_note.html#fo1a]Exactly how ancient these schools were is never specified, but Gurdjieff in hisown writings suggests that the Pythagoreans, usually credited as being theoriginators of practical musical theory, had actually rediscovered a long-lostscience.During his talks, Gurdjieff gives Ouspensky many examples in naturedemonstrating the action of the forces described by the two fundamental laws.These forces, for example, dictate the structure of white light, the sevencolors of the spectrum, and the sevenfold symmetries of the periodic table ofchemical elements. He also describes the physical structure of the universe inmusical terms, even including in his unique worldview the biological andpsychological composition of the human being. All of these phenomena, Gurdjieffsaid, are essentially musically structured. His evidence, as presented toOuspensky, was for me extremely compelling, and I instinctively felt that hereat last was a real nugget of spiritual knowledge, a genuine, 24-carat kernel oftruth. And I was right, as we shall see.Of course, knowledge is one thing, but understanding how best to use it is quiteanother. This is what made Gurdjieff unique among all the people whose ideas Ihad previously encountered, because he didn’t simply present original andinteresting knowledge, he applied it in an entirely practical and comprehensibleway.I must try to keep things simple at this stage, as my preliminary story is notyet finished. All one needs to know here is that the practical aspect of thisknowledge—the core of which is musical theory—is based on a systematicapplication of these “musical” rules as something like a code of personalconduct. The theory is that, by doing this, by introducing musical rhythms andelements into our lives in an orderly and disciplined way, it is possible for usto evolve, to become more and more conscious (i.e., harmonious) at a much fasterrate than is normally envisaged by evolutionists. We can call this the principleof “transcendental evolution,” which holds that a harmonious individual is likea fully evolved octave and is capable, through the final “note” Do at the top ofthe given scale, of striking a single new note, or impulse, into a greater scaleabove. This greater scale, or dimension, the ancients called heaven. Darwiniststake note: what is being implied here is that there are certain limitations tocurrent evolutionary theory, that it is, at best, incomplete.In between life’s periodic distractions, I studied Gurdjieff’s ideas for severalyears, on and off. I read everything by and about him that I could find. Heapparently drew his ideas from a number of ancient traditions, as referred to inOuspensky’s book—Egyptian, Christian, Buddhist, Dervish, Hindu, and so on. Ofcourse, these were, broadly speaking, the very same religious movements that hadintrigued me for years, which I had surmised were sources of strangemetaphysical power that could quite literally move legions of the faithful.There was an obvious and important link here, but for some time its realsignificance escaped me.In the early eighties life slowed down. We had two young children by then and,as there were inevitably a number of conspicuous gaps in my CV, finding aregular and amenable occupation proved difficult. These were days of highunemployment, and the corporate drifter found himself up against stifferopposition than he had expected. In the end, after several halfhearted attemptsto reenter the professional workplace, he decided to go back to school, takingexploratory extramural courses in numerous and often tedious and uninspiringsubjects. There was, however, one short course—a module dealing with thebiomolecular world, with DNA and the genetic code—that ultimately turned out tobe exactly what I had been looking for.This was in the summer of 1984. I had been reading a great deal at this time,both textbook stuff and books of my own choosing. One week, genetics orastronomy, perhaps, or a droning essay on Karl Popper; another week, JohnMichell, Colin Wilson, or Idris Shah, or possibly a couple of chapters ofGurdjieff’s monumental epic Beelzebub’s Tales to His Grandson. This multilayeredtome is over a thousand pages long and no easy read, with sentences the lengthof paragraphs, paragraphs pages long, and dozens of obscure new words inventedby the author—for the express purpose, one suspects, of making reading it aneven more difficult task. Gurdjieff advised his followers to read it three times(presumably in accordance with the law of three). The fact that I undertook thisdaunting task may say something about me that I wouldn’t care to hear, but Icompleted it, nevertheless, in several stages, over a period of about fiveyears.I need not comment on the book itself. As with Ouspensky’s, I could write alengthy treatise on it—or try to—and even then would possibly succeed inconveying only a small fraction of its intended meaning. The point I want tomake here is that Gurdjieff’s ground-breaking ideas were well to the fore in mymind. In fact, practically all of the thoughts and ideas I have mentioned so farwere jiggling around in my head, like ephemeral, dancing genes: life . . . death. . . light . . . timelessness . . . matter . . . vibrations . . . religion . .. force . . . Gurdjieff . . . music.It was virtually all there, like the scattered pieces of a jigsaw, but theoverall picture still eluded me.Now let’s return to the genetic code. Probably most of you will at least haveheard of this chemical arrangement, used by the DNA in the cells of your body tomanufacture amino acids, the building blocks of all organic life.In order to give myself a kind of visual aid, an image of the code in action, Ihad drawn up a diagram incorporating the key numbers of the biochemicalcomponents involved in the process. These were 4, 3, 64, and 22. That is, thereare four kinds of chemical bases. It takes three of them to make what is knownas a triplet codon, an amino acid template, of which there are exactlysixty-four variations. Each of these codons correspond to one or another oftwenty-two more complex components, namely, the twenty amino acids and the twocoded instructions for starting and stopping the process of synthesis. In mydiagram, the number 64, the number of tripletcodon combinations (4 × 4 × 4), wasrepresented by a square grid, eight divisions across and eight down, like achessboard.[images/3.jpg]It struck me immediately that there was a curious kind of symmetry involved withthese particular number combinations, one that was entirely familiar to me andthat I had seen many times before. I realized, in fact, that the whole diagramechoed the format of the famous Chinese work known as the I Ching (Yi King),whose sixty-four basic texts are each identified with a six-line symbol called ahexagram.The I Ching, the so-called Book of Changes, was one of the more popular workscirculating among “New-agers” in the sixties and seventies, and I had browsedthrough it several times. It was intended for use as an oracle: you pose aquestion, toss three coins, and note the way they fall. A preponderance of headsgives an unbroken line—“yang,” positive; tails a broken line—“yin,” negative.There is an older method of consultation using a clutch of forty-nine yarrowstalks, but the principle is the same. Repeat the action six times and you willhave called up one of the hexagrams. The accompanying text supplies your answer.Although I was never drawn to actually consult the I Ching, I had always beenintrigued by its structure.As I said earlier, the key numbers of my genetic diagram were 4, 3, 64, and 22.Let’s begin with the number 4, the number of fundamental chemical bases in thegenetic code (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) upon which the wholeprocess of amino-acid synthesis depends. The I Ching, I discovered, embodiesexactly the same principle. The sixty-four hexagrams are actually constructedfrom four, basic, two-line symbols known as the Hsiang. These in turn werederived from the two fundamental lines, one broken and one unbroken, knownrespectively as yin and yang.Next, the number 3. The genetic code, as was evident, obeyed the law of threeforces, which is why only triplet codons are evident in the process of creation.The three forces are initially represented in the Book of Changes by the twooriginal yin and yang lines, and a third factor called the Great Extreme: thatis yin (negative, female), yang (positive, male) and neutral, the third,invisible or “mystical” ingredient, the tao. This greater trinity is fundamentalto the whole system, but the number 3 also occurs in a way that correspondsexactly with the genetic code, because each of the hexagrams is described asbeing composed of two “trigrams,” two three-line signals.We now come to the number 64. As we have noted, the I Ching is composed ofsixty-four hexagrams. At first glance it seems as if the genetic code deviatesfrom this pattern, with its sixty-four triplet units. However, it should benoted that the genetic code functions as a dynamic system, and as such should beviewed as an ongoing, evolutionary process, in which every part is connectedboth with the simpler processes below and also with the more complex componentsabove. Thus we can see that there is, in fact, another side to the codontemplate, the amino acid itself, which must also, by its very nature, be tripartin structure. So we have one triplet codon and one amino acid—a biochemical“hexagram.” Incidentally, triplet-codon templates originate inside the DNAmolecule, as copies of segments of its internal structure; this means, ofcourse, that DNA itself is also composed of sixty-four biochemical hexagrams.By this time, having recognized so many similarities between the IChing and thegenetic code, I was convinced that I was on to something of profound importance,and my emotional state reflected this: I was highly charged. No way, I thought,could the identical features of these two apparently disparate systems be theproduct of mere coincidence, for they were not only identical in structure; itseemed that they each had a common purpose, which was to facilitate the processof evolution. Just think about this for a moment: the genetic code is used tocreate a greater organic structure; the I Ching, the Book of Changes, issupposedly used to create a greater, more enlightened being. The principle isexactly the same.With a greatly increased respect for it, I returned to the I Ching severaltimes—not to read it or to consult it, but to concentrate on its structure. Ifelt that its real secrets must lie in the symbolism expressed in its format andthat the accompanying texts were simply an embellishment, merely repeating, inlonghand, what the hexagrams were already telling me.Now these hexagrams, as I said earlier, just like the biochemical hexagrams ofthe genetic code, each consist of two trigrams, two three-line symbols, oneabove, one below. The trigrams, eight in number, were derived from the fourHsiang, by successively placing over each of them the two original broken andunbroken lines. When these same two lines are placed over the eight trigrams,the result is sixteen figures of four lines. Repeat the process once again andyou get thirty-two figures of five lines, and a final similar movement producesthe sixty-four hexagrams.Unlike the four- and five-line figures, the eight trigrams, known as the kwa,are given particular prominence in the system. I mused over these for a longtime, juggling with their numbers. Eight threes. Three eights. Twenty-four. Ineeded twenty-two. Close, but not close enough. Certainly the number 8 was anintegral part of the overall symmetry, being the square root of that magical 64;but why did the sum of the trigrams not conform to the twenty-two codon signalsof the genetic code? Why twenty-four? Why eight?It was an exhilarating moment when the light finally dawned and the answer,which came filtering through in the form of the tiniest of thoughts, explodedsilently inside my head: “Heptaparaparshinokh.”This peculiar word is one of Gurdjieff’s creations, and it is repeated manytimes in Beelzebub’s Tales. It means, quite simply, the law of octaves, the lawof seven (sometimes expressed as the law of eight),2 [26_note.html#fo2b] the lawby which, he had said, everything proceeds. Everything? Including the geneticcode and the I Ching?So there it was; obviously the symmetry I had been looking at was musicallybased. It had to be. Here was my chessboard: eight divisions across, like anoctave; eight divisions down, another octave; and sixty-four divisions acrossthe grid, an octave squared.I then remembered what Gurdjieff had written in Beelzebub’s Tales about theorigins of musical theory. He said that the Greeks only rediscovered thescience, and that its true origins were far more remote in time. No dates aregiven, but what he had to say about its originators turned out to be extremelypertinent. Beelzebub informs us that, a very long time ago, there once lived twobrothers—princes—in ancient China. These men were direct descendants of a highinitiate who survived the cataclysm that destroyed ancient Atlantis, and it wasfrom his teachings, passed down through the generations, that they learned ofthe law of octaves.According to most commentators on ancient Chinese history, the creator of thetrigrams was a legendary sage called Fu-hsi, thought to have lived in the thirdmillennium BCE. King Wen of the Chou dynasty and his son, Tan, the Duke of Chou,added the texts much later, around 1140 BCE. Princes, kings, dukes . . . it allsounded very familiar.In the same section of Beelzebub’s Tales there is a detailed account of howthese ancient men of genius verified for themselves the law of octaves (aided byexperiments with light, prisms, and other, strange paraphernalia), and how,subsequently, this knowledge became lost. As I recalled how the I Ching wasbeing so casually used simply as a pocket fortune-teller, I could see how truethis was. These people never acknowledged the “music” inherent in the system.They “played” it without even knowing.But now I felt that I had found it again, the secret of life, no less, the musicof life, the music in you and in me, in the I Ching and the genetic code—andeven, if Gurdjieff’s claims hold true, in the cosmos itself.And the number 22? It fits perfectly, as can be seen from the Pythagoreanversion of this ancient science. This number was one of the key numbers of theirsystem, principally because of its musical aspect. It represented, in fact,three octaves of vibrations, or notes, three sets of eight—twenty-fourcomponents.If you look at a twenty-two note scale in diagrammatic form, you will see thatthe first octave is made up of the eight familiar fundamental notes: Do, re, mi,fa, so, la, ti, Do. The eighth note, Do, however, is also simultaneously thefirst note of the second octave. So the two octaves overlap. Similarly, theeighth note of the second octave—again Do—is also the first note of the third;so these again overlap. In this way we see that the twenty-two divisionsactually represent what is, in reality, a manifestation of twenty-fourinterrelated components—three individual octaves, or 8–8–8:[images/4.jpg]Now see what happens when we apply to the phenomenon described above the firstlaw of nature—the law of three forces—which tells us that each of the individualoctaves are themselves tripart in structure, composed inwardly of three octaveseach. This produces nine subordinate octaves:[images/5.jpg]Nine octaves, of course—from the first base note, Do, to the last— containprecisely sixty-four fundamental notes.INTERIMThe story I have just related is only the beginning of the next, which even nowis still unfolding. From that time onward, the summer of 1984, I spent severalyears exploring the mazelike annals of history. I automatically assumed that, ifthe Chinese and the Greeks were “tuned in” to this ancient science referred toso frequently by Gurdjieff, then it was probable that so were some of the othertraditions and civilizations he mentioned. As it turned out, the evidence wasoverwhelming. Everywhere I looked I saw musical symbols beaming back at me:every known major religion and esoteric tradition in recorded history hadembraced this science as a code of conduct, a harmonious mode of being. Here, infact, was the missing common factor I had long felt existed, that magicalingredient that had given religious movements the power to affect the minds andhearts of billions in such a profound and extraordinary way. They were allunerringly based on the principle of harmony, a harmony that is echoed in,literally, every single cell of our bodies, in our DNA and in the genetic code.This is, therefore, a natural harmony, one that must naturally appeal to thedeepest and innermost instincts of DNA’s ultimate creation: Homo sapienssapiens.Remember, DNA has been successfully using this method of evolution for billionsof years. And now look what it is capable of. What began in the primeval soupwith a single-celled organism has culminated in the creation of the conscioushuman being. That’s quite a leap, even if it did span four thousand millionyears.And then, somewhere along the line—very recently by evolutionary standards—agroup of extremely gifted individuals somehow came to realize that the best wayforward was to get right back down to basics, to a musical mode of being thatwas in harmony with the natural evolutionary processes of nature. This, surely,is Science with a capital “s”; it is the science, and in one way or another, ittouches all others. And, as we shall see, in terms of the cumulative effect ithas had upon the human race, and of the numbers of people who, over severalthousand years, have been drawn to study its principles, it genuinely has nopeer.Now, these ancient men of genius, the first practitioners of the noble art ofright living, subsequently disseminated their superior knowledge far and wide,across the entire globe, across millennia of time. The results of my researchesinto this extraordinary cultural phenomenon were finally published in 1994 in myfirst book, The Infinite Harmony.The book begins with Old Kingdom Egypt, where the symbol of the octave firstappeared in the form of their pantheon of eight gods, four male (yang) and fourfemale (yin), said to have materialized on the fabled Island of Flame, theprimary source of light. There were, in fact, three coexistent creation myths inOld Kingdom Egypt, and in all of them the octave format is paramount.Furthermore, as with virtually every major religion, Egyptian theology embraceda trinity of three major deities: Osiris, Isis, and Horus—an expression of thelaw of three, and the triple octave, composed of twenty-two notes. In fact, themathematical convention pi (p), expressed numerically as 22/7, is first andforemost a symbol of the triple octave, an encoded description of the law ofoctaves and the law of three forces. Orthodox historians will tell you that thisformula wasn’t known in Old Kingdom Egypt, but this, as I have shown elsewhere,is an entirely false assumption. Indeed, the pi formula was not only known bythese people, it was applied in a wholly practical way in respect of theirday-to-day activities, and can be identified quite clearly in importantadministrative documents of the Old Kingdom.3 [26_note.html#fo3c] This is quiteapart from the evidence of the Great Pyramid itself, of course, the structuralproportions of which accurately express the mathematical value of “classical”pi.Incidentally, the pi relationship has also been discovered in the dimensions andproportions of the so-called Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacán in Mexico and,most recently, in the structures of Stonehenge in England and the “step pyramid”of Silbury Hill in southern England—details that suggest that the disseminationof the knowledge of this musical code was a genuine worldwide movement. Later onwe can look at these relationships in more detail.Subsequent sections of The Infinite Harmony are devoted to tracing the ongoingdevelopment of this musical influence, which flows like a river of pure thoughtthrough all the major belief systems in history, including Judaism,Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Christianity, Islam,and the alchemical schools of the Middle Ages. But then, as if thisextraordinarily potent stream of ideas flowing unhindered through earlier timeswere not a remarkable enough phenomenon, later in this book we shall note howthe main tenets of this ancient teaching are now finding conceptual nicheswithin the framework of the most advanced, systematic disciplines of our ownage. We see this not only in the science of genetics, as just discussed, butalso, as will become apparent, in particle physics and even astrophysics andcosmology.The final chapter of my first book takes a detailed look at the musicalstructures of the biomolecular world, the realm of DNA and the genetic code, ofamino acids and protein macromolecules.Now this musical symmetry is real, it exists for all to see, and I don’t believeI have contrived it in any way. I have merely looked at the facts as presentedto me by experts in their respective fields, and then strung them together intowhat I see as a clearly recognizable musical pattern. Music is life; life ismusic: this is what I have learned from the facts. But of course the mostimportant, and perhaps controversial, fact of all those arising from my researchis that the musical symmetry dictating the evolution of the human gene pool wasnot only identified by ancient peoples, it was actively employed in their dailylives as a complete way of being, a “religion.”As the first recorded version of this archaic science first appeared in the Niledelta about five thousand years ago, I have called this musical symmetry theHermetic Code, after Hermes Trismegistus, the Greek name for Thoth, the ancientEgyptian god of wisdom. This musical symmetry, as I have said, is precisely whatthe formula pi was designed to express; that is, the law of seven and the law ofthree—the triple octave, composed of twenty-two notes. And remember, the law ofthree tells us that each of the individual octaves so expressed is also tripartin structure: it is composed of three “inner” octaves, making nine octaves intotal—exactly sixty-four fundamental notes, the square of the constant number,8. This is the Hermetic Code, a universal formula that, as we shall find out,encompasses within it practically everything.Having thus outlined my preliminary ideas, it is now time for us to embark on agreater journey of discovery—to new territories that I myself have yet toexplore fully. Therefore much of the discussion that follows is to a largeextent speculative in nature. We shall be dealing with “facts,” of course, manyof them astonishing—unbelievable even—but empirical data, however pertinent, cantake us only so far. If we wish to go to realms existing beyond the bounds of“logical” thought—which is where this narrative is intended to take the reader—then we may have to temper our “knowledgeable” worldview with liberal measuresof two of the most elusive of human faculties: instinct and intuition.Instinct, as most people understand it, is a gut feeling, something in one’sbones. I am sure that we have all experienced this impulse in one way oranother. Instinct may well be the primary cause of the emergence, over the pastfive millennia, of the inordinately powerful religious movements referred toearlier. These are long-held traditions, essentially rhythmic in form andmethod, and they are steadfastly adhered to by billions of ordinary people evennow. These religions were founded, as I have explained, on the principles ofmusical symmetry, a symmetry that is so clearly evident in our DNA—literally inour bones. This could mean that the inclination to pray, for example, on everyseventh day may, to a large extent, be the product of instinct. The “holy”Sabbath is the seventh day/note in an octave of time; the eighth “note”—Sundayin Christianity—is also the first day/note in the next “octave,” the next week.Clearly this essentially “religious” division of time is no arbitrary invention.It is musically based. It has “rhythm,” it has “soul”; it is a perfect exampleof real “live music,” of the Hermetic Code in action.Now intuition, on the other hand, is generally believed to operate from what wecall our subconscious minds—a seemingly inexplicable, faster-than-light processof instantaneous recognition, flashing on and off in sparse, random bursts,conveniently providing us with sensible answers to “impossible” questions—andvery often when we least expect them. If this has never happened to you, theidea might seem too vague or fanciful to be taken seriously. To dispel anydoubt, consult the recognized experts, by which I mean trained and disciplinedthinkers in virtually all fields of scientific investigation, past and present.I think you would be hard-pressed to find more than a handful of theseindividuals working today who would deny the existence of the intuitive processin the functioning of the questing human mind. Indeed, as we shall see later,modern scientific enquiry thrives on it.To put all this simply, I am asking readers to open their minds and try to putaside all preconceptions about, well, almost everything. I realize, of course,that this is a tall order in these troubled and confused times, but theexpansive, sometimes dizzying journey we are about to make requires that we be,as it were, “fleet of foot,” relatively free from dogma and conceptually readyfor anything. Having said all that, there is one crucial fact that we need bearin mind: that the Hermetic Code, the blueprint of all creation, has been knownand understood as such since the dawn of our civilization.As will become clear, the originators of this code discovered a spectacularsphere of existence, its expanse far beyond the confines of today’s imagination.It stretches backward and forward in time, to infinity: through historical time(as far as it goes), through geological time, to the first stirrings of life onearth—and even further still, through cosmological time, to the origin of theuniverse itself, the big bang. This remarkable worldview also encompasses allkinds of space: the inner space of the molecule, the atom and the subatomicparticle, the space you and I perceive as “real” space, and the greater scalesof space above us—the space of the planet, the solar system, the galaxy, thegalactic supercluster. In truth, there is not a single phenomenon that isexcluded from this all-encompassing cosmic plan, not even life, death, and theultimate fate of our expanding universe.Obviously, therefore, at certain stages in this investigation we shall have tolook at some of the weird and wonderful notions of modern science—in particular,some of the key advances made in particle physics, astrophysics, genetics, andevolutionary theory. As a nonscientist, I trust that my interpretations of thesecomplex, sometimes perplexing, ideas, will be clear enough for most readers tofollow. In any event, they are necessary excursions, as a basic understanding ofrecent scientific thought will enable us to compare it with some of the theoriesof ancient times. There are a number of surprises in store, for today’s scienceappears in many ways to be simply reiterating what has gone before. This is not,of course, what scientists themselves want to hear, and, as a blatanttrespasser, I would not expect them to give these ideas a warm reception.So, where do we begin such an apparently impossible journey across an infinityof time frames and even dimensions? It is probably best to start with our feetfirmly on the ground—on bedrock—in the land and time of Old Kingdom Egypt. Thereason is clear: because the pi convention first emerged here, both in thearchitecture and in written form."},{"pageContent":"1The Sacred ConstantThe “Jewel in the Crown”Although all ancient civilizations were special in their own way, Egypt was in aclass entirely of its own. To begin with, it was the first truly unified nationin history. It was also the longest-lived, spanning three thousand years fromunification to final dissolution. Its architecture is truly exceptional: inmagnitude, sophistication and precision, nowhere since has it been surpassed oreven equaled. Most importantly, it was in Egypt, at the very beginning of theera of the historical pharaohs, that the Hermetic Code first came to light. Thisis demonstrated not only through the pi relationship, which appears to have beenincorporated both in the architecture and in the administrative procedures ofthis culture, but also in its protracted and detailed mythology. The octaveformat inherent in the natural processes of creation was first expressed instories surrounding the miraculous appearance of the eight principal gods of theEgyptian pantheon.It was once pointed out to me that one of the earliest and most influential ofthe Egyptian creation myths portrayed a pantheon not of eight but of nine gods,known in the Old Kingdom as the Great Ennead. Clearly this rather awkward detailwas disconcertingly inconsistent with “my” musical theory. The obvious anomalypuzzled me at first, but on closer examination of the myth in question, I cameto realize that there was, in fact, no inconsistency whatever. More than that, Ifound that this imagery of a mythical group of nine not only embodied within itthe symbol of the octave, the primary ingredient of the Hermetic Code, but alsoan extremely subtle connection with another key component of this universalformula.The principal god of the Great Ennead, Atum, was said to have fertilized himselfto produce eight offspring. So we are already back on safe ground. Eight isgood. So is seven, of course, as expressed in the formula pi, the symbol of thetriple octave, the “trinity.” In general, the numbers 7 and 8, as they appear inmyth and religious tradition, each refer to the same concept, namely, the octaveand the musical symmetry inherent in all processes in nature. And the number 9?This also has definite musical connotations. If we substitute the “gods” of theGreat Ennead with the word octaves, the result is a musical composition of nineoctaves, comprising sixty-four fundamental notes. The Great Ennead, therefore,is simply a mythical expression of the formula pi, the triple octave, which isquite naturally subdivisible into nine inner octaves, sixty-four notes.Sixty-four is, of course, the square of eight. And the number 8, as I have said,is a constant number, one that consistently recurs in nature, in the geneticcode, in the spectrum composing white light, and in the natural harmonies of themajor musical scale. The Egyptians evidently recognized this musical symmetry,which is why they held the number 8 to be sacred—hence its association with thegods. Eight was thus regarded as a “sacred constant,” a yardstick by whicheverything could be measured or compared. Sixty-four, being the square of thisnumber, was therefore of supreme significance to the guardians of the Egyptianmysteries, representing the ultimate goal of the individual—the squaring ofone’s possibilities, the acquisition of godlike attributes. In “bioharmonic”terms we might call this the attainment within oneself of an optimum degree ofphysical and psychological “resonance,” an individual condition of absolutemetaphysical harmony. This is simply a higher state of consciousness, a level ofperception that empowers the individual to strike metaphysical or conceptual“notes” up in a greater “scale” above, which we call, for want of a better word,heaven.ORIGINSI have often speculated on the true age of this ancient wisdom. As far as my ownresearch has revealed, it seems initially to have appeared in its full-blownform in Egypt in the first half of the third millennium BCE. This by no meansproves, however, that the concept of the sacred constant actually originated inOld Kingdom Egypt.Even when starting to write The Infinite Harmony, I suspected that the canon ofwisdom to which I had tuned in could be much older than the existing recordsshow. Orthodox historians are reluctant to push back the beginning of Egyptiancivilization much further than the establishment of what is known as the ArchaicPeriod, which began around 3100 BCE, when Upper and Lower Egypt were firstunified under the rule of King Narmer and his successor, Hor-aha, or Menes.However, the Egyptian chronicler Manetho, a priest of the city of Heliopolisfrom the third century BCE, recorded a long, continuous succession of divine andsemidivine rulers of prehistoric Egypt stretching back 24,925 years beyond thebeginning of the Archaic Period.1 [26_note.html#fo1] An earlier, fragmenteddocument known as the Royal Canon of Turin and dated to around 1300 BCE containsa king list that begins with an unspecified period when Egypt was ruled by asuccession of ten gods, the Netjeru, followed by a second period of 13,420 yearsof divine rulers known as the “Followers of Horus.”2 [26_note.html#fo2]Obviously these reigns are given no credence by academics: the timescalesinvolved are simply too great to fit into any accepted historical format. But inmy view these records, though they might have become distorted with the passageof time, are highly significant, primarily because they reflect the views andtraditions of the Egyptians themselves. Clearly these people firmly believedthat their culture had its origins in a past reaching back many thousands ofyears before the Archaic Period.So which view is correct? Is it that of today’s archaeologists and historians,who rely principally on the evidence of datable artifacts to ascertain the ageof a culture? Or is it the account that has come down to us from the horse’smouth, so to speak, from the Egyptian priesthood of Manetho’s day and from thecompilers of the Royal Canon of Turin?It seems to me very unlikely that a culture as advanced and sophisticated asEgypt’s should have mushroomed “overnight” from a primitive intellectualenvironment. As we have noted, the Old Kingdom priests and astronomers werealready in possession of a fully developed, extraordinarily imaginative beliefsystem—a true science, no less—the main tenets of which they describedsymbolically and with superlative clarity in the form of the Hermetic Code. Whatis, perhaps, even more incredible is the obvious intent behind this essentiallyharmonious mode of spiritual evolution, which was to forge for mankind a directmeans of access to the stars, to the mythical realm of the gods that came to beknown as heaven. The important point to note here is that heaven— that place Ivainly looked for as a boy—is, in fact, a scientific concept employed by ancientmetaphysicians to describe a higher dimension of existence. We can define thisnetherworld in musical terms as a greater “scale” of being. This unique mode ofevolution is based, as I have said, on systematic scientific principles—those ofharmonics—but later we shall see that this theory of “transcendental evolution”is also scientific in other significant ways—specifically in relation to some ofthe benchmark discoveries of modern physics and genetics. But even if wepresently consider only the musical aspect of this theory, this is asurprisingly sophisticated concept to have originated with the relatively closedescendants of simple hunter-gatherers.In addition to this highly evolved “religion” of the Fourth Dynasty Egyptians,the stonemasons and architects of that unique era—particularly the builders ofthe Pyramids of Giza and Dashur—displayed incomparable expertise in precisionand enormity of scale.So history here belies logic: the finest, the most sophisticated, appeared veryearly on, and the standard of pyramid building degenerated as time went by. Thisis not, of course, what we observe in the ongoing development of our ownculture, particularly in technology and the sciences, which are generallyconsidered as having progressively evolved— primarily out of the supposedlysuperstitious ideas of medieval alchemy.Of course, if the Egyptians themselves are to be believed, quite the oppositeappears to have happened. According to them, their culture was not the productof a gradual development, but began in full bloom, with a first, golden era, adistant age when the “gods” suddenly appeared (presumably from somewhere),bringing with them all the trappings of civilized existence. This period intheir history the Egyptians called Zep Tepi, the “First Time.”From this golden age onward, there apparently proceeded a gradual process ofinvolution, through a long period of high civilization under the rule of lesserdemigods—the “Followers of Horus” earlier mentioned— ultimately ending with the“normal” era of the historical pharaohs. I use the term normal guardedly here,because the Great Pyramid was constructed at this time, and it is difficult toimagine that those responsible for the creation of this amazing structure werejust ordinary souls.On the face of things, it seems as if this ancient Egyptian scenario of adistant, perfect beginning is, by conventional standards, fantastic, totally atodds with the established academic view of events. Egyptologists tell us thatthe datable, factual evidence, painstakingly collated by scholars over the lastcouple of hundred years, proves conclusively that a mere one thousand yearsbefore Egypt’s Dynastic Period, the tribes in the Nile region were living insimple, mud-brick dwellings and thought about little other than survival.And then, one thousand years later—around 2550 BCE—historians present us withthe fully developed civilization we know as Old Kingdom Egypt, the most advancedof the ancient world, whose architects built like giants, and whose influenceupon the human race is felt even to this day. This crucial development, from thehunter-gatherer tending a few goats in the middle of the fourth millennium BCE,to the Egyptian priest-astronomer of the Old Kingdom, with their giganticpyramid markers and lofty thoughts of the firmament, is perhaps the mostdramatic leap forward ever encountered in human history.This sudden appearance of the high civilization exemplified by the architectureand the extant texts of Old Kingdom Egypt has prompted many alternativeinvestigators to challenge seriously the orthodox view of the sources ofEgyptian culture, positing a direct legacy from an earlier, greatly moreadvanced race of people.The evidence in support of this revolutionary proposition has in recent yearscome to us from all quarters, and doubtless most readers hooked on the mysterieswill already be familiar with most of it. Modern writers, such as Graham Hancockand Robert Bauval, Colin Wilson, Andrew Collins, and many more have done much toincrease public interest in “alternative” explanations of the origin ofcivilization. Many of the ideas discussed by these authors are of necessityhighly contentious and so are continually under attack from academics. However,even if we accept that some of these theories are, to coin an apt phrase, not“hermetically sealed”—not entirely watertight—there is now a whole swath ofsignificant new data that simply does not fit in with the orthodox picture ofevents. In short, it is now time for us to rewrite the standard, but apparentlygarbled, story of the development of civilization, for the period thathistorians have consistently referred to as “prehistory,” circa 10,500–4000 BCE,is that no more.Most of the new evidence to support this view of a highly advanced,proto-Egyptian culture has been variously dealt with by dozens of alternativetheorists, so we need not dwell too long on the details. A quick review of themain features will suffice to impress upon the reader how remarkably advancedthese denizens of “prehistory” really were. No doubt academic arguments over thetrue age of civilization will rage for years to come, but this is not my primaryconcern. The intention of this book is to proffer an alternative perspectivethat is not so much focused on the antiquity of our culture, but more on thenature and future ramifications of the unique belief system bequeathed to us byour most distant ancestors. But first let us examine certain key,well-established facts and see for ourselves exactly what these mysteriouspeople were capable of.“IMPOSSIBLE” MAPSIn 1966, the late Charles H. Hapgood, Professor of the History of Science atKeene College, New Hampshire, published a seminal work called Maps of theAncient Sea Kings. The title refers to certain medieval maritime maps currentlyfiled away in the American Library of Congress, which depict the exact contoursof the land mass buried deep beneath the mile-thick ice packs of Antarctica.Possibly the best known of these is the now famous Piri Re’is map of 1513, ownedby a Turkish pirate executed in 1554. This shows the southern Atlantic Ocean, apart of the coast of Africa to the right, the coast of South America to theleft, and, farther to the south, Antarctica, with the bays of Queen Maud Landshown in astonishingly clear relief. Note that these bays were not officially“discovered” until surveys using sonar soundings were conducted by a joint teamof British, Swedish, and Norwegian scientists in 1949. There are, in fact, manymore of these maps—called portolans—some of which show that Antarctica actuallyconsists of two separate land masses, a fact not known to modern geographersuntil further surveys were conducted in 1958.Hapgood’s explanation for the existence of these portolans remains controversialeven today. He surmised that they were probably copies of earlier maps, which inturn might have been copies of even older ones— and so on, effectively reachingback to a time when Antarctica was relatively free of ice. Controversial thisproposition may be, but Hapgood’s observations were based on solid factualevidence that has never been refuted or otherwise explained by the academicestablishment.The obvious implication of all this is that there may have been highlyproficient mariners alive then—when Antarctica was a more temperate land—withthe wherewithal to chart it. But of course mapmaking of the accuracy found inmany portolans is a highly exacting science and implies a detailed knowledge oftrigonometry and geometry—hardly the skills we would normally ascribe to“primitive” peoples.Geologists and climatologists tell us that the latest possible date thatAntarctica could have been a temperate region—and therefore topographicallysurveyed by ancient seafarers—was around 4000 BCE. If we assume, then, that thisprehistoric civilization of accomplished mapmakers and mathematiciansprogressively evolved, as we have, through long periods of trial and error andspasmodic bouts of inspirational genius, then the conservative date of 4000 BCEwould merely mark a turning point in the development of a culture that hadalready reached a marked stage of maturity. How long it took to attain such alevel of sophistication is anybody’s guess, but if historians are ever to makesense of the evidence provided by portolans, this is certainly a question thatneeds to be addressed. Where these ancient seafarers went after Antarcticafinally became covered with ice is also crying out for an answer. After all,they must have gone somewhere, because they had boats and were obviouslyinclined to use them. It is perhaps significant that the time frame underdiscussion comfortably encompasses the beginning of the Archaic Period ofancient Egypt. And the early Egyptians, in fact, also had boats. Khufu’s father,Snefru, had a fleet of them, and they were identical in design to reed boatsstill being built today by the South American Indians living on the shores ofLake Titicaca in Bolivia. Local Indians informed Graham Hancock that the designhad been given to them by the legendary Viracocha, the white god from the seawho, like Osiris in Egypt, brought with him civilization and a new way of being.In 1954 a rectangular pit was discovered on the south side of the Great Pyramidthat contained a dismantled boat made of cedar. It took fourteen years toreassemble this craft, which measures 43 meters from prow to stern.According to the sailor and explorer Thor Heyerdahl, the streamlined hull ofthis boat could never have withstood the conditions of the high seas. It wasbuilt, in his opinion, as a symbolic craft for the use of the pharaoh in hisafterlife. This acknowledged expert in the field of ancient shipbuildingbelieves that the boat was essentially a riverboat. Curiously, however, he alsoasserts that its high-prowed design was a highly sophisticated and technicallyaccurate model, not of a riverboat, but of an ocean-going vessel. Heyerdahl issuggesting that Khufu’s ceremonial boat could have been derived from the plansof very experienced shipbuilders, people with a long tradition of sailing on theopen seas.3 [26_note.html#fo3]It is tempting to think that this is the answer, that the Egyptian and, perhaps,the early American civilizations, whose descendants are still making boats of anidentical design today, might have been spawned by descendants of thislong-forgotten race of mariners of ancient Antarctica—say, around the middle ofthe fourth millennium BCE.The emerging historical picture, however, is not quite that simple.THE GEOLOGICAL EVIDENCELet us now look briefly at the latest controversy surrounding the dating of theGreat Sphinx and its two neighboring constructions on the Giza plateau, theextraordinary buildings known today as the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple.In 1979, the American writer John Anthony West published a book, Serpent in theSky, in which he discusses the ideas of the maverick Alsatian Egyptologist, RenéSchwaller de Lubicz. Schwaller, who spent almost fifteen years between the warsinvestigating numerous archaeological sites in Egypt, noted marked differencesbetween the erosion of the Sphinx enclosure and that of the nearby tombs andpyramids on the Giza plateau. The weathering pattern on the exterior surfaces ofthe tombs and pyramids is angular and irregular, with rock layers higher up inthe masonry showing less weathering than the layers below. This angular erosionis attributed to the effects of wind-blown sands blasting away the softer layersof limestone and leaving exposed the harder levels. The weathering of the Sphinxand on the outer walls of the two neighboring temples, however, is rounded,undulating, sloping slightly outward toward the ground, with deep, intermittent,vertical fissures or gullies. Schwaller’s explanation for this is that theerosion of the Sphinx and its surrounding structures has been caused not bysandblasts, but by water. This clearly suggests that they must have originatedin a different and quite distinct era—when water other than that of the RiverNile abounded.West’s book subsequently achieved only a moderate success. One can perhapsunderstand why: it certainly had no chance of being officially endorsed, and thepresent “Egyptian renaissance” had not yet begun to flower. Undeterred, West,convinced that the weathering pattern of the Sphinx provided a vital clue to ourunderstanding of “prehistory,” has spent the last twenty years steadily chippingaway at another crumbling edifice—the orthodox opposition to Schwaller’s theory.The turning point in this modern David and Goliath story came when West invitedan expert to examine the Sphinx erosion and try to ascertain what had caused it.Significantly, this expert was not an Egyptologist, but a scientist, a leadingauthority on the structure and nature of rocks.This was the eminent Boston geologist Dr. Robert Schoch, whose studied opinion,based on exhaustive investigations at the site, is that the erosion is indeedthe result of water—rainwater, to be precise. Schoch presented his findings atthe annual convention of the Geological Society of America in 1992, and hisevidence and conclusions were received with marked approval. The assumption is,therefore, that the weathering of the Sphinx enclosure has most likely beenproduced by precipitation. As with the case of the portolans mentionedpreviously, orthodox historians may have another serious question to addresshere, because it has now been fairly well established that Egypt ceased to be atemperate zone nine thousand years ago—around 7000 BCE—over three and a halfthousand years before the beginning of the Dynastic Period. Significantly, thisties in rather well with Schoch’s estimate for the age of the Sphinx, which heputs conservatively at nine thousand years. If he is off by only a thousandyears or so, and the Sphinx was indeed drenched by rain in a temperate climatefor a thousand years or more, this could arguably account for the erosionobserved by geologists.Historians and archaeologists of the old school, however, have reactednegatively to this radical view, insisting that the Sphinx is contemporary withthe Dynastic Period. They claim that it was commissioned by, and is an image of,the pharaoh Khafre (Greek, Chephren), builder of the second of the threePyramids at Giza. An undamaged statue of Khafre was found in the Valley Temple,and the American archaeologist Mark Lehner, leading the academic opposition toWest’s and Schoch’s theories, declared that the similarities between it and theface of the Sphinx proved conclusively that the Sphinx was an image of Khafre.West totally disagreed; in fact, he could see no similarity whatsoever. Andneither could leading New York forensic artist Detective Frank Domingo when, atWest’s behest, he went to Egypt to check out the validity of Lehner’s claims.After a close, professional examination of all the available evidence, Domingo’sverdict was emphatic: the Great Sphinx is definitely not an image of the FourthDynasty pharaoh Khafre. Indeed, if the geologists have it right, how could itpossibly be?If the orthodox view of an evolving culture is correct, we might reasonablyassume that the people responsible for such marvelous feats of constructionwould have had a good deal of practice before they mastered their formidableskills. Therefore if we are considering here a civilization dating back to atime when the Sahara was green, there may be a great deal more evidence of ityet to uncover—a hidden empire under the sand.MEGALITHIC LEGOThere is also another anomaly intrinsic to the Sphinx enclosure, which againthrows the orthodox view into question: the incredible size of the stone blocksused in its construction. Weighing at least 200 tons apiece, with some of themtipping the scale at a staggering 450 tons, these enormous blocks—hundreds ofthem—have been superimposed with a degree of precision that makes the mindboggle. The point is that these massive, austere, and predominantly rectangularconstructions—the so-called Valley Temple of Khafre and the Sphinx Temple—areentirely uncharacteristic of the architecture of the Old Kingdom Pyramids andtombs—the latter incorporating elaborate carvings, inscriptions, cylindricalfluted columns, and numerous other architectural features typical of that era.One possible reason for this anomaly, as a number of investigators have ofcourse already suggested, is that the Sphinx enclosure and the nearby pyramidsand tombs of Giza originated in two quite distinct and widely separated timeframes.Take the Great Pyramid, for example, possibly the finest and most completeexample of stonemasonry in existence, constructed mainly out of standard blocksof limestone averaging around two to three tons in weight. Even the most massiveof its granite blocks, incorporated in what is now commonly known as the King’sChamber, would probably weigh in at “only” around seventy tons.Now consider this: the average weight of the carved stones used in the buildingof the Sphinx and Valley Temples at Giza is two hundred tons. Of course, theseblocks have been carved from much softer limestone bedrock but, by Old Kingdomstandards, they are truly cyclopean. What is more, their joints are so fine thatit is impossible to slide a razor-thin blade between them. Even by modernstandards, they are nigh on perfect.In Abydos, in Upper, or Southern, Egypt, there is another ancient structure, atemple known as the Osireion, which has the same stark, megalithic form ofarchitecture as the buildings of the Sphinx enclosure. Professor EdouardNaville, sponsored by the Egypt Exploration Fund, excavated much of the sitebetween 1912 and 1914, and when he observed the unique style of architecture ofthe structure, he straightaway compared it with the Valley Temple at Giza. Bothwere made with gigantic blocks without any ornament but, as Naville noted, theOsireion, though of a similar style, was made with even larger blocks, a factthat, rather curiously, prompted him to suggest that it was “of a still morearchaic character.”4 [26_note.html#fo4] Is it not strange that he should haveassociated antiquity with size in this way? He was saying, in effect, that thelarger the blocks—and, consequently, the more advanced the engineeringtechniques required to carve, transport, and position them—the greater theantiquity of the building. Naville suggested, in fact, that the Osireion mightbe the most ancient building in Egypt. This is, of course, a decidedlyunorthodox view, but one that accords with that of the Egyptians themselves,with their belief that their civilization began with a godlike race of beingswho possessed supernatural powers, in other words extraordinary skills.Later excavations by Henry Frankfurt at the site in Abydos, between 1925 and1930, unearthed a cartouche of the Nineteenth Dynasty pharaoh Seti I carved ingranite above the entrance into the main hall of the temple. Not surprisingly,this and other minor finds linking Seti with the site prompted thearchaeological community to disregard Naville’s earlier conclusions, opting forthe much more palatable idea that the building dated back to an establishedperiod in known history. There is now, however, a growing number ofinvestigators in the field who are inclining more and more toward Naville’sview. The writer Andrew Collins, in his book Gods of Eden, has suggested thatSeti, having recognized the unquestionable sanctity of this important edifice,may have constructed his own temple at Abydos “to comply with the existingorientation and ground-plan of the Osireion, which was already of immenseantiquity even in his own age.”5 [26_note.html#fo5] This makes perfect sense.And, after all, why should Seti, of all of the pharaohs to have ruled in anydynasty since the Fourth (the supposed era of construction of the ValleyTemple), be the only one to have built with blocks of such size?In respect of megalithic architecture, it is worth noting here that the ValleyTemple and the Osireion, while unique in Egypt, do, in fact, have counterpartselsewhere in important archaeological sites worldwide, notably in the Lebanon,Bolivia, Peru, and Mexico. In his book Fingerprints of the Gods (1995), GrahamHancock describes the aweinspiring remains of buildings all over the ancientworld that have been constructed from massive stone blocks weighing severalhundred tons apiece—again, as with the blocks incorporated in the Sphinx Templeand the Osireion, featuring joints of near-perfect precision.Furthermore, in Mexico, as in Egypt, the pyramid structure is a central feature.Most significantly, in the case of the Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacán inMexico, we even find the crucial pi relationship incorporated within itsdimensions. This and other “hermetic” buildings will be revisited in due course.THE ASTRO-ARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVEThe fact that the Sphinx has the body of a lion has prompted certaininvestigative authors to suggest that it was very likely carved in the Age ofLeo, some time between 11,380 and 9220 BCE.To understand the basis of this new argument, we first have to consider thephenomenon of precession, which is the apparent backward motion of the twelveconstellations of the zodiac in relation to the horizon. Precession occursbecause the earth is spinning like a giant top that is losing momentum and hasbegun to turn and wobble very slowly—almost imperceptibly so—in the directionopposite to its spin. This alternative motion gives observers on earth theillusory impression that the “fixed” stars of the firmament are revolving slowlyaround us like a giant stellar wheel. The rate of precession is measured byobserving the gradually changing zodiacal backdrop against which the sun riseson the spring equinox. Proceeding at the rate of one degree every seventy-twoyears, this means that each of the twelve ages of the zodiac occupies 30 degreesof this great astronomical circle, taking 2,160 years to complete. A wholeprecessional cycle therefore lasts 25,920 years.In our present astrological age, the equinoctial rising of the sun still occursin Pisces, the symbol of Christianity. As Andrew Collins points out in Gods ofEden, just before this age the equinoctial sunrise occurred against the backdropof Aries, the sign of the ram, which is historically associated with the reignof the Hebrew Scriptures patriarch, Abraham, and also with the ram cult of Amunin ancient Egypt, both of which appeared shortly after this age began, around2200 BCE. The latter stages of the age before this, the Age of Taurus, the timeof the bull cult of the Mediterranean and the Apis cult of Egypt, is the epochin which Egyptologists say the leonine Sphinx was carved. To Collins, and indeedto many other current investigators, placing the lion squarely in the bull’sdomain makes no sense at all. The “alternative” view, of course, offers a muchmore logical explanation: the Sphinx has the body of a lion because it wascarved and orientated in the Age of Leo.The new evidence in favor of this hypothesis is concerned primarily with certainstellar alignments that appear to have been intentionally built into the Gizanecropolis. As we might expect, the authors engaged in this new field of enquiryare consistently under attack from traditional Egyptologists, recognized expertsin their own field, of course, but scholars who generally know little or nothingabout astronomy. Consequently the Leo hypothesis is seen as simply another cranktheory being purveyed by ill-informed amateurs.Possibly one of the best-known names in this new area of “astroarchaeology” isthe Belgian construction engineer Robert Bauval. His first book, The OrionMystery, co-authored with the writer and publisher Adrian Gilbert, is basedaround his discovery of an evident alignment of the Giza necropolis with certainkey stars in the Egyptian sky, stars that, significantly, were of very specialinterest to the priest-astronomers of the Old Kingdom.Bauval noted the curious misalignment and marked difference in size of the muchsmaller third Pyramid of Menkaura (Mycerinus), and wondered why this should be.He subsequently realized that this peculiar anomaly corresponded accurately witha similar “misalignment” evident in the positions of the three stars of Orion’sBelt, called by astronomers Zeta Orionis, Epsilon, and Delta. The smallest ofthis triad—Delta—is slightly offset from the line described by the first two.Significantly, it is also noticeably dimmer, apparently smaller.As Bauval already knew from his exhaustive examinations of many of the so-calledPyramid Texts, the constellation of Orion was extremely important in themythology and religion of the ancient Egyptians. It was associated with theirprincipal god, the great civilizer, Osiris, Lord of Zep Tepi, the “First Time,”the golden epoch when Thoth/Hermes is said to have imparted to mankind thefruits of his infinite wisdom. Orion, therefore, is clearly a key to the enigmaof the Pyramids.Bauval realized further that the Great Pyramid itself has certain internalfeatures that link it directly not only with Orion, the star of Osiris, but alsoto another equally important star—Sirius—that associated with Osiris’s consort,the goddess Isis. Sirius’s heliacal rising (i.e., the same time as the sun) wasin fact the basis of the Egyptian “sothic” calendar. The link between Orion,Sirius, and the Great Pyramid is to be found in two of the four mysteriousshafts projecting from the so-called King’s and Queen’s Chambers. Usingcomputer-simulated star charts to reproduce the position of the stars above theNile Delta around 2500 BCE, the time when the Pyramids were built, Bauvalestablished that each of the shafts would then have targeted particular stars asthey culminated at the meridian, that is, as they reached their highest pointabove the horizon. The crucial ones turned out to be the southern shafts. Thatof the King’s Chamber, angled at 45 degrees 14 minutes, would have targeted thestar known to the Egyptians as Al Nitak, Zeta Orionis, the lowest of the threestars of Orion’s Belt. Similarly the southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber,angled at 39 degrees 30 minutes, would have aligned with the high point ofSirius, or Alpha Canis Major, in the constellation of the Great Dog.During the course of the precession of the equinoxes, Orion’s Belt moves throughthe heavens in a specific and unchanging way. It rises upward for almostthirteen thousand years, tilting slightly in a clockwise motion, and then backagain, drifting slowly down and turning anticlockwise as it returns to itsstarting point. To Bauval, this starting point was highly significant, for hiscomputer star charts told him that the last time Orion was at its lowest pointin the sky was circa 10,450 BCE, in the Age of Leo.Bauval further noted that at this point in the precessional cycle the threestars of Orion’s Belt would not have been tilted sideways, and so would thenhave perfectly reflected the position and orientation of the three Pyramids ofGiza. He surmised that the Giza site in fact acted like a giant star-clockmarking the epoch of the First Time, the golden age of Osiris/Orion.In a later book, Keeper of Genesis (1997), jointly written by Bauval and GrahamHancock, the astro-archaeological theory is explored further. They suggest thatthe designers of the Giza complex saw the River Nile itself as a reflection ofthe diffused band of light of the Milky Way—our own galaxy. The leonine Sphinxfaces due east. Had it been there, as Bauval and Hancock imply, at dawn on theall-important spring equinox in the year 10,450 BCE—the beginning of the presentprecessional cycle—the constellation of Leo would have appeared above thehorizon directly in front of it. Understandably, they see this as compellingevidence that the Sphinx enclosure—which the geologist Robert Schoch believes ismuch older than the nearby tombs—was built to align with the constellation ofthe precessional age in which it was carved and constructed. At that time,Orion’s Belt itself would have been positioned in the southern sky, at rightangles to Leo, and at its lowest point of declination. What is intriguing is theidea that the builders of Old Kingdom Egypt, working in the later Age of Taurus,may have built and aligned their three mighty pyramids to reflect perfectly theposition of the three stars of Orion’s Belt as they would have appeared in theskies in the Age of Leo. It’s as if the designers may have been focusing back onthis age for a specific purpose, possibly to mark it as an important era intheir history, when Orion was closest to home and when Leo appeared in the skyexactly in line with the Sphinx’s present gaze. Orion has been rising in the skyever since, and will continue to do so until around the year 2550 CE, thusmarking the first half of the full precessional cycle, thirteen thousand yearsafter the First Time.Clearly the earth–stellar configuration being described here, although not yetaccepted by academics, has much merit. It is, after all, based on verifiablefacts, data that Egyptologists, if they are sincere, simply cannot afford toignore. The point is that these ancient, highly accomplished constructionengineers of Old Kingdom Egypt were also experienced astronomers, people deeplyconcerned with the movement of the heavens, and they apparently knew aboutprecession. This obviously begs the question, How did they obtain thisknowledge? If we assume through a vigilant observation of the heavens, then itmust also be accepted that these observations must have continued uninterruptedfor a considerable period of time. It takes seventy-two years—a goodlifetime—for the zodiacal wheel to move just one degree of arc. So let’s saythat, somewhere and at some time in the remote past, one rather shrewdindividual happened to notice a very slight change in the position of aparticular favored star. Fortuitously, he or she then passes this information onto a son or a daughter, or to a group of followers, who subsequently continue toobserve the same star. For how long would this observation have to continuebefore it was realized by someone in the chain that their favorite star had ahigh point and a low point in its movement through the heavens? Moreimportantly, how long would it be before someone could work out the last timethe given star was at its lowest point of declination in a great astronomicalcycle spanning almost twenty-six thousand years?So, how old is “civilization”?In fact, evidence of knowledge of precession in ancient times comes from manyquarters, and is not exclusive to the Egyptians. It was mysteriously encoded inthe different mythologies of peoples from all over the world. This was firstnoted by the scientific historian Giorgio de Santillana and the anthropologistHertha von Dechend, in their complex and challenging book Hamlet’s Mill (1960).Put simply, what de Santillana and von Dechend discovered was that certainnumbers—derivatives of the great precessional cycle of 25,920 years—cropped upagain and again in myths and legends from cultures all around the world. As withthe numbers associated with the laws of harmony and the structure of the octave,they appear to be deeply rooted in mankind’s race-memory. The numbers are allbased on the 360-degree precessional wheel (“Hamlet’s Mill”) and the numbers ofyears occupied by the twelve zodiacal ages. As we noted, one degree occupiesseventy-two years, which is one of the key numbers in the series. Further, one“age,” one-twelfth part, or a 30-degree segment of the wheel, occupies a periodof 2,160 years—two more key numbers. If we double these we get two more: 60degrees and 4,320 years—and so on.The fact that these same numbers occur in so many diverse myths and legends notonly indicates that ancient peoples were aware of precession, but also that themyths themselves very probably have a common origin. Such beginnings, however,reach back to a time too remote for us to identify precisely. Perhaps the mythsoriginated with the legendary Egyptian harbingers of wisdom, Osiris and hisgrand vizier, Thoth. Certainly precessional numbers appear in many of the mythssurrounding these “gods” of the First Time. Then again, possibly this knowledgehad its source with the race of ancient mariners responsible for mappingAntarctica way back when the continent was free of ice. As experiencednavigators, these people would presumably have developed an acute awareness ofthe gradually changing star patterns of the night sky. Perhaps Osiris and hiscompanions were actually connected with, or were either descendants or ancestorsof, this prehistoric brotherhood of mapmaking mathematicians and geometers.Alternatively it may be that the true origin of the knowledge of precessiondates back to a time more remote than anyone has hitherto imagined.Certainly observation of the sun, moon, and stars is one of man’s oldestpastimes. We see evidence of this in the alignments of many ancient sites, notjust in Egypt, but all over the world, in Western Europe’s ancient stonecircles, the citadels and plains of South America and in the temples andpyramids of present-day Mexico and Guatemala. Furthermore, as Colin Wilson andRand Flem-Ath have noted in their book The Atlantis Blueprint, it is evidentthat very many of these sites were not simply selected at random, but werechosen to conform to an overall global pattern of longitudinal and latitudinalcoordinates. That is, from sacred centers in Egypt and the Americas, to remotePacific Islands, through ancient Greece and the Middle East and Tibet, there hasemerged a clear pattern of whole-number coordinates linking many of them.6[26_note.html#fo6] Obviously these sites are not all contemporary with oneanother, ranging in age, according to orthodox chronology, from one to fivethousand years. However, given that some of these important centers of cultureare extremely ancient, it is possible that the original geophysical ormetrological plan was mapped out in the very early days, when civilization wassupposedly in its infancy.What I believe is unfolding here, in the light of all the recent research into“prehistory,” is a picture of an ancient people who, whatever the precise agethey might have lived in, were almost totally preoccupied with the idea ofharmony and order. As we have noted, this way of seeing the world reached itspeak in the civilization of the ancient Egyptians, who were so evidentlyconcerned with the order and movement of the cosmos. They were also, accordingto the metrologist Livio Stechini, highly skilled in the measurement of theearth and were able to define the extent of their country in relationship to thelatitude and longitude of the planet.7 [26_note.html#fo7] (According to CharlesPiazzi Smyth, the noted nineteenth-century Astronomer Royal of Scotland, theGreat Pyramid stands at the exact center of the largest landmass on earth.)Moreover, Stechini has calculated that the base perimeter of the GreatPyramid—921.453 meters—is exactly equal to half a minute of latitude at theequator, so the perimeter is equal to 1/43,200 of the circumference of theearth. This fact has a twofold significance: first, it demonstrates howremarkably knowledgeable these people were about their planet, and second, giventhat 4,320 is a precessional number, they may have realized also that thereexists an intimate, symmetrical connection between the earth and the zodiacalwheel.But the rise of the Egyptian civilization of the Old Kingdom, as we have noted,marked a time when people probably already knew about the immensely long cycleof precession. They knew about longitude and latitude, shipbuilding andnavigating, and techniques of building with giant blocks of hewn stone that evento the present day have not been adequately explained. Most importantly, theywere also familiar with pi and, of course, the Hermetic Code, which we now knowis a virtual blueprint of the genetic code, the code of life itself.So once again, if we allow a reasonable period for the natural accumulation ofall this sophisticated knowledge, we have a clear indication of anextraordinarily advanced civilization existing in the period historians callprehistory, say, between 10,000 and 4000 BCE, or possibly long before.How long exactly?As I said previously, it is not my intention here to try to prove that civilizedhominid culture is ten or even one hundred thousand years old. In trying toascertain where the Hermetic Code originated, however, we must delve very deeplyinto our past: there is, in fact, datable archaeological evidence to suggestthat the most fundamental component of the Hermetic Code—the sacred constant, orthe unit of the octave—was “sacred” even in the time of Neanderthal manseventy-five thousand years ago.In his book Cities of Dreams (1989), a highly original study of Neanderthalculture, the psychologist and philosopher Stan Gooch describes a remarkable findat Drachenloch in the Swiss Alps, a known Neanderthal bear-hunter site: inside acave an altar was discovered. It consisted of a rectangular stone-built chestcapped with a great stone slab in which had been placed seven bear skulls withtheir muzzles pointing toward the entrance of the cave. Six more skulls werediscovered set in niches in the cave wall behind the altar.Gooch sees this as a clear indication that the numbers 7 and 13 (7 plus 6) weresacred to the Neanderthal. He notes also that the constellation of the GreatBear contains seven stars, a fact that prompts him to make this rather bold andstartling statement: “We can hardly doubt that Neanderthal had already given itthis name that almost unimaginable time ago. And so, in our own times, it isstill called the Great Bear by ourselves, by the ancient Greeks, by the Romans,the Hindus, the Ainu, the North American Indians, tribes in Africa, and manyothers besides.”8 [26_note.html#fo8]If Gooch is correct in assuming that this 75,000-year-old altar wasintentionally associated with a particular constellation in the sky—that of theGreat Bear—then we already have here the beginnings of the science of astronomy.Scholars may argue that there is no real proof that these seven bear skulls,carefully placed in this ceremonial stone chest at a time when the last greatice age was literally raging full-blast outside, were associated in any way withthe seven stars of the Great Bear. Surely the cavemen responsible for thisirritating anomaly were just adorning their lair and toying unwittingly with arandom number—in this case 7. However, as Gooch convincingly demonstrates inchapter 10 [18_chapter10.html] of his book, these people were already extremelyinterested in the heavens and were, in fact, capable of calculating theperiodicity of the planets and the long-term cycles of the moon.9[26_note.html#fo9] Remember also that astronomy is in fact one of the mostancient sciences known, and that a detailed knowledge of the 26,000-year cycleof precession is hinted at in mankind’s oldest myths. It may be, therefore, thatthe practice of observation and identification of prominent stars in theever-changing firmament reaches back in a continuous line to Neanderthal times.After all, only two precessional cycles ago it was the Neanderthal, not theCro-Magnon race (modern man), who was the dominant hominid species on earth.And the number 7? According to Gooch, the Neanderthals actually identified threesacred numbers: 3, 7, and 13. Significantly, two of these—3 and 7—arefundamental components of the Hermetic Code; that is, taken together, they arean elementary expression of the pi relationship. With regard to the number 13 itis, perhaps, worth noting that all of the world’s traditional musical scales arefounded on the pentatonic scale and the so-called circle of fifths. A fifth isan “overtone” and is produced by touching a vibrating string lightly atone-fifth its length. The ancient Chinese found that a series of “perfectfifths” will produce twelve separate notes before the notes begin repeating. Setdown in pitch series, these twelve separate notes include all the semitones ofour westernized octave. The thirteenth note, seven octaves higher, is the sameas the first.Is this merely coincidence? Of course, it could be. But I am offering analternative hypothesis, based wholly on hermetic/genetic principles, which isthat the emergence of these specific numbers in the cultural practices of ourhominid predecessors, numbers that so closely reflect the musical symmetry ofDNA and the genetic code, may have been a perfectly natural adaptation acted outalmost instinctively by perfectly natural people.It should now be clear, from the evidence discussed so far, that the story ofour origins is by no means clear-cut. There are simply too many anomalies in theprevailing picture of events, awkward “facts” that consistently fly in the faceof the orthodox view of the evolution of civilization.We have, for example, the “impossible” medieval maps—portolans— copies of copieswhich were arguably made many thousands of years ago, possibly before 4000 BCE,by people with a workable knowledge of geometry and trigonometry.Then there is the weathering of the Sphinx and its related structures, quitedifferent from the exterior erosion patterns of the Fourth Dynasty pyramids andtombs, which suggests a greater age for the Sphinx than historians willcurrently permit. Robert Schoch’s proposal, supported by other geologists, isthat the erosion has been caused by heavy rainfall. But very little rain hasfallen on Egypt in the last nine thousand years—hence the desert we see today.This obviously raises serious questions in respect of the present dating of theSphinx and its enclosure, which, archaeologists tell us, was created in theFourth Dynasty, at a time when Egypt had for many thousands of years beenengulfed by desert sands.The incomparable size of the stone blocks used in some of Egypt’s most ancientstructures is also hard to explain. There are no intermediaries in terms ofsize, no other earlier structures of any significance whose form might indicatesome kind of gradual, evolutionary development leading to the use of suchincredibly huge stone blocks. Another puzzle is the remarkably accuratemetrological data encoded in the dimensions of the Great Pyramid, data thatindicates that its designers possessed an intimate knowledge of the dimensionsof the earth. The fact that Giza, along with dozens of other sacred sitesscattered worldwide, is positioned on a giant grid of whole-number latitudinalcoordinates, suggests that this knowledge was not exclusive to the designers ofthe Great Pyramid.Further, the very detailed and extremely plausible astro-archaeological evidencehighlighted by Bauval and Hancock, among others, points to an era in time forthe carving of the Sphinx that is too remote for historians even to consider.And yet the evidence speaks for itself. Giza displays so manyastroarchaeological features that it is hard to believe they might all be purelycoincidental. Further, the inclusion of precessional numbers in ancient mythsand legends from all over the world is a clear indication that the science ofstudying and mapping the heavens was fully developed at a time when theinhabitants of pre-dynastic Egypt supposedly hadn’t even begun to domesticateplants and animals.Finally, and in my view most importantly, we have the evidence of the HermeticCode, an encoded expression of the two fundamental laws of creation that,sometime around 2500 BCE, appears to have suddenly flowered into a complete,highly articulated belief system. On the other hand, if we accept that thenumbers 3, 7 and 13, sacred to the star-gazing Neanderthal, taken togetherconstitute an elementary expression of the pi symmetry, we can envisage a longand winding trail of intuitive and scientific discovery stretching back at leastseventy-five thousand years.By now the reader might appreciate how remarkably talented were these earlyancestors of ours. Of course, strictly speaking, this is the “alternative” view.Egyptologists, by and large, officially accept none of the theories I havementioned here. Indeed, many of them still maintain that the Great Pyramid wasbuilt solely as a tomb for the megalomaniac King Khufu.In spite of this intransigent orthodox opposition, however, the alternativeconcept of an extremely ancient lost civilization is fast gaining ground. Thishas resulted, not surprisingly, perhaps, in a renewed interest in the writingsof the Greek philosopher Plato, and in particular his story of the greatcatastrophe that destroyed a high civilization known as Atlantis in 9600 BCE. AsI write, I know of three forthcoming books by investigative authors that will bedealing with this enduring historical enigma in some detail. Doubtless they willbe met with the usual scholarly objections, but these detailed investigations,which have been briefly outlined by the authors concerned in recent lectures inthe UK, will certainly pose more challenges to the standard view of history.Just on the basis of the current evidence, there is a scenario suggesting thatthe advanced knowledge we usually see as marking the beginning of recordedhistory by no means represents the dawning of scientific activity, but ratherthe last vestiges of the science of a prior great and hitherto unidentifiedculture.Plato’s dialogue on Atlantis, though, is officially just a story, a “fairy tale”concocted by this overworked Greek sage as a form of relaxation, a means ofescaping the rigors of disciplined academic life. That may be the case, and theexistence or otherwise of Atlantis is not here my primary concern. It is enoughto know that the ancient Egyptians of the Fourth Dynasty were scientists of thefirst order. After all it was here, on the banks of the ancient Nile, that thenumerous branches of the knowledge acquired in “prehistory” were subsequentlydrawn together in a vast intellectual exercise. And what a truly awe-inspiringenterprise this was, combining precessional astronomy, geodetics and metrology,surveying and architecture, a complete understanding of the scientific laws ofcreation and, incredibly, a method of applying these laws as a way of being, a“religion.” It is difficult to imagine how much more in tune with the world andwith nature anyone could possibly be. These people were in tune with virtuallyeverything, with the patterns in the skies, the symmetries on the earth, and,most importantly, the rhythm of life itself.It seems to me, therefore, that one of the most rewarding lines of inquiry is totry to find out what made these great megalithic builders tick.Let’s investigate."},{"pageContent":"2A Different Way of SeeingOf the many recently published books investigating our cultural origins, thereis one that is of particular interest with respect to the ideas beinginvestigated here. This is Colin Wilson’s From Atlantis to the Sphinx (1996),described by its publishers as an attempt to understand how the long-forgottenrace of mariners and builders of prehistory “thought, felt, and communicatedwith the universe.” This position does, of course, presuppose that there wasonce a race of people existing in the so-called Neolithic era who were capableof contemplating the mysteries of nature and the universe.Wilson begins with the ideas of Schwaller de Lubicz, which are detailed in abook called Al-Kemi, written by an American artist called André VandenBroeck, aformer friend and pupil of Schwaller. VandenBroeck says that Schwaller believedthe ancient Egyptians and their predecessors had a knowledge system that wouldbe unrecognizable by modern man, a different way of looking at things that gavethem a unified perspective on the universe and human existence. This ancientsystem of knowledge, according to Schwaller, provided a “method of acceleratingthe pace of evolution.”1 [26_note.html#fo21]No details of this method are given, presumably because Schwaller didn’t haveany. But it nevertheless struck a resonant chord in Wilson’s mind, because thepossibility of speeding up the evolutionary processes, particularly thoseinvolved in the structure and development of consciousness, has, as he says,been the underlying theme of all his own work.Significantly, Wilson has also written several pieces on the life and works ofGurdjieff, notably in his highly acclaimed first book The Outsider (1957), andin his encyclopedic classic The Occult (1973). In a later book, The War AgainstSleep (1980), he describes Gurdjieff’s “system” as “probably the greatestsingle-handed attempt in the history of human thought to make us aware of thepotential of human consciousness.”2 [26_note.html#fo22] The “sleep” referred toin the title is what both Wilson and Gurdjieff would describe as normalconsciousness. This is the kind that sees most of us through every normal day, akind of low-resonance state of awareness that, at its lowest level, keeps usfrom bumping into furniture, jumping red lights, or murdering one anotherwholesale, and, at its peak, enables us to rationalize, to be logical, and soon. And, of course, it doesn’t always work.But what Gurdjieff, Schwaller, and Wilson all say is that there are other,higher states of consciousness that can be reached, and which were somehowattained by such as the ancient Egyptians. Wilson says as much in hisintroduction to From Atlantis to the Sphinx: that in his view the Egyptiansunderstood “some secret of cosmic harmony and its precise vibrations, whichenabled them to feel an integral part of the world and nature.”3[26_note.html#fo23]Drawing on an idea first presented by Robert Graves in his book The WhiteGoddess, Wilson suggests that there are two fundamental kinds of knowledge—whatGraves referred to as solar and lunar. Our modern type of knowledge, he says, isrational, solar, and works with words and concepts, fragmenting and dissectingeverything by analysis. By contrast, the knowledge system of ancientcivilizations Graves saw as lunar, or a form of perception based on intuition,which somehow grasped things as a whole.As an illustration of this latter form of perception, Wilson quotes a passagefrom Ouspensky’s book In Search of the Miraculous, in which Gurdjieff explainsto his pupils what he sees as the distinction between “real art” and “subjectiveart.” According to Gurdjieff, a subjective work of art is merely a random,arbitrary creation, usually conveying very different impressions to differentpeople. Real art, on the other hand, is as objective as any systematic scienceand invariably creates the same impression in everyone who understands the basicprinciples of objective expression, or art imbued with real meaning. Gurdjieffsaid the Sphinx was an example of real art, and that he had seen many others onhis wanderings across Asia. No doubt the Great Pyramid would also have beenincluded among these examples, although, rather curiously, he makes littlemention of it in his own writings. The point is, both the Sphinx and the GreatPyramid do, in fact, arouse the very same basic response in everyone, persistinginto our times in the form of an acute sensation of awe and wonder.In his lesson, Gurdjieff mentions one particular and rather mysterious work of“objective art,” a certain strange statue he and his fellow travellersencountered in the desert at the foot of the Hindu Kush mountains inAfghanistan. At first, they all thought it was simply an ancient depiction of agod or devil. But after a while he and his companions began to feel that thiswas no ordinary figure, and that its composition was in fact extremely intricateand revealing in its design and structure. Gurdjieff said that they graduallycame to realize that there was in fact a complex system of cosmology embodied inthis figure, in its legs, in its arms, in its head—everywhere. In the wholestatue, he said, there was nothing accidental, no feature without meaning.Subsequently this sudden awareness of the statue’s esoteric content seemed toinduce in his group a different and unexpected kind of perception, throughwhich, he says, they were not only able to understand the symbolism of thefigure itself, but also, in some strange, “holistic” way, to feel the thoughtsand emotions of the people who had created it thousands of years ago.Gurdjieff was, in fact, an inveterate storyteller (a trait he seems to haveinherited from his father, who was an ashok—a bard of some renown), and he maywell have invented an imaginary statue here purely for the purpose ofexposition. But what is important is what is being conveyed in this story: theidea that objective art is based on intuitive, “lunar” knowledge, and unlikeordinary art, presents the viewer with a complete and coherent picture of thecontent and meaning of the work.Much of Wilson’s book, like Hancock’s Fingerprints of the Gods, is concernedwith the great enigmas of the past, some of which we discussed briefly in thelast chapter. But, in the final section, after a long and highly informativejourney through ancient history and remote prehistory, he returns to thequestion that lies at the root of all of his writings: What is consciousness?Wilson sees the two fundamental kinds of knowledge, solar and lunar, or rationaland intuitive, as operating in different regions of the brain, which consists oftwo major hemispheres: right and left. The right hemisphere, our lunar side, isresponsible for our intuitive processes; the left controls our rationalthoughts, our modern, solar functions.As an example of ancient man’s “right-brain” consciousness, which, he suggests,still exists in an attenuated form today in certain so-called primitivecultures, Wilson cites observations made by the American anthropologist EdwardT. Hall in his book The Dance of Life (1983). Hall spent several years studyingthe religious and social customs of several Native American tribes, inparticular the Quiché, who are direct descendants of the ancient Maya, and theHopi and Pueblo. He discovered that to many of these peoples, time, as we knowit, has no meaning. In fact, the Hopi have no word for it and, in theirlanguage, verbs have no tenses. They have no yesterday and no tomorrow,perceiving only an “eternal present,” in which time virtually stands still.On reading this, I was immediately struck by this notion of an endless moment,because it sounded more than vaguely familiar. It suggests, in fact, that theshaman of the Hopi, like those of many other American tribes, are given to usingsome kind of hallucinogenic agent in certain of their ceremonies. Certainlytheir view of time—or the absence of it—is very reminiscent of the extratemporalimpressions I had during my “experiments” in the sixties and seventies. It alsobrings to mind a point I made in the Introduction: that the religious andmystical writings of every major culture, from Egypt right through to Islam, allrefer repeatedly to the timeless dimension of heaven.This notion of timelessness is thus an important link between the psychedelic orshamanistic experience and the mystical revelation, and could provide us with avaluable insight into the true nature of rightbrain, lunar consciousness.So what does it mean to experience only an “eternal present”? Can such a realitybe defined in a way that even “left-brainers” can comprehend? I believe it can.In fact, as we shall see, modern science has already provided us with amathematically verifiable model of such a definition.Obviously, by its very nature, a “timeless” reality is difficult to rationalize,and so might easily be disregarded as the stuff of primitive imagination ortemporary hallucinatory madness—too nebulous to be real. But then there isanother, equally nebulous, manifestation of human consciousness that is acceptedby practically everyone, and this is our intuitive capacity. Intuition is not alogical process, but everyone “knows” it exists. Indeed, science itself thriveson intuition; it has been responsible for some of the most important discoveriesof the modern age. And so, today, as particle physicists probe deeper and deeperinto the apparently illogical nature of matter, they are only too aware thatintuition is one of the most effective tools they have.This is an odd state of affairs, in that we are positing here a thought processshared, though perhaps to greatly varying degrees, by very differentpsychological types: by the physicist and the shaman, or by what Wilson callsthe scientist, the modern thinker, and the artist, the high priest of ancientdays. Obviously there is a little bit of the “lost” artist in every scientist;and, as the physicist’s probings become ever more surreal and intuitive, theartist’s presence grows in stature. Perhaps, then, this is evolution, theprocess whereby the artist and the scientist come to coexist in equal measures.According to Gurdjieff and Schwaller, however, ancient man had far moreextensive mental powers than we have today, which suggests that there has beenmore than a slight hiccup somewhere along the way, something that caused aninvolutionary trend in our development. If true, one wonders how this could havecome about, how a people so highly evolved could suddenly just lose theinitiative, fail to pass on their knowledge to their descendants, and all butdisappear from man-kind’s race-memory.One possible reason, as Hancock has suggested, is that there was some greatcatastrophe, possibly caused by the extreme conditions of the melt-down at theend of the last ice age, that left only a few survivors of the evolved race—anelite, highly resilient minority, castaways in a new and forbidding wildernesspopulated by fierce and fearful hunter-gatherers. It would have been virtuallyimpossible for these survivors to have immediately passed on their vast wealthof knowledge to primitive tribes. Yet they realized that somehow, if the lessfortunate peoples of this earth were to have any chance of evolving at anythingother than a snail’s pace, this knowledge had to be kept alive. And this meantdealing with, and controlling, the majority population, whose manpower theyneeded to utilize in their concerted effort to build on a scale so vast thatonly another great cataclysm could wipe out all traces of their endeavors.The myths of the Fourth Dynasty Egyptians and the ancient Native Americans bothrefer to these superior-minded survivors as gods possessed of supernaturalpowers. These were the gods of the First Time—the “golden age”—who planted theseeds of ultimate wisdom in the minds and hearts of our ancestors, the primitivenatives. They created complex cosmological creation myths and subsequentlydisseminated them worldwide; they built great works of “objective art,”monuments with specific dimensions, orientations, and alignments that, oncedecoded, would reveal every aspect of their knowledge in precise and graphicdetail. And this knowledge, wholly encapsulated in the Hermetic Code, wassubsequently embodied in the measurements of pyramids and other megalithicstructures all over the world, and in virtually every major religious scripture.And so then they waited, these gods, for the population to evolve. Gods livingin eternity can do that. Presumably they are still waiting, waiting for theirseminal message to germinate and come to flower. And who knows? Maybe thecurrent upsurge in awareness of the extraordinarily advanced ideas of our mostancient predecessors is the first sign of a new bloom.Of course, this is just one historical scenario, and it doesn’t bring us anynearer to answering the question posed by Wilson, i.e., how might these godshave perceived the world?Strange as it may seem, we may possibly find at least part of the answer not atthe dawn of history, but at the very frontiers of modern science. We havealready noted how scientists are becoming, as Graves might say, more and more“lunar” in their mode of thought. The modern scientist is not a god, but he hasat least learned to use his intuition in his quest for the truth about reality.And what he has discovered, for example in the microcosmic world of thesubatomic particle, is extremely interesting, because the reality now beingdescribed in scientific terms brings us full circle, right back to the visionsof the Hopi, the hippie, and the Egyptian high priest.“Down there,” in the world of the elementary particle, time has no quantifiablemeaning, no value; it simply doesn’t exist. This is the real world we aretalking about here, the world defined by physicists in precise mathematicalterms. Therefore the Hopi, in a very real sense, have it exactly right:timelessness is the primary reality. More than that, the ancient Egyptians, Ibelieve, realized this also, as is evidenced by this ancient poem referring tothe god-king:His lifetime is eternity,the borders of his powers are infinity.4 [26_note.html#fo24]Lofty thoughts indeed for a people whose ancestors of only five hundred yearsbefore were simple, wandering nomads. I shall have more to say on this “modern”notion of timelessness later.But in fact, as we shall see, there are other crucial shamanistic concepts thatare equally at home in the modern scientific mind. Consider this. The mostimportant part of Hopi ceremonial life is the dance— hence the title of Hall’sbook. He writes that if the dance is performed correctly, to the participantseverything—the entire universe—“collapses, and is contained in this one event.”Thus the Hopi’s experience of this alternative reality is not only timeless, itis spaceless, and implies a dimension in which everything—time, space,matter—can collapse into a single conceptual “eternal moment.” Once again wehave a close Egyptian parallel in the reference to the god-king quoted above,whose life span we noted was described as eternity, and the borders of whosepowers are infinity. Endless time . . . infinite space. . . . And this is justfor starters. Later, when we take a more detailed look at other scientificdiscoveries, we shall see how this “primitive” notion of spacelessness also hasquite distinct echoes in the present day.Many Native American tribes consider the earth to be a living, matriarchalbeing. Some believe that she becomes pregnant every spring and should thereforebe treated gently. Thus they will remove steel shoes from their horses andmodern shoes from their own feet for fear of breaking the surface of the earth.As Wilson says, such a notion is not simply an idea or belief, but “somethingthey feel in their bones, so that an Indian’s relationship with the Earth is asintimate as his relationship with his horse. . . . To regard this as a ‘belief’is to miss a whole dimension of reality.”5 [26_note.html#fo25]Wilson believes that the ancient Egyptians shared a similar kind of intimacywith nature, and with the land and skies of the Nile valley, perhaps partly dueto their close relationship with the life-giving River Nile, whose annualinundation occurred just as the star Sirius/Sothis returned to the early morningsky after seventy days spent below the horizon. These regular and importantevents would have ensured that the Egyptians remained very much in tune withtheir environment, with the earth, with the sky, and with the rhythmic unfoldingof the seasons.So what Wilson is saying is that Egyptian knowledge was not simply based onsuperstition, but on “a deeply experienced relationship with the earth and theheavens.”6 [26_note.html#fo26] As with the Native Americans, this contact withthe world about them was something the Egyptians felt in their bones, and whatthey felt was the rhythm of nature. Schwaller shared a similar view, statingthat “every living being is in contact with all the rhythms and harmonies of allthe energies in the universe.”7 [26_note.html#fo27] But Schwaller also believedthat modern man had lost touch with nature’s rhythms and harmonies, and when hespeaks of ancient knowledge providing a method of speeding up the evolutionaryprocess, he clearly associates this method with the reestablishment of man’sformer, intimate relationship with nature.Now, Schwaller’s ideas are sound enough to deserve consideration, but Wilson,while obviously sharing similar views, was prompted to pose the followingquestion: “But is there any way to turn this rather vague and abstract statementinto something more concrete and down to earth?”8 [26_note.html#fo28]In my view, there is, a wholly practical way of looking at the processes of thedevelopment of consciousness, the very “secret of cosmic harmony and its precisevibrations” that Wilson believes the Egyptians possessed. The Hermetic Code, themusical theory of transcendental evolution embodied in Egyptian myth andreligion, in the I Ching, and in just about every major religious doctrineknown, fits the bill perfectly. Wilson doesn’t actually say as much, but he thengoes on to devote several pages to an impartial commentary on my first book,including details of the close correspondences between the structure of the IChing, the pi symmetry, and DNA and the genetic code. I have to say that hisstudied appraisal of the ideas presented in The Infinite Harmony is verygratifying—particularly so since, as far as I know, he is the only publishedwriter to have broached them to date. Whether he agrees with everything I sayis, of course, another matter. When I spoke with him prior to publication of hisbook he hinted then that there would be no committal, no outright endorsement ofmy ideas. Typically, he has been true to his word. Nevertheless, this now givesme an opportunity to strengthen my case by filling in some of the gaps left inhis commentary.As we have noted, the musical symmetry described by the Hermetic Code is echoed,note for note, in our very bones, in our DNA and in the genetic code. Throughthe world’s religions, mankind has been instinctively living out the basicprinciples of this code for thousands of years. This is because it is aperfectly natural thing to do; it is the way of creation. The trouble is thatsomewhere along the line we forgot why we were holding the seventh day sacredand acting out “passions.” We have had timely reminders of our sorry state fromindividuals like Moses, Christ, the Buddha, Zoroaster, and Muhammad, which havehelped to keep “the faith” alive, but such has been our lot that we have tendedalways to forget and switch back over to automatic pilot. This is how a greatwork of “living music” like the I Ching can end up being used as little morethan a pocket fortune-teller.The Egyptians, I believe, never forgot, but consciously persisted in theapplication of the principles of the Hermetic Code as a complete mode of being,a “religion” in the fullest sense. This is how they were able to develop theiracute sense of belonging with the world and so become increasingly moreconscious in it. I think this is precisely the “method” Schwaller was lookingfor.The remarkable thing about the Hermetic Code is that it is not only a blueprintfor our inner development; it also has very definite cosmic applications thatprovide us with a direct link to what Schwaller called “all the rhythms andharmonies” of the universe. This is how.The theory of transcendental evolution, as I have said, is based on theknowledge of the structure of the major musical scale, and the idea that alllife evolves ever upward, as the notes in a developing octave evolve intohigher, more resonant scales of existence. Going up, in other words, toward thestars. In a broad sense, the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution accords with thisconcept. Over billions of years, bacteria have evolved “upward” intosingle-celled organisms; they in turn have evolved into multicellularstructures, and these have evolved into all the complex animal life formsexisting today. This continuous chain of evolution, from the free-floatingbacterium to the free-thinking human being, is a transcendental processinvolving a continuous succession of quantum leaps from one scale of existenceinto a greater scale above.I’m not suggesting, of course, that the ancient Egyptians knew all aboutbiomolecular events in the microcosm—at least, not through an accumulation offragmented facts experimentally verified by prehistoric biologists andgeneticists. What I am saying, however, is that the Egyptians probably took allthis for granted, that they already intuitively understood what was going oninside them, or “down there.” As a matter of fact, the originator of theHermetic Code—Thoth, Hermes, whoever—left us with one simple yet incrediblyastute dictum that sums up the theory of transcendental evolution perfectly: “Asabove, so below.”“Above” we have the Hermetic Code as expressed through the pi convention, 22/7,composed of three octaves, each of which is itself composed of three octaves, atotal of sixty-four inner notes. “Below” we have the genetic code, whosestructure is not merely similar to the Hermetic Code, but is identical rightdown to the very last detail. Not only that, but both codes, as we noted whendiscussing the I Ching in the introduction, share a common purpose, which is tofacilitate the processes of creation, of evolution onto a higher scale ofexistence. In the case of the genetic code working within your body’s cells,this higher scale is represented by your whole being and, in particular, yourmind. But in the case of the Hermetic Code operating within “cells” of some kindin an infinitely greater “body,” the next, higher scale must lie far beyond theconfines of the brain, somewhere . . . up there.The established neo-Darwinian theory of evolution, of natural selection throughrandom mutation, attempts to explain only the evolutionary development ofphysical bodies in the local biosphere of our planet. It is an unfinishedtheory. The theory of transcendental evolution, however, gives us the wholepicture; it tells us that the evolutionary chain of life doesn’t end with thehuman being struggling to survive in a competitive terrestrial environment. Thetruth is, where the ongoing evolution of mankind is concerned, as the Egyptiansknew full well, the possibilities are limitless. That is, nature’s evolutionaryprocesses, encoded within the musical structure of DNA and the genetic code,continue to evolve higher still, beyond the confines of the physical brainencased in the skull, into metaphysical scales of existence that ultimatelyencompass the entire universe.We noted in the previous chapter that ancient man was intensely interested inthe stars, in precession, and in immensely long cycles of time. Now we can seewhy. The ancient Egyptians weren’t simply admiring the view; they were stakingtheir claim in the greater scale above, paving a way to heaven. Cosmology with acapital C.In the world of computers, virtual reality, and endless information highways,the modern mind is more often than not inclined to look back on these times withsuperiority. Even today, historians continue to portray ancient Egyptians asmanic “tomb builders,” highly gifted but superstitious stargazers, whosemonumental architectural designs, however ingenious, are totally devoid of anyesoteric meaning. But as we have seen, these remarkable people in fact had acomplex cosmology superior even to our own, one that included within it thecosmologist himself.Our modern cosmologists assiduously study everything “up there.” That is theirjob. What lies “below” is no concern of theirs. But this partial view presentsproblems, as with the Egyptologist who meticulously searches the sands fortelltale shards of pottery and other fragments, but who knows nothing aboutastronomy. This is the tunnel vision of specialization that prevents many“experts” from seeing holistically. As a result of this imbalance, scientificknowledge has become segregated; it is not a part of our everyday lives. Wemight look up and think about astronomical questions occasionally, but on thewhole our world is predominantly terrestrial, confined and circumscribed inrelation to the vastness of the universe around us.Now consider the world the ancient Egyptians inhabited, which not only includedthe land of their birth, but also the earth itself, the sun, moon, and planets,and even the ever-changing constellations. This is an all-encompassing vision.And the civilization capable of perceiving it showed its stature through thegrandeur of this vision. The Egyptians had their sights set firmly on theheavens, their sole raison d’être being an intense, concerted effort to assistmankind on its transcendental journey to the stars, to the greater scale above.And to make absolutely sure that their message carried, they skillfully encodedthe fundamental principles of their extraordinary life science in thedimensions, proportions, and alignments of massive stone monuments built withunsurpassable precision, many still acknowledged as the greatest man-madestructures on earth.As we shall see later, the cosmological perspective of Egyptian metaphysics is,in fact, the basis of ancient man’s entire belief system, and may even be, asmany commentators now suspect to be the case, a legacy from an even earlierperiod of civilization existing in what we currently refer to as prehistory. Butbefore we can ascertain how their musical method of self-development might havegiven them direct access to the greater cosmos, we first need to consider moreearthly matters, which will be the subject of the next chapter. The mainquestion arises from the established historical fact that virtually all of thecyclopean monuments created at the dawn of our history were built before thewheel was invented. So how was this accomplished?"},{"pageContent":"3Music over MatterNo one has yet convincingly explained how the architects and engineers of theancient world managed to build on such a monumental scale. This applies equallyto structures on both sides of the Atlantic, many of which have been shown todisplay remarkably similar design features. In the ancient city of Tiahuanaco inthe Andes, as in Egypt, blocks weighing more than two hundred tons arecommonplace. There is one construction block that has been estimated by GrahamHancock to weigh as much as 440 tons. Also in Peru, the citadels of Sacsayhuamanand Machu Picchu contain similar megalithic stones that have been cut andcarefully positioned with a degree of precision that even modern constructionengineers would be hard pressed to match.Equally mysterious is the presence of truly giant pyramids on both continents.The Great Pyramid is arguably the most notable, being the largest solid stoneedifice ever constructed by man, having a base area of over thirteen acres.However, the great Pyramid of the Maya at Cholula in Mexico, despite its coreconsisting not of blocks of stone but of rubble, is in fact more than threetimes as massive as the Great Pyramid. Its base covers an area of forty-fiveacres, making it easily the largest building on the planet.Now, fashioning and carefully placing hundreds upon hundreds of huge blocks ofstone to conform to precise geometrical and astronomical alignments is an art initself, but the immense scale of these enterprises is not the only puzzle. Thereis also the question of how these craftsmen actually carved and cut the stone.William Flinders Petrie examined the red granite “sarcophagus” in the King’sChamber of the Great Pyramid and noted that it had been hollowed out to such afine degree of accuracy that its external volume is exactly twice its internalvolume. And this was achieved with one of the hardest stones on earth. Themethod used, according to Petrie, was some kind of tubedrilling mechanism,rather like a section of drainpipe with exceptionally hard teeth set into therim. How such an implement might have been powered is a question that onlycompounds the mystery.Petrie surmised that the sarcophagus itself had been cut from the mother blockwith a “saw” at least two and a half meters long, though no evidence of such animplement has ever been found—except for the serrated marks, of course. Petriealso found evidence of the use of circular saws and even lathes; but again, onlythe manufacturing marks on numerous stone artifacts remain as proof that suchtools ever existed.In any event, even if drills and lathes were in common use in ancient Egypt,this would not explain the discovery of a large number of hollowed-out basaltvases found in and around the Third Dynasty Saqqarah necropolis and dated toaround 4000–3000 BCE. As Hancock describes in Fingerprints of the Gods, some ofthese elegantly curved vessels with widely flared interiors have long, slendernecks too narrow for even a small finger to be inserted. And yet they havesome-how been hollowed out with unbelievable precision.It has been suggested by a modern toolmaker called Christopher Dunn, who hasstudied the baffling stonework of the Egyptians in some detail, that thecraftsmen responsible for some of the work may have had a technology based onhigh-frequency sound. Basically Dunn believes that the workmen may have employedsome kind of ultrasonic tool bit capable of vibrating at a rate thousands oftimes faster than a pneumatic drill. However, even if such a mechanism wereused, as in the case of the proposed drills and saws and lathes mentioned above,we would have to assume that the Egyptians could somehow produce the powernecessary to drive such devices.Whatever may be the case, it is becoming increasingly evident that, contrary tothe beliefs of orthodox archaeologists, the craftsmen responsible for some ofthese mysterious artifacts certainly did not use crude copper chisels, adzes,and simple wooden mallets to do the job. As Dunn has noted, these people werecapable of producing smooth, flat surfaces on granite or basalt to an incredibleaccuracy of a thousandth of an inch or more. He demonstrated this to RobertBauval in the Cairo Museum by placing a high-precision metal gauge against aside of the ancient relic known as the Ben-race-memory-Ben Stone and shining alight against the line of contact. That no light was visible from the other sideindicates an engineering accuracy equal to that of the present day.Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Dunn’s idea of the use ofhigh-frequency sound is that it implies the application of a concentrated formof resonance, the raw material of music, the principles of which, as we haveseen, were the mainstay of Egyptian metaphysics. So possibly these people usedtheir knowledge of cosmic harmony and vibrations to assess—or maybe “feel”—whatkind of ultrasound frequency would be required to work a given material. Afterall, everything vibrates, resonates, and it may be that the Egyptians had founda way of creating sympathetic frequencies that depended not so much on apowerful energy supply but more on an understanding of the subtle, interrelatedstructures of these inherent symmetries.Such a notion may at first seem somewhat abstract, but later we shall see thatthe Hermetic Code provides us with a rather ingenious description of themechanism by which these “inner” symmetries can be understood. This is furthersupported by the ideas of Gurdjieff, some of which I shall be discussing indetail in chapter 12 [20_chapter12.html], and also by some of the ideas of anumber of modern scientists in disciplines as diverse as clinical psychology,neurophysiology, and even that seemingly inviolable sanctum of all empiricalscience, nuclear physics.Unfortunately Dunn’s ultrasound theory, if correct, would still not explain howsuch massive stones, such as those incorporated in the Valley Temple at Giza andthe Osireion at Abydos, once cut and shaped, were then moved into position.Colin Wilson has suggested that the builders might have employed a methodsimilar to the popular party trick in which a subject sits on a chair and fourvolunteers place one finger underneath each armpit and knee and try to lift himor her. Without any preparation, the result is as one might expect, and thesubject, unaffected, stays put. If, subsequently, the volunteers all place theirhands on the top of the subject’s head, first their right hands and then theirleft hands, and then concentrate hard for a minute or so, when theysimultaneously remove their hands and try once more, the subject can sometimesbe lifted high off the ground with very little apparent effort. It’s as if fourpeople concentrating in unison can somehow exert a new, much more powerful kindof force. One volunteer alone would find difficulty in lifting a quarter of theweight of a fully grown subject with a single index finger, yet four togethercan not only lift four times that weight, they can often do it with astonishingease.Wilson suggests that this “group-mind” phenomenon was possibly a basic way oflife to the ancient builders of Egypt, who saw nothing extraordinary in movinggreat chunks of stone in this way, perhaps believing that the gods were makingthe blocks lighter, and that no special effort was required other than acting inunison, in harmony with one another.With regard to the party trick mentioned above, one wonders whether the mind ofthe subject might also be involved. There is a certain amount of pressure on thesubject’s head from the hands of the volunteers, and when that pressure isreleased the subject naturally feels a sensation of becoming suddenly lighter.If this were a contributory factor in the experiment, it would raise furtherquestions relating to the raising of inanimate blocks of stone, which could not,one would assume, participate in the experiment in any way.Extensive tests have, in fact, been conducted under laboratory conditions, theresults of which indicate that psychokinesis, or the ability to affect physicalobjects with the mind, is in fact a statistically verifiable reality.In a series of experiments conducted in the 1970s, Robert Jahn of the PrincetonUniversity School of Engineering and Applied Science and the clinicalpsychologist Brenda Dunne used an instrument called a random-event generator(REG) to test the psychokinetic abilities of a large number of volunteers.Triggered by the process of decay of a radioactive material, which is anunpredictable, natural process, a REG is an automatic selector—a “coinflipper”—that produces a completely random series of binary numbers. Volunteerswere asked to sit in front of the device and concentrate on trying to make itproduce an abnormally large number of either “heads” (1) or “tails” (2).Subsequently Jahn and Dunne’s results clearly showed that, simply byconcentrating on the REG, the volunteers were able to influence the binaryoutput to a small but statistically significant degree.In another series of tests they used a kind of pinball machine in which 9,000marbles were allowed to roll around 330 nylon pegs and cascade out of 19 exitholes into bins. Once again, over the course of many trials, they found thatmost of the subjects were able to produce a small but significant change in theaverage number of balls falling into each bin.Jahn, a professor of aerospace sciences, was at first skeptical and reluctant toinvolve himself with these experiments, but he was eventually so impressed bythe results that in 1979 he founded the Princeton Engineering Anomalies ResearchLaboratory, where researchers have continued to produce strong statisticalevidence in favor of the existence of psychokinesis. Furthermore, as theabove-mentioned experiments have shown, it looks as though the ability toproduce detectable psychokinetic influences is not limited to the few, but issomething that most of us can do.Another, rather more unusual example of psychokinetic abilities is that whichphysicists call the Pauli effect, where merely the presence of certainindividuals appears to cause machinery and equipment to malfunction. The classicexample is the eponymous physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who would often andunwittingly cause sensitive equipment to go wrong, or glass apparatus toexplode, simply by being there.This effect may be similar, though not identical, to the one I described in TheInfinite Harmony, where the psychologist Carl Jung caused a piece of heavyfurniture to split apart with a force that appeared to emanate from his solarplexus. Sigmund Freud actually witnessed the incident, but when Jung declaredthat he had somehow been responsible, Freud bluntly refused to believe it.There are fundamental differences between this “Jung effect” and that of Pauli.First, Jung was conscious of it as it was happening, because the “force” causedhis solar plexus to heat up; second, while Freud was shaking his head indisbelief, Jung, feeling the force build up once more, was able to predict thatit would happen again. Within moments there was another loud crack and the woodsplintered a second time.1 [26_note.html#fo31]Obviously these examples are not quite the same as the party-trick phenomenon,which relies on the concerted, conscious effort of a group, but they at leastserve to remind us that there is probably a great deal more to the power of thehuman psyche than its recognized potential for reasoning, inventing,conceptualizing, and so forth.When considering the possibility of the “group-mind” technique, Colin Wilson isnot implying that the architects of ancient Egypt actually levitated theirmegalithic blocks. Rather, he thinks that the cumulative power of “groupconsciousness” was an everyday reality to the Egyptians, and that apparentphysical forces, when applied in concert by a given group in this way (perhapsorchestrated by priests uttering magical incantations), could somehow bemagnified to an unusually high degree.Now it so happens that there is a very close parallel to Wilson’s idea in thelegends and myths of the ancient Greeks. The Pythagorean philosophers, whoclearly inherited their hermetic or “musical” knowledge from Egyptian sources,had a name for this “group consciousness,” homonoia, which translates as a“union of minds.” This state could be achieved, they believed, by emulating thedivine actions of the god Apollo and the nine muses, the patrons of all thearts. Significantly, Apollo himself was depicted as the supreme musician, andthe word music, derived from the word muse, originally referred to all aspectsof learning. According to the Greeks, through this kind of harmonious union ofminds, mankind could literally change the world.The Pythagoreans believed that their mythological heroes and gods— includingPythagoras himself—were able to play special forms of music that could directlyaffect both sentient beings and non-sentient things. Orpheus, for example, issaid to have moved rocks and even mountains with the power of his music; andanother legendary hero, Amphion, with only his lyre moved rocks and stones toconstruct the walls of the ancient city of Thebes.Interestingly there are exact parallels between these and some legends of thepeoples of the pre-Columbian Americas. For example, one Mayan legend says thatthe construction of the Pyramid of the Magician at Uxmal in Yucatán was arelatively simple affair, that all the builders had to do was “whistle and theheavy blocks would move into place.”2 [26_note.html#fo32] Another traditiontells how the blocks used in the building of the city of Tiahuanaco in the Andeswere “carried through the air to the sound of a trumpet.”3 [26_note.html#fo33]In his book In Search of the Miraculous, P. D. Ouspensky recounts a talk givenby Gurdjieff concerning the literal truth of these musical myths. Gurdjieffstates that “objective music,” as he calls it, cannot only destroy, as in thecase of Jericho, but also create. Orpheus disseminating knowledge simply byplaying the lyre is cited as an example, and further, he says, there could besuch music as would freeze water, or even kill a man instantaneously.Though not quite so dramatic, we see examples today of music, or soundvibrations, having a direct effect on people and things. Most people have heardof the soprano’s voice that, when pitched at a given level, can shatter a glass.Of course, a glass is an inanimate object, but certain sounds can also have adramatic effect on people.In particular, a new innovation in surgery known as high-intensity focusedultrasound (HIFU) involves using powerful beams of ultrasound as a “virtualscalpel” that allows surgeons to operate deep inside the human body and totarget very accurately and destroy malignant tumors. The precision of thistechnique is such that, unlike established cancer treatments like radiotherapyand chemotherapy, the operation can be carried out without damaging any of thesurrounding tissue. And there are no apparent side effects. Early trials haveproved very promising. To date, almost one hundred people in Britain have beentreated with ultrasound for liver cancer, with positive preliminary results.4[26_note.html#fo34]Another example is the kind of sound that has recently been employed by aSwedish manufacturer of burglar alarms. It resembles that excruciating sound ofa nail scraping down a blackboard, but not just one nail, many of them, with thesound magnified to an intolerable degree. Subjects in trials invariably ran outof the sound room within seconds, while those who tried to stick it out reportedfeeling physically sick. The maximum time anyone cared to endure it for wasaround fifty seconds. Personally I have not heard the sound produced by thisdiabolical machine, but I have been around enough blackboards to know that Icertainly don’t want to. I only have to sit here and imagine it and I canliterally make my teeth go on edge. This kind of “music” might not directly killyou, but, if prolonged, it could very possibly drive you mad enough to do thedeed yourself.In one of his own books, Beelzebub’s Tales, in chapter 41, “The BokharianDervish,” Gurdjieff speaks about a demonstration of “objective music” given tohim by cave-dwelling ascetics in the mountains of Central Asia. During thecourse of the experiment, which involved playing obscure sequences of notes onan elaborately modified piano, he watched as a large abscess rapidly appeared onthe leg of one of those present. When another series of notes was subsequentlyplayed, the abscess, which evidently caused the subject very real pain anddiscomfort, mysteriously faded away. In another demonstration, fresh flowerswere made to wither and die within minutes.Of course, the ancient musical legends describing the extraordinary abilities ofmaster stonemasons could be pure fiction, although it is difficult to understandwhy so many identical myths—and there are many—should have emerged in suchwidely separated regions. And then we have the amazing architectural evidenceitself, in sites the world over, which demonstrates a superior and currentlyinexplicable technological proficiency in the handling of stone.All this actually proves nothing, however, and those of a scientific turn ofmind will feel that such tales of “musical magic” are either allegorical, orthat they are simply the stuff of imagination and superstition. Perhaps so. Buteven those at the cutting edge of scientific enquiry would agree that all theirsacred laws are not yet written. There is currently in circulation a whole newbatch of fantastic ideas concerning the nature of universal reality. These rangefrom the macroworld of chaos and complexity theories implying an underlyingcosmic unity, to the microworlds of superstrings and inter-penetrating loops inwhich even so-called empty space is seen as a woven fabric of unimaginably finethreads of . . . well, something or other. As we shall see in subsequentchapters, there is no end to the ingenuity and imagination of scientists intenton discovering the “theory of everything.”Given such an open-ended scientific view of the world, it would seem that thereis still time and space enough to accommodate the ancient notion of “musicalmagic.” After all, this “primitive superstition” has already found expression inthe field of biochemistry, where we see that the respective musical symmetriesof the genetic code and the Hermetic Code are identical in every respect. Sothen we hear that the people who first revealed the Hermetic Code also believedin the power of a strange kind of music that could “enchant” just abouteverything: trees, wild beasts, even rocks of the hardest stone. We can see howthis could apply to trees and wild beasts, because the very essence of both theanimal and vegetable kingdoms is music; it is the genetic code, which “enchants”just about every living thing. Rocks are another matter; they are not imbuedwith life as we know it. Could it be, then, that they are imbued with some formof life as we don’t know it? This is what the mythmakers say.The Greek philosopher Thales, reputedly one of the teachers of Pythagoras,taught that the whole universe was alive and that even inanimate things likerocks and mountains possessed psychic attributes. The “builder gods,” Orpheusand Amphion, were said to have had the ability to tune in to this elementalconsciousness, and so persuade inanimate objects to do their bidding. Thisnotion could easily be discarded as simply another example of primitivesuperstition, until we learn that the idea that elementary atoms of matter mightpossess some kind of awareness of the world about them is now being seriouslyconsidered by physicists. Later we shall be exploring this newly discovered“quantum” reality in more detail. As we shall see, many of the scientificdiscoveries relating to this microcosmic wonderland may not, in fact, be quiteas new and radical as most scientists believe.Thus, according to Thales, the ancient builders of Egypt did not see things inthe same way as we do. To them, everything was to some degree alive, conscious,“psychic.” Interestingly, this is an idea that is reflected quite clearly in thelong-standing traditions of the great Indian yogi masters, many of whom arereputed to have possessed psychokinetic and telepathic powers.The eminent Indian philosopher Sri Aurobindo, echoing Thales, stated thatpsychokinesis is possible only because matter is to some extent conscious. Ifmatter were truly inert and lifeless, there would be no conceivable means ofcontact between the thinker and the object. Further, if a single point in theuniverse possessed zero consciousness, he said, then the whole universe itselfwould have to be unconscious.Similarly, in his book Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramhansa Yogananda describesmeeting numerous yogi masters who could materialize and dematerialize their ownbodies and other objects at will. He claimed that such holy men can actuallymove at the speed of light and utilize “creative light rays” to bring intoinstant visibility any physical manifestation.5 [26_note.html#fo35] ObviouslyYogananda was referring here to a more subtle form of materiality than sandstoneor granite, and this is a difficult concept for our logical minds to accept. Butthe world of the Indian yogi, like that of the Hopi shaman, is primarily a worldof the mind, an alternative reality in which psychokinesis is seen as aperfectly accessible human function. This kind of abstract notion might seem farremoved from the question of building with megalithic blocks of stone, but thereis, nevertheless, an extremely important link between Yogananda’s view of thephenomenon of “creative” light and that of the ancient Egyptians, a linkfundamental to our understanding of the whole cosmology of ancient man. We shallshortly be looking at this crucial connection in some detail.Now, I’m not suggesting for a moment that buildings like the Great Pyramid andthe Sphinx enclosure were simply “thought up” by gods, at least not withouthuman intervention. But from the evidence at hand I feel reluctant to accept theuncompromising view of orthodox archaeologists who insist that there was nothingunusual about the methods of construction employed. Many of the stone blocksused by these ancient builders, remember, are several hundred tons in weight.The largest so far identified is the massive, free-standing foundation stone ofthe Temple of Baalbek in Lebanon, which is estimated to weigh a staggering 1,200tons. Cutting and shaping a megalith of such monumental proportions is in itselfan accomplishment that makes the patchwork concrete and steel structures ofmodern builders look positively Lilliputian, but then to move this blockhundreds of meters to its present location is a technical maneuver thatpractically defies belief. The most powerful lifting gear used in the modernconstruction industry can lift hundreds of tons, and a trained team of workershave to spend weeks preparing the ground of the proposed site beforehand,examining the subsurface, leveling, laying down hard core, and so forth. Yethere we have a single, free-standing megalith whose estimated mass is over twicethe maximum lifting capacity of even the most modern boom-crane. This in itselfdoes not, of course, constitute proof of the use of paranormal powers on thepart of the people who executed this remarkable feat, but it nevertheless raisesfundamental questions concerning the orthodox view, that this block was movedpurely by conventional means.Colin Wilson, as we noted, has suggested that the “group consciousness”technique might have been employed in the manipulation of such blocks. Hebelieves that the builders still used conventional means of construction—ramps,rollers, levers, ropes, and the like—but that the real power behind thesemethods emanated from the collective “vibrations” of the “group mind.” And thisis precisely what is being implied by the Pythagoreans’ notion of a state ofhomonoia. To these thinkers, as with their Egyptian forerunners, homonoia, acollective unification of mind, body, and spirit, was an attainable reality.They believed that, when totally synchronized—as it apparently was in the oldmystery schools of Orphic origin—the psychic energy generated in this way couldsomehow be used directly to influence matter, even gargantuan lumps of hardrock.As Jahn and Dunne have demonstrated through their extensive tests, statisticallydiscernible psychokinetic powers can be exhibited today by perfectly normalsubjects using nothing more than their ordinary concentration. In otherinstances, such as the Pauli and Jung effects mentioned earlier, the results aresometimes dramatic, but often erratic and uncontrolled. Nevertheless, there arethousands of accounts from every age describing the paranormal powers of giftedindividuals: in the legends of the builders of antiquity, in the scriptures ofvirtually every major religion, and in the many stories of the lives of saintsand “psychics” the world over. Even supposing that many of these accounts mighthave been invented for effect or whatever, one feels that it would be stretchingcredulity too far to presume that there wasn’t a single grain of truth anywherein the vast store of literature on the subject.In the party-trick phenomenon, in which a set of minds enter into a homonoicstate, it seems as if the cumulative force so generated is considerably greaterthan the sum of its parts. The volunteers being raised in this kind ofexperiment can often be lifted high off the ground with such disproportionateease that they seem almost to be floating. And if this same method could also beused effectively on inanimate objects, then possibly, given the rightcircumstances, a large mass would require relatively few people to shift it.This is interesting, because it may provide a possible answer to a puzzlingquestion raised by John Anthony West in a 1992 documentary film about RobertSchoch’s investigations into the weathering of the Sphinx enclosure. West notedthat the enclosure, which is surrounded by steep-sided natural bedrock, isrelatively small in view of the enormous size of the stone blocks that had to bemaneuvered within it. There would have been insufficient room for teams ofworkers large enough even to drag a two-hundred-ton block, let alone lift it.If, however, something like the “group-mind” technique were the force behindtheir ropes and levers, a force considerably greater than the sum of its parts,then the paucity of working space might not have been a problem.In any event, we have already ruled out the use of massive lifting devices andexcessively large numbers of manual workers, so there has to be some otherexplanation: the “group-mind” technique, which, as we know, works on livingsubjects, is at least a theoretical possibility. And, as we have noted,something very similar was involved in the early Greek concept of a joint stateof homonoia through which, it was believed, mankind could ultimately transcendto greater things, some kind of collective psychological harmony acquired via athought system based, according to the Greeks, on the music played by the godApollo. And this “music,” the art of the muses, was not simply concerned withthe theoretical aspects of the science of harmonics—that is, the systematicdefinition by the Pythagoreans of the mathematical structure of the majormusical scale—but also with an awareness of the greater cosmic order, withknowledge of the principles and practical applications of the Hermetic Code. Itis this concept, I believe, that in some mysterious way lies at the root of thespecial form of music played by the heroes, Orpheus and Amphion, by thestonemasons of ancient Egypt, and by the “builder gods” of Central and SouthAmerica.So did these people really possess supernatural powers? We may possibly neverknow, but we are certain that they possessed extraordinary abilities. By theuninitiated, these highly advanced skills could easily have been construed asmagic. Of course, the exact methods of construction used in ancient Egypt eludeus still, and we ourselves, for all our accumulation of technological expertise,are left in a position not dissimilar to that of the early propagators ofancient myth, who evidently witnessed the actions of this highly developedpeople, but did not fully comprehend what they saw. Modern observers, who donot, by and large, believe in magic, obliquely refer to this forgotten scienceas the use of “unknown techniques.”We noted earlier that all around the world there are legends and myths speakingof a time long ago when godlike civilizers used the power of music to build thefirst cities. According to such stories, these mysterious builders could movegreat blocks of stone simply by creating special forms of sound, by playingmusical instruments, whistling, singing, or whatever. In Mexico, Bolivia, andPeru, and in numerous regions in Central Asia, where these legends abound, thereis a single common factor that gives credence to all of them: the hard evidence,in all of these locations, of buildings incorporating truly gigantic stoneblocks.In his book Gods of Eden, Andrew Collins devotes three chapters to the subjectof what he calls sonic technology, citing some of the mythological accountsalready quoted, but including also accounts of travelers to Tibet in the firsthalf of the twentieth century who witnessed the apparent levitation of stoneblocks actuated by monks using numerous, specially contrived sound instruments.Published in the 1950s by a Swedish engineer, Henry Kjellson, one of theseaccounts concerns another Swede, a certain Dr. Jarl, who was invited by aTibetan acquaintance to visit him at his monastery near Lhasa.One day during this visit Jarl accompanied about 240 monks to a nearby meadowadjacent to a high cliff face. About 250 meters up the cliff was an entrance toa large cave, on the outer ledge of which were several other monks. Forty or soof the monks assembled below took up strategic positions in slightly more than a90-degree arc around a large, cupped, stone platform. They then began to preparea large number of instruments: thirteen drums, of varying size, with a skin atone end and open at the other, and six “ragdons,” described as three-meter-longtrumpets. Subsequently a large stone about one and a half meters in length andone meter in height and width was dragged by yak to the cupped stone platformand manhandled onto it by attendant monks. The musicians then began playing, atfirst slowly and rhythmically, apparently “pointing” their instruments at thestone at the apex of the triangular shaped assembly. Gradually the noise fromthe drums and trumpets increased and then the tempo sped up so quickly that Jarllost track of any rhythm. His account of what happened next sounds like purefantasy. Allegedly the stone in focus at first began to wobble and then it rosefrom the ground with a rocking motion. As it rose, the drums and trumpets weretilted upward, aimed constantly toward the stone, which continued to rise in along parabolic arc, until it ultimately crashed down with considerable forceonto the ledge at the mouth of the cave, 250 meters up the nearby cliff face.For much of that day Jarl watched as the process was repeated five or six timesan hour.6 [26_note.html#fo36]As if. This is the response I would expect from most of you. Indeed, on firstreading this account I experienced the same old knee-jerk reaction myself,living as I do in a predominantly secular environment, where “miracles” such asthe one just described occur only in fairy tales. But at the back of my mind, Ihave this confounding piece of evidence, an undeniably real artifact, whose veryexistence gnaws at the core of my reason. This is the 1200-ton stone megalith ofthe Temple of Baalbek in Lebanon, a perfectly shaped block almost twenty-fivemeters in length, with a mass nearly two and a half times greater than anythingthat could be lifted by the largest boom-crane on Earth. At some period inancient history, long predating the Greek structures on the site and before eventhe simple wheel had been invented, this veritable monster was somehowtransported several hundred meters from the quarry of its origin to its presentlocation high above sea level. Three comparatively smaller stones, each weighingsomething approaching 600 tons, were also carved and transported with it.7[26_note.html#fo37]So we have hard evidence, great, monstrous lumps of solid stone standing as highas five-story houses, which attests to a stone-raising technology vastly moresophisticated than our own. We might expect that modern engineers could, givensufficient time and funds, build a boom-crane capable of raising such a massupward, but by what conceivable means could they then, without the applicationof the wheel, apply a sideways motion to these megaliths, covering not just afew yards, but hundreds of meters of undulating terrain? It seems to me thatuntil the experts can come up with a plausible answer to this great mystery, wewould do well to keep an open mind as to the methods used.The above story of the mysterious Dr. Jarl and the Tibetan monks, howeverimprobable, at least fits the bill, because it attests to a stone-raisingtechnology that relies not on ropes, wheels and pulleys, but on purposefullycreated vibrations of sound. Furthermore, if Jarl’s account is genuine, it seemsthat there may have been more to the events he witnessed than simply the use ofsonics. He describes, for example, how the two hundred or so monks not directlyinvolved with playing the instruments stood in rows eight to ten deep behind thearc of musicians, carefully following the flight path of the stone blocks asthey rose up toward the cliff face. Jarl was unable to establish their true rolein the proceedings, suggesting that they could have been either trainees orreplacement players, or that they were engaged in the kind of “group-mind”enterprise discussed earlier in this chapter, meaning that they were effectivelyusing some kind of psychokinesis to direct the flight of the stones.Jarl’s entire account is very sober and detailed, recording numbers, distances,angles, dimensions, and even technical specifications relating to some of theinstruments themselves. As Collins says, not unreasonably in my opinion, thereseems to be too much detail in this report for it to be dismissed as totalfantasy.Collins goes on to cite another account recorded by Kjellson, that of anAustrian filmmaker by the name of Linauer who also visited a Tibetan communitysometime in the 1930s. Here again we have a very detailed account describing theuse of custom-made instruments of sound—in this case a large gong made of gold,iron, and brass and a stringed instrument, also made of different metals andshaped something like a large mussel shell, which apparently was not played assuch, but somehow worked in conjunction with the low, short-lived soundvibrations emitted by the gong. Collins suggests that the “silent” stringedinstrument may have transmuted the sound of the beaten gong into the ultrasonicrange, which somehow caused the effects allegedly witnessed by Linauer. Hereported that when these two instruments were activated they enabled the monksto lift heavy stone blocks with just one hand and very little apparent physicalexertion. Linauer was also told by the monks that similar instruments existedthat could actually disintegrate physical matter. This brings to mindGurdjieff’s claim that “objective music” could do unimaginable things, freezewater, for example. More ominously, it could make flowers wither and die withinminutes, cause physical aberrations to manifest rapidly in the structure ofphysical organisms, or even, as in the case of the warrior patriarch Joshua’sassault on Jericho, cause great stone walls to disintegrate, to crash to theground in pieces.In chapter 6 [14_chapter06.html] of his book, Collins further examines evidencein sacred buildings all over the world of an extraordinary knowledge ofacoustics.In Mexico, for example, there is the nine-stepped pyramid known as the Castillo,a temple dedicated to Viracocha/Kukulcan, which is one of the main structures ofthe Mayan complex at Chichén Itzá in north Yucatán. If you stand at the foot ofthis pyramid and shout, the sound vibrations echo and transmute into an eerieshriek that emanates from the top of the building. Alternatively, if you speakin a normal voice while standing on the summit, you can be heard quite clearlyby people on the ground as much as 150 meters away.Similar strange acoustic properties have been identified in the nearby GreatBall Court, a large field 160 meters in length, flanked by two temples, where afaint whisper at one end can be heard quite easily from the opposite end.8[26_note.html#fo38]There are further examples of unusual acoustic properties in other Mayanstructures. One is the Temple at Tulum on the Yucatán coast, which gives off along, low howling sound when the wind is at a certain velocity and blowing in aparticular direction. Another intriguing example is the Temple of the Magicianat Uxmal, built, according to Mayan legend, by a mysterious race of dwarfs whoonly had to whistle in order to make the heavy blocks of stone rise into theair.9 [26_note.html#fo39] If you stand at the base of this pyramid and clap yourhands, the sound emerges from the top as an eerie chirping, quite unlike theoriginal sound vibrations. At another famous site at Palenque, which consists ofthree principal pyramids, it is possible for three people to stand one at thetop of each of them and engage in a three-way conversation.Possibly Collins’s most interesting observations concern Egypt, and inparticular the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid. Many observers have notedhow voices sounded in this chamber have unusually resonant properties. It is asif this effect, among many others of course, was intentionally created. Collinssuggests that this unusual sound property might have something to do with thefact that the “Pythagorean” 3–4– 5 triangle is incorporated into the chamber’swhole design.This fact can be observed by describing a diagonal from one lower corner of theend wall up to the opposite top corner, which, if the baseline of the floor isincluded, results in a perfectly proportioned 3–4–5 triangle. The same appliesto the huge block of granite incorporated in the wall immediately above theentrance to the chamber. The fact that the chamber is exactly twice as long asit is wide means that the 3–4–5 symmetry is an intrinsic feature of its wholestructure.10 [26_note.html#fo40]As Collins notes, this particular geometrical configuration expresses threesignificant harmonic proportions that together produce the keynote in a majorscale, as with the notes (based on the scale of C major) D (re), E (mi), and G(so), for example, which generate the vibrations of the keynote C, i.e., themagical Do, which appears at the beginning and the end of every major scale. Thecombined frequencies of these three notes relate to one another in the same wayas the combined ratios of the 3–4–5 triangle.The red granite “sarcophagus” in the chamber also possesses unusual acousticproperties. When Flinders Petrie organized a team of workmen to lever one end ofthe sarcophagus up off the ground some twenty centimeters, so that he could takeaccurate measurements of its dimensions, he just happened to strike the tiltedcoffer with a hard implement and was impressed by the deep, resonant sound itproduced, rather like a bell.Another interesting feature of this coffer is that its external volume isexactly twice that of the internal volume. And this ratio of 2:1, as we noted,corresponds to the length of the entire chamber in relation to its width. Inmusical terms, of course, this proportion is highly significant, because itexpresses the ratio between the two extreme notes of the major musical scale,where the last note, Do, of the octave vibrates at twice the frequency of thefirst note, also Do. In view of the vast number of possible variables indimensions that the builders could have opted for, I think we can reasonablyassume that these proportional symmetries did not occur simply by chance.Indeed, given the fact that the Hermetic Code was the central theme of Egyptianmetaphysics, one would be extremely surprised and puzzled if such harmonicproportions were not present, in the King’s Chamber or anywhere else. The wholeof the Great Pyramid itself, remember, is a massive representation of the pisymmetry, the “trinity of octaves,” so it would have been perfectly natural forthe designers to have incorporated expressions of the same musical system in itsmost impressive internal features.In a later chapter we shall be looking again at these lost techniques of thebuilders of the Giza necropolis. As I have said, I believe these methods werebased on a complete understanding of the universal harmonies described by theHermetic Code, but this in itself remains a rather abstract idea, a bit like thehippie notion of tuning in to “good vibrations” as a means of inducing a senseof well-being. There is much more to the Hermetic Code than that, however. It isa universal formula with many facets, and certain of them, as we shall see, areby no means vague or abstract, but scientific in every sense of the word. But inorder to appreciate the full implications of this belief system, we first haveto examine some of the wider applications of the code itself.Finding a theory capable of unifying the whole body of our empirical knowledgeinto a coherent whole—a “theory of everything”—is currently the ultimatescientific goal. Now, I’m no specialist, but after a great deal of painstakingthought and deliberation, I have come to believe that the Hermetic Code couldwell be what we are searching for—the answer to practically all of our mostfundamental questions on life and the universe. Obviously this is hardly a minorclaim in the great evolutionary debate, but throughout my years of questing Ihave always borne in mind that I am propagating here not my ideas, but those ofthe enigmatic “god of wisdom” Hermes/Thoth, one of the greatest minds ever tohave existed.In order to appreciate just how far-reaching this belief system really is, wemust for the time being return to the present and examine some of thefundamental discoveries of modern science. Some of the concepts about to bediscussed are extraordinary to say the least, and may at first seem difficult tograsp, illogical even. But there will be no mathematics involved here—we needonly have a general idea of the nature of the strange world now being describedby scientists, enough to enable us to compare it with the star-strung universeof the Egyptian high priest. Therefore, as a starting point, we shall be lookinginto the nature of what is perhaps the most important and familiar phenomenon inexistence. This is light, the “creative rays,” which, Yogananda claimed, couldsomehow be manipulated by the trained mind of the yogi. This is saying, ineffect, that there is some kind of accessible interface between mind and light.Now these “creative rays” are actually composed of what are today known as lightquanta, or photons, subatomic components classified as “virtual” particles,which means that they have no measurable mass. As we shall see in the followingchapter, photons have been shown to exhibit some strange, almost ghostlikeproperties. And they are not alone: there are, down in the physicist’smicroworld, other minute components engaging in paranormal activities, inparticular electrons, the particles that give all infinitesimally small atomicnuclei a hard, voluminous outer shell and hence the property of materiality aswe know it. Moreover, the photon, as well as existing in the form of visiblelight and other rays of the electromagnetic spectrum, is also the “forcecarrier” of all electromagnetic interactions, which means all interactionsbetween particles of matter, between electrons. In other words, when matterforms or decomposes by interacting with environmental conditions, it does sothrough the constant emission and absorption of photons. Light, therefore, aswell as being a type of radiation capable of inducing in us visual sensation, isalso the universal agent of change. Therefore if Yogananda’s claim is correct,that these “creative rays” can somehow be influenced by the trained mind, wealready have a possible explanation as to how psychokinesis might work.Yogananda, who always followed closely the progress of modern science, notedthat the word “impossible” was becoming less prominent in man’s vocabulary. Thatwas back in 1946. Since then it seems to have disappeared altogether, leaving inits stead a plethora of “improbabilities.” Physicists know that, in the quantumworld of subatomic particles, the impossible can and does happen. For example,it has been discovered that certain categories of virtual particles are createdout of “nothing” in what most people think of as “empty space,” borrowing energyfrom some unidentifiable cosmic storehouse only to disappear without tracenanoseconds later after paying back the energy loan. Billions of these masslessentities are apparently popping into and out of existence in every cubiccentimeter of space in a manner that might reasonably be described as ghostlike.So if you don’t yet believe in the paranormal, either talk to a physicist orturn the page."},{"pageContent":"4The Electron and the Holy GhostAround the beginning of the twentieth century, a new era of scientific enquirybegan, and with it came some startling discoveries concerning the nature ofmatter. Previously, classical physicists had thought of the material universe as“deterministic,” that it obeyed the established Newtonian/Einsteinian laws ofmotion and gravity, and that all material processes could in general bepredicted with experimentally verifiable accuracy. But when physicists startedprobing atomic structures and their components, they discovered that theybehaved in random, uncontrollable ways. In order to account for the peculiardynamics of this strange underworld, scientists developed a new kind of physics,known today as quantum mechanics.This new science is remarkable, because its practitioners not only believe inthe paranormal, but can prove experimentally that it is a reality.It all started with the investigation of subatomic particles, the smallestentities yet detected in the universe, the components of atoms, of light and ofjust about everything else. Originally it was thought that they were simplyparticle-like points in space, but recent discoveries have shown that the“particle” observed is only the detectable trace of a much more complex entity,whose overall presence reaches far and wide.The first hint that this was so came from investigations into the nature oflight itself, which is emitted by light sources in discrete “particle packets,”or quanta, of electromagnetic energy called photons.It was noted that a thin beam of light shone through a tiny pinhole in apartition with a dark screen or photographic plate behind it creates a smallcircle of light on the plate. If there are two holes in the partition closetogether, the image on the back-plate forms two circles of light over-lapping.In the area where they do overlap, however, there are intermittent dark bands,where obviously no light is present. This has been attributed to a familiarwave-mechanics phenomenon known as interference, and it shows that the light isemerging from each pinhole as waves, some-times overlapping and reinforcing oneanother, and sometimes canceling one another out—hence the dark, lightlessbands. Actually, the wavelike nature of light was first recognized as long agoas 1803 by the Englishman Thomas Young, using nothing more than a flame, apartition with two narrow slits and the dark backdrop upon which the patternappeared.Now, if single photons are fired one after another from a light gun over a givenperiod of time, when the photographic plate is subsequently developed theinterference pattern, logically, should not be there, because a single photon,presumably, cannot “interfere” with itself. Curiously, however, the interferencepattern invariably does appear. The photon, it seems, can do whatever it choosesin its own surreal world. It can clap with one hand, creating interferencepatterns out of nothing as if in collaboration with some unseen, ghostlycounterpart. Stranger still, when a photon detector is engaged to “see” what isgoing on when the photons emerge from the holes, the interference patterndisappears. Apparently we only have to “look” at a photon and it changes itsnature completely.Light, then, is a wavelike phenomenon. At least, that is what every-one thoughtuntil Einstein came along with a completely different interpretation of it. Heformulated some equations to account for a phenomenon known as the“photoelectric effect,” which is the effect of light shining on a metal surface,whereby electrons are emitted by the metal, causing an electric current to flow.His calculations proved, theoretically, that light—the photon—is a particle.This was later experimentally verified, and it was for this discovery, not thefamous Theory of Relativity, that Einstein received his Nobel Prize.Later discoveries made by physicists in the 1920s, notably those of the Frencharistocrat Louis de Broglie and the Austrian Erwin Schrödinger, showed that theelectron, one of the fundamental components of all atoms, also has both particleand wave properties.So what exactly is light, this ghostlike, photon entity? It is a particle withwavelike properties, a wave with particle-like properties, a mysterious,diminutive something that actually reacts when we “look” at it. If we leave italone, it behaves like a wave, but as soon as we start to measure its movements,it flips over into particle mode. Classic abracadabra: now you “see” it, andwhen you do, it responds, “curls up,” and changes its nature completely.Another breakthrough experiment, again demonstrating that there is a great dealmore to these wave/particles than first meets the eye, was the “twin particle”experiment conducted in 1982 by Alain Aspect and his team at the Institute ofOptics in Paris.Originally outlined by the theoretical physicist John Bell in 1964, theexperiment was devised to test an apparent absurdity in the rules of quantummechanics, first pointed out in 1935 by Einstein and two colleagues, BorisPodolsky and Nathan Rosen. Basically it concerned one of the most controversialrules of quantum theory, which says that subatomic particles are interconnectedin a way that classical physicists believed was impossible.It was discovered that certain subatomic processes result in the creation ofpairs of particles with identical properties. For example, when an electron andits antimatter opposite—a positron—come into contact and annihilate one another,they coalesce into two light quanta, two photons, which then zoom off inopposite directions at the maximum speed allowed by nature—the speed of light.Quantum physics states that, irrespective of how far apart these twin quantatravel, when they are measured they will always be seen to have the very sameangles of polarization. That is, at the precise moment of measurement of one oranother of these particles, its twin somehow “knows” which angle is to be agreedupon. Consequently there must be some sort of instantaneous communication goingon between them.Another curious feature of quantum mechanics arises from what is known as the“uncertainty principle,” which was first expressed in 1927 by the Germanphysicist Werner Heisenberg. According to this principle, wave/particles do nothave a definite position in space and time, which means that their locations canonly be expressed in terms of variable statistical probabilities collated overthe course of many duplicate experiments. The “uncertainty” arises from the factthat it is not possible to measure simultaneously, with a high degree ofaccuracy, both the position and the momentum of a moving particle. Measuring oneaspect, say the position, affects the momentum, and vice versa. In other words,the very act of observation changes the primary state of the wave/ particle. Wenoted this strange property earlier in the behavior of the photon, which, whentargeted by a photon detector, switches over from wave to particle mode. Thepoint is, in their virgin state, wave/particles do not have exact locations.Depending on how they are measured, they can manifest as a specific point, or asa fuzzy cloud of wave-like energy.The Danish physicist Niels Bohr had a long-standing dispute with Einstein andhis colleagues over the true nature of this so-called action at a distancebetween twin quanta. Einstein rejected the notion because it seemed to implythat there was a “superluminal” (faster than light) transference of informationoperating between the two coordinates, and the Theory of Special Relativitystates absolutely that nothing on a material level of existence can travelfaster than light. Bohr’s answer to the problem, which is generally accepted bythe majority of today’s physicists, was that there was in fact no superluminalcommunication taking place, and that Einstein’s error lay in viewing twinparticles as being independent, self-contained phenomena. Bohr reasoned that ifsubatomic quanta do not really exist until a probe of some kind causes them to“curl up” and manifest one of their measurable properties, then it wasmeaningless to consider them as separate things. Quantum systems in theirnatural, “unmeasured” state are indivisible from one another, and what weobserve as being apparently unrelated subatomic events are in reality in aconstant and immutable state of interconnectedness, even if they are on oppositesides of the universe.When John Bell first thought up an experiment that could verify or disprove thisidea, technology hadn’t yet developed to a level at which it could produceinstruments with an accuracy and sensitivity sufficient to carry it through.This is why it took until the early 1980s for Alain Aspect and his group finallyto take up the challenge.The experiment involved creating a stream of twin photons by heating calciumatoms with high-energy lasers, and then allowing them to fly off in oppositedirections through lengths of pipe. At the end of each pipe were special filtersthat deflected each twin toward either one of two polarization detectors. Theaccuracy of the instrumentation ensured that all the crucial stages in theexperiment could be performed in so brief an instant that there would beinsufficient time for even a beam of light to traverse the space between the twoparticles. And, sure enough, as quantum theory had predicted mathematically,each photon was always able to manifest simultaneously exactly the same angle ofpolarization as its twin. Consequently, physicists now believe that theconnection between two such related quanta must be “nonlocal,” which means thatno matter how far apart they are they always remain composite parts of a single,dynamic, interconnected system.So we know that twin photons generated from a single impact event travel outfrom the source of their origin at the speed of light. Now this is significantbecause, according to the physicist, to an observer moving at such a velocity,time and space as we perceive them would both cease to exist. As speed isincreased, they say, time slows down proportionately, eventually reaching acomplete standstill at the speed of light. Simultaneously, space graduallycontracts, eventually into nothing, no space whatsoever. What scientists arepositing here, therefore, is a dimension of existence in which space and time donot exist. This is why the photon, itself perpetually existing in this strange,“spaceless” world in which time stands still, can instantaneously “transmit”information to a twin—because the impulses carrying the data have no “space” topass through: they are already there, so to speak.Clearly we are talking now of an alternative reality to the one we are allfamiliar with, quite literally another dimension, and it is a world as curiousas any found in fairy tales. In this alternative, quantum world, all entities,in moving at the speed of light, must effectively occupy, at one and the sameinstant, all possible locations along the line of passage. No matter how longthe line as observed from a stationary frame of reference, the photonsimultaneously exists everywhere along it. Like the Holy Ghost or the spirit ofMuhammad or the Buddha, it is “omnipresent.”It is difficult to imagine what it would be like to see the universe through the“eyes” of the photon. There would be no distance between stars and galaxies,continents, you, or me; there would be no space, no ticking of clocks, and noaging. The moment a photon is created, say, inside a distant star, at that verysame instant it could be entering the retina of an observer zillions of milesaway. Its creation and annihilation is in fact one single-impact event, capturedfor all eternity in a frozen, timeless instant.Similarly, if we ourselves could attain the speed of light and cross over intothis other reality, theoretically we would be godlike. Just like the photon wecould exist everywhere simultaneously, “visiting” remote constellations simplyby focusing on them; and our conception and our death would be perceived as oneand the same event, a single, permanent feature in the timeless, unfading fabricof creation. Presumably, once created, everything existing in such a dimensionmust exist literally forever; and what might be observed in the laboratory as,for example, the creation and annihilation of a humble photon is merely across-section of a much greater and more complex reality in which the observedevent, which might have taken only a microsecond or two to unfold, continues tohave a permanent existence independent of time.According to Einstein, extraordinary changes would occur to a physical body ifit could ever reach the light barrier. Its length, together with the length ofthe trajectory in space along which it were traveling, would become zero, andits mass would become infinite, expanding at right angles to the direction ofmotion into a vibrant sheet of wavelike energy of immeasurable size.Now, in crossing the light barrier, any physical entity would, in effect, betranscending the fourth dimension, the line of time, and passing over to a quitedifferent dimension existing beyond time. And if we refer to time as the fourthdimension (after the three dimensions of space: line, plane, solid), then thenext in succession—what I called in my last book the plane of light—is thefifth. This is the “nonlocal” world of the photon quantum.What is emerging here, in fact, is an overall cosmic picture of a succession ofdimensions, from zero point to a line, a line to a plane, a plane to a solid,and subsequently the continuous existence of a solid along the line of time.These four different perspectives are easily recognizable, but the fifth in theascending scale, as physicists have discovered, needs more than a littleintuition to identify. In a later chapter we shall discuss in more detail thesedifferent dimensions, as they provide a convenient way of fixing our position inthe cosmic scheme of things.The point to note here is that this fantastic fifth dimension is definitelythere. We know this because physicists have proven it mathematically. This ishighly significant, because it raises a most interesting question: which of thetwo dimensions is nearer to reality, the time-less, spaceless, nonlocal world ofthe photon, or the world we perceive, a world of sense objects, ticking clocks,night and day, birth and death? The answer, of course, at least as far as thephysicist is concerned, is that the nonlocal world of fundamental quanta is theprimary reality, and that the world perceived in time by our ordinary senses isat best incomplete. This is precisely what Einstein was referring to when hewrote in a letter to the relatives of a deceased colleague, “People like us, whobelieve in physics, know that the distinction between past, present and futureis only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”1 [26_note.html#fo41]What is particularly interesting about this curious nonlocal dimension of theparticle physicist is that it almost perfectly matches the worldview of manyso-called primitive peoples, of the aboriginal shamans, of the writers of manyof the world’s great scriptures and, perhaps most significantly, of the Egyptianpriesthood. Remember the Hopi, whose shamans perceive only an “eternal present”and whose ceremonial dance results in those involved experiencing the collapseof the whole universe into a single event. In a similar vein we have theEgyptians of the Old Kingdom and scriptural writers from every major culture, towhom the concepts of eternity (timelessness) and infinity (spacelessness) werecommon fare.As I described earlier, the psychedelic experience can result in the same kindof impression, that is, of a world in which time seems to stand still. Speakingpersonally, my own “extratemporal” experiences were impressive in the extreme,and it is unlikely that I will ever forget those uplifting feelings that wehuman beings could live forever.Possibly such perceptions are the result of what Colin Wilson sees asright-brain, intuitive thought processes—of the kind he believes to have beenused by the possessors of ancient “lunar” knowledge, which was unified andenabled people to see things as a whole. The Hopi’s concept of an eternalpresent seems to express just such a unified world-view, in which everything inthe entire universe condenses into a conceptual singularity, multiplicitybecomes unity, all becomes one.Now let’s return to another strange idea that has echoes in the present, onethat was first expounded at least as long ago as the time of the Greekphilosophers Pythagoras and Thales. This is the notion that matter itself is“psychic,” that it possesses some kind of awareness of its environment. Probablyvery few scholars have ever given any serious consideration to such a seeminglyfanciful claim. It’s a quaint idea, one might think, but we shouldn’t take it toheart. And yet, curiously, some of the latest discoveries of modern scienceactually lend support to such a view.We have already mentioned the peculiarly responsive behavior of the photon,which behaves like a wave when left unobserved and as a particle when targetedby a detector, and also the now proven reality of nonlocal (timeless, spaceless)interactivity between twin quanta.In an attempt to explain the principle of nonlocality and the idea of a vast webof interconnectedness permeating the whole universe, the University of Londonphysicist David Bohm posited the existence of what he called quantum potential.He saw this as a new kind of energy field that, like gravity, pervades the wholeuniverse, but whose influence does not weaken with distance.Bohm first recognized a possible indication of this quantum potential throughhis work on plasmas, gases comprising a high density of electrons and positiveions (atoms with a positive charge). He noticed that the electrons, once theywere in plasma, began to act in concert, as if they were all part of a greater,interconnected whole. For example, if any impurities were present in the plasma,it would always realign itself and trap all foreign bodies in an exclusionzone—just as a living organism might encase poison in a boil. Bohm observed alsoa similar, orchestrated mass movement of electrons in metals andsuperconductors, with each one acting as if it “knew” what countless billions ofothers were about to do. According to Bohm, particles act in this way throughthe influence of the quantum potential, a subquantum force matrix that somehowcoordinates the movement of the whole.It appears that when plasmas are rejecting impure substances and regeneratingthemselves, they look very similar to swirling masses of well-organizedprotoplasm. This curious “organic” quality led Bohm to comment that he often hadthe impression that the electron sea was, in a sense, “alive.” He possibly didnot intend this to be taken too literally, that the electron mass was living inthe same way as an amoeba, but the evident highly coordinated symmetries of theplasma convinced him that the electrons were responding to one of many“intelligent” orders implicit in the fabric of the universe. He believed thatorder exists in many different degrees, some forms being much more ordered thanothers, and that as a consequence the things we see as disordered at ourordinary levels of perception may in fact be perfectly ordered when viewed in amore objective way.To illustrate this point, imagine yourself as a microcosmic visitor in a livingcell, observing amid a writhing sea of biomolecules—proteins, enzymes, aminoacids, and the like—all busy exchanging energies, whizzing past you in a flurryof hyperactivity. What you would see might appear to be virtual chaos, aseething marketplace full of eager bargain-hunters, pushing, gathering in randomgroups, shouting, haggling. But, in fact, all this frenzied activity, appearingon the face of it to be an unending display of random physical actions, istotally governed by the hidden DNA of the cell, possibly one of the mostorganized and beautifully proportioned structures in the entire universe, andproducing, as a direct result of the cell’s activity, a greater organism of aninfinitely higher order.So these electron symmetries, which Bohm called plasmons, appear to be followinghidden instructions encoded somewhere in the subquantum fabric of the universe.But even where we observe no apparent orchestrated activity, where masses ofelectrons seem to be acting randomly, we may simply be trying to view them onthe wrong scale—rather like our microcosmic onlooker in the biochemicalmarketplace of the cell.Bohm was ultimately to conclude that the ordinary world as seen through orthodoxscientific experimentation is really an illusion, something like a holographicimage, and that somewhere behind this lies a much deeper and more meaningfullevel of reality—the holographic “film,” as it were, from which the imageoriginates. This metaphor of the universe as a living hologram subsequentlybecame the central theme of Bohm’s investigations, which have been summarized byMichael Talbot in his book The Holographic Universe. We can take another look atthe wider implications of this important concept later.Bohm’s views on consciousness in relation to matter are also interesting. Hebelieved that consciousness itself is actually a subtle, highly rarefied form ofmatter and that forms of intelligence exist, in correspondingly differentdegrees, in all kinds of material substances. “The ability of form to beactive,” he said, “is the most characteristic feature of mind, and we havesomething that is mindlike already with the electron.”2 [26_note.html#fo42]As it happens, Gurdjieff and Ouspensky were saying much the same thing in theearly part of the twentieth century, that everything, including all our finerthoughts and aspirations, has a material existence and could, theoretically, beweighed and measured. On the subject of matter as we know it, Gurdjieff had thisto say: “In addition to its cosmic properties, every substance also possessespsychic properties, that is, a certain degree of intelligence.”3[26_note.html#fo43]Do these observations seem at all familiar? They sound decidedly “Greek” to me.Bohm’s electrons, negatively charged wave/particles that orbit the nuclei ofatoms at velocities approaching the speed of light, are what give matter itssubstance, its apparent solidity. And if electrons exhibit “the mostcharacteristic feature of mind,” then this means that the Greeks were right allalong and that all material things are endowed with “psychic” properties.In fact, Bohm then took this highly mystical worldview a giant leap farther bysuggesting that not only are “inanimate” objects like rocks and stones in someway alive and intelligent, but so too is all energy, all time, allspace—everything. As we noted earlier, Sri Aurobindo expressed a similar viewwhen he said that if there were a single point in the universe that were notconscious, the whole universe itself would be unconscious.The principle of nonlocal interconnectedness is hereby taken to the absolutelimit, where even so-called empty space is seen to be full of meaning, brimmingwith an infinite store of primordial intelligence, the underlying formativematrix for everything existing, including ourselves. Thus all the phenomena weobserve in the physical universe are simply “ripples” on the surface of anunimaginably vast ocean of deeper meaning. This hidden world Bohm called theimplicate or enfolded order, the subsurface dimension that gives rise to thephenomena we observe with our senses, in the explicate, unfolded order. So themanifestations of all forms are the product of endless enfoldings and unfoldingsbetween these two very different but mutually interconnected dimensions.In this way a wave/particle, like an electron, is described not as one thing,but as a nebulous stream of interchangeable energies enfolded throughout thewhole of space. When it is measured by an investigator, what is observed ismerely one property of the “greater electron,” which has simply responded tosome probe or other by unfolding into the explicate order.Obviously the ancient Greeks would have known nothing of the strange propertiesof the subatomic particle. Nevertheless, they still somehow managed to establisha view on the mindlike nature of materiality that accords with the latestdiscoveries of modern science. How? Was it a lucky guess? Did someone perhapstell them? Or was it just plain old-fashioned intuition? Of the threepossibilities, I suspect that the first is the least likely. For reasons thatwill become clear a little later, I am inclined to believe that the Greeksreceived this wisdom from their predecessors, but that intuition played a largepart in their understanding of the teachings they inherited.So what else is “Greek” in this present era of scientific discovery, with itsparticle consciousness, photon “telepathy,” and so forth? Is there any otherknowledge that these ancient peoples possessed that might be relevant to thisenquiry? Indeed there is: there is the knowledge that they received directlyfrom the Egyptians in the form of the Hermetic Code, which says that everythingin this universe manifests strictly according to musical principles.Once again we can see how strangely “modern” is this view, because scientiststhemselves are now speaking more and more in terms of a musical universe thatendlessly vibrates, and of physical phenomena all possessing unique resonancesof their own.For example, in his book Other Worlds, Paul Davies describes the way electronsorbit the nuclei of atoms in a regular order, whereby only stationary patternswill occur. He compares the phenomenon to the standing wave-pattern of air in aparticular set of organ pipes, where only certain established notes arepermitted because the patterns of air-waves must fit into the geometry of thepipes. Similarly, only certain “notes” (frequencies, energies) are accommodatedby the atom. When transitions occur between the normal energy levels, electronsemit characteristic colors—streams of photons—and these are the visual evidenceof what Davies calls “this subatomic music.” He continues:We can therefore regard the spectrum of light from an atom as similar to thepattern of sound of a musical instrument. Each instrument produces acharacteristic sound, and just as the timbre of a violin differs markedly fromthat of a drum or a clarinet, so the color mixture of light from a hydrogen atomis characteristically distinct from the spectrum of a carbon or uranium atom. Inboth cases there is a deep association between the internal vibrations(oscillating membranes, undulating electron waves) and the external waves(sound, light).4 [26_note.html#fo44]There are other musical relationships between atoms and their components. Forexample, all atoms are members of a whole, integrated family, ranging from thelightest, hydrogen, with one electron tracing a lone orbit around its nucleus,to the densest, heavily radioactive atoms, which have many electrons orbitingthe nucleus in seven permitted energy levels. Remember that there are sevensuccessive “energy levels” in the major musical scale. Obviously the eighth,transcendental “note” of this fundamental atomic scale is the whole phenomenon,consisting of all atoms everywhere.Further, a recently developed classification system known as the theory ofquantum chromodynamics suggests that beneath the materiality of the atom thereare other essentially musical symphonies being played by nature. Scientists arecurrently classifying a certain category of subatomic particles according to asystem known as the eightfold way. The theory is so called because it putscertain routinely observed “particle molecules” known as baryons, pions, andmesons together in families of eight. The term was originally coined by theAmerican physicist Murray Gell-Mann and was intended as a pun. He was apparentlyfamiliar with the “eightfold path to enlightenment” devised by the Buddha, andpresumably felt that the name would add a lighter note to his complexmathematical theory. Doubtless the idea that the Buddha’s belief system is inany way scientific would make Gell-Mann’s toes curl. But, being unashamedly whatthe science writer Richard Morris has referred to as “one of those deludedmystics who manage to see parallels between theories in physics and ideasassociated with Eastern mysticism,” I would suggest that this is precisely thecase, that it is no mere coincidence that the Buddha’s musical interpretation ofreality should so easily and naturally blend in with the foremost ideas oftoday’s scientists. The “eightfold way” of the Buddha is a variation on theHermetic Code, and like the “eight steps of learning” of his Chinese counterpartConfucius, it was founded on the idea that the whole universe is an essentiallymusical structure and that to realize this, to tune in to this fundamentalreality, one had to conform to the laws and forces controlling it.Thus, if we look closer at this chromodynamic system of classification, we shallsee a quite familiar pattern emerge.There are supposedly eight low-mass baryon wave/particles making one octet,eight pions forming a second octet and eight vector-mesons making athird—twenty-four in all. Now, this same family of particles also comprises, inaddition to the octets, a complex triplet. This means that each of the eightparticles in an octet is also a triplet, made up of three smaller particles,which Gell-Mann called “quarks.” As we see, the structure of each octet (oroctave) of triplets is identical to the symmetry of the I Ching, with its eighttrigrams. And there is more. Gell-Mann’s theory originally called for threekinds of quarks, called up, down, and strange—a subatomic “trigram.” But, then,to these were subsequently added three more types of quark, called charm, bottomand top. Enter the hexagram. All we need now to complete the picture is thenumber 64. It would be highly fitting if we could find it, because sixty-four isnot only the number of hexagrams in the I Ching, it is also the numbercomprising the council of Brahmins who, according to legend, foretold of theimpending birth of the Buddha. In fact, as I pointed out in The InfiniteHarmony, this particular number has surfaced not in quantum chromodynamics, butin what is known in physics as superstring theory.The central idea in superstring theory is that subatomic wave/particles are inreality infinitesimally small strings made of space. These strings vibrateendlessly over an infinite range of frequencies, and their interactions giverise to the observed characteristics of all known particles. You really can’tget more intellectually obscure than the theory of superstrings, and I ampersonally completely baffled by it, involving as it does no less than tendifferent dimensions (three of space, one of time, and six of God-knows-what)and a system of higher mathematics guaranteed to make the layman’s eyes glazeover in seconds. But no matter; all we need to know here is that this incrediblycomplicated system has created a superstring, out of nothing but space, that hasprecisely 64 degrees of movement associated with it. This supersymmetric systemcan apparently account for all subatomic quanta, and is capable, says thescience writer Timothy Ferris, of “drawing all matter into an elegant picture inwhich particles’ attributes are seen as the vibrations of strings, like notesstruck on Pythagoras’ lyre.”5 [26_note.html#fo45]So we’re back to Pythagoras again, the original philosopher, a contemporary ofthe Buddha born five and a half centuries before Christ, who taught thateverything in the universe obeys musical laws and who, like the yogis of India,believed that matter was “psychic.” And both of these ideas, as we have seen,have now gained a metaphysical foothold in the mind of the modern scientist.Now, if consciousness is material in some way—as Gurdjieff and Bohm bothbelieved—and if matter is conscious, though on an entirely different scale, thencould the higher possibly influence the lower, and vice versa? Pythagoras wouldvery likely say yes to the former proposition, possibly citing the mysteriouspowers of Orpheus and Amphion as examples. But he would also, being what todaymight be called a natural mystic, have believed that the psychic presence inmatter could indeed influence human beings. People today of a sensitive orintuitive inclination often feel that nature speaks to us in many differentways. Mountains and forests, for example, as many people instinctively know,have a particularly powerful presence. So too do many ancient artifacts, such asthe Great Pyramid or the Taj Mahal, the Cathedral of Notre Dame, or a statuelike the Sphinx.Ouspensky recognized a similar close relationship between himself and nature. Hedescribes one of his drug-induced experiences in his second major classic, A NewModel of the Universe: “Everything was living, everything was conscious ofitself. Everything spoke to me and could speak to everything. Particularlyinteresting were the houses and other buildings that I passed, especially theold houses. They were living things, full of thoughts, feelings, moods andmemories. The people who lived in them were their thoughts, feelings, moods.”6[26_note.html#fo46]In another passage, he preempts the modern physicist by describing the world hewas seeing as “a world of very complicated mathematical relations”: “this meansa world in which everything is connected, in which nothing exists separately andin which at the same time the relations between things have a real existenceapart from the things themselves; or possibly, ‘things’ do not exist and onlyrelations exist.”7 [26_note.html#fo47]Sri Aurobindo saw the world in exactly the same way. In his view, all apparentseparateness on the physical plane is simply an illusion. In the state ofenlightenment, he said, the unity of everything is perceived as a livingreality, but as one descends from the higher to the lower states ofconsciousness, a progressive “law of fragmentation” takes over and “things”appear once more as isolated, separate entities.And science, of course, now supports this view. As we have seen, all subatomicparticles are also waves of different frequencies, and this means thateverything is composed of a vast, interconnected web of interference patterns.Talbot, in The Holographic Universe, suggests that our brains mathematicallyconstruct this so-called objective reality by decoding these varying frequenciesthat are really projections from another dimension existing beyond space andtime. So perhaps the great ocean of waves and frequencies “out there” lookssolid and real to us only because our brains automatically reprogram all this“fluid” information into the familiar form of the sense objects making up ourworld. In reality, however, everything is a vast sea of highly resonantinterference patterns. The sun and stars and the planet we live on, the GreatPyramid and the Sphinx, even the brain itself—all these physical structures arein essence composed of overlapping waves.In the last chapter we discussed the work of Robert Jahn and Brenda Dunne, whoseexperiments with the randomevent generator and the “pin-ball” machine providedcompelling evidence for psychokinesis. Having found evidence of this ability ina large proportion of their subjects, they came to some interesting conclusionsconcerning the possible nature of such a process. They proposed that since allphysical phenomena possess a particle/wave duality, then perhaps consciousnessdoes too. When in a particle-like state, consciousness would be localized insidethe skull, but when in a wave mode, like all waves, it can produce effects at adistance.In a similar vein, though not in relation to psychokinesis, the Cambridgemathematician Roger Penrose has also considered the effects of quantum processesin respect of the workings of the human mind. When speaking of “action at adistance” between twin particles (non-local quantum correlations), he suggeststhat such phenomena could be involved in conscious thought processes over largeregions of the brain itself, and that perhaps there is a direct relation betweena “highly coherent quantum state” and a correspondingly high degree ofawareness.Jahn and Dunne have suggested that phenomena themselves are actually products ofthe combined interference patterns created by the wave motions of matter and thewavelike aspect of consciousness. They believe that psychokinesis occurs throughan exchange of certain information between physical things and the human mind,not as a single directional flow from one to the other, but rather as a mutuallyinteracting “resonance” operating between the two. These resonances soundsomething like the relations between “things” described by Ouspensky in thepassage quoted earlier. Significantly Jahn and Dunne reported that the moresuccessful volunteers often described a sensation of feeling “in tune” with thedevice.Again, this is precisely what Indian philosophers and yogis have been sayingsince the dawn of their culture, that matter is responsive and that it iscomposed of resonating interference patterns, principally those of light itself.In his major work On Yoga, Sri Aurobindo describes a sphere of existence beyondspace and time comprising a “multicolored infinity of vibrations,” of waves.Physical reality, he said, is simply a “mass of stable light”8[26_note.html#fo48]—which is precisely the conclusion I came to way back when Iwas experimenting with various hallucinogens. But all of this “stable light,”according to the yogi, also possesses a measured degree of consciousness. Thisis apparently how yogi masters are able to influence the physical world: theyhave perfected a way of making direct contact with its rudimentaryconsciousness. Yogananda says much the same thing in his book Autobiography of aYogi—that matter is simply “an undifferentiated mass of light.” The “law ofmiracles,” he said, “is operable by any man who has realized that the essence ofcreation is light.”9 [26_note.html#fo49] So light has a very special place inthe belief system of Hindus, which of course is why their most important annualfestival—Diwali—is known as the festival of light. In fact, Hindus, Buddhists,and Eastern philosophers in general all emphasize the importance of light intheir cosmological view of the world. Tune in to it, they say, and a whole newworld unfolds. And so it would, for science tells us that light, the photonquantum, exists and operates in a timeless, spaceless, nonlocal realm. This, inmy view, is the “eternal” world of the Hopi shaman, who can hold a “spaceless”universe virtually in the palm of his hand; the “infinite” world of the Egyptianpriesthood, who taught that the soul of the godking can exist for “eternity”;the “heaven” identified by all the great revelationists in history, by peoplewho have succeeded in glimpsing beyond the veil and bequeathed to us theirilluminating testimonies of the extraordinary things they witnessed.And, clearly, the prime mover in this nonlocal dimension is light, the HolyGhost. In this chapter we have seen how the modern scientist interprets thisimportant phenomenon. In the following section we shall see what the primitivedreamers of former ages had to say about it."},{"pageContent":"5Further LightThe phenomenon of light is celebrated in all of the major religions. If you readyour Bible, Koran, or Upanishads, you will see that it is always spoken of inglowing terms.In Autobiography of a Yogi, Yogananda quotes freely from the Hebrew andChristian Scriptures to emphasize the importance of light with respect tomankind’s innate spiritual quest. He notes, for example, that God’s very firstcommand was, “Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3). He also quotes from Matthew6:22, a verse that runs close to Jahn and Dunne’s idea of consciousnessoperating in tune with the wavelike nature of reality: “The light of the body isin the eye. If, therefore, thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full oflight.”In the Koran, in the chapter entitled “Light,” Muhammad uses the term todescribe the creative power of Allah: “Allah is the light of the heavens and theearth. . . . Light upon light, Allah guideth unto His Light whom He will.”Similarly, in ancient Persia the principal god, Ahura Mazda, was associatedspecifically with light. It is said that when the prophet Zoroaster achievedenlightenment, it was through the agency of a spirit that led him to theformless light of the creator. The alchemical element fire was so sacred to theZoroastrians because at night it was a continuous source of the creative lightof Ahura Mazda.In early Greece, the sun and its light were revered in the form of the godsHelios and Apollo. According to myth, Helios, father of the hero Phaeton, hadthe ability to “see all things” and was enthroned amid rainbows (light) and thehours, attended by the four seasons. An almost identical description of thisall-seeing creator is to be found in Revelation, where St. John depicts Godsitting on his throne in heaven, encircled by the colors of the rainbow (“sevenlamps of fire,” Revelation 4:5).The traditional idea of a sun-king is an important one, appearing in culturesall around the world. In ancient Egypt, a pharaoh’s name often ended in thesuffix Re or Ra (“sun”) to indicate his divine status, as in Menkaura (GreekMycerinus), alleged builder of the third Pyramid of Giza.Similarly, in Central and South America, Aztec, Inca, and Maya legends all speakof an ancient god, a cosmic creator who appeared from the eastern sea soon aftera major catastrophe had obscured the sun. Known by various names—Kontiki,Viracocha, Kukulcan, Quetzalcoatl—this god is said to have brought back the sunand its light, and with it civilization and a new way of being.This ancient theme of light after darkness is the key to virtually all midwinterfestivals in the northern hemisphere. Like the Zoroastrians, the peoples ofBronze Age Europe used fire burning through the night to invoke the return ofthe sun, its warmth, and its light.In numerous other long-standing traditions, teachers, priests, and shamans haveconsistently attributed to the sun and its light, or the stars and their light,divine or supernatural significance. The Egyptian priest-astronomers, however,were the first to place the sun (Ra) at the center of a cosmological beliefsystem. Now this, I would suggest, was not simply an abstract notion of givingthanks and praise to the giver of life. Nor was it just the sun itself that wasof prime importance, but rather its light. The Great Pyramid was known to theearly Egyptians as Khuti, “The Lights,” not only because of the dazzlingreflective properties of its original, highly polished casing of white turalimestone, but because light itself was the key to their entire system ofbelief. This is an important and until now unrecognized feature of Egyptianmetaphysics, and it represents something of a departure from recent suggestionsthat the Egyptian religion was either a “star cult” or a “sun cult.” In reality,it was neither and it was both, the common feature being light itself, which isemitted by all stars. In later dynasties, major temples were carefullyconstructed along axes aligned with the first rays of the rising sun on specificsolstices or equinoxes, a particularly striking example of which is the Templeof the Sun—Ammon Ra—at Karnak. Ammon, or Amun, the “Hidden One,” was said to bethe power behind the sun (that is, its light) that keeps the balance of life andcreation in the universe.Given the fact that the sun is the dominant star in our sky, it seems perfectlynatural that early man should have revered it in one form or another. But theEgyptian worldview, that mankind’s future “spiritual” evolution is in some wayconnected with the starry world, the sun included, was not simply idol worshipbased on blind faith or primitive superstition. On the contrary, it was acarefully thought out scientific theory, the theory of transcendental evolution,that holds that life, or consciousness, has the potential to evolve, through thesystematic application of the principles of the Hermetic Code, into higherstates of being, into cosmic scales of awareness.The ancient Egyptians, I believe, saw consciousness, or “spirituality,” likeeverything else, as a form of resonance operating over a whole range ofhermetically related frequencies. So the more harmonious the mind becomes, thefiner and more penetrating are the frequencies at which it operates andtherefore the higher the scale of its psychological or spiritual existence. And,to the Egyptians of the early dynasties, this “higher scale,” as we havepreviously noted in the astronomical alignments of the Sphinx and the Pyramidsof Giza, seems to have been closely associated with the stars, with Orion’sBelt, with Sirius, the constellation of Leo, and in fact every other majorconstellation in the great wheel of precession, whose immensely long cycle, aswe noted in a previous chapter, is encoded in some of mankind’s most ancientmyths.In this way we can see that the Giza necropolis is not simply an old, worn-outsignpost showing the way to Tombstone. It is, in effect, a giant cosmic pointer,one that naturally directs the attention of all contemplating its mysteriesskyward, toward the higher, stellar scale of existence. More than that,incorporated within the dimensions of the Great Pyramid is the sophisticatedmathematical relationship known as pi, which is first and foremost an expressionof the Hermetic Code, the code by which all evolution proceeds, from DNA upward,to the conscious mind of mankind—and beyond. And then, significantly, we havethe old Egyptian name for the Great Pyramid: Khuti, “The Lights.” In my view weare being told here, in clear and precise terms, that the vehicle by whichconsciousness can transcend onto this higher scale is none other than lightitself. Light and consciousness, in other words, are complementary aspects ofthe ongoing evolutionary process of creating higher and more sophisticated formsof “life.”We can describe such a process very easily in musical or hermetic terms. We knowthat there are seven fundamental notes in an octave— Do, re, mi, fa, so, la,ti—and that there are seven fundamental color frequencies in the spectrum oflight: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The eighth note,Do, of an octave is a repeat, at a higher pitch or frequency, of the first basenote, also Do. Being in turn the first base note of the next evolving octave,this eighth note automatically becomes the medium through which the impetuscreated by the given series of notes transcends onto the scale above. In thesame way, the eighth “note” in the visible scale of the electromagneticspectrum—white light, Yogananda’s “creative rays”—can also be envisaged ashaving transcendental properties, being the medium through which evolutionaryconsciousness can move on to a higher scale and so realize its optimumpotential. Thus we might say that this quantum leap, from the line of time, thefourth dimension, to the plane of light, the fifth dimension, represents onefundamental octave of evolution, the magical transition from the lower Darwinianscale of existence up into the infinitely higher scale, the home of the mythicalgods of the Egyptian pantheon.The rather startling implication is that the ancients’ vision of an eternalsphere—“heaven,” or the starry world—and the nonlocal plane of light describedby today’s physicists, are each referring to one and the same level of reality.In other words, the mysterious quantum universe in which light exists, with itsinfinite web of instantaneous information highways and its zero dimensionality,has been “seen” at first hand and subsequently described by the priesthood of acivilization that existed five thousand years ago.Obviously this is a personal and somewhat speculative interpretation of thereligion of the Egyptians. I’m out on a limb, so to speak. But years ofreflecting on the overall effect of Egyptian metaphysics on the human race, onthe way it has permeated through to every major religion in history and even, aswe have seen, into the disciplined mind of the modern scientist, has convincedme that the orthodox view of this ancient culture is unjustifiably restrictedand ungenerous. These people, I believe, knew as much about life, the humanpsyche, and the universe at large as we do now. I would go even further andsuggest that they may have understood a great deal more, albeit in a differentway. Clearly there were men of unparalleled genius living back then in Egypt. Wehave unquestionable proof of this: we have the Great Pyramid, “The Lights,” thegreatest and most complex building ever constructed in stone, we have thedetailed precessional data encoded in their myths and, perhaps most importantly,we have the Hermetic Code, the “theory of everything.”Having established that the Egyptian religion was, in fact, a theory ofevolution, we can go beyond theory and look for a practical application of theprinciples involved. To do this, we need to focus on what is known as the“pyramid ritual.” According to Bauval and Gilbert, this was the initiationceremony conducted inside the Great Pyramid that was designed to assist the soulof the dead pharaoh on its transcendental journey to the stars.Basically, they believe that it involved two ceremonies. The first of these tookplace in the Queen’s Chamber, whose southern shaft is now believed to have beentargeted on Sirius—the star of the goddess Isis—as it culminated at the meridianin 2550 BCE. Here the son of the dead pharaoh traditionally performed a ritualcalled “opening the mouth.” This was carried out with an implement made ofmeteoric iron—the sacred adze—that was used to pierce the embalmed mouth of themummy, an act that was supposed to restore new life to the pharaoh. After this,the second ceremony was performed in the King’s Chamber, whereby the soul of thepharaoh, now charged with a new kind of life force, was freed to fly up thesouthern shaft, which Bauval suggests was originally targeted on Zeta Orionis,the star of Osiris.On first impression one might think that these two rituals, however broad andimaginative in concept, served no practical purpose whatsoever, being merely anembellishment of an abstract notion of a life after death. But in my view thiswhole ceremony was merely an exemplar and as such was not designed exclusivelyfor the liberation of the soul of one dead pharaoh. The ritual was for allinitiates and could be performed by anyone virtually anywhere, with or without aGreat Pyramid. It is a detailed description of a simple but highly effectivealchemical “trick” performed by the creative mind, whereby consciousness is putfirst into a fundamentally passive mode, symbolized by the feminine aspect ofuniversal creation, the goddess Isis. This does not mean a mind that is idlypassive, like one absorbed in, say, watching television, but one that isconsciously and actively receptive—a passive force in tune with the greatercosmos, as opposed to an empty receptacle soaking up images from a screen. Amind properly controlled in this way automatically becomes a fertile place inwhich new perceptions, new concepts, can germinate and come to fruition. Theentirely new, active mode of thought engendered in this process is symbolized inEgyptian ritual by the transcendental journey made by the soul to the home ofthe god Osiris. This simply represents a new level of consciousness, a higherdegree of cosmic awareness. Intuition, one suspects, is one of itsmanifestations.So the pyramid ritual is a symbolic description of the process of transcendentalevolution, the process by which the human mind ascends to a higher scale ofexistence in an essentially musically structured universe. This, I believe, isthe key message of the Egyptian mysteries, and it is precisely this same ideathat lies at the root of the world’s major religions, all of which were set inmotion by men who fully understood, and lived by, the principle of psychologicalharmony. This is why they repeatedly emphasized the importance of composing themind in a certain way, through meditation, contemplation, prayer that ends in asilent gesture of submission, or whatever. These exercises were designed tocreate a state in which the mind is open—like the pharaoh’s mouth—and soreceptive to greater cosmic forces. And what are these forces? Well, accordingto such as the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the yogis of India, these forces are,in fact, electromagnetic.The vehicle of all our visual impressions is, of course, light itself. A passivemind with a visual cortex focused on its environment absorbs light quanta by thebillion. This is normal; it is what our retinas are designed to do. But possiblya mind operating not at an ordinary level of awareness but in a state of“optimum psychological resonance” might be capable not only of absorbingexternal stimuli—light quanta, impressions, and so on—but also of assimilatingthem in a vastly more productive and effective way than is normally possible.This, I would suggest, is the true basis of medieval alchemy, a kind of“biometaphysical” assimilation of impressions, whereby a balanced mixture ofpsychological elements is fused together to make spiritual “gold.” Put simply,this is the process of the “transmutation” of one’s impressions into finer, muchmore precious “substances,” namely concepts. We should note here that the Arabicword alchemy has its roots in Egypt, which was known in old Arabia as the Landof the Chems—the Egyptians. Alchemy means, literally, “the Egyptian way.” It isalso the origin of our own word chemistry, a philological legacy that, ifnothing else, demonstrates just how potent and far-reaching these Egyptianinfluences can be.It may seem something of an oversimplification of this elaborate pyramid ritualto say that it is nothing more than a description of a single alchemicalprocess, a simple trick of the mind. But then it has frequently beenacknowledged, particularly among scientists, that the most elegant ideas andtheories are often the most simple, sometimes so much so that, once known andunderstood, they become obvious. Perhaps, then, these Egyptian mysteries, whosepurpose must have been obvious to the people who created them, can also beunderstood without recourse to masses of technical data—simply by using basiccommon sense.In fact, the “trick” in question is straightforward only in theory. In practice,it can be a most difficult thing to accomplish, at least for sustained periods.Yogis say that it takes years to master the art completely, to learn to composethe mind for periods long enough for new concepts to take root within it. Butthis is leading on to wider psychological issues involving detailed systems ofself-discipline, the development of powers of concentration, of the will, and soon. We can return to this question in a later chapter. For the present, it isthe theory itself that is of primary concern and in particular the idea that“creative light rays”—the Egyptian khuti—play a fundamental part in the wholemusically structured process of evolution.Khuti itself—the Great Pyramid—was known in Chaldea as Urim middin, which means“Lights-measures.” The name is significant because it suggests that the monumentwas something more than an elite place of initiation or a mere symbol for asolar cult: that in fact the Egyptians had quite literally encoded within itmeasurable data relating to the phenomenon of light.When one thinks of “lights-measures,” the first thing that comes to mind is thespeed at which light travels, which is about 300,000 kilometers per second.Physicists regard this speed as an absolute physical law; nothing, they say, cantravel faster than light. In Einstein and Herman Minkowski’s famous equationrelating energy to matter, E = mc2, c2 is the constant velocity of lightmultiplied by itself. The square of the constant, therefore, is an importantnumber in theoretical physics because, when it is multiplied by a factor ofm—the mass of a given thing—it gives a value for the amount of nuclear energylatent within it.So, to the obvious question: is it possible that this particular“lights-measure”—the velocity of light—is encoded somewhere within the design ofthe Great Pyramid, or in texts relating to it, or in the Giza necropolis as awhole? Most academics would no doubt regard such a notion with the same kind ofderision that theories about Atlantis and holy space-invaders have engenderedover the years. After all, these people supposedly hadn’t even invented thewheel back in 2500 BCE, so how could they possibly have had any inkling ofscientific absolutes?Despite such an obvious contradiction, we can be reasonably sure that theEgyptians, like today’s physicists, regarded light as the ultimate phenomenon, ayardstick by which all things could be measured. This is not to say that theyever attempted to calculate the velocity of moving objects in terms of distanceand time, but that they measured or perceived things—light included—as forms ofresonance obeying musical laws. These are laws, remember, that were expressedsymbolically, not only through the pi convention but also through myth, inparticular the myth of the original pantheon of eight gods who, it is said, allappeared simultaneously out of an “island of flame,” an island of light.Light, therefore, seems to have been viewed as the most vibrant of allphenomena, an octave of resonance operating at absolute or optimumfrequencies—in effect a musical constant.In the light octave, as in any other, there are eight fundamental “notes”—orcolors—the seven primary ones and white. The combined harmonic value of theseeight “notes” corresponds to the overall frequency at which light resonates—theconstant rate. This concept of an “eight-note constant” is particularlyinteresting, because if we follow the example of Minkowski and multiply it byitself we end up with a value for the square of the constant of sixty-four“notes.” This is significant because the Greeks associated the Great Pyramidwith another interesting number relating to an “Egyptian” system known as theMagic Square of Mercury (Mercury is a Romanized name for Hermes/Thoth). This isthe number 2,080, the sum of all the factors from 1 to 64. The “Minkowskishuffle,” it seems, is a very old trick indeed.I’m no scientist, and higher mathematics gives me vertigo, but it seems to me,as I have stated previously, that the modern quantum view of a nonlocal universein which light, the omnipresent Holy Ghost, is the prime mover, was at the veryleast intuitively perceived by the metaphysicians of ancient Egypt. Let’s saythey somehow attained a higher level of consciousness, which enabled them totune in to the quantum field, to penetrate the plane of light, where everything,as it were, resonates at the constant rate. (Actually there may be certainevolutionary processes operating in the universe that resonate at the constantrate squared, and even at frequencies infinitely higher—but that’s anotherchapter in an ongoing saga. We can come back to this idea at a later stage.)Of course, there is one fundamental difference between the old Egyptian scienceof “lights-measures” and the modern quantum description of light: the formerscience not only encompasses “values” for the constant, and the square of theconstant, it also recognizes the phenomenon of light as an essentially musicalor hermetic manifestation, an octave. More than that, this visible spectrum ofseven combined frequencies also has three principal aspects connected with it,which we identify as the three “primary” colors. So light is, in effect, a“triple-octave” structure; it is an electromagnetic manifestation of the pisymmetry, the Hermetic Code.It is now generally accepted that this same code is the basic blue-print of thegeometry of the Great Pyramid, “The Lights,” whose height (481.3949 feet) standsin relation to its base perimeter (3023.16 feet) as the radius of a circlestands in relation to its circumference. Therefore, if we multiply the height ofthe Great Pyramid by 2pi, we obtain a precise value for the monument’s baseperimeter: 481.3949 × 3.14 × 2 = 3023.16 feet.It so happens that the value of pi is incorporated in the dimensions of anotherunique monument, also a pyramid, located on the opposite side of the Atlantic.This is the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacán in Mexico, which is also, in myview, dedicated to the phenomenon of light. Whereas the angle of slope of theGreat Pyramid is 51 degrees, 51 minutes, the angle of slope of the Pyramid ofthe Sun is approximately 43.5 degrees. The base perimeter is 2932.8 feet and itsheight is (or was) approximately 233.5 feet. Obviously the 2pi relationshipcannot be applied here, because the Pyramid of the Sun has a much gentler angleof slope than that of the Great Pyramid. But if we substitute 4pi into theequation and multiply it by the height of the Pyramid of the Sun, we once againobtain an accurate value for the measurement of its perimeter: 233.5 feet × 3.14× 2 = 2932.76 feet.1 [26_note.html#fo51]What we have here, then, are two quite distinct “solar” cultures, separated by agreat expanse of ocean and (possibly) time: the builders of both went to a greatdeal of trouble to construct gigantic pyramids with dimensions and proportionsindicating a knowledge of the pi relationship.And there is more. This same ratio has also been identified very recently in thestructural dimensions of other important megalithic constructions of the ancientworld, namely Stonehenge and another example of a pyramid, Silbury Hill inWiltshire, both in southern England.In his book Thoth, Architect of the Universe, Ralph Ellis points out that thetwo central pillars in the “inner horseshoe” formation at Stonehenge, the two“trilithons,” which were originally capped by a slightly overhanging, curvedlintel, would in their original state have given a graphic representation of theGreek letter pi. There is nothing particularly remarkable about this in itself.As Ellis himself acknowledges, there are “Arcs de Triomphes” in many ancient andmodern cities. But, according to Ellis, the dimensions of the two trilithons,the most finely dressed stones of the entire monument, confirm mathematicallythat the pi symmetry was recognized by its designer.Ellis uses as his units of measure what he calls the Zil yard and the Zil foot.A Zil yard, equivalent in length to the Old Saxon yard, is 1.004 meters. In the1960s, Alexander Thom, a professor of engineering at Oxford University,established that Neolithic sites such as Stonehenge, Avebury, and many others inWestern Europe had been designed using a unit he called the Megalithic yard,equivalent to 0.83 meters. But Ellis believes that his ancient measures areequally valid factors in the geometry and dimensions of such monuments asStonehenge. His line of reasoning in this respect is a little too involved todetail here, but if we take the Zil foot as being one third of an Old Saxon yardand use it to measure the height of the two trilithons and the distance betweenthe centers of them, we find that all-too-familiar ratio: height, 22 Zil feet,width, 7.Ellis shows further that this same ratio is incorporated in the dimensions ofthe step pyramid of Silbury Hill, which is now believed to have been constructedin the same era as the Pharaoh Zoser’s Third Dynasty step pyramid at Saqqarah.Whereas the Great Pyramid has a perimeter equal to 2 × pi × height, and theperimeter of the Pyramid of the Sun in Mexico is equal to 4 × pi × height, theSilbury pyramid’s perimeter, whose angle of slope is exactly 30 degrees, isequal to 3.5 × pi × height.2 [26_note.html#fo52]We thus have four extremely ancient structures from widely separated cultures,three of them giant pyramids, the dimensions and proportions of which allindicate a knowledge on the part of their designers of the pi relationship. Inthe case of Stonehenge and Silbury Hill, apart from their dimensions orastronomical associations, they stand mute, unsupported by any long-standingmyths relating to their creators. Fortunately this is not the case with thecultures of Egypt and ancient America, whose legends abound with storiesdescribing the godlike qualities of the creators of their extant architecturalmasterpieces. And when we begin to compare the myths from the Americas and fromEgypt we find that the pyramid structure is by no means the only common factor.Graham Hancock has already pointed out the similarity in the facial features ofthe god Viracocha depicted in sculptures in South America, and Osiris in Egypt,both of whom are portrayed as bearded, light-skinned Caucasians. In addition, wehave the evidence of the structures themselves, all of which have beenconstructed out of blocks of immense proportions. But there is also anothersignificant common factor in the traditions of these two cultures, and this islight.We have heard how Osiris and his resilient band of survivors materializedsimultaneously from an “island of flame.” And the most characteristic feature ofa flame, of course, is the light it generates, which again reminds us of the oldEgyptian name for the Great Pyramid: khuti—“The Lights.”In some of the legends of the Maya, the god Viracocha is said to have landedwith a number of companions on the shores of the eastern sea following some kindof global catastrophe so calamitous that it had even obscured the sun. Viracochaapparently then set about civilizing the Americas, bringing back the sun and itslight. So, in the context of this ancient myth, as with the myths of the life ofOsiris, light and the wisdom of this great civilizer are very closely connected.As we have noted, the idea that spiritual or psychological harmony isintrinsically connected with light is one of the most enduring in history. Readthe book of Revelation, for example, one of the most powerful of scriptures, andyou will see musical structures and references to light leaping out from everyone of its twenty-two chapters. Similarly, the Passion itself, an eight-dayevent that culminated in Christ transcending onto the greater scale above, is inessence virtually identical to the myth surrounding the life, death, andresurrection of Osiris. Significantly, the “Passion” of Osiris, which was firstenacted publicly by the Egyptian priesthood in Abydos during the TwelfthDynasty, consisted of eight consecutive performances.According to Christian tradition, on the eighth day of the Passion, Jesusfloated upward on a cloud to heaven. The cloud is not without symbolic meaning,because it was through a cloud that God is said to have spoken to Noah and laterto Moses of his covenant, symbolized by the rainbow, the spectrum of light, the“seven spirits” of the God of Revelation.Many other examples of religious doctrines embracing one or another aspect ofmusical theory have been discussed at length in The Infinite Harmony. But theimportant point about all of these belief systems is that through this commonprinciple of a harmonious development up through the earthly scale of ourorigins and on to a “heavenly” scale, these highly potent teachings,anachronistic though they may appear, are even today continually drawing theattention of billions of devotees upward. It’s as if all of mankind’s higherthoughts and aspirations are inevitably light-bound, heading—quite literally—forthe sun and the stars.The fact that these belief systems are still forces to be reckoned with suggeststo me that “religious” concepts and precepts, being hermetic, or harmonious inevery way, are quite naturally fixed in the memories of whole populations, notmerely for a few years or so but for centuries and millennia. This, I believe,is what Gurdjieff would call real or “objective” art.In the ordinary sense, of course, we cannot touch, weigh, or measure religiousconcepts and symbols: they are “metaphysical.” But they exist, in one form oranother, in all our minds. We noted earlier how a number of investigators haveindependently suggested that people’s thoughts, if they are forceful enough, maybe as real as the ground on which we stand. Bohm and Gurdjieff, for example,each believed that consciousness is actually a rarefied, currently unmeasurableform of matter. If this were so, then, theoretically, this ephemeral form ofmateriality known as a “concept,” once created, would have the potential toexist independently of the individual mind that conceived it. This would,perhaps, explain why the extraordinarily resilient ideas and concepts of theEgyptians or the Greeks, or of individuals like Muhammad or Isaac Newton, Mosesor Einstein, are still around for all to “see,” because, being in essencepsychologically harmonious, they are highly resonant “things” in their ownright. The Egyptians, I believe, regarded concepts in precisely this way, as aqualitative form of resonance operating according to musical laws. Viewed assuch, religious, philosophical, and indeed seminal scientific concepts and ideascan be envisaged as metaphysical “notes” in the unfinished symphony of mankind’sevolution.Go at any time into a cathedral, a mosque, a synagogue, or a science faculty andyou will witness the direct effect of these evolutionary metaphysical “notes,”these concepts, on all those within. All of these human activities, all of theemotions and thoughts involved, are “light-bound,” the residual product of humanevolution, slowly gathering and increasing in rarefaction toward a condition ofoptimum psychological resonance. Generally it’s a slow process, but this isbecause most social animals live not by the higher ideals and precepts of aChrist or a Buddha, but by Darwinian principles, through which changes, orbeneficial mutations, happen only very rarely. Fortunately, perhaps, we don’tall have to live like apes, because a way out of the Darwinian mode has alreadybeen charted by our early ancestors, and the sun, the stars, and even thegalaxies themselves are all stations en route.All this, of course, has staggering implications, because it suggests that theancient Egyptians were in certain respects psychologically more advanced than weare today. Through some kind of practical application of the Hermetic Code, akey feature of which was the “pyramid ritual,” these people managed to“enlighten” themselves, to climb up onto the higher plane of light, and go downinto the quantum universe of the photon quantum. The hermetic phrase “As above,so below” expresses this concept perfectly.The plane of light—the physicists’ “quantum field”—permeates the whole of thematerial world existing in time. And, as we have noted, the omnipresent photonis the “force-carrier” of all quantum processes, the intermediary between allelectromagnetic interactions. So when matter changes, say, by transmuting underintense heat and pressure, as when carbon-based compounds turn into diamond, orby decomposing, as in the oxidation of metal or the weathering of stone, photonsare continually being absorbed or radiated by electrons in kaleidoscopes ofhighly resonant particle/wave activity. So if, as Yogananda asserted, it isindeed possible for the disciplined mind to tune in to the optimum harmonicfrequencies at which photons resonate, and thereby enter the timeless, spacelessheaven of the ancients, then we are considering here access to a higher scale orplane of existence that in fact reaches right into the very heart of theelectron, one of the basic constituents of all matter.We have already seen that, according to many ancient myths, the Egyptians andtheir Native American counterparts used “music,” or some form of soundtechnology, as an aid in their construction techniques, particularly in respectof the movement of heavy blocks. We also noted Andrew Collins’s investigationsinto sonic technology in his book Gods of Eden, in which he describes eyewitnessaccounts of travelers to Tibet in the 1930s who saw the apparent levitation ofstone blocks actuated by priests using numerous customized instruments.According to one witness, the mysterious Dr. Jarl, the use of musical or soundinstruments by the priests in these demonstrations appeared to have been“accompanied” by silent “players” in the drama, namely the two hundred or somonks standing in rows eight to ten deep behind the musicians themselves, whomJarl suggested might have been contributing toward the procedure by applyingsome form of coordinated psychokinetic force to influence the outcome of theevent.We are talking here of something very similar to what Colin Wilson has calledthe “group-mind” situation, the notion expressed way back before the time ofPlato in the form of the Greek concept of a state of homonoia. Possibly,therefore, the instruments used by these Tibetan priests were effectiveprimarily because they had been devised and subsequently activated by a highlytrained collective of psychologically harmonious individuals, enlightened peoplewhose minds were already “in tune” with what Schwaller de Lubicz described as“all the rhythms and harmonies of the energies in the universe.”The highest and most resonant of the “energies” alluded to here is, of course,light itself. As we have noted, the velocity of light is an absolute physicallaw. It is also the key to the timeless, nonlocal plane of light, the fifthdimension, defined mathematically by physicists as a sphere of existence inwhich there is no time and space. This is the dimension that I believe isdescribed in myth by the Egyptians as the Kingdom of Osiris or the Duat, whichrefers both to the starry world above (the higher plane of light) and themysterious underworld below (the nonlocal, quantum field of the subatomicparticle). And Osiris, of course, who had the ability to perceive both of thesedomains simultaneously, was head of the musical pantheon of eight gods, whoseprincipal monument —the Great Pyramid—was primarily associated with thephenomenon of light, which is itself a musically structured phenomenon. Thus wehave a whole series of very close connections between the “builder gods,” musicand light. Add to this equation a correspondingly high level of consciousness(which we know existed at that time, because “it” conceived of the HermeticCode) and we may well have all the ingredients necessary for the optimization ofany activity, whether it be building a pyramid or simply sweeping a templefloor. Of course, identifying all the ingredients is one thing, butunderstanding how to combine them, and in what measure, is quite another. It isthis distinction, one suspects, that marks the real difference between theancients’ intuitive right-brain knowledge system and our own fragmentedleft-brain method, which is the difference between feeling something in one’sbones and merely knowing certain associated “facts.”Therefore any number of us today might go out into a meadow en masse and try tomimic the exercise described by Jarl, detail by detail, with disappointingresults, because we would be merely aping, lacking the experience derived fromlong periods of disciplined, serious work involving systematic exercises inmeditation, in “stilling” and sub-sequently developing the powers of the mind.Heavy blocks of stone would very likely remain just that, solid lumps of matterlocked in a universal and inviolable gravitational field, in which everything ispermanently endowed with a tangible property known as “mass.” But then we arenot trained ascetics; we are predominantly secular, with secular demands madeupon us, and we have neither the time nor the inclination to spend years actingout the “pyramid ritual” in a disciplined way. Maybe if we had, like Yogananda,for example, or Jarl’s Tibetan hosts, we might see “things” in an entirelydifferent light.The possible methods of manufacture and construction employed by the stonemasonsof ancient Egypt are currently the subject of much heated debate. By and large,everyone seems to be genuinely baffled.Currently in focus are a number of controversial suggestions as to theengineering techniques used by these “primitive” construction teams, such as,for example, Christopher Dunn’s ideas about sonic/ ultrasonic stone carving anddrilling as outlined in his book The Giza Power Plant. The latest data, both thepros and cons of Dunn’s ideas, were for a time posted regularly online, so weneed not dwell on them here: suffice it to say that the question of machiningtechniques in the distant past is far from resolved. Andrew Collins has alsocontributed to the debate with his investigations into the ancients’ sonictechnology and the possible use of “sonic platforms” in the raising andtransportation of their megalithic blocks. The description of the stone-raisingtechniques of the Tibetans by Dr. Jarl further implies the possible involvementof psychokinesis in the procedure: use of the homonoic technique.Inevitably orthodox scholars will reject such notions outright. The generalconsensus is, of course, that the ancient stonemasons and builders used“primitive” methods only. Presumably this even applies to the four gargantuanmonoliths incorporated several courses up in the retaining wall of the Temple ofBaalbek. These blocks, remember, whose combined mass is estimated to be astaggering three thousand tons, were cut, perfectly shaped, and then transportedto Baalbek from a quarry several hundred meters distant. While it may bedifficult for us to imagine a scenario in which these giant stones were made toresonate in such a way as to make them temporarily weightless, the propositionis no more fantastic than the conventional position, which holds that thesegiant blocks were transported this distance and then raised using only ropes,rollers, and wooden levers. Indeed, of the two scenarios, the first seems morelikely: it does at least fit the bill, whereas the “primitive” answer patentlydoes not. And then we have the “musical” myths, of course, which speak of“builder gods” who could make blocks of stone float through the air simply bywhistling or playing sound instruments. Significantly, there are no myths about“magic” ropes or “charmed” levers. There is only music—music and a “union ofminds.”So what these myths tell us, in fact, is that the ancient builder gods hadsomehow discovered a way to effect a powerful psychic interaction between mindand the elemental world of matter. Sound may have played an important part inthe procedure, but consciousness itself, through some kind of union with light,would have been the prime mover.We have noted that Jahn and Dunne’s experimental research has consistentlyproduced statistical data indicating that most people possess a weakpsychokinetic ability. They believe that psychokinesis is possible becauseconsciousness itself is a kind of particle/wave phenomenon, with its wave mode,like all waves, capable of producing effects at a distance. Like the ancientGreeks and the yogis of the East, they do not see these psychokinetic effects asone-way processes, but rather as complementary exchanges of “resonance” betweenthe thinker and the object.Not too long ago, ideas like this would have been summarily laughed out ofcourt, but when one hears today’s scientists talking of particle consciousness,of “mind-like” electrons and “telepathic” photons, it begins to look as ifanything is possible. Furthermore, the suggestion that the mind can somehowgenerate sufficient force to collapse the wave-packets of quantum systemsoutside the brain is in no way ruled out by these latest observations. In fact,when considering the nonlocal “action at a distance” between correlated photons,one might reasonably say: if fundamental particles can do it, then the humanbrain itself, an almost supernaturally well-coordinated mass of trillions upontrillions of highly active wave/particles, can perhaps do it infinitely better.Interestingly, scientists are now trying to understand all physical phenomenanot as isolated entities, but as integral parts of a single but much widerpicture of reality, one that, significantly, also includes the mind of theobserver. Particles, we are told, manifest as such only when certain of theirproperties are “seen,” when they have been detected by an investigator—usuallythrough annihilation of the particle and analysis of the debris. Without theparticipation of an observer, it seems, “particles” as such don’t exist; theyremain, as Bohm says, “enfolded,” in a wavelike state of limbo. So the twoaspects of quantum reality—the observer and the observed—are now seen asintegral functions of the same phenomenon. Obviously, introducing thispsychological element into scientific investigation is an important development,because it is leading scientists on to question the nature of their ownconsciousness. Possibly, therefore, the next generation of physicists willultimately become “yogis” in their own right, able to experience for themselvesthe fundamental laws they have for so long been trying to formulate. Certainly,if there is a continuation of present trends by which the dividing line betweenscientific thought and metaphysics becomes ever fainter, we would do well towatch this space.We will be returning later to the question of some kind of psychic element beinginvolved in the construction of the ancient buildings of Egypt and the Americas.But in the case of the Giza necropolis in particular, another important questionis, of course, why? Why did these early masons take the trouble to build on whatis, even by modern standards, an incredibly vast scale?The answer, it seems to me, is that they were totally and selflessly committedto the task of transmitting the essence of their ideas about light, music, andconsciousness out into the exoteric world, and they obviously realized that themost effective and enduring way to do this was by “writing” all this data not onperishable parchment but in stone. Thoth himself, the originator of the HermeticCode, whose followers designed and constructed the Giza site, was known inancient times as the “scribe of the gods,” a writer no less. We have all heardit said how much mightier is the pen than the sword. Nowhere is this adage moreapplicable than at Giza, where the “scribes” used quills the size of pneumaticdrills and wrote in gigantic, three-dimensional “letters” across acres ofbedrock.The magnificent architecture of these Masonic scribes seems astonishing to ustoday. But the old and weathered physical remains of this great builder cultureare really only a tiny part of the greater edifices constructed by theseremarkable individuals.So the Great Pyramid, the most impressive monument to light ever created onEarth, massive and imposing as it is, is really no more than a foundation stoneupon which has been constructed another, infinitely vaster, metaphysicalstructure, a creation of sorts, whose indeterminate dimensions are even to thisday expanding ever outward and upward. I am referring here, of course, to theongoing evolution of human consciousness, which began its present stage ofdevelopment at the time the Great Pyramid was designed, and which has ever sincebeen guided subconsciously by the all-embracing hermetic principles embodiedwithin it.The Hermetic Code, therefore, is an evolutionary code. It describes exactly howDNA and the genetic code operate in the creation of greater organic structures,and for the last five thousand years it has been the basis of every majorreligion on Earth, movements designed specifically to facilitate the continuingevolution of human consciousness into higher “scales” of existence. Everythingelse we might surmise about the knowledge of the originators of this code issecondary to this fundamental concept. The Egyptians were brilliant architects,master craftsmen, highly accomplished astronomers possessed of the details ofgeodetics and precession, but they were first and foremost evolutionists, peoplewho fully understood the underlying harmonies and rhythms inherent in thecreative processes of nature and who conducted the whole of their lives inaccordance with them.So the “Egyptian way,” the art of the alchemist, was the path of “creativeevolution,” an organic system of development and spiritual growth that fullycomplemented the evolutionary forces of nature. In the following chapter, inwhich we look at some of the ideas of the modern evolutionist, we shall see thatthis remarkable system is as meaningful to us today as it was to the ancientEgyptians."},{"pageContent":"6Live MusicWe have seen how the modern scientific description of physical reality, in manyways echoing the voices of thinkers long passed, encompasses the idea thateverything, even something as seemingly inert as a lump of rock, is in someinexpressible way alive. David Bohm summed up this latest view by describing theelectron, the most substantial component of matter, as a mindlike entity. The“choreographed” movements of electrons in plasmas and metals reveal that thereare hidden orders implicit in the greater quantum field, where everythingappears to be interconnected and potentially “aware” of the presence ofeverything else. So, in the opinion of many modern physicists, nothing in thisuniverse is truly dead: everything resonates, communicates, radiates, andabsorbs. And, as we have seen, there is a clear musical pattern to it all.Now, when we consider entities that are organic and alive in the sense in whichwe normally understand the term, we find once again that there are clear musicalsymmetries evident in their underlying structures. Specifically, thebiomolecular world, as I explained in the Introduction of this book, is anendlessly unfolding symphony of “live” music, of genetic harmonies andinterpenetrating organic scales. Remember that the Hermetic Code, which is inessence a musical system, describes in precise detail how the genetic codeworks.It is interesting that this altogether remarkable fact has not yet beenacknowledged by the scientific establishment, even though it was first madepublic back in 1994.1 [26_note.html#fo61] This is, however, not just any old“fact” we are asking these scholars to consider. It is an all-pervading,fundamental truth, one that carries with it the unavoidable and, perhaps,unpalatable, conclusion: that the latest picture of the organic world beingdescribed by modern biologists, like the physicist’s description of theunderlying structure of matter, is basically just a cover version of theoriginal canon first revealed by the original hermeticists. What we are sayinghere, in effect, is that the historian’s mysterious “huntergatherers,” whopopulated the more temperate regions of the Earth at the dawn of recordedhistory, were apparently more in tune with life’s creative processes than anyscientist alive today. We have proof of this. We have the Hermetic Code, thecode of life itself, described by a simple formula that embodies an idea incirculation for untold millennia, an idea that is, in fact, so profoundlyrelevant to us all that it will never fade away.By way of finding further proof in support of the above heresy, we must now makeanother “musical” journey through time. It’s a very long road indeed that youare about to travel, for we shall be going way back, beyond the eras of theGreeks and the Egyptians, back to the music of the Neanderthal race and furtherstill, beyond even the time of the dinosaurs—right back, in fact, to point zero,to the very first evolutionary “note,” the first primordial spark of life onEarth. As we shall see, the Hermetic Code has been in evidence practically fromthe very beginning.The present, most widely accepted account of our origins is of course theDarwinian theory of evolution, which asserts that you and I and theconsciousness we are endowed with happened to have evolved here on Earth purelyas a result of blind, accidental physical and biochemical processes. This basicconcept, the random evolutionary development of life, has in the last few yearsbecome virtually a scientific dogma. When we compare ancient and modern ideas onevolution, however, we find that the latter is but a pale imitation of itspredecessor. This is not to say, of course, that Darwinism is not a valid theoryof evolution, only that it doesn’t go far enough. So let’s see in what respectsthis great theory falls short of the original described by the priests of OldKingdom Egypt. We can begin with the experts.In a recent book, River out of Eden, Professor Richard Dawkins, author ofseveral influential books on evolutionary theory, attempts to explain the wholephenomenon of life in terms of Darwinian principles. This is a theory that hefully endorses and which, he says, displays “a sinewy elegance, a poetic beautythat outclasses even the most haunting of the world’s origin myths.”2[26_note.html#fo62]Already, it seems, I am inescapably and completely at odds with one of theworld’s foremost proponents of current evolutionary theory, who clearly believesthat the modern scientific interpretation of our creation is superior in everyway to the ancients’ description of mankind’s origins. So let’s see.Dawkins’s lucid account of how life evolved on this planet constitutes animpressive argument in favor of the theory of natural selection. According tothis view, all living creatures are indirectly descended from a single,primitive ancestral species, which evolved and diverged into new species overbillions of years through random copying errors in DNA replication. Many ofthese mutations of single genes will have had deleterious effects on thefunctions of the host organism and actually reduced its chances of survival inthe world. Very occasionally, however, a gene-copying error resulted in a changein the organism’s functioning that happened to be beneficial in life, improvingits performance in some way and so increasing both its chances of survival andits ability to produce equally successful descendants.Clearly Dawkins has little time for the Creationists’ arguments against theapparently random, ungodlike nature of gene mutation and natural selection. Tobe fair, Creationism (as interpreted by modern theologians) is not a theory atall; it is simply a blind faith, whose advocates have haphazardly concocted arather flimsy file of uninformed criticism of Darwinism, none of which providesconvincing evidence for their ideas.There is a paradox here. While Creationists have been busy nitpicking atscientific theory, they have all along been in possession of the completeevolutionary picture. The whole story is there, as we shall see, in theirscriptures. And this account includes a detailed description of the newlydiscovered biomolecular world, albeit only as part of a much broader and morecomprehensive theory of evolution.The commonest criticism of Creationists relates to one of the main problems ofDarwinian theory, the difficulty it has in explaining how such an intricateorgan as, say, the human eye was formed. What, for example, did theintermediate, developmental forms of such a sophisticated organ look like? Whatkinds of beneficial evolutionary functions did these earlier, rudimentaryconglomerates of cell tissue facilitate before they evolved into a state thatactually bestowed upon the host organism the ability to even recognize thedifference between light and darkness, let alone “see”? Darwin himself said thathe could never imagine the eye, with all its structural complexities, as havingevolved through random variation and selection alone. Dawkins disagrees. Infact, answering this rather difficult question is, he assures us, “a doddle.”Half an eye, he argues, is 100 percent better than no eye at all, 1 percentbetter than 49 percent of an eye, 1 percent worse than 51 percent—and so on,providing an evolutionary scenario that suggests a gradual, hit-and-miss processof development.Now this might seem at first to be a fairly reasonable line of deduction. Butthen, what about a measly 1 percent of an eye? One percent, 2, even 3 percentwould be so far removed from an organ that sees, or even one only half-formed,that it is difficult to envisage what kind of survival advantages these firstcrude mutations would have given to the evolving species. Would 2 percent of aneye, for example, give a creature even the slightest hint that one of itsnatural predators was about to pounce from a short distance away?There are other complex evolutionary developments that are difficult to explainsolely in terms of Darwinian theory—for example, the evolution of fins andwings. We are told that fins evolved into hands and that arms evolved intowings. But of what use were these different functional structures during thein-between stages of development? What advantages over others would a speciesexisting through the proposed transitional stages have with an appendage thatwas neither arm nor wing, but a bit of both? If and when traces of the existenceof such peculiar creatures are ever found in the fragmentary fossil record, thenperhaps a little light might be shed on the problem. To date, none have beenidentified, and one can only speculate on the reason. The Harvard paleontologistStephen Jay Gould has suggested that such transitions may have beendiscontinuous, rapid changes, invoked by single crucial genes that somehowmanaged to cross over concurring pathways of development and so affect thestructure of the whole organism in a much more radical way.The only creature remotely resembling an “intermediate” that has been identifiedin the fossil record is the archaeopteryx, a raven-sized creature with areptilian skull and birdlike wings. Its wings were fully formed, however, a factthat has prompted many biologists to classify the archaeopteryx not as a trueintermediate but as a completely developed bird. Indeed, it is difficult toimagine how any true intermediate with a confusing complement of half-formedwings could have survived at all. Should it attempt to fly away from danger, orjump? In that almost comical split second of indecision it would probably havebeen summarily dispatched by some ravenous carnivore. This might account for thefact that no half-formed wings have ever been identified in the fossil record.Presumably such unfortunate creatures would have been hopelessly ill-equipped tosurvive long enough in a ruthless, lex talionis world to produce offspring insufficiently large numbers.Returning to the question of the eye for a moment, if Darwin’s theory isn’tquite the whole story, could there possibly be other factors involved in theformation of such a complex organ? That is, could there be other agenciesinvolved in the evolutionary process that might be to some extent responsiblefor the eye’s amazingly intricate development?I would suggest that there is at least one agency that might be worthconsidering here, a phenomenon that is intrinsically connected to the eye likeno other. Furthermore, it is all-powerful and omnipresent, and occupied auniquely important position in the belief system of the first true“Creationists.” This, of course, is light, the Holy Ghost, the “RainbowCovenant,” the agent of all visual sensation. Obviously if there were no lightin the first place, an organ built to perceive it would never have evolved. Weknow that primitive sea creatures living at the bottom of the deepest oceans,where no light ever reaches them, are devoid of normal photon receptors. So themere presence of sufficient light is enough to induce the development of organscapable of assimilating it. Remember also that light itself, as well as beingthe agency by which objects are made visible, is also, as the ancient Egyptianswere aware, a musical phenomenon. With its seven fundamental frequencies (thespectrum) and its three distinct “primary” frequencies, it is a perfectelectromagnetic model of the “triple octave,” of the Hermetic Code, whichdescribes the evolutionary development of all organic processes, including, ofcourse, the process of the development of the eye.The “river” in the title of Dawkins’s book refers to the stream of digitalinformation flowing through time in the form of DNA, branching and forking onits way, and giving rise to new species in the process. When one species mutatesoff a daughter species, the river of genes forks into two, and if the twotributaries diverge for long enough, perhaps through the external influence ofgeographical variables, the two species then develop quite distinct anddifferent characteristics. At one stage, apparently, in one of these branches,Mitochondrial Eve was born. This is the name given to the most recent commonancestor of all modern humans, a member of the species Homo sapien sapiens whoprobably lived in Africa between 100,000 and 250,000 years ago.3[26_note.html#fo63]The name of this “hybrid from Eden” is derived from the term mitochondria, whichare vital, energy-producing “particles” existing by the thousands in all ourcells. They help to convert energy from food molecules and then store it fordistribution as and when required. The significant point about mitochondria isthat they have their own DNA. Unlike the main DNA housed in the nucleus of thecell, which becomes almost totally scrambled in every new generation every timea sex cell is made, mitochondrial DNA is passed down relatively unchangedthrough the female line only. It is therefore a very useful tool for long-termgenealogists, who can use it for dating common ancestors within species. This ishow Mitochondrial Eve has been identified and dated.Dawkins is particularly fond of Mitochondrial Eve, and he contrasts her, as ascientific hypothesis, with the Eve of Eden. He believes his “scientific truth”to be of greater interest and, I quote, “more poetically moving” than theoriginal myth.4 [26_note.html#fo64]Presumably, at the time of writing this, Dawkins was unaware of the existence ofthe Hermetic Code, of the fact that it is identical in every way to the geneticcode, and also of the fact that all major creation myths are in effectvariations of the same, original theme. This, as we have seen, is not simply thespurious product of primitive superstition and folklore, but a genuinescientific theory, presented symbolically in the clearest of terms: it statessimply that all creative processes are the product of forces described by thetwo fundamental laws of nature embodied in the pi convention, the law of threeand the law of octaves. Clearly, it is only in this context—that is, from thehermetic perspective—that the original story of the Eve of Eden can be trulyunderstood. In fact, as I explained in The Infinite Harmony, much of the HebrewScriptures, from the creation of the world and the story of Eden, through to thecharmed lives of Noah, Joshua, Moses, David, and Solomon, contains innumerablesymbolic musical references to the Hermetic Code, to the theory oftranscendental evolution. And, remember, the creation myth of Genesis is justone example, one old “fairy tale” from the Middle East. There are many more, ofcourse—Chinese, Vedic, Zoroastrian, Christian, and so on—and they tell exactlythe same tale, providing a truly accurate description of the natural processesof creation. Think of the I Ching, and how perfectly its overall formatcorresponds to the structure and symmetry of that remarkable biochemical codeused by DNA. Are we to believe, then, that the emergence of these identicalsymmetries are both merely the product of “accidental mutations”? I really don’tthink so. One of these symmetries—the genetic code—just might have originated bychance, though personally I doubt it, given the fact that the physical universeitself is structured along the very same musical symmetries. But then, when wesee exactly the same symmetries being repeated yet again in a higher scale ofevolution, that is, in the mind of man, it begins to look as if it might bepeople like Dawkins, and not the ancient mythmaker, who is unwittingly purveyingthe fairy tale.This repetition of identical symmetries in scales both “above” and “below” isimportant, because it suggests that there is an underlying unity and sense ofpurpose in all life. This purpose, quite clearly, is to evolve, and to do somusically, transcendentally—just as DNA has done over the past four thousandmillion years. You see, the DNA symmetry is not only “resonating” in our bloodand in our bones, the same symmetry is also active in our minds, enliveningthem, vitalizing them, coaxing them ever upward. Possibly this is why I amsitting here now, writing all about this symmetry, because, deep down, somewhereinside me, DNA is telling me to.This now leads on to an important question: who or what told DNA how to behave?Dawkins’s answer is unequivocal: no one, nothing; it found its way quite byaccident, stumbling blindly through geological time, through endless cosmic andgeophysical cataclysms, ice ages, or whatever.It is true that much of DNA’s evolution on Earth has been erratic and at timesvery chancey, with many of nature’s experiments (like, say, dinosaurs) goingdrastically wrong. But remember, underlying all this apparent random, selectiveevolution is the symmetry of DNA and the genetic code, a symmetry that, as wehave seen, is actually controlled by the forces described by nature’s twofundamental laws. So this is in no way simply the product of chance. DNA’sdistinctive form and method of evolution is an inevitable consequence of thesenatural forces: it was preordained by nature itself.It seems to me that the main problem with Dawkins’s position is that there islittle or no music in it, no allowance made for the evident hermetic symmetry ofthe biomolecular world. This is where ideas old and new really diverge, becausethe mythmakers, the originators of the Hermetic Code, of pi and the “tripleoctave,” knew all about this music and about the laws and forces that conductit.As we have seen, the Hermetic Code is much more than a mathematical tool. It isa universal blueprint for all evolutionary or creative development, and itsdistinctive inner symmetry is to be found in the biomolecular and physicalstructures of all forms of life. We see this not only in thesixty-four-word/twenty-two-note amino acid “scale of resonance” but also, forexample, in the overall physiology of human beings, with their three nervecomplexes responsible for sensation, emotion, and perception, and their eightsets of endocrine transformers, the glands responsible for secreting into thebloodstream all the drugs and hormones necessary for enabling reaction toexternal stimuli. Thus, all human beings, and in fact all living things, arehermetically composed; they are all in their relative scales evolutionary“triple octaves” with the inherent potential to achieve a state of “optimumresonance.”The living cell uses these hermetic symmetries to sustain itself and to develop.Ultimately it attains the necessary condition of “optimum resonance” and soacquires the supernatural power to self-replicate. Through a systematic sequenceof exponential growth patterns it then combines with its fellow cells to createa whole new world for itself, a massive, complex, conscious organism. Such anorganism constitutes a higher dimension for the cell, a higher “scale of being.”The theory of transcendental evolution, the essence of which is contained in thenow familiar phrase “As above, so below,” asserts that, at the human level ofexistence, it is possible for individuals to emulate the living cell and toachieve a similar condition of “optimum resonance.” Traditionally this uniquecondition of being has been most commonly acquired by following certain triedand tested “religious” codes of conduct—the idea being that such practiceseventually endow the individual with special powers: to “self-replicate” in someway, to create whole new worlds, to penetrate up into an infinitely higher scaleof existence, the scale which ultimately became known as heaven.So pi itself, the blueprint for the evolution of all life, is also theblue-print for the evolution of consciousness. It represents an exact scientificdescription of the optimum metaphysical frequency, an “immaculate” psychologicalwavelength accessible to us all, through which mankind can ultimately break freefrom the ponderous mode of evolution characteristic of the “naked ape.”Thus, the Hermetic Code describes the fundamental organic matrix upon which wehave all been constructed. Whatever else we might care to think of ourselves, weare fundamentally walking “trinities,” triple octaves of resonance, comprisingour sensations, emotions, and perceptions. And according to the originators ofthe theory of transcendental evolution, the three nerve complexes controllingthese vital functions can be systematically developed up to a point where theyall “resonate at optimum potential” and so acquire the power to transcend on toa higher scale of existence. Clearly such a condition of being is a far cry fromour present evolutionary state. As Gurdjieff and Schwaller both said, somewherealong the line our ancestors lost the plot and slipped back into a rudimentaryDarwinian mode. I believe the mythmakers and metaphysicians of ancient daysforesaw this decline, and that this is why they went to such great lengths toproject the Hermetic Code out into the greater sphere of humankind’s collectiveconsciousness. They knew that this sacred concept would lie dormant, like a seedin the soil of the subconscious mind, but that sooner or later this seed wouldgerminate, take root and grow, and ultimately flower and bear fruit. Thisdescription is not intended to be taken as a metaphor. The process outlined, aswe shall see subsequently, is organic from beginning to end. And so it is thattoday, now that our level of comprehension has reached, as it were, thenecessary “pitch,” we are witnessing a worldwide “Egyptian renaissance,” what wemight call a new flowering of awareness and appreciation of the great wisdom andremarkable abilities of the metaphysicians of ancient times. Accordingly theHermetic Code itself has surfaced once again, and its symmetries have beenrecognized, not only in all the major scriptures and in the dimensions ofancient pyramids all over the world, but also in our blood, in the white ray ofphysics, and in the underlying structure of the entire physical universe. Intruth, now that we have eyes to see, we find that these symmetries areeverywhere.I stated above that I believe that the growth and development of consciousnessis an organic process. Logically it has to be, because the Hermetic Code and thegenetic code are fundamentally one and the same system. And, in fact, thisorganic correlation is further compounded in the ideas of Pythagoras, the mainproponent of hermetic theory in ancient Greece.The Pythagoreans themselves left no written records. The “Golden Verses,” whoseauthorship is generally attributed to their founder, may be authentic, but theyare scanty and fragmented and contain no hermetic data as such. What thePythagoreans did leave for posterity, however, was a comprehensive array ofesoteric symbols: numerical, geometrical, and, of course, musical. The languageof symbolism was their way of recording and transmitting their ideas, and whenwe examine the most “sacred” of these symbols, we often find that they possess anumber of distinct but related facets. Of course, pi is the prime example: itconveys mathematical, geometrical, musical, mystical, and even scientifictruths, all neatly condensed into a single, imperishable sign. Anothersignificant symbol to which Pythagoras attached great importance was the sacred“Tetrad.” This was expressed by placing ten pebbles on the ground like so:[images/6.jpg]Like pi, this is in essence a musical symbol, another symbolic expression of theHermetic Code and was referred to in Pythagorean schools as the model of thegods. Also described as the source of nature, the Tetrad was seen as thefundamental matrix upon which to create the perfect individual, a “model” of thegods.When we look at the configuration of the ten pebbles, we see that they are laidout in a 4–3–2–1 format, the whole depicting an evolutionary process developingfrom bottom to top. It so happens that this distinctive pattern of developmentdescribes perfectly the four distinct stages in the synthesis of amino acids,the very building blocks of life.It will help to remind readers here that the DNA molecule works with the fourchemical components, or “bases,” of the genetic code. These are used toconstruct small molecules known as RNA triplet codons, comprising three baseseach, which then serve as templates for the production of amino acids. The aminoacids are then, in turn, assembled into the much more complex protein chains.The Hermetic Code, as we know, is primarily an expression of the law of triplecreation, which holds that everything is composed of trinities within trinities.This means that the three individual octaves embodied within pi are inthemselves triple octaves, making nine octaves in total, or sixty-four“notes”—precisely the number of RNA codon combinations.Look at the musical structure of the formula pi when set out in diagrammaticform:[images/7.jpg]As we see, the Hermetic Code, just like DNA and the genetic code, is constructedupon four fundamental “base notes.” These are represented in the base line ofthe Tetrad, which we have noted consists of four pebbles. If we now follow thesuccessive stages in the synthesis of the amino acid, we see that the Tetraddescribes this process exactly. Thus, from the four nitrogenous bases, DNAprograms three of them at any given time (RNA triplet codons) to produce twodistinct properties (amino acids are both acidic and alkaline) of onebiochemical unit in a higher, more complex scale of existence, that is, one ofthe twenty-two evolutionary signals at the amino acid/protein scale ofdevelopment.There is one particularly detailed description of the Tetrad, written more than1,500 years after the Pythagorean era, which is especially interesting, becauseit demonstrates even more convincingly how perfectly in tune these hermeticinitiates were with the vital process of the creation of life, even to theextent of understanding the dual nature of what was being conceived in this way.The text in question, dealt with in some detail in The Infinite Harmony, is atenth-century Egyptian commentary on the Koran, the Tafsir ol-Jalalayn, whichgives an account of Muhammad’s famous night journey to heaven. It begins withhim riding on the back of a quadruped, sees him prostrating himself three timesin prayer, after which he is offered by the angel Gabriel two cups to drinkfrom, one of wine and one of milk, and finally, after wisely choosing the milk,escorted in triumph to the first of the “seven heavens.”Clearly this commentary on the Prophet’s spiritual awakening is describing ahermetic process, the organic “flowering” of Muhammad’s consciousness. It is aclear description of the pattern of evolutionary development of the Tetrad,which, as we have noted, depicts with absolute precision the way in which Watsonand Crick’s famous double helix is evolving through time. The two symbols ofwine and milk are especially significant, because they describe perfectly thedual, acid/ alkali properties of the amino acid.We have now established that hermetic is genetic. This means, in effect, thatcertain fundamental aspects of consciousness—ideas, concepts, revelations, andso forth—are metaphysical genes and are produced in exactly the same way as areamino-acid chains.Interestingly, this particular idea (or “gene”) was first tentatively putforward by Richard Dawkins himself in his highly acclaimed first book, TheSelfish Gene. Dawkins defines this new kind of replicator as a “unit of culturaltransmission,” or of “imitation,” one still in its infancy but which “already isachieving evolutionary change at a rate that leaves the old gene panting farbehind.”5 [26_note.html#fo65] His chosen name for this metaphysicalphenomenon—meme, from the Greek root mimeme (hence, mime, mimic, copy)—has sincebeen incorporated into the main corpus of our language and has spawned a wholenew embryonic science: memetics.Examples of memes are numerous. Dawkins cites things like tunes, ideas, catchphrases, fashions in clothing, ways of making pots and of building arches. Infact, the list could be endless, because it would encompass anything invented byany given individual, good or bad, positive or negative, that is subsequentlycopied by another or others. This would include concepts as diverse and farremoved from one another as fascism, belief in god, a scientific theory, thewheel, a literary genre, computer hacking, praying, killing, or whatever. Memesare likened to viruses, willy-nilly infecting or contaminating brains as theyhop from one to another like subquantum fleas, apparently going nowhere inparticular. This means that they are not seen as conscious agents but, likegenes, as agents of “blind natural selection.” So memes, or ideas, another formof replicator, are everywhere, floating awkwardly around in the primevalsoup—the soup of human culture—endlessly parasitising our brains at every twistand turn. Even the great religions, philosophical movements, and the concepts ofthe most influential figures in human history can be classed simply as parasitic“meme complexes,” all swimming around in a chaotic meme pool.Memes are seen as agents of blind natural selection, but the evident longevityof the most enduring creations and inventions of man have to be admitted. AsDawkins explains, an individual’s genetic input to the ancestral line is halvedas each generation comes forth, so it doesn’t take long for it to reachnegligible proportions. The memetic influences of the more notable figures inhistory—like Socrates, Leonardo, Copernicus, and Marconi—are still goingstrong.6 [26_note.html#fo66]Although he makes an oblique reference to the power of the organized church,whose architecture, rituals, music, art, and written tradition he describes as“a co-adapted stable set of mutually-assisting memes,”7 [26_note.html#fo67]Dawkins sees nothing special in religion per se. Indeed, he is well known forbeing particularly vociferous, and perhaps with good reason, in his condemnationof the Christian fundamentalist elements in certain southern states of America,where attempts have been made to keep Darwin’s theory off the educationalcurriculum. In some states it is still obligatory for schools to teach the naïveliteral interpretation of the Biblical creation story alongside Darwin. Ofcourse millions will agree that studying scripture of any religious persuasioncan enrich and stimulate the mind, if only by freeing it to speculate ondimensions beyond the restrictive confines of mere survival. Possibly Dawkinshimself would agree that written traditions are not all bad. But the Biblicalversion, along with all the other major doctrines referred to in this book, is ahermetic work, an all-encompassing treatise on universal symmetries, and topresent it simply as a factual account of the origin of the world and of mankindnot only misses the point entirely, but alienates virtually everyone of ascientific or rational bent, and in so doing actually hinders the flow of avital stream of important knowledge. If such a state of affairs were tocontinue, the “soup of human culture” would simply stagnate.Understandably, therefore, Dawkins tends to focus on peripherals, on thenegative or contradictory aspects of formalized religion, such as the Christianidea of hellfire or the meme for religious blind faith, loosely referred to asthe god meme. This, in my opinion, is where he misses out on the most importantline of enquiry, one that must logically take us right back to the creators ofthese long-lived religious movements. In the case of the Christian phenomenon weneed of course to focus primarily on the deeds and words of Jesus Christ, and todo this we have to strip away practically all of the subsequent trappings andsubjective embellishments of the formalized hierarchy. If we do this we end upwith the kernel of all Christian preaching—the original “meme complex”—expressedby Jesus himself through the unchanging symbolism of what is known today as thePassion. And what immediately becomes apparent when we look at the symbolisminvolved is that the eight days of Easter week, from Palm Sunday to the Sundayof the Resurrection, describe a musical event, an octave of activity, beginningon the note Do and ending, after seven intervals, on the very same note. Soclearly the message encoded here is hermetic, a scientific description of theorganic evolution of Christ’s consciousness, which, like Muhammad’s,successfully transcended on to the greater scale above.Given that the Hermetic Code is the blueprint of all religious symbolism, wemight say that it is one of the oldest memes floating around. More than that,like RNA or DNA in the gene pool, it is ubiquitous, and so deeply immersed inthe human psyche that it looks to be unstoppable.We now know that the Hermetic Code has many facets, expressing mathematical,musical, geometrical, scientific, and even cosmic truths, all ingeniouslycondensed into a single, imperishable sign: 22/7. One might say, then, that thiscode is a meme complex in its own right. But is it, as Dawkins assumes it mustbe, an unconscious entity, merely an agent of “blind natural selection”? Theanswer, it seems to me, is far from decided. In fact, it is difficult to see howthe Hermetic Code could be defined as a blindly evolving, unconsciousreplicator. It was intentionally created and subsequently disseminated by themind of some unknown genius for a specific and entirely selfless purpose—toenlighten lesser mortals on the ways of Nature and so facilitate the ongoingevolution of man’s collective consciousness. And it is still with us today, thiscode, as vital and resilient as the day it was conceived, an undiminishingbeacon of metaphysical light shining into every nook and cranny of humanendeavor. Even in the modern Western world, where secular influences predominateand the so-called god meme is in recessive mode in the majority of human brains,the fundamental components of the Hermetic Code are everywhere, in thesymmetries of the material world of elementary particles and biomolecules, inmusic, legend, folklore, fairy tales, customs, and so on, stretching right backto the dawn of civilization. Just think of the number 7, every other person’slucky number. So evidently appealing is this particular meme, if you won thenational lottery with the number 7 and multiples thereof, you would almostcertainly be sharing your diminished prize money with thousands of others. Ofall numbers, this symbol, which is of course a symbol of the octave, is withoutdoubt one of the most efficient “replicators” in the entire development of humanthought.8 [26_note.html#fo68]The point is, the Hermetic Code is not just any old brainchild. It is not afashion, a craze, a catch-phrase, a political ideology, or a computer virus. Itis an all-embracing concept, which not only describes the process of evolutionbut actually facilitates its ongoing development. In view of its uniqueness, itwould be inappropriate to classify it along with the common meme. For thisreason I choose to differentiate between memes and evolutionary concepts byreferring to the latter simply as metaphysical genes. This would apply to allsignificant concepts, such as, for example, the highly potent symbolism of thePassion of Christ, the eightfold ways of the Buddha, Zoroaster, and Confucius,the structures of the I Ching and of the tarot pack, or the symmetries ofcreation described in Genesis, in the Koran, or in the cosmogeny of the buildersof the Giza necropolis. These ancient concepts have survived for millennia andlook set to last for many more to come. There are modern concepts, too, whichmight fall into the same category. For instance, Gurdjieff’s system is likely toprevail because it is essentially a hermetic phenomenon, a faithful “copy” ofthe original. Arguably Darwin’s rudimentary “conception” is in there too—alongwith the revelations of such as Watson and Crick or Einstein. Einstein’s Theoryof Special Relativity is a particularly potent “metaphysical gene” and haschanged our view of the world forever. Not only does it focus on the constantproperties of light, the Covenant of the Ages, but also, with its implicationsfor the elasticity of space and time, it provides us with an intuitive glimpseinto another dimension, the timeless, spaceless world of the great Egyptiansun-god, the plane of light.So what is their attraction? What makes significant concepts such goodreplicators? The answer, in my view, is their hermetic content, theirevolutionary bias. It is this kind of impetus that ordinary people like you andme somehow find irresistible, even if only on a subconscious level. But ofcourse anything, any invention that serves to promote the evolution ofconsciousness, must by its very nature be based on “sound” principles andtherefore be psychologically harmonious. Possibly, therefore, it is thisintegral harmony, or the quality of resonance intrinsic to the concept, thatexplains the secret of its longevity. This is to say that concepts possessing ahigh degree of resonance seem to be endowed with a special kind of metaphysicalpower, the power continually to “self-replicate,” by harmonizing, blending in,with billions of human brains.So the significant concept, the metaphysical gene, is an evolutionary impulse;it has an inherent tendency to rise above the surface level of the “soup ofhuman culture” and, in musical or hermetic terms, is much more psychologicallyresonant than a mindless catchphrase or the latest gizmo.In Dawkins’s view, memes, or metaphysical genes, have nothing equivalent tochromosomes: “In general memes resemble the early self-replicating molecules,floating chaotically free in the primeval soup, rather than modern genes intheir neatly paired, chromosomal regiments.”9 [26_note.html#fo69]Evolution is considered to have kicked in when the early replicators in theprimeval soup began not merely to exist but to construct for themselvescontainers as vehicles for their continued existence. The replicators that wonthrough were those that built “survival machines” for themselves to live in. Sogenes came first and the machines— chromosomes, cells, plants, animals,people—came afterward. We might say, then, that the first true survival machinewas the DNA molecule, the chromosome. This would imply that, at the next scaleof development, the scale of human consciousness, ideas and concepts willeventually build “survival machines” for themselves, possibly beginning with themetaphysical equivalent of the chromosome. Dawkins assumes that this hasn’thappened yet, that memes, or metaphysical genes, whether in isolation or inloosely affiliated complexes, are still drifting clumsily through space and timelike spores in the wind.There is, however, an alternative way of looking at metaphysical genes, one thatsees the “chromosomes” housing them—their “vehicles”—as already existing. Tounderstand this we need first to look at DNA itself, the original chromosome.One of the chromosome’s functions is to create proteins, which it does bysending out copies of parts of its internal structure in the form of tripletcodons. These are ejected into the chemically rich liquid membrane of the cellto do their work, to code either for one of the twenty amino acids or for one ofthe start–stop signals. The amino acids are then assembled by other geneticcomponents into molecular chains. A chain of amino acids makes a peptide, achain of peptides makes a protein, and the protein codes for one or another of amultitude of chemical processes in the evolutionary development of the entireorganic body, the whole “machine.”If we subsequently apply this model to the world of memes, we might say that themetaphysical chromosome is the brain itself, so that a momentary thought or ideawould function as some kind of metaphysical amino acid, or a cluster of them,and a full-blown concept, with all its cognitive applications, would be theequivalent of a metaphysical gene. The product of such a “gene,” continuing toevolve and self-replicate in millions of other human brains, we might regard asthe metaphysical equivalent of the biologists’ greater protein macromolecule.If this is really how it is, and the evolutionary processes “above” are inessence the same as the processes “below,” it would require an explanation as tohow a three-dimensional organ like the brain could possibly be regarded as ascaled-up replica of the DNA double helix. This will be the subject of the nextchapter.Earlier I suggested that this “organic” process of transcendental evolution, of“journeying to heaven,” involved attaining what I call an optimum degree ofpsychological resonance, one that would ultimately be “in tune” with theconstant frequencies of light quanta. The implication of this is that light andconsciousness are, in effect, opposite sides of the same metaphysical coin—the“coin” itself being the metaphysical equivalent of the amino acid, thetranscendental product of an enlightened mind. Now this product—this impulse,idea, or concept—like the amino acid, is derived primarily from three basiccomponents or “bases,” namely sensation, emotion, and perception. The conceptthat arises from the harmonious interaction of these three metaphysical “bases,”just like the acid/alkali structure of the amino acid, must also have a dualnature, which means that these products of consciousness should have acomplementary opposite. This must be light itself. Light is, after all, theprimary agent of all visual sensation. It is also the most resonant “octave” inexistence. Most importantly, however, it is a perfect electromagnetic blueprintof the Hermetic Code.The unraveling of the digital molecular structure of the DNA double helix hasbeen hailed by Dawkins as the most revolutionary scientific discovery inhistory, an achievement that, he believes, should be honored as much as theworks of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Whether or not this will, in the event,turn out to be the case remains to be seen, but it seems to me to be a tallorder. The Athenian adepts almost certainly achieved their present statusprimarily because they were all fully “in tune” with the tenets of hermetictheory. Socrates, for example, the first of the great trio and Plato’s mentor,is known to have received personal instruction from the Pythagorean School onthe island of Samos. In addition, all three were known to have respected andfamiliarized themselves with the “musical” traditions of the legendary PersianMagi.The Greeks, of course, believed the original source of all this hermetic wisdomto have been the ibis-headed Egyptian god Thoth. Known to the Greeks as HermesTrismegistus (“Thrice-greatest Hermes”), he later became associated with theRoman god Mercury, the messenger of the gods. Most of the extant literaturerelating to Hermes belongs to the post-Christian era, and scholars in generaldoubt his historical authenticity. But of course, someone, somewhere, revealedthe Hermetic Code to the human race, so by whatever name this individual wasthen known, we can be reasonably sure that the originator of Revelationcertainly did, at some remote period in prehistory, walk upon this earth.We have already established that this remarkably astute observer understoodfully how life is created. The symmetry of the Hermetic Code and the symmetry ofthe genetic code match too precisely for us to think otherwise. But in casethere is still some doubt in the reader’s mind, it is perhaps worth noting hereanother intriguing detail in the legends of Hermes/Thoth, one that, to me atleast, is so fitting as to be more “poetic” even than Dawkins’s MitochondrialEve. The rod or wand of Hermes/Mercury was known as the caduceus. He is depictedholding it in Botticelli’s painting La Primavera. The wand itself, said to havehad awesome magical properties, was surmounted with two wings and entwined bytwo serpents. It is a perfect double helix.Significantly, this same design also appeared in ancient America, and in muchthe same context, that is, as a symbol adopted by a legendary man of highlearning. In Fingerprints of the Gods, Graham Hancock describes a statue inTeotihuacán near Lake Titicaca in Bolivia, of the mythological civilizer ofancient South America, Viracocha. A bearded, Caucasian figure with featuresidentical to the early depictions of the Egyptian god Osiris, Viracocha iswearing a ceremonial robe, on either side of which is engraved the image of aserpent, coiling from bottom to top. In another representation, Viracocha holdsa thunderbolt in each hand. A thunderbolt, of course, is a stylizedrepresentation of a helix, and Viracocha is holding two of them. Further north,incidentally, Viracocha’s Mexican counterpart, Quetzalcoatl, had as his symbol aplumed serpent—again very reminiscent of the plumed caduceus of Hermes.Possibly the most impressive ancient representation of the double helix I haveyet encountered is the pyramid Temple of Kukulkan (the name for Quetzalcoatl inthe Mayan dialect) at Chichén Itzá, in northern Yucatán, Mexico. This is whatGraham Hancock has to say about this remarkable structure:Its four stairways had 91 steps each. Taken together with the top platform,which counted as a further step, the total was 365. This gave the number ofcomplete days in a solar year. In addition, the geometric design and orientationof the ancient structure had been calibrated with Swiss-watch precision toachieve an objective as dramatic as it was esoteric: on the spring and autumnequinoxes, regular as clockwork, triangular patterns of light and shadow combineto create the illusion of a giant serpent undulating on the northern staircase.On each occasion the illusion lasted for 3 hours and 22 minutes exactly.10[26_note.html#fo70]Two serpents coiling up to the sun, like starbound DNA. Esoteric, yes, butentirely comprehensible in the light of the theory of transcendental evolution.Such remarkable similarities in ancient global symbolism may lead us reasonablyto suppose, as Hancock, Bauval, West, Wilson, and others have suggested, thatthese legendary civilizers—Viracocha/ Quetzalcoatl/Kukulkan,Osiris/Thoth/Hermes—if not one and the same individual, were an elite group froma forgotten race of people. Possibly they were survivors of the cataclysms ofthe last ice-age melt-down, who successfully disseminated their profoundunderstanding of the laws governing creation and evolution across the entireplanet at an unknown period of the distant past. But how distant?Dawkins says that Mitochondrial, or African, Eve, was the first member of ourown species, Homo sapiens sapiens, to produce descendants successfully. She isthought to have appeared possibly as recently as a hundred thousand years ago.Before her there were more primitive hominids, such as the Neanderthals (Homosapiens neanderthalensis), Homo erectus, and its even more remote ancestors,Homo habilis and Australopithicus, the earliest having been dated to around fourmillion years ago.So a great deal has happened in the evolution of the hominid over the lasthundred thousand years; for Eve, the mother of the modern human race, is thoughtto have been little more than a cunning savage, a successful fighter andbreeder, an unwitting, cutthroat product of DNA’s relentless bid forimmortality.This conventional picture of the primitive “savage” dominating the world stagearound one hundred thousand years ago is by no means accepted by all scholars.We have noted already how Stan Gooch has shown that the predecessors of AfricanEve—the Neanderthals—were in their own way a highly evolved culture, people whowere closely observing the heavens as long ago as 75,000 years ago and werecapable of calculating cosmic events such as the long-term cycles of the moonand the periodicity of the planets. It also seems that not all of them weremerely fighters and breeders, for they engaged in huge communal miningenterprises. Gooch cites as evidence for this large-scale redochre mines andquarries recently discovered in southern Africa. Some of the mines have truemining tunnels, and these immense hives of highly organized human activity havebeen accurately dated, with the earliest, around one hundred thousand years old,corresponding exactly with the long-term genealogist’s latest possible date forthe appearance of African Eve. It should also be noted that red ochre had nomaterial value and so would have been used for ritual purposes only, indicatingthat the Neanderthal’s world was not solely an arena of survival, but also had astrong spiritual side to it. This is further confirmed by the archaeologicalevidence mentioned previously, namely the stone altar discovered in a cave atDrachenloch in the Swiss Alps, in which had been enshrined seven bear skulls.Obviously seven is a crucial number here, not only because of its obviousassociation with the natural rhythms and harmonies of nature, but also becauseof its association with a celestial counterpart, the seven stars of the GreatBear. Even as early as 75,000 years ago, it seems, the Neanderthal consciousnesswas already nurturing the rudimentary elements of the theory of transcendentalevolution, possibly little more than twenty or so thousand years after theappearance of African Eve. By about 35,000 BCE, Eve’s descendants had migratedacross the habitable regions of the Earth and all but wiped out the Neanderthal.Today only a few bones and tools are left to testify to their existence. Indeed,according to the American geneticist Mark Stoneking of the University ofBerkeley, who has done extensive research on mitochondrial DNA, there aren’teven any original Neanderthal genes left in mankind’s gene pool. The evidencesuggests that the modern human—Cro-magnon, Homo sapiens sapiens—was an extremelyvigilant and ruthless exterminator. As Stoneking says, there are no non-Africanmitochondria in the genetic makeup of any individual living: “It looks likethere wasn’t any mating going on between the resident females and the migratingmales—at least none that produced a lasting genetic legacy.”11[26_note.html#fo71]However, as Gooch’s research has shown, they certainly left a lasting symbolic,or metaphysical, legacy. We see this, in part, in the astronomical observationsof both the Neanderthals and our forebears, the exterminators.For example, the constellation of the Great Bear was called by the ancientEgyptians the Mother of Time and was later regarded in India as the heavenlyhome of the septarishi, an embodiment of the seven properties (rishi) ofcreation. We thus have a definite link between the mythological and astrologicalbeliefs of the “primitive” hominid existing in the depths of the last ice ageand those of the priest-astronomers of Old Kingdom Egypt and Vedic India. Onewould expect such links to exist, of course, because that’s exactly howevolution works. Successful ideas are like successful genes and are passed on inexactly the same way, with or without the cognizance and cooperation of the host“organism.” The symbolism of the number seven is one such “gene,” and it hasbeen with us since the dawn of civilization. Gooch not only identifies thisnumber in the findings at Drachenloch, but also in another symbolicconfiguration known as the Cretan Labyrinth, which took the form of a sevenfoldspiral leading to a central point. This design appears in both the pre-ColumbianAmericas and in Minoan Crete—hence its name—which suggests that it originatedfrom a common, extremely ancient source dating back, Gooch suggests, as much as20,000 years. A simpler, less standardized design has been found on aPalaeolithic mammoth bone from Siberia, which again pushes its origins back atleast as far as the time of the bear cult of the Swiss Alps, circa 75,000 yearsago. This same “ritual labyrinth” is also found in the symbolic designs ofCornish, Rajastani, Hopi, Finnish, Welsh, and Etruscan art, all of which featurespirals with seven turns.In Greek mythology, Theseus was told by Ariadne that the maze, or labyrinth,consisted of one left-handed, seven-coiled path spiraling in, and oneright-handed path spiraling out—a kind of double-helix configuration throughwhich the initiate “danced” his or her way to freedom—or to enlightenment.12[26_note.html#fo72]Now let’s return for a moment to the conventional view of the hominid’s recentdevelopment, that the archetypal caveman was superseded by the slightly smarterbut equally cutthroat Cro-Magnon type around 35,000 years BCE. Some 25,000 yearslater, after enduring possibly the most treacherous and uninhabitable climaticconditions ever faced by mankind (the last ice-age meltdown), these peopleforegathered in and around the more temperate regions of the world.Now contrast this hungry, flint-wielding creature with the kind of human beingthat lived in the Fertile Crescent about five thousand years ago. From Egypt toMesopotamia there occurred, quite suddenly, an unprecedented bout of civilizedactivity. Great cities and highly refined cultures, the likes of which hadsupposedly never been seen before on Earth, grew and blossomed in the space of afew centuries. Suddenly man had learned to build on an unbelievable scale—notjust any-old-how, but with an expertise and precision that even today’sarchitects and engineers, using the same kinds of tools as the ancient buildersare supposed to have used, would find very difficult to match, let alonesurpass.As is usual when trying to assess the incredible achievements of these “childrenof the hunter-gatherers,” we shall take the classic example of the GreatPyramid, undoubtedly the largest and most complex building ever to have beenconstructed in stone. Each of its two and a half million or so blocks oflimestone averages 2.5 tons in weight, and some of the larger granite blocksincorporated hundreds of feet up in its interior structure weigh as much as 70tons. On top of all that, this monument, towering almost 150 meters above theGiza plateau, was originally sheathed in a two-and-a-half-meter-thick, exteriorlimestone casing of blocks weighing around fifteen tons apiece. These blockswere irregular in shape underneath and had to be made to fit the cruder contoursof the core masonry, but, quite remarkably, their exposed surfaces wereperfectly flat and polished so that they shone like glass. Further, each ofthese blocks, equivalent in weight to about thirty family-sized cars, was setwith cemented joints only a fraction of a millimeter wide. Archaeologists andastro-archaeologists alike tell us that this remarkable building was erectedaround 2500 BCE, and all of the available evidence supports this dating.So what was our primitive forebear doing for a living in the Fertile Crescent amillennium before this era? According to the current historical scenario, thenatives had barely learned to tame grass, let alone their restless minds; theywere merely surviving. But then, quite suddenly by evolutionary standards, thenatives not only learned to build on an unprecedented scale, to write and toadminister vast social enterprises, they also conjured up the remarkableHermetic Code, pulling it out of nowhere, like a rabbit out of a hat, and thenmankind suddenly came of age.Now this, I would suggest, is a massive developmental leap. According toDarwinian theory, macromutations seldom occur in nature, and if they do theyusually result in some kind of chronic deformity of the organism, whichgenerally results in extinction. Yet here we have an example in nature of agenuine macromutation—in this case in the mind of man—despite the fact that itseems to break the fundamental Darwinian rule of natural, selective evolution.So, what exactly happened? Is the Hermetic Code really the chance product of arandom macromutation in the brain of a fortunate member of the species Homosapiens sapiens, or was it purposely introduced by some kind of external force?Possibly we shall never know. Some of the authors mentioned earlier havesuggested that there existed, toward the end of the last ice age, around15,000–11,000 BCE, a high civilization that was almost completely destroyed in amassive global catastrophe. Dozens of myths and legends from all over the worlddescribe such an event, which apparently culminated in the Great Flood. Anunprecedented rise in sea levels would have been a natural result of emergencefrom the last ice age, when there was a rapid deglaciation of vast regions ofthe Earth’s surface.The legends from America and Egypt all say that there was only a handful ofsurvivors of this great cataclysm, seven or eight in number. In theJudaeo-Christian tradition these survivors are known as the Noahs, a seafaringpeople with extreme foresight who knew how to build and sail ships acrossoceans. They had also been initiated into the secrets of the Hermetic Code, asthe biblical records clearly show.13 [26_note.html#fo73]Elsewhere Noah and his companions (or similar survivors) were known by variousother names: Osiris or Thoth in Egypt, Viracocha in Peru and Bolivia,Quetzalcoatl in Mexico, Yu the Great in China, Manu in Vedic India, Deukalion inGreece, Utnapishtin in Babylon— the list goes on, through more than seventyflood legends from cultures worldwide.If these myths are in fact describing an actual event, then it is entirelypossible that some of the survivors of an earlier civilization passed on themain tenets of their knowledge to the early settlers of the Fertile Crescent. Sowhen ancient scriptures speak of “divine intervention” on the part of the “gods”from heaven above or whatever, possibly they are merely referring to thedissemination of a superior knowledge to a less advanced race, a perfectlylogical transference of consciousness from spheres “above” to spheres “below.”Of course, the Darwinist theory of gradual change through chance mutationsactually lends support to this idea that civilization is much older thanhistorians would have us believe. Even so, the question of whether or not theconcept of the Hermetic Code, however old it may be, originally evolvedgradually or appeared quite suddenly in the fertile mind of a singleinspirational genius remains unanswered. Perhaps the experiences of some modern“geniuses” can provide us with a clue here, for it is a well-known and acceptedfact that scientists themselves very often experience moments of inspirationalperception, intuitive insights that transcend logic.A typical example is the strange experience of the German chemist August Kekulé,who, after spending several hours laboriously working through a mundanetextbook, fell into a dispirited half-sleep, in which he saw long rows of atomsdancing before him, wriggling like snakes. When one of the snakes suddenlyseized its own tail with his mouth, Kekulé awoke to the realization that he hadjust “seen” what he had been long seeking—the precise chemical structure of thebenzene ring.Similarly, Henri Poincaré, the French mathematician, said that the solution to aparticularly difficult non-Euclidean geometry problem he had been grappling withcame to him quite suddenly, at a time when he was idly thinking about somethingfar removed from mathematics. Another great pioneering scientist, the astronomerJohannes Kepler, said that the discovery of his famous third law came to him as“a glimpse of light”; and Einstein, whose own “glimpses” into the mysteries ofspace and time are the stuff of modern legend, had this to say of scientificinvestigation: “There is no logical way to the discovery of these elementallaws. There is only the way of intuition.”14 [26_note.html#fo74]Perhaps, then, it was something like this flash of intuition (a macromutation ofthe mind) that was responsible for the conception of the Hermetic Code byThoth/Osiris/Viracocha or whoever. Or it may be that the idea evolved graduallyfrom the earlier instinctive impulses of the Neanderthals. We shall possiblynever know exactly how this change came about, but in any event we can see thatsuccessful macromutations do, in fact, occur frequently in nature. A flash ofintuition is precisely that.As I said, Darwinists exclude macromutations from the evolutionary process onthe grounds that gross physical changes are invariably detrimental to livingorganisms. And yet, regarding the origin of the very first intelligent entity toappear on this planet, the DNA–RNA complex, evolutionists’ arguments for agradual appearance are not entirely convincing.Scientists now believe that the first biomolecular self-replicators werefree-falling, bacterial RNA strands. Exactly what form their self-replicatingpredecessors took no one knows. Dawkins cites a proposal made by the biologistA. G. Cairns-Smith that the precursors to organic self-replicators might havebeen something like inorganic crystals, growing, say, in different sorts ofclays, constantly transported every-which-way by ever-changing waterflows.In fact, crystals do, in a sense, “grow,” one into another, the first array ofgeometrically aligned atoms and molecules acting as a template for the next. Asthey grow, crystals also produce, on occasions, flaws (mutations) in theirmolecular structure, which are then “copied” by the subsequent developinglayers. Crystals also possess right- and left-handed properties, that is, twovarieties—two or more kinds being the necessary prerequisite for the phenomenonof heredity, where “like begets like.” However, as Dawkins himself points out,crystal molecules only act as templates for the formation of molecules in theirmirror image. So, in this particular instance, like does not beget like.Chemists have been trying for many years to “trick” inorganic molecules intobreeding other molecules of the same handedness, but the natural forces at workin the inorganic molecular world are seemingly indifferent to such deception. Ifyou start cultivation with a left-hander crystal, you end up with an equalnumber of left-and right-handed molecules. Thus, says Dawkins, “although thefunction of an earlier, non-organic self-replicator didn’t involve ‘handedness,’a version of this trick was pulled off naturally and spontaneously four thousandmillion years ago.”15 [26_note.html#fo75]It seems to me that this statement is somewhat lacking in scientific clarity. Infact, the suggestion that some kind of evolutionary “trick” was spontaneously“pulled off” all those years ago has a distinct air of the magician about it, afamiliar, sleight-of-hand, “Hey, presto” quality, which suggests to me that itsauthor is really a Creationist at heart, one who does believe in some form of“immaculate conception” taking place here on Earth way back at the dawn ofgeological time.The analogy Dawkins uses in his book The Blind Watchmaker is that inorganiccrystal growth, producing mutational flaws over billions of years, happened,quite accidentally, to act as a kind of crude “scaf-folding” for the building ofa sophisticated biochemical “arch.” Once the final “center-stone” of the archfell into place (one of the four bases, perhaps?), then the previously formedcrystal “scaffolding,” greatly superseded by its biomolecular successor,involved, or collapsed, into extinction. The now animated “arch,” thebiomolecular descendent of this extremely primitive inorganic ancestor,eventually evolved blindly into entities like Jesus or Einstein, Hermes,Dawkins, and ourselves.According to Dawkins, “the digital revolution at the very core of life has dealtthe final, killing blow to “vitalism”—vitalism being the apparently mistakennotion that living material is deeply distinct from nonliving material. This iscertainly true in respect of the individual electrons and atoms of which livingmatter is composed, but when considering the overall symmetrical structure ofentire biomolecules, and the harmonious distribution of the electrons and atomswithin these beautiful, dynamic, musically structured life forms, then thefundamental difference between, for example, a molecule of the proteinhemoglobin and a molecule of water is surely glaringly obvious. Ergo,vitalism—my kind at least—is very much alive and kicking.We thus have two extremely advantageous macromutations in the otherwiseuneventful story of the evolution of life on Earth: the quantum transition fromsalt crystals or whatever, via something or other, to living, writhing,hermetically composed bacteria; and the incredibly rapid metamorphosis, over aperiod of time which by Darwinian standards is infinitesimally small, of AfricanEve into Marie Curie or Rosalind Franklin.But are successful macromutations really so very rare? Have they only everhappened at the beginning and at the end of this current evolutionary episode onplanet Earth? Perhaps not. For example, the transition from the single chemicalbase to the amino acid is a huge developmental leap. Again, the transition fromamino acid to protein molecule is also a massive step. And what about thetransition from bacterial RNA to the first self-contained cell, or the firstcell to a multicellular structure and so on, to the fish, the reptile, and thebird, the mammal, the hominid, and ultimately the civilization-builder?Evolutionists will argue that these marked changes in development only look likemacromutations, that they are in reality composed of untold billions of small,gradual, mutational steps. This may be so, but at some point in each of theseevolutionary lines there must have come a point during the transition from onestage of development to another when a clear distinction between the two wasfinally cast. A bird is only a bird when it is a bird, not before. And we knowthat, at some point, birds definitely did come into being. When this happened,when the first feathered creature finally took flight, a greater macromutationoccurred.Perhaps the evolution of the Hermetic Code proceeded along similar lines, wherea rudimentary instinctive awareness of the natural rhythms and harmonies ofnature took root in the primitive consciousness and then gradually began todevelop into a coherent belief system. One can envisage a scenario whereby thisprocess of recognition might have continued to evolve to the point where all thefundamental components of the Hermetic Code were instinctively incorporated intoritual practices, possibly without any conscious intervention on the part of anysingle individual. At a certain stage, however, someone, or a group of people,must have realized that the separate components of this instinctively adoptednumber symbolism could be incorporated into an overall cohesive theory ofevolution. Even if we don’t know exactly how and when, we know this happened,because the Hermetic Code “happened.” Gradualists, if they were to accept thatthe Hermetic Code is everything I say it is, or even that it exists, wouldprobably argue for a slow dawning of this cosmic awareness, a step-by-stepmethod of advancement.But, as we have seen, there is plenty of room for any number of successfulmacromutations in the long, fragmented story of our evolution, and one cannotdoubt that the “eureka” moment has been experienced untold times by millions ofhuman minds for tens of thousands of years. And this process, as we have noted,eventually culminated in the emergence of the Hermetic Code.If, as I believe, the Hermetic Code was a genuine macromutation, introduced byan extremely powerful external force into the receptive consciousness of theFertile Crescent, then perhaps the first, hermetically composed biomolecularself-replicators, which evolved along exactly the same hermetic principles, alsoreceived, right at the very beginning of the evolutionary chain, an external“leg-up,” to get them started.What I am suggesting is that there may be very real, unseen forces in thisuniverse that dictate that the evolution of DNA-based, or musically structured,life forms must inevitably, as and when conditions permit, occur everywhere inwhat is, after all, a musically structured arena. This is to say that theevolution of life on Earth, or anywhere else, far from being a chance, randomevent, is in fact an irresistible, natural process, dictated from start tofinish by the natural forces of the universe itself. And these are forces that,as we have seen, are described in meticulous detail by the two fundamental lawsof nature embodied in the Hermetic Code.It is now generally believed that life, in some form or another, very probablyexists elsewhere in the universe, though to what extent scientists can onlyspeculate. The astronomer Frank Drake, in his book Intelligent Life in Space,formulated an equation designed to give some idea of the likelihood of lifeexisting in other star-systems in our galaxy. The equation contains sevenapproximate factors, including the rate at which new stars form in our galaxyeach year, the proportion of planetary systems that might harbor planets with asuitable physical environment, the smaller fraction of such planets on whichlife might actually get started, the number of years life is expected to surviveon each planet—and so on. To get to the point, his answer, for our galaxy, isfive-to-one against just one other planet in the Milky Way harboring any form oflife whatsoever.In the next chapter we shall be exploring this question of “alien” life in moredetail. Being neither an astronomer nor mathematician, I will not be using longequations or intergalactic telephone numbers to explain why I believe that Drakehas got his sums drastically wrong. In fact, all the reader needs to follow theline of thought to my own conclusions is some ordinary common sense, anessential pinch of intuition and, of course, a basic understanding of theHermetic Code, the “theory of everything.”"},{"pageContent":"7Extraterrestrial DNAIn this chapter we shall be considering some of the further implications of thetheory of transcendental evolution. As we have seen, the neo-Darwinian theory ofevolution is unfinished: it explains only the evolutionary development oforganic bodies in the local biosphere of planet Earth. The theory oftranscendental evolution, however, presents the whole picture, and it tells usthat the process is continuing at an even higher level, beyond the confines ofthe physical brain of man, into scales of existence that ultimately encompassthe whole universe. Before I try to explain how such a mechanism might work,however, we need first to get back to basics, to the fundamental components ofthe material world.In previous chapters, we noted that the ancient Greeks had some rather unusualideas concerning the nature of matter. They believed that all material thingsare “psychic”—alive—and that they are influenced in some fundamental way bymusic. Today we find that modern scientists have proved them right on bothcounts. They have discovered mindlike qualities in the electron and “organic”traits in plasmas, and they have identified eightfold musical symmetries in thetwo major physical scales of the microworld: the atomic and the chromodynamic.Then, of course, we have light, the eightfold symmetry of the white ray, withits curious twin photons that can simultaneously “feel” what the other isfeeling, even if they are light years apart.Further, we have seen that similar hermetic symmetries are also evident in thebiomolecular world, with its sixty-four codon combinations and twenty-twoevolutionary amino-acid signals. This means, therefore, that the whole of themicroworld, from wave/particles to biomolecules, conforms very closely to theGreek view, which is that the entire universe is built, scale superimposed uponscale, of crystallized, ever-vibrant music.We thus have three fundamental harmonies in evidence in the microworld: thechromodynamic, the atomic, and the (bio)molecular. Underlying all of thesescales, of course, is the all-pervading harmony demonstrated by the “twinphoton” phenomenon, the “actions at a distance” called by Roger Penrose“nonlocal quantum correlations.” The whole universe is perpetually in motion andall wave/particles are continuously interacting and separating, which means thatthe nonlocal aspect of quantum systems is a general characteristic of nature.Clearly this represents, in the physical world, a harmony of the highestpossible order. It is one thing to say that the universe is a harmonious entitybecause it is constructed entirely upon the eightfold chromodynamic and atomicmatrices, but nonlocality suggests that there exists a far deeperinterconnecting harmony underlying all physical phenomena, where everything isresonating at the very same subquantum frequency, everything is “in tune” withevery other thing.We now come to another very ancient idea, which again seems to have firstsurfaced in the time of the early Greeks: the notion that the whole universe isitself a living, sentient being.The Greeks had a name for this creature, this universe. They called it the Zoon(pronounced “zohon”), the modern dictionary definition of which is“morphological individual, the total product of a fertilized ovum.” Of course,the originators of this particular concept might not have defined it in such aprecise way, but it seems obvious that they believed that the universe was ananimal, living, hence the notion of zoology, the study of the living, of whichRichard Dawkins himself is a professor. So the Greeks, I believe, regarded thecosmos as having somehow been conceived and then born, that it subsequently grewand is still growing, and that all systems within it, from the Earth and theplanets to the sun and the stars beyond, are vital components in the living bodyof the whole.As we know, the Greeks also believed, like the Egyptians before them, that theuniverse exists and operates according to musical principles, that is accordingto the fundamental laws described by the Hermetic Code. And the Hermetic Code,as we have seen, is identical in structure to the genetic code. This means thatthe universe, according to these traditions, is, in effect, an immense,multidimensional complex of evolving genes, that is, it is a biological entity.Let us note here that there is no ambiguity whatsoever in this ancientworldview. These people stated, in very clear and precise scientific (that is,musical) terms, that the Zoon is a zoon, so we may safely assume that they meantwhat they said.Now this may seem like a tall order, asking us to believe that we exist in theliving body of some mighty beast, some “god” of potentially infinite size. Butthen, not too long ago ideas about the hermetic symmetries involved in thecreation of life, of “psychic” matter and of “universal music” would almostcertainly have been regarded by scientists as being simply the fanciful productsof primitives’ dreams. And yet, ultimately, time has proved the ancients to befundamentally correct in these particular aspects of their worldview; music isindeed everywhere, both inside and outside us, or “above” and “below,” and thebasic components of matter continually resonate and even communicate, being byno means truly inert or “lifeless.”So now these ancient thinkers once again reach forward through thousands ofyears of time to confront us with another strange idea, one that has never, asfar as I am aware, been seriously considered either by alternative theorists ororthodox historians. This is the proposition that the whole universe is a livingorganism, quite literally, a biological entity.I must admit that when I was initially confronted with this rather strange ideaof a living universe I wasn’t quite sure what to make of it. It was difficult tosee how the greater components of the cosmos—such as all-consuming black holes,exploding supernovae, collapsing clouds of interstellar dust and all the othercataclysmic events taking place out there—could ever be construed as life. Onthe face of things, the proposition seemed absurd, or so I at first thought. Butat the back of my mind I harbored a sneaking suspicion that these ancientpeople, who were so knowledgeable in other respects concerning the nature ofreality, were not just simply fantasizing about their “living god,” but had somebasis for their belief.So I began to investigate, to search for evidence of this. It seemed at first animpossible task. After all, if the universe is a sentient being, where is its“head,” its “heart,” and all the other organic components necessary for a bodyto exist? Answer: nowhere to be seen. Nevertheless I kept looking, scouringbooks on cosmology, astronomy, and astrophysics and the like. I learned quite alot about the cosmos that was to stand me in good stead for what was to follow,but there were no obvious clues in the writings of modern scientists as to thepossible nature of the creature I was searching for.But then, after long deliberating and vacantly scratching my head, I suddenlyexperienced one of those familiar “eureka” moments when, out of the blue, a newperspective dawned in my mind. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the answer—or atleast, a major clue on its trail—came not from the modern scientist but fromHermes himself.The clue lies in the now familiar saying of Thoth/Hermes, “As above, so below.”What this undoubtedly means is that the world above—the greater cosmos—isfundamentally the same as the world below, the world of man. Obviously thescales are vastly different, but, according to Hermes, their inherent structureis based on the same hermetic blueprint. And remember, the Hermetic Code and thegenetic code are also identical in every way, so we can see quite clearly that,in respect to the world of man and the world of the cell, the hermetic dictumjust quoted is directly and exactly applicable. The genetic code operates in themicrocosm, the world of cells, and the Hermetic Code operates in the mesocosm,the world of man. And each of them, of course, shares a common purpose, which isto facilitate the processes of creation, of evolution.Now DNA is quite clearly the prime mover in the biomolecular world. It is DNAthat employs the genetic code to manufacture amino acids, which other organiccomponents then assemble into proteins. The purpose of proteins in thebiomolecular world is clear; they engineer all the complex chemical processesthat build a living body. So what happens when the human mind employs theHermetic Code? Does it, as I have already suggested, produce the metaphysicalequivalent of amino acids? Possibly. At least it produces ideas, thoughts, andconcepts, which are born of our conscious ability to emote, sense, and perceive.So on to the obvious question: are these concepts integral parts of a muchbigger evolutionary process that takes place somewhere “out there”? That is, ifthe genetic code describes an organic process, is not the Hermetic Codesimilarly describing an organic process, but one that operates on a much greaterand more rarefied scale? If this is the case—and I am, of course, proposing thatit could be—then there would probably be in existence other, greater, organiccomponents out there in the macrocosm that could somehow assemble thesemetaphysical “amino acids” (thoughts, concepts, and so forth) into theconceptual equivalent of protein chains. As I said moments ago, the purpose ofproteins in the biomolecular world is to engineer all the complex chemicalprocesses that are necessary to build a living body.As the reader will by now have realized, what is being implied here is that thehuman mind is a form of “double helix,” a chromosome in the nucleus of a livingcell in the body of a much greater being. And then, further, possibly the “mind”of this greater being is also but a single-cell nucleus in a being on an evengreater scale . . . and so on, but not, as we shall see, ad infinitum.So let us now follow this lead as we were probably intended to and turn ourattention skyward, toward the heavens. If Thoth/Hermes is right, one wouldexpect there to be signs of this “extraterrestrial” life up there in themacrocosm—massive, cosmic, organic structures, not unlike the structure of ourchromosomes. And what do we find up there in the greater cosmos? Significantly,there are spirals and helices, literally everywhere, in all potential solarsystems, in all galaxies. In the case of our own solar system, we see theplanets encircling the sun, but as the entire system is perpetually moving atgreat velocity through space, the path traced by each planet is, in fact, aspiral. Similarly, most galaxies are spiral galaxies, which is meaningful initself, but even so-called elliptical and irregular galaxies all revolve arounda galactic center—maybe a black hole—and all of them are hurtling across theuniverse at tremendous speeds, so the trajectory traced through space-time byevery star is a true spiral, a helix. Furthermore, we ourselves, as we sit,walk, or even sleep on the surface of the Earth, are actually tracing spiralsthrough space: the whole planet spins like a top as it moves ever onward.It is true, of course, that DNA is a double-helix structure, but in thebiomolecular world there are many single-helix structures—viruses, bacteria, andso forth—composed of single strands of DNA’s close cousin, RNA. Moreover, whenwe think we see a single spiral out there in space, we are not necessarilytaking in the whole picture. That is, there may be “invisible” helices that wealso need to identify. In a typical galaxy, for example, scientists havediscovered that the visible spiral arms, composed of stars—of light—areenveloped by an accompanying magnetic field that actually spirals around each ofthe arms. Again, in the solar system there are several planets, each onespiraling along its respective trajectory, but if you consider the combinedpaths of any two of them in relation to one another, the result, quite clearly,would be a double-helix configuration. The point is, it is the helix itself,whether single, double, or even multiple, which appears to be the basic designfor all evolutionary phenomena, above and below.Is it not highly significant, therefore, that the Egyptians and the Greeks, inwhose belief systems the firmament above was so important, should have aprincipal god of wisdom whose symbol was a magic wand known as the caduceus,featuring a double helix in the form of two entwined serpents surmounted withwings? Clearly this symbol, like the Great Pyramid, which is aligned soprecisely with key stars in the Duat (sky), is inducing us to look heavenward.The same can be said of the serpent/thunderbolt symbols of Viracocha and theplumed serpent of Quetzalcoatl, of which the most impressive depiction of all isthe effect at the spring and autumn equinoxes of the sun’s light undulating likea serpent up the northern staircase of the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichén Itzá,Mexico.After I had identified these “serpents in the sky” it seemed to me that the mostlogical thing to do would be to be to try to follow their trail and see where itmight lead. This was, after all, the route taken by Osiris and Thoth, and all ofthe other principal “civilizers” of the ancient world.The fact that Sirius and Zeta Orionis, the two most important stars in Egyptiancosmology, are targeted by the southern shafts of the two principal chambers ofthe Great Pyramid suggests that the pyramid itself provides a vital link betweenworlds above and below. The name of the Great Pyramid—“The Lights”—suggestsfurther that light is the cosmic intermediary, the interface between man andgod, the earth and the stars. And light itself, as we have noted, is a musicalphenomenon: the most resonant octave in existence. Therefore music is the key.But then music is a hermetic phenomenon, and the Hermetic Code describes exactlyhow the genetic code operates, and how organisms grow.What I believe is implied here is that we, in our quest to discover the secretsof the universe, have literally to evolve our way to the stars, to grow so as tobe able to touch the firmament merely by holding out our hands. The kind of“growth” we are talking about here, of course, is the evolution of the mind, an“alchemical” process of development that leads ultimately to a condition ofoptimum psychological harmony and an awareness of the nonlocal realm of heaven,the timeless plane of light. Here, Osiris/Orion is everyone’s immediateneighbor.So let’s now try to envisage how this spiritual growth might develop. By this Imean the process by which consciousness can eventually tune in to the nonlocaldimension, or to the metaphysical frequencies characteristic of light quanta.We have seen how, in the microcosm, the most powerful transmitter of intelligentdata is the DNA double helix, which codes for complex biochemical processes withsuch precision that it can create the brain of a human being. In the microworld,this evolutionary music played by DNA represents a harmony of the highestpossible order.The human brain, the ultimate product of DNA’s evolutionary development, is morethan just a biological organ like a heart or a liver. It possessesself-awareness and can perform a whole range of extra-biological or metaphysicalfunctions—intellectual, speculative, intuitive, or whatever. This is to say, thehuman brain, like the double helix from which it originates, can generatetranscendental influences. Through literature, artifacts, buildings, and so on,it can transmit “biometaphysical” signals to spheres far removed from thephysical body in which it exists. Thus the designers of the Great Pyramid, forexample, or the I Ching, or the authors of the Christian Scriptures, the Koran,or the Upanishads, living in the remote past in distant parts of the world, arestill speaking to you now through these and many other contemporarycommentaries. These works are, in effect, transcendental phenomena, metaphysicalgenes, coded to synthesize—in the mind of the human being—higher, more complex,modes of cognition.As we can see, both the DNA double helix and the human brain function instrikingly similar ways. In the concluding chapter of The Infinite Harmony Isuggested that the conscious/subconscious aspects of the human brain, with itsright and left hemispheres, could be regarded as the metaphysical equivalent ofthe acid/alkaline aspects of the DNA strand, with its “right” and “left”nucleotide chains. Both work with the same hermetic/genetic blueprint, with itsfour “bases,” its sixty-four possibilities and its twenty-two transcendental orevolutionary “signals.” Thus the music being played in the microcosmic processesof evolution is being echoed, note for note, in the mesocosmic scale above, inwhich the human mind is the principal player. So the ancient dictum “As above,so below” means, quite literally, that the only difference between the DNAdouble helix below—the chromosome—and the fully functioning human brain above issimply one of scale. Both work with exactly the same numbers and combinations offorces and components, but the components themselves are graded accordingly, thebases used by DNA presumably being of a less rarefied form of resonance than the“bases” from which higher frequencies of consciousness are developed.So what exactly are these “bases” from which consciousness is created? In theHermetic Code they are symbolized by the four base notes—the four Dos—of thetriple octave, which correspond to the four base pebbles of the PythagoreanTetrad discussed in the last chapter. Now these bases, like the free-floatingchemical bases in the living cell, would theoretically be everywhere, all aroundus, waiting to be scooped up by the double helix of the mind, combined into moreresonant units, and finally passed on for future synthesis at a higher level ofdevelopment. These bases, I would suggest, come to us in the form of ourimpressions, namely our sensations, emotions, and perceptions, the trinity, ortriple octave, within us all. There is a fourth, of course, a crucial,transcendental base, the product of the harmonious interaction of the firstthree, which, if fully developed, manifests in the form of our concepts, ourconceptions.We have here, I think, the origin of the much misunderstood Christian notion ofthe “immaculate conception.” Jesus’s teachings, for example, in beingpsychologically harmonious, were immaculately conceived, born of a conscious,highly developed mind. We know they are immaculate because, just like theequally resilient concepts of, say, Pythagoras, the Buddha, or Muhammad, theyhave ultimately harmonized with the evolving psyches of billions of individuals.You could, of course, argue, as Dawkins might, that these world-wide religiousand philosophical movements have evolved purely by chance and that they haveplayed on the inherent weaknesses of desperate human beings wishing to escapethe tedium and pain of Darwinian existence by clinging on to vague, unfoundedpromises of an afterlife in Paradise. Doubtless the element of escapism is acontributory factor in the development of many self-help cultures, past andpresent, but the fact that the world’s major religious movements are all basedon the principles of “esoteric music” embodied in the Hermetic Code stronglysuggests that accident really has very little to do with it. Just think for amoment: What are the chances of your ideas, or those of Darwin, Einstein, orDawkins (or your own modern hero or heroine), entering and attuning with theminds and hearts of whole races of people?Significantly, in the microworld of the cell, “immaculate conceptions,” ormacromutations, are the very life-blood of creation. All evolutionaryadvancements, all transcendental developments, are “immaculately” created: aminoacids, protein molecules, eyes, legs, wings, brains. So of course Jesus wasimmaculately conceived. But then so was African Eve, Tyrannosaurus rex, and,paradoxically, the AIDS virus. Life is like that.So if the human brain is a form of chromosome, a metaphysical double helix, thenpresumably it is also an integral component—a “cell nucleus”—in the greater bodyof an infinitely more complex, macrocosmic “organism,” a creature that, oneassumes, is formed from the collective evolutionary consciousness of the entirehuman race.As a matter of fact, a scenario not dissimilar to this was put forward in theearly 1950s by the American writer Rodney Collin in his book The Theory ofCelestial Influence. I have quoted at length from this unique work elsewhere.Collin was a close associate of Ouspensky, and he spent several years compilingthis scientific interpretation of Gurdjieff’s original ideas. The book has notyet received the worldwide acceptance long overdue to it, but I believe the timewill come when the writings of all three of these highly innovative thinkerswill be recognized as great achievements.In the final chapter of his book, entitled “Man in Eternity,” Collin tries toimagine the form and structure of the greater “body” of the human race.Everyone, he says, creates an invisible thread of converging energies as he orshe lives along their own particular line of time, each thread being unique to ahuman being. If one imagines, across the centuries, billions upon billions ofthese threads, crossing and interlacing with one another, varying in “color” andintensity according to the kind of life lived, then there emerges a figure sointricate that it is, in fact, a solid, the “solid of humanity”:Of this solid we can even have a certain vague apprehension. It will be, as itwere, a sort of solid tapestry, composed of billions of threads, which in spiteof their inconceivably elaborate weaving, appear all to lie in the samedirection which is eternity. We can even suppose each of these threads to have adifferent nature or color, according to the level of energy which dominates itstotality of lives. And we might find that in large areas or periods of humanity,a certain nature or color dominates the whole design—the red of purely physicalexistence, the yellow of intellectual activity, or the green of moving skill andsensation. Remembering the existence of men with conscious souls, and withconscious spirits, we shall also suppose threads of different materiality whichstand out from the fabric in a quite exceptional way, which impart life to therest, and about which the whole design of the solid body is formed. For thosethreads are threads only in our metaphor. In fact they are alive and their totalmass is alive. They are the cells and capillaries and nerves of a body, the AdamKadmon of The Kabala, Mankind.1 [26_note.html#fo76]Adam Kadmon has appeared elsewhere in ancient mythology. He is the titan Atlasof the Greeks, who, remember, believed that the human race could change theworld if it could harmonize itself into an overall coherent state of homonoia.And if the earlier-discussed evidence for psychokinesis is accepted, togetherwith the recognized power of “group consciousness,” by which a fully grownindividual can be lifted with very little physical effort, then we can say thatthe kind of “resonances” obtained in such an orchestrated process of thought arereal, they must have some sort of substance. According to the theory oftranscendental evolution, this substance, the living stuff of consciousness, iscreated in precisely the same way as are all other manifestations of life, thatis hermetically, genetically. Thus evolutionary consciousness itself is quiteliterally composed of metaphysical signals, or “notes,” which have been copiedfrom “genes” housed in the electrochemical structure of other mesocosmic“helices,” other human brains.The characteristic spiral form of DNA has been photographed in its totalitythrough a process known as X-ray diffraction. It is clearly a double helix, andall DNA molecules in every living plant or animal are structured in exactly thesame way. This DNA does not suddenly appear fully formed: it develops in alinear fashion over a given period of time. As the parent DNA ladder “unzips” atone end prior to cell division, and free-floating bases link up with the openends of the split rungs, two identical chromosomes are formed.2[26_note.html#fo77]It might be argued that the description “double helix” cannot reasonably beapplied to the two hemispheres of the brain, which look more likethree-dimensional segments of some weird exotic fruit than the structuralfeatures of a chromosome. But of course, like DNA, we must assume that thismetaphysical “chromosome” does not appear read-ymade, but requires a givenperiod of time to develop its overall form, and that this unfolds in a linearfashion. Time is the line and the period in question is a lifetime. And whatexactly happens during the lifetime of an individual brain? Remember that thetwo hemispheres have a physical existence on the surface of a planet that isspinning endlessly on its axis as it soars through space. Therefore, eachhemisphere is in fact tracing a spiral, a helix, through space and time. Takentogether the overall configuration is, of course, a double helix.So the human brain is an evolving double helix developing in time, at one end ofwhich lies conception, at the other, death. All that happens between, all ourexperiences in life, both conscious and sub-conscious, define the particular“color,” or quality, of each evolving mesocosmic “chromosome.” The mostsuccessful or the most resonant of the “genes” in these chromosomes, like, say,the “bright,” enduring ideas and concepts of those such as the Buddha, Christ,or Muhammad, are those that are replicated most, in succeeding generations, byother metaphysical chromosomes, other human brains.The DNA structure of living cells has two sides to it, two chains made up ofsugar, phosphate, and nitrogenous bases, each side being a mirror image of theother. The two chains are held together by the bases: adenine, thymine,cytosine, and guanine. Adenine always links up with thymine, and guanine alwaysjoins with cytosine. Similarly the human brain, as we have seen, also has twosides to it, the conscious processes of the left hemisphere and the subconsciousprocesses of the right. As with DNA, these different aspects of the twohemispheres are inextricably linked to one another by “bases,” by ourexperiences in life, born of our sensations, emotions, perceptions, andconceptions.This, then, forms the core of the ancients’ view of mankind’s evolution.Consciousness is an organic phenomenon, it develops according to the dictates ofthe Hermetic Code, and its natural inclination is to grow upward and outward,toward the stellar scale of existence, the nonlocal plane of light. So asconsciousness evolves, the whole of the human race, like the pyramid builders ofthe ancient world, will be working together in states of ever-increasing harmonyto build, in a higher dimension, a vastly more complex, macrocosmic structure.Theoretically such an entity would either possess, or would be evolving, a“brain” of its own, an immense “solar” helix that, in terms of scale andcomplexity, would be as far removed from the individual mesocosmic doublehelix—the human brain—as the mesocosmic double helix is from microcosmic DNA. Ifthis is true, then we should expect to find the main components of this helicalstructure in the cosmos above.We already have a clue as to the manner in which this awesome, extraterrestriallife form might evolve. This arises from a suggestion I made previously, whichis that the creative processes in the metaphysical world of the human mindinvolve some kind of interplay between light and consciousness. This is to saythat these two complementary yet quite distinct phenomena are the maincomponents of conception/ creation, opposite sides, as it were, of the samemetaphysical coin.Excluding starlight, the source of all light in our solar system is the sun. Andthe source of all consciousness, as we know it, is the Earth. Thus we see thatthis macrocosmic structure, exactly like its micro- and mesocosmic counterparts,has two fundamental aspects to it.In the case of the DNA molecule, its two main characteristics are its acidic andits alkaline properties. Its function is to take in data in the form ofindividual chemical bases, which it then transmutes “up” into the more resonantRNA components, finally transmitting them back out into the cytoplasm, theliquid membrane of the cell, for future synthesis. Similarly the human brain,with its conscious and subconscious characteristics, also takes indata—impressions, perceptions, and so forth—that it then transmutes into a kindof metaphysical “light,” subsequently radiated out into the world in the form ofideas, concepts, and the like.So, with regard to the double helix in the sky, we might say that the sun is its“acidic,” or conscious aspect, and that life on planet Earth is themanifestation of its “alkaline” or subconscious aspect. Presumably the celestialdouble helix too would take in data of some kind, which it would then transmuteup and radiate out, but exactly what form this might take is perhaps a questionthat only Adam Kadmon him-self could answer. However, we can speculate. If thereare macrocosmic “bases” up there, they must be pretty big, and the biggestcomponents of the solar system are the other planets and asteroids, all of whichradiate some kind of magnetic influence out into the greater system.Significantly, the ancient Greek pantheon of the gods, Zeus and his celestialfamily, was closely associated with the sun and the planets, each of which wasregarded as being imbued with life. They also referred frequently to the “musicof the spheres,” believing that the whole solar system is a hermetic creation.And hermetic, of course, is genetic, organic.It so happens that this “music of the spheres” is not simply folk-lore, butfact. Rodney Collin noted that the major and minor conjunctions of the planetsall “beat out” certain rhythms that can be numerically defined in a regularsequence of harmonic intervals developing in time. When he subsequently made acomparative table of these conjunctions, he discovered that the figuresobtained, taken as vibrations, represent the relative values of the fundamentalnotes of the major scale.As he says, the periodicity of a planet’s magnetic influence follows the timenecessary for it to return to the same relative position of closest proximity toEarth. Collin takes as the point of departure of each planetary cycle the momentwhen the sun, the Earth, and the given planet are in a straight line. The cycleof that planet is thus the time that elapses before such a conjunction occursagain; it is the “interval” between the recurring moment when the three magneticforces of sun, Earth, and the given planet act together in the same way.Mercury and Venus repeat their maximum magnetic effect every eight years, theasteroids every nine, Jupiter twelve, Mars fifteen, and Saturn thirty. Whenthese various rhythms are superimposed one sees an interesting sequence ofharmonic intervals, each stage of which is marked by the major conjunctions ofone or more planets. Every twenty-four years Jupiter completes two full cycles,Venus and Mercury, three each. The next significant stage occurs everytwenty-seven years, at which the asteroids complete three full cycles. Everythirty years Mars completes two cycles and Saturn one. Every thirty-two years,Venus and Mercury each complete four cycles. Every thirty-six years, Jupiterruns through three cycles and the asteroids complete four. The next stage isforty years, during which Venus and Mercury each run through five cycles. Everyforty-five years Mars completes three cycles and the asteroids five. Finally,every forty-eight years, Jupiter completes four cycles and Venus and Mercuryeach complete six full cycles. This sequence is constant, repeating itselfendlessly.We thus have a table of the numbers of years, beginning at 24, rising up through27, 30, 36, 40, 45—and ending on 48, exactly double the value of the number webegan with. This is significant, for not only does this series of numbersconform to the relative values of the notes of a major scale, exactly like anoctave of music, it also expresses the ratio 1:2. Collin concludes: “And we arereminded of old stories that this same musical scale, ascribed by legend to thePythagoreans, was invented by a special school of astronomers and physicists, toecho the music of the spheres.”When we tried to envisage the “double helix” formed from the two hemispheres ofthe human brain as they interact along the line of time, we noted that the trueform of the whole evolving phenomenon spans the life of the individual, fromconception to death. The “double helix” of the solar system exists in an evengreater dimension, and so in terms of size and duration of existence must be asfar removed from the mesocosmic scale of the human brain as the human brain isfrom the microcosmic scale of the individual cell’s chromosomes. Consequently wemust try to view the basic chromosomal structure of the “solar being” inrelation to the cycles of the planets, and in particular of Earth. We might say,therefore, that this macrocosmic “chromosome” started to develop when Homosapiens sapiens first began thinking in simple concepts and that it willcontinue until such time as consciousness on Earth ceases to exist. It is aboutone hundred thousand years or so since the Neanderthal or early Cro-Magnon firststarted mining for red ochre in southern Africa, not long after the beginning ofthe last ice age. It is believed that the ochre was for ritual rather thanpractical purposes, suggesting that the evolution of “consciousness” was wellunder way by then. So the solar being of mankind is at least a hundred millenniaold.Over this expanse of time, the helical patterns traced by the components of thesolar system as it spins like a giant Catherine wheel through space form animmensely long and complex figure. Collin describes this four-dimensionalstructure in his own unique style:The planetary paths, drawn out into manifold spirals of various tensions anddiameters, have now become a series of iridescent sheaths veiling the white-hotthread of the sun, each shimmering with its own characteristic color and sheen,the whole meshed throughout by a gossamer-fine web woven from the eccentricpaths of innumerable asteroids and comets, glowing with some sense of livingwarmth and ringing with an incredibly subtle and harmonious music.3[26_note.html#fo78]Collin did not identify this structure as a “chromosome” as such, but thereference made to its living warmth was certainly intended to be takenliterally. As he says a little further on, “the solar-system is, in some wayincomprehensible to us, a living body.”The Greeks, as we have seen, shared much the same view, but they also believedthat this immense, musically structured entity is a conscious being with a mindof its own. Presumably this would be a mind that, like ours, takes in externaldata—impressions of some kind— and out of them constructs the macrocosmicequivalent of concepts. Clearly the possible nature of such data isincomprehensible to us. If the body of the solar being is constructed frommetaphysical “amino acids,” that is from our concepts coupled with light, thenthe “mind” of the entity would inevitably function with much higher, morerarefied energies, perhaps operating at velocities far greater than the speed oflight. According to Special Relativity, of course, nothing can travel fasterthan light. Physicists have in the past tried to overcome this limitation bydreaming up a new kind of particle, a “tachyon,” a hypothetical entity, existingin a higher dimension, that travels back-ward in time at speeds greater than thevelocity of light, but never below it. Theoretically the tachyon cannot exist,but even if it did, we might never know it, because any particles moving(backward in time) at such a phenomenal speed could never be detected by anyknown scientific means.At any rate, if the solar “mind” is a reality, then there must be some form ofenergy sustaining it. And if light is the limiting factor in the mesocosm, thenperhaps the limiting factor in the greater scale above is in some way directlyrelated to it.As it turns out, in the Hermetic Code we have a clue to the possiblerelationship between these two scales. The key number is 64, the number ofamino-acid templates in a living cell, the number of hexagrams in the I Ching.Sixty-four is the square of the constant number 8—8 being the symbol of theoctave, the fundamental component of pi, and the basic matrix of all creativeprocesses.Remember also that this number was closely associated with the Great Pyramid,which was itself closely associated not only with the phenomenon of light butalso with the stars, with the stellar scale above. It seems to me very unlikelythat the symbolism involved in the whole pyramid phenomenon should be accidentalor arbitrary. The details are too precise for that. We have the Great Pyramiditself, “The Lights,” designed and constructed by the followers of the god ofwisdom, one in a pantheon of eight gods, whose symbol was two entwined plumedserpents, and whose “Magic Square” embodies all the numbers from 1 to 64. Surelywe are being told here that the key to transcendental evolution is the square ofthe constant, that the sacred metamorphosis from man to god described in thepyramid ritual represents the squaring of one’s possibilities. Possibly this iswhy the ancient names for the Great Pyramid are in the plural: Khuti, “TheLights,” in Egyptian and Urim middin; “Lights-measures” in Chaldee and Hebrew.So, while modern science denies the possibility of superluminal(faster-than-light) motion, the ancients’ description of cosmic events stronglysuggests that, in one way or another, it is an attainable reality. Of course thelimitations imposed by Special Relativity refer to matter as we know it, thesmallest components of which are sub-atomic or virtual wave/particles. However,the scale of materiality need not necessarily end with the wave/particle.Readers may recall that the physicist David Bohm’s research led him to concludethat consciousness itself is a form of matter. But if consciousness is a form ofmateriality, it is clearly one of an entirely different order than the kind wecan detect or measure, and so may not be bound by the normal laws of physics.Now there are, in fact, phenomena in existence, such as correlated photons, forexample, the nonlocal connectedness of which produces in the observer theillusion that something passing between them is “moving” at speeds far greatereven than the square of the constant velocity. We shall return to this questionof nonlocal communication later, as I believe it may provide a mechanism bywhich information can be transferred across the entire universe, from onemacrocosmic “organism” to another, in less time than it takes to blink.For the moment, however, we can tentatively hold on to this idea: the value ofthe square of the speed of light may be the diffusion speed of the interactive“resonances” of the solar mind.Now we must move on—always upward, of course—and continue the incredible journeyfirst made by the serpent gods of wisdom."},{"pageContent":"8Interstellar Genes and the Galactic Double HelixIn the four-dimensional structure of the solar system’s long body we have seenhow the planetary trails, all encircling the white-hot thread of the sun, formimmense helices in space. If we imagine each of these individual sheaths to becoupled in some way with the greater spiral motion of the sun, as there are nineplanets, we can say that there are nine “solar” helices. One of these, formed bythe combined motion of the Earth and the sun, is fundamentally different fromall the others, in that it contains life, consciousness, you, and me. Thisparticular double helix is the “brain” of the solar being, the mind of AdamKadmon.But, of course, if this solar being is indeed organic, a “chromosome,” then,theoretically, like all helices it too would have the capacity, in a stillhigher dimension, to create, to build even greater, more complex forms of life.So, just as DNA forms the nucleus of a cell in a physical body, and the humanbrain forms the nucleus of a cell in the solar body of mankind, so too would themind of this solar being form the nucleus of a cell in the greater, galacticbody. This further quantum leap, from the scale of the solar system to thevaster galactic scale, means that the human brain, earlier defined as themesocosmic double helix between DNA below and the solar configuration above, nowbecomes a microcosmic entity in a yet larger existence, in which the solar beingrepresents the mesocosmic creative force, and the galactic body the macrocosmic.We shall take a closer look at these relative scales later in this chapter.In the last chapter we noted that Rodney Collin had discovered that the orbitalcycles in the planets of the solar system produce major and minor conjunctionsin time, whose relative values correspond very closely to the harmonicproportions of the major scale. This legendary “music of the spheres” wasfrequently alluded to by the writers of ancient Greece: it was referred to byPlato as the “song of the sirens.” The hermetic symmetry of these planetarymotions, as I have suggested, is an indication that there are genetic, organicprocesses operating in the planetary sphere.It so happens that, very recently, further evidence has come to light concerningthe relationship between the masses of certain stars that seems to indicate thatthis planetary harmony may extend far beyond the solar system, out into thegalaxy.While I was working through the second draft of this book, which did not theninclude what follows, I received a phone call from Colin Wilson. He said he hadbeen asked to review an updated edition of a book by Robert Temple called TheSirius Mystery, first published in 1976, in which there was some veryinteresting cosmological data that he felt would be of interest to me. Colin hadalready seen a hastily written first draft of this book and had been kind enoughto offer some suggestions as to its presentation and format. So he knew exactlywhere I was coming from and promptly realized the relevance of Temple’sconclusions to my work. He duly sent me a copy of The Sirius Mystery, which Ihad first read many years ago, but this new edition, as he had promised, provedto be very interesting indeed.Temple is the man who introduced to the world the Dogon tribe of Africa, whoseancient and secret traditions contain very precise astrophysical data aboutSirius and two other invisible stars in the Sirius system that have only beendiscovered in recent times. These two hidden companions of Sirius are knownrespectively as Sirius B, a white dwarf star first photographed in 1970 byIrving W. Lindenblad of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.,1[26_note.html#fo81] and Sirius C, a red dwarf star whose existence was onlyofficially confirmed in 1995 by the French astronomers J. L. Duvent and DanielBenest.2 [26_note.html#fo82] The Dogon, it appears, were well ahead of theirtime.Temple believes, reasonably enough, that this knowledge came to them in theremote past, probably from Egypt. Then he advances the theory that the Egyptiansand the Sumerians obtained this knowledge directly from highly advancedamphibious extraterrestrials from the Sirius star system. He cites as part ofhis evidence the prominence in certain myths of amphibious creatures, half-man,half-fish, who were said to have founded the first civilizations in the FertileCrescent. The leading “fish deity” was known under various names on the easternflank of the Crescent, although in Egypt there is no major god answering to thedescription given. In Babylon and Assyria this god was known as Oannes (possiblyan early form of the name John); in Sumeria, Enki; and to the Dogon tribe inAfrica, Nommo.I have to say that Temple’s idea of amphibious spacemen flying in from Siriuswith their superior wisdom is not my favorite explanation for the birth ofEarthling civilization. A more plausible theory is that the ancient civilizersappearing in all the major myths, said to have survived a Great Flood, landed onthe shores of their new homeland in boats—hence the emphasis on the element ofwater. This proposition is further supported by the theory of transcendentalevolution itself, as interpreted in many ancient legends, in which the basicelement of water is primarily an evolutionary symbol, expressing the centralimportance of the passive, “watery” element in the process of creation (seechapter 9 [17_chapter09.html]).So, according to the theory of transcendental evolution, superior or“extraterrestrial” intelligence actually develops from below. And it grows,evolves, organically, ever upward, toward the stars. Temple’s view thereforeappears to be upside down. His arguments in support of his theory are extensive,suggesting technical maneuvers on the part of the “fish gods” that defycomparison with anything ever accomplished on Earth, including the constructionof the Great Pyramid. These include the use of water-filled spaceships capableof interstellar flight, and also the construction of Phoebe, thesmooth-surfaced, tenth moon of Saturn, which Temple believes may be anartificial, water-filled satellite constructed, or perhaps “inflated,” by thesefishlike creatures and used as a kind of staging post on their intermittentjourneys to and from Earth.Notwithstanding our obvious differences concerning the true nature of “alien”life, Temple has discovered some interesting new facts concerning the Siriussystem and our own sun, which appear to link both star systems with the Gizaplateau, in particular with the Great Pyramid and the second Pyramid of Khafre(Chephren).As the Great Pyramid has an apparent Sirius connection (that is, the southernshaft emanating from the Queen’s Chamber, which targeted Sirius as it culminatedat the meridian at the time of construction of the Great Pyramid), Templeproposes that it might be a representation of the “invisible” star, Sirius B,and that the slightly smaller Pyramid of Khafre represents our own sun. Thisview might appear to fly in the face of the suggestion made by Robert Bauvalthat the three Giza Pyramids represent the three stars of Orion’s Belt. Thewhole necropolis, however, as we have seen, is extraordinarily multifaceted, soit would hardly be surprising if we were to find yet more information relatingto the Sirius system encoded within the design.Temple begins by comparing the sides of the slightly larger base of the GreatPyramid (755.79 feet) with the sides of the base of the Pyramid of Khafre(707.75 feet), calculating that the sides of the Great Pyramid are 1.0678 timesthose of Khafre’s. He then notes, using the newest available astrophysical data,that the mass of Sirius B is 1.053 times the mass of our sun. As he says:The correspondence is thus accurate to 0.014. However, even this tinydiscrepancy may be highly significant. For 0.0136 (which rounded off is 0.014)is the precise discrepancy between the mathematics of the octave and themathematics of the fifth in harmonic theory, where 1.0136 is referred to as theComma of Pythagoras, and was known to the ancient Greeks, who are said to haveobtained knowledge of it from Egypt.3 [26_note.html#fo83]As a matter of fact, I have already discussed the Pythagorean Comma in myearlier book, in which I proposed that it was intended to highlight thefundamental difference between ordinary, practical music and what I call“esoteric” music—ordinary music, I believe, having been considered by thePythagoreans as being slightly “off-key” from the true harmonic constant fromwhich life is created.Temple expresses much the same idea in his revised version of The SiriusMystery, in which he calls the discrepancy of 0.0136 (rounded off to 0.014) theParticle of Pythagoras: “Essentially, one could say that it expresses the minutediscrepancy between the ideal and the real.”4 [26_note.html#fo84]Temple’s “ideal” music in this context is what I would call “esoteric.” “Real”music therefore is ordinary practical music. The harmonic deviation described bythe comma is significant, raising the wider issue of how this discrepancy mighthave been rectified by the Pythagoreans: how they transformed ordinary musicinto what Temple calls the “ideal” kind. I have dealt with this in some detailin The Infinite Harmony, where I suggest that the marginal imperfection ofordinary music was connected with the “glitches” of the major scale. As Ipointed out in the introduction of this book when introducing Gurdjieff’sexposition of the law of octaves, these “glitches” are identified as the twopoints in the octave where the rate of increase in pitch frequency between onenote and the next retards, that is where there are not full tones but onlyhalf-tones: between the notes mi–fa and ti–Do. This inherent deviation in theline of development of an octave in ordinary, practical music is the underlyingpattern of development of all natural phenomena, and accounts for the vastmultiplicity and variety of physical forms in the universe. Thus, while themusic of our favorite composers and artists sounds perfect to our ears, thePythagorean Comma indicates that it is never quite so.“Ideal” music, however, the esoteric music of the Greeks, is organic music, themusic of the Hermetic Code and the genetic code. This very special kind of musicactually takes account of, and rectifies, the discrepancy highlighted by theComma. Essentially, of course, this is the “music of the mind,” the music fromwhich life itself is created. It is Egyptian alchemy, which involved theapplication of the law of octaves as a mode of being, but with a very slight yetcrucial additional input in each developing scale at precisely the two semitonepoints mentioned above. This means that a fully developed “psychological” ororganic octave is composed not of seven stages, as in a normal scale, but ofnine, because it includes within it the two extra impulses at the points of themissing semitones. If we remember that each of these nine stages, according tothe second fundamental law of nature, is itself an octave, then quite clearly wehave a genuinely perfect scale consisting of sixty-four “inner notes” (9 x 7 +1, the 1 being the final Do).Readers wishing to explore in greater depth the theory of the “missingsemitones” may care to consult the relevant section of my previous book,5[26_note.html#fo85] but for the present we must return to the main cosmologicaltheme of this chapter.Temple goes on to reveal that the precise value of 1.053, which we have notedhas only very recently been identified as the exact ratio of the masses ofSirius B and our own sun, was very accurately expressed by theastronomer/mathematician Macrobius in the fifth century CE in the form of the“sacred” fraction, 256/243. Macrobius claimed that this fraction, which was alsoreferred to by several of his contemporaries, was used in harmonic theory bypeople who he himself referred to as the ancients.Temple suggests that this apparent harmonic connection between Sirius B and thesun—stars that, on a universal scale, are virtually neighbors—might in fact beimplicit throughout the universe, at least between localized white dwarf starsand ordinary stars like the sun. The wider implication is that all types ofstars could have relative masses corresponding in some way to the establishedratios of harmonic theory, that is, with the ratios embodied within the HermeticCode.One possible way of explaining this long-range coordination, says Temple, is toregard the two solar systems as inhabiting the same “cell” of space. This ideahas emerged from a new area of research known as Complexity Theory, whichinvolves the study of the sudden appearance and disappearance of order in thegreater cosmos. It has been noted that something that looks very much likeinstantaneous communication occurs in such “cells,” “whereby huge macro-regionsof space behave as if their elements were not separated by spatial or temporaldistance, and the ‘cell’ engages in what is called ‘self-organisation.’”6[26_note.html#fo86]We have already identified what appears to be a microworld equivalent of thiskind of process in plasmas, where billions of electrons simultaneously performcoordinated movements, exactly as if they were all communicating non-locally.Another example cited by Temple is the Bénard cell, a thermal phenomenon causedby convection in a fluid, in which millions of individual moleculesinstantaneously align. He also notes that there are other similar phenomena innature, such as the simple sponge, which can transmit stimuli from one end ofits body to the other at apparently “impossible” velocities, as if the wholecreature were a single giant cell or neuron. This is not dissimilar to theproposition made by Roger Penrose, the Cambridge scientist mentioned in chapter4 [12_chapter04.html], who suggested that “non-local quantum correlations” mightoccur between widely separated regions of the brain, thus enabling billions ofindividual neurons to respond as a coherent whole—a microcosmic equivalent ofthe Greek concept of homonoia, a “union of minds,” or, in this case, of neurons.Obviously the principle of nonlocality is hard for us to understand. It defiesordinary logic and excludes the time and space familiar to our ordinary senses.But while the nonlocal realm—what I have called the plane of light—might bedifficult to conceptualize, there is a sense in which music itself can providean explanation for the kind of simultaneous coordinated action we have beenconsidering here.This centers around the eighth and last note of an octave, Do, which, oncestruck, simultaneously becomes the first note of a higher octave, a greaterscale. Such a note has dual properties, existing in two different scales at oneand the same time. So let’s say that the whole range of biochemical vibrationsproduced by neurons in the brain or in a sponge develop inwardly as an octave,and that ultimately this octave begins to vibrate, to resonate, at its optimumpotential. When this occurs, the entire evolutionary scale becomes fused intoone final note, Do. In this way all separate components of the scale not onlybecome simultaneously interconnected with all other components, no matter whattheir “position” in the scale, they also become simultaneously connected,through the ultimate note, with the next scale or dimension above.In the same way the RNA codon template, created by DNA from three inert chemicalbases, or three harmonious “octaves” of chemical resonance, simultaneouslybecomes a single new biochemical “note”— an amino acid—one of twenty-twocomprising the greater scale above. Thus, although the process is essentiallylinear, taking place in time, there comes a point where a kind of simultaneitydefinitely does occur, where lower scales are suddenly transcended, and wheretime and space count for nothing. The same could apply, of course, to the higherscales of biochemical evolution, perhaps when the amino-acid chain transmutes“up” into the scale of the protein macromolecule, or when the protein evolves upfurther into the scale of organs, or of glands, bone, tissue, and so on. In allof these transitional stages of evolution there must be points where the notesin one scale all combine to strike simultaneously a single new note up into agreater scale. Therefore, these “nonlocal correlations,” in addition to being ageneral property of nature at the quantum level of existence, probably manifestat many different levels on the evolutionary ladder.As Temple says, if a simple sponge can defy space and time at the bottom of thesea, then it is not unreasonable to suppose that these greater “cells” above cando so within the galaxy.Inevitably, perhaps, Temple is ultimately drawn to consider the possibility thatsuch macrocosmic cells, which he calls Anubis cells (Anubis being thejackal-headed deity of the Egyptian pantheon associated with the “dog star”Sirius), may be alive. “The vast Ordering Principle,” he says, “may be anEntity.”7 [26_note.html#fo87]Quite so. Hermetic is genetic, and the musical symmetries evident in theplanetary sphere of our solar system, and in the mass ratio of Sirius B and oursun, indicate that this life force may be prevalent throughout the entireuniverse. Remember also that the basic structure of all life-bearing phenomenais the spiral, the helix—and the entire cosmos, as we have seen, is positivelyteeming with these “serpents in the sky.”Our own solar system is comprised of nine such serpents, all coiled around thepath of the sun, while the motion of the sun itself traces an infinitely greaterhelix winding around the central path of the galactic center.The most distinctive of the nine “lesser serpents” described above is, ofcourse, serpent Earth, from which has developed the evolving “solar mind” of thehuman race. Of course, if this greater helix is a cosmic “chromosome” developingin an organic fashion deep inside some kind of cell nucleus, then logically onewould expect to find the greater body of the host cell all around it. In thiscase, the most obvious structure in evidence is that of the solar system itself.Interestingly enough, when we look at the solar system in relation to thegreater body of the Milky Way, its position appears strikingly similar to thatof certain ordinary living cells. We could compare it, for example, to theposition of a single blood cell in the human body. Like the solar system, awhite corpuscle is structured around a central nucleus, or “sun.” Floatingaround the nucleus are smaller components of varying size, complexity, andenergy content, such as enzymes, mitochondria, ribosomes, RNA, and so on. Thesecomponents all exist inside the body of the cell, floating around in a waterymedium, a liquid membrane known as the cytoplasm. Beyond the walls of theindividual blood cell and separating it from all others is more fluid membrane.The boundary of the cosmic “cytoplasm” of the solar system might be defined asthe sphere of the sun’s immediate magnetic and gravitational influence, thesphere in which all the planets, asteroids, comets, and other orbiting materialsare contained. The “cytoplasm,” however, or the medium in which the componentsof the solar system exist and operate, would be infinitely more rarefied thanthe liquid membrane of the cell, or even the air we breathe on Earth, but itmust be just as real nonetheless and it similarly must fill the whole system.Possibly this medium is light itself or, rather, the entire spectrum ofelectromagnetic radiation, which extends far beyond the boundaries of the solarsystem and is the medium in which all greater cosmic systems exist.The spiral galaxy, consisting of billions of these “solar cells,” is composedmainly of hydrogen-burning stars, vast, interstellar clouds of cosmic dust, ornebulae, and, one assumes, billions upon billions of planets, all whirlingaround a central nucleus of super-dense energy—a black hole, perhaps. And thisgreat cosmic firework, with its immense spiral arms, as well as spinning aroundits central axis, is also hurtling through space at a velocity of around sixhundred kilometers per second. Therefore, as with the solar helices, if we wishto perceive something of the galaxy’s true form, we must try to visualize it notin the timescale involved in taking a frozen snapshot of it, a few seconds or aminute or so, but in that of the galactic being itself. In such a scale, a few“seconds” might be equivalent to hundreds of thousands or even millions of ouryears. So, if the four-dimensional structure of the galaxy could somehow becaptured by time-lapse photography, after a few of its “seconds” or “minutes” wewould see something very similar to the long body of the solar system describedby Rodney Collin, an immensely elongated, shimmering spiral of electromagneticradiation coiling toward infinity—another true helix.This image of a long helical body really only describes the basic physical orfour-dimensional form of one of these macrocosmic “chromosomes.” But, like theDNA strand in a cell nucleus, the brain housed in a skull, or the creative solarmind of the human race, its overall complexity and influence would far exceedthe scale of its origin. In fact, what we see when we look at the contents ofthe nucleus of a cell, a cerebral cortex or a solar system is merely asimplified cross-section of the whole entity.For example, we look at a DNA strand and see only a relatively simple chain ofchemically encoded digital instructions. Yet scientific investigation has shownus another, much more powerful dimension to DNA: it reaches out and indeedcontrols all of the creative functions in every part of the greater “world” inwhich it exists, that is, in the entire body of the host organism. Thus a singlegene located in the chromosome of the first reproductive cells of an evolvingorganism may ultimately determine such features as the color of hair or eyes,the configuration of bone structure, and other complex characteristics.Similarly the human brain can be scientifically reduced to its simplest form bydescribing it as a mass of neurons interacting through chemical reactions andelectrical impulses, all comfortably housed in a protective covering of hardbone. But quite clearly the skull itself does not even remotely define the realboundaries of the brain’s existence. The brain, like the chromosome, is merelythe physical manifestation of a much greater, profoundly more complex entity,one capable of thinking conceptually or of dreaming up imaginary worlds, that oftraveling backward in time through memory or alternatively speculating its wayinto the future. It can transmit information to other brains, it can intuit,impress, inspire, it can even, many believe, communicate telepathically,directly influence physical objects, predict coming events, and so on. Ineffect, like the DNA double helix, the brain is potentially as big as the“world” in which it functions.The solar helix, or the collective mind of humanity, would clearly be of anorder of consciousness far more advanced than any we could imagine. The“organism” in which this helix is housed would be composed of the entire body ofmankind’s accumulated wisdom, every idea, theory, or belief system that has everbeen conceived, or ever will be. Trying to understand the true nature of such abeing, whose life span would be measured in hundreds of thousands of our years,would involve studying, in the minutest detail, every intellectual and spiritualdiscipline known or yet to be developed. Like the two orders of helices belowit—the human brain and DNA—we would expect the solar helix to exert creativeinfluences reaching way beyond its own scale of existence, out into the greaterbody of the host galaxy.In the same way we see the greater galactic helix as composed of symmetrical,localized concentrations of matter and energy traveling through a given regionin space, but its greater presence, or the totality of vibrations issuing fromit, spreads far and wide. We know the galaxy is formed like it is because thereare four fundamental forces (“bases”) keeping it together: the short-rangestrong and short-range weak nuclear forces, the gravitational force, and theelectromagnetic force. The electromagnetic radiation emitted by all the stars ofa galaxy spreads out at the speed of light in all directions, extending overdistances of billions of light years from the source of origin. Therefore, theouter limits of all the light that has ever been emitted from the galactichelix, together with the outer limits of the gravitational influence it hasexerted from the time of its formation, represent the greater body of the galaxyitself. Thus, as with the DNA double helix, the human brain, and the solarhelix, we can say that the potential influence of the galactic “mind” would alsobe as immense and complex as the “world” in which it exists.Scientists will argue that a galaxy cannot conceivably possess any kind ofconsciousness, that it is simply an involving, runaway mass of chemical elementsrandomly exploding and flying off in all directions according to basic physicallaws. But then, the often-violent electrochemical reactions taking place insidean active human brain could also be described in much the same way—and yet weknow that consciousness dwells there. Similarly the superactive speed-of-lightfusion of electropositive elements combining, through photon interchange, withelectronegative elements in the atomic chemistry of dynamic, evolvingbiomolecules would also give the appearance, to a microcosmic onlooker, of beinga purely physical, entropic process. But we know that this entropy observed inthe genetic microworld is basically an illusion, for from it evolve immense,harmoniously proportioned, and long-living organic structures.In the case of the solar being, whose extraterrestrial body, remember, isconstructed from the metaphysical “gene pool” of mankind’s collectiveconsciousness, disorder seems, at least on the surface of things, to be endemic.Go into any large town or city on a normal day and observe the inhabitants goingabout their business, rushing, pushing, shouting, hustling, absent-mindedlymoving around in random directions, each of them in a private world of theirown, with hardly ever a thought for the planet we live on, or the solar systemwithin which it rotates, or the galaxy on high. No homonoia here. Elsewhere menare warring with and killing one another in a hundred different regions of theworld, famines are ravaging millions of helpless and innocent victims withmerciless regularity, global ecological disasters are occurring almost daily.All this evident confusion is “cacophony,” a general manifestation of the socialanimal at its worst, with consciousness locked in a materialistic, dualisticstupor. No homonoia here either.And yet beneath all this apparently chaotic activity there is, in fact, anunderlying current of metaphysical harmony that has been continuously flowingthroughout recorded history in the form of hermetic ideas. Fortunately for us,and presumably also for the Helix above, these concepts, being psychologicallysound, are infinitely more “resonant” than the crass “isms” that man is prone topreach. This is precisely why, just like successful genes in the evolutionaryprocesses of the microworld, they are so faithfully replicated and passed on forfuture generations by millions of other human minds.This solar being, whose metaphysical “body” we have just described, is but oneof around one hundred billion in our galaxy alone. If we assume that thesebeings possess “minds” with a degree of consciousness of some macrocosmic order,then presumably their “thoughts” or “concepts” would also have substance to themand would in turn be synthesized at a higher level in the construction of aninfinitely greater galactic body. The real nature of such godly thoughtprocesses lie beyond our ordinary comprehension, but the manner in which theyevolve must in principle be identical to the evolution of the helices below—theDNA molecule and the human brain. Therefore, the “concepts” or evolutionarysignals engendered by the solar being above us, assuming they are of an“immaculate” order, would simultaneously be passed on, or transmitted, to othersolar beings in the galaxy. So, like the dominant or active genes of DNA, or thehermetic ideas of creative mankind, the more successful of the “ideas” conceivedin the solar helix will be replicated by other conscious beings in its “world.”This will construct the body of an even greater organism—the galactic being.But what about the mind of this greater entity? Where is it? How does itoperate?As I said earlier, the body of the galaxy is composed of billions of individualsolar systems, or solar “cells,” but its mind, evolving transcendentally out ofthe collective consciousness of all the solar beings in a given galaxy, isidentifiable in the overall four-dimensional helical structure of the galaxyitself—the galactic “chromosome.”The order of consciousness of the solar being, as we have seen, is complexenough in itself, but it can, nevertheless, be explained in fairly rationalterms, that is, as a composite structure formed from the entire body ofhumanity’s collective consciousness, its accumulated secular and esotericwisdom. But when considering the kind of “consciousness” our own Milky Way mightpossess, which clearly would exist and operate in a scale of being unimaginablygreater than the solar scale, we are touching on possible processes so refinedand ultra-resonant that they must remain for us hypothetical in our presentstate of evolution. This does not, however, prevent us from speculating on thenature of these projected “galactic vibrations.”Possibly the most distinctive features of these galactic vibrations would betheir relative pitch frequencies and their rate of transmission. These highercreative processes would operate with degrees of resonance far more rarefiedthan those emanating from the helices below.When we considered the solar helix, we identified its two principal propertiesor components as the active emanations of the sun (light) and the passive,metaphysical vibrations of the Earth (consciousness). These, I suggested, were“light” and “consciousness” of a different order from the light andconsciousness of our ordinary world. Significantly the nature of the morerarefied light of the solar helix is described by the Hermetic Code and by theMagic Square associated with the Great Pyramid—“The Lights”—as a squaredphenomenon, the square of the constant. Such, therefore, would be the nature ofthe “light” of the solar helix. The nature of the more rarefied consciousness ofthe entire human race would therefore have to correspond accordingly, and wouldpresumably be as far removed from ordinary consciousness as the speed of lightis from the square of the speed of light.The galactic helix, however, whose scale of being is at least one hundredbillion times more extensive that that of the single solar helix, would probablybe engaged in an exchange of energies moving, or vibrating, at frequencies farin excess of the square of the speed of light. As we know, Special Relativityasserts that nothing can travel through space faster than the constant velocity.But of course we have seen from the nonlocal connections existing betweeninteracting quanta that information can “travel” instantaneously from one toanother— through the quantum field, where space and time simply don’t exist.Possibly this is how these great galactic beings, whose sheer magnitude makeeven the square of the speed of light seem hopelessly inadequate as a universalrate of intelligence transmission, might “speak” with one another.We are now poised to make a final ascent to the very summit of Jacob’sevolutionary “ladder,” beyond the scale of the “angels” (suns) and the scale ofthe “archangels” (galaxies), and out into the realms of the Absolute scale—theuniverse in its entirety. In this scale, the mighty galaxy, whosethree-dimensional form is measured in tens of billions of light years across, isbut a single cell in the body of its host. And just like all cells, the cells ofplanetary organisms, the cells of the solar body (you and me), and the cells ofthe galactic body (like our solar system), this greater galactic mind mustultimately have the ability to create, in the greatest scale of them all, theultimate, universal being.Before we continue our journey across the universe, it is worth reflecting for amoment on the overall evolutionary picture we have just been describing. This isa picture, remember, that was first outlined by Egyptian metaphysicians in thethird millennium BCE and that was neatly summed up in the phrase “As above, sobelow.” Now you may or may not accept this scenario of ascending, living scalesas the real thing, but whether this view is literally true or not, it isnevertheless unique in the entire history of philosophical thought in that itprovides a very plausible answer to two of the most fundamental and puzzlingquestions of all, questions that, as I explained in the introduction of thisbook, were the cause of much consternation to me as a boy: why are we here? Isthere life after death? The theory of transcendental evolution pulls no puncheshere: it answers these two questions in a quite straightforward and unambiguousway.According to this original creation theory, we are here as a direct result ofnature’s grand design, all of us being—potentially at least— vital and integralparts of a much greater evolutionary process. This process begins in the“primordial waters” (with the DNA–RNA complex), it then evolves up through theconsciousness of sentient beings like ourselves, then further still into“angelic” (solar) and “archangelic” (galactic) form, ultimately to flower intothe superconscious “mind” of the universe itself—the ultimate “helix.” We are acrucial link in the chain.On the second question—of life after death—hermetic theory is equally emphatic.Of course there is life after death, for death itself, the final note, Do, atthe top of one’s own personal scale of evolution, is also the first note of thegreater scale above. By this account, not only is there life after death, but,compared to the ordinary timescale of the modern hominid, it would be, as theancients have always said, a “life everlasting.”The implication of this upward evolutionary motion is that the universe seemsdestined to become fully conscious of itself. But then perhaps it is already; itis certainly old enough to have come of age by now. Maybe this is why photonsare so acutely aware of happenings in the greater quantum field, or why billionsof electrons in plasmas and metals can act as if they already know what billionsof other electrons are about to do. It’s as if there is a general “awareness,”even at the most basic level of material existence.Sri Aurobindo said that the universe was wholly conscious and that if just onepoint in it were not so, the whole fabric would break down into a lifeless void.He was merely echoing the Greeks, of course, but the message remains the same,which is that the universe is, in fact, already conscious of itself, and that itis merely waiting for us to realize this and contribute toward its maintenance.Perhaps this is why the God of the ancients was said to be so concerned for ourwell-being. We are his life-blood."},{"pageContent":"9The Hermetic Universe of Ancient TimesBy now readers might appreciate how important and significant are theevolutionary ideas of the ancients, and in particular the musical revelations ofthe Pythagoreans. We know, however, that Pythagoras, like all other greatspiritual leaders, was merely passing on knowledge that came originally from thepriest-astronomers of ancient Egypt. Possibly the Egyptians also inherited themain tenets of this wisdom from the fabled flood survivors of ancient myth, whothemselves could possibly have received instruction from an even earlier race.This continuous evolutionary line appears to have originated in the beliefsystem of the “primitive” Neanderthal, who regarded the number 7, thefundamental symbol of the octave, as sacred. The seven bear skulls found in thestone altar at the Neanderthal site at Drachenloch in Switzerland indicate thatthis sacred number symbolism dates back at least 75,000 years.With the Greeks, however, came a much more overt, logical description of thetheory of transcendental evolution, which the Pythagoreans neatly summed up inthe two key esoteric symbols already discussed, namely the classical formula pi,22/7, and the original “philosopher’s stone,” the Tetrad, illustrated by placingten pebbles on the ground in the shape of a 4–3–2–1 triangle.The Tetrad was called by the Pythagoreans the “model of the gods” and the“source of nature.” It was thus regarded as the blueprint for the development ofall evolutionary phenomena, above and below: the 4–3– 2–1 format of the symbolis in fact a remarkably accurate blueprint of the processes involved at thebiomolecular level, for it describes perfectly the sequences of geneticprocesses involved in the synthesis of amino acids.The formula pi is also an expression of the same evolutionary process. So thefour-base/tripleoctave symmetry embodied in the classical convention, 22/7,which can be expressed diagrammatically like this:[images/8.jpg]denotes the first two levels of the Tetrad:[images/9.jpg]The two higher stages in its evolutionary development, marked by the two pebblesat the third level and the single one at the apex, are a combined expression ofthe greater “trinity” above.When this model is applied to the higher evolution of the individual, thecombined four-and three-pebble stages, with their four-base/tripleoctavesymmetry, represent the fundamental qualities of all human beings—walkingtrinities with the capacity to sense, emote, and perceive. By and large, we canall do these things to greater or lesser degrees; they are perfectly naturalhuman functions. The next two stages in the Tetrad, however—the third, denotedby the two pebbles, and the fourth, with its single pebble at the apex—stand forhigher human functions that unfortunately are not universal. This is where whatwe might call “original thought” comes into play, which is the harmoniousproduct of a balanced combination of our sensations, emotions, and perceptions.This spark of real consciousness is denoted by the first of the two pebbles atthe third stage of our evolutionary Tetrad. The second pebble represents theother side of this metaphysical coin: light itself. The topmost pebble thereforesymbolizes the final, transcendental note of this whole musical process.Generally referred to nowadays as a “concept,” this signal, harmonious andtherefore transcendental, then continues to exist as a single new note in thegreater scale above. We see from the genetic code that the “greater scale,” thescale up from the base scale of the four chemical bases, consists of preciselytwenty-two higher notes—twenty amino-acid signals and the two signals coding for“start” and “stop”—a triple octave. It follows, therefore, that the greaterscale into which the conscious mind can input is also structured as a “tripleoctave,” a “trinity” above.We can now try to apply the process described by the Tetrad to the greatercosmic scales outlined in the last two chapters. If solar beings and galacticbeings are for real, they should fit easily into an overall hermetic picture ofuniversal events.As we have noted, the Greeks believed that all cosmological entities like theplanets and the stars were conscious beings, and that the universe itself was aliving animal—a zoon—and therefore completely organic in nature. We have seenhow such an organism might develop, through an ascending hierarchy of scales,from biomolecules to galaxies. Remembering that there are exactly four of thesefundamental scales, we can envisage the whole universe as being a vast,cosmological representation of the Hermetic Code itself, a multidimensionalTetrad:[images/10.jpg]One of the most significant features of this diagram is that the four orders ofintelligence depicted, from DNA to the galactic helix, are each represented bythe note Do. That is, they are all manifestations of the very same note; onlythe scale is different. This, of course, is precisely what is being alluded toin that all-embracing dictum of Thoth, “As above, so below,” which tells us thatthe symmetries of the processes of creation are the same at every level ofexistence, above us, below us, and in between, of course, in our minds.So these four basic orders of intelligence or life all resonate at compatiblefrequencies, with each successive note, Do, vibrating, according to musicaltheory, at exactly twice the pitch and frequency of the preceding one. Anoctave, remember, is a measure of the doubling of the rate of vibrations in agiven scale. This indicates that there are unique, tangible connections betweenthe four “base notes,” the vibrations of each being whole-number coordinates ofthe greater evolutionary scale.Theoretically the super-resonant galactic helix, representing the ultimate note,Do, of the third and final evolutionary octave, would ultimately have the powerto strike a single new note up onto the greatest scale of them all: theuniversal scale. What happens beyond that is anybody’s guess. I have foundmyself trying to envisage here a dynamic, cyclic scenario, whereby a givenproportion of the energies created by the galactic helix reenters, possiblythrough the quantum field, the primary DNA scale. After all, some thing, somekind of force or intelligence, is ensuring that the universe manifests andevolves strictly according to the laws described by the Hermetic Code, and themost obvious choice as to the possible source of this intelligence surely mustbe the ultimate product of the whole evolutionary process. Remember that thegalactic helix, the fourth and last base note of our universal triple octave, isin fact reinforcing, at a higher pitch and frequency, the first base note of theentire scale, represented by DNA. But DNA is not simply a note. It is also anentire scale, and the first “note” of this primary DNA scale would have to beone of the base notes of the genetic code, one of the four inert chemical bases.Conceivably therefore, it could be at this stage, on the level of the simpleinorganic molecule, that the creative vibrations of the galaxy above reenter,through the quantum field, the endless cycle of life. Thus the chemical basemight seem inert from a scientific perspective, but in reality it may havealready been imbued by the powers above with some sort of rudimentary, radarlikeintelligence, providing it with at least enough awareness to be in the rightplace—the living cell—at exactly the right time.REINCARNATIONAs an interesting aside, it is worth pointing out that the process of evolutiondescribed above hints at a possible explanation for the emergence of theBuddhist and Hindu beliefs about reincarnation, which is also a cyclicdescription of evolution.The Pythagorean concept of metempsychosis, or the “transmigration of souls,”expresses much the same idea. Pythagoras regarded the soul as a fallen angellocked within a body and condemned to a cycle of rebirths until it has riditself of all impurities. The cycle being described, from birth to death tobirth again and so on, could be regarded as being, in a sense, circular, wherethe evolving entity keeps returning back to the point of departure, or to themoment of its conception. But then, if the soul were improving its lot at eachturn, this would imply a slight “upward” movement after each cycle, one lifetimebeing superimposed on top of the next in ever-ascending circles. This issignificant, for, if we were to draw an imaginary line tracing the path of thisrecurring entity as it gradually evolved, the overall figure so described wouldtake the form of the most fundamental configuration of all evolutionaryprocesses—a helix.Unfortunately this question of recurring lifetimes represents something of adeparture from the main thrust of this study. A detailed investigation wouldrequire a great deal more time and space than I currently have. Possibly sometime in the future we might be able to investigate this subject in more detail,but for the moment we shall continue our search for evidence in support of theancients’ view of a living cosmos.THE CONCEPTION OF THE UNIVERSEThe Greeks’ definition of the universe—a zoon—is wholly unambiguous. Theyregarded the whole cosmos as the biological product of a fertilized ovum, aliving, organic creature conceived through some form of procreative activity. Bywhom or in what is clearly the most profound mystery of all.Whatever its genealogy, however, most origin myths agree that the presentuniverse was created, or rather conceived. Take the example most familiar toChristians: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”1[26_note.html#fo91]In Genesis, the creation or conception of the universe is described as havingtaken place in a watery medium, which in ancient scriptures always has afeminine or passive connotation: “And the spirit of God moved upon the face ofthe waters.”2 [26_note.html#fo92]Then comes the moment of conception, the initial act of (pro)creation: “And Godsaid, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light. . . . And God divided the lightfrom the darkness.”3 [26_note.html#fo93]So the primordial cosmic “ovum” divided into two complementary yet quitedistinct proto-cells, one light, one dark, or one active, one passive.In a similar vein, the Vedic version of universal origins asserts that God“first with a thought created the waters, and placed his seed in them.”4[26_note.html#fo94] This again suggests that the origin of the universe wasprimarily a natural biological event.In Vedic literature there are hymns dedicated to the god of the primeval waters.This is Indra, the god of rain, who is said to have released the waters to flowinto the cosmic ocean and to have revealed the creative light of the godAgni—the sun.To the early Greeks too, water was considered a primary element of creation. Thephilosopher Thales, for example, believed that the Earth floated on water, whichwas the medium from which all life evolved. Much the same view was held by thePythagoreans, who thought that sunlight penetrated the primeval slime of theEarth to generate life.Of all known origin myths, the Egyptian account is possibly the oldest. Thuseach of the above examples is merely a reprise of the original theme, first setout by the priests of Hermopolis, the spiritual seat of Thoth. Hermopolitan mythspeaks of eight principal gods who appeared simultaneously on the “Island ofFlame,” which rose like a hill from the eternal waters.As we can see, virtually all of these creation myths agree on two fundamentalpoints: first, that before the universe/world/life came into existence, therewere only endless or eternal waters—the passive, negative element—and second,that the creative act itself involved the introduction of light, or a flame—theactive, positive element. Very often this fusion of forces is described ashaving occurred through the intervention of a god or gods—the universalmediating principle. Excluding this latter allusion to “divine intervention,” weare left with a description of the universe’s creation that in fact bearsstriking similarities to that currently on offer from modern science.THE SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVEPossibly many readers will already be familiar with the “big bang” theory of theorigin of the universe, a proposition first put forward by the Belgianpriest-astronomer Georges Henri Lemaitre in the 1920s. This is now generallyaccepted as the most likely explanation of how matter, space, and time came intobeing. A persistent background microwave radiation spreading out evenly acrossthe entire cosmos and with a temperature of around 3.5 Kelvin (3.5 degrees aboveabsolute zero) was recorded by the radio-astronomers Robert Wilson and ArnoPenzias at Bell Laboratories in 1964. Most scientists now agree that thisradiation is very probably the residual vibration of the creation of theuniverse, of the biggest bang in history.But what exactly was it that originally went bang? Lemaitre suggested that theuniverse had been born from a single primeval quantum of potential energy, akind of superdense mother of all atoms. After the initial cataclysmic explosion,this primordial “atom” began dividing so rapidly and energetically that iteventually gave rise to all the matter in the universe. As the first atomicnuclei (protons and neutrons composed of quarks) proliferated, with quantumduplication taking place at a phenomenal rate, space and time simultaneouslyunfolded to accommodate them. This means that before the primordial quantumsplit asunder and the resultant superhigh energies began to radiate out from the“epicenter,” there was no space, no time, nothing except the original quantumitself.Lemaitre realized that quantum theory supported this idea of space and timeappearing after the big bang. As we saw earlier, in quantum mechanicalcalculations, space and time are statistically meaningless in respect toindividual events involving subatomic quanta. Therefore, if the universe didoriginate from a single, self-duplicating quantum, space and time would not haveexisted at that point; they would not have appeared until the primordial “atom”had duplicated in sufficient quantities to produce a significant number ofmeasurable quanta.According to big-bang theorists, the universe was in thermal equilibrium duringits earliest development and was filled with the most intense light travelingout in all directions (“And God said, ‘Let there be light’”). The temperaturesinvolved at this stage would have been in the trillions of degrees. The originalwavelength of these first generations of photons would have been very short, butas space expanded it stretched out the wavelength of the light, so producing aone-way shift to lower and lower temperatures—white light shifting to blue, blueto red, and so on. The present cool state of the universe, barely 4 degreesCelsius above absolute zero, is the end result of this fifteen-billion-year-longfireworks display.Within half a billion or so years after the primordial conception the force ofgravity caused pockets of high-density dust clouds and atomic nuclei to condenseinto galaxy formations. We can still observe such a process at work in thecreation of proto-stars (“baby” stars) forming as dense clouds of cosmic dustcollapse inward, such as is currently being observed in the Large MagellanicCloud system, a member of our own immediate cluster of local galaxies.Individual stars within these galaxies are all born as protostars. As theydevelop through high-energy nucleon collision caused by gravitational collapse,these baby stars rapidly approach maturity and ultimately “ignite,” convertinghydrogen to helium at a phenomenal rate. At this stage they are classed asmature, “main sequence” stars—like our own sun in its present state. Mainsequence stars, after billions of years of relatively constant, active life,eventually metamorphose into old-timers—red giants. Red giants then eitherdegenerate gradually to become static white or brown dwarfs, or they reach acritical energy level and explode as supernovae. A supernova is a star that hasbecome pregnant with a vast store of nuclear energy and ultimately explodes,projecting massive quantities of radiation and heavier chemical elements backout into the cosmos, where it is then recycled. It’s an interesting reflectionthat every single atom of which you and I are composed came from explodingsupernovae out there in deepest space.Until very recently it was thought that any region of space was much the same asany other—that galaxies developed relatively undisturbed by other concentrationsof mass. This view of a uniform distribution of galaxies was initially supportedby data obtained from high-altitude flight experiments using redeployed U2spy-planes. These experiments, coordinated by the American astrophysicist GeorgeSmoot in 1995–96, appeared at first to show that the universe is expandinguniformly and with a constant speed in all directions. However, more accurateexperimental procedures later revealed that this was not so and that in factgalaxy densities are not strictly homogeneous and that there are huge clustersof galaxies gathering in some regions and vast expanses of empty space inothers.Our own galaxy is a member of a relatively small local cluster, all hurtlingthrough space at a velocity of around six hundred kilometers per second. Currenttheory holds that the extraordinarily rapid motion of these massive bodies iscaused by the gravitational pull of a very large concentration of mass situateda great distance away. This “Great Attractor,” as it is called, is thought to beanother, incredibly vast cluster of galaxies, a kind of supercluster situatedmillions of light years distant. These greater galactic “cluster cells,” varyingso dramatically in size and luminosity, indicate that the expanding universe isfar from symmetrical, that its “body,” like yours, is lumpy and uneven and muchmore structured than had previously been thought.Astrophysicists have now discovered the “seeds” of these structuralcharacteristics in slight fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation, whichsuggests that they must already have been present in the fabric of the universeas little as 300,000 years after the big bang. These early seeds were theprimordial imprints of creation, “cosmic genes” in which were encoded all thecharacteristics of the universe as it exists today.Science currently recognizes four fundamental forces in the universe: the weakand strong nuclear forces, the electromagnetic force, and the gravitationalforce. An instant after the big bang, however, there was only one unified force:matter was indistinguishable from energy, and the first rudimentary quanta—thequarks—had not yet been formed. These high-energy conditions at the verybeginning of time are now the focus of much attention. Scientists believe that afuller understanding of the nature of universal origins will come through arational convergence on the first moments after this unique moment of“conception,” when only one unified force existed and where the laws and thecomponents of the universe were much simpler than they are today.In his book Wrinkles in Time, George Smoot uses an interesting analogy todescribe the nature of his work. He compares the quest to understand the originof the universe by converging on the moment of creation to that of tracing theevolutionary development of the human being back to his or her origins. Thehuman being is an immensely complex entity with definite and uniquephysiological, emotional, and psychological characteristics. But if we tracesuch an entity back through its life toward the moment of its conception, itappears progressively simpler in structure, until ultimately we find a uniformset of relatively simple digital instructions encoded within the chromosomes.Smoot is obviously using this comparison between the universe and the individualonly as an analogy, but, like so many cosmologists and astrophysicists today, heseems particularly fond of biological metaphors. For example, he says that “theuniverse appears to be as it is because it must be that way; its evolution waswritten in its beginnings—in its cosmic DNA, if you will.”5 [26_note.html#fo95]He also talks of “quantum self-replication” taking place at an explosive ratevery soon after the primordial event, much the same as individual cellsself-replicate at an “explosive” rate as a living organism rapidly “expands”after conception.Another example of the use of “bio-cosmic” metaphor is given by Professor PaulDavies in his book The Last Three Minutes, in which he discusses a propositionmade by a group of Japanese physicists working on the idea of “false” and “true”vacuums. A false vacuum is an excited vacuum, a region of so-called empty spacein which a great deal of quantum activity (particle interaction) is stillpresent. The natural tendency of a false vacuum is to decay to its lowestpossible energy state—a true vacuum. The Japanese postulated an alternativeprocess based on a simple mathematical model, where a small bubble of falsevacuum surrounded by a true vacuum would inflate and subsequently expand into alarger universe in a big bang. Davies uses the analogy of a rubber sheet(representing the true vacuum of an existing universe) blistering up in a givenplace and ballooning out to form a “baby universe,” connected to the originaluniverse by a “wormhole,” the opening of which would appear to an observer inthe mother universe as a black hole. The black hole then evaporates and finallydisappears, pinching off the “umbilical cord”—the wormhole—leaving the babyuniverse, a high-energy false vacuum, to grow and develop independently.Here again we have a scientist using what appears in recent times to have becomethe accepted idiom for describing cosmological processes—the biologicalmetaphor. Popular books on cosmology and astrophysics now abound with suchterms, and one begins to wonder whether this is simply a fashionable trend, oris it, perhaps, some deeper influence affecting the development of humanconsciousness.We touched earlier upon the possible nature of this influence, when I proposedthat human ideas or inventions could be regarded as the metaphysical equivalentof the amino acid, or perhaps a chain of amino acids. A string of related ideas,which together make up what we would call a full-blown concept (such as theHermetic Code, for example), we might call a metaphysical “gene,” or perhaps achain of genes. Now genes can be either “dominant” or “recessive,” active orpassive. They can lie dormant in the human genome for generations and they canreemerge once more as dominant genes anytime conditions become favorable.Perhaps this is what is happening now in respect of the Hermetic Code. It issurfacing once again, and while science has been systematically proving theexistence of hermetic symmetries at all levels of material and biologicalcreation, simultaneously there has been a great upsurge in awareness of theremarkable achievements and beliefs of our remote ancestors. Remember, theHermetic Code has been the dominant feature of human consciousness many timesbefore, in the time of Muhammad, for example, and of Jesus, Zoroaster,Pythagoras, Buddha, Confucius, Moses—the list goes on and on, back into themists of time. It is entirely possible, therefore, that we are currentlywitnessing—participating in, even—the beginnings of yet another renaissance inthe development of human consciousness, the emergence of a new, “modern” versionof the oldest creed on Earth, one that naturally requires us, either consciouslyor unconsciously, to reinvent the hermetic universe.Arguably the best example of the recycled concept currently on offer is thetheory of universal origins proposed by the physicist Lee Smolin. Smolin hassuggested that there may be a kind of Darwinian natural selection taking placeamong universes and that the emergence of organic life and conscious beings is aby-product of this process. In other words, he is proposing that the universe isa zoon.Clearly this “natural” conclusion is just about as close to the process I amtrying to envisage as it is possible to come, for not only does it agree withthe known scientific facts concerning the origin of the universe, it alsohappens to fit all the criteria of the hermetic view of creation.We earlier noted Smoot’s discovery that galaxies, like stars, are grouped inclusters—cluster cells—and even superclusters. This gives a universal structureand pattern of development very reminiscent of the way living cells gathertogether in clusters to create a variety of organs, bone, muscle, nerve tissue,skin, and so forth. So perhaps the Great Attractor, the immense superclustertoward which our local group is surging, is an “organ” of some kind in the bodyof some great being: its “heart,” an “eye,” or even its “brain.” If this werethe case, then the relatively small local cluster of galactic life forms, on theback of one of which we are presently riding, might seem lowly andinsignificant, but like, say, a blood cell entering into a vital organ of thebody, our galaxy would be a contributor to life itself.THE METAPHYSICAL PERSPECTIVEMany readers will probably be aware that this hermetic picture of an evolving,organic cosmos is completely at odds with the orthodox scientific version ofevents, which holds that the universe is essentially an involutionary phenomenonand that, given enough time, all physical systems within it must ultimatelydescend into chaos. The basis of this assumption is the most fundamentalscientific law, the second law of thermodynamics, which says that energy has anatural and irreversible tendency to dissipate. This is what is apparentlyhappening in the universe all the time, where high-density pockets of energy areunevenly distributed, mainly in stars, but also in planets and interstellarspace. All this energy is continually dispersing, and on our own planet this iswhat provides the impetus for all the chemical reactions that make lifepossible.Unlike closed physical systems, which simply “waste” their energy, biologicalsystems are highly organized entities, continually evolving into states ofever-increasing complexity. They are intelligent, in tune with theirenvironment, and so are capable of “exporting” entropy (disorder, chaos) and ofbringing in energy from outside themselves to sustain their own regenerative andcreative processes. As a cell grows and ultimately self-replicates, it iscontinually taking in energy from its environment and using it to manufactureessential biomolecular components. Similarly we ourselves take in “free energy”in the form of food, air, impressions, light quanta, and so on—all of which areresidual products of the greater, entropic movement of a thermodynamic universe.Thus, say scientists, organic systems do not actually violate the law ofthermodynamics; they are simply able to temporarily evade the overalldegenerative process as and when physical conditions are favorable. So we areall, in a sense, living on borrowed time. When the primary source of ourenergy—the sun—begins its inexorable descent into chaos, life on Earth willbecome history. Life in time, that is.But what about the proposed higher forms of “life” discussed earlier? What aboutall the solar beings in all the galaxies and all the galactic life formsexisting throughout the entire universe? Surely such entities, once created,would continue to exist and to evolve over billions of years irrespective of thedissipative physical energies harnessed in a given, isolated planetary system.Thus the heart of the solar cell— its sun—may die, but its “higher self,” or thecreative “genes” synthesized during its lifetime, must live on in the greatergalactic scale. We earlier ascertained that solar and galactic helices, if theyare a reality, would exist in other, greater dimensions—on the plane of light,for example, or in the quantum field—where there is no time as we know it andtherefore no frame of reference within which to define a degenerative dispersalof energy, an increase in entropy. This would explain why a photon can travelacross the entire universe and still maintain the maximum velocitypossible—because at the speed of light it is free from the ordinary ravages oftime.Clearly, therefore, there could be processes in the universe that continue tounfold irrespective of the directional flow of time. What is more, if thesehigher organic life forms do indeed exist, and all solar and galactic systemsare by and large becoming more and more “conscious,” then we might say that theoverwhelming tendency of the greater universe is to become less and less“chaotic” as it evolves.In The Infinite Harmony I suggested that the human animal, composed of billionsupon billions of cells, is, in effect, a universe in miniature, whose highlyorganized structures and functions are created from the coordinated activity ofa host of chromosomes, or microcosmic “galaxies.” Such a body is conceived andthen born, after which it grows through successive stages of development untilit reaches maturity. Ultimately it gives up the ghost and subsequently releasesits component particles, through natural decay, back into the entropic void. Itis, however, possible for the human being’s emotional, psychological, andspiritual output to continue long after the body has passed its prime and begunits inexorable descent back into the ocean of chaos. Furthermore, even when agiven individual is defined as “dead,” though virtually no trace of his or herphysical existence remains in space and time, the overall influences generatedduring his or her planetary existence—ideas, impressions, concepts, and soon—can persist, as in the well-documented cases of history’s major religiousfigures, for millennia. In a sense, these influences exist independently of theordinary time of the individual, whose life span is measured only in decades.Obviously, therefore, if the universe is alive, then presumably what is beingobserved through the eyes of astronomers and astrophysicists represents only itsphysical body developing in time. Its higher conscious functions, that is its“emotional,” “psychological,” and “spiritual” worlds, would be invisible to us,ostensibly because such processes would be operating in spheres that reach waybeyond the boundaries of the physical body, in the realms of the other realitiesalready discussed, in which statistical notions of space and time lose allmeaning.These “spheres” and their respective boundaries are the subject of the nextchapter. We have already divided the cosmos into four fundamental scales ororders of “intelligence”: DNA, the human brain, the solar helix, and thegalactic helix. But it is possible further to integrate these four scales into amore comprehensive cosmic picture by considering them in respect of anotheressentially hermetic concept, based on the assumption that the hermeticuniverse, a four-centered, living entity, exists and operates within an overallframework of seven interpenetrating dimensions."},{"pageContent":"10The Hierarchy of DimensionsWhile the “organic” universe is constructed from four basic orders of“intelligence,” hermetic theory tells us that this creature must exist withinthe framework of an octave, that is, of seven, or even eight, dimensions. Mostpeople recognize only the three dimensions of space and perhaps the fourthdimension of time, a greater “line” along which everything moves, as it were, inthe direction of eternity. But the true picture, as we shall see, may be muchwider in perspective, much more holistic than the reality we ordinarilyperceive.Let’s start at the beginning, with the zero dimension, which in geometry wouldbe defined as a finite point. If this point were to move in any direction, itwould trace a line. A line is a one-dimensional entity and can be defined by itslength only. Two dimensions would unfold if, for example, the whole line were tomove in a sideways motion, so tracing a plane, having both length and breadth.Similarly, three dimensions would be described if the whole plane were to movein any direction at an angle to its surface, thus tracing a solid, with length,breadth, and height. We ourselves, at our most basic level, arethree-dimensional entities, and so are the familiar sense-objects that make upour world.As we see, a greater dimension unfolds every time a new direction is described.A moving point describes a line, a moving line describes a plane, a moving planedescribes a three-dimensional solid.Now all three-dimensional objects are also, in a sense, moving in another quitedifferent direction. They are all getting progressively older, they are allexisting along their line of time, their fourth dimension. This is the highestdimension that can be perceived in our ordinary states of consciousness.Hermetic theory, however, calls for at least seven of these expanding spheres,so in order to identify these otherworlds, we obviously need to stretch ourimaginations somewhat and reach out beyond the realm of sense experience.Physicists have already paved the way in their attempts to conceptualize thenext dimension up from the line of time. This is the curious realm of thequantum, the nonlocal arena of inner space existing beyond ordinary time. We candescribe it in simplified terms as the dimension that would unfold if the lineof time were somehow to move in a direction perpendicular to itself, so tracinga greater “plane.” This is the fifth dimension, the “plane of light” discussedin earlier chapters.We have seen how the first three spatial dimensions describe a line, a plane,and a solid. And if, as hermetic theory says, “above” is intrinsically the sameas “below,” with a difference only in scale, then we should expect a similarrelationship to exist between the higher dimensions. Therefore, if the fourthdimension of time is a “line” and the fifth, the nonlocal sphere, is a “plane,”then the boundaries of the sixth would define what we might call the “solid”form of the ultimate reality.One might assume that this cosmic hierarchy of dimensions must end with thesixth, but we have already established that, if the cosmos is hermetic, it mustbe structured as a fundamental octave, so one would consequently expect thehierarchy of dimensions to reflect this order. We can therefore make one finalconceptual leap by positing a seventh sphere, which could be defined as themedium in which the whole universal phenomenon exists. Paradoxically, however,this seventh dimension could lead us right back to the very (zero) point fromwhich we started, for in such a reality, even the “medium” in which the universeexists (its street, city, planet, or whatever else might constitute its “space”)might simply be the equivalent of a finite point in an unimaginably greatersphere.We thus have seven interpenetrating dimensions coiling one out of another inever-increasing spheres, beginning with a point and ending on a point. If we nowremember that an octave also begins and ends on the same note, we can see thatthe hierarchy of dimensions fits in perfectly with the hermetic description ofthe universe.Now that we have a relatively ordered picture of this seven-dimensional“ladder,” we can try to ascertain our position within it. I hope readers willfind this at the very least an interesting intellectual exercise and, at best,perhaps a way of understanding that, hidden deep within our nature, we humanbeings do in fact have a deep and profound affinity with the wider universe.We can begin with one of the basic premises of hermetic theory, which says thatwhat is above is the same as that which is below. Taken quite literally, thismeans that all of us are microcosmic copies of the universe itself—“images ofGod.”If this is so, then this miniature universe of “galactic” or chromosomal lifeforms must exist within the framework of seven dimensions, the equivalent ofthree spatial dimensions, one of time, and three more ascending spheres,corresponding to the “plane of light,” the “solid of reality,” and, finally, theinexpressible seventh dimension, the “medium” in which the whole exists.Now if chromosomal DNA is the microcosmic equivalent of the double helix of themind, we can say that, like the brain, it is housed in a three-dimensionalstructure living in its own dimension of time and that there must be otherdimensions existing above and below it. Below the three-and four-dimensionalscale of DNA, an intelligent, organic molecule, we have the scale of the muchsmaller inorganic molecule. The difference between inorganic and organic isvast. They are literally a dimension apart, and so we can consider the inorganicmolecule as a relative manifestation of a two-dimensional plane. Moving on down,we come to the atomic scale, the equivalent, perhaps, of a one-dimensional line.Finally we have the chromodynamic scale of the electron and other subatomicwaves and particles—points in space.We now come to the dimensions above these chromosomal life forms, the dimensionsexisting beyond their space and time.To identify these we need first to consider the overall lifetime of thisminiature universe—that is, the human being—and the huge developmental leap fromthe DNA double helix to the double helix of the mind. All of this takes place intime, at least from the atomic scale upward. (Subatomic quanta, remember, existin a timeless, nonlocal, zero dimension.)Obviously DNA’s scale of time is vastly more compacted than the timescale of theconscious human being. The cell is born, it works frantically all its life, andthen it dies, or rather divides, in a matter of hours, days, or weeks. But ofcourse its influences—its genes—live on through the chromosomes, endlesslydividing and multiplying for several decades. If the single cell could have anyconception of its own time and, like us, speculate beyond its own experientialexistence, several decades would seem to it like an eternity. And if some formof superior microcosmic intelligence were to suggest to the cell that its“soul,” after death, or division, would in fact live for eternity, this humblelittle grafter might find such a notion a shade fanciful. And yet, this isprecisely what does happen. The cell’s influences, its genes, continue to bepassed on through millions and billions of generations of other cells until thegreater organism—its “universal host”—ultimately expires. Thus we might say thatthe body of the host organism not only represents a higher dimension for thecell, it is also one into which the cell can actively input evolutionary data.Let’s call this dimension the chromosome’s equivalent of the plane of light, thetimeless, “eternal” fifth dimension.The sixth dimension of our miniature universe, like the “solid” form of theultimate reality described earlier, must be of an order infinitely greater andmore complex than the fifth, planelike sphere—that is, the greater physical bodyinhabited by all of the organism’s cells. It would be a dimension that wouldunfold if an entirely new direction were taken, that is, if all the cells in thebody of a living organism were to combine and expand in some way, as a lineexpands into a plane and a plane into a solid. This, I would suggest, is wherethe consciousness of the organism kicks in, where the double helix of the mind,the ultimate creation of DNA, is finally formed. Clearly creation of theconscious mind of this miniature universe is a genuine transcendentalphenomenon, existing and evolving in an infinitely higher scale of being to thatof the single cell. This would be the cell’s sixth dimension. To this higherconscious mind, the “eternity” of the individual cell, or the sum of all thelives of all of its body’s cells, is perceived as but a single lifetime. What ismore, the mind of this greater being, the cell’s “god,” possesses self-awarenessand is fully conscious, not only of its own physical existence (which is theentire universe to the cell), but also of its environment, of its world at largeand, perhaps, of other beings similar to it. From the perspective of the cell,therefore, this inexpressible environment, the home of its microcosmic universe,would be the seventh-dimensional medium in which its sixth-dimensional godexists.As we see, the seven dimensions unfolding in the biomolecular world are relatedin the same way as the greater universal framework of dimensions describedearlier: point to line, line to plane, plane to solid, then further on to agreater “line,” a greater “plane,” a greater “solid,” and, finally, a “medium”in which the whole exists.If we now apply the DNA model to the greater scale of existence of the humanbrain, then we can say that the successful “genes” created by the double helixof the mind—its ideas or concepts—exactly like the genes of the individualchromosome, can in fact last for “eternity”; that is, they can exist in thefifth dimension, on the timeless plane of light, or within the collectiveconsciousness of the entire human race. Genes can do that; they can permeatethrough to every cell in the body. Likewise, objective concepts can do exactlythe same thing; they can permeate through to every other conscious mind on theplanet. More importantly, however, if the theory of transcendental evolutionholds true, such concepts would also in the process be actively contributingtoward the creation of an infinitely greater, universal consciousness.So “God” is a six-dimensional entity. And so, in a very real sense, are you;only the scale is different. But, of course, this mighty macrocosmic being wouldbe six-dimensional only to us. From the perspective of the DNA strand or that ofthe individual cell, our “God” would represent six dimensions squared, whichmeans that the “medium” in which the universe exists would represent sevendimensions squared. Add to this the eighth—point zero—and we arrive at our nowfamiliar hermetic concept, which holds that the ultimate creative element is theproduct of the square of the constant.So far we have identified two coexistent and interpenetrating “universes,” theone in which the cell exists and the greater universe in which we ourselvesexist. DNA forms the nucleus of a cell in the body of its six-dimensional“universe”—the human being—and the double helix of the mind is the nucleus of acell in the body of a greater six-dimensional universe existing as some godlikebeing of inexpressible form and character.Now, just as the double helix of the mind evolved from the cumulative work ofhundreds of billions of cells and chromosomes, then we would expect a similarprocess to develop in the next scale of evolution, the scale of the solar helixalready posited. So as the solar body grows out of our concepts, a highersix-dimensional “mind” should eventually evolve from it. This would be the“mind” of our perceived “universe,” our God. But this solar mind, like DNA andthe human mind, must also be a “chromosome,” a creative, organic intelligenceexisting in the nucleus of a cell in the body of its “universe,” in the nextscale up, the scale of the galactic helix. And again, if the whole is developinghermetically, then ultimately an even greater “six-dimensional” galactic “mind”would evolve, presumably functioning as a “chromosome” in the greatest scale ofthem all—the “body” of its universe.Thus each scale has its own “universe,” and they are all inextricablyinterconnected, each being six-dimensional in relation to the one below it, eachliving and evolving in a seven-dimensional arena.TIME: A ONE-WAY TICKET?As we have noted, it is possible to differentiate between dimensions in terms oftheir relative times. The individual cell’s time, for example, is very much morecompacted than the time of the human being. The “eternity” of the cell, or thesum total of all the lives of all the cells within organisms like you or me, isequivalent to a normal human life-time. Similarly the time of the human beingmust be equally compacted in relation to the timescale of the solar being, towhom our “eternity” would likewise be perceived as but a single lifetime. By thesame token, the lifetimes of all solar beings—their “eternity”—would be a singlelifetime to the galactic being, whose own “eternity,” the sum of the life-timesof all galaxies everywhere, would in turn represent the lifetime of its god, theultimate universal entity.Time, therefore, is variable, relative. But what is it exactly? Is it somethingthat flows like a metaphysical river, gathering up everything in its wake? Or isthe whole phenomenon, as mystics and shaman have always believed, simply anillusion? According to the experimentally verifiable theories of modern physics,of course, the shaman and priests have been right all along; time doesn’t reallyexist. If you were able to travel at the speed of light, the “river” of timewould apparently cease to flow. At least, that’s how the scientist sees it. Buthermetic theory hints at another possible scenario. It suggests, in fact, thatthis state of timelessness described by the physicist is also an illusion ofsorts: the “river” still flows but at a rate so lacking in apparent motion as tobe imperceptible through ordinary scientific investigation.The speed of light, or the speed of the constant, defines the boundary betweendimensions four and five, between the time dimension and the plane of light,where time as we know it slows down to a virtual standstill. Therefore speed, orrate of vibration, is the key. The faster you move, or the quicker you“vibrate,” the slower time flows and, relatively speaking, the longer you live.Now, if reaching the constant speed of light would gain us entry into the fifthdimension, one might suppose that the even higher sphere, the sixth, could beaccessed in much the same way, but with one crucial difference—the “velocity”barrier, or the required rate of “vibrations,” would no longer be the speed ofthe constant, but rather the square of it. This is no arbitrary choice ofmeasure, of course. As we noted previously, it is one that is very subtlyencoded in the Magic Square of Mercury, which in turn was associated with theGreat Pyramid, known in ancient times as “The Lights,” or “Lights-measures.”We have now made our way up to the penultimate sixth dimension and the timescaleof the galaxy. So what happens here? Presumably time would still flow, albeit ata rate we can only describe as a virtual standstill squared.From here we have one dimension to go, the ultimate seventh, the medium in whichthe whole exists. How fast would we have to move, or to resonate, in order tolook out through the eyes of God into his seven-dimensional Garden of Eden? Onceagain, hermetic theory can provide us with a plausible answer: the cosmos is ahighly ordered musical entity, and so the characteristic “vibrations” of eachdimension must be harmoniously related to each other. Therefore if the plane oflight is accessed through the velocity of light and the solid of reality isaccessed through the square of the velocity of light, then the seventhdimension, the medium in which this “solid” exists, might reasonably be expectedto unfold at the cube of this velocity. Here, “time” would truly stand still,and genuine nonlocality would be a living reality.A BRIEF RETROSPECTIVEConfused? To be perfectly honest, so am I. Frequently. But then we are trying tocome to terms with the imponderable here, and leftbrain logic alone can take usonly so far in the quest for the ultimate reality. Eventually, it seems, we havesomehow to experience this multidimensional reality for ourselves, and suchexperiences, as scientists are now aware, invariably involve a certain amount ofintuitive insight. Unfortunately, this power, which might be considered themodern equivalent of the shamanistic vision, is a faculty that tends to appearonly in sparse, random bursts. You cannot sit down and willfully intuit your wayout of an intellectual maze; it just seems to happen. But these intuitivemoments, these “macromutations” of the human mind, are essential to ourevolutionary progress; they are the very life-blood of consciousness. Thereforenot only should we pay heed to them, we should at all times be looking forpossible ways to cultivate the soil in which they grow and thereby bring aboutan increase in their yield. The shaman uses mindaltering agents to induce suchstates; the mystic uses intense study, objective psychology, and rigorousdiscipline; the scientist simply relies on chance—hence the fragmentary natureof our accumulated knowledge.As a consequence, the evolutionary process I am trying to envisage, with itsplethora of scales and dimensions, very probably falls a long way short of thecomplete intuitive picture perceived by the originators of hermetic theory. Ihave personally had many vivid glimpses of this picture and have often feltoverwhelmed at the sheer enormity of the implications of the central concept. Atother times I have thought otherwise, that perhaps I might have lost the plotsomewhere along the line and recklessly allowed myself to be carried along onthe wings of my imagination. After all, who am I to pronounce on the theory ofeverything? What gives me the right to probe the disciplined mind of the modernevolutionist, the nuclear physicist, the theologian, even God himself? Am I notsimply wasting my time dreaming up imaginary, incomprehensible worlds, whenthere are more practical things to do?These and many other such thoughts have intermittently plagued me for years, butdeep down I have maintained a conviction that the Hermetic Code is much biggerthan me or my critics—or indeed all of us—and that it will forever continue toexert its influence on human consciousness irrespective of our individualprejudices and subjective experiences. I am therefore strongly inclined to comedown squarely on the side of those who created this remarkable belief system, agenuine science, possibly the most highly evolved of Earth’s inhabitants. Thesegreat visionaries were not only in tune with what Schwaller de Lubicz called“all the harmonies and energies of the universe,” they were also profoundlyaltruistic and deeply concerned about the future development of mankind and ofevolution per se. This is why they went to such great lengths to transmit theirknowledge of the sacred laws of nature, because they knew that without it,without a clear understanding of the unity of everything, we should never beable to handle what lies ahead. And so the Hermetic Code is their legacy, agenuine seed of wisdom sown in distant times, whose “genes” have permeated theentire body of human consciousness. Not only does it explain exactly how and whythe evolutionary process unfolds as it does, it also lets us as humans know howwe can become a conscious part of it all, a truly remarkable gift to one’ssuccessors.So the universe, as the ancient Greek initiates were saying two and a halfthousand years ago, is hermetic throughout, very much alive, the direct organicresult of some great cosmic act of procreation. We must therefore assume that,like all organic creatures, this great cosmic entity will eventually die.Scientific theory generally supports this view, i.e., that the universe wasconceived, that it is growing at an unprecedented rate, that it will eventuallyreach its prime, and then start aging, eventually to dissipate all its energythroughout space and time in a long, slow burnout.But of course death, according to hermetic theory, is not just the final “note”of one’s personal evolutionary scale, it is also the first “note” of the greaterscale above, the beginning, as it were, of a new, higher level of existence. Thecreators of the Hermetic Code, for example, died, like all of us must, but as wecan all bear witness, their knowledge, their spirit, their higher selves, havelived on.So let’s suppose that the universe is destined to perish in what scientists seeas a long, slow “heat-death.” Will that really be the end of everything, ascosmologists predict? Or will the process of evolution extend yet further, asthe universe’s “higher self” transcends to greater things? Obviously on thispoint hermetic theory represents something of a departure from the scientificposition, because it calls for an ongoing organic scenario, where theevolutionary processes above and below are seen as essentially the same.These two opposing views might seem currently irreconcilable but, as we shallsee in the following chapter, both theories, ancient and modern, conform to thesame cosmic design. The main distinction between them lies in the fact thatcosmological theory, like Darwinian theory, is concerned primarily with thephysical body of the “organism,” whereas the hermetic theory of transcendentalevolution offers a much more holistic view, one that allows for the naturaldeath of the physical body, but which in addition takes into account the wider,external influences created by the individual in life.So now we find that the universe itself is also an “individual,” and that it hasdefinite and unique characteristics. As we noted earlier, galaxy distribution isnot strictly homogeneous, which means that the “body” of the universe is lumpyand uneven like yours, the “seeds” of this design having been identified inslight variations in the background radiation left over from the big bang. As anindividual, therefore, the universe, like you and me, may have a destiny as wellas a fate. Fate is the inevitable lot of all organic creatures; it locks theminto an irresistible life–death cycle that is beyond the individual’s control.Destiny, however, is a potential, a future something that is developed anddetermined in an individual’s lifetime and that is associated with the “higherself.” In the case of the universe, we see that its fate is acknowledged byscience, but that its destiny is left completely out of the picture. The nextchapter is an attempt to rectify this imbalance by examining the establishedscientific viewpoint specifically in the light of hermetic theory. As we shallsee, this exercise leads to some very interesting and rather startlingconclusions."},{"pageContent":"11The Fate of the UniverseWe can begin here with the current scientific worldview, which holds that theuniverse is basically a chaotic, expanding mass of space, time, matter, andenergy. The root of this assumption is the second law of thermodynamics, whichsays simply that heat always flows from hot to cold and never vice versa. Thismeans that all the energy in the universe will continually disperse far and wideuntil it is distributed evenly everywhere. An involutionary process such asthis, if it remains unchecked, will eventually lead to a long, slow, heat-deathfor the universe; all matter will become icy-cold and lifeless, its energyhaving been spread thinly throughout space, remaining only as a residualvibration, like a faint whisper in an otherwise silent void.This rather depressing state of affairs, say cosmologists, should not concern ustoo much, because it will take many billions of years of gradually increasingentropy for such conditions to arise, and in any case the human race willcertainly not be around to witness this ultimate state of chaos. This heat-deathscenario implies, of course, that the universe is basically a closed physicalsystem.An alternative to the above prediction is the idea of the “big crunch.”Proponents of this theory suggest that the collective force of gravity willeventually overcome all other forces. When this happens the entire cosmos willat first cease to expand; then it will begin to contract again under thecumulative force of gravity, increasing in temperature as galaxies converge, thewhole thing collapsing inward toward a final “singularity”—the big crunch. Thiswould mean the total annihilation of everything: space, time, matter, energy.There has been further speculation that the resultant singularity could somehowtrigger another almighty bang, so beginning a whole new cycle, a repeatedexpansion of the universe out to the limits permitted by the critical density ofall its mass, only to contract again toward another mind-boggling crunch—and soon, ad infinitum.Interestingly enough, this description is very similar to the ancient Hinduversion of cosmological events, which sees the universe continually appearingand disappearing in a well-defined rhythmic cycle known as “a day and night ofBrahma.”Physicists, however, doubt the possibility of endless cycles repeating withoutchange, pointing out that there are serious physical problems with such atheory. We need not detail them here, but they apparently arise as aninescapable consequence of the inviolable second law, which would call forbigger and bigger cosmic cycles expanding with ever-increasing limits, untileventually future cycles would become so long that conditions within them wouldbe indistinguishable from those prevailing in a big freeze.Another interesting theory has been proposed by the science-fiction writerWilbur Wright in his book Time: Gateway to Immortality. Wright begins bypointing out an interesting feature of the expanding universe, which is that thegalaxies farthest away from us are receding at velocities close to one-tenth thespeed of light. If these galaxies were eventually to reach the speed of light,he says, they might coalesce into enormous balls of matter and energy,ultimately contracting on themselves to become tiny, superdense neutron stars orblack holes. Wright then goes on to propose a similar fate for the cosmos as awhole, suggesting that at the speed of light the tiny body resulting from thecollapse of the entire universe might rupture the fabric of space-time and passthrough into an adjoining continuum at high velocity and temperature. The endresult would be another big bang, and so the beginning of another great cycle inthe endless evolution of whatever it is that is evolving. Wright visualizes aninfinite succession of universes and interpenetrating voids stretching from theunimaginably large to the infinitesimally small. As each continuum empties, afresh singularity from some microcosmic region emerges to start a new cycle. Ashe says, nature abhors closed systems, so the sequence from small to large wouldbe open-ended and potentially infinite.There are, in fact, a number of alternative cosmogenic theories currently underconsideration involving obscure phenomena like black and white holes,antigravity and inflationary processes, the “false” and “true” vacuumrelationship, and so on. But clearly the most interesting of them all in respectto this present investigation is the proposition made by Lee Smolin, which isthat there might even be a form of natural selection operating among universes,of which the evolution of life and consciousness may be a direct consequence.Smolin, of course, comes at this from the background of classical science. As wenoted in chapter 9 [17_chapter09.html], the astrophysicist George Smoot has alsoopted for what looks set to become the “biological paradigm” by asserting thatthe structured physical characteristics of the present universe were alreadyencoded within its “cosmic DNA” as early as a mere 300,000 years after the bigbang. It is unlikely that these primordial “genes” simply materialized out ofnothing, so we may reasonably assume that they were actually encoded within theoriginal “cosmic egg” at the very beginning of time.As we see, these ideas tie in perfectly with the hermetic description of events,which tells us that the universe above is a living creature, a zoon, and thatthe life and consciousness of sentient beings below or within it are faithfulrecapitulations of the original hermetic blueprint, part of an irresistibleprocess that is vital to the sustained evolutionary development of the whole.Thus, while the physical body of this multidimensional creature may or may notbe headed toward a final state of thermodynamic equilibrium, the greateruniverse, if it is alive and conscious in some mysterious way, could haveemotional, psychological, and even spiritual sides to its existence. These areaspects we would define as being associated with the higher dimensions, in whichthe whole manifests as a six-dimensional phenomenon, an open system that,exactly like planetary biosystems below, is able to export entropy into its“environment”—the seventh dimension—and to simultaneously import the energyneeded to sustain its ongoing development.If this were so and the universal chain of existence proved to be open-ended andpotentially infinite, then the second law would not be violated in any way:energy of some kind could still enter from outside the system. This externalenergy would not, of course, prevent the physical body of the universe fromultimately dying. Like your own, if it is basically organic, then eventually itmust. But even if it were to die, through whatever means, one would still expectit to have the capacity to pass on its hereditary characteristics in some way.Possibly, therefore, the background radiation fluctuations described by GeorgeSmoot as “cosmic DNA” are the result of hereditary genes bearing thecharacteristics of some earlier parent universes.THE “OTHER” UNIVERSEAs I have already implied, the transcendental “higher self” of the universe(that is its psychological and spiritual natures) would have to be connected insome way with the higher dimensions. The question is, How might such aconnection be established? How could an expanding, chaotic mass of purelyphysical phenomena ever escape from the fourth dimension?The distance to the edge of the universe, or to the outer wave of expandinggalaxies, is not known, but scientists have calculated that these galaxies aremoving away from us at around 10 percent the speed of light, as noted before. Noone knows whether the outer galaxies will ever attain the speed of light, but ifthe universe has enough outward momentum to continue expanding at anaccelerating rate forever, then it is not unreasonable to suppose that thiscould and very probably will happen. Attempts have been made to discover ifthere is enough gravitating matter in the universe to cause it to contractagain, but there appears to be an unknown quantity of “dark” matter out there,so calculations have been necessarily speculative. However, Paul Davies has beenmoved to remark, in The Last Three Minutes: “Taken at face value, the galaxiesseem to be flying apart so fast that they may indeed just ‘escape’ from theuniverse, or at least from one another, and ‘never come down.’”1[26_note.html#fo111]Of course, if the galaxies did continue to accelerate unhindered they couldeventually reach the speed of light itself, to the threshold of a quitedifferent reality—the timeless, fifth dimension of existence. Wilbur Wright hassuggested that at this point the whole galaxy might coalesce into an enormousball of matter and energy, ultimately contracting upon itself to become asuperdense neutron star or a black hole. However, this would be an unlikely end,one might think, for something so vibrant and radiant as a living cell in thebody of the universe.So, assuming this did occur, that the outer galaxies effectively “escaped” fromthe fourth dimension and reached the threshold of the plane of light, thentheoretically they would be freed from the consequences of the second law ofthermodynamics, which relies on the “arrow of time” to define any increase inentropy, or any waxing or waning of energy content. On the plane of light therewould be no time mechanism with which to measure any kind of change. Out thereit is always midday: nothing waxes, nothing wanes, everything just is.Presumably this is why the photon quantum, existing on the plane of light, ispotentially everlasting; if unhindered by matter, it can maintain its vitalspark and its maximum velocity for billions upon billions of years. Thebackground microwave radiation permeating the whole universe, which scientistssay is the residual vibration left over from the big bang, consists ofphotons—light quanta—and these quanta have been moving at the same maximumvelocity from the moment they were first created. If these photons can last fromfifteen to twenty billion years, they can reasonably be expected to last foranother twenty billion years, and so on, in virtual perpetuity. Clearly there isno evidence of advancing chaos in such a dimension of existence, no increase inentropy as we would normally define it.What we have here, of course, in this future scenario of galaxies escaping fromthe time dimension and “never coming down,” is a graphic example of theuniversal process of transcendental evolution unfolding. These galactic helices,the cells of the universal body, would effectively enter into a higher scale ofexistence, a scale no less musical than the one below, but one that encompassesan infinitely greater reality.So let us now trace the origin of the galactic cell back to the point at whichthe whole musical phenomenon first came into being. The big bang might be saidto represent the very first note, Do, in the greater fundamental octave ofuniversal evolution. Significantly, conditions of existence when this first notewas sounded were such that there was no space, no time, and, therefore,absolutely no entropy. We can envisage this universal octave as havingsubsequently developed in all directions, from the first note, Do, of the bigbang, up through various intermediary stages, perhaps into the “re” of earlyexpansion and cooling, the “mi” of particle formation, the “fa” of the firststar formations, the “so” of galaxy formation, the “la” of the formation ofaccompanying biosystems or habitable planets, and the “ti” of the appearance oforganic life and of observers like you and me. These are merely hypotheticalstages, but they all have one thing in common in that they manifest in thefourth dimension of time. In addition, they all encompass within theirstructures the three lower dimensions: solid, plane, line. Now, if we accept thehermetic interpretation of cosmic events, we can say that the time dimension,like everything else, is itself a fundamental octave, and that the ultimatenote, Do, at the top of this scale of development would be sounded by allgalaxies everywhere as and when they reached the light barrier—a kind ofcelestial version of the sonic boom.In the case of the major musical scale, we know that the first note and the lastare one and the same (Do), with a difference only in scale. By the same token wecan say that the first and last notes of the universal time octave describedabove must also be in essence the same, again with a difference only in scale.Logically, therefore, one would expect the conditions prevailing at the momentof initial creation (no space, no time, no entropy) to prevail also insidegalaxies entering the dimension above. And so they would, for at the speed oflight, space contracts to nothing, time stands still, and everything moving atsuch a velocity—like the photon—is in a permanent state of thermodynamicequilibrium.We have thus far followed the evolution of the universe from the big bang to thesuperluminal boom of “escaping” galaxies and so traced the development of onefundamental octave of universal resonance. According to musical theory, ofcourse, the ultimate note, Do, at the top of this scale would not only be thelast, it would also be the first note of the next scale above. Therefore, anygalaxies developing up to this stage, transforming themselves, or a higher partof themselves, into five-dimensional entities would then have the potential toevolve up through the next ascending scale of universal resonance. So eachgalactic cell, upon reaching the threshold of the fifth dimension, would thencontinue to expand in some way, to develop further as its transcendental bodyapproached nearer and nearer to speeds approaching the square of the speed oflight, into a six-dimensional, solid form. Just like an individual cell in agrowing planetary organism, the greater body of the galaxy would steadily becomepregnant with six-dimensional cosmic “proteins.” In the organic world, a normalself-replicating cell that has reached this condition of “optimum resonance”ultimately divides. Could a “pregnant” galaxy somehow do the same? If theuniverse is a closed system it probably could not, but if it is open andorganic, living in a seven-dimensional arena, anything is possible. For evidenceof such a process, which in our timescale might be an extremely rare occurrence,we should perhaps be looking for two galaxies coexisting side by side that arestructurally mirror images of one another.If a galaxy could “divide” in some way, the question as to how this might occuris even more perplexing. It has been suggested that at the center of allrevolving galaxies is a black hole, a monstrous, superdense, supergravitationalentity from whose clutches even light can’t escape. A black hole would literallytear apart anything that came within its immediate sphere of influence—its“event horizon”—including, of course, stars and their planets. Certainastrophysicists have suggested that a black hole could act as a kind of nonlocalconduit through which anything passing might subsequently emerge “on the otherside” into a totally different but coexistent space-time continuum.It is hard even to imagine the extraordinary sequence of events that mighttranspire as the greater “body” of the galaxy transformed itself into asix-dimensional being. Once it had reached the first conceptual barrier—thespeed of light—and transmuted some kind of resonance through to the fifthdimension, these transcendental vibrations would thereafter become a part of awhole, new, wider reality. Earlier we noted that a higher dimension unfoldsevery time a new direction is determined. In the case of the galaxy reaching thelight barrier, this new direction would be something akin to a lateral,planelike development, spreading out at 90 degrees to the initial line ofmovement. The original line of movement would remain just that—a relative“line”—a cross-section of the greater five-dimensionality of the thing.Similarly the transition of the galaxy from five-to six-dimensional form wouldalso proceed in an entirely new direction, so that its final condition would beas far removed from its five-dimensional manifestation as a solid is from aEuclidean plane.So a galaxy that had successfully attained its final six-dimensional form wouldhave effectively evolved up through the second fundamental octave of universalresonance, again from the first note, Do, sounded by crossing the light barrier,up to the next fundamental note, Do, the second barrier marked by the square ofthe speed of light. But even atthis stage or on this scale, at the beginning of the third octave of universaldevelopment, the galaxy would still be in the process of evolving. We canaccordingly depict this overall cosmic process of the galaxy’s coming tofruition using our usual diagrammatic format:[images/11.jpg]Obviously the mass of a galaxy could never accelerate beyond the speed of light.It would have to remain either suspended on, or marginally below, the plane oflight. Any further superluminal motion, therefore, would have to involvenonmaterial resonances. These metaphysical vibrations would emanate from thematerial core, the galactic “chromosome,” and would then proceed to develop inan entirely new direction, diffusing their energies, if not yet instantaneously,then at speeds far greater than that of light. As to the possible nature ofthese higher energies or forms of resonance, they might, as I have alreadysuggested in earlier chapters, be composite structures formed from the consciousthoughts of sentient beings existing in the given galaxy. Admittedly we are inthe realms of science fiction here, but then consciousness itself is a form ofresonance, vibrant, energetic, alive, and its very existence represents a newdirection in which the galaxy can continue to grow and develop.So, if the galaxy itself is a chromosome, then, relative to the same scale ofexistence, sentient beings like ourselves would be the metaphysical equivalentof biochemical “triplet codons,” created and subsequently ejected by the doublehelix above out into the cytoplasm (the planetary world in time), presumably sothat we can ultimately dictate the synthesis of the higher, finer substancesrequired for further evolution.In the living cell, triplet codons act as templates for the manufacture offiner, more resonant substances—amino acids, the building blocks of life.Similarly, the human mind codes for the manufacture of metaphysical “aminoacids”—ideas, concepts, theories, and so on. Now, in the cytoplasmic membrane ofthe cell, there are special enzymes that cause the newly developed amino-acidchains to fold up into the more complex protein macromolecules. Likewise,therefore, in the greater macrocosm there should be components out there in thecosmic “cytoplasm” of the sky whose function is to “fold up” our concepts andtheories into immense, radiant, “protein” structures. As I suggested in chapter7 [15_chapter07.html], these cosmic “enzymes” may be connected in some way withthe sun and its planets (and perhaps their moons), whose varying magneticinfluences pervade the whole solar system and whose orbital cycles arehermetically related to one another, endlessly beating out in time the relativevalues of the major scale. We note further, from Robert Temple’s discovery thatthe Pythagorean Comma is expressed in the mass ratio of Sirius B and our sun,that this hermetic symmetry could also extend to the stars and even, perhaps, ifthe dictum of Thoth holds true at every level, to the galaxies themselves.Certainly starlight is hermetically structured, as indeed is all light—and itvibrates throughout the entire universe. So it would be no exaggeration to saythat there is music literally everywhere, in the chromodynamic and atomic scalesof matter, in DNA and the genetic code, in the double helix of the human brainand the Hermetic Code, in solar and galactic helices, in the octave ofdimensions—even in the “mind” of the universe itself."},{"pageContent":"12Inner OctavesBy this stage readers will appreciate that the universe may have many morefacets than science currently allows. No longer do we see it as simply afour-dimensional phenomenon involving according to thermodynamic principles; ithas now become a vibrant, essentially six-dimensional entity, possibly teemingwith innumerable kinds of lesser six-dimensional life forms. These various lifeforms, as we have noted, occupy various scales of existence on the evolutionaryladder, beginning at the level of DNA and culminating at the scale of thegalactic helix, all of them coexisting within a framework of seven dimensions.Now, this ascending “ladder” is not simply a progressive chain of separate rungsplaced one on top of another. If the whole universe is a living entity, thismeans that it is a fully synchronized body, the vibrations of all scalesinterpenetrating and reinforcing one another strictly according to the dictatesof the grand design. We might best view this evolutionary phenomenon as a seriesof seven pulsating spheres of vibrations, each being contained within the oneabove it, all of them sharing the same central point.For example, linear DNA contains within it the whole atomic scale, an infinityof “points,” or an endlessly variable sequence of nitrogenous base pairs, eachconsisting of a few fundamental atoms. But it also contains within it the seeds,or genes, of the greater scale above; it is the blueprint, the recipe, for thecreation of the entire organism. In the same way the organism of the human beingcontains within it the whole DNA scale, an “infinity” of biomolecules, and also,one assumes, the seeds or genes of the greater solar body above. We can imaginethe same process repeating itself up through the galactic scale, to theultimate, Absolute scale.The hierarchy of dimensions is also integrated in the same manner. Aone-dimensional entity—a line—contains within it an infinite number ofzero-dimensional points and is a cross-section, a blue-print, of a greaterplane; a plane is comprised of an infinite number of one-dimensional lines andis a cross-section of a greater solid; and a solid, in a similar fashion,contains within it an infinite number of two-dimensional planes and is across-section of a greater four-dimensional entity existing along the line oftime. Exactly the same pattern would repeat itself in the metaphysical scalesabove, where the four-dimensional line of time encompasses all three-dimensionalpossibilities, the five-dimensional plane of light all four-dimensionalpossibilities, and the six-dimensional “solid” form of the ultimate realityembraces everything: points, lines, planes, solids, time, eternity.Such a view expresses above all the holistic nature of the universe, on which weshall be concentrating in the following two chapters. We are now familiar withthe idea of the complete interconnectedness of everything, a principle thatmystics and yogis have intuitively understood for thousands of years and whichscientists of the twentieth century latterly discovered through the so-callednonlocal quantum correlations existing between widely separated particles. Butis there a way in which this somewhat tenuous and abstract reality can be betterunderstood? That is, if the entire universe is a nonlocal arena ofinterpenetrating and mutually interacting vibrations, how might such anall-encompassing process work? For example, how can vibrations or wave/particlesin one part of the universe be simultaneously “in tune” with vibrations lightyears away? Or, alternatively, how could the conscious mind of the mystic or theshaman or the LSD tripper connect with a nonlocal reality?In chapter 8 [16_chapter08.html], we noted that musical theory itself providedat least part of an explanation for simultaneity, whereby the ultimate note ofany given harmonious scale can at one and the same time exist in other scales,above and below. But can we determine what kind of mechanism allows these vastlydifferent scales to be so intimately linked?As it happens, we can. And, not surprisingly perhaps, we need look no furtherthan the theory of transcendental evolution, the “theory of everything,” for amajor clue. This is the sacred number 64, the number of infinite harmony, thekey, as it were, to infinity. Primarily associated with the Great Pyramid—amonument dedicated to light, or “lightsmeasures”—the number 64 tells us that anoctave of light is further subdivisible into eight inner octaves.Just for the record, this concept of inner octaves—an outline of which followsin a moment—did not come to me directly as a result of my preoccupation with theHermetic Code. In fact, I first came across it several years before I fullyrealized the Code’s significance. My source at that time was Ouspensky’s InSearch of the Miraculous, the record of lectures given by George Gurdjieff inMoscow and St. Petersburg at the turn of the twentieth century. As I said in theintroduction, Gurdjieff always claimed that his system of knowledge was drawnfrom teachings reaching back into the remotest antiquity, but even after readingeverything written by or about him it was some time before I made the connectionand realized that the principle of inner octaves is in fact very neatly embodiedin the Hermetic Code, the oldest recorded teaching on Earth.Gurdjieff tells us that all matter vibrates, resonates within, in the form ofoctaves. Normally, when we speak of matter, we are referring to phenomena ofsubstance, things we can touch, see, or measure through some form of scientificmethod. According to Gurdjieff, however, the property of materiality spans theentire universal spectrum. “Everything in this universe can be weighed andmeasured,” he said, “The Absolute is as material, as weighable and measurable asthe moon, or as man.”1 [26_note.html#fo121] The higher orders of materiality,however, are much too rarefied to be regarded as matter from the point of viewof chemistry or physics; matter on a higher plane is not material at all for thelower planes, but it permeates them nonetheless.In his lectures, Gurdjieff often referred to a cosmological model known as the“ray of creation,” which, he said, belonged to ancient knowledge. Basically, itwas an elementary plan of the universe, beginning with the highest “world order”and ending with the lowest, so:1. Absolute2. All worlds3. All suns4. Sun5. All planets6. Earth7. MoonAs we see, the ray of creation, like the hierarchy of dimensions alreadydiscussed, represents seven planes in the universe, seven worlds, one withinanother. (Pythagoras, incidentally, expressed this same view through hisgeometrical symbol known as the Lambda, comprising seven concentric circles.)Gurdjieff then described this descending octave, or order of worlds, in terms ofthe cumulative effect of the law of three forces at each successive level. Inthe world of the Absolute, the three forces, being harmoniously related in thefullest sense, constitute one whole. The Absolute world is therefore designatedby the number one.In a world of the second order (all worlds), the three forces are alreadydivided. Such a world would be designated by the number 3. These three dividedforces, meeting together in each of these worlds, create new worlds of the thirdorder (all suns), each of which manifests three new forces of its own, so thatthe number of forces operating within them will be six. In these worlds aregenerated worlds of the fourth order (the sun), in which there operate threeforces of the second-order world, six forces of the third-order world, and threeof their own, making twelve forces altogether. The process continues, givingtwenty-four forces in worlds of the fifth order (all planets), forty-eight inworlds of the sixth order, of which the Earth is a part, and ninety-six in theseventh (moon). It follows, therefore, that the number of forces in each orderof worlds, one, three, six, twelve, and so on, indicates the number of lawscontrolling it. So the fewer laws there are in a given world order, the nearerit is to the will of the Absolute; the more laws there are in a given world, thegreater the mechanicalness, the further it is from the will of the Absolute. Welive in a world subject to forty-eight orders of laws, that is to say, very farfrom the will of the Absolute and in a very remote and dark corner of theuniverse.2 [26_note.html#fo122]Following on from this descending pattern of accumulating laws and forces,Gurdjieff then explains how the materiality of each world order differsaccordingly, becoming ever denser as it involves from the Absolute to the moon.All matter, he says, including that of the world of the Absolute, is composed of“primordial atoms.” Obviously these “atoms” should not be confused with thosedescribed in ordinary physics; rather, they are certain small particles that areindivisible only on the given plane. Only on world 1, the world of the Absolute,are these particles truly indivisible. The “atoms” of world 3 consist of threeatoms of the Absolute world and so would be three times bigger and heavier.Again, the “atoms” of world 6 each consist of six atoms of the Absolute—and soon, according to the laws and forces described above, with twelve primordial“particles” constituting an “atom” of world 12 and a corresponding increase indensity as we pass further down through worlds 24, 48, and 96. We thus haveseven different orders of “materiality” in the universe. Our ordinary concept ofone order, said Gurdjieff, just about embraces the materiality of worlds 96 and48. The substance of world 24, he said, is almost too metaphysical to beidentified through ordinary scientific method; and the even more rarefiedsubstances of worlds 12, 6, 3, and 1, have, to all intents and purposes, noidentifiable material characteristics.It is interesting to note here that in the early 1900s when Gurdjieff was givinghis lectures, the conventional atom was still the smallest “particle” of matterknown to science. But while Gurdjieff was speaking of these still finersubstances permeating the material world, Ernest Rutherford was discovering thenucleus of the atom, Einstein was attempting to show that photons wereparticles, and Max Planck was in the process of formulating his idea thatelectromagnetic radiation was emitted by energetic sources in discrete,symmetrical packages called quanta. Later discoveries, such as the existence ofneutrons and electrons within the atom, and of quarks literally everywhere, allserved to reinforce Gurdjieff’s idea that there are finer substances andvibrations permeating the coarser ones. Nowadays, of course, even individualquanta, the tiniest “particles” known to science, are also described asephemeral, wavelike entities, suggesting the existence of a finer, more rarefiedmanifestation of “materiality” than even the most minuscule, pointlike quantum.Clearly the claim that all matter everywhere is actually composed of thefundamental and indivisible particles of the Absolute world has no arguablescientific basis. As Gurdjieff himself said, the substances of the higher worldshave no recognizable or measurable material characteristics. On the possiblenature of such materiality, however, we can speculate at least as far as worldorder 3 (dimension six in the hierarchy), the world of “all worlds.”Beginning with the lowest world order in the ray of creation, the moon, or world96 (an order of materiality that would also incorporate the interior of planetEarth), we can say that the matter of this world would probably consist for themost part of the heavy transition metals and all the superdense radioactiveelements.The next world order in the ascending scale, represented in the ray of creationby our own planet and its atmosphere (world order 48), would incorporate mattercomprising atoms of the lighter chemical elements, ending with hydrogen, theleast dense of them all. Accordingly the matter of the world of “all planets,”world 24, might consist primarily of subatomic particles. Beneath the“particle,” be it photon, electron, or whatever, lies the even more rarefiedwave-mode vibration. Let’s say that this wave aspect of subatomic quantarepresents the nature of the materiality of world order 12, the world of oursun.We have now come to the outer limits of scientific knowledge. On the realitybeyond the wave we can only speculate. Hermetic theory tells us that even finervibrations exist within these waves. Possibly, therefore, the next order ofmateriality, that of world order 6, “all suns,” is consciousness itself, the“substance” from which, as I suggested in an earlier chapter, all solar helicesare constructed. The materiality of the next world order—the scale of thegalactic helix—might be defined as a form of superconsciousness (ordinaryconsciousness squared, as it were), a substance that, if it exists, must be sorarefied that it must forever remain hypothetical. Finally, the materiality ofthe primordial “atoms” of the Absolute world order, as we might expect, defiesall expression.We now come to the concept of inner octaves. According to Gurdjieff, each noteof any given octave can be regarded as a complete octave on another plane.Similarly, each note of these inner octaves is also a complete octave in anotherscale—and so on, but not ad infinitum, because there is a definite limit to thedevelopment of inner octaves (just as there is a definite limit to the hierarchyof dimensions and the ray of creation). These inner vibrations, said Gurdjieff,proceed simultaneously in media of different densities, continuallyinterpenetrating and interacting with one another. In a substance or mediumconsisting of, for example, the superdense atoms of world order 96, each ofwhich is a composite of 96 primordial “particles,” the vibrations oroscillations active within this medium are divisible into octaves, which are inturn divisible into notes. The medium of world order 96, like a solid piece ofwood saturated with water, is also saturated with the substance of world order48. Now, the vibrations subsisting in the matter of world order 48 stand in adefinite relation to the vibrations in the substance of world order 96; each“note” of the vibrations of world 96 contains a whole octave of vibrations inthe medium of world 48. These inner octaves, said Gurdjieff, proceed inward tothe very heart of all matter. The substance of world order 48 is in turnsaturated with the substance of world order 24, so that each “note” in thevibrations of world 48 again contains a whole octave of the vibrations of world24—and so on through to the final phase, where the substance of world order 3 ispermeated with the substance of world order 1, with each note in the vibrationsof world 3 containing a whole octave of the vibrations of the world of theAbsolute.As I mentioned before, Gurdjieff always claimed that the original teachings fromwhich his ideas were drawn—including the above description of inneroctaves—dated back to very remote times. How far back this teaching actuallydoes go is currently the subject of much heated debate among alternativetheorists and orthodox historians, but it was very much alive in Old KingdomEgypt, as we know from the previously discussed Magic Square of Hermes and itsassociate number, 2,080, the sum of all the factors from 1 to 64. Obviously 64is the key. The Greeks, as we know, associated the Magic Square with the GreatPyramid, “The Lights.” And light, of course, is an octave of resonance, composedof eight fundamental “notes.” According to Gurdjieff, each of these fundamentalnotes in an octave of ordinary light would contain a whole octave of notes fromthe scale or world above. As we see, this very principle is precisely encoded inthe Magic Square.Gurdjieff claimed that “objective music” (by which he meant the kind played bysuch as Joshua and the builders of the Egyptian and Orphic schools, whichallegedly could move mountains of stone) was all based on these inner octaves.Ordinary music, he said, cannot be used to reconstitute matter, destroy, orbuild up great walls of stone, but objective music can.The music being referred to here is, I believe, fundamentally psychologicalmusic, the music of the mind, the music described by the Hermetic Code and the IChing, by the Greek and Egyptian mysteries, and, indeed, by the establishedprinciples of all major religious disciplines. In Egypt, this “religion,” themaking of “celestial music,” was known as “writing,” the sacred art invented byHermes/Thoth, the art of striking harmonious metaphysical “notes,” or thoughtpatterns, up into the stellar scale of existence, into the “heavenly” worldinhabited by the gods. We must assume here that this does not mean “writing” inthe ordinary sense.So let us just imagine for a moment that the mind were conscious to the degreethat it could generate higher vibrations—inner octaves— that were in tune withsolar helices, world order 12 in Gurdjieff’s ray of creation.As I have suggested, this level of materiality would be as fine and aspenetrating as the ghostlike wave mode of subatomic quanta, reaching, as itwere, beyond the particle itself into the very heart of the electron. It is nottoo difficult to imagine some kind of process whereby such vibrations, if theycould be concentrated or focused to a sufficient degree of intensity, couldindeed have dramatic psychic and physical consequences. Theoretically suchrarefied “substances” could actually enter into objects—even blocks of thehardest stone—and affect them from within.No doubt most orthodox scholars will regard such a notion as entirely fanciful,but not, I would hope, all of them. Times are changing, and scientists are todayhaving to rely as much on intuition and instinct as they are on logicalcognition in their attempts to come to terms with the baffling nonlocal natureof the multidimensional universe. We might optimistically view this scientificventure beyond the empirical world out into the metaphysical realm of concepts,thought patterns, and vibrations, as evidence of evolution of the transcendentalkind, the beginning of mankind’s next momentous journey—to the stars. If this isso, then the rationalist, whether knowingly or unknowingly, may now becontributing actively toward this ultimate flowering of human consciousness.Take the ideas of David Bohm, for example, the “orthodox” scientist mentioned inchapter 4 [12_chapter04.html], whose investigations into plasmas led him toconclude that the electron is a “mindlike” entity. We may recall that he feltinstinctively that the “plasmon”—the electron sea—was alive, with billions ofindividual electrons simultaneously engaging in a mass, instantaneouslycoordinated action. This implies that electrons are somehow able under certainconditions to “connect” with every other electron, and Bohm recognized that thenonlocal nature of interactive quanta could account for this kind ofsynchronized activity.Impressed by the evidence for nonlocality, Bohm went on to develop what at firstappears to be a revolutionary new view of the universe. He suggested that thewhole of reality was like a living hologram, a “holomovement,” and that what wesee through ordinary methods of investigation is something like a frozenholographic image, behind which lies a much deeper and more meaningful level ofreality. Now this idea may be new to science, but it is revolutionary only inthe sense that it has turned full circle: it has been held before. In fact, this“holographic principle,” as we shall see, is basically an updated scientificdescription of the mechanism of inner octaves and of the principles of musicaltheory."},{"pageContent":"13The Holographic PrincipleMost readers will know that a hologram is a three-dimensional image sculptedfrom a concentrated beam of light. The thing that makes this possible is thewave-mechanics phenomenon known as interference. We came across this in chapter4 [12_chapter04.html], where we discussed the Thomas Young experiment, in whichwaves of light passing through twin slits in a partition overlapped andreinforced one another, producing an interference pattern on a dark backdrop.In the same way, a laser, which is a very pure form of light, can be used tocreate extremely well-defined interference patterns. The hologram is produced bysplitting a single, concentrated beam of light into two. One beam is thenreflected off the object being photographed and the second beam is directed atan angle toward the reflected light of the first. The interference patterncreated by the two beams is then recorded on film. The image on the filmactually bears no resemblance to the hologram it projects, however. Only whenanother beam of light is shone through it does the hologram appear.Impressive as these images can be, the most interesting aspect of holographyconcerns the film itself, which possesses rather unusual properties. Let’s saywe have a piece of holographic film on which a certain image has been recorded.It can be any image you like. If you were to cut this piece of film in half andshine a laser light through any one of the two pieces, you would find that eachseparate piece would still contain the whole image. Even if you cut each halfinto quarters, eighths, and so on, each diminishing piece, when illuminated bylaser, will still project a complete image of the object in focus, albeitbecoming progressively less distinct as the pieces get smaller. So every smallsegment of a piece of holographic film contains all the information contained inthe uncut whole. This is the holographic principle.In Bohm’s view, the physical world we see all around us is just like aholographic image, basically an illusion, a kind of external tapestry ofsubjective impressions composed of waves and interference patterns. Beneaththese tangible physical forms, he suggested, lies a deeper, “implicate” order ofreality, in which everything exists in what he called its “enfolded” form.Therefore what we see as physical phenomena are simply the explicate or unfoldedprojections from this deeper, implicate, enfolded order.In fact, this view of two fundamental orders of existence—i.e., of the “image”and the “film,” or the explicate and the implicate—has exact parallels innumerous esoteric traditions. For example, Buddhists call the material world thesphere of the nonvoid. This is the normal world of sense-objects, the explicate,unfolded dimension—the dimension in which the “holographic” image manifests. Thereal world, existing beyond the nonvoid, is the void, the dimension in which the“film” itself exists, the implicate, enfolded realm, the progenitor of everything, every “image” in the visible universe.Michael Talbot, author of The Holographic Universe, which provides a generalsummary of Bohm’s ideas, quotes the Tibetan scholar John Blofeld speaking on thenature of the two domains. Blofeld’s worldview, as we see, is strikingly similarto Gurdjieff’s: “In a universe thus composed, everything interpenetrates, and isinterpenetrated by, everything else; as with the void, so with the nonvoid—thepart is the whole.”1 [26_note.html#fo131]A similar Hindu version of cosmic events mentioned previously describes themotion of the universe as cyclical—an endlessly unfolding and enfolding process,with each cycle lasting “a day and a night of Brahma.” It is perhaps worthnoting here that the Hindu creation myth says that twenty-four “Brahman hours”are equivalent to 4,320,000,000 of our years, while four, three, and two,followed by seven zeros is a perfect description of the evolutionary developmentof the Pythagorean Tetrad, which Pythagoras himself, remember, referred to as“the model of the gods.”So the visible universe is created by Brahma. Brahma is one of the three majorgods of the Hindu “trimurti,” which itself, like all religious “trinities,” isprimarily an expression of the first law of nature, the law of three forces.Brahma therefore represents the first, active force in the process of triplecreation, a force that originates in the implicate realm. From Brahma,everything enfolded subsequently unfolds, like a holographic image, into theexplicate dimension. At the end of the “day” the world is “destroyed,” orabsorbed, by the god Shiva, the passive or negative force, which, in Bohm’sterms, means that the unfolded again enfolds, from the explicate back into theimplicate dimension, after which it completely disappears into the body of thethird god, Vishnu, the omnipresent neutral force, the great cosmic mediator.Vishnu then sleeps for a “night” in the sphere of “non-existence,” which Hindusdescribe as the dimension of endless time, and then gives birth to Brahma again.A new “day” unfolds, and the process endlessly repeats itself. Vishnu’s role inthis cosmic episode thus implies that there is an even deeper level of realitybeyond the implicate realm, what Bohm himself referred to as a kind of“ultra-implicate” reality.We have, of course, already visited this rather special place; it is number 6 inthe hierarchy of dimensions, the dimension existing beyond the fifth, the planeof light—what I have referred to as the “solid” form of the ultimate reality,the sphere of true “nonlocality.” In Gurdjieff’s “ray of creation,” this wouldbe world order 3 in the descending scale.Like the Hindu description of the universal process, Bohm’s takes into accountthe fact that things are never static. He saw the whole phenomenon as in motion,hence his use of the term holomovement, which was meant to include not only theevolving universe but also, crucially, the consciousness of the observer. Sowhen we see things through Bohm’s eyes, we are not merely looking at theever-changing hologram, we are an integral part of it.Let us now consider the holographic principle itself, the fact that every smallsegment of a holographic film contains all the information in the uncut whole.Bohm’s hypothesis implies that we as individuals, each an intrinsic part of theentire holomovement, must also, just like a segment of a holographic film,contain within us a complete “picture” of the greater reality.This, of course, is precisely the reality Gurdjieff described decades before inhis discourses on inner octaves. He said that if one understands the lawsgoverning the creation of inner octaves, it is possible, from observations madein just one scale, to obtain the measurements of any other scale, because theyare all in a definite relationship to one another. Therefore there is no need tostudy the sun, for example, in order to discover the nature of the “matter” ofthe solar world, because this same order of materiality exists in ourselves. Inthe same way we have in us the “matter” of all scales, for man is in the fullsense of the term, a “miniature universe”; in him are all the matters of whichthe universe consists; the same forces, the same laws that govern the life ofthe universe, operate in him; therefore in studying man we can study the wholeworld, just as in studying the world we can study man.2 [26_note.html#fo132]Moses expressed the same idea more succinctly: “for in the image of God made heman.”3 [26_note.html#fo133] And again, the holographic principle—the wholeexisting in every part—can also be understood in terms of the basic rules ofordinary musical theory. Each tone, semitone, quarter tone, and the like of amajor scale contains within it all the information necessary to recreate theentire scale. That is, to determine the frequencies of all the sounds comprisinga harmonic scale or octave, it is sufficient to fix the frequency of just one ofthem.So the holographic principle, like so many other scientific discoveriesdiscussed in this book, is not an entirely new concept. It is simply a variationon one aspect of a very old theme, the essence of which is encoded in theHermetic Code and in the number 64. Sixty-four is the key to the inner octave,the mechanism through or by which, said Gurdjieff, all scales of existence areconnected and proportionately interrelated.The holographic model of the universe raises intriguing questions in the spheresof psychology and parapsychology.First, we now have neurophysiological evidence to suggest that the brain itselfmay have holographic properties, in the sense that such functions as vision andmemory are distributed evenly throughout its structure. If true, this would besignificant in serving to reinforce Bohm’s idea that we are all part of animmense hologram in motion, a holomovement, and also Gurdjieff’s assertion thatwe are exact replicas of the greater whole. Obviously, if the greater whole isby nature holographic, a holographic brain would be precisely what, inGurdjieff’s worldview, is required.The holographic model also has possible parapsychological implications. Forexample, in an attempt to explain how psychokinesis might work—anuncharacteristically bold move for a mainstream scientist— Bohm cited the“ultra-implicate” dimension as the most likely source of such forces. This wouldbe dimension six in the ascending hierarchy. The implicate dimension of Bohm’svision of reality would therefore correspond to the fifth, the nonlocal plane oflight, with the explicate sphere—dimension four—corresponding with the line oftime, expressed hermetically in Hindu myth as a period of 4,320,000,000 years.So, like Gurdjieff, the Greeks, and the Egyptians, Bohm believed that the humanmind could in fact access this higher dimension—the ultra-implicate,six-dimensional abode of Vishnu—and through it directly influence the physicalworld.We are now back to the idea discussed in chapter 3 [11_chapter03.html], in whichwe considered the possibility that the ancient builders of the firstcivilizations might have moved their giant blocks of stone using some kind ofpsychic assistance.Mind over matter? Admittedly the proposition sounds fantastic, but then so didthe prospect of men on the moon little over a decade before it became a reality.Indications are that the next stop could be Mars or possibly one of the moons ofJupiter—a much greater feat than a hop to the moon, but few people today doubtthat this kind of enterprise is within our capabilities. Of course thedevelopmental leap from my mind or yours to one capable of defying the knownlaws of physics would be massive indeed. And yet the myths, the yogi masters,Gurdjieff, and latterly David Bohm all speak of such powers being accessible tothe human being. Gurdjieff and Schwaller de Lubicz, as we noted, both believedthat such powers were common currency in the ancient world and that somewherealong the trail of time our ancestors somehow lost the understanding of how touse these powers. Whether such a “Golden Age” actually existed or not, in lightof the archaeological evidence we have discussed, where blocks of stone weighingfrom two hundred to twelve hundred tons have been carved, transported for miles,and then perfectly placed and oriented to form massive symbolic structures, Ipersonally believe that ruling out some kind of hitherto unrecognized psychic orpsychological factor in the lives and works of these ancient peoples would beinjudicious.As we have seen, the idea of mind—or “music”—over matter is as old ascivilization itself, having originated with the men-gods of mythology. We notedGraham Hancock’s observation of certain Native American myths that tell us thatmusic—whistling, the playing of trumpets—caused heavy blocks of stone to floatthrough the air like feathers in a breeze. Exactly the same kind of storiesappeared in ancient Greece, recounting the exploits of such as Orpheus, son ofthe god Apollo and the muse Calliope, whose playing of the lyre “enchanted thetrees and rocks and tamed wild beasts.”4 [26_note.html#fo134]Another hero was the “builder god” Amphion, son of Zeus and King of Thebes, alsoa musician, who single-handedly built the walls of his great city. So clearly,as Gurdjieff always maintained, music of some sort is the key to the techniquesused by these people. He further stated that such music involved the use ofinner octaves, an all-pervading symmetry of composition that, he said, permeateseverything, both man and the universe. Possibly there was real music involved inthe procedure, or at least sound vibrations, as in case of the Tibetandemonstration described in chapter 3 [11_chapter03.html], which allegedlyinvolved the use of numerous drums and trumpets. But in addition there may havebeen some form of psychological accompaniment, and it is here, one suspects,that Gurdjieff’s inner octaves would come into play. Inner octaves or “highervibrations,” according to Gurdjieff’s view, can be accessed only by a fullyconscious mind; they correspond to an extremely high degree of “psychologicalresonance,” a unique condition of existence, apparently attainable by ancientman, now surviving only as a potential faculty in the form of a lingering memoryenshrouded in myth.Scientists in general have a natural tendency to react negatively when they heartalk of “vibrations,” particularly when what is being alluded to is animmeasurable commodity. And yet, consciousness itself, whatever else it may be,can reasonably be considered as a form of resonance. We can’t measure theseinvisible forms of resonance directly, but we are, nevertheless, acutely awareof their puzzling existence in a world as yet barely half understood. Certainaspects of the rational side of consciousness, such as IQ, intellectualargument, ideas, theories, and so on, can be roughly appraised, but the natureof other aspects of the mind, such as its power to intuit, remain tantalizinglybeyond our understanding. So, if what we might call rational consciousness canbe conceived of as a form of energy manifesting in varying “degrees ofresonance,” then a faculty such as intuition, which clearly transcends alllogical thought processes, must function with even finer “vibrations,” that iswith higher degrees of psychological or psychic resonance.The same might be said of memory, a faculty that enables us to pick out afamiliar face in a crowd even though thirty years might have ravaged it sincelast we saw it. It is invariably a very different face, and yet it is the sameone, and the brain can somehow recognize this, it can decode highly complex,personal information that no computer could ever handle; it can “filter away”the lines and the scars, the changing hues, and all the rest of the camouflageof the years and simultaneously “see” the original face with pristine clarity.This faculty is so familiar to us that we barely give it a second thought, andyet it really is quite remarkable, way beyond the reach of modern technology.But it is also much more mercurial in nature than ordinary thought processes,such as the ponderous form of logical cognition required to write a page of abook like this.Unlike intuition, memory can, in fact, be experimentally observed, and importantnew neurophysiological research now suggests that the brain cells or whateverelse is responsible for this extraordinary faculty are not housed in anyparticular region of the brain, but are distributed evenly throughout itsstructure. This suggests that memory at least, one of the primary functions ofthe brain, is a manifestation of the holographic principle, the principle ofinner octaves, where the whole exists in every part."},{"pageContent":"14Quantum PsychologyThe “Nonlocal” BrainThe idea that the brain functions on some kind of internal holographic principlewas first suggested by a Stanford University neurophysiologist named KarlPribram. Pribram was initially concerned with memory, how it works, and how thebrain manages to store it. At the time he began his research, well over fiftyyears ago, it was thought that memories were localized inside the brain in theform of imprints known as engrams, chemical codices thought to be housed withinspecialized brain cells or biomolecules.Up to the present, engrams remain only hypothetical entities: none have beenidentified or located, and Pribram began to doubt their very existence duringhis 1940s work with the neurophysiologist Karl Lashley at the Yerkes Laboratoryof Biology in Florida. At that time Lashley was experimenting with rats trainedto perform various tasks, like finding their way through a maze. He attempted tocut out the region of the rats’ brains in which the memory of their learnedskills was thought to be encoded, but he found that no matter what section ofthe brain he surgically removed, the rats still retained their memories. Even iftheir motor functions were chronically affected, they still managed to negotiatethe mazes successfully and find their way to the larder.From these findings, Pribram concluded that memories were not localized inspecific areas, but were somehow distributed throughout the entire brain. Hepuzzled over this for many years, wondering how the brain could store memoriesintact throughout its whole structure. So the construction of the first hologramhad a great impact on him, because it seemed that the process of holography,which results in an image of the whole existing in every part of the film,provided a plausible explanation of the nonlocal nature of memory.Further experimental evidence in support of Pribram’s ideas resulted from thework of Paul Pietsch, a biologist researching at the University of Indiana.Pietsch’s work involved somewhat macabre experiments, primarily on salamanders.He found that he could extract a salamander’s brain without killing it, leavingthe creature in a torpid state; when he replaced the brain, the salamander’sphysical functioning quickly returned to normal. In a subsequent series ofseveral hundred operations, he systematically chopped and removed differentparts of the hapless creatures’ brains, shuffling the right and lefthemispheres, turning them upside down, back to front, even mincing them. Butwhen he replaced what was left, he was astonished to find that their behavioralways returned to near normal.Skeptical at first of Pribram’s claim that memories are not focused on specificbrain sites, Pietsch ultimately concluded that this must be so, otherwise aminced brain would surely result in a correspondingly uncoordinated series ofequally “minced” motor functions. The fact that this clearly was not the caseled Pietsch to the opinion that Pribram was right after all: that theholographic model currently provides the best explanation for such an otherwiseinexplicable property of the brain.Pribram found further evidence to support this theory in another of KarlLashley’s discoveries, made during his experiments with rats, which indicatedthat vision might also be holographic. Lashley found that even after majorsurgical plundering, the nerve complexes controlling vision could still functionnormally. As much as 90 percent of the visual cortex could be extracted, yet therats persistently retained their visual powers. It was subsequently discoveredthat the same was the case with a cat’s optic nerve, 98 percent of which couldbe severed without seriously affecting its vision.Previously it had been assumed that there was an exact correspondence betweenthe images seen by the eye and the resultant pattern of electrical activitytaking place in the visual cortex: that is, if you looked at a certain physicalshape, the same image would be projected onto the surface of the cortex, like aphotographic imprint. To find out if this was the case, Pribram conducted aseries of experiments to locate and measure the electrochemical reactions in thebrains of monkeys as they carried out a number of visually centered activities.He could find no identifiable pattern in the distribution of electricalactivity, so it was evident that the visual cortex was not operating on aone-to-one basis with the image it recorded. This fact, together with thestrange ability to continue functioning relatively normally even after drasticsurgical excision, led Pribram to conclude that vision, like memory, isdistributed evenly throughout the brain, which processes visual informationusing some kind of internal holographic principle. This would explain why even asmall segment of the visual cortex is still able to construct everything the eyesees. As Michael Talbot points out in The Holographic Universe, the interferencepatterns on a piece of holographic film bear no discernible relationship to theimages encoded on it. If the visual cortex were similarly functioningholographically, this could account for the fact that there is no one-to-onecorrespondence between the image seen and the pattern of electrical impulsesactivated on the surface of the brain.Pribram believes that the brain could be using wave patterns to create theseinternal “holograms.” Active brain cells (neurons) radiate electrical impulsesfrom the multiple ends of their branchlike antennae, which expand outward likeripples in a pond. Electricity is in essence a wavelike phenomenon; therefore,as the impulses spread throughout the brain, they must be creating an overallweb of interpenetrating waves and interference patterns. In Pribram’s view, itis this wavelike interconnectedness that gives the brain its holographicproperties.Now, according to Bohm, the observer and the observed—the holographic mind andthe holographic universe—should in no way be considered as separate entities,but more as interacting coordinates of the self-same “holomovement.” This inturn implies that some kind of connecting principle exists between the two, andthe terms that are now most frequently used to account for this possiblefunction are: vibrations, resonance, waves, and interference patterns—all words,in fact, that are used to describe events in the nonlocal world of the quantumphysicist. It is for this reason, and not because it is fashionable, that I usethe term quantum to describe the kind of psychology that might be involved inconnecting with the greater whole. And as we have noted, this nonlocal realityis strikingly similar to the world described by Gurdjieff, a greater sphere inwhich everything is seen as being inter-connected through the “holographic”mechanism of inner octaves. This is also, as I suggested in earlier chapters,the “eternal” world—the Duat—of the ancient Egyptians, who regarded thephenomenon of light, the prime mover in the nonlocal, quantum world, as sacred,as an octave of resonance, each note of which is composed within as an octave,giving sixty-four interpenetrating “notes.” Clearly, therefore, this notion ofinterpenetrating vibrations, intrinsic to the world of the quantum physicist, isone of the oldest testaments on Earth.Bohm was obviously not what we might call a run-of-the-mill physicist. To beginwith, practically alone among his peers, he was quite prepared to tackle theprickly subject of psychokinesis, “mind over matter,” a proposition that hasbeen a complete anathema to most scientists ever since Newton discovered whatwere long considered to be inviolable laws, the fundamental physical laws ofmotion and gravitation. Basically Bohm believed that psychokinesis might resultdirectly from the essential common feature of both consciousness and thefundamental wave/particles of matter: an underlying “awareness” of certaininformation relating to the world at large. Like you, electrons and photons havethe ability to respond to meaning, or to make positive use of external data.Bohm likened the process in the microworld to that of a ship on automatic pilot,where the radarlike wave function of the electron, for example, provides theparticle aspect—the “ship”—with information about its environment. Theimplication is that the frequencies at which the “radar” works can be tuned intoby the mind; that, in effect, the mental processes of one or more people couldpossibly be focused on frequencies of resonance that are in concert with thegenerative vibrations controlling material systems. By their very nature, suchprocesses would involve forces other than those currently known to physics. Theywould arise as a result of what Michael Talbot calls a nonlocal resonance ofmeanings, a kind of interdimensional alchemical dialogue between mind andmatter—something like the nonlocal alchemy taking place between correlatedphotons, or electrons in plasmas, but possibly involving resonances of a muchhigher or finer frequency. Therefore, in order to accommodate psychokinesis andperhaps other inexplicable phenomena such as telepathy, precognition, and so on,“ordinary” nonlocality must be superseded by what Talbot calls a “supernon-locality”1 [26_note.html#fo141]—which in Hindu terms might be described asthe unknowable process operating in the hidden world of the Great MediatorVishnu, described as the sphere of “endless time.” This would be Bohm’s“ultra-implicate” sphere, our sixth dimension.We noted previously that Gurdjieff regarded the processes involved inpsychokinesis in much the same way, that is, as the result of a mutuallyinteracting resonance between mind and matter. But he was much more explicitthan Bohm, for not only does he provide us with a mechanism for such interaction(the inner octave), by the very nature of the octave itself he further presentsan entirely cohesive worldview expressed in terms of exact musical symmetriesand proportions. And, according to Gurdjieff, these same symmetries andproportions are present in man because the individual is, in effect, a“miniature universe,” what Bohm might call a holographic imprint of the deeper,ultra-implicate reality. Gurdjieff, however, then qualified this comparison bystating that a complete parallel between man and the world can only be drawn ifwe take man in the full sense of the word: “that is, a man whose inherent powersare fully developed. An undeveloped man, a man who has not completed the courseof his evolution, cannot be taken as a complete picture or plan of theuniverse—he is an unfinished world.”2 [26_note.html#fo142]In quantum terms we might say that such an individual has not yet acquired anonlocal condition of “optimum psychological resonance” and so is unable toproject psychokinesis influences out into the hierarchy of dimensions at a highenough or deep enough level. “Height” and “depth” are each seen in this contextas properties of the greater, nonlocal reality, in the sense that the higher orfiner vibrations—the inner octaves described by Gurdjieff and embodied in theMagic Square of Egyptian and Greek metaphysics—penetrate deep into the heart ofeverything.For me, the most important aspect of “Gurdjieff’s system” (he would never claimit as his own) is the way the individual’s place in the cosmic scheme of thingsis so clearly defined. It seems that we all have a place in this worldview. Inour case, this “place” is presently the planet of our origins. Significantly,however, Gurdjieff’s system also provides us all with a purpose in life, onethat offers a way of striking out into deepest space and enhancing the verypresence of the planet on which we were born. Our raison d’être, he said, is toevolve, to develop and expand our consciousness to the degrees of resonance atwhich it can encompass these higher dimensions, way beyond the scale of planetEarth and the solar system, and even the galaxy. Of course, as I have suggestedseveral times, the fact that this system is based, like DNA and the geneticcode, on musical principles and symmetries means that this kind of “spiritual”growth—the development of human consciousness from the scale of its origins upto a greater scale above—is, like all creative processes, fundamentally anorganic mode of evolution.Gurdjieff said that ordinary “socialized” human beings are little more thancomplex machines, automata, living under the forty-eight orders of lawsgoverning life on Earth (world order 48 in the “ray of creation”), constantlyreacting, mostly involuntarily, to external stimuli. The laws and forcesgoverning each of the worlds in the ray of creation, he said, are entirelymechanical, manifesting and interacting strictly according to the law of triplecreation. So the evolution of the human psyche, or the development of what yogisand mystics call “cosmic consciousness,” is seen here as a metaphysical journeyup through the higher worlds and dimensions, at each stage of which theindividual frees him or herself from a certain and definite number of theprevailing laws and forces of the particular world order in which they exist.For example, according to Gurdjieff, we on Earth are separated from the“Absolute,” or the ultimate scale, by forty-eight mechanical laws. If we couldfree ourselves from one half of these laws we would be one stage nearer to theAbsolute scale of existence and subject only to the twenty-four laws governingthe next world order—the overall planetary sphere. Again, freeing ourselves fromhalf of these laws would gain us access to the next world, the sphere of the sunor the solar system, where we would be subject to only twelve mechanicallaws—and so on, with six laws controlling the world of “all suns,” that is allsolar helices, and three laws, three fundamental forces, controlling the greaterworld of the galactic helix.This familiar description of the natural process of transcendental evolutionembodies the essence of Gurdjieff’s system of self-development, which wasdesigned specifically to assist his students in systematically freeingthemselves from these mechanical laws. No “miracle,” he said (by which he meantpsychokinesis, telepathy, and so forth) occurs as a result of the violation ofthese laws; a miracle can only be a manifestation of the laws and forces of ahigher world.Obviously the scientific community in general is opposed to the idea that themind can engage in paranormal activities: it requires evidence that ismeasurable in some way. Shamans, yogis, mystics, and teachers of esotericwisdom, however, do not. They appear to “measure” things, phenomena, experiencesin a very different way from the modern scientist; that is, they assess andcomprehend nature not only logically, with their minds, but holistically, thatis with their whole being.Ouspensky recognized the difficulty in observing the paranormal by purelyscientific means after a period during which he experienced a number oftelepathic encounters with Gurdjieff. These occurred during and after a fieldtrip to Finland with Gurdjieff and a small group of his students a short timebefore the Bolshevik uprising. Just prior to this, Ouspensky had been takingpart in a series of rigorous mental exercises and short but intensive fasts,which induced in him an unusually excited and nervous state.One evening Gurdjieff called Ouspensky and two others to sit with him in a smallroom of the country house in which they were staying. Gurdjieff proceeded toshow them some physical movements and postures, after which he gave them a brieftalk on certain matters recently under discussion. It was at this point thatOuspensky had an experience he would never forget.It all started with him beginning to hear Gurdjieff’s thoughts. He said thatGurdjieff was talking to those present in the normal way, when suddenly henoticed that among the words Gurdjieff was saying were separate “thoughts” thatwere intended for him alone: “After a while I heard his voice inside me as if itwere in the chest near the heart. He put a definite question to me. I looked athim; he was sitting and smiling. His question provoked in me a very strongemotion. But I answered him in the affirmative.”3 [26_note.html#fo143]To the obvious astonishment of the other two present, this intermittent“conversation” lasted for about half an hour, with Gurdjieff posing questionssilently and Ouspensky replying in his natural voice. The substance of thisdialogue Ouspensky declines to detail, but it seems that the questions posed byGurdjieff were very difficult and sometimes of an extremely personal nature.Eventually Ouspensky became so agitated and disturbed by the proceedings that hehurried out of the room and escaped into the surrounding forest to try to gatherhis thoughts.When he returned to the house it was dark. Unaware that Gurdjieff and the otherswere having supper on the veranda and thinking everyone had retired for theevening, he went to bed. But then, after a while, he began to feel a strangeexcitement and his pulse began to beat forcibly. At this point he once againheard Gurdjieff’s voice inside his chest. This time, however, he was able toreply to the question mentally and it seems that Gurdjieff “heard” andresponded.Much to Ouspensky’s obvious discomfort, this extraordinary state of affairscontinued for several days. Eventually the group traveled back from Finland toSt. Petersburg and then met at the main railway station to see Gurdjieff off ona train bound for Moscow. Ouspensky then reports, “But the miraculous was stillfar from ended. There were new and very strange phenomena again late in theevening of that day and I “conversed” with him while seeing him in thecompartment of the train going to Moscow.”4 [26_note.html#fo144]You can make of this what you will. Ouspensky, as he reports in his book,experienced other unusual states of awareness at this time, some of which, as hehimself admits, he may have imagined. But when speaking of these extremely lucidtelepathic encounters with Gurdjieff, his account is quite precise andunequivocal. As far as Ouspensky was concerned, he was communicating withGurdjieff through an entirely different and much more efficient mode oftransmission than ordinary vocal means.So, if telepathy is a reality, how does it work? The answer currently on offeris, of course, “waves and interference patterns,” though of a kind far removedfrom the wavelike form of subatomic quanta, of interactive electrons, packets oflight, and all the other subatomic paraphernalia currently haunting the nonlocalworld of local scientists.The problem, as Ouspensky saw it, is that “metaphysical” phenomena cannot beinvestigated by ordinary methods:It is a complete absurdity to think that it is possible to study phenomena of ahigher order like “telepathy,” “clairvoyance,” foreseeing the future,mediumistic phenomena and so on, in the same way as electrical, chemical, ormeteorological phenomena are studied. There is something in phenomena of ahigher order which requires a particular emotional state for their observationand study. And this excludes any possibility of “properly conducted” laboratoryexperiments and observations.5 [26_note.html#fo145]As we shall see, the reference here to the emotional state of the investigatorhas a significant place in Gurdjieff’s interpretation of the theory oftranscendental evolution. The point to note here is that the paranormal aspectsof the human psyche described above were considered by Ouspensky, a scholarlyand rather stoic Russian intellectual, as phenomena deserving of study, that ishe believed them to exist.Probably very few of us living in the modern world will ever experience orwitness real paranormal happenings. But of course, we all inhabit apredominantly secular, “socialized” environment controlled outwardly bylegislation and underpinned by an economic substructure whose material demandsupon us leave little time for voyages “into the mystic.” This does not mean, ofcourse, that the mystic is simply a figment of mankind’s collective imagination.In fact, as Michael Talbot points out in his book The Holographic Universe, theevidence for paranormal psychic abilities as manifested through thousands ofindividuals in history is too compelling not be taken seriously. The number ofserious researchers who believe that the holographic model can explain virtuallyall such phenomena is growing steadily.The psychiatric researcher Dr. Stanislav Grof, for example, who spent severalyears studying the effects of LSD on thousands of volunteers, believes that theessential features of “transpersonal experiences” (“trips”), such as thesensation that there are no boundaries, no separate, unconnected elements, nodistinction between parts and the whole, are all details one would observe in aholographic universe. He also thinks that the enfolded nature of space and timein the implicate realm is responsible for the feeling of timelessnessexperienced by so many of his volunteers. Unusual states of consciousness, hebelieves, can penetrate through to the implicate, enfolded order of things andmodify phenomena in the physical world—the “images”—by “influencing theirgenerative matrix.”6 [26_note.html#fo146] Grof is saying, in effect, that themind, as well as being capable of moving objects through psychokinesis, mayalso, under the right circumstances, be capable of influencing the source ofthese phenomenal images—what Talbot calls the “cosmic motion pictureprojector”—and so remodel the material world into any desired shape or form.LSD—lysergic acid diethylamide—was discovered quite by accident in the late1950s in Switzerland, synthesized from a fungus that forms on rye grain. Itseffects on the human psyche were subsequently realized and explored extensivelyby the psychedelic generation of the 1960s.Several decades prior to this, Ouspensky was also undergoing some veryinteresting “transpersonal experiences” of his own, induced by some other formof mind-altering agent, possibly nitrous oxide, or “laughing gas.” In thecontext of our investigation into the nonlocal world of the quantumpsychologist, his recollections of those experiences are highly significant.This is what he has to say about these experiences in his book A New Model ofthe Universe: “The new world with which one comes into contact has no sides, sothat it is impossible to describe first one side and then the other. All of itis visible at every point, but how in fact to describe anything in theseconditions—that question I could not answer.”7 [26_note.html#fo147]Clearly this description is very similar to the observations made by Grof’svolunteers, of a nonlocal world in which there are no boundaries, nodistinctions between parts and the whole, and everything is wholly visible fromany point of reference.As Ouspensky discovered, the problem with short cuts like psychedelic excursionsis that they are very intense and sometimes traumatic— so much so that theunprepared mind is often incapable of remembering even the essence of itsexperience, let alone competently recording it. Ouspensky himself said thatduring these states of altered awareness he found it impossible to finish asimple sentence because, between words, so many relevant and interconnectedimpressions came to him that he simply couldn’t keep track of events in thenormal way: “. . . and these new and unexpected experiences came upon me andflashed by so quickly, that I could not find words, could not find forms ofspeech, could not find concepts, which would enable me to remember what hadoccurred even for myself, still less to convey it to anyone else.”8[26_note.html#fo148]Obviously these kinds of chemically induced perceptions of different realitiesare of limited value. They are stolen glimpses, so to speak, taken for the mostpart by people whose mental powers are not sufficiently developed and whoseunderstanding is consequently limited. Possibly this is why subjects under theinfluence of psychedelics are invariably rendered speechless, unable to describeeven a small part of their experience. Indeed, being unprepared, many peoplehave been shocked and even frightened by the things they have seen. Doubtless,for every hippie who can still remember his or her “transpersonal experiences,”there will be several that cannot remember, or don’t want to.Another interesting description of the wider reality, one that again encompassesthe kind of nonlocal dimension we are investigating here, is provided byParamhansa Yogananda in his earlier-mentioned book Autobiography of a Yogi(1946). Unlike Ouspensky, Yogananda probably experienced these perceptions notas a result of the use of psychedelic agents, but rather through a heightenedstate of awareness induced by extensive yogic exercises—in breathing, posture,meditation, and so on. In the chapter entitled “The Law of Miracles,” Yoganandadiscusses in some detail his observations concerning the phenomenon of light andits place in the cosmic scheme of things. The passage quoted here, as one cansee, is remarkably prophetic and actually reads, in detail if not in style, likea page from Michael Talbot’s book:Motion pictures, with their lifelike images, illustrate many truths concerningcreation. The Cosmic Director has written His own plays and has summoned thetremendous casts for the pageant of the centuries. From the dark booth ofeternity He sends His beams of light through the films of successive ages, andpictures are thrown on the backdrop of space.9 [26_note.html#fo149]Remember that this particular “holographic” metaphor appeared in print decadesbefore the hologram was ever dreamed of. He continues:Just as cinematic images appear to be real but are only a combination of lightand shade, so is the universal variety a delusive seeming. The planetaryspheres, with their countless forms of life, are nought but figures in a cosmicmotion picture. Temporarily true to man’s five sense perceptions, the transitoryscenes are cast on the screen of human consciousness by the infinite creativebeam. A cinema audience may look up and see that all screen images are appearingthrough the instrumentality of one imageless beam of light. The colorfuluniversal drama is similarly issuing from the single white light of a CosmicSource. With inconceivable ingenuity God is staging “super-colossal”entertainment for His children, making them actors as well as audience in Hisplanetary theatre.10 [26_note.html#fo150]Like Bohm, the Yogi sees the psyche of the observer as an integral part of theentire “cosmic motion picture.” As Yogananda himself saw it, we are all of uslegitimate members of the cast of actors in this universal pageant, performingimages, cast onto the “backdrop of space,” acting out plays within a play, asreal and as unreal as the images on a cinema screen.Significantly, we are here reminded of the Hindu belief that the mechanism thatfacilitates this great cosmic spectacle is in fact light itself—the “singlewhite light of a Cosmic Source.” As we noted previously, this is emphasized inthe principal annual festival of the Hindus, known as Diwali—the festival oflight. Yogananda said that Indian holy men, people who “know themselves,” areable to “travel” at the speed of light and utilize the “creative light rays” tobring into visibility any physical manifestation. The “law of miracles,” hesaid, is operable by any man who has realized that the essence of creation islight. This, he asserted, was the secret of psychokinesis, telepathy, and so on,powers that manifest as a result of tuning in the vibrations of the mind withthe vibrations of light. Presumably such a meeting of forces would create awhole new web of interference patterns (inner octaves) and with it a whole newrange of phenomena."},{"pageContent":"15QP2: The Universal ParadigmAs we noted previously, the holographic principle—of the whole existing in everypart—can be expressed quite simply in terms of musical theory, where each tone,semitone, quarter-tone, and the like of a major scale contains within it all thedata needed to recreate the scale in full. We noted in chapter 8[16_chapter08.html] that the principle of nonlocality is also accommodated bymusical theory, in that the ultimate note at the top of a given octave, beingalso potentially the first note of the next scale, can exist in twoplaces/scales at one and the same instant. In the same way, the top note of agiven triple octave would exist in four scales simultaneously. And so on.Now, the two fundamental musical laws of nature embodied within pi—the law ofthree and the law of octaves—tell us that all human beings are “triple octaves”of resonance, walking “trinities” composed of our sensations, emotions, andperceptions. In the Book of Revelation, which is one of the most detailed andrevealing hermetic texts in existence, this internal trinity is symbolized bythe image of the Woman in Heaven, the pregnant (fully realized) goddess of theskies, whose “child,” after birth, becomes united with God. Significantly, sheis associated with three distinct sources of cosmic radiation emanating fromabove, namely the stars, the planets (symbolized by the moon), and the sun.1[26_note.html#fo151]Assuming that these three “octaves” of the human psyche are harmoniouslycomposed, a transcendental, twenty-second “note” (the “child” referred to in theabove cosmological description by St. John) is then created. This is an entirelynew phenomenon capable of existing in a greater scale, a higher dimension. Wecame across this extraordinary creation in earlier chapters: it is the concept,the “immaculate conception” of Christian tradition.The Hermetic Code, remember, as well as embodying within it the holographicprinciple of inner octaves and of nonlocality, is also in essence a descriptionof an organic process of evolution. This is to say that the individual’srelationship with the greater cosmos is “biometaphysical,” a repetition, on ahigher scale, of DNA’s relationship with its host organism. We can thus regardthe concept as being the metaphysical equivalent of the amino acid. As Iexplained previously, the amino acid is the transcendental product of the RNAtriplet-codon template, which is composed from three of the four fundamentalnitrogenous bases. In precisely the same way, the concept, derived from theharmonious combination of three fundamental “metaphysical bases”—sensation,emotion, perception—must also be a transcendental phenomenon, an active, organiccomponent in a higher, more complex process of development.If we note that the Book of Revelation associates these three fundamental formsof human impulse with the forces operating in the trinity above—that is thestars, the planets, and the sun—we can depict the structure of the human psycheand its relationship with the greater cosmos like so:[images/12.jpg]As we can see, the entire “composition” of the human condition and itsrelationship with the higher dimensions is described in perfect detail by theHermetic Code. The influence of the stars, the planets, and the sun in thediagram above, I have called, for want of a better word, magnetic, although theterm orthodox scientists generally abhor— cosmic—might serve just as well. Thefourth metaphysical base, animal magnetism, is an internal power source, andfrom it is derived the concept, the product of the harmonious combination of thefirst three “bases,” represented in the diagram as the ultimate note of thescale.The idea that “cosmic vibrations” emanating from the spheres above might in somemysterious way influence the human psyche has always been anathema to modernscience. Many scientists today, I am sure, would squirm at such a possibility.And yet, in the light of the universal hermetic processes referred to inpractically every chapter of this book, the orthodox scientific view appearscompletely untenable. Just think about it. Are we seriously to believe thatthere is no connection what-soever between ourselves and the greater cosmos, nocontinuity other than the purely chemical connection between the atoms of whichwe are composed and the exploding supernovae from which they originated? As wehave seen, hermetic theory, a truly universal theory, emphatically excludes thiskind of isolationism, and it even provides us with a coherent theoretical basisfor such an exclusion. We have already seen this universal/hermetic connectionin the way the seven dimensions of the universe coexist and interpenetrate, andhow the four “base notes” of the entire evolving cosmos—DNA, the human brain,the solar helix, and the galactic helix—each function on their own scale, quiteliterally, as active, organic nuclei in the cells of the bodies of greaterbeings.In Revelation, the four “base notes” of the trinity within us all (sensation,emotion, perception, conception), which together represent a microcosmic replicaof the greater universal being, are symbolized by the four “beasts” sitting atthe foot of God’s throne—the lion, the calf, the man, and the magical fourth,the “flying” (transcendental) eagle. The eagle, in this context, is the concept,the product of animal magnetism. This is fire, the fourth “rare earth” of thealchemists, a human condition that Gurdjieff would describe as thelaw-conformable product of a real and independent will.So, from the harmonious combination of the three principal “octaves” of thehuman psyche is born the last fundamental “note” of the whole scale, thetranscendental fourth “base,” out of which proceeds our fourth faculty, ourability to “immaculately conceive,” to formulate enduring concepts and, nodoubt, to perceive the world with a much greater degree of understanding.Representing as it does the ultimate note in the scale of human evolution,animal magnetism has qualities unique to it alone. It contains, at one and thesame time, all the vibrations contained within the twenty-one notes below it.Furthermore, once this final link in the evolutionary chain of events is set inplace, the whole phenomenon—in this case the psyche of the individual—resonateswithin as a unified whole, so that each of the twenty-two separate components ofthe given triple octave, being harmoniously related in the fullest sense, hasnonlocal/holographic properties and contains within it all the informationneeded to recreate all three scales.Taking the principle one step further, we can say that the whole psyche of thefully developed individual, all three inner octaves, also represents a singlenew note in a greater macrocosmic scale existing far beyond the confines of thebrain. And if this greater scale of cosmic resonance is also harmoniouslycomposed, then the higher “notes” comprising it would also be integral parts ofa unified whole. Therefore each note of this greater scale (one of which,remember, is the human psyche itself) would possess nonlocal or holographicattributes and would therefore contain within it all the information containedwithin the whole.As we see, hermetic theory not only supports the notion that the psyche isholographic within, it also accords with Bohm’s view that it is an interactivepart of a greater holographic process operating “out there.” As Gurdjieff said,we are miniature universes, and within us are exactly the same laws and forcesoperating in the greater universe. It is this very fundamental truth that theenigmatic Egyptian “scribe of the gods” intended to convey to mankind when hefirst expressed the universal paradigm, “As above, so below.”Over the last few thousand years of human evolution, this concept of universalcompatibility—this genuine “immaculate conception”— has persisted in thetraditions of civilization builders across the entire world. Heaven is above,Earth is below, and the former dimension is accessible to anyone living whatpreachers of religions call a “righteous” life, that is, a way of being thatreflects, and is compatible with, the prevailing laws and forces of the higherworld, of heaven.So, what would it mean for an individual to achieve this kind of cosmicconsciousness? What might be going on inside the head of such a human being?In an earlier chapter I discussed the work of Robert Jahn and Brenda Dunne, whoconducted an extensive series of laboratory-controlled experiments to test thepsychokinetic abilities of ordinary volunteers. Having concluded from theirfindings that such powers, albeit slight, do in fact exist, they have profferedan explanation for them. Basically they believe that consciousness itself, likeall physical processes, possesses a kind of particle/wave duality, and that,when it is in a wavelike mode it can produce effects at a distance, for examplepsychokinesis or telepathy. If Ouspensky’s previously mentioned telepathicencounters with Gurdjieff operated in such a fashion, that is throughinterpenetrating waves of inner octaves, or interference patterns, this meansthat such effects can span tens and hundreds of miles, and even lock on to amoving train.The obvious implications of the proposition put forward by Jahn and Dunne isthat the whole brain, when functioning at these higher levels of awareness,begins to behave something like a single quantum or wave/particle, whereby vastnumbers of neurons occupying a given region of the cortex simultaneously act inconcert, resonating at a frequency common to all the others—a kind ofmicrocosmic version of what Colin Wilson calls the “group-mind” phenomenon,whose collective power greatly exceeds the sum of its parts. As I mentioned inchapter 4 [12_chapter04.html], the Cambridge mathematician Roger Penrose hascome surprisingly close to this idea by suggesting that “non-local quantumcorrelations” between fundamental particles might be involved in consciousthought processes activated in the brain, so that a greater degree of awarenessis possibly a direct result of this kind of “highly coherent quantum state.” Soperhaps neurons themselves can be induced to behave like particles, engaging innonlocal quantum correspondence with other neurons and working as a singleentity, as they seem to do in the case of the simple sponge.We now have plenty of evidence of this “group-mind” activity in the quantumworld, between electrons in plasmas, for instance, and in the phenomenal,instantaneous alignment of millions of molecules in the thermal process offormation of the Bénard cell. Another interesting example worth considering isthe phenomenon of superconductivity.A superconductor is the name given to any material that can carry a measuredcurrent of electricity with absolutely zero resistance. Normal conductors, suchas the copper wires of electrical appliances in the main circuit of your home,invariably put up a certain amount of resistance to the flow of the current.This is usually lost along the length of wire in the form of heat energy. Undernormal temperatures, known superconducting materials behave in exactly the sameway, partly resisting the flow of the current and losing energy through adispersal of heat. When they are cooled to temperatures approaching absolutezero, however, at a certain stage there occurs a magical transition, and thewhole conductor seems suddenly to switch over to an overall “coherent quantumstate” with absolutely zero resistance. It is as if every individual electronhas suddenly transcended to a higher level of concerted “awareness,” so that thewhole conducting surface begins to perform like a single giant electron.I’m suggesting here that something very like this kind of “superunification” mayalso occur in selected regions of the brain, where individual neurons, given theright kind of impetus, can also transcend the ordinary physical world of causeand effect and unite as a single giant neuron with extra-cortical ortranscendental properties.But what kind of impetus is required to induce in the brain a highly coherentquantum state? Curiously enough, superconductivity may provide us with a cluehere. We shall see how in a moment.We are now assuming, of course, that higher states of awareness are indeed areality. Such states have been spoken of not only by respected illuminati likeGurdjieff and Ouspensky, and prominent Indian yogi masters like Yogananda andSri Aurobindo, but also, as we have seen, by a number of forward-thinkingscientists in disciplines physical and metaphysical, ranging across a widespectrum of intellectual effort, from quantum mechanics to clinical psychology.As we know, yogis and other spiritual masters say that the higher psychologicalfrequencies required to pierce the veil of space and time are accessed throughwork on oneself; through disciplined exercises in posture, meditation, andcontemplation; and other specialized activities. Clearly, therefore, meditation,a process of stilling the mind, is a key factor.To still the mind, as I have explained at length in The Infinite Harmony, is toswitch over from an active mode of thought into a passive mode. Now this processis not dissimilar, in principle, to the cooling down of the superconductor,which brings about a drastic reduction in particle activity within its atomicstructure. In effect, the superconductor becomes passive, and when it does themiraculous transformation in its conductivity occurs and there is suddenlyabsolutely zero resistance to the flow of the current. Something very like this,I believe, is what happens inside the brain when it is stilled to a sufficientdegree; it turns into a kind of metaphysical superconductor, in which mode itputs up absolutely zero resistance to the flow of the “cosmic current.”In scripture, this process of switching over from active to passive mode isgenerally expressed through the idea of offering some kind of “sacrifice toGod,” that is to the higher vibrations of this world. It might be a verypersonal sacrifice, like giving up something dear to oneself, maybe a habit ortendency (as in Lent or Ramadan), or perhaps some time (through prayer orcontemplation), or even something as seemingly mundane as your last-but-onegoat, which at the start of the Muslim festival of Eid is traditionally killedand distributed to the needy.At its heart, this sacrificial element is, in my view, the key to the wholeprocess of transcendental evolution. It is spoken of in many ancient esoterictraditions, and I believe it refers principally to a psychological frame of mindin which we as individuals give up our preoccupations with secular trivia andswitch over into an overall passive state. And this, of course, is precisely whyin religion so much emphasis is placed on meditation or contemplation. Only apassive, receptive mind can take in active data, as a superconductor takes in anelectric current, and subsequently transmit this energy, or whatever, in themost efficient way possible.Significantly, this fundamental requirement—that is, that the mind must bepassive in order to conceive, or to create—is graphically emphasized inRevelation, through the symbolism of the Woman in Heaven, a feminine, passive,receptive entity, who duly conceives and subsequently gives birth to atranscendental phenomenon—the Holy Child, the personification of the “immaculateconception.”Gurdjieff expressed this concept quite clearly during discussions with hisgroups in Moscow and St. Petersburg. In one talk, for example, he mentions acertain book of aphorisms, a collection of home truths gathered from unnamedsages. The following quotations from it clearly emphasize the importance of thepassive element in the evolutionary processes of the mind: “A man may be born,but in order to be born he must first die, and in order to die he must firstawake.”2 [26_note.html#fo152]We can interpret this passage in the following way. A man may be “born”: that ishe may, as Gurdjieff would express it, begin the course of his evolution. Inorder to do this, he must first “die”: he must sacrifice everything for the goodof the work. In order to be able to sacrifice all for the good, he must first“awake”: he must first realize the need for change in himself.Another favored aphorism also gets right to the point: “When a man awakes he candie; when he dies he can be born.”3 [26_note.html#fo153]This is precisely what the alchemical process described in the ancient pyramidritual was intended to express. To be reborn as a god, as an “Osiris,” theinitiate first has to “die,” to become receptive, to open his “mouth,” his mind.When this is done, consciousness, like all products of nature’s organicprocesses, can continue to grow further and ultimately come to fruition.As I have explained at length in The Infinite Harmony, the need for the properlyevolving mind regularly to “take time out” is actually the basis of all majorreligious disciplines. This is why so much emphasis is placed on setting aside,at the end of a working day, or week, a period of rest, a sacred interval, aSabbath. To this end, meditation, contemplation, devotional prayer, andacknowledgment of forces or powers greater than our own are all valid exercisesin stilling the mind, in making it receptive to the unseen, evolutionary forcespermeating the universe. At the root of all this “religious” activity, ofcourse, is music, which is why the Sabbath has consistently been associated withthe number 7, the seventh note, ti, of the major scale, from which is “born” thetranscendental eighth note.The concept of composing mind and body, as I have said before, is relativelystraightforward in theory, but in practice, as anyone familiar with thesubtleties of yoga will know, proper meditation, involving correct breathing,posture, and thoughts—correct everything—is a very difficult thing to sustainfor prolonged periods of time. Yogis undergo years of disciplined training toachieve mastery over themselves in this way.It is clear that Gurdjieff drew some of his ideas from Hindu philosophy, but hisparticular system of self-development was perhaps more pragmatic and bettertailored to the systematic Western mind. In principle, however, the objectiveremains the same: the acquisition of spiritual and psychological harmony.Gurdjieff always emphasized the fact that the human being is fundamentally atrinity within, a triple octave, possessing three “brains” or “centers”—themoving center, the emotional center, and the thinking center. He said that allthree of these “brains” need exercise, need to be developed together, in concertwith one another. If only the thinking center is developed at the expense of theother two, the result is an unbalanced individual—something like theabsent-minded professor who can never find his keys or his umbrella.Alternatively, a highly developed physical “brain” coupled with undevelopedemotional and thinking centers would result in an equally unbalanced ordisharmonious individual—the “beefcake” archetype; and so on.These three fundamental archetypes Gurdjieff referred to as “man number one,”“man number two,” and “man number three.” All had something to contribute towardthe development of the whole, he said, but the alchemical formulas for gettingthe mix right were solely the property of “man number four”—the “sly”man—possessor of animal magnetism, an individual who, like the eagle beast ofRevelation, could “fly” to places where the first three could not.The “places” in question are, of course, the nonlocal spheres discussed inprevious chapters, the higher dimensions existing beyond space and time: thefifth, the plane of light; the sixth, the “solid” world of ultimate reality; andthe seventh, the medium in which all “solids,” all six-dimensional entities,exist and operate.As we have seen, the first of these higher spheres—the plane of light, or thequantum field—has been pretty well charted by scientists. So this alternativereality definitely does exist. If it did not, there would be no such thing as aphoton quantum, no means by which to gauge the maximum velocity allowed bynature—the “constant” or speed of light—and the theory of Special Relativity,with its implications for the “elasticity” of space and time, would bemeaningless. This concept may be difficult for us to understand fully with onlyour ordinary logical thought processes, but the fact is that science has provenbeyond all reasonable doubt that the quantum picture is the primary reality, andthat our ordinary perception of both space and time is simply, as Einsteinphrased it, a “stubbornly persistent illusion.”Nothing new here, then: after all, mystics and yogis have been telling us thisfor centuries, that there is no space, no time, no separate, isolated “things,”that heaven is eternal and its extremities infinite. And all of theseobservations, as we have seen, are in accord with the quantum picture ofreality.These days, of course, established religious disciplines, originally designedfor the express purpose of inducing in devotees the kind of altered states ofconsciousness we have been describing, are for many people decidedly passé.Others regard religion as little more than archaic mumbo jumbo, the “opium ofthe people,” while the more vehement critics will argue that it has ultimatelybeen the root cause of more murder, war, and bloodshed than any other humaninvention—as if man’s inherent selfishness and his insatiable appetite forwealth and power had nothing to do with it.Now there are, as we have seen, shortcuts to these higher planes ofconsciousness, such as the use of chemical triggers like nitrous oxide and LSD.Stanislav Grof’s research led him to conclude that psychedelictrips—transpersonal experiences—are in fact voyages into the quantum orsubquantum field. Presumably there will also be a few million former hippies outthere who can remember experiencing the sensations of timelessness and oneness.And if their lysergic acid was pure enough, and their constitutions strongenough, they might also remember having the distinct impression, as Yoganandadid, that all material things are actually “undifferentiated masses of light.”Obviously, however, the legitimate way of perceiving one or another aspect ofthe wider reality is, quite simply, to work on oneself, to develop one’s powersof cognition, and thus evolve. Gurdjieff said that work of this kind was bestperformed in a school situation, in which each individual member is able toassist, and can be assisted, in the execution of what he called their “consciouslabors,” that is labors done in the right frame of mind and spirit. There isthus a subtle but important difference between ordinary work and work for thesake of the Work. As Gurdjieff put it, there is more to be gained from simplysweeping a floor with the right intent than there is from writing a dozen bookswith the wrong one.In one talk he likened the situation of the pupil to that of a prisoner lockedin a cell, whose only hope of escape is to enlist the help of others. One maybefashions him a rope, another steals him a key, a third perhaps acts as a decoy,while a fourth sits discreetly outside the perimeter wall in the getaway car.Thus, individual development within a school is in fact a joint effort, a“group-mind” situation, in which all must contribute for the good of the whole.Of course, once our escapee is free from his “prison,” there is opened up awhole new range of possibilities for the comrades he left behind, for they nowhave additional “outside” help.And so, what of the possibility of raising the level of individualconsciousness? If we judiciously exclude the somewhat controversial method ofingesting psychedelics, or of being fortunate enough to locate an authenticschool of self-development (beware of imitations), then it would seem, on theface of things, that there are precious few possibilities for us to perceivedirectly the kind of nonlocal reality described by physicists. But in fact thisis not necessarily so. As I said when discussing Robert Bauval and AdrianGilbert’s description of the so-called pyramid ritual performed by the priestsof ancient Egypt, this essentially “alchemical” or hermetic process can bereenacted by anyone, and one doesn’t necessarily have to be inside the GreatPyramid for it to be effectively performed. Indeed, there are situations in lifethat can induce these receptive states of mind, nearly always bringing with thema markedly greater perception of the wider reality, a greater appreciation ofthe world about us.For example, when in imminent danger of losing one’s life, the brain, or itsconsciousness, appears to be capable of tuning in instantaneously to the quantumfield. Thus, survivors of violent events like car, train, or aircraft crashesoften speak of having “seen” their whole lives flash by them in an instant. Thiskind of panoramic perception, in which an entire lifetime is somehow condensedinto a single brief instant, can only take place in a dimension outside ordinarytime.The writer Graham Greene, a manic-depressive in his earlier years, experiencedsomething very similar when, in a moment of recklessness that would makeingesting psychedelics seem as harmless as taking tea with your grandmother, hepicked up a revolver and proceeded to play Russian roulette. The hammer on thegun clicked, the realization that he was still alive dawned on him and, as if aveil had suddenly been lifted from his eyes, the world immediately appearedinfinitely more rich and meaningful.When consciousness suddenly “expands” in this way, the process appears to bevery similar to what happens when the latent energy inside a microcosmic atom isreleased in a nuclear explosion and the resultant shock waves reverberate outinto the macrocosm, or the atmosphere, in the form of a vast mushroom cloud. Thephysical brain housed in the skull is the “atom,” a microcosm, a localizedcenter of energy; consciousness itself, when operating at the kind offrequencies triggered, say, by imminent danger, is a macrocosmic manifestationof the selfsame energy.Now there are, I believe, more gentle and amenable ways to expand consciousness,to pierce beyond the veil of ordinary time and space. For example, evensomething as simple as a hard-earned vacation can lift the spirits and make onenoticeably more appreciative of the vast richness and variety of the world aboutus. In such situations, time can seem to fly by, whereas in duller moments wesay it drags.But in reality, of course, the world itself does not alter in any fundamentalway; it is always full of wonder, and often all that is needed is a differentperspective, a change of scenery, for us to sense that this is so. We have all,at some stage in our lives, experienced negative thoughts and emotions, feltdeflated, bound in time, locked inside a “miserable” day, inside an hour, insidea tiny moment. At such times we see practically nothing of the world about us.On the other hand, you might also remember how rose-tinted the world looked whenyou had just “broken up” for the summer holidays, or when you were young andfirst in love, or perhaps camping out under a tropical sky with the stars soclose you felt you could reach up and grasp them. Such experiences as these are,in fact, genuinely magical, and if one takes time out from the humdrum grind ofsecular living to reflect upon one’s own life, they can usually be rememberedquite easily.Unfortunately, however, despite these illuminating incidents, we generally livethe major part of our lives only in the fourth dimension of time, a sphere ofexistence that, in respect to the higher dimensions, is a narrow, essentiallylinear and extremely restricted world. This is where ordinary consciousnessexists, isolated, like a faint spot of warmth moving along an invisible wire.And if this wire, the line of time, is, as I have tried to explain in earlierchapters, a sort of “cross-section” of a greater plane, then during such eventsas transpersonal experiences, consciousness, like the energy of the atombursting out in a nuclear explosion or, perhaps, the mass of a galaxy as itdraws toward the threshold of the speed of light, would theoretically expand,stretching out laterally, “at right angles,” to the directional flow of the lineof time.Significantly, Yogananda says much the same thing when speaking of masters whoare able to perform supernatural feats, that they “have fulfilled the lawfulcondition; their mass is infinite.”4 [26_note.html#fo154]He says further:The consciousness of a perfected yogi is effortlessly identified not with anarrow body but with a universal structure. Gravitation, whether the “force” ofNewton or the Einsteinian “manifestation of inertia,” is powerless to compel amaster to exhibit the property of weight, the distinguishing gravitationalcondition of all material objects. He who knows himself as the omnipresentSpirit is subject no longer to the rigidities of a body in time and space.5[26_note.html#fo155]Quantum psychology in a nutshell.Not surprisingly, the Hindu tradition of Yogananda is steeped in hermetic lore.Thus the individual is regarded, as in all religious systems, as a livingtrinity, comprising a physical, astral, and mental body—the equivalent ofGurdjieff’s three “centers,” the moving, the emotional, and the thinking.In a short but remarkably perceptive book, The Theory of Eternal Life,Ouspensky’s associate Rodney Collin, drawing from Gurdjieff’s original ideas,tries to identify the possible nature of these three bodies.The physical body, he says, is the one we are all familiar with, and isfundamentally cellular in nature. The second, astral body, or the “soul,” which,he suggests, grows as a result of developing the emotional center, is basicallya molecular manifestation, like, say, sound or scent. Being of a finer, morefluid form of materiality, the astral body has powers unobtainable by thephysical body. For example, like sound or scent, it would be able to diffusemany times faster than the cellular body moves. Further, a cellular body movesonly in a line, whereas a molecular body would be able to spread outsimultaneously over a wide area, like an aroma. Significantly, such a presencewould also be free of the force of gravity, a fact that reminds us ofYogananda’s claim that such a force cannot affect those who “know themselves.”Collin then goes on to imagine human consciousness endowed with the propertiesof matter in a molecular state. It could, for example, be present in many placessimultaneously. It could pass through walls, assume a whole host of differentshapes, even enter inside other human beings. Like musk, it might “haunt” aplace for several years; and if a molecular body the size of a human beingpossessed the metaphysical equivalent of the “pungency” of mercaptan, whichretains its nature even when diluted in fifty trillion times its own volume ofair, it could be simultaneously conscious of every hectare of land in an areathe size of China.As Collin notes, The Tibetan Book of the Dead refers to this astral or molecularbody as the “desire body,” one that, unlike the gross physical body, has thepower to “go right through any rock-masses, hills, boulders, earth, houses, andMount Meru itself.”6 [26_note.html#fo156]The passage quoted is addressed to the dead person, and it implies that themolecular or astral body can continue to exist after the physical body hasexpired. It continues: “Thou art actually endowed with the power of miraculousaction. . . . Thou canst instantaneously arrive in whatever place thou wishest;thou hast the power of reaching there within the time which a man taketh tobend, or to stretch forth his hand.”7 [26_note.html#fo157]Remarkable as these powers might seem, however, they would still fall short ofthe real thing, in that the astral body constitutes only one third of thecomplete trinity, vastly more complex and energetic than the physical body, butcompared to the mental body born of what Gurdjieff called the thinking center,it would still be relatively small and limited. This is why the quoted passagefinishes with a warning: “These various powers of illusion and of shape-shiftingdesire not, desire not.”8 [26_note.html#fo158]As Collin says, both The Tibetan Book of the Dead and the Egyptian book of thesame name, along with many other ancient texts, all suggest that at the death ofthe physical body this new body of molecular energy—the astral body—is born.Buddhists believe that this acts as the vehicle of consciousness in the intervalbetween incarnations. In fact, in Tibetan, Egyptian, and Peruvian rituals, freshfood and drink were set aside in the belief that the smell or essence of itwould nourish the soul of the dead person—a practice Collin sees as clearrecognition of the fact that the physical composition of the “soul” is similarto scent, that it consists of matter in molecular state. He suggests that thismolecular body, like everything else, has to be created, and that this isaccomplished through a sustained accumulation of the finest energies produced bythe physical organism in life. And in order to do this, as Gurdjieff said,individuals must first create in themselves a will of their own, one that wouldempower them with the inner strength to restrain the wasting of these energiesthrough the usual negative emotions or impulses—anger, fear, longing, envy, andso forth. This, according to Gurdjieff, is real alchemy, the “transmutation” ofcoarser energies (human emotions) into finer ones, or the transformation from anordinary “individual” into one who is genuinely undivided, and whose inherentwillpower is consequently fully developed.In chapter 4 [12_chapter04.html], Collin goes on to speculate on the possibleform and function of the third and last component in the human trinity, theharmonious product of the thinking center, that is the mental or, as he callsit, the “electronic” body. His ideas here are particularly interesting, becausethey bring us right back to the quantum field of the physicist, the plane oflight.As he says, molecular vibrations, like sound, diffuse about a hundred timesfaster than physical bodies move, but “electronic” energy (by which he meantlight, the photon quantum), radiates nearly a million times faster still. Thus abody composed of “electronic” matter, which Collin calls the “spirit,” couldtravel instantaneously through three dimensions: that is along a line, like acellular body, over an area, like scent or a sonic boom, and throughout aninfinite volume of space, like the proverbial Holy Ghost.Collin then tries to imagine what would happen if human consciousness wereattached to an electronic device, for example a bright lamp in a room.First, the center, or heart, of the body would be the incandescent filament ofthe lamp, but it would also include all the light emitted from it. Aconsciousness attached to a body of this nature would contain within it all theobjects in the room: furniture, flowers, and plants, even its occupants.Consequently it would illuminate or be conscious of every object from all sidessimultaneously. Everything in the room would, in a sense, become inner organs ofthis electronic entity, and everything happening would be happening inside itand would be sensed as its own life. Thus human consciousness attached to a bodyof light, in including all neighboring beings within itself, would share thenature of “God,” in whom, it is said, all creatures exist and have their being.It is precisely this principle of joining together, says Collin, that lies atthe root of both yoga, which means “union,” and religion, which means,“reunion.”The Tibetan Book of the Dead describes this form of consciousness as the“Radiance of the Clear Light of Pure Reality.” The dead person, assuming hepossesses a “spirit,” is addressed thus: “Thine own consciousness, shining, voidand inseparable from the Great Body of Radiance, hath no birth, nor death, andis the immutable light.”9 [26_note.html#fo159]According to Collin’s interpretation of Gurdjieff’s system, in order to acquirea spirit, an electronic body, an individual must first develop a soul, amolecular body. This is done by concentrating all of one’s molecularenergy—one’s emotional output—to this single goal. Once this is achieved, thenext step would be to “infuse soul with spirit,” which means, in effect, thatindividuals have to learn how to transmute molecular matter into “electronic”matter, that is, “To split the atom and release internally a degree of energywhich only our own age can begin to measure.”10 [26_note.html#fo160]As we see, we once again find ourselves being drawn into the quantum worldinside the atom, the nonlocal realm of electromagnetic radiation, of the photonquantum, the Holy Ghost, the Immutable Light of Tibetan Buddhism.Inside the atom, the nuclear forces ensure that the constituent particles arecontained within definite energy levels. Thus the atom, together with itsnucleus, is a hard nut to crack. Gravity also plays a part in it, though verysmall, as all matter exerts a gravitational pull, however slight.The atoms themselves are held together by the electromagnetic force, which bindsall matter. If its influence were removed, all material stability would cease.Without the electromagnetic force, the chair you are sitting on, or the groundon which you stand, together with the body you are presently occupying, woulddissipate, dissolve into invisible clouds of free-floating quanta. There wouldbe no molecules, inorganic or organic, only a homogenous soup of fundamentalcomponents—quarks—bouncing off one another in an endless display of randomnessand non-interaction.Now the force-carrier, or “gluon,” of electromagnetic radiation is, of course,the ever-constant photon, the most special of all wave/particles. It is uniqueprimarily because it is the only phenomenon in existence capable of inducing inus visual sensation. In other words, it is the medium via which we receive mostof our impressions or perceptions, the bridge, so to speak, between mind and theempirical world. But bridges are for crossing, and in the light of the evidencediscussed in this chapter it would appear that this particular one has beensuccessfully encountered by many a free spirit, some of whom, as we have seen,have left us with some extremely lucid accounts of the extraordinary things theyhave witnessed on the “other side.” With one voice, they speak of a miraculous,timeless, spaceless world, brimming with consciousness and light, pulsating withwaves upon waves of pure energy.Scientists say that mass and energy are in fact different manifestations of thesame thing. This is significant, because consciousness, although we cannotclearly define the phenomenon, can reasonably be regarded as a manifestation ofa subtle form of energy. And then we have the photon, the other side of ourmetaphysical coin, a “virtual” particle that, having practically no measurablemass, exists on the very edge of materiality. Moreover, of all particles knownto exist, only the photon has no antimatter opposite; the photon is its ownopposite. If you were to draw a line down the center of a piece of paper andlist all particles on one side and all antiparticles on the other, the photonwould have to be placed over the line. It is in every sense a duplicitousentity, a shapeshifting Jekyll and Hyde, a particle and a wave. Catch it if youcan.Thus we can see that the dividing line between mind and matter is in realityextremely tenuous, so much so that one feels it would not be stretchingcredibility too far to propose that a high degree of consciousness resonating“in tune” with photon quanta might somehow temporarily neutralize theelectromagnetic force, thus making any form of matter present within the sphereof neutralization “fluid.” It need only be a fleeting moment of fluidity,imperceptible to the naked eye, but if actualized repeatedly in short, sharpbursts, it could well be sufficient, say, effectively to reshape or move greatchunks of stone with relative ease.Such powers, in my view, are attainable, but I believe that they are simply aby-product of quantum psychology, the transcendental evolution of the mind. TheEgyptians and the “builder gods” of ancient America, and probably theirmysterious forebears, the original initiates, were clearly past masters of theart. It might be appropriate, therefore, to leave the last word to them."},{"pageContent":"16The ShapeshiftersIn this era of scientific rationalism, the subject of psychokinesis is, notsurprisingly, a virtual nonstarter. Even though we frequently hear or read aboutindividuals who have, or have had, supernatural powers, very few people haveactually seen, or even laid claim to seeing, proof of such things. So if weexclude party tricks, table-turning, spoon-bending, fakirs on beds of nails, andother such forms of light entertainment, there is really very little in the wayof what we might call the genuine paranormal in the day-to-day life of modernman. But possibly this is simply a sign of the times: the overt rationalism ofscience over the last few centuries may have dulled our extrasensory abilitiesalmost to the point of atrophy. As Ouspensky said, phenomena of a higher orderseem to require a certain degree of emotional energy for their observation andstudy, and this would automatically preclude ordinary experimental methods. Thisis not to say, of course, that scientists as a whole are unfeeling, only thatexperimental observers’ personal level of inner development, including theiremotional state, is not yet considered an essential factor in objectivescientific investigation.Paradoxically, however, quantum physics, the quintessential science ofrationalists, is a veritable hotbed of the paranormal, with its non-locality,superconductivity, and the peculiar phenomenon known as “quantum tunneling,”which involves specterlike virtual particles popping up everywhere, out ofnowhere, only to disappear again nanoseconds later, leaving no measurable trace.In the quantum world, practically anything is possible, even if highlyimprobable, so why not so in the meso- and macrocosmic worlds, where everythingis, after all, made up of quantum systems, and where exactly the same laws ofphysics apply?Obviously individual quantum effects are too small to leave observable traces onordinary sense-objects. A chair remains pretty much the same chair no matter howmany “nonlocal” photons are absorbed or reflected by it. If the chair behavedlike a single microcosmic entity— like an atom of some kind—things might be verydifferent. It could be a chair one moment, a shimmering mass of waves andinterference patterns the next, or perhaps both things at once. Alternatively,if our atom-chair were to interact with a single photon, it might suddenlychange into another kind of chair, one of a different color perhaps, or of adifferent materiality.We noted previously how superconductivity belies experimental logic: theconductor may suddenly and inexplicably change its state entirely. Under normalconditions a superconductor is simply a mass of typical quanta: protons,neutrons, and electrons; whereas in its supercooled state, the whole entitysubsequently begins to behave like a single unified system with quiteextraordinary properties. So superconductivity is in fact a paranormalphenomenon. The conductor itself, although made of exactly the same stuff as youor me, is a conduit, leading, quite literally, to a higher dimension, in which agiven electric current, in meeting absolutely zero resistance—the ultimatepassive state—can potentially flow on to infinity.Admittedly this kind of observation still leaves us very little to go on in ourquest for evidence of psychic powers. But if today the paranormal is conspicuousprincipally by its absence, this does not seem to have been the case in ageslong past. The scriptures, for example, by which I mean the major bodies ofreligious and esoteric wisdom, all speak of the miraculous as if, at one time,it was almost commonplace. Similarly, the legends and myths surrounding thegreat civilizing heroes of the dawn of history—Osiris and Thoth in Egypt;Viracocha, Quetzalcoatl, and Kukulkan in the Americas; the Aryan Manu, Fu-hsi ofChinese tradition; or Orpheus and Amphion in Greek legend—all feature thesefigures’ supernatural powers. Half men, half gods, these civilizers couldapparently move mountains. Certainly they must have been tough cookies to havesurvived the most geocataclysmic period in the history of Homo sapiens sapiens,not only the bitter climate of the last ice age, but also its final, rapidmeltdown and the subsequent catastrophic flood.This alone is a remarkable achievement, but this giant of a race not onlyoutlived a seemingly endless hell on earth, they then went on to build likegiants, leaving a wealth of archeological evidence as proof of their stillunexplained mastery of stoneworking. Such individuals must have been the mostorganized, resilient, and resourceful ever to have existed. No time then forsquabbles, fighting over possessions, petty neuroses, or living in the past.Life was serious, and for a person to have survived the deluge would haverequired, as a matter of course, nerves of steel, an unswerving will, a mind asclear as crystal. A quantum mind, perhaps, the kind that sees the world—and itspitfalls—non-locally: that is, from all sides at once, from “above,” so tospeak, from the plane of light, or even from the perspective of dimension six,the ultimate vantage point.What dangers might such a mind face? Possibly only one: the Fall described inthe Hebrew Scriptures and other ancient texts, the fall from grace, fromoverarching, “nonlocal” consciousness to the ordinary time-laden psychologicalcurrency of today.Significantly, there is an old Native American text indicating that the greatcivilizers definitely did see things in a way very different from our own. Thispassage comes from the Popul Vuh, the sacred book of the Maya. The italics aremy own:They saw and instantly they could see far; they succeeded in seeing; theysucceeded in knowing all that there is in the world. The things hidden in thedistance they saw without first having to move. Great was their wisdom; theirsight reached to the forests, the rocks, the lakes, the seas, the mountains, andthe valleys.1 [26_note.html#fo161]This describes, quite clearly, perception of a nonlocal kind, a mind that “sees”at a great distance as if there were no intervening space. Their sight “reachedto” everything, as if from all sides at once.Upon first reading this text, I was immediately struck by the similarity betweenthe kind of “sight” with which the Mayan gods were empowered, and the telepathicexperiences of Ouspensky, during which, it may be recalled, he was not only ableto communicate with Gurdjieff, but also simultaneously to “see” him sitting inhis train compartment, heading for Moscow.The text of the Popul Vuh continues, describing the mysterious fall from graceof this race of supermen, who had evidently displeased the gods. A divine orderwas duly proclaimed: “Let their sight reach only to that which is near; let themsee only a little of the face of the earth.”2 [26_note.html#fo162] And then:“Their eyes were covered and they could see only what was close; only that wasclear to them.”3 [26_note.html#fo163]But before the Fall, these people, according to legend, could not only seenon-locally, they also had awesome psychokinetic powers, induced through specialforms of music, with which they were able to move gigantic blocks of stone as ifthey were made of polystyrene. There is no direct evidence to support themythmakers’ version of the methods used then, before even the wheel and thepulley were invented. Nevertheless, according to widespread archaeologicalevidence, ancient builders possessed a level of expertise that seems eerily outof step with the established history of architecture.Remember, in what are probably the oldest known buildings in Egypt—the Sphinxand Valley Temples and the Oseirion temple near Abydos—the average size of thelimestone blocks is a staggering two hundred tons. These enormous blocks havebeen positioned one on top of another with extreme precision, yet the Sphinxenclosure, confined within an area enclosed in natural bedrock from which thestatue itself was carved, would have been too small to admit a large number ofworkmen during construction of the adjacent temples. It is now accepted by themore progressive members of the archaeological community—at least inprivate—that the Oseirion and the temples of the Sphinx enclosure may predatethe Fourth Dynasty by a considerable length of time. It seems as if, the furtherback you go, the more impressive and baffling the buildings are. Nevertheless,the Egyptians of the Third and Fourth Dynasties, the successors of thesemysterious master-builders, also displayed spectacular stone-handling skills.The Great Pyramid speaks volumes, of course, with its sheer magnitude andprecision. The finely dressed and precisely positioned granite blocks hauledhigh up into the King’s Chamber each weigh upwards of thirty tons. The chamber’smathematical exactitude is also interesting, particularly in light of themusical theory of transcendental evolution. Being exactly twice as long as it iswide, it gives rise to the ratio 2:1, which is the ratio that defines the firstand last notes of the octave. Another interesting fact is that the GP itself, aswell as having the familiar classical pi relationship incorporated in itsdimensions and proportions, also appears to embody the “Greek” value of phi,which naturally occurs in the relationship between the Great Pyramid’s base andthe length of its apothem or slope; that is, half the base length is in theratio 1:1.618 with the length of the apothem. Phi, like pi, is an irrationalnumber (1.61083); the geometrical proportion derived from it—known to the Greeksas the Golden Section—was considered by the Pythagoreans to have a particularlydistinctive aesthetic quality, a visual harmony of great value when expressed inarchitecture. It was subsequently incorporated in the structure of theParthenon, whose ruins even today inspire in us all a deep sense of beauty andharmonic proportion. The Greeks, of course, could feasibly have been workingfrom a long-extant blueprint, once the property of the ancient Egyptians, andthat, even then, if the Egyptians themselves are to be believed, was a legacyfrom a much more remote era, called in the Pyramid Texts Zep Tepi, the “FirstTime.”A little later on we can take a closer look at this Golden Section, and we shallsee that phi, like pi, has applications way beyond the parameters of geometryand architecture. We shall also see how, in light of the creation processdescribed by the Hermetic Code, there is a subtle but significant connectionbetween the two ratios.It is now generally accepted that the dimensions of the so-called sarcophagus inthe King’s Chamber also incorporate exact mathematical values and proportions:an internal volume of 1,166.4 liters and an external volume of exactly double,2,332.8 liters. Again, we can see here another example of the 2:1 ratio found inthe structure of the ubiquitous octave. This remarkable artifact was apparentlycut and hollowed from a single block of exceptionally hard granite withmeasurable precision. How did the stonemasons do this?As we noted in chapter 3 [11_chapter03.html], the archaeologist William FlindersPetrie was impressed by the skill and expertise of the craftsmen responsible,but was at a loss to explain how the work was carried out. He surmised that thesarcophagus itself must have been cut out of the mother block with long straightsaws, perhaps with bronze blades tipped with jewels harder than granite.However, as Petrie himself admitted, the only jewel hard enough to cut graniteso efficiently would have been diamond, which, as far we are aware, was notknown in Old Kingdom Egypt.Petrie further puzzled over the method used to hollow out the sarcophagus,proposing, from the evidence, that hollow, tubular “drills” up to 12.5 cm indiameter were used to cut circular grooves in the granite, the cores of whichcould then have been chiseled away with relative ease. Again, these strangedrills, powered by heaven knows what, are envisaged as having been jewel-tipped.After examining a number of other drill cores collected at Giza, Petrieestimated that the amount of pressure applied, shown by the speed at which thedrills had evidently cut through the granite, would have required a load of atleast one, or maybe two, tons.Thus, according to Petrie, the ancient masons used tubular drills, their teethtipped with something as hard as diamond and applied with pressures of up to twotons, revolving at speeds great enough to cut through granite as if it were assoft as soapstone. As to how such devices were set and kept in motion, Petriecould offer no explanation, but it would seem safe to assume that he had firmlyruled out pedal power. In any case, wheels and pulleys were supposedly unknownin ancient Egypt (an established archaeological “fact” that might seem hard toreconcile with the use of high-powered, circular drills). Somewhat mystifyingly,not a trace of any of these saws or drills has ever been found.Petrie was equally perplexed by a number of Fourth Dynasty diorite bowls fromGiza, on which, he observed, the engraved hieroglyphs had been drawn with aremarkably fluid, free-flowing hand, showing no signs of having been forciblyground or scraped out. The lines of the inscriptions are extremely fine—afiftieth of an inch wide—indicating that the cutting tool must have had aneedle-sharp point. Bearing in mind that diorite is one of the hardest stones onearth, so that the point of the instrument used must have been a good dealharder—and again, supposedly applied with an enormous amount of pressure—it isdifficult to explain how such fine motifs were so easily and smoothly inscribed.It is true that a modern tool could engrave designs on diorite with relativeease, but such a process would not leave rough edges to the lines. On the bowlsidentified by Petrie, however, there were such rough edges: the diorite had been“ploughed out,” as if as soft as virgin soil.Perhaps the most baffling examples of the Egyptian stonemason’s art are thestone vases found in chambers underneath and around Zoser’s Step Pyramid atSaqqarah, many of which date from centuries before the Fourth Dynasty. As Imentioned in chapter 3 [11_chapter03.html], Graham Hancock examined many ofthese anomalous artifacts: some of them had long, thin, elegant necks and widelyflared interiors, often incorporating fully hollowed-out shoulders. As Hancocksays, this kind of workmanship must have been accomplished by the use of some“as yet unimagined (and indeed almost unimaginable) tool.”5 [26_note.html#fo165]Such an instrument would have to have been narrow enough to pass through theslender necks, strong enough to have scoured out the stone itself, while at thesame time capable of exerting precise upward and outward pressure in order toshape the interior curves and shoulders. Hancock uses the word scoured todescribe how these vases might have been hollowed out, but it would beinteresting to see if the interior of the vessels, like the finely groovedhieroglyphs on the diorite bowls, was in fact “ploughed out,” rather as if thestone, at some stage in the process, had temporarily become soft, pliable,fluid. But then, even if a tool for such a process had existed, this would stillnot explain how the craftsmen were able to gauge the progress and accuracy oftheir work, which proceeded, as it were, “in the dark,” inside the stone.The implications of all this are staggering, for we are not merely talking hereof a stone-carving technology greatly in advance of its day, but one that issuperior to our own. As Hancock says, no stone carver alive today would be ableto match the workmanship of these stone vases, even if he were using the mostadvanced tungsten-carbide tools.Speaking of which, whatever happened to all the tools that are supposed to havebeen used by these preeminent artisans? As we have noted, no traces of the long“bronze saws” have ever been unearthed in Egypt. The same applies to thehardened, tubular “drills” supposedly used to hollow out great blocks ofgranite. What is more, nothing approaching such devices has ever been depictedin any tomb relief; neither have they been described or even mentioned in anytext.And yet, the evidence that tools of this kind were used seems convincing.Examining one particular drill core, Petrie noted that the spiral of the cutsank one inch in a circumference of six inches, suggesting a rate of stone“ploughing-out” that he described as astonishing.Many features of the Great Pyramid itself are equally extraordinary. It isextremely doubtful that even an army of modern stonemasons, using only ropes,levers, ramps, and handheld tools, could ever match such architectural masteryand precision. Measurements taken of its internal proportions and angles, ofexternal alignments and dimensions, have been described as displaying anear-perfect symmetry. It should be remembered, however, that the Giza plateausuffered a violent earthquake in the thirteenth century. It is entirelyconceivable, therefore, that prior to this the pyramid’s overall symmetry might,in fact, have been even more precise.In the BBC publication Secrets of the Lost Empires, Mark Lehner, described asone of the leading experts on the Giza Pyramids, says that the Old Kingdommasons used only copper chisels and punches, even to dress the harder graniteand basalt blocks. His explanation as to how soft copper tools (Petrie wasunaware that bronze was not in use in Egypt prior to 2185 BCE) could be used tocut and hollow out such incredibly hard stone is that the workmen probably usedquartz sand in a wet slurry: it was actually the quartz that did the cutting. Asevidence he cites the discovery of some cuts in the basalt of the Khufu/CheopsMortuary Temple that still retain a dried mixture of quartz sand and gypsum,apparently tainted green from the copper saws. This proposition is almost, butto my mind not quite, feasible, for we would have to envisage a very largenumber of copper saws used in the cutting of even one megalithic block, as thequartz would have to have cut both ways, eating away the much softer coppertools a great deal faster than the granite was cut. Also, the presence of somuch wet slurry in a hand-powered cutting process would surely have had adeleterious effect on the precision of the work. The near-perfect symmetry ofthe granite sarcophagus in the King’s Chamber makes one wonder whether it reallycould have been achieved in this way. Furthermore, there is still the questionof Petrie’s estimation of the speed at which some of the granite drill cores hadbeen cut, not to mention the extreme amount of pressure that must have beenapplied to the point of contact. As for how the engraved diorite bowls alreadydiscussed, and the remarkable stone vases described by Hancock, were produced,we have yet to hear of a plausible explanation.Making no mention of these annoying little anomalies, Lehner describes how heconducted field experiments to demonstrate how he thinks the pyramids themselveswere built. With a crew of forty-four, including a master stonemason, it wasintended within a six-week time-scale to quarry and assemble 186 limestoneblocks into a small pyramid, nine meters at the base and six meters high. Ofcourse, modern construction equipment was employed in the operation. Flat-beddiesel trucks transported the blocks, weighing from three-quarters of a ton tothree tons apiece, and a massive earth-mover was used as a crane to lift andmaneuver them, slung from steel cables. In addition, the workmen used ironhammers, chisels, and levers, whereas the Egyptians, according to Lehner, hadonly copper tools and wooden levers.In the event, Lehner and his colleagues did manage, within the six-weekdeadline, to construct a crudely dressed pyramid consisting of the specifiednumber of blocks. This prompted Lehner to conclude confidently that the Pyramidsof Giza, spectacular though they may be, were “very human monuments, createdthrough long experience and tremendous skill, but without any kind of secretsophistication.”6 [26_note.html#fo166] At no time did the project attempt to cutand dress granite blocks in the manner suggested by Lehner as that most likelyto have been used by the Egyptians. It might be useful to see a practicaldemonstration as to how this was accomplished, not with iron or even bronzetools, but with the copper implements supposedly used by Khufu’s masons. I findit hard to accept that relatively soft copper tools, even if used in conjunctionwith quartz sand in slurry, could ever cut efficiently through just about thehardest substances on Earth. Unless, that is, there was another, hidden factor.According to Lehner, the Great Pyramid itself, a “very human” monument as hecalls it, was built within Khufu’s forty-year reign. So let’s just think aboutthis for a moment: forty years seems, on the face of it, a very long time forthe construction of a single building. But, quite apart from the granite blocks,there are approximately 2,300,000 individual blocks of limestone incorporated inthis structure, each weighing, on average, two and a half tons.So, if all 2,300,000 of these blocks were quarried, transported, and set intoposition in the allotted time (40 years, or 14,600 days), then the rate oflaying down—2,300,000 divided by 14,600—is 157 blocks per day. Dividing 157 by aworking day of, say, 12 hours gives a construction schedule of 13 blocks everyhour, one set in position every four and a half minutes or so, nonstop, that isincessantly, day in, day out, often in extreme heat, through all four seasons,for forty continuous years.Already the incredible seems to have become a reality, but we haven’t yetfinished piling up the statistics. For example, it is unlikely that the buildingwork was maintained at a constant rate for twelve months of the year. The annualflooding of the Nile would not only have hindered work on the Giza plateau, itwould also have demanded that a substantial proportion of the availableworkforce be employed in the seasonal agricultural projects necessary to sustainthemselves.So let’s reasonably assume that the builders worked constantly, not for twelve,but for eight months of the year or, alternatively, eight hours a day. We nowhave to envisage them laying down more than nineteen blocks every hour—about oneevery three minutes. But even then, if Lehner and his colleagues are correct intheir assessments of the time involved and the volume of work done, we couldquite reasonably halve this allotted time yet again. The reason? It is assumedthat the limestone blocks (not to mention the thirty-to fifty-ton granite blockssituated high up inside the core masonry) were hauled up a wraparound spiralramp built from gypsum and limestone chips—in mass almost equivalent to that ofthe pyramid itself. So, while the builders were busily hauling up and layingdown the blocks, others were presumably adding millions of tons of extramaterial to the very same ramp in order to increase its height.Remember there were no cranes, earth-movers, or diesel trucks, no cables, noiron tools—only ropes and wooden levers. As for lunch breaks, vacations,strikes, and all the other very human needs of a large workforce, there seems tohave been little room left for such time-wasting in the life of the FourthDynasty pyramid builder.Given all this remarkable statistical data, one is inevitably left wonderingwhat kind of “human” enterprise we are considering here. It is not, in my view,one that could be matched today, muscle for muscle, stone for stone. Even if wedoubled the proposed construction period to an unlikely eighty years, we wouldstill have to envisage the blocks of the Great Pyramid being set into positionat an unbelievable rate of, at the very least, nine or ten every single workinghour. Lehner’s team, if we include the accepted periods of respite, managed tolay down 186 blocks into the form of a very crude pyramid in six weeks, or 1,008hours. This is the equivalent of laying down about one block every five hours orso, or one block every three hundred minutes. From the statistical evidencealone, we can see that the difference between the rate that the Egyptians laiddown their blocks and that of Lehner’s team makes the efforts of the latter seemnothing short of pathetic. Remember also that, unlike Lehner’s team, theEgyptians had only copper tools and wooden levers, and supposedly had to buildand maintain the massive spiral ramp up which the blocks were to be hauled. Atthe same time they needed to ensure that the pyramid itself, completelyenveloped by this alleged ramp, was kept in perfect alignment, not only with thecardinal points, but also with the key stars above the Nile Delta. In addition,the workmen also had to ensure that the angle of each slope remained at 51degrees, 51 minutes, which is the angle that would naturally result if therelation of the pyramid’s height to the perimeter of its base was exactly thesame as the ratio between the radius of a circle and its circumference.In spite of its almost unbelievable level of precision and craftsmanship, we canstill agree with Lehner on one fundamental point: the Great Pyramid is a veryhuman monument. What he fails to emphasize, however, is that there are manypossible degrees of “humanness,” and that the degree of evolutionary developmentattained by the Fourth Dynasty Egyptians must, on the basis of the evidence theyhave left behind them, have been of an order in certain ways vastly moreadvanced than our own. We are not talking here simply about organizationalskills and technological ability, but rather of the fundamental physical,emotional, and mental capacities of thousands, possibly tens of thousands, ofhighly developed, highly coordinated individuals, men who must have been inpossession of long-lost powers of the human will.Skeptics may argue, along with Lehner perhaps, that this is not so, that, giventime, manpower, and finance—and the will, of course— modern man could replicateanything the Egyptians accomplished, even without modern equipment. But thinkagain: this is a single building enterprise involving about six million tons oflimestone and granite blocks, supposedly quarried entirely by hand, transportedin barges, and then physically hauled up a narrow ramp, with the blocks beingcarefully positioned at the rate of several every working hour, eight hoursdaily, month in, year out, for four whole decades. I would suggest that modernman, if he were to attempt such a feat, would first have to rediscover certainskills and attributes that the Egyptians had and we definitely have not. Asindividuals, the people directly involved in the project must have been morethan just physically fit: they must have been capable of sustaining theirincredible physical output for very long periods, continually, incessantly.So, exactly what kind of physical power was it that these masons were able toexert? They were not giants, after all: there are no broad-shouldered titansamong the teams of workmen depicted in tomb reliefs.We have already mentioned Colin Wilson’s suggestion that the “group-mind”technique might have been instinctively applied—a combination of sheerdetermination of will and effort, of a belief that the gods could make theblocks lighter (encouraged, perhaps, by priests chanting), and of a concertedconcentration on the maneuver in hand. We can add to this another possiblefactor acknowledged by everyone— the familiar phenomenon of what is known assecond wind. We know that athletes involved in prolonged physicalevents—marathons, intensive tests of endurance, and so on—can sometimesexperience a sudden transformation in their energy output and rhythm ofmovement, whereby they can breeze along maintaining the same momentum, but withapparently very little physical effort. Like superconductors, they suddenlyreach a stage where they can “change gear,” and subsequently continue tofunction at a much more efficient rate. In superconductors, of course, theswitch from one state to another is an ultimate transition, equivalent toaccelerating up to the speed of light in the time it takes to blink. Second windappears to be a similar phenomenon, much less of a quantum leap, perhaps, thanthe transformation from ordinary state to superconducting state, but certainly atranscendental step in the right direction. If we suppose, therefore, that thoseinvolved in the actual construction of the Great Pyramid were able to induce inthemselves, at will, something very like this, then possibly the cumulativeeffect of an entire, close-knit team of men working at this much more efficientrate might be sufficient in itself to “lighten their loads” considerably—evenwithout divine intervention. Then again, second wind itself might be just one ofmany states of “humanness” attainable through the development of individualwill. There might be a third degree, a fourth, and so on.The final possibility, understandably too far-out to be taken seriously by mostmodern investigators, is that there may have been a genuine psychic factorinvolved—at least in some of the more difficult and demanding tasks. We aretalking now of real, direct, psychokinetic effects in which the mind itselfsomehow resonates at frequencies powerful enough directly to influence physicalquantum systems en masse, to make hard stone temporarily fluid for example.As we have noted, yogis have consistently claimed that such things are indeedpossible. Yogananda went much further, claiming that physical objects canactually be materialized at will—provided one has a will, of course—an ideathat, as we have seen, has recently been touched upon by the modern researchersmentioned in previous chapters: Stanislav Grof, for example, who has tried tovisualize a process whereby the mind influences the “generative matrix” ofthings, or David Bohm, who suggested that psychokinetic effects might be set inmotion by individuals focusing on “meanings” compatible with resonancesunderlying the wave-functions controlling all material systems.But, of course, even if material systems can somehow be influenced bypsychokinetic energy, hollowing out the widely flared interiors of stone vaseswith narrow swanlike necks would still indicate a degree of craftsmanshipincomprehensible to us. Let’s say, for example, that we gave a modern craftsmana relatively soft material, like graphite, say, or even wood, and commissionedhim or her to replicate, by any conceivable technological means, one of thestone vases examined by Hancock. Could it be done? Possibly, eventually, butsuch a task would inevitably involve the use of electrically powered machinery,perhaps fiber optics of the kind used in microsurgery for seeing inside thevessel, together with remote sensors to gauge the accuracy of the work inprogress— and probably other custom-made tools of a kind not yet invented. If wewere really to put our hypothetical craftsman to the test and ask him or her toequal the skill and dexterity of the ancient Egyptians by fashioning a vase madeof actual diorite or some other extremely hard stone, we might even imagine theadditional application of some form of ultrasonic cutting mechanism like thatdiscussed by the modern toolmaker Christopher Dunn. And all this, remember, tocreate something that “primitive” man made by the thousands in the thirdmillennium BCE, or even earlier.So we have a whole array of mystifying evidence, all of it “written” in stone,that the orthodox archaeologist is unable to explain satisfactorily. However, inother evidence painstakingly “dug up” and then promptly disregarded byhistorians—namely the legends of the builder gods of ancient cultures—we aretold time and again that “magic” was involved in the handling of stone, and thatthis magic somehow involved the use of music. Clearly, if there is any truth inthese myths, we are considering here the use of “tools” quite unlike anything weknow of or can reasonably imagine—mysterious musical devices with magical orsupernatural powers. As we have noted, the only explanation currently on offeris that these techniques had a strong psychological element, perhaps somethingof the kind alluded to by Grof and Bohm, mental tools that Gurdjieff describedas vibrations—“inner octaves”—and that his Hindu contemporary Yogananda called“creative light rays.” And music and light are, of course, two of the mostfundamental manifestations of the Hermetic Code, the universal symmetry firstrevealed by the builders themselves.As we saw in the previous chapter, according to The Tibetan Book of the Dead,the “desire body” of the individual—what Rodney Collin called the soul, or themolecular body—can pass effortlessly right through rock masses, boulders, andmountains. Presumably this would also include stone vases, sarcophagi, and evengreat, monumental pyramids. We, of course, have no proof that the soul evenexists, never mind that it might be capable of “miraculous action.” But then, asOuspensky said, phenomena of a higher order cannot be perceived in ordinarystates of consciousness, so even if the world is positively teeming with thesemolecular shapeshifters floating effortlessly through anything that we wouldcall “material,” who in this present era of scientific rationalism would everknow?The Tibetan Book of the Dead, however, was compiled possibly two thousand yearsbefore the modern scientific quest, before the tentative and guarded ideas ofsuch as Copernicus or Kepler, Galileo, and Newton began seeping in through thecracks of the old, crumbling structures of the formal papal dogma. The TibetanBook of the Dead is traditionally considered to be a description of theproperties of the soul observed by “souls” who had personally experienced such“miracles” between reincarnations, like the Buddha himself. In any event,however we view its validity, the assertion that the “desire body” of theindividual is a reality is quite straightforward and unambiguous.We can speculate further, deeper. If these reported sightings of the soul areindeed valid and the “desire body” is endowed with what is described as“miraculous action,” then what might the entity at the evolutionary stagedescribed in The Tibetan Book of the Dead as the “clear-light of the ultimatereality”—Collin’s “electronic” body—be capable of? According to the Tibetans, atthis stage in the cycle, anything is possible.Could it be, then, that the marvelous Egyptian artifacts found at Saqqarah werecreated by supernatural means, that is by people whose minds, as Collin says,were capable of “splitting the atom” and internally generating psychokineticenergies that could somehow temporarily neutralize the electromagnetic force,thus making granite or diorite soft enough to “plough through” with anymoderately rigid instrument? Sadly, we may never know. We have the evidence,much of it inexplicable, that way back then something odd was in the air:exactly what, we can only speculate.It seems reasonable to suppose, however, that the extraordinary mental andphysical powers of the Egyptian elite were in some way linked to what Gurdjieffwould call their level of being. As we have seen throughout the whole of thisbook, all roads eventually lead to the Giza necropolis, so it is to the creatorsof it that we must inevitably look for a final answer."},{"pageContent":"17“Al-Chem”—the Egyptian WayExactly how the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom attained such a high degree ofphysical and mental development is, of course, a matter of conjecture. My ownview, discussed in some detail in The Infinite Harmony, is that they did this byfollowing to the letter the original precepts of Thoth, a doctrine thatdescribes a process of self-development enacted according to musical principles,resulting in the creation of a very special type of individual. However this mayhave been conducted in practical ways, it is clear that the system employed bythe ancient Egyptians really worked, for these people succeeded in unitingharmoniously like no other nation in history. They were, as the Greeks wouldhave termed it, homonoic in the fullest sense, people entirely of one mind,singularly dedicated to the task of transmitting their highly advanced knowledgeout into the collective consciousness of the whole of mankind. And in this, ashistory bears witness, they succeeded admirably, for the Hermetic Code itself,the symbolic key to the Egyptian view of creation, subsequently became theblueprint from which all of the major religious doctrines of the world have beendrawn.Historians tell us that to the ancient Egyptians religion was an entire way oflife, a mode of being quite unlike any code of conduct practiced today. Theconcept of an afterlife, of an existence in the celestial home of the gods, wasvery much more than just an imaginative belief system sustained by blind faithand primitive superstition. To these people, the afterlife was an attainablereality, one that could be realized by following the primary example of Osirisand Thoth and the many other deities described as the founding fathers ofEgyptian culture and religion.The symbolism invoked in the myth of the Judgment Hall of the Dead, in whichThoth/Hermes is a pivotal figure, explains the Egyptian concept of individualharmony as a passport to the afterlife very clearly.In the collection of papyri known for convenience as The Egyptian Book of theDead, it is said that the ka, or the spiritual double of the deceased, wandersthrough the darkness of the underworld in search of the Judgment Hall and takeson the name of Osiris in the hope of being restored to life, like Osirishimself. The subject then enters the vast Judgment Hall, where Osiris, describedas having ten times the stature of the dead man’s spiritual double, sits readyto oversee the proceedings. Between them is a giant pair of scales. SubsequentlyAnubis, the jackal-headed god (usually associated with Sirius, the “Dog Star”),and the hawk-headed Horus, son of Osiris (associated with the sun), wait tosuperintend the ritual. Thoth, the ibis-headed scribe (whose symbol is the moon)stands in attendance ready to record the result.As we see, the symbolism described so far is unmistakably hermetic, anexpression of the universal law of triple creation, the same law that was laterencoded in toto in the later Revelation of St. John, who depicted the Woman inHeaven, the queen of creation, wearing a crown of stars (Anubis), a robefashioned from the fabric of the sun (Horus), with her feet resting squarely onthe moon (Thoth).To continue with the underworld ritual, a single feather, symbol of the goddessMa’at, whose name means “truth,” is then placed on one pan of the scales, andthe dead person’s “heart” on the other. Only if the two pans remain perfectlybalanced, that is, only if the individual’s “heart” is in perfect harmony withTruth/Ma’at, can the ka win the favor of Osiris and ultimately achieveimmortality.So this concept of universal harmony describes the principle of acting outharmonious sequences of conduct and development in space and time. This was thecentral theme of the “Egyptian way”: the science of music, of alchemy, the wayof the gods. As we have noted, this “way” was reflected quite clearly in thethree major creation myths of the Old Kingdom, Memphite, Hermopolitan, andHeliopolitan, which all describe the miraculous appearance of an enlightenedgroup of eight principal deities. Exactly the same underlying format, namely theoctave, was also the basis of the annual performance of the sacred Osirianmysteries, the first “passion play,” traditionally reenacted in the form of aneight-act drama. Indeed, it is very likely that everything the Egyptians did,whether building pyramids, enacting sacred rituals, or simply walking down acauseway, was invariably performed to the accompaniment of this universal music.Even to this day, many orthodox Egyptologists still refuse openly to admit thatthe pi symmetry was known and used by the ancient Egyptians. In fact, we havepersistently been told that they had no mathematics as such—a claim that mightseem hard to reconcile with the absolute geometrical symmetry and precision ofthe Great Pyramid and with the exact mathematical relationships evident in theKing’s Chamber and the granite sarcophagus. Curiously, the dimensions of theGreat Pyramid yield proportions with a value closer to “mathematical” pi(3.14159) than to the “classical” approximation (3.142857 rec.). However, withthe original casing blocks now missing, and the whole structure shaken by amajor earthquake several hundred years ago, it is impossible to determinewhether the original angle of slope was intended to express the more accuratemathematical value of pi or its symbolic equivalent.In any event, it was the classical convention that played the key role inEgyptian metaphysics. As we have seen, the Egyptian “model of the gods” wasbased on the phenomenon of light itself (after which, remember, the GreatPyramid was originally named), which modern science has since shown to be anelectromagnetic manifestation of pi. It is an octave of resonance, with eightfundamental divisions in its overall structure: red, orange, yellow, green,blue, indigo, violet, and, of course, the transcendental white. But it also hasthree “primary” wavelengths: red, yellow, and blue, frequencies that make itpossible to subdivide further this fundamental octave into three subsidiaryscales, that is into a tripleoctave format. Therefore pi, like light itself, iseverywhere.And so this universal symmetry—the Hermetic Code—was seen both as a model ofperfection and as a description of a precise mode of being, an essentiallymusical system of conduct through which consciousness is, in effect, able tocomplete the course of its development and so transcend onto higher dimensions,greater “scales” of psychological “resonance.” We have already noted a practicalapplication of this “music in action” in the records of Old Kingdomadministrative procedure, where the vizier to the pharaoh, the high priest andkeeper of the mysteries, was given direct control over all twenty-two “nomes”(districts) of Upper or Southern Egypt, while his deputy, still perhapsundergoing various intermediate stages of initiation, was given subsidiarycontrol over just seven nomes.This unique “musical” relationship between the two priests is particularlyinteresting, because it brings us back to an idea discussed in earlier chapters,in which I proposed that all creative processes, whether they occur below in themicrocosmic world of the self-replicating cell, or above in the double helix ofthe mind of the shaman or master mason, are, in fact, organic in nature.Remember, hermetic is genetic. It follows, therefore, that the process ofpassing on knowledge from one individual to another, from teacher to pupil,master mason to apprentice, was, in a very real sense, an organic system, onethat involved disciplined, harmonious conduct and, of course, the subsequentsystematic dissemination of the “immaculate” concepts by which they were guided.Being, as it were, “psychologically sound,” these original concepts were quitenaturally replicated faithfully, “religiously,” in every succeeding generation.Thus, despite two interim periods of destructive social anarchy, the Egyptianway of life continued virtually uninterrupted for three long millennia. Thislongevity, I believe, is the result of what is, in reality, an organic process,whereby the original, highly potent ideas of the gods of the First Time, exactlylike successful genes in the biological heritage of dominant, evolving species,were repeatedly and faithfully “copied” in the evolving metaphysical “gene pool”of the collective Egyptian psyche.We know that in the natural course of Darwinian evolution successful genes cansurvive all manner of catastrophes: ice ages, rapid meltdowns, deluges,earthquakes, cometary impacts. In the same way, the hermetic ideas we aredealing with here—the metaphysical equivalent of successful genes—have survivedall kinds of social upheaval: wars, dark ages, periods of total ignorance andbarbarism, inquisitions, revolutions, and so on. Therefore we are not speakingin metaphor: we are talking about organic processes of creation and evolution,both microcosmic and macrocosmic, which are identical in every way, with adifference in scale only. This, of course, is precisely what is being referredto in the hermetic dictum quoted many times before: “As above, so below.” We cantake this quite literally: the genetic code of the microcosm is the mediumthrough which greater organisms evolve, and exactly the same pattern is repeatedin the “cosmos” above, where the Hermetic Code describes the process by whichconsciousness grows and develops. There is a passage in a collection ofpost-Christian texts known as the Corpus Hermeticum that comes close toexpressing the same idea. The god Thoth is here speaking to his son, Tat: “Myson, Wisdom is the womb, conceiving in secret, and the seed is the true good.”1[26_note.html#fo171]As I have said, I believe that practically everything the Old Kingdom Egyptiansdid was performed to the accompaniment, so to speak, of the esoteric musiccomposed by the founding fathers of Egyptian culture, the so-called gods of theFirst Time. This implies, of course, that the entire Great Pyramid constructionproject itself was also conducted in accordance with the same principles. Inother words, the whole project must have developed organically, which is to saythat the Great Pyramid in effect “grew” out of the collective efforts of thesevery special people. We know that living organisms developing from microscopicembryos increase their bulk and complexity exponentially, two cells dividinginto four, four into eight, and so on. Possibly, therefore, the building of theGreat Pyramid began relatively slowly at first but, as the construction workersbecame more and more adept at their craft, more “in tune” with the tasks in handand with one another, the rate at which the blocks were laid down would haveincreased accordingly, perhaps building up to a final crescendo of activity of akind that we today can barely imagine. Indeed, were it not for the hard stoneevidence at Giza staring us in the face—nearly two and a half million pieces ofit—most people of a rational turn of mind would consider such a feat improbable,at least within the time span allowed by orthodox Egyptologists.We have already established that the exact number of years taken to enact thisremarkably harmonious performance is unknown, as indeed are the methods used, soit is not possible to explore an incidental pet theory of mine, which is thatthere might have been some sort of correlation between, on the one hand, thesuccessive stages of construction and development of the structure and, on theother, the harmonic ratios of musical theory. Nevertheless, if the wholeproject, from start to finish, is viewed—as the Egyptians viewed almosteverything—as a hermetic phenomenon, then we can say that the Great Pyramiditself, the first and foremost of the seven wonders of the ancient world, alsorepresents the final “note” of the completed scale of enactment. And the finalnote of any major scale, as we know from musical theory, has transcendentalproperties, because it is also the first note of the greater scale above. Inexactly this way, the Pyramid of Khufu/Cheops can in fact be regarded as agenuine transcendental phenomenon, whose universally harmonious proportions andalignments are, even today, five thousand years after they were created,striking strangely familiar chords in the minds of anyone prepared to take timeand listen.So we see that the Great Pyramid is in reality much more than a mere building.It is a life-bearing, organic phenomenon, an “immaculately conceived,”metaphysical “gene strand” of extraordinary resilience and potency, in which isencoded the secret of life itself.I certainly don’t expect a favorable response from the orthodox Egyptologyestablishment regarding my musical/organic interpretation of the “Egyptian way.”But this does not concern me unduly. The important point is to get one’s ideasaired, to “sow the seeds,” and then let nature take its course—a process inwhich I have a great deal of faith. If one ends up as no more than a weed inEden, there is still the possibility of a flowering of some kind. Surely this isbetter than sowing nothing at all.So, while I may not be “in sync” with orthodoxy—or even, for that matter, withthe ill-defined group of “New Age” thinkers at the cutting edge of the GreatDebate—everyone seems to agree on one fundamental and very important point,which is that the Egyptian civilization was unique and very special. Evenorthodox historians are given to using superlatives and poetic metaphor todescribe the works of the first masons of this remarkable culture.John Romer, for example, one of the most respected authorities on ancient Egypt,describes the pyramids in a way I find particularly apt in respect of the ideasdiscussed in this book: “the nuclear reactors of ancient Egypt, the throne ofthe sun itself.”2 [26_note.html#fo172]In a sense, of course, there is more truth in this statement than Romer himselfwould care to acknowledge, for the Great Pyramid— “The Lights”—is indeed anucleus of creative, intelligent data, an undiminishing beacon, whoseilluminating beams of metaphysical “light” are, even to this day, radiatingconstantly out into the darker world of the ordinary human psyche.As suggested in a previous chapter, the Giza necropolis was designed as a mirrorimage of the sky above the Nile Delta, and the Great Pyramid itself, as well asbeing the repository of the wisdom of Thoth, also functioned as a kind ofceremonial launchpad for the ascending, star-bound soul of the initiate. Thisvital connection with the heavenly sphere, the stellar scale of existence, isgenerally accepted by everyone. Romer himself expresses it: “By piling form onform the Egyptians had created a shape so dramatic that, in unison with itscommanding position at the horizon, it joined heaven to earth, earth toheaven.”3 [26_note.html#fo173]In certain texts, the pyramids are sometimes referred to as the “Mounds ofHorus”—an understandable name, given the fact that Horus himself was essentiallya solar deity. There is one verse of the Pyramid Texts that describes how Horus,Osiris, and other mythical deities first initiated this whole process oftranscendental evolution. “There come to you . . . the gods who are in the sky,and the gods who are on earth. They make support for you upon their arms; mayyou ascend to the sky and mount upon it in this its name of ‘Ladder.’”4[26_note.html#fo174]The “Ladder” in question is, of course, the ladder later perceived by the HebrewScriptures patriarch Jacob, the “rainbow covenant” of the Israelites, thephenomenon of light.The Egyptians, it seems, had realized long ago that light is the vehicle ofconsciousness, the medium through which the mind is able to transcend on to thestellar scale of existence. As I have said, they did not simply believe thatthis was so; they knew it, because they had firsthand experience of heaven. Howelse could they have possibly come to terms with such mind-boggling concepts astimelessness and infinity, concepts that, even in the earliest periods, were anintegral part of Egyptian metaphysics, as the passage quoted in chapter 2[10_chapter02.html] from the Old Kingdom poem referring to the godking clearlyshows: “His life-span is eternity, the borders of his powers are infinity.”It should be noted that the relatively recent ancestors of the author of thisverse were supposedly primitive farmers, and that Egyptian civilization at thistime was allegedly barely a couple of centuries old—younger, in fact, than ourown. Yet here we have a scribe contemplating ideas of such an exalted andsophisticated nature that, were you to attempt to discuss them today with yourneighbor, you might predictably be met with, at best, a glazed expression.Curiously however, in scientific circles— among quantum physicists,astrophysicists, and the like—such concepts as eternity—a timeless dimension—andthe infinite, spaceless realm of the nonlocal, quantum field are commoncurrency. Similarly, if one were able somehow to travel at the speed of lightand so see the world through the “eyes” of the Holy Ghost—the photon quantum—the“heavenly” realm of the Egyptian god-king would spring magically into view. Timewould be perceived to dissolve into eternity, and space would enfold into anonlocal world of the kind observed by Ouspensky, with no borders, no “sides” toit.Another significant feature of Egyptian metaphysics that has a distinctly modernring to it is the idea of the constant squared being the key to all creativeprocesses. In chapter 5 [13_chapter05.html], I discussed briefly themathematical trick devised by Einstein’s one-time tutor, Herman Minkowski, bywhich he used the value of the square of the constant (speed of light) as ameans of determining the amount of pure energy stored in any given mass. As wehave seen, this idea seems to have been uncannily foreshad-owed by Egyptianmetaphysicians, who associated “The Lights”—the Great Pyramid—with what was tobecome known in Ptolemaic Egypt as the Magic Square of Mercury and the number2,080, the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 64. Sixty-four is the square of theconstant number, 8, the number of full notes in the major musical scale and thenumber of gods involved in the early myths concerning creation. And today, ofcourse, we find that sixty-four also is the maximum number of RNA triplet-codoncombinations comprising the genetic code, the symmetry employed by DNA in thecreation of all known forms of life. Furthermore, it is surely no coincidencethat the Hermetic Code itself, the classical convention 22/7, can be furthersubdivided into three inner formulae, thus producing from the original “tripleoctave” a composite figure of nine octaves, sixty-four notes. As we noted alsoin chapter 4 [12_chapter04.html], this same number has even cropped up in thesuperstring theory of subatomic quanta, which are described rather mystifyinglyas one-dimensional “strings” of vibrating energy, and which are theorized ashaving 64 degrees of movement associated with them.The number 64 appears also in other ancient number systems. In the tarot forexample, there are fifty-six Minor Arcana cards (the number cards) andtwenty-two in the Major Arcana (the picture cards). The Major Arcana is asymbolic representation of the triple octave, an expression of the formula pi.And according to the law of octaves, this triple octave is also, on anotherscale, a single octave comprising eight fundamental notes. If we subsequentlyadd these eight fundamental notes on to the Minor Arcana figure, we are leftwith the magical sixty-four. Then we have the I Ching, of course, which Idiscussed in the introduction of this book—an exact blueprint of the geneticcode itself, with its sixty-four hexagrams and eight fundamental trigrams.Another interesting example is the old British measure of ground area—theacre—640 of which constitute a square mile.In the last chapter I mentioned the “golden mean” proportion, denoted by theGreek letter phi, which naturally occurs in the relationship between the GreatPyramid’s base and the length of its apothem or slope; that is, half the baselength is in the ratio 1:1.618 with the length of the apothem. Like pi, phi is anaturally occurring ratio. It is expressed in a well-known series of numbersknown today as the Fibonacci series, named after the thirteenth-centurymathematician who first noted them. Each number in the series is the sum of thetwo preceding ones, like so: 1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 1 = 3, 3 + 2 = 5, 5 + 3 = 8, 8 + 5 =13, followed by 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, and so on to infinity. If we divideany given number with the one preceding it, an approximate value for phi isobtained, which is usually rounded off to 1.618. So, for example, 233 divided by144 gives 1.618055555556. The higher the numbers used, the greater the accuracyobtained for the value of phi.We noted previously how this proportion has a distinctive aesthetic quality whenincorporated in architecture, of which the Parthenon and the Great Pyramiditself are the best-known examples. But there is also another significant aspectof the golden mean proportion, one that has a direct bearing on the centraltheory of this book. It seems that phi, like pi, also manifests in the natural,organic world, the world created by the genetic/Hermetic Code. As examples ofthis, we see the developmental stages of the spiral seed-patterns of the fircone and the sunflower. Any two of these stages taken together always correspondwith two consecutive numbers of the Fibonacci series. The same is true of thespiral growth pattern of the nautilus shell. The point is that this phirelationship as it manifests in the organic world is intrinsically connectedwith the growth and development of spirals, helices, of which the most prominentin the whole of nature is, of course, DNA. And DNA, remember, is composed ofprecisely sixty-four components. We should note also that all of the other “lifeforms” discussed in previous chapters—principally the four-dimensional structureof the human brain and of the “solar” and the “galactic” helix—are all spirals.Possibly there are harmonic geometrical and mathematical patterns in thedevelopment and growth of all of these helical structures, but this is aquestion that requires more space to investigate than I can currently afford.For me, I think the most impressive feature of this Egyptian world-view, of aninfinite realm inhabited by the gods above, is the fact that these people appearto have actually devised a way for individuals to experience this alternativereality for themselves, to become “gods” in their own right. We are referringhere, of course, to the way of the alchemist described by the theory oftranscendental evolution, a theory based on the concept of harmonizing one’sinner faculties according the principles of musical theory, and of strikingmetaphysical “notes” up into greater “scales” of existence.Surely even the most skeptical observers would have to admit that theformulation of an idea as farreaching as this, one that has practical as well astheoretical applications, is in every sense a remarkable achievement. Indeed, asI said in my last book, the Hermetic Code itself is possibly the brightest ideaever conceived by man, the original “immaculate conception.” As such, thisconcept represents an intellectual advancement of utterly staggeringproportions, one which, in terms of the kind of natural selective evolutionenvisaged by neo-Darwinists, can accurately be described as a genuinemacromutation of the hominid mind.To summarize: in my view the Egyptians of the early dynasties were a giant of arace, people who walked the earth with their feet firmly on the ground, butwhose minds and spirits knew no physical boundaries. They existed in theinfinite cosmic ocean; they were “quantum tunnellers,” “superconductors,”denizens of the plane of light above and of the quantum field—the“underworld”—below.And their secret? How did they gain access to the nonlocal dimension soeffectively? How did they become conscious to such a degree that they were ableto see the universe from all sides at once, from above and below, inside andout?The myths tell us quite clearly that they did this by adopting the harmonicprinciples of music as a code of conduct, a systematic, “religious” method ofharmonious psychological development, the original tenets of which wereingeniously encoded in the “immaculate” pi convention. This, surely, is themother and father of all disciplines. It is alchemy, the “Egyptian way,” thescience of the followers of the enigmatic Osiris and Thoth, civilizers of “theFirst Time,” who taught that all creative, life-bearing processes, including theultimate flowering of human consciousness, are products of the action of theforces described by the two fundamental laws of nature—the law of three forcesand the law of octaves. The law of three, as we have seen, states thatevery-thing created is the result of the action of three forces: active,passive, and neutral. This is, I think, precisely what lay behind the symbolismof the three major deities of the Egyptian pantheon, the origin of theall-embracing trinity, with Osiris (male, active), Isis (female, passive), andHorus, the law-conformable (neutral) product of the union of the first two. Thesecond fundamental law, the law of octaves, states that all things created arecomposed within of eightfold symmetries— hence the broader Egyptian pantheon ofeight principal gods, said to have appeared simultaneously (non-locally?) on thefabled “Island of Flame.”THE FINAL ANSWERThe Egyptians are believed to have had a national motto, which inLatintranslates as memento mori, “remember you must die.” The word die is generallytaken literally, but I suspect that there was more to it than that. After all,these people did not believe in the total extinction of the human being. Theybelieved fervently in a life after death, a life among the stars, with Osiris,Isis, Horus, Thoth, and all the rest. So why did their national motto notreflect this belief? Why not “remember you can live forever?” One can onlyassume that these people did not need reminding of what to them was theself-evident reality of the afterlife. Old Kingdom Egyptians were almost totallypreoccupied with it, as the myths and the precise, star-bound alignments oftheir architecture clearly show. The reference to “dying,” therefore, may havesome other, more esoteric meaning, and I suspect that this was precisely thesame meaning as that alluded to in the passages from Gurdjieff’s book ofaphorisms mentioned in the last chapter, one of which read, “When a man awakeshe can die; when he dies he can be born.” Memento mori, therefore, was probablyintended to remind initiates not of their mortality, but of the way in whichimmortality can be achieved; that is, by dying to the illusory, material world,by regularly adopting a passive role in the cosmic scheme of things. There is awell-known biblical quotation that expresses the very same principle: “Except acorn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, itbringeth forth much fruit.” The organic inference here is particularlyappropriate, because genetic processes, as we have seen, are hermetic; therefore“fruits” of any kind, whether above in the mind or below in the living cell, arecreated in exactly the same alchemical way.So “dying” in life (meditating, making oneself receptive to greater cosmicinfluences) was seen as a way of preparing individuals for death as we think ofit, a natural event, which to the Egyptians was seen not as a terminal event butrather as an organic transition in an ongoing evolutionary process. We mightcall this transition a macromutation of the human spirit, an ultimate,mind-altering meta-morphosis, through which consciousness transcends on to aninfinitely greater scale of existence. This is the scale alluded to in thesymbolism of the two-winged caduceus, the magic wand of Hermes, a graphicrepresentation of the greater “double helix” in the sky. This principle isclearly expressed in this verse from the text known as the Corpus Hermeticum:Do you not know, Asclepius, that Egypt is made in the image of Heaven, or so tospeak more exactly, in Egypt all the operations of the powers which rule andwork in Heaven have been brought down to earth below? Nay, it should be saidthat the whole Cosmos dwells in this land and its temples.6 [26_note.html#fo176]So the Giza necropolis was designed as a kind of mirror image of the EgyptianDuat, of the sky, principally to emphasize humankind’s star-bound destiny. It issignificant that the word Duat also meant “underworld.” Now, perhaps, we canunderstand why. Above and below—the plane of light and the quantum field—are oneand the same nonlocal dimension. And incredible as it may seem, the Egyptiansappear to have been aware of this.Continuing for the moment with our organic perspective, it is evident that thesepeople somehow succeeded in breaking free from the Darwinian mode of evolutioncommon to all, and quite literally macromutated, evolved transcendentally, intoa nation united, into a greater, single, homonoic “organism.” What we are tryingto envisage here is a kind of metaphysical “chromosome,” a living,multidimensional structure, whose life-bearing data—ideas, precepts, concepts,rituals, and myths—were designed or created solely to build, on a macrocosmicscale, even greater organisms, “gods” if you will, “Tetrads in the sky.”We, today, are the inheritors of these metaphysical “genes” and, although ourgeneral mode of evolution is characteristically Darwinian—“naturallyselective”—I believe that buried within the collective consciousness of thehuman race there remains an underlying tendency to evolve transcendentally, justas the Egyptians did. As we have seen, these enigmatic people not only evolvedinto a race apart, they left behind them all the data required for us to followin their wake. They planted “seeds” as they passed through this world, seeds ofwisdom, of symbol, myth, and legend; seminal ideas, which, over the millennia,have periodically germinated and come to fruition, and which today are onceagain beginning to produce a whole “new” variety of conceptual flora.Modern science, for example, which seems to me to have been born out of aninstinctive need for the human mind to overcome the desolate, stultifyingclimate of the Inquisition, is now poised to enter its transcendental phase.Accordingly our attention is once again turning to things “above,” to the cosmositself, and to things “below,” to the quantum field and the nonlocal realm beingexplored in scientific communities worldwide.The early pioneers of the modern scientific movement—Newton, Galileo,Copernicus, Kepler, and so on—began this present phase of metaphysical growthwhen they started to observe the heavenly bodies and to understand the forcescontrolling them. The ensuing process of scientific enquiry culminated in theideas of Albert Einstein, whose own attention was eventually to focus, perhapsinevitably, on the constant light of the sun. In a sense, therefore, through theconcepts of this modern genius, the great Egyptian sungod Ra has triumphantlyreturned, bringing with him a glimmer of understanding, a timely recognition ofthe eternal, spaceless dimension in which he reigns supreme.So the ancients’ description of the constant realm of the god-king, formulatedby people to whom, one suspects, “transpersonal experiences” were readilyaccessible, was subsequently reborn under its modern guise of SpecialRelativity, the theory that finally turned logical thought upside down, and thatultimately gave rise to the “new” scientific vision of a nonlocal universe.But, as we have noted, this modern “genestrand” of ideas is actually a mutatedform of the original “immaculate conception.” In reality the basic components ofthe Egyptian way, exactly like the dancing genes in the DNA of a newlyfertilized ovum, have simply been “jiggled about,” but they remain essentiallythe same components, the same genes. Even in King Solomon’s day, it wasunderstood that the esoteric traditions of the Judaic religion were simplyechoes of a much older theme: “and there is no new thing under the sun. Is thereanything whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It hath been already of oldtime, which was before us.”7 [26_note.html#fo177]Throughout recorded history there have been other, quite distinct, mutations inhuman thought, characteristic variations in the evolving species of nations. TheChinese, the Indian, Persian, Greek, Judaic, Christian, and Islamic codes oflife—all of these metaphysical “creatures” have been born and have thrived intheir own day as dominant gene-strands. Today these same genes are in a passiveor recessive mode; scientific ideas and concepts have now superseded them. Itmay be argued that the Christian and Islamic traditions are still dominant,active, but I would suggest that this is due largely to extreme fundamentalistelements of a type that Jesus and Muhammad, both of whom were relative paragonsof compassion and tolerance, would be unlikely to countenance if they werearound today. But, in any event, all of the major religions and esoterictraditions are still there, still alive (literally) in the great gene pool ofhuman consciousness. In subsequent generations they may even become dominantagain, may each undergo a sudden resurgence or renaissance, as the human braincontinues to develop and to adapt to environmental variables.The obvious conclusion to be drawn from this ongoing “metabiological” process ofthought is that the ancients had it exactly right, that the entire cosmos—thereal universe, as opposed to the four-dimensional physical shadow perceived inour ordinary states of awareness—is indeed a living, breathing creature likeyou, whose life-blood is none other than consciousness itself. This in turnsuggests that the whole universe, like any organic body, is pulsatingthrough-out with life.Sri Aurobindo said that if a single point in the universe were unconscious, thenthe whole universe would have to be unconscious. Scientifically we can interpretthis to mean that if the “mindlike” qualities of the photon or the electron wereremoved, if “nonlocal quantum correlations” were to cease, the whole cosmoswould become a dark and lifeless void. Fortunately the great ancient sun god iscurrently alive and well and gloriously omnipotent, and as long as thisuniversal archetype continues to inhabit our dreams and to be the principalvehicle of our perceptions, the human race, it seems, will never be alone.So it is very likely that science fiction has been nearer to fact than manypeople imagine and that there are “aliens” out there. If the universe is a zoon,an immense, six-dimensional creature going around by the name of God, there mustbe. But these extraterrestrials, no matter what form they might take, are ourbrothers and sisters, metaphysical “proteinbuilders” just like ourselves,created by, and acting under, the direct influence of “gods” of star-strung,serpentine “chromosomes.”Now, here’s a thought. If we are ultimately to turn science fiction into realityand communicate directly and coherently with our extraterrestrial counterpartsacross billions of light years of space, then the connection, one suspects, willsomehow have to be made, not through the use of impossible-to-build “warpfactor” starships, or hypothetical “wormholes” in the curved fabric ofspace-time, or even radio waves, but through the metaphysical frequencies of thenonlocal, subquantum (“underworld”) channel of communication. The Egyptians, ofcourse, have already made contact with other beings; they have “died” andjourneyed to the underworld and passed the ultimate test of truth. And so, too,have all the other remarkable teachers of hermetic wisdom mentioned in thisbook, individuals whose thoughts, ideals, and concepts still flourishunceasingly in the collective consciousness of the human race as it grows, ashimmering, multidimensional pyramid of resonant data, up toward the heavens.These great souls have already been born into spirit; they are, in a sense,already “out there,” communing with the godlike inhabitants of the starry world,waiting patiently for us to join them in the celestial celebration that neverends, a party to which, it seems, we have all been cordially invited.So when you think you’re ready, you might care to rendezvous at the Gizaterminal. Even if you get there only in your wilder dreams, it all adds up. Themore positive thought patterns we transmit out into the nonlocal energy field(the plane of light, the “book of life”), the more we will ultimately get out ofit. Our input, however, if it is to have any lasting effect, will have to behomonoic, that is, conducted through a genuine union of minds. Like the pyramidbuilders we will all have to pull together and start integrating in a truespirit of cooperation and openmindedness. Presumably the cumbersome ego willhave to be completely discarded. Remember the feather on the balance in theJudgment Hall of the Dead, the symbol of Truth. What earth-bound ego couldpossibly pass such a test of its real substance? None.So think of the stages of evolution enacted in the metamorphosis fromcaterpillar to butterfly as the evolving entity sheds its dense, gravity-boundchrysalis and ultimately flies up into the sky, to a new life. Perhaps, throughliving simply in compliance with the basic laws and forces of nature, this couldbe you, the eagle-beast of Revelation, soaring to places ordinary mortals canonly dream about.Collectively, as the human race fast approaches the new precessional Age ofAquarius, we are facing a crucial and momentous decision: either we evolve inharmony, transcendentally, united as one, in a higher dimension, a greater scaleof being, or we remain fragmented, divided, isolated in time and space, a timid,provincial race dead from the neck up, enslaved by economic obligations, ekingout a meager existence on a sad little planet littered with fossil dinosaurs,dodos, and countless other extinct species.For my money, and for the sake of all around me, I feel strongly inclined to gofor the former option, to follow in the footsteps of the Egyptian high priest.We can do it if we want to. It is basically a state of mind, but one that, asthe concept of the eternal trinity implies, can only manifest through theharmonious interaction of the three fundamental forces of nature: active,passive, and neutral, and in that order. Ordinary thought processes switch fromactive to neutral and back again, endlessly. In this lies our greatest folly,because the genuine passive element is always absent, which means that the mindis never fully receptive, never able to assimilate external data in sufficientquantities to stimulate growth. Remember the pyramid ritual, the opening of themummy’s mouth at the foot of the southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber, alignedto Sirius, star of Isis, the passive force of the trinity. This is alchemy pureand simple, a description of the vital process of opening the mind, of “wakingit up,” so to speak. This, of course, is precisely what genuine and sincereprayer, meditation, and numerous other yogic practices were designed to do—tointroduce the passive element into the processes of mind, without which therecan be no rhythm, no real harmony. So here’s a tip: keep your “sabbath,” yourperiod of “rest”—you can’t be fully in tune with nature without it.Significantly, we need only look to the microcosm, to the evolution of DNA, torealize that the Egyptians themselves must have “sung” like proverbial angels,for the “pyramid ritual” is, in fact, performed repeatedly by all chromosomes,the “minds” of the biomolecular world. When the chromosome is ready to act, itfirst relaxes the tension of one of its two nucleotide chains; that is, itbecomes temporarily passive. This, effectively, opens up the double-helixstructure, causing the paired bases within it to separate, at which point,something quite “magical” occurs. Free nucleotide bases floating around in thesurrounding cyto-plasmic membrane are taken in by the chromosomes. Thechromosome then combines these bases into “triple-octave” units—RNA codons, themicrocosmic equivalent of concepts—and subsequently ejects them again to carryout a specific evolutionary function, which is to act as templates for themanufacture of amino acids, the building blocks of life.And what do all self-respecting, self-replicating cells do with these buildingblocks? They build “pyramids,” of course: living ones, immense, six-dimensionalorganic structures capable of building even greater pyramids . . ."},{"pageContent":"NotesINTRODUCTION1 [07_intro.html#Int1]. P. D. Ouspensky, In Search of the Miraculous, 124.2 [07_intro.html#Int2]. It might be argued that seeing the numbers 7 and 8 asinterchangeable makes the identification of patterns too easy, but I think thatany “natural” configuration that conforms to this universal symmetry, thatcoincides at the key “points of entry,” as it were (for example, points 3, 4, 7,8, 22, 64, and combinations thereof)—musical, geometric, genetic, conceptual—is,I think, valid. So the 838 symbolism of the I Ching, or the “chessboard” groundplan of the Giza Necropolis, is essentially expressing the same principle as the93711 format of the triple-octave “squared,” because the product of each is 64.Similarly the number 64 in the genetic code is obtained, not through an 838format, or 93711, but through 43434—again, with a product of 64. So theseapparently disparate patterns do map one onto another, but only at certaincrucial points. One would not expect exact superimpositions to be visible atevery level, because the universe is continually evolving, constantly in flux.But as long as the various symmetries link in at these main “points of entry”the Hermetic Code is valid. If anything, the fact that the code can be directlylinked to all of these various symmetries—and many others found throughout thenatural world—is compelling evidence of its extraordinary dynamism anduniversality. This is precisely what one would expect of a “theory ofeverything.”3 [07_intro.html#Int3]. Michael Hayes, The Infinite Harmony, 17.CHAPTER 1.
