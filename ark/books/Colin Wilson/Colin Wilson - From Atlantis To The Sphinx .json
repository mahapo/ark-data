The latterwas particularly helpful with astronomical information, while Graham Hancockpatiently printed up spare copies of the typescripts of Fingerprints of the Godsand Keeper of Genesis for me. It was Graham’s uncle Jim Macaulay who lent me theimportant book Time Stands Still by Keith Critchlow, and also introduced me tothe ideas of Anne Macaulay (no relative), who was kind enough to allow me toread her unpublished typescript Science and Gods in Megalithic Britain. Rand andRose Flem-ath allowed me to see their (then) unpublished typescript of When theSky Fell which, in my opinion, solves the problem of the present whereabouts of‘Atlantis’.My old friend Eddie Campbell, for whom I used to write reviews when he wasliterary editor of the London Evening News, lent me André VandenBroeck’s Al-Kemiseveral years ago, and in due course, Schwaller de Lubicz’s American publisher,Ehud Spurling, was able to give me André’s address. He also sent me copies ofall Schwaller’s books in English. (The Temple of Man is unfortunately stillawaiting publication.) Christopher Bamford has also been extremely helpful inproviding me with information on Schwaller—of which, as it turned out, I wasable to use only a fraction in this book. The same is true of the vast amount ofmaterial with which André VandenBroeck provided me, and which I am still hopingto use in some future book. Christopher Dunn has also been unstintingly helpfulin trying to help me find possible answers to Egyptian scientific mysteries.Detective Frank Domingo, of the New York Police Department, also provided mewith valuable information on his facial reconstruction techniques.Paul Roberts was responsible for introducing me to the work of David Frawley onancient India, and my friend Georg Feuerstein sent me the book he co-authoredwith Frawley and Subhash Kak, The Roots of Civilisation.An old acquaintance, Carole Ann Gill, introduced me to the work of ZechariahSitchin. Graham Hancock was able to provide me with Sitchin’s address, andSitchin was kind enough to answer my innumerable questions with kindly patience.I must also thank my old friend Martin Burgess, who proved to be a Sitchindevotee, and who was able to answer my many questions about him.It was Alexander Imich who recommended me to read Forbidden Archaeology, and itsauthor, Michael Cremo, was also kind enough to enter into correspondence.Readers who know Herbert Wendt’s books on palaeontology will note myindebtedness to them in Chapter 6.Other friends who have read parts of the book in typescript form and madevaluable suggestions are Howard Dossor, Maurice Bassett, Ted Brown, Gary Lachmanand Donald Hotson.I am grateful to Mike Hayes for sending me his book The Infinite Harmony, whichhad been lying around my untidy house for six months before I happened to readit, and realised that it provided some of the answers I had been looking for.A casual visit from Frank and Carina Cooper led to my reading of Kevin Kelly’sOut of Control, which arrived with a perfect timeliness which looked remarkablylike synchronicity. But then, the whole writing of this book has involved aseries of synchronicities that left me slightly incredulous."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONMy own part in this quest began in July 1979, when I received a review copy of abook called Serpent in the Sky, by John Anthony West. It was basically a studyof the work of a maverick Egyptologist called Rene Schwaller de Lubicz, and itscentral argument was that Egyptian civilisation—and the Sphinx in particular—wasthousands of years older than historians believe. Schwaller had devoted thelatter part of his life to demonstrating that the ancient Egyptians possessed ‘agrand, interrelated and complete system of knowledge’. The passage that excitedme so much was on page 198:Schwaller de Lubicz observed that the severe erosion of the body of the GreatSphinx at Giza is due to the action of water, not wind and sand.If the single fact of water erosion of the Sphinx could be confirmed, it wouldin itself overthrow all accepted chronologies of the history of civilisation; itwould force a drastic re-evaluation of the assumption of ‘progress’—theassumption upon which the whole of modern education is based. It would bedifficult to find a single, simple question with graver implications. The watererosion of the Sphinx is to history what the convertibility of matter intoenergy is to physics.The problem is that although this final chapter of the book is called ‘Egypt:Heir to Atlantis’, it actually says very little about such a possible link. Themost important comment about this occurs in the Introduction:Following an observation made by Schwaller de Lubicz, it is now possiblevirtually to prove the existence of another, and perhaps greater civilisationante-dating dynastic Egypt—and all other known civilisations—by millennia. Inother words, it is now possible to prove ‘Atlantis’, and simultaneously, thehistorical reality of the Biblical Flood, (I use inverted commas around‘Atlantis’ since it is not the physical location that is at issue here, butrather the existence of a civilisation sufficiently sophisticated andsufficiently ancient to give rise to the legend.)So West was not, in fact, necessarily talking about Plato’s mythical Atlantis,but simply about this possibility that civilisation may be millennia older thanhistorians accept. In which case, there is a sense in which what has been called‘the dreaded A word’ (which entails the instant assumption that its user is amember of the lunatic fringe) may not be necessary at all. We are not talkingabout the fictional Atlantis of Verne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea orConan Doyle’s Maracot Deep, but simply about the possibility that human culturemay be far older than we believe.Now, at the same time as I received Serpent in the Sky, another publisher sentme the reissue of a book called Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, subtitledAdvanced Civilisation in the Ice Age, by Charles Hapgood, a professor of thehistory of science in New England. Like West and Schwaller, Hapgood had alsocome to accept the notion of an ancient civilisation that pre-dated dynasticEgypt. Hapgood had arrived at his conclusion by a completely different route. Hehad studied medieval navigation maps called portolans, and concluded fromcertain of them that they had to be based on far, far older maps, and that theSouth Pole had been mapped in the days before it was covered with ice, possiblyas long ago as 7000 BC—three and a half thousand years before the Great Pyramid.But Hapgood takes great care not to suggest that his ancient maritimecivilisation might be Atlantis, or even to breathe the word.Hapgood’s quest began with the so-called Piri Re’is map, dating back to 1513,which shows the coast of South America and the South Pole—many centuries beforethe latter was discovered. I had heard of the Piri Re’is map via a popularbestseller called The Morning of the Magicians, by Louis Pauwels and JacquesBergier—the book that had started the 'occult boom’ in 1960—as well as in thework of Erich von Daniken: both had tried to use the map to prove that earthmust have been visited by spacemen in the remote past. I was perfectly willingto be open-minded about the possibility—as I still am—but it seemed to me thattheir arguments were simply untenable, and in Daniken’s case, often absurd anddishonest. Now I was interested to learn that the argument for an Ice-Agecivilisation did not depend on ancient astronauts, and that Hapgood’s reasoningwas cautious, sound and logically irrefutable. As far as I could see, he hadproved, once and for all, that there had been a maritime civilisation in thedays before the South Pole was covered with ice.But I had other work to do—for example, writing an enormous Criminal History ofMankind—and pushed aside the whole question of ‘Atlantis’.In the autumn of 1991, I was approached by the Hollywood producer Dino deLaurentiis, who was thinking of making a film about Atlantis, and who wanted totry to give it a realistic historical approach. He and his associate StephenSchwartz commissioned me to write an outline. Naturally, I decided immediatelythat I would base it on John West’s theory.In November 1991 I found myself in Tokyo, taking part in a symposium oncommunication in the twenty-first century. In the Press Club, I spoke about myAtlantis project to some friends, and mentioned Schwaller’s theory that thecivilisation of ancient Egypt was the heir to Atlantis, and that the Sphinxcould date thousands of years earlier than 2400 BC, which is when the pharaohChefren is supposed to have built it. At which point my host, Murray Sayle,remarked that he had recently read a paragraph in the Mainichi News that claimedthere was new evidence to support this view. Naturally, I was excited, and askedhim if he could find me the item. He promised to try, but was unsuccessful.A week later, in the Savage Club in Melbourne, I mentioned the elusive paragraphto Creighton Burns, the ex-editor of the Melbourne Age, who said that he hadalso seen the story about the Sphinx. He tracked it down in a recent issue ofthe Age, and was able to give me a photostat.It was from the Los Angeles Times of 26 October 1991, and read:EGYPT SERVES UP NEW TWIST TO MYSTERY OF THE SPHINXSan Diego, WednesdayNew evidence that Egypt’s Great Sphinx may be twice as old as had been thoughthas triggered a fierce argument between geologists who say that it must be olderand archaeologists who say that such a conclusion contradicts everything we knowabout ancient Egypt.Geologists who presented their results at the Geological Society of AmericaConvention yesterday found that weathering patterns on the monument werecharacteristic of a period far older than had been believed. But archaeologistsand Egyptologists insist that the Sphinx could not be much older because peoplewho lived there earlier could not have built it.Most Egyptologists believe that the Sphinx was built during the reign of the‘Pharaoh’ Kafre [Chefren] in approximately 2500 BC. But scientists who conducteda series of unprecedented studies at the Giza site said their evidence showsthat the Sphinx was already there long before Kafre came to power.The evidence suggests that Kafre simply refurbished the Sphinx.Boston geologist Robert Schoch said his research suggests that the Sphinx datesback to between 5000 BC and 7000 BC. That would make it double the age of theGreat Pyramid and make it the oldest monument in Egypt, he said.But California archaeologist Carol Redmount, who specialises in Egyptianartefacts, said, There’s just no way that could be true.’The people of that region would not have had the technology or the will to havebuilt such a structure thousands of years earlier, she said.Other Egyptologists said that they cannot explain the geological evidence, butthey insist that the theory simply does not match up with the mountains ofarchaelogical research they have carried out in that region. If the geologistsare right, much of what the Egyptologists think they know would have to bewrong.So it seemed that there was evidence, after all, that the Sphinx might be farolder than anyone thought.Back in England I wrote my outline based on Schwaller’s idea in the form of akind of novel, and sent if off to Hollywood. What happened to it then I amuncertain—probably it was handed to half a dozen other script writers toimprove. But it seemed to me that I had succeeded in writing a basicallyrealistic film instead of the usual scenario with Greek temples, white beardedpriests, and beautiful blondes wearing togas like linen bathrobes. And onceagain, I shelved the problem of ‘Atlantis’ in favour of other projects.It was almost two years later, in the autumn of 1993, that I was approached byan old friend, Geoffrey Chessler, who had commissioned one of my earlier books,Starseekers. He was now working for a publisher who specialised in illustratedbooks on ‘occult’ subjects—like Nostradamus—and who wanted to know if I mighthave some suitable suggestion. My mind was a blank, but since I expected to bepassing through London a few days later, I agreed to meet him for dinner at amutually convenient spot, which happened to be a hotel at Gatwick airport. Therewe exchanged various ideas and possibilities, and I casually mentioned myinterest in the Sphinx. Geoffrey was immediately interested, and as I expandedmy ideas—how it seemed to me that Hapgood’s ‘lost civilisation’ would probablyhave a totally different mode of thinking from that of modern man—suggested thatI should write him an outline of a book about it.Now I should explain that, in the late 1960s, I had been asked by an Americanpublisher to write a book about ‘the occult’. The subject had always interestedme, but I was inclined to take it with a pinch of salt. When I asked the adviceof the poet Robert Graves about it, his answer was ‘Don’t’. Yet it was inGraves’s own White Goddess that I found a basic distinction that served as afoundation for the book—between what he called ‘solar knowledge’ and ‘lunarknowledge’. Our modern type of knowledge—rational knowledge—is solar; itoperates with words and concepts, and it fragments the object of knowledge withdissection and analysis. Graves argues that the knowledge system of ancientcivilisations is based upon intuition, which grasps things as a whole.In a story called ‘The Abominable Mr Gunn’, Graves offers a practical example.When he was at school, a fellow pupil named Smilley was able to solve complexmathematical problems merely by looking at them. Asked by the master—Mr Gunn—howhe did this, he replied: ‘It just came to me.’ Mr Gunn disbelieved him; hethought he had simply looked up the answers in the back of the book. WhenSmilley replied that the answer got two of the figures wrong, Mr Gunn sent himto be caned. And he forced him to do his sums ‘the normal way’ until Smilleylost his strange ability.Now it could be objected that Smilley was merely a freak, a prodigy with a mindlike a computer. But this explanation will not suffice. There are certainnumbers called primes, which cannot be divided exactly by any other number—7, 13and 17 are examples. But there is no simple mathematical method of finding outwhether a large number is a prime, except by painfully dividing every smallernumber into it. Even the most powerful computer has to do it this way. Yet inthe nineteenth century, a calculating prodigy was asked whether some vastten-digit number was a prime, and replied after a moment's thought: ‘No, it canbe divided by 241.’Oliver Sacks has described two mentally subnormal twins in a New York asylum whocan sit swapping twenty-figure primes. Scientifically speaking—that is,according to our system of rational ‘solar knowledge’—it cannot be done. Yetcalculating prodigies do it. It is as if their minds hover like a bird above thewhole number field, and see the answer.This can mean only one thing: that although our solar knowledge system seems tous comprehensive and all-sufficient, there must be some other means of obtainingknowledge that achieves its results in a completely different way. The idea isbaffling—like trying to imagine another dimension apart from length, breadth andheight. We know that modern physics posits other dimensions, yet our minds areincapable of conceiving them. Yet we can imagine some tiny, blind, wormlikecreature who is convinced that the world consists of surfaces, and who cannoteven begin to imagine what we mean by height. As offensive as it is to humandignity, we have to recognise that, where knowledge is concerned, we are blind,wormlike creatures.So I had no problem with the notion that Hapgood’s pre-ice Age civilisationmight differ from our own in some absolutely basic manner. I recalled anobservation by the archaeologist Clarent Weiant, to the effect that when theMontagnais Indians of eastern Canada wish to make contact with a distantrelative, they go into a hut in the forest and build up the necessary psychicenergy through meditation: then the relative would hear his voice. And JeanCocteau records that when his friend Professor Pobers went to study the samephenomenon in the West Indies, and asked a woman ‘Why do you address a tree?’,she replied: ‘Because I am poor. If I were rich I would use the telephone.’The implication would seem to be that by using telephones—and the rest of theparaphernalia of ‘solar knowledge’—we have lost some abilities that our remoteancestors took for granted.When I met Geoffrey Chessler at Gatwick airport, I was en route to Melbourneagain, for the annual Literary Festival, after which I intended to meet JohnWest in New York. By total coincidence, West had written to me out of the blue afew weeks earlier, enclosing a magazine with an article he had written about thelatest developments in his investigation—including the facial ‘reconstruction’by Detective Frank Domingo which demonstrated that the face of the Sphinx wasnothing like Chefren’s. We had never had any contact—although I had recentlyreviewed his book The Case for Astrology—and he had no idea I was interested inthe Sphinx. I wrote back immediately, mentioning that I would be in New York ina few weeks’ time, and we arranged to meet.John West proved to be a thin, bespectacled man of immense enthusiasm, andinformation poured out of him in great spurts, like water from a village pump. Ifound that, like all genuine enthusiasts, he was generous with his ideas and histime; there was none of the mistrustfulness that I have occasionally encounteredin people who seem to believe that all other writers are waiting for anopportunity to steal their ideas. He had with him a first ‘rough cut’ of thevideotape of his programme about the Sphinx, and we were able to watch it in thehome of playwright Richard Foreman, who found it as exciting as I did. Later,John came out to dinner with my family—my children had met us in America andwith the writer on ancient megaliths Paul Devereux. We discussed my projectedbook on the Sphinx, and John mentioned that I ought to contact another writer,Graham Hancock, who was also writing a book to prove that civilisation is farolder than we assume. He also threw off another name—Rand Flem-ath—who waswriting a book arguing that Atlantis was situated at the South Pole. This madesense—Hapgood had argued that his ancient maritime civilisation was probablysituated in Antarctica, and, now I thought about it, the idea seemed almostself-evident.And so when I returned to England, I wrote to both Graham Hancock and to RandFlem-ath. I had heard of Graham, because I had seen a television programme abouthis search for the Ark of the Covenant. Now he sent me the vast typescript ofhis book Fingerprints of the Gods, and as soon as I began to read it, I wonderedwhether it would be worth going ahead with my own book on the Sphinx. Graham hadalready gone into the whole question that John West had dealt with in histelevision programme, screened in America soon after I returned.Moreover, Graham also knew all about Rand Flem-ath and his Antarctica theory,and made it virtually the climax of his own book. I had by this time receivedthe typescript of When the Sky Fell by Rand and Rose Flem-ath, and learned thatthey had been inspired by Hapgood’s Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, as well as byhis earlier book Earth’s Shifting Crust, which I lost no time in borrowing fromthe London Library. I was able to play a small part in persuading a Canadianpublisher to accept When the Sky Fell by offering to write an introduction.I was still in two minds about whether it was worth writing my own book. But itseemed to me that there had been such a chain of coincidence and synchronicitysince I first came across Schwaller’s water-weathering theory that it would beabsurd not to persist.During the next few weeks—in January 1994—two more pieces of the jigsaw fellinto place. I received for review a copy of The Orion Mystery by Robert Bauval,and learned of his belief that the pyramid complex at Giza was planned as earlyas 10,450 BC. I was, at this time, still reading Graham Hancock’s vasttypescript, and had not yet reached the section on Bauval. But Bauval’s briefmention of Atlantis led me to comment in my review that his own conclusionsseemed to support the theories of Schwaller and John West. I wrote Bauval aletter telling him that he ought to contact John West, and I sent West a copy ofThe Orion Mystery.Second, I had also succeeded in obtaining my own copy of a book called Al-Kemiby André VandenBroeck, an American artist who had become a student and closefriend of Schwaller de Lubicz in his last years. A couple of years earlier, whenI had been researching Schwaller, my old friend Eddie Campbell (whom I had knownsince he was literary editor of the London Evening News) had lent me the book,but I had found it very hard going. Now I had my own copy, I settled down toreading it slowly and carefully, sometimes reading difficult pages two or threetimes. And as I read on, I became absolutely certain that my own book had to bewritten. For what emerged from Al-Kemi was the certainty that Schwaller believedthat the ancient Egyptians had a completely different knowledge system frommodern man—not simply something like the odd ability to communicate with far-offrelatives by telepathy, but a different way of seeing the universe. And whatcaused me particular excitement was VandenBroeck’s statement that Schwallerbelieved that this different ‘way of seeing’ could somehow make possible agreatly accelerated rate of human evolution.I succeeded in contacting André VandenBroeck, and we launched intocorrespondence by fax. With immense patience, he did his best to explain to memany of the things I had failed to understand. And I contacted Schwaller’sAmerican publisher, Ehud Spurling, who was kind enough to send me the sevenbooks currently in print. These proved to be even more of a headache thanAl-Kemi, yet equally rewarding—particularly the last book, Sacred Science.(Schwaller’s major work, the three-volume Temple of Man, has been translatedinto English but not yet published.) Little by little, I felt I was beginning tounderstand—although at times it was like walking through a pitch-black night litonly by the occasional lightning flash.When it appeared in April 1995, Graham Hancock’s Fingerprints of the Godsclimbed immediately to the top of the British bestseller charts, leaving nodoubt that an enormous number of people are fascinated by this question of apre-ice Age civilisation. But for me this only underlined the question: whatdifference does it make? Whether civilisation is 5000 or 15,000 or 100,000 yearsold can surely make no practical difference to our lives?On the other hand, if we are talking about a different knowledge system, asystem that is as valid as our own and yet unthinkably different in approach,then it could be of unimaginable importance.The kind of knowledge possessed by modern man is essentially fragmented. If somefuture visitors from outer space landed on earth, and found vast empty citiesfull of libraries and museums and planetariums, they would conclude that men ofthe twentieth and twenty-first centuries must have been intellectual giants. Butas their scholars studied our encyclopaedias of science and philosophy andtechnology and every other conceivable subject, they would quickly recognisethat no single mind could even begin to grasp what it was all about. We have noessential knowledge system—no way of seeing the universe as a whole and makingsense of it.But if Schwaller is right, and the ancient Egyptians and their predecessorspossessed some comprehensive knowledge system that offered them a unified viewof the universe and human existence, then the insights of Hapgood and RobertBauval and Graham Hancock would only be a halfway house. The really importantquestion would lie beyond their conviction that civilisation may be thousands ofyears older than we suppose. It would lie in the question: What does it allmean?One implication, according to Schwaller, is that there must be some method ofaccelerating the pace of human evolution. The reason this statement excited meso much was because it has been the underlying theme of all my own work. I hadnoticed, as a child, that at Christmas the whole world seems to be a far richerand more wonderful place than we normally recognise. But of course, what I meantwas that consciousness itself can be far more intense than the everydayconsciousness we accept as ‘normal’. This ‘intenser’ form of consciousness oftenappears accidentally, in moments of relaxation or relief when a crisisdisappears, yet when we experience it, we recognise that it is somehow ‘normal’,merely a different way of seeing things and responding to them. One of the basiccharacteristics of this state of ‘heightened consciousness’ is that it seems toinvolve the proper use of our mental energy, instead of wasting it. Normalconsciousness is like a leaky bucket, or a tyre with a slow puncture. In certainmoods we seem to get the ‘trick’ of closing the leaks, and when that happens,living ceases to be hard work, and turns into a continual glow of satisfactionand anticipation, like the feeling we get when setting out on holiday. Isometimes call this ‘duo-consciousness’, because it depends on being consciousof two realities at once, like a child sitting in front of a warm fire andlistening to the patter of rain on the windows, or the feeling we get lying inbed on a freezing winter morning, when we have to get up in five minutes, andthe bed has never seemed so warm and comfortable.Our personal development depends upon what might be called ‘intensityexperiences’. Such experiences may be pleasant or unpleasant, like theexperiences of Paris in Helen’s arms, or the experience of a soldier under fire;but they certainly have the effect of causing some kind of minor yet permanenttransformation of awareness. Yet it seems a pity that our development dependsupon the chance of having such experiences, when consciousness is a state, not amere product of what happens to us. A cook can make jellies and cakes; acarpenter can make tables and cupboards; a pharmacist can make sleeping draughtsor pick-me-ups. Why should we not be able to make our states of consciousness byunderstanding how they come about?Did the ancients understand this process? I doubt it—at least in the I sense Iam discussing. What I am fairly certain they understood is some I secret ofcosmic harmony and its precise vibrations, which enabled them to feel anintegral part of the world and nature, instead of experiencing the ‘alienation’that Karl Marx declares to be the lot of modern man. Deeper insight into theprocess of conscious evolution depends, to some extent, on having experiencedthe process of alienation and learned how to transform it.What can emerge will emerge as a result of passing beyond alienation, andgrasping once again this ‘ancient knowledge’—which, according to Schwaller, hasbeen long forgotten, although it has been transmitted down the ages in somesymbolic form in the great religions.The aim of this book is to try to grasp once again the nature of this forgottenknowledge."},{"pageContent":"1 EGYPTIAN MYSTERIESAt 4.30 in the morning of 16 March 1993, Graham Hancock and his wife Santhaprepared to scramble up the side of the Great Pyramid. It had to be this earlybecause climbing the Pyramid had been strictly forbidden since 1983, when anincautious tourist broke his neck. Hancock had bribed the guards with $150, butthey refused to stay corrupt, and before he was allowed to climb the Pyramid, hehad to bribe them all over again.The first thing the Hancocks discovered was that climbing the Pyramid was notlike walking up a flight of steps. The sides of the Pyramid are shaped likesteps—and have been since its limestone ‘facing’ vanished centuries ago—but someof them are chest-high. On the other hand, the flat of the step is often onlysix inches deep, which explains why a tourist who overbalances is unlikely tostop until he reaches the bottom. The Pyramid is 203 ‘steps’ high and slopes at52 degrees, so by the time the Hancocks were less than a quarter of the way up,they were winded and exhausted, and ready for a long rest; but this was out ofthe question, since it would be dawn in about an hour, and they would becomevisible to cruising police cars.At the 35th course, they noted that the blocks were particularly huge—eachweighing between 10 and 15 tons—and found themselves wondering why the buildershad decided to put such immense stones so high up the Pyramid, instead ofputting them in the obvious place, near the ground—and saving the smaller blocks(around 6 tons each) for higher up.In fact, now they were actually climbing the Pyramid, they became aware of manymysteries that fail to strike you or me when we look at a postcard of thesepicturesque objects against a blue sky. To begin with, at over six million tons,the Pyramid is the largest edifice ever built by man. It contains more masonrythan all the medieval cathedrals, churches and chapels built in Europe addedtogether. Which raises the question: how did the builders get these massiveblocks up the side of the Pyramid and into place?Imagine that you are a building contractor, and that the Pharaoh has approachedyou to build the Great Pyramid. He hands you the measurements, and explains thatthe four sides of the Pyramid must face north, east, south and west, and thateach side must be 755 feet long, and the height must be 481 feet. (You find outlater that this gives the same ratio as the circumference of a circle to itsradius.) He will provide you with as many blocks as it takes, and with anunlimited number of workmen.This doesn’t sound too difficult. You work out that, in order to meet hisrequirements, the sides will have to slope at an angle of 52 degrees. So youwill start off by laying the first course, consisting of a 755-foot solidsquare, constructed of roughly cubical blocks, with weights varying between 6and 30 tons. The size of the second course must obviously be slightly smaller,with an angle of 52 degrees between the edge of the first course and the edge ofthe second.The stones for the second course have to be manhandled on to the top of thefirst course, but that is easy enough—you build a gently sloping ramp of earthand stone, with wooden planks on top, and each block is heaved up the ramp bytwenty of so workmen hauling on ropes. And when you have finished the secondcourse, you repeat the procedure with the third ...But now you begin to see a problem. As the ramp gets higher, you either have toincrease its slope—which would defeat its purpose—or extend it much furtherback. You quickly calculate that, by the time you have reached the top of thePyramid, the ramp is going to have to be about a mile long, and to containaround three times as much material as the Pyramid itself. Moreover, if the rampis not to collapse under its own weight, it will have to be built of massiveblocks like those used in the Pyramid.The alternative is some kind of lifting gear, rather like a modern crane, butbuilt, of course, of wood. But here the same problem applies. To raise blocksweighing several tons to a height of nearly five hundred feet would require acrane built of several of those gigantic trees found in American forests. Suchtrees do not exist in Egypt, or even in Europe.There is another possibility. Assuming you have plenty of time, you might usesmaller lifting gear, and move it from step to step of the Pyramid, raising eachblock a step at a time. In fact, according to Herodotus, this was the methodused:The pyramid was built in steps, battlement-wise, as it is called, or, accordingto others, altar-wise. After laying the stones for the base, they raised theremaining stones to their places by machines formed of short wooden planks. Thefirst machines raised them from the ground to the top of the first step. On thisthere was another machine, which received the stone upon its arrival, andconveyed it to the second step, whence a third machine advanced it still higher.The notion of raising six-ton blocks with planks sounds difficult enough, butthe idea of manoeuvring such blocks on ledges sometimes only six inches widesounds impossible. Moreover, to move more than two and a half million blocks inthis way, at the rate of 25 a day, would take about 150 years. And if theworkmen were only working part-time, during the season when they did not have totend their farms, it could be twice that period.In fact, in the 1980s, the Japanese had tried to build a smaller replica of theGreat Pyramid as a showpiece. Even with modern equipment, the problem defeatedthem, and it was abandoned.Reluctantly, I suggest, you would tell the Pharaoh to find another constructionengineer, and would go off to seek some simpler project, like building theEmpire State Building or Brooklyn Bridge.And what had led the Hancocks to embark on this risky project? The answer datesback eleven years, when Graham Hancock was an economics journalist in Ethiopia,and went to see the film Raiders of the Lost Ark. It aroused his curiosity aboutthe Ark of the Covenant, the sacred wooden chest lined with gold that theHebrews carried into battle, and which had vanished from history many centuriesbefore Christ. He was intrigued to learn that Ethiopian Christians believed thatthe Ark of the Covenant was preserved in a chapel in the centre of the town ofAxum, near the Red Sea. Scholars and archaeologists—inevitably—dismissed theclaim as absurd. Hancock felt that this attitude was based on arrogance andstupidity, and set out to prove them wrong.What he had to establish was how the Ark of Axum had got from Jerusalem—twelvehundred miles to the north—down to Ethiopia, and what it was doing there.Study of biblical sources convinced him that the Ark had vanished from Solomon’sTemple in Jerusalem in the reign of the bloody and brutal king Manasseh, whooccupied the throne from 687 BC to 642 BC; he had rejected Judaism, and defiledthe Temple by installing a ‘graven image’ of Baal. There seemed every reason tobelieve that the priests had been ordered to remove the Ark by Manasseh. But whyhad it been taken as far as Ethiopia?A vital clue was handed to him by a Jewish scholar, who mentioned that there hadonce been a Jewish temple on the island of Elephantine, in the upper Nile. Thiswas unusual; the Jews had believed that foreign soil was unclean. A visit toElephantine, and the discovery that its temple—now destroyed—had been of exactlythe same dimensions as Solomon’s Temple, convinced Hancock that this had beenthe first major staging post on the journey of the Ark. The Jews had been forcedto move on because of a clash with their Egyptian neighbours, who worshipped aram-headed deity in a nearby temple, and objected to the Hebrew sacrifice oframs. Slowly, Hancock established that the Ark had been moved to Meroe, inSudan, then to the island of Tana Kirkos, on Lake Tana, and finally to Axum.The Sign and the Seal (1992) tells the fascinating story of how Hancock trackeddown the route of the Ark from Jerusalem to Axum. The quest took him to manycountries, including Egypt, and it was there in April 1990 that he succeeded inspending some time alone in the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid. Theexperience deeply impressed him, and his subsequent study of the Pyramid’shistory brought to a head his increasing conviction that the ancient engineerspossessed far more knowledge than has been attributed to them. Far from being—asone authority expressed it—‘technically accomplished primitives’, they seemed topossess a level of scientific accomplishment that we have still not reached.This second visit to the Pyramid in 1993 deepened that conviction. Studying thebaffling yet incredibly precise mathematics of its corridors and chambers, heconcluded that the science that had been responsible for this construction musthave been far, far older than professional Egyptologists will admit. The historybooks tell us that Egyptian civilisation came into existence about 2925 BC, andthat a mere four centuries later, it was building monuments like the Sphinx andthe Giza pyramids. To Hancock this seemed absurd. There had to be some ancient,‘lost’ civilisation that dated back thousands of years earlier.This was a view supported by a guide book he had been using since his firstvisit to Egypt: The Traveller’s Guide to Egypt, by John Anthony West. Thisdiffered from the standard guide books in that it discussed the mysteriesassociated with the pyramids; and temples, a subject more orthodox travelwriters shy away from. And in this book, West had mentioned the view of a highlyunorthodox Egyptologist named R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, to the effect that theSphinx had not been eroded by wind-driven sand, but by water. Schwaller deLubicz had argued that since the Sphinx is protected from the west by its‘enclosure’ wall, and that in any case, it has spent most of its life buried upto its neck in sand, wind erosion is unlikely. But there has obviously been nosignificant rainfall in Egypt for thousands of years—otherwise the Sahara desertwould not exist.Now, according to modern historians, the Sphinx was built at about the same timeas the second Giza pyramid, around 2500 BC, probably by the Pharaoh Chefren, theson (or brother) of Cheops, who is supposed to the builder of the Great Pyramid.This assumption is based on the fact that Chefren’s cartouche—the ‘box’ bearingthe name of the pharaoh—was found on the stela between the paws of the Sphinx.But this view is comparatively recent. In 1900, Sir Gaston Maspero, director ofthe Department of Antiquities in the Cairo Museum, suggested that Chefren simplyexcavated or repaired the Sphinx, which was already old.If, in fact, it is eroded by water, not by sand, it must obviously be a greatdeal older—perhaps thousands of years.What is more, if the Sphinx is older than modern historians believe, the samecould well apply to the Great Pyramid—a thought that had occurred to GrahamHancock after his first visit. He found the idea at once exciting anddisturbing. His academic training inclined him to caution and scepticism. But instudying the Ark of the Covenant, he came upon reference after reference to its‘miraculous’ powers—to strike people dead, to destroy cities, to levelmountains, to cause burns and cancerous tumours. The old monk who claimed to bethe Ark’s present guardian explained that it was wrapped in thick cloths when itwas carried in religious processions—not to protect the Ark, but to protectother people from its powers. It sounded rather like atomic radiation, orperhaps Wilhelm Reich’s ‘orgone energy’. And as he read through every availableprimary source on the Ark, all of which referred to the same powers, Hancockfound himself speculating that it sounded like some kind of ‘device’ or machine.The idea seemed altogether too much like the wilder assertions of that highpriest of the improbable, Erich von Daniken. And it was von Daniken who, inexplaining how the pyramids were built by visitors from outer space, managed tomultiply the weight of the Great Pyramid by five. Hancock had no desire to gethimself classified as a member of the lunatic fringe. Yet everything about theGiza complex deepened his certainty that it had not been built by ‘technicallyaccomplished primitives’.The search for a lost civilisation was to take him on a journey to see the Nazcalines of Peru, the ‘lost’ Inca city of Machu Picchu, Lake Titicaca andTiahuanaco, and the great Aztec temples of Central America. Here again, theevidence—which we shall review later—seemed to point to far greater antiquitythan the guide books assert. He was also intrigued by legends of a white god—orgods—who brought civilisation to South America: he was sometimes calledViracocha, sometimes Quetzalcoatl, sometimes Kukulkan, and he was represented ashaving fair skin and blue eyes—as Osiris was represented in ancient Egyptianstatues. By the time he returned to Egypt, to make that early morning climb ofthe Great Pyramid, the sophistication required to construct these monuments hadconvinced Graham Hancock beyond all doubt either that the civilisation of theIncas and the Aztecs extended back thousands of years earlier than the historybooks claim, or that there had once been an unknown civilisation that has beenlost to history.It was in Canada, while publicising his book The Sign and the Seal—which hadbecome a bestseller—that Graham Hancock met a friend of John Anthony West, andmentioned his admiration for the Traveller’s Guide to Ancient Egypt. Thefriend—writer Paul Roberts—asked: ‘Ah, but have you read his Serpent in theSky?’ Hancock admitted his ignorance. ‘Then take it and read it,’ said Roberts,offering a copy.Serpent in the Sky proved to be as fascinating and as startling as West’sTraveller’s Guide. It was basically a study of the ideas of Schwaller de Lubicz,and the argument was simple. Schwaller had spent fifteen years studying ancientEgyptian monuments, particularly the temple at Luxor, and had concluded that—inWest’s words:Egyptian science, medicine, mathematics and astronomy were all of anexponentially higher order of refinement and sophistication than modern scholarswill acknowledge. The whole of Egyptian civilisation was based upon a completeand precise understanding of universal laws... Moreover, every aspect ofEgyptian knowledge seems to have been complete at the very beginning. Thesciences, artistic and architectural techniques and the hieroglyphic system showvirtually no sign of a period of ‘development’; indeed, many of the achievementsof the earliest dynasties were never surpassed or even equalled later on. Thisastonishing fact is readily admitted by orthodox Egyptologists, but themagnitude of the mystery it poses is skilfully understated, while its manyimplications go unmentioned.West goes on to ask: ‘How does a complex civilisation spring fullblown intobeing? Look at a 1905 automobile and compare it to a modern one. There is nomistaking the process of “development”. But in Egypt there are no parallels.Everything is there right at the start.’ It is rather as if the first motor carwas a modern Rolls-Royce.Then West goes on to drop his bombshell. According to Schwaller, Egyptiancivilisation did not begin—as the history books say—around 3000 BC with thelegendary King Menes. Thousands of years earlier, Egypt was populated bysurvivors of Atlantis, who had crossed a (then fertile) Sahara and settled inthe valley of the Nile. The great temples and pyramids of Egypt are a legacy ofthese survivors.Atlantis ... the very word is enough to make an academic historian bury his headin his hands and groan, ‘Oh no!’ And even though West tries to disinfect it byplacing it in quotation marks, suggesting that he is referring simply to somegreat lost civilisation of the past—but not necessarily in the Atlantic—the nameitself is enough to place anyone who uses it beyond the pale of intellectualrespectability.The fact remains that Schwaller de Lubicz believed that the answer to themystery of Egyptian civilisation lies in the fact that it was founded bysurvivors from the great lost continent which, according to Plato (our solesource), perished about 9500 BC in a volcanic cataclysm. It was these survivorswho built the Sphinx, and who designed—and perhaps even built—the Giza pyramids.And it was Schwaller who led John West to begin his quest for the age of theSphinx by trying to establish whether it was eroded by wind-blown sand or byrainfall.Who precisely was Schwaller de Lubicz, and what right had he to pronounce onsuch matters?René Schwaller was born in Alsace in 1887, into a wealthy bourgeois family. Hisfather was a pharmaceutical chemist, and René spent his childhood dreaming inthe forests, and painting and conducting chemical experiments. From thebeginning, he was equally fascinated by art and science, a combination whosesignificance for his life-work can hardly be underestimated. At the age ofseven, his wife tells us, he received a ‘revelation regarding the nature of thedivine, and seven years later, another illumination regarding the nature ofmatter.’As a teenager he went to Paris to study painting under Matisse. Matisse himselfwas at this time under the influence of the philosopher Henri Bergson, whoemphasised the inadequacy of the intellect to grasp reality—which slips throughit like water through the holes in a fishnet—and again, his own tendency tomistrust ‘mere science’ was reinforced. Yet, typically, he also plunged into thestudy of modern physics, which at the time was undergoing the great revolutionsof Einstein and Planck.He joined the Theosophical Society—its founder, Madame Blavatsky, had died whenhe was four—and was soon delivering lectures and writing articles for itsjournal. In the first of these he paid homage to science, which ‘leads to allprogress, fecundates every activity, nourishes all humanity’, while at the sametime attacking it for its conservatism and nihilism. Yet by nature, Schwallerwas far more hard-headed and pragmatic than the Theosophists. He was settinghimself a difficult task: to undermine rationalism with rational thought.1[../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark1]The next step seems to have been an interest in alchemy, the ‘science’ of thetransmutation of matter, and the pursuit of the ‘philosophers’ stone’. ButSchwaller was not interested in trying to turn lead into gold; he believed—asJung later came to believe—that alchemy is basically a mystical quest whose aimis ‘illumination’, and of which the transmutation of metals is a mereby-product. He soon extended his alchemical studies to stained glass and thegeometry of Gothic cathedrals, convinced that their geometry and measurementsconcealed some secret knowledge of the ancients.The ‘occult’ tradition is based upon the notion that there existed in the past ascience that embraced religion and the arts—including architecture—and that thisknowledge was restricted to a small caste of priests and initiates, and was‘encoded’ by medieval stonemasons in the great Gothic cathedrals. One of theclassic expositions of this idea, The Canon by William Stirling (published in1897) states:From the times of ancient Egypt this law [the Canon] has been a sacred arcanum,only communicated by symbols and parables, the making of which, in the ancientworld, constituted the most important form of literary art; it thereforerequired for its exposition a priestly caste, trained in its use, and the guildsof initiated artists, which existed throughout the world till comparativelyrecent times, were instructed in it. Nowadays, all this has changed...The essence of this art, says Stirling, is ‘working symbolically’.Schwaller was in his early twenties when he met, in the Closerie des Lilas, inMontparnasse, an alchemist who called himself Fulcanelli (and whose real nameseems to have been Champagne) and they discussed the ‘Oeuvre’, the Great Work oftransmutation. Fulcanelli was surrounded by a circle of disciples, who calledthemselves The Brothers of Heliopolis; all were dedicated students of the worksof Nicolas Flamel and Basil Valentinus. They combed the second-hand bookshops ofParis looking for old alchemical texts. In an ancient volume he was cataloguingfor a Paris bookshop, Fulcanelli had come across a six-page manuscript writtenin faded ink, and stole it. It indicated that colour played an important part inthe secret of the alchemists. But Fulcanelli, whose approach to alchemy wasmaterialistic, failed to understand it. Schwaller was able to help him in hisinterpretations. He also showed Fulcanelli his own manuscript on medievalcathedrals, at which Fulcanelli became excited, and offered to help find apublisher. In fact, Fulcanelli borrowed the manuscript for a long time, andeventually stole most of its central insights for his own Mystery of Cathedrals,published in 1925, which has achieved the status of a modern classic.Schwaller had meanwhile become friendly with a French poet—who was also aLithuanian prince—called Luzace de Lubicz Milosz. During the First World War,Schwaller worked as a chemist in the army, and after the war Milosz bestowed onhim a knighthood for services to the Lithuanian people, and the right to add ‘deLubicz’ to his name. (It is not clear what right Milosz had to go aroundbestowing knighthoods.) At this point Schwaller also received the ‘mystic name’AOR. He and Milosz founded a political organisation called Les Veilleurs(‘watchmen’ or ‘vigilant ones’) based upon Schwaller’s notions of élitism, ofwhich Rudolf Hess was at one time a member (as well as of a German magical ordercalled the Thule Society). But Schwaller seems to have grown tired ofinvolvement in politics—recognising, like most mystics, that it is a form ofentrapment—and moved to Suhalia, in Switzerland, to pursue his esoteric studieswith a group of like-minded friends, particularly studies relating to stainedglass. This lasted until 1934, when financial problems led to the dissolution ofthe Suhalia community.By this time, Fulcanelli was dead. According to Schwaller, he had invitedFulcanelli to his home in Grasse, in the south of France, to attempt the magnumopus and they were wholly successful. Convinced that he now knew how to bringabout the alchemical transformation, Fulcanelli returned to Paris and repeatedthe experiment several times—failing each time. The reason, said Schwallerlater, was that he had chosen the right moment and the right conditions for theexperiment, and Fulcanelli was ignorant about such matters. Fulcanelli nowdecided to break the vow of silence he had taken, and to communicate what he hadlearned to his disciples. He ignored Schwaller’s pleas and turned down his offerof renewed financial support in exchange for silence. But he became ill, anddied of gangrene the day before he was going to divulge the ‘secret’ to hisdisciples. Schwaller declared that this was an inevitable consequence ofbreaking the alchemical vow of secrecy.Schwaller spent the next two years on his yacht, apparently at something of aloose end. His wife Isha—who had come to him as a disciple in the early days(drawn to him, she claims, by some telepathic link)—had always been fascinatedby ancient Egypt, but Schwaller had failed to share her interest. Now, in 1936,he allowed himself to be persuaded to go ashore in Alexandria to look at thetomb of Rameses IX. There he was struck by a revelation as he looked at apicture of the pharaoh represented in the form of the hypotenuse of aright-angled triangle whose proportions were 3:4:5, while the upraised armrepresented an additional unit. Clearly, the Egyptians knew about Pythagoras’stheorem centuries before Pythagoras was born. Suddenly, Schwaller realised thatthe wisdom of the medieval craftsmen stretched back to ancient Egypt. For thenext fifteen years, until 1951, he remained in Egypt, studying itstemples—particularly the temple at Luxor. The result was his massive geometricalopus The Temple of Man, in three volumes, and his last book The King ofPharaonic Theocracy, translated into English as Sacred Science.All this will undoubtedly strengthen in the reader’s mind the suspicion thatJohn Anthony West must have been slightly insane—or perhaps only appallinglymisguided—to take Schwaller’s judgement on the erosion of the Sphinx seriously,although in his defence it might be argued that a devotion to mystical ideasdoes not necessarily imply that there was anything wrong with Schwaller’seyesight. In fact, Schwaller’s observation was based upon his conviction—alreadynoted—that Egyptian civilisation had to be thousands of years older than 3000BC, because the knowledge encoded in the temples could not have developed in amere six hundred years. The comment about water erosion was thrown off rathercasually in Sacred Science, and his friend and disciple André VandenBroeck, theauthor of the remarkable memoir Al-Kemi, gathered the impression that Schwallerthought the erosion had occurred when the Sphinx was submerged under the sea.Whatever the misunderstanding, it awakened in West the conviction that watererosion was a notion that could provide the scientific confirmation orrefutation of Schwaller’s theory about Egyptian civilisation.But Schwaller’s significance goes far beyond his theories about the age of theSphinx. After all, there is a sense in which it hardly matters whether theSphinx is five or ten thousand years old. It would certainly be interesting toknow that there was a great civilisation that pre-dated ancient Egypt, butsurely it would make no practical difference to our lives—the kind of differencethat was made by splitting the atom or the invention of the microchip?If Schwaller is correct, such a view represents a total failure to grasp whatlies behind the Egyptian temples and the medieval cathedrals. Hermetic traditionclaims that this knowledge was kept hidden for thousands of years—and why shouldit be kept hidden if it has no practical value?The sceptic will reply: because the ancient priests deceived themselves aboutthe practical value of their religious nonsense—or wished to deceive otherpeople.To which Schwaller would reply: you are wrong. This knowledge is practical. Youwish me to give you an example? Then consider the stained red and blue glass ofChartres cathedral. Scientific analysis has been unable to identify the pigmentsused. This is because there is no pigment. The staining involved an alchemicalprocess which involved liberating the colour from the metals that containedit...(In fact, there is reason to believe that this was the ‘oeuvre’ completed bySchwaller and Fulcanelli at Grasse.)Schwaller was careful to make no such statement in his books. This informationwas passed on verbally to André VandenBroeck in 1960—the year before Schwallerdied, in December 1961. During the final decade of his life, Schwaller lived inretirement in Grasse, not far from Cannes, his name totally unknown to thegeneral public. André VandenBroeck, an American artist living in Bruges, cameupon one of Schwaller’s early books, Symbol and the Symbolic, published in Cairoin 1951, and was instantly fascinated. It seemed to VandenBroeck that Schwallerwas talking about a question that had absorbed him for years: that of preciselywhat art represents.It might simplify the matter it we translate this into musical terms. No one hasany doubt that the music of Beethoven is ‘saying’ more than the music of Lehár.But how would we answer a Martian who asked us: ‘What is it saying?’ Beethovenremarked to Elizabeth Brentano: ‘Those who understand my music must be freedfrom all miseries that others drag around with them. Tell Goethe to listen to mysymphonies, and he will see that I am saying that music is the one incorporealentrance into the higher worlds of knowledge...’ Beethoven had no doubt that hismusic represented knowledge, yet quite clearly it would be impossible to take asingle bar of his music and declare: ‘What this is saying is...’Now, VandenBroeck had been influenced by a friend, Andrew Da Passano, who triedto ‘prove’ the existence of higher states of consciousness by referring to thework of Einstein, Bohr and Heisenberg. VandenBroeck had been reading Russell andWhitehead’s Principia Mathematical and it seemed to him that his own idea aboutknowledge might be expressed in mathematical terms. Most knowledge is a functionof the method you use to achieve it; for example, if you want to know how manypeople there are in a room, you count them, and the knowledge you arrive at is afunction of counting. But, reasoned VandenBroeck, you simply cannot say that the‘higher knowledge’ Beethoven was talking about was arrived at by some ‘method’like counting or reasoning. VandenBroeck felt that this insight was an importantbreakthrough, and he wrote a short paper in which he tried to express thisnotion of a knowledge that precedes method in terms of symbolic logic.Schwaller had begun his book on symbols and symbolism by remarking that thereare two ways of reading ancient religious texts: the ‘exoteric’ and the‘esoteric’. The ‘exoteric’ consists of meanings, which you could look up in adictionary or work of history; but this only serves as a foundation for theesoteric meaning, which Schwaller calls the ‘symbolique’—that is to say, asystem of symbols.Clearly, Schwaller’s ‘symbolic system’ was what VandenBroeck meant by higherknowledge, the knowledge that comes from the depths of the soul, and is notachieved by ‘method’. Yet Schwaller appeared to be saying that this knowledgewas not some religious insight—the equivalent of ‘Love your neighbour’—but ispractical and scientific. VandenBroeck was so excited that he lost no timedriving from Bruges to the south of France, and presenting himself onSchwaller’s doorstep.He found Schwaller living on an impressive country estate that left no doubtthat he had a considerable private income. It was a curious household, made upof the tall, grey-haired, 72-year-old sage, his ‘psychic’ wife Isha, who madeVandenBroeck think of a gypsy fortune teller, and Isha’s two children from aformer marriage, Dr Jean Lamy and his sister Lucie, who had devoted her life tobeing Schwaller’s amanuensis. Isha assumed that VandenBroeck had come there tospeak to her about her ‘occult’ ideas—an understandable mistake, since herhusband was virtually unknown, whereas she—by reason of a skilful novel aboutancient Egypt called Chick Pea—had a considerable reputation.VandenBroeck and his wife were invited to lunch, where Isha continued to assumethat VandenBroeck was there to sit at her feet, and to monopolise theconversation. Yet the few words he managed to exchange with Schwaller convincedVandenBroeck that they were on the same wavelength, and that Schwaller had agreat deal to teach him. He decided to leave Bruges and move to Grasse.On his way back to Bruges, VandenBroeck stopped at Lyon and bought a copy of TheTemple of Man. Although slightly taken aback by the geometrical diagrams,VandenBroeck was soon absorbed in the first volume, which brought him acontinual sense of ‘vistas on to a well-known but forgotten landscape’ ... ‘Wespoke the same language.’Back in Grasse, the VandenBroecks were soon regular visitors in the Schwallerhousehold. It took some weeks as Isha’s student—reading the Chick Pea novels,and listening to her reading from her latest opus, a work of ‘esotericfiction’—before his sense of her ‘gentle imposure’, and his inborn distaste for‘spiritual’ mumbo-jumbo led him to detach himself tactfully and spend more timewith Schwaller (whom everyone addressed as ‘Aor’.)There was also in Schwaller ‘a grey zone of speculation where true and false didnot apply’—for example, in his conviction that mankind has not evolved, but‘devolved’, from ‘giants who once walked the earth to a near-animal state ...vowed to cataclysmic annihilation, while an evolving élite gathers all of humanexperience for a resurrection in spirituality.’ Schwaller was also convincedthat the Nile is a man-made river, deliberately directed into the Nile valley,to form the basis of Egyptian civilisation. But VandenBroeck felt that he couldtake or leave such beliefs. Far more important was Schwaller’s insight into thenature of the knowledge system of the ancient Egyptians. This was also élitistin conception: ‘at its head, the enlightened priesthood, the perfect identity ofscience and theology, its main duties cognition of the present moment.’ ThisSchwaller saw as the ‘Absolute from which we constantly draw our power’.This notion is central to Schwaller’s ideas, perhaps their most significantfeature. One way of explaining it would be to say that human beings imagine theylive in the present, yet their basic mental state might be described as‘elsewhereness’, like a schoolboy looking out of a window instead of payingattention to the lesson. It is, in fact, incredibly difficult to be ‘present’,since we live in an interpreted world. We cannot even ‘see’ withoutpreconception—‘that is so and so’. Our most basic frame of mind is that ofspectators; we look out at the world like someone in a cinema. When a manawakens to present reality—as Dostoevsky did when stood in front of a firingsquad—the whole world changes. Everything suddenly becomes real. But his visionof himself also changes: he becomes aware of himself as a dynamic force ratherthan as a passive entity.This, VandenBroeck discovered, is also the essence of Schwaller’s notion ofalchemy. Alchemy, according to Schwaller, is derived from Kemi, the Greek wordfor Egypt, with the Arabic ‘al’ appended. In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh, thegod-king, was the symbol of this ‘absolute from which we draw our power’. Andalchemy, or the transmutation of matter into spirit—of which the transmutationof base metals into gold is a mere by-product—depends upon this ‘moment ofpower’, of being wholly present in the present moment. He seems to be speakingof what Shaw once called ‘the seventh degree of concentration’.Schwaller dismisses Jung’s notion of alchemy as a modern intellectual fashion.Jung thought that the true aim of alchemy was the state he called‘individuation’, unity of being, but that in trying to achieve this, thealchemist ‘projects’ his own visions into external reality—in other words, seeshallucinations. One text describes how, when seven pieces of metal are heated ina crucible with a fragment of the philosophers’ stone, fire will fill the roomand the starry firmament will appear overhead. Jung believed that the alchemist‘projects’ such visions as if, without knowing it, he is a cinema projectionist.Schwaller rejected this with scorn. Alchemy, he told VandenBroeck, depends onlaboratory results. These results, he seems to imply, are achieved ultimately bya kind of mind-over-matter. As VandenBroeck expresses it:There could be no other than this unique act of total apprehension beyond wordswhich is knowledge itself, where the particular disappears and only the greatestgenerality remains, stark and devoid of content. In this utter silence wordswould form meanings in the most natural fashion, without our interference. Herethe universe would speak, not the cerebral cortex. This is the act, the state ofknowledge. There is no referent for knowledge. Knowledge is knowledge in itself,it is primitive, and cannot refer to a previous self.In other words, it is total objectivity, an escape from the shadow-house ofpersonality.What Schwaller is talking about, in short, is a different kind of knowledge. InThe White Goddess, Robert Graves speaks about ‘lunar’ and ‘solar’ knowledge. Ourmodern type of knowledge—rational knowledge—is ‘solar’; it operates with wordsand concepts, and it fragments the object of knowledge with dissection andanalysis. But ancient civilisations had ‘lunar’ knowledge, an intuitiveknowledge that grasped things as a whole.What is at issue might be made clearer by a reference to another ‘esoteric’thinker of the twentieth century, George Ivanovich Gurdjieff. In 1914, Gurdjiefftold his disciple Ouspensky that there is a fundamental difference between ‘realart’ and ‘subjective art’. Real art is not just an expression of the artist'sfeelings; it is as objective as mathematics, and will always produce the sameimpression on everyone who sees it.The great Sphinx in Egypt is such a work of art, as well as some historicallyknown works of architecture, certain statues of gods, and many other things.There are figures of gods and of various mythological beings that can be readlike books, only not with the mind but with the emotions, providing they aresufficiently developed. In the course of our travels in Central Asia we found,in the desert at the foot of the Hindu Kush, a strange figure which we thoughtat first was some ancient god or devil. At first it produced upon us simply theimpression of being a curiosity. But after a while we began to feel that thisfigure contained many things, a big, complete and complex system of cosmology.And slowly, step by step, we began to decipher this system. It was in the bodyof the figure, in its legs, in its arms, in its head, in its eyes, in its ears;everywhere. In the whole statue there was nothing accidental, nothing withoutmeaning. And gradually we understood the aim of the people who built thisstatue. We began to feel their thoughts, their feelings. Some of us thought thatwe saw their faces, heard their voices. At all events, we grasped the meaning ofwhat they wanted to convey to us across thousands of years, and not only themeaning, but all the feelings and the emotions connected with it as well. Thatindeed was art!2 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark2]According to Schwaller, this is precisely what the Egyptians were aiming at intheir temples, monuments and statues.In A New Model of the Universe, a book written after he had become Gurdjieff’sdisciple, Ouspensky had written of the Sphinx: ‘As a matter of fact the Sphinxis older than historical Egypt, older than her gods, older than the pyramids,which, in their turn, are much older than is thought.’ This sounds like a pieceof information acquired direct from Gurdjieff.But how could a work of art make the same impact on everybody—even if theiremotions are ‘sufficiently developed’? Surely art appeals to what is ‘personal’in us?To understand why this is not so, it is necessary to speak of the founder ofGreek mathematics, Pythagoras, who lived between 582 and 507 BC. According to atypical entry in a modern encyclopaedia, Pythagoras believed in reincarnation,and ‘Pythagoreans believed that the essence of all things was number and thatall relationships could be expressed numerically. This view led them to discoverthe numerical relationship of tones in music and to some knowledge of laterEuclidean geometry.’3 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark3] Pythagoreanism issometimes described as ‘number mysticism’, and the mathematician Lancelot Hogbendismissed all such notions as the ‘dark superstitions and fanciful puerilitieswhich entranced people who were living through the childhood of civilisation’.4[../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark4]But that is to miss the point. The Pythagoreans were entranced by such things asthe shape of crystals and the patterns made by frost. They suspected, rightly,that there is a mathematical reason for this. Again, consider the fact thatwomen have two breasts, and that in female animals, the number of teats isalways a multiple of two, never an odd number. Again, the Pythagoreans suspectedthat the processes of living nature are governed by mathematical laws, and theywere right.Let us return to an earlier question: what is music ‘saying’? Why do certainmusical phrases fill us with a curious delight? Around 1910, a Viennese composernamed Arnold Schoenberg decided that, since he could see no obvious answer tothe problem of why music touches our feelings, the answer must lie in the word'habit’—or conditioning. Schoenberg decided that he would create a differenttone scale, and write music that was based on a number of notes arranged inarbitrarily chosen order—rather than one that ‘appeals’ to the ear. But heproved mistaken in his assumption that music is ‘arbitrary’. Almost a centurylater, his works and those of his disciples still sound strange anddissonant—although their dissonance is undeniably successful in expressingneurosis and tension—and their inclusion in a modern concert programme is enoughto guarantee a decline in ticket sales. Any Pythagorean could have told him thathis theory was based on a fallacy—a failure to grasp that there is a hiddenmathematical reason why a certain order of notes strikes us as harmonious, andwhy arbitrary notes fail to convey a sense of musical meaning.It is when the same insights are applied to the realm of living things that webegin to grasp the essence of Egyptian thought. Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001popularised the idea that a computer might develop human feelings; and, in fact,many computer scientists argue that a sufficiently complex computer would bealive—that if it was complex enough to behave like a living thing, then by anysensible definition it would be a living thing. In The Emperor's New Mind,Oxford scientist Roger Penrose expended a great deal of ingenuity indemonstrating that this is a fallacy—that even if a computer was more complexthan a human being, it would still not be ‘alive’.Most biologists now accept the view that life evolved accidentally with theaction of sunlight on carbon compounds: that these compounds ‘accidentally’built up into cells that could reproduce themselves, and that these cells werethe first sign of ‘life’ on earth. Penrose’s arguments about computers applyequally to this theory. No matter how complex an arrangement of carbonmolecules, it would still not be alive.The Egyptians would have found these ideas about ‘living’ computers and carbonmolecules unutterably perverse. For them there were two distinct realities:matter and spirit. In living beings the two interact, and the laws that governthe interaction are mathematical. It is not meaningless to ask why carrots arelong and pointed, and melons are round, and marrows are long and round. Lifeobeys unknown mathematical laws.Gurdjieff also attached great importance to the concept of alchemy. In his majorwork, Beelzebub’s Tales to his Grandson, he explains that what is generallycalled alchemy is a pseudo-science, but that there was—and is—a genuine alchemy,a ‘great science’, that was known to the ancients before man began todegenerate.It may also be noted that, in Beelzebub’s Tales, Gurdjieff makes Beelzebub—ahigher being from a solar system in the Milky Way—explain that Egypt wasoriginally populated by survivors from Atlantis, which was destroyed in twocataclysms, and that the Sphinx and the Giza pyramids were built by theAtlanteans. (Beelzebub, it should be noted, was written before Schwallerdiscovered ancient Egypt, so there was no mutual influence.) Some time later,around the time of dynastic Egypt, there occurred a spiritual 'cataclysm’ thatcaused mankind to degenerate to a lower level. Man began to believe that thematerial world is the only reality, and that the spiritual is a mere reflectionof the material. This would seem to echo Schwaller’s conviction that mankind hasdegenerated from ‘giants ... to a near-animal state’.It seems ironic that Schwaller’s interest in the age of the Sphinx—and the othergreat Egyptian monuments—was virtually a by-product of his interest in‘alchemy’, and its bearing on human evolution. What he believed he had found inancient Egypt was a completely new mode of thought—a mode that cannot beexpressed in the analytical concepts of language, but only shown in myth andsymbolism.This knowledge also involved a highly sophisticated technology, capable of suchincredible feats as moving 200-ton blocks (used in building the Sphinx temples)and placing them on top of one another.In short, Schwaller believed that ancient Egypt possessed a knowledge systemthat had been inherited from a far older civilisation, whose modes of thoughtwere fundamentally different from those of modern man. The secret of thisknowledge system he believed lay in ancient Egypt.It was probably because Schwaller was anxious not to undermine the reputation ofhis mathematical studies on the temple of Luxor that he took care not to be toospecific about his view of the age of the Sphinx.But in Sacred Science, in the chapter in which he discusses the legends ofEgyptian prehistory, he speaks about ancient traditions that refer to the daysbefore the Nile delta existed—before, that is, the Nile had brought down thebillions of tons of mud that now form the delta. He continues:A great civilisation must have preceded the vast movements of water that passedover Egypt, which leads us to assume that the Sphinx already existed, sculpturedin the rock of the west cliff at Gizeh, that Sphinx whose leonine body, exceptfor the head, shows indisputable signs of aquatic erosion.He goes on to say: ‘We have no idea how the submersion of the Sphinx tookplace...’, which seems to make it plain that he is thinking in terms of a Sphinxsubmerged beneath the sea. But when he read these sentences, John Anthony Westwas struck by the obvious fact that this notion—of erosion by water—ought to bescientifically testable. He expressed this conviction in 1978, in Serpent in theSky, his study of Schwaller and ancient Egypt. During the next decade, he triedto interest scholars in the problem. For example, he asked an Oxford geologistif he would mind if he played a trick on him, then showed him a photograph ofthe Sphinx in which the head and other identifying features had been hidden bymasking tape, so that it looked like a fragment off cliff. ‘Would you say thisis wind-erosion or water erosion?’ The geologist said without hesitation: ‘Watererosion.’ Then West stripped off the tape, revealing the head and the paws. Thegeologist stared at it and said: ‘Oh.’ And after more reflection he added: ‘Idon’t want to say any more. You see, I’m not a desert specialist.’ Otherscientists to whom West wrote did not even reply.It was several years more before he found a geologist who was sufficientlyopen-minded to go and look at the Sphinx. It was the beginning of an importantnew phase in the search for Atlantis."},{"pageContent":"2 THE NEW RACEThe problem of finding an open-minded scientist, West has remarked (withunderstandable bitterness), is about as easy as finding a fundamentalistChristian who loves Madonna. But in 1985, a friend at Boston Universityremarked: ‘I think I might know someone.’The 'someone’ was Robert Schoch, a geologist at Boston University, and his entryin Who’s Who made it clear that he would be the ideal supporter. Although stillin his twenties, he had published four books, and was a highly respectedstratigrapher—a geologist who studies layers of sedimentary rock—andpalaeontologist. But to begin with, it looked as if he was going to be asevasive as the Oxford geologist. West was advised not to try approaching himdirectly in case he scared him off. Periodically, reports came back: Schoch hadbeen approached, Schoch was willing to look at the material, Schoch’s firstreaction had been scepticism... Eventually, after studying all the material Westcould muster, Schoch began to express a cautious interest. But he was up fortenure, and it would have been insane to jeopardise this by espousing an opinionthat would be sure to enrage his academic colleagues. Years went by with theseoccasional reports, until, at last, West travelled to Boston to meet him.He had taken a boxful of slides, and when they had looked at them, and they haddiscussed the whole question, Schoch admitted what was worrying him. 'From thephotograph, it looks like water weathering. It looks so obvious. If you’reright, I can’t believe that no one would have noticed it before.’Clearly, he would have to go to Egypt to see for himself. But that would have towait until he had tenure.That finally came in April 1990. Two months later they were in Cairo. West wasin a state of tension as they approached the Giza site, half-expecting Schoch topoint out some geological gaffe that would destroy his whole theory. But Schochseemed quietly impressed. At first sight, he could see nothing that underminedWest’s belief in water-weathering. The Sphinx enclosure—the walls of limestonethat surrounded the Sphinx on two sides—certainly showed the typical undulatingpattern of rain weathering. But he felt that he needed a more detailed study,together with the aid of a geophysicist, as well as up-to-date seismographicequipment.It seems probable that the original rock that formed the head of the Sphinx wasan outcrop that once rose above the ground beside the Nile. Schoch theorisedthat it may have been carved into some kind of face—either human or animal (suchas a lion) at some remote date when the surrounding countryside was still green.Then, at some later date, it was decided to add a body. For this purpose, itsmakers sliced into the softer limestone below and around the head—creating atwo-sided wall or enclosure—thus giving themselves elbow room to work. The greatblocks they removed—200 tons each—were used to construct two temples in front ofthe Sphinx. These ancient architects worked in a style that might be called‘Cyclopean’, using absurdly large blocks—which could far more conveniently havebeen carved into a dozen smaller ones—and erecting them into structures assimple and undecorated as Stonehenge.The next step was to hack out roughly the chunk of rock that would form the bodyof the Sphinx—which would eventually be 240 feet long, and 66 feet high, as tallas a six-storey building. From the point of view of posterity, it is a pity thatthe whole Sphinx was not carved out of the same type of rock, for the limestonebody has eroded far more than the harder head and shoulders. The present damageto the Sphinx's head was done in 1380, by a fanatical Arab sheikh, and later bythe Mamelukes, who used it for target practice.And what evidence have we about the age of the Sphinx? Oddly enough, it is notmentioned by Herodotus, and so we must assume either that it was covered withsand when Herodotus visited Egypt around 450 BC, or that the outcrop of badlyeroded rock sticking up above the surface bore so little resemblance to a facethat he did not even notice it.When the sand—which buried it up to its neck—was cleared away in 1817, a smalltemple was revealed between the paws. This contained the statue of a lion andthree stelae; the one against the Sphinx’s breast bore the date of King ThutmoseIV, who came to the throne in 1425 BC. The main stela told how King Thutmose IVhad fallen asleep near the Sphinx when out hunting, and how the Sphinx—who wasinhabited by the god Khepera (a form of the sun god Ra), creator of theuniverse—spoke to him in a dream and asked him to clear away the sand thatburied him. Thutmose not only cleared away the sand, but made extensive repairsto the body. Apparently this was not the first time; the same stela bore thename of the Pharaoh Chefren—although its surrounding writing was flaked away, sothat its significance was not clear. Sir Gaston Maspero assumed that Chefren hadalso performed the same service of clearing the sand, and possibly repaired theSphinx—the rear of the Sphinx contains repairs that have been dated to the OldKingdom, which lasted about 450 years (2575-2130 BC).But this obviously raises a basic question. If the Sphinx was built by Chefrenaround 2500 BC, then why should it need repairs in the course of the next threeand a half centuries? It was well protected, and was no doubt buried in sandmost of the time since it was built. Dr Zahi Hawass, the keeper of the CairoMuseum and a bitter opponent of West’s theory, was to argue that the limestoneof which the Sphinx was built was so poor that it began to erode as soon as themonument was completed. West’s reply was that this would involve erosion at therate of a foot every hundred years, and that if that was the case, the Sphinxwould have vanished completely about five centuries ago.On the other hand, if Maspero was correct, then Chefren had merely repaired theSphinx and cleared away the sand; Maspero actually stated that this was proofthat ‘the Sphinx was already covered with sand during the time of Khufu [Cheops]and his predecessors’. In fact, it was a commonplace among nineteenth-centryEgyptologists to state that the Sphinx was far, far older than the pyramids. Ithas only been during the twentieth century, on the evidence of the name ofChefren on the stela of Thutmose IV, that Egyptologists have decided that theSphinx was built by Chefren, and that its head is supposed to be a portrait ofChefren. They have reached that conclusion on precisely the same evidence thatmade Maspero decide the Sphinx was far older than the pyramids.Another obvious question arises. Most of the Sphinx—as already stated—is belowground level, so it would have been clear to its builder that it would soon beburied in sand. (It seems to take about twenty years.) Does this not suggestthat, when the Sphinx was built, the Sahara was still green, which would explainhow the Sphinx came to be eroded by rainfall? We know that the Sahara was oncegreen and fertile, and that it has been slowly eroded over the millennia. No oneis certain when it was last green, but a conservative guess is 3500 BC.It is, of course, even possible that it was still green in the time of Chefren;1[../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark5] but then, even if it was built by Chefren in agreen Sahara in 2500 BC, this still fails to explain why it needed repairs sosoon.Now West had the task of trying to prove that Maspero and the othernineteenth-century scholars had been right, and that the Sphinx was already oldin the time of Chefren. If he could prove that the body of the Sphinx, and theSphinx enclosure, had been eroded by water, not by wind-blown sand, then hewould certainly have taken a major step in that direction. His first task wouldbe to set about finding the necessary finance to take a team of experts to lookat it. Boris Said, a maker of videos, coordinated the project, and Thomas L.Dobecki, a geophysicist, also signed on, with two geologists, an architect andan oceanographer. After an interminable struggle to persuade the authorities togrant permission, they were finally ready to start.Now that Schoch could study it all at close quarters, his doubts vanished. Ifthe Sphinx was the same age as the rest of the Giza site, why was it soweathered, when nearby Old Kingdom tombs were so much less weathered—and, whatis more, so obviously weathered by wind-blown sand? Surely the Sphinx had to beolder?The wind-weathering on these other tombs provided a convenient comparison.Limestone is a sedimentary rock, made of particles glued together; and, aseveryone knows, such rocks come in strata, like layer cake. When wind-blown sandhits the side of the layer cake, the softer layers are worn away, while theharder layers stick out above and below them. The result is a series of parallellayers, with a profile of humps and hollows like the profile of a club sandwich.When a rock face is eroded by rain water, the effect is totally different. Therain runs down in streams, and cuts vertical channels into the rock. The softerrock is still eroded more deeply than the harder, but the effect is quitedistinct from wind-weathering—it can look like a series of bumps, not unlike arow of naked buttocks. The team agreed that both the body of the Sphinx and theSphinx enclosure showed this type of weathering, not the smoother effect ofwind-weathering.The two temples in front of the Sphinx—known as the Valley and the SphinxTemples—provided additional evidence for this thesis. If, of course, they hadbeen left untouched, they should have exhibited precisely the same weathering asthe Sphinx and its enclosure. But there is clear evidence that they wererepaired by the ancient Egyptians, who set out to prevent further damage byfacing them with granite slabs. Many of these granite slabs were removed bylater generations, who used them in their own building. And the outer walls leftexposed by this removal are so irregular that any self-respecting architectwould blush with shame.What happened seems clear. These walls were deeply weathered, like the Sphinx,but so that they could be repaired, they were cut back to provide convenientflat surfaces. Since they were going to be covered up with granite, it wasunimportant if they looked a mess.In fact, where the granite facing has been removed, these limestone blocks showthe same undulatory weathering as the Sphinx and its enclosure. The rear sidesof some of the granite facing-slabs have even been carved into an undulatorypattern to fit the eroded limestone. Again, it looks as if the people whorepaired the temples found them deeply water-eroded—a relic of the earlier'Cyclopean’ age, standing alone, except for the Sphinx, on an empty plateau.These temples in front of the Sphinx raised another problem that has beenignored by orthodox Egyptologists. As already noted, their architecture is quiteunlike that of most Egyptian temples, with their cylindrical columns and wealthof carvings. Here there are simply bleak rectangular pillars surmounted bysimilar blocks, bare and uncarved, as if they belonged to a completely differentepoch from the great Egyptian temples.Again, why had the ancient builders chosen to build the Sphinx temples of blocksweighing 200 tons each? The explanation that suggests itself is that, like theSphinx, the temples were regarded as so sacred that anything smaller would havebeen an insult to the god for whom they were raised. King Thutmose dreamed thatthe ‘god’ who inhabited the Sphinx was Khepera, creator of the universe andfather of all the other gods. If this was true, then it was certainlyappropriate that the Valley and Sphinx temples should be plain and bare.Finally, there was the most baffling question of all: how had the builderssucceeded in moving and raising 200-ton blocks? West consulted various modernengineers with experience in building huge structures; they admitted to beingbaffled. Graham Hancock's research assistant learned that there are only threecranes in the world big enough to move such blocks.What does that suggest? This, at least, is undeniable: that whoever carved theSphinx and built the two temples possessed some highly sophisticated technology.Even the Great Pyramid contains no such blocks. The conclusion would seem to bethat if the Sphinx and its temples were built centuries—or perhaps thousands ofyears—earlier than Cheops and Chefren, the builders were more, and not less,technically accomplished.This brings us to another question about the ‘know-how’ of these ancient people.In 1893, Flinders Petrie had excavated the village of Naqada, 300 miles south ofCairo, and found pottery and vases that revealed a high level of skill. Thepottery showed none of the striated marks that would indicate a potter’s wheel,yet were so perfectly rounded that it was hard to believe they were made byhand. The level of workmanship led him to assume that they must date from the11th Dynasty, around 2000 BC. They seemed so un-Egyptian that he called theircreators ‘the New Race’. When some of these ‘New Race’ vases were found in tombsof the 1st Dynasty, dating from about a thousand years earlier, he was sobewildered that he dropped the Naqada vase from his chronology, on the principlethat what you cannot explain you had better ignore. In fact, the Naqadans weredescendants of Palaeolithic peoples from North Africa who began raising crops(in small areas) some time after 5000 BC. They buried their dead in shallow pitsfacing towards the west, and seem to have been a typical primitive culture ofaround the fourth millennium. But the vases that puzzled Petrie seemed toosophisticated to have been made by primitives.When he examined the great red granite sarcophagus that was found in the King’sChamber of the Great Pyramid (of which there will be more in the next chapter),Petrie found himself once again puzzling about ancient craftsmen. It seemed topresent insuperable technical problems. Measurement revealed that its externalvolume—2,332.8 litres—is precisely twice that of its internal volume. That meantcutting with incredible precision. But with what tools? Flinders Petrie thoughtthat it must have been sawn out of a larger block with saws ‘eight feet or morein length’. Such saws, he thought, would have to be made of bronze set withdiamonds. No one has ever seen such a saw, and no ancient text describes it, butPetrie could see no other solution.But what tools were used to hollow out its inside? Petrie makes theextraordinary suggestion that the ancient Egyptians had created some kind ofcircular—or rather tubular—saw which ‘drilled out a circular groove by itsrotation’. This notion of tubular saws with diamonds somehow inserted into thepoints sounds like science fiction. And even if such saws could have beenmade—and the diamonds set so firmly that they did not shoot out when the saw wasused, or get driven back into the bronze that held them—how did the Egyptiansmake them ‘spin’? We assume that, at this early stage of technology, drills hadto be ‘spun’ by hand—or perhaps with a bowstring wound around the shaft. Itsounds, quite simply, impossible.Petrie also speaks about granite slabs and diorite bowls incised with quiteprecise inscriptions. The characters, says Petrie, are not ‘scraped or groundout, but are ploughed through the diorite, with rough edges to the line’.Diorite, like granite, is incredibly hard.Graham Hancock had also seen various kinds of vessels of diorite, basalt andquartz, some dating from centuries before the time of Cheops, neatly hollowedout by some unknown technique. The most baffling of all were ‘tall vases withlong, thin, elegant necks and finely flared interiors, often incorporating fullyhollowed-out shoulders’. (More than 30,000 were found beneath the Step Pyramidof Zoser at Saqqara.) The necks are far too thin to admit a human hand—even achild’s—some too narrow even to admit a little finger, Hancock points out thateven a modern stone carver, working with tungsten-carbide drills, would beunable to match them, and concludes that the Egyptians must have possessed sometool that is totally unknown to, and unsuspected by, Egyptologists. It sounds,admittedly, too preposterous to suggest that they had some kind of electricdrill. Yet when we consider Petrie’s comment about grooves ‘ploughed through thediorite’, it seems obvious that they must have had some means of making the bitspin at a tremendous speed. A potter’s wheel, with suitable ‘gears’, might justdo it.In fact, a modern toolmaker, Christopher P. Dunn, studied Petrie’s book in anattempt to make sense of his descriptions, and in an article called ‘AdvancedMachining in Ancient Egypt’, reached some astonishing conclusions. He comments:The millions of tons of rock that the Egyptians had quarried for their pyramidsand temples—and cut with such superb accuracy reveal glimpses of a civilisationthat was technically more advanced than is generally believed. Even though it isthought that millions of tons of rock were cut with simple primitive hand tools,such as copper chisels, adzes and wooden mallets, substantial evidence showsthat this is simply not the case. Even discounting the argument thatwork-hardened copper would not be suitable for cutting igneous rock, otherevidence forces us to look a little harder, and more objectively, whenexplaining the manufacturing marks scoured on ancient granite by ancient stonecraftsmen.He discusses the puzzle of how these craftsmen cut the 43 giant granite beams,weighing between 45 and 70 tons each, and used in the King’s Chamber.Although the Egyptians are not given credit for the simple wheel,2[../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark6] the machine marks they left on the granite foundat Giza suggests a much higher degree of technical accomplishment. Petrie’sconclusion regarding their mechanical abilities shows a proficiency with thestraight saw, circular saw, tube-drill and, surprisingly, even the lathe.He goes on to mention the two diorite bowls in Petrie’s collection which Petriebelieved must have been turned on a lathe, because they could ‘not be producedby any grinding or rubbing process’. Petrie had detected a roughness in one ofthe bowls, and found that it was where two radii intersected, as if a machinisthad failed to ‘centre’ the bowl correctly on the lathe, and had re-centred itmore precisely.Examining blocks that had been hollowed out—with some kind of drill—in theValley Temple, Dunn states that the drill marks left in the hole show that itwas cutting into the rock at a rate of a tenth of an inch for every revolutionof the drill, and points out that such a phenomenal rate could not be achievedby hand. (Petrie thought it could, but only by applying a pressure of more thana ton on the drill—it is not clear how this tould be achieved.) An Illinois firmthat specialises in drilling granite told Dunn that their drills—spinning at therate of 900 revs per minute—only cut into it at one ten thousandth of an inchper revolution, so in theory the ancient Egyptians must have been using a drillthat worked 500 times faster than a modern drill.Another aspect of the problem began to provide Dunn with a glimmer of asolution. A hole drilled into a rock that was a mixture of quartz and feldsparshowed that the ‘drill’ had cut faster through the quartz than the feldspar,although quartz is harder than feldspar. The solution that he suggests soundsalmost beyond belief. He points out that modern ultrasonic machining uses a toolthat depends on vibration. A jackhammer used by navvies employs the sameprinciple—a hammer that goes up and down at a tremendous speed, raining hundredsof blows per minute on the surface that has to be broken. So does a pneumaticdrill. An ultrasonic tool bit vibrates thousands of times faster.Quartz crystals are used in the production of ultrasonic sound, and conversely,respond to ultrasonic vibration. This would explain why the ‘bit’ cut fasterthrough the quartz than the feldspar.What is being suggested sounds, admittedly, absurd: that the Egyptians had someforce as powerful as our modern electricity, and that this force was based onsound. We all know the story of Caruso breaking a glass by singing a certainnote at high volume. We can also see that if a pointed drill was attached to oneof the prongs of a giant tuning fork, it could, in theory, cut into a piece ofgranite as easily as a modern rotating drill. Dunn is suggesting, in effect, atechnology based on high-frequency sound. But I must admit that precisely howthis force could have been used to drive the 9-foot bronze saw blade that cutthe sarcophagus in the King’s Chamber eludes my comprehension. Possibly somereader with a more technically-oriented imagination can think up a solution.Unfortunately, the vibration theory fails to explain Dunn’s observation aboutthe drill rotating five hundred times as fast as a modern drill. We must assumethat, if he is correct, the Egyptians knew how to use both principles.In the course of making a television programme, Christoper Dunn demonstrated theincredible technical achievement of the Egyptian engineers to another engineer,Robert Bauval, by producing a metal instrument used by engineers to determinethat a metal surface has been machined to an accuracy of a thousandth of aninch, and holding it against the side of the benben stone in the Cairo Museum.He then applied the usual test—shining an electric torch against one side of themetal, and looking on the other side to see if any gleam of light could be seen.There was none whatever. Fascinated by the test, Bauval took him to the Serapeumat Saqqara, where the sacred bulls were entombed in giant sarcophagi made ofbasalt. These proved to have the same incredible accuracy. Why, Bauval asked mewhen telling me about all this, should the ancient Egyptians have neededaccuracy to the thousandth of an inch for a sarcophagus? Moreover, how did theyachieve it without modern engineering techniques?The notion of ultrasonic drills at least provides a possible answer to theotherwise insoluble riddle of Hancock’s swan-necked vases into which it wasimpossible to insert a little finger. Dunn says that the technique is used ‘forthe machining of odd-shaped holes in hard, brittle materials’. The technique forhollowing out such vases, even with a long drill, down a long and narrow neckstill defies the imagination. But with Dunn’s suggestions, it begins to seemslightly less absurd.Petrie would have been even more embarrassed about his Naqada vases if he hadknown that vessels of the same type had been discovered in strata dating from4000 BC—at a time when Egypt was supposed to be full of nomads in tents, andthat these include the swan-neck vases.It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that, even if the Naqada people werenot the technically accomplished super-race of our speculations, Petrie’s ‘NewRace’ nevertheless really existed, and that it predated pharaonic Egypt by atleast a thousand, possibly several thousand years. These vases seem to be thestrongest evidence so far for Schwaller de Lubicz’s ‘Atlanteans’.Dobecki, West’s geophysicist, was also making some interesting discoveries. Oneof the basic methods of studying deeper layers of rock is through vibration. Ametal plate is struck with a sledgehammer, and the vibrations go down throughthe rock, and are reflected back by various strata. These echoes are then pickedup by ‘geophones’ placed at intervals along the ground, and their datainterpreted by a computer.One of the first discoveries Dobecki made was that a few metres under the frontpaws of the Sphinx there seems to be some kind of underground chamber—possiblymore than one. Legend has always asserted the existence of such chambers,containing ‘ancient secrets’, but they are usually cited by writers who might bedismissed as cranks—for example, a book called Dramatic Prophecies of the GreatPyramid, by Rodolfo Benvenides, published in 1969, contains a drawing of theSphinx with a kind of temple underneath it. (The ‘prophecies’—based on themeasurements inside the Great Pyramid—include little green spacemen landing in1970, and a world war between 1972 and 1977.) Dobecki’s discovery at leastseemed to confirm that some of the stranger legends about the Sphinx are notpure fantasy. Then, in October 1994, Associated Press reported that workersrepairing the Sphinx had discovered an unknown passageway leading down below itsbody. The Giza plateau authorities immediately announced that furtherexcavations by international teams would be delayed until 1996, because repairsto the Sphinx were their primary concern...One of Dobecki’s other discoveries had momentous implications concerning the ageof the Sphinx. Vibration technology can also be used to investigate ‘subsurfaceweathering’, the weathering that penetrates below the surface when porous rocksare exposed to the elements. Dobecki discovered a strange anomaly. At the frontof the Sphinx, the subsurface weathering penetrated about eight feet. Yet at therear, it was only four feet deep. The implication seemed to be that the front ofthe Sphinx had been carved out first, and the rear end thousands of years later.So even if we assume that the rear end was carved in the time of Chefren, 4,500years ago, it would seem that the front part of the Sphinx is twice that age.And if the rear part of the Sphinx was carved long before Chefren, then thefront part could be far, far older.As far as Schoch could see, West was basically correct. The weathering of theSphinx—compared to that of the Old Kingdom tombs only 200 yards away—meant thatit had to be thousands of years older than the tombs, and therefore than thepyramids. The two Sphinx temples pointed clearly to the same conclusion; theirweathering was also far more severe than that of the Old Kingdom tombs, as wellas being of a different kind—rain as opposed to wind weathering.At this point Schoch decided that the time for academic caution was at an end;it was time to go public. He submitted an abstract of his findings to theGeological Society of America, and he was invited to present his case at theannual convention of the Society in October 1992; it was being held that year inSan Diego, California. Geologists are not slow to express disagreement, and heanticipated being given a hard time. To his pleasant surprise, far from raisingobjections, the audience listened with obvious interest, and afterwards no lessthan 275 enthusiastic geologists came up to him and offered to help on theproject; many expressed astonishment that no one had noticed earlier what nowstruck them as obvious—that the Sphinx was weathered by water.But then, they were geologists, not Egyptologists; they had no vested interestin denying that the Sphinx could be older than Chefren. Egyptologists, when thenews leaked out, were indignant or dismissive. ‘Ridiculous!’ declared PeterLacovara, assistant curator of the Egyptian Department of the Boston Museum ofFine Arts, in the Boston Globe.‘There’s just no way that could be true,’ said archaeologist Carol Redmount inthe Los Angeles Times. Others asked what had happened to the evidence for thisearlier Egyptian civilisation—its other monuments and remains. For West andSchoch, the answer to that was obvious: it was underneath the sand.One of the sceptics was Mark Lehner, an American who had been investigating theSphinx since 1980. Yet it was Lehner who had inadvertently encouraged West’sbelief that the Sphinx predated Chefren. In the careful survey he had conductedwith L. Lai Gauri, a stone conservation expert, Lehner had reached the oddconclusion that although the earliest repairs to the flanks of the Sphinx lookedtypical of the Old Kingdom (i.e. the time of Chefren), they were actually fromthe New Kingdom period, about a thousand years later. Why, West wondered, shouldNew Kingdom repairers make their work look like Old Kingdom? What is more, ifthe early repairs—the first of three lots—were as recent as 1500 BC, the Sphinxmust have sustained two or three feet of erosion (the depth of the repairs) in athousand years, during most of which it had been covered in sand.On the other hand, if those early repairs were—as they looked—Old Kingdom, thiscompletely ruled out the notion that Chefren built the Sphinx; for even if therepairs had been at the very end of the Old Kingdom, this would still only allowa century or so for two or three feet of erosion.And if, of course, the repairs were Old Kingdom, this meant that Chefren couldnot possibly be its builder. He was simply its repairer, as the stela betweenits paws seemed to suggest. And the Sphinx must have been built several thousandyears earlier than Chefren’s reign to have eroded three feet—Schoch’sconservative estimate was 7000 BC.This was the Estimate Schoch had put forward at San Diego, and which caught theattention of the world press: it made the Sphinx exactly twice the usualestimate: about nine thousand years old.West also pointed out that the mud-brick tombs around the Step Pyramid ofSaqqara, dating back about a century before the Great Pyramid, show none of theweathering features of the Sphinx—yet are a mere ten miles away (and so subjectto the same climate) as well as being softer. Why have they not weathered likethe Sphinx?When Schoch presented his case at the American Association for the Advancementof Science, Mark Lehner was chosen as the champion of the academic opposition.He raised the now familiar objection—that if the Sphinx had been built by a farolder civilisation than the Egyptians, around 7000 BC, what had happened to theremains of this civilisation? ‘Show me a single potsherd.’ West was not allowedto take part in the debate; since he was not an accredited academic, he had tolisten from the audience. But he was not slow to point out afterwards thatLehner’s objection was illogical. He and Schoch had demonstrated by evidencethat the Sphinx was older than the surrounding tombs; it was Lehner’s job torefute that evidence, not to ask for more evidence which has not yet been found.It was, West pointed out, like objecting to Magellan’s plan of sailing round theworld by saying: ‘Show me someone who has done it before.’Lehner also implied that Schoch was incompetent as a geologist. ‘I don’t thinkhe’s done his geological work yet... One of the primary pillars of his case isthat if you compare the Sphinx to Old Kingdom tombs, they don’t show the samerain weathering, therefore the Sphinx must be older. But he’s comparing layersin the Sphinx to other layers.’ According to Lehner, the ‘Sphinx layers’ rununder the tombs, so the tombs are made of a different limestone—Lehner implied afar harder limestone—and weather more slowly.If this was true, then it struck a deadly blow at Schoch’s case. When the BBCdecided to present the programme made by West and Boris Said, they hired anindependent expert to decide whether Lehner was correct. Their expert lookedclosely at a tomb only a hundred yards from the Sphinx, and known to date fromthe same time as the pyramids. He found that the tombs were made of the verysame flaky limestone as the Sphinx, and contained exactly the same types offossil. The tomb layer was the same layer that the Sphinx was carved from. AndSchoch and West had scored a major victory for their cause. It was now up toLehner—and Dr Hawass of the Cairo Museum—to explain why the tombs had weatheredso little in comparison to the Sphinx and its enclosure and temples.West had another argument for his ‘New Race’ civilisation. The Sphinx Templeis—as we have already noted—built in a far more simple and bleak form ofarchitecture than later Egyptian temples. There is in upper Egypt one othertemple that has the same bare style—the Oseirion, near Abydos. During thenineteenth century, the only famous temple in this area was the Temple ofOsiris, built by the Pharaoh Seti I (1306-1290 BC), father of Rameses II, whofigures as the oppressor of the Israelites in the Bible. But the Greekgeographer Strabo (c. 63 BC-c. AD 23) had mentioned another temple nearby, andin the early twentieth century, Flinders Petrie and Margaret Murray beganclearing away the sand—to reveal a temple that stood below the temple of Seti I.It was not until 1912 that Professor E. Naville cleared away enough sand to makeit clear that this temple was built of megalithic blocks in a style like that ofthe Sphinx Temple, virtually bare of decoration. One block was 25 feet long.Naville was immediately convinced that it dated from the same time as the SphinxTemple, and that it could well be ‘the most ancient stone building in Egypt’.Like the Sphinx, it had been excavated out of the solid rock, and had no floor,so that it soon turned into a kind of swimming pool when the excavation wasfinished in the early 1930s. Naville even thought that it might be someprimitive waterworks. But seventeen small ‘cells’, about the height of a man,also hinted at a monastery.Because of delay due to the First World War, the Oseirion was not excavated byNaville, but by a younger man named Henri Frankfort. Frankfort soon concludedthat it must have been built by Seti I because Seti had written his name twiceon the stone, and because a broken potsherd was found with the words: ‘Seti I isof service to Osiris’. There were also some astronomical decorations on theceilings of two ‘transverse chambers’ which were outside the temple itself;these were undoubtedly carved by Seti or his son.Yet Frankfort's assumptions were highly questionable. A more straightforwardscenario might be as follows. When Seti I came to build his temple around 1300BC, he found the Oseirion temple buried under the sand, a simple and massivestructure dating from the same time as the Sphinx, built of massive blocks. Itspresence certainly added dignity to his own temple, so he built two ‘transversechambers’ at either end—and outside the temple itself—carving them with his ownastronomical designs. He also had his own name carved in two places in thegranite of the inner temple. The potsherd with its inscription about being ‘ofservice to Osiris’ simply meant what it said: he assumed that this ancienttemple was built for Osiris, and he was being ‘of service’ by adding to it andrepairing it.Margaret Murray doubted whether Frankfort was correct in dating it to 1300 BC,pointing out that pharaohs were fond of adding their own names to monuments ofthe past. But by that time, she was also regarded with some doubt by scholars,for she had created controversy with her Witch Cult in Western Europe, whichargued that witches were actually worshippers of the pagan ‘horned God’ (Pan)who preceded Christianity, and her objections were ignored.The Oseirion raises an interesting question. If it was totally buried in thesand—as the Sphinx was at one point—is it not conceivable that other monumentsbuilt of ‘Cyclopean blocks’ by some ancient people lie buried beneath the sand?It was almost certainly not built in honour of Osiris.The way that Frankfort had decided that the Oseirion was more recent than anyonethought is reminiscent of how Egyptologists came to decide that the Sphinx wasbuilt by Chefren because his name was mentioned—in some unknown context—in theinscription placed between its paws by Thutmose IV. It might also remind us ofhow the ‘Valley Temple’—next to the Sphinx Temple—came to be attributed toChefren. Throughout most of the nineteenth century it was assumed to date fromfar earlier than Chefren, because of the bareness of its architecture, and thefact that it is built with giant stone blocks removed from the Sphinx enclosure.But when a number of statues of Chefren were discovered buried in the templeprecincts, Egyptologists revised their views; if statues of Chefren were foundin the temple precincts, surely this proved that Chefren built it?The reasoning of course is flawed. The fact that Chefren set up statues ofhimself in the temple only proves that he wanted his name to be associated withit. If Chefren had built it, would he not have filled it with inscriptions tohimself?Meanwhile, there is one more interesting piece of evidence that needs to bementioned. One of the major discoveries of Auguste Mariette—the first great‘conservationist’ among nineteenth-century archaeologists—was a limestone stelahe uncovered in the ruins of the Temple of Isis, near the Great Pyramid, in themid-1850s. The inscription declares that it is erected by the Pharaoh Cheops, tocommemorate his repairs to the Temple of Isis. It became known as the InventoryStela, and would certainly be regarded as one of the most important of allEgyptian records—for reasons I shall explain in a moment—if it were not for onedrawback: its hieroglyphics clearly dated it from around 1000 BC, about 1500years after Cheops.Now scholars would not normally question the authenticity of a record merelybecause of its late date, for, after all, the stela was obviously copied fromsomething dating much earlier. Another valuable record of early kings iscontained on a block of basalt known as the Palermo Stone (because it has beenkept in Palermo since 1877). This contains a list of kings from the 1st to the5th Dynasties (i.e. about 3000 BC to 2300 BC), and is known to date from about700 BC, when it was copied from some original list. But the fact that this is1500 years later than the last king it mentions causes Egyptologists noembarrassment, for they take it for granted that it is an accurate copy of theoriginal. Indeed, why should it not be accurate? Scribes copying in stone arelikely to be more accurate than scribes writing with a pen.Then why are they suspicious about Cheops’s Inventory Stela—to the extent ofdenouncing it as an invention, a piece of fiction? Because its ‘facts’ sound toopreposterous to be true. Referring to Cheops, it says ‘he found the house(temple) of Isis, mistress of the pyramid, beside the house of the Sphinx,north-west of the house of Osiris.’The implications are staggering. Cheops found the Temple of Isis, ‘mistress ofthe pyramid’, beside the Temple of the Sphinx. In other words, both the Sphinxand a pyramid were already there on the Giza plateau at least a century or sobefore Cheops.This is all very puzzling. If Isis is the ‘mistress of the pyramid’, thenpresumably one of the Giza group must be her pyramid. Which? Cheops alsomentions that he built his pyramid beside the Temple of Isis, and that he alsobuilt a pyramid for the Princess Henutsen. Now we know that Henutsen’s pyramidis one of the three small pyramids that stand close to the Great Pyramid. It istherefore just conceivable that one of its sister pyramids is the pyramid ofCheops.In any case, what it amounts to is that we do not know for certain that theGreat Pyramid was built by Cheops. It may have been, but on the other hand itmay not have been. In the next chapter we shall look at the one rather slenderpiece of evidence that connects it with Cheops.Meanwhile, one thing seems clear: that according to the Inventory Stela, theSphinx was already there in the time of Cheops, and so was a ‘Pyramid of Isis’.It is hardly surprising that Egyptologists are anxious to consider the stela an‘invention’.It was after the discovery of an undamaged statue of Chefren that Egyptologistsdecided that there was a strong resemblance between its face and that of theSphinx—in fact, another statue was even in the form of a sphinx.At the height of the controversy that followed the San Diego geologicalconference, Mark Lehner launched an attack on West in the National Geographicmagazine, which included a computer image of the face of the Sphinx merged witha photograph of the face of an undamaged statue of Chefren from the ValleyTemple. This, Lehner claimed, proved that the face of the Sphinx was Chefren. ToWest’s eyes, this was absurd—the Sphinx looked nothing like Chefren. But, forbetter or worse, computer models make impressive arguments. West decided tocounterattack. And the producer of the video, Boris Said, came up with aninspired idea: get a trained police artist to work on it.Enquiries about who was the best in New York pointed them towards DetectiveFrank Domingo, senior forensic artist with the New York City Police Department.Since he joined the Department in 1966, Domingo had been right up through theranks, and ended as a major consultant in any kind of case that involved facialreconstruction. Sometimes they were straightforward criminal cases—like that ofthe nun who was raped, sodomised and tattooed with dozens of cross-shaped cutsby two intruders. Domingo went to see her in hospital, drew the faces of theburglars from her descriptions, and was able to provide the lead that led to thearrest and conviction of both suspects.As his reputation spread, he was at various times called in by archaeologistsand historians. A fragment of broken potsherd showed the mouth and chin of a manarchaeologists thought might be Alexander the Great, but there is no accreditedportrait of Alexander—only many idealised portraits. Domingo looked at every oneavailable, and made a kind of composite—which was found to match closely themouth and chin of the potsherd. He was even asked to undertake thereconstruction of the face of the crystal ‘Skull of Doom’, on the suppositionthat it was an exact copy of the skull of some ancient princess. In anothercase—that of an old daguerreotype photograph whose proud owner thought it mightbe the young Abraham Lincoln—Domingo had to disappoint: he took one look at thephotograph and said: ‘Definitely not.’There are times when a police artist can achieve such an astonishing likeness tothe suspect—based purely on the description of witnesses—that it raises thesuspicion that he must be telepathic. But in cases like the identification ofChefren, the technique requires only scientific precision.When West asked Domingo if he was willing to go to Giza and decide whether theSphinx and Chefren were one and the same, Domingo asked: ‘What if I decide it isChefren?’ ‘If that’s what you come up with, that’s what I’ll publish.’On this promise, Domingo went to Cairo, and took many photographs of the Sphinxand of the statue of Chefren in the Cairo Museum. His conclusion was that thechin of the Sphinx is far more prominent than that of Chefren. Moreover, a linedrawn from the ear to the corner of the Sphinx’s mouth sloped at an angle of 32degrees. A similar line drawn on Chefren was only 14 degrees. This, and otherdissimilarities, led Domingo to conclude that the Sphinx is definitely not aportrait of Chefren."},{"pageContent":"3 INSIDE THE PYRAMIDWhen Herodotus visited the Great Pyramid in 440 BC, it was a white, gleamingstructure that dazzled the eyes. At that time, its limestone casing was stillintact; the blocks were so precisely cut that the joints were virtuallyinvisible. Just over four centuries later, in 24 BC, the Greek geographer Straboalso visited Giza, and reported that on the north face of the Pyramid, there wasa hinged stone that could be raised, and which revealed a passage a mere fourfeet square, which led downward to a vermin-infested pit 150 feet directly belowthe Pyramid. Herodotus had said that there were several underground chambers,intended as ‘vaults’, built on a sort of island surrounded by water that flowedfrom the Nile. ' The reality, it seemed, was a small, damp chamber, and no signof an island or a canal.Eight centuries passed, and in Baghdad there reigned the great Haroun Al-Rashid,the caliph of the Arabian Nights. In fact, Haroun was not particularly great; hereceived his honorific title Al-Rashid (‘one who follows the right path’) as ateenager for winning a war against Constantinople under the direction of moreexperienced generals. His elder brother, who became caliph before him, diedunder mysterious circumstances suggesting murder. Haroun succeeded to a vastempire stretching from the Mediterranean to India, and he increased his wealthby permitting regional governors and princes to pay him yearly payments inexchange for semi-independence. It was his vast wealth arid conspicuousconsumption that impressed his contemporaries. Tales of him roaming the streetsin disguise, with his Grand Vizier Jafar and executioner Mazrur may well betrue; so are tales of his uncertain temper: he had Jafar and his whole familyexecuted for reasons still unclear. He died in his mid-forties from a diseasepicked up while on his way to repress a revolt in Persia.Haroun divided his empire between his two sons, Al-Amin and Al-Mamun, furthercontributing to the dissolution of his empire. It is Abdullah Al-Mamun whoconcerns us here, for when he became caliph in AD 813, at the age of 27, he setout to turn Baghdad into a centre of learning like ancient Alexandria. Harounhad been a connoisseur of art and poetry, but Al-Mamun was also interested inscience, and founded a library, called the House of Wisdom, intended to rivalthe great library of ancient Alexandria. He also had an observatory built, andcommissioned the first atlas of the stars. This amazing man was curious aboutthe circumference of the earth, and doubted Ptolemy’s estimate of 18,000 miles.So he had his astronomers marching north and south over the flat sandy plain ofPalmyra until their astronomical observations told them that the latitude hadchanged by one degree, which had occurred in just over 64 miles. Multiplied by360, this gave 23,180 miles, a far more accurate figure than Ptolemy’s. (Theactual circumference at the equator is roughly 24,900 miles.)When Al-Mamun heard that the Great Pyramid was supposed to contain star maps andterrestrial globes of amazing accuracy—not to mention fabulous treasures—heresolved to add them to his collection. In AD 820, the seventh year of hisreign, he landed in Egypt—which was part of his empire—with an army of scholarsand engineers. Mamun has left us no account of the expedition, but it has beendescribed by a number of later Arab historians.Unfortunately, the location of the ‘hinged trapdoor’ had been forgotten in thepast few centuries and the gleaming limestone of the Pyramid offered no clue toits whereabouts. So he decided to break his way in by sheer force. The limestonecasing proved impervious to chisels—days of work only produced shallowdepressions. Al-Mamun decided on a cruder method—to build huge fires against thelimestone, and then cool the red-hot surface with buckets of cold vinegar. Thecracked limestone was then levered and battered out.After tunnelling through eight feet of hard limestone, the workmen foundthemselves confronting the inner blocks of the Pyramid, which proved just ashard. It took months to tunnel a hundred feet into it, and by that time,Al-Mamun concluded that it was solid throughout and was about to give up whenone of his workmen heard a dull thud coming from somewhere to the left. Theychanged direction, and finally broke into a narrow and low passage that seemedto have been made for dwarfs. On its floor lay a prism-shaped stone from theceiling, which had made the thud.They crawled up the slope, and finally discovered the original entrance to thePyramid, ten courses above the entrance Al-Mamun had forced. It had cunninglybeen placed 24 feet left of centre, and was invisible behind huge limestonegables. Arab historians claim that the hinged stone—which required two men tomove it—was still there—it vanished centuries later, when the limestone casingwas purloined by builders.Now they retraced their steps and crawled down the passage. This simply led themto Strabo’s ‘vermin-infested pit’, with an irregular (and obviously unfinished)floor. On the further side of this there was a low passage that ended in a blankwall. Clearly, this had been abandoned.Again, luck favoured Mamun. The stone that had fallen from the ceiling revealedthe end of a granite plug which looked as if it blocked a passage that slopedupward. This again proved too hard for their chisels, so Mamun told his men tocut into the softer limestone to the right of it. But when they came to the endof it, there was another plug, and at the end of that, yet another—each of theplugs about six feet long. Beyond this there was a passage blocked with alimestone plug, which they cut their way through with grim persistence. Beyondthat there was another, then still another. The workmen were now eager, for theyfelt that whoever had taken so much trouble to block the passageway mustcertainly have concealed some marvellous treasure...A long crawl up another low passageway finally led to a space where they couldstand upright. Facing them was another low corridor—less than four feethigh—that ran horizontally due south. They scrambled along this for more than ahundred feet, then found that the floor suddenly dropped in a two-foot step,enabling them at last to stand upright. But why a two-foot step at that point?The Pyramid would prove to be full of such absurd and arbitrary mysteries—somany that it is hardly surprising that, in later centuries, cranks would readprofound significance into its strange measurements, such as detailed propheciesof the events of the next 5000 years.Now Al-Mamun—who took care to go first—found himself standing in a rectangularroom with plastered walls and a gabled roof, like a barn. It was completely bareand empty. In the east wall there was a tall niche that looked as if it had beencarved for a large statue, but it was also empty. The floor was rough, andlooked unfinished. Because the Arabs buried their women in tombs with gabledceilings (and men in tombs with flat ceilings), Al-Mamun arbitrarily labelledthis the Queen’s Chamber. But it contained no artefact—or anything else—toassociate it with a woman. Bafflingly, the walls were encrusted with a half-inchlayer of salt.The measurements of the room were puzzling—although Al-Mamun was probably toochagrined at the lack of treasure to pay much attention to them. It was notquite square, which was odd, since the pyramid builders showed themselvesobsessed with precision and accuracy, and the wall niche was slightlyoff-centre. In the nineteenth century another puzzle would become apparent whenan explorer named Dixon, tapping the walls, noticed a hollow sound, and got aworkman to cut into the wall with a chisel. This revealed an ‘air vent’ slopingupwards. Yet the air vent—and an identical one in the opposite wall—failed toreach the outside of the Pyramid. Why should the architect of the Pyramid buildtwo ‘air vents’ that failed to reach the outside air, and then seal them off atthe lower end so they were not visible? It sounds like Alice’s White Knight:But I was thinking of a planTo dye one’s whiskers green,Then always use so large a fanThat they could not be seen.Did these ancient builders have a sense of humour like Lewis Carroll?There is another puzzle. The ‘Queen’s Chamber’ looks as if it was leftunfinished. If so, then why did the workmen continue to construct the ‘airvents’ as they went on building upwards? Is the chamber part of some curiousbluff?Al-Mamun ordered his workmen to hack into the wall behind the niche, in case itwas a secret doorway into another chamber, but after a few feet, gave up.Instead, they retraced their steps to the end of the horizontal passage, wherethey could stand upright, and raised their torches above their heads. They couldnow see that the level ‘step’ they were standing on had not always been there.The low ascending passage they had climbed had once continued upward in astraight line; this was proved by joist holes in the walls which had oncesupported it.Standing on one another’s shoulders, they heaved themselves up the side of the‘step’, and into the continuation of the ascending passage. As they held theirtorches aloft and saw what lay ahead, they must have gasped with astonishment.There was no longer a lack of headroom—the ceiling of this long ascending tunnelwas far above them. And ahead of them, rising at the same angle as the ascendingpassage behind them (26 degrees), the tunnel ran up into the heart of thePyramid. This marvellous structure would be christened the Grand Gallery.This gallery, about seven feet wide at floor level, narrowed to about half thiswidth at the ceiling, about 28 feet above. Against the wall on either side is atwo-foot high step or ramp, so that the actual floor is a sunken channel orslot, just less than three and a half feet wide. Why there has to be a sunkenchannel between two low walls, instead of a flat floor, is another of thoseunsolved mysteries of the Pyramid.A long scramble of 153 feet up the slippery limestone floor brought them to ahuge stone higher than a man; the top of a doorway was visible behind it. Whenthey had clambered over this, and down another short passageway, they foundthemselves in the room that was obviously the heart of the Pyramid. It was farlarger than the 'Queen’s Chamber’ below, and beautifully constructed of redpolished granite; the ceiling above them was more than three times the height ofa man. This, obviously, was the King’s Chamber. Yet, except for an object like ared granite bathtub, it was completely empty.Al-Mamun was baffled; his workmen were enraged. It was like some absurd joke—allthis effort, to no purpose whatsoever. The ‘bathtub’—presumably asarcophagus—was also empty, and had no lid. The walls were undecorated. Surelythis had to be the antechamber to some other treasure chamber? They attacked thefloor, and even hacked into the granite in one corner of the room. It was all tono avail. If the Pyramid was a tomb, it had been looted long ago.Yet how was this possible? No one could have been in here before them. And thesheer bareness of the room, the lack of any debris or rubbish on the floor,suggested that there had never been any treasure, for robbers would have leftsomething behind, if only useless fragments of their loot.Oral tradition describes how Al-Mamun pacified the angry workmen by havingtreasure carried into the Pyramid at night, and then ‘discovered’ the next dayand distributed among them. After that, Al-Mamun, puzzled and disappointed,returned to Baghdad, where he devoted the remaining twelve years of his reign totrying—entirely without success—to reconcile the Sunni and Shi’ite Muslims. Likehis father, he died when on campaign.In 1220, the historian and physician Abdul Latif was one of the last to see thePyramid still encased in limestone. Two years later much of Cairo was destroyedby a great earthquake, and the limestone—22 acres of it—was removed to rebuildthe city’s public buildings. The ‘Grand Mosque’ is built almost entirely fromthe casing of the Pyramid. But it is a pity that the builders did not retain itsinscriptions. Abdul Latif said that the hieroglyphics on its surface were sonumerous that they would have occupied thousands of pages. In that case, wewould presumably know the answer to the riddle of the Pyramid.As it happened, Al-Mamun was wrong in believing that there was no other entranceto the Pyramid. It was almost rediscovered in 1638 by an English mathematiciancalled John Greaves, who went out to Egypt armed with various measuringinstruments. After struggling through a cloud of huge bats, and staggering outof the Queen’s Chamber because the stench of vermin made him retch, he made hisway up the smooth ramp of the Grand Gallery, and surveyed the King’s Chamberwith the same bafflement as Al-Mamun; it seemed incomprehensible that this vaststructure should be built merely to house this red-granite room with its granitebathtub. On his way back down the Grand Gallery, just before it rejoined thenarrow ascending passage, he noticed that a stone was missing from the ramp onone side. Peering down into the hole, he concluded that there was a kind of wellthat descended into the heart of the Pyramid. He even had the courage to lowerhimself into this well, and to descend about 60 feet—at which point it had beenenlarged into a small grotto. He dropped a lighted torch into the continuationof the well, and realised that it came to an end when the torch lay flickeringsomewhere in the depths. But the fetid air and the presence of bats drove himout again. Back in England, his book Pyramidographia brought him celebrity, andan appointment as Professor of Astronomy at Oxford.Two centuries later, an intrepid Italian sea captain—and student of the hermeticarts—named Giovanni Battista Caviglia gave up the sea to devote himself to themystery of the Great Pyramid. Like Al-Mamun, he believed that there must be asecret room that would reveal why the Pyramid had been built.In fact, a kind of ‘secret chamber’ had been discovered in 1765 by an explorernamed Nathaniel Davison, who had observed a curious echo at the top of the GrandGallery, and raised a candle on two joined canes to look at the wall above him.At ceiling-level he had seen a hole in the wall, and investigated it with theaid of a shaky ladder. He crawled down a tunnel almost blocked with bat dung,and found himself in a ‘chamber’ that was only about three feet high, whoseirregular floor was formed of the blocks that made the ceiling of the King’sChamber, directly below it. But it proved to be quite empty.In his search for a secret chamber, Caviglia paid a gang of workmen to dig atunnel out of ‘Davison’s Chamber’, while he used the Chamber itself as abedroom. It seems to have occurred to him that there might well be more hiddenchambers above this one, but he lacked the resources to search for them.Instead, he decided to explore the mystery of the ‘well’. He went twice as faras John Greaves, but found the bottom blocked with rubble, and the air so fetidthat his candle went out.He tried removing the rubble by having his workmen pull it up in baskets; butthey soon refused to work in such appalling conditions, choked with foul air andpowdered bat dung. He tried clearing the air with burning sulphur, but sincesulphur dioxide is a deadly poison, this only made it worse.Caviglia returned to the descending passage that ran down to the‘vermin-infested pit’ under the Pyramid. It was still full of limestone debrisfrom the entrance cut by Al-Mamun’s workmen. Caviglia had this removed, andcrawled on down the passage. The air was so foul and hot that he began to spitblood; but he pressed on. A hundred and fifty feet further down, he found a lowdoorway in the right-hand wall. When he smelt sulphur, he guessed that he hadfound the lower end of the well. His workmen began to try to clear the debris,and suddenly had to retreat as it fell down on them—bringing the basket they hadleft at the bottom of the well. This was the secret entrance to the heart of thePyramid.In a sense, this raised more problems than it solved. The obvious explanationwas that the builders of the Pyramid had used it to escape after they hadblocked the ascending passageway with granite plugs and so sealed the Pyramid.But that theory demanded that they should slide the granite plugs down theascending passageway like pushing corks down the neck of a bottle; the sheersize and weight of the plugs would have made this impossible. It was far moresensible to assume that the plugs were inserted as the Pyramid was beingbuilt—in which case, the builders would not need an escape passage, because theycould walk out via the still unfinished top.The truth is that, where the pyramids are concerned, there are no absolutecertainties: only certain established ideas that the ‘experts’ have agreed toaccept because it is convenient to do so.One of these established ideas is the ‘certainty’ that the Great Pyramid wasbuilt by a pharaoh called Cheops or Khufu. As a cautionary tale, it is worthtelling how this particular ‘certainty’ came about.In 1835, a British officer, Colonel Richard Howard-Vyse—according to one writer,‘a trial to his family’, who were anxious to get rid of him1[../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark7]—came to Egypt and was bitten by the ‘discovery’bug. He approached Caviglia, who was still exploring the Pyramid, and offered tofund his researches if Caviglia would give him credit as the co-discoverer ofany major find; Caviglia rejected this.In 1836 Howard-Vyse returned to Egypt and managed to obtain a firman—permissionto excavate—from the Egyptian government. But, to Howard-Vyse’s disgust, thisnamed the British Consul, Colonel Campbell, as a co-excavator, and Caviglia assupervisor. Howard-Vyse paid over a sum of money to finance the investigation,and went off on a sightseeing tour. When he returned, he was infuriated to findthat Caviglia was looking for mummies in tombs instead of investigating theGreat Pyramid for secret chambers, which is what Howard-Vyse wanted. Cavigliahad told him that he suspected that there might be more hidden rooms aboveDavison’s Chamber.On the night of 12 February 1837, Howard-Vyse entered the Pyramid at night,accompanied by an engineer named John Perring, and went to examine a crack thathad developed in a granite block above and to one side of Davison’s Chamber; athree-foot reed could be pushed straight through it, which suggested there mightbe another chamber above. The very next morning, Howard-Vyse dismissed Caviglia,and appointed Perring to his team.Howard-Vyse’s workmen now began to try to cut their way through the granite atthe side of Davison’s Chamber. It proved more difficult than he had expected,and a month later he had still made little headway. Royal visitors came, andHoward-Vyse had little to show them except ‘Campbell’s Tomb’, which Caviglia haddiscovered near one of the other Giza pyramids. (He also tried boring into theshoulder of the Sphinx, looking for masons’ markings, but was unsuccessful.)Finally, in desperation, he employed small charges of gunpowder—which madegranite fly around like shrapnel—and managed to open a small passage up from outof Davison’s Chamber.Oddly enough, Howard-Vyse then dismissed the foreman of the workmen. The nextday, a candle on the end of a stick revealed that Caviglia had been right; therewas another hidden chamber above.The hole was further enlarged with gunpowder. The first to enter it wasHoward-Vyse, accompanied by a local copper mill employee and well-known ‘fixer’named J. R. Hill. What they found was another low chamber—only three feethigh—whose irregular floor was covered with thick black dust, made of thecast-off shells of insects. To Howard-Vyse’s disappointment, it was completelyempty. Howard-Vyse decided to call it Wellington’s Chamber.The hole was enlarged yet again, and the next time Howard-Vyse entered it, withJohn Perring, and another engineer named Mash, they discovered a number of markspainted in a kind of red pigment, daubed on the walls. These were ‘quarrymarks’, marks painted on the stones when they were still in the quarry, to showwhere they had to go in the Pyramid. Conveniently enough, none of these marksappeared on the end wall, through which Howard-Vyse had smashed his way. Butthere was something more exciting than mere quarry marks—a series of hieroglyphsin an oblong-shaped box (or cartouche)—which meant the name of a pharaoh. Oddlyenough, Howard-Vyse had failed to notice these when he first entered thechamber.From the fact that Wellington's Chamber was almost identical with Davison’sunderneath it, Howard-Vyse reasoned that there must be more above. It took fourand a half months of blasting to discover these—three more chambers on top ofone another. The topmost chamber, which Howard-Vyse called ‘Campbell’s Chamber’,had a roof that sloped to a point, like the roof of a house. All the chambershad more quarry markings, and two of them—including Campbell’s Chamber—had morenames in cartouches. As in Wellington’s Chamber, these marks were never on thewall through which Howard-Vyse had broken...The purpose of these chambers was now apparent: to relieve the pressure ofmasonry on the King’s Chamber below. If there was an earthquake that shook thePyramid, the vibration would not be transmitted through solid masonry to theKing’s Chamber. In fact, there had been an earthquake, as the cracks in thegranite revealed, and the secret chambers had served their purpose and preventedthe King’s Chamber from collapsing.When copies of the quarry marks and inscriptions were sent to the BritishMuseum, the hieroglyphics expert Samuel Birch testified that one of the nameswritten in a cartouche, and found in Campbell’s Chamber, was that of the PharaohKhufu. So, at last, someone had proved that Cheops built the Great Pyramid, andHoward-Vyse had earned himself immortality among Egyptologists.But Samuel Birch admitted that there were certain things about the inscriptionsthat puzzled him. To begin with, many were upside-down. Moreover, although thescript was—obviously—supposed to be from the time of Cheops, around 2500 BC, itlooked as if many of the symbols came from a much later period, whenhieroglyphics had ceased to be ‘pictures’, and become something more likecursive writing. Many of the hieroglyphs were unknown—or written by someone soilliterate that they could hardly be deciphered. This in itself was baffling.Early hieroglyphic writing was a fine art, and only highly trained scribes hadmastered it. These hieroglyphs looked as if they had been scrawled by theancient Egyptian equivalent of Just William.Most puzzling of all, two pharaohs seemed to be named in the cartouches—Khufuand someone called Khnem-khuf. Who was this Khnem-khuf? Later Egyptologists wereagreed that he was supposed to be another pharaoh—and not just some variant onKhufu—yet the puzzling thing was that his name appeared in chambers lower thanCampbell’s Chamber, implying that Khnem-Khuf had started the Pyramid and Khufuhad completed it (since a pyramid is built from the bottom up). It was anembarrassing puzzle for archaeologists.The answer to this puzzle has been suggested by the writer Zechariah Sitchin.Unfortunately, his solution will never be taken seriously by scholars orarchaeologists, because Mr Sitchin, like Erich von Daniken, belongs to thefraternity who believe that the pyramids were built by visitors from outerspace, ‘ancient astronauts’. Sitchin’s own highly individual version of thistheory is expounded in a series of books called The Earth Chronicles. These havefailed to achieve the same widespread impact as Daniken’s because Sitchin isalmost obsessively scholarly; he can read Egyptian hieroglyphics, and heoverloads his chapters with archaeological details that sometimes make them hardgoing. But no matter how one feels about his theory that ‘gods’ came to earthfrom a ‘12th planet’ nearly half a million years ago, there can be no doubt thathe has an extremely acute mind, and that his erudition is enormous. And what hehas to say about Howard-Vyse goes straight to the point.Sitchin points out that no marks of any kind were found in Davison’s Chamber,discovered in 1765—only in those discovered by Howard-Vyse. And, noting thatHoward-Vyse dismissed Caviglia the day after his secret visit to Davison’sChamber, and his foreman on the day the workmen broke through into Wellington’sChamber, he concludes reasonably that Howard-Vyse preferred not to be observedby anyone who had his wits about him. He notes that Hill was allowed to wanderin and out of the newly discovered chambers freely, and that it was he who firstcopied the quarry marks and other inscriptions.The atmosphere that surrounded Vyse’s operations in those hectic days is welldescribed by the Colonel himself. Major discoveries were being made all aroundthe pyramids, but not within them. Campbell’s Tomb, discovered by the detestedCaviglia, was yielding not only artefacts but also masons’ markings andhieroglyphics in red paint. Vyse was becoming desperate to achieve his owndiscovery. Finally he broke through to hitherto unknown chambers; but they onlyduplicated one after the other a previously discovered chamber (Davison’s) andwere bare and empty. What could he show for all the effort and expenditure? Forwhat would he be honoured, by what would he be remembered?We know from Vyse’s chronicles that, by day, he had sent in Mr Hill to inscribethe chambers with the names of the Duke of Wellington and Admiral Nelson, heroesof the victories over Napoleon. By night, we suspect, Mr Hill also entered thechambers, to ‘christen’ the pyramid with the cartouches of its presumed ancientbuilder.2 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark8]The problem was that in the 1830s, knowledge of hieroglyphics was still minimal(the Rosetta Stone, with its parallel inscriptions in Greek and ancientEgyptian, had only been discovered in 1799). One of the few books that Hillmight have consulted would be Sir John Wilkinson’s Materia Hieroglyphica, andeven Wilkinson was uncertain about the reading of royal names.Sitchin suggests that what happened is that Hill inscribed the name thatWilkinson thought was Khufu, and then Howard-Vyse heard that a new work byWilkinson, the three-volume Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,published earlier that year, had just reached Cairo. Howard-Vyse and Hill didsome frantic—and unexplained—commuting between Giza and Cairo soon after thediscovery of the chamber named after Lady Arbuthnot. They must have beendismayed to find that Wilkinson had changed his mind about how Khufu was spelt,and that Hill had inscribed the wrong name in the lower chambers. They hastenedto put right this appalling blunder in the newly discovered Campbell’s Chamber,and at last the correct spelling of Khufu appeared.But what they did not know was that Wilkinson was still incorrect. The ‘Kh’ ofKhufu should be rendered by a symbol like a small circle with lines hatchedacross it—a sieve. Wilkinson, and a Frenchman named Laborde (who had alsowritten about hieroglyphs in a travel book) made the mistake of rendering thisas a sun-disc—a circle with a dot in the middle. In fact, this was the name forthe sun god Ra. So instead of writing ‘Khufu’, the forger wrote ‘Raufu’. Noancient Egyptian would have made such an appalling and blasphemous error.But what about the red paint? Would it not be obvious that the inscriptions weremodern, and not more than four thousand years old? No. The same red ochre paintwas still used by the Arabs, and Perring noted that it was hard to distinguishancient quarry marks from new ones. (In the same way, many Cro-Magnon cavepaintings look as fresh as if they were made yesterday.)Sitchin notes that Mr Hill, who had been a mere copper mill employee whenHoward-Vyse met him, became the owner of the Cairo Hotel when Howard-Vyse leftEgypt, and that Howard-Vyse thanks him effusively in his book. Howard-Vysehimself had spent ten thousand pounds—an incredible sum—on his excavations. Butthe black sheep was able to return to his family as a famous scholar anddiscoverer.It is Sitchin’s intention to try to prove that the Great Pyramid was built insome remote age, at the time of the Sphinx. This would seem to be a reasonableassumption—except that carbon-dating tests on organic material found in themortar of the Great Pyramid seem to indicate that its date was—give or take acentury or so—the middle of the third millennium BC. (We shall see later thatthere is another reason—the astronomical alignment of the ‘air vents’ in theKing’s Chamber—for accepting the conventional dating.) It is nevertheless worthbearing in mind the curious tale of how Egyptologists came to accept that theGreat Pyramid was built by Khufu, and to draw from it the moral that, whereancient civilisations are concerned, nothing should be taken for granted unlessit is based on hard scientific evidence.Mr Hill, at least, had one genuine discovery to his credit. John Greaves hadnoted two nine-inch openings in the walls of the King’s Chamber, and speculatedthat they were air vents. It was Hill who, two centuries later, clambered up theoutside of the Pyramid and found the outlets that proved that they were airvents. When they were cleared of debris, a cool breeze rushed down them, keepingthe King’s Chamber at a constant 68 degrees Fahrenheit, no matter what thetemperature outside. Again, this only seemed to increase the mystery. Why shouldthe ancient Egyptians want a chamber kept at exactly 68 degrees? One of thescholars Napoleon had taken with him to Egypt in 1798, Edmé-François Jomard,speculated that the Chamber might be a storage place for measuring instruments,which would need to be kept at a constant temperature. But this theory failed toexplain why, in that case, the King’s Chamber had to be virtually inaccessible.Or why it had to be approached by a long, slippery gallery of smooth limestonerather than a sensible staircase.It is difficult for a reader, who has to rely on facts and figures printed in abook, to realise how much more baffling the Great Pyramid is when confronted inits overwhelming reality. In Fingerprints of the Gods, Graham Hancock conveyssomething of his own bewilderment as he repeats: ‘All was confusion. All wasparadox. All was mystery.’ For the inner architecture of the Pyramid simplyfails to make sense. Everything has an air of precision, of some exact purpose;yet it is impossible to begin to guess the nature of this purpose. For example,the ‘walls’ or ramps on either side of the ‘slot’ at the centre of the GrandGallery have a series of slots cut into them. These could be to help theclimber. But why are the holes of two different lengths, alternately long andshort, and why do the short ones slope, while the long ones are horizontal? Andwhy does the sloping length of the short holes equal the horizontal length ofthe long holes? It is as if the place had been designed by an insanemathematician.To see these vast blocks—some weighing as much as 70 tons—all laid in place asneatly as if they were ordinary-sized builder’s bricks, brings an overwhelmingsense of the incredible skill involved. Medieval cathedrals were built by masonswho devoted their lives to the study of their craft, and who apparentlyincorporated as many mysterious measurements as the Great Pyramid. But cathedralbuilding lasted for centuries, and there were so many that the masons had plentyof time to practise their craft. The pyramids of Giza were preceded—according tothe history books—by a few cruder examples like the Step Pyramid at Saqqara andthe Bent Pyramid at Dahshur. Where did the Great Pyramid’s craftsmen learn theirskill?Again, why was the Great Pyramid so bleak and bare, like a geometricaldemonstration? Why were there none of the wall decorations that we associatewith Egyptian temples? As we saw in the last chapter, even an object as simpleas the sarcophagus in the King’s Chamber presented impossible technicalproblems, so that Flinders Petrie speculated that it had been cut out of thegranite by bronze saws studded with diamonds, and hollowed out by some totallyunknown ‘drill’ made of a tube with a saw edge tipped with diamonds. Moreover(as we saw in the last chapter), swan-necked vases, cut out of basalt, quartzand diorite with some unknown tool, seem to prove conclusively that there was ahighly sophisticated civilisation in Egypt long before the First Dynasty. Thisis not some Daniken-like crankery, but hard evidence that Egyptologists refuseto face squarely.The first scientific theory of the purpose of the Great Pyramid was put forwardby a London publisher named John Taylor in 1864. He wondered why the builders ofthe Pyramid had chosen to make it slope at an angle of almost 52°—51° 51'. Whenhe compared the height of the Pyramid with the length of its base he saw theonly possible answer: it had to slope at that exact angle if the relation of itsheight to the length of its base should be exactly the relation of the radius ofa circle to its circumference. In other words, the builders were revealing aknowledge of what the Greeks would later call π (pi). Why should they want toencode π in the Pyramid? Could it possibly be that they were really speakingabout the earth itself, so the Pyramid was supposed to represent the hemispherefrom the North Pole to the equator? In fact, towards the end of the secondcentury BC, the Greek grammarian Agatharchides of Cnidus, the tutor of thepharaoh’s children, was told that the base of the Great Pyramid was preciselyone eighth of a minute of a degree in length—that is, it was an eighth of aminute of a degree of the earth’s circumference. (A minute is a sixtieth of adegree.) In fact, if the length of the Pyramid’s base is multiplied by eight,then sixty, then 360, the result is just under 25,000 miles, a remarkableapproximation of the circumference of the earth.Taylor concluded that, being unable to build a huge dome, the Egyptians had donethe next best thing and incorporated the earth’s measurements into a pyramid.So it was possible—indeed, highly likely—that the ancient Egyptians possessedknowledge that was thousands of years ahead of their time.Unfortunately, this was Taylor’s sticking point. Rather than give the ancientEgyptians credit for knowing far more than anyone thought, he concluded that theonly way these ignoramuses could have known such things was from DivineRevelation—God had directly inspired them. That was too much even for theVictorians, and his work was received with derision.When the Scottish Astronomer Royal, Charles Piazzi Smyth—who was also a friendof Taylor’s—visited the Pyramid in 1865 and made his own measurements, heconcluded that Taylor was fundamentally correct about π. But being, like Taylor,a Christian zealot, he was also unable to resist the temptation to drag inJehovah and the Bible. Not long before, a religious crank named Robert Menzieshad advanced the theory that the Great Pyramid contained detailed prophecies ofworld history in its measurements. Piazzi Smyth swallowed this whole, andconcluded that the Pyramid revealed that the earth was created in 4004 BC, andthat it contains all the major dates in earth history, such as the Flood in 2400BC. He also came up with a staggeringly simple explanation of why the GrandGallery is so different from the narrow ascending passage that leads to it: itsbeginning symbolises the birth of Christ. The Second Coming, he concluded, willhappen in 1911. All this was again received by his scientific contemporarieswith scepticism, although his book had considerable popular success.Later, the founder of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, Charles Taze Russell, wouldembrace the prophecy theory of the Great Pyramid, and a group called the BritishIsraelites, who believed that the British are the ten lost tribes of Israel,elaborated it even further.3 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark9]More sober theories of the Pyramid’s purpose included the suggestion that it wasintended as a landmark for Egyptian land surveyors, and that it was a giantsundial. This latter led to the most interesting and plausible theory so far:that it was intended as an astronomical observatory. This had been stated asfact by the fifth-century Byzantine philosopher Proclus, who mentioned that thePyramid was used as an observatory while it was under construction. In 1883 itwas again advanced by an astronomer, Richard Anthony Proctor.Proctor realised that one of the prime necessities for an agriculturalcivilisation is an accurate calendar, which involves precise observation of themoon and stars. What they would need, to begin with, is a long narrow slotpointing due north (or south), through which the passage of stars and planetscould be observed and noted down in star tables.The first necessity, said Proctor, was to determine true north, then align atube on it. Nowadays we point a telescope at the Pole star; but in ancientEgypt, this was not in the same place, due to a phenomenon called ‘procession ofthe equinoxes’ (a term to note, since it will play a major part in laterarguments). Imagine a pencil stuck through the earth from the North to the SouthPole; this is its axis. But due to the gravity of the sun and moon, this axishas a slight wobble, and its ends describe small circles in the heavens, causingthe north end of the pencil to point at different stars. In ancient Egypt, thePole star was Alpha Draconis.Now the stars appear to describe a semicircle above our heads, from horizon tohorizon. Those directly overhead (at the meridian) describe the longest circle,those nearest the Pole the smallest. If the ancient Egyptians had wanted topoint a telescope at Alpha Draconis, they would have had to point it at an angleof 26° 17'—which, Proctor noted, happens to be precisely the angle of thedescending passage.He also noted that if the ‘vermin-infested pit’ underneath the Pyramid had beenfilled with water, the light of the then Pole star, Alpha Draconis, would shinedown it on to the ‘pool’, as into the mirror of a modern astronomer’s telescope.The flat top of the Great Pyramid was, according to Proctor, an observatoryplatform.Proctor’s theory had the advantage of suggesting the purpose of the GrandGallery, and the peculiar oblong holes in its ‘ramp’. If, said Proctor, anancient astronomer wanted an ideal ‘telescope’ to study the heavens, he wouldprobably ask an architect to devise a building with an enormous slot in one ofits walls, through which he could study the transit of the stars. Proctorthought that the top end of the Grand Gallery was originally such a slot.Astronomers stationed on scaffolding above the Grand Gallery—with thescaffolding based in the oblong holes—would be able to observe the transits ofstars with great accuracy. The bricks in the apex of the Grand Gallery areremovable, and this would also enable them to study the stars overhead.The obvious objection is that the Grand Gallery at present ends halfway acrossthe Pyramid, and that the King’s Chamber with its ‘secret chambers’ lies beyondit. The present King’s Chamber would have completely blocked the ‘slot’. But isit not conceivable, said Proctor, that the Pyramid remained in its half-finishedstate for a long time before it was finished? In fact, once the heavens had beenminutely mapped, the unfinished pyramid would have served its purpose, and couldbe completed. Proctor envisaged that it would take about ten years before thebuilders were ready to move beyond the Grand Gallery, and by that time thepriests would have completed their work of making star maps and calendars.In retrospect, it seems clear that Proctor had come the closest so far tosuggesting a reasonable theory of the Great Pyramid. Since The Great Pyramid,Observatory, Tomb and Temple, we have become increasingly aware of theastronomical alignments of great monuments like the Egyptian temples andStonehenge. In fact, it was only ten years after Proctor's book, in 1893, thatthe British astronomer Norman Lockyer (later Sir Norman), who identified heliumin the sun, went on to demonstrate precisely how Egyptian temples could havebeen used. On holiday in Greece, the young Lockyer found himself wondering ifthe Parthenon was aligned astronomically—recalling, as he said later, that theeast windows of many English churches face the sunrise on the day of theirpatron saint. Since Egyptian temples had been measured and documented socarefully, he turned to them to seek evidence for his thesis. He was able toshow that temples were astronomically aligned, so that the light of a star orother heavenly body would penetrate their depths as it might have penetrated atelescope. He noted, for example, how the light of the sun at the summersolstice entered the temple of Amen-Ra at Karnak and penetrated along its axisto the sanctuary. Lockyer was also the first to suggest that Stonehenge had beenconstructed as a sort of observatory—a view now generally accepted.The significance of Lockyer’s method was that it enabled him to date Stonehengeto 1680 BC, and the Karnak temple—or at least its original plan—to about 3700BC. He noted that sun temples were designed to catch the sun at the solstice(when the sun is furthest from the equator) or the equinox (when the sun isabove it), and star temples to catch the star’s heliacal rising (just beforedawn), again at a solstice. But he also noted that a sun temple could serve as a‘calendar’ for much longer than a star temple. This is because a star temple issubject to the precession of the equinoxes already mentioned. Although itamounts to a tiny fraction—1/72 of a degree per annum (causing the stars to risetwenty minutes later each year) it obviously adds up over the centuries, cominga full circle every 25,920 years. The result was that star temples had to berealigned every century or so—Lockyer pointed out evidence that the Luxor templehad been realigned four times, explaining its curious and irregular shape, towhich Schwaller de Lubicz was to devote so many years of study.According to Lockyer, the earliest Egyptian temples, at Heliopolis and Annu,were oriented to northern stars at the summer solstice, while the Giza pyramidswere built by ‘a new invading race’ who were far more astronomicallysophisticated, and used both northern and eastern stars.But why should the Egyptians take such a deep interest in the heavens? Onereason, as we have already observed, is that farmers need a calendar—in 3200 BC,the ‘dog star’ Sirius became the most important star in the heavens because itrose at dawn at the beginning of the Egyptian New Year, when the Nile began torise. But for the Egyptians, the stars were not merely seasonal indicators. Theywere also the home of the gods who presided over life and death.And it was this recognition that would form the basis of one of the mostinteresting insights into the Great Pyramid since the days of Proctor.In 1979, a Belgian construction engineer named Robert Bauval was on his way toEgypt, and bought at London’s Heathrow Airport a book called The Sirius Mysteryby Robert Temple.The book had caused some sceptical reviewers to classify Temple with Erich vonDaniken; but this is hardly fair. Temple’s starting point was a genuinescientific mystery: that an African tribe called the Dogon (in Mali) have knownfor a long time that the dog star Sirius is actually a double star, with an‘invisible’ companion. Astronomers had suspected this companion, Sirius B, sincethe 1830s, when Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel noted the perturbations in the orbit ofSirius, and reasoned that there must be an incredibly dense but invisiblestar—what we now call a white dwarf, in which atoms have collapsed in onthemselves, so that a piece the size of a pinhead weighs many tons. According tothe Dogon, their knowledge of Sirius B—which they called the Digitaria star—wasbrought to them by fishlike creatures called the Nommo, who came from Siriusthousands of years ago. It was not until 1928, when Sir Arthur Addingtonpostulated the existence of ‘white dwarfs’, that knowledge of Sirius B ceased tobe the province of a few astronomers. It seems inconceivable that some Europeantraveller could have brought such knowledge to the Dogon long before that. Inany case, the Dogon possessed cult masks relating to Sirius, stored in caves,some of them centuries old.As Temple discovered when he went to Paris to study with anthropologist GermaineDieterlen—who, with Marcel Griaule, had spent years among the Dogon—the Dogonseemed to have a surprisingly detailed knowledge of the solar system. They knewthe planets revolved around the sun, that the moon was ‘dry and dead’, and thatSaturn had rings and Jupiter had moons. Dieterlen noted that the Babyloniansalso believed that their civilisation was founded by fish gods.Since the dog star (so called because it is in the constellation Canis Major)was the sacred star of the Egyptians after 3200 BC (called Sothis and identifiedwith the goddess Isis), Temple speculated that the Dogon gained their knowledgefrom the Egyptians, and that the fact that the goddess Isis is so often to befound in boat paintings with two fellow goddesses, Anukis and Satis, couldindicate that the ancient Egyptians also knew that Sirius is actually a treblesystem, consisting of Sirius, Sirius B, and the home of the Nommo.But, surely, such knowledge would be contained in hieroglyphic inscriptions fromancient Egypt? Temple disagreed, pointing out that Griaule had had to beinitiated into the religious secrets of the Dogon after ritual preparation. Ifthe Egyptians knew about Sirius B, such knowledge would be reserved forinitiates.‘Ancient astronaut’ enthusiasts would suggest—and have suggested—that this‘proves’ that the ancient Egyptian civilisation was also founded by ‘gods fromspace’, but Temple is far more cautious, merely remarking on the mystery of aprimitive African tribe having such a sophisticated knowledge of astronomy.Reading Temple’s book reawakened Bauval’s interest in astronomy, and he pursuedit during his time in the Sudan, and subsequently in Saudi Arabia. Back inEgypt, in his home town Alexandria, in 1982, he drove at dawn to Giza, where hewas startled to see a desert jackal near the third pyramid, that of Menkaura (orMycerinos). These animals are seldom seen, and this reminded him of the curiousstory of how one of the most amazing discoveries in Egyptology came about. In1879, the head of a gang of workmen at Saqqara had noticed a jackal near thepyramid of Unas, last pharaoh of the 5th Dynasty (c. 2300 BC), and when thejackal vanished into a low passage of the pyramid, the workman followed,probably hoping to find treasure. His light showed him that he was in a chamberwhose walls and ceiling were covered with beautiful hieroglyphics. This wasastonishing, as the pyramids of the Giza complex were devoid of inscriptions.These became known as the Pyramid Texts and—like the later Book of theDead—contained rituals concerning the king’s journey to the afterlife. Fivepyramids proved to contain such texts. They are probably the oldest religiouswritings in the world.Now Bauval drove on to Saqqara, to renew his acquaintance with the pyramid textsof Unas, and found himself reflecting on passages in which the king declaresthat his soul is a star. Did he mean simply that his soul was immortal? Or didhe mean—as J. H. Breasted had once suggested—that his soul would literallybecome a star in heaven? One of the texts says: ‘Oh king, you are this greatstar, the companion of Orion, who traverses the sky with Orion...’ Theconstellation of Orion was sacred to the Egyptians, since it was regarded as thehome of the god Osiris. In the sky slightly below Orion—and to the left—standsSirius, the star of Osiris’s consort Isis. Bauval found himself reflecting onthe mystery of the Pyramid Texts, and why they appear only in five pyramidsdating from the 5th and 6th Dynasties—that is, over a period of about a century.The Egyptologist Wallis-Budge, noting the sheer confusion of some of the texts,remarked that the scribes themselves probably did not understand what they werewriting, and that therefore the texts were probably copies of far olderdocuments...The visit to Saqqara was still fresh in Bauval’s mind the next day when hevisited Cairo Museum. There he noticed a large poster with an aerial photographof the Giza pyramids. Now he was suddenly struck by the fact that the thirdpyramid is oddly out-of-line with the other two. The four sides of each pyramidpoint precisely to the four points of the compass, and it would be possible totake a gigantic ruler and draw a straight line from the north-eastern corner ofthe Great Pyramid to the south-western corner of the Chefren pyramid. You wouldexpect this line to extend on to the corners of the Menkaura pyramid; in fact,it would miss it by about two hundred feet. Why this dissatisfying lack ofsymmetry?Bauval was struck by another question. Why is the third pyramid so much smallerthan its two companions, when the Pharaoh Menkaura was just as powerful as histwo predecessors?More than a year later, in November 1983, Bauval was in the desert of SaudiArabia on a camping expedition. At 3 a.m., he woke up and stared overhead at theMilky Way, which looked like a river flowing across space. And to its rightthere was a tiara of bright stars which he recognised as Orion, which theancient Egyptians identified with Osiris. He went to the top of a dune, and wasjoined by a friend who was also interested in astronomy, and who proceeded toexplain to him how mariners find the rising point of Sirius above the horizon bylooking at the three stars in Orion’s ‘belt’. (Orion, the Hunter, is shapedroughly like an hour-glass, and the belt goes around its ‘waist’.) ‘Actually,’added the friend, ‘the three stars of Orion’s belt are not perfectly aligned—thesmallest is slightly offset to the east.’ At this point Bauval interrupted himwith a shout of: ‘Je tiens l’affaire’—‘I’ve got it!’ These were the wordsuttered by the Egyptologist Champollion when he realised that the Rosetta Stonehad handed him the key to hieroglyphics.What Bauval had ‘got’ was an answer to his question about why Menkaura’s pyramidwas smaller than the other two, and offset to the east. They were intended torepresent the stars of Orion’s belt. And the Milky Way was the River Nile.What Bauval did not know at this time was that a connection between the GreatPyramid and Orion’s Belt had been the subject of a paper in an academic journalof Oriental studies as long ago as 1964. The author was an American astronomernamed Virginia Trimble, and she had been asked by an Egyptologist namedAlexander Badawy to help him verify his theory that the southern ‘air shaft’ inthe King’s Chamber pointed straight at Orion at the time the Great Pyramid wasbuilt, round about 2550 BC. Virginia Trimble had done the necessarycalculations, and was able to tell Badawy that he was correct: the air shaft hadpointed straight at Orion’s Belt around 2550 BC. In other words, if you had beenthin enough to lie in the air shaft, you would have seen Orion’s belt passdirectly overhead every night. Of course, hundreds of other stars would alsopass—but none of this magnitude.If the pyramids of Giza were supposed to be the three stars of Orion’sBelt—Zeta, Epsilon and Delta—was it not possible that other pyramids mightrepresent other stars in Orion? In fact, Bauval realised that the pyramid ofNebka at Abu Ruwash corresponded to the star at the Hunter’s left foot, and thepyramid at Zawyat al-Aryan to the star at his right shoulder. It would, ofcourse, have been utterly conclusive if the ‘hour-glass’ shape had beencompleted by two other pyramids, but unfortunately these had either never beenbuilt, or had long since vanished under the sand.But what did it all mean? Badawy had surmised that the southern shaft of theKing’s Chamber was not an air vent, but a channel to direct the dead pharaoh’ssoul to Orion, where he would become a god. In other words, the ritual ceremonyto release the pharaoh’s soul from his body would take place when the shaft wastargeted, like a gun barrel, on Orion, and the pharaoh’s soul would fly therelike a missile.One thing bothered Bauval. Virginia Trimble’s calculations seemed to show thatthe gun barrel was targeted on the middle star of Orion’s Belt—the one thatcorresponded to Chefren’s pyramid—when it should have been targeted on thesouthern star, Zeta Orionis, which corresponded to the Great Pyramid. Thisproblem was finally solved by a German engineer named Rudolf Gantenbrink, whohad been hired to de-humidify the Pyramid, and who had made a tiny tractor-likerobot that could crawl up the shafts. His robot had revealed that the shaftswere slightly steeper than Flinders Petrie had thought. Petrie had estimated thesouthern shaft at 44° 30', when it was actually 45°. This new measurement meantthat the gun barrel was directly targeted on Zeta Orionis—although a centurylater than is generally believed. If Bauval was correct, the Pyramid was builtbetween 2475 BC and 2400 BC.Bauval’s curiosity now centred on the ‘air shafts’ in the Queen’sChamber—shafts, in fact, that could not have been intended as air vents becausethey were closed at both ends. With the aid of a computer Bauval worked outwhere the southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber had been pointing when thePyramid was built. It confirmed his speculations: the shaft was targeted onSirius, the star of Isis.What was emerging was a highly convincing picture of the purpose of the GreatPyramid: not a tomb, but a ritual building—a kind of temple—whose purpose was tosend the soul of the Pharaoh Cheops flying to Zeta Orionis—called by theEgyptians al-Nitak—where it would reign for ever as Osiris.And what was the purpose of the Queen’s Chamber? From the alignment of its shafton Sirius, Bauval believed that it was a ritual chamber for an earlier part ofthe ceremony: that in which the son of the dead pharaoh performed a ritualcalled ‘the opening of the mouth’, designed to restore life to the pharaoh. Hehad to open the mouth using an instrument called the sacred adze, which was madeof meteoric iron. (Iron in ancient Egypt was an extremely rare metal, found onlyin meteorites; since it came from the skies, the Egyptians believed that thebones of the gods were made of iron.) In illustrations of this ceremony, theking is shown with an erect phallus, for a part of the ceremony concerned himcopulating with the goddess Isis—hence the alignment of the shaft on Sirius, thestar of Isis.Now all this had one extremely interesting implication. According to the usualview, the three pyramids of Giza were built by three separate pharaohs as theirtombs. But if they represented the stars of Orion’s Belt, then the whole lay-outmust have been planned long before the Great Pyramid was started. When?To understand how Bauval approached this problem, we must return to theprecession of the equinoxes—the wobble on the earth’s axis that causes itsposition in relation to the stars to change—one degree over 72 years, and acomplete circle every 26,000 years. Where Orion was concerned, this wobblecauses the constellation to travel upwards in the sky for 13,000 years, thendownwards again. But as it does this, the constellation also tilts slightly—inother words, the hour-glass turns clockwise, then back.Bauval noted that the only time the pattern of the pyramids on the ground is aperfect reflection of the stars in Orion’s Belt—and not tilted sideways—was in10,450 BC. This is also its lowest point in the sky. After this, it began torise again, and will reach its highest point about AD 2550. In the year 10,450BC, it was as if the sky was an enormous mirror, in which the course of the Nilewas ‘reflected’ as the Milky Way, and the Giza pyramids as the Belt of Orion.And it is at this point in his book The Orion Mystery that Bauval raises aquestion whose boldness—after so many chapters of precise scientific andmathematical argument—makes the hair prickle. ‘Was the Giza Necropolis and,specifically, the Great Pyramid and its shafts, a great marker of time, a sortof star-clock to mark the epochs of Osiris and, more especially, his FirstTime?’This ‘First Time’ of Osiris was called by the Egyptians Zep Tepi, and it was thetime when the gods fraternised with humans—the equivalent of the Greek myth ofthe Golden Age.The date 10,450 BC has no meaning for historians, for it is ‘prehistoric’, aboutthe time when the first farmers appeared in the Middle East. But Bauval remindsus that there is one date in mythology that is reasonably close. According toPlato’s Timaeus, when the Greek statesman Solon visited Egypt around 600 BC,Egyptian priests told him the story of the destruction of Atlantis, about ninethousand years earlier, and how it had sunk beneath the waves. The story wasgenerally discounted because it also told how the Atlanteans had fought againstthe Athenians, and Athens was certainly not founded as long ago as 9600 BC.Yet—as we know—the Atlantis story has haunted the European imagination eversince.Bauval points out that, in the Timaeus, Plato not only reports Solon’s accountof Atlantis, but adds that Plato also says that God made ‘souls in equal numberwith the stars, and distributed them, each soul to a different star... and hewho should live well for his due span of time should journey back to thehabitation of his consort star.’ This certainly sounds a typically Egyptianconception.Having risked offending the Egyptologists by raising the subject of Atlantis,Bauval now goes further, and mentions that the clairvoyant Edgar Cayce statedthat the Great Pyramid was planned around 10,400 BC. Amusingly enough, theauthority he quotes on this matter is none other than the arch-enemy of West’sSphinx thesis, Mark Lehner. It seems that Lehner was (and possibly still is)financed by the Cayce Foundation, and began his career as a follower of Cayce;in The Egyptian Heritage, Lehner argued that the ‘Atlantis events’ in ancientEgypt (i.e. the arrival of the Atlanteans) probably occurred in 10,400 BC. (Itshould be added that Lehner has now spurned these early divagations, andreverted to orthodoxy—he is now regarded as the leading expert on the pyramids.)Edgar Cayce (pronounced Casey) is a strange and puzzling figure. Born on a farmin Kentucky in 1877, he seems to have been a fairly normal child except for oneodd ability—he could sleep with his head on a book, and wake up knowingeverything in it. When he left the farm he married and embarked on life as asalesman—although it had always been his ambition to become a preacher. When hewas 21, his voice suddenly disappeared, and the fact that it came back underhypnosis, but vanished again when he woke up, suggested that the problem wasmental rather than physical—in fact, that Cayce was unconsciously longing togive up his job as a salesman. Placed under hypnosis again by a man named AlLayne, Cayce accurately diagnosed his own problem and prescribed its cure. Laynethen decided to consult Cayce—again funder hypnosis—about his own medicalproblems, and Cayce explained how they should be treated. When he woke up andlooked at the notes (Layne had made, he insisted that he had never heard of mostof the medical terms.After that, Cayce discovered that he had the ability to diagnose—and prescribefor—illness when he was in a hypnotic trance, and his celebrity spread.In 1923, when he was in his mid-forties, he was shocked to learn one day that hehad been preaching the doctrine of reincarnation while in his trance state. Adevout and orthodox Christian, he nevertheless came to accept the idea thathuman beings are reborn again and again.It was when he was describing the past life of a fourteen-year-old boy thatCayce declared that the boy had lived in Atlantis about 10,000 BC. From thenuntil the end of his life, Cayce continued to add fragments about Atlantis. Someof these comments seemed designed to cause sceptics to erupt into fury, and toarouse doubts even in the most open-minded student of the past. According toCayce, Atlantis occupied a place in the Atlantic Ocean from the Sargasso Sea tothe Azores, and had a flourishing civilisation dating back to 200,000 BC. TheAtlanteans’ civilisation was highly developed, and they possessed some kind of‘crystal stone’ for trapping the rays of the sun; they also possessed steampower, gas and electricity. Unfortunately, their prosperity finally made themgreedy and corrupt, so they were ripe for the destruction that finally came uponthem. This occurred in periods, one about 15,600 BC, and the last about 10,000BC. By then, Atlanteans had dispersed to Europe and South America. Theirarchives, Cayce says, will be found in three parts of the world, including Giza.He forecast that Atlantis would begin to rise again, in the area of Bimini, in1968 and 1969. He also forecast that documents proving the existence of Atlantiswould be found in a chamber below the Sphinx.Cayce’s biographer Jess Starn has stated that his ‘batting average onpredictions was incredibly high, close to one hundred per cent’, but this ishardly borne out by the facts. It is true that a few of his trance statementshave proved weirdly accurate—such as that the Nile once flowed west (geologicalstudies have showed it once flowed into Lake Chad, halfway between the presentNile and the Atlantic ocean), that a community known as the Essenes lived nearthe Dead Sea (verified by the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls two years afterhis death), and that two American presidents would die in office (as Rooseveltand Kennedy did). But critics point out the sheer vagueness of many of hisprophecies, and the fact that so many of them quite simply miss the mark. Askedin 1938 if there would be a war that would involve the United States between1942 and 1944, he missed a golden opportunity to prove his prophetic credentialsby answering that this depended on whether there was a desire for peace. Askedwhat might cause such a war he replied: ‘Selfishness’—which, in view of Hitler’santi-Semitism, and his desire to see the Aryan race conquering the world, seemsto be oversimplification. Asked about China and Japan, he explained that ‘theprinciple of the Christian faith will be carried forward through the turmoilsthat are a part of events. . .’, which is again so wide of the mark as to countas a definite miss. Asked about Spain, then nearing the end of its murderouscivil war, he declared that its troubles were only just beginning; in fact,Franco’s rule would bring many decades of peace, followed by a peacefultransition to democracy. Asked about Russia he was exceptionally vague, merelydeclaring that ‘turmoils’ would continue until freedom of speech and the rightto religious worship was allowed. Asked about the role of Great Britain, Caycereplied with Delphic obscurity: ‘When its activities are set in such a way as tobring consideration of every phase, Britain will be able to control the worldfor peace...’, which must be again counted a fairly wide miss.Some of Cayce’s more alarming prophecies were that the earth would be subject toa period of cataclysm between 1958 and the end of the century, that Los Angeles,San Francisco and New York would all be destroyed, while Japan would vanishbeneath the Pacific; in fact, although there is still time (writing in 1995) forCayce to prove correct, there have so far been no more cataclysms than in anyother similar period of history.Anyone who is familiar with the history of the paranormal will recognise EdgarCayce as a typical example of a highly gifted psychic—with all the disadvantagesthat seems to entail. Psychical research seems to be subject to a curiouslimitation which might be labelled ‘James’s Law’, after the philosopher WilliamJames, who declared that there always seems to be just enough evidence toconvince the believers, and never quite enough to convince the sceptics. All thegreat psychics and clairvoyants have had enough successes to prove theirgenuineness, and enough failures to prove that they are highly fallible. Cayceis clearly no exception.It must be admitted that, at this point in this book, Cayce is something of adigression—Bauval makes only a brief and passing reference to him—and to ‘TheAtlantis events’—in The Orion Mystery. Yet the curious coincidence of thedate—10,400 BC—raises an important question: why should the pyramid buildersarrange the Giza pyramids to reflect the position of Orion’s Belt in 10,450 BC?It is hard to disagree with Bauval that they wished to indicate this date as animportant time in their history—probably as the beginning of their epoch, their‘Genesis’.The Giza pyramids took at least three generations to build: Cheops, Chefren andMenkaura, extending over about a century. It seems, then, that Chefren andMenkaura were building according to a plan. It is possible that this plan wasdrawn up by Cheops and his priests. But, as Bauval has shown, it is arguablethat the plan was there from the beginning—10,450 BC. There is evidence that thegreat Gothic cathedrals were planned centuries before they were built; Bauval issuggesting that this is also true of the pyramids of Giza.And if we accept the arguments of West and Schoch about the water-weathering ofthe Sphinx, then it seems likely that West is correct in assigning the Sphinx to10,450 BC.Let us, then, merely for the sake of argument, assume that both West and Bauvalare correct. Let us suppose that the survivors of some catastrophe came to Egyptin the middle of the 11th millennium BC, and began trying to reconstruct afragment of their lost culture in exile. They begin by carving the front part ofthe Sphinx from an outcrop of hard limestone on the banks of the Nile. It facedsunrise on the spring (vernal) equinox. At some subsequent period they go on toexcavate the limestone below it, and carve the lion’s body.Why a lion? Because, suggests Graham Hancock, the age in which the Sphinx wasbuilt was the Age of Leo. We have seen that the wobble of the earth’s axis—whichcauses the precession of the equinoxes—means that it moves like the hour hand ofa clock, pointing to a different constellation every 2,160 years. The Age of Leolasted from 10,970 to 8810 BC. Hancock clinches his argument by asking if it iscoincidence that in the Age of Pisces (our present age) the symbol ofChristianity is the fish, that in the preceding Age of Aries, we find ramssacrificed in the Old Testament, and an upsurge of the ram god Amon in Egypt,while in the previous Age of Taurus the Egyptians worshipped Apis, the bull, andthe bull-cult flourished in Minoan Crete.So these proto-Egyptians began to plan their great sky temple in the 11thmillennium BC, and continued for the next thousand years or so, probablybuilding the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple with the giant blocks removedfrom around the Sphinx. They may also have built the Oseirion near Abydos, andmany other monuments that have now vanished beneath the sand.In that case, it seems incredible that they failed to make a start on thepyramid complex. Hancock points out that the lower half of the Chefren pyramidis built of ‘Cyclopean blocks’, while halfway up it changes to smaller blocks,which may suggest that it was started at a much earlier stage. West alsoremarks: ‘On the eastern side of Chefren’s pyramid the blocks are particularlyhuge, as much as 20 feet (6.4 m) long and one foot (.3 m) thick...’But if part of Chefren’s pyramid was built, it seems unlikely that the GreatPyramid remained in blueprint. The heart of the Great Pyramid, according toIodden Edwards in The Pyramids of Egypt, consists of ‘a nucleus of rock, thesize of which cannot be precisely determined’. This could have been a mound ofconsiderable size, possibly a ‘sacred mound’. Possibly the lower chamber wasalso cut out of the rock at this time, forming a kind of crypt. And if thepyramids were intended to mirror the stars in Orion’s Belt, then it seems morelikely that a start was also made on the third pyramid, of Menkaura. It is evenpossible that was another sacred mound on this site.Why should these proto-Egyptians not have gone on to complete all threepyramids?The obvious suggestion is that if only a small group of them arrived inEgypt—perhaps a hundred or so—then they simply lacked the manpower. What theyneeded, to begin with, was simply a religious centre—the equivalent of StPeter’s in Rome or St Paul’s in London. The Sphinx and the sacred mound—ormounds—would have provided this.But, as we shall see in a later chapter, Robert Bauval and Graham Hancock haveproduced a far more interesting and plausible suggestion—a suggestion based oncomputer-created simulations of the skies over Egypt between 10,500 and 2500 BC.We have no way of guessing what might have happened between these two dates. Fewcivilisations flourish for more than a few thousand years, and so it seemsunlikely that this proto-Egyptian civilisation lasted until pharaonic times. Asa civilisation, it may not even have lasted until the sixth or fifth millenniumBC, when (according to Encyclopaedia Britannica) Stone Age people began tomigrate into the Nile valley and grow crops. The notion that Stone Age cultures(the Tasian, Badarian and Naqadan) could exist side by side with the remains ofproto-Egyptian culture suggests that the proto-Egyptians were nothing more thana priestly remnant—perhaps living, like the Essenes of a later age, in someequivalent of the Dead Sea caves, and preserving their knowledge as themonasteries of the Dark Ages preserved European learning.As we shall see later, there is a certain amount of evidence for the existenceof this priestly cast—sometimes referred to as ‘the Companions of Osiris’—in themillennia between 10,500 and 2500 BC.What we do know is that—perhaps as early as 4000 BC—Egypt began to unite into anation. A work called the Turin Papyrus—unfortunately badly damaged when it wassent to the Turin Museum without proper packing—mentions nine dynasties of kingsof Egypt before Menes. Before that, it says, Egypt was ruled by gods anddemigods—the latter may mean some priestly caste. The Palermo Stone mentions 120kings before Menes. The third-century BC Egyptian priest Manetho also produced alist which reaches back to a distant age of gods, and covers nearly 25,000years.What seems clear, if Schwaller de Lubicz is correct, is that there came a pointwhen the 'demigods’ or priests became the mentors of early pharaoniccivilisation, and taught them geometry, science and medicine.But were they mentors in any practical sense? If they were, then we have toanswer some difficult historical puzzles.About a century before Cheops, the pharaoh Zoser built an impressive funeralcomplex at Saqqara, including the famous Step Pyramid. This was supervised bythe legendary architect Imhotep, who was also Zoser’s Grand Vizier, and probablyHigh Priest. The Greeks called him Aesclepius, and made him the god of medicine.He sounds as if he might well be a descendant of the ‘New Race’. The StepPyramid was started as a mastaba—a mud-brick tomb covered with stucco—and thenenlarged literally step by step, until it was six ‘storeys’ high. It seems tohave provided the Old Kingdom Egyptians with the idea of creating pyramids.Two generations after Zoser came the Pharaoh Snofru (or Snefru), the father ofCheops, whom the ancient Egyptians believed ordered the construction of apyramid at Meidum (in fact, it is now believed to have been built by Huni, thelast of the 3rd Dynasty pharaohs), which looks unfinished. All that stands nowis a huge square tower (in two stages) on the top of what looks like a hill. Itwas not until 1974 that a German physicist named Kurt Mendelssohn pointed outwhy the pyramid is unfinished: it collapsed before it was completed—probablywith immense loss of life. The ‘hill’ on which it appears to be standing is apile of rubble. The pharaoh started by building a seven-storey pyramid, thenadded an eighth. At this point, it was decided to convert it into what is almostcertainly the first smooth pyramid by adding packing blocks, and a layer ofheavy casing stone. Bad workmanship was probably responsible for one of thecasing stones being squeezed out of place by the accumulated sideways thrust ofthe pyramid, and the remainder must have collapsed like an avalanche withinseconds.This, Mendelssohn argues,4 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark10] is why anotherpyramid, the so-called Bent Pyramid at Dahshur, changes to a less steep anglehalfway up. In all probability, it too was built by Snofru, and the fact thatits angle becomes less steep suggests that its architect had profited from theearlier disaster.Mendelssohn’s central argument is that the pyramids were not built as tombs, butin order to unite many tribes into a nation-state by giving them a common task.It is an interesting argument, but it sounds like the theory of a modern liberalwho was a pupil of Einstein (as Mendelssohn was), rather than that of anEgyptologist. Why did Snofru not get them to do something more practical, likeconstruct a Nile dam, or vast granaries? We feel intuitively that, whatever thepurpose of the pyramids, it had something to do with Egyptian religion.The fiasco at Meidum seems to contradict Schwaller’s theory that the swiftemergence of pharaonic civilisation was due to its Atlantean legacy. Admittingthat the skill shown in the building of the Great Pyramid suggests an ancientand highly sophisticated civilisation, we are still entitled to ask: where werethe Atlanteans when Snofru’s architect was revealing his incompetence?The answer could nevertheless be simple. If the Sphinx-builders had lived forthousands of years in the same isolation as monks in the Dark Ages, nothing ismore likely than that they had lost their constructive skills, and had to learnthem all over again.Then why assume they played any part in pharaonic Egypt? Is it not conceivablethat they had vanished from the face of the earth, leaving behind only a libraryof mouldering papyri that few people could decipher? Why should we assume thatthey emerged from their isolation and began to play a practical part in thereligion of the pharaohs?Well, there is, to begin with, one intriguing piece of evidence. Boats.In May 1954, an archaeologist named Kamal el-Mallakh discovered a rectangularpit on the south side of the Great Pyramid—103 feet long and 17½ feet deep. Sixfeet down there was a ceiling of huge limestone roofing blocks, some weighing 15tons. Under this roof lay a dismantled boat made of cedar wood. Whenreconstructed—it took fourteen years—the result was a ship 143 feet long, aslarge as those that carried the Vikings across the Atlantic. John West describesit as ‘a far more seaworthy craft than anything available to Columbus’. ThorHeyerdahl disagrees; speaking of this same craft in The Ra Expeditions, he saysthat ‘the streamlined hull would have collapsed on its first encounter withocean waves’. It was built, he says, for ‘pomp and ceremony’, and was intendedfor use of the pharaoh in the afterlife. Yet he also acknowledges that ‘he hadbuilt it on architectonic lines which the world’s leading seafaring nationsnever surpassed. He had built his frail river boat to a pattern created byshipbuilders from a people with a long, solid tradition of sailing on the opensea.’ (My italics.)Now Heyerdahl, if anyone, should recognise the design of a seagoing craft whenhe sees it. In fact, it is his contention that these early Egyptians could havesailed across the Atlantic on a ship made of papyrus reeds. But he can scarcelybe said to have proved it, for his papyrus ship was virtually under water by thetime it reached Barbados.Obviously, this raises a central question. If Khufu’s ship was designed ‘to apattern created by shipbuilders from a people with a long, solid tradition ofsailing on the open sea’, who were these shipbuilders? There was very littletimber in Egypt, until large quantities began to be imported towards the end ofthe 3rd Dynasty—Khufu’s father Snofru built a fleet of 60 ships.5[../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark11] But during the early dynasties, they couldhardly be described as a people with a long tradition of sailing the open sea;after all, they had been—according to orthodox history—wandering nomads only afew centuries earlier.When Graham Hancock was at Abydos, he was reminded of another facet of thismystery when he went to see a whole graveyard of boats buried in the deserteight miles from the Nile—no less than a dozen ships, some of them 72 feet long.This is only about half the length of the Khufu ship—but then, they date fromfive centuries earlier—Hancock quotes a Guardian report (21 December 1991) whichstates that they are 5000 years old. Again, the design was of seagoing ships,not Nile boats.Agreeing that these ships—and another found in a second pit near the GreatPyramid—were purely ritual objects, intended for the use of the dead pharaoh,where did the ancient Egyptians get the design from?According to Schwaller de Lubicz—and West—the answer is: from survivors fromAtlantis, who arrived in ships. But is there any evidence of the use of seagoingships before the age of the pharaohs?As it happens, there is."},{"pageContent":"4 THE FORBIDDEN WORDIn 1966, an American professor of the history of science named Charles H.Hapgood caused widespread controversy with a book called Maps of the Ancient SeaKings. The reason becomes clear from the title of his final chapter: ‘ACivilisation that Vanished’, which begins:The evidence presented by the ancient maps appears to suggest the existence inremote times, before the rise of any known cultures, of a true civilisation, ofan advanced kind, which either was localised in one area but had worldwidecommerce, or was, in a real sense, a worldwide culture. This culture, at leastin some respects, was more advanced than the civilisations of Greece and Rome.In geodesy, nautical science, and mapmaking it was more advanced than any knownculture before the 18th century of the Christian Era. It was only in the 18thcentury that we developed a practical means of finding longitude. It was in the18th century that we first accurately measured the circumference of the earth.Not until the 19th century did we begin to send out ships for exploration intothe Arctic or Antarctic Seas and only then did we begin the exploration of thebottom of the Atlantic. The maps indicate that some ancient people did all thesethings.It was unfortunate for Hapgood that in the following year, 1967, these sameancient maps figured prominently in a book called Chariots of the Gods? by Erichvon Daniken, whose purpose was to demonstrate that they proved the earth hadbeen visited in remote ages by visitors from outer space. How otherwise, Danikenasked, could ancient man have accurately plotted the coast of South America, andthe North and South Poles, unless they had seen them from the air? Von Daniken’smany inaccuracies, and the sensational nature of his theories, caused a violentreaction among serious scholars, who decided that the whole thing was a bubbleof absurdity. And as Daniken’s inaccuracies were exposed (for example,multiplying the weight of the Great Pyramid by five), the idea gradually gotaround that the whole question of the ‘maps of the ancient sea kings’ was anexploded myth.This was totally untrue. More than a quarter of a century after its publication,the evidence of Hapgood’s book remains as solid and as unshaken as ever.In September 1956, Hapgood had been deeply involved in the study of anothermystery, that of the great Ice Ages, when he heard of an intriguing puzzle thatsounded as if it might have some bearing on his enquiries. On 26 August 1956,there had been a radio discussion of an ancient map known as the Piri Re’is map,which had been the property of a Turkish pirate who had been beheaded in 1554. Apanel of respectable academics and scientists had supported the view that thismap appeared to show the South Pole as it had been before it was covered withice.The controversy had arisen because earlier that year, a Turkish naval officerhad presented the US Navy Hydrographic Office with a copy of the Piri Re’is map,whose original had been found in the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul in 1929. It waspainted on parchment and dated 1513, and showed the Atlantic Ocean, with a smallpart of the coast of Africa on the right, and the whole coast of South Americaon the left. And, at the bottom of the map, what looked like Antarctica.The map was passed on to the Hydrographic Office’s cartographic expert, W. I.Walters, who in turn had shown it to a friend named Captain Arlington H.Mallery, who studied old Viking maps. It was after he had studied the map athome that Mallery made the astonishing statement that he believed it showed thecoast of Antarctica as it had been before it was covered by thick ice. Itappeared to show certain bays in Queen Maud Land as they had been before theywere frozen over. In 1949 an expedition mounted by Norway, Sweden and Britainhad taken sonar soundings through the ice—which in places was a mile thick—anddiscovered these long-vanished bays.It was amazing enough that a sixteenth-century map should show Antarctica, whichhad not been discovered until 1818, but that it should show Antarctica as it hadbeen in prehistoric times seemed preposterous. Indignant scholars had said asmuch, which is why the panel of experts had gathered at Georgetown University,in Washington DC, to defend Mallery. All this excited Hapgood, for he had beenarguing that the polar ice caps had built up fairly quickly—over thousandsrather than millions of years—and that they caused the earth to wobble and thecontinents to move around. He had gone on to suggest that great masses ofdislodged ice caused major catastrophes, and that the last of these catastropheshad occurred about fifteen thousand years ago, when Antarctica was 2,500 milescloser to the equator.Hapgood contacted Captain Mallery, who impressed him as sincere and honest. Helearned from him that the Library of Congress had already possessed facsimilesof the Piri Re’is map even before the officer brought a copy to the HydrographicOffice, and that it possessed many more such maps. They were calledportolans—meaning ‘from port to port’—and were used by mariners in the MiddleAges. And Hapgood was startled to learn that these maps had been known toscholars for centuries, but that no one had paid much attention to them. Hethereupon decided to involve his students at Keene State College, New Hampshire,in a full-scale study of the maps.Why had no one paid much attention to them? To begin with, because they had beenmade by medieval mariners, and were assumed to be full of errors andinaccuracies. Why take the trouble to compare them with more modern maps?But at least one scholar—E. E. Nordenskiold, who compiled an atlas of portolansin 1889—was convinced that they were based on charts that were far more ancientthan the Middle Ages. They were too accurate to have been drawn by medievalsailors. Moreover, charts dating from the sixteenth century showed no sign ofdevelopment from those of the fourteenth century, which sounded as if both werebased on older maps. Moreover, Nordenskiold also noted that the portolans weremore accurate than the maps of the great geographer and astronomer Ptolemy, whowas active in Alexandria around AD 150. Was it likely that ordinary seamen couldsurpass Ptolemy, unless they had ancient maps to guide them?Hapgood’s students decided that the simplest way of attacking the problem wouldbe to put themselves in the position of the original mapmakers (or, in somecases, mapmaker—for it often looked as if many later maps had been based on thesame original chart). As everyone knows, the first problem in creating a map isthat the world is a globe, and a flat piece of paper is bound to distort itsproportions. In 1569, Gerald Mercator solved the problem by ‘projecting’ theglobe on to a flat surface, and dividing it up into latitude and longitude, themethod we still use. But this is because we know the whole globe. How would anancient mapmaker, who knew perhaps only his own country, go about it?The sensible way, the students decided, would be to choose some centre for themap, draw a circle around it, then subdivide this circle into various segments,like a cake—sixteen seemed to make sense. Then if they had to extend beyond thecircle, they would probably stick squares on the edge of every ‘slice’.Piri Re’is had admitted that he had combined twenty maps together, and he hadoften allowed them to overlap—or fail to overlap. So he had shown the Amazonriver twice, but left out a 900-mile stretch of the coastline of South America.Hapgood and his students had—so to speak—to reason their way back to theoriginal twenty maps.The first question was: where was the original ‘centre’? Long study left themto, conclude that it was off the map, but that it was probably in Egypt.Alexandria seemed the obvious choice. Hapgood involved a friend who was amathematician, to try to find the answer by trigonometry (fortunately, he hadnot been told that experts thought the charts were not based on trigonometry).It took three years to find the solution. When it finally became clear that theplace they were looking for had to be situated on the Tropic of Cancer, theyrealised that only one ancient city seemed to fit the requirements—Syene, nowknown as Aswan, the site of the modern dam.Syene, in upper Egypt, has one interesting distinction; it was the place fromwhich the Greek scholar Eratosthenes, head of the Library of Alexandria, hadworked out the size of the earth around 200 BC.Eratosthenes happened to hear that on 21 June every year, the sun was reflectedat the bottom of a certain deep well in Syene—that is, it was directly overhead,so towers did not cast a shadow. But in Alexandria they did. All he had to dowas to measure the length of a shadow in Alexandria at midday on 21 June, andwork out from that the angle at which the sun’s rays were striking the tower.This proved to be 7½ degrees. And since the earth is a globe, then the distancefrom Syene to Alexandria must be 7½ degrees of the earth’s circumference. Sincehe knew the distance from Syene to Alexandria was 5000 stadia (or 500 miles),the rest was easy: 7½ goes into 360 forty-eight times, so the circumference ofthe earth must be 500 times 48—24,000 miles. (As we have seen, it is actuallycloser to 25,000, but Eratosthenes was amazingly close.)Now, Eratosthenes had made a small error, and increased the circumference of theearth by 4½ degrees. Hapgood discovered that if he allowed for this error, PiriRe’is’s map became even more accurate. This made it virtually certain that themap was based on ancient Greek models after Eratosthenes.But, reasoned Hapgood, when the geographers of Alexandria made their maps, it isunlikely that they sailed off to look at the various places they were mapping.They almost certainly used older maps—and then introduced the error. So theolder maps must have been even more accurate than those of Alexandria.As we saw in the last chapter, a tutor of one of the late Ptolemies,Agatharchides of Cnidus, was told that the base of the Great Pyramid was aneighth of a minute of a degree in length. And from this it is possible to workout that the pyramid builders knew that the circumference of the earth was justunder 25,000 miles, which is even more accurate than the estimate ofEratosthenes. This evidence leaves us in no doubt that the ancient Egyptians notonly knew that the earth was a globe, but knew its size to within a few miles.Clearly, this would seem to indicate one of two things: either the Egyptians hada navy capable of circumnavigating the globe, or they had access to informationfrom someone who did possess such a navy. (The third possibility—astronauts fromthe stars—seems, on the whole, rather lower on the scale of probability than theother two.) But we have already seen that one of the first pharaohs to possess anavy was Snofru, father of Cheops, and there would hardly have been time for hisships to sail around the earth and map it in detail before the Pyramid (with itsboat pits) was built. Margaret Murray points out that some of the pre-dynasticpeople of Egypt, the Gerzeans (around 3500 BC) represented ships in theirpottery decorations; but these ships have banks of oarsmen, and it seemsunlikely that the Gerzeans (possibly Cretans) rowed around the world. So we areleft with the possibility that there were seafarers who crossed the oceans longbefore dynastic Egypt.How long before? The Piri Re’is map of Queen Maud Land, at the South Pole, showsbays before they were covered with ice, and Hapgood estimated that the last timeAntarctica was free of ice was some time before 4000 BC. (Core samples taken bythe Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 1949 showed that the last warm period in theAntarctic ended then; the indications are that it began about 13,000 BC.)Someone had mapped Antarctica at least six thousand years ago, and possibly longbefore that. But a map is no use without some kind of writing on it, and theofficial date for the invention of writing is about 3500 BC (in Sumeria).Moreover, mapmaking is a sophisticated art, requiring some knowledge oftrigonometry and geometry. Again, we seem to be positing a highly developedcivilisation existing before 4000 BC. And since civilisations take a long timeto develop, it seems possible that we are speaking of thousands of years beforethis date.In November 1959, Hapgood made an appointment to look at other portolans at theLibrary of Congress. When he got into the conference room, he was embarrassed tofind literally hundreds of maps. He passed days looking over them, anddiscovered that many of them showed a southern continent. (In fact, Mercator hadshown it—but that was only because he believed it was there, not because he knewof it.) When he saw a map drawn by a man called Oronteus Finaeus in 1531, he wassuddenly transfixed. This not only showed the complete South Pole, as if seenfrom the air, but looked startlingly like the South Polar continent on modernmaps. It showed the same bays without the ice, rivers flowing to the sea, andeven mountains that are now buried under the ice.There was only one problem. Oronteus Finaeus had made Antarctica far too large.Then Hapgood discovered what seemed to be the explanation. For some odd reason,Oronteus Finaeus had drawn a small circle in the middle of his Antarctica andlabelled it ‘Antarctic Circle’. The real Antarctic Circle goes aroundAntarctica, in the sea. Then Hapgood realised that the circle he had drawn onhis own map to represent the 80th parallel was in the centre of his normal-sizedversion of the Antarctic, just about where Oronteus had drawn his own AntarcticCircle. Obviously, some earlier copyist of the original map had mistaken the80th parallel for the Antarctic Circle and mis-labelled it; the result of such amistake would be to make Antarctica about four times its proper size—just asOronteus Finaeus had done. Hapgood also concluded that the errors in the mapshowed that Oronteus Finaeus had constructed it out of many smaller overlappingmaps. Again, his reasoning pointed to far earlier—and more accurate—maps.The conclusion seemed to be inescapable. Some mapmaker had drawn Antarctica inthe days when it was free of ice. Moreover, the thoroughness of the map showedthat the mapmaker had spent some time there. The logical conclusion seemed to bethat he was, in fact, an inhabitant of Antarctica in the days when it was warmand habitable—and possibly had a navy capable of sailing round the world.Now this fitted in comfortably with a theory Hapgood had been developing sincethe early 1950s, and had put forward in a book called Earth’s Shifting Crust(1959), whose evidence so impressed Einstein that he wrote a preface to it. Thepurpose of the book had been to explain abrupt changes in the earth’sclimate—what one palaeontologist called ‘sudden and inexplicable climaticrevolutions’, often involving great extinctions of creatures like mammoths. TheBeresovka mammoth, found in Siberia in 1901, had frozen in an upright positionwith food in its mouth, and spring plants—including buttercups—in its stomach.Hapgood devotes a whole chapter to such ‘great extinctions’.Hapgood’s theory was that the crust of the earth is rather like the skin thatforms on cold gravy, and can be literally pulled around by great masses of iceat the poles. It was not until the 1960s that scientists became aware of theearth’s tectonic plates, and Hapgood took these into account in a later editionof his book called The Path of the Pole. His argument was still that ice couldcause the whole crust—tectonic plates and all—to move as one. He citesscientific evidence that Hudson Bay was once at the North Pole, and quotes astudy of magnetism in British rocks made in 1954 that shows that the BritishIsles were once more than two thousand miles further south. Soviet scientistshave stated that the North Pole was as far south as 55 degrees latitude sixtymillion years ago, and that it was in the Pacific, to the south-west of southernCalifornia, three hundred million years ago. Moreover, India and Africa wereonce covered with a sheet of ice, while—incomprehensibly—Siberia escaped. Is itnot possible, Hapgood suggested, that an Ice Age does not cover the whole earthsimultaneously, but only those parts that move into polar regions? He goes on toargue that, before the last ‘catastrophic event’ of 15,000 years ago, theAntarctic continent was 2,500 miles further north.So it did not surprise Hapgood to find in the Oronteus Finaeus map evidence thatthe South Pole was once free of ice, and probably contained cities and ports.A Turkish map of 1559, five years before the birth of Shakespeare, shows theworld from a northern ‘projection’, as if hovering over the North Pole. Again,the accuracy is incredible. But what may be its most interesting feature is thatAlaska and Siberia seem to be joined. Since this projection shows a heart-shapedglobe, with Alaska on one side of the ‘dimple’ and Siberia on the other, thiscould merely indicate that the mapmaker did not have space to show the BeringStrait which divides the continents. If this is not so, the consequences arestaggering; a land-bridge did exist in the remote past—but it may have been aslong as 12,000 years ago.Other early ‘portolans’ were equally remarkable for their accuracy—the DulcertPortolano of 1339 shows that the cartographer had precise knowledge of an areafrom Galway to the Don basin in Russia. Others showed the Aegean dotted withislands that do not now exist—presumably drowned by melting ice—an accuratelydrawn map of southern Great Britain, but without Scotland, and with indicationsof glaciers, and a Sweden still partially glaciated.A map of Antarctica published by the eighteenth-century French cartographerPhilippe Buache in 1737 shows it as divided into two islands, one large, onesmall, with a considerable area of water between them. The 1958 survey showedthat this is correct. On modern maps, Antarctica is shown as one solid mass.Even Oronteus Finaeus showed it as a solid mass. The implication is that Buacheused maps that were far older than those used by Oronteus Finaeus—possiblythousands of years older.Perhaps the most interesting piece of evidence uncovered by Hapgood is a map ofChina which he found in Needham’s Science and Civilisation in China, dating from1137, and carved on stone. Hapgood’s studies of Piri Re’is and other Europeanportolans had made him familiar with the ‘longitude error’ mentioned above; nowhe was astonished to find it on this map of China. If he was correct, then theChinese had also known the ‘original’ maps on which Piri Re’is was based.All this explains why Hapgood reached the startling conclusion that there was aflourishing worldwide maritime civilisation on earth before 4000 BC, and thatits centre was probably the Antarctic continent, then free of ice. He says inthe final chapter of Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings: ‘When I was a youth I had aplain simple faith in progress. It seemed to me impossible that once man hadpassed a milestone of progress in one way that he could ever pass the samemilestone again the other way. Once the telephone was invented, it would stayinvented. If past civilisations had faded away it was just because they had notlearned the secret of progress. But Science meant permanent progress, with nogoing back...’ And now the evidence of his ‘vanished civilisation’ seemed tocontradict that conclusion. He quotes the historian S. R. K. Glanville as saying(in The Legacy of Egypt): ‘It may be, as some indeed suspect, that the sciencewe see as the dawn of recorded history was not science at its dawn, butrepresents the remnants of the science of some great and as yet untracedcivilisation.’Hapgood, of course, does not mention Atlantis—it would have been more than hisacademic reputation was worth. Yet the story of Atlantis can hardly fail tooccur to the minds of his readers—after all, his great catastrophe of fifteenthousand years ago sounds as if it might have been the beginning of the disasterthat, according to Plato, engulfed the continent.The problem, as we have seen, is that Plato’s account of Atlantis is—to put itmildly—hard to accept. In the Timaeus he tells us that Atlanteans were warringaggressively against Europe in 9600 BC, and conquered Europe as far as Italy andNorth Africa as far as Libya. It was the Athenians who, according to Plato,fought on alone, and finally conquered the Atlanteans—after which both Atlantisand Athens were engulfed by floods. But since archaeological investigation showsno sign of occupation of the site of Athens before 3000 BC (when there seems tohave been a fairly sophisticated Neolithic settlement on the site of theAcropolis), this must be regarded as myth rather than history (although some ofthe surprises we have encountered in ancient Egyptian history suggest we shouldkeep an open mind).In his fragmentary dialogue Critias, of which only a few pages exist, Platotells us that the Atlanteans were great engineers and architects; their capitalcity was built on a hill, surrounded by concentric bands of land and water,joined by tunnels large enough for a ship to sail through. The city, elevenmiles in diameter, contained temples (to the sea god Poseidon—or Neptune) andpalaces, and there were extensive harbours and docks. A canal, a hundred yardswide and a hundred feet deep, connected the outermost ring of water to the sea.Behind the city was an oblong plain, three hundred by two hundred miles, onwhich farmers grew the city’s food supply; this was surrounded by mountains thatcame down to the sea, and which were full of villages, lakes and rivers. Platogoes into considerable detail about the architecture—even to the colour of thestones of the buildings—and the communal dining halls with hot and coldfountains make it sound like some Utopian fantasy of H. G. Wells.But as a result of interbreeding—presumably with immigrants—the Atlanteansgradually began to fall away from their god-like origins, and to behave badly.At this point Zeus decided they needed a lesson to ‘bring them back into tune’,and called a meeting of the gods... At which point, the fragment breaks off, andthe rest of the history of Atlantis—which once continued in a third dialogue—islost.The editors of the Bollingen edition of Plato explain that Plato was ‘restinghis mind ... making up a fairy tale, the most wonderful island that could beimagined.’ But if it was intended as a fable or fairy tale, the motive isobscure; it seems far more likely that it is an old story that was told to Platoby Socrates. And if it was fiction, why did Plato insert his first brief accountof Atlantis in the Timaeus, his account of the creation of the universe, whichBenjamin Jowett called ‘the greatest effort of the human mind to conceive theworld as a whole...’ if it was merely a fairy tale?In the second half of the nineteenth century, ships of the British, French,German and American navies began soundings of the floor of the Atlantic, anddiscovered the ‘Mid-Atlantic Ridge’, a mountain range running from Icelandalmost to the Antarctic Circle, which is at one point 600 miles wide. This hasproved to be an area of great volcanic activity. Understandably, the discoverycaused considerable excitement, and drew the attention of an Americancongressman named Ignatius Donnelly, whom L. Sprague de Camp has described as‘perhaps the most erudite man ever to sit in the House of Representatives’. Onlosing his seat in 1870, when he was 39, Donnelly retired to write Atlantis: TheAntediluvian World, based upon extensive studies in the Library of Congress; itappeared twelve years later, and became an instant bestseller. The success wasdeserved; the book shows considerable learning, and even today is as readable aswhen it was written. Donnelly shows a wide knowledge of mythology andanthropology, and quotes in Greek and Hebrew. He studies flood legends fromEgypt to Mexico, pointing out their similarities, and argues that ancient SouthAmerican civilisations like the Incas and the Maya bear interesting resemblanceto early European civilisations. His suggestion that the Azores may be themountain tops of the sunken continent so impressed the British Prime MinisterGladstone that he tried—unsuccessfully—to persuade the British Cabinet to allotfunds to send a ship to search for Atlantis.Like Schwaller de Lubicz, Donnelly was struck by how quickly Egyptiancivilisation seems to have attained a high degree of sophistication; likeSchwaller, he suggested that this was because its civilisation originated inAtlantis. In his book Lost Continents (1954), L. Sprague de Camp asserts that‘most of Donnelly’s statements of fact... either were wrong when he made them,or have been disproved by subsequent discoveries.’ Yet his list of Donnelly’smistakes—such as his views on Egyptian civilisation—only emphasises thatDonnelly had a remarkably acute nose for interesting evidence from the past.It was unfortunate for the budding science of ‘Atlantology’ that it ran into thesame problem that Hapgood would encounter when he published Maps of the AncientSea Kings and found himself classified with Erich von Daniken and otheradvocates of the ‘ancient astronaut’ theory. Five years before Donnelly’sAtlantis appeared, a Russian ‘occultist’ named Helena Blavatsky had published anenormous work of ancient mythology called Isis Unveiled, which became anunexpected bestseller; one of its fifteen hundred pages deals briefly withAtlantis, declaring that its inhabitants were ‘natural mediums’, whose childlikeinnocence had made them an easy prey for some malevolent entity who turned theminto a nation of black magicians; they started a war that led to the destructionof Atlantis.Madame Blavatsky died in London in 1891, having became the founder of theTheosophical Society; her final enormous work, The Secret Doctrine, claimed tobe a commentary on a religious work called The Book of Dzyan, written inAtlantis. According to Madame Blavatsky, the present human race is the fifthrace of intelligent beings on earth; its immediate predecessor, the fourth ‘rootrace’, was the Atlanteans.A leading Theosophist named W. Scott-Elliot followed this up with a work calledThe Story of Atlantis (1896), which achieved widespread popularity. Scott-Elliotclaimed that he gained his knowledge directly from his ability to read ‘theAkasic records’, the records of earth history that are imprinted on a kind of‘psychic ether’, and which are accessible to those possessing psychicsensitivity. He later went on to write a similar book about Lemuria, another‘lost continent’ that is supposed to have been located in the Pacific. (Donnellyhad pointed out there there is evidence that Australia is the only visible partof a continent that stretched from Africa to the Pacific, and the zoologist L.P. Sclater christened it Lemuria, noting that the existence of lemurs fromAfrica to Madagascar seemed to suggest a continuous land mass.)One of the most influential theosophists around the turn of the century was theAustrian Rudolf Steiner, and in 1904 he produced a work called From the AkasicRecords, which described the evolution of the human race. Like Madame Blavatsky,he taught that man began as a completely etherialised being, who has become moresolid with each step in his evolution. The Lemurians were the third ‘root race’,the Atlanteans the fourth. Like Plato, Steiner declares that the Atlanteansbecame increasingly corrupt and materialistic, and that their use of destructiveforces led to the catastrophe (which Steiner places around 8000 BC) that causedthe disappearance of Atlantis beneath the waves.The annexation of Atlantis by occultists caused the whole subject to fall intodisrepute. In the 1920s, a Scottish newspaper editor named Lewis Spence tried toreverse this trend by returning to Donnelly’s purely historical approach in TheProblem of Atlantis (1924). He argued for the existence of a great Atlanticcontinent in Miocene times (25 to 5 million years ago), which disintegrated intoislands, the two largest of which were close to the coast of Spain. Anotherisland called Antillia existed in the region of the West Indies. The easterncontinent began to disintegrate about 25,000 years ago and disappeared about10,000 years ago. Antillia survived until more recent times. Cro-Magnon man camefrom Atlantis, and wiped out the European stock of Neanderthal man about 25,000years ago. Later Atlanteans, known as Azilian man, founded the civilisations ofEgypt and Crete, while other Atlanteans fled westward and became the Mayans.Like so many Atlantis theorists, Spence became obsessed by his subject, andlater works like Will Europe Follow Atlantis? and The Occult Sciences inAtlantis show a decline in standards of intellectual rigour.In the late 1960s, a Greek archaeologist, Professor Angelos Galanopoulos,proposed the startling theory that Atlantis was the island of Santorini, northof Crete. This was blown apart around 1500 BC by a tremendous volcanicexplosion, which probably also destroyed most of the Greek islands and thecoastal plains of Greece and Crete. But how could the small island of Santorinihave been Plato’s enormous continent of Atlantis, with its 300-mile inlandplain? Galanopoulos suggests that the scribe simply multiplied the figures byten—and that this also applies to the date—Plato’s 9000 years earlier shouldactually be 900 (i.e. about 1300 BC). Surely, says Galanopoulos, a canal 300feet wide and 100 feet deep is absurd; 30 feet wide and 10 feet deep sounds morereasonable.The chief objection to this theory is that Plato states clearly that Atlantiswas beyond the Pillars of Hercules—Gibraltar. Galanopoulos argues that sinceHercules performed most of his labours in Greece, the Pillars of Hercules couldrefer to the two southernmost promontories of Greece. But Plato also says thatthe Atlanteans held sway over the country as far as Egypt and the Tyrrheniansea, and these are certainly not within the Greek promontories. In spite ofthese objections, the tourist board of Santorini has taken full advantage of thetheory to display notices declaring itself to be the original Atlantis.In 1968, it looked as if Edgar Cayce’s prophecy that Atlantis would rise againin 1968 and 1969 was about to be fulfilled. A fishing guide called Bonefish Samtook the archaeologist and underwater explorer Dr J. Manson Valentine to a placewhere there was a regular pattern of enormous underwater stones that lookedman-made. Valentine concluded that this was part of a ceremonial road leading toa sacred site, built by ‘the people who made the big spheres of Central America,the huge platforms of Baalbek in Lebanon, Malta in the Mediterranean, Stonehengein England, the walls of Ollantaytambo in Peru, the standing stone avenues ofBrittany, the colossal ruins of Tiahuanaco in Bolivia, and the statues of EasterIsland—this was a prehistoric race that could transport and position cyclopeanstones in a way that remains a mystery to us.’ When Valentine leaned of EdgarCayce’s prophecy that Atlantis would begin to reappear near Bimini, he wasstartled and impressed.For a while, the ‘Bimini road’ was the subject of much speculation, and anexpedition led by Dr David Zink spent months studying the stones. Yet the resultwas inconclusive. Although a grooved building block and a stylised head weighingover 200 pounds seemed to contradict the sceptics who declared that the blockswere natural formations, no positive evidence was ever discovered to link theroad with a vanished civilisation; the stones may be merely remains dating fromthe past thousand years.No wonder, then, that Hapgood had no intention of exposing himself to ridiculeby mentioning Atlantis. In later life, he showed remarkable courage inpublishing a book called Voices of Spirit, a series of interviews—or rather‘sittings’—with the trance medium Elwood Babbitt, in which Hapgood wasapparently able to hold conversations with—among others—Nostradamus, QueenElizabeth I, William Wordsworth, Abraham Lincoln, Gandhi, John F. Kennedy,Albert Einstein and Adlai Stevenson. But by then Hapgood was retired and didn’tcare what the academic world thought about him. The book is a vehicle forexpressing his conviction that the next step in man’s evolution will be in therealm of the psychic and paranormal.However, Hapgood’s notion that the earth’s crust might be capable of ‘slipping’came to intrigue a young Canadian named Randy Flemming, who lived in BritishColumbia. In the 1970s, waiting to hear whether he had secured a librarian’s jobat the University of Victoria, Flemming decided to distract himself by writing ascience fiction novel about Atlantis, set in 10,000 BC. He decided that thepresent site of Antarctica would make a good location for Atlantis.Having obtained the job, he came upon Hapgood’s Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings,and saw the ice-free map of Antarctica (p. 93), which immediately reminded himof the map of Atlantis drawn by the seventeenth-century Jesuit archaeologistAthanasius Kircher. Now he launched into serious research on Atlantis, with thehelp of the university library. A major step forward occurred when his wifeRose—also a librarian—gave him a National Atlas of Canada that revealed that thenorthern Yukon and some Arctic islands were free of ice during the last Ice Age.It was while puzzling on this curious anomaly that he heard of Hapgood’s theoryof the earth’s shifting crust. When he saw that Hapgood’s theory would place theAntarctic continent 2,500 miles closer to the equator around 15,000 BC, he leftthe library ‘jumping for joy’. Suddenly, it began to look as if his sciencefiction novel might be based on fact.Flemming began work on a paper for the Anthropological Journal of Canada on theproblem of why agriculture seems to have begun all over the world around 9000BC. His own suggestion was that Hapgood’s ‘Earth Crustal Displacement’ occurredsome time before 9000 BC, and made large areas of the globe uninhabitable,trapping people who would normally have been mobile in small areas. Since wildfood would soon become scarce under these conditions, they were forced to learnto grow their own food...He also wrote to Hapgood to discuss Earth’s Shifting Crusty and Hapgood, unawarethat the Flemmings already knew his Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, sent them acopy.Some time around now—1977—the Flemmings had the romantic idea of hyphenating acombination of their surnames—Flemming and De’Ath—to make Flem-Ath; RandyFlemming was later to admit ruefully that ‘it seems mainly to have resulted ingetting us lost in the file of every bureaucracy in Canada’.With considerable rashness, the Flem-Aths decided they had to move to London, sothat they could continue their researches in the British Museum. It was a highlyfruitful period, which ended with their return to Canada in the 1980s, andcontinuation of researches into ‘earth’s shifting crust’ which led to thewriting of When the Sky Fell (1995).I heard of the Flem-Aths from John West during a meeting in New York in 1994. Iwrote to them, and as a consequence, received a copy of the typescript of Whenthe Sky Fell.Their starting point was Plato—not just the accounts of Atlantis, but the remarkin Laws (Book 3) that world agriculture originated in highland regions aftersome great flood catastrophe that destroyed all lowland cities. Plato, ofcourse, had already given the date of the destruction of Atlantis as 9600 BC.The Flem-Aths note that the Soviet botanist Nikolai Ivanovitch Vavilov collectedover fifty thousand wild plants from around the globe, and concluded that theycame from eight centres of origin, all in mountain ranges. They also note thatthe modern scientific account of the origin of agriculture dates it roughly fromthis period. One of the major sites of origin was Lake Titicaca in Peru, thehighest freshwater lake in the world. (We shall have more to say of LakeTiticaca in the next chapter.) Oddly enough, another mountain area known as asite where agriculture originated at about the same time lies in the highlandsof Thailand, exactly on the opposite side of the earth from Lake Titicaca.Hapgood’s theory had, in fact, pinpointed these two places as areas of stabilityafter the great upheaval that he posited.'After hundreds of thousands of years of living by hunting and gathering,humankind turned to experimenting with agriculture on opposite sides of theearth at the same time. Is this likely without the intervention of some outsideforce?’Egypt had been tropical before the crust displacement; now it became temperate.So, according to Hapgood, did Crete, Sumeria, India and China. All became placeswhere civilisation flourished.In the pages that follow, the Flem-Aths discuss the catastrophe myths of manytribes of American Indians—the Utes, the Kutenai, the Okanagan, the A’a’tam, theCahto, the Cherokee, and the Araucanians of Peru. All have legends of violentearthquakes followed by floods which caused widespread disaster. The Utes tell astory of how the hare god fired a magic arrow at the sun, causing it to shatterinto pieces and earthquakes and floods to engulf the earth. Many similar legendssuggest that some great catastrophe was preceded by some change in the face ofthe sun that made it look as if it was shattered; a Spanish chronicler remarkson the terror of the Incas at an eclipse of the sun—while another comments thatthe Araucanians rush to the highlands whenever there is an earth tremor.There are also many legends of survival that bear a family resemblance to Noah’sArk. The Haida of north-west Canada have a flood myth which is virtuallyidentical with the flood myth of Sumeria in the Middle East.From all corners of the earth the same story is told. The sun deviates from itsregular path. The sky falls. The earth is wrenched and torn by earthquakes. Andfinally a great wave of water engulfs the globe. Survivors of such a calamitywould go to any lengths to prevent it from happening again. They lived in an ageof magic. It was natural and necessary to construct elaborate devices to pacifythe sun-god (or goddess) and control, or monitor its path.Hence, according to the Flem-Aths, the many strange magical customs connectedwith the sun which anthropologists have observed all over the world.The Flem-Aths go on to review the evidence that many areas of the earth werebelieved to be buried deep under ice during the last Ice Age. Wolf bones foundin Norway north of the Arctic Circle revealed that this area must have had atemperate climate 42 thousand years ago, when it was supposed to be in the gripof an Ice Age. ‘Of the thirty-four species known to have lived in Siberia before9600 BC, including mammoths, giant deer, cave hyena and cave lions, twenty-eightwere adapted to temperate conditions’, indicating that Siberia’s climate wasthen much warmer than today. At this time, two vast ice sheets lay acrossCanada. Yet the evidence shows that there was an ice-free corridor between them.Why? Hapgood’s answer is that, at this time, the Gulf of Mexico was in the eastand the Yukon in the west, so the sun melted the snow along this corridor asfast as it fell.The Flem-Aths cite evidence that an earth crust displacement around 91,600 BCmoved Europe within the Arctic Circle, while another around 50,600 BC movedNorth America into the polar zone.All this evidence, the Flem-Aths submit, points to the present Antarctica as thesite of the legendary Atlantis. (They also cite Hapgood’s map evidence toreinforce the point.) Some shift in the earth’s crust, beginning about 15,000BC, ended in violent upheaval in 9600 BC, the time when, according to Plato,Atlantis and Athens suffered catastrophic upheavals.And how did the seventeenth-century Jesuit Athanasius Kircher come upon the mapof Atlantis that first struck Randy Flemming as being so similar to Antarctica?In the first volume of his encyclopaedic work Mundus Subterraneus, published in1665, Kircher claimed that the map he had discovered in his researches wasstolen from Egypt by the Roman invaders. The original of the map has not beendiscovered, but it seems unlikely that a Jesuit scholar would have concocted it,particularly in a scientific work. As the Flem-Aths point out, both the shapeand the size of the map correspond remarkably to Antarctica as we now know itfrom seismic soundings—or even to Antarctica as it is now shown on most globes.For Graham Hancock, the Antarctica theory of the Flem-Aths came as a kind ofdeliverance. A few months into work on his book about the problem of a lostcivilisation, he received a letter of resignation from his researcher. Itexplained that, as far as he could see, the search was quite pointless, sincesuch a civilisation would have to be enormous—at least two thousand milesacross, with rivers and mountains, and a considerable history of long-termdevelopment. There was no known land mass in the world that could haveaccommodated such a civilisation. As to the notion that it could lie at thebottom of the Atlantic, the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, now so thoroughlymapped, showed no sign of a lost continent. The same was true of the floor ofthe Pacific and the Indian Oceans. So in spite of all the evidence for someearlier civilisation—such as that contained in Hapgood’s maps—it looked as ifthere was nowhere its remains might be lurking.In fact, the answer was in Hapgood, and in the belief that he states in Maps ofthe Ancient Sea Kings—that the maps of Antarctica show that someone living inthe continent, at a time when it was free of ice, must have been responsible formapping it.Yet I can hardly blame Graham Hancock for failing to draw the obviousconclusion. I was also thoroughly familiar with Hapgood’s book, and haddiscussed it at length in an ‘encyclopaedia’ of unsolved mysteries, and I hadalso failed to see what was staring me in the face. It took Randy Flemming’schance decision to write a science fiction novel in which—purely as a fictionalhypothesis—he assumed that Antarctica was Atlantis, to start the chain ofreasoning that led him to the ‘Eureka’ experience.As to why Hapgood himself failed to label his ‘lost civilisation’ Atlantis, theanswer is that—quite apart from his wish not to expose himself to the ridiculeof academic colleagues—he felt that it hardly mattered what the lostcivilisation was called; he told the Flemmings in a letter of August 1977: ‘Itmay well be that after examining this book (Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings) youmay decide to reduce somewhat your emphasis on Atlantis, that is on the myths,for the book contains enough hard evidence to stand on its own.’ Which is, ofcourse, true. But then, Hapgood had not studied the rich evidence of catastrophemyths all over the world, or the physical evidence of sites like Tiahuanaco. Ifhe had, he might have decided that it was worth a little academic ridicule to beable to claim precedence in associating his ancient maps with the forbiddenword..."},{"pageContent":"5 THE REALM OF THE WHITE GODSIn March 1519, the conquistador Hernando Cortés landed in Mexico with 508soldiers. The Aztecs, under their king Montezuma, had tens of thousands ofwarriors. Yet in just over two years the Spaniards had defeated them anddestroyed the Aztec empire. The Indians were enslaved, Christian churches werebuilt on the site of Aztec temples, the name of the capital was changed fromTenochtitlan to Mexico City, and that of the country to New Spain.Why did the Spanish succeed with such relative ease? Because the Aztecs mistookthem for descendants of the god Quetzalcoatl, a cross between a snake and a birdknown as ‘the plumed serpent’. (Elsewhere in South America he is known asViracocha, Votan, Kukulkan and Kon-Tiki.) The legend states that Quetzalcoatl, atall, bearded, white man, came from somewhere in the south, soon after somecatastrophe that had obscured the sun for a long time; Quetzalcoatl brought backthe sun, and he also brought the arts of civilisation. (We are naturallyinclined to wonder: was the arrival of Quetzalcoatl connected with the obscuringof the sun? Could he have been fleeing from the catastrophe that caused it?)After an attempt to kill him by treachery, the ‘god’ returned to the sea,promising one day to return. By coincidence, Cortés had landed close to the spotwhere Quetzalcoatl was expected, which is why the superstitious Montezumaallowed Cortés to take him prisoner.One reason why the Spaniards felt no compunction at slaughtering the Aztecs wasthat they were appalled at their tradition of human sacrifice. The Aztec priestwould carefully slice an incision in the ribs with a flint knife, while severalmen held the victim down on the altar by his (or her) arms and legs, and thenplunged in his hand and tore out the beating heart. When—as in many cases—thevictim was a baby, it was unnecessary to hold it down. Such victims were oftendespatched by the dozen, and even—when prisoners were taken—by the hundreds orthousands. The Spaniards saw this, rightly, as a custom of appalling barbarity.What they did not know is that it dated back thousands of years, and that it wasdesigned to prevent the gods from bringing about the end of the world in someviolent catastrophe, as they had done in the remote past.In 1697, when an Italian traveller named Giovanni Careri visited Mexico, hefound a country exploited by greedy Spanish merchants and fanatical and ignorantpriests who were busily destroying signs of the old civilisation. ‘We found agreat number of books,’ says one chronicler, ‘but as they contained nothing butsuperstitions and falsehoods of the Devil, we burned them.’ But in Mexico CityCareri met a priest who was an exception: Don Carlos de Siguenza, scientist andhistorian, who could speak the language of the Indians and read theirhieroglyphs. From ancient manuscripts, Siguenza had concluded that the Aztecshad founded the city of Tenochtitlan—and the Aztec empire—in 1325. Before themthere was a race called the Toltecs, and before them, the Olmecs, who lived inthe tropical lowlands, and who, according to legend, had come over the sea fromthe east—Siguenza believed from Atlantis.From Siguenza, Careri learned that the Indian civilisation also had its greatpyramids, including one at Cholula that was three times as massive as the GreatPyramid at Giza (which Careri had visited on his way to South America). OnSiguenza’s recommendation, Careri went to the town of San Juan Teotihuacan, andwas impressed by the magnificent Pyramid of the Moon and the Pyramid of the Sun,even though both were partly buried in earth. What puzzled him was how theIndians had succeeded in transporting enormous blocks from distant quarries; noone was able to tell him. Neither could anyone suggest how the Aztecs had carvedgreat stone idols without metal chisels, or how they had raised them to thesummit of pyramids.When, in 1719, Careri published the story of his round-the-world voyage in ninevolumes, he was greeted with incredulity and hostility; his critics spread thestory that he had never left Naples. One of the main reasons for this hostilitywas Careri’s descriptions of the civilisation of the Aztecs; Europeans simplyrefused to believe that savages could have created a culture that ranked withthose of ancient Egypt and Greece.Many distinguished travellers visited Mexico and described its ruins—includingthe great Alexander von Humboldt—but somehow their descriptions failed to makean impact outside academic circles. It would not be until the mid-nineteenthcentury that a wider audience would become aware of the legacy of South America.In 1841, a three-volume work called Incidents of Travel in Central Americabecame an unexpected bestseller, and brought its author—a young New York lawyernamed John Lloyd Stephens—overnight celebrity in Europe as well as America.Stephens had already explored the archaeology of the Old World, in Egypt, Greeceand Turkey. And when he came across a report by a Mexican colonel of hugepyramids buried in the jungles of Yucatan—on the Gulf of Mexico—he succeeded inusing his political connections to get himself appointed to the post of chargéd’affaires in Central America. He took with him an artist named FrederickCatherwood.Landing at Belize, Stephens and Catherwood made their way inland along theHonduras-Guatemala border. It proved to be more dangerous and uncomfortable thantravelling in the Middle East. The country was in the grip of a civil war, andthey spent one night under arrest while drunken soldiers fired off rifles intothe air. After that they plunged into deep forest where the trees met overhead,and the stifling air was full of mosquitoes. They breathed in the stench ofvegetable decay, and the horses often sank up to their bellies in the swamp.Stephens had almost lost faith when one day they came upon a wall of stoneblocks, with a flight of steps leading up to a terrace. Their Indian guideattacked the lianas with his machete, and tore them away to reveal a kind ofstatue like an immense totem pole, standing more than twice the height of a man.A blank face with closed eyes looked down on them; the decorations were so richand finely carved that it might have been some statue of the Buddha from India.There could be no doubt whatsoever that this was the product of a highlysophisticated civilisation. Within the next few days, Stephens realised that hewas on the edge of a magnificent city, almost totally buried in the jungle. Itwas called Copan, and it contained the remains of huge step pyramids—not unlikethe one at Saqqara—that were part of a temple complex.The owner of the site, an Indian called Don José Maria, at first showed signs ofirritation at the intruding foreigners, but quickly became amenable when theyoffered to buy the jungle city for a vast sum that exceeded all hisexpectations. In fact, their offer—$50—convinced him that they were fools, buthe accepted without revealing his bafflement that they should want to purchasesuch a worthless piece of property. Stephens threw a party and offeredeveryone—including the women—cigars.Stephens’s Travels in Central America was the first that the civilised world hadheard of an ancient people called the Maya, who preceded (and overlapped with)the Toltecs, and who had built Copan around AD 500; their cities had once spreadfrom Chichen Itzá—in Yucatan—to Copan, from Tikal in Guatemala to Palanque inChiapas. Their temples were as magnificent as those of Babylon, their cities assophisticated as eighteenth-century Paris or Vienna, their calendar as complexand precise as that of ancient Egypt.Yet the Mayas also represented a great mystery. There is evidence that, aroundAD 600, they decided to abandon their cities; their method, apparently, was tomove to a new location in the jungle, where they would build another city. Thefirst attempt at an explanation was that they were driven out by enemies. But asknowledge of their society increased, it became clear that they had no enemies;in their own territory they were supreme. Some natural catastrophe—likeearthquake or floods—also had to be ruled out, since there was no sign of anykind of destruction. And if the explanation was some kind of plague, thegraveyards would have been full, and this was not true either.The likeliest theory is the one put forward by the American archaeologistSylvanus Griswold Morley, who believed that Maya origins went back as far as2500 BC. Morley noted that the Mayan cities suggested a rigid hierarchicalstructure, with the temples and the palaces of the nobility in the centre, andthe huts of the peasants scattered around the edges. The Mayas had no ‘middleclass’, only peasants and aristocrats—the latter including the priests. The taskof the peasants was to support the upper classes with their labour—particularlythe growing of maize. But their agricultural methods were primitive—droppingseed into a hole made with a stick. They seemed to know nothing about allowingcertain fields to ‘rest’ and grow fallow. So the soil surrounding the citiesgradually became infertile, requiring a move to another site. Moreover, becausethe social structure was so rigid, the ruling class received no new blood. So asthe farming land lost its strength, and the peasant population increased, andthe rulers became increasingly decadent, the society went into a slowcollapse—and a once-great people drifted into primitivism, confirming Hapgood’ssuspicion that history can go backwards.Stephens’s book inspired a French abbé named Charles Étienne Brasseur deBourbourg to follow in his footsteps across Mexico. In Guatemala he found thesacred book of the Quiché Indians, the Popol Vuh, which he translated intoFrench and published in 1864. In the same year he brought out a translation ofthe Account of Yucatan by Bishop Diego de Landa, a work of immense value by oneof the original Spanish ‘conquistadors’, which had been languishing in theMadrid archives. His four-volume History of the Civilisation of Mexico andCentral America was immediately recognised as the most important work so far onthe subject. But one of his most interesting discoveries was a Mayan religiousbook known as the Troano Codex (which later, when a second part was found,became the Codex Tro-Cortesianus), owned by a descendant of Cortés, for it wasin this book that Brasseur found mentions of some great catastrophe that hadconvulsed Central America in the remote past—Brasseur declared that the yearcould be identified as 9937 BC—and destroyed much of its civilisation. Brasseurhad met natives who still had an oral tradition about the destruction of a greatcontinent in the Atlantic ocean, and had no doubt, like the Codex, they werereferring to the destruction of Atlantis. He went on to speculate that it wasfrom Atlantis that the civilisations of Egypt and of South America originated.This seemed to be confirmed by an account of a great cataclysm described in thewritings of the Nahuatl tribe, whose language Brasseur had learned directly froma descendant of Montezuma. He suggested that Quetzalcoatl, the white god whocame from the sea, was an inhabitant of the lost Atlantis.In the College of San Gregorio, in Mexico City, Brasseur discovered a manuscriptin Nahuatl (which he called the Chimalpopoca Codex), in which he learned thatthe immense upheaval had occurred around 10,500 BC, but that it was not onecatastrophe, as described by Plato, but a series of at least four, each of whichwas caused by a temporary shifting of the earth’s axis.Such unscholarly notions could hardly be excused, even in one whose knowledge ofthe culture of Central America was greater than that of most of the professors,and in his later years Brasseur came in for more than his share of derision. Yetmany of his theories would later be supported by Hapgood’s ‘maps of the ancientsea kings’ (while Graham Hancock cites Nature to the effect that the lastreversal of the earth’s magnetic poles occurred 12,400 years ago—in other words,about 10,400 BC). Brasseur believed that there was an ancient seafaringcivilisation long before the first cities appeared in the Middle East, and thatits sailors carried its culture throughout the world. He also believed thattheir religion involved a cult of the dog star Sirius—thus anticipating thediscoveries made by Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen among the Dogon in the1930s.Between 1864 and 1867, the history of Mexico took a turn in the direction ofcomic opera when the French government, under Napoleon III, sent a militaryexpedition led by Archduke Maximilian of Hapsburg, brother of Emperor FranzJoseph, to bring an end to the civil war by claiming the throne. A gentleliberal, Maximilian encouraged the arts, subsidised investigation of thepyramids of Teotihuacan, and did his best to cope with the total corruption thatwas part of the Mexican way of life. Betrayed by Napoleon III, who decided towithdraw his army, Maximilian was captured by the rebel General Porfirio Diazand shot by a firing squad. His empress Carlota went insane and remained so forthe remainder of her long life (she died in 1927). But Maximilian left a richlegacy for historians when he purchased from a collector named José MariaAndrade a library of five thousand books on Mayan culture, which were sent toEurope.Among Europeans to flee Mexico when Maximilian was executed was a youngFrenchman named Desiré Charnay, who had been the first to photograph the ruinswith a camera obscura. It was while his assistants were setting up the camerathat Charnay prodded idly in the soil with his dagger, and unearthed pottery andbones, a find that was to inspire a lifelong passion for excavation. He wouldreturn to Mexico in 1880, searching for Tollan, the legendary capital of theToltecs. Convinced that it lay beneath the Indian village of Tula, fifty milesnorth of Mexico City, Charnay began to dig there, and soon came uponsix-foot-long blocks of basalt, which he took to be the feet of huge statuesintended to support a large building. He called these statues ‘Atlanteans’—fromwhich it may be deduced that, like so many Central American archaeologists, hehad come to believe that the civilisations of South America originated inAtlantis. This was enough to make the academic world regard him with deepsuspicion.Charnay went on to study the ruins of another Maya city, Palenque in Chiapas,discovered in 1773 by Friar Ramón de Ordonez, who had then gone on to write abook in which he declared that the ‘Great City of the Serpents’ had been foundedby a white man called Votan who had come from somewhere over the Atlantic in theremote past. Ordonez claimed to have seen a book written (in Quiché) byVotan—and burned by the Bishop of Chiapas in 1691—in which Votan identifiedhimself as a citizen of ‘Valim Chivim’, which Ordonez believed to be Tripoli inancient Phoenicia.In the steaming heat of the ‘City of the Serpents’, Charnay had to contenthimself with taking papier-maché casts of the friezes, which were already beingdestroyed by the vegetation. In the Yucatan city of Chichen Itzá, built by theMayas as they abandoned cities they had built in Guatemala—and here Charnay wasconfirmed in his belief that Mayan civilisation had the same roots as that ofEgypt, India and even China and Thailand—the step pyramids reminded him ofAngkor Wat. But Charnay was inclined to believe that the Toltecs originated inAsia. Later, in one of the least-explored of Mayan ruins at Yaxchilan (whichCharnay renamed after his patron Lorillard), he was deeply impressed by a reliefshowing a man kneeling before a god, and apparently passing a long rope througha hole in his tongue—reminding Charnay that the worshippers of the Hindu goddessShiva also pay homage by drawing a rope through their pierced tongues.Back in France, Charnay published a book called Anciennes Villes du NouveauMonde, but it failed to improve his reputation among academics, and he retiredto Algiers to write novels, dying in 1915 at the age of 87.Charnay’s contemporary Augustus Le Plongeon was even less concerned about hisacademic reputation, with the result that his name is seldom found in books onCentral America (although one modern authority pauses long enough to describehim as an ‘argumentative crackpot’). By the time he was in his mid-forties, LePlongeon had been a gold prospector in California, a lawyer in San Francisco andthe director of a hospital in Peru, where he became interested in ancient ruins.He was 48 when he sailed, with his young English wife Alice, from New York forYucatan in 1873.By this time, Mexico was firmly in the grip of Porfirio Diaz, who had encouragedthe corruption that so dismayed his predecessor Maximilian; in fact, Mexico hadreverted to the days of the Mayas, with an all-powerful ruling class and abrowbeaten class of peasants, whose land was confiscated and given to the rich.The result was that the Indians in remoter parts—like Yucatan—frequentlyrebelled, and when the Le Plongeons first went to Chichen Itzá, they had to beprotected by soldiers. But Le Plongeon learned the Mayan language, and soonbegan exploring the forest alone. He found the Indians to be friendly andpolite, and he was soon known as the Great Black Beard.From oyster shells in the region of Lake Titicaca, on the border of Bolivia andPeru, Le Plongeon had concluded that at some point in the remote past, the lakemust once have been at sea level, and that therefore some great upheaval musthave raised it two and a half miles to its present location. Now, among theIndians of Yucatan, he again heard tales of this great catastrophe.He learned from these forest Indians that they still preserved an occulttradition. Peter Tompkins states (in Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids):Like Carlos Castaneda in our day, Le Plongeon learned that the native Indians inhis day still practised magic and divination, that their wise men were able tosurround themselves with clouds and even appear to make themselves invisible,materialising strange and amazing objects. Sometimes, says Le Plongeon, theplace where they were operating would seem to shake as if an earthquake wereoccurring, or whirl around and around as if being carried off by a tornado...Beneath the prosaic life of the Indians... Le Plongeon concluded that thereflowed a rich living current of occult wisdom and practice, with its sources inan extremely ancient past, far beyond the purview of ordinary historicalresearch.Le Plongeon felt that occasionally the mask was lowered sufficiently for him toglimpse ‘a world of spiritual reality, sometimes of indescribable beauty, againof inexpressible horror’.Le Plongeon learned to decipher Mayan hieroglyphs from a 150-year-old Indian.Scholars were to cast doubt on Le Plongeon’s readings of these glyphs, yet hisability is attested by his discovery of a statue buried 24 feet under the earthof Chichen Itzá, whose location he found described in a Mayan inscription on awall. The inscription referred to the buried object as a chacmool (meaning‘jaguar paw’); it proved to be the huge figure of a man reclining on his elbows,his head turned at 90 degrees. With the aid of his team of diggers, Le Plongeonraised it to the surface. But his hopes of sending it for exhibition inPhiladelphia were frustrated by the Mexican authorities, who seized it before ithad got beyond the local capital. Chacmools are now recognised as ritualfigures—probably representing fallen warriors who act as messengers to thegods—and the receptacle often found on the chest is intended for the heart of asacrificial victim.The result of Le Plongeon’s studies of ancient Mayan texts were convictions thatin many ways echoed those of Brasseur and Charnay, but went even further.Charnay had been inclined to believe that civilisation had reached South Americafrom Asia or Europe, Brasseur that it originated in Atlantis. Le Plongeonthought that it had begun in South America and moved east. He cited theRamayana, the Hindu epic written by the poet Valmiki in the third century BC,declaring that India had been peopled by seagoing conquerors in remoteantiquity. Valmiki called these conquerors the Nagas, and Le Plongeon pointedout the similarity to the word Naacal, Mayan priests or ‘adepts’ who, accordingto Mayan mythology, travelled the world as teachers of wisdom. Like Brasseur, LePlongeon cited the Mesopotamian myth that civilisation was brought to the worldby creatures from the sea called ‘oannes’, and pointed out that the Mayan wordoaana means ‘he who lives in water’. In fact, Le Plongeon spent a great deal ofspace on the similarities between Mayan and the ancient languages of the MiddleEast. (In both Akkadian and Mayan, kul is the word for the behind, and kun forthe female genitalia, suggesting a common origin for words we still use.)But Le Plongeon’s most controversial contribution was his translations from theTroano Codex, first studied by Brasseur. Like Brasseur, he agreed that thiscontained references to the catastrophe that destroyed Atlantis—although, as faras Le Plongeon could determine, the Mayas had apparently referred to Atlantis asMu. The text spoke of terrible earthquakes that continued for thirteen chuen('days’?), causing the land to rise and sink several times before it was tornasunder. The date given by the codex—'the year six Kan, and the eleventhMulac’—means (according to both Brasseur and Le Plongeon) 9500 BC. Le Plongeonlater claimed that he had discovered in the ruins of Kabah, south of Uxmal, amural that confirmed this date, and at Xochicalco yet another inscription aboutthe cataclysm.Le Plongeon’s reputation for romantic flights of fancy seemed to be confirmed byhis book Queen Moo and the Egyptian Sphinx (1896) in which he argued that theMayas’ legendary Queen Moo and Prince Aac are the origin of the Egyptian Isisand Osiris, and that the evidence of the Troana Codex indicates that Queen Moooriginated in Egypt and later returned there. He also speculates that the factthat Atlantis sank in the thirteenth chuen may be the origin of the modernsuperstition about the number thirteen; he suggests, more plausibly, that thismay explain why the Mayan calendar is based on the number thirteen.Such speculations obscured some of Le Plongeon’s more important observations,such as that the relation of the height to the base of Mayan pyramidsrepresented the earth—as in the case of the Great Pyramid of Giza. He alsoargued that the Mayan unit of measurement was one forty-millionth of the earth’scircumference—a suggestion that might be regarded as absurd if it were not forthe fact that the Egyptians also seemed to be aware of the length of theequator.The Le Plongeons spent twelve years in Central America, returning to New York in1885. He was hoping for a triumphant homecoming; in fact, the remaining 23 yearsof his life were to be a continuous disappointment. To the academicestablishment he was a crank who believed in magic and in a chronology thatstruck them as absurd (for everyone knew that the very first towns were builtaround 4000 BC—it would be another seventy years before that estimate was pushedback to 8000 BC, and even that was fifteen hundred years later than LePlongeon’s dating of Atlantis). Museums were not interested in Mayan artefacts,or even Mayan manuscripts; the Metropolitan Museum accepted Le Plongeon’s castsof Mayan friezes but relegated them to the storage basement. So Le Plongeonlived on to 1908, and died at the age of 82, still regarded as an argumentativecrackpot.One of the few friends he made in these last years was a young Englishman namedJames Churchward, who had been (according to his own account) a Bengal Lancer inIndia. (Peter Tompkins states that he was a civil servant with connections withBritish Intelligence.) According to Churchward, writing more than forty yearslater, he had already stumbled on the trail of ancient Mayan (‘Naacal’)inscriptions in India, when a Brahmin priest had showed him—and allowed him tocopy—tablets covered with Mayan inscriptions. These, according to the priest,were accounts of the lost continent called Mu, which was not situated in theAtlantic, as Le Plongeon had assumed, but in the Pacific, just as the zoologistP. L. Sclater had suggested in the 1850s when he noticed the similarity betweenflora and fauna of so many lands between India and Australia. But Churchward’sLost Continent of Mu would not be published until 1926, and then it would bedismissed by historians as a kind of hoax. After all, Sclater had christened hislost continent Lemuria, and it was after this that Le Plongeon had discovered‘Mu’ in the Troano Codex.Churchward seems to have been inspired to write his Mu books (five in all) bycontact with a friend named William Niven, to whom he dedicated the first ofthem. Niven was, like Le Plongeon, a maverick archaeologist—a Scots miningengineer who worked in Mexico as early as 1889. At Guerrero, near Acapulco, heexplored a region that contained hundreds of pits, from which the buildingmaterial of Mexico City had been mined. Digging in these pits, Niven claimed tohave come across ancient ruins, some of which were full of volcanic ash,suggesting that, like Pompeii, they had been suddenly overwhelmed. From theirdepth—some were 30 feet below the surface—Niven estimated that some of themdated from 50,000 years ago. One goldsmith’s shop contained around 200 clayfigures that had been baked into stone. He also found murals that rivalled thoseof Greece or the Middle East.In 1921, in a village called Santiago Ahuizoctla, he found hundreds of stonetablets engraved with curious symbols and figures, not unlike those of the Maya,although Maya scholars failed to recognise them. Niven showed some of thesetablets to Churchward, who said they confirmed what he had learned from theHindu priest. These tablets, said Churchward, had been inscribed by Naacalpriests who had been sent out from Mu to Central America, to disseminate theirsecret knowledge. Churchward was to claim that these tablets revealed that thecivilisation of Mu was 200,000 years old.Understandably, then, Churchward’s Mu books have been dismissed as a fraud. Itmust be confessed that this was largely his own fault; he is so vague about thetemple where he claims to have seen the Naacal tablets, and offers so littleproof of his various assertions, that it is hard to take him seriously. On theother hand, if Brasseur, Le Plongeon and Niven can be taken seriously when theyspeak of Mayan inscriptions referring to 9500 BC, then it is possible that wemay eventually discover that Churchward was more truthful than we suspect.Le Plongeon was a severe disappointment to the American Antiquarian Society,which for a time published his reports from Mexico in its journal. But hisspeculations about Atlantis, and his habit of sniping at the Church for itsunsavoury record of torture and bloodshed, became finally too much for the NewEnglanders, and they dropped him.Amusingly enough, the young man they chose to be their representative in Mexicohad started his career by publishing an article in Popular Science Monthlycalled ‘Atlantis Not a Myth’, which argued that although there is no scientificevidence for Atlantis, a tradition so widespread must surely have some basis infact, and that this lost civilisation seems to have made its mark on the land ofthe Mayas. He then went on to cite the legend of light-skinned, blue-eyedpeople, with serpent emblems on their heads, who had come from the east inremote antiquity. His article came out in 1879, three years before Donnelly’sbook on Atlantis. He pointed out that the leaders of the Olmecs were known asChanes, Serpent Wise Men, and among the Mayas as Canob, People of theRattlesnake.Edward Herbert Thompson’s article attracted some scholarly attention, as aresult of which he found himself, in his mid-twenties, in Mexico as Americanconsul. It was 1885, the year Le Plongeon left.As a student, Thompson had read a book by Diego de Landa, the Spanish bishop whobegan his career by destroying thousands of Mayan books and artefacts, and endedby carefully collecting and preserving the remains of Mayan culture. Landa haddescribed a sacred well at Chichen Itzá, where sacrificial victims were hurledduring times of drought or pestilence. The story fascinated him, just as, fourdecades earlier, a picture book showing the vast walls of Troy had fascinated aseven-year-old named Heinrich Schliemann, who thereupon decided that he wouldone day discover Troy. Forty-four years later, in 1873, he did precisely that.Diego de Landa’s descriptions of the sacrificial ceremonies would have beenregarded by most scholars in the 1880s as fiction; like Schliemann, Thompson wasdetermined to establish how much truth lay behind it.Another account, by Don Diego de Figueroa, described how women were hurled intothe well at dawn, with instructions to ask the gods who dwelt in its depthsquestions about when their master was to undertake important projects. Themasters themselves fasted for 60 days before the ceremony. At midday, the womenwho had not drowned were heaved out by means of ropes, and were dried out infront of fires in which incense was burned. They would then describe how theyhad seen many people at the bottom of the well—people of their own race—and howthey were not allowed to look at them direct in the face—they were given blowson the head if they tried. But the well-people answered their questions and toldthem when their masters’ projects should be undertaken...Thompson lost no time in visiting Chichen Itzá to look at the sinister well; hefound it as morbidly fascinating as he had expected. The sacrificial well, orcenote, was an oval water hole, 165 by 200 feet, surrounded by verticallimestone cliffs that soared 70 feet above the surface. It certainly looked grimenough. The water was green and slimy, almost black, and no one was sure of itsdepth, for there was undoubtedly a thick layer of mud at its bottom.Finally, more than a decade after his first visit, Thompson succeeded inpurchasing Chichen Itzá as Stephens had purchased Copan. Now, in effect, heowned the well. But how could he explore it?He decided on an extremely dangerous expedient: to go down in a diving suit.Realising that everyone would try to talk him out of it, he started by going toBoston and taking lessons in deep-sea diving. Then he was ready to approach theAmerican Antiquarian Society, and his patron Stephen Salisbury. As he expected,Salisbury reacted with horror, and told Thompson he would be committing suicide.But Thompson persisted, and finally raised the funds he needed.Next he dangled a plumb line into the well until it seemed to touch bottom; fromthis he determined that the water was about 35 feet deep. But how to know whereto look for human skeletons in about 3000 square feet of water? He solved thisby throwing logs weighing as much as a human body from the top, and noting thespot where they fell.Next, he positioned a dredge, with a long steel cable, at the edge of the cliff,and watched the gaping steel jaws plunge under the dark surface. The men at thewinch lowered the dredge into the dark water and turned the handle until thecable became slack. Then they closed the steel jaws, and heaved the dredge backup. As it came out above the surface, the water boiled, and great bubbles of gassurged up. On a wooden platform, the jaws deposited a load of black leafmouldand dead branches. Then it plunged back again into the water.For days this continued, and the pile of black sludge grew larger—one day iteven brought up a complete tree, ‘as sound as if toppled into the pit by a stormof yesterday’. But Thompson began to worry. Supposing this was all he was goingto find? Suppose Landa had been allowing his imagination to run wild? He wouldbe subjected to merciless ridicule. Even fragments of pottery did nothing toraise his spirits. After all, boys might have used flat bits of broken pots toskim across the surface of the well.Then, one early morning, he staggered down to the cenote, his eyes heavy withlack of sleep, and looked down into the ‘bucket’ formed by the closed jaws as itrose out of the water. In it he noticed two large blobs of some yellowsubstance, not unlike butter. They reminded him of the balls of ‘bog butter’found by archaeologists in ancient settlements in Switzerland and Austria. Butthe ancient Maya had no cows or goats—or any other domestic animals—so thiscould not be butter. He sniffed it, then tasted it. It was resin. And suddenly,Thompson’s heart became light. He threw some of the resin on to a fire, and theair was permeated by a fragrant smell. It was some kind of sacred incense, andit meant that the well had been used for religious purposes.From then on, the well began to yield up its treasures—pottery, sacred vessels,axe and arrow heads, copper chisels and discs of beaten copper, Maya deities,bells, beads, pendants and pieces of jade.Thompson had moored a large, flat boat below the overhang of the cliff,alongside a narrow ‘beach’ with lizards and giant toads. One day he was sittingin the boat, working at his notes, when he paused to stare meditatively downinto the water. What he saw startled him. He seemed to be looking down avertical wall with ‘many deeps and hollows’, as described by the women who hadbeen hauled up. It was, he quickly realised, the reflection of the cliff abovehim. And the workmen looking over the cliff were also reflected in the water,giving the impression that people were walking about below.He had also read that the water in the cenote sometimes turned green, andsometimes became clotted blood. Observation over a period revealed that thesecomments were also based on fact. Algae sometimes turned the water bright green,and red seed capsules made it look like blood.Finally, it was obvious that the dredge had reached the bottom of the mud andslime—about 40 feet below the original ‘bottom’—and that no more artefacts wouldbe found. Now it was time to begin diving.Thompson and two Greek divers descended to the flat-bottomed scow in the dredgebucket, and changed into diving gear, with huge copper helmets. Finally,Thompson climbed over the edge of the boat—the boys who would work the air pumpsolemnly shaking hands with him, in case he failed to reappear—and clambereddown the wire ladder. At the bottom he let himself go, and his iron-soled shoesand lead necklace carried him downward. Yellow water changed to green, thenpurple, then black, and pains shot through his ears. When he opened the airvalves, letting out the pressure, these disappeared. Finally, he stood on therock bottom. Here he was surrounded by vertical mud walls left by the dredge,eighteen feet high, with rocks sticking out of them.Another diver joined him and they shook hands. Thompson discovered that, byplacing his helmet against that of his companion, they could hold intelligibleconversations, although their voices sounded like ghosts echoing in thedarkness. They soon decided to abandon their flashlights and submarinetelephone—these were useless in water as thick as pea soup. It was not hard tomove around, since they were almost weightless, like astronauts; Thompson soondiscovered that if he wanted to move to a spot a few feet away, he had to jumpcautiously, or he would shoot straight past it.Another danger came from the huge rocks jutting out of the mud walls that thedredge had excavated. Sometimes these would break loose and fall down. But theysent a wave of water-pressure ahead of them, which gave the divers time to move.So long as they kept their air-lines and speaking tubes away from the walls,they were relatively safe. ‘Had we incautiously been standing with our backs tothe walls, we would have been sheared in two as cleanly as if by a pair ofgigantic shears.’The natives were convinced that giant snakes and lizards swam in the pool. Therewere snakes and lizards—but they had fallen into the pool and were desperate toget out.Thompson did have one bad experience. Digging in a narrow crevice in the floor,a Greek diver beside him, he suddenly felt the movement of something glidingdown on him. A moment later, he was being pushed flat against the bottom. For amoment he remembered the legends of strange monsters. Then the Greek diver beganto push at the object, and as Thompson helped him, he realised that it was atree that had been dislodged from above.On another occasion, gloating over a bell that he had found in a crevice, heforgot to open his air valves to let the air out. Suddenly, as he rose to changehis position, he began to float upwards like a balloon. This was highlydangerous, for a diver’s blood is charged with air bubbles, like champagne, andunless these are released with a slow ascent, they cause a disorder known asdecompression sickness or the ‘bends’, in which a man can die in agony. Thompsonhad the presence of mind to open the valves quickly; but the accidentpermanently damaged his eardrums.The bottom of the cenote yielded the treasure he had hoped for: human bones andskulls, proof that Landa had been telling the truth, and hundreds of ritualobjects of gold, copper and jade. They even found the skull of an oldman—probably a priest dragged down by a struggling girl as she was hurled intothe pool.Only the treasure of Tutankhamen surpassed Thompson’s discoveries at ChichenItzá. The treasures of the sacred well, and the incredibly dramatic story oftheir recovery, made Thompson famous. When he died in 1935, at the age of 75, hehad—as he admitted—squandered most of his fortune on his Maya excavations; butit had been the kind of rich and exciting life of which every schoolboy dreams.His article on Atlantis had led him to a lifetime of adventure, a real-lifeversion of Indiana Jones, who had originally inspired Graham Hancock’s firstexcursion into historical detection.Chichen Itzá holds an important lesson for those who want to make sense ofMeso-America’s bloody past. When I was sixteen, I read Prescott’s Conquest ofMexico, and was shocked by his account of the Aztec sacrifices. Yet the maidensof Chichen Itzá were not thrown into the pool by sadistic priests to pacifycruel gods; they were thrown in as messengers whose purpose was to speak to thegods, to beg the gods to avert some catastrophe. Then they were pulled out.Admittedly, a sacrificial victim whose ribs have been sliced open with a flintknife so that his heart can be torn out cannot expect to survive. But the Mayas,like the ancient Egyptians and Tibetans, seem to have believed that the passageto the underworld is long and perilous—these sacrificial victims were beingoffered a swift and safe passage. The priests thought that they were doing thema favour, and no doubt most of them prepared themselves for death in a perfectlycalm frame of mind, instructed in precisely what to say to the gods by a graveand friendly priest.Whether or not we can accept the notion of a geological cataclysm that destroyedAtlantis and Mu (there seems a general agreement that their destruction occurredcontemporaneously), there can be little doubt about the evidence for greatcatastrophes in the remote past. In fact, ‘catastrophism’ was a respectablescientific theory in the mid-eighteenth century. Its chief exponent was thecelebrated naturalist Count Georges Buffon, an early evolutionist. Buffon’sexplanation of how so many species had become extinct was that they had beendestroyed in great catastrophes, such as floods and earthquakes. Fifty yearslater, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Scottish geologist JamesHutton suggested that, geological changes occur slowly over immense epochs, butsince at this time most scientists accepted Archbishop James Ussher’s view thatthe earth was created in 4004 BC (a view arrived at by adding together all thedates in the Bible), his view made little headway—until another geologist, SirCharles Lyell, produced convincing proofs of the immense age of the earth in hisPrinciples of Geology (1830-33). Science, as usual, lost no time in rushing tothe opposite extreme, and declaring that catastrophism was a primitivesuperstition.In the twentieth century, as Hapgood pointed out in his ‘Great Extinctions’chapter of Earth’s Shifting Crust, this view was modified by discoveries likethat of the Beresovka mammoth in 1901, with fresh flowers still in its stomach.Ignatius Donnelly had devoted many chapters to deluge legends—and evidence—inAtlantis, and even more in its successor, Ragnarok, The Age of Fire and Gravel(1883), which argued that the Pleistocene Ice Age (which started 1.8 millionyears ago) was brought about by a collision of the earth with a comet. InAtlantis he cites Brasseur to show that the Mayas preserved legends of thedestruction of Atlantis.Around the year 1870, a ten-year-old German named Hans Hoerbiger arrived at thecurious conclusion that the moon and planets are covered with a thick layer ofice—in the case of the moon, 125 miles deep. Later, as an engineer, he saw theeffect of molten iron on waterlogged soil, and concluded that some similarexplosion had caused the Big Bang that created the universe. He came to believethat the earth has experienced a series of violent catastrophes, which have beencaused by the capture of a series of ‘moons’. According to Hoerbiger, all theplanetary bodies in the solar system are slowly spiralling in towards the sun.As the smaller bodies move faster than the larger ones, they inevitably passclose to the planets, and are ‘captured’. This, he said, has happened to ourearth at least six times, and our present moon is only the latest in the series.Once captured, the moons spiral in on the earth until they crash on it, causingcataclysms. The last one was captured about a quarter of a million years ago,and as it came closer, its gravity caused all the water of the earth to buncharound its equator. Because of the lighter gravity, men became giants—hence thebiblical quotation about ‘giants in the earth’. Finally it crashed, releasingthe waters and causing great floods, such as those described in the Bible andthe Epic of Gilgamesh.Hoerbiger’s book Glacial Cosmology (1912, with Phillipp Fauth) caused asensation, although astronomers derided it. In due course it wasenthusiastically taken up by the Nazis, and Hitler designated Hoerbiger one ofthe world's three greatest astronomers, together with Ptolemy and Copernicus,and proposed to build an observatory in his honour. But in spite of all thisapproval, Hoerbiger remained distinctly paranoid, and told astronomer Willy Ley,‘Either you believe in me and learn, or you must be treated as an enemy.’ Hisdisciple Hans Schindler Bellamy, an Austrian, continued to propagate histheories after Hoerbiger’s death in 1931, and made even more of the evidence forearth cataclysms. It was not until the flight of Apollo 11 in 1969, and the moonlanding, that millions of Hoerbiger disciples finally conceded that the Masterhad somehow been mistaken.In the 1930s, a Russian-Jewish psychiatrist named Immanuel Velikovsky becameinterested in ancient history through reading Freud’s Moses and Monotheism—whichhad proposed that Moses and the pharaoh Akhnaton were contemporaries, notseparated by a century, as historians believe. Velikovsky’s research led him toconclude that a great deal of the dating of ancient history is hopelessly wrong.His research convinced him that some great catastrophe had befallen the earth inthe distant past. For a while he believed that Hoerbiger’s ‘captive moon’ theorymight be correct, but finally rejected it. Then he came upon texts that seemedto indicate that the planet Venus was not mentioned by ancient astronomersbefore 2000 BC. Could it be that Venus had not been in its present positionbefore the second millennium BC? But if Venus was ‘born’, as many ancient textsseemed to indicate, where was it born from? According to Velikovsky, Greek mythgives us the answer: Venus was born from the forehead of Zeus—that is, ofJupiter. According to Velikovsky, around 1500 BC, some great internal convulsioncaused Jupiter to spew forth a fiery comet, which fell towards the sun. It cameclose to Mars, dragging it out of its orbit, then passed Earth, causing thecatastrophes described in the Bible (and many other ancient texts, allmeticulously cited). It went around the sun, and returned 52 years later,causing more catastrophes; then it settled down as the planet Venus.How did Velikovsky arrive at what sounds like a farrago of pure nonsense? Byreading hundreds of ancient texts, including many from Mayan history (he citesBrasseur repeatedly). The bloody sacrifices of the Aztecs, which so appalled theSpaniards (and which they cited as an excuse for their own massacres) were,according to Velikovsky, aimed at preventing a repeat of the 52-year-intervalcatastrophe.Velikovsky’s success—Worlds in Collision became an instant bestseller in spring1950—was understandable; his scholarship is awesome. For example, in speaking ofthe rain of blood mentioned in Exodus (‘there was blood throughout the land ofEgypt’), he argues that this was actually a red meteoric dust or pigment, andcites a dozen myths and ancient texts, including the Egyptian sage Ipuwer, theMayan Quiché Manuscript (as quoted by Brasseur), the Finnish Kalevala, Pliny,Apollodorus, and several modern historians—all in the course of less than threepages.Although scientists derided Velikovsky’s ideas—and forced the publisher to handover the book to a publisher with no academic list to worry about—Velikovsky hasscored some triumphs. He predicted that Jupiter would emit radio waves, and heproved correct. He predicted that the sun would have a powerful magnetic fieldand proved correct; one critic declared that such a field would have to be 10 tothe power of 19 volts; in fact, this is the figure that has now been calculated.He also suggested that the close approach of celestial bodies causes Earth toreverse its magnetic poles; the cause of such reversals (nine in the past 3.6million years) is still unknown, but scientists now admit that Velikovsky’sexplanation could be the right one.Yet no sooner has the reader conceded that Velikovsky appears to know far morethan his critics than he also has to admit that the notion that the fall of thewalls of Jericho and the parting of the Red Sea were caused by a passing cometis too absurd to be taken seriously. Velikovsky’s thought is bold andexhilarating, but in the last analysis fails to add up to common sense.Where Velikovsky cannot be faulted is in his premise that, at some time in thepast, there were great catastrophes that convulsed the surface of the earth andkilled millions of people and animals. In this sense, perhaps his mostimpressive book is the third in the series, Earth in Upheaval, which is simply a300-page account of evidence for great catastrophes and extinctions. Rather likethat maverick opponent of scientific orthodoxy, Charles Fort, Velikovsky simplycollected hundreds of strange facts—for example, the Columbia Plateau, thepuzzling sheet of lava—200,000 square miles in extent, and often a miledeep—that covers the northern states of America between the Rocky Mountains andthe Pacific coast. Then he mentions that in 1889, during the drilling of anartesian well at Nampa, Idaho, a figurine of baked clay was found at a depth of320 feet in this lava. His intention is to prove that the lava flood occurred inthe past few thousand years (the implication being about 1500 BC). But hisevidence could also be construed to mean that the human race—and‘civilisation’—could be far, far older than we assume. In fact, a remarkablebook called Forbidden Archaeology by Michael A. Cremo and Richard L. Thompson(which will be more fully examined later) does precisely that, arguing that theNampa figurine was found in a layer where the Pliocene age gives way to thePleistocene—about two million years ago.Like Brasseur and Le Plongeon (and Bellamy), Velikovsky speaks of the mystery ofTiahuanaco and Lake Titicaca, in the Andes. Titicaca is the world’s largestfreshwater lake, 138 miles long and in places 70 miles wide. Bellamy writes inMoon, Myths and Man:It is a pity that the Peruvians have not preserved any myths of the time whenthe waters of the girdle-tide (caused by the moon) ebbed off. Near Lake Titicacawe find a very interesting phenomenon: an ancient strand line which is almost12,000 feet above sea level. It is easily verifiable as an ancient littoral(coast line) because calcareous deposits of algae have painted a conspicuouswhite band upon the rocks, and because shells and shingle are littered aboutthere. What is even more remarkable is that on this strand line are situated thecyclopean ruins of the town of Tiahuanaco, enigmatic remains which show fivedistinct landing-places, harbours with moles, and so on, while a canal leads farinland. The only plausible explanation is that the town was once situated on theshores of a girdle-tide, for no one can easily believe that the Andes have risensome 12,000 feet since the town was founded.But if we reject Hoerbiger’s belief that the moon came so close to Earth that itcaused a permanent ‘girdle-tide’ round the equator, then we are left with theonly other explanation: that the Andes have risen more than two miles above sealevel. The presence of various sea creatures—including sea horses—in LakeTiticaca leaves no doubt it was once part of the sea.It was the problem of Lake Titicaca—and the city of Tiahuanaco—that drew GrahamHancock to South America at the start of his search for evidence of an ancientcivilisation that predated dynastic Egypt by thousands of years.The city of Tiahuanaco was once a port, as is revealed by its vast docks—onewharf big enough to take hundreds of ships. The port area is now twelve milessouth of the lake and more than a hundred feet higher. The old port is locatedat a place called Puma Punku (Puma Gate), and dozens of huge blocks lying aroundin chaos indicate that it had been subject to some earthquake or otherdisturbance. This, as the great authority on Tiahuanaco, Professor ArthurPosnansky, observed, caused a flood that drowned part of Tiahuanaco, leavingbehind human skeletons and those of fish.In Tiahuanaco, Graham Hancock came upon the Viracocha legend—the white god fromthe sea—except that here he was known as Thunupa. Hancock was also intrigued tosee that the reed boats of Lake Titicaca looked exactly like those he had seenin Egypt; local Indians declared that the design had been given to them by theViracocha people. A seven-foot statue, carved out of red sandstone, is generallysupposed to be of Viracocha (or Thunupa), a man with round eyes, a straightnose, and a moustache and beard—clearly not an Indian, since the South AmericanIndians have little facial hair. Curious animals, unlike any known to zoology,were carved on the side of his head.Here, as in Egypt, Hancock was baffled by the sheer size of the building blocks,many 30 feet long and 15 feet wide. One of the construction blocks weighed 440tons—more than twice as much as the vast blocks of the Sphinx Temple atGiza—again raising the question of how these primitive people handled suchblocks, and why they chose to work with them rather than with ordinary-sizeblocks. Hancock found a quotation in a Spanish chronicler, Pedro Cieza de Leone,in which local Indians told him that the city had been built in a single night.Another Spanish visitor was told that the stones had been transportedmiraculously ‘to the sound of a trumpet’. This recalls not only the biblicalstory of the walls of Jericho being demolished by the sound of trumpets, but mayalso remind us of Christopher Dunn’s strange speculation that the Egyptians mayhave used ultrasonic sound in drilling the granite sarcophagus in the King’sChamber of the Great Pyramid.One of the main ritual areas of ancient Tiahuanaco was a large enclosure knownas the Kalasasaya, Place of the Standing Stones—roughly 150 by 130 yards—whosename came from the stockade of dagger-like stones, more than twelve feet high,that surround it. Posnansky argued that the purpose of the enclosure wasastronomical—that, in other words, it was an observatory.It was while studying its astronomical alignment that Posnansky noticed therewas something odd about it. Two observation points in the enclosure marked thewinter and summer solstices, the points at which the sun is directly overhead atthe Tropic of Cancer or Capricorn. In our day, the two tropics are exactly 23½degrees (23 degrees and 30 minutes) north and south of the equator. In fact, ourearth rolls slightly, like a ship, and over a cycle of 41,000 years, theposition of the tropics changes from 22.1 degrees to 24.5. (This change is knownas ‘the obliquity of the ecliptic’, and should not be confused with theprecession of the equinoxes.) And Posnansky realised that the two ‘solsticepoints’ in the Kalasasaya revealed that when they were made, the two tropicswere positioned at 23 degrees, 8 minutes and 48 seconds from the equator.Working this out with a table of astronomical positions, he concluded that theKalasasaya must have been built in 15,000 BC, at a time when, according tohistorians, man was still a primitive hunter pursuing mammoths and woolly rhinoswith spears, and immortalising this activity in the cave paintings of Lascaux.Clearly, Posnansky’s dating challenged some of the most fundamental assumptionsof historians.That estimate had stunned his academic colleagues, who preferred a moreconservative estimate of AD 500—roughly the time King Arthur was driving theSaxons out of England. And although Posnansky’s estimate was based on nearlyhalf a century of study of Tiahuanaco, he was dismissed by his colleagues as acrank. Fortunately, his calculations drew the attention of a four-man GermanAstronomical Commission whose purpose was to study archaeological sites in theAndes. This, team, led by Dr Hans Ludendorff of the Potsdam AstronomicalObservatory, studied the Kalasasaya between 1927 and 1930, and not onlyconfirmed that it was an ‘observatory’, but also decided that it had beenconstructed in accordance with an astronomical plan that, at the very least,predated the time of King Arthur by many thousands of years—they suggested 9300BC.Even this struck the scientific community as outrageous. One of the commission,Dr Rolf Müller, reworked the calculations, deciding that if Posnansky was wrongabout the solstice points in the enclosure, and other possible variants weretaken into account, the date could be reduced to 4000 BC. Posnansky finally madehis peace with the establishment by conceding that the correct date could beeither 4500 BC or 10,500. The latter, of course, might suggest that thecatastrophe that destroyed the port of Tiahuanaco and cracked the Gate of theSun in two was the legendary cataclysm that destroyed Atlantis...For Hancock, the Kalasasaya was fascinating for another reason: two massivepieces of statuary—again carved in red sandstone—whose lower half was coveredwith fish scales, bringing to mind again the fish gods who, according to theBabylonian historian Berossus, brought civilisation to Babylonia. The stories ofthe fish-god Oannes sound curiously like those of Viracocha and Kon-Tiki.Finally, the Hancocks stood before the most famous of the Tiahuanaco ruins, the‘Gateway of the Sun’, a smaller version of the Arc de Triomphe, 10 feet high and12½ feet wide, covered with mysterious carvings. Above the gate is a menacingfigure with a weapon in one hand and a thunderbolt in the other—almost certainlyViracocha.Below this, Hancock was intrigued to see the form of an elephant in the complexfrieze—for elephants are unknown on the American continent, and there have beenno such beasts since about 10,000 BC, when a creature with tusks and trunk,called the Cuvieronius, became extinct. Looking more closely, he saw that theelephant was actually formed of crested condors—the design was a kind of visualpun, of the same kind that appeared elsewhere on the frieze, where a human earmight turn out to be a bird’s wing. Among other animals portrayed on the gatewaywas a toxodon, a hippopotamus-like creature that vanished from the Andes atabout the same time as the elephant-like Cuvieronius—in fact, there were no lessthan 46 toxodons. There are also toxodons on Tiahuanaco pottery, and even insculptures. All this certainly suggested that Posnansky was probably right inhis chronology of Tiahuanaco.But the Gateway had never been finished. Something had interrupted the sculptorand snapped the gate in two—and the scattered stone blocks made it obvious thatit was an earthquake. Posnansky believed that this catastrophe had occurred inthe eleventh millennium BC, temporarily drowning the city of Tiahuanaco. Thishad been followed by a series of seismic disturbances that had lowered the levelof the lake and made the climate colder. And at this point, the survivors hadbuilt raised, undulating fields on the land now rescued from under the water.The farming technique, according to a source quoted by Hancock, revealed aremarkable sophistication, so the fields could out-perform fields using modernfarming techniques, producing three times as many potatoes as a similar modernplot. Potatoes in experimental plots created in this ancient pattern by modernagronomists also survived frosts and droughts that would normally ruin the crop.Hancock clearly suspects that these agricultural innovations—as well astechniques for detoxifying the poisonous potatoes of these high regions—werebrought to Tiahuanaco after the ‘catastrophe’ that flooded the city, aspeculation that seems to be in line with the notion that Viracocha and his manynamesakes—Quetzalcoatl, Kon-Tiki, Votan, Thunupa—arrived after the ‘darkening ofthe sun’.Hancock proceeds to an even bolder speculation. The language of the Indiansaround Lake Titicaca is called Aymara (while the language spoken by the Incas ofPeru was Quechua). Aymara has the interesting characteristic of being so simpleand unambiguous in its structures that it can easily be translated intocomputer-language. ‘Was it just coincidence that an apparently artificiallanguage governed by a computer-friendly syntax should be spoken today in theenvirons of Tiahuanaco? Or could Aymara be the legacy of the high learning thatall the legends attribute to Viracocha?’One thing seems clear: that if Viracocha landed on the east coast of CentralAmerica, as the Aztec legends affirm, and his influence was equally powerfulacross the other side of the continent, then the civilisation that he broughtmust have been as vast as the present-day civilisation of Europe or NorthAmerica. And it is unlikely that a civilisation as widespread as this wouldremain confined to one continent: it was probably worldwide—the great maritimecivilisation posited by Charles Hapgood.Graham Hancock went on to travel all over South and Central America, and hisfirst-hand experience of ancient sites confirmed his belief that he was dealingwith a civilisation that preceded the devastation of Tiahuanaco (some time inthe eleventh millennium BC), and which was the common ancestor of dynasticEgypt, as well as of the Olmecs, the Mayas and the Aztecs. Let me summarise hismain conclusions.Again and again he was impressed—and baffled—by the sheer size of the stonesused in some of the ancient structures. In the citadel of Sacsayhuaman (not farfrom Cuzco, Peru)......I craned my neck and looked up at a big granite boulder that my route nowpassed under. Twelve feet high, seven feet across, and weighing considerablymore than 100 tons, it was a work of man, not nature. It had been cut and shapedinto a symphonic harmony of angles, manipulated with apparent ease (as though itwere made of wax or putty) and stood on its end in a wall of other huge andproblematic polygonal blocks, some of them positioned above it, some below it,some to each side, and all in perfectly balanced and well-ordered juxtaposition.Since one of these astonishing pieces of carefully hewn stone had a height oftwenty-eight feet and was calculated to weigh 361 tons (roughly the equivalentof five hundred family-sized automobiles), it seemed to me that a number offundamental questions were crying out for answers.He experienced the same sense of bafflement in Machu Picchu, the ‘lost citadel’hidden away on the top of a mountain, and forgotten for centuries. The Incas,under their leader Manco Capac, had retreated from the Spaniards in 1533, afterPizzaro’s treacherous murder of Manco’s brother, King Atahualpa. From MachuPicchu—perhaps one of the most beautiful and spectacular sights in theworld—they harassed the Spaniards for years, even laying siege to Cuzco. Andalthough they came within a few miles, the Spaniards never discovered theirhideout on the inaccessible mountain top. When the Incas finally gave up thestruggle, Machu Picchu remained deserted for almost four centuries, until theAmerican explorer Hiram Bingham was'led to it by a local Indian in 1911.Machu Picchu was not built by Manco. Although dated by historians to about theend of the fifteenth century AD, Professor Rolf Müller of Potsdam—one of theteam who studied Posnansky’s results at Tiahuanaco—concluded from itsastronomical alignments that it was built between 4000 and 2000 BC.Here, as in Sacsayhuaman, Hancock was staggered by the sheer Magnitude of theachievement. Whoever built Machu Picchu had deployed the same kind of labourforce as the pharaohs who built the pyramids, and had devoted to it the samecare and precision—giant blocks laid together with such exactitude that it wasoften impossible to insert a sheet of paper between them. ‘One smoothly polishedpolygonal monolith was around twelve feet long by five feet wide by five feetthick, and could not have weighed less than 200 tons. How had the ancientbuilders managed to get it up here?’From Peru, the Hancocks travelled to Central America. In Chichen Itzá, inYucatan, Hancock was intrigued by the design of the great pyramid of Kukulcan(one of the many names of Viracocha). It has 365 steps, and in some mysteriousway, these are so arranged that on two days of the year—at the spring and autumnequinoxes—patterns of light and shadow combine to create the illusion of a hugeserpent writhing up the staircase; it lasts precisely 3 hours and 22 minutes.Such a feat is, in its way, as impressive as the construction of the GreatPyramid. In fact, the great pyramid of the Mayas at Cholula, near Mexico City,is three times as massive as the Great Pyramid of Giza, covering an area of 45acres—the largest building on earth.Thirty miles to the north-east of Mexico City lie the ruins of the sacred Tolteccity of Teotihuacan. The first Europeans to see it were Cortés and his soldiers,and the circumstances were—to say the least—unpropitious.On 8 November 1519, Cortés had entered the capital city of the Aztecs,Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), and been awed by its size and beauty. This cityof vast pyramids and temples, palaces and canals, was built in the centre of ahuge lake, and was as sophisticated as Madrid or Venice. These people wereclearly not savages, but the product of an ancient civilisation. The Aztecsdeclared that it was modelled on the original capital of their lost homeland,standing in the middle of a lake and surrounded by concentric canals—whichinevitably brings to mind Plato’s Atlantis.Cortés took the first opportunity to seize the friendly emperor Montezuma, whowould die as the Spaniards’ captive. It was when they massacred the Aztecsduring one of their religious ceremonies that they reaped the whirlwind. It wason the night of 1 July 1520 that the Aztecs caught the Spaniards trying to flee,and slaughtered about five hundred of them and four thousand of their Mexicanallies. The Spaniards called it ‘La Noche Triste’—The Night of Sorrows. Cortésand the survivors escaped north, and found themselves in a valley near an Indianvillage named Otumba; all around them stretched the ruins of an ancient citythat seemed to be buried under tons of earth. There they camped between twogreat mounds.Two days later, they found themselves confronting an immense army of MexicanIndians. Here Cortés revealed his military genius. He realised that a richlydressed man in the centre of the enemy must be the chief, and plunged straightat him with his small band of warriors. The sheer ferocity of the attack tookthe Indians by surprise, and the chief was killed. As the news spread, theIndian armies—who outnumbered the Spaniards by about a hundred to one—fled.The city with the buried pyramids was the ancient capital of Teotihuacan. Thelocal Indians knew nothing about its origin—they said that it had already beenthere when the Aztecs came. The two vast mounds were two pyramids, called theHouse (or Temple) of the Sun and the House of the Moon. These were joined by agreat avenue that the Indians called the Way of the Dead, because they thoughtthe mounds on either side of it were tombs. (They proved to be wrong.) Furtherin the distance there was another great mound, the Temple of Quetzalcoatl.Charnay had started to excavate it in 1883, but gave up. However, he noticed onething that was to strike later observers: that the faces portrayed on potteryand masks had an incredible variety: Caucasian, Greek, Chinese, Japanese andNegro. (A later observer also noted that there were Mongoloid faces, and everykind of white person, particularly Semitic types.) It seemed that, at some pointin its history, the land of the Aztecs and the Mayas had been a cosmopolitancentre like Constantinople.In 1884, an ex-soldier named Leopoldo Batres persuaded his brother-in-law, theinfamous dictator Porfirio Diaz, to appoint him Inspector of Monuments, andallow him to excavate Teotihuacan. Batres was less interested in archaeologythan in finding treasure, or pottery and artefacts that could be sold toEuropean museums. He was puzzled by the sheer quantity of earth and rubble thatcovered the city—as if, he speculated, the inhabitants had deliberately buriedit to protect it from sacrilegious invaders. His excavations revealed that thecity had probably been abandoned after some catastrophe that had set it on fire;many buildings were full of charred skeletons.Batres’s highly profitable excavations continued for more than two decades. Hemanaged to represent himself as a serious archaeologist by publishing a dozen ormore worthless books arguing with fellow archaeologists, but continued toplunder wherever he got the chance.His one indisputable contribution to archaeology was his excavation of one ofthe great triangular mounds under which Cortés had camped nearly four hundredyears earlier. He hired large gangs of workmen at a few cents a day—even hisskilled stonemasons were only paid 25 cents a day—with donkeys and baskets, andthey were soon moving up to a thousand tons of earth a day. Later, he even laida railway at the bottom of the mound, and hauled the earth away in wagons. Andwhat soon began to emerge was a magnificent step pyramid, the area of whose basewas roughly the same as that of the Great Pyramid at Giza (although it was onlyhalf as high). Between two of the upper levels of the pyramid, Batres found twolayers of mica—a glass-like mineral which can be split into extremely finesheets. Since this vast quantity was worth a great deal of money, Batres lost notime in removing it and selling it.The pyramid left no doubt that tales of sacrifice were true. In each corner ofeach ‘step’ the seated skeleton of a six-year-old child was found, buried alive;most crumbled to dust as soon as they were unearthed.On the flat top of the pyramid there were the remains of a temple, now virtuallydestroyed by centuries of vegetable growth. Under the rubble he found a largenumber of human figures carved out of jade, jasper, alabaster and human bone,which convinced him that this was a sun temple dedicated to the god Quetzalcoatl(or Viracocha). He also found a kind of flute that produced a seven-note scaleunlike the European scale.Batres’s idea of excavation would make any modern archaeologist weep. His aimwas simply to create an impressive-looking monument. But the builders of the SunPyramid had not—like the builders of the Giza pyramids—used solid blocks; theyhad used a mixture of adobe and stones. In their enthusiasm, Batres’s workmenoften hacked straight through what had probably been the outer wall, with theresult that three of the faces of the pyramid are half a dozen metres further inthan they should be.Fortunately, Batres was unable to finish his work of vandalism. The pyramid wasintended to be finished in time to celebrate the dictator’s re-election in 1910,but work had still some way to go when Diaz was overthrown, and had to flee toFrance. Batres soon found himself vigorously denounced by archaeologists andscholars, particularly an American lady named Zelia Nuttal, who—now Diaz wasdeposed—was able to detail the sins of Leopoldo Batres with a wealth ofembarrassing detail that came from years of observation. Like his brother-in-lawthe President, the Inspector of Monuments had a great fall,and—mercifully—vanished from the history of archaeology.Further excavation of Teotihuacan has made it clear that the site is asmysterious as Giza. The first and most obvious observation is that the actuallay-out of its three major monuments—the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon, and theTemple of Quetzalcoatl—has much in common with the curious lay-out of thepyramids of Cheops, Chefren and Menkaura. The great square of the ‘Citadel’ (orreligious complex) and the Temple of the Sun are in a direct line along theso-called Street of the Dead, while the Temple of the Moon is at the end of theStreet, and therefore out of alignment with the other two.Graham Hancock visited Teotihuacan, and pondered on its mysteries. Like manyrecent authorities, he had no doubt that the lay-out is astronomical. GeraldHawkins, author of Stonehenge Decoded, points out in Beyond Stonehenge that,while the streets are laid out on a grid system (four miles across), theyintersect at angles of 89 degrees instead of 90. Moreover, the grid is not, asyou might expect, aligned to the four points of the compass, but is twistedsideways so that the Street of the Dead runs north-north-east, pointing at thesetting of the Pleiades.Another discovery of Hawkins may strike us as even more significant. Feeding thedata into his computer, he discovered an alignment with the dog starSirius—which, as we saw earlier, is associated in Egypt with Isis, and which theDogon of Mali know to have an invisible companion, Sirius B. And in his book TheSirius Mystery, Robert Temple points out that the ‘Nommo’—the amphibian godsfrom whom the Dogon claim to have acquired their knowledge of Sirius B—soundvery like the alien amphibians whom the historian Berosus claims foundedBabylonian civilisation, and whose leader was called Oannes. We have alreadynoted the observation made by Le Plongeon regarding the similarity between thisgod’s name and the Mayan word ‘oaana’, meaning ‘He who has his residence inwater’. If he is correct, this would seem to argue a connection between CentralAmerica and the lands of the Middle East. If we also recollect Robert Temple’ssuggestion that the Dogon derived their knowledge from ancient Egypt, then weonce more have what looks like a plausible link between Egypt and South America.Le Plongeon had also noted that many of the pyramids of Yucatan were 21 metresin height, and that their vertical planes (i.e. the plane that would be formedif the pyramid was sliced in half with a huge knife) could be inscribed in asemi-circle—in other words, that the height was the radius of a circle whosediameter was the base. This led him to suspect that these pyramids were intendedto represent the earth—or rather, the upper half of the globe. We have alreadynoted John Taylor’s discovery that the height of the Great Pyramid, whencompared with its base, is precisely the radius of a half-sphere compared to thecircumference of its base, and his speculation that the Pyramid was intended asa representation of the earth. In other words, the Maya method would seem to becruder, but is just as effective a method of suggesting the earth.Hawkins learned of Teotihuacan from a scholar named James Dow, who theorisedthat the city was built on a ‘cosmic framework’. Another scholar, StansburyHagar, has also suggested that Teotihuacan is a ‘map of heaven’, and that theStreet of the Dead is intended to play the part of the Milky Way—as, accordingto Robert Bauval, does the Nile with reference to the Orion ‘stars’ of the Gizapyramids. (Graham Hancock speculates that the Way of the Dead was originallyfilled with water, which would have made it even more like the Nile.) And anengineer named Hugh Harleston, who surveyed Teotihuacan in the 60s and 70s,concluded that it might well be a model of the solar system, with the Temple ofQuetzalcoatl as the sun, and the planets all represented at proportionallycorrect distances, right out to some so-far unexcavated mounds representingNeptune and Pluto. This, of course, sounds totally absurd, with its suggestionthat the builders of Teotihuacan—perhaps AD 500, but perhaps even as long ago as2000 BC—might have known not only the relative distances of the planets, buteven about planets not then discovered. Yet it is no more nor less absurd thanTemple’s observation that the Dogon knew that Sirius was a double star, that themoon was dry and dead, and that Saturn had a ring around it.Harleston went on to work out that the basic unit used in Teotihuacan was 1.059metres. Noting also the frequency of the figure 378 metres (for example, betweenboundary markers along the Way of the Dead), Harleston observed that 1.059multiplied by 378, then by 100,000, gives a very accurate figure for the Polarradius of the earth, and seems to support Le Plongeon’s speculation that thepyramids were designed as scale models of the earth.All this sounds like an argument in favour of von Daniken’s space visitors. Butwhat Schwaller de Lubicz and John West and Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval areall suggesting is rather less controversial: that ancient peoples probablyinherited their knowledge from a civilisation that knew a great many things.Whether these things were originally brought to earth by ‘Nommo’ from the starsis, for our purposes, irrelevant. If ever any evidence for it turns up, then itmight become relevant. But for the moment, there is a far more fascinatingproblem: what these remote people knew, and how they applied their knowledge.This is something we can investigate.But where Teotihuacan is concerned, our investigations still leave the subjectsteeped in mystery. We do not know the date it was built. If it was built by theToltecs, then its date could be anything between AD 500 and 1100. But somecarbon dating has yielded a date at the beginning of the Christian era—which isearlier than the Toltecs. The Aztecs themselves declared that Teotihuacan wasbuilt at the beginning of the Fifth Age, in 3113 BC, by Quetzalcoatl. Theirprevious four ages (or ‘suns’) lasted, respectively, 4008 years, 4010 years,4081 years and 5026 years, which adds up to 17,125 years before the beginning ofthe Fifth Sun. In other words, the Aztecs date the ‘beginnings’ of civilisationback to 20,238 BC. (They also anticipated its end, in violent earthquakes, on 24December 2012.)At the moment, there is so much unexcavated in Teotihuacan that it is impossibleto say when the original site was laid out—it may well be that, as in the caseof Stonehenge, it was built at widely separated periods. We must take intoaccount the possibility that it may have already been there when the Toltecscame, just as it was when the Aztecs discovered it. All we know is that, likethe interior of the Great Pyramid, it seems to have been laid out with a weirdand baffling precision. And why did the builders of the Sun Pyramid want toinstall a layer of mica? The same applies to a building known as the Mica Templenot far from the Sun Pyramid. Under its floor are two enormous sheets of mica,90 feet square. It is fortunate that Batres was dead by the time the Mica Templewas discovered, for it enabled archaeologists to discover a curious fact: thatthe chemistry of the mica reveals that it is not local mica, but that it camefrom Brazil, two thousand miles away. Why? And how were 90-foot sheets of micatransported? Moreover, why was it then placed under the floor? What purpose didit serve there? Graham Hancock points out that mica is used as an insulator incondensers, and that it can be used to slow down nuclear reactions, but it ishard to see how an underfloor layer of mica could serve any scientific purpose.Teotihuacan means ‘City of the gods’, or more literally ‘City where men becomegods’. This makes it sound as if it served some important ritual purpose,perhaps analogous to Bauval’s notion that the ‘air shafts’ of the Great Pyramidare intended to direct the soul of the pharaoh into the sky, where he becomes agod.So, like the Giza complex, the city of Teotihuacan remains a mystery. At themoment, its complex measurements and the arrangement of its strange buildingsmake no sense. All that seems reasonably certain, once again, is that it wasbuilt with astronomical alignments in mind, and that to the Toltecs—or whoeverbuilt it—it symbolised some divine mystery, whose nature has been longforgotten.The same is true of South America’s most famous enigma, the Nazca lines. Thesewere discovered in 1941 by an American professor of history named Paul Kosok,who happened to be flying over the desert near the town of Nazca, Peru, lookingfor irrigation channels. What he saw from the air was a series of hundreds ofamazing drawings in the sand—giant birds, insects, fishes, animals and flowers,including a spider, a condor, a monkey and a whale. They had never been seenbefore because they cannot be seen from ground level—200 square miles ofplateau. At ground level, they proved to be made by moving the small stones thatform the surface of the desert to reveal the hard soil underneath. There arealso huge geometrical figures, and long lines stretching to the horizon, some ofwhich end abruptly on mountain tops.The Nazca plain is windy, but the stones on its surface absorb sufficient heatto cause rising air, which protects the ground level. Rain is extremely rare. Sothe giant drawings have remained undisturbed for centuries, possibly millennia.Some organic remains from the area have been carbon dated to a period between AD350 and 600, and pottery to as early as the first century BC, but the linesthemselves cannot be dated.Erich von Daniken would later suggest that the long lines were intended asrunways for the aircraft of ancient space travellers, but this overlooks thefact that an aeroplane would blast the stones in all directions; the sameapplies to a spacecraft rising vertically.On 22 June 1941, Kosok saw the sun setting at the end of one of the linesstretching into the distance across the desert. It was the midwinter solstice insouthern Peru—that is, the time the sun hovers over the Tropic of Capricorn andprepares to return north. This convinced Kosok that the lines had someastronomical purpose.But when Gerald Hawkins fed the various alignments into his computer, looking ata period from 5000 BC to AD 1900, he was disappointed; none of the lines pointedconclusively at certain stars at significant times—such as the solstice orequinox. Kosok, it seemed, was wrong.But a later investigator, Dr Phyllis Pitluga, of Chicago’s Adler Planetarium,discovered that this was not entirely true. Her researches demonstrated that thegiant spider was intended as a model of the constellation of Orion, and that theseries of straight lines around it were designed to track the three stars ofOrion’s Belt. So the Nazca spider, like the Giza pyramids, is associated withOrion’s Belt.Tony Morrison, a zoologist who studied the lines with Gerald Hawkins, concludeshis book Pathways to the Gods (1978) with a quotation from a Spanish magistrate,Luis de Monzon, who wrote in 1586 about worked stones and ancient roads nearNazca:The old Indians say that... they have knowledge of their ancestors, that in veryold times, before the Incas ruled over them, there came to the land anotherpeople they call Viracochas, not many of them, and they were followed by Indianswho came after them listening to their word, and now the Indians say they musthave been saintly persons. And so to them they built paths which can be seentoday.And here, surely, we have the key to the mystery of the Nazca lines: thelegendary hero-teacher Viracocha, also called Quetzalcoatl and Kon-Tiki, whosereturn was still expected when Cortés landed. The old Indians’ constructed thegreat figures, because they expected Viracocha to return—this time from theair—and the figures were intended as a marker.How did they make the figures? Many writers have speculated that the Indiansmust have possessed hot-air balloons. But even if this were true, it wouldhardly be of much use to the Indians on the ground. You cannot make a 900-footfigure from a thousand feet above it.On the other hand, the construction of giant drawings is not beyond the skill ofa group of dedicated workers guided by priests. It is simply a question ofconstructing a huge version from a small drawing or plan. Ancient Britons faceda similar task when they carved huge figures in the chalk of the Downs, and thesame is true of Gutzon Borglum, the artist who carved the giant faces ofAmerican presidents at Mount Rushmore. Neither is it entirely true that lines onthe desert cannot be seen from ground level—there are many hills and mountainsin the Nazca area that would enable the artists to gain a sense of perspective.Tony Morrison has pointed out that although the stones of the Nazca figures areweathered to a dark colour, the tracks left on the desert by a motor car arebright yellow, and the Nazca lines must originally have been highly visible.It is unlikely, of course, that the lines and figures were intended solely asmarkers. They may also have had some significance as fertility figures, and mayhave been the site of ritual dances. Yet Luis de Monzon’s comment, in 1586, thatthe Indians built paths to Viracocha, surely offers the most obvious andstraightforward explanation of the purpose of the lines.We have seen how, at the end of the nineteenth century, many respectablearchaeologists believed that the Sphinx was far, far older than the pyramids,and how modern Egyptologists have moved steadily in the direction of caution,substituting a kind of dispassionate classicism for what they feel to beirresponsible romanticism. The same thing happened to South Americanarchaeology. In 1922, Byron Cummings, of the University of Arizona, noticed alarge overgrown hill off the road from Mexico City to Cuernavaca, covered with acoating of solid lava. He removed the lava cover—often using dynamite—anddiscovered that it was a truncated pyramid, probably the earliest known. It wasthe Mexican version of the Step Pyramid of Zoser. A New Zealand geologist placedthe age of the lava field between 7,000 and 2,000 years, and Byron Cummingsdecided that 7,000 years was probably accurate. Modern scholars prefer to dateit between 600 BC and AD 200. In his book on archaeology in the Americas,Conquistadores Without Swords (1967), Leo Deuel states that although there mayhave been human beings in Mexico ten thousand or more years ago, farmers andbuilders made their appearance around 2000 BC.In general he echoes the attitude of most archaeologists: that it is pureromanticism to link the pyramids of South America with those of Egypt, becausethere are several thousand years between them. Yet, as we have seen, this may bemissing the point—which is the question of the age of the tradition to which theOlmecs and Toltecs and Mayas belonged. The ruins of Tiahuanaco seem todemonstrate more clearly than others that civilisation in South America may befar older than we suppose.Graham Hancock makes the same point when discussing the Maya calendar, whichcame in turn from the Olmecs (who made the giant negroid heads that curiouslyresemble the face of the Sphinx). The European calendar estimates the length ofthe year to be 365¾ days. The correct length is 365.2422. But the Mayasestimated it at 365.2420—immeasurably more accurate than our western calendar.They estimated the time taken by the moon to revolve around the earth almost asaccurately as a modern computer—29.528395 days. Their astronomy shows asophistication comparable to our own. Yet these were the people of whom onescholar asks how they can have failed to grasp the principle of the wheel. Theanswer, suggests Hancock, is that Maya astronomy was not their own creation, buta legacy from the distant past.All that we know of the civilisations of Central and South America suggests thatthey did not grow up in isolation from the rest of the world. There was a pointwhen they were connected with Europe and the Middle East, perhaps even withIndia. The legends suggest that civilisation was brought to South America bywhite men, soon after some great catastrophe that obscured the sun. Documentsand traditions suggest that such a catastrophe occurred around 10,500 BC.If we cannot be dogmatic about the date of the catastrophe that struckTiahuanaco in the Andes, we do know the date of a catastrophe that struck Egypt.Archaeological evidence shows that agriculture began several millennia beforethe age we usually assign to the first farmers. Before 1300 BC, sickle bladesand corn-grinding stones appear in late Paleolithic tool-kits. The absence offish remains at this period suggests that man had learned to feed himself byagriculture. Then, it seems, a series of natural disasters, including tremendousfloods down the Nile Valley, put an end to the ‘agricultural revolution’ inabout 10,500 BC. This is the date when, West speculates, the destruction of‘Atlantis’ occurred, and survivors came to Egypt and built the earliest versionof the Sphinx. This is the date when, according to Bauval, the ‘proto-Egyptians’planned, and possibly began building, the Giza pyramids. This is also the dategiven by Nature in 1971 and The New Scientist in 1972 as that of the lastreversal of the earth’s magnetic poles.All this at least suggests that the date when the ‘white gods’ came from theeast to Mexico was 10,500 BC. If that is true, and the tradition that Viracochafounded the sacred city of Teotihuacan has a basis in fact, then Teotihuacan wasalso at least ‘planned’ at the same time as the Giza pyramids, and whateverknowledge is embodied in its geometrical lay-out was brought from a civilisationin the throes of destruction.Now we know that the Egyptians attached special importance to the dog starSirius, and to the constellation of Orion, at whose heel it stands. We also knowthat the Abbé Brasseur was convinced that Sirius was the sacred star of theMaya. We have reason to believe that the spider on the Nazca plain representsthe constellation of Orion, which was of equal importance to the Egyptians. As‘coincidences’ like these continue to pile up, it becomes increasingly difficultto avoid the conclusion that the civilisations of North Africa and Central andSouth America had some common origin, and that this common origin lies so deepin the past that our only chance of understanding it lies in deciphering thefaint—almost invisible—signs it has left behind."},{"pageContent":"6 THE ANTIQUITY OF MANThe small town of Altdorf, near Nuremberg, is ignored in most encyclopaedias andgazetteers, which include only its better-known namesake in Switzerland, whereWilliam Tell shot an arrow from his son’s head. Yet it has an even moreremarkable distinction. It is the place where modern man first began to suspectthat his ancestry might extend back for millions of years.The man responsible, Johann Jakob Scheuchzer, would have been horrified at thevery idea. He was a devout Christian who believed that every word of the Bibleis literally true. And it was while trying to prove this that he unleashed theflood that would become modern palaeontology, the science of ancient, extinctorganisms.The year seems to have been 1705—Scheuchzer never bothered to record the exactdate—and he was taking a walk with a friend named Langhans. Both young men werestudents, and they had climbed Gallows Hill, at the top of which stood the towngibbet, and paused to survey the surrounding landscape, with its fields of hopsilluminated by the golden evening sunlight. Then Scheuchzer’s attention wasdrawn to a large rock at his feet. The rock itself was grey, but clearly visiblein it were a number of black vertebrae. Scheuchzer pointed at it.‘Look! There’s a proof that the Flood really took place! That backbone ishuman.’Langhans surveyed the rock with distaste.‘I’m sure it is—some poor devil who was hanged centuries ago. For God’s sake putit down!’And he knocked the rock out of Scheuchzer’s hand. It bounced down the hillside,hit another rock, and smashed. Scheuchzer chased after it with a howl ofanguish. The impact had scattered fragments of the grey rock over a wide area,and Scheuchzer had to scrabble in the dust for a few minutes before he succeededin finding two of the blackened vertebrae. Breathless, he carried them back tothe gibbet.‘Look, human bones! And you saw them inside the rock. How could the bones of ahanged man get inside a rock? These have been here for thousands of years, sinceNoah’s Flood.’‘Why are they black?’‘Because he was one of the sinners that God intended to destroy, like theinhabitants of Sodom.’Ignoring his friend’s protest, Scheuchzer dropped the vertebrae into thecapacious pockets of his frock-coat. It was his doctor’s coat, and he liked towear it on walks, for he often picked up fragments of old bone or flint, to addto his collection of oddments that were supposed to prove the truth of theBible.Five years later, now the chief physician in Zurich, and a canon of the Church,Scheuchzer wrote a pamphlet to prove that the Flood had really taken place. Hepointed out that many rocks with the shape of fishes inside them had been foundhundreds of miles inland, and argued that they had been left high and dry whenthe Flood subsided. Then he went on to describe the two vertebrae he had foundon Gallows Hill, embedded in a stone. How had they got inside the stone?The pamphlet caused a considerable stir, and clergymen quoted it from theirpulpits to prove the truth of the Bible. But scientists were hostile. Fossilshad been known for centuries—a learned Arab named Avicenna had written aboutthem around the year 1000, and explained that they were literally jokes—freaksof a mischievous Nature, which enjoyed imitating living forms, just as cloudsimitate faces. Three centuries later, Leonardo—who often dug up fossils whiledirecting the construction of canals—had suggested they were the remains ofliving animals, but no one took him seriously. Now scientists declared thatScheuchzer’s vertebrae were really pieces of rock.But what enraged Scheuchzer most was a book recently published by a mineralogistnamed John Bajer, which contained a picture of some vertebrae exactly like thosediscovered under the Altdorf gallows. And Bajer had labelled them fishvertebrae. Scheuchzer published a pamphlet attacking Bajer, but Bajer stuck tohis opinion. It would be more than another century before science proved themboth wrong, and identified the bones as those of an ichthyosaurus, a sort ofprehistoric crocodile that flourished in the Jurassic era, around two hundredmillion years ago.Scheuchzer was determined to prove that fossils were the bones of Flood victims,and he had many disciples, who called themselves Floodists (or Diluvians).Sixteen years later, in 1726, the Floodists were triumphant when Scheuchzerproduced conclusive proof of the reality of the Flood. This was a rock from thelimestone quarries of Oningen, in Baden, and it contained some indisputablyhumanoid remains, with an almost complete skull, a spine, and a pelvic bone.Again, the pamphlet about it became something of a bestseller. And again, timewould prove Scheuchzer to have been mistaken; long after his death, his earlyhuman proved to be the skeleton of a lizard.Yet it had served its purpose. Scheuchzer’s pamphlet had caused widespreaddebate, and his supporters grew in number. They mostly agreed with ArchbishopJames Ussher, who, in the time of James I, had worked out that the world wascreated in 4004 BC (by adding together all the dates in the Bible), andconstructed all kinds of amazing creatures from the bones and fragments they dugup, including a unicorn and a dragon. But some of the more perceptive noticedthat fossils found at different depths were often quite unlike one another,which seemed to suggest that creatures might change from age to age...Scheuchzer died in 1733, at the age of 61, still totally convinced that theBible contained the full story of creation—as, indeed, was most of the Christianworld of his time. Yet even by the early eighteenth century, one remarkable manof genius had grasped the truth. His name was Benoit de Maillet, and he was aFrench diplomat, born in 1656. In 1715, Maillet wrote a book called Telliamed(his own name spelt backwards) which suggested that the germ of life came fromouter space, and gradually developed into marine organisms in the ocean. Fishhad crawled on to the land, and developed into birds and animals. All this hadhappened over millions of years. But Maillet decided against publishing the bookin his own lifetime, in case it jeopardised his standing as a governmentofficial. It appeared eleven years after his death, in 1749. But it had beenread in manuscript by many cultured people, and widely discussed. Malilet—who isnow forgotten—should be regarded as the creator of the theory of evolution.Voltaire derided Malilet’s theory, as he also derided the notion that fossilsare the remains of prehistoric organisms. His view was that fish fossils foundin mountains were the remains of travellers’ meals. He did not try to explainwhy the bones had fossilised in rocks instead of rotting away. Voltaire’s typeof scepticism was widespread in the late eighteenth century.Nevertheless, things were slowly changing. In 1780, a German army doctor namedFriedrich Hoffmann was walking in a chalk mine near Maastricht, in Holland, whenhe saw a gigantic ‘dragon’s’ skull in the chalk. He had discovered the firstdinosaur skull. Hoffmann had the skull removed and taken back to the TeylerMuseum in Haarlem, where it created a sensation. He and his fellow scientistsdecided to call it a ‘saurian’. Unfortunately, Hoffmann had neglected to ask theowner of the mine, a priest named Godin, for permission to remove the skull.Godin sued for its return, and won. Deprived of his epoch-making discovery,Hoffmann grew depressed and died. Godin, who sounds an extremely unpleasantcharacter, locked up the skull, and refused to allow scientists access to it.But in 1794, the French invaded, and—to Godin’s chagrin—seized the skull, eventhough he did his best to hide it. It was sent back to the Jardin des Plantes inParis, and studied by the great naturalist Georges Cuvier.Suddenly everyone began to dig for dinosaurs, and many ancient bones wereuncovered. Cuvier became the great expert on extinct species—he boasted that hecould reconstruct a whole skeleton from a single bone. But how had these speciesvanished from the face of the earth? According to Cuvier—who borrowed the theoryfrom his predecessor Count Buffon—the answer was that the earth had been subjectto a series of great catastrophes, like floods and earthquakes, and these hadwiped out whole species. Then Nature had to start all over again. Man and hiscousin the ape had been a product of the latest stage of creation, since thelast catastrophe...This meant, of course, that Cuvier was totally opposed to Maillet’s theory ofevolution—which was now becoming popular with many younger scientists, likeGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Species did not ‘evolve’. They were created, and thenwiped out by catastrophes, like the dragon discovered by Hoffmann.A young Englishman named William Smith had been crawling around in Britishmines, and announced that he had identified no less than thirty-two ‘layers’containing fossils—he gave them names like Carboniferous, Cretaceous andDevonian. And these layers were quite distinct. You did not find Devonianfossils in the Carboniferous layer. That seemed to mean that each geologicalepoch came to an abrupt end—with a catastrophe.It is true that Cuvier was momentarily worried by a discovery made by one of hismost faithful disciples, Baron Ernst Schlotheim, in 1820. Searching among somemammoth bones in Thuringia, Schlotheim found human teeth. According to Cuvier,that was impossible—mammoths belonged to the last age of creation. Cuvierexplained soothingly that probably a gravedigger had buried a body in soilbelonging to the pre-diluvial age, and Schlotheim breathed a sigh of relief—hewas too old to start changing his mind. Two more lots of human remains turned,up among bones of extinct animals; again, Schlotheim let himself be persuadedthat this was a freak.But in 1823, a human skeleton—lacking a head—was found in ancient strata atPaviland, in Wales; because it had been stained red by the earth, it was calledthe Red Lady of Paviland. (In fact, it turned out to be a man.) Inspired bythis, a clergyman named McEnery found ancient tools among mammoth bones inKent’s Cavern in Devon. This should have convinced Cuvier that he was wrong. Heshrugged off the new discoveries as some kind of accident.Cuvier was undoubtedly a great scientist, but he was also a dogmatic bully, whodestroyed the career of his fellow professor Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, anevolutionist who not only believed that species gradually evolve, but that theyevolve because they want to.Cuvier was lucky; he died in 1832, just before the science of geologydiscredited his catastrophe theories.The man responsible was a barrister who was also an enthusiastic student ofgeology, Charles Lyell. After ten years of careful study of the earth’s crust,he concluded that Archbishop Ussher’s chronology—still accepted by millions ofChristians—was absurdly wrong, and that the earth had been formed over millionsof years. Given this time scale, there was no need for catastrophes to thrust upmountains and flood valleys; it could all be explained by slow erosion. HisPrinciples of Geology (1830-33) was one of the most epoch-making books in thehistory of science. He concluded that the Flood had been real, but that it hadbeen the result of melting ice at the end of the last great Ice Age, somefifteen thousand years ago. Landscapes had been slowly carved by glaciers overhundreds of thousands of years. And fish fossils found in mountains had oncebeen at the bottom of prehistoric seas. Lyell was opposed by Catastrophists,Floodists and religious fundamentalists alike, but his views slowly prevailed.The theory of earth history that would gradually emerge over the next fifty orso years was roughly as follows.Our earth has been in existence for about four and a half thousand millionyears, but during the first thousand million, it was a red-hot cinder thatgradually cooled. Sometime during the next thousand million years, the firstliving organisms developed in the warm seas—tiny cells that were birthless anddeathless. The first fossils are of these unicellular organs, dating back tothree and a half thousand million years ago.A mere 630 million years ago, the first truly living organisms appear—organismsthat can reproduce themselves, and therefore afford to die. Life developed itsmethod of handing on the torch to the next generic ation, which would hurlitself afresh at all the old problems.Another forty million years passed before the first invertebrate organisms, liketrilobites, appeared in the seas. We call this the Cambrian era—about 590million years ago—and it was also the era of the first fish. Some of the firstplants also appeared on land.In the Devonian period, about 408 million years ago, fish who found the sea toodangerous began to drag themselves on to the land, and as flippers changed intolegs, became amphibians. Reptiles appeared in the Carboniferous periods, 40million years later. This first great period in Earth’s history—known as thePalaeozoic—ended with the Permian era, 286 million years ago.The second of the three great periods, the Mesozoic, is the age of mammals, thenof dinosaurs, and extends from about 250 million years ago to a mere 65 million.We also now know that Buffon and Cuvier’s catastrophe theory was not altogetherincorrect. It seems that some great object from outer space struck the earth 65million years ago, and destroyed 75 per cent of its living creatures, includingthe dinosaurs. Whatever it was—perhaps a vast meteor, perhaps a comet, perhapseven an asteroid—probably filled the atmosphere with steam, and raised thetemperature enough to kill off most of the larger creatures. But for thiscatastrophe, it is unlikely that human beings would now exist.For at the beginning of the third great age in the earth’s history—known as theCenozoic era—there was a warm, moist world of vast tropical jungles thatextended far into northern Europe. Without the great flesh-eating predators—likeTyrannosaurus Rex and the gigantic toothed bats—it was a fairly placid place,with feathered birds, and squirrel-like rodents that leapt from tree to tree andfed on grubs and birds’ eggs. These rodents gave birth to their young from theirbodies, instead of laying eggs, and they nurtured and protected theirmyoung, soincreasing the survival rate.Sometime in the middle of the Cretaceous era—which began about 144 million yearsago—there developed a tiny shrew-like creature that probably lived in the rootsof trees and ate insects. Shrews are incredibly fierce little animals (which iswhy we call bad-tempered women shrews), like tiny mice; their hearts beat 800times a minute, and they eat several times their own body weight per day.(Because they are so tiny they cannot retain heat.) In the peaceful Cenozoic erathat followed, these shrews felt confident enough to take to the trees, wherethey ate seeds and tender leaves, and a new evolutionary development calledfruit. In the trees they developed a ‘hand’, with a thumb and four fingers, tocling to branches. Many shrews were exterminated by their cousins the rodents,who had teeth that never stopped growing, so never wore out. But they survivedin Africa—or rather the vast continent that then included Africa and SouthAmerica—and became monkeys, with eyes that were side by side, instead of oneither side of the head, making them a better judge of distance. We human beingsare a descendant of the tree shrew.This great revolution in human thinking came about, as everyone knows, because ayoung naturalist named Charles Darwin set out, in December 1831, to sail toSouth America on a ship called the Beagle.The main aim of the voyage, oddly enough, was to take three dark-skinned nativesof Tierra del Fuego, off the coast of South America back to their home. TheBeagle’s captain, Robert Fitzroy—a devout Christian and supporter of slavery—hadpurchased them at low cost (he only paid a pearl button for one of them) andintended to use them in England as unpaid servants. (One of them, a pubescentgirl, Fitzroy had purchased because he was disgusted to see her walking aroundnaked.) Unfortunately, an anti-slave law had been passed while he was at sea,and he was indignantly ordered to take them back. And to give the expeditionsome practical purpose, the minister in charge of the Home Office decreed that ascientist should go along too, to study South American flora and fauna. The manchosen was regarded as something of a failure in life. At 22, Charles Darwin wasalready a failed medical student and a failed clergyman. Then he found heenjoyed zoology and botany, and his professor at Cambridge recommended him forthe post on the Beagle.Darwin also happened to be a good liberal (they were called Whigs in thosedays), and he entirely agreed that the three natives should be returned. Thecaptain was a lifelong Tory, and told the young scientist that he was beingsentimental. In life, the race was won by the fittest and the fastest. Thestrong survived, the weak died off.Darwin was not sure he liked this theory. But then, his grandfather ErasmusDarwin had written a long poem called The Temple of Nature (1803) in which heargued that all life had originated in the seas, then moved on to the land,where the fishes developed limbs and turned into animals. So perhaps CaptainFitzroy was right. Perhaps competition was responsible for the slow improvementof species...The return of the three natives to Tierra del Fuego strengthened his opinion.One of them, a youth they had named York Minster, was strong and dominant, andwas soon happily settled with his brother savages. He quickly threw off hiscivilised ways and went about naked, to the distress of a missionary namedMatthews who had been sent to try and convert the natives. So did the pubescentgirl, whom Fitzroy had named Fuegia. But the youngest and gentlest of thenatives, known as Jemmy Button, was bullied and beaten, and tearfully begged tobe allowed to return on the Beagle; the captain had to refuse him, and as theBeagle sailed away, it was perfectly obvious that, unprotected by the artificialbarriers of civilisation, Jemmy Button was going to have a hard life.The same proved to be true of Fuegia. Ten years later, a ship full of sealhunters stopped off the island, and Fuegia hastened on board to renew heracquaintance with white men. They were unable to believe their luck, and rapedher continuously until she collapsed with exhaustion and almost died. When shewas next seen by British observers, she looked like an old woman. Darwin neverlearned of this, but if he had, it would have reinforced his increasingcertainty that nature was not designed according to liberal principles.As Darwin studied the flora and fauna of Patagonia, he found unmistakable signsthat Cuvier—who was still alive—was mistaken about catastrophes. He came uponthe bones of extinct creatures like megatheria (giant sloths) and toxodonts, yetsaw equally ‘prehistoric’ animals like armadillos and anteaters surviving andflourishing. He also observed the bones of extinct llamas, and saw oddly similarllamas—called guanacos—walking around. The extinct llamas were smaller. Butsurely it was unlikely that God—or nature—had wiped out the ancient llamas thengone to the trouble of creating larger ones? Was it not more likely that theguanacos had evolved from their extinct ancestors?It was half a dozen years later, back in England, that Darwin came across a bookthat once again set him thinking about the ruthlessness of nature left toitself. It was called An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798), by theRev. Thomas Malthus, and it took a distinctly gloomy view of history. Society isnot ascending towards prosperity and liberalism, for prosperity leads morebabies to survive, and the increase in population soon outstrips the increase inprosperity. Society is not headed up but down. If we want to do something aboutthe problem—Malthus argued later—we ourselves have to try to control thepopulation. But in nature, of course, there is no one to control growth. Sopopulation explodes, and the weakest die of starvation.The truth, Darwin recognised, was that if every couple of animals or birds orfishes produce more than two offspring, and those offspring also produce morethan two offspring, the resulting population explosion would cover everyhabitable inch of the earth in a few generations. Death is nature’s way ofpreventing the earth from being overrun.He began breeding livestock—dogs, rabbits, chickens, pigeons—and over twentyyears studied the variations from generation to generation. There were far morethan he had suspected. That settled it. He now had a mechanism that explainedevolution. Nature produced variations. The useful ones survived, the uselessones died out. So, just as his grandfather had supposed, there was a steadychange and improvement, as the useful variations continued to breed andmultiply.Darwin was in no hurry to publish these revolutionary conclusions. He regardedhimself as a good Christian, and was aware that his findings amounted to adecisive rejection of the Book of Genesis. So he plodded on with a vast workthat would have been at least 2500 pages long, and which he half-expected topublish after his death. Then, in 1857, came the bombshell—a letter from anotherzoologist, an ex-schoolmaster named Alfred Russel Wallace, which outlined atheory virtually identical to his own. Darwin was shattered; it looked as if hehad wasted a quarter of a century of work. It would be unfair of him to stand inWallace’s way. He sought the advice of Sir Charles Lyell, the author ofPrinciples of Geology. Lyell’s advice was to publish Wallace’s paper, and abrief summary of his own ideas, simultaneously. This was done in the journal ofthe Linnaean Society. Then Darwin settled down to making a condensation of thevast work he had been writing for years. It took thirteen months, and wasentitled The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection.When it appeared in November 1859, it created the greatest intellectual uproarof the nineteenth century. The book was obviously deeply serious, and its massof fact was overwhelming. Yet its conclusions flew in the face of everyreligious principle that man had held since the beginning of time. The diversityof nature was not the handiwork of God—or the gods—but of a simple mechanicalprinciple: the survival of the fittest. There was no mention of man—except abrief comment in the conclusion that ‘light will be thrown on the origin of manand his history’—but Darwin’s views on that subject emerged clearly in the restof the book. Man was not ‘made in God’s image’; he had no unique place innature. He was simply an animal like other animals, and was probably descendedfrom some kind of ape.The man who was largely responsible for the book’s instant success—it sold outits first edition in one day—was a scientist named Thomas Henry Huxley, whoreviewed it for The Times and hailed it as a masterpiece. Huxley would go on tobecome Darwin’s most powerful defender. Evolution’s equivalent of the Battle ofHastings took place in Oxford in June 1860, when Huxley debated Darwin’s thesisagainst Bishop Samuel Wilberforce (known as ‘Soapy Sam’ because of his unctuousmanner). Wilberforce gave a satirical account of evolution, and then turned toHuxley and asked whether he was descended from a monkey through his mother orhis father. Huxley muttered under his breath: ‘The Lord has delivered him intomy hands.’ He then rose to his feet, and quietly and seriously explainedDarwin’s theory in simple language. He concluded that he would not be ashamed tobe descended from a monkey, but that he would be ashamed to be connected with aman who used his great gifts to obscure the truth. The audience burst into roarsof applause; one lady fainted. And Wilberforce, knowing he was beaten, declinedthe opportunity to reply.It is impossible for us to understand the impact of these views. It is true thatMaillet and Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck had already outlined theories ofevolution. But Darwin’s work did not amount to a theory. It had all the brutalimpact of undeniable scientific fact. And he appeared to be telling the worldthat all its religious creeds were nonsense. There was no need for God tointervene in nature. It was, in effect, a gigantic machine that ground out newspecies as an adding machine grinds out numbers.Darwin was himself opposed to this ‘soulless’ interpretation of his ideas. Afterall, a machine has a maker, and has to be set in motion by human beings. Darwinfelt that he had merely discovered how the mechanisms of evolution operate.Anything that had to be discarded as rubbish was not worth keeping anyway.In a sense he was right. Yet his opponents were also right. Whether he intendedit or not, Darwin had brought about the greatest intellectual change in thehistory of the human race. Man had always taken it for granted that he was thecentre of the universe, and that he had been created by the gods. He scanned therevolving heavens for some sign of Divine purpose, and he scanned nature for theobscure hieroglyphics that would reveal the will of the gods. Now Darwin wastelling him that the hieroglyphics were an optical illusion. The world wasmerely what it appeared to be. It consisted of things, not hidden meanings. Fromnow on, man had to accept that he was on his own.And what was this ‘origin of man and his history’ upon which Darwin promised tothrow some light? Now that most biologists were Darwinians, there was no excusefor being vague and imprecise.In fact, Darwin was convinced that archaeologists would dig up the bones of acreature who was midway between the ape and man—in 1871 he christened it the‘Missing Link’. In 1908, 26 years after Darwin’s death, it looked as if hisprophecy had been fulfilled when a man named Charles Dawson announced that hehad found pieces of an ancient human skull at a place called Piltdown, in EastSussex. With two fellow geologists, he later found a lower jaw that wasdefinitely ape-like, and which fitted the cranium. This was christened ‘PiltdownMan’ or ‘Dawn Man’, and Dawson became famous.Yet the scientists were puzzled. The development of ‘ancient man’ was basicallya development of his brain, and therefore of his skull. Piltdown Man showedconsiderable skull development. So why was his jaw so apelike?The answer was: because it was an ape’s jaw. In 1953, long after Dawson’s death,fluorine analysis of Piltdown Man revealed that he was a hoax—the skull was amere 50,000 years old, while the jawbone was that of an orang-utan or achimpanzee; both had been stained with iron sulphate and pigment to make themlook alike. It is now believed that, for reasons of his own, Dawson perpetratedthe Piltdown hoax.In fact, as early as 1856, a mere seven years after the publication of TheOrigin of Species, it looked as if the first man had been found. A few milesfrom Düsseldorf there is a pleasant little valley called theNeander—Neanderthal, in German—named after a composer of hymns.It has limestone cliffs, and workmen quarrying in these cliffs discovered bonesso heavy and coarse that they assumed they had found the skeleton of a bear. Butas soon as a local schoolmaster named Johann Fuhlrott saw them, he knew this wasno bear, but the remains of an ape-like human being, with a low sloping foreheadand almost no chin. Oddly enough, the brain of this creature was larger thanthat of modern man. But the curvature of the thigh-bones suggested that he hadonce walked in a crouching posture. Could this undersized gorilla be man’searliest ancestor?The learned men said no. Most of them were disciples of Cuvier, and one evensuggested that the skeleton was of a Cossack who had pursued Napoleon back fromRussia in 1814. And the great Rudolf Virchow, founder of cellular pathology,thought it was the skeleton of an idiot. For a while the schoolmaster Fuhlrottwas thoroughly depressed. Then Sir Charles Lyell took a hand, and announced thatthe ‘idiot’ was indeed a primitive human being. And although Virchow refused toadmit he was wrong, more discoveries over the next 25 years left no doubt thatNeanderthal Man was indeed an early human being.So this, it seemed, was the ‘missing link’, or what Darwin’s combative Germandisciple Haeckel preferred to call Pithecanthropus, Ape Man. Or was it? Surelythe ape-man would have a much smaller brain than modern man, not a larger one?In which case, Neanderthal ought to be fairly recent—say, over the past hundredthousand years.The next vital step in the search for ancient man was taken by the French—not bythe Parisian professors of geology, who still believed Cuvier’s assertion thatman is a recent creation, but by two remarkable amateurs. They uncovered theexistence of modern man’s direct ancestor, Cro-Magnon man.It all started some time in the 1820s, when a French lawyer named ÉdouardLartet, who lived in the village of Gers in southern France, was intrigued by ahuge tooth brought to him by a local farmer. Lartet looked it up in his Cuvier,and discovered that it was the tooth of a mammoth. According to Cuvier, mammothshad died out long before man arrived on Earth, so what was a mammoth tooth doingnear the surface? Lartet began to dig, and in 1837, found some bones and skullfragments of an ape-like creature dating from the mid-Tertiary period—perhapsfifteen million years ago. This was later identified as Dryopithecus, which somemodern scientists regard as man’s original ancestor.Lartet now came under the influence of a customs officer and playwright calledBoucher de Crèvecoeur de Perthes, who lived in Abbeville, on the Somme, and whowas convinced that man dated back to the Tertiary era, more than two millionyears ago. Both Lartet and Boucher de Perthes searched Tertiary deposits withoutsuccess.But Boucher de Perthes was now digging in earnest in Picardy, and found manyancient animal bones, as well as hand axes, scrapers and awls that had obviouslybeen made by man. When he showed these to the professors of geology, theyexplained patronisingly that they were not man-made tools, but pieces ofhardened silica that merely looked like tools. But Boucher was saved fromdiscouragement by a visit from Charles Lyell, who had no doubt that his handaxes were made by man.It was a slap in the face for Cuvier’s disciples; the most eminent of all moderngeologists had declared that some form of ‘fossil man’ had existed for tens ofthousands of years, at the time of the mammoth, the sabre-toothed tiger and thecave bear. This was Lyell’s second major claim to an important place in thehistory of science. The cautious Englishman who had advised Darwin not to maketoo much of the descent of man now gave a decisive impetus to the science ofancient man.Boucher’s problem was a certain happy-go-lucky lack of precision, which had madehim an easy target for Cuvier’s followers; his vagueness made even Lyellimpatient. Yet this rather unscientific individual, who was always jumping tothe wrong conclusions, made discoveries of inestimable importance. It was hisassociate Lartet, however, who made the most exciting discovery so far.Now financed by an English industrialist named Henry Christy, and able to devotehis full time to his researches, Lartet abandoned the Tertiary layers, and beganto study the next era—the Pleistocene or Ice Age. In September 1860, he cameacross a pile of primeval kitchen rubbish in Massat, in the department ofArriège, in which he found a stag antler with a cave bear scratched on it.Ancient man, it seemed, was an artist. When a man named Brouillette had found abone engraved with two does 20 years earlier, the professors had dismissed it asa product of children. But Lartet’s antler was in a completely unexplored layer.The learned world was now forced to take him seriously.Next he moved to the valley of the river Vézère, in the Dordogne. This valleywas, as Herbert Wendt has commented, as important for prehistory as the Valleyof the Kings was for Egyptology. In 1864, Lartet found a mammoth’s tusk withhand-axe marks on it—proof positive that man was a contemporary of the mammoth.In 1868, Lartet heard of a new discovery made in the Vézère valley—a caveuncovered by railway construction near the village of Les Eyzies, at a placecalled Cro-Magnon. Lartet sent his son Louis to look at it. Louis had no doubtthat this was the greatest discovery so far. The cave was full of the artefactsof its former occupants. But, more important, it contained skeletons. And askull that lay at the back of the cave was virtually identical to any skull thatcould be found in the local churchyard, with a large brain-case and the juttingchin of modern man.It may be of sinister significance that this dwelling place of modern man wasthe scene of violence. The six Cro-Magnon humans—including three younger men, awoman and a baby—had died under strange circumstances. The woman’s skull had adeep head wound, which was in the process of healing. But it seemed that she haddied while giving birth to the baby. How she and the others had died wasundetermined—the Cro-Magnon cave constitutes the first detective story in humanhistory.As usual, the professors would have none of it. They said the cave was simply aburial site, and that it was probably more or less modern. But their certaintywas soon undermined as other Cro-Magnon skeletons began to turn up in otherplaces, which were obviously not modern burial sites. On a wall in a cave at LesCombarelles there was an engraving of a bearded human face. All the evidenceindicated that such caves were occupied by hunters. The ancient men of theVézère valley lived by pursuing animals. Near the village of Solutré, thousandsof bones of wild horses were found at the foot of a steep crag—the hunters hadchased them into a trap and over the cliff.In short, man's direct ancestor was not Neanderthal man, but these Cro-Magnonhunters and artists, whose women wore ornaments of carved ivory and shells.Cro-Magnon man might have been discovered a decade earlier if a Spanish hidalgocalled Don Marcelino de Sautuola had showed more curiosity. In about 1858—theexact date is not certain—a dog belonging to Don Marcelino, who lived atAltamira, vanished down a crack in the ground when he was out hunting; the crackproved to be the entrance of an underground cave. Don Marcelino had it sealed upfor safety. About twenty years later, after attending the Paris Exhibition of1878 and seeing Ice Age tools, Don Marcelino went into the cave and begandigging for human artefacts; he found a hand axe and some stone arrowheads.Then, one day, his five-year-old daughter Marie came into the cave with him andcried out in excitement; she had seen pictures of charging bulls on the walls,in a part of the cave whose low ceiling had made it inaccessible to her father.The pigment proved to be still wet. And this was to be Don Marcellino’sdownfall. For when he announced his discovery to the world, the expertsdenounced it as a fraud. Don Marcelino died a bitter and disappointed man. Butyears later, after one of these experts—a man named Cartailhac—had studiedsimilar caves at Les Eyzies, he realised that he had done Don Marcelino a greatinjustice, and hurried back to apologise. Marie de Sautuola, now an old lady,could only smile sadly and take him to see Don Marcelino’s grave.Many other painted caves were later discovered—one of the most spectacular atLascaux—full of these drawings of bison, bulls, wild horses, bears,rhinoceroses, and even of men wearing deers’ antlers. These latter wereobviously shamans, or magicians, and it seemed that the purpose of the drawingswas magical—to make sure that the prey was somehow lured into the path of theStone Age hunters.And what of Neanderthal man, who was still around 50,000 years ago, whenCro-Magnon man was performing his magical ceremonies? The fact that he hadvanished from history while Cro-Magnon was still flourishing suggests thesinister hypothesis that he had been wiped out by his artistic cousin...But how old was man?So far, the palaeontologists had succeeded in tracing human history back ahundred thousand years, into the Pleistocene era. A jaw discovered many yearslater—in 1907—in a sandpit near Heidelberg pushed back the age of Neanderthalman to about 150,000 years. But since he was definitely not ‘the missing link’,this did nothing to clarify the early history of man. But ancient skulls andhuman artefacts were always turning up in far older layers, apparentlyjustifying Boucher de Perthes’s conviction that man might date back to theTertiary era.For example, in 1866, in Calaveras County, California, a mine owner namedMattison discovered part of a human-type skull in a layer of gravel 130 feetbelow the surface, at a place called Bald Hill. The layer in which it was foundseemed to date from the Pliocene era, more than two million years ago. It wasexamined by the geologist J. D. Whitney, who told the California Academy ofSciences that it had been found in Pliocene strata.This outraged religious opinion in America, since it seemed to contradict theBible. The religious press attacked the Calaveras skull as a fraud, and oneCongregationalist minister announced that he had talked to miners who hadplanted the skull as a hoax on Whitney. The original hoaxer had been a WellsFargo agent named Scribner, to whom the finder of the skull, Mr Mattison, hadtaken it—not realising that he had planted it as a joke. But a Dr A. S. Hudson,who tried to get to the bottom of the story some years later, was assured byScribner that it was no hoax. And Mattison’s wife verified that her husband hadbrought it back from the mine encrusted with sand and fossils, and they had keptit around the house for a year. In spite of all this, the hoax story stuck.One of those who did not believe it to be a hoax was Alfred Russel Wallace,co-founder of evolutionary theory. He knew that Whitney had investigated manyother reports of human bones found at great depths in mines, and that in somecases the bones appeared to come from strata even older than the Pliocene.Whitney had also investigated stone tools and artefacts that seemed to bemillions of years old. Ten years earlier, a complete human skeleton had beenfound by miners under Table Mountain, Tuolumne County, and nearby were bones andremains that included mastodon teeth—which seemed to date the skeleton to theMiocene, more than five million years ago. Another fragment of a human skull wasalso found in Table Mountain in 1857, near mastodon debris. Whitney examined ahuman jaw and stone artefacts from below the same mountain, with a possible ageof more than nine million years. Human bones found in the Missouri tunnel, inPlacer County, came from a layer deposited more than eight million years ago.Whitney also spoke to a Dr H. H. Boyce who had found human bones in Clay Hill,Eldorado County, in a layer that could have been Pliocene or even Miocene.Whitney brought together all his evidence for ‘Tertiary Man’ (the Tertiaryperiod ended with the Pliocene) in a book called Auriferous Gravels of theSierra Nevada of California in 1880.Some of the artefacts found in Tuolumne, California, sounded so absurd that itwas hard to see how they could not be a hoax. These included a mortar found insitu (i.e. found embedded in the earth at the site, not, say, in some rivervalley where it might have been carried by rivers or glaciers), in gravels morethan 35 million years old, a pestle and mortar found at the same depth, and apestle (known as the King Pestle) found in strata more than nine million yearsold. Yet there would be no possibility of their being ‘planted’ in recent times.It seemed more likely that they might have been taken there by primeval minersthousands of years ago.Understandably, Alfred Russel Wallace was inclined to feel that these finds—anddozens of others like them—suggested that man might indeed be millions of yearsolder than Darwin and Haeckel believed—perhaps because ‘through culture, [man]has been partitioned from the vagaries of natural selection’. So when he heardthat a Kent grocer named Benjamin Harrison had been finding stone hand axes inbeds of gravel that seemed to date from the Pliocene (more than two millionyears old) and even the Miocene era (more than five million), he hastened to goand see him. Harrison lived in Ightham, not far from London, in an area of theWeald—a kind of valley between the North Downs and the South Downs, eroded awayby rivers.A river acts as a kind of excavating tool, for as it cuts down into the earth,it leaves the past exposed in the form of gravels. It reverses the usual law ofarchaeology—that the deeper the level, the older it is, for the higher gravelsare the oldest. Searching these higher levels, Harrison found not only‘neoliths’—sophisticated stone tools made during the last hundred thousandyears—but also ‘palaeoliths’, tools that are perhaps a million years old, andeven ‘eoliths’, tools so primitive that it is often hard to tell them fromnaturally shaped stones.In 1891, Wallace went to see Harrison, and was fascinated by his stones. Likethe eminent geologist Sir John Prestwich, he had no doubt that Harrison’spalaeoliths and eoliths proved that tool-making animals had been around formillions of years.But now the end of the century was approaching, scientists like Wallace andPrestwich were gradually becoming a minority. Darwin’s suggestion that man haddescended from the apes had aroused bitter and derisive opposition, so that evento make such a statement at a public meeting was enough to unleash shouts ofrage or jeers of sarcastic laughter. The argument had become polarised—religiousbigots on the one hand, and aggressive supporters of the ape-man on the other.The ape-man supporters had been delighted with the discovery of Neanderthal, forit seemed to prove that man had been little more than an ape in the last hundredthousand years or so. So Wallace, Prestwich and others of their way of thinkingfound themselves, whether they liked it or not, tarred with the same brush as‘Soapy Sam’ Wilberforce and Captain (now Vice-Admiral) Fitzroy, Darwin’s formershipmate, who remained implacably opposed to Darwinism.Ernst Haeckel, the German Darwinist who liked to assert: ‘It is now anindisputable fact that man is descended from the apes’, agreed with Wallace onone central point: that early man should be sought in the Tertiary era, perhapsfive million years ago. He was also convinced that man’s original ancestor was agibbon, a monkey with very long arms, which is found in Java and Sumatra. Hewould later prove to be wrong about this. But his suggestion fell on fertileground, for it reached the ears of a young Dutch student of anatomy named EugeneDubois, who greatly preferred palaeontology to medicine.It seemed to Dubois that the best way to satisfy his passion for ancient man wasto join the army as a doctor and get himself posted to the Dutch East Indies. In1888 he sailed for Sumatra, then succeeded, on medical grounds, in beingtransferred to Java. He had been sent a skull found in the Trinil highlands ofcentral Java—a skull whose exceptional brain capacity resembled that ofNeanderthal man—and now went to dig in the same place. Soon he found anotherskull, and then, in a region of Tertiary deposits, a fragment of jaw-bone with atooth. He also found many animal bone fragments, until he filled several boxes.Then, in succession, he found a molar, and large bowlshaped fragment of a skull,and a fossilised thigh-bone. This, he felt certain, was the missing link,Haeckel’s Pithecanthropus or ape-man. Yet already there was a feature thatseemed to contradict the Neanderthal find. The thigh-bone showed that thisape-man walked erect, not crouching. He was Pithecanthropus erectus.Dubois wrote and told Haeckel, who was delighted. Then Dubois took his findsback to Leyden, where in 1896 he exhibited them at an international conference.To his disappointment, only a quarter of the professors were convinced. Somethought it was a gibbon, some thought the thigh-bone and the skull did notbelong together, some thought it could not be from the Tertiary period (theyproved to be right). And Virchow, who had declared Neanderthal man to be anidiot, now declared that Pithecanthropus was modern.Dubois showed a deplorable lack of the scientific spirit; he packed up his bonesand refused to let anyone else see them. It was a paranoid reaction, and onethat cost Dubois the triumph that should have been his. For when he finallyallowed the boxes to be opened, in 1927, four more thigh-bones were found. If hehad allowed them to be seen earlier, Virchow would have had to admit defeat. Infact, Dubois became virtually a hermit, and in his later years, was inclined tobelieve that his Pithecanthropus was a gibbon.By that time, another palaeontologist, G. von Koenigswald, had made a carefulstudy of the Trinil strata, and proved that Dubois’s ape-man dated from themid-Pleistocene, and was about 300,000 years old. Eventually, enough bonefragments and stone tools were found to leave no doubt that Java man wasundoubtedly a human being. But was he the ancestor of modern man?A new rival was about to appear on the scene.In 1911, a butterfly collector named Kattwinkel was pursuing a specimen with hisnet when he glanced down and saw that he was about to stumble over the edge of asteep cliff. The Olduvai Gorge, in what was then German East Africa (and is nowTanzania) is virtually invisible until you are about to fall into it. Kattwinkelclimbed down the 300-foot slope, and found that the gorge had an abundance ofrocks containing fossils. He pushed a few of these into his collecting bag, andtook them back to Berlin. When a so-far unknown three-toed horse was found amongthem, a geologist named Professor Hans Reck was asked to go and study the gorge.He soon made some important finds—bones of prehistoric hippos, elephants andantelopes. Then one of his native assistants saw a piece of bone sticking out ofthe earth. After scraping away the surface, he found himself peering at whatlooked like an ape skull, embedded in the rock. It had to be chipped out withhammers and chisels, and proved to be a human being, not an ape. Reck identifiedthe strata in which it had been found as about 800,000 years old.Could it have been a more recent burial? Reck finally decided against it. If agrave is filled in—even a hundred thousand years ago—a good geologist can tell.So it looked as if Reck had proved that human beings not unlike modern man,lived in Africa nearly a million years ago. While it would not be true to saythat it flew in the face of all Darwinian teaching—for there was nothing inDarwin that said man had evolved from ape in the past two million years—itcertainly contradicted the assumption that had been made ever since Darwinannounced the Missing Link, and that seemed to be verified by the discovery ofCro-Magnon man.Back in Berlin, Reck announced his discovery, and was startled at the hostilityhe aroused. As usual, the experts simply refused to admit that this might be anancient human ancestor. It was simply not apelike enough. In effect, Reck wasattacking the theory of evolution. The skeleton had to be younger—perhaps a merefive thousand years.The First World War caused the controversy to be forgotten. But not in Africa.Dr Louis Leakey, an anthropologist who was a fellow of St John’s in Cambridge,went to Berlin in 1925 (when he was 23), met Reck, and saw the skeleton. He alsowas inclined to date it as recent. But in 1931, he and Reck went to the sitewith other geologists, and carefully studied the strata. And when he saw somestone implements that had been discovered in the same layer—and even in the bedbelow—he came around to Reck’s opinion.In a sense, this was almost as heretical as Alfred Russel Wallace’s view thatmodern humans existed in the Tertiary. Now Leakey announced that Dubois’s Javaman could not be a human ancestor—and neither could another recent discovery, anape-like skeleton found at Chou-kou-tien in China in 1929, and labelled PekingMan. If a fully developed creature had been around at the same time, then Reck’sskeleton was more likely to be the ancestor of modern man.The experts attacked. It was simply unlikely, said two British palaeontologistscalled Cooper and Watson, that a complete skeleton could be that old. And thefiling of the teeth made it sound like modern Africans...By now, Leakey had made two more discoveries, at Kanam and Kanjera, near LakeVictoria—a jaw and molar in Kanam and three skulls in Kanjera. And again, theyseemed to be from fully human beings—Homo sapiens. The Kanjera beds ranged from400,000 to 700,000 years old. In other words, Leakey had discovered a Cro-Magnonthat was at least four times as old as it should be. He regarded this asadditional support for his view that Reck’s skeleton was truly human.But at this point there was another intervention. A Professor T. Mollison, whowas on record as thinking that Reck’s skeleton was a modern Masai tribesman, nowwent to Berlin, obtained some of the material that had surrounded the skeletonwhen it was found, and sent it to be examined by a geologist named PercyBoswell. Boswell has been described by Leakey’s biographer as ‘contradictory...emotional’ and with ‘the proverbial chip on his shoulder’. Boswell studied it,and published in Nature a report claiming that he had found bright red pebbleslike those in bed 3 (above the bed where the skeleton was found), and chips oflimestone like those of bed 5, far above bed 2. It seemed odd that neither Recknor Leakey had noticed this. And yet instead of pointing this out, they bothgave way, and conceded that they had probably been wrong. The skeleton, theyagreed, had probably got down into bed 2 as a result of a burial—a possibilityReck had ruled out at the very beginning—or possibly an earthquake.But in March 1933, a commission of 28 scientists studied the Kanjera skulls andthe Kanam jaw, and concluded that the jaw was early Pleistocene (possibly morethan a million years old) and that the skulls were middle Pleistocene (possiblyhalf a million years old).Once again Percy Boswell entered the fray. His doubts led Leakey to invite himto Africa. But he failed to prove his point. He had marked the sites of thefinds with iron pegs, but it seemed that locals had stolen them for spearheadsor fish hooks. He had photographed the sites, but his camera had malfunctioned.He had borrowed a photograph taken by a friend of his wife’s, but this proved tobe of another canyon. And he had not been able to mark them exactly on a map,because no maps of sufficient detail existed. Boswell reacted unfavourably tothese signs of sloppiness, and his report was damning. In effect, he simplyrefused to believe Leakey.Following Boswell’s report, Leakey protested that he had shown Boswell theprecise site of one of the skulls, and proved it by picking up a small piece ofbone that fitted skull number 3. As to the jaw, it had been found in associationwith a site with mastodon and Deinotherium fossils, which dated it to the earlyPleistocene.Boswell would not have this. He felt that since no scientist had seen the jaw insitu, it could not be accepted. Finally, after much argument, and some ambiguouschemical testing, the experts decided that the jaw and skulls were at most 20 to30,000 years old.The real problem, of course, was that if Leakey’s finds and Reck’s skeleton hadbeen accepted as Homo sapiens, then the history of mankind would have to berevised. Java man and Peking man suggested a simple line of descent fromape-like creatures of half a million years ago, and Leakey was suggesting thatthese were mere cousins of Homo sapiens, who—as Wallace believed—had been aroundsince the Tertiary.Leakey had already given way on Reck’s skeleton, but this time he dug in hisheels. He had declared in his Stone Age Races of Kenya that the Kanam tooth wasnot merely the oldest human fragment from Africa, but the most ancient fragmentof true Homo yet discovered in the world. Even his biographer, Sonia Cole,deplores this refusal to change his mind, and regards it as a sign of sheerstubbornness.But more conventional anthropologists were about to receive the most powerfulsupport yet.In 1924, Dr Raymond Dart, the professor of anatomy at the University ofWitwatersrand, South Africa, received two cratesful of fossils from a limestonequarry at a place called Taung, 200 miles south-west of Johannesburg. The Dartswere about to give a wedding party, and Mrs Dart begged him to ignore them untilthe guests had gone. But Dart’s curiosity was too great. And in the secondcrate, he found himself looking into a piece of rock containing the rear part ofa skull. And it was obvious that the brain it had once contained was as large asthat of a sizeable gorilla. Nearby he found a piece of rock containing the frontpart of the skull. The moment the last guest had departed, Dart borrowed hiswife’s knitting needles, and began chipping away the stone. It took almost threemonths, and on 23 December, the rock parted, and he was able to look at theface. He then realised that this creature with a large brain was—incredibly—ababy with milk teeth. A baby with a 500 cc brain had to be some form of humanbeing. But Dart reckoned that the level at which it had been found was at leasta million years old.When his account of the Taung skull appeared in Nature on 7 February 1925, hebecame an overnight celebrity. Surely this had to be the missing link?Many experts disagreed, and suggested that the Taung baby was an ape. Sir ArthurKeith, one of the great authorities, had a different reason for rejecting thebaby as the missing link. If it was a million years old, and Cro-Magnon man wasabout 100,000 years old, there was simply not time for the Taung baby to developinto Homo sapiens.But to begin with, Dart’s skull aroused widespread attention. Then the tone ofcomment began to change. By 1931, the scientific establishment had turnedagainst him. In that year, he appeared before the Zoological Society of London,together with Davidson Black, who had discovered Peking man. Davidson Black’spresentation was highly professional, with visual aids; by comparison, Dart,clutching his baby skull, looked bumbling and unconvincing. A monograph on theskull, which he called Australopithecus (southern ape) was rejected by the RoyalSociety.Dart went back to South Africa and buried himself in his department of anatomy.Like Leakey, he had not changed his mind, but he decided to keep this fact tohimself.One of Dart’s warmest supporters was a retired zoologist named Robert Broom. NowBroom decided to emerge from retirement to take up arms. In 1936, the supervisorof a Sterkfontein limestone quarry handed Broom another rock containing anancient skull fragment, which proved to be from an adult Australopithecine. Thena femur (thigh-bone) was found, and it looked unmistakably human. In 1938, Broomlocated a schoolboy with a pocket-full of teeth and fragments of jaw-bone, andthese enabled him to recognise that he had discovered a new type ofAustralopithecus, which he called Paranthropus (nearman) robustus. This seemedto be a vegetarian type of Australopithecus. The fact that he was a vegetarianseemed to suggest that he might be an animal rather than a human ancestor.In 1947, Broom found another Paranthropus fossil in a cave at Swartkrans; healso found a small and more human-like creature, which he called Teleanthropus.Later, he decided that it belonged to the same species as Java man and Pekingman, which had now been classified as a type called Homo erectus, and generallyaccepted as a direct ancestor of modern man. Stone and bone tools also found atSwartkrans seemed to indicate that Paranthropus was a true man.Broom’s activity stirred Dart to emerge from his retirement. In 1948, he wentback to a tunnel in Makapansgat, where he had found bones in 1925. He had alsofound some evidence of fire, which had confirmed his opinion thatAustralopithecus was humanoid. Now he found more bones and more evidence offire, and labelled the creature who lived there Australopithecus prometheus.But Dart found something altogether more interesting at Makapansgat—42 baboonskulls, of which 27 showed signs of having been struck by some kind of club. Heconcluded that the club—which made two indentations—was an antelope’s humerus(upper leg-bone). This led him to the startling conclusion that Australopithecushad been a killer—the first known human ancestor to use a weapon. He went on todevelop the thesis that southern ape-man had emerged from the apes for onereason only—because he had learned to commit murder with weapons. In 1961, aplaywright-turned-anthropologist named Robert Ardrey gave the idea wide popularcurrency in a book called African Genesis, which argued that man became manbecause he learned how to kill, and that unless he unlearns it soon, he willdestroy the human race.In 1953, the year that Dart published his controversial paper The PredatoryTransition from Ape to Man, Kenneth Oakley of the British Museum subjected thePiltdown skull to fluorine tests, and revealed it to be a hoax. In the 1930s,Sir Arthur Keith had cited the Piltdown skull to discredit Australopithecus, forit seemed to show that ‘intelligence came first’. Now the skull was discredited,the opposition to Dart’s Australopithecus began to melt away, and Dart’s theoryof the killer ape was suddenly made horribly plausible. Here at last was anevolutionary theory that seemed designed to prove Darwin’s survival of thefittest.But the battle was not yet quite over.Louis Leakey was also back again and, together with his wife Mary, was diggingin the Olduvai Gorge. There in bed 1, below the level of Reck’s skeleton, hefound crude pebble choppers, and round stones that might have been used as abolas—two or three balls on a leather thong, used for throwing around ananimal’s legs. He even found a bone that might have been a leather working tool.But when, in 1959, he found skull fragments of a creature similar toAustralopithecus robustus, he was disappointed. His wife admitted that, after 30years, he was still hoping to find Homo sapiens. He called his new ape-manZinjanthropus—Zinj meaning East Africa. Oddly enough, he decided that the toolsat the site belonged to Zinjanthropus, although they suggested a creature ofmore intelligence.At least, Zinjanthropus restored Leakey’s standing among palaeontologists; itlooked as if he had repented his earlier heresies. One year later, his sonJonathan found another skull in bed 1, below Zinjanthropus. This had a largerbrain than Zinjanthropus—680 cc compared to 530—but was still smaller than Homoerectus skulls (at around 800). A nearby hand and foot found by Louis and MaryLeakey were undeniably human. Tools found in the area also indicated that thiswas a human ancestor. At Dart’s suggestion, Leakey called it Homo habilis,tool-making man.Leakey was rather pleased with himself. Before Homo habilis,palaeo-anthropologists had assumed that Homo erectus was the direct descendantof Australopithecus. Now Leakey had shown that a more truly human ancestorinterposed between the two. Admittedly, this was something of a climb-down afterhis earlier belief that Homo sapiens might be found in the early Pleistocene.But it was better than nothing. In fact, Leakey still showed traces of the oldheretic when he remarked that he felt that Australopithecus showed variousspecialised developments that did not lead towards man.But there were many stone tools found at Pleistocene sites that left no doubtthat some early man was a tool maker. Yet such tools were never found inassociation with Australopithecus remains.By now—the late 1960s—Louis Leakey’s son Richard and his wife Meave had joinedthe search for human origins. In August 1972, one of Richard Leakey’s team founda shattered skull at Lake Turkana. Reconstructed by Meave Leakey, it looked muchmore human than Australopithecus, with a domed forehead and a brain capacity ofover 800 cc. Leakey estimated that it was about 2.9 million years old. Hedecided that it was another specimen of Homo habilis. But if it was that old,then it was a contemporary of Australopithecus, and that meant thatAustralopithecus might not after all be a human ancestor. Leakey suggested thatAustralopithecus had vanished from prehistory like the Neanderthals.J. D. Birdsell, the author of a book called Human Evolution, was inclined todate Richard Leakey’s Homo habilis at about two million years ago. But he wastroubled about Leakey’s assertion that Homo habilis led to Homo erectus. Itseemed to Birdsell that Homo habilis was more anatomically ‘modern’ than Homoerectus, and that development from Homo habilis to Homo erectus would be aretrogressive step. He was inclined to agree with Richard’s father Louis Leakeythat probably Homo erectus was not a main part of the human line.Interesting evidence for a more ‘human’ ancestor continued to turn up. Leakeywas summoned by a colleague named John Harris to look at a human-like femur(thigh-bone) found among elephant bones in deposits older than 2.6 millionyears. More missing parts were found on further search. Again, they were unlikethose of Australopithecus, and more like those of modern man. Leakey felt thatthey demonstrated that this creature—Homo habilis—walked upright all the time,while Australopithecus walked upright only some of the time. When a techniquecalled potassium-argon dating seemed to show that the layer of material—known astuff—in which the bones were found was 2.9 million years old, it certainlylooked as if this Homo habilis was the oldest human specimen ever found.But there was to be yet another twist to the story.In 1973, a young anthropologist from the University of Chicago, Donald Johanson,was at a conference in Nairobi, where he met Richard Leakey. He mentioned toLeakey that a French geologist had told him of a promising site at Hadar, in theAfar desert of north-eastern Ethiopia, and that he was now on his way there tosearch for hominid fossils. When Leakey asked if he really expected to findhominids, Johanson replied: ‘Yes, older than yours.’ They bet a bottle of wineon it.In fact, things went badly during the first season. Johanson failed to findfossils, and his grant was running out. But one afternoon, he found a tibia—thebone of the lower leg. A further search uncovered the knee joint and part of theupper bone. The deposits in which they were found was over three million yearsold. In his paper reporting the find, Johanson suggested that it could be fourmillion years old, and gave his reasons for thinking it was humanoid. Hisdiscovery brought him another $25,000 in grants.On 30 November 1974, Johanson and his colleague Tom Gray were searching anotherHadar site, and as the temperature reached 103, were preparing to quit. ButJohanson had been ‘feeling lucky’ all day, and insisted on looking in a gulleythat had already been searched. There he saw a piece of arm bone that lookedlike a monkey. Gray went on to find a fragment of skull and a part of a femur.When they found other parts of a skeleton, they went into a kind of wild wardance of triumph. Later, as they were celebrating back at camp, and playing aBeatles record called ‘Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds’, they decided to calltheir find (whose small size suggested a female) Lucy. Potassium-argon datingand magnetic dating methods showed Lucy to be about 3.5 million years old.In the following year, on a hillside in Hadar, Johanson and his team found bonesof no less than thirteen hominids, which they labelled ‘the First Family’. Allproved to be of about the same age as Lucy. They also found stone tools ofbetter workmanship than those of the Olduvai Gorge. When John Harris objectedthat these tools, found on the surface, might be modern, Johanson undertook moreexcavations and uncovered stone tools in situ, with an approximate age of 2.5million years.So it looked as if Lucy and the First Family were undoubtedly human, and,moreover, earlier than Leakey’s Homo habilis. At this point, Johanson wasinclined to believe that Lucy was an Australopithecus, while the First Familywas a type of Homo habilis. Richard Leakey thought that Lucy was probably a‘late Ramapithecus’—the early ape that is quite probably not a human ancestor.But Johanson was later persuaded by a palaeontologist named Timothy White thatthe finds were all a type of Australopithecus. At this point, Johanson decidedto call the Hadar group Australopithecus afarensis (after the Afar desert).This, then, would seem to be the conclusion finally reached by the science ofancient man. Human beings have evolved over the course of three and a halfmillion years, beginning with the ape-like Australopithecus afarensis. A millionyears later, this had evolved into Australopithecus africanus—‘Dartian man’.Then came Homo habilis, Homo erectus, and finally, Homo sapiens. The schemecertainly seems satisfyingly tidy and complete.Yet doubts persist. Australopithecus was not known to be a tool maker, yet toolswere found at ‘the First Family’ site. Could it be, after all, that the FirstFamily were a group of Homo habilis, and that Homo habilis co-existed withAustralopithecus?Another find strengthens the doubt. In 1979, Mary Leakey was at Laetoli, twentymiles south of the Olduvai Gorge. And among fossil footprints of animals set involcanic ash, her son Philip, and another expedition member, Peter Jones,discovered some hominid footprints, dating (according to potassium-argon dating)to about 3.6 to 3.8 million years ago. Yet they looked typically human, with a‘raised arch, rounded heel, pronounced ball and forward pointing big toenecessary for walking erect’.It would seem that, after nearly 300 years, the problem of Scheuchzer’s ‘oldsinner’ is in some ways as obscure as ever."},{"pageContent":"7 FORBIDDEN ARCHAEOLOGYAnd what difference does it make whether man is two million years old, or ten,or even more?None whatsoever, if we can accept that Australopithecus afarensis could havedeveloped into Homo sapiens in about three and a half million years.For this is the problem: time scale.Sir Arthur Keith wrote about the Taung skull that it ‘is much too late in thescale of time to have any part in man’s ancestry’. At that point, it was assumedthat the Taung skull was about a million years old, and Keith felt that therewas simply not time for such an ape-like creature to turn into Homo sapiens in900,000 years.But even if we suppose that Lucy was a much earlier form of human being, theproblem remains. In the two million or so years between Lucy and ‘Dart’s baby’,there has been very little change—both might well be apes. Homo erectus, half amillion years old, still seems apelike. Then, in a mere 400,000 years—a blink ofthe eyelid in geological time—we have Homo sapiens, and Neanderthals with abrain far larger than modern man.If, on the other hand, Reck and Leakey are right, then Homo sapiens may havebeen around far longer than two million years, and the time scale becomesaltogether more believable. Mary Leakey wrote about the Laetoli footprint:‘...at least 3,600,000 years ago, in Pliocene times, what I believe to be man’sdirect ancestor walked fully upright with a bipedal, free-striding gait... theform of his foot exactly the same as ours.’ And since it is the form of the footthat counts in human evolution—how recently the creature descended from thetrees—this is of central importance.If a hominid with a human foot existed more than three million years ago, itwould certainly add useful support to the argument of this book—thatcivilisation is thousands of years older than historians believe. At first sightthat statement may sound absurd—what difference can a few thousand years make,when we are speaking in millions? But what is really at issue here is thedevelopment of the human mind. In Time-scale, Nigel Calder quotes theanthropologist T. Wynn to the effect that tests devised by the psychologist JeanPiaget, carried out on Stone Age tools from Isimila, Tanzania—whose uraniumdating shows them to be 330,000 years old—indicate that the makers were asintelligent as modern humans.1 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark12]This is as startling in its way as Mary Leakey’s comment that upright creatureswere walking around 3,600,000 years ago. It strikes us as somehow unreasonable.If there were intelligent creatures walking around 330,000 years ago, why didthey not do something with their intelligence—invent the bow and arrow, or paintpictures? In fact, the question is unreasonable. Invention tends to be theoutcome of challenges. Without challenges, things are inclined to go on much asthey did yesterday and the day before. Small groups of hominids, living inwidely separated environments, were in the same position as people living inremote villages a few centuries ago. They must have been incredibly parochial;each generation did exactly what its father and grandfathers andgreat-grandfathers did, because no one had any new ideas. Think of one of thoseRussian villages in nineteenth-century Russian novels, then multiply the boredomand narrow-mindedness by ten, and you begin to see how man could have remainedunchanged for hundreds of thousands of years.In other words, highly intelligent men may have gone on making the same kind ofcrude tools simply because they could see no reason to do anything else. It istrue that walking upright confers certain advantages—a man can see further thanan ape or a dog, and the fact that his eyes are set side by side, instead of oneither side of his head, means that he is a better judge of distance, which isan advantage in hunting. But there is no good reason why an upright creatureshould not remain unchanged for a million years if no new challenges presentthemselves.And what about the obvious objection—that if there were ‘human’ ancestorswalking the earth three or four million years ago, why have we not found theirremains? The answer lies in Richard Leakey’s comment (in People of the Lake):‘If someone went to the trouble of collecting together in one room all thefossil remains so far discovered of our ancestors (and their biologicalrelatives) ... he would need only a couple of large trestle tables on which tospread them out.’ Of the millions of hominids who lived on earth in prehistory,we merely have a few bones.Yet even as it is, the trestle tables would contain some interestingevidence—like Reck’s skeleton and Leakey’s Kanam jaw—that seem to suggest thatman may have been around rather longer than we suppose.In 1976, a young American student of political science named Michael A. Cremobecame a member of the Bhaktivedanta Institute in Florida, which teaches a formof Hinduism called Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Cremo’s guru, known as Swami Prabhupada,suggested to him that he should study paleoanthropology, with a view to tryingto establish that Homo sapiens may be millions of years older than is generallyaccepted. (Prabhupada died in the following year, 1977.)The thought of a scientific investigation being initiated for religious reasonsarouses understandable misgivings—memories of the Scopes ‘monkey trial’ inTennessee, and of modern born-again Christians who still oppose Darwinism. Yetit would be a mistake to bracket the outlook of Hinduism with that of some ofthe more dogmatic forms of Christianity, for Hinduism is remarkably free fromdogmas. Its most fundamental belief is expressed in the Sanskrit phrase Tat tvamasi, ‘That thou art’—that the essence of the individual soul (Atman) isidentical with the essence of God (Brahman). In Christianity, the statement ‘TheKingdom of God is within you’ is generally taken to mean the same thing.In other words, the core of vedantism (the basic philosophy of Hinduism) is anundogmatic belief in the spiritual nature of reality. So it would be incorrectto compare Cremo’s assignment with that of some Christian fundamentalist whosets out to prove that Darwinism must be false because it conflicts with theBook of Genesis. The Hindu equivalent of the Book of Genesis is the Vedic hymns,probably the oldest literature in the world, and commentary on the Vedas, theBhaga-vata Purana, states that human beings have existed on earth for fourimmense cycles of time, known as yugas, each lasting for several thousand ‘yearsof the demigods’; since each year of the demigods is equal to 360 earth years,the total cycle of four yugas amounts to 4,320,000 years.But Cremo was not being asked to ‘prove’ the Bhagavata Purana—merely to examinethe evidence of palaeoanthropology, and to assess it objectively.He and his colleague Richard L. Thompson, a mathematician and scientist, were tospend several years studying material on human origins. Eventually their book,Forbidden Archaeology, would appear in 1993. This is not a polemic arguing foror against Darwinism, but simply an exhaustive study—more than 900 pages long—ofthe history of palaeoanthropology.Cremo’s curiosity was piqued by the fact that there seemed to be so few reportsabout ancient man from 1859, when The Origin of Species was published, to 1894,the year of Java man. Studying volumes on anthropology from the late nineteenthand early twentieth centuries, Cremo found negative comments on many reportsduring this period, which made him aware that there had been plenty of reports,but that because they seemed to contradict the new Darwinian orthodoxy, they hadbeen ignored. By tracking them down through footnotes, and then searching outthe original papers in university libraries, he was finally able to get hold ofmany of these reports.Here are some typical examples, from the hundreds offered in the book.In the early 1870s, Baron von Ducker was in the Museum of Athens, and wasintrigued by animal bones that showed signs of deliberate fracturing to extractthe marrow—they included those of an extinct three-toed horse called Hipparion.The sharp edges of the fractures seemed to argue that they had been broken byheavy stones rather than by the gnawing of animals. Von Ducker went to the placewhere they had been found—at a village called Pikermi—and soon excavated a hugepile of fractured bones from a site that was undoubtedly late Miocene (certainlyearlier than five million years ago).Professor Albert Gaudry, who had selected the bones for the museum display,admitted: ‘I find every now and then breaks in bones that resemble those made bythe hand of man.’ He went on to add: ‘But it is difficult for me to admit this.’Other academic colleagues insisted that the bones had been broken by animalslike hyenas.At about this time—in 1872—the geologist Edward Charlesworth showed a meeting ofthe Royal Anthropological Society many sharks’ teeth with holes bored throughthem, as if to make necklaces—like those of modern South Sea Islanders. Thelayer from which they were recovered was between two and two and a half millionyears old. Professor Richard Owen commented that ‘human mechanical agency’ wasthe likeliest explanation. Australopithecus, of course, did not make ornaments.Although Charlesworth ruled out boring molluscs, his academic colleagues decidedthat the holes were made by a combination of wear, decay and parasites.In 1874, archaeologist Frank Calvert reported that he had found proof of theexistence of man in the Miocene era. In a cliff face in the Dardanelles, hefound a bone that belonged either to a dinotherium or a mastodon, engraved withthe picture of a ‘horned quadruped’ and the traces of seven or eight otherfigures. A Russian geologist named Tchihatcheff agreed that the stratum was ofthe Miocene period. But since Calvert was regarded as an amateur, his find wasignored.I am offering only a brief summary of these examples; Cremo cites dozens more.Among the most impressive is the case of Carlos Ribeiro.In the writings of the geologist J. D. Whitney—mentioned in the last chapter inconnection with finds in California—Cremo found several mentions of a Portuguesegeologist named Carlos Ribeiro who had made some interesting discoveries in the1860s. But no works by Ribeiro were found in the libraries. Finally, he found anaccount of Ribeiro in Le Préhistorique by Gabriel de Mortillet (1883), and fromde Mortillet’s footnotes, was able to trace a number of Ribeiro’s articles inFrench journals of archaeology and anthropology.What they learned was that Ribeiro was no amateur. He was the head of theGeological Survey in Portugal. In the early 1860s, he was studying stoneimplements found in Portugal’s Quaternary strata (i.e. Pleistocene). When heheard about flint tools being found in Tertiary beds of limestone in the TagusRiver basin, he hurried to examine them and do his own digging. Deep inside alimestone bed inclined at an angle of more than 30 degrees to the horizontal, heextracted ‘worked flints’. This embarrassed him, for he knew that this was tooearly for human artefacts. So his report stated that the beds must bePleistocene.When, in an 1866 map of Portugal’s geological strata, Ribeiro called the bedsPleistocene, he was challenged by the French geologist Édouard de Verneuil, whopointed out that the beds were generally agreed to be Pliocene and Miocene.Meanwhile, more interesting finds had been made in France by a reputableinvestigator, the Abbé Louis Bourgeois, at Thenay, near Orleans. The flints werecrudely made but, in the Abbe’s opinion, undoubtedly artefacts; moreover, thefact that some of them showed signs of having been in contact with fire seemedto support this view.Now the Abbé Bourgeois had been digging for flints since the mid-1840s, longbefore Darwin’s revolution, so he was not deeply concerned that the flints hadbeen found in Miocene beds (from 25 to five million years ago). But when heshowed them in Paris in 1867, his colleagues were not happy.Their first objection was that they were not artefacts, but ‘nature-facts’.There are, however, various simple ways of distinguishing human handiwork onflints. A natural piece of flint, found in the ground, usually looks like anyother stone, with round surfaces. But the difference between flint and otherstones is that when struck at an angle, it flakes, leaving a flat surface(although the blow often causes a ripple effect).The first step in making a flint tool is to knock off the rounded end. This flatsurface is known as the striking platform. After this, the flint has to bestruck delicately again and again, with great skill. One result that is usuallyfound is a ‘bulb of percussion’, a gentle swelling like a blister. Often smallchips are struck out, leaving a scar-shaped hole known as an eraillure (graze).A flint with two knife-like edges and these other features is certain to beman-made. Being rolled along the bed of a torrent or struck by a plough mayproduce an object that looks vaguely man-made, but an expert can usuallydistinguish at a glance.When, as in the case of Bourgeois, there are dozens of such flints, it becomesincreasingly difficult to explain them as ‘naturefacts’. When Sir John Prestwich(who would become Benjamin Harrison’s patron) objected that the flints could berecent because they were found on the surface, Bourgeois dug down and foundmore. When critics suggested that these flints may have fallen down throughfissures in the top of the plateau, Bourgeois disproved it by digging down intothe plateau, and finding that there was a limestone bed a foot thick, whichwould have prevented man-made flints from falling into an ‘earlier’ layer.When Ribeiro heard about this, he ceased to declare that his Tagus River bedswere Quaternary, and agreed they were Tertiary. Subsequent geologists haveagreed with him. And he began openly speaking about worked flints found inMiocene beds.In the Paris Exposition of 1878 (which inspired Don Marcelino de Sautuola toexplore his cave at Altamira), Ribeiro exhibited 95 of his flint and quartzite‘tools’. De Mortillet examined them, and although he felt that 73 were doubtful,agreed that 22 of them showed sign of human workmanship. This, as Cremo pointsout, was quite an admission for de Mortillet, who was flatly opposed to the ideaof human beings in the Tertiary. And Émile Cartailhac, who was among those wholater denounced Sautuola as a fraud, was so enthusiastic that he came backseveral times to show the flints to friends. De Mortillet said he felt he waslooking at Mousterian tools (made by Neanderthal man), but coarser.We have to remember that at this time, Haeckel was proposing that the missinglink would be found in the Pliocene, or even late Miocene, while Darwin thoughthe might be found as early as the Eocene, which began 55 million years ago. SoCartailhac and the rest did not necessarily feel like heretics.In 1880, Ribeiro showed more flints at an International Congress of Anthropologyand Archaeology in Lisbon, and wrote a report on Tertiary man in Portugal. TheCongress appointed a team of geologists to go and look at the beds, includingCartailhac, de Mortillet and the famous German Rudolf Virchow, who had declaredNeanderthal man an idiot. On 22 September 1880, they all set out at six in themorning on a special train from Lisbon, and from the train windows pointed outto one another the Jurassic, Cretaceous and other strata. They reached the hillof Monte Redondo, where Ribeiro had found so many flints, and split up tosearch. They found many worked flints on the surface, while the Italian G.Belucci found in situ, in an early Miocene bed, one flint that everyone agreedto be ‘worked’.In the subsequent discussion at the Congress there was virtually universalagreement that Ribeiro had proved that man existed in the Miocene era.There was no change of heart about Ribeiro, no sudden denunciation by thescientific establishment. After Dubois’s discovery of Java man (which, as wehave seen, was itself hotly contested), his views—and his evidence—were simplyforgotten. No one has disproved that his flints were Miocene, or suggested aconvincing reason why they were found in Miocene beds. They were merely allowedto drop out of the record.Late in the summer of 1860, Professor Giuseppe Ragazzoni, a geologist of theTechnical Institute of Brescia, was in Castenodolo, six miles south-east ofBrescia. He was going to look for fossil shells in the Pliocene strata exposedat the base of a low hill, the Colle de Vento.Among the shells he found a top piece of a cranium, full of coral cemented withblue clay, then nearby, more bones of the thorax and limbs.Two fellow geologists had no doubt they were human bones, but thought they werefrom a more recent burial. But Ragazzoni was not happy. He knew that, during thePliocene, a warm sea had washed the foot of the hill. The bones were coveredwith coral and shells; ergo, they had probably been washed up by the Pliocenesea. He later found two more fragments of bone at the same site.Fifteen years later a local businessman, Carlo Germani, bought the area to sellthe phosphate-rich clay as fertiliser, and Ragazzoni asked him to look out forbones. Five years later, in January 1880, Germani’s workmen found fragments of askull, with part of a lower jaw and some teeth. More fragments followed. Then,in February a complete human skeleton was unearthed. It was slightly distorted,apparently by pressure of the strata. When restored, the cranium wasindistinguishable from that of a modern woman. It was buried in marine mud, withno intermixture of yellow sand and iron-red clay of higher strata. Thepossibility that the skeleton had been washed into the blue marine clay by astream was ruled out by the fact that the clay that covered it was itself inlayers—strata—which meant that the skeleton had been slowly buried in the clayover a long period. Geologists who examined the bed placed it in themid-Pliocene—about three and a half million years ago, the same period as Lucyand the First Family.In 1883, Professor Giuseppe Sergi, an anatomist from the University of Rome,visited the site, and decided that the various bones and skull fragmentsrepresented a man, woman and two children. The trench dug in 1880 was stillthere, and Sergi could clearly see the strata, all clear and separate. He agreedthat there was not the slightest chance that the bones could have been washeddown from above, because the red clay was quite distinctive. As to burial, thefemale skeleton was in an overturned position that made it clear that this wasunlikely.So it looked as if undeniable proof that Homo sapiens existed in the Pliocenehad now been established.But there was to be a complication. In 1889, another skeleton was found atCastenodolo. This one lay on its back in the oyster beds, and looked as if ithad been buried. Sergi came again, with a fellow professor named Arthur Issel.Both agreed that this skeleton had been buried, and that therefore it wasprobably more recent. But when Issel wrote about it, he concluded that thisdemonstrated that the earlier skeletons had also been recent burials, perhapsdisturbed by agricultural work. (Since it had nothing to do with the earlierskeletons, it demonstrated nothing of the sort.) He added that Sergi agreed withhim. So as far as geology was concerned, the Castenodolo skeletons could all bedismissed as Quaternary.But Sergi did not agree with him, as he made clear later. He saw no reasonwhatever to change his opinion that the earlier skeletons were Pliocene.Michael Cremo goes on to quote an archaeologist, Professor R. A. S. Macalister,writing in 1921, who begins by admitting that Ragazzoni and Sergi were men ofconsiderable reputation, and that their opinion must therefore be takenseriously—then goes on to add that ‘there must be something wrong somewhere’.Pliocene bones of Homo sapiens implied a ‘long standstill for evolution’, sowhatever the evidence, the earlier Castenodolo skeletons had to be disallowed.This, Cremo points out reasonably, is applying preconceptions to the evidence.If Homo sapiens—or something like him—existed in the Pliocene, then man has notevolved much in the past four million years, and this is contrary to Darwin’stheory of evolution. In that case, the shark also contradicts the theory ofevolution, for it has remained unchanged in 150 million years.In his book Secrets of the Ice Age (1980), dealing with the world of theCro-Magnon cave artists, Evan Hadingham writes:The excitement of recent discoveries in East Africa tends to obscure oneimportant fact: the earliest human record is not one of rapid innovation andingenuity but of almost inconceivable stagnation and conservatism. Certainfeatures of the early hominid skulls, notably the form of the teeth and jaws,remained essentially unchanged for millions of years. It is particularlystriking that brain capacity seems to have stayed fairly constant at around 600to 800 cubic centimetres (a little over half the average modern capacity), for aperiod approaching two million years in length.It needs to be explained that brain capacity is not necessarily a measure ofintelligence. Although the average for modern humans is 1400 cc, a person can behighly intelligent with far less than this—Anatole France’s brain was only 1000cc. And, of course, Neanderthal man had a brain of 2000 cc. So a human ancestorwith an 800 cc brain would not necessarily be obviously more stupid than amodern man.Another story from Hadingham’s book might be taken as a cautionary tale. NearLake Mungo, in Australia, a grave containing a ‘modern man’ was found, dating toabout 30,000 years ago; it had been buried in red ochre, a substance used incave paintings, but also extensively used by Neanderthals. But at a place calledKow Swamp, remains of a far more primitive people—physically speaking—werefound. They dated from 10,000 BC—20 thousand years later than the Lake Mungopeople. These two types, modern and primitive, co-existed. So Cremo is arguing,Australopithecines and a more modern type of man could have co-existed more thantwo million years ago. The evidence exists—in the Reck skeleton, the Kanam jaw,the Laetoli footprints, as well as in the Ribeiro finds, the Castenodoloskeletons, and the many finds described by J. D. Whitney from the Tuolumne TableMountain in California—but is discounted by modern palaeoanthropologists.Cremo is not arguing that there is some kind of scientific conspiracy tosuppress the evidence that Homo sapiens may be far older than 100,000 years. Heis arguing that modern anthropology has created a simple and scientificallyconsistent ‘story of mankind’, and is unwilling to consider any changes in aconveniently uncomplicated script.Let me summarise this ‘script’, as it would be accepted by most historians.In Africa, about twelve million years ago, the lush forests of the Miocene beganto disappear as less and less rain fell; by the Pliocene, seven million yearslater, forests had given way to grasslands. It was at this point that our humanancestors—some Ramapithecus-type of ape—decided to descend from the trees andtake their chance on the savannahs. Three million years later, the ape haddeveloped into Australopithecus afarensis. Lucy and her kind in turn became thetwo types of Australopithecus, the meat-eating Dartians and the vegetarian A.robustus.Two million years ago, the rains came back and the Pleistocene era began with anice age that lasted 65,000 years. And for the rest of the Pleistocene, therewere a series of ‘interglacials’—warm periods that produced deserts—followed byice ages, four of each. During this time, Australopithecus learned to use hiswits and his weapons, and began the swift evolutionary ascent that turned himinto man—Homo habilis, then Homo erectus, whose brain was twice as big asAustralopithecus.Then, about half a million years ago, there occurred another mysterious eventfor which science has been unable to account—the ‘brain explosion’. Between halfa million years ago and modern times, the human brain expanded by another third,and most of that growth has been in the cerebrum, the top part of the brain,with which we think. In African Genesis, Robert Ardrey has an interesting theoryto explain why this came about.Around 700,000 years ago, we know that a gigantic meteorite, or perhaps even asmall asteroid, exploded over the Indian Ocean, scattering tiny fragments—knownas tektites—over an area of twenty million square miles. The earth’s Poles alsoreversed, so North became South, and vice-versa. (No one knows quite why thishappened, or why it has happened a number of times in the earth’s history.)During this period, the earth would be without a magnetic field, and this couldhave led to a bombardment by cosmic rays and high-speed particles which may havecaused genetic mutations. For whatever reason, man evolved more in half amillion years than in the previous three million.The ‘brain explosion’ raised the curtain on the age of True Man. TheNeanderthals were a failed evolutionary experiment which ran from about 150,000years ago (or possibly more than twice that long), and which collapsed becausethese ape-men were unable to compete with Cro-Magnon man, who destroyed theNeanderthal about 30,000 years ago. Then finally the stage was set for modernman.And suddenly, history moves much faster.In Egypt, around 18,000 years ago, during the Ice Age, someone noticed thatseeds dropped into cracks in the mud at the edge of streams turned into cropsthat could be harvested with stone sickles. A thousand years later, hunters whohad learned to make rope and tallow lamps were painting animals in the caves atLascaux, in France—not, as we have seen, for artistic reasons, but as part of amagical ritual to lure them into traps.Fourteen thousand years ago, when the ice began to melt, hunters from Asiacrossed the land bridge over what is now the Bering Strait, and began topopulate America. Others learned to make boats and fishing gear—like harpoonsand fish-hooks—and made their living from the seas. In Japan, the first ceramicpots were made. Twelve thousand years ago, wolves were domesticated into dogs,and sheep and goats followed during the next millennium.Ten thousand six hundred years ago, the first walled town sprang up in theJordan valley, the place we now call Jericho, and the local residents harvesteda wild grass called wheat. Then, during the next thousand years, a geneticaccident crossed wheat with goat grass, creating a heavier and plumper varietycalled emmer. A further genetic accident crossed emmer with another goat grass,creating bread wheat, whose grains are so heavy and tightly packed that theywill not scatter on the wind. It was man who learned to cultivate this newgrain, and who thus ceased to be a hunter-gatherer and became a farmer. He addedcattle to his list of domestic animals, discovered how to weave sheep and goatwool into cloth, and learned to irrigate his fields.In some mysterious way, the farming revolution spread all over the world; inAfrica and China, millet was cultivated; in America, beans and maize, in NewGuinea, sugar cane, in Indochina, rice. Eight thousand years ago, civilisationas we know it had spread to the corners of the earth. Bread was baked in ovens;so was pottery. Copper—found in lumps lying on the surface—was beaten intoblades. But one day, someone noticed that a gold-coloured liquid was flowingfrom a lump of green malachite that had fallen into a hot fire, and that whenthis liquid solidified, it was pure copper. The next step was to place the greenmalachite into a bread oven, and collect the copper that flowed from it; thiscould be made into axe and arrowheads.The trouble was that copper would not take an edge, but this was solved around6000 years ago when it was discovered that arsenic had the power to hardencopper into an alloy. So had tin, and the result, a metal that was hard enoughto make swords, was called bronze. Together with the newly domesticated animalcalled the horse (about the size of a modern pony), the sword enabled a newwarrior caste to terrorise their neighbours, so that an increasing number oftowns had to be built with walls.Also about 6000 years ago, someone decided that hoeing the soil was hard work,and that it could be lightened if an ox could be tethered to the hoe. And whenthe invention of the harness solved that problem, the farmer was able to use amuch heavier hoe—the plough—to break up the fine, dry soil of the Middle East. Afew centuries later, these Middle Eastern plough farmers moved north, hackeddown the European forests, and cultivated land that had been too heavy for thehoe. They were the ancestors of the present Europeans.Trade between the towns meant that some kind of token was needed to representsuch objects as sheep, goats and measures of grain. In fact, the very firstfarmers—around ten thousand years ago—had modified the ‘notation bones’ of StoneAge man into clay tablets of various shapes—cones, cylinders, spheres and soon—to stand for objects that could be traded. Five thousand six hundred yearsago, in Sumer, Mesopotamia, the king’s accountants sent out similar tokens—inclay containers—as tax demands. The next step was obvious—to press the variousshapes on to soft pieces of clay, and so save the trouble of making cones andspheres and cylinders. But now someone had thought of using soft clay, it wasobviously common sense to scratch symbols on them—symbols representing an animalor a man. So writing was first practised, and it has a claim to be the mostimportant of all man’s inventions. Now at last he could communicate with othermen at a distance without having to rely on the messenger’s memory; now he couldstore his own knowledge, as Stone Age man had stored the phases of the moon onpieces of bone.And now—at this very late stage in the development of civilisation—came theinvention that we moderns are inclined to regard as the greatest of all: thewheel. No one is certain how this came about, but the likeliest possibility isthat it was the invention of the Mediterranean potter, who learned around 6000years ago that if the wet clay could be spun on a turntable, it could be moreeasily shaped with the hands. But how could a turntable be made to spin? Theobvious solution was to place it on an axle which was kept upright in a hole inthe ground. Now if another wooden wheel was placed on the axle slightly aboveground level, the potter could spin this with his feet. The heavier the wheel,the more it turned at a constant speed.The science of transportation had so far managed without the wheel, although ourancestors certainly knew that heavy objects could be moved on rollers laid sideby side. In snowy climes, the answer was the sledge. But the notion of twowheels on an axle suggested new possibilities. For example, if attached to aplough, they made it easier to pull. And four of them placed underneath a cartwould enable it to carry a heavy load.The simplest way of making a wheel was to chop a slice off a log. But this haddrawbacks. The lines that radiate out across the tree-rings are lines ofweakness, and a wheel made in this way soon splits. A band of metal around theedge will hold it together, but it is still fatally weak. The answer was to joina number of planks until they formed a square, then to hack it into a circle.And now a band of metal hammered around the edge made a highly durable wheel.But if two wheels were fixed at either end of an axle, how could they turn? Oneof the earliest solutions was to make the axle itself turn, by attaching it tothe underside of the cart (or plough) with leather straps or metal bands.Technology soon solved that problem by leaving a small gap between the axle andthe centre of the wheel. This gap could even be plugged with short, cylindricalpegs which reduced the friction—the first ball bearings.And so, approximately 5,500 years ago, Mediterranean man produced his two mostimportant contributions to history: writing and the wheel. The writing was madeup of crude ‘pictographs’, and the wheel was made up of crude segments; but theyserved their purpose admirably. And if civilisation had been as peaceful andstable as in the early days of farming, they might have remained unchanged foranother four thousand years. But a new factor was about to enter human historywhich accelerated the pace of change: warfare.The domestication of the horse and the discovery of bronze had already created anew type of human being: the warrior. But the early warriors confined themselvesto defending their own territory and occasionally stealing other people’s. Now,as towns turned into cities, and the cities grew more prosperous, so theirrulers grew more powerful. Inevitably, these rulers began to think ofexpansion—which meant conquest, which in turn meant taxes. Within two or threecenturies of the invention of the wheel, the Age of Warrior Kings began in theMiddle East. But warfare demanded fast chariots, and fast chariots could only beachieved with light wheels. The result was the invention of the spoked wheel.And when knife-blades were fastened to these wheels, they became formidable inbattle. Akkad, the northern part of Babylon, became the world’s first empire,and by 4,400 years ago, its king was already calling himself ‘emperor of all thelands of the earth’.‘Empires’ required communication between their most distant parts, and the oldcrude picture-writing was no longer flexible enough. Around 4,400 years ago,some scribe in Mesopotamia had one of the most inspired ideas in human history:developing a form of writing that was based upon human language rather than onpictures of objects. In other words, a particular symbol would stand for asyllable. Two thousand years later, the Chinese would develop a form of writingbased on the old pictographs—with the result that Chinese has about eightythousand symbols. The genius who thought up ‘syllable-writing’ in the Land ofthe Two Rivers had taken one of the most important imaginative leaps in thehistory of mankind.At about the same time, horsemen from the steppes of Russia swept southward intowhat is now Turkey. These ‘charioteers’ were pale-skinned compared toMediterranean man, and as they stormed into China and India, they brought thelanguage and culture that came to be called Indo-European.Meanwhile, across the Mediterranean in Egypt, tribes of nomads had been unitedunder a single king—the legendary Menes—by 5,200 years ago, and the Egyptianssoon contributed to the history of human invention by discovering mummification,around 4,600 years ago; and by developing the royal tombs—called mastabas—intopyramids built of massive stone blocks. In a few hundred years, the Egyptianshad developed an amazingly sophisticated science, mathematics, astronomy andmedicine...Which is, of course, the point where this book began.The above section is a summary of what we might describe as ‘conventionalhistory’. And we have already seen that it leaves many questions unanswered.Hapgood raised one of the major objections in Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings:that there is evidence for a worldwide seafaring civilisation in the days whenAntarctica was free of ice, possibly around 7000 BC. The Piri Re’is map, andother portolans, certainly constitute the strongest proof so far that there issomething wrong with ‘conventional history’.But if the whole aim of this argument was merely to place the origin ofcivilisation back a few thousand years, it would hardly be worth the effort.Neither would there be any point in trying to suggest that man may have been inexistence for a million or so years longer. It would make no real difference toHapgood’s seafaring civilisation whether man is two million years old or ten.It is the implications of the ‘alternative history’ that are so important.What Cremo is suggesting is that there is evidence for beings anatomicallysimilar to modern man existing as long ago as the Miocene, or even longer.If these hypothetical beings were anatomically similar, then they walkedupright, which freed their hands—which in turn suggests that they used tools, ifonly crude stone implements, eoliths. The use of tools not only demands acertain level of intelligence; it also tends to develop intelligence. Confrontedwith some problem that might be solved by tools, the tool-user considers thevarious possibilities and exercises his mind.Then why did Homo sapiens not develop much sooner? Because we tend to livemechanically. Provided we can eat and drink and satisfy our basic needs, we feelno need to innovate. Modern experiments have shown that apes can be taught tocommunicate in sign language and paint pictures. They possess the necessaryintelligence. Then why have they not developed these abilities in the course oftheir evolution? Because they had no one to teach them. There is all thedifference in the world between intelligence and making optimum use of thatintelligence—a point that emerges clearly in Wynn’s remark that Piaget’sintelligence tests revealed that the tool makers of 330,000 years ago were asintelligent as modern men. Then why did man of half a million years ago begin toevolve so rapidly? Ardrey could be right; perhaps some external event, like thegreat explosion that covered the earth with tektites, caused some geneticmutation. Yet that in itself would not provide the whole answer We have seenthat Neanderthals had a far bigger brain than modern man, yet still failed todevelop into Homo sapiens sapiens.If man had suddenly developed the ability to use tools, this would provide theobvious explanation. But Johanson’s ‘First Family’ was already using crude toolsthree million years earlier. And it cannot be explained by some climatic changethat acted as a challenge, for the bad weather of the Pleistocene had alreadylasted for one and a half million years.Another plausible suggestion is that man began to develop language half amillion years ago—that is, a more sophisticated language than grunts. But thisis open to an obvious objection: what did he want to say? A primitive huntingcommunity has no more need for language than a pack of wolves. Language developsin response to a certain complexity in society—for example, every new technologyrequires new words. But primitive society had no new technology. So the languagetheory falls prey to the same objection as the tool theory.The Hungarian anthropologist Oscar Maerth even made the interesting suggestionthat the answer may lie in cannibalism. In 1929, a palaeontologist named PieWen-Chung had discovered in caves near Chou-kou-tien the petrified skull of oneof man’s earliest ancestors. It looked more like a chimpanzee than a humanbeing, and his associate Teilhard de Chardin thought the teeth were those of abeast of prey. It had a sloping forehead, enormous brow ridges, and a recedingchin. But the brain was twice as big as that of a chimpanzee—800 cc as comparedto 400. And as more limbs, skulls and teeth were discovered, it became clearthat this beast of prey walked upright. It looked at first as if this was thelong-sought Missing Link, but the evidence soon disproved it. ‘Peking Man’ (ashe was labelled) knew the use of fire—his favourite meal had been venison. Thiscreature, who had lived half a million years ago, was a true human being.He was also a cannibal. All the 40 skulls discovered at Chou-kou-tien weremutilated at the base, creating a gap through which a hand could be inserted toscoop out the brains. Franz Weidenreich, the scientist in charge of theinvestigation, had no doubt that the creatures had been slaughtered in a body,dragged into the caves, and roasted and eaten. By whom? Presumably other PekingMen. In other caves in the area, evidence of Cro-Magnon man was found, and herealso was evidence of cannibalism.There is, as we know, evidence to suggest that Neanderthal man indulged incannibalism. Maerth himself claims that a day after eating raw ape brains in anAsian restaurant, he experienced a feeling of warmth in the brain and a sense ofheightened vitality, including a powerful sexual impulse. Ritualcannibalism—which Maerth studied in Borneo, Sumatra and New Guinea—is based onthe belief that the strength of the dead enemy passes into the person who eatshim, and this could well be based on the experience of heightened vitalitydescribed by Maerth, who believes that ‘intelligence can be eaten’.There is an obvious problem with Maerth’s theory. If eating human brainsproduced intelligence, then the few south-east Asian tribes that still indulgein it ought to be far more intelligent than Westerners whose ancestors gave itup thousands of years ago; this does not appear to be so. Moreover, in order toexplain the rate at which man evolved after about 500,000 years ago, we wouldneed far more evidence of widespread cannibalism, and this is simply lacking.So, reluctantly, the cannibal theory must be regarded as unproven.The problem with the ‘conventional history’ outlined above is that it impliesthat man is essentially passive. He drops seeds into a crack in the ground, andrealises that they turn into crops. He moves a heavy load on rollers, andrealises that a slice off a roller becomes a wheel. It all sounds so accidental,rather like Darwin’s natural selection.Now it is true that man is a passive creature who is at his best when he has achallenge to respond to. But what is so important about him is precisely thatamazing ability to respond to challenges. What distinguishes him from all otheranimals is the determination and willpower and imagination that he brings tochallenges. This is the real secret of his evolution.Palaeoanthropologists have overlooked one obvious explanation for theevolutionary surge: sex. Sexually speaking, the major difference between humanbeings and animals is that human females are sexually receptive all the yearround. The female ape is receptive to the male only one week in the month.At some point in history, the human female ceased to go ‘on heat’ for a few daysa month, and became receptive to the male at any time. The likeliest explanationis that when the hunters were away from the tribe for weeks—or perhaps wholesummers2 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark13]—at a time, they expected their sexualreward when they returned, whether the female was receptive or not. The femaleswho had no objection bred more of their kind, while the females who objectedgradually died out by natural selection.At some point in their evolution, human females began to develop more pronouncedsexual characteristics: full lips, large breasts, rounded buttocks and thighs.The genitals of the female chimpanzee swell up and become bright pink when sheis in season; it may be that these characteristics were transferred to thefemale mouth. Robert Ardrey remarked, ‘Sex is a sideshow in the world ofanimals’, but in the human world, it began to play an increasingly importantrole when women became permanently receptive, and developed more pronouncedsexual characteristics. Thinner fur, and face-to-face contact during mating,made sex altogether more sensuous.At this point in evolution, the males would have had a strong motive for beingcompetitive. The presence of unattached females introduced a new excitement.While the hunters were away, skinny girls suddenly blossomed into nubileadolescents. In earlier tribal groups, the sole purpose of the hunter was tokill game. Now the mightiest hunter could take his pick of the most attractivefemales. So there was suddenly a powerful motivation for becoming a greathunter—the rewards of sex.There is, of course, no proof whatever that the ‘brain explosion’ was connectedto the sexual changes that took place in woman. Yet in the absence of any otherconvincing hypothesis, it seems highly plausible. We only have to think of theenormous part that sexual romanticism has played in the history of civilisationto realise that it has always been one of the most powerful of humanmotivations—Antony and Cleopatra, Dante and Beatrice, Abélard and Héloïse,Lancelot and Guinevere, Romeo and Juliet, Faust and Gretchen, all exercise thesame fascination for us that they did for our great-great-grandfathers.Psychologically speaking, sexual romanticism is still the most single powerfulforce in the lives of human beings. Goethe may have been speaking soundbiological sense when he wrote, ‘Eternal Woman draws us upward’.Again, the obvious question is: what difference does it make—whether man becamemore ‘human’ through sex, or language, on through some genetic accidentassociated with tektites?And this time the answer must be: a great deal. It reminds us that a man drivenby a desire to possess a certain female is a highly purposive individual. Wehave already noted that evolution tends to mark time when individuals have noreason to evolve. The same applies to individuals; they may be talented andintelligent, and yet waste their lives because they somehow lack the motivationto make use of these faculties. The best piece of luck that can befall anyindividual is to have a strong sense of purpose.It may or may not be true that Homo sapiens evolved out of a kind of sexualromanticism. But the possibility serves to draw our attention to a notion ofcentral importance: that since the evolution of Homo sapiens has been a mentalevolution (as the word sapiens implies), perhaps we should be seeking the reasonfor that evolution in the realm of motivation and purpose rather than the realmof natural selection and accident. Perhaps we should be asking: what sense ofpurpose could have transformed Homo sapiens into Homo sapiens sapiens?"},{"pageContent":"8 MORE FORBIDDEN ARCHAEOLOGYThere is another force that distinguishes human beings from animals: religion.For some odd reason that no one has been able to explain, man has always been areligious animal. The sceptics of the eighteenth century tried to explain itaway as mere superstition: man was afraid of natural forces, so he personalisedthe thunder and lightning as gods, and prayed to them. But this fails to explainwhy our ancestors during the Riss Ice Age, over 200,000 years ago, wanted tomake perfectly round spheres, when there was no obvious practical use for them.The only obvious explanation seems to be that they are religious objects, somekind of sun disc. And Homo erectus—or whoever made them—certainly had no need tobe afraid of the sun.Again, certain flint tools dating from the Riss Ice Age have been created withan elaborate craftsmanship that raises them to the level of works ofart—certainly far beyond any practical demands. At Boxgrove, in the Cotswolds,similar tools date back half a million years. This suggests either that thetoolmakers took an artistic pride in their craft—and found in it a means of whatthe psychologist Abraham Maslow calls ‘self-actualisation’—or that the toolswere ritual objects, associated with religious sacrifice, and possibly ritualcannibalism. In either case, we again have clear evidence that man had developedfar beyond the ape stage, even when he continued to look much like an ape.Now the religious impulse is based upon the feeling that there is hidden meaningin the world. Dumb animals take the universe for granted; but intelligenceinvolves a sense of mystery, and seeks answers where stupidity cannot evenperceive questions. Mountains or giant trees become gods; so do thunder andlightning; so do the sun and the moon and the stars.But why did man develop this sense of mystery, of hidden significances? We haveseen that the rationalist explanation—that it is based on fear—is inadequate.When an animal looks at a magnificent dawn or sunset, it perceives it merely asa natural phenomenon. When a man looks at a magnificent dawn or sunset, heperceives it as beautiful; it arouses a certain response in him, like the smellof cooking. But the response to cooking is due to physical hunger. What kind ofhunger is aroused by a sunset? If we could answer that question, we would haveanswered the question of why man is a religious animal.But at least we can make a beginning. When Émile Cartailhac saw engravings inthe Laugerie-Basse cave at Les Eyzies, he recognised immediately that ‘here issomething other than a proof of a marvellous artistic disposition; there areunknown motives and aims at work...’ He discounted the notion that Cro-Magnonman made paintings because he had leisure, pointing out that the South SeaIslanders have plenty of leisure but hardly ever made rock paintings. On theother hand, Bushmen scraping a mere subsistence produced an abundance of rockart.It was the Aborigines of Australia and the American Indians who finally providedthe answer: the drawings served magical purposes. They were intended toestablish a connection between the hunter and his prey. The anthropologist IvarLissner explains it in Man, God and Magic: ‘An animal is put under a spellthrough the medium of its effigy, and the soul of the living beast suffers thesame fate as the soul of its second self... A hunter can also portray the deathof his game in ceremonial fashion by killing it in effigy, using certain veryancient rituals...’So we have one more proof that ancient man was a superstitious animal. But howis it that he was such a stupid animal that he failed to noticed that his magicdid not work— that when the tribal shaman had performed some elaborate ceremonyto lure bison or reindeer into the hunters’ ambush, the animals simply failed toput in an appearance?In other words, if the magic was ineffective, why was it not dropped within afew generations?Sceptics will reply that prayer is probably ineffective, yet people go onpraying. But this is an entirely different case. Prayers seem to be answeredoften enough to encourage more prayer; sceptics claim it is coincidence orwishful thinking, and there is no obvious way to decide who is right. But atribal shaman—like those depicted in so many caves in the Dordogne—performs along and elaborate ritual the night before the hunt, and its aim is to drawanimals to a particular spot. If it failed to work again and again, the hunterswould soon realise it was a waste of time.In fact, there is interesting evidence that, for some odd reason, it does seemto work.It is a striking fact that shamans all over the world, in totally unconnectedcultures, have the same basic beliefs and the same basic methods.Joseph Campbell remarks in the Primitive Mythology volume of his The Masks ofGod, published in 1959, of the Ona tribe of Tierra del Fuego and the NagajnekIndians of Alaska: ‘Drawn ... from the two most primitive hunting communities onearth, at opposite poles of the world, out of touch, certainly for millenniums,with any common point of traditional origin... the two groups have neverthelessthe same notion of the role and character of the shaman...’He cites an example of shamanic magic—observed by a western anthropologist, E.Lucas Bridges—which at first sounds disappointingly like a conjuring trick. Inthe snow, in bright moonlight, the Ona shaman Houshken chants for a quarter ofan hour before he puts his hands to his mouth and brings out a strip of guanacahide, about the size of a leather bootlace. Then he slowly draws his hands apartuntil it is four feet long. Then an end is handed to his brother, who steps backuntil the four feet has become eight feet. Then Houshken takes it back, puts hishand to his mouth, and swallows it. ‘Even an ostrich could not have swallowedthose eight feet of hide with one gulp without visible effort.’ Houshken has notflicked the hide up his sleeve for he is naked. After this, he brings from hismouth a quantity of something that looks like semi-transparent dough which isapparently alive, and revolving at great speed. Then, as he draws his handsfurther apart, the ‘dough’ simply disappears. Again, it sounds like sleight ofhand until we recall that the shaman is naked.A book called Wizard of the Upper Amazon is perhaps the clearest and mostdetailed account in the literature of anthropology of the training anddevelopment of a shaman. In this work, which has become a classic in its field,the explorer F. Bruce Lamb acts as amanuensis for a Peruvian youth named ManuelCordova, who was kidnapped by the Amahuaca Indians of Brazil in 1902. Cordovaspent seven years among the Indians, and records their way of life in detail.And since Cordova eventually became chief of the tribe, it also enables us tobegin to understand what must have been involved in being a palaeolithicshaman-chieftain. In order to grasp it fully, it is necessary to read the wholebook, which conveys the remarkable sense of unity that exists in a primitivetribe, in which every member is, in a sense, a part of an organism. But thefollowing brief account will at least make it clear why ‘magic’ seems to play aninevitable part in the lives of hunters who live in close contact with nature.One of the most remarkable chapters of Wizard of the Upper Amazon describes howthe old chief, Xumu, prepared Cordova for ten days with a special diet, whichincluded drinks that produced vomiting, diarrhoea and accelerated heartbeat.Then, with other members of the tribe, he was given a 'vision extract’, whichhad the effect of flooding him with strange sensations, colours, and visions ofanimals and other natural forms. It took many of these sessions before he couldcontrol the chaos released by the drug—which was the aim. Finally, the Indianswent one night into the depth of the forest, and spent hours gathering vines andleaves. These were pounded and mashed, then placed with elaborate ritual(involving chants) into the earthenware cooking pot. The preparation continuedfor three days, and then the green extract was poured into small pots.A hunter who was having bad luck came to the tribal chief and described a seriesof mishaps that had led to his family being half starved. The chief told him toreturn the following night for the ‘vision extract’ (honi xuma) ceremony.This took place in a large group. Soon after drinking the extract, colouredvisions began, which were shared by all. The ‘boa chant’ brought a giant boaconstrictor, which glided through the clearing, followed by other snakes, thenby a long parade of birds, including a giant eagle, which spread its wings infront of them, flashed its yellow eyes, and snapped its beak. After that camemany animals—Cordova explains that he can no longer recall much about it, ‘sincethe knowledge did not originate in my consciousness or experience’. Thiscontinued all night.The next day, the ‘unlucky’ hunter was asked by the chief, Xumu, if he could nowdominate the spirits of the forest. He replied that his understanding wasrenewed, and that the forest would now provide for all his needs.Later Cordova went on a hunt. The day before, there were elaborate pre-huntrituals, with potions to drink, herbal baths, and the exposure of the body tovarious kinds of smoke, made by burning the hair of an animal and feathers of abird they would be hunting. In the midst of the final ceremony, an owl landed ona branch; the hunters danced around him, chanting a ritual and asking him todirect their arrows at, various animals or birds they named. Finally the owlflew away and everyone went to bed.Cordova describes the hunt that followed, and how he had to learn to recogniseall the signs of the forest—the odour of animals or snakes, the meaning of abroken twig or fallen leaf. And after they had killed wild pigs, the leaderdescribed to him their method for ensuring that the pigs always pass that way.The leader, usually an old sow, has to be shot, and her head buried in a deephole, facing opposite to the way the herd was travelling, with ritual chants tothe spirits of the forest. If this is done correctly, it ensures that the pigswill always pass over this spot in every circuit of their territory, and byobserving the habits of the pigs, hunters can always be lying in wait for themwhen they return.One night they heard a peculiar insect call. The hunters were instantly alert,and two of them slipped off into the forest. Hours later, they returned with aninsect wrapped in a leaf. They made a tiny cage for it, explaining that thepossession of a ‘wyetee tee’ would guarantee good hunting. The next day, thehunters hid in camouflaged tree huts around the clearing. Just as they hadforetold, the wyetee tee brought them such abundance of game that they had tobuild another smoking rack for smoking it.Cordova was himself eventually chosen by Xumu as his successor. This was notsimply because Cordova could fire a rifle, and had business enterprise enough toshow the tribe how to manufacture and sell rubber; it was because he possessedthe kind of sensitivity that would enable him to understand his fellows.During my training I became aware of subtle changes in my mental process andmodes of thought. I noticed a mental acceleration and a certain clairvoyance inanticipating events and reactions of the tribe. By focusing my attention on asingle individual I could divine his reactions and purposes, and anticipate whathe would do or what he planned to do... The old man said my power to anticipateand know future events would improve and grow, also that I would be able tolocate and identify objects from a great distance.In fact, Cordova had visions of his mother’s death, which—on his return tocivilisation—proved to have been accurate.The chief himself possessed this clairvoyant power. ‘We waited in the villagefor many days after the raiding party went out. Finally, the chief said theywould return the next day...’ And of course, Xumu was right.Throughout the book it becomes very clear that much of the ‘magic’ of theIndians is a kind of telepathy. When Cordova is taken into the forest by Xumufor a magical initiation, he is in no doubt that they are in telepathic contact.‘The chief spoke in a low, pleasant tone, “Visions begin.” He had completelycaptured my attention with these words of magic. I instantly felt a melting awayof any barrier between us; we were as one.’Then the chief conjures up visions that are shared by Cordova. The scepticalexplanation—that the chief is merely using suggestion—fails to fit the facts.The chief says: ‘Let us start with the birds’, and an incredibly detailed imageof a bird appears; ‘Never had I perceived visual images in such detail before...The chief then brought a female, and the male went through his mating dance. Iheard all of the songs, calls and other sounds. Their variety was beyondanything I had known.’There is later another lengthy description of visions shared by the whole tribe.After drinking the ‘vision extract’, a chant causes a procession of animals,including a huge jaguar. ‘This tremendous animal shuffled along with the headhanging down, mouth open and tongue lolling out. Hideous, large teeth filled theopen mouth. An instant change of demeanour to vicious alertness caused a tremorto pass through the circle of phantom-viewers.’In fact, Cordova realised that he had conjured up this jaguar, which he had oncemet on a jungle path, and succeeded in ‘staring down’. The other members of thetribe also recognised this, with the result that Cordova was nicknamed ‘jaguar’.Cordova goes on to speak about scenes of combat with enemy tribes, and with theinvading rubber-cutters who had driven the Amahuaca to seek new territory. Hesees visions of a village in flames, and the chief killing a rubber planter. The‘show’ ends with scenes in their new village. In this visionary session, it isobvious that everyone is seeing the same thing, as if they are sitting in acinema watching a film; but the film is created by their own minds. In hisintroduction to Wizard of the Upper Amazon, Harvard research fellow Andrew Weilcomments:‘Evidently, these Indians experience the collective unconscious as an immediatereality, not just as an intellectual construct.’Later in the book, Cordova describes how, when the old chief dies, he takes hisplace. He discovers that, during the drug-induced visions, he is able to controlwhat is seen by means of chants.No matter how involved or strange the visions, they obeyed my wishes as Iexpressed them in song. Once the men realised that I had obtained dominationover the visions, they all considered my position infinitely superior to theirs.I developed at the same time a more acute awareness of my surroundings and ofthe people about me—a sense of clairvoyance that enabled me to anticipate anydifficult situation that might develop...He also inherits the old chief’s power of making use of his dreams. ‘One nightat the boa camp I had visions in my sleep of trouble back at Xanada...’ On theirreturn, he learned that their territory was being invaded by a neighbouringtribe.When Cordova eventually returned to civilisation, the training of the oldchieftain stayed with him. The visions of his mother’s death—in a fluepidemic—proved to be accurate. And, ‘strange as it may seem to you, at leasttwo other important events in my life I have foreseen in advance. Explain it howyou will, I feel that it came from Xumu’s training.’A sceptic would object that all this proves nothing. Cordova had merely takenpart in rituals that the Indians believed would bring results, and when resultscame, they believed that their magic had been responsible. Yet this is simplyquite contrary to the impression conveyed by Wizard of the Upper Amazon, inwhich there can be no doubt, as Andrew Weil says, that we are speaking about the‘collective unconscious’ as an everyday reality.The following example of shamanistic power cannot be explained in terms of somekind of mass self-deception.Sir Arthur Francis Grimble was a British colonial administrator who became landcommissioner in the Gilbert Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, in 1914. He was todescribe his five years there in a delightful autobiography called Pattern ofIslands (1952), which deservedly became a bestseller. The book is mainlyconcerned with his everyday life, and is told in an appropriately matter-of-facttone. Yet in one chapter he describes an event so bizarre that it seems to defyany normal explanation.An old chieftain named Kitiona criticised Grimble’s skinniness, and recommendedhim to eat porpoise meat. On enquiring how he might obtain porpoise meat,Grimble was told that Kitiona’s first cousin, who lived in Kuma village, was ahereditary porpoise caller.Now Grimble had heard of porpoise calling—the ability of certain shamans tocause porpoises to come ashore by some form of magic; he classified it with theIndian rope trick. He enquired how it was done, and was told that it depended onbeing able to dream a certain dream. If the porpoise caller could dream thisdream, his spirit would leave his body, and could visit the porpoise-people andinvite them to come and feast and dance in Kuma village. When the porpoisesreached the harbour, the spirit of the dreamer would rush back to his body andhe would alert the tribe...Grimble expressed interest, and Kitiona promised to send his canoe for him whenhis cousin was ready.In due course the canoe arrived, and Grimble was taken to Kuma. He arrived hot,sweaty and irritable, and was met by a fat, friendly man who explained he wasthe porpoise caller.The porpoise caller disappeared into a hut screened with newly-plaited coconutleaves. ‘I go on my journey,’ he said as he took his leave. Grimble wasinstalled in his house next door.Four o’clock came—the hour at which the magician had promised results; nothinghappened. Yet women were plaiting garlands, as if for a feast, and friends andrelations were arriving from neighbouring villages. In spite of the festiveatmosphere, it was hot and oppressive.My faith was beginning to sag under the strain when a strangled howl burst fromthe dreamer’s hut. I jumped round to see his cumbrous body come hurtling headfirst through the torn screens. He sprawled on his face, struggled up, andstaggered into the open, a slobber of saliva shining on his chin. He stood awhile clawing at the air and whining on a queer high note like a puppy’s. Thenwords came gulping out of him: ‘Teirake! Teirake! (Arise! Arise!) ... They come,they come! ... Let us go down and greet them.’ He started at a lumbering pacedown the beach.A roar went up from the village, ‘They come, they come!’ I found myself rushinghelter-skelter with a thousand others into the shallows, bawling at the top ofmy voice that our friends from the west were coming. I ran behind the dreamer;the rest converged on him from north and south. We strung ourselves out, lineabreast, as we stormed through the shallows...I had just dipped my head to cool it when a man near me yelped and stoodpointing; others took up his cry, but I could make out nothing for myself atfirst in the splintering glare of the sun on the water. When at last I did seethem, everyone was screaming hard; they were pretty near by then, gambollingtowards us at a fine clip. When they came to the edge of the blue water by thereef, they slackened speed, spread themselves out and started cruising back andforth in front of our line. Then suddenly, there was no more of them.In the strained silence that followed, I thought they were gone. Thedisappointment was so sharp, I did not stop to think that, even so, I had seen avery strange thing. I was in the act of touching the dreamer’s shoulder to takemy leave when he turned his still face to me: ‘The king out of the west comes tomeet me,’ he murmured, pointing downwards. My eyes followed his hand. There, notten yards away, was the great shape of a porpoise poised like a glimmeringshadow in the glass-green water. Behind it there followed a whole dusky flotillaof them.They were moving towards us in extended order with spaces of two or three yardsbetween them, as far as my eye could reach. So slowly they came, they seemed tobe hung in a trance. Their leader drifted in hard by the dreamer’s legs. Heturned without a word to walk beside it as it idled towards the shadows. Ifollowed a foot or two behind its almost motionless tail. I saw other groups toright and left of us turn shoreward one by one, arms lifted, faces bent upon thewater.A babble of quiet talk sprang up; I dropped behind to take in the whole scene.The villagers were welcoming their guests ashore with crooning words. Only menwere walking beside them; the women and children followed in their wake,clapping their hands softly in the rhythms of a dance. As we approached theemerald shallows, the keels of the creatures began to take the sand; theyflapped gently as if asking for help. The men leaned down to throw their armsaround the great barrels and ease them over the ridges. They showed no leastsign of alarm. It was as if their single wish was to get to the beach.When the water stood only thigh deep, the dreamer flung his arms high andcalled. Men from either flank came crowding in to surround the visitors, ten ormore to each beast. Then, ‘Lift!’ shouted the dreamer, and the ponderous blackshapes were halfdragged, half-carried, unresisting, to the lip of the tide.There they settled down, those beautiful, dignified shapes, utterly at peace,while all hell broke loose around them. Men, women and children, leaping andposturing with shrieks that tore the sky, stripped off their garlands and flungthem around the still bodies, in a sudden dreadful fury of boastfulness andderision. My mind still shrinks from that last scene—the raving humans, thebeasts so triumphantly at rest.We left them garlanded where they lay, and returned to our houses. Later, whenthe falling tide had stranded them high and dry, men went down with knives tocut them up. There was feasting and dancing in Kuma that night. A chief’sportion of the meat was set aside for me. I was expected to have it cured, as adiet for my thinness. It was duly salted, but I could not bring myself to eatit...It seems clear that there is no great difference between the ‘magic’ learned byCordova in the Upper Amazon and the magic of the porpoise callers of the SouthPacific. Both seem to be based on some peculiar telepathic ability—or what Weilcalls the collective unconscious.It may seem that, in venturing into this realm of primitive ‘magic’, we haveleft all common sense behind. Yet, surprisingly, there is a certain amount ofscientific backing for the suggestion that dreaming can induce ‘paranormal’powers—or rather, tap powers that we all possess.In the early 1980s, Dr Andreas Mavromatis, of London’s Brunei University, led agroup of students in exploring ‘hypnagogic states’, the states of consciousnessbetween sleeping and waking.In a book called Mental Radio (1930), the American novelist Upton Sinclairdiscussed the telepathic abilities of his wife May—she had been telepathic eversince childhood. May Sinclair explained that, in order to achieve a telepathicstate of mind, she had first of all to place herself in a state ofconcentration—not concentration on anything, but simply a high state ofalertness. Then she had to induce deep relaxation, until she was hovering on theverge of sleep. Once she was in this state, she became capable of telepathy.Mavromatis taught himself to do the same thing—to induce states that weresimultaneously concentrated and deeply relaxed. What happens in these states—aseveryone knows (for we have all experienced them on the verge of falling asleepor waking up)—is that we see certain images or situations with extreme clarity.In a book called Beyond the Occult, I described my own experience:I myself achieved it by accident after reading Mavromatis’s book Hypnogogia.Towards dawn I half woke up, still drifting in a pleasantly sleepy condition,and found myself looking at a mountain landscape inside my head. I was aware ofbeing awake and of lying in bed, but also of looking at the mountains and thewhite-coloured landscape, exactly as if watching something on a televisionscreen. Soon after this I drifted off to sleep again. The most interesting partof the experience was the sense of looking at the scenery, being able to focusit and shift my attention, exactly as when I was awake.One day, when Mavromatis was half-dozing in a circle of students, listening asone of them ‘psychometrised’ some object he was holding in his hand (trying to‘sense’ its history) he began to ‘see’ the scenes the student was describing. Hethen began to alter his hypnagogic visions—an ability he had acquired bypractice—and discovered that the student was beginning to describe his alteredvisions.Now convinced that hypnagogic states encourage telepathy, he tried askingstudents to ‘pick up’ scenes that he envisaged, and found that they were oftenable to do this. He concludes that ‘some seemingly “irrelevant” hypnogogicimages might... be meaningful phenomena belonging to another mind’. In otherwords, that T. S. Eliot might be wrong in thinking that ‘we each think of thekey, each in his prison’. Perhaps, as Blake suggested, man can pass out of hisinner prison ‘what time he will’.Telepathy is, in fact, perhaps the best authenticated of ‘paranormal’ faculties;the evidence for it is generally agreed, by those in paranormal research, to beoverwhelming. Mavromatis’s book goes a step further, and suggests a link betweentelepathy and dream states.It would seem, then, that what Mavromatis has duplicated under controlconditions with his students is what the Amahuaca Indians were able to do, usingmind-altering drugs, under the guidance of their shaman: to achieve ‘groupconsciousness’.It becomes possible to envisage what took place when the porpoise caller wentinto his hut. Like Mavromatis, he had taught himself the art of controlleddreaming—of sinking into a hypnagogic trance which he is able to control. Wehave to suppose that he was then able to direct his dreams to the realm of theporpoises, and communicate direct with them. (Experiments with porpoises suggestthat they are highly telepathic.) Somehow, the porpoises were ‘hypnotised’ intoswimming ashore and allowing themselves to be beached.In Man, God and Magic, Ivar Lissner points out that about 20,000 years ago, onthe threshold between the Aurignacian and Magdalenian, portrayals and statuettesof the human figure suddenly ceased. ‘It seems obvious that artists no longerdared to portray the human form in effigy.’ What he is suggesting is clear. Ourancestors firmly believed that hunting magic—with the use of portrayals of theprey—was effective and deadly, and that on no account should humans beportrayed.Let us return once again to the question: why has man evolved so swiftly in thepast half-million years—and particularly in the past 50,000—when his evolutionwas virtually stagnant for millions of years before that?In Darwinian terms, there is no obvious answer. Nothing, as far as we know,‘happened’ that suddenly forced man to adapt by developing increasedintelligence.What the present chapter is suggesting is that the answer may not be obviously‘Darwinian’. Darwin himself was not a rigid Darwinian; he accepted Lamarck’sview that creatures can evolve by wanting to. But he did not accept that thiswas the major mechanism of evolution. More recently, Sir Julian Huxley—who wascertainly a Darwinian—suggested that, in his present stage, man has become the‘managing director of evolution’—that is to say, he now has the intelligence totake charge of his own evolution.1 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark14]What Huxley is suggesting is that man is now in the position to recognise whatchanges are needed—to the environment, to the human species—and is prepared toengineer these changes. But he feels that this is a fairly recent development.Yet what Huxley is also recognising is man’s capacity to be inspired by a senseof purpose. He actually takes pleasure in change. It is truethat he tends to remain static when he can see no reason for change. I live in asmall village in Cornwall, where life has been much the same for centuries. Ifan Elizabethan fisherman was transported to our village in the 1990s, he wouldcertainly be surprised at the television aerials and the asphalt road, butotherwise he would feel perfectly at home. And if society itself had notchanged—through inventions like the steam engine and radio—it is perfectlyconceivable that our village would not have changed at all since 1595, Theaverage man takes life as he finds it and adapts to it. This is whyAustralopithecus remained Australopithecus for two million years or more.At the same time, however, what man loves most of all is change. He will workdeterminedly to move from a one-room cottage to a semidetached house, toexchange his bicycle for a motor car, his radio for a television. He merelyneeds to be shown the possibility. He only remains static as long as he sees nopossibility of change.Now I would suggest that religion itself introduces the possibility of change.Instead of taking trees and mountains and lakes for granted, he saw them as theabode of gods or nature spirits—and, moreover, spirits who could be appeased ifhe approached them in the right way. So when he sets out to hunt an animal, heno longer relies completely on his spear and stone axe; he also prays forsuccess, and perhaps performs certain rituals and makes certain offerings. Inthis sense, his attitude towards his own life has become active rather thanpassive. It is the beginning of a sense of control.In 1950, Dr Ralph Solecki, of the Smithsonian Institute, agreed to join anexpedition to Iraqi Kurdistan, to excavate caves where bones of Neanderthal manhad been found. In a book called Shanidar; The Humanity of Neanderthal Man(1971) he describes his finds in the Shanidar cave.Here he discovered skeletons of several Neanderthals who had died from aroof-fall, and been buried ritualistically. Ashes and food remains over thegraves suggested a funeral feast, while eight different types of pollen ofbrightly coloured wildflowers seemed to indicate that the flowers were woveninto a quilt to cover the dead, or into a shrub to form a screen. The skeletonof an old and disabled man who had obviously been unable to work for yearsrevealed that they cared for their elderly. These people clearly held some kindof religious beliefs.Again, in a cave at La Quina, in the Dordogne, no less than 76 perfect sphereswere recovered from among the tools. There was also a delicately worked flatdisc of flint, 20 centimetres in diameter, with no conceivable purpose—except asa sun disc.Neanderthal man buried his dead with a coating of the pigment called red ochre—ahabit Cro-Magnon man seems to have borrowed. In South Africa, many Neanderthalred ochre mines have been found, the oldest a hundred thousand years old. Fromone of the largest sites, a million kilos of ore had been removed; then the holehad been carefully filled in again, presumably to placate the earth spirits.All this explains Solecki’s subtitle, The Humanity of Neanderthal Man: thesecreatures may have had ape-like faces, but they were emphatically human. Andthey were clearly religious. Yet in no Neanderthal site in the world has therebeen found the slightest trace of cave art. It seems odd that Neanderthal manpossessed red ochre, and even ‘crayons’ of the black manganese dioxide (whichwere found at Pech-de-l’Aze), yet never used them to make an image on a flatsurface. It would seem that Neanderthal man may have been religious, but—as faras we know—he did not practise ‘magic’, like the Cro-Magnons who supplanted him.Is it conceivable that religion and ‘magic’ may provide the clues to why mandeveloped so quickly over the past half-million years? It is true that we haveno idea of what development may have taken place between the ‘cannibalised’skulls of Peking man half a million years ago, and the Neanderthal ritual buriala hundred thousand years ago—unless the Riss Ice Age tools (already referred to)were used for ritual purposes. But the Neanderthal ochre mines reveal that someimportant development took place, and that that development was connected toreligion and burial. (Did they, as Stan Gooch has suggested, revere red ochrebecause it was the colour of blood?)And then we find Cro-Magnon man practising hunting magic, which must have givenhim a new sense of control over nature, as well as over his own life. He maywell have regarded his shamans as gods, as primitive man of a later age (forexample, at Great Zimbabwe in Africa and Angkor in Cambodia) regarded hispriest-kings as gods. Magic was primitive man’s science, since it fulfilled thebasic function of science, of offering answers to basic questions. He was nolonger a passive animal, a victim of nature. He was trying to understand, andwhere important questions were concerned, he felt he did understand.Another basic point must be emphasised. Neanderthal man’s burial rituals make itclear that he believed in life after death. And all shamans, from Iceland toJapan, see themselves as intermediaries between this world and the world ofspirits. All over the world, shamans have declared that, in passing through therituals and ordeals that qualified them as shamans, they entered the spiritworld and talked with the dead. Shamans believe that their power comes fromspirits and from the dead.The importance of this observation lies in the fact that the priest-shaman feelsthat he possesses an understanding of both heaven and earth—a claim that even amodern cosmologist would be reluctant to make. He felt himself in a position ofgod-like knowledge, and the rest of the tribe certainly endorsed this view.Which suggests that 40,000 years ago, perhaps even 100,000 years ago, man hadachieved a peculiarly ‘modern’ state of mind.We know that this state of mind existed in ancient Egypt and ancient Sumer—infact, every early civilisation we know about was a theocracy. If Hapgood iscorrect in believing that a worldwide maritime civilisation existed in 7000 BC,then it certainly shared the same world view. We have already seen that theEgyptians regarded their kingdom as an exact reflection of the kingdom of theheavens. And if Schwaller de Lubicz and Robert Bauval are correct in believingthat the Sphinx was built by survivors of another civilisation around 10,500 BC,then this civilisation certainly held the same view about the intimaterelationship between heaven and earth, the gods and man. And so, if ProfessorArthur Posnansky is right, did the ancient Incas who built Tiahuanaco at aboutthe same time.When did this worldwide theocratic vision come to an end? It had certainlyvanished by the time of Socrates and Plato. In a book called The Origin ofConsciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind (1976) Princetonpsychologist Julian Jaynes argues that the watershed occurred as recently as1250 BC.Jaynes’s starting point is the relatively new science of split-brainphysiology—which, since this is of such central importance to this book, must bebriefly explained.The brain consists of two halves, which are virtually mirror-images of oneanother. But the functions of these two hemispheres are by no means identical.This applies particularly to the ‘top layer’ of the human brain, the cerebralcortex, which has developed most in the past half-million years.Even in the nineteenth century, it had been recognised that the two halves ofour brains have different functions. The speech function resides in the lefthalf of the brain, and doctors observed that people who had received damage tothe left-brain became inarticulate. The right side of the brain was obviouslyconnected with recognition of shapes and patterns, so that an artist who hadright-brain damage would lose all artistic talent. One man could not even draw aclover leaf; he put the three leaves of the clover side by side, on the samelevel.Yet an artist with left-brain damage only became inarticulate; he was still asgood an artist as ever. And an orator with right-brain damage could sound aseloquent as ever, even though he could not draw a clover leaf.The left brain is also involved in logic and reason—for example, adding up alaundry list or doing a crossword puzzle. The right is involved in suchactivities as musical appreciation or recognising faces. In short, you could saythat the left is a scientist and the right is an artist.One of the odd facts of human physiology is that the left side of the body iscontrolled by the right side of the brain, and vice-versa. No one quite knowswhy this is, except that it probably makes for greater integration. If the leftbrain controlled the left side and the right brain the right side, there mightbe ‘frontier disputes’; as it is, each has a foot firmly in the other’sterritory.If you removed the top of your head, the upper part of your brain—the ‘cerebralhemispheres’—would look like a walnut with a kind of bridge connecting the twohalves. This bridge is a knot of nerves called the corpus callosum, orcommissure. But doctors learned that there are some freaks who possess nocommissure yet seem to function perfectly well. This led them to wonder if theycould prevent epileptic attacks by severing the commissure. They tried it onepileptic patients and it seemed to work—the fits were greatly reduced, and thepatient seemed to be unharmed. This led the doctors to wonder what thecommissure was for. Someone suggested it might be for transmitting epilepticseizures; another suggested it might be to stop the brain sagging in the middle.In the 1950s, experiments in America began to shed a flood of light on theproblem. Someone noticed that if a ‘split-brain’ patient knocked against a tablewith his left side, he didn’t seem to notice. It began to emerge that thesplit-brain operation had the effect of preventing one half of the brain fromlearning what the other half knew. If a split-brain cat was taught some trickwith one eye covered, then asked to do it with the other eye covered, it wasbaffled. It became clear that we literally have two brains.Moreover, if a split-brain patient was shown an apple with the left eye and anorange with the right, then asked what he had just seen, he would reply:‘Orange’. Asked to write what he had just seen with his left hand, he wouldreply ‘Apple’. A split-brain female patient who was shown an indecent picturewith her right brain blushed; asked why she was blushing, she repliedtruthfully: ‘I don’t know.’ The person who was doing the blushing was the onewho lived in the right half of her brain. She lived in the left half.This is true of all of us, though in left-handers, the brain hemispheres are theother way round and so the situation reversed. The person (a right-hander) youcall yourself lives in the left half—the half that ‘copes’ with the real world.The person who lives in the right is a stranger.It might be objected that you and I are not split-brain patients. That makes nodifference. Mozart once remarked that tunes were always walking into his headfully fledged, and all he had to do was to write them down. Where did they comefrom? Obviously, the right half of his brain, the ‘artist’. Where did they goto? The left half of his brain—where Mozart lived. In other words, Mozart was asplit-brain patient. And if Mozart was, then so are the rest of us. The personwe call ‘I’ is the scientist. The ‘artist’ lives in the shadows, and we arescarcely aware of his existence, except in moods of deep relaxation, or of‘inspiration’.Jaynes’s interest in the subject began when he experienced an auditoryhallucination. Lying on a couch, brooding on a problem until he was mentallyexhausted, he suddenly heard a voice from above his head say: ‘Include theknower in the known.’ Concerned about his sanity, Jaynes began researchinghallucinations and, to his relief, discovered that about ten per cent of peoplehave had them.Jaynes then noticed that in a great deal of ancient literature—the Epic ofGilgamesh, the Bible, the Iliad—the heroes are always hearing voices—the voicesof the gods. He also noted that these early heroes were completely lacking inwhat we would call an ‘inner self’. ‘We cannot approach these heroes byinventing mind-spaces behind their fierce eyes as we do with each other. Iliadicman did not have subjectivity as we do; he had no awareness of his awareness ofthe world, no internal mind-space to speculate upon.’Jaynes is suggesting that what we call ‘subjectivity’—the ability to look insideyourself and say: ‘Now what do I think about this?’—did not exist before about1250 BC. The minds of these early people were, he thinks, ‘bicameral’—dividedinto two compartments. And when a primitive man was worried about what to donext, he heard a voice speaking to him, just as Jaynes did as he was lying onhis couch. He thought it was the voice of a god (or of his chieftain, whom heregarded as a god). In fact, it came from his right brain.According to Jaynes, self-awareness began to develop slowly after about 3000 BC,due to the invention of writing, which created a new kind of complexity. Andduring the great wars which convulsed the Middle East and Mediterranean in thesecond millennium BC, the old childlike mentality could no longer cope, andhuman beings were forced to acquire a new ruthlessness and efficiency in orderto survive. ‘Overrun by some invader, and seeing his wife raped, a man whoobeyed his voices would, of course, immediately strike out, and thus probably bekilled.’ The man who survived would need the ability to reflect, and dissimulatehis feelings.According to Jaynes, the first sign of this ‘change of mind’ came inMesopotamia. The Assyrian tyrant Tukulti-Ninurti had a stone altar built inabout 1230 BC, which shows the king kneeling before the empty throne of the god,while in earlier carvings the king would be seen talking to the god. Now he isalone—trapped in his left brain. The god has vanished.A cuneiform text of the period contains the lines:One who has no god, as he walks along the streetHeadache envelops him like a garment.It is speaking of stress, nervous tension, loss of contact with the right brain,with its sense of ‘feeling at home in the world’. We seem to be observing thebirth of ‘alienated man’. And according to Jaynes, it is at this point thatcruelty entered history, and we see Assyrian carvings of men and women impaledand children beheaded.It is not necessary to agree with this whole thesis to recognise its importance.The main objection to it is that many animals have been shown to possessself-awareness. One experimenter anaesthetised various animals, painted theirfaces red, and left them facing a large mirror. Most animals showed no interestwhatever in their reflections, but chimpanzees and orang-utans were theexception—they inspected their faces with great interest, which would seem toindicate that they possess self-awareness. And if chimpanzees and orang-utanspossess self-awareness, it is difficult to imagine even the most primitivehumans entirely without it.Moreover, our recognition that modern man is somehow ‘separated from himself’would seem to imply that it is we who are ‘bicameral’, with the mind dividedinto two compartments, while primitive man was ‘unicameral’—as most animalsprobably are.Yet in spite of these objections, it is obvious that Jaynes is correct insuggesting that some basic change came over the human race at a certain point inhistory, and that after that point, man became trapped in a narrower form ofconsciousness. Yet we compensated for the loss by learning to use reason to fargreater effect, and our technological civilisation is the end product.These insights bring us back to the mainstream argument of this book.Schwaller de Lubicz was totally convinced that there is a fundamental differencebetween the Egyptian mentality and that of modern man—he returns to itrepeatedly in book after book.One of the most important forms of this difference can be seen in thehieroglyphic. Words, says Schwaller, fix their meaning. If you read the word‘dog’, it evokes a vague, abstract notion of ‘dogginess’. But if you look at apicture of a dog—even a simple drawing—it is far more alive.Everyone, as a child, has tried out those red and green goggles that causepictures to turn three-dimensional. You look at the photograph with normal eyes,and it looks blurry, with red and green patches superimposed on one another.Then you pick up a cardboard pair of spectacles, with one eye made of redcellophane and one of green, and the photograph ceases to be blurry, and leapsinto three dimensions. According to Schwaller, our words are like the blurryphotograph. The hieroglyphic is an image that leaps into life. ‘Eachhieroglyphic’, says Schwaller, ‘can have an arrested, conventional meaning forcommon usage, but it includes (1) all the ideas that can be connected to it, and(2) the possibility of personal comprehension.’In a chapter called ‘Experimental Mysticism’ in A New Model of the Universe,Gurdjieff’s disciple Ouspensky describes how he used some unspecified method(probably nitrous oxide) to achieve ‘mystical’ consciousness. One of thecharacteristics of this state of mind was that every single word, every singlething, reminded him of dozens of other words and things. When he looked at anashtray, it released such a flood of meanings and associations—about copper,copper-mining, tobacco, smoking, and so on—that he wrote on a piece of paper:‘One could go mad from one ashtray.’Similarly, Schwaller says: ‘Thus the hieroglyphics are really not metaphors.They express directly what they want to say, but the meaning remains asprofound, as complex as the teaching of an object might be (chair, flower,vulture), if all the meanings that can be attached to it were to be considered.But out of laziness or habit, we skirt this analogic thought process anddesignate the object by a word that expresses for us but a single congealedconcept.’In The Temple in Man he uses another image. If we say ‘walking man’, we envisagea walking man, but in a vague, abstract way. But if we see a picture of awalking man—even a hierogylphic—he becomes somehow real. And if the walking manis painted green, then he also evokes vegetation and growth. And althoughwalking and growing seem completely disconnected, we can feel the connection inthe picture of the green man.This power of the hieroglyphic to evoke a ‘reality’ inside us is what Schwallermeans by ‘the possibility of personal comprehension’. It rings a bell, so tospeak.He tries again, in the same book, in a chapter on the Egyptian mentality, toexplain himself. Our modern method of linking ideas and thoughts he calls‘mechanical’, like a lever attached rigidly to some gear. By contrast, theEgyptian mentality is ‘indirect’. A hieroglyphic evokes an idea, but it alsoevokes dozens of other connected ideas. And he tries to explain himself by asimple image. If we stare at a bright green spot, then close our eyes, we shallsee the complementary colour—red—inside our eyelids. The westerner would saythat the green is the reality, and the red some kind of illusion dependent onthat reality. But an ancient Egyptian would have felt that the red is thereality, because it is an inner vision.It is important not to misunderstand this. Schwaller is not saying that externalreality is an illusion. He is saying that symbols and hieroglyphics can evoke aricher, more complex reality inside us. Great music and poetry produce the sameeffect. Keats’s lines:The moving waters at their priest-like taskOf pure ablution round earth’s human shoressomehow evoke a rich complex of feelings, which is why Eliot said that truepoetry can communicate before it is understood. Ordinary perception merely showsus single things, deprived of their 'resonance’. A simple parallel would be abook, which is a solid object with a rectangular shape; this is its ‘externalreality’. But what is inside the book can take us on a magical journey. Thereality of the book is hidden, and for a person unable to read, it would merelybe a physical object.When we look at this in the light of what has been said above about the left andright brain, we can see immediately that a hieroglyphic is a picture, and istherefore grasped by the right brain. A word is a succession of letters, and isgrasped by the left brain.Is Schwaller saying simply that the Egyptians were ‘right brainers’ and we are‘left brainers’?He is, but there is far more to it than that. He is saying that the Egyptianspossessed a different kind of intelligence from modern man, an intelligence thatis equal, and in many ways superior. He calls this ‘innate intelligence’ or‘intelligence of the heart’. It sounds like the kind of doctrine preached by D.H. Lawrence or Henry Miller, and to some extent it is. But there is far moreimplied than either of them realised. In spite of their ‘intelligence of theheart’, both writers saw themselves essentially as modern men, so theircriticism of the twentieth century often sounds negative and destructive.Neither seems to be aware of the possibilities of a different way of seeing.One of these is obvious. If we think of what Manuel Cordova learned in theforest of the Amazon, we can see that it involved learning about certain‘powers’ that sound almost mythical—to begin with, the power to participate inthe ‘collective unconscious’ of the tribe. Observe that Cordova was able to seea procession of birds and animals, and that he saw them in far more precisedetail than in ordinary perception. The chieftain had somehow taught him to makeactive use of his right hemisphere, which in turn was providing far morerichness (more associations) than ordinary visual perception.It would be a mistake to think of telepathy as a ‘paranormal’ faculty. With aseries of experiments in the 1960s, Dr Zaboj V. Harvalik, a physicist at theUniversity of Missouri, placed it on a scientific basis. To begin with, Harvalikwas intrigued by dowsing—an ability that seems to be possessed by all primitivepeople. Observing that the dowsing rod—a forked twig, with the two prongs of thefork grasped in either hand—would always react to an electric current, he cameto suspect that dowsing is basically electrical. He drove two lengths of waterpipe vertically into the ground, 60 feet apart, and connected their ends to apowerful battery. As soon as the current was switched on, the dowsing rodreacted by twisting in his hands. He tried it on friends, and discovered thatthey could all dowse if the current was strong enough—say, 20 milli-amps. Afifth of them were able to detect currents as low as 2 milli-amps. All of themimproved steadily with practice.He also noted that people who seemed unable to dowse would suddenly ‘tune in’after drinking a glass of whisky; the whisky obviously relaxed them, preventing‘left brain’ interference.Harvalik discovered that a strip of aluminium foil wound round the head blocksall dowsing ability, again demonstrating that the phenomenon is basicallyelectrical (or magnetic).A German master dowser named de Boer was able to detect currents as low as athousandth of a milli-amp. He could even detect the signals of radio stations,turning around slowly until he was facing the direction of the station. Harvalikcould check his accuracy by tuning in a portable radio in that direction.Moreover, de Boer could select a named frequency to the exclusion ofothers—rather like our ability to ‘tune in’ to different conversations at aparty.When someone invented a magnetometer sensitive enough to detect brain waves,Harvalik wondered if a dowser could also pick them up. He would stand with hisback to a screen in his garden, with earplugs in his ears, and ask friends towalk towards him from the other side of the screen. His dowsing rod could pickup their presence when they were ten feet away. If he asked them to think‘exciting thoughts’—for example, about sex—this doubled to twenty feet.2[../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark15]So it would seem that dowsing is simply a faculty for detecting electricalsignals. But how does the dowsing rod detect them? It seems that some part ofthe body (Harvalik concluded that it was the adrenal glands) picks up thesignal, which is then passed on to the brain, which causes the muscles toconvulse. The striped muscles concerned are under the control of the rightbrain. Dowsing—like telepathy—is a right brain faculty.When we also recollect Grimble’s porpoise caller inviting the porpoises to afeast, it also seems clear that this form of ‘magic’ (involving telepathy) isalso a right brain faculty.If dowsing and telepathy can be explained scientifically, then it becomespossible to understand how the Stone Age shaman was able, by drawing bison ordeer—and so setting in train the process of ‘association’ described bySchwaller—somehow to influence their movements and ensure success for thehunters.All this places us in a position to begin constructing an ‘alternative history’.In a Time-Life book called Early Man, there is a kind of pull-out chart showingman’s evolution from the ape-like Dryopithecus and Ramapithecus, throughAustralopithecus and Homo erectus to modern man. The problem with such a chartis that it gives us the idea of some steady progression, by means of naturalselection and survival of the fittest, that led inevitably to Homo sapienssapiens.The objection to this picture is that it makes it all seem a little too |mechanical. This is why Cremo’s Forbidden Archaeology offers a timely reminderthat it is not the only view. By making the startling assertion thatanatomically modern man may have been around for millions of years, he at leastcauses us to question this mechanical view of evolution. (Again, it must beemphasised that the ‘mechanical’ view is not ‘Darwinian’; Darwin was neverdogmatic enough to claim that natural selection was the only mechanism ofevolution. It is only his neo-Darwinian followers who have hardened it into adogma.)Let us, then, begin formulating our alternative history by supposing that MaryLeakey may be correct in suggesting that a man who walked erect and looked‘human’ may have walked the earth at the time of Lucy and the First Family,three and a half million years ago. She also noted that she had studied a periodof half a million years in the Olduvai Gorge during which there was no change inthe tools. Man remained unchanged because he had no reason to evolve. Most ofhis energies were taken up merely staying alive.Then why did he start to evolve with such speed that the event is known as ‘thebrain explosion’?It is almost impossible for modern man to put himself in the position of acreature with no civilisation, no culture, nothing but the nature thatsurrounded him. Even the Amahuaco Indians described by Manuel Cordova lived inhuts and used spears and bows and arrows. But they can at least give us an ideaof what it must be like to live in daily and nightly contact with nature.Cordova’s Indians read every sign of the forest—every sight and sound—as we readthe morning paper. And our remote ancestors must have possessed the samecapacity in order to survive.We have to imagine them surrounded by unseen presences, some visible, someinvisible. And we have to picture them in closer contact with nature that we canbegin to conceive. Schwaller de Lubicz tries to convey some sense of theawareness of primitive man—although he is admittedly speaking of the ancientEgyptians: ‘... every living being is in contact with all the rhythms andharmonies of all the energies of his universe. The means of this contact is, ofcourse, the self-same energy contained by this particular living being. Nothingseparates this energetic state within an individual living being from the energyin which he is immersed...’In other words, Schwaller sees primitive man—and animals—immersed in a sea ofenergies like a fish in water. It is as if he is a part of that sea, a denserknot of energy than that which surrounds him and sustains him. Schwaller speaksof neters, an Egyptian word usually translated as ‘god’, but here meaningsomething closer to an individual energy vibration:...in every month of each season of the year, every hour of the day has itsNeter; because each one of these hours has its own character. It is known thatthe blue morning-glory blooms at sunrise and closes at midday like the lotusflower... certain fruits require the afternoon sun in order to ripen and tocolour... A young pepper plant, for example, leans towards the burning sun ofthe morning, which differs from the cooking sun of the afternoon... we will drawthe conclusion that a relationship exists between the fruit, for example itstaste, and the sun of its ripening, and, for the pepper plant, between the fireof the pepper and the fire of the sun. There is a harmony in their ‘nature’.If a good gardener plants his cauliflower on the day of the full moon, and a badgardener plants them at new moon, the former will have rich, white cauliflowerand the latter will harvest nothing but stunted plants. It is sufficient to trythis in order to prove it. So it is for everything that grows and lives. Whythese effects? Direct rays of sunlight or indirect rays reflected from the moon?Certainly, but for quite another, less material reason: cosmic harmony. Purelymaterial reasons no longer explain why the season, even the month and theprecise date, must be taken into account for the best results. Invisible cosmicinfluences come into play...3 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark16]I have quoted at such length because Schwaller here not only provides an insightinto the Egyptian state of mind, but into the reason why primitive man paid suchattention to the sun and moon. This is why he made perfectly spherical stonesand sun discs, and why later he buried his dead in circular barrows. The sun—andthe moon—meant infinitely, more for him than it can for modern man.Schwaller makes another central point that is as valid for early Homo sapiens asfor the ancient Egyptians: that they took life after death for granted. Life onearth was only a small part of the great cycle that began and would end inanother world. Spirits—nature spirits and the spirits of the dead—were as realas living people. The elaborate burial practices of Neanderthal man make itclear that he also took life after death for granted, and the suggestions ofritual cannibalism make the same point—for the cannibal intends to absorb thevital principle of his enemy. We can say that the holes in the skulls found inthe Chou-Kou-Tien cave, which suggest that Peking man was a cannibal, alsosuggest that he believed in spirits.Any kind of ritual indicates a level of intelligence beyond the merely animal. Aritual symbolises events in the real world, and a symbol is an abstraction. Manis the only creature capable of abstraction. So if Peking man indulged in ritualcannibalism, this would already seem to suggest that he was truly human. Andsince it is hard to imagine any kind of ritual without communication, then wealso have to imagine that he was capable of speech.In an earlier chapter, we dealt with the suggestion that the ‘brain explosion’might have been due to the development of speech, pointing out that this theoryalso requires us to explain what primitive man had to say. The suggestion ofritual cannibalism—and therefore of religion—provides an answer. Peking man hadno need to ask his wife, ‘Have you done the washing up?’ But if he lived in therich and complex world suggested by Schwaller de Lubicz, in which every hour ofthe day had its individual neter or vibration, and in which the sun, the moonand the spirits of the dead were living presences, then language had, so tospeak, an object on which to exercise itself.Peking man provides us with another clue. In 1930, Teilhard de Chardin visitedthe Abbé Breuil in Paris and showed him a piece of blackened bone. ‘What do youthink that is?’ The Abbé examined it, then said: ‘It’s a piece of stag antler,which has been exposed to fire then worked with some crude stone tool.’‘Impossible!’ said Teilhard. ‘It’s from Chou-Kou-Tien.’ ‘I don’t care where it’sfrom,’ said Breuil. ‘It was fashioned by man—and by a man who knew the use offire.’The piece of antler was about half a million years old. And since it was carvedwith a tool after it was burnt, we must presume it was deliberately burnt first.So Homo erectus used fire.We cannot suppose that he knew how to make fire by striking flints together—thatseems to be supposing too high a level of sophistication. In which case, we haveto assume that he supplied himself with fire when he saw a tree struck bylightning—or some similar phenomenon—and then kept it burning permanently,presumably by assigning someone in the group to keep it alive. And this notionof keeping a fire alive, for year after year, would obviously provide the‘fire-keeper’ with a powerful sense of motivation and purpose. And since purposemakes for evolution, we have yet another possible contributory reason for the‘brain explosion’. Peking man, apparently, had both fire and some kind ofreligious ritual.Schwaller makes the important point that Egyptian science, Egyptian art,Egyptian medicine, Egyptian astronomy, must not be seen as different aspects ofEgyptian life; they were all aspects of the same thing, which was religion inits broadest sense. Religion was identical with knowledge.The same must have been true for the descendants of Peking man. They had movedfrom the merely animal level to the level where knowledge could be pinned downin some kind of language. To see a tree or a river or a mountain as a god—orrather a neter— would be to see it in a new and strange light. Even today, areligious convert sees the world in this strange light in which everything looksdifferent. Shaw makes a character in Back to Methuselah say that since her mindwas awakened, even small things are turning out to be big things. This is theeffect of knowledge. It brings a sense of distance from the material world, anda sense of control.Yet Neanderthal man was religious, and he still vanished from history. This canbe for only one reason: that the being who supplanted him had an even greatersense of precision and control. No doubt Neanderthal man had his own form ofhunting magic; but compared to the magic of Cro-Magnon man, with its shamans andrituals and cave drawings, it was as crude as a bicycle compared to a motor car.This sense of precision and control is illustrated in a story told by JacquettaHawkes in her book Man and the Sun (1962). She points out:The absence of any solar portrait or symbol in Palaeolithic art may not meanthat the sun had absolutely no part in it. A rite practised among the pygmies ofthe Congo warns against any such assumption. Frobenius was travelling throughthe jungle with several of these skilful and brave little hunters when, towardsevening, a need arose for fresh meat. The white man asked his companions if theycould kill an antelope. They were astonished at the folly of the request,explaining that they could not hunt successfully that day because no properpreparation had been made; they promised to go hunting the next morning instead.Frobenius, curious to know what their preparations might be, got up before dawnand hid himself on the chosen hill-top. All the pygmies of the party appeared,three men and a woman, and presently they smoothed a patch of sand and drew anoutline upon it. They waited; then, as the sun rose, one of the men fired anarrow into the drawing, while the woman raised her arms towards the sun andcried aloud. The men dashed off into the forest. When Frobenius approached theplace, he found that the drawing was that of an antelope, and that the arrowstood in its neck. Later, when the hunting party had returned with a fineantelope shot through the neck, some of them took tufts of its hair and acalabash of blood, plastered them on the drawing and then wiped it out. JosephCampbell adds, The crucial point of the pygmy ceremony was that it should takeplace at dawn, the arrow flying into the antelope precisely when it was struckby a ray of the sun...’It is easy to see that the Cro-Magnon hunter, using this kind of technique,would feel like a modern big game hunter using a high-powered rifle withtelescopic sights. By comparison, the older magic of Neanderthal man must haveseemed as crude as a bow and arrow.This, I am inclined to believe, was the reason that Cro-Magnon man became thefounder of civilisation. His command of ‘magic’ gave him a sense of optimism, ofpurpose, of control, such as had been possessed by no animal before him.Central to this evolution was the authority of the chief. Among animals, theleader is simply the most dominant. But if Cro-Magnon man resembled hisdescendants in Egypt and Sumeria and Europe (or even the chief of the AmahuacaIndians in Brazil), then his kings were not simply authority figures, butpriests and shamans, those with a knowledge of ‘spirits’ and the gods. This wasof immense importance for ancient man; we can form some estimate of what itmeant if we think of Hitler’s effect on Germany in the early 1930s—the sense ofoptimism, of idealism, of national purpose. Hitler’s Third Reich was basicallyreligious in conception—the notion of heaven brought down to earth. The same wastrue of ancient Egypt, under its pharaoh-god.So if there was a civilisation in ‘Atlantis’ before 11,000 BC, and in Tiahuanacoin the Andes, and in pre-dynastic Egypt, then we can state beyond doubt that itwas a ‘pharaonic theocracy’, ruled by a king who was also believed to be a god.The pyramids were built by men who believed totally and without question thattheir pharaoh was a god, and that in erecting such magnificent structures, theywere serving the gods. Such a belief gives a society a sense of purpose anddirection that is impossible for any group of mere animals, no matter howdominant and cunning their leader. When primitive man came to believe that histribal leader was in touch with the gods, he had taken one of the most importantsteps in his evolution."},{"pageContent":"9 OF STARS AND GODSIn the summer of 1933, a 39-year-old Scot named Alexander Thom anchored hissailing yacht in East Loch Roag, north-west of the island of Lewis in theHebrides. Thom was an aeronautical engineer whose lifelong passion was sailing.As the moon rose, he looked up and saw, silhouetted against it, the standingstones of Callanish, ‘Scotland’s Stonehenge’.After dinner, Thom walked up to it, and looking along the avenue of menhirs,realised that its main north-south axis pointed direct at the Pole Star. ButThom knew that when the stones were erected—probably before the GreatPyramid—the Pole Star was not in its present position.So how did the men who built it manage to point it with such accuracy togeographical north? To do this, with such incredible precision as is revealed atCallanish, would require something more than guesswork. One way would be toobserve the exact position of the rising sun and the setting sun, and thenbisect the line between them—but that can only be done accurately in flatcountry, where both horizons are level. Another would be to observe some starclose to the pole in the evening, then again twelve hours later before dawn, andbisect that line. Thom could see that it would be an incredibly complicatedbusiness involving plumb lines and upright stakes. Obviously, these ancientengineers were highly sophisticated.Thom began to study other stone circles, most of them virtually unknown. Theyconvinced him that he was dealing with men whose intelligence was equal to, orsuperior to, his own—a television programme about his ideas referred to them as‘prehistoric Einsteins’.The idea staggered—and enraged—most archaeologists. The astronomer Sir NormanLockyer had observed, around the beginning of the twentieth century, thatStonehenge might be a kind of astronomical calculator, marking the positions ofthe sun and moon, but no one had taken him very seriously, for most ‘experts’were convinced that the builders of Stonehenge were superstitious savages, whoprobably conducted human sacrifices on the altar stone. Thom was asserting that,on the contrary, they were master-geometers.Moreover, most of these stone circles were not circles: some were shaped likeeggs, some like letter Ds. Yet the geometry—as Thom discovered through years ofstudy and calculation—was always precise. How did they do it? Thom finallyworked out that the ‘circles’ were built around ‘Pythagoreantriangles’—triangles whose sides were, respectively, 3, 4 and 5 units long (sothe square on the hypotenuse was equal to the sum of the squares on the othertwo sides).And why did they want these circles? That was more difficult to answer.Presumably to work out such things as the phases of the moon, the movement ofthe sun between the solstices and equinoxes, and to predict eclipses. But whydid they want to predict eclipses? Thom admitted that he did not know, but hementioned a story of two ancient Chinese astronomers losing their heads becausethey failed to predict an eclipse—which meant that the ancients attached immenseimportance to eclipses.There was another interesting problem. If these ancient men were so skilled ingeometry, how did they remember it all? No stone or clay tablets inscribed withgeometrical propositions has come down to us from the megalith builders. Butthen, we do know that the ancient Greeks knew their Homer—and other poets—byheart. They had trained their memories until they could recite hundreds ofthousands of lines. The Iliad and Odyssey we read in books had been passed downfor centuries in the memory of bards—this is why bards were so highly respected.When Alexander Thom died, at the age of 91, in 1985, he was no longer regardedas a member of the lunatic fringe; many respectable archaeologists and expertson ancient Britain had become his firmest supporters. Moreover, the Britishastronomer Gerald Hawkins had confirmed Thom’s most important assertions byfeeding the data from monuments like Stonehenge through his computer at Harvard,and proving that there were astronomical alignments.One of Thom’s most interesting followers, the Scottish academic Anne Macaulay,has followed in Thom’s footsteps with a theory that is just as controversial. InScience and Gods in Megalithic Britain, she starts from Thom’s assumption thatthe earliest geometry was a tradition which was not written down, and that itwas connected with astronomy.1 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark17] She then askedherself how ancient astronomers could have stored their knowledge in the absenceof phonetic writing (which was developed by the Greeks and Phoenicians after2000 BC). Obviously, memory has to be the answer. But not memory in the sense wespeak of it today. It is a little-known fact that the ancients had developed acomplex art of memory, which they regarded as comparable to any of the otherarts or sciences. The scholar Frances Yates has written about it in her book TheArt of Memory (1966) and shows how we can trace it back to the ancient Greeks,and how it survived down to the time of Shakespeare.The art of memory did not simply depend on brain power, but upon a complicatedseries of mnemonics (devices for helping us remember, like ‘roygbiv’ for thecolours of the rainbow). Anne Macaulay’s suggestion is that the phoneticalphabet was created as a series of mnemonics to record positions of the polarstars, and that the word ‘Apollo’—the god of music—was one of these basicmnemonics. The letters, from A to U, were created as mnemonics for certaingeometric theorems or figures, with which numbers were associated. (In fact,Anne Macaulay’s starting point was her study of the ancient Greek musicalscale.)Her theory of ancient history, and the geometry of megalithic circles, is toocomplicated to detail here. But she reaches one thought-provoking conclusion:that when this ‘code’ is used to encapsulate the extreme southerly rising of themoon, the ideal spot to build an observatory is precisely where Stonehenge isplaced. Another is that all this indicates that ancient Greek science—includingPythagoras (who was born about 540 BC)—probably originated in Europe—the exactreverse of a suggestion made in the nineteenth century that Stonehenge was builtby Mycenaean Greeks. She suggests that the early Greeks may have been Britishtin traders from Cornwall.Since we know that the construction of Stonehenge began about 3100 BC, hertheory also implies that phonetic writing is about fifteen hundred years olderthan we at present assume.From our point of view, the importance of this whole argument is its suggestionthat geometry and astronomy existed in a sophisticated form long before therewas an accurate method of writing it down. Anne Macaulay believes—as Thomdoes—that it can be read in the geometry of megalithic circles and monuments,and that their builders are trying to pass a message on to us—just as RobertBauval and Graham Hancock believe (as we shall see) that the ancient Egyptianswere passing on a message in the geometry of Giza.When did our ancestors begin to use mnemonics to record the movements of the sunand moon?Incredibly, the answer to that question seems to be at least 35,000 years ago.In the 1960s, a research fellow of the Peabody Museum named Alexander Marshackwas studying the history of civilisation, and was troubled by what he called ‘aseries of “suddenlies”’. Science had begun ‘suddenly’ with the Greeks,mathematics and astronomy had appeared ‘suddenly’ among the Egyptians, theMesopotamians and the Chinese, civilisation itself had begun ‘suddenly’ in theFertile Crescent in the Middle East.In short, Marshack was bothered by the same question that had troubled Schwallerde Lubicz and John Anthony West. And, like Schwaller and West, Marshack decidedthat these things had not appeared ‘suddenly’, but after thousands of years ofpreparation.He was curious to know whether there was any archaeological evidence that manindulged in seasonal (he calls them ‘time factored’) activities like agriculturein the days ‘before civilisation’.At this point, he became fascinated by strange markings on pieces of bone datingfrom the Stone Age. Under a microscope, he could see that they were made withmany different tools, which indicated that they were not made, at the same time.He finally reached the conclusion that one series of marks forming a curved lineon a 35,000-year-old bone were notations of the phases of the moon. Which meantthat, in a sense, Cro-Magnon man had invented ‘writing’.But why? Why should he care about the movements of the sun and moon? To beginwith, because he was intelligent—as intelligent as modern man. He probablyregarded himself as highly civilised, just as we do. And an intelligent personneeds a sense of time, of history. Marshack mentions a ‘calendar stick’ of thePima Indians of America, which represents their history over 44 years. Thismeans that the Indian ‘story teller’ could take the stick, point out somedistant year, and recount its history—represented by dots or spirals or otherfaint marks. Cro-Magnon man of 35,000 years ago would probably have done muchthe same thing.And then, of course, a calendar would be useful to hunters, telling them whenthe deer or other prey would be returning. It would be useful to pregnant womenwho wanted to know when they were due to give birth. In fact, a calendar is oneof the basic needs of civilisation, the equivalent of modern man’s digitalwatch.But of course, we are forgetting another vital factor. If Schwaller is correct,Cro-Magnon man was interested in the sun and moon for another reason: because hewas sensitive to their rhythms, and experienced them as living forces. Today,even the most sceptical scientist acknowledges the influence of the moon onmental patients; any doctor who has worked in a hospital will verify thatcertain patients are affected by the full moon. Yet compared to aboriginalpeoples, civilised man has lost most of his sensitivity to nature.If we want to understand our Cro-Magnon ancestors, then we have to try toimagine human beings who are as sensitive to the sun, moon and other naturalforces (like earth magnetism) as a mental patient is to the full moon.In The Roots of Civilisation, Marshack comments: ‘Though in the UpperPalaeolithic explanations were by story and via image and symbol, there was ahigh intelligence, cognition, rationality, knowledge and technical skillinvolved.’2 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark18] In other words, Stone Age manpossessed all the abilities needed to create civilisation.And yet although he was poised on the brink of civilisation 35,000 years ago,living in a community sufficiently sophisticated to need a knowledge ofastronomy, we are asked to believe that it actually took him another 25,000years before he began to take the first hesitant steps towards building theearliest cities.It sounds, on the whole, rather unlikely.In his bafflingly obscure book, The White Goddess, the poet Robert Graves putsforward a view that is in total accord with Marshack’s conclusions. He arguesthat worship of the moon goddess (the ‘white goddess’) was the originaluniversal religion of mankind, which was supplanted at a fairly late stage byworship of the sun god Apollo, whom he regards as a symbol of science andrationality—that is, of left-brain knowledge, as opposed to the right-brainintuition that he associates with the goddess.Graves explains that he was reading Lady Charlotte Guest’s translation of theWelsh epic The Mabinogion when he came upon an incomprehensible poem called ‘TheSong of Taliesin’. Suddenly he knew (‘don’t ask me how’) that the lines were aseries of mediaeval riddles, to which he knew the answers. He also knew (‘byinspiration’) that the riddles were linked with a Welsh tradition about a Battleof the Trees, which was actually about a struggle between two Druid priesthoodsfor the control of learning.The Druid alphabet was a closely guarded secret, but its eighteen letters werethe names of trees, whose consonants stood for the months of which the treeswere characteristic, and the vowels for the positions of the sun, with itsequinoxes and solstices. The ‘tree calendar’ was in use throughout Europe andthe Middle East in the Bronze Age, and was associated with the Triple MoonGoddess.This cult, says Graves, was slowly repressed by ‘the busy rational cult of theSolar God Apollo, who rejected the Orphic tree-alphabet in favour of thecommercial Phoenician alphabet—the familiar ABC—and initiated Europeanliterature and science.’Graves’s idea supports Anne Macaulay’s notion that the modern alphabet wasassociated with Apollo. It also supports many of the suggestions made in thelast chapter about the ‘magical’ mentality of Cro-Magnon man, which has slowlygiven way to the ‘bicameral’ mind of today.According to Graves, he did not have to ‘research’ The White Goddess in thenormal sense; he had it ‘thrust upon him’. And what was ‘thrust upon him’ was awhole knowledge system that is based upon a mentality that is totally differentfrom our own—upon ‘lunar’ rather than ‘solar’ premises.And this, clearly, is also what Schwaller is attempting to outline in books likeSacred Science, and helps to explain their obscurity: he is trying to describe aremote and forgotten vision of reality in a language that is totally unsuited toit.The mention of ancient calendars inevitably reminds us of the famous Mayancalendar which, as Graham Hancock points out, is far more accurate than themodern Gregorian calendar. Hancock quotes an archaeologist asking why the Mayacreated such an incredibly accurate calendar, but failed to grasp the principleof the wheel. We know, of course, that the Maya inherited their calendar fromthe Olmecs of a thousand years earlier, but that only shifts the emphasis of thequestion to why the Olmecs failed to grasp the principle of the wheel.Hancock suggests that the answer may be that the Maya—and the Olmecs—did notinvent the calendar: they inherited it—exactly the suggestion that Schwaller deLubicz made to explain the sophistication of Egyptian science. All the evidencewe have considered so far indicates that they are correct.Which still leaves us with the question: why should anyone want such an accuratecalendar?One intriguing possibility has been suggested by a modern researcher namedMaurice Cotterell, in a book called The Mayan Prophecies (coauthored with AdrianGilbert, Robert Bauval’s collaborator on The Orion Mystery).Cotterell is an engineer and computer scientist who became interested inscientific aspects of astrology. When in the merchant navy, he noticed that hiscolleagues on board ship seemed to behave in ways that corresponded with theirastrological signs—that ‘fire’ signs are more aggressive than ‘water’ signs, andso on.Now in fact, a statistician named Michel Gauquelin had already raised thisquestion, and published a study indicating that there is genuine statisticalevidence for certain propositions of astrology, such as that more scientists anddoctors are born under the sign of Mars, and that more politicians and actorsare born under Jupiter. A sceptical psychologist, Dr Hans Eysenck, wasopen-minded enough to look at these results, and dismayed his colleagues bypublicly admitting that they seemed to be sound. Eysenck then went on to workwith an astrologer named Jeff Mayo, and they studied two huge samples ofsubjects chosen at random to see whether people born under ‘fire’ signs (Aries,Leo, Sagittarius) and ‘air’ signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) are more extrovertedthan people born under ‘earth’ (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) and ‘water’ (Cancer,Scorpio, Pisces) signs. And although the odds against it were 10,000 to 1, thestatistics involving around 4,000 people showed that it was indeed so.Cotterell wanted to know how this could be. Is there some cosmic factor thatchanges from month to month to explain this puzzling result? The signs of thezodiac (Aries, Taurus, etc) are called ‘sun’ signs because the sun rises againsta background of different constellations each month. But obviously, theconstellations cannot influence individuals—they are light-years away; it is amere figure of speech to say our fate is written in the stars, for they aremerely the figures on a clock that enable us to tell the time.On the other hand, the sun does something that has considerable influence on theearth; this great roaring furnace sends out a continuous stream of energy, whichcauses the tails of comets to stream out behind them like flags in the wind. Italso has variations known as sunspots, which are huge magnetic flares that cancause radio interference on Earth. They send out a ‘solar wind’ of magneticparticles which cause the Aurora Borealis.Cotterell decided to start with the reasonable assumption that it may be themagnetic field of the sun that affects human embryos—particularly sunspotactivity.Because the sun is made of plasma—superheated gas—it does not rotate uniformly,like the earth; its equator rotates almost a third faster than its poles—26 daysto a ‘turn’ as compared to 37. So its lines of magnetism get twisted, andsometimes stick out of the sun like bed-springs out of a broken mattress; theseare ‘sunspots’.Cotterell was excited to learn that the sun not only changes the type ofradiation emitted every month, but that there are four types of solar radiationwhich follow one another in sequence. So the sun’s activities not only seem tocorrespond to the monthly astrological changes known as ‘sun signs’, but also tothe four types of sign—fire, earth, air, water.Because the earth is also revolving around the sun, a 26-day rotation of the suntakes 28 days as seen from Earth. The earth receives a shower of alternatingnegative and positive particles every seven days.Biologists know that the earth’s weak magnetic field influences living cells andcan affect the synthesis of DNA in the cells. So it seemed to Cotterell highlyprobable that changes in the sun’s magnetic field affect babies at the moment ofconception. If so, he had discovered the scientific basis of astrology.Astrologers to whom he explained his theory were dubious. According toastrology, it is the time of birth that affects us, not the moment ofconception. Yet this hardly seems to make sense—after all, the baby has beenalive for nine months at the time of birth. In fact, another scientist wasalready at work on a similar theory; in The Paranormal: Beyond Sensory Science(1992), physicist Percy Seymour suggests that the newly formed foetus isaffected by the ‘magnetic web’ of the solar system, which stretches like a cat’scradle between the sun, moon and planets. Cotterell was simply ignoring the moonand planets as unimportant.When Cotterell was appointed to a job at the Cranfield Institute of Technology,he lost no time in feeding his data into its powerful computer. He wanted toplot the interaction of the sun’s two magnetic fields (due to its differentspeeds of rotation at the poles and equator) and the earth’s movement round thesun.What came out of the computer was a graph that showed a definite rhythmic cycleevery eleven and a half years. Astronomers have computed the sunspot ‘cycle’ at11.1 years. So it looked as if Cotterell was getting close.The sun’s two interacting magnetic fields come back to square one, so to speak,every 87.45 days, which Cotterell called a ‘bit’. Looking at his graph, he sawthat the sunspot cycle repeats itself and goes back to square one every 187years. But there is a further complication called the sun’s ‘neutral sheet’—thearea around the equator where north and south balance out perfectly. This sheetis warped by the sun’s magnetic field, so it shifts by one ‘bit’ every 187years, giving a total cycle—before it goes back to square one—of 18,139 years.And every 18,139 years, the sun’s magnetic field reverses.This period, Cotterell could see, broke down into 97 periods of 187 years,consisting of five major cycles, three of 19 times 187, and two of 20 times 187.It was when Cotterell noticed that 20 times 187 years amounts to 1,366,040 daysthat he became excited. He had become interested in one of the Mayanastronomical documents known as the Dresden Codex, which the Maya used to workout eclipses, as well as with the cycles of the planet Venus, to which theyattached tremendous importance. The Maya declared that Venus was ‘born’ in theyear 3114 BC, on 12 August. (We may recall that Immanuel Velikovsky, discussedin Chapter 5, believed that Venus had been ‘born’ out of Jupiter, and came closeto the earth on its way to its present position.) The Mayas calculated using acomplicated period called a tzolkin—260 days—and according to them, a full cycleof the planet Venus amounted to 1,366,560 days. This, Cotterell noticed, was thesame as his number 1,366,040, plus two tzolkins.Was it possible, he wondered, that the Mayas had somehow stumbled on hisrecognition about sunspot cycles, and that their highly complex calendar wasbased on it?There was something else that made him feel he might be on the right track. Hehad noted a rather curious fact—that the sun’s magnetic bombardment intensifiesduring periods of low activity in sunspot cycles. This seemed contradictory;surely you would expect it to be lower? The reason, he concluded, has to do withthe belts of radiation around the earth known as the Van Allen belts, which werediscovered by space scientist James Van Allen in 1958. These are due to theearth’s magnetic field, and they trap solar radiation, which would otherwisedestroy life on earth.Cotterell reasoned that the Van Allen belts become super-saturated with magneticparticles during periods of high sunspot activity, so reducing the amount ofradiation that reaches Earth’s surface. In periods of low sunspot activity, theylet the particles through. And, Cotterell believed, they cause infertility andother problems.Cotterell was inclined to date the decline of the Maya from the year AD 627,when Earth was receiving maximum bombardment from sun magnetism. Now he realisedthat AD 627 was also the end of the Mayan cycle (of 1,366,560 days), startingfrom the ‘birth of Venus’ in 3114 BC. This was also the time the sun’s magneticcycle reversed. The birth of Venus was the date of the previous reverse. Surelythat could not be coincidence?Rather more worrying was the fact that the next Mayan cycle will end on 22December 2012, when the sun’s magnetic field will again reverse. Cotterellpoints out that there is now a fall in fertility in the developed countries, andthat this may be due to this change in the sunspot cycle.Graham Hancock, we may recall, cites the year 2030 as the time when the earth’smagnetic poles are expected to reverse, causing widespread catastrophes. IfCotterell is correct, the earth may experience problems 18 years before thattime.But then, after all, Hancock and Cotterell may both be wrong. The earth survivedits previous change in the sun’s magnetic field—in AD 627—without apparentcatastrophe. In that year, the Roman emperor Heraclitus invaded Assyria andMesopotamia, and defeated the Persians near Nineveh, the Prophet Mahometharassed the Meccans from Medina, and the Japanese despatched envoys to China.None of these seemed to notice the reversal of the sun’s magnetic field.As to the earth’s magnetic field, scientists at present have no idea what causesit, let alone why its polarity occasionally reverses; so there can clearly be noscientific reason why it should happen in 2030 rather than in a thousand years’time.Cotterell’s ideas have nevertheless made an important contribution to the studyof ancient civilisations. He appears to have demonstrated very convincingly thatthe Maya calendar has a sound scientific foundation, and—once again—that ancientman seemed to know far more about the heavens than modern astronomers give himcredit for.Moreover, if the Maya based their calendar on the sunspot cycle, then we mustassume that this knowledge was based on intuition rather than purely scientificinterest. Schwaller de Lubicz says that each livingbeing is in contact with the energies of the universe, and that each hour of theday has its different neters or vibrations. If Alexander Marshack is correct,then Cro-Magnon man studied the heavens because he was aware of these energiesor vibrations, and the same undoubtedly applies to the Incas and the Mayas.I have deliberately left until this point a discussion of one of the mostpuzzling and frustrating books ever written on the problem of astronomy andancient man: Hamlets Mill (1960), by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha vonDachend. By comparison with Hamlets Mill, Graves’s White Goddess seems a modelof clarity.Santillana was a highly respected professor of the history of science, butHamlets Mill was rejected by academic publishers, and finally had to be issuedby one of the lesser known commercial publishers. So his fellow academics hadtwo reasons for ignoring it: not only was it incredibly obscure, but the factthat it was brought out by a non-academic press amounted to an admission that itfell below acceptable standards of scholarship. In fact, the general academicopinion seemed to be that it proved Santillana had joined the lunatic fringe.Yet in spite of its obscurity, the book has slowly made its way—for it isimpossible to read more than a few pages without recognising that it is sayingsomething of tremendous importance, and that Santillana knows exactly what he istalking about.For a long time, Santillana had been aware that there was a point where thehistory of science blended into mythology. And Hamlets Mill makes it clear that,at some point, he must have received a revelation about mythology that left himoverwhelmed with the sense that he had been entrusted with some amazing secretof the past.His collaborator, Hertha von Dachend, was an anthropologist, a pupil of thatsame Frobenius who had seen the African pygmies shooting an arrow into a drawingof an antelope. She also felt that myth was more than primitive nonsense. Andshe ‘hit pay dirt’ (in Santillana’s phrase) when she noticed that two tinyPacific islands, undistinguished except for their extraordinary number of sacredsites, were situated precisely on the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic ofCapricorn—the point at which the sun ‘stands still’ and then retraces its stepsat the solstices. Her observation confirmed that ‘primitive man’ was deeplyconcerned with astronomy, and was therefore less primitive than anyone supposed.Santillana had already reached the same conclusion. Years before, he hadrecognised that one of the basic characteristics of ancient man was ‘an immense,steady, minute attention to the seasons. What is a solstice or an equinox? Itstands for the capacity of coherence, deduction, imaginative intention andreconstruction with which we could hardly credit our forefathers. And yet thereit was. I saw.’Long before writing was invented, says Santillana, man was obsessed by measuresand counting, by numbers—and by astronomy. And he goes on to speak—in languagereminiscent of Alexander Thom—of those ‘Newtons and Einsteins long forgotten’.This ancient knowledge, Santillana felt, was based upon time, ‘the time ofmusic’ (of which we shall have more to say later).The basic argument of the book can be expressed very simply: that ancient mannot only knew about the precession of the equinoxes (which was supposed to havebeen discovered by the Greek Hipparchus in 134 BC), but encoded this knowledgein dozens of myths. This is an interesting thesis, but hardly sounds epochmaking. But that is only half the story.Santillana says:This book is highly unconventional... To begin with, there is no system that canbe presented in modern analytical terms. There is no key, and there are noprinciples from which a presentation can be deduced. The structure comes from atime when there was no such thing as a system in our sense, and it would beunfair to search for one. There could hardly have been one among people whocommitted all their ideas to memory.In other words, what the normal reader expects him to do is to discuss ancientmyths, and then ‘explain’ them in terms of precession of the equinoxes. He istrying to say that it is not as simple as that. ‘The subject has the nature of ahologram, something that has to be present as a whole to the mind.’There is a simpler way of expressing what Santillana is trying to explain. Allover the world, in myths of dozens of different cultures, there are legends thatare obviously expressions of the same story. Sir James Frazer made this thestarting point of his famous Golden Bough. Frazer decided that the key to themystery was the notion of the earth’s fertility, the need for a good harvest.The king was a magician whose powers ensured rainfall. If they began to fail, hewas offered as a sacrifice to the gods. Eventually, the sacrifice becamesymbolic, and turned into a ritual in which the god was buried, and sprang upagain in the spring, like John Barleycorn...The problem here, of course, is that it presupposes that myths developed afterman became a farmer. What emerges from Hamlet's Mill is Santillana’s powerfulsense that they are far, far older. There are even times when we suspect that heis hinting that they stretch back tens of thousands of years.In effect, Santillana is presenting a rich tapestry of legends of the Eskimoes,Icelanders, Norsemen, American Indians, Finns, Hawaiians, Japanese, Chinese,Hindus, Persians, Romans, ancient Greeks, ancient Hindus, ancient Egyptians, anddozens of other nations, and asking: how did these strange similarities developunless myths have some common origin? And this origin, he is inclined tobelieve, lies in astronomy.His starting point is a corn-grinding mill that belonged to the Icelandic heroAmlodhi (whose name has come down to us as Hamlet). This mill originally groundout peace and plenty; it existed in the days of the ‘Golden Age’. This came toan end, and the mill then ground out salt. Finally, it ended at the bottom ofthe sea, grinding up sand, and creating the whirlpool called the Maelstrom—whichEdgar Allen Poe used to such dramatic effect. (‘Mala’ means to grind.)Why a mill? Presumably because one grinding wheel, the sun, goes through theconstellations in one direction—Aries, Taurus, Gemini and so on—while theequinoxes move in the opposite direction—Gemini, Taurus, Aries.What was embodied in the mill was the idea ‘of catastrophes and the periodicrebuilding of the world’. So ancient myths are about catastrophes like theFlood. But the ‘ages’ that end in catastrophe are due to the precession of theequinoxes, which means that we move from age to age—the age of Leo in 10,000 BCdown to our present age of Pisces, and the coming age of Aquarius.Obviously, if the ancients thought that precession was connected with periodicgreat catastrophes that destroyed a large part of mankind, they were going toattach great importance to it, and study it minutely. According to Santillana,Amlodhi’s mill is an image of precession of the equinoxes.In our own time, ‘ancient astronaut’ theorists like von Daniken have pointed tothe evidence for sophisticated knowledge among the ancients, and argued thatthis proves that this knowledge was brought to Earth by visitors from outerspace. In fact, the precession theory advanced by Santillana is fairlyconclusive evidence that there were no such visitors. If there had been, theywould have explained to those early astronomers that precession was simply dueto the tilt of the earth’s axis, which makes the earth wobble like a top orgyroscope, and that it has no great universal significance—in which case, therich cluster of myths explored in Hamlets Mill would never have come intoexistence.Let me offer an example of Santillana’s complex method of argument. Chapter 21,‘The Great God Pan is Dead’, begins by recounting Plutarch’s story of how avoice from a Greek island called out to the pilot of a ship—an Egyptian namedThamus—‘When you come opposite to Palodes, announce that Great Pan is dead.’Since it was calm and still as he passed Palodes, Thamus did as he was asked,and there were great cries and lamentations from the shore. The emperorTiberius, who was interested in mythology, sent for Thamus in order to hear thestory from his own lips.Christians were inclined to interpret the story as meaning that Christ was dead(since Jesus was crucified in the reign of Tiberius). But Santillana goes on tocite many oddly similar myths. In the Tyrol, there are legends of Fanggen, treespirits who sometimes enter human homes as servants. In one story collected byGrimm, a man on his way home hears a voice calling: ‘Yoke bearer, yoke bearer,tell them at home that Giki-Gaki is dead.’ When he repeats this, the housemaidbursts into tears and vanishes. The ‘yoke’ referred to, according to Santillana,is the axle of Amlodhi’s mill.There are many variants. A man is watching a meeting of cats when one of themjumps on a wall and shouts: ‘Tell Dildrum that Doldrum is dead.’ When he getshome, he tells his wife what he has seen, and their house cat shouts: ‘Then I amking of the cats’, and vanishes up the chimney.Is it possible, asks Santillana, that Plutarch’s ship is the constellation Argo,and that it has the dead body of Osiris on board? And is it chance that thepilot is called Thamus, like Plato’s king who criticised Thoth (the god Mercury)for inventing writing, which made man mentally lazy, and brought an end to anage of ‘integral knowledge’ of the universe?He goes on to tell another story of women lamenting the death of a god, thistime Tammuz, who figures in Frazer as a grain god who dies with the season. Butin this context, the minor god Tammuz is mentioned in context with manyimportant gods; what is he doing in such distinguished company?The answer, says Santillana, appears when we learn the date of the festival ofTammuz. It took place on the night of 19-20 June, the date that marked thebeginning of the Egyptian year. On that day, the dog star Sirius rose justbefore the sun (its ‘heliacal rising’). Now the Egyptians venerated Siriusbecause over 3000 years, it continued to rise at that date, in defiance ofprecession of the equinoxes.That sounds impossible, since all stars are affected by precession. But Siriusis, relatively speaking, very close to Earth—the second closest of all stars—andhas a considerable ‘proper motion’, which enables it to (apparently) defyprecession.There was another reason, to do with the fact that the ancient Egyptians used acalendar which, like the Roman Julian calendar, had only 365 days in the year,instead of 365.25, and this slight inaccuracy again enabled Sirius apparently todefy precession.So when Sirius also succumbed to precession, as it eventually did, the Great GodPan was dead.It can be seen why Santillana’s method of argument baffled the scholars, as heleaps bewilderingly from the Great God Pan to servant girls and tabby cats andPlato, and a dozen other examples that I have forborne to include, to end upwith precession and Sirius.Yet again, it must be stated that it is impossible to understand Hamlet’s Millunless we grasp that it is not just an attempt to argue that ancient mythsreflect a knowledge of precession. If this was all it amounted to, Santillanacould have managed it in a short essay. He needed a large and extremely densebook to convey what he wanted to bring to our attention: the incredible richnessof world mythology, and the fact that it seems to point to some way ofapprehending the universe that, in our age of written information andsound-bytes, we have long forgotten. He even goes out of his way to attack oneof the greatest students of myth, Ernst Cassirer, whom he feels to be too‘reductionist’. He obviously feels that he is saying something too big to bestated in a logical form and in so many words. He often comments that to exploresuch and such a connection would require a book in itself. Perhaps if he hadlived long enough to read Hancock’s Fingerprints of the Gods and Bauval’s OrionMystery, he might have begun to feel that a few people were beginning tounderstand what he was talking about.We have so far made no mention of another culture that has strong claims to bethe ‘cradle of civilisation’: that of ancient India.The generally accepted view of India was that it was originally occupied by aprimitive people called Dravidians, and that some time between 1500 and 1200 BC,blue-eyed Aryans descended from Afghanistan and swept the Dravidians south, thenestablishing their own ‘Vedic’ culture—a culture whose greatest literarymonuments are the Vedic hymns.In Harappa, in what is now Pakistan, huge mounds were known to conceal the ruinsof an ancient town, and in 1921, an Indian archaeologist, Daya Ram Sahni,suggested that it might belong to a period before the Maurya empire, which wasfounded at about the time of Alexander the Great (born 356 BC) by Chandragupta.In fact, excavation at Harappa revealed that it was two and a half thousandyears earlier than Chandragupta.In 1922, excavations began at Mohenji-Daro (which means ‘hill of the dead’) inthe Indus valley, four hundred miles south-west of Harappa, which revealed arich civilisation that no one had suspected. Incredibly, Mohenji-Daro proved tobe as sophisticated as a later Greek or Roman city, built on mud-brick platformsto protect it from floods, with a grid-plan reminiscent of New York, and animpressive sewer system—not to mention sit-down toilets. The size of the cityindicated that it had held about 40,000 people. The large number of femalestatuettes found there suggested that a female deity—probably the moongoddess—was worshipped. Their seals proved they possessed some form of writing.In subsequent years, further excavations along the 1800 miles of the Indus rivervalley revealed more than 150 sites, half a dozen of them cities. The wholearea, from the Arabian sea to the foothills of the Himalayas, was once the homeof a great civilisation that rivalled Egypt or Greece. This lost civilisationwas labelled the Indus Valley Culture.To the east of the Indus lies a vast desert, the Thar Desert. When remains oftowns were found in this desert, there was some puzzlement about how they hadsurvived in such arid conditions. Then satellite photographs revealed theanswer: the Thar Desert was once a fertile plain, traversed by a great river;there were even unmistakable signs of canals. Now only a small part of thisriver, the Ghaggar, exists. Scholars concluded that the river that had nowvanished was the Sarasvati, mentioned in the Vedic hymns.It seemed that in the heyday of Mohenji-Daro and Harappa, this whole plain wasone of the richest places in the world. At a time when ancient Britons wereBronze Age farmers, and the Greeks were a few Mycenaean warrior tribes, one ofthe world’s greatest civilisations flourished in the land of the Indus andSarasvati.It seems that some great catastrophe destroyed this civilisation some time after1900 BC. Evidence shows that the earth buckled, due to the pressure of thetectonic plate that has raised the Himalayas, and the result was a series ofearthquakes and volcanic eruptions that literally caused the rivers to sink intothe ground. The cost in human life must have been appalling.The Vedas are written in Sanskrit, a complex language that Sir William Jones—in1786—demonstrated to be related to Greek, Latin, German and Celtic (giving riseto the expression ‘Indo-European languages’). And if the Vedas speak of theSarasvati River, then it would seem clear that they were written before about2000 BC, and not later than 1500 BC, as scholars originally believed. And if—asseemed likely—Sanskrit was the language of the Aryans, then it was also clearthat they could not have invaded as late as 1500 BC.There are four major collections of Vedic hymns—the Rig-Veda, the Sama-Veda, theYajur-Veda and the Atharva-Veda, of which the Rig-Veda is recognised as theoldest and most important.In the 1980s, a Vedic scholar, David Frawley, observed that the hymns of theRig-Veda are full of an oceanic symbolism that seems to argue that they sprangfrom a maritime culture—which certainly contradicted the assumption that theAryans came from somewhere in central Europe. He also noted hymns that spoke ofthe ‘ancestors’ as coming from across the sea, having been saved from a greatflood.Studying the astronomical references in the Vedic hymns, Frawley concluded thatone reference to a summer solstice in Virgo indicated a date of about 4000 BC,while a reference to a summer solstice in Libra pointed to about 6000 BC. Healso concluded that the authors of the Vedas were familiar with the precessionof the equinoxes. These revolutionary ideas were set out in a book called Gods,Sages and Kings (1991).In the section of Vedic astronomy, for example, he discusses a myth about thegod of the year, Prajapati, falling in love with his own daughter Rohini, andbeing punished by a god called Rudra, who pierced him with a three-pointedarrow. Frawley points out that the god Rudra is the name in Vedic astronomy forSirius, while the three-pointed arrow is Orion, and Rohini is the starAldebaran. The myth indicates a time when the spring equinox was moving fromGemini into Taurus, around 4000 BC, (A scholar named B. G. Tilak had been one ofthe first to investigate the astronomy of the Vedas, and he devotes a whole bookto Orion.) Anyone who is familiar with Hamlet’s Mill will find nothingcontroversial in all this.It will also be noted that the Vedic Hindus showed a preoccupation with the samestars and constellations that were central to the Egyptians. Frawley points outthat the Hindu Varuna, like the Egyptian Osiris and the Greek Ouranos, are allsymbolised by Orion, and that their myths seem to refer to the vernal equinox inOrion around 6000 BC.Frawley recognised that the notion of a maritime culture dating back to before6000 BC is highly controversial and likely to be rejected out of hand. Yet, aswe have seen, Charles Hapgood would have found it perfectly credible. So, ofcourse, would that remarkable student of Mayan culture Augustus le Plongeon,who—it may be recollected—suggested that colonists from the Maya lands hadsailed to Europe and India thousands of years before Christ, and quoted theRamayana to the effect that India and China were invaded and conquered bywarriors known as great navigators and architects. John West and Graham Hancockwould probably amend Le Plongeon’s argument, and suggest that South America,Egypt and India became the home of survivors of some great catastrophe longbefore 6000 BC.The questions raised by Frawley in Gods, Sages and Kings are further explored ina book called In Search of the Cradle of Civilisation (1995) by GeorgFeuerstein, Subhash Kak and David Frawley. As the title suggests, they arguethat India is the ‘cradle of civilisation’, and that there is evidence of Vedicculture as long ago as 7000 BC. They point out that the myth of creation from achurning ocean of milk seems to refer to the Milky Way, while the churningmotion—as in Santillana—refers to Hamlet’s Mill or precession, and that theancient Hindus regarded the switch of the equinoctial point from oneconstellation to another (the end of an age) as an alarming event.The arguments of In Search of the Cradle of Civilisation inevitably bring tomind those of John Anthony West, Robert Bauval and Graham Hancock—in fact, theauthors mention Robert Schoch’s opinion that the Sphinx may date back to 7000BC. But they were unaware of the astronomical arguments that have since ledWest, Hancock and Bauval to date the Sphinx to 10,500 BC. If these are sound,then the suggestion that India is the cradle of civilisation because the Vedasseem to refer to dates as remote as 6000 BC loses much of its force.On the other hand, it could also be argued that the astronomical evidenceFeuerstein, Kak and Frawley present demonstrates that the ancient Hindus sharedthe Egyptian obsession with star-gazing and the precession of the equinoxes. Inwhich case, the same arguments apply to ancient India as to ancient Egypt. InEgypt, we have the suggestion that the dynastic civilisation of the thirdmillennium may have been preceded by a far older civilisation founded bysurvivors from a great flood, who planned the pyramids and built the Sphinx in10,500 BC. In India, it seems that the great civilisation of the Indus andSarasvati plain was preceded by forerunners whose great achievement was theRig-Veda. Frawley suggests that the civilisation of the ‘forerunners’ may datefrom 7000 BC—which happens to be the date that Schoch suggested for the Sphinx.There seems to be no good reason why the civilisation of the Vedic Hindus shouldnot also be pushed back a further 3,000 years or so.Let me try to express some of these insights in terms of the concepts developedin the last two chapters.Ancient man’s ‘knowledge’ was not knowledge in our modern sense: knowledge thatcould be classified in an encyclopaedia. It was a slowly increasing sense ofintuitive involvement in the universe. Santillana says: ‘Archaic thought iscosmological first and last; it faces the gravest implications of a cosmos inways which reverberate in later classic philosophy... It cannot be reduced toconcreteness.’An animal feels itself to be a creature, whose business is to adjust—in anessentially passive manner—to the universe around it. As man ceased to be mereanimal, he ceased to be passive. He began to feel there was something he coulddo to control the world in which he found himself. At first, this attempt atcontrol came through various forms of ritual—including ritual cannibalism. ‘Trueman’ began as a religious animal.A few hundred thousand years later, Neanderthal man had so far evolved that hisbrain was a third larger than that of modern man. The zoologist NicholasHumphrey was puzzled by the fact that the gorilla’s brain is far larger than itneeds to be, until he realised that this is a response to the extraordinarilyrich social life of the gorilla. In effect, a baby gorilla attends a kind ofuniversity in which it learns highly complex social behaviour. The same wasalmost certainly true of Neanderthal man.Yet it was Cro-Magnon man who took the next immense step forward in developinghunting magic. He felt that this brought him a new control over the universe.And he also studied the movements of the moon. Our assumption is that he merelyneeded some kind of calendar to tell him about animal migration, but both Gravesand Schwaller would obviously regard it in a completely different light. Theywould say that it was a part of a rich and complex knowledge system, a ‘lunar’system that was totally unlike our ‘solar’ knowledge. This is clearly whatSantillana is also trying to express.At some point—perhaps, as Jaynes suggests, as recently as 1250 BC—man began todevelop ‘solar’ knowledge, the kind of knowledge that can be set down inencyclopaedias and dictionaries and tables of logarithms. The difference betweenthe two types of knowledge is quite easy to express: it is the differencebetween insight and mere information. When Archimedes leapt out of the bathshouting ‘Eureka!’, he had had a sudden insight into floating bodies. Heexpressed this insight in the form of a ‘law’, which any schoolboy can learn byrote: the weight of a floating body is equal to the weight of the amount ofwater displaced. This sounds simple enough. But how would we use it if, likeArchimedes, we had to devise a method to find out whether a goldsmith hasadulterated the gold of a crown with some base metal? To work out this problem,we need insight into the law of floating bodies.3[../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark19]This is why, in Plato’s Phaedrus, King Thamus expresses doubt when the god Thothtells him that his invention of writing is a great step forward for the humanrace; the king replies that it will only make man mentally lazy, and diminishhis mental powers.Solar knowledge, which can be stored in encyclopaedias, is extremely useful; butit is no real substitute for that intimate sense of the universe—and of ourinvolvement with it—that was first developed by our remote star-gazingancestors.This brings us to one of the most recent and exciting speculations about ourstar-gazing ancestors.In Chapter 3, I spoke of the important advance Robert Bauval and Graham Hancockhave made in suggesting exactly why the ancient Egyptians built the Sphinxaround 10,500 BC, and the Great Pyramid 8000 years later. Keeper of Genesis (thetitle refers to the Sphinx) is a remarkable piece of research, based on computersimulations of the skies of ancient Egypt. The essence of the book lies in thiscomment:‘...it is our hypothesis that the Giza monuments, the past, present and futureskies that lie above them, and the ancient funerary texts that interlink them,convey the lineaments of a message. In attempting to read this message we havedone no more than follow the initiation “journey” of the Horus-Kings ofEgypt...’We have already seen how Bauval reconstructed the skies in 2500 BC, anddiscovered that the southern ‘ventilation shaft’ out of the King’s Chamberpointed directly at Orion’s Belt, while the similar shaft out of the Queen’sChamber below it pointed at the star Sirius, whom the Egyptians identified withIsis, just as they identified the constellation of Orion with Osiris. Thesealignments convinced Bauval that the Pyramid was, indeed, built whenEgyptologists think it was built.We also recall that the only time the positions of the three pyramids on theground reflect the positions of the three stars of Orion’s Belt is 10,500 BC,when Orion is at its closest to the southern horizon in the ‘precessionalcycle’, which takes 25,920 years. After that, Orion seems to rise very slowlythrough the heavens, and, in AD 2500, it will have reached its highest point,and begin descending again.The Egyptians called this earlier time, 10,500 BC, Zep Tepi, the ‘first time’,and identified it with a kind of golden age, the beginning of a new epoch. InSantillana’s terms, it was a time when the ‘mill’ ground out peace and plenty.It would, of course, have been highly convenient if the alignments suggestedthat the pyramid had been built in 10,500 BC, for it would go a long way toproving Schwaller’s conviction that the Sphinx and the pyramids were built bythe highly civilised survivors of some great catastrophe—Atlanteans.Bauval and Hancock point out that there is a highly convincing reason to believethat the Sphinx was built in 10,500 BC. Imagine that you are standing betweenthe paws of the Sphinx at dawn on the spring equinox of 10,500 BC. The Sphinxfaces due east, and a few moments before dawn, we see the constellation of Leorising above the horizon—Leo the lion. If we now turn at a right angle to facedue south, we see in the sky the constellation of Orion, with the stars in itsbelt reflecting exactly the later lay-out of the pyramids. It is as if thepyramid builders are leaving us a message to tell us not only when they builtthe Great Pyramid but, by implication, when their ancestors built the Sphinx.The southern ‘air shaft’ tells us when they built the Pyramid, and the alignmentof the pyramids, reflecting Orion’s Belt, tells us that they are directing ourattention to 10,500 BC, in the age of Leo.This still leaves us with the most puzzling question, however: in that case, whydid the Egyptians build the Sphinx in 10,500 BC, and the pyramids 8000 yearslater?The answer, according to Keeper of Genesis, is astronomical: that they had towait another 8000 years for some important event to occur in the sky. We shalldiscuss what this is in a moment.Meanwhile, it is clear that Bauval and Hancock’s thesis is highly controversial.They are stating that the original ‘priests’ came to Egypt some time before10,500 BC, that they knew all about precession, and they knew that Orion wouldreach its lowest point in the sky in 10,500. The Sphinx, facing due east, wasbuilt as a marker of the beginning of this new age.Then there arises the objection I discussed in Chapter 3. Are we really beingasked to believe that the ancient priests planned ahead 8000 years, and thencarried out their plan with such bravura? It sounds an unlikely proposition.Bauval and Hancock’s attempt to demonstrate it begins with one of the basicfacts about the ancient Egyptian mentality: that the ancients saw the land ofEgypt as an earthly counterpart of the sky, with the Milky Way as the Nile.Egypt was an image of heaven.And what was the basic aim of these priests and initiates who built the Sphinx?It was one that enables us to understand why Schwaller de Lubicz felt so at homein the mentality of ancient Egypt—the quest for immortality, that same quest inwhich the alchemists engaged in their attempts to create the philosophers’stone.The argument in Keeper of Genesis depends very much on Egyptian texts like TheBook of the Dead, the Pyramid texts, and The Book of What Is In the Duat. Theseoften tell us, with great precision, what we can infer from astronomy. The‘Duat’ is usually translated as ‘heaven’, but Bauval and Hancock make a strongcase for it referring to a specific part of heaven—that area where Orion andSirius could be seen on the ‘right bank’ of the Milky Way in 2500 BC. And it wasof importance only at the time of the summer solstice, when Sirius rose at dawn,and signalled the flooding of the Nile.The next important step in this argument concerns Zep Tepi, the first time, orrather, the place where this was supposed to have happened—we might call it theEgyptian Garden of Eden. This, it is clear from many texts, is situated in thearea of the Great Pyramids, and of the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis,just south of the Nile Delta. This is where Osiris and Isis ruled jointly,before Osiris’s brother Set—the god of darkness—murdered and dismembered him andscattered the parts of his body abroad. Isis succeeded in bringing themtogether, and in impaling herself on Osiris’s penis for long enough to beimpregnated. Their son was Horus, who would avenge his father (like Hamlet inthe later story).Geb, the father of Isis and Osiris, at first gave Set and Horus a half each ofthe kingdom of Egypt; then Geb changed his mind and gave it all to Horus,uniting the land of Egypt. This uniting of Upper and Lower Egypt happened,according to historians, in the time of King Menes, around 3000 BC. But theEgyptian myths clearly suggest that it took place at another time.The body of Osiris, which had been located in southern Egypt, has now floated upthe Nile, from his tomb in Abydos in the south, to ‘the land of Sokar’—the areaof Rostau (the ancient name for Giza) and Heliopolis in the north. Now, finally,Osiris can depart for his home in the kingdom of the skies in Orion. And he willdepart from Giza.When did this take place? The authors argue that the astronomical evidence givesthe date as 2500 BC.And where? According to Hancock, there is a pyramid painting of the land ofSokar, with corridors and passageways that remind us strongly of those of theGreat Pyramid. And of course, Bauval argues in The Orion Mystery that thepharaoh—identified with Osiris—took his departure from the King’s Chamber of theGreat Pyramid when the ‘ventilation shaft’ was pointing at Orion.Now consider. The cycle began—according to Bauval and Hancock—in 10,500 BC, whenOrion (Osiris) was at the nadir of its precessional cycle. And if Hancock iscorrect, these survivors of some great flood felt that the catastrophe markedthe end of an age—and, of course, the beginning of another. This next cyclewould last for 25,920 years, the half-cycle (when Orion begins to descend again)occurring in AD 2460.Let us make the admittedly far-fetched assumption that the astronomer-priestswho built the Sphinx in 10,500 BC also planned to build the pyramids in such away that their arrangement would reflect exactly the Belt of Orion, and soconvey an important message to some future age. The obvious question is: whenwould this building be done?Let us assume—what is now virtually a certainty—that these priests knew allabout precession of the equinoxes: that is, they knew that the equinoxes do notkeep occurring against the same constellation: that, like the hand of a clock,they slowly move around the constellations, taking 2200 years to move fromfigure to figure. (To complicate things, of course, the hand of this clock movesbackwards—which is why the phenomenon is called precession.) The most importantequinox is traditionally that which takes place in spring, at the beginning ofthe year—the vernal equinox. And the ‘vernal point’ is the precise spot in thezodiac the ‘hand’ is pointing to at the time. In 10,500 BC, that point was inLeo.Being skilled astronomers, these priests knew what would happen over the nextthousand or so years. First of all, the vernal point would move backwards, fromLeo to Cancer, then to Gemini, then to Taurus, until in our own age it would bein Pisces, about to enter Aquarius.As this happened, the body of Osiris—the constellation of Orion—would rise inthe sky, appearing to drift north up the right ‘bank’ of the Milky Way.Now obviously, a point would come when Osiris would reach ‘the land of Sokar’ inthe sky—the land where, down on the ground, the Sphinx had been built. And then,with the correct ceremonies, he could finally take up his proper place as thelord of the sky.So now, at last, was the time to build the great Temple of the Stars where thisceremony would reach its climax. And where was the vernal point at this time?Exactly where was the hand of the precessional clock pointing?Between 3000 and 2500 BC, the vernal point was on the ‘west’ bank of the MilkyWay, moving slowly past the head of the bull Taurus. This ‘head’ is formed by agroup of stars known as the Hyades, in which two stars stand out as thebrightest.If we now look down from the sky to its reflection in the land of Egypt, we seethe Nile and the ‘land of Sokar’, which includes Memphis, Heliopolis and Rostau(Giza). And if we look down today, at the place where those two bright stars ofthe Hyades are ‘reflected’, we also see two pyramids—the so-called ‘BentPyramid’ and the ‘Red Pyramid’ at Dahshur, built by the pharaoh Snofru, thefather of Cheops.Bauval and Hancock suggest, very reasonably, that Snofru built them in thatplace for a purpose—to signal the beginning of the great design.And where is Osiris (Orion) at this time? He has also arrived virtually in‘Sokar’. The vernal point and the constellation of Orion—and the star Sirius(Isis)—are now in the same area of the sky.It was not so in 10,500 BC. As you faced due east towards Leo—which is where thevernal point was situated—you had to turn through a full 90 degrees to look atOrion. Now, eight thousand years later, they have come together.This, say Bauval and Hancock, is why the Great Pyramid was built eight thousandyears after the Sphinx. The ‘heavens’ were finally ready for it. And their logicseems virtually irrefutable. Provided you agree that the ancient Egyptians knewall about precession—and no one now seriously doubts this—and that Orion wastheir most important constellation, then it is impossible to disagree that themoment when the vernal point moved into the same area as Orion was perhaps themost important moment in Egyptian history.What followed was the building of the pyramids at Rostau, with their arrangementpointing back clearly to the ‘first time’ in 10,500 BC.Then came the ceremony that the pharaoh now undertook to send Osiris back to hisproper home, which would also gain immortality for himself and for his people.This ceremony took place at the time of the dawn-rising of Sirius. But it beganten weeks earlier. Sirius was absent for seventy days below the horizon (due, ofcourse, to the fact that the earth is tilted on its axis). So, of course, wasits near neighbour Orion—Osiris.It seems highly probable that a ceremony to ‘rescue’ Osiris took place everyyear. But the ceremony that took place at the time of the summer solstice—theevent that announced the flooding of the Nile—in the year after the completionof the Great Pyramid, would have been climactic.The Horus-pharaoh—presumably Cheops—had to undertake a journey to bring hisfather Osiris back to life. In his form as the sun, he had to cross the greatriver—the Milky Way—in his solar boat, and journey to the eastern horizon, whereOsiris was held captive. In his form as the king, he had to cross the Nile in aboat, then journey to Giza, to stand before the breast of the Sphinx.Bauval and Hancock write:As the ‘son of Osiris’ he emerged from the womb of Isis, i.e. the star Sirius,at dawn on the summer solstice... It was then—and there—both at the sky-horizonand the earth ‘horizon’ that the Horus-King was meant to find himself in frontof the Gateway to Rostau. Guarding that Gateway on the earth-horizon he wouldencounter the giant figure of a lion—the Great Sphinx. And guarding that Gatewayin the sky-horizon his celestial counterpart would find—what?The answer, of course, is the constellation of Leo.The Pyramid texts explain that the beginning of the journey of Horus into theUnderworld occurred 70 days before the great ceremony. Twenty-five days later,the sun has crossed the ‘river’—the Milky Way—and is now moving east towards theconstellation of Leo. And 45 days later—the end of the 70 days—the sun isbetween the paws of Leo.On the ground, the pharaoh stands on the east bank of the Nile, crosses it inthe solar boat—perhaps the boat found buried near the Pyramid in 1954—then makeshis way, via the two pyramids at Dahshur, to the breast of the Sphinx.At this point, according to the texts, he has to face a ritual ordeal, ratherlike those of the Freemasons described in Mozart’s Magic Flute. He is given achoice of two ways, either by land or by water, by which he can journey to theUnderworld to rescue his father. The land route, the authors believe, was animmense causeway (of which there are still remains) linking the Valley Templewith the Great Pyramid. It was once roofed with limestone slabs and had starspainted on its ceiling.The ‘water route’ is still undiscovered—but the authors believe that it was anunderground corridor that was kept half filled (or perhaps more than half) withwater drawn by capillary action from the Nile. (They cite a French engineer, DrJean Kerisel, who suggests that the Sphinx may stand over a 700-metre-longtunnel leading to the Great Pyramid.)What happened next is pure conjecture—except that it must have ended with thereappearance of Orion and Sirius over the eastern horizon. Bauval and Hancockbelieve that this ceremony was the symbolic uniting of Upper and LowerEgypt—that is, of heaven and earth. Clearly, the priests who planned it saw itas the central event of Egyptian history after ‘the first time’.And who were these priests? Bauval and Hancock write:We shall argue that ‘serious and intelligent men’—and women too—were indeed atwork behind the stage of prehistory in Egypt, and propose that one of the manynames by which they were known was the ‘Followers of Horus’. We propose, too,that their purpose, to which their generations adhered for thousands of yearswith the rigour of a messianic cult, may have been to bring to fruition a greatcosmic blueprint.They go on to speak of the Temple of Edfu, parts of which date back to thePyramid Age, although its present form was built from 237 BC to 57 BC. Its‘Building Texts’ speak of earlier ages going back to the ‘First Time’, when thewords of the Sages were copied by the god Thoth into a book with the oddlymodern title Specifications of the Mounds of the Early Primeval Age, includingthe Great Primeval Mound itself, where the world was created. This mound isbelieved by Professor Iodden Edwards to be the huge rock on which the GreatPyramid was erected.According to the Building Texts, the various temples and mounds were designed bySeven Sages, including the ‘mansion of the god’ (presumably the GreatPyramid)—which would seem to support Bauval’s belief that the pyramids wereplanned (and perhaps partly constructed) at the same time as the Sphinx. TheSeven Sages were survivors of a catastrophic flood, and came from an island.These Seven Sages seem to be identical with ‘Builder gods’, ‘Senior ones’ and‘Followers of Horus’ (Shemsu Hor) referred to in other writings such as thePyramid Texts. The Followers of Horus were not gods, but humans who rebuilt theworld after the great catastrophe—which was predated by the Age of the Gods.This, then, is the basic thesis of Keeper of Genesis: that a group of priests,survivors of some catastrophe, virtually created ancient Egypt as we know it. Itcould be regarded as a sequel to Hamlet’s Mill, and Jane B. Sellers’ Death ofthe Gods in Ancient Egypt, which also argues powerfully that the ancientEgyptians knew all about precession. But it goes further than these books in itsmathematical and astronomical arguments (of which I have only had space topresent a crude outline). Its arguments about the astronomical alignments of theSphinx and the pyramids are a tour de force. Jane Sellers had already discusseda ‘precessional code’ of numbers, and Graham Hancock summarises her results inFingerprints of the Gods. But Bauval’s use of computer simulations raises allthis to a new level of precision, with the result that even those who feeldubious about the idea of a priestly succession lasting for thousands of yearswill have to admit that the mathematics seems uncontradictable.The authors reach one more interesting conclusion. Where precisely, they askedthe computer, was the vernal point situated in 10,500 BC? The answer was ‘thatit lay exactly 111.111 degrees east of the station that it had occupied at 2500BC. Then it had been at the head of the Hyades-Taurus, close to the right bankof the Milky Way; 8000 years earlier it lay directly under the rear paws of theconstellation of Leo.’And if this point has an ‘earthly double’, then it would seem to hint at someundiscovered secret below the rear paws of the Sphinx. The Coffin Texts speakabout ‘a sealed thing, which is in darkness, with fire about it, which containsthe efflux of Osiris, and is put in Rostau’. Could it be that ‘somethinghidden’—in a chamber under the rear paws of the Sphinx—is a ‘treasure’ that willtransform our knowledge of ancient Egypt? Edgar Cayce predicted the discovery ofa ‘Hall of Records’ beneath the Sphinx towards the end of the twentieth century,and Hancock and Bauval speculate whether this is not even now being investigatedby the team of ‘official Egyptologists’ who are the only ones permitted near theSphinx.So Keeper of Genesis—as is perhaps inevitable—ends on a question mark. For thereal question that lies behind this search into the remote past is: what does itall mean? We have to recognise that even the most precise knowledge of theEgyptian precessional code and their religion of resurrection still brings us nocloser to answering some of the most obvious questions about theirachievement—even one as straightforward as how they raised 200-ton blocks..."},{"pageContent":"10 THE THIRD FORCEIn Chapter 1, we saw that both Schwaller and Gurdjieff believed that the men oftoday have degenerated from their former level. Schwaller, obviously, wastalking about ancient Egypt, and the earlier civilisation from which it derivedits knowledge. But what was it that—according to Schwaller—made these men offormer times ‘giants’?What emerges clearly from his books is the idea that modern man has forgottensomething of central importance.Some notion of what he had in mind can be derived from the researches ofAmerican anthropologist Edward T. Hall, who spent much of his life working withor studying Native American Indians—Hopi, Navajo, Pueblo and Quiché (thedescendants of the Maya). His book The Dance of Life (1983) is about time, andabout the fact that the time system of the Indians is so totally different fromthat of American-Europeans (which he shortens to AE) that it is virtually adifferent kind of time. He notes that the Hopi do not even have a word for time,and that Hopi verbs have no tenses. They live in an ‘eternal present’,indifferent to western science, technology and philosophy. Hall coins the term‘polychronic time’ to distinguish this Native American ‘eternal present’ fromthe ‘monochronic’ time of western civilisation, with its ever-ticking clock.Religion is the central core of Hopi life. Religious ceremonies perform manyfunctions which in AE cultures are treated as separate and distinct entities,quite apart from the sacred: disciplining children, for example; encouragingrain and fertility; staying in sync with nature; helping the life-giving cropsto be fertile and to grow; relating to each other; and initiating the young intoadulthood. In fact, religion is at the center not only of social organisation,but also of government, which is part and parcel of Hopi ceremonial life.And the centre of this ceremonial is, of course, the dance. When a Hopi dance issuccessful, ‘all consciousness of external reality, all awareness of theuniverse outside, is obliterated. The world collapses, and is contained in thisone event...’Of course, the dance is not always successful; if some element of discordenters, it may be a failure. This underlines the fact that a Hopi dance is notsimply a formality, like hymns in a Christian church; it requires totalcommitment, and success can be felt, like the success of a work of art.Elsewhere in the book Hall emphasises that ‘for the Quiché, living a life issomewhat analogous to composing music, painting, or writing a poem. Each dayproperly approached can be either a work of art of a disaster... The Quichéreally do have to think deeply and seriously about the process of how each dayis to be lived.’ So the ‘law of productivity’ that drives western man, and whichis the measure of his achievement, seems alien to Native Americans, who feelthat a day properly lived is an achievement, even if it has not involved astroke of ‘productive work’.This, I would suggest, begins to explain to us what Schwaller and Gurdjieffmeant in stating that modern civilised man had ‘degenerated’. It is as if he hasstuck ear-plugs into his ears to protect him from city noise, and then forgottento take them out.We could express this, of course, by saying that the civilised city dweller is aleft brainer, and that the Hopi and Quiché are right brainers. It is true, ofcourse. But it gets us no closer to our objective—defining the mental world ofthe ancient Egyptians.As a first step, consider Hall’s description of a long ride he took with acompanion to bring his horses from New Mexico to Arizona.Our daily average was twelve to fifteen miles, otherwise the mustangs we wereriding would tire and ultimately give out. Dropping down from the fir-coveredslopes of the Jemez Mountains onto the parched plains of the west, I watched thesame mountain from different angles during three days, as it seemed to slowlyrotate while we passed by. Experiences of this sort give one a very differentfeeling than speeding by on a paved highway in one or two hours. The horse, thecountry, and the weather set the pace; we were in the grip of nature, withlittle control over the rate of progress.Later, riding horseback on a trek of three or four hundred miles, I discoveredit took a minimum of three days to adjust to the tempo and the more leisurelyrhythm of the horse’s walking gait...He is not speaking merely about relaxation, but about a different kind ofperception.Oddly enough, the ‘magician’ Aleister Crowley, who was in some ways a mostunadmirable character, knew about this. In 1920, an actress called Jane Wolffcame to visit Crowley in his rented villa at Cefalu. She proved to be highlycombative, and Crowley determined to teach her that he knew best. He told herthat she should begin her training in magic with a month’s meditation in a tentat the top of the cliff. When she flatly refused, he told her she was free toleave on the next boat. Finally, with anger and reluctance, she agreed to go andmeditate.During the next month she lived in the tent, wearing only a woollen robe, andliving on bread, grapes and water. During the first few days she was tense,resentful and uncomfortable. Then she became bored. But after the nineteenth dayshe suddenly plunged into a mood of ‘perfect calm, deep joy, and renewal ofstrength and courage’. Suddenly she understood what Crowley meant when he toldher that she had the sun, moon, stars, sky, sea and the universe to read andplay with. When the month was up, she left her tent reluctantly.Like Hall, she had switched from one mode of time to another. This is not simplya matter of relaxation—after all, when we are relaxed, the world may look moreor less the same as when we are tense. But what Hall—and Jane Wolff—experiencedwas a perception, a certainty, that the world is a richer and stranger placethan we realise.This also emerges in a story Hall tells about the Pueblo Indians (of whom D. H.Lawrence wrote in Mornings in Mexico). A new agricultural agent had spent asummer and winter working with the Indians, and seemed to be well-liked. Then,one day, he called on the superintendent of the agency, and admitted that theIndians seemed to have taken a dislike to him—he had no idea why. Thesuperintendent called on a religious leader of the Pueblos and asked him whathad gone wrong. All the Indian would say was: ‘He just doesn’t know certainthings.’After thinking about it, the superintendent suddenly realised what was wrong.In the spring, Mother Earth is pregnant, and must be treated gently. The Indiansremove the steel shoes from their horses; they don’t use their wagons or evenwear white man’s shoes because they don’t want to break the surface of theearth. The agricultural extension agent, not knowing about this and probably notthinking it important if he did, was trying his best to get the Indians to start‘early spring plowing’.Like most ‘civilised’ westerners, the agent no doubt regarded the notion of theearth as a pregnant mother as some kind of quaint superstition, failing torealise that for the Indians, it is not an idea or belief, but something theyfeel in their bones, so that an Indian’s relationship with the earth is asintimate as his relationship with his horse—or, for that matter, his wife. Toregard this as a ‘belief’ is to miss a whole dimension of reality.We can also see that the ancient Egyptian must have felt precisely this abouthis relationship with the earth, and with the Nile that enabled him to stayalive by flooding it every time Sothis returned to the dawn sky. It was not amatter of superstition, but of a deeply experienced relationship with the earthand the heavens, a relationship that could be felt as distinctly as the middaysun or a cold wind. Egypt was, as Schwaller is never tired of pointing out, asacred society.Hall’s understanding of this relationship becomes increasingly clear as he talksabout the Quiché Indians and their sense of time. Inheritors of the Mayacalendar system, they live simultaneously by two calendars, one secular and onereligious. Their ordinary calendar—as we know—is the same Julian calendar thatthe ancient Egyptians used, of 360 days with five days ‘spare’. Their sacredcalendar has 260 days made up of various periods. The two calendars interlock,so they return to ‘square one’ every 52 years, when the sacred calendar hasrepeated itself 73 times. When a normal year is over, the sacred calendar iswell into its second year; so it could be said to go on turning endlessly, likea wheel.Each day, Hall explains, has special characteristics—just as, in ancient Egypt(according to Schwaller) each hour had its special neters—and it takes a special shaman-diviner to provide a proper interpretation of theday. This is particularly important when critical decisions are contemplated.Not only does each of the twenty days have a proper name and character that isdivine, but also a number. The ‘nature’ of the days change depending on thenumerical accompaniment, as well as the actions or moves contemplated duringthat particular day. A ‘good’ day in one context may be bad in another. Thereare favourable and unfavourable combinations, and it is the combination thatdetermines how the day should be interpreted.Again, it is important to realise that all this is quite distinct from a‘belief’. The ‘right-brain’ state of mind permits deeper perception. Forexample, ‘an important feature of Quiché divination is the use of the body assender, receiver and analyser of messages’. So a Quiché shaman feels the pulsein different parts of the patient’s body in order to reach a diagnosis andeffect a cure. It sounds—as Hall admits—‘hogwash’, yet it works. And Hall goeson to tell a story of a psychoanalyst who also learned to use his body as areceiver and analyser of messages. He was dealing with a seductive but veryviolent female patient who might try to smash his skull with some heavy objectwithout warning. The assaults occurred when the psychoanalyst was most relaxedand trusting. Then he noticed that his own pulse rate was giving him warning ofthe attacks; it began to increase a few seconds in advance. All he had to do wasto make sure he paid attention to it, and he was ready to ward off the blow. Hewas picking up some kind of signal—telepathic or otherwise—and his pulse actedas an alarm clock.It is because there is a ‘telepathic’ (or ‘collective unconscious’) element inthe lives of Native Americans that they recognise the importance of thought.Hall explains that when the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico plan to build a house,they wait until the ‘right thoughts’ are present. ‘The Pueblos believe thatthoughts have a life of their own, and that these live thoughts are an integralpart of any man-made structure, and will remain with that structure forever.Thoughts are as essential an ingredient as mortar and bricks. Something donewithout the right thoughts is worse than nothing.’This is obviously part and parcel of the attitude that makes the Hopi put suchimmense effort into the sacred dance, in an effort to ensure that it is‘successful’. They recognise that there is a subtle sense in which humanthoughts, human attitudes, imprint themselves on what we do. In traditionalmagic—for example, Tibetan—there is a belief that ‘thought forms’ can be broughtinto existence by a long effort of concentration. (In Tibet they are calledtulpas.) Such thought-forms may be benevolent or otherwise.But Hall also points out that the ‘right thoughts’ that are needed to build ahouse are not simply those of its future owner, but of everyone concerned in thebuilding. It is essentially a joint venture. ‘When a Pueblo Indian builds ahouse, it reaffirms the group.’ Again, we sense that the Pueblo Indians share a‘collective unconscious’ like that of Cordova’s Amahuaca Indians of Brazil, andthat it is quite unlike the compartmentalised mind of the ‘AE’ westerner. Our‘left-brain’ consciousness strands us in a far more bleak and boring universethan the Indian.If we can grasp this, we can see that it is not a question of Indian credulity,but that we suffer from what William James called ‘a certain blindness in humanbeings’. The AE westerner lacks a sense that the Indian possesses, just as ablind man lacks a sense possessed by a man who can see.This sense, Hall argues, is due to the Indian slowing-down of time. We all havesome conception of this—for example, the way that, under the rightcircumstances, a glass of wine or whisky can relax us and make everything lookmore real and interesting. This enables us to understand how our ‘left-brain’time has the effect of making things slightly unreal. What is so hard for us tounderstand is that a long period of ‘right-brain’ time can make us aware ofanother reality. Hall likes to remind us ‘that this reality... exists assomething distinct from what I or anyone else says or thinks’.What is so important about The Dance of Life is that it makes us aware that the‘other’ way of perceiving the world is not some vague and ‘occult’ concept, buta reality that can be studied scientifically. Hall’s colleague William Condoncame to this conclusion via a study of philosophy—specifically Husserl’sphenomenology. Husserl was concerned to deny the view that has become acornerstone of western philosophy: that meaning is ‘in the mind’. Condon wrote:‘There is a genuine coherence among the things we perceive and think about, andthis coherence is not something we create, but something we discover.’Condon got hold of a 4½-second clip of film made by Gregory Bateson of a familyeating dinner, and realised that by studying it closely, he could discover allkinds of things about the family and its relationships. He was so fascinatedthat he spent a year and a half running the film over and over again until hewore out 130 copies of it.Hall pursued the same method. He shot some footage of a film of the Indianmarket in the plaza in Santa Fe, then studied it frame by frame, astonished byhow much it revealed of the different attitudes of the Indians, theSpanish-Americans and the Anglo-Americans. One 30-second shot of a middle-classAmerican woman talking to a Pueblo Indian woman behind a stall was a mini-dramain itself, as the American woman held out her arm, her finger pointed like arapier, in the face of the Indian, until the Indian turned her head away, anunmistakeable look of disgust on her face. Later, Hall asked unprepared studentsto, watch the footage without telling them what to look for. Usually it tookdays, while the bewildered and bored student stared at the film in a state ofawful frustration—until, suddenly, it broke through. Once it had broken through,the student could discern endless depths of meaning in the film. Like Crowley’s‘student’ Jane Wolff, a new level of perception had suddenly emerged.Hall points out that this kind of perception is natural to Japanese culture, andcan be found in the Zen tradition, which attempts to create insight by the samemethod of ‘frustration’. It is not simply a new level of perception thatemerges, but a new level of doing and being. Eugen Herrigel describes in Zen inthe Art of Archery how his teacher taught him to allow ‘it’—the ‘other self’—tofire the arrow. Herrigel’s teacher fired his arrow down a long, dark hall, withonly a candle illuminating the target, and still split a target arrow in two.St Augustine said: ‘What is time? When I do not think about the question, I knowthe answer.’ This is essentially the principle of Zen, and the principle thatunderlies the lives of the Hopi, Navajo, Pueblo and Quiché described by Hall.In the last section of the book, Hall speaks about Cro-Magnon man, and aboutAlexander Marshack’s discoveries of the ‘moon-marks’ on the 35,000-year-oldbone, as well as about the stone circles studied by Thom and Gerald Hawkins. Andit is at that point, as he speaks of the essential continuity of their cultureand that of the Native American Indians, that it becomes clear that he has inmind a completely different kind of evolution from Darwin’s survival of thefittest.In one of the most important pages of The Dance of Life, Hall describes how oneof his students decided to film children in a playground. To avoid making themself-conscious, the student filmed them from an abandoned car. When he viewedthe result, it at first seemed disappointing—just children playing. But afterrepeated viewings at different speeds—which was part of the technique taught byHall—he observed that one lively little girl seemed to be affecting everybodyelse in the playground. As she skipped and danced and twirled, her rhythmsseemed to be conveyed to every group she approached.After watching it dozens of times, the student began to sense an underlyingbeat, as if watching a kind of ballet. Moreover, the beat struck him asfamiliar. He called on a friend who was a rock enthusiast, and asked him towatch the film. After a while, the friend took a cassette from a nearby shelf.When played alongside the film, the children seemed to be dancing to the rockmusic, as if it had been specially written for them. ‘Not a beat, not a frame,was out of sync.’ What had happened, Hall thinks, is that the children weredancing and playing to some basic musical beat of life, which the composer hadalso ‘plucked out of the air of the time’. Which is why Hall uses for thischapter the title of the whole book, ‘The Dance of Life’. There is, he believes,some basic rhythm of life—a quite definite rhythm, which could be defined inmusical terms—to which our modern left-brain awareness leaves us deaf.Now this, clearly, is what Schwaller is talking about in the chapter of SacredScience called ‘Magic, Sorcery, Medicine’. ‘The higher animals, as well as thehuman animal, are totally bathed in a psychic atmosphere which establishes thebond between the individuals, a bond as explicit as the air which is breathed byall living things... Every living being is in contact with all the rhythms andharmonies of all the energies in his universe.’But is there any way to turn this rather vague and abstract statement intosomething more concrete and down to earth? After all, harmonies and rhythms canbe measured in the physicist’s laboratory, and described in terms of amplitudeor wavelength. Can we not be more precise about them?This is a question which, almost by accident, came to preoccupy anex-advertising salesman named Michael Hayes.Ever since late childhood—spent in Penzance, Cornwall, where his mother owned ahotel—Hayes had been preoccupied with the question of why we are alive, and whatwe are supposed to do now we are here.In 1971, at the age of 22, he went to live in Mashad, Iran, where his brotherwas in the senior management of an international trading company. These were theyears before the Shah was deposed, when Iran was still swarming with hippies.During his seven years in Iran, Mike Hayes—as he prefers to be known—took theopportunity to travel to India, Pakistan, Kathmandu and Afghanistan. It wasduring this time that he was introduced by a hippie friend to the ideas ofGurdjieff—via Ouspensky’s In Search of the Miraculous— and began to think morepurposefully about the basic problems of human nature.In Mashad he had been deeply impressed by the great mosque of Imam Reza. It wasobvious from the sheer number of worshippers, and their devoutness, that forthem religion was a living reality, as it had been for the cathedral builders ofthe Middle Ages. And travelling in India and Pakistan, were he had a chance tocome into contact with Hinduism and Buddhism, he again had this sense of thetremendous vitality of the religious tradition. It took him by surprise for,apart from hymns at school and an occasional visit to church, his childhood hadnot been particularly religious. The sheer size of these religious territoriesimpressed him, and the effect of the religious founders on their followers. ‘...I decided that there was very definitely something supernatural about all this.Whoever they were, these “saviours” of mankind certainly knew how to make theirpresences felt.’Back in England, he felt that it was time to catch up on his education, which hecould now see had been less than thorough. He signed on for a course inextramural studies at Leicester University, and it was there that he attendedsome classes on DNA and the genetic code.DNA is, of course, a thread-like material in living cells which carries geneticinformation, such as whether a baby is born with brown or blond hair, blue orbrown eyes, and so on. It transmits this information by means of a code, whichwas finally cracked in the early 1950s by James Watson and Francis Crick. Theyshowed that the DNA molecule has a spiral structure, and looks rather like twospiral ladders held together by rungs made of four chemical ‘bases’ calledadenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. These bases are strung together in whatlooks like a random order—perhaps AGTTCGGAA—but it is the order of these basesthat makes the difference between brown hair and blond hair, etc. When a cellsplits into two—which is how it reproduces—the ‘ladder’ comes apart, and eachhalf attracts to itself various molecules of the bases that are floating free,until there are now two identical ladders. This is how living things reproducethemselves.It was when he learned that 64 is the number in which the four bases can forminto triplet units called RNA codons that Mike Hayes had a vague sense of déjàvu. The number 64 awoke vague memories. The same thing happened when he learnedthat these codons correspond with the twenty amino acids necessary for themanufacture of protein—but since there are also two which are the codedinstruction for ‘start’ and ‘stop’, the basic number is 22. This again seemedvaguely familiar.Then he remembered where he had come across the number 64—in the I-Ching, theChinese Book of Changes, which is used as an oracle. And the basic unit of theI-Ching is, of course, a ‘triplet’ of lines, either broken or unbroken,corresponding to the principles of Yin and Yang, which might be regarded asdarkness and light, or the male and female principles, or the moon and the sun.— — ———— — ———— — ———— — ———— — ———Hayes recalled that when he had studied the I-Ching in his hippie days, he hadwondered vaguely why the number of its ‘hexagrams’ (each one made up of twotrigrams) should be 64—eight times eight—and not seven times seven or nine timesnine. And now he learned that each of the triplet units of RNA links up withanother triplet in the DNA molecule. So the ‘double helix’ of information in theheart of all reproductive cells is made up from 64 hexagrams, as in the I-Ching.Could this really be just coincidence?Since his extramural course left him with time to kill, he began looking moreclosely into this ‘coincidence’. Of course, it seemed unlikely that Fu Hsi, thelegendary creator of the I-Ching, had stumbled upon some kind of mysticalinsight into the ‘code of life’. But it seemed worth investigating.If it was not coincidence, then there should be eight trigrams hidden in DNA.And when he learned that this was so, Mike Hayes began to feel that he hadstumbled upon something that could be very important indeed.Then he recalled where he had seen the number 22. This was nothing to do withthe I-Ching, but with Pythagoras, the Greek ‘father of mathematics’. ThePythagoreans regarded the number 22 as sacred because it represented threemusical octaves, and the Pythagoreans saw music as one of the basic secrets ofthe universe. Of course, an ordinary musical scale has seven notes—doh, re, mi,fa, so, la, ti—and a final doh of the next octave completes it and begins thenext octave. But three octaves—and the Pythagoreans also attached a mysticalsignificance to the number three—begins on doh, and ends on another doh 22 noteslater.Mike Hayes had played the guitar since his early teens, so knew a certain amountof musical theory. In the quest that followed, it proved to be of centralimportance.But at this early stage, in the late seventies, a suspicion was beginning toform in his mind: that these numbers involved in the DNA code might express somebasic law of the universe. He was in the position of Edward T. Hall’s studentwho realised that the children in the playground were dancing to some basicrhythm of life, a rhythm that is totally unsuspected by the rest of us. MikeHayes came to believe that rhythm is basically musical in nature. And this, inturn, meant that he was a kind of Pythagorean.Pythagoreanism is sometimes called ‘number mysticism’, and Pythagoras attachedgreat importance to the numbers three and seven, and to the laws governingmusical notes. Gurdijieff had also spoken of the ‘Law of Three’ and the ‘Law ofSeven’. The Law of Three states that all creation involves a ‘third force’. Weare inclined to think in terms of dualities: positive and negative, male andfemale, good and evil. Gurdjieff—who derived the idea from the Sankhyaphilosophy of India—stated that, instead, we should try to think in terms ofthree. Positive and negative merely counterbalance one another, but if anythingis to come of them, they must be given a push by a third force. An obviousexample would be the catalyst in a chemical reaction. Oxygen and sulphur dioxidedo not naturally combine; but if passed over hot platinised asbestos, they formsulphur trioxide, from which sulphuric acid is made. The platinised asbestosremains unchanged.Another simple example would be a zip. The left and right side of the zip needthe fastener in the middle to make them combine.But perhaps Gurdjieff’s most interesting illustration is of someone who wishesto change, to achieve greater self-knowledge, and in whom the forces of lazinessact as a counterbalance. In this case, the breakthrough can occur throughknowledge—a perception of how it can be achieved, which brings a new drive andoptimism. In other words, the third force is a kind of kick, an outside forcethat alters the balance of a situation, breaks a deadlock.The Law of Seven is illustrated by the seven notes of the musical scale; herethe final doh somehow draws them together so they can move on to a higheroctave. Again, the seven colours of the spectrum are ‘drawn together’ into whitelight.When Mike Hayes began to study the major world religions, he was struck by howoften the numbers three, seven and 22 recur. The legendary founder of Hermeticphilosophy—identified with the Egyptian God Thoth—is known as Thrice GreatHermes. The number pi—the relation of the diameter of a circle to itscircumference—which was supposed to have been discovered by Pythagoras, is 22divided by seven.In the story of Noah’s Ark, Noah is told by God to build an ark and take onboard two pairs of every animal and bird. After seven days it begins to rain.When the flood starts to subside, Noah sends a raven to see what is happening.It fails to return, and after seven days, he sends a dove, which is unable tofind land. After another seven days, Noah sends the dove again, which returnswith an olive branch in its beak (the olive branch which has become the symbolof the most important of third forces—reconciliation). After another seven dayshe releases the dove again, and this time it fails to return, having found land.Those who know their Bible will recall that there seems to be a contradictionabout the number of animals. In 6:19, God tells Noah to take two of everycreature on board. In 7:2 this has become seven pairs of ‘clean’ animals andonly two of the unclean ones. But in verse 8, Noah goes on board with only twopairs of each. In fact, it hardly makes sense to take seven pairs of animals onboard. Which suggests that the seven was inserted by some scribe simply in orderto bring the ‘magical’ seven into the text. The same could also be true ofNoah’s age, 600—the beginning of his seventh century.Hayes points out that the story contains three periods of seven days—except thatthere is also a day when the dove returns, unable to find land, which brings thetotal to 22. The rainbow, the symbol of God’s reconciliation, has, of course,seven colours.The same number mysticism can be seen in the Hebrew sacred lamp-stand known atthe menorah, which has six branches on either side, with three cups on each,making eighteen. You would expect the central stem (the seventh) to have anotherthree cups, making 21. Instead, it has four, making 22. Twenty-two cups dividedby seven branches—the number pi.Pythagoras also attached peculiar importance to a figure he called thetetrad—ten pebbles arranged in the form of a triangle.** ** * ** * * *Pythagoras regarded this figure as a symbol of the supernatural, and Hayes seesit as a symbol of evolutionary ascent, with the topmost pebble as a symbol—liketop doh—of the upward movement to a higher level (Plato calls the tetrad ‘themusic of the spheres’). From the tetrad Pythagoras derives two more sacrednumbers: ten (for the number of pebbles) and four (for the number of lines).Hayes goes on to demonstrate how the symbol of the tetrad also occurs repeatedlyin religion and Hermeticism. For example, a commentary on the Koran called theTafsir describes the Prophet’s visit to the seven heavens, which begins withMohammed mounting a quadruped which is neither donkey nor mule, then entering amosque and lowering his head three times in prayer, after which the angelGabriel offers him two vessels, one full of wine, one full of milk, and after hehas chosen the milk, conducts him to the first heaven. So we have thequadruped—number four—followed by bowing the head three times, followed by thetwo vessels, followed by the first heaven—the numbers forming a tetrad. Thequadruped is also symbolic; being neither donkey nor mule, it symbolises thethird force or manifestation, so leading to the next line of the tetrad, thethree. The two vessels of wine and milk are also symbolic, the milk symbolisinggentleness, kindness (the Chinese yin principle) as against the more positiveand assertive wine.The results of Mike Hayes’s decade of study of religion were finally writtendown in a book called The Infinite Harmony, in which separate sections deal withancient Egypt, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, Buddhism (with its eightfoldpath), Confucianism, Christianity and Islam, as well as a chapter on alchemy andthe Hermetic code, one on the I-Ching, and one on the genetic code. His basicargument is that the musical octave, together with the Law of Three and the Lawof Seven, express some basic code of life and the law governing evolution. Andhe demonstrates that these numbers turn up with bewildering frequency in theworld’s great religions (the Book of Revelation seems to be particularly full ofnumber symbolism and musical symbolism).Inevitably, the reader begins to wonder whether all this merely demonstrates theauthor’s determination to make the numbers fit the facts—for example, I foundmyself wondering why God made it rain for 40 days and 40 nights, rather than theseven or eight or 22 that might be expected (although the answer could lie inmultiplying the two numbers of the tetrad, four and ten). Yet even accepting hisargument at its lowest level, there can be no possible doubt about the strangerecurrence of the numbers three and seven and eight throughout world religions,as if they all incorporate some musical principle.But this, of course, is only the foundation of Hayes’s argument. Its essence isthe notion that the ‘Hermetic code’ is also an evolutionary code—it is somethingto do with the way life manifests itself, and attempts continually to move to ahigher level. Hayes believes that what he has glimpsed is something very likethe ‘rhythm of life’ seen by Hall’s student in the film of the schoolchildren:the same hidden rhythm by which the Hopi and the Navajo and the Quiché stillregulate their lives, and which the priests of ancient Egypt recognised as thecreative force of Osiris.In fact, the chapter on Egypt and the Great Pyramid is particularly convincingbecause—as we have seen—there can be little doubt that the Egyptians set outdeliberately to encode their knowledge—such as the size of the earth. In somecases, it is hard to know precisely what the Egyptians were trying to tell us.We learn, for example, that in the antechamber to the King’s Chamber, there is asquare granite relief whose area is exactly equal to the area of a circle, whosediameter happens to be the precise length of the antechamber floor. Moreover,when this length is multiplied by pi, the result is precisely the length of thesolar year—365.2412 pyramid inches. It is difficult to understand why thearchitect of the Pyramid wanted to transmit this information, or to whom. On theother hand, it seems that the off-centre niche in the Queen’s Chamber, which hasalso baffled most writers on the Pyramid, is precisely one sacred cubit offcentre, as if the architect was trying to tell us precisely what basic measurehe was using. So the other encoded information may be just as practical.Hayes also argues convincingly for the Egyptian knowledge of pi (which, we mayrecall, was supposed to have been discovered two thousand years later byPythagoras). He cites, for example, a decree which appoints a certain highpriest Director of all 22 nomes (districts) of Upper Egypt. Later, when the sonis appointed, he is only Director of seven nomes. The symbolism seems to beobvious: father over son, 22 over seven.He also points out the association of the Great Pyramid with the ‘Magic Squareof Hermes’, 2080, which happens to be the sum of all the numbers from 1 to64—the number of the I-Ching and the genetic code.Schwaller de Lubicz’s years studying the Temple of Luxor left him in no doubt ofits incredibly precise symbolism. His major work, The Temple of Man (not to beconfused with the smaller Temple in Man, also about Luxor) demonstrates beyondall doubt that the Luxor temple symbolises a human being, with various chamberscorresponding precisely to various organs. Here again, the architect enjoyedplaying with number codes, many of which Schwaller is able to decipher in thecourse of the three volumes. An ancient Egyptian mystic would no doubt havefound the Temple, like the Great Pyramid, an amazing and continuous revelation.But in spite of Schwaller’s decoding, most of its meaning is now lost to, us.As we have seen, Mike Hayes’s starting point was his observation of the oddsimilarity between the genetic code and the I-Ching.The I-Ching is, of course, a book of ‘oracles’, which is consulted for advice.This certainly sounds like pure superstition. But the psychologist Carl Jung,who launched the book upon the modern world by introducing Richard Wilhelm’stranslation in 1951, believed there was more to it than that. He argued thatthere is a hidden truth behind the I-Ching which he called synchronicity (in asmall book of that title), an ‘acausal connecting principle’.The I-Ching is consulted either by throwing down three coins six times, andnoting the preponderance of heads or tails (tails for yin—a broken line—andheads for yang, an unbroken line). It can also be consulted by a method using 50yarrow stalks, of which one is thrown aside, leaving 49, which we note is seventimes seven. So it would seem that one method is based on the Law of Three, theother on the Law of Seven.It must be borne in mind that when the Book of Changes first came into being, itwas not a ‘book’, but merely two lines, a broken and an unbroken one, meaningrespectively no and yes, and the questioner threw down the coins (or divided theyarrow stalks) only once. It seems to have struck the legendary inventor of theI-Ching, the sage Fu Hsi (believed to have lived in the third millennium BC),that the two lines can change their nature, becoming their opposite. Fu Hsiarranged the lines into trigrams, then hexagrams. He began with Ken, ‘keepingstill, the mountain’. Then he contemplated these hexagrams, conceiving them asnets of forces, and tried to envisage the meaning of the changes within them. Atthat stage it was an exercise in pure intuition. Most of the hexagrams wereprobably not even named. A slightly later version of the hexagrams began withK’un, ‘the receptive’.In about 1000 BC, King Wen had been imprisoned by the tyrant Chou Hsin, and itwas there, after a vision in which he saw the hexagrams arranged in a circle,that he arranged them in their present form, beginning with the masculinehexagram Ch’ien, ‘the creative’, and adding commentaries. Wen was rescued by hisson, who overthrew the tyrant, and Wen became ruler. Confucius added morecommentaries about five hundred years later.So the I-Ching began purely as symbols, contemplated for their inner meaning.This is clearly how Jung saw them.The Swiss philosopher Jean Gebser notes (in his magnum opus The Ever PresentOrigin, 1949) that ‘the revision of the former book of oracles into a book ofwisdom... indicates the decisive fact that around 1000 BC man began to awaken toa diurnal, wakeful consciousness’, which suggests that in China, as in theMediterranean, some fundamental change in the nature of human consciousness hadappeared.It is only towards the end of The Dance of Life that Edward T. Hall mentions thename of Jung, whose idea of the collective unconscious seems to flow like anundercurrent through the book. Hall is also speaking about synchronicity—whichhe sees as a form of ‘entrainment’ (a term invented by William Condon, whichmeans what happens when one person picks up another’s rhythm—in other words,sympathetic vibration). Hall sees synchronicity as a type of entrainment, inwhich events are experienced simultaneously by two people in different places.He cites a story about Jung, who was on a train, feeling oddly depressed as hethought about a patient with severe marital problems. At a certain point in thisgloomy meditation, Jung happened to check his watch—and later learned that thepatient had committed suicide at that exact moment.But of course, this is not all Jung means by synchronicity. Neither are Hall’spersonal examples of a colleague ringing him with information that he neededurgently, or of experiencing ‘in my own body sensations that were present insomeone else’s body’. These could be explained by some kind of telepathy. Manyexamples of synchronicity cited by Jung are of coincidences so preposterous thatthey sound like fiction. A typical example concerns the French poet ÉmileDeschamps, who was given a piece of plum pudding by a certain M. Fortgibu whenhe was a boy. Ten years later, he saw some plum pudding in the window of a Parisrestaurant, and went in to ask if he could have some—only to be told that it hadbeen ordered by M. Fortgibu. Many years later, he was invited to a meal thatincluded plum pudding, and remarked that all that was wanting was M. Fortgibu.As he said this, M. Fortgibu walked in—he had come to the wrong address.Jung comments that ‘either there are physical processes which cause psychichappenings, or there is a pre-existent psyche which organises matter.’ What isimplied is that such coincidences happen when the mind is in a state of harmonyand balance. This is perfectly illustrated by a story told to Jung by his friendRichard Wilhelm, translator of the I-Ching. Wilhelm was in a remote Chinesevillage that was suffering from drought, and a rainmaker was sent for from adistant village. The man asked for a cottage on the outskirts of the village,and vanished into it for three days. At the end of that time, there was atremendous, downpour, followed by snow. Wilhelm asked the old man how he haddone it; the old man replied that he hadn’t. ‘I come from a region whereeverything is in order. It rains when it should rain, and is fine when it isneeded. But the people in this village are all out of Tao and out of themselves.I was at once infected when I arrived, so I asked for a cottage on the edge ofthe village, so I could be alone. When I was once more in Tao, it rained.’The story seems to be a perfect example of what Hall means when he speaks of theIndians’ harmony with nature. It is also an example of the harmony referred toin the title of Hayes’s The Infinite Harmony—the harmony that Confucius, and LaoTse, the founder of Taoism, regarded as the essence of ‘right living’.Yet we are still faced with the puzzling and totally illogical notion of abook—made of paper and printer’s ink—answering questions. One obviouspossibility would be that the questions are answered by ‘spirits’, rather aswith a Ouija board. But apparently the Chinese do not accept this notion. Jungexplains their view by saying that ‘whatever happens in a given moment possessesinevitably the quality peculiar to that moment’, and mentions a wine connoisseurwho can tell from the taste of the wine the exact location of its vineyard, andantique dealers who can name the time and place where a certain objet d’art wasmade; he even adds the risky analogy of an astrologer who can tell you merely bylooking at you the sign you were born under and the rising sign at the time ofyour birth.The I-Ching, then, may either be regarded as some kind of living entity, or as akind of ready reckoner which is able to inform the questioner of the exactmeaning of the hexagram he has obtained. It is, at all events, based upon thenotion that there is no such thing as pure chance.This notion sounds preposterous, but seems to be supported by quantum physics,in which the observer somehow alters the event he is observing. For example, abeam of light shone through a pinhole will cause a small circle of light toappear on a screen (or photographic plate) behind it. If two pinholes are openedside by side, there are two interlinked circles of light, but the portion thatoverlaps has a number of dark lines, due to the ‘interference’ of the two beams,which cancel one another out. If the beam is now dimmed, so that only one photonat a time can pass through, you would expect the interference lines to disappearwhen the plate is finally developed, for one photon cannot interfere withanother. Yet the interference lines are still there. But if we ‘watch’ thephotons with a photon detector, to find out what is happening at the holes, theinterference pattern disappears...Jung seems to be suggesting that, in the same way, our minds affect the patternsof the real world, unconsciously ‘fixing’ the results. I have describedelsewhere1 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark20] how, when I began to write anarticle on synchronicity, the most absurd synchronicities began to occur. Themost preposterous of these was as follows. I described how a friend, JacquesVallee, had been seeking information on the biblical prophet Melchizedek(pronounced ‘Mel-kizzy-dek’), because he was interested in a Los Angelesreligious sect called the Order of Melchizedek. He could find very little. Butwhen he took a taxi to Los Angeles airport, and asked the taxi driver for areceipt, she gave him one signed ‘M. Melchizedek’. Thinking that perhaps therewere hundreds of Melchizedeks in Los Angeles, he looked in the vast telephonedirectory, which runs to several volumes. There was only one Melchizedek—histaxi driver.After I had finished writing this story, I broke off to take my dogs for a walk.On the camp bed in my basement, I noticed a book that I did not recognise; itwas called You Are Sentenced to Life, by W. D. Chesney, a Los Angeles doctor,and I knew it was my book because I had sent it to be bound. (My house containsover 20,000 books, so it is easy to lose track.) When I came back from my walk Iopened it—and found myself looking at a page headed ‘Order of Melchizedek’—acopy of a letter from the founder of the Order to the author of the book. I feltmy hair prickle. It was as if some fate had whispered in my ear: ‘If you thinkJacques Vallee’s story is the strangest synchronicity you’ve ever heard of, howabout this?’ It was as if synchronicity was setting out to convince me of itsreality.How can we explain synchronicities? Unless we dismiss them as ‘pure chance’, weare forced to Jung’s conclusion that the mind plays a more active part informing reality than we realise. Or, as Jung put it, ‘there is a pre-existentpsyche that organises matter.’This is clearly very close to the views of the Hopi and Navajo Indians asdescribed by Hall—the feeling that our mental attitudes influence nature and thematerial world, so that, for example, a house cannot be built until the buildershave created ‘right thoughts’. The Indians feel that their minds can influencethe future of the house, just as, according to Jung, our minds influence thefall of the coins in consulting the I-Ching.Mike Hayes would express it slightly differently. He would say that the basicenergies of which the universe is made are constructed of vibrations that obeythe laws of music; therefore events follow these ‘hidden laws’.A simple example may clarify the point. Try asking someone to write down histelephone number, then to write down the same number with its digits jumbled up.Now tell him to subtract the smaller number from the larger one, and to addtogether the digits of the answer until they become one single number (i.e. 783will become 18, then 9). You can tell him that the answer is nine. This isbecause the answer is always nine. It works with the biggest or smallestnumbers.I am not enough of a mathematician to know why it is so, but I know that it isnot ‘magic’—merely the laws of arithmetic. Jung would say that synchronicitiesare the operation of similar laws of reality. Mike Hayes would add that thoselaws are basically musical in nature.So what may appear to be primitive ‘magic’ may be merely a recognition of theselaws of ‘chance’.An example was witnessed by television reporter Ross Salmon in the late 1970s.He was visiting the Calawaya Indians of Lake Titicaca, and learned that, whilethe medicine man had gone to the city to earn money, his wife Wakchu wassuspected of being unfaithful to him. A council of local women and a council ofelders was undecided about her guilt, so the priests announced that they would‘call the condor’ to decide the matter. The Calawayas believe that human beingsare reincarnated as condors, and that the ‘Great Condor’ is a reincarnation of agreat Inca leader.Salmon was allowed to film the ceremony at the top of a sheer cliff, as thepriests performed their ritual to summon the condor, throwing coco leaves intothe air and chanting. The next day, Wakchu was taken to the site, and tied to apost, stripped to her loincloth. Salmon was quite convinced that nothing wouldhappen. But after half an hour, a condor appeared, flew around overhead, thenlanded on a rock facing Wakchu. It sat there for a time, then stepped right upin front of the girl and pointed its beak up at her. The elders cried:‘Guilty—she must take her own life.’ If Salmon had any doubts about thegenuineness of the ceremony, they vanished ten days later when the girl flungherself from a high cliff.All this was shown on Westward Television, with Salmon's commentary. When hewrote a book about his travels, In Search of Eldorado, I hastened to buy it, sothat I could quote his description. To my surprise, he only told half the story,making it altogether more ambiguous. When I saw him subsequently, I asked himwhy this was, and he explained that scientists had advised him to ‘water itdown’, because he had obviously been tricked. Yet the film left no doubtwhatsoever that he had not been tricked.Here, it seems, the condor was ‘called’ in much the same way as the porpoises inSir Arthur Grimble’s account, and then played the part of the oracle, indicatingthe girl’s guilt. No ‘rational’ explanation can cover the facts (short ofcheating on the part of the priests); but Hopi Indians or the natives of theGilbert Islands would certainly find nothing unbelievable about the events.Ross Salmon also mentions that he spoke to two tribes of Indians in theBolivia-Colombia area, both illiterate, but with endless events stored in theirmemory, and that they both told him that man had been on earth far longer thananyone suspects.Sir Wallis Budge begins his book Egyptian Magic (1899) by explaining thatEgyptian religion has two sides. ‘On the one it closely resembles in manyrespects the Christian religion of today, and on the other the religion of manyof the sects which flourished in the first three or four centuries of ourera...’ This latter aspect, he explains, ‘represents a collection of ideas andsuperstitions which belong to a savage or semisavage state of existence ... Wemay think that such ideas and beliefs are both childish and foolish, but thereis no possible reason for doubting that they were very real things to those whoheld them.’Budge was, of course, a late Victorian—which explains the patronising tone, andthe strange suggestion (no doubt meant to reassure his readers) that Egyptianreligion is not unlike Christianity. He sees the Egyptians from a thoroughlywestern standpoint, and often speaks about their belief in ‘God’. The magicalstories he tells are all preposterous—about magicians who can cut off heads andthen restore them, so the subject of the experiment remains unharmed. (He eventells a story from Apuleius’s Golden Ass—which of course has nothing to do withEgypt—about a man whose nose and ears are eaten off by witches.)Half a century after Budge, a work called Before Philosophy (1949) shows analtogether closer understanding of the Egyptians. Professor Henri Frankfortobserves in the introduction: ‘Mythopoeic thought does not know time as uniformduration or as a succession of qualitatively indifferent moments. The concept oftime as it is used in our mathematics and physics is as unknown to early man asthat which forms the framework of our history.’ What Frankfort means bymythopoeic time is what Edward T. Hall means by the ‘polychronic time’ ofAmerican Indians—the sense of an eternal present.And how did a people who lived in an eternal present create monuments like thepyramids?To understand this, we first need to understand the Nile, and the land itsupports. Professor John A. Wilson says:The essential part of Egypt is a green gash of teeming life cutting across browndesert wastes. The line of demarcation between life and non-life is startlinglyclear: one may stand at the edge of the cultivation with one foot on theirrigated black soil and one foot on the desert sands. The country isessentially rainless; only the waters of the Nile make life possible...The Egyptians were a lucky people. Their country was a kind of tube, with thesea at one end and the mountains of Africa at the other, and hills on eitherside of the Nile to protect them from enemies and scorching winds. By August theharvest is in and the fields are dry and cracked. Then the Nile rises and floodsthe land, leaving behind rich mud, in which farmers hasten to plant new crops.Mesopotamia, by contrast, had the untrustworthy Tigris and Euphrates, whichmight flood at any time, drowning the crops, and the fierce desert winds thatoften blew up sandstorms. It is not surprising that the Egyptians were known tothe writers of antiquity as a serene and contented people.What does seem to surprise John A. Wilson—writing in Before Philosophy—is theshort period it took for Egyptian civilisation to reach such a high point. Heexplains this by saying: ‘For centuries the Egyptians had been gathering slowstrength within the Nile Valley until their day arrived, and they sprang upwardwith a suddenness which is miraculous to us.’Wilson goes on: ‘We shall see two major periods of Egyptian thought, theaggressive and optimistic earlier times and the submissive and hopeful latertimes.’ And he quotes Breasted, who remarks: ‘Conceive... the dauntless courageof the man who told his surveyors to lay out the square base 755 feet on eachside! [He knew it would] take nearly two and a half million blocks each weighingtwo and one half tons to cover this square of thirteen acres with a mountain ofmasonry 481 feet high... The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is thus a document in thehistory of the human mind.’West, Hancock and Bauval would agree; but they would argue that the ‘suddenness’is an illusion, and that the Egyptians were heirs to an older civilisation.Bauval and Hancock would suggest, moreover, that it was not a ‘gathering of slowstrength’ that caused the Egyptians to explode into the achievements of thepyramid age, but a long-term religious purpose. The Great Pyramid was theculmination of centuries of preparation, and it marked the beginning of a newage, the Age of Osiris, which could only bring prosperity to everyone in theland of Egypt. With their god-king, in their well-protected land, under thebenevolent eye of the gods who looked down from the heavens, they could affordto be cheerful and optimistic.Moreover, they were almost certainly the first civilisation in human history whowere in that happy position. There is a sense in which we can regard theEgyptians as the culmination of man’s evolution up to that point. Wilson says:‘We want to emphasise just as strongly as we can that the Egyptians of thesetimes were a gay and lusty people. They relished life to the full, and theyloved life too fully to surrender its hearty flavour.’ For thousands of years,man had been ‘up against it’—against ice ages and droughts and earthquakes andfloods. Now suddenly, one single people—who believed firmly that they wereprotected by the gods—had found their golden age.But what we are in a position to understand—as Professor Wilson was not—is thatthe strength of dynastic Egypt sprang from unity of mind. Like the Hopi or theNavajo, they were living very close to the earth, to the black mud that broughtthem life. And we could say of them what Hall says of the Hopi—that religion isthe central core of their life (see p. 239).All the evidence shows that his every word can be applied to ancient Egypt. Itwas basically a religious civilisation, bound together in total unity.To understand this fully, we have to see it against the background of humansocial evolution up to that point.I have argued that the evidence—presented, for example, by AlexanderMarshack—suggests that Cro-Magnon man represented an astonishing step forward inevolution. It had been happening, by then, for nearly half a million years, forreasons that are not fully understood.As we have seen, Gurdjieff borrowed from Sankhya philosophy the idea of the ‘Lawof Three’—the third force. Two forces—such as man struggling against hisenvironment—may remain forever in equilibrium if nothing alters the balance.Whether human beings existed as long ago as the Miocene (as ForbiddenArchaeology suggests) is in a sense irrelevant—although the evidence iscertainly worth studying—because if they did, they marked time for millions ofyears. Then, about half a million years ago, some ‘third force’ altered thebalance, and gave man a reason—or a cluster of reasons—for becoming moreintelligent. Language and the development of human sexuality almost certainlyplayed their part. A creature who is learning to express himself verbally isbecoming more intelligent by definition. And a creature whose interest in sexhas ceased to be brutish and seasonal, and who finds the opposite sexpermanently interesting and exciting—perhaps even sacred—has also taken animportant step towards being truly human.Neanderthal man was undoubtedly a ‘religious animal’, and Stan Gooch has arguedstrongly (in The Neanderthal Question and Cities of Dreams) that he achieved ahigher level of civilisation than we give him credit for. But since he vanishedfrom the scene of history, this is largely irrelevant to the present argument.And since he has left us no art, we possess no evidence to suggest that heachieved the supremely important development of hunting magic.But we know that Cro-Magnon man achieved it. And we are also in a position tounderstand the importance of that step forward. A man who believes that he caninfluence nature and capture his prey by means of magical ritual has a new senseof control. He feels that, in some sense, he has found the key to becoming themaster of nature rather than its slave. Life ceases to be a non-stop strugglefor survival, which he often wins only by the skin of his teeth. He hasundergone a psychological revolution that might be labelled thepurpose-revolution.If Marshack is correct, then a close study of the heavens also played its partin the revolution. To begin with, it was probably merely a matter of creatingsome kind of calendar, which enabled him to anticipate the changes of theseasons. But since this study played a central part in his more active andinvolved attitude towards his own existence, it must have become something inwhich he indulged more and more for its own sake.But we are speaking of Cro-Magnon man as if he was an individual, who enjoyedindulging his hobby of star-gazing. What must be understood is that ancient manwas never an ‘individual’ in our modern sense. He was a member of a group—ofboth males and females—who shared the consciousness of that group. Animalsoperate on a collective instinct, like a herd of reindeer or a flock of birds ora school of fishes, and this is how we need to think of our remote humanancestors.But hunting magic made another basic difference, as we can see from his cavepaintings. Those who performed it were shamans, ‘magicians’, and it wasinevitable that the shaman would also become the leader. In primitive societies,the priest quickly becomes the priest-king, the priestess the priestess-queen.And this has the effect of creating a new kind of unity, a new level of purpose.This must have have been one of the most important factors in the evolution ofCro-Magnon man towards modern Homo sapiens. He had a leader whom he regardedwith unqualified admiration. From now on, he could face the world with totalsingleness of purpose. And with this unity of purpose, he was ready to createcivilisation.How long did it take? We have no idea. Conventional history suggests about25,000 years between the time when Marshack’s Cro-Magnon star-gazers turned intofarmers and then city-builders. The evidence we have examined in this booksuggests that it was far less than that, and that by perhaps as long ago as20,000 BC, the ‘collective unity’ with its shaman-king or priestess-queen hadevolved into some early form of civilisation.According to Hapgood, a worldwide maritime civilisation existed at a time whenAntarctica was free of ice, perhaps 7000 BC. But if Schwaller de Lubicz iscorrect in believing that the Sphinz is water-weathered, then some fairlysophisticated civilisation antedated it by three or four thousand years. InEarth’s Shifting Crusty Hapgood argues that Antarctica was 2500 miles closer tothe equator in 15,000 BC. If so, then it is easy to imagine that its movementwas a major catastrophe for those who lived there, and probably involved massiveflooding.We have looked closely at the evidence that survivors from this driftingcontinent took refuge in South America and in Egypt, and that the native peoplesof Central and South America called them the Viracochas.If Schwaller is correct, then a group of these Viracochas moved to Egypt foundthat this sheltered country, with its great river and its yearly inundation, wasthe ideal home, and began to create a new civilisation. Aware of the precessionof the equinoxes, which played a central part in their religious belief, theylaid the foundations of their temple on the Giza plateau, where a great mass ofgranite became identified with the ‘primeval mound’. They built the Sphinx,gazing towards the constellation of Leo, and laid out the ground-plan of thepyramids, whose conformation was precisely that of the three stars of Orion’sBelt in 10,500 BC. They planned to complete their Temple of the Stars when Orioncame close to the heavenly counterpart of the Giza plateau. Then the pharaoh-godwould perform the ceremony that would send Osiris back to his home in the skies,and inaugurate a new Golden Age.Egyptologists are agreed that this Golden Age actually arrived, around 2600 BC.There was an explosion of creative energy, an upsurge of optimism. Withreligious conviction acting as a ‘third force’, the ancient Egyptians became thehighest manifestation of the human evolutionary drive so far achieved.For the ancient Egyptians, magic was accepted in the same way that modern manaccepts technology—not magic in the sense of a contradiction of the laws ofcausality, but, as Schwaller explained, in the sense of being ‘bathed in apsychic atmosphere which establishes a bond between the individuals, a bondwhich is as explicit as the air which is breathed by all living beings.’ Inother words, Egyptian magic was undoubtedly closer to the magic of the porpoisecaller of the Gilbert Islands, or the Amahuaca chieftain performing a huntingritual, than to the absurdities described by Budge. Such magic is based upon anunderstanding of forgotten laws of nature.In attempting to gain some insight into how the Egyptians lifted giant blocks ofstone, I asked Christopher Dunn, the manufacturing engineer who had studied thesarcophagus in the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid, whether he had anypractical—or even impractical—suggestions. By way of reply he sent me a strangelittle pamphlet called A Book in Every Home, written by a man called EdwardLeedskalnin, and published by the author in Homestead, Florida. Leedskalnin,apparently, was an eccentric who lived in a place called Coral Castle, nearMiami, Florida, which he built himself from giant blocks of coral, some weighingas much as 30 tons. Leedskalnin, a thin little man who was only five feet tall,died in 1952 without divulging the secret of how he constructed the ‘castle’,and moved these enormous weights. In 28 years, he quarried and erected a totalof 1,100 tons.A Book in Every Home tells us the reason that Ed Leedskalnin became a recluse.‘I always have wanted a girl, but I never had one.’ As a young man, he fell inlove with a sixteen-year-old girl, but his courtship was apparentlyunsuccessful. This may have been because she turned him down, although thepamphlet hints strongly that the real reason was that he learned that she wasnot a virgin, and decided that it would be humiliating to accept ‘damagedgoods’. He seems to have become obsessed by the idea that most girls of ‘sweetsixteen’ (one of his favourite phrases) were ‘damaged’ (although he obviouslyregarded even a kiss as evidence of depravity), and ‘that is why I was sosuccessful in resisting the natural urge for love making’. The pamphlet advisesall mothers not to allow their daughters to associate with ‘fresh boys’, andeven suggests that they should offer themselves instead.Leedskalnin’s disappointment in love led him to retire to Homestead, Florida,where he worked out some secret process of moving and lifting giant blocks,weighing an average of 6½ tons—more than the average weight of blocks in theGreat Pyramid.Christopher Dunn had visited Coral Castle for the first time in 1982; now,following my letter, he was kind enough to pay a second visit, which convincedhim that Leedskalnin was merely telling the truth when he declared: ‘I know thesecret of how the pyramids of Egypt were built.’ But he refused to divulge it,even to US Government officials, who paid him a visit and were shown around thecastle. The only hint he would drop was to the effect that ‘all matter consistsof individual magnets, and it is the movement of those magnets within materialthrough space that produces measurable phenomena, i.e. magnetism andelectricity.’Christopher Dunn’s discussions with a colleague, Steven Defenbaugh, led them toconclude that Leedskalnin had invented some kind of antigravity device. Then itstruck him that merely getting out of bed in the morning is an anti-gravitydevice, and that this concept brings the solution no nearer.On the other hand, there are even now magnetic levitation trains that arebasically anti-gravity devices. If one magnet is suspended over another, thereis a natural tendency for their opposite poles to align themselves, so theyattract one another. If their poles can be prevented from aligning, they repelone another. Could Leedskalnin have used this principle in raising his vastblocks? One photograph of Ed Leedskalnin’s backyard shows a device like threetelephone poles leaning together to form a tripod, with a square box on top.Wires descend from this box and hang between the poles. No such box was found inLeedskalnin’s workshop after his death, so presumably he disassembled it toprevent it from being examined.What Christopher Dunn was able to find in the workshop was a large flywheel,which Leedskalnin is supposed to have used to create electricity. The barmagnets on it were set in concrete. Dunn went off and purchased a bar magnet ata local hardware store. Then he returned to the workshop and spun the flywheel,holding the bar magnet towards it. Sure enough, the magnet pushed and pulled inhis grasp like a shunting train. This was enough to suggest that Leedskalnin’ssecret involved magnetism.Dunn points out that the earth itself is a giant magnet—although we still haveno idea of what causes the magnetism. And of course, matter itself is electricalin nature. Had Leedskalnin discovered some new principle that utilised earthmagnetism? Or, if that sounds too absurd to take seriously, could he havesomehow turned his whole block of coral into a giant magnet by wrapping it insteel sheets and using an electric current? And then used his push-pull deviceto force it to move? Could he even have suspended his iron-clad block like amagnetic levitation train?The obvious objection to all this—as a solution to how the pyramids werebuilt—is that the Egyptians knew nothing of electricity, and possessed no iron.In fact, there are those who doubt both propositions. When Howard-Vyse wasexploring the Great Pyramid in June 1837, he told one of his assistants, J. R.Hill, to use gunpowder to clear the far end of the southern ‘air shaft’ in theKing’s Chamber (the one that Bauval discovered to have been pointing at Orion’sBelt in 2500 BC). Hill blasted away at the southern face of the Pyramid, andafter clearing away much debris, found a flat iron plate near the mouth of theair shaft. It was a foot long, four inches wide, and an eighth of an inch thick,and did not look like meteoric iron; in fact, since it looked like ordinarywrought iron, the ‘experts’ were inclined to doubt its genuineness. But whenFlinders Petrie examined it in 1881, he found fossilised protozoa in the rust,revealing that it had been buried for a long time next to a block of limestonewith fossils in it. In 1989, it was re-examined by Dr M. P. Jones of the MineralResources Department at Imperial College, London, and he and a fellowmetallurgist, Dr Sayed El Gayer, established that it was not meteoric iron,since its nickel content was too low. Their tests showed that it had beensmelted at a temperature of over 1000 degrees centigrade, and that there weretraces of gold on one side of the plate, suggesting that it had once beengold-plated. The conclusion would seem to be that the Egyptians knew how tosmelt iron ore—approximately two thousand years before the Iron Age.The trace of gold raises another possibility—gold plating by electrical means.In June 1936, the German archaeologist Wilhelm König, of the Iraq Museum inBaghdad, came upon a clay vase containing a copper cylinder, inside which—heldin by asphalt and molten lead—was an iron rod. He recognised it as a primitivebattery. Other archaeologists dismissed this conclusion on the grounds that theParthian grave in which the battery was found dated back to about 250 BC. Butanother German Egyptologist, Dr Arne Eggebrecht, agreed with König, andconstructed a duplicate which, when filled with fruit juice, produced half avolt of electricity for eighteen days. He was able to use this to coat a silverfigurine in gold in half an hour. Eggebrecht had noticed gold-covered Egyptianstatues in which the gold coating seemed to be too thin and fine to have beenapplied by gluing or beating, and concluded that it was highly likely that theEgyptians knew about electroplating. It seems certain that the Parthians did—forit is hard to think what else the battery was intended for.Others have suggested an even more intriguing possibility. One puzzle aboutpainted Egyptian tombs is what the artists used to light the tomb as they workedon the painting—they show no sign of lampblack on the ceilings. But on the wallsof the temple at Dendera, there are engravings that might be electric lights andinsulators. Admittedly, this would also have involved inventing a light bulbcontaining a vacuum, which sounds too far-fetched—it seems far more likely thatthe artists used oil lamps with well-trimmed wicks, or that they carefullycleaned all lampblack off the ceiling. But these suggestions serve to remind usthat we still have no idea of how the Egyptians drilled out the sarcophagus inthe King’s Chamber, or the inside of vases whose neck is too thin to admit achild’s finger. All that is certain is that they knew far more than we give themcredit for.The basic problem may be the one that these last few chapters have tried topinpoint: that as products of a technological culture, we find it virtuallyimpossible to place ourselves inside the minds of a far simpler, more primitiveculture. Schwaller de Lubicz never tires of emphasising that when the ancientEgyptians expressed themselves in symbols, this was not because their drawing‘symbolised’ something, in the way that Freud claims an obelisk symbolises aphallus. The symbol was the only way to express what they meant. To look forhidden meaning is rather as if someone stood in front of a Constable paintingand said: ‘I wonder, what he meant by it?’We have to try to understand what it means to be a civilisation that is totallyunified by its religion. As Schwaller says: ‘Ancient Egypt did not have a“religion” as such; it was religion in its entirety, in the broadest and purestacceptation of the term.’We can perhaps begin to grasp this if we think in terms of one of those modernmessianic sects who believe that their leader is God, or a reincarnation ofChrist, and who would be glad to die for him. Their total belief in theirmessiah makes life marvellously simple; they feel absolutely secure from theproblems and contingencies that torment the rest of us. They have made thediscovery that total, unquestioning belief creates a kind of heaven on earth,and even in the face of the most conclusive evidence that their messiah is notwhat he claims to be, they refuse to be swayed. They are, in fact, refusing toexchange their state of inner peace and certainty for the usual miseries andhazards of human existence.In one of the Hermetic Texts, the god Thoth says: ‘Do you not know, Asclepius,that Egypt is an image of heaven? Or, to speak more precisely, that in Egypt,all the operations of powers which rule and operate in heaven have beentransferred down to earth below.’A million or so ancient Egyptians believed this without question. They wereilliterate peasants, but they believed that their priests knew all the secretsof the universe, and that their pharaoh was a god. Ancient Egypt was acollective civilisation: not merely in the sense that Soviet Russia andCommunist China were collectives, but in an even deeper sense of being united bya ‘collective unconscious’. They were as united under their pharaoh-god as theAmahuaca Indians under their shaman chieftain. It is even likely that, in theirreligious mysteries, they experienced collective ‘visions’ as the AmahuacaIndians experienced them when everyone in the tribe was able to see the sameprocession of phantom animals.The notion that thousands of slaves were driven to build the Great Pyramid by acruel pharaoh belongs to a later age that had left behind the sheer simplicityof the Old Kingdom Egyptians. Kurt Mendelssohn is closer to the truth when hesupposes that the pharaoh devised the task of pyramid-building to unite hispeople. But he is failing to grasp the fact that they were united—far moreunited than a modern man can understand.In fact, modern computer science can provide an insight into this paradoxicalnotion of a collective unconscious. In Out of Control (1994), Kevin Kellydescribes a conference in Las Vegas, in which five thousand computer enthusiastscame together in one hall. On the stage facing the audience is a kind of vasttelevision screen in which the audience can see itself. Every member of theaudience holds a cardboard wand, red on one side and green on the other. As theaudience waves the wands, the screen dances with colours. Individual members ofthe audience can locate themselves by changing the colour of their wands fromred to green and back.Now the Master of Ceremonies flashes on to the screen a video game called Pong—akind of ping-pong, with a white dot bouncing inside a square, while two movablerectangles on either side act as ping-pong bats. The MC announces: ‘The leftside of the auditorium controls the left bat, and the right side controls theright bat.’The whole audience then proceeds to play electronic ping-pong. Each bat iscontrolled simultaneously by 2500 people. The collective unconscious is playingthe game. Moreover, it plays an excellent game, as if there were only one playeron each side. As the ball is made to bounce faster, the whole audience adjusts,and increases its pace.Next, the MC causes a white circle to appear in the middle of the screen, andasks those who think they are sitting inside it to try to create a green figure5. Slowly, a blurred 5 materialises on the screen, then sharpens until it isquite distinct. When the MC asks for a 4, then a 3, a 2, a 1, a 0, the figuresemerge almost instantly.Now the MC places a flight simulator on the screen, so the whole audience islooking through the pilot’s eyes at a tiny runway in the midst of a pink valley.This time the left side controls the plane’s roll, and the right side the pitch.But as 5000 minds bring the aircraft in for landing, it is obvious that it isgoing to land on its wing. So the whole audience aborts the landing and makesthe plane raise its nose and try again.As Kelly comments: ‘Nobody decided whether to turn left or right... Nobody wasin charge. But as if of one mind, the plane banks and turns wide.’A second landing makes the wrong approach and is again aborted. ‘The mobdecides, without lateral communication, like a flock of birds taking off...’ Andsimultaneously, everyone in the audience decides to see if they can make theplane loop the loop. The horizon veers dizzily, but they succeed, and givethemselves a standing ovation.So modern man can achieve group-consciousness, and moreover, achieve it almostinstantaneously. It is obvious that we have not lost, the trick. In effect—asKelly observes—the audience turns into flocking birds. Presumably this could beexplained in terms of individual feedback, but for all practical purposes, it isgroup telepathy.Now consider an equally curious phenomenon. It is 1979, and Dr LarissaVilenskaya, an experimental psychologist, is in the Moscow apartment of DrVeniamin Pushkin, where the Soviet film maker Boris Yermolayev intends todemonstrate his peculiar powers in front of a small audience of scientificobservers. Yermolayev drinks some vodka to relax, then, by way of a warm-up,proceeds to a card-guessing experiment, which proceeds so fast that DrVilenskaya cannot follow it. Then Yermolayev asks one of the observers to givehim some light object; he is given a cigarette packet. He holds his hands infront of him and stares at his spread fingers with such tension thatperspiration appears on his forehead. Then he takes the cigarette packet betweenthe fingers of both hands and stares at it. He opens his hands, and the packetfalls to the ground. He picks it up and holds it again, talking to it in aninaudible whisper. Then he opens his hands, and the cigarette packet remainssuspended in the air for between 30 and 40 seconds, before it falls to theground.Yermolayev explains that he tries to establish a rapport with the object. He‘persuades’ it, and tries to project a part of himself into it.In the same paper,2 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#bookmark22] Dr Vilenskaya describes howElvira Shevchuk, a 40-year-old woman from Kalinin, is able to suspend variousobjects in the air in the same way—including a beaker of liquid. In one case shetook a stick provided by Dr Pushkin, rested it at an angle of 45 degrees on thefloor, then slowly removed her hands. The stick remained at 45 degrees for overa minute.The evidence for such feats, performed under experimental conditions, isoverwhelming. An Amahuaca or Hopi Indian would not express surprise—he wouldshrug and comment that Yermolayev and Madame Shevchuk are merely naturalshamans, and are performing feats that shamans have performed since time began.Am I, then, suggesting that the ancient Egyptians ‘levitated’ 200-ton blocks ofstone by exercising the ‘group mind’? Not quite. It is not as simple as that. Itis probable that they were not even aware that they were doing anything unusual.They prepared to move some vast block, probably with levers, ropes and rollers,the priest uttered ‘words of power’, and then they all exerted themselves inconcert, and the block moved smoothly, just as they all knew it would.Let me be more explicit. I have often taken part in an experiment in which fourpeople lift a fully grown man merely by placing one finger under his armpits andhis knees. The ‘game’ usually proceeds like this. The subject sits down, and thefour volunteers place one finger under each armpit and each knee—four fingers inall—and try to lift him. Naturally, they cannot. Then they all place their handson his head in a kind of pile, first the right hand of each person, then theleft. They concentrate hard and press down for perhaps half a minute. Then,acting simultaneously, they pull away their hands, place a single index fingerunder the subject’s armpits and knees, and lift. This time, the subject soarsoff the ground. ‘Professor’ Joad once described, on a BBC Brains Trustprogramme, how he had seen an enormously fat pub landlord raised off the groundby four people, one of whom was the landlord’s small daughter.Those of a scientific turn of mind claim they can explain this quite simply.When four people are totally concentrated, and then exert their strengthsimultaneously, they can exert far more force than if they attempt theexperiment without preparation—in which case, their self-doubt helps to ensurefailure.Now this explanation may well be correct. For practical purposes, it makes nodifference whether the power they are exerting is normal or paranormal. In allprobability, the half-minute of concentration creates the same kind of unitythat the members of the computer conference experienced. It is their totalunanimity that ‘increases their strength’.I am suggesting that the workmen who built the Great Pyramid made use of somesimilar ‘trick’, and that relays of them probably lifted their 6-ton blocks fromcourse to course by sudden concentrated effort, under the guidance of anoverseer or priest. They probably believed that the gods were making the blockslighter, and that no special effort—except obedience—was required. In buildingthe Sphinx Temple, they probably used ramps and levers, and were quite unawarethat there was anything unusual about moving a 200-ton block. In a civilisationwhere ‘flocking’ was part of the normal behaviour of men working together, theyprobably accepted it as a perfectly normal technique. A gang of modern workmenwould be in danger of being crushed as a block slipped out of control and wasallowed to fall backwards, but a totally unified group of workmen would act inconcert, like the audience bringing the plane in to land.The explanation of other mysteries—like the granite sarcophagus—may have to waituntil we can learn whether the Egyptians possessed unsuspected technicalresources, such as the ability to make practical use of musical vibrations. Whatis clear is that our ignorance will continue until we have a betterunderstanding of the powers of the ‘group mind’. But if an audience at acomputer conference can demonstrate these powers spontaneously, then there seemsno reason why carefully designed experiments with groups should not begin toprovide some of the answers.All the evidence suggests that Old Kingdom Egypt was a unique experiment inhuman evolution, the most remarkable demonstration in human history of whatcould be achieved with a ‘group mind’.It could not last, of course. According to Professor Wilson: The Old Kingdom ofEgypt collapsed into turmoil heels over head. The old values... were swept awayin an anarchy of force and seizure.’ Their immensely successful civilisationturned into a kind of rat race. Two centuries after Cheops, pyramid-building hadalready become painfully careless and incompetent—although the inscription ofthe ancient texts in the pyramid of Unas was still one of the great achievementsof the Old Kingdom.Wilson describes how Egyptian confidence gradually drained away. During the OldKingdom, men saw themselves as very nearly the equal of the gods. Five hundredyears later, they were feeling vulnerable and accident-prone. This produced ahigher form of morality, in which man’s responsibility to his fellow man—andwoman—was increasingly emphasised. But the old certainties had evaporated. Thenew deterministic philosophy,’ says Wilson, ‘was rather definitely stated interms of the will of god, placed over against man’s helplessness.’Then, around the time of the fall of Troy—about 1250 BC—new problems arose. TheMediterranean world seethed with violence—Hittites, the Sea Peoples, theLibyans, the Assyrians. Egypt survived, but was never the same again.1250 BC is, of course, the period when, according to Julian Jaynes, ‘modernconsciousness’ was born. Jaynes believes that the ‘old consciousness’ was‘bicameral’, lacking any kind of self-awareness, and that men ‘heard voices’,which they mistook for the voices of the gods—in other words, man was a kind ofconscious robot. The evidence presented here makes this seem unlikely. Itsuggests that the chief difference between primitive man and modern man is thatprimitive man took for granted a certain access to the ‘collective unconscious’,and was therefore far closer to nature and his fellow man. But it is hard toimagine any human being, even the most primitive, completely lacking inself-consciousness.Schwaller, as we know, felt that man has degenerated since the time of theancient Egyptians. And there is a sense in which he is obviously correct. Butthere is also a sense in which the ‘Fall’ was inevitable. ‘Group consciousness’had reached a kind of limit.Now, from the evolutionary point of view, group consciousness has considerableadvantages. In African Genesis, Robert Ardrey describes how he and Raymond Dartstood beside a particularly beautiful blossom. Dart waved his hand over it, andthe blossom dissolved into a cloud of insects flying around a bare twig. After awhile, the insects—they were called flattid bugs—resettled on the twig, crawledaround over one another’s backs for a few moments, then reformed into the‘blossom’, green at the tip, gradually shading into delicate tints of coral.Natural selection cannot explain the flattid bug, for in natural selection,individuals die because they are unable to meet challenges, and the ‘fittest’survivors mate and continue the species. But to explain the flattid bug inDarwinian terms, we have to suppose that a whole colony of bugs alighted on abranch and accidentally formed something like a blossom, while another group,that looked like an assembly of flattid bugs, got eaten by birds. And the otherflattid bugs took note of this, and drilled themselves to form even moreconvincing blossoms. In fact, as we can see, there is no Darwinian explanation.Only the ‘group mind’ hypothesis can explain how they learned to form a blossomthat does not even exist in nature.But group consciousness is of limited value. It cannot produce Leonardos andBeethovens and Einsteins. Even ancient Egypt needed its men of genius, likeImhotep, who built the Step Pyramid. Group consciousness tends to be static bynature. It may only have taken 50,000 or so years for group consciousness toevolve from Cro-Magnon cave artists to Old Kingdom Egyptians. But it has onlytaken slightly over 3000 years for ‘fallen man’, trapped in left-brainconsciousness, to create modern civilisation. That is because left-brainconsciousness is simply a far more efficient method of evolution. A talentedleft-brain individual, like Thales or Pythagoras or Plato, produces importantideas, and these are disseminated by means of writing, influencing far morepeople than even the most charismatic shaman. It was with the aid of the NewTestament and the Koran that Jesus and Mohammed went on to conquer the world.The problem with left-brain consciousness is that it creates frustration, whichin turn produces criminals who take out their frustrations on the rest ofsociety. Yet one single book like the Morte d’Arthur—written in prison by a manwho was both a brigand and a rapist—can change the sensibility of a wholecontinent. After the invention of the printing press, talented individuals couldinfluence millions. Since the 1440s, when Gutenberg invented the printing press,it would be possible to write the history of western civilisation in terms ofimportant books—beginning with Luther’s 95 theses and his translation of theBible.Such books are an example of what Gurdjieff calls ‘the third force’. In Luther’sday, two forces were in equilibrium—the power of the Roman Church, and thedissatisfaction of northern Europeans like Frederick the Wise of Saxony. Andthey might have remained in equilibrium until the end of the century, since theEmperor of Germany was Charles V, the most powerful man in Europe. But Luthernailed a paper with his 95 theses on the door of the church in Wittenberg, thenhad them printed. Everyone in Germany read it, or had it read to them, andbefore the Pope could stop it, the Reformation was under way. The third forcehad entered like a well-aimed kick.I am arguing that evolution cannot be understood without this concept of thethird force. One of Gurdjieff’s best illustrations was of someone who wishes tochange, to achieve greater self-knowledge, and in whom the forces of lazinessact as a counterbalance. In this case, the breakthrough can occur throughknowledge—a perception of how it can be achieved, which brings a new drive andoptimism.In the same way, the neo-Darwinian view of evolution is that man evolved throughthe struggle against nature—two forces in opposition.I am suggesting that the real stimulus to evolution was knowledge, man’sdiscovery that he could solve problems by the use of his brain. The brainexplosion must have been due to the intervention of a ‘third force’—possibly anexploding meteor, but more probably the development of language, of religion,and of sexual attitudes. Again, I believe that it was Cro-Magnon man’s discoveryof hunting magic that acted as a ‘third force’ that made his attitude towardshis life and his environment more aggressive and purposeful.In a highly original book called The Chalice and the Blade (1987), Riane Eisleradvances her own view of what has gone wrong with civilisation. Proposing atheory of ‘Cultural Transformation’, she argues that there are two basic modelsof society, the ‘partnership model’ and the ‘dominator model’. The Amahuaca andHopi Indians would be examples of what she means by the partnership model. Amodern business corporation would be an example of the dominator model, with itsruthlessness and competition.She believes that Palaeolithic and Neolithic culture were partnership cultures,but that ‘following a period of chaos and almost total cultural disruption,there occurred a fundamental social shift’. In this respect, her theory bears anobvious resemblance to that of Julian Jaynes. The chief difference is that shebelieves that the ‘disruption’ started as early as 5000 BC, when nomads shecalls the Kurgan people, who had been living in the ‘harsh, unwanted, colder,sparser territories on the edges of the earth’ began to invade the territoriesof the agricultural civilisations that spread out along the lakes and fertileriver valleys.She calls such civilisations ‘partnership’ cultures because she believes thatmen and women lived on equal terms, and that the worship of the Earth Mother wasthe most widespread form of religion—she cites an impressive amount ofarchaeological evidence to suggest that early cultures were oriented to theMother Goddess—Graves’s White Goddess. Such cultures survived for thousands ofyears, but eventually succumbed to the invading nomads (whom she identifies withAryans). Crete was one of the last to fall to these invaders, and itsdestruction, about 3000 years ago, marks the end of an era. Here again, theargument is very close to Jaynes.The Kurgans brought a ‘dominator’ culture, ‘a social system in which maledominance, male violence, and a generally hierarchic and authoritarian socialstructure was the norm.’ And this, she declares, has lasted until our own time.Now, she argues, mankind stands at an evolutionary crossroads; what is needed,if we are to survive, is a return to the partnership culture of the past.One authority on evolution, Ashley Montague, described The Chalice and the Bladeas ‘the most important book since Darwin’s Origin of Species’. Predictably,others have dismissed it as a piece of feminist propaganda. Yet it can be seenthat her basic argument is very close to the one that has been outlined in thelast three chapters. She also seems to accept that one of the reasons that manbecame truly human was some kind of sexual revolution in which woman assumed newimportance—she cites André Leroi-Gourhan, director of the Sorbonne Centre forPrehistoric and Protohistoric Studies, to the effect that ‘Palaeolithic artreflects the importance our early forebears attached to their observation thereare two sexes’, a conclusion ‘based on analysis of thousands of paintings andobjects in some sixty excavated Palaeolithic caves.’ In other words,Palaeolithic man had begun to see woman as a kind of goddess.Riane Eisler’s argument is certainly highly persuasive. Yet her final chapter,‘Breakthrough in Evolution: Towards a Partnership Future’, which should be themost important in the book, is in fact the least convincing. She paints anappealing picture of a future ‘partnership world’ in which there will be no morewar, no more male domination, and in which there will be a steady decrease insuch problems as mental illness, suicide, divorce, wife-battering, vandalism,murder and international terrorism. But she seems to feel that all this willcome about through goodwill and understanding. Gurdjieff would have pointed outthat goodwill and understanding can change nothing. In a world in which theforces are in equilibrium—in this case, dominator culture versus partnershipculture—change can only be brought about by a ‘third force’.But what force?In his Experiment in Autobiography (1934), H. G. Wells pointed out that eversince the beginning of life, most creatures have been ‘up against it’. Theirlives are a drama of struggle against the forces of nature. Yet nowadays, youcan say to a man: ‘Yes, you earn a living, you support a family, you love andhate, but—what do you do?’ His real interest may be in something else—art,science, literature, philosophy. The bird is a creature of the air, the fish isa creature of the water, and man is a creature of the mind.He goes on to compare mankind to the earliest amphibians, who dragged themselvesout of prehistoric seas, because they wanted to become land animals. But theyonly have fins instead of legs, and they find the land exhausting, and long forthe sustaining medium of the sea. Man is not yet a true creature of the mind; hehas fins instead of legs. After a short walk in the world of the mind, he isexhausted. There is a sense in which we are not yet human.Gurdjieff would have put it more harshly; he would have said that we think wehave free will, but we have almost none. At the beginning of the First WorldWar, he and Ouspensky saw a lorry loaded up with crutches heading for the battlefront—crutches for men whose legs had not yet been blown off. Yet there was noway of preventing those legs from being blown off. This is the objection thatGurdjieff would raise to Riane Eisler’s vision of a ‘partnership society’. Humannature cannot be changed by wishful thinking.On the other hand, when we look at this problem from the perspective of humanevolution, some interesting insights emerge.Most animals seem to possess no self-awareness, in the sense of being able toreflect on themselves. We cannot imagine a dog asking: ‘Who am I?’ But from themoment man began to perform any kind of religious rite—carving sun discs, ritualcannibalism, burying the dead with funeral observances—he had achieved a newlevel of self-awareness; he was now truly human.Forty thousand years ago, Cro-Magnon society may have been more rich and complexthan we can imagine, with observation of the heavens, worship of the moongoddess, hunting magic (possibly with a priestess as shaman) and a life whoserhythms were those of nature. This ‘partnership society’ reached its peak inancient Egypt, where Isis and Osiris shared the throne of the gods, and endedsome time during the past 3500 years.But this ‘Fall’, as we have seen, was not without its advantages. As anindividual, isolated in left-brain consciousness, man began to use his mind in anew way. It was Pythagoras who invented the world ‘philosophy’—love of wisdom:that is, love of knowledge for its own sake, not for any practical purpose thatit might serve. And Plato describes how Socrates, preoccupied with somephilosophical problem, stood in the same spot for a whole day and night.This story is undoubtedly an exaggeration. As Wells points out, man is not quitethat much a creature of the mind.Yet he continued to develop this odd faculty of living inside his own head. Theancient Greeks were perfectly happy to sit on a cold stone seat watching anactor wearing a mask and pretending to be Oedipus. And just over 2000 yearslater, audiences were just as happy to stand in the Mermaid Theatre, watching anactor on a bare stage claiming to be Tamburlaine the Great.Less than two centuries after this, a printer named Samuel Richardson invented anew form of entertainment—the novel. Of course, it could be said that the novelwas as old as Homer. But until 1740, it had been a kind of fairy-tale.Richardson turned it into soap opera; Pamela was about the girl next door.Suddenly, everyone was reading novels—and writing them. The novel was a magiccarpet that could transport readers out of their own lives—and the problems ofbeing ‘up against it’—and into the lives of other people.The chief development in man in the past few centuries has been a development ofimagination.But at this point we become aware of a new problem. This escape from the realworld was so intoxicating that many people lost all sense of reality. Romanticpoets—and painters and musicians—found the world of fantasy so greatlypreferable to the harsh realities of life that they began committing suicide, ordying of drugs or alcohol, in alarming numbers. The typical artist of thenineteenth century was an ‘Outsider’, who felt miserable and alienated. DeL’Isle Adam’s Axel summed it up in the words: ‘As for living, our servants cando that for us.’Two world wars, and a sense of global crisis, have helped to restore somerealism. But it is still obvious that Wells was correct; our real problem isthat we are still not creatures of the mind. The problem is not wickedness ormale domination or scientific materialism; it is boredom. When faced with achallenge, we are magnificent. But when the problems are solved, and we havere-established peace and leisure, we tend to feel stifled and directionless.Yet here is one of the most interesting observations about humankind. When weare faced with some appalling problem, we can see, perfectly clearly, howpleasant it would be if the problem went away, and life was back to normal. Andif someone asked us: ‘But wouldn’t you find it boring?’, we would replyindignantly: ‘Of course not!’ And this is not self-deception. We can see howeasy it would be to use the imagination—which has now become such a usefultool—to re-create our present state of anxiety and misery, and relax into animmense sense of gratitude that it has gone away.And in fact, when a major problem vanishes, we do experience an immensegratitude—for a few hours. Then we relapse into our usual state of ‘taking forgranted’.The truth is that although the development of human imagination in the pastthree centuries has been extraordinary, it is still not powerful enough to makeus immensely grateful for all the miseries and difficulties we are notexperiencing.Yet as we look at the matter closely, it becomes obvious that this developmentof the imagination is the third force that can alter the course of humanevolution. Our technological civilisation has created more freedom than man hasexperienced in his whole history. Yet he is not aware that he is free. He feelstrapped, bored and restless.Let me cite some examples of the third force creating a sense of freedom.In Swann's Way, Marcel Proust describes how, feeling tired and depressed, hetasted a cake dipped in herb tea, and experienced a sudden sense of overwhelmingdelight. ‘I had ceased to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal.’ Then he realisedthat the taste had reminded him of his childhood, when an aunt gave him a tasteof her cake dipped in herb tea. The taste made his childhood real again, andbrought the sudden sense of ecstasy and freedom.As a bored and depressed teenager, Graham Greene took a revolver on to thecommon and played Russian roulette. When there was just a click on an emptychamber, he felt an overwhelming sense of delight and relief, and therecognition that life is infinitely rich and exciting.The psychologist Abraham Maslow coined the phrase ‘peak experience’ to describesuch moments. He tells of a peak experience described to him by a young marriedwoman. She was watching her husband and children eating breakfast, feelingcheerful and relaxed, but preoccupied with the next thing she had to do.Suddenly, a beam of sunlight came in through the window, and she thought:‘Aren’t I lucky!’ and plunged into the peak experience.In a book called Seeing the Invisible, a collection of ‘transcendent’experiences, a sixteen-year-old girl describes how, approaching a wood on asummer evening, time stood still for a moment. ‘Everywhere, surrounding me wasthis white, bright, sparkling light, like sun on frosty snow, like a milliondiamonds, and there was no cornfield, no trees, no sky, this light waseverywhere...’ She comments: ‘I only saw it once, but I know in my heart it isstill there.’In the first three cases—Proust, Greene and the young married women—we know what‘triggered’ the experience; in the fourth case, we have no idea. There areobviously occasions when the peak experience ‘just happens’.But Maslow noted an extremely interesting thing. When he talked to his studentsabout peak experiences, they began to recall peak experiences that they had hadin the past, then forgotten. For example, a youth who was working his waythrough college by playing drums in a jazz band recalled how, at about two inthe morning, he suddenly began to drum so perfectly that he ‘couldn’t do a thingwrong’, and went into the peak experience.Moreover, as students began to talk to one another about their peak experiences,they began having them all the time. Like the girl approaching the wood, they‘knew it was still there’, and knowing it was still there places them in theright state of optimistic expectancy that tends to generate the peak experience.These experiences always produce an overwhelming sense of authenticity, of thereality of freedom. In such moments, our usual sense of lack of freedom is seenas an illusion.So what had happened to Maslow’s students? Why could they have peak experiencesall the time? Because they had somehow ‘got the trick’. They knew the freedomwas really there, and they simply learned to see it. It is like one of thosepictures, made up of a tangle of lines, from which, as you stare at it, a facesuddenly emerges. And once you have seen it, you can always go back and see itagain.We can be sure that our ancestors of 4000 years ago found it far easier toinduce peak experiences, for they were relaxed and close to nature. Then camethe ‘Fall’ into left-brain consciousness, which induces a kind of tunnel vision.Yet, as Maslow’s research demonstrated, it is not difficult for healthy humanbeings to throw off the tunnel vision and regain consciousness of freedom. Hisstudents found it perfectly easy, just as Kelly’s audience at the computerconference found it easy to achieve group consciousness.What is the lesson of the peak experience? This is easy to describe. It brings asense of delight and courage—in fact, we see courage as being of centralimportance. We also see that the peak experience depends on a high degree ofinner pressure—which is the opposite of ‘depression’. And if we wish to live insuch a way that we have regular peak experiences, we need to maintain a sense ofdrive, purpose, optimism. We induce ‘depression’ by allowing ourselves toexperience a ‘sinking feeling’. It is like letting air out of a tyre. And whenwe feel cheerful and optimistic—say, on a spring morning, or setting out on ajourney—we create a sense of high inner pressure by filling ourselves with aconfident feeling of meaning and purpose. We do it ourselves. We imagine thatthe external world causes our problems, and sometimes, indeed, it does presentus with real difficulties. But most of our problems are self-induced; we permitourselves to become negative, or merely ‘blank’.I am arguing that it was necessary for human evolution for us to escape fromthat pleasant collective consciousness that characterised our ancestors. It hadenormous advantages, but it was essentially limited. It was too pleasant, toorelaxed, and its achievements tended to be communal. The new left-brainconsciousness was far harder, far more painful and exhausting. In Dostoevsky’sPossessed, the character Svidrigailov says that he dreamed of eternity the othernight, and that it was like a narrow room full of cobwebs. This is the symbol ofleft-brain consciousness. And yet when galvanised by courage and optimism, it iscapable of a far greater intensity—and sense of control—than right-brainconsciousness.Moreover, as Maslow realised, healthy people are always having experiences ofright-brain consciousness—for the peak experience is right-brain consciousness.In spite of being trapped in the left brain, healthy and optimistic human beingscan easily regain access to right-brain consciousness.In other words, left brainers have the choice. They can induce right-brainconsciousness. But the typical right brainer finds it very distressing to try toinduce left-brain consciousness—the kind of purposeful concentration required,for example, to solve a difficult mathematical or philosophical problem. Whichmeans that, at this point in evolution, left brainers have the advantage.This is why these insights into past civilisations, to which this book has beendevoted, are so important. We have been inclined to see them as less efficientversions of ourselves—superstitious, technologically inadequate, deficient inreason and logic. Now it has become clear that this was a mistake. In some ways,they actually knew more than we do. Compared to their rich collective awareness,modern consciousness seems barren and constricted. They also knew more than wedo about the hidden powers of the mind. In some ways they were far moreefficient than we are. To really understand this comes as something of arevelation, which teaches us a great deal about what it means to be human.It makes us understand, to begin with, that evolution has actually given us farmore than they had. Right-brain awareness tends to be passive; left-brainawareness is active. Right-brain awareness is like a broad, gently flowingriver; left-brain awareness is like a powerful jet of water. Above all,left-brain awareness has the power to contemplate itself, as if in a mirror. Tounderstand the men of the remote past is to understand something very importantabout ourselves—including how much reason we have to be satisfied with the placeto which the last 3500 years have brought us. For we have not lost what theyhave; we still have it—but we also have a great deal more. Our chiefdisadvantage so far has been that we didn’t know that we had it—or, insofar aswe did know, failed to understand what could be done with it.It is difficult to conclude a book like this, for it involves making the readersee why man has reached the most interesting point in his evolution so far. Theancient Egyptians would have understood the problem perfectly: they knew thatthere are certain things that have to be shown. The same was true of the Zenteachers, who understood that the flash of insight cannot be achieved byexplanation; it has to come spontaneously.It might help if we try considering again Maslow’s young mother watching herhusband and children eating breakfast. She was ‘lucky’ before the beam ofsunlight came through the window. But the sunlight made her aware that she waslucky, and she went into the peak experience. The peak experience depended uponachieving a kind of bird’s-eye view that made her conscious of what she alreadypossessed.The same is true of the next step in human evolution. It has already happened.It has been happening for the past 3500 years. Now all we have to do isrecognise it."},{"pageContent":"IMAGESsarcophagus [../Images/sarcophagus.jpg] The sarcophagus of Cheops in the King'sChamber, the Great Pyramid gallery [../Images/gallery.jpg] The Grand Gallery inthe Great Pyramid sphinx1 [../Images/sphinx1.jpg] The Sphinx and the Pyramid ofChefren at Giza sphinx2 [../Images/sphinx2.jpg] The Sphinx pyramidsun[../Images/pyramidsun.jpg] The Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan, Mexico ruins[../Images/ruins.jpg] A view of the ruins at Teotihuacan lascaux[../Images/lascaux.jpg] Cave painting at Lascaux.
