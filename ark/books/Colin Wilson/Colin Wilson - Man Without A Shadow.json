High aims and low-downdeeds. It’s a psych-probe satire that gives you insights into the humanrealities of a specific culture from the down-and-dirties of daily life to theup-and-atom frontiers of science-philosophy.Now, the scope of The Sex Diary of Gerard Sorme, is by no means as grandly epic,as what James Joyce wrought in Ulysses or Thomas Pynchon in Gravity’s Rainbow orWilliam Burroughs in his Western Lands trilogy, but the angle of approach issimilar. Colin Wilson has written us an amused, tender guide to the sects andsexual situation in London in the late 1950s.Yes, I know, it’s boring to keep on deploring the British National Sex Wound—thehorrid effects of the harsh, sin-whipped public-schoolmanship which makes itchronically impossible for the educated British male to relate to women, wogs,or commoners. All of whom are, apparently, genially patronized as colonialvictims to be conquered and exploited.But Colin Wilson’s novel is no gloomy recital of sexual disappointments. It’sthe bouncy journal of a young, introspective writer who hungers and trembles torealize his neurological potential, to activate his throbbing, swollen mind, toevolve to a higher state.Gerard passionately wants to become an evolutionary agent. A creativeparticipant in the updating and product-improvement of new life forms. “I amtalking about human engineering ... evolution made conscious. I am trying tohelp life forward, or in its struggle upward.”Gerard has convinced himself that through intense sexual experience he canilluminate and mutate. His lustful glands smile in agreement. Thus the firsthalf of the book is a witty recital of his varied, often harassed genitalencounters. I found this section charming and mildly arousing. We experience:Gerard’s climax when a plump woman in a crowd presses against him; the bland,emotionless loss of his virginity with an irrepressibly steamy virgin waitress;his continuous shuttling of compliant ladies, actresses, maids, shopgirls, inand out of the always available beds. Then there’s the tender post-romp scene ofthe girl lying naked on a misty lakeshore, still quivering from orgasm, quotingBaudelaire.There’s much intrigue, some adultery—but almost no emotion. At times the tone iseerily flat, like that of Brett Easton Ellis in Less Than Zero. I did this. Ithought that. I want to sleep. Smooth satire, it is.But then there’s the Dark Side.References do keep cropping up about sex murders and evil obsessions andsatanism.Eventually, on page 111, we are introduced to one Cardoc Cunningham, anenormously industrious sex magician closely based on Aleister Crowley. The booksuddenly becomes a detailed, step-by-step, clinical description of theunremitting attempts by Cunningham to possess and control the lives of thosearound him.How? By invoking the paraphernalia and pedantic rituals of Victorian Ageoccultism. Pentagons. Incense. Incantations. Invocations. Drugs. Animalsacrifice. Colorful costume changes. Oodles, my dear, of simply scandalouspranks! Woven together with group hypnotic spells—all of which work like, well,just like magic with the docile, horny, bored, unsophisticated observers!One is reminded again of the thermo-dynamic power of British CalvinistPuritanism to build up erotic steam pressure to churn to thrill-wheels ofnaughty desire and schoolboy rebellion. And, we understand why restless Etongrads, before 1960, bored to frenzy by the tired pomposities of the staidprotestant rituals, responded so enthusiastically to the smoking psychodramasand hilarious reenactments of ancient pagan and voodoo scenarios.Colin Wilson’s satire represents Cunningham and the narrator, Gerard Sorme, asslightly comic emblems of the two sides of the prepsychedelic spiritual search.Cunningham evokes and exploits the spiritual potentials which all of us containwithin. But, as a dutiful product of the factory society, he does it for power.And spiritual efficiency. This is what “magic” meant in smokestack VictorianEngland. Power and control. Gung-ho spiritual engineering to exploitsupernatural resources. Cunningham is like a madcap Monty Python industrialmanager, a frenzied John Cleese frantically organizing assembly-lines of sexworkers in the satanic mills.The literary Sorme seems bored with the complications of power. His is thesincere quest for personal enlightenment. When he attains illumination he will,of course, write several serious books about it. Sorme ends up in a properwriter’s cottage attended to by a loyal, dependent, loving wife.Cunningham, unnaturally, ends up in California forming a new religion.I was impressed to note that this book was published in the ancient, dim past ofthe year 1963. Thus it was written prepsychedelia and pre-Women’s Lib. BeforeWerner Ehrhard and Carlos Casteneda and Jim Jones and Jim Bakker. Before ShirleyMacLaine. Before, even, the Sexual Revolution and the sexual marketeering ofHefner, Guccione, and Larry Flynt. And, of course, pre-A.I.D.S.I have admired Colin Wilson for decades. To my regret I have not yet met him buthe appears to me as a thoughtful, good man. The Sex Diary of Gerard Sorme is athought-provoking, good book."},{"pageContent":"PREFACEBY COLIN WILSONIt gives me little pleasure to recall the early history of this novel.As incredible as it may seem to readers of the 1980s there was a time aboutthree decades ago when sex was practically unmentionable in a novel, and theword “fuck” had to be printed as an “f” followed by a dash. James Jones brokenew ground by printing the complete word in From Here to Eternity, and then, in1960, Lady Chatterley’s Lover was cleared for publication by a British court,and became an instant bestseller. In Paris, a small publisher that traded underthe name of Olympia Press—printing “pornographic” books for sale to British andAmerican tourists—suddenly received international recognition as a result ofpublishing Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita—or rather, as a result of the suddennotoriety that descended upon Nabokov when Graham Greene declared that Lolitawas one of the best books of 1955, and an hysterical newspaper columnist accusedhim of helping to sell pornography. By the early 1960s, Maurice Girodias—ownerof Olympia Press, and publisher also of the Marquis de Sade, Henry Miller, andJ. P. Donleavy—had ceased to be regarded as a peddlar of pornography, andachieved the status of a hero of the avant garde.He quickly realized that this placed him in a far more powerful position thanthat of an underground publisher of “dirty” books, and that if he took his standas a defender of the right to free speech, he was practically unassailable. AndI suspect that it struck him that if a book had some literary merit, or couldlay claim to intellectual seriousness, then the author could be as sexuallyexplicit as he liked. This may be why, in 1962, Maurice Girodias approached meand asked if I would care to write a novel for Olympia Press.The idea delighted me. I had always been irritated by the prudery of Anglo-Saxonpublishers. A good writer is obsessed by the urge to describe life precisely ashe has experienced it, and this urge has been the driving force ofliterature—particularly the novel—for the past two-and-a-half centuries, sinceSamuel Richardson’s Pamela—a lengthy account of the attempted seduction of aservant girl—became a European sensation in 1740. The Pickwick Papers may notstrike us as very real, but as Dickens was writing it, he must have felt that hewas capturing “life” as no one had ever captured it before. And Sinclair Lewismust have felt the same as he wrote Main Street, and Joyce as he wrote Ulysses.And when, at the age of eighteen, I began to write my first novel, Ritual in theDark, I also had the feeling that I was describing life exactly as I sawit—trying to give the reader an idea of what it was like to be inside my skin. Ifelt I had captured with precision what it was like to live in a furnished roomin Camden Town, to eat cheap meals in a workmans’ café, and to get around Londonon a bicycle. But what I was not allowed to describe was the obsession with sexthat every normal young male experiences, the feeling that he would happilyspend the rest of his life deflowering virgins at the rate of twenty a day. Atthat age—and for many years after—every girl in the street represents adelicious mystery. I remember once spending the night with a girl in a flatborrowed from a friend, and the friend asking me the next day: “What kind ofpanties did she wear?” I rather admired his honesty in asking the question, forit was at the back of my own mind every time I talked to an attractive girl. Ayear or so later, another friend confided to me that his wife had left him aftershe found his secret “sex diary,” and discovered that he was an incorrigibleCasanova. But what really upset her was not the tale of endless casualseductions, but the minute detail in which he described undressing the girl, thecolour of her bra and panties and pubic hair, whether she helped him introducehis penis or let him do it unaided, whether she moved her pubis up and down,whether she simply kept her legs apart, or wound them ’round his buttocks ...The approach struck her as horribly clinical—whereas for my friend, each girlwas as unique as a bottle of ancient Burgundy to a wine connoisseur, anddeserved the same kind of detailed entry in his “cellar book.”In its final version, Ritual in the Dark contains two or three fairly explicitsexual episodes, but as I wrote them, I felt they were pathetically inadequate;that wasn’t what it was like at all ... I envied Henry Miller, who had been ableto describe his own sex life with total honesty because the book was beingpublished in Paris. But then, when I read Sexus or The Tropic of Capricorn, Ifelt that Miller had totally wasted his opportunities; instead of trying to tell“the truth” about sex, he had merely produced a kind of compendium of schoolboysmut.But what exactly was this elusive “truth” about sex? It was easy enough to seethat, until Lady Chatterley, no major novelist had been allowed to include theall important sexual element of human existence. But to me, the relationshipbetween Lady Chatterley and Mellors was as unreal as the relationship betweenDavid Copperfield and Dora. Lawrence was not actually dishonest, but he had onlycovered one small aspect of the relationship between male and female. He hadsaid nothing about that violent and apparently unassuageable desire that everynormal young male feels towards every potentially beddable female—the desirethat made the hero of a novel by Kingsley Amis remark that the sight of thewords “Girl, 20” in an advertisement was enough to give him an erection. In anearlier version of Ritual in the Dark, I caught something of the essence of thismale obsession in an episode in which the hero, Gerard Sorme, has spent anafternoon making love to Caroline in a basement flat. After seven orgasms hefeels totally drained; he feels that the sexual delusion has finally lost itspotency. Then he goes out to the basement area to fetch the milk off thedoorstep, and catches a glimpse up the skirt of a girl who is walking past therailings; instantly, he experiences a raging violence of desire ...This, it seemed to me, was the truth that no one had ever attempted to expressabout sex. The Georgians and the Victorians had simply told lies about sex; toread Jane Austen or Thackeray, you would think that all a young male wanted froma pretty girl was to lay his eternal devotion at her feet and beg permission tosupport her for life. The result was the development of an industry inpornography, full of seduction, rape, and incest. But pornography did not evenattempt to tell the truth about sex; all its tales of “forbidden pleasures” wereoutrageously unrealistic. Pornography was merely the “dirty-minded” reaction tothe artificial “clean-mindedness” of Victorian bigots, just as Sade’s horrifyingexcesses are a reaction against the hypocrisy of a society that kept throwinghim into jail for indulging in a few harmless perversions.In the late nineteenth century, a few bold spirits decided to risk theconsequences and try to tell at least a little of the truth about sex. Nowadays,as we read Strindberg’s Marriage, Zola’s Nana, Sudermann’s Song of Songs, wefind it hard to imagine what all the fuss was about; but in their own time,these writers were denounced as vicious hawkers of obscenity whose real ambitionwas to bring about the ruination of society. By 1909, the situation had improvedenough to permit H. G. Wells to portray a middle-class young girl—AnnVeronica—who offers herself to her schoolteacher and becomes his mistress; butonly six years later, D. H. Lawrence’s harmless Rainbow was banned by a court inwhich no one had actually read the book. But for many years after theirpublication, Ulysses and Lady Chatterley’s Lover were seized and burned by theBritish and American customs authorities.All of which explains why I was delighted to accept Maurice Girodias’ssuggestion that I should write a book for Olympia Press. It seemed to me that,even by 1962, no one had tried to tell “the truth” about sex. Nabokov was anhonorable exception. I was not much concerned about whether Nabokov himself wasa paedophile or not; but I felt that he had made an honest attempt to talk aboutthat whole “forbidden” side of sex, and that by making Lolita a ten-year-oldgirl, he had turned her into a symbol of the sexually unattainable. At the sametime, by making his hero a paedophile, he had diverted attention from the realissue: that in our society, sexual desire has somehow outstripped thepossibility of its own satisfaction. So I felt there was still room for anattempt to tell the plain, unadorned truth about sex in the twentieth century.At first, it began to look as if I might have been exaggerating the difficultiesI might encounter. When I told my London publisher that I wanted to write a bookfor Olympia Press, he said that he would like the opportunity of seeing thetypescript. And when, in due course, I sent it to him, he told me that, as faras he could see, there was nothing in it—except one short episode about amasturbating machine—that might cause problems with the law, and that he wouldoffer me a far larger advance than Girodias ... Soon after this, the book wasaccepted by Dial Press in America.Then the problems began. The original title of the book was The Man Without aShadow, a reference to the hero of Chamisso’s story Peter Schlemihl, about a manwho loses his shadow. (If Musil had not already used it, I would have called thebook The Man Without Qualities.) Dial Press insisted in changing the title toThe Sex Diary of Gerard Sorme, which they felt wold ensure a larger sale. Worsewas to come. I had written a book called Origins of the Sexual Impulse, anattempt at an “existential” analysis of sexuality. When Dial learned thatPutnam’s intended to publish this in the summer of 1963, they rushed thepublication of the Sex Diary in an attempt to get it out first. Instead, the twobooks appeared simultaneously, and most literary editors decided to review themtogether. Inevitably, one book “killed” the other; even the conscientiousreviewers found it too much to read one book immediately after the other.Typical of the reviews was one in the Chicago Sun-Times, headed “Chronicle of aNasty Boy.” It read: “This outpouring by one of the first of England’s ‘angryyoung men’ might best be described as the dreamworld chronicle of a nasty littleboy who matured only physically. The perpetrator (a lame word, but a better onethan protagonist in this case) is apparently an aging juvenile who hopes tosolve all the great puzzles of existence, particularly the mysteries of life,sentience, and consciousness, while experiencing the sexual climax. His Diary isa recording of mean, grubby little affairs, casual liaisons, and his associationwith a childishly unregenerate Faust named Caradoc Cunningham—a man who can seearound corners, practices magic, and is the epitome of evil. The Diary—even atbest a most unfortunate vehicle for the novel—also is overly larded withpseudo-intellectual and five-drink philosophy. Often the language is that of thepool hall or the men’s room of a third-run movie theatre. This ‘angry young man’has not written a novel, really. He has merely indulged himself in a sexual orgyof literary narcissism.”The only consolation of this kind of review is that it might send some readersrushing out to buy the book. Indeed, it did just that. But when I finally cameto receive my royalties, they were infinitesimal. The reason, it appeared, wasthat a Boston librarian had decided to sue the publisher for obscenity. The casewas dismissed—the judge remarking that although he thought the book had noliterary merit, it was certainly not technically obscene. But a clause in mycontract—which I had sadly overlooked—stated that the author should bear anylegal costs. So the few thousand dollars the book had earned in royalties wentinto the pocket of lawyers.My own reaction, on reading the book after more than twenty years, is that Ioverlooked the major problem of trying to “tell the truth” about male sexuality:that literature is less about telling the truth than telling a story. Mostreaders who open a novel want to be entertained. In the preface to the Britishedition (which Dial Press insisted on dropping on the grounds that it was “toointellectual”) I made a plea for the novel of idea—works like Lawrence’s Womenin Love, Wells’s World of William Clissold, and Huxley’s Point Counterpoint. ButI was forgetting that these novels have never had a large audience ofadmirers—certainly not as many as Sons and Lovers, The History of Mr. Polly, orBrave New World. I had hoped that the subject—sexual experience—would make theideas palatable, but I suspect that most of the people who bought the originaledition skipped the ideas and looked for the “dirty bits.”Yet if I push aside these objections, it still seems to me that it was aworthwhile attempt to do something that had not been attempted at that time: toanalyze the fundamental paradox of male sexuality. There is an episode near thebeginning of the book that goes straight to the point. Sorme has gone into ashop that sells women’s underwear to buy his girlfriend a pair of stockings; ashe stands waiting at the counter, he turns casually, and catches a glimpse of awoman in one of those dress cubicles, pulling her skirt over her head. Heexperiences an instant shock of intense desire, and then becomes aware of theabsurdity of this response. He can see that this is a middle-aged woman. In afew hours’ time he will be watching his teenage girlfriend taking off herclothes; yet he will not experience anything like this surge of excitement. Theconclusion seems to be that human sexuality is nine-tenths imagination, and thatreality plays only a small part in it ... More than two decades after writingthe Sex Diary, I continue to be preoccupied with the same problem—in fact, havejust made one more determined attempt to get to the bottom of it in a bookcalled The Misfits, a study of “sexual Outsiders.” So in spite of itsfailings—due, as the Sun-Times reviewer pointed out, to the diary form—I stillfeel that the Sex Diary is a creditable attempt to use the novel as a medium ofphilosophy.A brief explanatory note for readers who are not acquainted with the hero’sprevious exploits in Ritual in the Dark. Gerard Sorme is a young man in hisearly twenties who lives alone in a room in London. In his early days, he hasworked in a City office, and found it unutterably boring. In those days beforeSocial Security, most people had to work for a living. Sorme daydreams of havinga tiny income—just enough to be able to rent a cheap out about this, they burstinto my flat one evening, and accused me of being a homosexual and having sixmistresses. Joy’s father was waving a horsewhip, but made no real attempt to useit. But while I was telephoning the police to request them to leave, one of ourdinner guests (a villainous old pouf called Gerard Hamilton—the original ofChristopher Isherwood’s Mr. Norris) notified the press, and within half an hour,there were a dozen or so reporters and photographers on our doorstep. Joy and Isneaked out of the back door and fled to the west country, then to Ireland. Itwas the worst thing we could have done. As soon as the British press was able totrack us down, they pursued us—even Time magazine featured the story. Joy’sfather handed my journals—which I had offered to let him read—to a newspaper,which printed long extracts. When we finally returned to London, my publisheradvised me to go and live quietly in the country, and try to live down thescandal. We did as he suggested—and have been living in Cornwall ever since—butthe after-effects of the episode were as disastrous as my publisher had feared,and when my second book, Religion and the Rebel, appeared later that year (1957)it received a universal panning.At least I made use of the “diary scandal” in the present book, althoughautobiographical elements have been diluted by fictional episodes from the lifeof Gerard Sorme. It will be unnecessary to inform modern readers that thecharacter of Caradoc Cunningham is based on Aleister Crowley, the “wickedest manin the world”; I never met Crowley (and on the whole am glad I didn’t), butheard a great deal about him from people who had, such as John Symonds andRichard Cammell. He still strikes me as the liveliest character in the book.There is little to add, except that in 1969 I completed the “Gerard Sorme”trilogy with a novel called The God of the Labyrinth which is still one of myfavourites. One day, perhaps, they will be published together in one volume.Meanwhile, I am delighted to see my alter ego Gerard taking on a new lease oflife."},{"pageContent":"AUTHOR’S NOTEIn the late December of 1956, at the time of the “Cunningham scandal,” areporter managed to bribe his way into a flat that I had recently occupied inSpitalfields, and walked away with five volumes of my journals concealed in hispockets. These journals were then quoted, without my permission, in certainarticles on Caradoc Cunningham that appeared in a daily newspaper. They weredescribed as my “Sex Diaries” and “Black Magic Journals,” and I was evenmisquoted as having written that I wished that I had committed the Whitechapelmurders.Although I was advised that I could sue the newspaper for libel, violation ofcopyright and illegally obtaining possession of my journals, I preferred toallow another newspaper to print long extracts from these journals, so that thevarious quotations that had already been made could appear in context. I assumedthat this would be the end of the matter, although I was aware at the time thatboth newspapers had photostated the journals. Over the next two years, I heardperiodic rumors that the “sex diary” (i.e., the second notebook, as printedhere) was being circulated in typewritten copies, and that these copies could beobtained, on payment of a large deposit, from certain dubious bookshops in thearea of the Charing Cross Road. I made inquiries, but was never able to verifythese rumors.A fortnight ago, however, I had definite information that an admirer of my workin New York had paid $2,000 for a photostated copy of the “sex diary.” Itssource could not be traced, but I gathered that there was a fairly brisk tradein these photostated copies in the United States.This decided me to accept an offer from The Dial Press to publish thesenotebooks in full. At first, I was inclined to publish only the parts dealingwith Caradoc Cunningham (i.e., the “Black Magic Journal”), but this would havethe double disadvantage of leaving the “sex diary” to circulate in pirated form,and in rendering parts of the “Black Magic Journal” incomprehensible, since itrefers back so frequently to the earlier notebook. Besides, I have been toldthat the duplicated copies of the “sex diary” were abridged—that is, everythingthat would not appeal to the public that gloats over these things was cut out.These included, of course, all the “metaphysical discussions of sex” that werefor me the main point of the diary. It is hardly surprising that the book hasacquired a reputation in certain circles as high-class pornography. I think itwill be seen, from the present edition, that the intentions were anything butpornographic—that, in fact, the book owes more to Gabriel Marcel’s MetaphysicalJournal than to Frank Harris.The journals, as printed here, are unabridged and completely unaltered, exceptfor correction of spelling mistakes, an occasional rearrangement of words andthe addition of a few footnotes. In two places, I have been advised to omit asentence; where this has happened, I have left blanks in the text of the samelength. (These can be found on pages 66 and 108). I have also begun this journalwith the final pages of an earlier notebook, for reasons of continuity that willbe apparent. I have resisted the temptation to divide the journal into twoparts—before and after I met Cunningham—because this would seem to be an apologyfor its lack of unity, whereas, on rereading it, I feel that it neverthelesspossesses a certain unity of idea and intention.One extremely difficult problem arose in connection with this book—the questionof persons other than myself who are treated in it. My original intention was tochange all names so that most of the people could not be identified. But incertain cases—Oliver Glasp or Robert Kirsten, for example, this would benonsensical, since their names are too well known and their identities tooobvious. In other cases, the problem was whether I had a right to publishcertain details of the private lives of the persons concerned. Public figuresmay be regarded to some extent as public property, but this is certainly nottrue of “private persons” who prefer to remain private. So in a very few casesin this book, I have changed names and an occasional personal detail, to obscurethe identity. However, it is obvious that too much of this would defeat the aimof publishing this journal by giving the pirated copies a kind of scandal value.I therefore wish to thank many of the people concerned for their permission topublish the passages in which they are mentioned.Finally, I wish to thank my wife for her patience in typing out these notebooks,and the publishers for their help and encouragement.Corrib Cottage, MoycullenGALWAY"},{"pageContent":"THE DIARYOct. 20. Today I feel a strange state of excitement and anticipation—there is aheavy, Christmassy atmosphere, the kind of thing I haven’t experienced sincechildhood. This is no doubt due to a heavy cold in the head that started twodays ago. Last night I drank half a pint of whisky before I went to bed; my noseand throat were blazing, and my left eye felt as if it was hanging out of myhead. I also took two aspirin. I slept like a rock, and woke this morningwithout a hangover, but feeling a strange and pleasant detachment from reality.My head is still thick, but the world feels as if I were looking at it throughthe long end of a telescope. The cold insulates me. I feel like Proust. Iremember a line of Maurice’s: “The dusk is gray with longing.” It expresses thealmost musical nostalgia I experience as I write this.Curious. I wish I understood myself. What is it that happens in these moods—interms of emotional chemistry, I mean? All my life I have fought the present. Isimply don’t like existing “here and now.” Unless the world is richer—unless ithas other depths and dimensions, I loathe it. My attention is like a gramophoneneedle; in the normal course of events it is confined in a narrow groove of thepresent. Things are too obtrusive. I open my eyes; I am too aware of the thingsI look at; they edge their way into my consciousness and push me backward.Today, all that is changed. The world is covered with a pearl-gray mist; realityis cushioned. When I look out of my window, what I see doesn’t press itself onme, like an annoying stranger on a train; it keeps its distance, respectful,discreet. And I can be aware of all kinds of other things. Or I could compare itto listening to music. If music is too loud and stupid, it isolates you, likepain. But there is such a thing as good background music, that only makesconversation more pleasant, or forms a pleasant accompaniment to reading.This is what the world ought to be—background music. Then that other world—offeelings and memories—gets a chance to express itself. I wonder why a bad coldreleases so many memories? I can sit here, on my bed, a large mug of strong teabeside me, and this notebook on my knee, and cast my mind to almost any periodof my life. Usually, the images I am able to evoke are shadows or abstractions.Today they come up like heavy incense; every memory brings its distinctatmosphere.I believe that the brain is full of well-worn paths, rather like the scratcheson a gramophone record that always make the needle jump several tracks. Undernormal circumstances my mind, fueled mainly by my intellect, is driven alongpaths of associative thinking. In this mood, I am freed from the “scratches”; Ican sink into my own being, leaving my conscious self sitting contentedly hereon the bed, ignored, while I clamber down a rope into the mineshaft of myself. Iused to be fond of comparing man’s being to an iceberg, with only a third (theconsciousness) above the waterline; but this is nonsense; the part above thewaterline is actually a tenth—perhaps a hundredth or a thousandth. Why ...Blast that phone.That was Caroline. I told her I had a lousy cold and that she hadn’t better comeover for fear of catching it. I wish there were some other way of writing thatwas quicker than this. My thoughts move too fast; they’re like fireworks today,leaping, blazing, exploding, and my body feels an extraordinary sense of catlikecomfort. My body’s normally such a fucking nuisance; it won’t let me go farwithout clamoring for attention, so that writing and thinking is a perpetualstruggle with it. I understand why Socrates told Phaedo that the philosopherspends his life trying to escape the body.Today I feel free even of sexual desire. This is something. I’m afraid that,ever since my childhood, I’ve been oversexed. I sometimes wonder about this. Asfar as I can determine, it was born in me, for I can recall sexual excitementlong before I learned the “facts” about sex or began to think of sex with acertain morbid excitement. One of these days, I must try to write fully andhonestly about sex ... but it would be necessary to buy a separate notebook, andalso to buy a box that will lock. I’m sure Carlotta reads my manuscripts andletters and I wouldn’t put it past that nosy cow of a landlady to read anythingshe can find.My sexual desire is undoubtedly connected with this normal “confinement in thepresent.” This warm, hazy nostalgia I feel today is exactly like sexualfulfillment.Oct. 21. Gertrude called and I had to break off yesterday. But I shall use thisnew notebook for the purpose I mentioned—a kind of “sex diary.” This morning, Ipicked up a small chest in the local junk shop—the sort sailors take to sea—andbought a heavy Yale lock. It’s strange—the effect of being secretive, the joyand stimulation of it. I now feel as if I want to go on writing non-stop for tenyears. Why shouldn’t I fill a thousand pages? I wish my shorthand were better,though; I’d like to keep a diary in shorthand, but can’t read it back. I wonderif Pepys could read his diary back—almost certainly not, I imagine. BertrandRussell used to keep a diary in English, but written with Greek letters. A longjob. I often wonder why I dislike Russell’s mind so much. I suppose it isbecause we could both be called “inductive existentialists.” All my work isexistential in the sense that it badly wants to stick to living experience; butit’s inductive because it wants to reason from the particular to the general.Russell’s mind is also inductive, but it’s certainly existential, because he’salways writing about marriage, education, etc. And yet somehow the two neverquite manage to connect.There I go. That is also my problem; I’m too much an intellectual to stick tothe “basic facts,” like sex ...Yet, since I’ve begun, I should try. I still feel this sense of distance fromreality, although no longer so strongly; I am getting back to the “world” Inormally live in. I didn’t stay with Gertrude last night; not merely because Ihad a cold, but because this strangely distant mood makes me feel already as Ioccasionally feel after an orgasm—serene and awake, as if the power of mythought had been magnified tenfold—or perhaps merely that my bleeding nuisanceof a body is temporarily satisfied. I wonder if it will become less of anuisance as I get older? I recall one occasion, eight years ago, when Iexperienced this total serenity through sex. Donald Baumgarten had invited me togo with him to Birmingham one Christmas; he was working with another Jewishbloke called Morrie, selling all kinds of things in the market. I enjoyed itall; I liked the crowds and the excitement, and the lights in the market late atnight—even the cold in the air. At one point, I was standing in front of themarket stall, jammed forward by the crowd. Behind me stood a girl—probably ayoung married woman, on the plump side. She was watching Donald over myshoulder, and her thighs and belly were pressed very tight against my behind.After a few minutes of this, I began to feel an intense sexual excitement. Butthe delightful thing was that time seemed to have stood still—or rather, mydesire stood still, quiescent, neither vanishing nor overflowing. She couldn’thave been pressed more tightly against me if I’d been lying on her in bed. Icould feel the hardness of her garters against my legs. She must have beenwearing a thin dress, because I was soon conscious of her warmth against me. Thecurious thing was that she kept making very slight movements, each one of whichmade my excitement rise like the mercury in a thermometer. I still don’t knowwhether she was aware of my excitement, and experienced it herself, but hermovements seemed calculated—a tiny wriggle that convinced me that I couldactually feel her pubic hairs against me. After what seemed about a quarter ofan hour (but must have been less) I could bear it no longer; I pretended to makea movement to get a handkerchief out of my pocket; this pressed me against hereven more tightly and also pressed my overcharged loins against the table in acontinuous friction. I am sure she must have felt the slight convulsions of theclimax; as if in response, her whole body pressed tight against me. I stoodthere, very still, watching Donald selling off a case of alarm clocks at what heclaimed was a fraction of their market value, and feeling as full of sweetnessas a barrel of treacle. It lasted all the time I stood there—only a few minuteslonger, because the selling stopped and some of the crowd dispersed. The womanbehind me went. I didn’t turn to look at her—I suppose I felt ashamed. And yet Ifelt no guilt, not a shred—and all the way home that night, driving in the lorryand watching the cats’ eyes coming out of the dark, there was the same completeserenity inside me. I was a virgin then; I sometimes felt guilt aboutmasturbation (although never much); but this was different; it had taken placeout in the real world, and yet it was like a sexual daydream. I always fearedthat the world of imagination and the “real world” would prove to be completelyincompatible, would simply never connect, so that I’d be doomed to a lifetime ofironic frustration. This occasion seemed like a promise of something better, offulfillment. It also raised the question: How far are men capable of absolutefulfillment? Of expressing everything they have in them? More of this later.I found it curiously difficult to write the above paragraph—as if I were writingdirt, I suppose. No doubt I was, by certain standards. And yet are our sexualexperiences to remain perpetually confined to this limbo? Either never mentionedat all, as in Trollope, or mentioned with an awful degraded gloating, as in Sadeor Frank Harris?An hour later. Gertrude came in and brought me a small bottle of rum, which sheinsisted on heating with lemon and sugar and watching me drink. This kind ofthing worries and embarrasses me. I know that by normal standards, I’m a swine.I also know that if she found out I was still seeing Caroline, she’d neverforgive me. Yet I can’t quite convince myself that I’m in the wrong. I feelobscurely that there’s something I should learn from all this.I’m sometimes astounded at Gertrude’s capacity to close her mind. For example,when she speaks about Austin,1 she mentions him casually, as if he were a memberof the family who is away in another country. My attitude, I know, is morbid.And yet I can’t help brooding about the women he killed, and trying to makemyself feel as if I were the murderer. Austin’s father came to see me a fewweeks ago. I’d never met him, never heard from him before. He turned out to be acurious man—very tall, like Austin, with a bald head and thick lips, and anunpleasant air of power—ordinary material power, mostly used for evil. Gertrudetells me that he is one of England’s six richest men, and that he gives a lot tocharity—with one eye on a peerage. That may be true, but I know that in anenlightened country, his kind would be exterminated, quickly and painlessly. Hisostensible excuse for coming to see me was to “thank me” for standing by Austin,and to give me a check for £250. (I know I should have refused this, but whenyou’ve been living on £5 a week for two years, it represents so many luxuriesthat you’d almost forgotten.) What he really wanted was to find out if I wasAustin’s pathic, and if I shared Austin’s taste for beating people. I thinkthat, in a way I can only sense, Austin fascinates him. Are all these men—thepower-men—driven by a kind of sadism, I wonder? He can’t help feeling—I knowthis—that in a funny sort of way, Austin has “made good” by becoming a sexkiller. He tells me, incidentally, that Austin has become far more openly“dotty” since he’s been under confinement, and that it is difficult to make himtake any interest in anything. God knows how much it’s costing him to keepthings hushed up. The newspapers haven’t mentioned the Whitechapel killer fortwo months now. I would have thought this kind of thing was impossible. Orperhaps he’s not really having to exert influence; perhaps the police and thenewspapers have come to a kind of agreement not to refer to the case “for thepublic good.” I read that an old lady in Bow had committed suicide because ofthe murders.And yet, in a strange way, I can’t help envying Austin the experience of murder.No, I don’t mean that I want to commit a sex crime (and I’d certainly have nointerest in committing any other sort of murder). And yet I wish my imaginationwas powerful enough to tell me exactly what it would be like to commit a murder.Why are we such miserably inefficient machines? I am perpetually aware of mytremendous limitations. For some odd reason, it suits the gods, or destiny, tohave us inefficient. I often feel as if I’m driving a car with the brakes onwhen I try to use my imagination to solve a problem. Or as if I’m trying tolight a fire of wet wood with damp matches. The resources of the brain areenormous. It is undoubtedly the most complicated machine ever invented. Incomparison, all other machines are incredibly childish. It can store a hundredlanguages, knowledge of literature, music, mathematics, science, philosophy. Andit can do all this simultaneously. Sherlock Holmes was talking rubbish when hetold Watson that he couldn’t care less whether the sun goes around the earth orvice versa, because the mind can only store a limited number of facts. The braincould hold all the knowledge of all the libraries in the world, and a humanbeing could still live a full sex life and social life, without losing an atomof human sympathy or physical well-being. All this I know. In occasional momentsof vision, I have seen that there is no reason why a man should not be a god.And yet what actually happens? I sometimes wake up at midday, make tea, try towrite, and fail, try to read, and lose interest, do the shopping, get a meal,and feel totally exhausted by six in the evening. Why? Because in some way mybody is working at minimum efficiency. Imagine that a tribe of ignorant nativesfinds a motor car, and decides that it makes an ideal storage room for food. Sowhen they set out on a journey, they load it with food, attach ropes to it, andpull it through the jungle as if it were a cart. One of them, fiddling aboutinside it, discovers the hand brake and releases it. Immediately, they find thecar much easier to pull. They congratulate the discoverer, tell him he is agenius, and convince themselves that they now know the purpose and use of thecar.This is how I feel with my body. Occasionally, as I am dragging it along, itaccidentally gets into gear; there is a roar, and the engine starts for amoment. Then, just as quickly, it cuts out. But I know that this body is notmerely designed for this boring, irritating, two-dimensional life that so easilybecomes a burden to me.This, I suppose, is the reason for my sympathy with Austin. Since last year,I’ve read books about various sex killers—Heath, Christie, Kürten, and theyrepel and horrify me. And yet I still feel that Austin was dimly, vaguely tryingto follow his own deepest nature to some unheard-of form of self-expression. Itis strange that he always makes me think of Nijinsky ...All of which brings me back to the sexual problem. There have been moments whenI wonder whether all romantics—and I am essentially a romantic—are completelymistaken in their basic assumption. They all feel that they only need the “key”to life, the “way”—and that man will be able to turn on at will these tremendousmoods of exaltation and power. But consider a dray horse, or that poor old redsetter they keep chained up next door. The lives of these animals are veryboring indeed; no one pretends that the animal is “completely fulfilled.” Heisn’t supposed to be. He is supposed to be useful to his master.An evolutionist would argue that man’s limitations are a necessary part of hislow position on the evolutionary ladder. He is not so far above the monkey andthe cave man; why should he expect visions? I see this point of view. And yetthere are moments when I am convinced that man is actively impeded from climbinghigher by some force that finds him most useful in his present position. Itwants us to live like cars with their brakes on; it wants our consciousness toremain so narrow and absurd that we never learn to put two and two together. Itis true that I have never had the least doubt of my own genius. But what is thatgenius in the scales of what man could attain? It merely means that I have oneless spanner in my works than most people; the “force” has done a slightly lessefficient job of wrecking me.And yet I’m not a pessimist. Because there is something in me that drives me on.Whatever the force that holds us down, I don’t think it is malign—not entirelyso, anyway. We are not mere sheep waiting for the butcher, being fattened andexploited.Of one thing I am certain. The sexual force is the nearest thing to magic—to thesupernatural—that human beings ever experience. It deserves perpetual and closestudy. No study is so profitable to the philosopher. In the sex force, he canwatch the purpose of the universe in action.This is my most important conclusion about sex so far: there is no such thing assex for its own sake. The libido is a myth.Later. I recall the earliest impressions ever made on me by sex—by sexualknowledge, I should say, for I was always aware of the force of sex. It wassomehow a powerful and obscene force that demanded a definite “descent,” a lossof pride and dignity. I recall an old joke I heard at school that expresses thisaspect. A newly married husband was too shy to touch his wife, so she guided hishand to her sexual regions, then said: “Now do something dirty”—so he emptiedhis bowels. I am sure that most of us at school thought that marriage was anideal kind of state because it was a way of legalizing “something dirty.” Again,I think of a red-haired boy called Barrett who talked of nothing but sex. Oneday, I heard two of his friends laughing about him. They had been to the theaterthe night before, and had picked up three girls in the balcony. Barrettdisappeared into a back street with his girl; when his friends went to look forhim, he was fucking her against a dustbin. They called to him, but he wasapparently unable to stop. The boys imitated his motion obscenely, jerking thehips back and forward like a dog with a mechanical motion. This stuck in my mindfor a long time—sex as the force that turned men into dogs. The worst of it wasthat, even so, I envied Barrett.And yet compare this to Bill Payne’s attitude to women. I know that he actuallyfinds the sexual act a letdown after the pleasure of seduction. There’ssomething delightful in his perpetual enthusiasm, the way he says: “Women,Gerard, women. They’re delicious.” I honestly believe he could devote his lifeto the pursuit of women, like Casanova, finding in each one a new universe. He’san example of the sexual illusion at its most intense—and in many ways, at itsbest.And yet consider my own case at the moment. I am involved with two womensimultaneously. From Bill’s point of view, the fact that Caroline is Gertrude’sniece makes it only more piquant. I could sleep with either of them tonight. Andyet this knowledge destroys the excitement and the desire. Somehow, the value ofsex is in its life-enhancing value, not in the sex itself.For example, Caroline has been in her flat for three months now, and I spend alot of time there with her. Madeleine, the girl she rooms with, obviously has anambivalent attitude to me. I think she envies Caroline her sleeping partner, yetat the same time, feels she ought to be shocked. The other night, I took Billaround there for supper, and then we got rather happy on burgundy. Finally,Madeleine, claiming that she had to be up early, went off for a bath, and thengot into bed. But we all went into her room, and had a last drink. Then Bill andCaroline decided that we ought to get just one more bottle of wine before theshop closed and went off together to get it. I simply stayed on Madeleine’s bed,kissing her. She opened her mouth and let me excite her; I started to kiss herneck, then went lower, and finally pulled down the top of her nightdress andbegan to kiss her nipples. She simply lay there, with her eyes closed, lookingas if she were listening to a heavenly choir, and would obviously have let me goon all night if Bill and Caroline hadn’t returned. And yet as soon as they cameinto the room, she pulled the sheet around her neck and started talking as ifnothing had happened. And this is the girl who told us a few days later that sheintended to keep her virginity for her husband.Still, I must confess that the situation appealed to me more than any of itsindividual elements explains. I like lying there in the morning, watchingCaroline get out of bed and get dressed. She has no self-consciousness, andusually asks me which panties I think she ought to wear, then wanders in and outin her underwear until she’s made tea. (I suspect this may not be asuncalculated as she’d like me to think; very few mornings have gone by when Ihaven’t pulled her back into bed and undressed her again.) Gertrude never letsme watch her get dressed; she always vanishes into the bathroom in a dressinggown and appears fully clothed.Usually I stay there when Caroline and Madeleine have gone out—Caroline to herdrama school, Madeleine to her office. I stare out of the window at thewarehouses opposite, and nearly always have a kind of wrestling match with myconsciousness. I think: “Here I am, in a situation that ought to delight me, inthe bed of a pretty blonde. Tonight I shall be in another woman’s bed. And yet Istare at these warehouses ... and they are meaningless. Why? Why does thisexperience mean so little to me?” I am like a man dying of thirst who has founda spring—but it flows only in tiny drops, so that he has to wait five minutesfor each drop to fall. Most of us hunger for experience, for life. Our wholeentertainment industry is built up on this naive hunger: the shopgirl who wantsto identify herself with Norma Talmadge being carried off into the desert byRudolph Valentino.The other night, on my way to see Caroline, I remembered that she wanted somestockings, and went into a ladies’ shop in Kensington High Street to get them.As I turned around from the counter, I found myself looking into one of thosecubicles where women try on dresses. The woman hadn’t bothered to draw thecurtain, and was pulling a dress over her head. Since she was blinded by thedress, she wasn’t aware that I was looking at her—and I took care to look myfill before the dress came off—and then she realized that she was standing infront of a man in exactly the same clothes that Caroline wears to make the teain the morning. I pretended not to have seen her, of course, and heard thecurtain hastily drawn. But I practically had to limp out of the shop. I was inan appalling state of sexual excitement—due to the unexpectedness of it, Isuppose. I was burning from head to foot with lust. But the trouble with it wasthat simply hurling Caroline onto her bed wouldn’t necessarily have satisfiedit. It was its lack of object that shattered me. The woman—as I had time tonotice—was middle-aged; her figure was good, but not startling. Caroline is inevery way a better candidate for lust. If I had found the woman in my bed, Idoubt whether I’d have been able to summon the appetite to take her. And yet Irecognized that the intensity of desire I felt could easily drive a man tomurder and rape. I am, I hope, incapable of either, and yet I was trembling withexcitement—an unhealthy, burning excitement that does no good. As I passed othergirls in the street, women returning from offices, I felt: All these women havethe same capacity to arouse this feeling hidden below this opaque outer layer ofclothing. Our society is sitting on a sexual powder barrel. Is it any wonderthat the rate of sex crimes is going up? As men go, I think I’m capable of afair degree of self-discipline and self-restraint. But if other men are lessrestrained than I, God help them. And God help civilization. We only need a warto prove how thin “civilization” is. Men go in for rape and sadism as if theywere born to it. I remember how a man came to talk to us at school, and told usabout how he had been in a train wreck, and had helped the rescue workers torelease trapped people in spite of his own injuries. But I still recall that mymain feeling was sexual excitement at the thought of unconscious women inrailway carriages who could be quickly violated before being dragged to safety.I wonder how many more of the boys who heard him had the same thought. I nevertold anyone; I would have been too ashamed, and even schoolboy sexual franknessseldom goes to that length. And yet what stability can we expect of acivilization built on this kind of basis? Unless, of course, I can comfortmyself with the thought that I am completely abnormal, and other men neverentertain such daydreams.What conclusions do I draw from all this? I believe that, far from being“abnormal,” the intensity of my sexual impulse is a part of the total intensitythat makes me what I am—an intelligent being, responding with unusual directnessto the problems of modern civilization. I watch my sexual impulse at work with akind of amazement. I may not know why I’m alive, but something inside me does.Sex is the only power I know that can defeat the awful pressure of the present.The world looks blank and meaningless, gray, pointless, mocking my brevity andhunger with its permanence and serenity. Only when sexual desire blazes in mecan I overcome its indifference; the desire turns on it like a flame thrower; mybody suddenly carries a current of thousands of volts, surging from some maindown in my subconscious; I become realer than the world; harder, intenser, morelasting.I know that this power exists in me for other purposes than sex. Sometimes itcan be evoked by music or literature or ideas. Something like it flows in me nowas I write this because I am writing with excitement, enjoying being able to pindown these ideas into words. I feel like a detective cross-examining the world,trying to trap it into admissions of purpose. I know bloody well it exists—animmense power and purpose. So why am I left outside? This damned lying cheat ofa world. I don’t know yet why I exist. I feel superfluous, like a gramophone inthe middle of the Sahara desert. And yet there are times when I almost getplugged in, when some of my plugs find their sockets, and there’s a whisper ofpower in my nerves. I predict there will be a day when all man’s purpose will beon the surface; he will know, he will understand, instead of living in thisblackness of ignorance. Instead of having to strain his ears to catch murmursfrom his own depths, he will have a clear conscious understanding of hispurpose.And yet I am always aware that the central problem is the problem of my body, mystupid, intractable body. My body is my despair. How can I achieve the kind ofthings I want when my body is so unutterably stupid? I am like a carpenter whois asked to build a house of rotten, worm-eaten wood, or like a dressmaker whois asked to design clothes for a queen out of dyed sugar-sacks.There have been so many occasions when I have felt that the time wasted in sleepis an indignity, and have tried to keep myself awake half the night. My eyelidsclose against my will, and I lie down with a sense of defeat, realizing that itis barely twelve hours since I got out of this same bed. And yet there are othertimes, when I’ve had little sleep, when a book or an idea interests me; suddenlyI notice that it is four o’clock in the morning, and I am still not tired. Mybody responds badly to bullying, and yet allows excitement to charm it intoobedience. If only I had the secret of charming at will. It happensunexpectedly, or takes twelve hours of continuous mental struggle to produce afew hours of serenity. But in these hours of serenity, the body is at lastworking with decent efficiency, and I understand what life would be like if Iknew the secret. Is life bound to be a losing battle with the body, a struggleagainst its sheer insensitivity, in which our artificial allies—alcohol,drugs—only lend their aid at ruinous rates of interest?Can any of us fail to be interested in this fight against the body? I know of noone who is worth tuppence who hasn’t tried to beat and torture his body intoobedience. Bill Payne once starved himself for a week, and told me he began toexperience visions, to feel a strange lightness, as if the body had finallysurrendered. Oliver Glasp slept naked on the bare wires of his bed. I have aphotograph of his picture of Matthew Lovatt in the room now—the man who tried tocrucify himself in Geneva. I think it probably his best painting; every strokeof the brush shows the intensity of his involvement with the subject. Only suchmen deserve any consideration; all others are weaklings and dupes.Oct. 22. Caroline interrupted me last night. This was probably just as well; Ifelt tired, but resented my inability to keep on working.She wanted to talk to me about dropping Gertrude. I didn’t quite see her point.At the moment, I don’t give a damn—I’d drop Caroline and Gertrude without aqualm. Gertrude is an emotional blackmailer; she takes care to be undemandingand generous and attentive, then allows me to see that she’s unhappy and unsureof me. I never leave her without feeling guilt. I’m fond of her—I respondinstinctively to affection. But it’s all so bloody irrelevant at the moment.Whenever I leave her place, there seems to be a mist of irony hanging overLondon.I wish I could explain this more fully. It’s worth explaining. When I first metGertrude, I was puzzled by her apparent independence; she seemed to have come toterms with herself and with some kind of belief that made her independent ofclose relationships. This fascinated me; I wanted to know what it was that gaveher this strength. When I got to know her better, I realized it was ordinaryreticence—a refusal to confess to loneliness. At first, there was a strangecharm about the affair. I didn’t particularly like being fed and plied withdrink; it made me feel too dependent. But I liked the way Gertrude started tocome here and turn out my dirty clothes and lug them off home to wash them. (Shehas a machine that does it all in a quarter the time it would take me.) I alsolike the curious way in which she surrendered herself. I can still remember theexcitement I felt about very minor things. This, for example. One evening, Istarted to kiss her on the settee. She doesn’t like being undressed downstairs;she feels it’s not respectable. After a few minutes she began to get excited,and I started to get her skirt up around her waist. At this moment she sat up,and told me she had to go out to the lavatory. So I had to contain myself. Inthe meantime, I made sure the curtains were properly drawn and the back doorlocked. She came back in and lay down, and I started to go through thepreliminaries again. When I got my hand under her dress, I discovered to myastonishment that she had taken off her panties, and had apparently rubbed somekind of cream on herself that made entrance very easy. As I think back on this,I can still recall my shock of surprise on discovering that she had no pants. Itwas so unlike her. She prefers everything to be in the dark, and the ritual hasto be strictly observed. She prefers to get dressed and undressed in thebathroom; but if, for some reason, she gets undressed when I’m in bed, she takescare never to take off her clothes in their natural order—apparently feelingthat this would somehow place her on a level with a strip-tease artist. Sheloosens her bra, eases her pants down under her slip, then does a curious littlewiggle that brings the whole lot down around her feet; then she makes a leap forthe light, and hurls herself into bed in one movement, the idea being that Ishould see as little of her as possible without clothes.Caroline is amusingly different. She doesn’t give a damn about whether she’sdressed or not, and her attitude toward sex is sometimes so Rabelaisian that itshocks even me. She said to me the other day: “No, you can’t fuck me now,there’s not time. Masturbate when I’ve gone.” The other day, I went with her toa fitting for a dress in the play she’s doing; she’d unexpectedly spent thenight here, and wasn’t wearing a petticoat.Apparently she had to take off her skirt so they could get the measurements. Iasked her who took them, and she said: “Oh, a middle-aged queer and a rathernice young boy.” I asked her if it didn’t embarrass her to stand in her pants infront of two men (she admitted she didn’t know that either of them was queer).Obviously, this idea had never entered her head. Sex is something nice you do inbed with your clothes off; it never strikes her that the sight of a girl in herunderwear might excite a man.Why, under the circumstances, Caroline should want me to drop Gertrude, I don’tknow. I’m certain she even takes a pleasure in feeling that we’re deceivingGertrude. Brooding on this, and recalling various hints dropped by Caroline, Iconclude that she has marriage in mind. God knows why. I suppose she has theusual female desire for security. I don’t think it’s me in particular she wants,although she thinks she’s infatuated with me. She admits that there are two filmactors she’s crazy about, and that she’d probably leap into bed with either ofthem if she got the chance ...Later. I’ve been reading a paperback I picked up yesterday, The Protagonists byJames Barlow, which, according to the jacket, is the story of a sex crime. It isa very good novel, but is certainly not the story of a sex crime. It is about ashifty ex-RAF type who sees a beautiful red-headed girl in a shop and goes toenormous lengths to seduce her, persuading her that he’s unmarried. He stranglesher when she tells him she’s pregnant. In this case, all the sex took placebefore the crime, which was no more “sexual” than any robbery with violence. Theauthor has done a good job of portraying a certain type of criminal, theconfidence trickster, the dishonest Romeo. This type is far more common than thereal sex criminal. It’s impossible not to feel that his misdeeds come under theheading of miscalculation rather than crime. Criminality implies anacknowledgement of and a respect for society. You cannot imagine a Beethoven orBernard Shaw committing crimes because neither cared enough about society. Thismeans that “master criminals” are rare, because when a man has enough vitalityto become a master of anything he has too much sense to waste himself and hisevolutionary potentialities on an antisocial act. It is amusing to imagine a manof “noble mind” deliberately setting out to be a criminal, but impossible tofollow the idea to serious lengths because the first characteristic of a man whohas any touch of greatness is an inability to hurt anybody. This is what I neverrealized about Austin—until almost too late.But reading Barlow’s book makes me aware not only of the essential stupidity ofthe criminal, but also of the essential silliness of the seducer. There is agirl at the tobacconist on the corner whom I’d love to screw, and the way shewears tight skirts and sweaters and smiles seductively convinces me that itwould be possible. But I think of the sheer boredom of the consequences, of herproximity to this place, and drop the idea without a qualm. If I could offer herfive pounds for an hour in bed, and no “consequences” I’d take it like a shot.And yet I could never bear the idea of a prostitute, and am sure I’d be a totalfailure if I ever found myself in bed with one ...Strange, the amazing amount of energy men waste on seduction. I suppose it’s oneof the most basic mechanisms of the healthy male—looking at a girl, trying toimagine what she’d be like undressed, and then the thought: “I must have her.”Even if it takes ten years. Or costs a fortune in expensive meals and theaters.Or involves marrying her. This latter, I suppose, is the biological explanationfor the mechanism. Otherwise, why should Barlow’s murderer go to such absurdlengths to screw a girl, just because she’s red-headed and looks innocent? Isone cunt any different from another? I know it’s not. I recently woke up in themiddle of the night and made love to a girl I assumed to be Caroline, then wentto sleep again. (Caroline doesn’t mind being screwed unceremoniously at anyhour.) In the morning, Gertrude was reproachful because I’d had her withoutgoing through the usual ritual of endearments. Reduced to its physical basis,the sexual act is about as unexciting as driving a car is to a salesman. Theemotions and delusions count for everything. Bill told me an amusing story fromhis days as an RAF policeman in Hamburg. A German photographer made his livingselling dirty pictures, in which his wife was his chief model; he wouldphotograph her in all kinds of positions with a big Greek sailor. He was alsosubtler than these fellows usually are; he made a fortune from a series ofpictures showing the sailor hiding behind a curtain and watching the wife getundressed, and then knocking her out and raping her. But Bill told me that thepartnership broke up one day when the photographer observed that the sailor wasmoving more than was strictly necessary for the photographs, and that he had anorgasm inside the wife. This was strictly infra dig. The physical act in itselfmeant nothing; what mattered was that the sailor was putting his emotions intoit and not treating it strictly as a matter of business. The photographerproposed Bill as the sailor’s replacement; Bill, unfortunately, was notattracted by the wife.An interesting concept emerges from all this. What exactly was the sailor“putting into” the act when he allowed himself to have an orgasm? Emotion? No,too vague. Desire, lust, excitement? All too vague. What he was really puttinginto it was the same quality that makes an African savage die of sheer nerveswhen a witch doctor puts a spell on him. Or—and this is nearer to it—what makesa good Catholic believe that the host is Christ’s body, etc. A quality of innercontent, meaning. If a fly settles on my face, I try to squash itinstantaneously, as a pure reflex. If someone pulls my hair, I lash out at himwith a pure reflex of rage. In both these cases, the act is saturated withmeaning; my interest, my desire, my vitality, fill the act as I might fill aglass with water at a tap.On the other hand, in the days when I worked in an office, this quality ofmeaning was exactly what was missing from my days. Sometimes, on my way to work,I would wonder if I’d shaved, and I’d have to put my hand to my face to findout. The act was so ritualistic, so devoid of meaning, that I had no memory ofit. After six months in that office, I had got so used to this ritualistichalf-life that I fell into a kind of emotional paralysis, an emotionalcounterpart of sexual impotence. Music ceased to move me; I could still think,but no real feelings or intuitions drove my thoughts. This total boredom didn’tvanish until I was on holiday at Marden, in Kent, and I suddenly thought hownice it would be to destroy Western civilization, and all the shits who can livethese rotten half-lives in their meaningless offices without going insane. Thehatred got me started again ...I wish I could think of a word to describe the meaning-content thatdistinguishes a vital experience from the ritual that constitutes about 90 percent of living. I suppose it’s sheer vitality, since to the really vital,everything is interesting.I feel all the time that vital purpose has become muffled in moderncivilization. If only we knew exactly what we were doing, exactly where we’regoing. I hated the office job because I knew that the purposes to which I wasdevoting my day were mean and trivial; knowing the limited nature of thepurposes, the vitality in me refused to respond. It is true that when I try tosquash a fly on my face, I am also aware of the limited nature of the purpose;but this is an instantaneous physical response. Only sex surprises me all thetime by filling the act with a vitality that seems to rise of its own accord.Here is an example of what I mean. Carlotta rather attracts me—she has thehealthy, shapely body of a German country girl. I am pretty sure she once hadideas about me. I never tried to follow this up, because I could see thehopelessness of having a mistress on the premises—especially one who can walkinto my room at any time on the pretext of cleaning it up.About two months ago, I heard the kettle upstairs whistling, and went rushingout of the door. Carlotta was on the landing, on top of a stepladder attackingthe cobwebs, and I cannoned into her before I could stop myself. She unbalancedand put her hands on my shoulders, and I took her weight and helped her down onto ground level again. Her wide skirt got caught on the top of the ladder andshe had to mount two of the steps to unhook it. In the meantime, I had time toadmire her legs—which are by no means spoiled by the thick black stockings shewears to work—and her behind, which was visible enough. (I can never understandwhy girls bother to wear panties that might as well be made of pink cellophane.)When she got unhooked, my reaction was completely automatic; I simply pulled herto me and found myself shamelessly pressing my loins against her so that shecould have no doubt whatever of the precise physical nature of my response. Shelooked very pink, but not at all displeased. I said “God, Carlotta ... ,” andthen had to stop myself from saying: “For Christ’s sake let’s get into bed.” Shedidn’t even try to disentangle herself, and I sensed that she’d probablyagree—or at least promise to come back later—and I remembered that Caroline wasdue to come around. So I just gulped half a dozen times, kissed her, and rushedupstairs without looking back. When I came down again, I said rather lamely:“You shouldn’t do things like that. You’ll get raped against the banisters.” Shejust laughed and said: “I didn’t do anything,” which was obvious enough anyway.So I said: “If you intend to climb stepladders, you ought to wear ballettights.” She looked pleased at the implied compliment to the seductive nature ofher underwear, and I escaped into my room. When Caroline came an hour later, Iscrewed hell out of her, but my mind wasn’t on her. I wonder if these mentalinfidelities in the act of intercourse are frequent, and if Caroline imaginesthat she’s being embraced by one of her favorite film stars.This Carlotta episode really makes me feel I’m a Jekyll and Hyde. Oh, I know I’mfairly sexually excitable, and I take account of this in my conscious idea ofmyself and my motivation. What shattered me, as I stood upstairs in the kitchen,was the force that was making my hands tremble as I tried to lift the kettle.Hector asks Shotover how long he can think of a subject without its beingbranded in his brain for the rest of his life, and Shotover answers “Half anhour.” Well, I think that I shall still be able to evoke the sight of Carlotta’slegs, the area of white between the top of the stocking and the panties, thegarters stretched tight between them, the shadow of pubic hair showing clearlythrough the thin nylon, to the end of my life. I felt as if an elephant hadtrampled over me. Above all, I found myself asking myself: “What is it in youthat is opposing this overwhelming and simple desire to pull Carlotta into yourbedroom and undress her?” An animal would have no such self-division. I supposethis is what we call “the spirit of man,” the imagination, warning me that if Iscrew the girl, I’m going to have to leave this house within a month. And I likethe place.I am aware of certain things about myself with absolute clarity, all the time.And the most important is this: just as my body is perpetually subject to theforce of gravity, so my “spirit,” my mind, is subject to a kind of spiritualgravitational pull. It is a depressing force, exactly as if someone had attachedhooks to my clothes and hung weights on them. I can imagine an angel, someoneideally strong, as powerful as lightning, with a spirit like fire. And I canimagine such a being, who could never know the meaning of weakness, failing tonotice that human beings are unhappy, because after all, life surges on, incities as well as in the jungle. And I ask: Why am I not like that? Who hasattached these hooks to my spirit, to my imagination, and hung great weights onthem? For what reason are we so weighted down? The Catholics say Adam sinned,but since Adam never existed, this is unlikely. Why? WHY? I want to know. It isnot an abstract question. I feel it with all my being, for every moment of mylife. Who has tied this tin can to man’s tail?I’m not entirely defeatist about this. I think I’m fairly strong. I’m certainlystronger than the Graham Greenes and Aldous Huxleys and the rest. At least myintellect can get the problem into focus, which is the greatest step towardssolving it. Added to which, there have been the moments of insight ... I supposethat I’m a “stranger to revelation” if by revelation you mean something like theexperience of St. Paul. But there have been other moments—when my whole beingseemed to overflow with power, when I could see new areas of myself, when thepossibility of getting rid of the tin can and becoming a god did not seem toodistant. Hence the importance I attach to sex. I think of that scene in Wedekindwhere Jack the Ripper murders Lulu. The Ripper staggers out of her bedroom, hiseyes bulging, his chapped red hands (with their bitten nails) dripping with herblood, panting from sheer excess of relieved sexual tension, and mutters: “I wasalways a lucky fellow ... ,” knowing that the human spirit is not confined tothe flat earth of consciousness, but can also rise vertically, as if in ahelicopter.I have also known these revelations in sex, and I despair when I think of theinability of my language to fix their meanings. Yet it can be done; we cancreate new language, and language and sex will become allies, languageclarifying and purifying the sexual impulse, sex powering language to achieve anew complexity.Oct. 26. Today is one of those irritating, dull days when my brain and myfeelings refuse to co-operate; I don’t know what I want to do or where I want togo. I look at all the books on my shelf; nothing attracts me. I stare out of thewindow, then look through my records; I play a Schubert quartet, but after twominutes, my attention wanders, and then the music begins to irritate me. Myconsciousness hedges me in. I wish I had some kind of an explosive rocket tolaunch against this blank wall, to smash it down and free me from this prison ofboredom. There must be a way. For two days now, I have intended to go on writingin this diary, but for some reason, the thought repels me. However, I see noother solution but work. If I obeyed my boredom, I would sit down and try toread a few pages of about twenty books, make myself tea I don’t really want, tryto sleep, and succeed in wasting the day completely, as I wasted yesterday.I thought I would like to write about Mary and my first experience of sex, sinceit is undoubtedly true that no subsequent experience ever achieves the sameimportance. (Caroline tells me that all women keep a corner of themselves forthe man who takes their virginity, even if they subsequently sleep with a man anight.) And yet I feel less than garrulous about it all ...Mary, then ... I cannot remember her face as I write, except that it was oval,and rather pretty. She was fifteen, I was nearly nineteen at the time. It wastoo long to wait to lose my virginity. I remember reading somewhere that most ofthe great Elizabethans lost theirs at about the age of twelve, and no onethought anything of a girl having a baby at thirteen. Maybe that is what’s wrongwith modern society, and the reason for the overemphasis on sex. I know I shouldhave had my first sexual experience at thirteen, when I became aware of my body.The six-year wait was too long. I sometimes wonder if I shall ever be sexuallyhealthy, or if I shall always have a slightly “morbid” approach to sex becauseof that long wait when it seemed to me that I was doomed to a lifetime offrustration.I also remember my teens as a time of miserable shyness, when very small socialembarrassments could throw me into agonies that made me writhe withself-loathing for months afterward. Like farting once in front of a girl Irather liked, or merely stumbling in my speech and mispronouncing a word. Imention these things because they help to explain how sexual desire could becomemagnified until it became unhealthy.I met Mary at the first dance I attended after my National Service. I was notparticularly attracted by her; her hair had been soaked by the rain and hung inrat’s tails, and she looked about ten years old. At all events, I danced withher, then persuaded her to come with me into a pub, and later walked her home.She was in no way at all my “type” of girl. She worked as a waitress in a dirtylittle workman’s café near the bus station, had no interest in books or ideas,and had never been to the theater. I was even puzzled why she should beattracted to me; she admitted later that I wasn’t her type either. I should addthat I had no thought of sex with her. Or rather, I had, but only in a vague,hopeful sense. And I felt guilty because I was going out with a girl I didn’tparticularly like, simply because I might use her body. I felt like a murderer.That first night, I kissed her good night, in a chaste kind of way, and walkedback home feeling a fool. The next day, I went to the café for lunch, and weagreed to meet the next day. (She was not allowed out that evening—her familywas strict with her.) The following afternoon, a Sunday, we took a bus out intothe country, walked for a few miles, had tea in a café, and finally lay down ina haystack. We began to kiss—rather long, frustrating kisses. And suddenly, tomy astonishment, she opened my lips and darted her tongue between them. I foundthis interesting, but not exciting. Similarly, as we walked home and she placedmy hand on her breast, I felt that I ought to be excited, but wasn’t. But as wekissed good night, she could feel my sexual excitement, and raised it severaldegrees by rubbing herself against me in a way that suggested we wereexperiencing precisely the same desire.The following evening—it was midsummer, and uncomfortably hot—we again took along walk, and ended in a rather deserted park in a nearby village. We lay in ahollow and kissed, and pressed together as we had the night before. I had nothought of allowing my hands to stray—I was afraid it might upset her. Finally,we sat up and talked, but there was a curious, unstated frankness between us;she was aware of my excitement and I of hers. We kissed again, sitting up.Suddenly, she pointed to a darker spot on the gray of my flannels, and said:“Oh, look!” And with a candidness that staggered me, she unzipped me, andplunged her cool hand to the source of my excitement. The episode was not asexciting as it sounds here. I felt a little apprehensive that someone wouldapproach us, although we were sitting in a way that concealed what we weredoing; besides, she examined my member critically, and commented upon a certainfreckled appearance. Some children began to play ball close to us, and wedecided it was time to leave. All the way home on the bus, she kept my handpressed tight into her lap (except when people walked past our seat).The following week was frustrating. I saw her every day at lunchtime, and two orthree evenings. There were feverish hours in local parks, and an even worseevening in a local cinema. Although I have been told that a great deal of sexgoes on under cover of darkness in these places, I could not bring myself tobelieve that we were not under the supervision of the whole row; when Maryplaced her hand in my lap, a woman sitting next to me got up in a marked mannerand went to the end of the row. So we finally went home, without even seeing thefilm out to its end.But on the following Sunday, we decided to spend a day in the country, andaccordingly packed up a great deal of food and drink, and took a bus for tenmiles. We found ourselves a pleasant spot at the side of a stream, under sometrees, opened the food, and stood the bottles of lemonade in the water. Andfinally, after half an hour of looking around for mushrooms, we drank somedandelion wine that my grandmother had given me, and lay down in the mostsheltered spot we could find. Mary always tended to take the lead in thesesexual exercises; within about five minutes, she had me almost completelyundressed. I now, somewhat shyly, thrust my hand inside her dress, and worked itinside the elastic around the leg of her knickers. (She was wearing the bluethings that schoolgirls wear.) She giggled and said: “Aren’t you naughty.” Atthis point, I was frustrated. I knew absolutely nothing about female anatomy,and had always imagined the vagina to be situated further forward; she had toreach down and guide my hand. I was interested to observe my own reactions; Ifelt very little excitement—certainly not the maelstrom of ecstasy I had alwaysexpected. After a while, I tried, rather awkwardly, to move into a position moresuitable for mutual contact; I was clumsy, and she moved away, ordering me tolie on my back. Then, to my amazement, she sat astride me, grasped my overheatedmember as if it were a door handle, and in a rather businesslike way, loweredherself onto it. At this point, her face twisted with agony, and she gasped:“Ooh, don’t move!” So I obediently lay still, aware that I had penetrated her—orhad been used by her for penetration—and thought: “So this is what I’ve spentsix years speculating about? This is the great experience?” Although I feltenough excitement to maintain an erection, I was otherwise curiously detached.The feeling of her vagina, closed around me, might have been a warm glove, or myown hand. If I had been more of a romantic, I might have felt like crying: Whatabout the ecstasy? In about five minutes, she had begun to move on me, and I wasaware that I had to worry about pregnancy; so I asked her to move quickly. Wethen ate and drank, dozed a little, and continued in the same manner for therest of the day—seven times in all. After the second time, it no longer hurther, so she allowed me to assume the normal position; after the sixth time, shecomplained of soreness. In the late afternoon, feeling very tired, we walked outof the field, and I felt as though half my life had been passed there. I was notdisappointed. On the contrary, the elation I felt had little to do with sex. Ithink my feelings could be expressed like this: “At last I have no more reasonto be curious about women. I also have no more reason to suspect that destinyintends me for a life of frustration.” About the sexual experience itself, Ifelt: “So that was all,” and felt the kind of elation we feel about certainkinds of disillusionment.After that, the affair with Mary ran a fairly smooth course, except forquarrels. We met two or three times a week. I inquired among relatives aboutbaby-sitting, and got into the habit of taking Mary with me. As soon as we wereleft alone, I produced contraceptives, and we both stripped and lay down on therug. She probably enjoyed sex more than any girl I have ever known. She wouldoften say: “Don’t move, don’t move,” and then lie completely still, groaning:“Oh God, that’s lovely.” After five minutes like this, when she had controlledher feelings enough to avert an imminent orgasm, she would allow me to move alittle, still groaning.Even then, I was struck by the difference in our responses. Mary, like Caroline,enjoyed sex; she enjoyed the act itself in a straightforward way. The desire wasapparently attached to its object in a simple relationship. I soon noticed thatmy own excitement was more complicated. She bought herself some more adultunderwear, and took pleasure in walking around in it; I soon noticed that thisexcited me more than seeing her naked. Why? It is probably tied up with themale-conquest impulse, as well as with a conditioning that connects our sexualimpulses to underwear advertisements. One day, she bought herself a garter belt.I watched her dressing, her panties pulled just below her buttocks while shehooked it up; the sight instantly provoked me to take her again, with an urgencyso great that I would not even allow her to undress. And yet this puzzles mewhen I think back on it. I suppose seeing her like that gave me a sense ofseeing something forbidden, and this added to the desire. (I doubt whether Maryever felt this.) This immediately connects sex with all the 19th-centuryromanticism about black magic, etc. It also reminds me of the joke about the manwho cured himself of impotency by repeating “She is not my wife, she is not mywife,” before climbing into bed with his wife.Again—I digress from Mary, but the subject is worth pursuing—I notice thatGertrude, in certain ways, evokes stronger sexual emotions than Caroline, simplybecause she always allows me to feel a sense of violation. This came to mestrongly a few weeks ago; she warned me there was no point in staying the nightbecause she had the curse. I decided to stay anyway, and we got into bed;Gertrude was wearing a sort of sanitary belt under her panties. Halfway throughthe night, I woke up in a state of excitement. And because I knew that she wouldconsider it horribly indecent to attempt to make love under the circumstances, Itried to, very cautiously. Luckily, she is a heavy sleeper; I, in any case, wasin such a fever that I reached my climax long before my cautious maneuversachieved their object. Again, the forbidden has this power to raise ordinarysexual excitement to an extraordinary pitch.To return to Mary:After a few months, and two or three pregnancy scares, I no longer felt the sameexcitement. It would be untrue to say that I tired of her; I was never in lovewith her, or even very emotionally attached, and we had very little to hold ustogether except the pleasure of going to bed. That August, just before our finalquarrel, we went on a holiday together to Wales. One windy afternoon, we climbeda hill near Leominster to look at an old ruined tower, and managed to get insideit and climb the stairs. On our way down, it started to rain; we took shelter ina wood, lay down between two ground-sheets, and stayed there for half theafternoon, until we both felt exhausted. Finally, the rain stopped, and we madeour way back toward the youth hostel. The wind was terrific; it prevented usfrom walking direct down the hill; the ground-sheets, which we were wearing ascapes, acted as sails, and threw us along in the wind. I looked at the line ofhills on the other side of the Severn, and felt an almost mystical satisfactionand certainty. The life in me seemed to swell and rise to the surface—more thanit ever has in sexual excitement. I felt as if I were close to CaptainShotover’s seventh degree of concentration. I felt with certainty that man is onthe brink of a new phase in his evolution, that life is about to make anotherimportant concession, and give man one more degree of freedom from the perpetualimprisonment in half-consciousness. It seemed to me that I was very close todiscovering a secret—another small piece of knowledge about the controls of themachine. It may be only a tiny concession—how to release the hand brake, how toturn on the headlights—but it will be a step closer to god-hood. Such moments asthese seemed to justify the long misery and boredom of my teens, as if anunknown power had whispered in my ear: “Carry on, you’re doing well.”A month later, Mary and I quarreled; she went off with an engineer she met at adance while I was in London, and accepted him when he proposed to her. By thattime, I had already met Geraldine, so I didn’t pay much attention.The chief thing I remember about the Mary affair was my feeling of triumphduring those first few weeks. I suppose, after six years of wanting sex andtrying to imagine what it would be like, I suddenly had a great deal of surplusmental energy at my disposal. For years I had thought and analyzed obsessively,but never really enjoyed being a “thinker,” suspecting that it separated me fromlife. Mary’s effect on me, oddly enough, was not to make me exult in my body,but in my mind. The sex provided long holidays from introspection; I went backfresh and full of new ambition. I also felt as if I had unmasked a confidencetrickster; I felt: “Never again shall I sweat and lust after a woman.” At first,this was true. After making love to Mary, I would look at women without desire,no longer curious about what they’d be like in bed, knowing already what they’dbe like.This did not last. I thought the affair had blown away all my cobwebs, dried outall the damp spots of morbidity in me. It didn’t. The life force won’t allow usto learn much from our sexual experiences ...Besides, as I realized with Geraldine, sex is by no means my deepest impulse.There were times when I felt like raging against my body, shaking the bars of mycage. Sex can give us momentary release, but almost immediately the enormousoppression of the body descends again; we are released from one prison cell andpromptly locked in another. I gain a few hours release in music, and thendiscover that I’m hungry; I eat, and discover that I’m now drowsy and inclinedto indigestion. Always a new oppression to make up for the momentary sense ofescape.And yet this is not wholly true. When I work well and think well, I have a senseof release; the opposing army is forced to retreat, and has not time to regainits lost ground while I’m asleep; I wake up with a feeling of well-being andvital excitement.I wonder how many other disciplines there are for contacting this powerhouse? Ihave experienced it once or twice listening to music, particularly Wagner.Tristan was the great love of my teens. I remember hearing some of it oneevening on the radio—unexpectedly; I listened with total concentration, tryingto keep in my mind the whole idea and feeling of the drama, the love potion thatis stronger than either of them, the illusion of touching heaven in the garden.My brain began to feel hot, as if it were an engine being run properly for once,and suddenly, time stood still, the past and the present became identical, as iftime were a confidence trick of my body, and I had seen through the trick. I amsure that power over the body resides in the brain. If only the brain could workat a certain intensity, the intensity it may accidentally achieve in readingsome book, listening to music, the body’s power to oppress the spirit woulddisappear, and the body itself would become to the spirit like an instrument inthe hands of an expert performer. This intensity is achieved too infrequently,and I do not have its secret, except effort, non-stop, day-by-day effort toattain power over the body. Van Gogh must have achieved this kind of intensitymany times in his painting; it is visible in “The Starry Night” and “Road withCypresses.” I myself achieved it many times in the days when I wanted to be aballet dancer—the days when Nijinsky was my chief symbol of thepowerhouse—usually when dancing to music I associated with Nijinsky—the Faun,the Sacre, the Firebird.Oct. 27. This morning, in the second-hand shop in the Hampstead Road, I pickedup a copy of Gorki’s reminiscences of Tolstoy. I have never written about this,incidentally, the intense pleasure I get from pottering around second-handbookshops. It is not merely the bookworm’s delight. These places are likechurches in the middle of this stupid civilization; outside there is business,money-making, the commercial jungle where everything is devalued; inside,another world that plots the secret overthrow of the world of money. I stillremember my excitement on picking up a tattered copy of the first volume ofSchopenhauer, and walking up the Kentish Town Road reading it, and feeling as ifI’d found one of the secrets that would free me; life is all surface, hard,polished, screaming for attention. The world is like a bad-tempered andimperious housewife who wants to keep her husband under her thumb, who neverceases to nag him, make him feel in the wrong, assure him that he could gofurther and fare worse, etc. She also plants in him an immense guilt feelingabout feeling attracted to other women. Then one day, he meets another woman whois totally unlike his wife, gentle, good-tempered, intelligent, and perfectlywilling to give herself. In five minutes he feels that the whole world ischanging, feels that his wife’s fits of jealousy, self-righteousness, hysteria,are completely intolerable, and that nothing but timidity and force of habithave made him endure them for so long. This is the taste of freedom ... I lookfor it in bookshops.I find on the title page of the Gorki this comment by Tolstoy: “The flesh ragesand riots, and the spirit follows it, helpless and miserable.” This was thefirst thing I saw when I opened the book, the subject that has been foremost inmy mind for days. Are these things chance? They incline me to believe that theworld has its own secret motives and intentions.On the first page of the book, I find this remark: “He is like a god, not aSabaoth or Olympian, but the kind of Russian god who ‘sits on a maple throneunder a golden lime tree,’ not very majestic, but perhaps more cunning than allthe other gods.”I sympathize. We all want to create gods, to believe in godlike men. This bookshows Gorki’s struggle to romanticize Tolstoy, to see him as a god, and hiscontinual disappointment that he was only a human being—until, after Tolstoy’sdeath, Gorki can at last drop his image into the saturated fluid of his ownmind, and bring it out encrusted with crystals.Yes, I know this desire to believe that men can be like gods, that Shelley’s oldJew, “wiser than God,” really lives somewhere in his sea cavern “mid theDemonesi.” I experience it now as I turn my head and look at Nietzsche’s workson the shelf. When I bought them—found the set in a junk shop that didn’trealize their value—I brought them back greedily, stood them on the shelf andthen stared at them as if I’d found the key to my salvation, a man who usedlanguage like a scalpel to cut the truth out of his own heart. And then Ithought: But Nietzsche died insane. This man whose thought is so powerful andclear, whose step is so purposeful, seems to know exactly where he is walking;it is impossible not to believe that he can lead the human race out of its moralwilderness. But he died insane.Oct. 28. Dennis Paulham came last night, bringing with him a bottle of somepeculiar cocktail that someone had given him; I was feeling tired, so todiscourage conversation I gave him the sex diary to read. He read avidly withoutsaying a word for an hour. Dennis is a curious little man; he must be nearerfifty than forty, and yet looks like a willful schoolboy, with his round faceand snub nose. And yet at his age, his sex experience has been negligible. Hewas particularly excited by my account of the woman who excited me by pressingagainst me in a crowd, and told me that he had once had a similar experience,but that it had led to some unpleasantness.He then told me a number of things that struck me as so interesting that I setthem down here. His most amusing story was about a prostitute in Notting Hill.Dennis saw an advertisement on a board near the station, the usual “Attractivegirl wishes to do modeling work.” He phoned her up, and went over to see her. Hesaid she was horribly unattractive, with a face like a horse and a figure thatsuited it. He felt embarrassed, and took her out for a meal. Afterwards, theyreturned to her room; he wanted an excuse to go home, but couldn’t think of one.As soon as they got in, she stripped off her clothes and climbed into bed, andhe reluctantly did the same. But it was useless; he simply felt no desire. Aftershe had tried to excite him, without success, for ten minutes, she said that shehad just the thing for him. She went to a cupboard, and took out a machine! Hesaid it had a large wheel and various electric wires that ran to two smallleather straps. The girl buckled the straps around his limp member, and turnedthe handle. Immediately, small bolts of electricity shot through him, andachieved the desired effect almost immediately. She hastily unbuckled thestraps, and leaped into bed, but by this time, his interest had vanished and hehad subsided again. Once more she buckled the straps and turned the handle; oncemore Dennis demonstrated his manhood; but as soon as she unbuckled the straps,the excitement vanished. After a few more attempts, she gave up. He left hersome money and promised to return the following day, but never did.I asked him if he had had any more experience with “machines,” and he launchedinto a rambling story about a homosexual he knew, who had taken him to a kind ofTurkish bath somewhere in East London, where he was astonished to discover thata large proportion of the clientele were big, athletic-looking men who mighthave been army drill instructors. Apparently the most extraordinary things wenton under cover of a blanket of steam. When Dennis revealed that he was notparticularly inclined for these exercises, the proprietor offered to let him trya “machine.” Dennis was a little vague about the nature of these machines,except that they were ostensibly “massage machines.” He looked at one of these,and complained that it was filthy, showing very obvious signs of the use towhich it had been put. At this, the proprietor looked surprised, and explainedthat his clients insisted on their being filthy, that they would simply refuseto make use of a “clean” machine. Dennis grabbed his clothes and excused himself...Again, this problem of the association of sex and “dirt.” And yet I am not surethat it is a “necessary” association. I read a case recently of a young burglarwho slashed the armchairs with a razor and pissed on the carpets. The burglaryexpressed a power complex; it was obviously a kind of “rape” of a rich person’sflat, and the rape would not be complete without this kind of indignity. Thesense of freedom in a strange person’s flat had to express itself in some formof destruction. In the same way, we may associate sex and “dirt” as two thingsthat are forbidden.And yet it is the powers inside ourselves which are “forbidden,” which we knownothing about, and yet which we have a right to know about. There is no reasonwhy sex should be associated with destruction. I think of Harry Thomas whoworked with me once at Golders Green. (I met him again a few nights ago inTottenham Court Road.) He had every reason to be fairly happy; he was agood-looking man in his thirties, with a pretty wife and two intelligentchildren, a comfortable little house in Hampstead, and a good job. And yet henever seemed happy to me; his eyes always looked strained, as if he weresuppressing nervous tension. He used to come and talk to me when I was sprayingtoys in the shed outside the factory, and tell me how he longed to escape. (Weonce planned a whole trip across Europe and North Africa on his motor bike, butit never came off.)But what interested me most were his symbols of freedom. He talked to me aboutfighting in the Western desert against Rommel. He had a special friend namedGinger. One day, in a bornbardment, Ginger looked over a heap of sandbags when ashell exploded; his head rolled to Harry’s feet. Harry said he went insane; hejumped on top of the sandbags, in full view of the enemy snipers, and beganscreaming at them and firing his rifle. He said he didn’t care if they shot him;he hated them so much that he wanted to kill every German with his bare hands.Harry also told me about the bornbardments, and the tremendous noise the gunsmade when they opened up. He said that all the guns along the line would beginto fire together, at a given signal, and go on without pause for an hour ormore. The explosions were so continuous that they lit up the sky as if it weredaytime, and the noise was simply a nonstop thunder that left everyone deaf fordays. But Harry told me about this with a kind of exaltation. He said: “It waslike Hell let loose,” but he said it with so much feeling that the clicheexpressed some of his amazement, almost an admiration, for the racket.But the story of Harry’s that impressed me most was about a girl he met when hewas training in some town in the North of England. Harry is always a littleapologetic about his lack of education, and he’s a non-stop reader. He is also afine sportsman. One evening, he and a few friends were playing cricket in apark, when some men stopped to watch the game. Afterwards, an old colonel cameover to him and asked him if he’d like to play cricket in his team. Harry wasdelighted—it got him off a great many duties. He met the colonel’s daughter, andwas immediately dazzled by her; she’d just returned from a Swiss finishingschool, and was apparently rather beautiful. Harry knew that he might be movedabroad at any moment; this gave the love affair a wartime urgency, and within afew days they were lovers. They had to keep it secret from the colonel, and usedto meet late at night, after the cricket practice. Harry told me how one night,they went into a park, and had sex at the side of a lake. It was a warm, starlitnight. After they’d finished their lovemaking, neither of them bothered to puttheir clothes on immediately. The girl apparently liked to take off most of herclothes. Harry told me that he lay there at her side, while she sat up, and helooked at the shape of her breasts outlined against the sky. He said that shesuddenly began to recite poetry in French—at least, he thinks it was French—apoem he thought was about the stars.Harry told me that story on at least three occasions. Obviously, it representssomething to him—a dream that will always make him dissatisfied. They never sawone another again after he left the town, and he heard later that she hadmarried an officer. (Harry was a sergeant.) He told me that he would neverforget the outline of her breasts against the sky, and the sound of her voicespouting Baudelaire or somebody of the sort. It symbolized a kind of fairy-talefulfillment. When he told me these stories, I could understand why he wasdissatisfied in his job, with his excellent wife and pleasant home. As to me,I’m sure he’d have been even more unhappy if he’d married the girl. And yet thethought remains his symbol of freedom.How much unfulfillment there is in all modern society! I am not now speakingabout the unfulfillment of the poets and potential artists who dream of a worldof Wagnerian ecstasy, but about men like Harry, about the working-class boys whogo to sea hoping for an “adventurous life,” about the shopgirls who getstarry-eyed about a nonsensical musical film in which the dashing hero is playedby a film star who is known to be a homosexual and a drug addict.I have two photographs that fascinate me. One is in a book on German films. Itshows Hans Albers, who was apparently Germany’s most popular film star in thethirties, dressed for dinner, and walking down a broad staircase with severalbeautiful girls on either side of him. I am told that Albers always played thepart of the bellhop who marries the princess, the poor boy who marries theboss’s daughter, etc. This photograph symbolizes all the longing of shopgirlsand factory boys for the life of grace and money.The other photograph is of Douglas Fairbanks playing in The Iron Mask. I supposehe is D’Artagnan; he is dressed in leather boots and an open-necked shirt. Hestands on picturesque looking flagstones that immediately evoke the Paris of TheVagabond King. One hand rests on his hip, the other holds the hilt of a swordwhose point touches the flagstones. He has a tiny pointed beard as well as amoustache, his head is thrown back, and he smiles with total confidence.Everything about his pose suggests immense vitality; I have never seen him in afilm, but I can imagine him leaping out of windows, stopping runaway carriages,clambering over battlements and fencing with ten men at the same time. Hesymbolizes the other daydream—the life of action. Albers is grace and the glamorof riches; Fairbanks is unchallengable, undefeatable vitality, a man who cannever be hurt or discouraged, who looks at all life with the same confident,handsome smile. “Pooh, it’s easy when you plunge into things with one tremendousleap ... ”The two dreams, and a society sick with longing for both of them, like Harry andhis naked girl reciting Baudelaire ...Later. While I’m on the subject of Harry, a few more points about him thatinterest me. Sexually, he is exceptionally successful, and always has been. Hetold me once about his first sexual experience. He used to go to the cinema agreat deal. One day, an attractive woman sat next to him—he was about ten at thetime—and allowed her hands to roam. Harry had no thought of stopping her; infact, when he got over his first astonishment, he helped her by unbuttoninghimself. In the interval, she took him to a café upstairs and bought him icecream and lemonade, then sat next to him again and continued to fondle him. Iasked Harry how he felt about this—alarmed or perhaps a little shocked. He said:“Oh no, I enjoyed it.” He made no attempt to return the caresses, and after thefilm, never saw the woman again. His theory was that her husband was impotent orunsatisfying; I would suppose it was some kind of neurosis uncommon in women.(There are hundreds of men who would like to do the same to little girls, butfew women who feel any interest in young boys.)Only one more of Harry’s stories stays in my head. He told me how, as a child,he climbed over a railway embankment, and saw two small girls engaged in sexualplay, poking twigs into each other!All this helps to explain his nostalgia about the Baudelaire girl. His earliestexperiences of sex were of a fairly degrading kind—a mere physical titillation.From some of his confidences about his extramarital relations, I gather thatthey continue to be rather unidealistic—brutal adulteries in parks and so on. Heis so obviously handsome, in the Douglas Fairbanks manner, that women often takethe lead in seduction, and offer themselves frankly. The one thing, therefore,that his sex life has always lacked has been the element of glamor, the “greatlove.” And no matter how unromantic a man might think himself, there is always acorner of him that envies the Tristans and Lancelots; he secretly longs for sexto cease to be a pleasant but animalistic activity; he wants it to become partof the driving force for his greatest ambitions, his need to live more fully andintensely.Why is it that these romantic ideas never cease to exercise their influence onus? I can never read the passage in Dante about how Paolo kissed Francesca’smouth, “all trembling,” without feeling that shiver of longing. The music towhich Zandonai sets this scene in his opera seems to me some of the greatest inthe world. And why do we feel such a response when Tristan and Isolde drink thelove potion, then stare at one another in silence, until the orchestra takes upthe opening phrase of the Prelude in a whisper? When finally she sings“Tristan,” and he sings “Isolde,” I feel a ripple through my hair and a shiverdown to my fingertips. It is because of the idea that love is a force greaterthan either of them, and that from now on, nothing else can ever matter toeither of them but that total absorption in one another. We live boring anddissatisfied lives, never feeling much contact with another person. My “sexlife” is adequate, but my “love life” is an ironic absurdity. I suspect Gertrudeof being possessive in a kind of suppressed-neurotic way; Caroline, I know,might go to bed with a handsome drama student any day—and I wouldn’t even feeljealousy. I would like to believe that the Tristan-Isolde love can exist, andcan transform my being.Oct. 29. Sitting in this room, drinking endless cups of tea, there are timeswhen I wonder whether I have not somehow chosen a completely false direction.Should I not rather be in another city, struggling for existence? I disgustmyself. A few years ago I thought that I would like to spend every day in thereading room at the British Museum, like Butler and Shaw and Wells. Now, I sithere within half an hour of the place, and cannot overcome my laziness.I go back over my calculation to see where I’ve gone wrong. It goes like this:Animals are feeble creatures; they are thrown down into the world, guided by afew instincts. They have no freedom; they do nothing that the body does notorder them to do. Man is also an animal, he also finds himself in anenvironment, with various pressures to determine the direction of his life. Buthe has discovered a number of methods of increasing his minute powers. Hismemory is almost nonexistent, a mere candle flame. He learned to use language topreserve his knowledge. A transformer is a device that can turn a low voltageinto a high voltage. Language is man’s memory transformer; his memory has thepower of a mere flashlight battery, but language multiplied it until it becomesa power station, capable of holding the knowledge of hundreds of years. Butlanguage was not his only “transformer.” He also developed imagination. Thismeant that man was no longer confined by his environment. He can be born intopoverty and dirt, but through imagination, these cease to be absolutes; he cannourish his mind on beauty and idealism. Surely imagination is the greatestpower ever discovered by man, greater than oil, electricity, atomic energy. Withimagination he leaves the realm of the animal and enters the realm of the god.This is astounding; to an animal, it would seem a kind of black magic. Yes,undoubtedly, imagination is freedom, a new dimension for human beings.Imagination is the power of the absurd; it is nothing less than an antigravitydevice that can cause man to rise into the air like an Indian fakir. Everythingmay be against him; he may, like Blake, be a total failure in every worldlysense, without money, without reputation, his paintings dismissed as untalented,his poems described as the work of a madman; and yet, with every “natural”disadvantage to push him backward, he defies the laws of physics and movesforward.Man, then, is a flea who has invented devices that enable him to lift mountains.Yet then I open Shaw’s Caesar and Cleopatra, and find Caesar refusing to savethe library of Alexandria because “It is better for the Egyptians to live theirlives instead of dreaming them away over books.” If it were as simple as that!Life versus dreams. But it isn’t. Man is awkwardly poised between god andanimal. I sit here, surrounded by the devices that taught me freedom in mychildhood—books, gramophone records, writing materials, and I place my trust inthem to achieve still more freedom. But it’s an uphill struggle; my body wouldrather go and get drunk, take a run over the fields in a high wind, rape thefirst pretty girl I meet in Camden Town; it doesn’t like all this study and herbreasts, and very obviously enjoyed it.Then she addedOct. 30. I took my own advice yesterday, and went over to meet Caroline afterschool. She wanted to look at the site of the Christie2 murders, so I took heralong to Ruston Close. A nasty area. We went into a café and drank tea; it was agrimy little place with oilcloth on the tables. While we sat there, two womencame in who might have been Christie’s victims. Perhaps it is the associationsof the Christie case, but this district always seems to me to reek of sex. Iwatched this poor, sluttish looking woman of forty come in and buy tea and tenWoodbines; fat behind; her slip hanging crookedly below her lopsided skirt. Shesits opposite, looks out of the window at the kids playing rounders in themiddle of the road, then looks curiously at Caroline. Caroline looking veryblond and pink and pretty and well-dressed in a red skirt with large goldbuttons, and asking me with morbid curiosity if I can understand how a man couldviolate dead bodies. When I reply Yes, I think I can, she shivers. I imagineChristie staring out of this window, and dreaming an Eastern despot’s luriddaydream: being given the freedom of all women. Beckoning to thatthirteen-year-old girl playing rounders: take off your skirt. Then to that girlin the green coat who is swinging a handbag that is too big and too glossy:raise up your dress to your waist and let me see if you attract me. This is my“transformer,” magnifying sex until it fills the world. Because sex isn’t reallyall that important ...Caroline wanted to go and see Cyrano de Bergerac with Jose Ferrer. I enjoyed thefirst half, then got sick of his feeble defeatism. I think I prefer Christie,who wants to seize girls like an animal, to this fool who thinks Roxane agoddess.Afterward, we went and drank cider in a pub behind the BBC, and somebody put onsome gramophone records—Trenet singing “La Mer”—and I suddenly felt superblysentimental and happy and looked at Caroline and thought that it’s a pity thisisn’t a real love affair, just an affair. These moments give a love affair akind of immortality.In the night, I kept thinking about Madeleine in the next room; I knew she hadthe day off today. The other day, she came into the kitchen and caught me makingtea in my underpants. She pretended to be very shocked—in fact, made such a fussabout it that I could tell her indignation was drawing strength from some otheremotion. So this morning, when Caroline had gone to school, I made more tea,went into Madeleine’s bedroom with two cups, and climbed into bed with her. Sheordered me to get out, but without much conviction, so I simply sat there anddrank my tea. We talked in a funny, embarrassed, casual way. I was sorry to seeshe was wearing a nightgown with a high neck. I didn’t expect much from her, butwas curious to see how far she’d let me go. The conversation was deliberatelycasual, even a little prim. Then we lay down, I put my arm around her, and wetalked some more. Then she let me kiss her and caress her breasts through thenightgown. I cursed the bloody thing; it came all the way down to her feet,making it difficult to raise without bending down—which would be the idealopportunity for her to stop me. Seduction should be able to proceed by tinystages, like sliding down a slope; any sudden steps are likely to stop it forgood. However, after kissing her for twenty minutes and getting indecentlyexcited, I knew I either had to go on or get out of bed; besides, I’d managed toraise her nightgown by pretending to caress her behind. So I grabbed the bottom,pulled it up above her waist, and went to work kissing her and pressing myselfagainst her. She didn’t put up any defenses, just opened her legs. I expected itto be impossible, but tried anyway. To my amazement, I managed to get in withoutmuch trouble, but it obviously hurt her like mad. She insisted on lyingperfectly still; I deliberately cooled my excitement by thinking about somethingelse. After about half an hour, I could move without hurting her too much;finally, I had to withdraw quickly. We then got up and made tea. She seemedrather resentful about the whole thing, saying contemptuously: “Is that all sexis?” I assured her that no one ever enjoyed it the first time. She said: “Ifthat’s all it is, I don’t think I’ll bother to try it again.” After breakfast,she gave me a little lecture about how important it is that Caroline never findout. (I don’t think Caroline would give a damn. I think she’ll enjoy looking atCaroline and feeling that she’s one up.)Now I try again to remember how the conjurer performed the trick. Because it wasa trick. I didn’t really want Madeleine. It was just the usual male desire toenter one more moated castle. When I use the bathroom, and see Madeleine’sunderwear drying in the bath, I don’t like to think that it represents a worldthat is forbidden to me; now I can think instead: That belongs to another of mymistresses. But what does this mean? I feel like saying to the Life Force: whydon’t you trust me, why don’t you take me into your confidence instead ofcheating me into doing what you want? I’d be only too happy to know why I’mserving, how the purpose can be achieved.My mind manufactures considerable power. It struggles, it doesn’t allow itselfto be imposed on, it analyzes. But not enough power for certainty, for knowledgeof purpose.Yet despite this sense of stagnation, things are not so bad. Today I readBorchert’s play The Man Outside. Powerful, beautifully written—but its defeatismbores me. In Louis Vertrand, I find this comment: “Even so is my soul a desert,where on the brink of the abyss, one hand stretched towards life, the othertowards death, I utter a despairing sob.” This strikes me as balls. At leastwe’re no longer as feeble as that.I don’t stand between life and death and sob despairingly. I have no doubtwhatever which I prefer. I may not quite know what I want out of life; I mayfornicate and then feel cheated. But at least I have no doubt at all that deathis an evil stupidity. Most people live on the surface of life; they can bebrushed off like flies. My roots are a little deeper, and every day I try topush them deeper still. That’s why we die: we don’t want to live enough. Iremember that Polish student in Birmingham who could make himself burst out intothe most awful pimples and boils when he got upset. We don’t yet understand thestrange power of the mind. But one day, someone will discover how to use thatpower to live twice as long as at present, and how to avoid the presentdreariness and lack of direction.An interesting speculation occurs to me. Austin once told me that Sweden is acountry of fornication, where one of the catch-phrases is: “Let’s go to bed andsee if we like one another.” And yet Sweden also has the world’s highest suiciderate. This is my theory: when a man and woman get into bed together, theyimagine they are going to titillate one another; there is no one else, just thetwo of them. But this isn’t true. There is a third. In the very act of sex, theyare performing an incantation that arouses the sex god, whose business is todrive the world in the direction of evolution. If the two are performing the sexact in a spirit of boredom, he loses his temper and punishes them.Yes, I remember it now, the sensation I experienced after that first night withCaroline. I remember lying beside her, staring at the light on the oppositewall, and feeling an immense exultation, as if I were a magician who had iustsucceeded in raising elemental spirits. It was a feeling that there are otherforces in the world besides the ones of which we are aware, forces that hidebelow the surface, but are fully cognizant of everything that goes on. Theseforces inject meaning into the world. The world is meaningless without them,like the scenery stored in an empty theater.I find this difficult to explain, but I am sure that meaning is like aconjurer’s cloth, an invisible cloth that the invisible conjurer drops betweenus and “reality.” I look out of my window at the Kentish Town Road. It fails toarouse any response in me; it is “meaningless.” Suddenly a very old man walksbelow my window; he has a white beard, a filthy overcoat that brushes thepavement, and his dirty gray hair hangs halfway down his back. Instantly myattention is “caught”—and I imagine that this is because meaning has obtrudeditself into my universe, reached out and hit me. But this is an illusion; it issomething in me that imposed meaning on the old man. Perhaps he reminded me ofTolstoy, or aroused some idea of the “romance” of being Outside Society,refusing to fit in. Or I put a Beethoven piano sonata on the gramophone; itfails to interest me. I make an effort, and think about Beethoven’s life—thearch-rebel shaking his fist at the thunder, etc., and the music immediatelybecomes meaningful. But it is I who have imposed the meaning on it.But where sex is concerned, the problem is more mysterious. The violence of myresponses convinces me that this is no autohypnosis. For example: two years agoI went to visit a friend in the hospital. When I came out, I took a walk aroundthe hospital grounds, then took a short cut between two buildings. I saw aporter standing against a corner, obviously trying to conceal himself, andlooking out across the road; when he saw me, he turned round, and looked guilty.When I drew level, he winked at me, and said: “Look at that.” Twenty yards away,a girl was sitting on a doorstep—I imagine she was a student nurse, from hercloak—with her legs wide open. The porter, a slobbery looking man with thickglasses and a dripping nose, said: “She’s been on show like that for tenminutes.” “I don’t suppose she knows we’re watching,” I said. “Oh yes she does.Watch this.” He walked from behind the building, and went along the road, infront of the girl, taking a long look between her legs as he went past. Shepretended not to see him, and went on staring abstractedly ahead of her. I mustadmit that, left alone, I felt considerably excited. Somehow the presence of theporter had acted as a brake before—as if it would be a kind of self-exposure tobe excited in front of him. I found it incomprehensible that the girl should besitting like that, her panties on view to the world. If she’d been ugly andsex-starved, I could have understood; but she looked about seventeen, and, asfar as I could tell, was pretty. After a few minutes, the porter returned backdown the road, this time keeping his eyes focused between her open thighs; hestopped near her and said something; I saw her nod, and he walked on, and cameround the corner of the building.“I asked her if she was feeling OK,” he said, “and she said she was.” He hadtried the only explanation that seemed fairly likely: that the girl felt ill,and was not aware that we were watching her. The porter said: “Walk by like Idid. She won’t move. When you get close up you can see the hairs on her fanny.”I wanted to, but would have felt ashamed; it was too obvious. I also wanted totalk to her. After all, she might be advertising a desire to lose her virginity.But again, I felt unsure of myself. Finally, realizing that I was only torturingmyself—because from twenty yards, I could only see a blur of pink where thewhite of her thighs ended, and it was absurd to keep staring, as if longerexposure would reveal more—I turned and went home. This episode has stayed in mymind ever since, and recurs frequently—particularly when I feel sex-starved,when I daydream of what I might have done if I could have got her into abedroom. Yet when I turn my full attention on it, the meaning vanishes. Why wasshe exciting? Because she aroused in me a whole response of secret lusts, farmore violently than Caroline will arouse them tonight when she undresses infront of me. It is not that a girl’s body is exciting in itself; the conjurerthrew veils of excitement between my eyes and the girl. (On considering thisepisode, I am now convinced she did it as a “dare”—that the other nurses betthat no girl would dare to sit on the doorstep with her thighs open, and thatthis girl probably replied: “Nonsense, what does it matter if men do look upyour skirt? It doesn’t do you any harm.” ... ) All the secret repressions ofcivilization rose up, all the girls who walk past in summer dresses.It may seem that in writing like this I am only indulging in a kind ofintellectual onanism; but this would be to miss the point. There is a point. Ikeep trying to break into reality with this crowbar of reason. I don’t try a“systematic” attack, like a philosopher or a theologian; I don’t want to“explain” the world, like Thomas Aquinas. I want to keep jabbing, in the hopethat the point of my crowbar will find a crack in the stones and be able tolever them apart. In a way, this diary is the ideal way to try and do it. Mymethod of attack is the same as that of Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Wells:fragmentary, yet this is necessary. I make short, violent attacks on thefaceless reality in an attempt to take it by storm, driven wholly by anintuition, not by reason. And sex is the ideal driving force for my pneumaticdrill; my mind may get tired and bewildered brooding on the problem of how weought to live; I think of sex, and feel a shock, as if I’ve touched a live wire.Something is revealed. And what I want to try and get at is this inconsistencyin the sexual impulse. I feel as if I’m an accountant who has caught Life tryingto fiddle with the books. Because when I climb into bed with Caroline orGertrude, I may or may not feel excitement; but it is not that magic that thestrangeness of a woman evokes. The women who stay in my mind are the ones Inever had. I remember a girl on the beach at Felpham; I lay behind a breakwater,watching her dress, watching the way she wrapped herself carefully in a bathtowel before she shed her bathing costume; every single move was calculated tooutwit the staring males. But a point came when she had to concede a certainamount, because it was almost impossible to pull on her panties without exposingsomething. I can still remember, with awful sick excitement, the sight of herstanding there quite boldly, her dress raised for a moment above her waist, herlegs very straight and braced apart to balance herself. And the longing is notmerely sexual; it is also social. I don’t merely want to rape her. She lookshealthy and beautiful; I want to meet her, talk to her, take her out. But shewalks off the beach with her parents, and a man of about her own age who mightbe her brother or her lover or even her husband (but I think not; she seemedsomehow unmarried) and I curse Fate, that has dangled this goddess in front ofme but offered me no opportunity of making her acquaintance. Of course, shemight not be a goddess ... but even that would be a triumph. I remember once,when I was about thirteen, I sat on the bus behind a girl who had marveloushair. I tried hard to see her face; she half-turned once or twice, and I sawthat she was pretty. In the twenty minutes of that bus journey, I fell horriblyin love, and was assailed by daydreams as endless as the Arabian Nights. My stopcame; but I decided to stay on, and watch her for just a few minutes longer.Then someone she knew got on the bus, and shouted: “Allao, Sheila luv, ’ow areyou?,” , and the girl in front of me replied in exactly the same voice, thenoisy, high-pitched yawp of the Midlands, as devoid of tone as cats making love.I hurried off the bus, my adoration in fragments—and yet perversely glad to befree again, glad not to be a slave of daydreams.And yet it would be untrue to pretend that a girl of this kind could not be asdesirable as any debutante with a carefully modulated voice. Shaw is right whenhe says of Anne Whitefield: Give her a cast in one eye and strike all theaitches out of her speech, and she will still make men dream. I know this to betrue. I remember once observing one of these “suburban Cleopatras” inBirmingham. I was waiting on a street corner; she was talking to a boy inoveralls on a bicycle; she was not particularly pretty, although she had a goodfigure; she kept twisting and turning as she talked to him, as if with a kind ofimpatience; possibly she was aware that I was watching her with admiration. Hermanner was definitely coquettish. But there was something indefinably vitalabout her as she stood there, shifting from one foot to the other, patting herhair, lacing her fingers together. I could hear her voice; it was what you’dexpect of a Birmingham working-class girl. I think she probably had a turned-upnose; she might have had a cast in one eye, and it would have made nodifference. She was like an incandescent lamp, and I think most men would havetaken her on any terms. I envied that stupid looking mechanic with his facesmeared with grease.So this is sex—an appeal to something inside us of which we know nothing. It islike a spy signaling from the coast during the war; there are flashes from outthere, at sea, and answering flashes from inside your own country—and yet youdon’t know where the spy is.Another point that struck me the other day, thinking of Christie. Why domurderers kill certain women, yet not others? Heath murdered two girls withsadistic cruelty, yet another girl with whom he spent the weekend between thetwo murders didn’t even suspect that he had sadistic leanings. What was it abouther that made him gentle to her? Landru murdered a whole string of women,including one who had no money; yet he was also living with a girl with whom hehad been having an affair for a year, and who had no suspicion that he was akiller. Kürten killed some of his female victims, yet other women who wereill-treated by him continued to go out with him without even suspecting that hemight be a killer. What was it about his victims that incited him to kill them?What was it about his wife that made it impossible to treat her badly? Surelythe answer must be: the same curious vitality that made my “suburban Cleopatra”so desirable.So there is the problem, the discrepancy in the books kept by the Life Force.Yet no, I can’t believe that the vital excitement is an illusion. It is aglimpse into the possibility of an intenser form of existence, a life wherethere is no unsatisfied desire.There is, of course, the opposite of this intensely-focused desire. For example,a communist tart I met once, and the way that all my sexual desire drained awaywhen I was in bed with her, as if she’d pulled out a plug. Why? Partly, ofcourse, because I felt her to be worthless, a neurotic bitch with whom it wouldbe dangerous to get involved; perhaps my instincts were reacting moreperceptively than my conscious mind. Also because she lacked mystery. I rememberBill Payne telling me about the time when he was sleeping in the same flat as agirl who attracted him violently. He waited until everyone was in bed, thencrept into her bedroom, where she was still reading with the light on. When hecame in, she looked up and smiled, then threw back all the bedclothes. She wasnaked. He said his desire simply evaporated at the sight of that nakedness; itwas too open, too honest. He turned and fled back to his own room; he told methat that was exactly what she had intended him to do. (I would have supposedher movement to be an invitation, but Bill denied this strongly.)So all that we know as greatness is connected with the opening up of horizons.Why do we all love a story about a frustrated man or woman who succeeds inrealizing some dream? It is because we are all frustrated, trapped in thisprison of a body. This is why I cannot believe that the lust I felt for thestudent nurse, for the girl on the beach, was somehow an illusion, a responseintensified by frustration. Certain ideas, certain works of art, evoke for methe absurd, ecstatic, metaphysical mystery of life. Van Gogh’s “Starry Night”does it; so does Beethoven’s last quartet, so does that picture of the three oldsages around the Well of Life in Korea. These things are not illusions; they areglimpses into a possibility that might become a reality at any moment. Surelythe same is true of sex? It presages a freer, cleaner existence, without endlessobstructions and perplexities. And I’ve felt this often through sex. Forexample, that first night I slept with Caroline. After she’d fallen asleep, itsuddenly seemed to me that I’d been making a much better job of life than Irealized. It was like a stock-taking when you realize that you’re a great dealbetter off than you thought yourself.If I had to define the belief that drives me to torment myself, to bully mybody, to drive myself instead of drifting and “taking life as it comes,” I wouldexpress it in this way: At any moment it is possible that we shall make the“breakthrough” in consciousness, that consciousness will suddenly leap to ahigher level and turn us into something more like gods. With this intenserconsciousness would come far more energy—or rather, I would know the secret ofthe source of my energy. Why do I feel as if life has somehow not yet begun, asif I am still a child, as if when I die, it will be as if I have never lived?Why did Yeats call life a long preparation for something that never happens?This I believe: we are still in the chrysalis stage; we live in a kind of daze,an oppression. And yet this I believe: we could go on developing, growing, sothat our present “adulthood” at the age of twenty-one would seem no more thanthe first milestone on a hundred-mile journey. If we could discover the secretof the next stage, of getting past that first milestone, at which the human racehas now been stuck for thousands of years, we would also have discovered thesecret of living beyond our present seventy years.Yes, we are attacking reality with our weapons of logic and language. The worldinduces a “conditioned reflex” of blankness in us, like a snake staring at arabbit—a weird paralysis; we merely accept it, without asking for itscredentials. We do not ask why we are born and die; we do not ask why we suffer,or why “destiny” carelessly throws us hours of silly bliss. We ought to ask, torefuse to accept anything without knowing the reason. I refuse to be hypnotizedor to sink into a state of blank nausea. I place myself in circumstances where Ican be most easily attacked, where I am most exposed—alone in this room, makingno attempt to distract myself, only trying to look without blinking at theproblem: What am I doing here? The world is a clever swindler; it robs us of ourlives while it distracts our attention. It is like a dishonest jailer who ispaid an allowance for the upkeep of the prisoners, but who pockets theallowance; then, when the governor pays a visit and asks “Any complaints?,”somehow hypnotizes or bullies them into saying “No.” And what is this“allowance” of which we are being robbed? I believe that, if we had the key, wecould get past that first “adulthood,” become real living beings instead of thestupid, deluded, petty creatures we are. We have a right to become more godlikethan we are; we have a right to more knowledge than we possess; we have a rightto know what it is all about. Once human beings catch a glimpse of that newlevel of maturity, they will refuse to be robbed by the jailer any longer; theywill fix their eyes on it and demand it.Sometimes, when listening to music, I catch a glimpse of it. For example, if Ilisten to certain things with deep concentration—the Liebestod, the final danceof the Firebird—time is destroyed, and I am suddenly back ten years, when Ifirst heard them. That kind of conquest of time is a movement towards thegodhead I speak of.Later. Caroline came and interrupted me. She talked about marriage again, in arather vague way; and I, to distract her, talked about her future success in thetheater. That’s Caroline’s trouble: like most of us, she can’t believe in herfuture; or even in her past. Only in the present.She is curious about this diary. I went out of the room to put the kettle on;when I came back, she was looking at it, and to my horror, was looking at thepage about Madeleine. I took it away; I don’t think she had time to read it.Certainly, she didn’t show any of the signs of having read it.Oct. 31. A stupid thing happened last night, and makes me wonder if I shall everget any sense. Caroline left at about eleven; she had early classes thismorning; I settled down to fill in my diary, and decided to drink some wine. Itook a bottle of Spanish burgundy out of the cupboard, and opened it standingover the bed. To my astonishment, as the cork came out with a pop, the bottomhalf of the bottle simply dropped away, soaking the bed with wine. I don’t knowwhether the glass had a fault, or whether I’d somehow cracked the bottle, andwrenched it in half. Anyway, I was more worried about the state of the sheetsand the mattress than about the wetness of the bed, so I rushed down to Carlottaand told her what I’d done. She came upstairs and whipped off the sheets and theblanket next to the mattress; the mattress wasn’t too badly soaked, and I don’tsee why the landlady should ever see it. Carlotta said that the stains wouldcome out of the sheets if she washed them right away, and I kept apologizinglike a fool. I ended by going down and offering to help. Then I got the idea ofopening the other bottle of wine. I stood around in her kitchen for ten minutes,getting in the way, then said I’d leave her the wine and go back upstairs; sheimmediately asked me where I was going to sleep. I said that the wine staindidn’t make much difference; I’d cover it over with newspapers. She then saidshe hadn’t any clean sheets, so I said I’d sleep between blankets. At this, sheoffered to let me sleep downstairs. I agreed; I suppose I half wanted to sleepwith her anyway. Then she stopped washing, and we drank the wine, and she foundsome German station on her radio playing old records of Willy Frisch and MarleneDietrich and Maurice Chevalier, and she began to sentimentalize about Munich.Finally, when we’d finished the wine, and she had asked me all kinds of personalquestions about Caroline and Gertrude (which I answered truthfully), she said itwas time she went to bed, and asked me if I’d be comfortable on the settee. Isaid yes and went upstairs to get my blankets, and switch off my fire and light.When I came down, she was in bed, and told me that if I’d promise to be “a goodboy” I could sleep with her. I suppose this was what I’d been wanting—and notwanting. Temptation is very difficult to resist when it actually waves itselfunder your nose.Of course, I didn’t sleep a wink. She got into bed in a bra, petticoat andpanties. I asked her if she always slept like that; she said no, she alwaysslept naked, but didn’t want to lead me into temptation. Then followed the usualconversation about sex; she admitted she wasn’t a virgin, but said it had onlyhappened once, and that she didn’t want it to happen again. I asked her why shetrusted me; she said she knew I had self-control from what happened the otherday!Finally we turned back to back and I tried to sleep. Naturally, I couldn’t. Iwanted to say: Stop play-acting and take off those pants, since I presume that’swhy you invited me into your bed. Then I dozed for a bit, and when I woke up,she was taking off her bra. I naturally took this as an invitation, and tried tokiss her, but she pushed me away, and said she was hot. So finally, ratherirritably (I can’t stand teasers) I went to sleep. I woke up at about six thismorning, and took advantage of her sleep to start kissing her. She let me dothat much, but very firmly grabbed my wrist when I tried to go further. My handswere allowed anywhere above the waist, but below it was strictly taboo. She evenallowed me to kiss her breasts, and very obviously enjoyed it.Then she added insult to injury by giving me a lecture about trying to make loveto her when I was supposed to be in love with Caroline. I knew she wanted me toprotest that I wasn’t, but I was so irritated that I didn’t. Finally my sexualtension exploded harmlessly, and I was immediately pleased that she was still avirgin as far as I was concerned (sex is a selfish business anyway). At seveno’clock she told me I’d better get up to my own room because the landlady mightchoose this morning to call in. She has a damnable German coolness and atendency to lecture, so that I was in a rage with myself for being fool enoughto sleep with her. I hate these girls who pretend to offer their bodies, andthen reveal that what they really want is to stuff their personalities down yourthroat, make you acknowledge them as minds. It makes me thing of that splendidpoem of Heine to an ex-mistress who wanted to carry on the relationship on a“spiritual plane,” which ends:> Your body’s love I still desire> > For it is young and fair.> > Your soul can go and hang itself,> > I’ve soul enough to spare.So in a bad temper I came up here and made myself tea, and am now writing thisat eight o’clock—the earliest I’ve been up for years!All the same, the night wasn’t wasted completely, for my annoyance and rejectionof her has left me aware of the things I ought to be thinking about. I now openJean Paul’s Fruit, Flower and Thorn Pieces, and feel excitement. Yes, theromantics of the 19th century were right; man ought to be more than man, morethan a social animal. Too much association with people sickens me. This is notbecause I dislike people; on the contrary, I like them too much. And yet socialintercourse is one thing, real “exchange” another. I don’t mean intellectualexchange, but any kind of “giving.” This girl Carlotta is not herself aparticularly happy person; that is, she’s not a particularly fulfilled person,not a grown up person. If she didn’t have a desirable body, I wouldn’t dream ofhaving any but the most casual relation with her.Because—this, I suppose is the problem—I can’t help feeling, in certain ways, akind of “spiritual aristocrat.” Pride and egoism, no doubt, but it still has itselement of truth. I can sympathize with snobs like Wilde and Yeats in a way,because I transpose their social snobbery onto another level. Hell, allphilosophers are snobs. Schopenhauer devoted a lot of space to railing againstthe mob and declaring that people who made noises should be dealt with sternlyby the law ...Nov. 1. A typical November day; drizzle and fog. I love such weather. So do alltrue Englishmen. (Strange, I suppose, that I think of myself as an Englishman;yet I have a genuine love for England, and a kind of love for Germany, and aloathing for the French, who are a feeble lot.) Why? Because, I suppose, such aday as this is already halfway towards Dickens’s foggy nights with the shopsfilled with holly and Christmas turkeys and Scrooge on his way home through theicy rain.Last night, suddenly impatient and bored, and also afraid that Carlotta mightcome and knock on my door, I cycled down to Fleet Street and went into the usualcafé. Bill Payne came in with another Bill—Bill Fletcher, whom I’d never met.They made an odd pair. Bill was in one of his periodic moods of contempt for allhumankind, and even went so far as to advocate dropping hydrogen bornbs “toliven people up.” His friend Fletcher was a curious type—tall, very good lookingin a clean-cut kind of way, with gentle manners and the eyes of a poet. (But heis an engineer—and a successful one.) This man struck me as one of the types Iought to introduce to Gertrude. A pure idealist of a rather tough kind. I meanthat he doesn’t seem to shrink from life; yet his theories are the mostairy-fairy I’ve ever heard. At one point, he said: “The world is like a brassband marching by, with everybody trying to make as much noise as possible—just ablaring. The music of the spirit is gentler, like the music of violins ... ” Hefinally invited us back to his studio, where he spends his evenings painting,and we went (both rather dubiously—neither of us has much sympathy for paintingand painters). He has a pleasant studio at the top of a house in NorthumberlandAvenue. But the paintings were more disconcerting than anything I’d expected. Tobegin with, all were in very pale pastel shades. Secondly, they were all verysymbolic, with lots of weird angelic figures hovering in the air. The one thatgave me most of a jar was a picture of a little clerk leaving his home on hisway to work, carrying a brief case, wearing his pin-stripes and bowler hat.Above him hovers an angelic figure, with her arms around his neck.I could see what he was getting at—that the “mystic presences” hover behind theworld. What Blake meant when he wrote:> How do you know but every bird that cuts the airy way> > Is an immense world of delight, closed to your senses five?All right, so perhaps there are lots of spirit violins playing inaudibly inRegent Street, and guardian angels hovering over Piccadilly Circus; but all thisfeeble spirituality irritates me. Fletcher also offered to play us some of hisown music. (He seems to be a man with many talents.) He sat at the piano andplayed us several pieces—all very slow and pensive. Afterwards, I asked him whohis favorite composer was, and he said Delius—as if I couldn’t have guessed.What baffles me about him is that he’s no “sensitive plant,” no maladjustedlife-hater, but an apparently contented man, married, with a child. Bill and Icouldn’t make him see that all this “sweetness and light” made his paintingslook like soap advertisements, and that no painter ought to stick symbolicangels into his canvases and still call it painting. He just didn’t see my pointof view, said Cézanne had no “spirituality.” Bill got very excited, and startedexplaining that what the human race needs is torture and crisis, not sweetnessand light. He seemed to be against Fletcher’s spirituality rather as theCommunists used to be against the Salvation Army—because it holds off the truerevolution with false hopes and inadequate half measures.Bill declared he would launch his new magazine with an article entitled: “BringBack the Rack,” a counterblast against the anti-capital-punishment people! Hesaid that if man won’t make voluntary efforts to achieve greatness, then he mustbe driven with a whip, and that the Hitlers and Stalins are the greatest friendsof humanity because they have the moral courage to recognize its feebleness anddrive it ruthlessly. He calls this “ultimate compassion,” and likens it to asurgeon amputating a gangrenous leg.Poor Bill Fletcher was horrified—he doesn’t know about Bill’s Welsh habit ofstating his case in somewhat rhetorical terms. It was amusing to see themtogether, but somehow futile, because they had no language in common. Anyway,Bill is too impatient to bother much about language—he would call ithair-splitting to stake out definitions.We left around midnight, having drunk a dozen cups of poisonously strong tea.Bill’s first comment was “What’s the use of talking to weak people?” I didn’tpoint out that he had been doing most of the arguing—I’m too lazy when I feel Ican’t communicate easily. We were both too wide awake to go home, so we wentback to the Fleet Street café and sat there until three this morning, talkingabout the need for a new literary age, and speculating on whether it would helpif we assassinated John Lehmann and Stephen Spender. After talks like this, Ifeel better; it seems to me that even if I’m cooped up in this room for anotherfive years, at least I’m doing something active about changing things—planning arevolution. Probably it’s as well that I remain unknown as long as possible.I cycled to Caroline’s flat and let myself in with my key. She didn’t even wakeup when I got into bed.I forgot to mention that I asked Bill Fletcher to come and meet Gertrude.Nov. 2. Complications continue. Carlotta came up to my room last night to ask ifI was annoyed with her. When I said I wasn’t, she asked me down for supper. Irefused, claiming I’d eaten (I hate “having supper” like that—too sociable). Butshe came up at about eleven with some German drink—Steinhager, I think shecalled it—and she sat around talking to me about her family. As I felt bored andsleepy, I finally suggested that she get into bed. She said she wouldn’t, thatit would be silly with her own bed downstairs, but made no move to go, so Isimply undressed and climbed in, and after a few more hesitations she did thesame. I don’t know why, because she was still sternly virginal—kept on her slipand pants as before. I suppose she may be afraid of sex, because she’s happyenough to be kissed and caressed. Or perhaps she wants to get her claws indeeper before she gives way. After half an hour of frustrations that were asshattering as braking violently in a car, I turned over and went to sleep, andwas asleep when she got up this morning (one advantage of staying on my homeground!). She actually brought me coffee at half past nine, and sat on the bed,and behaved more affectionately than when undressed and in bed. I shall neverunderstand women. Again, I am face to face with this stupid conjuring trick ofsex. This morning, after she’d gone, I reread my entry about the time she felloff the ladder. I can still recall my excitement at the sight of her legs. Why,then, don’t I feel anything analogous when I watch her taking her clothes off toget into bed? I remember when I first read Wuthering Heights I was irritated bythe narrator’s confession of his emotional capriciousness—how he fell violentlyin love with a girl at a watering place, but as soon as she obviously returnedhis affection, lost all interest in her and fled. This seems to me childish andboring. I cannot bear such people when I meet them—and I’m always meeting them.(The other night, for example, in the café with Bill, some mincing queer calledDenison came over; great expert on ballet—he thinks—and contemptuous when I saidI thought Nijinsky was important in other ways than as a dancer. Anyway, thisDenison struck me as the arrogant, immature, capricious type, and I loathedhim.) And yet in spite of my hatred of emotional capriciousness, I find thisphysical capriciousness deep in me, and I can do nothing about it. Again, Isuppose it’s the abstract feminine that allures us, and the personal contactspoils it. The personality blankets the sexual drive in rather the same way thatsex is less satisfying wearing a contraceptive. (I recall an interestinginstance of this. When I first went to bed with Caroline—before she visited thebirth-control clinic—she insisted on my wearing a rubber, and I saw the sense ofthis. And yet one night, as I was making love to her, I felt irritated by it,and by maneuvering my hands—which were under her bottom—I managed to get thedamn thing off without her knowing; I then experienced a tremendous excitementas I continued to make love to her, feeling as if we were now really having sex.The feeling was so strong that I felt a compulsion not to withdraw. I realizedthis was stupid, that I didn’t want her to have a baby; yet my response to thisthought was: So what? It cost me an enormous effort to do the sensiblething—like Ulysses hearing the Sirens’ song. This seems like a plain case of theLife Force trying to persuade us to perpetuate the species; yet I wonder whetherthe motive of the confidence trick was as simple as that?)Nov. 3. I spent most of yesterday at Gertrude’s, helping her redecorate thebathroom. It was another windy, rainy day, and after lunch we lay on the setteein front of the fire, listening to the rain—the pleasantest occupation Iknow—and ended by making love. She’s funny. She obviously finds it incrediblywicked and exciting to do it downstairs in the daytime. This makes it seem quitedifferent. She also took off her dress. Afterwards, I refused to give her thedress and her pants until she’d put on the kettle for tea. She went off into thekitchen, but some tradesman rang the doorbell, and she came flying back in as ifthe day of judgment had arrived. Incidentally, she tells me that the Jehovah’sWitnesses suspect her of sexual immorality, and Brother Robbins gave her a gravelittle sermon on the subject the other day.She told me she had a letter from Oliver Glasp;3 apparently he’s in Lancaster. Ican’t imagine what he’s doing there. Gertrude says he’s got the Preston artgallery to give him an exhibition, and they’ve bought two of his paintings. Heinquired about Christine, but not about me. I asked her not to mention that I’vebrought Christine here. He’d probably suspect my motives! It’s a pity thatChristine’s father stopped her coming to see me; she’s one of the brightestchildren I ever met. There was even a time when Gertrude thought of adopting herand sending her to a university.We had a curious evening. I had asked Bill Fletcher to come over to meetGertrude. But she told me she’d agreed to let a Yugoslav friend use her sittingroom for a meeting. There was nothing for it but to sit through the meeting.This proved to be unexpectedly interesting. Fletcher arrived at half past sevenand had supper with Gertrude and me. Finally, the Yugoslav came, a man calledGeorgi—I can’t pronounce his surname. Apparently he is changing houses thisweek, and can’t hold the meeting in his own place. He was a middle-aged man,obviously Jewish, with a gentle, broad face, brown eyes with the liquidexpression of a spaniel, and a large waistline. He was thrown out of Yugoslaviayears ago for Red sympathies, then out of Germany in the thirties. He seemed tolove music, which recommended him to me, and we immediately got into adiscussion about Bruckner and Mahler. At eight o’clock, the rest of the meetingbegan to arrive—all very young men, and a couple of girls; pleasant, naive youngchaps, but they didn’t strike me as particularly bright. Finally, we settleddown to the meeting. Georgi talked of tolerance and universal love, andadvocated complete anarchism, with everybody “doing as they pleased.” The youngmen all listened with complete seriousness, their chins in their hands. Afterhalf an hour of this kind of thing—all very vague—we had coffee, and Georgithrew open the discussion. Bill Fletcher started in, very enthusiastic, byasking about the role of the spirit in this ideal community. He got the shock ofhis life when Georgi scornfully dismissed the idea of spirit as a trick of thepriests. (It was obvious they were talking at complete cross purposes.) Georginow launched into a lengthy denunciation of religion, calling priests “blackvultures” and scavengers, and declaring that the free man can live without suchillusions. Fletcher gently insisted that he meant “spirit” in the sense in whichyou would talk of the spirit of Beethoven or Mahler. Georgi retorted that inthat sense, they would do better to discuss Beethoven’s music—or better still,listen to it—rather than talking as if “spirit” were something that could besold in bottles for the nourishment of his Utopia. (At this point I got rathertired, didn’t feel inclined to sort out their beautiful linguistic tangle, andsneaked off into the kitchen to have a little of the kind of spirit that comesin bottles.)When it was all over—well after midnight—and we were in bed, I asked Gertrudewhat she thought of Georgi’s denunciation of religion. She said mildly that shethought he was a “good man,” so it didn’t matter much how he expressed himself;she then turned her attention to lovemaking. I’m convinced that, like all women,her world is “personal”; she wants love and security, and she’d cheerfully fixher affections on the devil if he could give her these.But I left here this morning feeling irritable and oppressed. What do I careabout Georgi and Fletcher and their silly wrangles that spring out of a desireto talk and be sociable rather than any need to arrive at results? I’d like tobe away from here—at least away from this area. I think of Oliver with a kind ofenvy, remembering his old room in Whitechapel, his obsessed pictures; he somehowsucceeded in living like a monk. I want to live like a monk in theory. Inpractice, I keep getting overdoses of people, which is rather like gettingyourself blind drunk on rum. The taste of it stays with you for weeksafterwards, and the mere thought of its taste is enough to make the stomachlurch. You can make yourself sick on an overdose of almost anything. Well, I’vegot people-poisoning at present, and I’ve been suffering from a mild case of itfor what seems years.I sit here, in this room, and the problem seems at once immense and nonexistent.Life is a desert of freedom; but because it is a desert, we are too free. It islike being suspended in a total void, with no gravity; because you can doanything, you do nothing, and every effort to change your position costs immenseenergy because there’s nothing to brace yourself against; try to move your armbackward, and your whole body turns, leaving the arm in the same position. Isometimes used to wonder how certain writers could spend their whole lives in anunchanging state of despair or feebleness. Now I know; they imagine that thechance position into which freedom has flung them is a law of the universe.Nov. 4. Things are coming to a head sooner than I expected. These complicationsbore me.Last night, I met Carlotta in the hall and asked her to come and have a drink.She knew what I had in mind, and came up with her Steinhager, and we drank somewine and she cooked me some frankfurters with spinach. At about midnight,without even asking her, I undressed and got into bed. And without any comment,she went out. I assumed she had gone back to her own room; but she actually wentto the bathroom, and came and climbed into bed just as I was dozing off. I wokeup and tried kissing her, but a hand on her thigh got firmly pushed away. So Idecided to make the best of it; I said good night, turned over, and went tosleep. After half an hour or so, her movements woke me up; evidently myindifference didn’t suit her either. So I turned over again, moved on top of her(which she doesn’t mind, provided I restrict myself to kisses) and allowedmyself to get excited. Although she was wearing a slip, it was above her waist.These girls puzzle me. She is in bed with a naked man; she is wearing nothingbut her pants, allowing him to lie on top of her and get her into a state ofsexual excitement—and yet for some weird reason of prudery or virtue, she denieshim the “final privilege.” I carried on like this for about half an hour, thenfinally reached down and pulled aside the leg of her pants. She still showed nosign of objecting, so I hastily carried on. However, I’d barely achieved myobjective when the accumulated tension of half an hour exploded and I was forcedto withdraw ignominiously. I decided this irony was too much, and turned overand went to sleep. I woke up again a few hours later, but didn’t feel thefaintest inclination to take advantage of my new status as her lover. Irealized, to my dismay, that somehow I didn’t want this to turn into another“regular relationship” of the Caroline type.She slept later than usual. Suddenly, I was awakened by Caroline entering theroom. My first relief at seeing Carlotta was gone vanished when I saw that herskirt was still on the chair; a few moments later, she came in in her slip.Caroline was just looking pointedly at the skirt, and starting to ask me whom itbelonged to. They stared at one another with hostility; Caroline merely said:“I’ll see you later,” and went out. Carlotta only said: “I’m sorry, but she’sbound to find out sooner or later, isn’t she?”I only turned over to the wall, thinking: “Damn all women.” I didn’t ask eitherof them into my life; why do they have to start behaving as if they’d bought me?Later, Carlotta brought me coffee, and got into bed herself to drink it. Thiswas obviously by way of consolidating her position; I found I no longer had toresist a temptation to undress her; I didn’t feel any inclination at all. Sheasked me if I was in love with Caroline; I said no, but I was fond of her, anddidn’t want to hurt her. Finally, Carlotta said: “Well, you’d better go to herthen, hadn’t you?,” and got out of bed. I didn’t call her back; I felt all thiswas a kind of blackmail, but it was passing over my head.However, I went down to the coffee house to see Caroline (she works there twomornings a week now). To my relief, she didn’t show any sign of jealousy, andwas obviously perfectly ready to believe me when I said that very little hadhappened. I swore that I hadn’t made love to the girl (I thought my abortiveattempt last night didn’t count), and said, truthfully, that I hadn’t expectedher to sleep with me last night, but that she’d climbed into my bed. Carolinedeclared that she had noticed a long time ago that Carlotta had “designs” on me,claimed that Carlotta always scowled when she opened the door to her, and saidthat I ought to move out of the place. I was so charmed by Caroline’s good humorand lack of reproach that I agreed to look for a new place this afternoon.(Caroline said I could move in with her for a few days, but I thought ofMadeleine, and refused.) So this afternoon, I took the tube over to Whitechapel,and spent the afternoon looking around. Just as I’d about given up, disgustedwith poky rooms where the landlady’s family have non-stop right of way and thehouse smells of cabbage, I had some luck. My friend the barber in Hanbury Streettold me about a flat only a few minutes away, and I found the owner and lookedat it. He wanted thirty pounds for “fittings,” but the rent is 25 bob aweek—five shillings less than my present room—so I wrote him a check on the spotand took it. It hasn’t much furniture, and is at the very top of the house, butapart from that, it seems too good to be true. I rang Caroline at school, toldher to meet me, and took her to see it.There is only one minor problem. When I got back, I felt I had to go and tellCarlotta immediately—I would have felt too much of a coward otherwise. But asusual, I tried to soften it all I could, said I wasn’t leaving because of her,and hinted that this room is too close to Gertrude. Dishonest, I suppose, but Idetest hurting people. Finally, I said that I hoped I would still see her.Unfortunately, she immediately took me up on this, and has offered to help memove in! Luckily, Carlotta’s tied up with this house a great deal and is afraidof the landlady, who lives only a few doors away and loves to drop inunexpectedly.Nov. 5. For two days I’ve been involved in the loathsome process of moving andtrying to get this place into livable condition. I decided I could move my stuffwith the bike in about three journeys, but it actually took seven. Even then,Gertrude brought over a load of stuff in her car. I told her frankly why I wasleaving—she got very upset at first—and now she seems reconciled to it, althoughshe hates Whitechapel. I am now alone again, it is half past eight, and thereare sounds of fireworks from the street; I passed a magnificent bonfire in themiddle of a piece of waste ground two streets away. Yes, I think I shall enjoyliving here; perhaps I can get more solitude in the midst of so many strangers.The district reminds me constantly of Austin and Oliver, but I suppose this willpass.Strange, how a mere change of environment seems to give you a better grip onliving. Temporary, I suppose. For a person like me, life is bound to bedifficult. Wells says somewhere that “we intellectual workers” are like theearliest amphibians dragging themselves out of the sea and learning to walk onland. Man’s natural sphere is everyday life, action, movement, not sitting in aroom, thinking. The amphibian on land naturally finds it hard work moving aroundon his flippers, and will continue to do so until he develops legs. I still haveno legs. Besides, my kind of thinking is a kind that is foreign to the humanrace. We know how to think objectively, about mathematics or philosophy. But totry to force your own life into a strait jacket of thought, to see meanings init—that is infinitely more difficult. When we used to play blindman’s buff askids, they blindfolded you, then turned you around half a dozen times to makeyou lose your sense of direction. Well, life is like that, only a thousand timesmore so. You are dropped into the world, turned around and upside down, hit onthe head, stupefied with noise and lights, and then told to guess “what life isall about.” Just to make it more difficult, they repeat the bewildermenttreatment every few days, just in case you’re succeeding. Or it’s like Theseus’maze, where you’re continually crossing your own tracks. This diary, like all mywriting, is my own attempt to maintain a sense of direction by a ball of thread;but it’s not nearly so efficient as Theseus’ thread, because I cross my owntrack every few weeks, and realize that a new “idea” that has excited me is onlya slightly different version of an idea I wrote in my journal two years ago.Yes, this is the problem: we try to find a way in the maze by thought, byapplying the methods of science to actual living, but so far, the results arenot very spectacular.Later. I’ve just had a curious experience. When I’d written the above, my penran out of ink, and I discovered I’d left the ink behind in Camden Town. So Iwent out and bought some. Then I had a walk around, to stretch my legs, andeventually found myself outside a public library. Naturally, I went in. I foundan interesting book on the Faust legend, and sat down in a quiet corner to readit. From where I was sitting, I could see across to the desk where theassistants stamp books, and I couldn’t help noticing one girl, dressed in red,who was returning books to their shelves. She wasn’t particularly pretty—ratherbony, and in her late twenties—but something about the way she was dressed andthe way she walked aroused my interest. It may only have been that her red skirtwas rather tight, but she made me think immediately of bed. As I watched her, aman came to the bookshelves near where I was sitting, and looked through thesection on magic, ghosts, etc. He also struck me as an interesting type—a bigman, running to fat, about 35 or 40, with a completely bald head. If he were anactor, he’s the sort I’d choose to play the mad scientist. This man also glancedonce or twice at the girl in red; then he took a book, and came and sat within afew feet of me, on the other side of the table. I felt him looking at me, butpretended to be reading. After a few minutes, I heard him muttering somethingunder his breath, and I looked at him cautiously over the top of my book. He hadodd round eyes with a bulgy look, and he was staring at the girl who was nowback at the desk. Suddenly I experienced a feeling of tension—the kind of thingyou might feel if you went into a room where two people hate one another,although you’ve never met either of them before. Then, a moment later, the girlcame over to our bookshelf, carrying a pile of books. The man looked away as shecame toward us, then looked at her again when she had turned her back. Suddenly,she looked around, first at me, then at the man, wearing a startled expression,as if one of us had pinched her. Then an odd thing happened. I was watching hercautiously, sitting well back with my book propped on the desk. She stoodstaring at the man, quite openly, and went very pale, then very red. He wasstill staring back at her. Then she took a step forward, as if she wanted to hithim, then stopped and turned away. At this point, he said: “Excuse me, miss. Iwonder if you could help me?” He had a heavy, actor’s type of voice, ratherrich, with a faint lisp. He got up and went over to her, then stood there, veryclose, talking to her in a low voice. I was fascinated by it, because for somereason, I felt certain she didn’t know him, and that he had noticed in herexactly what I had noticed: a kind of sexual tension. He was standing there,facing her as he talked, but much closer than you would normally stand if youwere asking a librarian an innocent question. Her back was toward me, so that Icouldn’t see what was happening, but I could swear he placed a hand on herbreast. Then she said, in an odd, strained voice: “It’s in the specialcollection, sir, in the basement. If you’d like to come this way, I’ll showyou.” For a moment, he looked at me, and his look was as clear as if he’d winkedat me and said: “You see, I’ve done it.” As they walked away, he had his handlightly on the back of her dress.I sat there, trying to untangle the knot of lust inside me.I’ve heard that certain animals perform a ritual courtship in public, but thiswas the first time I’d seen a man seduce a strange woman in a library.About ten minutes later, they came upstairs, and he went out immediately. When Iwent out, I looked at her, and she looked back at me and blushed.There may, of course, be another explanation. He may have been her lover;perhaps they had quarreled and he’d come to make it up with her. Or perhaps Iwas imagining it all, and he was really interested in the special collection.But I don’t believe either of these explanations.A Frenchman said “Women like to be violated.” While I don’t think this is true,I do believe that certain women emanate a kind of helplessness toward some men.This is the opposite of the come-hither sexiness of certain attractive women(Caroline, for example). I wonder if loneliness and sexual frustration can givesome women a kind of aura, something like the smell given off by a female animalin heat? This was what I seemed to sense about the girl in red as soon as I sawher; something about her conveyed an invitation to take her brutally, and I gotthe impression that the bald-headed man had done just that.All this has made me unpleasantly excited, and unable to continue the train ofthought that I started before I went out to buy ink. I shall try to sleep.Later. I feel tired and depressed. My vitality has sunk so low that I can’t evenfall asleep. Why? I suspect that, somewhere down inside me, there’s a knob likethe volume-control on my radio, and it turns my vitality up or down. I wish Icould find it ...It’s stupid. I have too much freedom. Consequently I don’t know what to do orwhere to go. I’m now in a position I would have envied three years ago. I have aroom of my own, enough money to live without working, and a few records andbooks. And yet I need to distract myself with seductions.But there is always a good way of overcoming this “excess of freedom”—that is,to make an exercise of recalling the worst moments in your life, or in otherpeople’s lives. When he was in front of the firing squad, Dostoevsky must havefelt that he knew what life was all about. I often meditate on that episode inLawrence’s Seven Pillars when the Turkish leader has an old man thrown into afurnace, and then orders everyone to listen; there is a crashing noise, and theleader observes: “Their heads always pop like that.” I imagine that I amstanding there, waiting to be thrown into the furnace; all the life and power inme rises up, and suddenly I know a little about the value of life.But what is it that actually happens in these moments? It is worth analyzing,because I suppose it is the whole subject of this diary, and of all my work. Itis not that you see the value of life. It is more complicated. The energy in yourises up to meet the emergency. It is as if life said: “You are allowed only somany gallons of energy per day, but for special emergencies, you can draw uponten times that amount.” That immense flow of energy is vision. We usually put solittle energy into living. Quite small inconveniences can make us think thatit’s not worth being alive, or at least, make us temporarily incapable ofpleasure. We so easily relapse into a state of sullenness. “If life can treat meas badly as this, I’m damned if I’m going to put any energy into living.” And,like angry children, we refuse to be made to laugh. Now if, at that moment, wewere confronted with a real threat to life, that refusal to enjoy living wouldvanish immediately.It seems to me that this refusal to enjoy living is somehow the basis of thewhole problem—the biggest problem of all. Because what we are doing in thismoment is assigning a fixed value to life. Most of us need much less than Job’ssuffering to refuse to make any further effort. We lie down in the middle of theroad, like Ivan Karamazov’s sinner, and refuse to budge. The woman in the localcafé has a fixed scowl of bad temper on her face, and even small inconveniencesmake her thoroughly impolite (nobody can bear the red-headed bitch). Obviously,she is within the great gray shadow of boredom. A more precise name is neededfor this bad temper, this devaluation of life, this decision that it isn’t worthmaking any further effort, this area of human emotion where pleasure fails toarouse a smile (although we still object as vigorously to pain). I suppose itcould be called the indifference threshold. This indifference threshold iseverything that is wrong with human nature, and therefore corresponds to whatthe Catholics call original sin.We accept pleasure as our right, as an animal basking in the sun acceptssunlight as its right. But there is no reason at all why our lives ought to bepleasant. If they are to be made pleasant, worth living, then it must be withinfinite calculation—just as an animal’s life cannot be pleasant because the sungoes in and the season of frost and hail arrives. “Natural life,” “taking lifeas it comes,” is death. We do not yet know how to live; we haven’t even thefaintest idea. But pain does make us think; and so it ought to: make uscalculate how to avoid it. And then we learn that avoiding it is not enough,because a life without pain is not necessarily very satisfactory.This, I would say, is about the point at which the human race has arrived atpresent—at least, our little Western bit of it. This idea that “freedom frompain is not enough” is now a cultural cliche; it has been said in a hundreddifferent ways by a hundred different authors. In Shakespeare’s time, a playabout boredom would have been unthinkable. Now we have an extensive literatureof boredom—a great deal of it Russian, beginning with Dostoevsky’s Possessed.That is why we think Dostoevsky so great: all his work is completely preoccupiedwith these problems that are becoming the great problems for the human race.Kierkegaard was the first to give boredom its central place when he stated hisprinciple “All men are bores” (and, therefore, are bored), and pointed out thatthere is only one satisfactory way of overcoming boredom: not conquering theworld, like Alexander (or leaping into bed with different women, like me), butdeveloping an inner concentration—Shotover’s seventh degree of concentration.This inner concentration is what happened to Dostoevsky in front of the firingsquad. It is also what happens in a sexual orgasm. I am actually aware that myinner being contracts and concentrates. It is like a large, diffused pool oflight; the orgasm is like a magnifying glass that makes it concentrate into onetiny burning point.But we’re so horribly dependent on external stimuli ... I scream at my energieslike a sergeant major, trying to force them to form into ranks and concentratefor an attack; they’re a sloppy bunch, and they refuse to stand together; theylounge around in corners of my being, smoking and telling dirty stories. Thethreat of death gets them together all right.What, then, is the answer? I know one: we have to get used to using a lot ofenergy, to driving ourselves. Graham Greene’s priest, about to be executed,reflects that it would have been so easy to be a saint. Well, it is easy. Yetthis tremendous dullness blankets us.The will is the compeller of destiny. Merely for the will to spring erect andwant something is enough to set the wheels into motion. If we all realized this,we might will more. What deters us is the possibility of wasting our efforts.Kafka manages to catch an extreme sense of this waste of effort, this lack ofconnection between effort and achievement, so that whenever heroes set out to dosomething, it never gets done; he is abnormally aware of the feebleness of thehuman will power. (This doesn’t make him a good writer; I can’t stand him.)The good moment comes when we ask clearly: What do we want, and how can it beachieved? Then we are in motion as human beings ought to be in motion all thetime, every moment of their lives. They should encourage themselves to ask “Whatdo I want?,” to encourage the imagination to take greater and greater leaps intopossibility. This is what human life ought to be; not this everlasting driftingand marking time. After writing these words, I look out of my window at thepeople in the street, and the sense of irony invades me: that is, the disparitybetween what should be and what is. I can see something of what the human raceis capable of. I am not speaking about the superman; all the talk for andagainst the superman is balls, missing the real point. I am talking about humanengineering. I am evolution made conscious. I am trying to help life forward, or“in its struggle upward.” I look at these shabby people walking past; they arenice enough, most of them good, decent human beings—amazingly decent consideringthe circumstances they live in; it’s amazing there aren’t more criminals tryingto get their own back on life. But they aren’t good enough. Why are they likethis? Is it all a part of “God’s will?” No, I can’t believe it. Evolution isdoing its best, in its fumbling way; it has taken a lot of trouble with thehuman race. Every one of us is more complex than a thousand electronic brains.But some of its best ideas have canceled each other out. Civilization, languageand science were some of the best ideas it ever had, and they have poised man ona springboard from which he could become anything, a kind of god. But before mancan go any further, he needs to develop a quite new faculty—the faculty I amtrying so painfully to develop, sitting in front of this typewriter for days, anew way of grasping life. They say that certain fishes have nerves in theirsides that register the pressure of every current that flows against them, sothat if an enemy comes, they can sense him by the changed pressure of water longbefore they see him. Well, this is what we all need, a new sensitivity toliving. It is not simply a more analytical approach to life, although that is agreat part of it. These people in the street all take life as it comes. Tonightthey feel drunk and happy; in two days’ time, they might be completelymiserable; but they never try to connect the two states, and ask which was the“right” reaction to life, or how far either of them are right. They crystallizetheir conclusions about life in a few convenient rules of thumb—a stitch in timesaves nine, never say die, no use crying over I spilt milk, and so on. They livefrom minute to minute, learning almost nothing. We must develop a type of manwho carries analysis in his sides, like the nerves of the fish. He will overcomethis immense obstacle to the human race, this original sin, this indifferencethreshold. The problem of why we die must be attacked as scientifically as anyother problem of civilization. We developed the long-playing record because itwas inconvenient to put a symphony on records that play for only five minutes aside. We must develop the long-playing life, because it is almost impossible todo anything worth while for evolution when the side comes to an end every 70years. At the moment, this is unthinkable because people get fed up even withtheir mere 70 years. Even Shaw declared that he was tired of life and wanted todie. So the first problem is the conquest of boredom. For there will be no pointin living longer until we can also live more powerfully, until my brains nolonger feel like treacle when I get up in the morning and my body refuses toobey my mind, and my consciousness is like a pond that has been stirred up bycattle drinking and stamping in it. My mind is clear tonight because I’vechanged my lodging and have been stimulated by the change. But I must learn tomake my consciousness clear at will, learn to defeat this sleepiness.Nov. 6. A few of the disadvantages of this place begin to appear. I seem to havea madman below me who is a musician of some kind, and he plays the piano at allhours. At first I enjoyed it—he played a Beethoven sonata—but after 24 hours ofthe racket, even the singing of angels would become intolerable to a writer whowants to concentrate. I finally went downstairs and banged on his door, meaningto ask him politely if he could restrict his playing to the daylight hours, orat least stop before six in the morning. However, the playing went on, and noone came to the door, so I can only presume he’s deaf. I have played mygramophone at top volume for hours by way of getting my own back, but to noeffect. The only thing that occurs to me is to give a noisy party here that willgo on all night, and make sure that everybody dances. When he protests, I canoffer him a deal!The main problem with this place is that it hasn’t got a phone, so I’m more orless out of touch with Gertrude and Caroline unless I go out and phone them.Anyway, I have a suspicion that Caroline is having an affair with someone at herschool. Madeleine makes sly references to “Peter” and Caroline looks annoyed.Still—on my central problem, which I must pursue in spite of these stupidities:why is the human memory so short? There is more truth than we realize in theVictorian cliché about “counting your blessings.” I suppose the Life Force wantsus to be perpetually unsatisfied, to get the maximum of work out of us. It’slike a man who climbs a mountain because he hates the plains, but every time hesits down for a rest, he discovers that the ground is still there, right belowhim, and that it rises, like the sea.It is easy to oversimplify this problem. Blake says that we must “love withoutthe help of anything on earth.” This is nonsense. Certain things are necessary.We have to breathe, we have to eat and drink. I would find it appallinglydifficult to live without books and music, although I daresay I could forcemyself.But we need to develop a kind of spring mechanism about reality, so that we canwithdraw and then return with greater force. If my head is held under water fortwo minutes, the air tastes incredibly sweet to me when I can breathe again. IfI hear no music for months, a Beethoven symphony can seem almost unbearablysatisfying.The mind is the “spring” that could hurl us back at the things we love so thattheir impact continues to be intensely satisfying. If the mind could be usedproperly, our love of life could be intensified tenfold. Unfortunately, the mindis a feeble spring that seems to be unable to move the weight of our emotionsand reactions.Yes, the strength of the mind must be intensified. At present, it is like a tinyengine in a monstrous and heavy car. We need artificial aids to keep up ourappetite for life.Later. When I had written the above lines, I decided that I needed theartificial aid of a bottle of beer to wash down my lunch, so I went to the pubon the corner. There I ordered a cheese sandwich and a Guinness. Sitting in theopposite corner, I noticed a man and a woman who immediately interested me. Theman was obviously Jewish, wore very shabby, dark clothes, but had a goodface—big forehead, the bulging eyes of a crank or an artist, weak mouth, yetsomething strangely attractive about him, perhaps because he reminds me of apicture of Mahler. The woman was delicious, but I can’t describe her, except tosay that she was dark, looked tired, and was obviously a great deal younger thanthe man. I found her so delightful that I kept watching them. They were eatingsandwiches, and both drinking half pints of beer. Usually, I don’t noticepeople, but I suppose the woman attracted me. From watching them, I gatheredthey were either lovers or married; he kept smiling at her with a kind of pity,then reaching over and touching her hand. Then he’d forget her and go off intoabstraction; then, when she spoke to him, look at her as if he was surprised shewas still there.I finished my beer at about the same time that they did; as they got up, I alsogot up and followed them out. Then, to my surprise, they stopped in front of mydoor, and began searching for a key. I came up to them, and produced my own key,and asked them if they were trying to get in. It turned out that they liveunderneath me! I asked: “Oh, you’re the man who plays the piano all night?” Hesmiled, as if I was paying him a compliment, but she looked embarrassed, andsaid she hoped it hadn’t kept me awake. I am always a coward in matters likethis; I said no. By this time, we had reached their door, and they went in. I’mglad now that I didn’t start a quarrel with him.No doubt they will turn out to be a couple of bores with commonplace minds.Still, she’s delightful. I’d like to get to know them ...Nov. 7. Gertrude came over to see me last night, and the evening turned intosomething like a quarrel—the first we’ve had. I’m not sure what she has on hermind, but I don’t really care. Possibly she thinks I moved here to avoid her, orperhaps she suspects I still see Caroline. She was curious about this journal,which I carefully locked away when she arrived. I told her I was writing a novelabout sex, and she immediately said she thought I was far too interested in sex.I suspect Brother Robbins has been preaching at her again. I didn’t feel likearguing—it would be pointless. I refused to go back to Hampstead with her, wehad a meal in a café across the road, and hardly spoke. Afterward, she said shehad to get back home, and drove off. I was feeling pleased about this. I’ddetest hurting her and making a move to break with her, but if she wants tocause the break ... Just as I was about to go on writing, she came back intears, said she didn’t think I cared about her any more, and I had to sootheher. Naturally, we ended in bed. When she left at about two in the morning, Isat looking out of the window at the streetlamp and thinking: “Fool, fool.”But I tried explaining to her that I can never look at sex as she does. For her,sex is either “lust,” and therefore wicked, or an expression of a lifelongdevotion. I don’t care much about either. Lifelong devotion is all very well,but what does it matter when it means only a relation between two inefficientmachines, both condemned to death? I have been reading Wells’s Star Begottentoday, and it strikes me that I am a “Martian”—one of those people who justdoesn’t seem to feel and think in the categories that make other people feelcomfortable. (Camus wrote about the same idea several years later, but notnearly so excitingly as Wells.) It annoys me to feel that I haven’t yet startedliving, simply because I don’t know where to start untangling the mess of humanlife. I cannot understand why it doesn’t worry other people. I feel like amotorist who notices a strong smell of burning and a grinding noise from insidethe engine, and I want to stop the car and have a look. But everybody elsedrives along happily, ignoring the smell of burning and the grinding, apparentlyfeeling that everything is as it should be.Hence my absorption in sex. Because there are rare moments—not necessarily atthe moment of orgasm, but often throughout the whole act—when the burning stops.Or, to change the metaphor, when some slight adjustment seems to set the wholebeing in tune—like turning the knob on a radio and suddenly getting a stationwith absolute clarity, without interference. This is what Yeats means:> What were all the world’s alarms> > To mighty Paris when he found> > Sleep upon a golden bed> > That first dawn, in Helen’s arms?These lines have always moved me. We contain within ourselves power to overcomeall the degradations and irritations, to leave them behind as finally as anadult man leaves behind mumps and measles. The sexual act is an insight intopower, a kind of invitation to greatness.We know nothing about the movement of destiny. We are still children in thescience of living. We live clumsily, by rule of thumb, wasting 99 per cent ofour time and energy. And yet that moment “on a golden bed” promises a new kindof man.It is true that sex cannot always bring this revelation. Yeats is right—it comesto a Paris who has gone to a great deal of trouble to get Helen into bed, to aFaust on his first night with Marguerite. I suppose we take sex too casually.But sex is an act of magic, an incantation of the unseen, the strangelyintelligent and patient forces of evolution.Later. The business of the man downstairs becomes more intriguing. I havediscovered his wife’s name—Diana. This doesn’t suit her, as she doesn’t look inthe least like a queen and huntress, and isn’t fair either. She has some of theloveliest eyes I’ve ever seen, and a curious, pointed little chin. I went outshopping half an hour ago, and when I came in, found her sitting halfway up thestairs massaging her eyelids as if she felt dizzy; a monstrous box ofgroceries—mostly cans—blocked the stairs. I asked her if I could carry it, andshe looked worried and said she could manage it. I asked her if she felt allright, and she said yes, she’d found the box rather heavy. I found her quitestunning—she’s the type who immediately arouses my protective instinct. I thinkshe must have noticed this, because she looked embarrassed and tried to let mepast. I insisted on carrying up the box anyway. She stood outside her door, keyin hand, waiting for me to go, as if she was afraid I might see the inside ofher room, so I came up. When I’d been in here five minutes, the woman from theflat above came down to ask me if I had a shilling for her meter (I think shereally wanted to have a look at me)—a pleasant old thing whose husband works inthe market. When I gave her the shilling, she stood at the door and talked, andtold me that she thought the man downstairs was mad. She also hinted atsomething else—I don’t know whether she meant drug addiction or simply alcohol,and I didn’t want to press her. Apparently my neighbor is called Kirsten, andmakes some kind of a living doing something or other for a music publisher. Hiswife has to go out to work to keep them going—she works in some small hosieryplace in Sidney Street. She also hinted that the wife has admirers; I don’t knowwhether she meant that she’s actually unfaithful, but the old lady seemed toimply that she wouldn’t blame her, since the husband is dotty. But she said thatKirsten thinks himself a great composer, which arouses my interest.Nov. 7. Letter from Caroline this morning, explaining that an actor wants tomarry her; she explains that she would rather marry me, but that she doesn’tfeel she should pass up this opportunity if I don’t want to.Nov. 8. Caroline came over last night to explain why she has to break with me.She seems to have an absolute obsession about getting married. Some small-partfilm actor has fallen for her. I told her that it would be insane of me tomarry, since I haven’t enough money for both of us to live. She immediately saidthat she wouldn’t mind working. I was forced to do a noble act—tell her Icouldn’t stand in her way, etc. Finally, she said good-by, and that she’d keepin touch, and went. I got undressed for bed. Two minutes later, she came back,took off her coat and dress, and climbed into bed, saying: “Oh, well, I may aswell stay till morning.” We had such a splendid night that I felt like askingher to jilt the actor and marry me.Still, she’s gone now, and I feel rather pleased—I don’t know why, because I wasfond of Caroline, and expect I always shall be. There’s something rather braveand decent about her. But Hesse is right; there’s a magic in each new beginning,and in most ends too.Oh damn all this stupidity. What do I care what impression I make on people?It’s because we waste our lives caring about other people that most of us remainmorons. The only thing I care about is this problem of consciousness. One ofthese days I’ll crack it, learn to increase my consciousness as easily as I canturn up the flame of an oil lamp.Later. I have just spent an evening with my mad composer and his wife. He’s farmore interesting than the old woman gave me to understand. I was playingMartinu’s fifth symphony when he knocked on my door and asked me what it was! Iinvited him to come in and hear it. He obviously didn’t much want to—seemed veryshy. But I let him listen without trying to make conversation, and he insistedon hearing it all the way through.I should mention that I had seen his wife, earlier in the day, walking along theWhitechapel Road with a flashy man in tweeds—looked like a bookmaker. I presumethis is one of the “admirers” the old woman talked about. When she saw me, shelooked embarrassed, and turned in the opposite direction.Anyway, the husband vanished after I’d played him the record, hardly botheringto say thank you. I began to see what the old woman meant when she called himeccentric. I was just about to start cooking my supper, an hour later, whensomeone knocked on my door. To my surprise, it was the wife. She explained thather husband wanted to know if I’d like to join them for supper. When I said I’dbe delighted, she looked embarrassed, came into the room, and then asked me ifI’d mind not mentioning that I’d seen her with a man today! I assured her that Iwouldn’t dream of it. She then started to explain to me that nothing was “goingon,” that the man was an old admirer who wouldn’t leave her alone, and that shesimply didn’t want to worry her husband. But she looked so guilty as she said itthat I found it hard to believe her. Then she added: “You see, my husband is avery talented man, and I don’t want to distract his mind from his work.” Isuspect she was a little resentful about having to ask me to supper, but I wastoo curious to get to know them to refuse.I guessed that there wouldn’t be much to drink, so I went out and got twobottles of wine before I joined them. I discovered later that I couldn’t havehit on a better way of making him talk. When I went in, he seemed embarrassed,and asked me if I’d excuse him while he finished working. He was scribbling awayon music paper (I gathered later that he was making a piano arrangement of somelight opera by Reynaldo Hahn). His wife laid the table and hardly spoke a word.The place was fantastically untidy, and I began to wonder if I hadn’t made amistake in coming down. Then it turned out that she was going to produce fish,which didn’t go with the red wine, and it really seemed that some fate was outto make the evening a fiasco.For the first ten minutes of the meal, he hardly said a word, and she asked mepolite questions about my writing. I began to wonder why they had invited me.However, we opened the wine—I needed it; Diana’s cooking is excellent and I washungry. Then we started to talk about Schoenberg, whom Kirsten had known inGermany in 1930; he drank a quantity of the wine, and suddenly became verylively. I find it difficult to describe Kirsten. A curiously weak, eager lookingman—at least, that is the first impression. When he gets carried away by talk,the weakness disappears. He has fine eyes, like his wife, very deep, and almostround, with huge eyelids. A tremendous forehead, a small, thin mouth with asensuous lower lip that would give an expression of cruelty to most men, and ayellowish complexion.As soon as his wife saw that I was listening to him with attention, and didn’tseem disposed to smile at some of his absurdities, she became far more friendly.I can see that she is certain that he’s a genius; nevertheless, she finds ithard work being married to him.The trouble with him is that he seems more completely “otherworldly” than anyoneI’ve ever known. When I said I liked Beethoven’s last piano sonata, he sat downand played it right through from memory, interrupting himself to make commentslike: “Here he leaves the world entirely behind and soars into the clouds,” or“I am convinced he wrote this variation with Plato’s Philosopher-King in mind.”(I asked him why; he thumped his heart and said: “I feel it.”) At the end, heexplained, with a curious, ecstatic expression: “This sonata presages the end ofcommerce and all forms of human selfishness. On the day when men turn into gods,they will play Beethoven’s ninth symphony as a hymn of triumph. But then theywill look back on man’s long struggle, on the painful road, on the indomitablespirit that drove us on. Then they will play Opus 111 in a mood ofreminiscence.” All this greatly excited me; I found myself looking at him with anew feeling; it suddenly seemed clear to me that in spite of the inflatedlanguage, he was a remarkable man, a kind of prophet.I asked him about his early life, and he gave me some details. He was born inVienna in 1910, the son of a Jewish father and an Austrian mother. The wholefamily was musical. His uncle was a cantor in the synagogue; his father hadknown Brahms and Hugo Wolf. As a child he saw a great deal of Bruno Walter, andKokoshka, the painter. His mother was a Catholic, and he was brought up as aCatholic. He started to learn the organ when he was about eight. When he wastwelve he played, at short notice, the organ part in one of Bruckner’s masses.He and several friends formed a music society, on the model of Schumann’sDavidsbündler. (He has a vast admiration for Schumann; he told me that, when hecould afford it, he liked to work on champagne, because Schumann worked onchampagne, and that when he drank the first glass out of a new bottle, he alwayssaid: “To the memory of a divine man.”) He said: “We ate and drank and breathedmusic; we thought of nothing but music.” In the late twenties, his father gotworried about Hitler; they moved to Prague, and the family fell on hard times.He had studied music in Vienna, but now had to take an office job. One of hissisters died—his favorite, he said—and his father began to drink too much. Hesaid: “I was in despair. I was tempted to kill myself. And it was in this moodthat I first realized that I would devote my life to music. One evening, thefamily were all out; I thought that if I intended to gas myself, now was thetime to do it. First of all, I sat down at the piano, and played myself someMahler—my own transcription of the Adagio of the tenth. Then all at once, I wentinto a condition of ecstasy. I had a vision. I thought that the ceiling of theroom dissolved, and I was looking up into the heavens. I cannot explain myfeeling, but suddenly I understood why the world has to suffer. I felt as if Godleaned down to me and said: ‘Don’t worry. There will be an end to suffering. Andwhen the end comes, all those who committed suicide, or died of discouragement,will want to die with shame. And the men who fought and refused to be defeatedwill know that they have saved the human race.’ Then I started to laugh, and Iplayed one of Beethoven’s bagatelles—the third of Opus 126—and vowed that Iwould live as a pure artist, without compromise.”At this point, to my surprise, his wife broke in: “Is it possible to livewithout compromise?” He said: “I think so, my dear. I have somehow managed to doit.” I felt like saying: “But your wife has to compromise.” I suspect this iswhat she may have been thinking. However, he was in fine form by this time,finished the bottle of wine, and began telling me about Brahms. He said thatBrahms once said to his father “The world will be saved by music.” Then heplayed me some of Brahms’ Handel variations with tremendous power andexpression, although he struck the wrong key every other note. He explained thatmodern musicians had lost the great faith, and that, without exception, they allwrote a corrupt music of the nerves, compromising with the worst elements inmodern culture. Berg’s Wozzeck seemed to be his particular detestation, althoughhe got nearly as irritable about Stravinsky, whom he called “a musical whore”because, he claimed, he changes his style to suit the changing taste. I askedhim if there were no living composer whom he admired, and he said that the onlyone he cared about was Pfitzner, whose Palestrina is the greatest and mostsublime opera of the twentieth century.By this time, he had got me a little bewildered. I had begun by thinking him acrank, then swung to the opposite opinion, and decided that I’d found a genius;now every word he said propelled me nearer to my first opinion. I asked him whyhe had listened so carefully to the Martinu this afternoon; he said that it wasmusic of tragedy, but that it was riddled with neurosis.He then proposed to play me some of his songs—a cycle of short poems by one ofhis old Viennese friends. He sang a couple of these to me, and I liked them—theywere rather Wolfian, and sounded well in German. But he then proceeded to praisethis friend—a man called Schindler—extravagantly, and proposed to read me hisown translations of some of Schindler’s poems. At this point, the whole thingturned into absurdity. He produced a great ledger, and proceeded to read me themost awful drivel since the great McGonagall.4 He was particularly enthusiasticabout a long poem in praise of man, full of cliches like: “Thy spirit reachethout towards the stars”; halfway through this thing (obviously inspired bySchiller’s Ode to Joy), he placed the ledger on the floor, leaned back in hischair, and proceeded to recite from memory, staring at the ceiling, and soundinglike some old ham from Drury Lane entertaining a theater queue. I glanced at hiswife; she kept her eyes on her knitting, but she looked very pink. I could nowunderstand why she hung around with a bookmaker type even though she thought herhusband a man of genius.Finally, he told me at length about an opera he is working on, to be called TheSpirit of Man, and based loosely on Imre Madách’s Tragedy of Man which, he toldme, is the greatest Hungarian play. He even played me the overture to the opera,but apart from a few lively passages, it didn’t strike me as in any wayinteresting. His wife fell asleep in her chair as he went on playing (the poorthing has to be at work at 7:30 in the morning), but he didn’t seem to notice.He then proposed that I should write him a libretto for a one-act opera. By thistime, I was half asleep, so I agreed. He said he wanted something aboutwitchcraft. Finally, his wife woke up, and staggered off to bed, after mutteringgood night. He proposed he should come up to my room and listen to someBeethoven; I was half asleep, so said that I didn’t want to wake the peopleabove me. This view obviously struck him as completely eccentric, but heshrugged, and offered to make some coffee; I said I was tired, and went off tobed. He went on playing the Handel Variations, and I lay in bed thinking abouthis wife. She is certainly one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen,even though I would find it impossible to explain the reason. Her coloring isextraordinarily delicate, so that when she blushes she looks like one of thoseblossoms painted by Hokusai, and she moves with the grace of a dancer.Unfortunately, this life of overwork she lives makes her look pale and strained.Obviously, she appeals to me because, in some indefinable way, she is my “type.”I could go deeper than this, but it would take me pages; besides, it wouldinvolve being immodest ...Yet I believe she knows how deeply I’m attracted toher, and accepts my admiration as she might accept a box of sweets. I’m not surehow far she responds to it.Later. After writing the above, I suddenly felt an intense desire to see Dianaagain. As it was around midday, I walked along to Sidney Street. She had told methe name of the place she worked in, so I hung around until half past twelve,when the girls came out. Diana wasn’t among them; I waited another ten minutes,then approached another girl who came out and asked about Mrs. Kirsten. She saidthat Mrs. Kirsten was inside, eating her lunch, so I asked her if she’d bringher out. A few minutes later, Diana came out, looking bewildered, and ratherdisappointed when she saw me. (I wonder if she expected her bookmaker type?) Isaid I’d hoped I could buy her some lunch in return for the supper last night.She actually looked scared, and said she always ate sandwiches for lunch. Iasked her if she’d eaten them yet, and she admitted she hadn’t, so I grabbed herarm and told her that today was going to be the exception. She protested—said itwould make her sleepy to eat a full lunch—but I insisted, so she finally camewith me to a place in the Mile End Road, where we got decent lamb chops. Shewouldn’t talk much. I noticed that her eyes are red today; I don’t know whethershe’s been crying, or if it’s just fatigue. At first I thought that she might befeeling guilty, eating lunch with a strange man, so I asked her if she thoughther husband would mind my taking her to lunch. She looked startled, and said:“Oh no, of course not,” and actually managed to smile, as if I’d at last saidsomething really funny.I even managed to persuade her to come into the pub next door, although she’donly drink fruit juice. I asked her point-blank about money, and she admittedthat they often live on four pounds a week. This is the real reason she eatssandwiches instead of a full lunch. (She wouldn’t admit this—claimed that it wasto do with her figure; but the poor thing wouldn’t be fat even if she expandedto twice her present size.) Her husband makes a little money by orchestratingvarious operettas and musical shows, and making piano versions of Oscar Strauss,Messager, etc. But apparently he spends most of this on his “invention,” a sortof organ, which he keeps in a shop in Hanbury Street, and on which he has nowworked for five years.I asked her how she’d met Kirsten. At first, she was unwilling to talk, but whenI’d pried a few sentences out of her, she went on of her own accord. I found itan interesting story. Diana’s father apparently made a lot of money inmanufacturing some domestic appliance. But being a domineering and reactionarysort of man, the other members of the firm got sick of him and somehow forcedhim out. He then wasted most of his money in lawsuits against the firm. Diana,his only daughter (there are two brothers, but the father hates them), was at afinishing school in Switzerland at the time all this was going on. Her motherdied; she came back to England to look after her father, who took out all hisdomineering instincts on her. As he wasted money in lawsuits, they were finallyforced to live in a Liverpool boarding house. Her father went to terrificlengths to scare away young men who were attracted by Diana; he was completelypossessive, and would hardly allow her out of the house without making herexplain where she’d been. Finally, Kirsten moved into the house, in the cheapestroom. The father apparently took rather a liking to him, although he made nosecret of thinking him a poor fish. Also, no doubt, he thought Diana was safeenough from Kirsten, since Kirsten was so much her senior, and not particularlyattractive. However, Diana found herself much attracted by Kirsten’s crankyidealism—it made a pleasant change from her father’s unending preoccupation withmoney—and also felt a certain pity for him because he seemed so helpless, andwould allow any shopkeeper to swindle him. This went on for about sixmonths—neither of them ever speaking a word about being attracted to oneanother, but just talking for hours when the old man was asleep or out. Then oneday, her father caught them talking on the stairs outside Kirsten’s room. Heflew into a rage, accused Kirsten of seducing his daughter, and demanded thatthe landlord should throw Kirsten out. He must have had a lot of influence withthe landlord, for Kirsten was given notice. Diana knew he had no money. She hada little of her own—left by her mother—but not much. She tried to give this toKirsten, and when he said he wouldn’t take it, told him that in that case, shewould go with him. The same evening, she eloped with him, and they were marriedtwo days later. Kirsten, apparently, would never have dreamed of making anyadvances himself! He didn’t even tell her he loved her until after they weremarried.She didn’t say much about her married life, but I think I can read between thelines. She then discovers that leaving a tyrannical father, she lands herselfwith a husband who is a mixture of a father and a helpless and very selfishchild. Apart from her finishing school, the poor girl never seems to have gotany fun out of life.She admitted to being born in 1932. That makes her 24 now, a year younger than Iam, and 22 years younger than her husband.I walked back to work with her, and watched her go into the miserable dump witha crowd of healthy looking cockney girls, all yawping to one another about rockand roll and Elvis Presley, and I realized that I feel very protective abouther. I suppose that’s halfway to being in love.Later. Kirsten came and interrupted me as I was writing, and asked me if I’dlike to hear him play the organ. I thought he meant his curious invention; so,being anxious to get a look at it, I went with him. However, we only went as faras the local church. He seems to have some kind of arrangement with the vicar,who allows him to play the organ on certain afternoons. He is, as far as I canjudge, an excellent player. After playing me some Franck and Buxtehude, hefinally did a Bach Toccata and Fugue, and made it sound tremendous and quiteinevitable. He went on and on, for over two hours, while I sat with him up inthe organ loft (and consequently unable to escape). There was no stoppinghim—Widor, Liszt, even Brahms. His approach is rather fierce and square, but heis so obviously absorbed by the music that you fail to notice the imperfections.We walked back here at six. (He remembered that his wife hadn’t a key, and thatshe’d probably be waiting.) However, she wasn’t there, so I went in with him.More reminiscences of the Davidsbündler in Vienna, and of Max Brod in Prague. Healso repeated that he wanted me to do him a libretto about witchcraft, so I saidI’d go and see what they had in the local library. I did this, and got out acouple of interesting books by Montague Summers. I took these into the localpub, feeling certain that he’d invade my room as soon as he heard me come in! Heseems to have taken a great liking to me, but uses me as a kind of taperecorder, to be talked at. He insists that I call him Robert. And when Imentioned that I’d taken Diana out for lunch, all he said was “I hope she didn’tallow you to pay for her,” as if the poor girl were in the habit of cadginglunches from his friends.When I finally got home, I found Gertrude waiting for me (I’d left my dooropen). She was in a rather gloomy mood, and began asking me about Caroline,saying that Caroline’s mother was sure I was still seeing her, and that she wasafraid Caroline might get herself pregnant. I told her that I’d met Caroline afew days ago, and that she told me she was getting married to an actor. Thisseemed to reassure her. Someone knocked on my door, and Diana opened it. Whenshe saw Gertrude, she looked disappointed, and said it didn’t matter. I suspectshe wanted to talk to me about something, and felt sorry I wasn’t alone.Gertrude immediately looked suspicious about her, so I had to tell her aboutKirsten and his wife at length, and my project of the opera libretto. I saw thegleam of predatory interest in her eye when I talked about Kirsten. (There aretimes when I believe that Gertrude would like to collect a houseful of geniusesand devote her life to darning their socks.) As I don’t particularly want toprovide Gertrude with further reasons for coming here, I overcame the temptationto introduce her to Kirsten. Gertrude then proposed that we go back to Hampsteadto supper. So we drove back—it was a pleasant evening, with a clear sky—and hadsupper at Gertrude’s. There was a constraint between us most of the time, and itdidn’t improve when Brother Robbins dropped in about ten o’clock. He glared atme, and Gertrude seemed to be apologetic. I wanted to go home, but she took measide and asked me to wait until he’d gone. But he showed no sign of going, andwhen it was time for my last bus home, I decided to leave. Gertrude lookedunhappy, but I went.A peculiar thing happened on my way home. I walked up Petticoat Lane, andstopped by the waste ground for a pee. While I stood there, a couple suddenlystood up from behind some stalls on the other side of the ground. From the wayshe was smoothing her dress, I imagine it had been around her waist. I walkedbehind them up the street. Then they passed under a lamp and I realized it wasDiana, with the flashily dressed individual I’d seen the other day. I feltrather sick about this—or I suppose the correct word is jealous. If she’s goingto have sex with other men, why can’t she go in for something more dignifiedthan a piece of waste ground? There’s always the park. I took a short cutthrough the back streets and got home before she did; I didn’t want to see her.Her husband was playing Schumann when I came in.Nov. 10. Have just returned from Bond Street where I found an art galleryexhibiting Oliver’s stuff. I went into town this afternoon to look aroundFoyle’s second-hand section, then thought I’d take a look at a book shop I knowin D’Arblay Street. In one of those back streets off Bond Street, I found asmall art gallery with a large notice: “Exhibition of Paintings by OliverGlasp.” I went in and inquired, but the man was very unhelpful. When I said Iwas a friend of Oliver’s, he only gave me a resentful glare, and said he wasn’tallowed to give any personal information about the artist. I was so irritatedthat I wanted to knock him down and stamp on his face—this kind of rudenessalways sends up my blood pressure—so I shrugged and went out. Perhaps he thoughtI only wanted to borrow money from Oliver. Anyway, I presume this means thatOliver’s back in town.The weird thing is that as I started to write this down, I suddenly recalledthat I had dreamed about Oliver last night, and I could swear that there wassomething about an exhibition in the dream. However, I suppose this iscoincidence, not a proof of Dunne’s serial time.5The exhibition, which apparently opened yesterday, was very impressive; most ofit seemed to be old stuff. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Oliver’spicture of Matthew Lovatt.6 The title in the catalogue only says: “Aself-crucifixion.”Strangely enough, as I got off the bus at the bottom of Commercial Street, I sawChristine walking on the other side of the road. I haven’t seen her for a longtime. So I ran over and caught up with her. She seems to have grown a lot sinceI last saw her. (I think she’s nearly thirteen.) I didn’t mention Oliver’sexhibition. I didn’t want to hurt her. I shall never understand why Oliver wasso shattered when he found out that Christine had slept with her cousin.(Incidentally, she told me that this cousin has just been sent to areformatory.)I gave Christine my address, and she says she’ll come and see me. But I somehowgot the impression that she doesn’t intend to.Nov. 11. Diana came up to talk to me last night, but I felt too irritated afterseeing her with the bookmaker type. She wanted to talk to me aboutKirsten—whether I think he couldn’t get someone to publish his music. I’m afraidI showed my annoyance, because after five minutes of lame conversation, sheleft.I have decided to sketch out a one-act opera libretto about Major Thomas Weir,whom I’ve found in Montague Summers. It will give me a chance to make it apsychological study too. Weir was apparently known in Edinburgh as aPresbyterian of unusual enthusiasm, a highly respected soldier, an uprightcitizen. Quite suddenly, in his seventies, he started confessing to witchcraft,to incest with his sister, bestiality, adultery, and various other offenses. Therespectable citizens to whom he confessed thought he was mad, and declined toact. But he was so persistent that they were forced to investigate. Finally,largely on Weir’s own accusations, he and his sister were burned for witchcraft.His house remained uninhabited for many years after, neighbors claiming thatthey heard strange noises and saw lights. Summers claims that one man who agreedto take the house was almost immediately driven out of it by the devil in theshape of a calf. However, Summers seems to be a wildly imaginative writer, whomanages to pack more inaccuracies into two paragraphs about Jack the Ripper thanmost people could get into twenty pages.The main charges against Weir were sexual. He slept with his sister Jane fromthe time she was sixteen until she was fifty (when he lost interest). He alsoslept with his stepdaughter and with several maidservants. He attempted to rapehis sister when she was ten. He made a habit of having intercourse with maresand cows; on one occasion, he was seen by a woman in the act of bestiality witha mare, but when she reported him, no one believed her, and she was whippedthrough the town for slander of such a holy man! Weir was burned alive in 1670.Even Summers, who seems to believe in witchcraft, makes very little attempt topresent Major Weir as a sorcerer, and admits that the major charges against himwere the sexual ones. Add to this that Weir refused to petition God for pardon,claiming that he was certain he was damned. All this, I think, indicates a caseof overwhelming sexual guilt. Weir was obviously a man of intense sexualdesires, born into a community where sex was regarded as sinful. The onlyparallel I can think of was the case of Peter Kürten, the Dusseldorf killer.Kürten also attempted to rape his sister when he was very young, and committedbestiality. I suspect that when sexual desire reaches this kind of intensity, itturns automatically to sadism.So we have a picture of young Thomas Weir, born into a family of respectablePresbyterians about 1600, and later fighting with the Puritan army and beingmade commander of the forces in Edinburgh—a post that he owed to his reputationfor piety as much as to his prowess as a soldier. But from a very early age, heis obsessed by sex; it haunts him all the time, so that there is hardly a momentof any day when he is not aware of an urgency in his loins. When his sister is16, he succeeds in having intercourse with her. This could hardly be calledrape, because if she had really objected, she had only to complain to herparents. But Weir also lives in a country where religion has assumedparticularly nasty forms of superstition. He believes in the devil, naturally.But as he walks through the streets of Edinburgh, he is continually aware of adesire to grab every attractive girl he sees and heave her skirts over her head.This sense of strange forces working inside him must have convinced him that hewas close to the devil. I take his bestiality to be a further corroboration ofthis idea. After all, what man in his right senses wants to have intercoursewith a horse or cow? A moronic farm hand in a country district might do it outof frustration, or a shepherd who sees no one but his sheep for weeks at a time.But for most people, the idea would be as unattractive as eating the cow’sdinner. Only a sense that it was wicked and forbidden could possibly stimulate aman’s appetite to overcome his normal revulsion—particularly if there were womenavailable, as apparently there always were for Weir (if only his sister).It seems peculiar, but the idea of the forbidden has the power of channelizingand concentrating the sexual desires. In Thomas Mann, for example, there is anobvious obsession with incest between brother and sister; it appears in Blood ofthe Walsungs and again in The Holy Sinner. But why? Only because it is supposedto be forbidden. Imagine a country where it is regarded as highly moral to keepsex within the family, but horribly daring to touch someone else’s sister! Thisis surely more like common sense? For after all, our own flesh does not exciteus; therefore, someone else’s sister is far more strange. Why do we take onlythe most casual interest in a girl dressed in a bikini, yet feel a tremendoustwinge of lust if we happened to see the same girl in her panties and bra,although these may conceal far more than the beach clothes? It is this curiousfocusing power of the forbidden. So you get a fool like Baudelaire claiming thatthe element of sin must be kept in sex. To me, this is only to say that hebelieves sex to be entirely an illusion, and that the illusion should bepreserved or even intensified. I’m not sure. There’s a strong streak of originalRousseau in me. I can’t help feeling that if the climate was temperate enoughfor us all to live as nudists, and if we were as promiscuous and as frank as theSouth Sea Islanders, we’d discover that the sexual impulse doesn’t needintensifying by guilt and sin.Anyway, to return to Major Weir. I imagine his final confession was almost agesture of disgust with life, like suicide—a self-divided life when he couldnever feel completely at one with himself because he never felt he had a rightto inner peace. And yet I cannot agree with Summers when he says that Weir was amonstrous hypocrite who used his acting abilities to deceive everybody. Weirdidn’t have to be thought more pious than anybody else; he didn’t have to prayso fervently that people would come for miles to hear him extemporize. Plainly,he had a genuine talent for this kind of thing, for praying and talking aboutreligion. He was an oversexed man; but in a less superficial culture, he mightalso have become a saint, since he possessed strong religious feelings as wellas strong sexual urges. If he could have been franker about them, got into thehabit of letting other people—if only a priest—know about them, he might havedared to allow his “opposing selves” to wrestle openly. He was like a frightenedold maid who keeps her dog and cat in separate rooms because she is afraidthey’ll fight and disturb the other tenants; but in consequence, the dog and catnever have a chance to get used to one another.I wonder ... If we could finally destroy the idea of guilt in connection withsex—if we could be completely open about our sexual desires—if the result mightnot be to release some of our mental blocks, hidden powers? When I think ofthose sexual infernos that seem the common experience of all teen-age boys, I’msurprised that far more girls don’t get raped. This I take to be the realproblem with Oliver and this child Christine. I doubt whether Oliver has had anysexual experience. He naturally has a masochistic tendency. Then he meetsChristine, a girl who doesn’t frighten or worry him. (I remember how awkward hewas when he met Caroline—didn’t seem to know where to put his feet and hands.)In fact, she obviously thinks he’s something extraordinary. Unfortunately, sheisn’t suitable for romance, being only thirteen. Nevertheless, he is lonely, andallows her to touch dormant sexual feelings. Then she poses for him with nothingon, and the situation comes dangerously close to the explosion point. He won’tadmit to himself that what he really wants is to take a sweet girl of aboutsixteen to bed; Christine is just a substitute for this. Heavens knows how longit would have taken before he would have admitted that he wanted her in everysense, but before he can reach that stage, just while he is trying to hide fromhimself that he is sexually stimulated by her, he suddenly learns that she isnot, in fact, a virgin. Most people wouldn’t have felt particularly surprised bythis. After all, in her kind of family, where several children often sleep inthe same bed, and the facts of life are no secret from the age of five,precocious sexual experience isn’t so unusual; neither does it necessarily domuch harm. No doubt Christine was perfectly sincere when she said that hercousin had practically raped her, and that she hated him for it. () So why, under the circumstances, does Oliver go half insane and rush off tothe other end of England, refusing to see the poor child again? Why on earthcouldn’t he be frank with himself, admit that he’d like to have sexualintercourse with her, but that at her age it would be impracticable?How can we talk of sin and guilt, the world being what it is? The world is aconfidence trickster—that is, it is careful not to allow its reality to appearto us. And what is its reality? This is the question I devote my whole life tostudying. And yet I think I have more idea of the answer now than a year ago.Usually I feel almost nonexistent, as if I wouldn’t even cast a shadow in thesunlight, like Chamisso’s Peter Schlemihl or the man in Hoffmann’s story. Yet Iam learning to cast a shadow.Nov. 12. It is the safe of meaning that I’ve got to crack, and I need a greatdeal more training in burglary. I’ve spent today like an absolute fool, staringout of my window, drinking tea, trying to read Huysmans’ Là-bas and not beingable to work up much interest in it. God this awful freedom. What are we to do?I spend my life trying to free myself from my conditioning, only to face thisterrible lack of motive. Huysmans keeps asking why Gilles de Rais became asadist and “ripper of children.” He didn’t understand that the desert of freedomis his answer. When a man has too much freedom, too many privileges, he becomesan utter fool. What could you expect from the richest baron in France? We allhave an absurd compulsion to keep looking forward to things. We’re incapable ofsitting still. We have no will. We have to be driven on up the evolutionaryscale, destiny sitting behind us and sticking a pointed stick up our arses.The male confronts his boredom with a need to conquer, to penetrate, to achieveecstasy by a kind of aggression. The female reacts to freedom with the cry: Comeand penetrate me. Bring me ecstasy and sensation. But what training had a manlike Gilles for freedom? A darling of destiny, flattered by the king andcourtiers, a marshal of France in his twenties, the comrade-in-arms of Joan ofArc. The sadism follows naturally. Since the Life Force has turned sex into anact of aggression, has made us respond with desire to the notion of violatinganother’s privacy with an erect penis, is it not inevitable that the sexualexplorer looks around for new taboos to violate? Therefore, in some ways, thesex maniac must be regarded as admirable. The Life Force is like a stupid king,who drives his subjects to doing his will by forcing them to obey brutal morons.If a few of the subjects have the courage to revolt, so much the better forthem. The Life Force appears to be incredibly stupid. It persuades us toperpetuate the species by implanting in us a kind of criminal impulse—for is notthe desire to enter another’s body similar to the desire to break into someone’shouse? When we were at school, we used to repeat a rhyme that went:> It’s only human nature after all> > To take a pretty girl behind a wall,> > To pull down her protection> > And to shove in your connection,> > It’s only human nature after all.But note here the words “her protection,” and its suggestion of leaving the girlhelpless. (Presumably if she goes with you behind a wall, she is quite willingto have sex, so why the imagery of violating her?) Why? Because this is therather clumsy device the Life Force has hit upon to stimulate man to take uponhimself the boredom of fatherhood. Then, having planted in us this preposterousconditioned reflex, it relies on our timidity and cowardice to ensure that thechildren who get brought into the world have homes and families. A man who isfree of this timidity will therefore go ahead and rape. The only reason hecannot be excused is that the stupidity of the Life Force doesn’t justify us indoing the opposite. The means employed may be clumsy and silly, but the aim isvalid. It is rather like a bad teacher who treats intelligent pupils as if theywere small children, and irritates them by talking down to them; all the same,she has something to teach, no matter how unfortunate her manner. In the sameway, life seems to rely on our timidity and need for security to keep us fromwrecking society. Therefore a man who chooses to be a criminal might beadmirable in the same way as the sex maniac. But the same objection applies tohim.Nov. 15. A hectic 24 hours. First of all, Carlotta came yesterday afternoon tobring me a letter. It turned out to be a note from Oliver, asking me to go andsee his exhibition, and giving an address in the Hackney Road. Carlotta was inone of her teasing moods—turned away her mouth when I tried to kiss her (just afraternal greeting!), then sat around on the bed showing her pants but behavingwith the gravity of an alder-man, and forbidding any passes. This was just aswell. If she’d realized how easy it is to get hooks into me, she’d have strippedand got into bed immediately. Because I’m pretty certain that’s what she had inmind. However, she succeeds in driving me into a state of suppressed irritationthat has the effect of turning me into a monk. After ten minutes, it was obviousthat this particular patch of human relations had got all snarled up, so Ioffered to take her out for a meal. She said she’d eaten. So I made the onlyother suggestion I could think of—that we go and call on Oliver. I didn’tparticularly want to do this: I know he hates strangers. But we went all thesame.Oliver’s address is only a twenty-minute walk from here. We arrived at half pastfive, and found the door, but couldn’t get any reply. So we went and had tea inthe café opposite. Carlotta was being an absolute bitch—I don’t know why shecame to see me in such a mood—but I didn’t really care, because I felt she wasgiving me an excuse for avoiding her in future. Kept saying she wished she wasback in Germany, how she hated England, what swine Englishmen were, etc. Lookingat her, I thought of that time she fell off the ladder, and my excitement, andthought what a damned swindle it is.Then I looked up, and who should be walking into the place but Oliver. I calledto him and went over. He looked older than the last time I saw him—he actuallyhad some gray in his hair—and his face looked more skull-like than ever. Yet Ithink he looked happier than he did a year ago—there was no longer the samesense of strain hanging about him. I believe this must be the result of hissuccess. He stoops just as much, has the same red stubble on his chin, and wearswhat appears to be the same paint-stained turtleneck sweater. His manner is alsoas abrupt and ungracious as ever—particularly with Carlotta.As we went upstairs with him, he said: “I want to introduce you to a remarkableman.” We went up to the third floor—up well-carpeted stairs (the house isseveral cuts above anything he’s lived in before)—and into a room. Oliver said:“This is Caradoc Cunningham.” And the man who came forward to shake hands wasthe big, bald-headed man I’d seen in the library a week ago. I was staggered.Cunningham saw that I looked astounded, and said: “Haven’t we met somewherebefore?” As I didn’t want to bring up the library episode, I said I didn’t thinkso. But afterwards, as we talked, I noticed that he kept glancing at me in acurious manner, as if trying to place me.My first impressions of Cunningham in the library are verified; he is certainlyone of the strangest men I have ever met. On the surface, he is something of anactor—big, rather fat, very tall, an almost hypnotic stare from eyes that seemto be round. I suspect that he deliberately cultivates a way of making his eyesbulge slightly to intensify this impression of will power. He has something ofan actor’s voice, with a faint lisp, and a booming way of talking. He also hasvarious habits, like dropping his voice and narrowing his eyes when he sayscertain things, to give himself a sinister appearance. Altogether, the firstimpression he made on me was a bad one—of a charlatan, a man withoutself-discipline. But after ten minutes’ conversation, this impression vanishescompletely, and he seems to emanate a definite and rather sinister strength.There can be no doubt that his culture is very wide indeed, but it isn’t used—asa charlatan would use it—to impress. For example, we started discussingPlotinus, and he began to quote Plotinus in Greek. I said impatiently that Ididn’t know Greek; he immediately dropped it, and didn’t again revert to it.Finally, he said to me: “Look here, won’t you tell me where I’ve seen you?”Oliver said jokingly: “I thought your memory was infallible.” “Not my memory,”Cunningham said, “My insight.” He closed his eyes, placed his hand on hisforehead, and said: “Egypt, Athens ... Alexandria.” He opened his eyes, andlooked at me in a puzzled way, repeating, “Alexandria.” Then suddenly he lookedpleased. “Alexandria, library! Of course!” He looked at me cunningly. “Yes, nowit all comes back to me. You were sitting in the corner.” I was disappointed inhim. I was certain that he had recalled where he had seen me about ten minutesbefore, and had deliberately staged this little exhibition of thought-reading(or whatever it was supposed to be). And yet before the evening was out, I wasconvinced that I had done him an injustice. I will explain why in a moment.Oliver tells me that he met Cunningham in the Lake District, where he wasshowing two rich young men the rudiments of mountain climbing on the east sideof Helvellyn. (One of them nearly broke his neck, and went home ratherhurriedly.) Cunningham liked Oliver’s work, and offered to get him anexhibition. I don’t know how he talked Oliver into it. However, the results seemto have been excellent; Cunningham showed me some of the notices, which weresplendid, comparing Oliver to Münch, Vlaminck, Soutine and God knows who else.Oliver’s admiration for Cunningham is obvious. This is curious to see. Olivernaturally has a suspicious nature; I’d like to know how Cunningham won him overso completely. One more thing is obvious: Cunningham is using Oliver to makehimself money. From something Oliver said, I gather that Oliver hasn’t yet seenmuch of the cash from his pictures. And yet I am fairly sure Cunningham is noordinary confidence swindler.There was one curious episode that I find difficult to account for. Afterintroducing me to Cunningham, Oliver said he wanted to go down to his studio(which is apparently on the floor below). Cunningham gave Carlotta a very longand quite unambiguous glance; he was obviously stripping her mentally. Carlottabridled at this, and he grinned sarcastically. Cunningham then began to tell usthat he had just returned from some mountain climbing expedition in Tibet, andtalked about Tibetan Buddhism. It always irritates me to be lectured to on asubject I already know fairly well, so I lost no time in letting him see that hewasn’t telling me anything new. He then went on to Tibetan magic; but as I’djust finished reading a book on the subject, I was able to checkmate him heretoo. (I derive an absurd and rather discreditable pleasure from these stupidepisodes of one-upmanship.) At this, he became very friendly, “as between twobrother adepts,” and turned on all the charm and flattery. At this point, hesuggested that we should have a drink, but after rummaging in a cupboard, couldproduce only half an inch of whisky. I had noticed a wine shop close by, so Ioffered to go down and get a bottle of wine. Cunningham insisted on paying, andhanded me a £5 note—but made no attempt to go himself! This is somehow typicalof him—he does everything with a kind of affected princeliness. He said toCarlotta: “You can stay; he won’t be a moment,” but she jumped to her feet andsaid that she couldn’t trust me to buy decent wine! As soon as we were outside,she said: “I can’t bear that man. He exudes the nastiest kind of sex.” I pressedher to explain what she meant, and she claimed that, all the time he had beentalking to me, she had felt an unpleasant sensation, as if she were naked, andhe was running his hands very lightly over her. I said that I should havethought this might be pleasant, but she said it was no more pleasant than havingfrogs walking over you. We bought the wine—a fairly good Beaune—and returned tothe room. Cunningham said we would have to warm it, and stood it in front of thefire. I wanted to go down to the bathroom, which is on the floor below, and heasked me to knock on Oliver’s door and tell him there was wine. I did this, andOliver immediately asked me: “What do you think of him?” I said that I wasn’tyet sure whether he was a charlatan or a man of remarkable talent, and Oliversaid excitedly: “That’s how I felt when I first met him. But he has amazingpowers—quite unusual.” I pressed him to tell me what they were—thinking of thelibrary episode—but he said that Cunningham would probably show them to me whenhe was ready. I decided to go back up again, remembering Carlotta’s feelingabout Cunningham, so I left Oliver to come up when he felt inclined. When Iwalked back into the room, I was amazed to see Cunningham bending over Carlotta,apparently kissing her, with one hand quite definitely up her skirt. As I openedthe door, he straightened up very casually and started pouring the wine. Ididn’t like to look at Carlotta—she was embarrassed; so I went past her to lookout of the window; but as I passed her, I glanced down at her, and to myastonishment saw teeth marks on her neck. Cunningham is certainly the fastestworker I’ve ever met!As we drank, Cunningham turned the conversation to the subject of Satanism. Imade it fairly plain from my manner that I thought it a lot of nonsense. Heasked me very smoothly how it was possible for a man of my obvious breadth andculture to take such a poor-spirited view. As by that time I’d had severalglasses of wine (I had bought three bottles) and was feeling talkative, I triedto explain to him my true position: that 19th-century materialism is shallownonsense, because although it acknowledged that 90 per cent of the world is amystery to us, it still insisted that the world is pointless and purposeless, amatter of chance and blind physical laws. I said I was convinced that the worldwas made up largely of unseen forces—but that no amount of magical mumbo-jumbowould place us in contact with them.At this, Cunningham seized my phrase “unseen forces” and became very excited. Heasked me if I wasn’t admitting that there are probably intelligences in theuniverse that are superior to our own. I admitted grudgingly that this waslikely, but that I would have to define what I meant more precisely. But therewas no stopping him now; he said that although it was probable that all themagic and alchemy of the Middle Ages was nonsense, this still did not mean thatan educated modern man might not learn to tap the “unseen forces.”At this point Oliver came up, and we continued the argument in front of him.Suddenly, Oliver said: “Why don’t you give him a demonstration?” Cunninghamsaid: “Very well, I will.” He then produced a pack of Tarot cards, all of themcircular, and handed them to me. He told me to sit with my back to him, take onecard at a time, stare at it, and concentrate on it. I did as he told me, withCarlotta standing beside me, and Cunningham on the other side of the room. Itook one—a picture of a man hanging by his foot—and concentrated. Almostimmediately, Cunningham said: “The Hanging Man,” and described the card in myhand. I tried three more. The first two, The Juggler and the Nine of Pentacles,he got immediately. The third one—Three of Wands—he got wrong, saying it was thedevil. He also got the next one wrong—it was The Pope, and he said it wasJustice. At this point, he claimed that something was interfering with thetransference—probably Carlotta being present, he thought—and suggested that wego down into the street.Here, he showed either a remarkable ability at guesswork, or some kind of secondsight. We walked down to a small side street, which he entered, telling me tostand on the corner and look along the Hackney Road. It was about half past six,and there were a great many people about. Cunningham told me to look at thepeople who approached along the pavement, and think hard about them. He himselfstood about five yards from the corner—it was a blank brick wall—and closed hiseyes. He then started to tell me who was approaching: “Two men, walking side byside, and an old woman. Now there is a young girl further away, and a child—Ican’t tell whether it’s a boy or a girl.” On the whole, what he said wasaccurate, but I couldn’t tell whether it was simply guesswork, or whether hemight have been helped out by some reflections in a window on the other side ofthe street. For example, there were two men approaching, more or less side byside, but they were obviously not together. There was also an old woman, furtherback, and there was a child in the distance. On the other hand, there wereseveral other people between the old woman and the child, and he didn’t mentionthese. At one point, he said: “There is a policeman approaching.” I could see nopoliceman, but a moment later, a uniformed man came out of a shop only a fewyards along the pavement, who might easily have been mistaken for a policeman ifyou looked at him casually. (He was actually some kind of a foreign navalofficer.) As he became visible, Cunningham remarked: “Ah, his uniform misledme.” On the other hand, if Cunningham was really reading my mind, then he hadspoken about the officer before I actually saw him.Oliver and Carlotta were standing nearby as all this went on, and were obviouslyboth much impressed. But I couldn’t help feeling that this proved very little.If Cunningham had drawn a chalk mark on the pavement and then said: “An old manis now crossing that mark,” I might have agreed that he had second sight. But ina crowded street, it isn’t difficult to make good guesses if you don’t specifyhow close the people are supposed to be.We went back up, and Cunningham promised another demonstration later if he feltlike it. Carlotta hung behind with me, as Cunningham and Oliver went on ahead,and said: “I feel so ashamed of myself. But I think that man is really amagician ... At this moment, Cunningham turned round and grinned at us in a mostknowing manner, and Carlotta immediately shut up, as if he knew what she wassaying.After spending an evening with Cunningham and Oliver, there is no doubt in mymind that he’s a most remarkable man—although I still can’t decide how far he issimply an actor. He seems to be a great boaster, and talked casually about ayacht he sank off the coast of Africa, about mountain climbing records he hasbroken, about another magician whom he killed in a “magical battle” when he wasin Marseilles and the other magician was in Paris. He told us all this in anearby restaurant where we ate a pleasant meal, and since he had insisted thatwe were his guests, I didn’t feel inclined to contradict him. There can be nodoubt whatever about the man’s generosity. When Carlotta said that she wanted toleave her present job, but couldn’t afford to spend several weeks searching foranother, he immediately offered to give her enough money to support herself, andoffered her ten pounds on the spot! Carlotta, I’m glad to say, refused. (If sheleft Kentish Town, I’m afraid she’d spend most of her time at my place. Atpresent it’s too far for more than occasional visits.)Cunningham paid me a flattering amount of attention—rather to Oliver’sannoyance, I thought, although Oliver was also fairly obviously pleased to beable to show both myself and Cunningham that he had intelligent friends. Beforethe evening was over, I was pretty drunk; Cunningham, although I know he musthave drunk at least three bottles of wine by himself, seemed relativelyunaffected.We left the restaurant at about ten, and walked back towards my place. I askedthem if they’d like to come in for a drink, and they agreed. Then Cunninghamagreed to try another demonstration of his “magic.” This one was ratherremarkable. He made us wait in a side turning, while he stood in the middle ofthe pavement, apparently looking in a shop window. There were a great manypeople around. An oldish man came along—looked like a senior clerk in a bank—andCunningham turned round, and walked close behind him. The man was apparentlyunaware that he was being followed. Cunningham fell into step with him, and gotcloser and closer. We all walked along just behind Cunningham, who, by thistime, was only about six inches behind the man, but in such perfect step thatthey didn’t touch each other. Suddenly, Cunningham allowed his knees to buckleunder him, and almost fell to the pavement. At the same moment, the old man,although apparently untouched, also stumbled, and almost fell. Cunningham caughthim and said he hoped he was all right. The old boy seemed rather dazed, lookedat the pavement, as if to see what he’d stumbled over, and muttered that he feltall right. Cunningham watched him walking away, and said: “You see, I didn’ttouch him, did I?” I had to admit that, although I couldn’t actually see whetherCunningham had touched him, the old man would probably have said so.As we walked down towards my place, I told Cunningham and Oliver about my insanemusician. He showed little interest until I told him about Kirsten’s“invention,” the organ.Then he asked me several questions, and when I said I knew nothing about it,said he’d like to meet Kirsten. So when we got in, we banged on Kirsten’s door;oddly enough, he was out.In my room, we opened another bottle of wine, and got into a rambling argument.Cunningham irritated me by explaining that he believes in total freedom—Blake’s“Do what you will.” I said I thought this was totally meaningless, and appealedto Oliver. To my surprise, Oliver said he agreed with Cunningham, and that hethought the chief problem is that too many people live as if they have no willpower. He also said that he couldn’t see why I disagreed, since I was so fond ofquoting Mr. Polly’s “If you don’t like your life you can change it.” At this, Itried to explain to them, as briefly as I could, exactly what I feel about humanbeings: that the trouble with men is not merely that they have no absolutestandards built into them, but that they have almost no consistent standards atall. A nihilist or a hedonist can take this as an excuse to live for the moment.But the fact remains that, in a limited, animal kind of way, we do havepermanent values. Even the most despairing nihilist will jump up if he sits on apin. If we read a case of murder that is particularly silly and pointless, wefeel that the murderer has somehow wasted his own life and that of the victim.Well, if we have a concept of “waste” inbuilt in us, then we must also have aconcept of purpose. The real problem, I said, is the diffuseness of humanconsciousness. If only it could be concentrated—if only we could discover thesecret mechanism in the unconscious that makes it narrow and focus—we couldeasily become gods. But “Doing what you will” isn’t likely to help at all; onthe contrary, it’s likely to destroy self-discipline and diffuse theconsciousness still more. I gave Aleister Crowley7 as an example of this kind ofthing. But it turned out that Crowley had been a close friend of Cunningham’s(as if I couldn’t have guessed) and Cunningham immediately launched into adefense of him.Still, we got something good out of the discussion finally. I mentioned that thesexual orgasm has this power to narrow and concentrate the beam ofconsciousness, but that it appears to be done by some trigger-mechanism. No onewho experiences an orgasm, and then tries later to produce the same intensity ofconcentration by ordinary will power, can deny that there must exist in thehuman mind some kind of a switch that can intensify the consciousness; a fewmen—like Sri Ramakrishna—learn the secret of this switch, and can plunge into astate of ecstasy at a moment’s notice. But most of us never learn where it issituated, and have to rely on the sexual orgasm, or perhaps on the power ofmusic, to re-produce it.Cunningham now became very mysterious, and hinted that he had another means ofproducing this intensification of consciousness. Being rather drunk, I was in nomood to be polite, so I said I didn’t believe anybody had such a secret—even ifhe could see around corners. My scepticism seemed to annoy him, and he declaredthat he had discovered the secret by means of “sexual magic”—various trickstaught him by Crowley. Crowley, he claimed, had introduced a completely new formof yogic discipline that involved all kinds of sexual practices. In its earlystages, the devotee has to practice masturbation, and try to understand the wayin which his “intensifying faculty” works. Cunningham likened a man having anorgasm to a man who suddenly sees a landscape below him, lit by a flash oflightning. If he sees the landscape often enough, and diligently tries to makemaps every time he sees it, he will eventually begin to gain a real familiaritywith it. Most human beings, he said, accept the pleasure of the orgasm withouttrying to analyze it. The devotee of “sexual magic” keeps his attention awakeand concentrated while receiving sexual pleasure, and strives to develop a kindof phenomenology of sex. He used a rather good image. He said that we all findourselves in this more or less dark and meaningless universe, but that eachsexual orgasm is like a flare that can help us find our bearings. Unfortunately,even if a man had two orgasms a day, this still wouldn’t mean that he can reckonon more than about thirty thousand orgasms in a lifetime. Thirty thousand flaressounds a lot—enough to explore any landscape—but it is really totallyinadequate. For example, by the age of 25, most men have had at least fivethousand orgasms. Yet how many of us can say that we understand life or sex anybetter after the five thousandth time? Life slips through our fingers; we learnnothing of its meaning and purpose, even though each orgasm gives us anoverwhelming sense that it has meaning and purpose. Every work of art, everypoem, every symphony ever written, is an attempt to try to prevent life fromslipping away. And yet, with millions of books in the world, we still know aslittle about the meaning of life as the earliest human beings.At this point, I heard the Kirstens come in downstairs, and Cunningham insistedthat I ask them up. I went downstairs (feeling very drunk and very sleepy) andknocked on their door. They had apparently been out to a cinema, but they werealso tired, and said they didn’t want to have a drink. However, I persuaded themto come and meet Cunningham. I immediately felt sorry I had, because Cunninghamtook one look at Diana, and obviously formed ambitions of practicing sexualmagic on her. And she was like a rabbit with a snake. Kirsten seemed to noticenothing. He protested he was tired, and finally accepted a small glass of wine.Cunningham tried to draw him into our discussion by recapitulating what he’dsaid about music as an attempt to stop life from slipping through the fingers,but it was no good; Kirsten refused to be drawn. However, Cunningham proceededto flatter him in the manner I now recognized, having had it practiced on me;said that he’d heard from me about Kirsten’s music, about his magnificentplaying, about his intelligence, etc., etc., and that he couldn’t wait for achance to verify all this for himself. Finally, Kirsten said that he’d be gladto see Cunningham some other time, but that at present he couldn’t keep his eyesopen. He then went off to bed, leaving Diana with us. Cunningham immediatelybegan to question her about her husband’s invention; but either she knew nothingabout it, or wasn’t willing to talk. However, she invited Cunningham to call thefollowing evening (today). Then, to my surprise, Cunningham said that he wastired too, and would go home. I had expected him to talk until five in themorning (and I’m sure he meant to before Kirsten came in—I suspect he has somereason for holding himself back—perhaps he wants to “save himself’ for thisevening). Cunningham also got Carlotta to go with him on some flimsyexcuse—saying he thought his next-door neighbor would drive her home in a car.(It was now too late for the tubes.) So they went, at about midnight, andCunningham borrowed the first half of my Methods and Techniques ofSelf-Deception. I have no doubt that Carlotta was instructed in the finer pointsof sexual magic. I didn’t mind—I was glad Cunningham took her with him. (But shelooked oddly frightened, as if she expected to be chewed up and swallowed.)Diana went with them, and I immediately opened a window to let out the cigarettesmoke, and climbed into bed. A few minutes later, Diana came back into the room,without knocking. She immediately asked me about Cunningham, and if I thought hecould be of use to her husband. I said that he probably could, and told herabout Oliver’s exhibition; but then, being in a bad mood (or perhaps onlyjealous) I added that I thought Cunningham had been rather struck by her. Shestartled me by her frankness; she said she felt this as soon as she came in, andthat it repelled her. I was curious, after the experience that Carlottamentioned, and pressed her to elaborate. She said that she had felt a kind ofsexual blow, just here (she indicated her solar plexus). But she hadn’t hadCarlotta’s experience of feeling undressed in front of him—perhaps because hisattention was elsewhere.I must have been pretty drunk, because I asked her bluntly if she’d sleep withCunningham if it could help her husband. She looked offended, said I had noright to speak to her like that, and started to leave the room. So I thenmentioned that I’d walked behind her up Petticoat Lane the other night, and seenher with her bookmaker type. At this, she blushed, but tried to put a bold faceon it, and said that she didn’t think this was any concern of mine either. Ifelt the time for frankness had arrived, and said that it only concerned mebecause I found her so attractive myself, and hated to think of other men havingher. She said very primly that no other man had “had her”; but it was obviousthat she wasn’t annoyed any more. I even persuaded her to sit on the edge of thebed, and managed to take her hand. I said that if I wanted to pry into herrelations with other men, it was quite straightforward jealousy. She said that Iwas obviously drunk; but for all that, she seemed disposed to be frank, and saidthat sometimes, living with a man like her husband was worse than living alone.His ideas were all very “noble,” and she respected him as a great man, but shecould never feel that she was essential to him. The bookmaking type, whose name,apparently, is Tom Drage, wanted to marry her when she was in her teens, and hadcome to live in the East End to be near her. She isn’t even sure of hisprofession (she thinks he’s an auctioneer), but says that he’s generous andgood-hearted. I said I appreciated all this, but that I couldn’t be expected toapprove of him much, since I wanted her myself. She said she’d have to go or herhusband would wonder what was happening; I held both her hands and tried topersuade her to kiss me good night. She wouldn’t, but didn’t seem annoyed. WhenI let her go, she turned out the bedside lamp, then laid her hand on my foreheadfor a moment before she went out. As she stood in the doorway, I asked her topromise that she wouldn’t go to bed with Cunningham; she said: “I promise,” thenclosed the door. I felt that this was a long step forward, but went off to sleepin a state of frustration. Probably Kirsten was already fast asleep when sheclimbed into his bed. If she’d climbed into mine, I wouldn’t have slept forseveral hours. This morning I felt very ashamed of myself—I must have beendrunker than I realized.Later. I thought I’d seen Cunningham’s name on book jackets some time, so thisafternoon I went to the British Museum to look him up. Sure enough, there areabout ten volumes by him in the catalogue, mostly verse. I got them all out, andspent a couple of hours with them. He’s an atrocious poet, who seems to possessno sensitivity to language, and shows no sign of having read anything later thanColeridge, except possibly Swinburne. There’s a great deal of rather juvenileblasphemy, deriding of the church and religion in general, praise of whores, andall the other fin de siècle paraphernalia. It seems to me that he must be inreaction against an incredibly old-fashioned family who kept him firmlysuppressed. But to me—and I haven’t been to church more than 20 times in mylife—all this is a fantastic waste of breath. Cunningham has this comment in oneof his books: “Some people accuse me of flogging dead horses, but I can think ofmore interesting things to do with dead horses.” (I think he’s invented a newperversion there.) But flogging dead horses is exactly what he does for 90 percent of the time in these books of his. There are, admittedly, a few pleasantlyrics. There was also a book of magic, purporting to be a translation from“Abrahamelin the Mage.”It’s curious that a man can be as personally impressive as Cunningham, and yetbe so obviously a show-off on paper.Nov. 16. I was interrupted yesterday by the arrival of Christine, who wanted totell me that she’d seen a picture of Oliver in a newspaper. I felt badly aboutthis—I didn’t want to have to admit that I knew Oliver to be in town. So Iinsisted on going out and buying some iced cakes while Christine made tea, andtalked to her about other things, and generally did my best to make her feel“wanted.” This, I think, is the root of the problem; it’s not that she caresparticularly about Oliver, but that she feels that a man she liked and respectedsuddenly turned on her and threw her out. My difficulty is that I can’t reallycomfort her without telling her that Oliver isn’t as “solid” as she thought him.I can understand her position. I gather that her family are a completely crazylot, always having fights and getting drunk. Her father’s a prison warder—andexactly the kind of stupid brute you’d expect to take a job like that—and one ofher brothers has already got himself into serious trouble with the police and ison probation; her sister is married to a Pole who beats her up, and she comesand sleeps with Christine when her husband’s in a murderous mood. But she’s adecent little kid, and she needs a better sort of environment, and the feelingthat people take an interest in her. Oliver gave her a sense of security for awhile, and the kind of attention she needs, and then quite abruptly withdrew it.Naturally she’s upset; she feels it’s something wrong with her. But how can Itell her that Oliver was probably projecting into her something that didn’texist—a kind of primal childish innocence—a combination of wife, daughter, angeland good fairy?While we were having tea, and I was explaining to her about the pictures ofdemons in the Tibetan Book of the Dead there was a knock on the door, andCunningham arrived. He has quite a way with children. It was curious to see himchattering to Christine, and then to think about his blasphemous poems and allhis talk about sex magic. He was like a clever older brother. What’s more, heseems to understand her psychology better than I do. He suddenly asked her:“Would you like me to tell you a story?” She said “Ooh yes,” and he immediatelylaunched into a fairy story about a giant and a dwarf who went into partnershipto free a country of dragons. I would have assumed she’d feel herself too oldfor this kind of thing, but she listened with a fascinated stare, and didn’tbreathe until half an hour later. When she finally said she had to go home, hebent over and kissed her, then gave her half a crown, for all the world like aSanta Claus in some big store at Christmas. I found this an unexpected and mostlikable side to his character. In fact I felt so warm about him that I told himI’d been reading his poetry, and was hypocritically complimentary about it. Thisdelighted him—it was evident that I’d touched his amour-propre—and heimmediately launched into extravagant praise of himself as a poet. I commentedon his being born near Leamington, and he said: “Yes, I have often thought itstrange that Warwickshire should have produced England’s two greatest poets—forwe must not forget Shakespeare.”He hadn’t been in the room for five minutes before he declared he needed adrink. As I had nothing in the room but a foul Spanish burgundy, he sent me outfor some decent wine. (I didn’t mind playing errand boy—he was paying.) He stoodthis in hot water to take off the chill, and we drank for nearly an hour. He hadsome interesting things to tell me. When he began to boast to me about hissexual prowess, I tried to jar him by asking him bluntly how he’d obtained sucha hold over Oliver. He startled me by replying: “By saving him from suicide.” Heclaimed that he was in the Preston Art Gallery, looking at a painting by Oliver,when he had a sudden overwhelming intimation that the artist was in danger. Hewas so urgent that the authorities of the gallery gave him the address. He tooka taxi there, announced to the landlady that he was an old friend of Mr. Glasp,and rushed up to the room she indicated. Without even knocking, he tried thedoor, found it locked, and burst it open with his shoulder. Oliver was asleep,and looked amazed as his door burst open. Cunningham said he thrust out a fingerat him and said: “You are not to do it. I have been sent to stop you.” He claimsthat Oliver’s immediate reaction was to collapse, and then to admit that he hadbeen steeling himself all day to the idea of cutting his throat, and had justthat minute decided that he would walk into the bathroom and do it.I have no idea at all whether Cunningham invented this story, partly or wholly.All his stories about himself and other people are somehow so much “incharacter” with the way he sees things that he might almost be accused of beinga novelist who invents his life in the act of living it.And yet how otherwise can I explain the influence he possesses over Oliver? Hetold me that he made Oliver go out with him to an Indian restaurant, where heforced him to eat huge quantities of very hot food, washed down with wine.Oliver was so awe-stricken by this “messenger from God” that he did whatever hewas told. Cunningham talked at him for two hours, and ended by getting him tosign a paper agreeing to let him arrange an exhibition at a London gallery anddeal with the whole financial side of the venture.I asked Cunningham what arguments he used to bring this about. “I didn’t argue.I just staggered him with my insight into his condition. I told him that he feltas if he were sliding down a slope, but that he could arrest his motion at anymoment.” Cunningham now became very confiding and philosophical, but what hesaid excited me immensely. It went deeper than anything he’d said in his books,and made me wonder if he really does possess strange powers. He talked for morethan half an hour, but what he said, in summary, was this: We all reactimmediately to pain and discomfort by struggling to be free of it. But thestrangest thing about human beings is that when this negative stimulus comes toan end, they immediately devalue life by slipping back into boredom. Therefore,the “divine forces” (he either used this term, or simply “the Powers”) have madestimulation-by-misery the secret of their method of driving men to become gods.The greatest sin is the attempt to escape this “goad” of the Powers by sinkinginto apathy. Men who have no reason whatever to fear pain or discomfortsometimes commit suicide from boredom.There is only one way to escape the “goad” of misery. Not the Buddhist’s perfectdetachment, which is nonsense. Simpler than that. To go in the direction inwhich Fate is trying to goad you at such a speed that it can’t catch up.This was the essence of what he said, but he used a hundred illustrations (and Iinterrupted him to supply some of my own). He talked as if he were receivinginspiration (perhaps the wine). That we take all our moods and feelings forgranted, as something “sent to us.” In fact, we seem to assume that they are us.We are passive. We wake up feeling gloomy; we are contented to wait until Fatesends events to cheer us up. The desire for life is stimulated by a crisis, butsubsides when the crisis is overcome, and we are content to let it subside. Andyet we are always more detached from our feelings than we realize; otherwise,how could you feel “happy to feel happy,” or even feel “happy to feel sad”?Our first duty, he said, is to maintain a sense of gratitude for being alive.Any other attitude is a sin, to be immediately punished by the Powers. All thosefin de siècle poets condemned themselves to death by refusing to be happy, bysitting around, gloomily waiting to be coaxed and patted into smiling.Cunningham then, with immense conviction, went on to point to himself as one ofthose who are “loved by the gods” because he never allows a morsel of despair tosettle anywhere on him. People like Oliver observe that he seems curiouslyfavored by destiny, more vital, more magnetic than other people, and assume thatFate has been kind to him, while in fact, he simply lives according to theinvisible law that states that boredom and lack of enthusiasm for what you aredoing is a mortal sin. He doesn’t worry about scrutinizing the universe forsigns and portents. He said (and the image astounded me) that most men live asif they are the audience in a theater when they don’t realize that they’reactually on the stage, and the gods will throw things if they don’t startacting.I can imagine the effect that all this must have had on Oliver—especiallyCunningham’s conviction that you have to act and radiate vitality at all costs,send out waves of charm and enthusiasm, even when you can see nothing to becharming and enthusiastic about. “Such a man is a magnet to good fortune,” hesaid. He went on to say that he never allowed himself to worry. He was bornrich, and spent more than £100,000 in his twenties. Since then, he has had noregular income, and yet has probably spent another hundred thousand.“For example, I spent a month in the Lake District trying to teach two richyoung men the rudiments of mountain climbing. They got scared and went home,paying the hotel bill but leaving me without a penny. I did the first thing thatcame into my head—took a bus to Preston, and went into the art gallery. Now,within six weeks, we’ve made over two thousand pounds from Oliver’s painting.”This sum staggered me, but I couldn’t help asking him how much of it would findits way to Oliver’s pocket. “What does it matter if he never gets a penny of it?For a paltry two thousand pounds, he’s learned the secret of greatness. He’d bedead if I hadn’t stopped him.” I had to admit that this reasoning seemedaccurate. And yet I couldn’t help thinking of the irony of the thing. Oliver maybe a manic-depressive, but he also has genius. Cunningham has the vitality often men and the audacity of fifty, yet he can’t write a line of decent poetry.This was not a subject I could discuss, after my extravagant praise of hispoems. (Come to think of it, I suppose I owe his confidences to my praise!)Before we left the room to go down to Kirsten, he said one more thing thatstayed in my mind. We had been talking about some of the “unhappy geniuses” ofthe 19th century—from Keats to Van Gogh. Cunningham said: “No man will ever beentirely great until he has succeeded in declaring himself entirely andcompletely for life, with no doubt anywhere in his being. In spite of death andmisery and the apparent cruelty of nature, he has to declare his complete andtotal trust, without any misgiving.” I was so impressed by this that I went intothe lavatory and wrote it down on an envelope.Later. Writing in these long bursts is exhausting. Cunningham makes itnecessary; it is impossible to write about him briefly. Anyway, let me jumpahead of my story. Last night I ended by sleeping with Diana, and I still tingleall over when I think of it. And this again as a direct result of Cunningham’sintervention. I must confess that my original suspicion of him has changed intofairly undiluted admiration.Before we left the room to go down, I stopped to shave; he asked me, grinning,if I wanted to get Diana into bed. I said I did. At this, he said that he’d makesure that I possessed her before the night was over. I knew immediately that hewas not joking, but asked him how this was possible. He said: “I’ll make sureyou get left alone with her. Whip her dress above her waist and shove it in.” Isaid I doubted whether this technique would work. “Balls,” he said. “Make it abit more subtle if you’re frightened. Grab her in your arms and ask her if sheloves you. If she says no, tell her she’s mistaken—she does. But she won’t sayno if you ask her belligerently enough. Make it sound like an ultimatum, that’sthe secret.”He then told me gleefully about one of his earliest conquests. When he was atOxford, he spent a holiday in Paris. He went to a ball where a dazzlinglybeautiful princess was to be married to a Greek millionaire. As soon as he cameinto the room and saw her, he felt that he had to have her. He said: “I knewthat if I didn’t have her, I’d spend the next ten years dreaming about her, andturn into a lovesick poet. I decided I’d rather be horsewhipped than meet withsuch a horrible fate. So immediately after the first dance, I walked up to herand asked her to dance. While I was crossing the floor towards her, I felt anawful sickness, and wanted to rush out of the place. But the moment I began tospeak to her, I regained confidence; I stared at her, and willed her to agree todance, although I knew her future husband was standing behind her and glaring atme. She said yes and stepped out onto the floor with me. After pressing heragainst me for a few moments, I had a monstrous erection. I deliberately pulledher close to me so she was aware of it, clenched my teeth, and muttered in herear: ‘Listen, I’ve got to screw you tonight or I’ll go mad.’ She lookedhorrified and said: ‘That is impossible. There is my fiance, and I am still avirgin.’ ‘That can’t be helped,’ I said, ‘I am the man who is destined to takeyour maidenhead. Come outside now.’ She kept muttering: ‘No, no, it isimpossible.’ I tried to steer her out on to the lawn, but she wouldn’t; she saidshe had to be back at her table to meet someone. So I said: ‘I’ll wait along thecorridor, in the room next to the library. If you are not there in ten minutes,I’m coming to get you.’ Then, without finishing the dance, I turned and lefther. Sure enough, after ten minutes, she came out to the cloakroom. By thattime, I’d spied out the house and found a way upstairs to the bedrooms. Igrabbed her wrist, pulled her upstairs, and as soon as I’d got her in the room,threw her on the bed, ripped off her panties, and bit halfway through her lowerlip. Within less than two minutes I’d stripped off the rest of her clothes andhad her.”“Was it pleasant?” I asked. “Not very. She was frigid.” “She doesn’t sound it.”“No? You don’t understand. People can be hypnotized by conviction and purpose.They possess none themselves and the idea of coming into contact with it excitesthem.” I asked him what had happened to the girl afterwards. “I don’t know. Shelooked in a mirror and started to cry, because her bitten lip was impossible tohide, and half her clothes were torn. I simply dressed and walked out of theroom. I read later that she married her millionaire, so I suppose it must havebeen all right. But years later, a friend of mine met her in the south ofFrance; he happened to show her a photograph with me in it, and she recognizedme. She gave him a message for me: ‘Tell him I love him, and that if he wants tocome for me, I will go wherever he likes.’ ” I asked, “Why didn’t you?” “I hadother things to do. Besides, as I said, she was frigid.”With anyone else, I would dismiss this story as wish fulfillment; withCunningham, I am certain that it happened—or that something fairly close to ithappened.I should also mention that I finally got around to asking Cunningham about thelibrary episode. I even went so far as to show him what I had written about itin my journal. Perhaps this was a mistake—I should have asked his version first.At all events, he confirmed what I had written. He said he had never seen thegirl before, and had not seen her since. He declared that certain women, whenfrustrated, give off a kind of invisible distress signal. This signal is notvisible to all men—only to those who are capable of a satisfactory response. Hesaid that, like me, he had immediately felt a powerful desire for the girl, sostrong that he was tempted to grab her in front of everyone in the library.Instead, he came into the corner where I was sitting—the only spot not visiblefrom the central desk—and allowed his own desires to expand until they became akind of “disturbance of the ether.” He claimed that all the time the girl stoodat the bookshelf, with her back toward us, she was conscious of him and wasalready responding actively to his desire in the usual female way. He said thatwhat he was afraid of was that he might give her an orgasm before he had achance to touch her.He claims that when he spoke to her, he simply said: “I wish to see certainbooks in your special collection.” I asked him why this caution was necessary;he said because she was a “respectable girl” who might easily take fright at herown responses. However, believing that he wanted to see the theology section,she took him to some damp room in the basement. There, he says, he unzipped herskirt without further ado, and possessed her on a table. He says she made noattempt to resist, but kept moaning: “You’re hurting me.” Afterward, he said,she got all intense and said: “What are we going to do?,” and he realized thatshe was one of those girls with an awful ability to cling. He said: “These arethe moments when I abandon the superman role. The only safe course is flight.”He has taken care to avoid the library ever since then.Diana interrupted us; she came up to ask me what time Cunningham would bearriving, and was disconcerted to find him there already. She muttered somethingabout a makeshift supper, and Cunningham immediately declared that we were allto be his guests, and that we’d go and have a Chinese meal. So we went down andjoined Kirsten, who refused a glass of wine, and looked wretchedly embarrassedand stood twisting his hands and mumbling. Cunningham offered to play one of hisown compositions on the piano; when he announced the title: “Kratakoa,” Isuspected it was going to be noisy and discordant, and suggested that it wouldbe better to hear it later when we’d eaten. (Afterwards I explained toCunningham about Kirsten’s dislike of “modern music,” and that it might havedriven him further back into his shell.) Diana agreed to have a drink (out ofembarrassment, I think) and Cunningham and I behaved as if Kirsten weren’tthere, and continued our discussion. I expounded my theory of the indifferencethreshold, which fitted in fairly closely with what he’d been saying earlier,then told him my project of an opera libretto on Major Weir. Just as I expected,Cunningham declared that he knew all about Weir, “the inside story.” Hedismissed my theory that Weir was simply oversexed and repressed, and assured usthat Weir really had intercourse with the devil. I noticed immediately thatKirsten looked interested, and began to brighten up.We took a taxi down to a Chinese restaurant in Limehouse, ordered lager from thepub next door, and had an excellent meal. Meanwhile, Cunningham talked at lengthabout sex and Major Weir. The essence of the thing, he explained to us, wasWeir’s bestiality with horses, sheep, etc. He declared that there are two typesof sexual energy, heavenly and diabolic, and that the sex act is not a physicalact, but actually a symbolic conjuration, exactly like raising demons. Theorgasm does not spring from a reservoir of sexual energy called “the libido,”but comes from beyond the body, in exactly the same way that the electricty inour houses comes from a power station that may be twenty miles away. Otherwise,Cunningham said, how can you explain the fact that the sexual energies cannot beexhausted? A man can keep on having orgasms indefinitely—20 times a day if hewants to. Admittedly, a man might feel sexually drained after the first orgasm,particularly if it happens to be with a wife or someone who excites no desirefor conquest. But this is not real exhaustion, only the refusal of the eroticenergies to reveal themselves in response to such feeble conjuration. Theexhausted man can be roused to excitement five minutes later by the thought of astrange woman or something forbidden.Hence the importance of sex in all diabolic orgies. For what could be moreblasphemous than summoning energy from the divine erotic power house, andpouring it into the anus of a donkey? It is literally dipping Christ into hell.The devotee of the Black Mass who agrees to use his powers of sexual conjurationin this way receives a “bonus” from the devil, an extra load of diabolic sexualenergy. This energy, Cunningham said, is admittedly not of the same power orquality as the divine article—its quality is like methylated spirits compared toNapoleon brandy—but added to the divine article, it makes a mixture ofunparalleled kick. The only trouble is that it is habit-forming, like a drug,and finally sets up a perpetual torment, a kind of unquenchable thirst. This isthe explanation for the fact that all sex maniacs have to commit their crimeswith increasing frequency, and are often driven by an inner compulsion to becaught. The torment is unbearable; the more they commit their crimes, the worseit becomes, like trying to satisfy a burning thirst with petrol or corn whisky.They are also driven further and further from a sense of contact with otherhuman beings, until they feel alone in the outer darkness with the devil. Thisis why their sadism increases. Cunningham instanced a case of sexual murder thattook place in Arkansas when he was out there just after the war. The murdererpreyed on young lovers at the time of the full moon. His first crime onlyinvolved knocking out the man and raping the girl. Subsequently, he got into thehabit of shooting the man, and then torturing the girl before he killed her. Inthe last of these cases, the killer tortured the girl horribly, mutilating herwith a knife, for six hours after he had murdered her lover. But now he wasnearly insane with remorse; he tried to confess to a priest, but the devil drovehim out of the church before his turn came. Finally, knowing that he would bedriven to even greater lengths next time, he decided to hand himself over to thepolice. At this point, the devil intervened, and put the idea of suicide intohis head, knowing that suicide is the ultimate sin for which there is noforgiveness. The man threw himself under a train.At this point, Kirsten asked how Cunningham knew all this, since the man hadnever been caught. Cunningham said that he had access to all details in thesecases, but that he could not, at present, tell us more. Diana asked if he hadknown the identity of the murderer before he committed suicide. Cunningham saidyes, he had.At this point, I asked Cunningham if he knew the identity of Jack the Ripper. Hesmiled and said he certainly did: the Ripper was a rich nobleman who inherited acertain type of insanity from his grandfather; he had died of syphilis in amental home near Ascot. He then leaned over and whispered the name in my ear.8Cunningham told me that he could present me with definite evidence at any time Iwished.Diana now asked him if he knew anything about the Whitechapel murderer. Iwatched Cunningham closely to see if he’d look at me. It is probable that Oliverhas told him about Austin, even though Oliver was never certain. But Cunninghamsaid cautiously that he only knew certain details; since the man was stillalive, he was not allowed to speak of it. Kirsten pressed him to tell what heknew. Cunningham shrugged, and answered that the killer was a rich homosexual,who, like Jack the Ripper, had inherited his degeneracy from a line ofalcoholics on his father’s side. He said he could not tell us any more, and wasnot allowed to reveal the name. Naturally, both Diana and Kirsten were seethingwith curiosity, and asked Cunningham why the murders had stopped so abruptly,and whether the police knew the killer’s identity. He said yes, the police knewhis identity, but that nevertheless the killer was not now in prison. Naturally,I suspected that Glasp had told him everything. (It is strange, incidentally,that Oliver hasn’t asked me any questions about Austin, almost as if he had somesecret reason for keeping silent.)Now there was a curious event. Cunningham stared at Diana very hard, and shestared back at him, her eyes very wide. Kirsten and I simply watched; both of usfelt that we shouldn’t interrupt. Finally, Cunningham smiled and asked her whatshe was thinking. She looked at him in a very puzzled way, and asked if themurderer was a woman. He said no, and asked her why. She said that a name hadcome into her head—“Anne.” Cunningham only smiled; then he told Kirsten that hiswife had definite psychic powers. He said that as she was staring at him, he wassuddenly aware of a definite psychic pressure, as she tried to read his mind. Hehad therefore looked at her, and given her a chance to read it; this was whythey stared at one another.Diana admitted that she had been staring at him, trying to force him to tellthem the name of the murderer, and that when he had looked at her, the word“Anne” seemed to come into her head.As she said this, I suddenly realized that “A. N.” are Austin’s intitials, andmy hair stirred; I felt as if I’d accidentally sat in an electric chair. Forsome odd reason, all three of them looked at me, as if they were aware ofsomething. I muttered: “Strange,” and took a long drink of lager, to cover up myconfusion.After this supper, there is no doubt whatever in my mind that certain peoplepossess the rudiments of curious powers. Well, why not? We know, for example,that the sense of color is a fairly recent development in human beings. Theancient writers never mention colors. Tests on animals prove that they havealmost no color sense; they see the world in a kind of monochrome. Color senseis an evolutionary luxury, and it has not developed until fairly recently (overthe past two or three centuries, I suppose). Well, why should there not be stillfurther senses in a stage of early development? Again, Cunningham admitted thatsadism is a sign of degeneracy—i.e., the opposite of evolution. A more sensitiveperson is too closely in contact with other people to be able to inflict pain.Surely it is not fanciful to suppose that evolution will move toward a universalsense of community, constant telepathic contact between human beings? PerhapsCunningham’s ability to see around corners is an example of this new sense. Whatpuzzles me is that it should be a man like Cunningham, who definitely strikes meas a kind of fool. (In many ways, he is strangely like Austin.) He undeniablyhas powers—remarkable powers, and a kind of genius, but it is on an animallevel; he lacks the real self-discipline of the mystic or man of genius. Hence,I suppose, his interest in magic and other offbeat subjects. I find thispossibility of developing new powers immensely exciting; it gives the world anew meaning for me.After supper, we took a taxi back to Kirsten’s, now in a very friendly mood.Cunningham easily induced him to drink more—we stopped at a pub to load up onspirits—and he became talkative. It was the usual kind of think—the world of thespirit, the empyrean, etc. Then he wanted to tell us about an opera he’dwritten, based on a novel called Varney the Vampire.9 The plot soundedexcruciatingly funny, but both Cunningham and I kept a straight face. Kirstenexplained that the heroine symbolized Heavenly Virtue, renunciation,unselfishness, etc. He then sat at the piano, and insisted on playing us theoverture and leading arias. Kirsten would insist on singing the words—his own,of course—and interrupting the playing to shout things like: “He seizes her inhis arms; they reach a transport of ecstasy,” and more thunderous bangs on thepiano, with Kirsten yodeling like a dog.After half an hour of this, Kirsten was in such a state of alcoholic emotionthat he was hardly intelligible. Cunningham now asked him about his invention,and said he’d like to see it. Kirsten forthwith leaped to his feet, and told usto follow him. Diana, looking oddly subdued and tired (or perhaps it was onlythe gin she was drinking), followed after us. She was so bewildered she evenleft the door wide open and I (who was last out, since I’d gone up to get anovercoat) had to close it. I walked with her behind Kirsten and Cunningham, andas she showed a disposition to stumble, had an excuse to put my arm around herwaist. She didn’t seem to mind in the least. To my surprise, I realized that shewas wearing only a thin dress under a short jacket, and apparently nounderskirt. The zipper at the side of the skirt was partly open, and her bareflesh underneath it was icy cold. I immediately insisted that she wear myovercoat; she agreed, although she protested that she wasn’t cold. Kirsten’sworkshop is half a mile away, behind Hanbury Street, a room in a freezingwarehouse that smells of leather. I was surprised that his “invention” lookedless weird than I’d supposed it would. I’d expected a kind of Heath-Robinson10contraption; instead, it looked like a theater organ. He said that it was anidea he’d got when he saw an invention of Maelzel’s as a child, on exhibition ata fair; it was called an “Orchestrion,” and produced noises like violins, flutesand horns all from one machine. Kirsten himself had also noticed that acombination of piano and organ sounds impressive, and had started designing themachine simply with the intention of uniting piano and organ in one instrument.Soon it came to him that all kinds of noises can be produced by pipes andstrings, properly combined, and he began to design his own “orchestrion.”It was icy cold in the damned shop, and poor Diana was now shivering, in spiteof my overcoat. I was pretty chilly myself. However, Kirsten insisted that wehear his instrument, and announced that he would play us some more extracts fromVarney the Vampire. At this, my heart sank, and I began to make excuses; butKirsten ignored them and sat down, remarking that we must remember that themachine was still unfinished. He then proceeded to play his overture. To myutter amazement, it now sounded quite different. What had sounded absurd andtinny on the piano now became tremendously impressive. Some of his effects wereastounding; for example, there is a quiet passage, played by a thing that soundslike a flute or a high violin, where the piano suddenly chimes in with a weirdeffect like an old barrel organ; then the organ notes take over again, rising toa tremendous, jarring climax. (I don’t know why Kirsten professes to loathemodern music; he’s an expert in the use of discord.) There is now no doubtwhatever in my mind that Kirsten is a musical genius of the first order. Whilehis conversation is precise and pedantic and somehow lacking in vitality, hismusic shows evidence of a mind of great agility. There seems to be no effect inwhich he is not an expert: passages of Miltonic dignity are followed bydistorted strains of Hungarian violins or cockney street music, giving his musica completely unique flavor, as tart as unripe apples. When he went on to play usthe heroine’s final aria, it was now sublime and tremendous; it was everythinghe had said, a climax of sweetness and poignancy that actually brought tears tomy eyes. In spite of the cold, I could have gone on listening for hours.However, it was now after midnight, and Diana was shivering convulsively andprotesting that she wanted to go home. But Cunningham grasped Kirsten’s hand,called him a universal genius, and asked him to come back to his place and talk.I also tried to express what I felt to Kirsten, and he looked as if he was goingto burst into tears. Suddenly he cheered up and shouted: “Let’s go and haveanother drink.” Diana said firmly that she had to be up early and wanted to gohome. He tried to dissuade her, but I could see she was tired, and strangelysharp with him, in the way that women are when they think their menfolk fools.Finally, she said she would go home alone; I said I’d go with her. At this,Kirsten said: “Good, in that case I’ll go back with our friend Caradoc.” (He wasalready using Cunningham’s Christian name, which I can’t bear to pronounce.)Diana had already walked out of the place; I hurried after her and caught upwith her in the street. She said I needn’t spoil my night on her behalf; Ididn’t tell her that I was hoping she’d make my night for me. She let me put myarm around her, but walked back very fast (we were both frozen). As we went upthe stairs, I was wondering what excuse I could use to get her to come up to myroom, but I didn’t need one; she opened her door and asked me if I’d like a cupof tea before I went to bed. So I went in with her. Her gas fire had gone out(she had left it turned on) and neither of us had any small change. Her gasstove was also out of action. So I suggested we go up and use mine. At first Ithought she’d refuse and go straight to bed; but she came up docilely enough. Inmy room, I lit the fire and turned it up high; she huddled over it. I also putthe kettle on the ring in the hearth, to warm the room quicker. For five minutesshe sat with my overcoat on, until the heat became too great. Then she threw itoff. The zipper on her dress was now completely undone, but she didn’t seem tocare; there was a strange abandonment about her as she sat there, as if she weredrunk and tired. (But we’d been listening to the orchestrion for an hour, soshe’d had time to recover from the gin.) I was full of enthusiasm about herhusband, and said that I thought he’d be a great musician. At this she looked alittle more interested, and asked me if I thought he would ever be a success. Isaid that I would be very surprised indeed if he wasn’t, and that I couldn’tunderstand why he hadn’t made a success already. She shrugged, and said thathe’d ruined all the opportunities that had presented themselves so far. Peoplewho showed an interest in his music were put off by his conversation—this is, byhis abuse of all contemporary composers, his contemptuous sneers about“compromise,” and his proposals to write symphonies that would go on for threehours, or operas longer than the Ring cycle. They all ended by thinking he was acrank, and sneaking away.The tea seemed to make her more lively, and as the room was now stiflingly hot,she moved over to the bed and took off her shoes. For half an hour now, I’d hada curious feeling with her. It was not that she was willing to give herself tome, or was offering herself; it was just a certainty. I found myself looking ather as if she was already mine. For example, when she removed the overcoat, andI saw the zipper was undone, I was surprised that the sight of her bare flesh,and a bit of garter belt, aroused no desire, any more than they would in ahusband. Yet it wasn’t that I’d lost interest; I was tingling with need for her,and longing to pounce on her like a wolf. And yet it was as if I had alreadypossessed her once. She went on talking about him with a curious bitterness, andI began to wonder if she secretly resented the fact that Kirsten could neverneed her as much as a “normal” man could.When she’d finished her tea, she lay back against the pillow, her shoulders onthe wall, and closed her eyes. At this moment, we both thought we heardfootsteps on the stairs, as if Kirsten were returning. I was certain it wasKirsten, and immediately gave up all idea of making love to her. We didn’t speakabout it, but just sat there, waiting for him to come up or call to her. Fiveminutes went by, and there was no sound, so we went on talking. Then, with afeeling that the evening was almost over (and in any case, I wanted to go downto the lavatory, which I suspected would break things up), I went over to her asshe lay with closed eyes, moved her shoulders so she was lying on the bed, andkissed her. She lay there as if she was unconscious; I knelt beside the bed fora few minutes, kissing her face and throat; then the bursting bladder got thebetter of me, and I went out of the room. After I came out of the lavatory, Isaw that her door was slightly ajar, so I pushed it open and called “Robert?”Then I looked inside; we had obviously been mistaken in thinking he’d come home.It was probably the tenant on the floor below coming up to the lavatory. Therewas a bunch of keys on the table, which I recognized as Kirsten’s, so I reasonedthat he had probably gone out without them, and would have to ring the bell toget in. I then went down and confirmed that the front door was closed. Finally,I went up to my room, and found that Diana now appeared to be asleep. I turnedoff the fire and the light and undressed in the dark (my heart thumping, afraidshe’d wake up and protest, or that the doorbell would ring). But nothinghappened, and I climbed into bed; she stirred and moved over. But as soon as Istarted to kiss her and raised her dress, she woke up and struggled. I tried tohold her, but she refused. She said: “No, don’t. What if Robert comes back?” Itold her about the key on the table, and that he’d have to ring the doorbell toget in. By this time she was sitting up, and had got out of bed. I accepted theidea of defeat, and lay down again. She opened the door, picked up her shoes,and went out of the room. I said “damn” and turned over. However, before I couldfall asleep, she came back into the room and closed the door; then I heard herclothes falling on the floor. A moment later, she slipped into bed. She left mefinally at half past seven this morning.Now it is over, I feel my usual persistent desire to anatomize the event andexamine my own feeling. The most surprising thing is this: I am certain that I’min love with her. As I write this, I can hear Kirsten’s piano below; the thoughtthat she will sleep with him tonight is unbearable to me. And for the first timein my life, I want a woman so completely that I’d be happy to marry her, oragree to take her off to the other side of the world.I try to understand how this feeling came about. It may be connected with myfeeling of protectiveness about her. I’ve pitied her since I met her looking sotired on the stairs. I had spent the evening with her, and watched her shiver inclothes that should have been thrown away last summer. But the certainty that Iwas in love with her came on me quite suddenly when I was kissing her,immediately after she got into bed. A man in bed says “I love you”automatically; the strange thing was that I didn’t want to say it, because itwould seem a simplification of what I actually felt about her. This was partlyphysical excitement, no doubt. She seemed unsure of herself, and lay on herside, facing me. So I didn’t try to force her; just kissed her, and let my handsmove over her body. She has an exceptionally pliable body—more soft than anyoneI’ve ever known. She lay against me, her thighs caressing me, and it was thenthat I wanted her—I mean that I wanted to marry her. Finally, I had to ask her:“Would you leave your husband to live with me?” She said “I don’t know,” andsounded frightened. I said: “Supposing I gave you a baby?” “I don’t know.” Isaid: “Then let me give you a baby.” When she didn’t reply, I asked her: “Is itpossible for you to have a baby at present?,” and she said yes. At this, Istarted to make love to her like a demon. I had a violent climax inside her; shefelt it, and tried to twist away, but I held her tight. I felt that she had tobe bound to me somehow. There was the feeling of urgency, in case Kirsten camehome, so I made love to her again and again, and after the second time she nolonger tried to make me withdraw. Before she left, I had made love to her eighttimes. At one point, we heard someone on the stairs, and assumed it was Kirsten.Yet she made no move to get out of bed; on the contrary, she put her arms aroundmy neck, as if she wanted him to find us together. For my own part, I didn’tcare; I’d prefer him to find out quickly, so that I’d know where I stood.However, no one called, so I suppose it was one of the tenants going to thelavatory.And yet we spoke very little; I didn’t even say I loved her. At dawn, sheslipped out of bed, pulled on her dress, and went out, carrying her clothes. Ididn’t want to sleep. I had to overcome a temptation to go down and join her,but reasoned that Kirsten might come in suddenly. Finally, I got up and began towrite in this journal. At half past ten I met Kirsten on the stairs; he told mehe’d spent the night talking at Cunningham’s, and that he thinks Cunningham agreat man!Now I should try to use all my insight to try to focus this problem of sex—butnow is the very moment it seems most elusive. And yet one thing came to meclearly last night: sex depends entirely upon the idea of the violation ofidentity. It is like banging two eggs together in your hands so that they bothbreak. (The simile fails because only one of the eggs breaks—still, it holds mymeaning.)Yes, we are all lonely, “each in his prison,” all automatically grasping forfreedom as a moth flies to the light. And there, yesterday afternoon, was adesirable but inviolable Diana, a separate identity, who might be “an immenseworld of delight, closed to my senses five.” Then, like peeling the skin off anonion, I strip away the outer layers of her identity, and plunge into her centeras a bee plunges into a flower. I, of course, am the same for her. A shell iscracked.What I am suggesting, of course, is an “illusion” theory of sex, a neurosistheory. Sex, then, depends upon our being sick enough to want to smash theshell. A madman might believe that the whole world is against him, that there isa conspiracy to defraud him of his reality. The sexual illusion is on preciselythe same level—a false notion that the being of the other person conceals areality that you lack. It is like a child who, asked to choose between twoapples, can never believe that he has not chosen wrongly. No wonder the ancientswere inclined to summarize human existence in such legends as the myth ofTantalus.The odd thing is that I’m not at all pessimistic about this. The illusion isonly harmful if you allow it to be. For example, it might reach a stage of DonJuanism where you want simply to ravish every pretty girl you see in the street.But the real danger would only start if you began to calculate how this couldbest be done (like the West End rapist with his ether pad). Frustration is bad;failure of self-control is worse, the swiftest descent into hell. Meaningvanishes. This is surely the reason that all the most spectacular series of lustmurders have ended either in the suicide of the killer (as in the Ripper case,or the Arkansas murderer), or in the murderer walking into the police traps likea somnambulist, as with Kürten and Heath.I wish I had a language in which I could describe this failure of “meaning” thatmust come to the sexual killer. I can focus the idea, yet cannot express it. Ithink of the Texarkana murderer, who began by merely attacking a couple in acar, knocking the man unconscious and raping the girl, and ended by torturinghis victims to death. But even if he was an exceptionally stupid man, completelyunreflective, he must have felt an awful sense of panic after each of thesemurders, an anticlimax worse than a bad hangover, a sense of having been cheatedby the gods he was obeying. Such “hangovers” must have produced the idea ofdevils in the Middle Ages. The devil whispers “Rather murder an infant in itscradle than nurse unacted desires. If you want sex, go and grab it. If you envythe man in the car, with one hand up her dress, go and knock him out and takethe girl yourself. Do that and you will eventually be free and godlike andwise.” But all that happens is that each time, he has to go further, until, inan effort to grasp the girl’s innermost reality and violate her separateness,merely penetrating her body is not enough; he has to torture her, destroy hercompletely. And after each crime, he knows that he has sunk lower, and the fairygold still glitters and lures him—further down the pit. And the slope above himis so steep that only a spiritual giant could find the courage to climb back.There is no answer but self-destruction.Now I want to rest in Diana, to sink into her, make her my terminus and goal.Arbitrarily I say “I love her,” and it is true.It is half past eleven; I shall go out and meet her for lunch.Later. There are times when I feel driven to destroy illusions—my own and theworld’s. The reason, I suppose, is that I want to know just how tolerable lifewould be without illusions—or if Andreyev and Artsybashev are right when theysay that life would be revealed as it really is—loathsome, naked, ugly,intolerable.One thing I know for certain—it is damned hard work being a human being. Whenthey are handing out the parts in heaven—“You go to Mars; you are to be rebornon Saturn; you are to be a salamander and live in the center of the sun”—Earthis regarded as the “tough assignment.” “You are to be born as a human being onEarth.” “Oh no, not that filthy dump. Why, everybody knows that to be a humanbeing is the lousiest deal in the universe.”These thoughts occurred to me on returning from lunch with Diana. She seemedtired, and talked to me casually, without intimacy, as if last night had neverhappened. I left her, feeling irritable, resentful. When I got in, I thought:“The hell with it; so you spent a pleasant night in bed with somebody else’swife, and now it’s over, so why worry?” It is true that I sometimes wonder if Ican ever be in love; I have made a habit of examining every emotion too closely,analyzing it into its constituent parts. Love I see as part egoism, partpossessiveness, part need for security. And I wish I could explode this sexualillusion. Is there any hope that man might be a little more godlike without it?The world seems to me so full of illusion. Cunningham is a good man, vital andintelligent; yet all his talk of magic and evil is an illusion with which hekeeps himself going. There is no evil, only stupidity. There is no magic; magicnever works, never, at any time. So we are left in a rather unglamorousuniverse. The mainstay of the entertainment industry—romantic love—is anotherlie. Centuries have built codes of ethics on this idea of romantic love—knightson horseback, killing dragons and giants for the sake of a lady’s glove, and itis all a lie to conceal the truth—two dogs copulating in an alleyway.No, I’m good at seeing through illusions, but what is the truth underneath them?That I can’t see at present. We are so closely enmeshed in illusions that theexplosion of one or two of them makes no difference. On the street corner below,a crowd of teddy boys stand most evenings and whistle at the girls who go by.They have probably all had sexual experience; yet every girl who passesrepresents a taboo that they long to break. Illusions. I put on a record—it isTchaikovsky’s Pathétique. More illusions, another poor devil who thought theuniverse owed him love. A self-betrayer, as Bill Payne would call him. Give uslove, give us illusions. These cinema posters—“Escape to Happiness”—desertislands, golden sands, handsome men, “Beyond the Blue Horizon,” beautiful girlsin motorboats on the Riviera. But someone has carefully decorated the girl’sbathing costume with a vagina and pubic hair. This is what horrifies me. Theentertainment industry depends on giving the public “what it wants,” and what itwants seems to be a symbol of kittenish innocence—Brigitte Bardot and MarilynMonroe. But a lot deeper, there is this violence, the desire of a starved tigerfor flesh.And this is something, at least, of the reality that Cunningham wants to coverup with his talk about Grimoires and unutterable secrets.Nov. 17. I was interrupted yesterday by Carlotta. My first reaction on seeingher was irritation; I thought I’d got rid of her when Cunningham took her home.However, she wanted to talk to me, and she asked me if Cunningham might turn upwhile she talked; when I said I wasn’t sure, she insisted on going to the pub onthe corner. There we found a quiet table and I bought beers; she leaned over andasked me solemnly if I thought Cunningham was sane! I replied that, on thewhole, I did. She then said: “I think he is perhaps the most dangerous man Ihave ever met.” From the way she said it, I knew exactly what she meant: thatshe was somehow terrified of him, but that he fascinated her. For some reason, Isuddenly felt sorry for her. Yes, I think I know why. She sat there, looking sosolid and German, with her attractive, squarish face, excellent nose and lipsand high cheek bones, and her eyes looking absurdly tragic, and I suddenlythought of Cunningham’s story about seducing the princess; I imagine theprincess as the opposite of Carlotta (although perhaps I’m being romantic)—slim,rather pale and with the curious self-confidence that generations of money andservants can give. And I know Carlotta hasn’t a chance anyway; I imagine she’dexcite a slightly sadistic element in Cunningham. However, I couldn’t tell herthis, so I simply asked her questions. First of all, she asked me if I wasjealous of Cunningham. I asked her why I should be. She then said dramatically:“You know I stayed with him the other night?” I said yes, I had expected that.It’s easier to tell a girl that you don’t object to her infidelities than totell her you don’t care about her; yet they amount to the same thing.She then went on to tell me what had happened. She described again her sensationon first meeting Cunningham—the strange feeling that she was being violated byhim without any physical contact. This feeling continued to obsess her for therest of the evening. She said that she had a sense of being dominated by him. Ican’t convey the way she said all this. She evidently takes herself veryseriously; I can’t take her half so seriously. She explained it with her eyesdowncast, in a low voice, as if we were talking about great mysteries. At thesame time, I sensed that she didn’t look at me because she was afraid I’d belaughing at her—which I suppose I was. She declared that it was “horrible,” thatshe hated it, and yet wanted it. I felt this was partly untrue, but couldn’t bebothered to try and get at the truth.When they went back together, she was in a state of excitement, for she feltthat something awful might happen to her. Cunningham remarked that it was toolate to get her home, and that she could have the spare bed. She took this to bean excuse to persuade her to stay, and made no objection. However, to heramazement, Cunningham took her into a room upstairs, made up the bed, and lefther almost immediately, warning her sardonically to lock her door in case Olivertried to get in! When he had gone, she locked the door. (She claims she did thisbecause she didn’t want him to come in; I think she did it out of pique, orperhaps to force him to knock and beg her to open.) Immediately, she feltoppressed by the room. There were several locked trunks in it, and a table on araised platform was covered with black cloth. She said she felt instinctivelythat there was something wrong with the room. She even pulled one of the trunksaside to see if by any chance it concealed another entrance to the room. Shethen undressed and got into bed. She woke an hour later and was aware of someonemaking love to her. (I pressed her to be specific, and she said she felt someonelying on top of her, actually having sexual intercourse.) She wondered howCunningham had got in, but nevertheless kept her eyes closed. Suddenly,something made her open them. Immediately, she realized she was alone in thebed, and that the sense of weight on her body had vanished.She found the room oppressive—it smelt of some scent or incense, and shesuspected that this had induced the illusion. So she got out of bed, and openedthe window. It was a windy night, and she had to cover her face with thebed-clothes to avoid the draft. She then felt “safe,” and went to sleep again,this time lying on her stomach. Some time later, she was awakened by thesensation of someone in the bed again. This time she kept her eyes closed forabout ten minutes. All the time, her visitor continued to make love to her,while she lay perfectly still. Suddenly, tempted no doubt by her position, hetried to make love “in the Italian manner.” By this time, she was quite certainthat her former experience had been a dream, but that Cunningham was nowdefinitely in the bed. So she opened her eyes and said “no.” Immediately, shewas again aware of being alone. This time she lay awake for more than an hourbefore she went back to sleep.It happened a third time. She kept her eyes closed and let her “visitor” makelove to her. “He is a pervert,” she said. I pressed her to explain, but sherefused to be more specific. However, I gather that this went on for sometime—no doubt she didn’t want to risk having him vanish by raisingobjections—and it wasn’t until he hurt her suddenly that she opened her eyes.Immediately, she was alone in the bed, although she said that the state of thebed convinced her that she had not been alone a few minutes before. She layawake, and the dawn came through the curtains. She then got up and hurried offto the tube station. She did not see Cunningham. She left a note on the pillowsaying “Thank you,” then was struck by its ambiguity, and tore it up. Onarriving home, she said that she was suddenly stricken with the most awfulstomach cramps, and had to lie down for an hour. I asked her what she thoughthad happened, and she said that she supposed Cunningham had waked up, found hergone, and somehow projected his rage to Kentish Town!I find all this interesting, simply as a demonstration of human gullibility. Idon’t believe for a moment that Cunningham really possessed her in the night.But I am convinced that he somehow induced her to believe that he would.The next problem is: Why should he? If he wanted to sleep with her, why didn’the go ahead and do so? The only reason that seems plausible is that he intendsto use her for some other purpose in the future, and wants to make her feelthoroughly dominated first. If I know Carlotta, a night in bed with Cunninghamwould have left her slightly contemptuous, again mistress of herself. Thiswouldn’t matter if he only meant to sleep with her once. But what other purposecould he have?I asked her what she intended to do—if she meant to avoid him in future. Shesaid she would like to, but couldn’t. Then she said—this impressed me—“I thinkhe is capable of doing something terrible to me.” It didn’t impress me because Ithought it true—I don’t. It impressed me because she wants to believe it true.I didn’t want Carlotta on my hands for the rest of the evening, so I advised herto go and see Cunningham, telling her that I thought he would be alone now. Sheaccepted this idea immediately, and went off with a predatory gleam in her eye.I then went to my room again.Kirsten was still playing the piano, but he stopped occasionally to talk, and Icould hear Diana’s voice. They, of course, could hear me moving around. Istarted reading about Major Weir again. Then, to my surprise, my door opened andDiana came in. I was still annoyed and resentful—in fact, I’d accustomed myselfto the idea that there was no longer anything between us. So I got up, grabbedher and kissed her. She talked in a whisper, said Kirsten (who was stillplaying) thought she had gone down to the shop, and that she wanted to ask me ifI would try and keep Cunningham away from him. She said she was certainCunningham was an evil influence. I wanted to quarrel with her, so I said Ithought she was wrong, and that Cunningham could probably get Kirsten’s musicpublished. Then I asked her directly to come to bed. She said she hadn’t time. Isaid of course she had—Kirsten wouldn’t know that there wasn’t a long queue inthe shop, and pushed her onto the bed. I expected her to rush off, and verify myfeeling that last night meant nothing to her. But to my amazement, she yieldedimmediately, and let me possess her without even taking off any of her clothes.When it was over she stood up, smoothed down her dress, smiled at me in a funnyway, as if to ask: “Are you satisfied now?,” and went out. I became convincedthat I shall never understand women. Diana is a puzzle to me. Why is she soundemonstrative? Is she capable of caring about anybody? And how can anyone whoseems so shy and demure give herself to that bookmaking type?I’ve given up worrying about these questions.Half an hour later, Diana came up again and asked me if I’d like to come downand have something to eat. I said I’d eaten, but went down with some wineanyway. Kirsten, however, wouldn’t drink. He only wanted to rave to me aboutCunningham again, and to say that he was sure that, with Cunningham’s help, he’dmanage to get Varney the Vampire presented. Diana showed herself more practicalthan I’d expected, and asked me what I knew about Cunningham’s relation toOliver. I told them frankly what I knew, including the finances of the matter.Kirsten asked me directly: “Do you think he hopes to make money out of me?” Isaid I didn’t think it unlikely. Then he laughed and said: “Well, if he can makemoney out of my work, there’s no reason why he shouldn’t. I’ve been trying forten years, without success.”I was struck by Kirsten’s proprietary air about Diana—a thing that hadn’t struckme before. It is obvious that he wouldn’t dream of mistrusting her, any morethan he’d mistrust his own right hand. And yet, as she demurely made coffee, Ikept realizing that I had only just possessed her.We sat and talked for two hours. I find Kirsten a sympathetic man, although hislack of discrimination is disturbing—he should have been born a hundred yearsago, when his flowery language and cranky idealism were fashionable. Then heplayed me Schumann and Brahms until late. I heard someone go up to my room, butI decided not to show myself—it was probably Carlotta and I didn’t feel likeplaying confidant any more. I drank most of the wine myself.Nov. 18. I spent last night at Cunningham’s place. He is undoubtedly one of themost amazing men I have ever met, and I think I now begin to understand whathe’s after. Until I met him, Austin was probably the most remarkable person I’dever known. (I’d still like the two of them to meet.) And in some odd way,Cunningham reminds me of Austin. Both have an intelligence and sensibility wellabove average; and yet both somehow strike me as “wrong.” I cannot explain whatI mean at the moment. Perhaps later.At mid-afternoon I went over to see Cunningham, sick of trying to write with thenoise of Kirsten’s piano. Oliver told me that it was Cunningham’s meditationperiod, but I went up to see anyway. Sure enough, there was Cunningham, wearinga voluminous yellow robe, sitting in the lotus position and contemplating hisnavel. He didn’t seem to notice me, and I was sure that he’d make it a point ofhonor not to be disturbed by me, so I sat down, picked up a book—it was one ofSuzuki’s volumes on Zen—and read for an hour. Cunningham’s position brought acertain nostalgia, for I remember when I thought that I was cut out to be aHindu ascetic sitting crosslegged on Mount Meru. Why did I give up the idea?Because I suspect that that kind of sainthood can only be developed to a certainextent, and then becomes redundant, like an overblown rose. When the idea firstcomes, it is tremendous, a great revelation. You’ve become accustomed to seeingthings through a mist of emotions and desires and motives; suddenly, you see itthrough the eyes of the ascetic, and it is no longer confusing; it is strangelypure and simple, like a Japanese painting—like Hokusai’s picture of Fujiyama andthe wave. It suddenly seems that all people are wasting their lives and theirtime in their silly preoccupations, while you have stumbled on the only thingthat matters, the answer to life itself, the need to seek “salvation,” the needfor truth and intensification of consciousness and the way to become a god. Butas soon as you try following this new way, it becomes more complicated; youpromptly lose sight of what you were after, and realize that your simple attemptto reach out and grasp it was like a child reaching for the sun. It remains anaim and an ideal, but there’s no point in sitting cross-legged. You can stare atyour navel till you burst; you don’t get any freer.At the end of an hour, Cunningham “woke up,” and greeted me as if he didn’t knowI was in the room—even asked me how long I’d been waiting. We then got into adiscussion of Zen and meditation, and I made the comments I’ve written downhere. This immediately led us into what now seems to me the most exciting andfruitful discussion I’ve ever had. We went out for a walk, had a meal, andCunningham was completely frank with me. Now I begin to understand his plans, Isee their audacity, and realize that he has more than a touch of greatness. Andyet I’m also aware of some weakness in him, some flaw, that I find difficult todescribe.We didn’t get around to discussing these plans until late at night, but there isno point in detailing our other talk. All the same, it was obvious that he feltI understood him completely, and that he could be completely frank with me.He began by asking me if I thought it could be chance that had brought the fourof us together—Kirsten, Oliver, Cunningham and myself. “Let us not be modestabout this. We are probably the four most remarkable men in London. How is it,then that we have come together like this? I believe there is some strangedestiny that brings together men who will have a great effect upon the age.Think of Nietzsche and Wagner, Schumann and Brahms, Goethe and Schiller ... Thegreat men gravitate together.” I was so flattered by this remark that I didn’tpoint out that most great men meet when they’ve become sufficiently famous to beable to seek one another out.What he then went on to say—and I was struck by his penetration—is that manysuch men have no capacity for making their own way independently, and heinstanced Kirsten and Oliver. He might have added himself. A man of genius isoften helpless on his own; banded with one or two others, his strength increaseshundredfold.I now began to see the nature of his idea. He himself, he explained, is one ofthese people who are fated to be rather than to do. His poetry, he saidmodestly, is fine, but not for the present age. On the other hand—as he hasalready proved with Oliver—he has a capacity for getting himself noticed. Sowhat could be luckier than the four of us meeting like this? Plainly we arepredestined to help one another.He then went on to explain that he owns a small island off the coast ofSardinia—only a few acres, with a deserted farmhouse. Why should we not movethere, with our respective women, and form a community that would live togetheron completely anarchic principles? Everything would be shared, including thewomen. We would put into action Rabelais’ precept: “Do what you will.” Hisproblem so far had been lack of money. Oliver’s painting and Kirsten’s inventionwould probably supply us with money. As soon as our community became known, wewould attract great artists from all over the world, and rich women would beg tobe allowed to give us money.Cunningham is a good talker, and I must admit that he had me enthusiastic afterten minutes. But at this point, I interrupted him to ask what he had in mind forthe two of us; I have so far never made a penny from writing, so can’tcontribute much. Cunningham asked me about my private income; I explained thatit was only a few pounds a week. He wanted to know if it wouldn’t be possible toget access to the capital; I said no, it wouldn’t, since this was against theterms of the will. (It isn’t—although I doubt whether I could get the money aseasily as that. I wasn’t going to tell Cunningham, who is a first class sharkwhere money is concerned.) Cunningham then said that I could probably sell myannuity for a lump sum; I cautiously agreed. But if Cunningham’s plan involveslosing my narrow margin of independence, I shall drop out of the scheme. I thinkhe guessed my thoughts, because he said suddenly that perhaps it would be abetter idea to keep my money in reserve, in case the whole scheme failed and wewere all on our uppers. In that case, the £3,000—for which he seems to think wecould sell my annuity—would get us out of trouble.I was attracted by the idea, but thought it cranky. Besides, I hate travel, andthink I’m probably too much of a lone wolf to commit myself to living in any“community.” But now Cunningham became fiendishly persuasive. He said that weneedn’t think about going to the island until we’d made sure that we can makethe community “work” by experiments in London. He then hinted obscurely at“masters” somewhere in the East—men from whom he derives his “powers”—and who,if they could be persuaded to support the venture, would guarantee its success.I must admit that by this time I was sceptical, but was taking care not to showit. It was beginning to sound like a confidence trick. Then Cunningham astoundedme by seeming to read my thoughts. He got up and carefully closed the curtains,brought out a bottle of Chartreuse, produced black coffee, and then said: “Now,we can get down to discussing the real problems, and the real nature of our worktogether.” (He has this habit of talking as if the two of us were conspirators.)“Now, Gerard, tell me what it is that you want most in the world.” I said that Ididn’t particularly want anything, since I had enough money to live and work.“Yes, I know you don’t want to be rich. I wasn’t referring to that kind of need,anyway. You know what I mean. What do you want out of life?”Since I’d been brooding on this, I was able to reply immediately: “Some way ofintensifying my consciousness tenfold; some way of living more completely.” Henodded, and said that he knew I was going to make this reply. (The funny thingwas that I felt he was telling the truth, and that he knew in advance exactlyhow the conversation would go.)I want to try to record the next part of the conversation as accurately as Ican, because I think it proves that, no matter how much of a charlatan he maybe, he undeniably has some deep insight, some unusual knowledge of psychology,that he couldn’t have learned in England. (I dismiss the possibility that hethought it out for himself; although he is intelligent, he doesn’t strike me asa creative thinker.)First of all, he pointed out to me that I am basically dissatisfied with myself.I have all the things that I once believed would make me ideally happy—I mean “aroom of one’s own” and five pounds a week, music and books, and a fairlyinteresting love life. And yet I’m bored and unfulfilled. Why? “Human weakness,”I said. “Quite. You are right. But what is the exact nature of this weakness?”“Low intensity of consciousness.” “Precisely. Your consciousness is trimmed low,like a tiny candle flame. It doesn’t embrace the things you ought to be gratefulfor. Consider what happens if you go into a bookshop and find a book you’vealways wanted to own. Your consciousness puts out a kind of arm, a pseudopodium,and envelops the book. For a few hours—or perhaps days—you are intensely awareof the book. You keep saying to yourself: ‘I’ve got it at last.’ Then yourconsciousness relaxes; the arm is withdrawn. You get used to the book and nolonger feel grateful that you possess it. Am I not right?”I admitted he was. All this, he said, is a result of the low pressure of ourconscious minds. It is like a terribly low gas pressure that won’t boil akettle. “You have many things that you would hate to lose, and yet you are inthe strange position of not being at all glad you possess them. Have you neverbought a book and forgotten about it? Then someone borrows it from you, and yourinterest in it revives. As soon as it’s returned, you plunge on it and read itfrom cover to cover. The consciousness has to be constantly stimulated intogratitude by loss.”I reminded him of Chesterton’s novel about a man who keeps leaving his wife andgoing off around the world, because it’s so nice when he comes back to her. Hesaid: “Precisely. Can you imagine a more terrible indictment of human beings?They exalt love and romanticism as the greatest thing in the world. All theirmost moving poems and epics are about the tremendous importance of love. And yetwhen a man is married to a woman he is in love with, he is promptly bored byher. He is not actively and violently bored; he doesn’t want to poison her orpush her out of a window; but he can’t help taking her for granted, and losingthe first intensity of possessiveness.”Cunningham then proceeded to the question of the intensification ofconsciousness, and the achievement of what he called “cosmic consciousness.”There are various methods, he said. Drinking, for example. This relaxes us,fills us with a certain spirit of acceptance, intensifies the power ofaffirmation. But it causes deterioration. The same is true of drugs.At this point, he asked me if I’d ever tried drugs. I said I hadn’t. “Then youmust start immediately. It will lend point to what I’m going to say.” Iprotested that I didn’t want to try, but I must admit that I felt curious.Cunningham opened a cupboard, came back with a tiny packet, and poured a smallamount of a grayish powder on the back of my hand. I sniffed it through my noseas he instructed me. He also took some—about three times as much as he gave me,I noticed. He wouldn’t tell me what it was—said that he only wanted todemonstrate it to me, and didn’t want to get me “hooked” on it. He denied thatit was cocaine, although he admitted that it contained cocaine. It made my nosevery sore and made me want to cough. I drank some wine to clear my head. Afterfive minutes, it began to take effect. Cunningham was right; it was like turningthe control on a gas jet; my consciousness seemed to light up, to expand. Thecurious thing was that it had no other effect—didn’t give me a pleasantsensation, like alcohol, and didn’t have any effect at all on my mind, except tomake my thinking rather clearer.“You see,” Cunningham said, “there are quite simple means of intensifyingconsciousness. But I may as well be frank with you. Their disadvantages areexactly like those of alcohol, only more so. You noticed that I had to takethree times as much as you. This is because I have been using it for severalyears. I’m not hooked on it. I could give it up within 24 hours. I am the onlyperson I have ever known who can use drugs without becoming their slave.”He then became very mysterious. “There now remains only one great method that wehaven’t mentioned—sex. This is in some ways the most important. To begin with,it has no harmful effect on the body. A man who has spent a lifetime havingsexual intercourse is unaffected by it, unlike a drug taker or alcoholic.Moreover, sex can sometimes produce an intensity of consciousness far greaterthan anything that can be attained through drugs. The main trouble with thesexual orgasm is that it is too brief. There is no way of prolonging it, andwhether we like it or not, the intensity vanishes immediately afterwards.”The effect of all this talk, with my mind abnormally brilliant from the drug,was indescribable. I had a feeling that I was on the dge of a revelation thatwould change my life. And Cunningham finished by saying: “I have discovered ameans of prolonging the sexual orgasm for a slightly longer period—about aminute. But this is not enough. And I need two things: leisure to experiment,and an intelligent helper. And I think you could be the helper.”Up to now, I had been fascinated by him, and convinced that, even if he had no“supernatural insight,” he possessed a psychological knowledge that went beyondanything I’d ever met. And yet, just as abruptly, he began to speak in a waythat made me think that he was either a fool or a charlatan. I naturally pressedhim to tell me more of his method of prolonging the sexual orgasm. He appearedto hesitate for a while, then finally went out of the room, and finally cameback with a book bound in leather. The title page read: The Book of CeremonialMagic of Abrahamelin the Mage, translated and edited by Caradoc Cunningham.“Take this away with you and read it—particularly my introduction. You won’t beable to gather much about the text itself without a certain amount of help.” Iglanced at it, but couldn’t see anything that seemed particularly profound. Inoted a few sentences: “Among the smaller birds, the magpie is talkative andforetells guests,” “Moreover, the elements themselves teach us fatal events.”There were various tables giving details about the Tarot pack, the Kaballah,etc.I said, “I don’t want to jump to hasty conclusions, but some of this stuff lookslike the mumbo-jumbo you can buy in fortune-tellers’ booths for a half crown.”He defended it by saying that much of it was symbolic, and required long study.I asked him if he had ever obtained any positive results by magic and he saidgravely: “Many times.” “But what kind of results?” “I hesitate to tell you. Idon’t want to hurry you into this thing too fast. You are naturally sceptical,and your scepticism has to be dissipated little by little. You see, it isn’t aquestion of some totally new revelation, but of getting you to place slightlydifferent emphases on many things. This will make everything appear to you in acompletely different light.”He refused to say anything more, but whenever I looked into the book, I couldn’thelp feeling that anyone who could translate so much nonsense must besimple-minded. Cunningham plied me with a lot more drink. I took some of it, butsoon realized that I’d regret it in the morning, so refused to drink more, andsaid good night. There are no clocks in Cunningham’s room, and I’d left my watchbehind. So I was startled as I came out into the street, and discovered it wasalready dawn. I came back here and slept for a few hours. Since eleven o’clock,I’ve been sitting in bed drinking tea and reading Abrahamelin the Mage.Cunningham’s introduction, and his notes on the various sections, seem to memore interesting than the text itself. But what really astounds me is that heclaims in print that it is possible to raise demons, kill people by black magic,cause storms, etc. To do this Abrahamelin bloke justice, he seems to be more ofa Jewish mystic than a magician; he includes long prayers to be repeated beforethe invocations, declares that a man will lose all spiritual power if heattempts to do evil with the magic, and includes a set of rules of “preparation”that include fasting and praying for a week.After reading most of Cunningham’s own original work in this book, I amdisappointed. He strikes me as a romantic who’d like to believe in all thistrash. But as far as I can see, the main thing that’s needed is a capacity forself-delusion. It’s all very well talking about magical experiments, but themain trouble about all magic is that it doesn’t produce results. I suppose itwas an early form of science. But how can anyone attach any seriousness to aformula for making gold with the dried blood of a newt, two hairs from a witch’scat, and a number of incantations in Hebrew? The stupidity of the whole thinglies in the desire to make gold in the first place. If gold could bemanufactured easily, it would be as worthless as iron. I’m forced to theconclusion that Cunningham has no spiritual perception.I took the trouble to write out on a sheet of paper a summary of my own aims,which I shall give to Cunningham when I return this book. It will explain myrejection of magic more clearly than any number of criticisms. I copy it outhere:“I am perpetually aware of the feebleness of my consciousness. I have only oneaim: to learn to ‘pump up’ consciousness in the way you can pump up the pressurein a primus stove. I agree that the sexual orgasm, alcohol and drugs canmomentarily raise the pressure of consciousness. But this is like pumping airinto a tire with a hole in it; within a few minutes, it’s flat again. I amhorrified by the instability and inconsistency of human beings. We seem to havevirtually no values that don’t change minute by minute. If time could be speededup fifty times, we would be able to see this amazing lack of direction. This ishow it would look: A man groans with hunger; he grabs food, but before it ishalfway to his mouth, throws it away and complains of indigestion. He starts tokiss a beautiful girl, but suddenly lashes out and blacks her eye instead, thenimmediately bursts into tears and begs forgiveness; within a few seconds he islaughing hysterically and jumping up and down ... And so on. Scorpions stingingthemselves couldn’t be more absurd and inconsistent than human beings. Even thegreatest of them talk nonsense, and all philosophers contradict themselvesbefore the end of the book. They preach universal love, then admit that there isoften more vitality in conflict, or declare the need for freedom, and end byadmitting that men are disgusting idiots who need to be bullied. Nothing we cansay about life cannot be negated by another statement that appears equally true.Our moods and mental climates are more changeable than England’s weather.“I admit that we have a few negative values that are far more solid andconsistent than our positive ones. Waste of life always strikes us as astupidity, whether it is a man engraving the Lord’s Prayer on a pinpoint, or aman who commits murder for a few shillings and is hanged for it. Cruelty seemsto excite a fairly uniform revulsion throughout mankind. But compared with thefew things that we know to be bad or worthless, there seem to be millions ofcontradictory things that we think good.“All this feebleness is the outcome of our fluid consciousness, which is toopassive. It merely photographs things, and loses the photographs almost asquickly as it takes them. The consciousness never seems strong enough to seemeanings in things; all it can do is just observe blankly. It is like staring ata page of a book in a foreign language. We seem to be crippled; there is anawful paralysis in our feelings, our values, A man can return to a place he haslonged to see after ten years, and experience absolutely no emotion; hisfeelings are paralyzed. A soldier returns from the war; he has been dreaming ofhome for years and rereading every letter fifty times; within a fortnight he isquarreling with his wife and going out to get drunk to forget his boredom.“I am perpetually aware of this, and I realize that the only answer is aninternal strength so enormous that certain values would be quite permanent. Aman with such strength would love life with an unimaginable intensity, and hislove of life would provide a stimulus for striving after still greater strength.Only this paralysis of consciousness stops us from marching down the road towardthe superman.”That, I think, is as clearly as I have ever expressed my central obsessions. Atleast Cunningham has stimulated me to that extent.Later. After writing the above—it was about two in the afternoon—Cunninghamarrived. I immediately showed it to him while I went to make tea. When I cameout again, he was excited, said that I had proved myself to be one of the “newmen,” and asked me if he could use it in his new book on magic. Naturally, Isaid I’d be delighted. He then insisted on taking me out for a meal (I hadn’teaten since getting back this morning). We took a taxi to Fleet Street, and wentto Cunningham’s club for a drink. Here, a great many people seemed to know him,and I got the impression that he was popular. Only one thing struck me as odd.We went downstairs to eat, and Cunningham went out to the lavatory. Immediately,a small, dark man who was dining with a platinum blonde, came over to my tableand bent over me in a conspiratorial manner. He asked me if I knew Cunninghamwell. I was surprised, and said that I’d known him for a week. At this point, hethought he heard Cunningham coming back down the stairs, and thrust a card intomy hand, asking me to telephone him later. He then rushed back to his own table.However, it turned out that it was only the waiter coming downstairs. He satthere for another five minutes; still there was no sign of Cunningham. So heplucked up courage again, darted over, and asked me if I’d give him my phonenumber. I told him I didn’t have one, but managed to tell him my address asCunningham reappeared on the stairs. He went back to his table and I saw himwriting it down immediately. I don’t know whether Cunningham saw him, but if hedid, he didn’t mention it to me, and I didn’t speak of it either. Ten minuteslater, as the little man got up and left, Cunningham noticed him and staredafter him rather hard; however, he said nothing. He seemed to be in a talkativemood, and very gay. He drank lager instead of his usual wine, and explained thathe’d been drinking too much wine recently and that it was impairing hisclairvoyant powers. I asked him about these, and he talked with a quite newcandor. I set it down here because I’ve never encounterd any similar case.Cunningham explained that when he was about ten, he was at a private school. Hismother came to visit him one day, and said: “Guess what I’ve brought for you?”Cunningham replied: “Wait, don’t tell me. Let me tell you. You’ve brought me anantique ring, and you bought it in that shop in the Old Brompton Road where weboth stopped last time I was in London.” Cunningham said that he hadn’tconsciously “read her mind”; it was simply that he had a sudden strongimpression that he knew what she was going to give him, and could see whereshe’d bought it. His mother was astounded; she had, in fact, bought him acurious ring in the shape of two snakes twisted together, since she knew he wasfascinated by snakes. (“Symbol of forbidden wisdom,” he explained.) After this,Cunningham said, he found a book by Rudolph Steiner in the school library aboutthe development of “occult powers,” which explained how the soul should be sentinto “outer space” every night on the point of falling asleep; it also explainedthat the drinking of wine was ruinous to these powers. Now it happened that atthis time, Cunningham was anemic, and was always made to drink a glass of some“tonic wine” before he went to bed. He knew it was no use explaining his reasonsfor refusing wine to the housekeeper; but he contrived things so that he couldmanage to pour the wine away without her seeing. He also practiced the methodexplained by Steiner. Within a few days, he was aware that his powers weredeveloping. When the boys set out to go to play cricket with another school, hesuddenly knew for certain that one of them would not return that night; he toldthis to one of the boys. The boy laughed, but nevertheless told various others,who began to tease Cunningham about “ghosts.” However, they were all greatlyimpressed when, in fact, the boy did not return to school that night; he hadbeen hit on the head by the cricket ball and was taken to the hospital with aslight case of concussion. Cunningham, however, was clever enough to realizethat he would only awaken a lot of tiresome curiosity if he paraded his powerstoo openly. He was therefore the first to declare that the whole thing had beencoincidence, and took care not to say anything more about his second sight. Butfrom then on, it functioned fairly regularly for several years. Only oneevening, he inadvertently gave himself away to a friend. They had a gramophonein his room and were playing a Beethoven symphony. The friend started to lookthrough a pile of records, when Cunningham said unthinkingly: “No, it’s notthere. I lent it to Smith.” He realized when he’d said it that his friend hadnot actually said he was looking for the Mendelssohn violin concerto. His friendlooked startled and said: “What?,” and Cunningham tried to retrieve his mistakeby saying: “I thought you said you wanted to hear Beethoven’s Fifth, so Iassumed you were looking for it.” His friend was satisfied—until suddenly Smithwalked into the room with an album and said: “Here’s your Mendelssohn violinconcerto back.” The friend said later: “You did know what I was looking for,didn’t you?,” but Cunningham insisted that he had only made a lucky guess. Allthe same, he developed something of a reputation at school for spooky powers,and found this a nuisance when boys kept approaching him about the results ofthe next football match.These powers disappeared when he went up to Oxford and began to drink heavily,but, he explained, he was already interested in other aspects of occultism, anddid not regard the loss of his second sight as very important.While Cunningham told me all this, I had the impression that he was being quitefrank and honest; he told it humorously, with no attempt at mystification, as ifsecond sight were a curious disability like a tendency to seasickness.Since he was in this frank mood, I asked him about Carlotta. (He had alreadyasked me about Diana; some of his questions were so personal that I blushed, butI felt he had a certain right to know, since he played such a part in theaffair.) He asked me what Carlotta had told me, and when I repeated her story ofthe “incubus” in her bed, he was delighted. He told me that as soon as he hadseen her, he realized that Carlotta was an exceptionally good subject for histype of power. She possessed a great store of vital energy that had beenfrustrated and bottled up for so long that it was easy to “use her.” (He didn’texplain what he meant by this.) I tried to press him to be more specific, but heonly said he would tell me more later. He did say, however, that he had not beenin her bed that night—astrally or otherwise.This puzzles me. Do I have to conclude that Cunningham can somehow influencepeople at a distance? It is hard to believe—even though I saw him cause that manin the street to stumble. What is more likely is that he somehow took advantageof Carlotta’s hysteria to make her believe in his “powers.”At the end of the lunch, Cunningham explained to me that he felt I was ready tobe introduced into the “mysteries.” I possess, according to him, an unusualdegree of psychological perception; my mind makes persistent attempts to getbeyond the facade of the everyday world into the realm of the occult. But Istill see things in their “natural” light; I seek a natural solution to theproblems. I have no inkling of the concealed mysteries. He became veryconfiding, placing his hands on mine and leaning over until his face almosttouched me; the waiters must have thought we were a couple of queers. “Do youthink it coincidence that you have met me at this point in your life? Don’tbelieve it. The Powers have been preparing you. The Powers arranged that youshould meet me. And the Powers ordained that you should help me to bring my workto fruition.” He also hinted that he had been “told” about me several years ago,warned that he would meet a co-worker, and told how to recognize me. However, herefused to talk about this.When we left, he told me to prepare myself for two more days, with thinking andmeditation—and prayer, if I feel so inclined. I am to meditate on the problem ofhuman boredom. This will prepare me for the revelation he proposes to make.When we got back—it was after five o’clock, and I was sleepy from the wine—hetold me that he intended to take Kirsten out this evening to meet someone whocould help him with his invention. I knew what he meant—that I could spend theevening in bed with Diana. I delivered his message to Kirsten, then went up tomy room and fell asleep. I woke at about half past seven, took another half hourto wake up fully, and heard Cunningham going out with Kirsten. I went downstairsand knocked on her door. She was alone, but I somehow felt in no mood to takeadvantage of Kirsten’s absence. We sat and talked for a while about Cunningham,then she said she’d like to hear music, and we came up to my room and playedrecords for a couple of hours. It was a curious situation. I wish I could readher mind. Sometimes I suspect that she doesn’t quite trust me—thinks I’m out fora casual love affair. Anyway, we both felt rather tired and subdued, and Ididn’t feel like drinking again. When Kirsten came home, just after ten, Ihadn’t even kissed her. I called to Kirsten that we were in my room; he came up,and didn’t seem in the least surprised to find us together. He was full of talkabout Cunningham, who had introduced him to a Jewish music publisher; the manwas coming back tomorrow to hear the Panharmonicon.It amused me to notice that Kirsten’s presence seemed to create an intimacybetween Diana and myself that had been absent when we were alone. I caught herlooking at me several times with a kind of tenderness, and when she finallyleft, she found an opportunity to touch my hand for a moment.Now, alone, I think about her, and realize that my feelings of the other dayhaven’t changed at all. I was afraid then that it was my usual sense ofgratitude for a woman who gives herself to me. But it still seems preposterousthat she should go off to sleep with another man. I actually feel married toher, instead of feeling that we’re deceiving her husband. Yet I like Kirsten. Iwonder if he’d care much if Diana left him? He seems a cold blooded fish ...Nov. 21. Yesterday was a crowded day, and I realize it will take me severalpages to write of it in detail. And yet when I read back over the past fewweeks, I’m not sorry that I started to describe my life so fully. Even ifCunningham vanished out of my life tomorrow, I’d be glad of the notes I’ve madeabout him. He puzzles me; I want to get to the bottom of him. There’s definitelysomething wrong. Power and weakness, knowledge and delusion, are so oddly mixedin him that I’d like to take him to pieces and make a minute analysis. Forexample, I can’t quite believe that my “natural” vision of life is only apreparation for some occult insight. In another journal, I had written: “Unlessthe world is richer, unless it has other depths and dimensions, I loathe it.”Cunningham would use this as evidence that I await some “revelation.” Yet I wantmy “richness” to be natural, not supernatural.Anyway, to return to what happened yesterday. This morning, I got a letter,addressed simply to “Gerard,” at this address. It was from the man I’d met inthe restaurant the day before, and whose card I have somehow mislaid. His nameis Steve Radin, and he works for the Daily News, doing mostly celebrityinterviews. I hadn’t, of course, told him my name when I gave him my address,but he overheard Cunningham calling me Gerard, so relied on his letter reachingme. The letter simply said that he would like to talk to me, and would I ringhim at his office during the morning. I was curious, and went down to the phoneimmediately. His secretary said he hadn’t come in yet, but had left a messagefor me: if I rang, I was to say what time during the day it would be convenientfor Mr. Radin to call. I said any time. The secretary then said: “Mr. Radin saidhe would like to see you alone.” So I said I’d be alone all morning, butcouldn’t guarantee the afternoon. The truth was that I was curious to know whatit was all about, and wanted him to come as soon as possible.He arrived an hour later—at about 11. The first thing he said was “Are youalone?,” and then, “Is there any chance we might be interrupted?” I understoodhe was asking about Cunningham, and I admitted there was a faint chance he mightturn up. Radin promptly insisted that I go out with him to talk. He had a carthere, and took me to a club in Soho. As we passed Farringdon Street, a taxistopped alongside us, and to my astonishment I saw Father O’Mahoney11 sitting inthe back. He’s been in Italy all this year for his health, and I never expectedto see the poor old boy alive again. We managed to wave before the lightschanged.The club was one I didn’t know. It was almost deserted. Radin had refused totalk about Cunningham on the way there—only told me that he used to be afree-lance reporter, and now worked for the News. Then we talked about BillPayne, whom he seems to know quite well. But as soon as we were settled, withdrinks, he plunged into the subject. He asked me if I realized that Cunninghamwas regarded by some people as a highly dangerous man. When I said no, he said:“I’m going to take a chance with you. I don’t know why, but I got the impressionthe other day that you’re not yet very involved with Cunningham. So I’m going totalk frankly to you about him, and rely on you to make sure it never gets backto Cunningham.” I promised him—I’d have promised anything, I was so curious bythis time. I asked him in what way Cunningham is dangerous—whether he’s acriminal, a madman, or what. He said: “No, I don’t think so, although I wouldn’tlike to swear to either. But he’s a professional corrupter and wrecker.”What he then went on to tell me was almost as interesting as what Cunningham hadbeen saying the day before. Radin claimed that, as a journalist, he had acurious way of anticipating stories. For example, he had known a man in variouspubs around Chelsea, and as soon as he met him, had a conviction that this manwould one day be “news.” The man was Neville Heath, and a few months later hemurdered a woman in a Notting Hill hotel room. Radin said that this was notsecond sight, but just the instinct of a good journalist. (I seem to rememberthat Bernard Shaw once saw the murderer Haigh in a South Kensington hotel, andpredicted that Haigh would be hanged one day; Haigh had lost his temper over achild.) Anyway, Radin said that he had had the same feeling of “news” ever sincehe’d met Cunningham. I asked him if he thought Cunningham would commit a murder,but he said no.Before he would say any more, he asked me to tell him how I’d met Cunningham. Ididn’t see any harm in it, so I told him pretty well everything—except the “sexmagic.” I think the association with Oliver and Kirsten rather reflects crediton Cunningham anyway. I didn’t know how far I had a right to tell himCunningham’s plans about the island, but he finally wormed it out of me.In exchange, he told me everything he knew about Cunningham, which was a lot.Cunningham was apparenty at Oxford for a while, where he caused considerablescandal by publishing volumes of pornographic verse; one, called Slimy Weapons,got him into the trouble that led to his being sent down. There was also sometalk about his having curious sexual tendencies; a local girl who becameinfatuated with him got badly beaten up one night and had two of her teethknocked out. As she served in one of the cafés, this was rather noticeable.However, she refused to say anything against him. She was apparently fairlyobviously pregnant when Cunningham had to leave Oxford. And yet—this surprisedme most—it was general knowledge that Cunningham had homosexual tendencies; hehung around with a queer set, and apparently once boasted that he had committedsodomy with a choir boy on the altar in one of the chapels. He was then veryrich, and was noted for extravagance. He hung his rooms with expensivetapestries, and made a habit of wearing jewelry—particularly rings. But he wasalso apparently pretty tough. One night, a group of football-playing heartiesdecided to break up his rooms. He got wind of this, and pretended to go out.Actually, he waited in the room. When they broke in, he waited until they wereall inside—about a dozen beefy lads—then went for them all with a heavy stick.(Radin told me this story with admiration, and apparently the exploit gaveCunningham a great reputation in the college.) He closed the door and switchedon the light, and the hearties thought they were in a trap until they realizedthey only had Cunningham to deal with. Then he went into them like a whirlwind,and the dozen of them couldn’t master him. I gather he broke several heads andmanaged to bruise pretty well all of them. When one of them managed to twist thestick away from him, he immediately grabbed a short club which he’d concealed,and went on. After five minutes of this, one of them managed to get the dooropen, and they all made a break for it. But a persistent rumor got around laterthat Cunningham had taken something—some kind of drug—that acted as a temporarystimulant. (I must ask him about this one day.) They said he was like a demon.Actually, I suspect that one violently angry man is more than a match for adozen sheepish louts, particularly with a stick.Radin wasn’t sure about the “scandal” that caused him to be sent down, exceptthat it involved the book Slimy Weapons, and pretty open flaunting of the rules.There was also a story that he’d gotten his tutor drunk and inflicted someindignity with a can of paint, but this was never confirmed.Apparently Cunningham spent the years just before the war traveling abroad andmountaineering. He is known as an excellent mountaineer, and a man with unusualphysical endurance. When he was in India with Sir Harold Clunn, they broke amountaineering record on one of the peaks, and Cunningham saved someone’s lifeby some extraordinary bravery. However, he apparently set out with his own teamof climbers a couple of years later, and the whole thing was disastrous. Radinsaid that he thought Cunningham had no gift for command—he was too much of ananarchist and a wild man. Everyone quarreled, the party split up, and finallythree men of the splinter group fell into a crevasse and were buried by alandslide. Cunningham stood by and refused to help them, because he said theydeserved whatever they got for rebelling against him. Two of them died beforethe others could dig them out. This caused something of a scandal at the time,and Cunningham was denounced in the papers, and thrown out of some clubs. Therewas talk of a prosecution, but he hurried off to South America and stayed therefor a couple of years.There, apparently, he went in seriously for this black-magic lark. He wentsearching around New Mexico, in the Lawrence country, to find tribes who stillpracticed human sacrifice. But again, I gather he made some pretty startlingdiscoveries about Aztec and Mayan remains, and I’m told that some things hediscovered in the jungle are now in a museum in New York and are regarded aspriceless.This helps me to define what I find so hard to understand about Cunningham. Halfthe time he behaves like a spoiled child, and shouldn’t be allowed intocivilized society. Yet he appears, under certain circumstances, to be genuinelycapable of extraordinary self-discipline. Without this freakish element in hischaracter—this tendency to raise hell and thumb his nose at society—I think hecould easily be a great man. But he seems to need external challenges to get thebest out of him. This makes me wonder whether a combination of my sense ofpurpose and Cunningham’s vitality couldn’t achieve something worth-while. ... Isthis perhaps why he wants my help?To return: he had to leave Mexico, again after a scandal involving a death, andhe returned to England just before the war. He professed to find politics vulgarand boring, and was quoted as saying that he didn’t object in the least toHitler’s cruelty, but couldn’t bear his commonplace mind.When war broke out, he apparently served in the army for six months—as aprivate, oddly enough—and was then discharged on medical grounds. Radin met himin Fleet Street shortly after this. Radin himself was a conscientious objector,and was about to be sent to some awful labor camp in Wales. Cunningham told himthat he ought to have spoken to him about it, and hinted that he knew of drugsthat could produce the effect of a disease that would lead inevitably todischarge. Cunningham wasn’t specific, but Radin thought he had “worked histicket” in this way.He didn’t see Cunningham again until after the war. Cunningham apparently spentthe war years in the north of Scotland, where he bought himself a large house,gave himself a title, and divided his time equally between drinking andpracticing black magic. His house got itself such a bad name among the villagersthat even ten years later, when Radin visited the place on another assignment,he was told that it was haunted by demons, and that no one would go past itafter dark.His only other news of Cunningham during the war came from a Sunday newspaperthat revived the controversy about the Loch Ness monster. Cunningham wrote anarticle for this paper in which he declared that the monster was not a survivalfrom the Jurassic era, but had been “conjured up” by the witches of Boleskin inthe time of Charles II. Cunningham pointed out that there were no references tothe monster before this time, and hinted that he had some inside knowledge thatconfirmed his suggestions. He also hinted that there still were active witchcults in remote parts of the British Isles—and again let it be understood thathe had some secret knowledge. His article created an unusual amount ofcontroversy—considering its nonsensical nature—and Cunningham gained a kind ofovernight notoriety.This led to his acquaintance with Lord Belmont, who was supposed to be mostlyconcerned with archaeology, but who was actually studying witch cults and magic.Radin covered the scandal when Belmont’s daughter Clara ran away with aMediterranean smuggler, and was caught just before they got to Gretna Green, somet her on several occasions. He described her as a very pretty girl, but withan extremely weak mouth and chin, and a fancy that she was an intellectual and adefender of women’s rights. (Her elder sister got herself half killed by someAmerican soldier during the war, and Belmont was perhaps stricter with her thannecessary.) When she met Cunningham, she was drinking heavily and sleepingaround as much as she could. For some weird reason, Cunningham agreed to marryher—Radin thinks it was misplaced chivalry. At all events, they managed to getmarried in Edinburgh before Belmont found out about it. He threw a tremendoustantrum, went out looking for Cunningham with a revolver, and wrote his daughterletters saying that Cunningham was insane and a pervert. It was at this pointthat Radin met Cunningham in London; Cunningham consulted him about whether hethought he could get heavy damages from Belmont for defamation of character.Radin said he thought not because on the one hand, the court would probablysympathize with the father whose daughter had eloped for the second time; and onthe other, Cunningham’s character might easily be blackened by the defenselawyer if he took the trouble to read up old newspaper reports of themountain-climbing incident. It was at this point, Radin said, that he suspectedCunningham was losing his money and was getting worried.The next thing that happened was that the wife had a baby—a daughter—andCunningham dragged them off on some peculiar trip across Africa, apparently tolearn about tribal magic. Radin is not sure of the details, but it seems thatthe three of them got abandoned by their servants when they were about twohundred miles from the nearest town. Cunningham then deserted his wife, made hisown way to Durban, and sailed for England. The wife managed to get to the coast,but the baby died on the way, of some fever.I must admit that this story shook me. A man can be forgiven for many things,but deserting his wife and baby in the middle of a strange country is not justweakness or even wickedness, but a repulsive kind of selfishness that disgustsme. However, I’d like to hear Cunningham’s version of the story. I felt thatRadin, in spite of his “lack of prejudice,” actually hates Cunningham’s guts,and is looking forward to the day when the “scandal” breaks. Even so, the factslook pretty damning for Cunningham. His wife returned to him in England, andlived with him for a time. Then he left her again, and was seen around Londonwith another woman—an actress. The wife had some kind of a breakdown, and endedup in a mental home. Radin says he believed this was the effect of drugs,alcohol, and the sheer craziness of life with Cunningham, who spent half hisnights trying to raise the devil by long incantations. He also asked his wife tobelieve that he was the latest avatar of the World Savior, sent to create a newage. (I gather that his wife is now living again with her father, but is achronic invalid; she has divorced Cunningham, and has refused to talk to Radinabout him.)This summarizes all that Radin told me about Cunningham. We went out and hadlunch in the Gay Hussar, and talked until well after three o’clock. Radin saysthat he lost touch with Cunningham about five years ago. He has no idea how orwhere he’s lived since deserting Clara; all he knows is that Cunningham spentall his money, and had to sell his property in Scotland.I found all this fascinating, but difficult to believe. Radin assured me that itwas all true, and that he would introduce me to someone who would verify it all.I was, to tell the truth, pretty sleepy and anxious to get home, but didn’t feelI could rush off since I owed Radin a lunch. I tried to find out exactly whatRadin wanted me to do, but he wouldn’t be explicit. I imagine that he was simplycurious to find out what I knew about Cunningham. He also, I think, relies on myfuture cooperation, and perhaps hopes that I’ll be a source of insideinformation about Cunningham’s plans.He insisted that we call on someone in Soho, but the person was out. He thensaid that we could at least walk past the British Museum and see if we couldfind his friend there. So we went in, and Radin looked in the reading room, andcame out a few minutes later with a man I remember having seen there many times.His name is Frederick Wise, an authority on heretical sects. He’s a curious oldman with a mop of white hair and an awful looking goiter that gives him theappearance of a toad. He was rather brusque, declared he was too busy to talk atthe moment, but finally came outside with us. However, he became more talkativewhen we sat down, and, as it was bitterly cold there, agreed to come across theroad for a cup of tea. Radin explained to him that he’d been telling me aboutCunningham, and that he thought I was in danger of coming under Cunningham’sinfluence; he asked the old man’s opinion. Wise said: “There’s only one thing Ican say for sure about Cunningham—he’s one of the few really evil men I’ve evermet. Keep away from him.” He then told the story of Cunningham’s marriage, butin a slightly different version from Radin’s, and, if possible, even moredamning. But what interested me most was that Wise is plainly a believer inmagic and witchcraft himself; this came out in several things he said. Finally,he jumped up and said he had to go and work, and vanished without further ado.Radin said: “It’s a pity he’s in one of his bad moods. When he’s talkative,he’ll go on for hours. He could tell you some astonishing things aboutCunningham, and what’s more, he understands these things.” I pressed him toexplain himself, and he said: “What I really wanted Wise to tell you was histheory that Cunningham was always doomed to fail and to be unlucky in anythinghe attempted.” Wise believed that Cunningham had taken various solemn oaths whenhe started to study magic—oaths binding him to use his power only for good, tokeep his eyes fixed on the highest ideals, etc. It is also a part of these oathsthat a man calls down upon himself the most awful maledictions in the event ofhis breaking them. I can easily imagine Cunningham taking such oaths andbelieving in his own sincerity; but I can also imagine that a character asmercurial and weak as Cunningham would forget them a fortnight later. Wise,apparently, believes that this is what happened, and that Cunningham has exposedhimself to “formidable spiritual reprisals” by breaking his oaths. He hasdefinite knowledge that Cunningham found the disciplines prescribed byAbrahamelin the Mage too binding, and that he went off to Egypt (this was beforethe war) searching for a new “Bible for the Supermen” in the museums of Cairo,and probably in certain tombs. At all events, he sent communications to variousoccult groups in London and Paris, declaring that he had received somerevelation direct from the Egyptian god Anubis, and that he had been ordered toproclaim himself the new leader of all such groups. Naturally, this caused agreat deal of trouble; nobody was willing to accept his leadership at such shortnotice. At the meeting Wise’s group called to discuss the matter, a black ravenflew into the room and blundered against the light bulb, causing it to blow out.Afterwards, they verified that there had been no window open to admit the bird,and concluded that it was a sign that Cunningham’s claims were to be takenseriously. However, Wise had the idea that all members should be searched beforethey left the room—he seems to have been shrewder than the others—and in thepocket of a man who was known to be friendly to Cunningham they found grains ofcorn and some feathers! This ended Cunningham’s hopes of becoming leader of thegroup, and also convinced everyone that he was to be treated as a charlatan whoonly wanted power.I finally left Radin at five o’clock and came back here. I think he’d gainedwhat he wanted—to keep track of Cunningham’s exploits. As for me, I can’t drinkduring the afternoon without feeling fit for absolutely nothing in the evening.So I lay down and tried to sleep. However, after a quarter of an hour or so,Diana came and woke me up. I pulled her down on the bed and said: “Listen, Iwant to ask you something. Do you love me?” She said: “How can I love you? I’veonly known you for a few days.” “But you’ve slept with me.” “That’s not thesame,” “You mean you don’t mind sleeping with a man you don’t care about?!” “Ididn’t say I don’t care about you.” “What do you mean, then?” “To love someone,you have to be absolutely sure of him. So you have to know him well. I haven’tknown you long enough.” She looked at me so honestly as she said this that I wastouched. I said: “Do you love your husband?” Again she looked doubtful. “In away ... but—” “But what?” She shrugged. “I can’t talk about him to you—yet.” Itseems to me that she has an extraordinary honesty. It would have been so easyfor her to say: “No, I don’t love him any more.” Finally, I asked her:“Supposing I asked you to leave him and come to me?” She looked surprised.Instead of refusing, as I expected, she said: “Do you want me as much as that?”I nodded and kissed her, and said: “Don’t you believe me?” “It’s not that. But... I don’t think you’re the sort of person to stay with one woman. I think youlike women too much.” It took me some time to convince her that she was wrong,and that I really wanted her to come away with me. I pressed her about it; shetemporized and said she couldn’t tell me immediately. Then she lay down on thebed, as if to say: “Make love to me, and excuse me answering any furtherquestions.” It seems that Kirsten was out again with Cunningham, so I decided itwould be a pity to waste the opportunity, and undressed her. As I was makinglove to her, I said: “Supposing I give you a baby. You’d have to leave Kirstenthen.” She only nodded, her eyes closed. Half an hour later, she said she had togo out to get food, in case Kirsten hadn’t eaten. But when she’d gone, I laythere and thought it all preposterous. I don’t want a love affair with her. Iwant to marry her. She seems to me the sort of girl I could live with for therest of my life without getting tired. I am analytical enough to realize thatthis is because she’s curiously yielding and quite un-egotistical—and this isnecessary for an egotist like me. She’d put up with me. I don’t think it’ssuccess she needs in a husband, although I have never doubted that I shallachieve immense success one day, but simply affection and need for her. I feelthat Kirsten doesn’t offer her much affection. A kind of need, perhaps, butnothing very personal, just the same thing he feels about his supper. I realizethat I’m giving up my independence, and yet this makes no difference. I nevervalued it that much. Besides, I might never meet anyone like Diana again. But Iwish I knew how much Kirsten needs her ...Nov. 22. I spent most of yesterday filling in my journal, which exhausted me.However, I didn’t finish. Kirsten returned with Cunningham again, and Cunninghamcame up to ask me out to supper. I told him I’d already eaten, and didn’t feellike another meal. (Luckily, he didn’t use his second sight to find out aboutRadin!) But he persuaded me to go back with him.He was only slightly puzzled that I wouldn’t drink; I said I had a headache.The truth was that the things Radin had told me had affected me; they made mesee him in a different way, as a weakling. He could sense this, I think. He saidsomething about magic, and I said that he should realize that I am, at present,one of the unconverted, and feel a slight derision when I hear the word. Atthis, his manner became rather quiet and serious, and he said: “But you mustrealize, Gerard, that magic is perhaps the only thing in the world really worthdoing. Because in its broadest sense, magic means trying to summon up forcesgreater than your conscious self. Don’t you believe in such forces?” I said Idid, but not in wishful thinking. He said: “Is it wishful thinking? White magicis supposed to be a means of invoking the gods. Black magic means summoning updevils. Well, I can tell you now that these forces exist—forces for evil orgood.”He’s a cunning devil. He knows I can’t resist intellectualizing, and that thesurest way to gain my attention is to say something intelligent. I told him thatreligion means trying to summon the god inside you—in the subconscious orsuperconscious or whatever you want to call it. Magic seems to mean trying tosummon gods and demons from outside you. And they just don’t exist. Cunninghamsaid: “Don’t think I’m trying to quibble. But it depends very much on what youmean by inside and outside. I could take you right now to a room half a mileaway where you would be convinced of the reality of spirit-mediumship. I couldintroduce you to a woman who could tell you things about yourself and your lifethat she couldn’t possible have learned from anyone. And she’s no charlatan. Shedoesn’t know herself how she does it. She doesn’t try to use her powers to getrich—although she makes a living by them. Where does she gain this power? Frominside herself or outside? Most of her congregation at the Spiritualist churchwill tell you it comes from outside, from the spirits of the dead. I don’t thinkit necessary to accept this idea. I believe it comes from some unknown, untappedresources that we all contain.”I must admit that Cunningham has a brilliance that makes it impossible todislike him for long. I wish I could have asked him outright about the story ofabandoning his wife and daughter, but I didn’t want to tell him aboutRadin—partly because Radin made me promise so solemnly. (I almost suspect thathe’s afraid of Cunningham.)When I said that I’d like to study a case of “genuine mediumship” before I madeup my mind, Cunningham looked thoughtful, then said: “I might be able to dobetter than that. I wonder ... ” Then he said suddenly: “Wait here for a momentwhile I telephone.” He went out, and came back ten minutes later. “Would youlike to see a haunted house?” I said cautiously that I might find itinteresting. He said: “All right. Come on.”By this time, my headache had disappeared completely. We went down toWhitechapel High Street and got a taxi, then drove to Hanover Square. On theway, Cunningham explained that he couldn’t promise any manifestation, but thatif there were anything, it would convince me far more than any case ofmediumship. Then he explained that we were going to a house near Hanover Square.“Have you ever read Lytton’s Haunted and the Haunters?” I said yes. “This placeis the house that Lytton was supposed to have based the story on. It was emptyfor a long time. Now the ground floor has been turned into a flat, and the upperpart is used as a storeroom for paintings. I know the son of the man who ownsit.” As we went along, he told me the story of the house—the usual thing about awicked Victorian who beat his wife to death and let his niece starve because shewouldn’t marry the man of his choice; the niece committed suicide by jumping outof the window—which is on the second floor—and the wicked uncle died in hissleep, after living alone in the house for some time. Thereafter, the room inwhich the niece had been starved and the wife had died was haunted, and thestory has it that people who stayed in the room have been driven insane.Cunningham agreed that all this was unauthenticated, and that the story aboutpeople going insane and dying of fright and delayed shock sounds like the usualexaggeration. However, there are a number of reports from people who testify toa definite “presence” in the haunted room, and the house did remain empty forten years or so—in spite of its position in the middle of the West End—until afirm of art dealers bought it.We called at a house in Hanover Square, and Cunningham collected the key from aservant, then we walked around the corner to the house itself.There is no point in going into detail about this. The room didn’t strike me asin any way peculiar, except it was hellishly cold. We switched on a largeelectric fire, and it gradually warmed up. It was pretty uncomfortable, havingonly one chair and a mattress in it; it was full of dust, smelled very stale anddepressing; the light was also very weak; I think a decent 150-watt bulb wouldcompletely dissipate its spooky atmosphere!When we were settled, Cunningham declared that we ought to have brought somebooze, and insisted on going down to get some. I think this may have been a rusefor leaving me alone there and trying to get me into a state of nerves. However,the room didn’t impress me, and I sat there until Cunningham came back (loadedwith drink) without noticing anything that made me nervous.We sat there for a couple of hours. Cunningham said that we would leave at onein the morning if we saw and heard nothing. We drank whisky out of tooth glasseswe found in the bathroom next door, and talked. I must admit that Cunninghamshowed no disposition to try to “set the atmosphere” by talking about ghosts.Instead, he went into a quite brilliant discourse on logical positivism. Some ofit struck me as so sound that I note it here. He attacked the position thatphilosophy must confine itself to what can be proved or tested. He said thatmany propositions of vital importance are unprovable. For example, someone oncesaid that no man dies until he has accomplished whatever he has inside him—thatif Schubert and Keats and Wolf had lived thirty years longer, they wouldn’t haveadded substantially to their achievement. Now this proposition is plainly of theutmost importance; a man of genius who accepted it and believed it implicitlywould be freed of the usual gloomy fatalism and would work twice as hard. Thereis not a single human being who wouldn’t derive some benefit from believing it.And yet how is it possible to test it? Not that it has to be swallowed blindly.But you can only apply to it the test of your own intuitions and experience, andthey may be quite uncommunicable to another person.Cunningham’s talk always excites me, and I drank more than I intended to. Beforevery long, I noticed it was after midnight. It was then that I observed that theroom was horribly cold. At first I thought the electric fire had gone out. Butit hadn’t, and I got up, went over to it, and warmed my hands. Yet even as I satthere, the back of my neck was freezing. I suddenly shivered, and had an awfulsense of foreboding, as if something had crept up on us without our noticing it.Cunningham was smiling oddly. Then he said: “Well, how do you account for that?”“For what?” I said, my teeth chattering. “This cold. It wasn’t like this half anhour ago. He pointed to the fire, which was large enough to warm any other room,and I saw his point. However, I commented that it was, after all, aftermidnight, and probably the temperature outside had dropped a great deal. Thecreepy feeling had quite vanished. We drank more whisky—I wasn’t feeling toogood, not because of the cold, but simply because it doesn’t suit my stomach toget slightly drunk twice in one day—and I tried not to be sick. Suddenly I felta great deal of pity for the poor girl who had starved in this room. It was ahell of a room to be sick in. The wallpaper—mid-Victorian and pre-Morris—was themost depressing I’ve ever seen. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if the “evilinfluence” of the room hasn’t something to do with the smell and awful patternon that lousy wallpaper. Finally, I suggested we go. Cunningham said all right,and we went out. Then I got a surprise. Although the rest of the house smelledmusty enough, it was nowhere near as cold, and when we got outside, the nightseemed warm compared to that room.Cunningham took me home and let me go to bed without further talk. I stillcannot explain the cold in the room. But this doesn’t mean that I accept theidea of ghosts; after all, it could be due to physical causes—a draft down achimney or something.Thinking about it all, I feel badly puzzled. Oh, I can see already whatCunningham is driving at. He wants me to admit that, since I reject this boringworld of my everyday experience, I may as well take the plunge into the occultworld. But I am as ultimately unconvinced by it as I was by Father O’Mahoney’sCatholicism. I agree that the answer fits the questions; but that still doesn’tguarantee that it’s the right answer. Cunningham has already dropped hints ofthe direction in which he wants to lead me. We are to form a society who will“dare anything.” For example, he asked me questions about Christine that make mesuppose that he is thinking of her as a possible subject for his “sex magic.” (Idon’t know what Oliver would say!) Oh, I can see it all with complete clarity.Cunningham has not yet succeeded in impressing the world, in getting the worldto take him on his own terms. He is now approaching 50; he has published acouple of dozen volumes of various kinds (so he tells me) and yet he iscompletely unknown. He becomes especially bitter when he talks about Auden,Isherwood and Spender, whom he knew in the thirties, and it’s easy to see thathe feels he’s been left behind. He ought to be the dominant figure of hisgeneration, and instead of that, he has only a certain amount of newspapernotoriety. He thirsts for fame, for recognition that he is an extraordinary man.Now he feels he might be able to do it. But not merely as the patron andimpresario, a role that doesn’t suit him at all. So he wants to bind his owndestiny to that of Glasp, Kirsten and myself, to be the leader and mentor, theman who provides the ideas, the philosophy. We are to form a little Thebaid inthe desert of modern civilization, bound together by esoteric knowledge andprobably by sexual orgies.I don’t object to this—I sympathize. There is no doubt whatever that Cunninghamhas helped Oliver unselfishly—(because I don’t count the pocketing of Oliver’sprofits as real self-interest; Cunningham feels he has earned it). If he can getKirsten’s music performed, or my books published, I have no doubt he’ll do itjust as unselfishly. But will he ever be accepted in his own right? I almostthink Wise was right when he said that Cunningham had “incurred heavy spiritualreprisals” for some loss of integrity.But where is the point in proving to me the existence of spirits, or anythingelse of the kind? I don’t doubt that the house in Hanover Square is haunted, insome sense or another. There is definitely a presence in that room. But so what?There are tigers in India and polar bears at the North Pole, but they don’t makeany difference to me.All this stuff about sex magic worries me. The orgasm isn’t everything; it’sonly a part of it. I know the sexual act can be supreme, bringing immenseinsight and triumph, a sense of godhood. This I experienced that first nightwith Caroline, and again the other night with Diana. But I never experienced itwith Gertrude, or Madeleine, or Carlotta. What is this elusive power that canmake sex an astounding experience? It is a kind of life, freshness. The earlydays with Caroline had a real magic about them, even though I wasn’t in lovewith her. She was intensely exciting, as fresh as the heart of a young lettuce,and I felt as if she were my reward for a long period of hard work and refusalto be distracted. I felt that the powers of life were in the ascendant. Wenormally work in the face of defeat, always aware that things may get worse, andthat death is the final end. But in the best moments, we cease to be slaves;defeat vanishes, and there seems a chance that death may be ultimately defeated.Nijinsky’s wife said that the first time he made love to her, she felt as if shewere making a sacrifice to the goddess of love. This I understand—in bed with agodlike man, the greatest male dancer the world has ever known; they must havefelt like gods on Olympus. This is what sex ought to be.Of one thing I am sure. So far, the human race has always worshiped death anddefeat. I am sickened and irritated when I read the Bible, with its talk of“man’s final end,” or the respected classical writers declaring solemnly thateven the greatest men must end in death. It strikes me as being nauseatingflattery of a tyrant, like that ballad that talks about “good King John” wheneveryone knows he was the rottenest swine who ever disgraced a throne. I knowthis is supposed to be a part of human nature, but it’s time it stopped beingso. Only stupid savages adore a tyrant because he is cruel and destructive.There are times when I catch a glimpse of a state of consciousness, onlyslightly higher than our present one, when all the blacks will turn intowhite—or at least into gray. At present, a writer can say: “We all agree thatlife is a long-drawn-out defeat, ending in death,” and no one raises theslightest objection. But a day will come when such a statement will be greetedwith yells of derision. Life is meaningless unless death can be finallydefeated. And I don’t mean “eternal life” in the religious sense. (If we have tochoose between that kind of nonsense and total pessimism, give me totalpessimism any day.) I mean a life in which consciousness is no longer a feebleflame, like a gas jet that takes an hour to boil a kettle. I mean a life inwhich men no longer feel themselves slaves, when every one of us will feel likeParis, “that first dawn in Helen’s arms.”Can Cunningham show me the way toward this state? I remember reading once thatmagic is just a bastard form of mysticism; well, I prefer mysticism to magic.Nov. 24. The Diana business has come to a head rather absurdly. I was reading inbed yesterday morning when Kirsten knocked on my door. He looked rather odd, andI suspected that he’d found out about Diana. He sat down, stared gloomily at thecarpet, then said he wanted to ask my advice. Then, with a rush, he said:“Sorme, I think my wife is being unfaithful to me.” I asked him cautiously whatmade him think that, and was glad he didn’t look at me, because my heart wasthumping and I was probably red. He then held out to me a handful of letters,all scrawled in a semi-illiterate handwriting on tiny sheets of a sixpennynotepad. I said I didn’t think I had any right to look at letters addressed tohis wife. He assumed from this that I was reproaching him, and asked me what heshould do under the circumstances—after all, his wife’s love affairs were hisconcern, and he felt completely inadequate to cope with the situation. So out ofcuriosity, I took the letters and I glanced through them. Most of them were notdated, but one that was was over a year old. The early ones began “Dear Di.”This changed into “Dearest Di” and “My Darling Di,” and finally into “MyDarlingest Own” and other endearments that made me wince. I glanced at Kirstenas I looked through them, and saw that he was trembling, and looked as if hewere about to burst into tears. I couldn’t help feeling irritable with him;after all, if his wife’s unfaithful, why doesn’t he black her eye or throw herdownstairs instead of confiding in his next door neighbor? I finally said thatthere was no evidence that she had been unfaithful, and he snatched them fromme, turned to one of the later ones, and read aloud to me a passage that began:“My dove, I shan’t ever forget last night and the feel of your thighs pressedagainst mine.” I pointed out to him that the last letter began by mentioningthat she had refused to go away with him, and accused her of ceasing to careabout him. I suggested to Kirsten that the affair was probably now over, but hesaid that if it was over, why hadn’t she burnt the letters, instead of keepingthem carefully concealed under some old magazines on top of the wardrobe? Then,to my embarrassment and astonishment, he said that he had been observing herrecently, and had suspected that she was in love with somebody else—that he hadsuspected it was me! At this point, I was tempted to break it to him, but foundI couldn’t.Kirsten went on to say that the letters indicated that she often met this manfor lunch or after work, and that he wanted to go down to the factory and see ifhis suspicions were correct. I said I thought this was an excellent idea—beingfairly certain that she has stopped seeing her bookmaker type. Kirsten then hadto ask me if I knew where the factory was. He didn’t even know! (He claimed thathe’d been there, but had forgotten.) It was at this point that I had myinspiration. I told him that I believed it was in Clark Street, which isactually where the back entrance of the factory is situated. He asked me if Iwould go with him, but I said that I didn’t feel I had any right to spy on hiswife, and he finally went off alone. As soon as I was sure he was out of thehouse, I rushed off to the telephone in the pub next door, and rang the factory.They refused to let me speak to Diana on the phone—said it was against the rulesto allow employees to use the office phone (lousy bastards, may they rot inhell), but that they’d give her a message if it was urgent. So I told them totell her that her husband was ill, and would like her to come home at lunchtime.My ruse worked. Half an hour later, Diana came running into the house, and hadnot seen Kirsten, who was probably waiting by the back entrance. As soon as shesaw me, she asked “Where is he? Is he all right?” and I explained quickly thatnothing was wrong with Kirsten except jealousy. We decided we’d better leave thehouse, in case he came back when he discovered she wasn’t there. So we walked toa café in Commercial Street.I couldn’t make up my mind whether this was a tragedy or a fortunate accident. Iwanted Kirsten to find out about Diana, but we were still as far from my realgoal—telling him about Diana and myself. Diana didn’t seem as upset as Iexpected. She said: “Oh, that. It’s all over.” I had to explain to her that thismight be the opportunity we wanted. If Kirsten should throw her out, we couldlive together. She said: “But he won’t throw me out.” “Why?” “Because he’s tooreliant on me.” “But if he’s reliant on you, why were you unfaithful to him?”“He was only reliant on me in some ways. Not at all in others.”Nevertheless, I felt that this was the time to make changes, if we intended tomake them. So I told her that she couldn’t go back to work, and that she didn’thave to go back to Kirsten at all. We could simply find ourselves a roomsomewhere else, and, with a little care, I would have enough money to supportus. The idea obviously appealed to her. (I’m sure that her life with Kirsten isbeginning to ruin her.) But she finally said that she couldn’t simply leave himwithout talking to him. And in spite of my persuasions, she insisted on goingback to work (even though she hadn’t eaten anything). However, she agreed thatshe would try to bring things to a head with Kirsten, and try to get himaccustomed to the idea that they should live apart. I managed to persuade her totake a few sandwiches back to work with her, and she went off.I immediately felt a sense of anticlimax, so I walked up to see Cunningham totell him what had happened.When I got there, I saw something that surprised me. Cunningham was still inbed, drinking lemon tea. Oliver was also in the room in a dressing gown. Thiswould not have struck me as in any way peculiar, except that Oliver becameviolently embarrassed when he saw me, made some excuse, and hurried out.Cunningham looked after him ironically. I also noticed that Oliver didn’t lookhis usual self; his eyes seem partly closed up, or perhaps they simply looked“faraway”—I didn’t have time to observe him closely and make up my mind. I’d bestartled to hear that Oliver had turned homosexual, but I wouldn’t blame himparticularly. I can hardly put any other interpretation on his embarrassmentwhen I appeared, unless he was simply embarrassed at being caught in hisdressing gown at one in the afternoon. And I doubt this.Yet when I remember some of the scathing things he once said about queers, Ifind it difficult to accept it. As to Cunningham, I’m sure he’s bisexual anyway;it’s impossible not to tell, from the way he treats me occasionally, that he’shad some homosexual experience.However, I didn’t raise this matter, but told Cunningham what had happened aboutDiana. He didn’t seem to understand me at first. He said: “But my dear boy, whynot let them work it out for themselves?” I explained that I thought this was asgood an opportunity as any to get Diana to break with Kirsten. “But why? Whyshouldn’t you simply continue as you are?” When I explained that I’d like tolive with Diana, he said, in a slightly shocked voice: “You’re not in love withher, I hope?” I said that I simply found her very attractive, and thought it apity she should stay with Kirsten. Cunningham then got out of bed. (I have yetto see a more repulsive sight than Cunningham naked; he has a lot of surplusfat, large, almost female breasts, and is covered with hair; he also smelledabominably of sweat and some musky kind of perfume.) He insisted that I come upwith him to the bathroom, and he talked to me while he took his shower. Afterthis, he powdered himself elaborately with talcum, sprayed himself with scent,and rubbed some kind of spirit into his genitals. (He gave me a short discourseon the health of the penis, explaining that it is, after all, almost the onlypart of the body that never sees the light of day, and never has a chance to getsunburned; then declared that savages who live naked are twice as potent as menwho wear trousers; hence Cunningham devotes special attention to his member,“toning it up” with pure alcohol and various other stimulants!) Meanwhile, Icould tell that this new development struck him as interesting. But his onlyconcern was whether it would upset Kirsten. When he’d finished dressing, hesaid: “Look, my boy, leave this in my hands. I will go to see Kirsten thisafternoon.” I asked him to be tactful, and he promised that he wouldn’t mentionwhat I’d told him.I went back home, meeting Oliver on the landing—he wouldn’t look at me. (Ithought this a good opportunity to mention that I’d seen Christine, but all hesaid was: “Oh good, give her my regards” as he vanished into his room!) When Igot into my own room, I found Kirsten waiting for me. He said that he’d waitedthere all through the lunch hour, but that Diana hadn’t emerged; I said that sheprobably stayed inside eating sandwiches. Kirsten was by this time in a prettyemotional state; I could see he’d been crying, and I felt miserable. I evendecided that, if necessary, I would give Diana up, and persuade Kirsten toforgive her. He began to reproach himself, said he’d never paid her enoughattention, and that it was disgraceful to allow her to work in such a place.(Evidently the squalor of the neighborhood had impressed him.)After twenty minutes of this, Cunningham arrived. We heard him knocking onKirsten’s door. I quickly asked Kirsten if he wanted to see Cunningham, and heshook his head. However, Cunningham bounded up the stairs. I must say he’s anexcellent actor—started to talk about some business, then stopped and asked: “Isanything wrong? Have I come at a bad time?” Kirsten looked sheepish, and Iexplained that he was upset about his wife. Cunningham got the cue immediately:“Why? Has she left you?” Kirsten didn’t need much encouragement to tell him thewhole story. I then saw a remarkable piece of “persuasion.” Cunningham listenedgravely, looked at the letters, and finally said: “My dear chap, I sympathizewith you. It must be rather a shock. But—don’t mind my being frank—I can’t helpthinking that you’re lucky.” Kirsten looked surprised, and Cunningham went on:“Don’t think that I dislike Diana—I don’t. I think she’s a delightful girl. Butis she the woman to share the life of an artist of your stature?” I could seeimmediately that he’d struck the right note. He went into the question of thewives of men of genius—Mozart’s Constance, Haydn’s Maria, Wagner’s Minna—andpointed out that most of them were catastrophic, or at least thoroughlyunsuitable, declared that Bach and Schumann were the only two great musicians tohave made suitable marriages, but still declared that Beethoven, Brahms andSchubert had been wisest in remaining single. It was, I suppose, a fairlyobvious form of flattery—to keep comparing Kirsten to Beethoven, etc—but itworked like magic. Kirsten’s eyes began to sparkle, his head lifted, and helooked like a war horse at the sound of a trumpet. Then Cunningham went on tospeak about the essential loneliness of greatness, to say that Beethoven couldnever have written the Hammerklavier and the Ninth symphony if he’d been happilymarried, and to declare his belief that men of genius must learn to accept theirdestiny, which is all arranged in advance by providence.Then, having got Kirsten into a state of exaltation, Cunningham said that he’dcome to tell him that the representative of a famous Washington opera societywas in London, and was anxious to hear the music of Varney the Vampire. This, ofcourse, completed the work of making Kirsten forget his upset. He mentioned thathe had just put the finishing touches to a Fantastic Overture, which he wasthinking of using for the Weir opera (when I supply the libretto!). Cunninghamimmediately demanded to hear it, and we all went on to see the orchestrion(although apparently Kirsten had made an arrangement not to use the warehouseduring the day, when his music is likely to distract the workmen). He collectedup sheets of disarranged music paper from all over the room, and we went.Luckily, the warehouse was empty, and I took the precaution of putting on twopairs of trousers and a woolen scarf, so the next hour was very enjoyable. TheFantastic Overture wasn’t entirely a success—partly because Kirsten couldn’tread his own writing, and often had to stop and work out what key he’d intended,partly because he put the music in the wrong order, and also because parts ofthe overture were supposed to be played on keys that he hadn’t yet installed onthe instrument. However, Cunningham demanded to hear pieces of Varney again, andKirsten needed no encouragement. I must admit that it sounded even moreimpressive than last time. I cannot see how the opera can fail, once it’sdecently performed. After this, Kirsten went on playing of his own accord—asonata for piano and violin which sounded excellent on the orchestrion, and thensome fragments of a witches’ sabbath that he’d written for Weir. We both praisedthem lavishly. At the end of an hour, someone came into the warehouse, andKirsten decided we’d better go. On the way home, he was singing us fragments ofhis compositions, outlining his plans for a three-part opera on the life ofBuddha, and talking about going to America to conduct Varney. When Cunninghammentioned Diana, his face fell, and it was obvious that the memory hurt him.Cunningham immediately began explaining that what he needs is a woman who isentirely devoted to him, who loves his music and cherishes his genius.As we turned the corner to go into the house, we saw Diana coming from the otherend of the street. We waited for her, and she and Kirsten went up the stairsfirst. She looked so nervous that it was obvious that she knew something was inthe wind, but I don’t think Kirsten noticed. Cunningham and I watched them gointo her room, and then went on up to my room. I expected to hear raised voices,but not a sound came from their room. Cunningham looked absurdly pleased withhimself.I produced some wine—not very good stuff, but standing it in a bowl of warmwater for five minutes improved it slightly—and we sat and talked. Cunninghamlit a cigarette, and said: “It’s strange, my dear Gerard, how easily ouremotions can be influenced.” The way he said “My dear Gerard ... ” and threwaway the match reminded me of Austin, and I must have stared at him in an oddway, because he asked me what the matter was. I said he reminded me of a friend,and mentioned Austin’s name. He immediately asked me to tell him more aboutAustin, saying that Oliver had mentioned the name several times. I feltembarrassed about this; I didn’t want to be drawn into speaking about Austin.(His father spent half an hour impressing on me the importance of absolute andtotal silence about him, and since he concluded the lecture by handing me thecheck, I feel under a certain obligation to keep my word.) Luckily, as soon as Imentioned that Austin was homosexual, Cunningham was sidetracked; he evidentlythought this was what I meant, and said quite openly: “But then, I’m notcompletely homosexual, of course.” I assured him that this wasn’t what I meant,but the discussion then turned to homosexuality, and I was glad to have gottenaway from the subject of Austin. He asked me if I was bisexual; I said no, andadmitted that I have so little homosexuality in my composition that I’m totallybaffled by the phenomenon—I simply can’t imagine how a man could find anotherman attractive. Cunningham declared that this is so in a few people—their sexualimpulses are like a river that runs in a very narrow and deep gorge, and cannever overflow in any other direction, no matter how high they rise. His ownimpulses, he said, have always been for the most part heterosexual, but if heever reached an intense peak of sexual frustration, he could satisfy himself onman, woman, child or animal.By this time we’d emptied one bottle of wine and opened another, and it wasobvious to me that he was in the mood for self-revelation. So I kept firingquestions at him. The story of how he first developed a taste for homosexualitystrikes me as interesting. When he was 18, and had only just gone up to Oxford,he fell violently in love with a waitress—a small girl, not conventionallypretty, but with lovely eyes and a boyish body. For several weeks he pursued herwith gifts and poems, and she finally gave herself to him. He was so crazy abouther by this time that he decided he must marry her as soon as he could getpermission from his guardian, or when he was 21. She declared that she wouldnever leave him, and allowed him to take a cottage for her just outside thetown, where he spent all his free hours with her. For six months they wereecstatically happy; then one day, he discovered that she was in the habit ofbetraying him. She was a nymphomaniac who had to keep having sex as often as shecould get it. As a waitress in a café, with a cottage of her own and a lover whocould only call at certain hours, she had plenty of opportunity, and even sleptwith the milkman. In fact, it was with the milkman that Cunningham actuallycaught her in the act. They were not even in bed, but in the kitchen, againstthe table. When she knew there was no point in lying, she was completely frank,and admitted that on one occasion, she had even had sex with the baker in theoutside lavatory while Cunningham was lying in her bed, waiting for her to bringhim a cup of tea! The need for haste and the possibility of being caught onlymade her enjoy it more.Cunningham was overwhelmed; he wanted to kill her. He was insanely in love withher, and her infidelities made no difference; in a way, they only made her moredesirable. Yet he knew he could never bear to stay with her. It was the end ofterm; he went to Scotland and tried to forget her; it was impossible. He went toLondon and tried sleeping with prostitutes; he found them loathsome, althoughthis was by no means his first experience. He said that he found the majority ofwomen detestable because they were so unlike her; but when a girl reminded himof her, this was even worse, because it brought back her infidelities.For weeks he was tormented. Then one evening, at a friend’s party, he lookedacross the room, and met a pair of large, dark eyes in a pale face. Instantly,he felt weak and shattered; he knew that he was in love again. The eyes hadlooked at him in a way that told him that nothing could prevent their comingtogether. He finally gained enough strength to push his way across the room, andfound the beloved talking to their host. And it was a man. Cunningham said thatat first he was horrified. (His upbringing had been strictly religious, andalthough he thought himself “emancipated,” he was still easily shockable.) Butas soon as he began to talk to the stranger—whose name was Roddy—he realizedthat this made no difference. Two hours later, they left the party together.Roddy had a cottage at Stratford; they drove there through the night, arrivingat dawn, staggered into the house, and immediately tumbled into bed. They stayedthere for a fortnight, with brief visits to the local shops for food! Roddy wasalso at Oxford, and they returned together the following term. His nymphomaniacwaitress was still working in the same café and living in the same cottage; twomonths before, he would not have believed it possible that he could return toOxford and be indifferent to her presence. But he was. The affair with Roddylasted only a few weeks, but when it was over, Cunningham was completely curedof his earlier love affair.I asked Cunningham if he had had any exclusively homosexual periods since then.He said only one, just after the war, in London, when he had suffered a greatdisappointment. (He did not specify what this was.) He suddenly decided that hewould wash it out of his system with a period of promiscuity, and for a year hadfrequented homosexual clubs and taken satisfaction wherever he could find it. Hesaid that he found most satisfaction when it was unexpected and in completelyunsuitable surroundings, and suddenly was able to understand his nymphomaniacwaitress in Oxford. He said he soon discovered that there were a largeproportion of homosexuals among taxi drivers, railway porters andwindow-cleaners. He found that a completely frank approach was usually best. Forexample, one day a young window-cleaner was washing the outside of the windows,sitting on the windowsill with his legs in the room. Cunningham started tounbutton his trousers, and when the man looked startled, said: “Look, I’mawfully sorry, but I have an irresistible impulse to make love to you.” The mansaid cheerfully: “That’s all right guv, you go ahead,” and went on cleaning thewindow!It had been about an hour and a half since we left Kirsten outside his door. NowKirsten came in, looking very pleased with himself, and announced: “She’s gone.”“Gone?” I asked. “Where to?” “The other man.” He said that it hadn’t been anangry meeting; she was very quiet and reasonable, and told him that she foundhim too distant and detached, and that when another man had showed sympathy, shehad found it irresistible. She felt that he didn’t need her. (All this, ofcourse, was exactly the right approach—to confirm Kirsten’s feeling of being a“man on his own,” a genius with his head in the clouds and no time for women.)Finally, Kirsten said generously that he was willing to let her go, if she wassure the other man loved her. She admitted that she wasn’t sure of this. Kirstenthen rose to heights of unselfishness, and told her to go and see “the otherman,” explain the situation to him and ask him if he was willing to marry her.If he refused, then she could return to Kirsten, and he would take her backwithout recalling their past differences. (This made me smile. Since Diana isvirtually supporting him at present, his gesture loses a lot of its effect!) SoDiana had gone out.Cunningham immediately proposed that we should go back to his place, but I saidI felt tired and would stay behind. Kirsten and Cunningham went off, and I layon the bed, and tried to restrain my impatience. This was almost impossible; Iwas in a fever to find out what she intended to do. Finally, after an hour, shecame in and came up to my room. She looked very tired. I made her take her coatoff and get into bed—not from sexual motives, but because the poor child lookedso miserable. She told me she had been walking around in the park, hoping thatKirsten would go out so she could talk to me. I made her tea and cooked her somefrankfurters and eggs, and she began to improve. (She hadn’t eaten all day,having been too upset during the afternoon to eat her sandwiches.) It seemed tome that everything was now very simple. She can see that Kirsten isn’t going tobe broken-hearted about her; her affair with the bookmaker type is at an end.There’s nothing to stop us from simply living together. She seemed unhappy andunsure, but too tired to make any resistance. So when she’d eaten, I locked thedoor securely, turned off the lights (in case Kirsten should try and come in)and got into bed with her. We lay there with the electric fire on, the radioplaying a Bach concert very low, and not even making any attempt to make love. Isaid: “This is your first evening as my wife instead of Kirsten’s.” She saidthere were a lot of difficulties ahead, and I said it didn’t matter if shereally wanted to live with me. Then suddenly I realized I was on the point ofsaying: “If you don’t betray me as you betrayed Kirsten,” and had to stopmyself. I understand now what Cunningham meant about betrayal. When Diana wasKirsten’s wife, I didn’t give a damn about the bookmaker type, and when sheslept with me, I felt pleased because I was making her unfaithful to two men.Now I feel she’s mine, and immediately feel uncertain. But there’s no point inthinking too much about this.So that is what has happened. Diana insisted on getting up and going to workthis morning. She says she’ll work until the weekend, to get her paycheck, butwill give notice today. I tried to make her see that the miserable two or threepounds she’ll draw are unimportant, and that it doesn’t matter if she doesn’tbother to collect them. But years of half starving have made her cautious, andshe went off at half past seven this morning, going downstairs in her stockingfeet in case Kirsten should recognize her step. And I am now left with theproblem of what I intend to do. I wonder if Cunningham could persuade Kirsten tomove out of his room? It is obviously impossible for Diana to move in here withKirsten in the room below. On the other hand, if we could manage to avoidKirsten for a few weeks, something might be done ...Nov. 25. Things are, in fact, working out unexpectedly well. Cunningham hasoffered Kirsten a room in their place—they have an attic above Cunningham’sroom. Kirsten has already given notice and has started to move his things out.We had a tense moment last night when Kirsten knocked on my door after Diana andI had gone to bed. He had a message for me from Cunningham, so I had to let himin, and Diana had to rush into the bathroom in case Kirsten looked into thebedroom. The message was to tell me that an old associate of Cunningham’s was intown, and to ask me to go and meet him today. Kirsten had spent the evening withhim, and been much impressed by him as a sincere and honest man.Kirsten then went on to talk about the room that Cunningham had offered him,then about Diana (whom he presumes to have gone back to her bookmaker, since hehasn’t heard from her). He was evidently inclined to stay all night, but asDiana was sitting uncomfortably on the edge of the bathtub with no clothes on, Ihad to be fairly brusque, and tell him that I had a headache and wanted to getback to bed. At this moment, unfortunately, Diana managed to knock the plug intothe tub. Kirsten looked startled, then smiled knowingly, said “My apologies,”and left. I immediately felt an utter swine. However, I want Diana so badly thatI don’t let this worry me too much.I’m amazed when I examine my feelings about her. In a quarrelsome mood, Gertrudeonce accused me of being incapable of any deep feeling for anyone. As far asGertrude is concerned, this is true enough. I think that my feeling about Dianamay be partly protective—she seems to have had so little out of life, and todeserve so much. And yet ever since I’ve known her, I’ve had an instinct thattold me to grab her, as if I instantly recognized someone I could live with andspend a lifetime with. How far this is a real perception, I don’t know. It’s afairly new experience for me.Later. I went to see Cunningham, as he suggested, and was directed to phone hisfriend, who is called Tim Wedmore, at the Regent Palace Hotel. I did, and heimmediately asked me if I could come and have lunch with him. I didn’t much wantto: I’ve started to work on the Weir libretto, and wanted to spend the day onit; but he sounded so friendly that I agreed. He is on his way to California,flying tomorrow, so there wouldn’t be another opportunity.He turned out to be a big, well-fed man in his fifties, with a craggy baldforehead, very pale blue eyes, and a sensuous mouth. He’s a Scot who went to NewZealand to farm sheep, and made a decent lot of money. During the war, when hewas in the army, he read a book by Cunningham, and immediately wrote to him. Theresult was that he went to live with Cunningham immediately after the war on the“island,” and became a fervent disciple.On my way to the hotel, I wondered about Cunningham’s motives in introducing meto Wedmore; I soon found out. Wedmore also worships Cunningham; and since he’s ashrewd and intelligent man, his enthusiasm is contagious. We had lunch up inWedmore’s room—he wanted to be able to talk without interruption. He began bysaying that he had heard I was a great writer, and would probably be able tomake Cunningham’s work known to thousands of people. I modestly disclaimed allthis, but it was obvious that Wedmore was determined to regard me as a friendand ally.The story he told me while we ate was as startling as anything in Varieties ofReligious Experience. The trouble, Wedmore said, was that he was a man of strongfeelings and instincts, quick tempered, highly sexed, but with a background ofScotch Presbyterianism that gives him a naturally gloomy and mistrustful outlookon the world. As a sheep farmer, he read Plato and the Upanishads, and meditatedon the problem of why God made the world with so much evil in it. He had ahalf-caste girl on his farm with whom he had sexual relations when he was athome, but during the weeks when he was riding over distant parts of his land, headmitted to a strong temptation to use the sheep to satisfy his desires. He washorrified by this streak of bestiality in him. He did not care for thehalf-caste girl, but found her physically exciting. On the other hand, he knew aschoolteacher who attracted him, and often thought of marrying her; but he wasreasonably certain that she would not satisfy him physically, even if she wouldmake an excellent wife in other ways. It was at this point that he read a bookby Cunningham (called The Voice of Baphomet) in which Cunningham spoke abouttechniques for being able to see into one’s previous incarnations, and declaredthat no man could ever understand himself or be completely free fromself-division unless he knew about past incarnations, and learned exactly how hecame to develop his present characteristics. He wrote to Cunningham, mentioningthat he was a fairly rich sheep farmer. The result was an irregularcorrespondence that led to an invitation to Cunningham’s island off the coast ofSardinia.Wedmore said he was in a pretty bad way when he accepted the invitation. He hadspent the last year of the war in a Japanese prison camp, and seen some prettyawful things. He felt a consuming hatred of the Japanese for some of theatrocities he had seen, and was obsessed by the idea that the whole Japaneserace must be destroyed before we can hope for world peace. Yet his religiousideas made him feel that this thought was evil. So he was pitifully self-dividedwhen Cunningham met him at the boat and arranged the trip out to the island.At first, he was shocked by Cunningham’s farm. To begin with, Cunningham made nosecret of having sexual relations with two young Indian boys who acted asservants, as well as with a skinny American girl. The walls of the house werecovered with designs of erect phalli, and marijuana cigarettes and dishes ofcocaine lay around the place for anyone to take. Cunningham was engaged inmagical researches which involved killing a cat, and hanging crucified toads onan inverted crucifix. At first, Wedmore was completely bewildered, and thoughtthat he had fallen in with a madman. Soon after he arrived, more visitorscame—various eccentrics of the international set who seemed to be out to throwoff all restraint. Cunningham declared that his true disciples would be willingto prostitute their bodies to anyone who should ask; most of the guests promptlydeclared themselves his true disciples, and made this an excuse for a sexualorgy. Wedmore himself was attracted to a slim, quiet girl who had come as thecompanion of a Greek banker, and one afternoon he possessed her on the beachafter they had been bathing. That evening at supper, heated by wine and drugs,some of the guests proceeded to have sex at the table, declaring that thepleasures of food and of love should be mixed. Then, to Wedmore’s horror, his“quiet, slim girl” tore open his trousers, and proposed that they should performvarious sexual acts on the table while the others ate. Wedmore rushed out of theroom and went to the beach; he wanted to leave the island immediately, but couldnot find a boat.Late that night he was sitting on the beach, shivering, when Cunningham and hismistress arrived. Cunningham came over to him, and told him that he now proposedto initiate him into some of the great secrets. Cunningham then explained to himthat his trouble was simple: he had always been afraid of his subconscious mind,not realizing that it contained the dark mystery of his true self. Cunninghamexpounded his views for about five minutes, declaring that the conscious self isnothing more than the upper layer of the subconscious being. The consciouscannot have any will of its own, and it is impossible to be good or virtuousfrom purely conscious direction. The problem is to relax and allow thesubconscious to encroach on the conscious, bringing its life-giving forces, andrevealing its will. At the bottom of the subconscious, Cunningham said, is themeaning of all life, the purpose that drives us and grants us life. It must beencouraged to rise and express its will.Cunningham then proposed that they go for a swim, but Wedmore was too excited.He stayed where he was, and watched the others swimming in the moonlight. Theythen came out of the water and copulated openly on the sand. Suddenly, Wedmoresaid, he understood the full grandeur of Cunningham’s conception. Cunninghamwanted to shock people like himself and arouse doubts in their minds becausetruth itself is a paradox; he took an ironic pleasure in seeing them strugglingwith despair when he himself was in permanent contact with the truth, and knewthat they could reach it too with a very slight effort of will.That night, Wedmore said, he felt as if he was being torn in two. He tried tokneel down and pray, but thought he heard a voice shout: “Don’t do that, youfool, or you’re lost.” He went out and walked over the island, cutting his barefeet badly on the stones, but not even noticing this. Something inside him keptsaying: “I have discovered the truth, but perhaps it is too late. I have alreadydestroyed too much of myself.” He realized that his religious training—eventhough he had been an avowed atheist since his fifteenth year—had given him atendency to believe that only the conscious motives mattered. He felt that if,on the day of judgment, he were accused of being a sink of filth and lust, hewould be able to reply: “But I fought it with all my will power.” He haddeveloped a very considerable will power for suppressing his “lust.” Now, quitesuddenly, he was told to try to listen to the voice of his lust and all theother obscure impulses from “down there,” to decide how he should live. Butyears of repressing these feelings had made him incapable of treating theseimpulses as friends; he had been regarding them as enemies for too long. Thisknowledge made him feel as if he were suffocating.For two days he went through a great crisis, sometimes praying, sometimesthinking about his past problems and how easily he might have solved them if hehad known about his “true self.” Finally, the squealing and giggling of theother guests drove him to the other side of the island (which I gather is only afew hundred yards across), where he had a sense of tremendous greatness, ofstanding on a mountain top. He realized that Cunningham was the only one whoshared this greatness with him. All the others were there from base motives.Their orgies were not the prompting of their “true will,” but self-conscioustitillations that were only a temporary escape from their littleness. He feltthat he had released something in himself that made him feel as great as amountain or a giant; he was aware of subconscious powers as vast as the sea.This sense of his own limitlessness—that he had never before recognized—tookaway his breath. He said that he suddenly realized he had been living in a tiny,cold room when he had a whole palace at his disposal.He now began to feel feverish excitement. He took advantage of the lax rules ofthe place to have sexual intercourse with every woman there. He even tried thetwo boys. This aroused the resentment of the Greek, and one of the Rome playboysinsulted him and tried to get him to fight a duel. But he felt so superior tothem that he only laughed, and pulled their girls into bed again. The Greek leftin a rage with his girl (who was most reluctant). Wedmore now had a tremendousreaction of disgust and bewilderment; he begged Cunningham to initiate him intothe innermost mysteries, but Cunningham laughed and said that he was an ignorantpeasant. He decided that he must return to New Zealand. But on his last eveningthere, Cunningham projected his astral body so that it shared Wedmore’s body,and Wedmore was aware of being able to read all Cunningham’s thoughts and hispast history, and also of revealing himself completely to Cunningham. Thatnight, he had an exceptionally vivid dream in which he was a London papermerchant on his deathbed. The dream seemed to progress backwards in a series ofscenes, and when he woke up, he was dreaming that he was witnessing thecoronation of Queen Victoria. He knew, even before he spoke to Cunningham, thathe had now penetrated into his last incarnation, the London businessman who hadalways had an urge to enter a monastery, and who died of cancer at the age of50. When he told Cunningham, Cunningham replied that he was now beginning togain control of his subconscious impulses, and would eventually learn about allhis previous incarnations.Wedmore went back to New Zealand, but now he was a disciple of Cunningham. Hesent him money regularly, had established a Cunningham society in Auckland, andwas now going to California to preach the Master’s doctrines there.What amused me was that Wedmore was still the shrewd and wide-awake Scotchbusinessman. He had sold his farm, and invested the money in such a way as toensure that he would have enough to last him for the rest of his life, which hewould devote to spreading Cunningham’s ideas. Cunningham had tried to persuadehim that he would do better to stay in New Zealand and continue to farm. Wedmorewinked, and said: “I know what he’s after. With things as they are at present, Ineed all my money for travel and living expenses. If I stayed on in New Zealand,I’d have money to give Cunningham, and that’s what he’d prefer. But I’d rathertravel!” So in spite of his enthusiasm, he has no illusions about Cunningham!What interested me most was all the talk about magical ceremony. This isobviously an aspect of Cunningham that I have yet to see.Wedmore told me, incidentally, that two of the women in Cunningham’s life hadcommitted suicide, having increased their mental instability with drugs. Drugsapparently do not affect Cunningham, and he claims he can use them and give themup exactly as he pleases.I told Wedmore something about myself, my ideas, my ambitions. He seemedpuzzled; evidently I am too much of an “intellectual” to appeal to histemperament. He finally said: “Well, you must have some remarkable qualities, orCunningham wouldn’t have spoken of you as he has.” I didn’t know whether thiswas flattery or an expression of disappointment.I ended by saying that I thought magic was nonsense. Then Wedmore said,ponderously: “Magic is only an attempt to invoke the force of life. All life ismagic already.” This struck me more than anything else he said to me.As I left, I told him Wise’s idea that Cunningham has exposed himself tospiritual reprisals for breaking some oaths. I expected him to deny this, but tomy surprise, he nodded, and said: “I have sometimes thought the same. He isdogged by the most appalling bad luck. Still, all great prophets have to gothrough trials and torments ... ”Nov. 26. Yesterday evening was curious, but I am too tired to write about it atlength. I must stop this writing; it leaves me exhausted, and I sometimes feelas if I’m writing my life instead of living it.Kirsten met Diana on the stairs when she came home from work. Naturally, hethought she was coming to see him, and she didn’t want to disillusion him. Shetold him that she was coming to collect some of her clothes, and that she wasliving alone for the time being. Kirsten told her he was moving, and she finallyhit upon the excellent idea of storing her clothes in my flat until she finds apermanent place of her own. This means that she can be seen coming into my placenow without arousing suspicion. So Kirsten and she moved several bags andsuitcases up here, and now the place is littered with all kinds of women’sbelongings. She let him understand that the liaison with the bookmaker iscontinuing, and this seems to satisfy him, although I think he is now permittinghimself the sentimental pleasure of imagining that he’s unhappy about it.Later we went up to Cunningham’s, and found him in a most weird mood. I thinkhe’d been taking drugs. As soon as Diana came in, he declared that she wasgiving off “psychic vibrations” and that he suspected her of being a medium. Hemade her sit down, gave her a large gin, then made Oliver bring up one of hispaintings—an abstraction which looks as if its central object is the sun. He setthis up on an armchair, illuminated by a table lamp, and made her stare at it,while he slowly stroked her forehead. In about two minutes she seemed to beasleep. Then he asked her where she was. She answered, in a rather monotonousvoice: “Here, in this house.” He said: “Have you any message for me?,” and shesaid: “No message. This house is full of evil.” I felt myself shivering—therewas something oddly impressive about it, although it wasn’t at all theatrical—infact, it seemed somehow as commonplace as asking her questions while fullyawake.Cunningham said: “What is the evil?,” and she replied: “It is the evil ofdisplaced energy.” (I saw Cunningham look puzzled at this; he asked her toelaborate, but she didn’t reply.) I can’t detail all the questions and answers.Some of them seemed meaningless to me. He would ask something like: “What is themeaning of Seven hundred and twenty-six?,” and she would reply: “I see two menclothed in red.” I strongly suspected her of pulling his leg and only pretendingto be in a trance.Finally, Cunningham asked her again: “What is the evil?,” and she replied: “Itis the force of Seven hundred and twenty-six who intends to destroy your work.”At this, Cunningham went unexpectedly pale, and sat down. This made me realizethat, at least as far as he was concerned, the thing was no joke. Then he asked,rather shakily: “Can I do anything to prevent it?” and she replied: “Not unlessthe forces have forgiven you.” “Can I do anything to hasten this?” “Yes. Learnto live from your center.” He asked her for further details, but all she wouldsay was: “There is one in the room who understands.”Cunningham seemed strangely upset by this. He said: “I am going to awaken younow. When you are awake, you will remember nothing of what you have said.” Hestarted to make passes over her forehead, when Kirsten interrupted him, andasked if she were bound to tell the truth in her state of trance. Cunninghamsaid yes. Kirsten then asked if he could ask her questions. I wanted tointerfere—this seemed to me unfair—then realized that my indignation arose froma sense that Diana was, in some sense, mine, and that I could hardly expectKirsten to understand this! So I had to keep quiet. But all he asked her was:“Are you in love with someone else?” She answered immediately: “Yes.” He asked,“Have you betrayed me with him?,” and again she answered, “Yes.” I was now ontenterhooks; it seemed impossible that he would not now ask her the name of herlover. But Kirsten simply sat down gloomily, and said to Cunningham: “That’s allI wanted to know.”Cunningham’s face surprised me; he looked more downcast than I’ve ever seen him.He made passes over her forehead, and she woke up and didn’t seem at all curiousabout what had gone on while she was asleep. Then Cunningham asked us if we’dmind going downstairs to Oliver’s studio for a while, as he wanted to be alone.So we went. Oliver was working, but didn’t seem to resent the interruption. Heasked: “Did it work?,” and when Kirsten said (rather unhappily) that it had, helooked pleased with himself, and said that he’d painted the picture upstairs toCunningham’s specifications. I asked him how Cunningham could “describe” anabstract painting as complex as the one we’d seen, and he replied: “He didn’tdescribe it—he showed it to me. He made me close my eyes, placed his hands on myhead, and suddenly I saw exactly what he wanted.” Kirsten shook his head andsaid: “That man is a black magician.” Then, to my amazement, Diana gasped, andwent horribly pale. We helped her into a chair. She looked at Kirsten and said:“What you said ... it reminded me of something.” Then she looked around,shivered, and said: “There is evil in this house.” Oliver said cheerfully: “Oh,I don’t think so. I find the atmosphere helps me to work.” I could see hispoint. His new paintings were very powerful indeed, full of that quality ofatmosphere that Oliver has always possessed, which seems to have nothing to dowith anything specific in the painting, but almost to have been addedafterwards, like the varnish.Cunningham called to me to go upstairs. I found him sitting in the chair, nowlooking definitely ill. I asked him if I could get him anything, but he shookhis head, and said: “This is not a physical illness. That girl has made merealize that I’ve got a hard fight ahead.” I tried to make him explain himself.But all he would say was: “There are forces that want to kill me. They won’tsucceed.” This all sounded to me like nonsensical superstition. He sat there,staring at Oliver’s painting, and wouldn’t talk, so I helped myself to a gin andsat down. Then he said: “It’s a great pity. One imagines that one has brokenthrough at last ... into the daylight. Then the darkness comes again.” Then, foranother quarter of an hour, he didn’t speak at all. Finally, he said: “Gerard,perhaps you can help me. That girl’s a bad medium. Her own personality getsmixed up with the message. But if I could hypnotize you, you might be able totell me how to defeat them.” I said. “All right, if you think it’s worthtrying.” He said: “No, not now. At midnight.” He then became more cheerful andwe went down and joined the others. He suggested that we go out for a meal, andall five of us walked out toward Whitechapel High Street. On the way, we passedthe end of our street, and to my amazement I saw Gertrude’s blue Consul parkedoutside my door. I explained to them that I thought I had a visitor—this was outof a sense of duty, for I shrank from the idea of meeting her at the moment. Sowe all went up to my room, and found Gertrude sitting in the armchair, readingmy book on Weir. Apparently she’d seen Father O’Mahoney during the afternoon,and he had mentioned seeing me in a taxicab with Radin and—believe it ornot—said I looked unhappy! (How the devil you can see unhappiness through twopanes of glass, I don’t know.)I introduced her to everyone; as soon as she spoke to Diana, I felt that shesmelled out her connection with me—or at least, saw her as a rival. Evenintroducing Diana as Mrs. Kirsten made no difference. (On second thought, nodoubt it was the presence of Diana’s suitcases that made her suspicious.)She was obviously pleased to see Oliver again, and put herself out to be nice tohim. I suggested that she should join us for a meal, and we all went off in hercar to the Chinese restaurant. She didn’t ask me why I hadn’t been to see her,and I had a feeling that she hadn’t wanted me to go. One thing she said made mecurious. She mentioned that Father O’Mahoney seems to have made a remarkablerecovery and is now moving around a great deal. I asked her innocently why she’dbeen to see him, and she colored. Oliver said cheerfully: “You’re not thinkingof becoming a Catholic, are you?,” and to my surprise, she said: “Would that beso strange?”Cunningham took this up immediately, and began telling her that she couldn’ttake a better step. This startled me, coming from him, but it evidentlydelighted Gertrude, who immediately launched into an intimate conversation withCunningham—as intimate, that is, as a dinner table will permit. They sat at theend, and talked as if the rest of us weren’t present.We left at about eleven. I insisted on paying for Kirsten and Diana, for I’mtired of taking meals off Cunningham (and realizing that they’re paid for withOliver’s money.) Gertrude then said she should go home, but Cunningham persuadedher to come back to his place to have her fortune read in the Tarot pack. Sheexplained that she didn’t believe in it, but came nevertheless. We all went intoOliver’s studio again—it is bigger, and has more chairs than Cunningham’s—andCunningham shuffled the Tarot cards, selected one that was supposed to stand forGertrude, and laid out ten cards. He then read the interpretation of the cardsout of a book by Eliphaz Levi. I could see that Gertrude was impressed. Shelooked embarrassed and confused when Cunningham claimed that the cards revealedan element of sensuality in her past life (Diana shot me an odd look—I wondersometimes if she’s clairvoyant). But the card that represented her futurewas—the Pope! Cunningham then declared that they would cross-check the resultsby consulting the I Ching, and brought out three Chinese coins with holes in themiddle, which he made Gertrude throw down six times. Each time she threw, hedrew a line—either broken or unbroken. He then looked up the result, and againproduced a result that was weirdly close to the reading in the Tarot. The booksaid that Gertrude was to be “given in marriage,” which symbolizes a religiouscommitment, and gave various other details of her past and future, including“loss of maidenly virture,” all of which startled her.Diana very sensibly slipped off, saying that she had to go home; I had given hera spare key to my flat, so she was able to let herself in. Gertrude andCunningham got into a discussion of magic, in which she expressed herselfstrongly about the wickedness of such superstitions. This had the effect ofrather spoiling the pleasant rapport between them. She finally left, but told methat she might come and see me soon; I got the impression that she had somethingon her mind. Finally, as midnight struck, Cunningham asked me to go up to hisroom. The first thing he asked me to do was to consult the Tarot for him. I didthis under his instructions, and the results did not reassure him. The cardrepresenting his future was a tower collapsing, with people falling out of it.The card representing himself was—the Devil! And the card representing his“final end” indicated absolution and repentance, followed by a restoration ofgrace.Cunningham became extremely depressed, and said: “It seems that the time ofrevelations has arrived.” He said that there are certain times when the futureis completely opaque, and others when it can be divined to a certain extent. Thepresent, he said, was the opposite extreme from the opaque—complete clarity—andit would be necessary to take advantage of it while it lasted.He then said that he proposed to try to hypnotize me, and that I should do mybest to help him by relaxing my will completely. He also offered various otherinstructions, which I can’t be bothered to detail. At all events, the wholething was a failure. I was tired enough—I could barely keep my eyes open—butstaring at the illuminated picture of Oliver’s only seemed to make me moreawake. Cunningham tried swinging a bright silver medallion in front of my eyes,and stroking my forehead from behind, but it made absolutely no difference. Mymind had never felt clearer and more sceptical. At one point, I thought I was“going off,” but I was only getting sleepy, and suddenly woke up with a start.After half an hour of this, Cunningham looked very tired. He said it wasobviously no use going on, and that perhaps he might be able to hypnotizeOliver. He said he was puzzled about me—that he had a definite feeling I wouldbe an excellent medium, but that there was something in my personality that hehad left out of account.So I went home, leaving Oliver with Cunningham. Kirsten walked back with me; hewas wide awake, and talked nonstop about music being the first of the magicarts, etc. He wanted to come up to my room, or me to go into his, but I said Iwas too sleepy.In fact, Diana was fast asleep when I got in, and I simply climbed in besideher, and went off to sleep myself. But two hours later I woke up in a fever ofdesire, and made love to her several times. I was startled by the intensity ofmy own need for her—it was as if my mind had been cleared of all distractions sothat I could suddenly grasp how much she means to me.Nov. 27. Strange things are happening over at Cunningham’s. I helped Kirstenmove some of his stuff over there this afternoon. We didn’t intend to disturbCunningham, but the door of the upstairs room was locked, and Oliver was out, sothere was no alternative but to knock on Cunningham’s door. We could hearsomeone moving around inside. Finally, he opened it, and the most awful smellcame out—incense mixed with burnt meat—and Cunningham himself was wearing apeculiar black robe with a hood. Either his eyes were very tired, or he wasunder the influence of some drug. He handed me the key without looking at meproperly, and slammed the door again.Later. I was writing the above when Gertrude arrived. She seemed to be in astrange mood, and said casually that everything was now over between us. I had afeeling that she wanted me to deny this, give her reasons for making her changeher mind, but that she was unable to say so. When she’s with me, I realize thatshe has a curious power of exciting me sexually—far greater, in its way, thanCaroline ever had. This I suppose to be due to her air of separateness, a kindof inner reserve that she couldn’t abandon no matter how hard she tried. Dianalacks this; I sometimes feel that when she gives her body, she has no awarenessof giving something of importance; it is something she hardly values.Consequently, sex with Diana never produces a feeling of violation, ofovercoming obstacles; Diana has a capacity for giving herself so completely thatshe seems to dissolve into oneself. This satisfies me emotionally and gives heran absolute hold over me. Gertrude can never give herself to the same extent;but the consequence is that she arouses far more straightforward animal lust inme.Still, it was obvious to me from the beginning that Gertrude has nosed out whatis going on with Diana. I naturally felt reluctant to talk of it to her—it wouldseem too much like gloating over a new mistress. She asked me bluntly whyDiana’s clothes were all over the place. I explained that she and Kirsten hadbroken up. She then asked me why Diana’s stockings were on the bathroom floor,and I had to admit that she was staying here. She then said rather coldly: “Youdon’t have to lie to me about these things; what about her husband?” When I toldher the story of Diana and the bookmaker type, her nose wrinkled with disgust.It was obvious she had difficulty in preventing herself from saying: “Oh, she’sthat kind of a woman, is she?” (Women have the most phenomenal capacity forseeing other women as they want to see them; their capacity for distortion is sogreat that it’s a good thing there have never been any women philosophers.)I was interested in her indignation about Diana. I wanted to ask her about herstandards of morality, that allowed her to go to bed with me, yet condemnedDiana for escaping from an unsatisfactory marriage. But she steered clear ofthis, and said that she thought Kirsten needed to be taken care of. Thinkingthat this might give a new direction to her interests, I started to talk aboutKirsten, said that I was convinced of his genius, and then gave her a briefcharacter sketch, emphasizing that Kirsten is too abstracted and otherworldly tomake a satisfactory husband. Then Gertrude suddenly declared that she wasconvinced that Cunningham was an evil influence; I wasn’t prepared for this,since they seemed to get on perfectly last night. When I pressed her to be moreexplicit, she said: “I haven’t met many evil persons in my lifetime, but I havea feeling that he is actively evil.” This gave me a sense of despair—it isuseless trying to talk to Gertrude about certain things; she has an absolutelyclosed mind. I couldn’t make her see that Cunningham is probably much like therest of us—a man who doesn’t really feel very much at home or very secure in theworld, who has an unusual amount of vitality, but is strangely weak in purpose.This now seems to me to be the truth. I understand what Diana meant in hertrance when she said that he doesn’t live from his center. I myself am uncertainwhat I ought to do with my life—I call myself a writer because this seems aboutthe most plausible of my notions of myself; but I feel no sense of destiny as awriter, as I think Shakespeare and Dickens probably did. And yet I undoubtedlyhave a kind of magnet at my center which, whether I like it or not, draws all myenergies into a knot, so that all my living seems to me a constant effort in acertain direction—even though I couldn’t define that direction. I believe thisalso applies to Oliver and Kirsten. But I feel it does not apply to Cunningham,any more than it applied to Austin. I feel there is something oddly pathetic inall this talk about magic—even if there is something in it. I find thisdifficult to express—but it seems to me like the way that very young animals tryto suck at any object that reminds them of the mother’s teat, but don’t succeedin getting milk! I think Cunningham is right to be jealous of Spender, Isherwoodand the others. He possesses as much talent as anyone of that generation; theonly trouble is that he has never learned to keep it concentrated on onepurpose. The result, I think, is that he has come to compromise more and more ashe’s got older, and many of his compromises have probably been bad—in the moralsense. But I don’t find evil in him; only weakness.Of course, I suspect that Gertrude is aware of the atmosphere of sexuality thathe exudes. This is something I have become steadily more aware of over the pastfew days—almost as if he wanted to drop the concealments and show himself to mein full. But this only deepens my sense of his weakness. He is a victim of thesexual confidence trick. It is obvious that every girl represents a challenge tohim, a privacy, a self-enclosed identity, and that his immediate desire is totear off her clothes, drive his assault weapon into her, and say “There, takethat, you bitch.” Then, with a satisfied grin, he can make another entry in hisbook of sexual conquests. I sympathize with this; I recognize the same urge inmyself. Yet, carried on in this spirit, it is finally a self-frustratingactivity, like killing flies in summer; no matter how many you kill, there arestill billions left in the world, and they are ineradicable; they’ve existed formillions of years, and will probably still exist when the world comes to an end.So this continual conquest is like drinking vinegar to quench your thirst.Wedmore told me a story that didn’t strike me as important at the time.Cunningham had sex with every woman in the house during the period that Wedmorewas there; many of them obviously wanted to continue sharing his bed, but heasked Wedmore to help him in evading them. He did this by playing them off oneagainst another, and by making use of the menfolk to whom they were supposed tobe attached. After one complicated maneuver, Wedmore remarked that Cunninghamwould have done better to avoid these women in the first place. Cunninghamreplied: “That’s true, but I had to possess them once .” This is significant; itindicates, I think, his compulsive need to keep “possessing” different women, asif to prove something to himself. This also struck me about Cunningham’s storyof seizing the princess in the middle of her engagement party and rushing heroff to bed. I can imagine him, afterwards, saying to himself: “I did it. I amgodlike. How many other men could have done that?”—and yet somehow not feelingany different. And this brings me to another point about Cunningham: hisconstant need to thumb his nose at society. He is too aware of society.Nov. 28. Things get crazier. Diana and I were eating supper lastnight—peacefully and happily, because she had left that filthy factory for good,and Kirsten had moved into Cunningham’s (two men spent half the afternoonwrestling his piano downstairs). There was a knock at the door; we thought itmight be Kirsten again, and she rushed into the bedroom; but it was Cunningham,looking completely exhausted. I offered him some wine; he poured himself half apint of Medoc, drank it straight down, then vanished into the bedroom and closedthe door. We left him to himself. Diana and I wanted to celebrate, so we took abus out to Woolwich, had some beer in a pub, went across on the ferry, and thenback. I felt absurdly happy, although it was a raw, misty evening, and there wasan icy wind on the river. On the way back, I asked her point-blank about TomDrage, the bookmaker type—she once told me that she had never “given herself” tohim. Now that I pressed her, she said that she hadn’t ever given herself to him.To begin with, she had more than a suspicion that he already had a wife, or atleast a permanent mistress. He once tried to persuade her to go with him to ahotel, but she thought it too sordid and refused. I asked her about the night Isaw her coming off the waste ground; she said that he had been trying topersuade her to go away with him for the weekend, and had been particularlypersistent. She admitted that he’d gotten her half undressed and had adetermined attempt at raping her, but claimed that he didn’t succeed. I asked ifhe changed his mind and abandoned the attempt; she looked embarrassed and said:“No, something else happened.” I didn’t press her, but gathered that hisenthusiasm was his undoing.This pleased me, even though I’m not sure whether to believe her. Although I hadgotten used to the idea that she had been Drage’s mistress, it faintly disturbedme ... Anyway, we went into another pub to celebrate, and I drank two pints ofblack and tan, and Diana drank sherry, and we arrived home at ten o’clockfeeling tipsy and very happy. I think if we’d met Kirsten, we would have made noattempt to conceal what is happening.Cunningham was still asleep when we got in, but he roused himself and joined us.The first thing he did was to drain another glass of wine, then he lit acigarette with an abominable smell. (He smokes very little as a rule.) Then hesaid: “Ah Gerard, I begin to wish I’d introduced you to this earlier. Now I needyour help, and you don’t even understand what’s going on.” I urged him toexplain to me. He said: “I’ve suspected for some time now that my enemies aretrying to kill me. I felt fairly sure of it the other day when someone tried topush me downstairs.” He explained that it wasn’t a person who had tried to pushhim—just an invisible force. He then went into a rambling story about somemagical order in Paris, which was headed by a German, an Italian and aHungarian, and of how they had expelled him after a quarrel about publishingcertain secrets in their magazine. The Hungarian swore to kill him, andCunningham had one night become aware of a presence in the room, and a hand thathovered around in the air, waiting to grip his throat! For three days, he said,he performed a ceremony to invoke certain destructive forces under the commandof his guardian angel. On the third day, the Hungarian died—apparently of heartfailure, as he walked down the steps of the Bibliothèque Nationale. The troublewith black magic, apparently, is that a competent magician can redirect all yourcurses back on your own head!Now, Cunningham said, he was convinced that the other two had decided that theywere strong enough to attack him. To begin with, they had somehow learned wherehe lived; this enabled them to direct a continual stream of some malevolentinfluence at the house. He asked me if I had mentioned his address to anyone. Ifelt rather guilty, and said that I had spoken to Radin, who had come and talkedto me while Cunningham was out of the room. I didn’t tell him that I’d actuallyhad lunch with Radin. Cunningham said: “Ah, that explains it. I know that man isan enemy. You shouldn’t have given him my address. He must have sent someoneinto the house to pick up some article belonging to the house—otherwise it isimpossible to direct a psychic stream accurately.” I had drunk so much beer—andin any case, gotten so used to Cunningham’s eccentricity—that I didn’t evensuspect him of being dotty. However, this explains why Cunningham had come tosleep at my place—there was no “psychic stream.” However, the next problem wasto thwart the enemies, and this demanded that he should find out where theywere, and what they were planning. He said: “I must have a clairvoyant,” andlooked speculatively at Diana. She immediately said: “I don’t want to behypnotized again.” “Not even when your refusal may cost me my life?” She lookedso miserable and undecided that I asked him if we couldn’t get anyone else inher place. “Oliver’s no use. He’s an even worse hypnotic subject than you. Thatchild Christine might be the answer if we could get hold of her.” I pointed outthat, at half past ten at night, there was no hope of getting hold of Christine;she’d be fast asleep in bed. Then I thought of Carlotta, and suggested her. Hesaid: “Yes, she might do, although I’m afraid she’d let her own personality getin the way.” However, we agreed to try Carlotta; I hastened downstairs to phoneher, and Diana came with me, claiming she wanted to buy cigarettes. As soon aswe were in the street, she said: “I don’t want to let him hypnotize me again. Hewants to gain power over me.” I asked her what she meant, and she said: “Hewants to rape me.” I said I was sure Cunningham wanted to rape anything femaleand presentable, but she wouldn’t change her view.I rang Carlotta, and she immediately agreed to take a taxi over—evidently mytalk about Cunningham’s needing her help excited her. She didn’t even askquestions. When we came out of the phone booth, Diana said: “I wish we could getaway from him. He wants to eat up our lives.”Back in my room, Cunningham casually asked Diana if she had a cigarette, and shehad to admit she’d forgotten to buy them; she got an ironical look. Cunninghamthen went and took a bath, and borrowed my razor to shave. Carlotta took nearlyan hour to get over—said she couldn’t get a cab—but she finally arrived aroundmidnight, and we went up to Cunningham’s.I hardly recognized his room. He had draped the walls with black curtains, had askeleton in one corner, and had set up a kind of altar where the bed used to be.Although the window was wide open, the awful smell of incense and burnt meatstill lingered. I noticed in the corner of the room a large cage—the kind ofthing that pet shops sell for guinea pigs or hamsters—and presumed that this iswhere he got whatever animal had been sacrificed. I only hope that he killed itquickly.Cunningham then—rather to Diana’s dismay, flung off all his clothes in themiddle of the room, and pulled on his “robe”—which was rather like a blackdressing gown. Many of the signs on it unmistakably represented erect phalli. Hethen ordered Carlotta to strip. He said it so seriously and peremptorily thatshe began unzipping her skirt without even asking questions. I hastily said thatDiana and I would leave the room; Cunningham said he would need me for theactual incantation. So I said I’d come back in five minutes. I opened thedoor—and immediately closed it again, for I saw Kirsten coming up the stairsbelow. Luckily he didn’t see me. Cunningham told me to lock the door. A momentlater, Kirsten knocked, and Cunningham told him that he would be engaged for thenext hour, and asked him to come back later. We heard Kirsten going up to hisroom, and shortly afterwards, the piano started. (This annoyed Cunningham, whowas afraid that it might interfere with his hypnosis.) By this time, Carlottawas naked. Cunningham started to rub her body with some kind of oil, andannounced that she would have to prepare herself with a sex ritual. I guessedthe nature of the ritual, and said we’d be back in five minutes. Then Diana andI unlocked the door and crept downstairs.Oliver’s door was locked—possibly he was asleep—so we went down into the street,and walked around the block. Diana asked me if I took all this magic seriously;I said I didn’t know, but it was obvious that Cunningham took it seriously.Finally, we went back up to the room. Carlotta was now dressed in a whitegarment that covered her from head to foot, and was drinking what looked like avery large gin and orange. (I gathered later that this is what it was.)Cunningham had inscribed a pentagram on the floor, in front of the “altar,” anda smaller one in the far corner of the room. He presented me with a piece ofparchment with various letters on it, and short sentences in Latin, Greek andHebrew. He spent about five minutes coaching me in the correct pronunciation ofthese. He then made Diana take off her dress, and put on a red garment—butallowed her to keep on the rest of her things, even her shoes. I was the onlyone in the room who was normally dressed, but Cunningham said that hisceremonial robes were in Paris, and I would have to take the risk of irritatingthe “powers” by appearing in everyday clothes. Since I was fairly sure the wholething was imaginary, I made no objection.Carlotta was obviously in a very strange mood—whether this was autosuggestion orsomething in her drink, I don’t know. But her eyes were glowing, and she was aspink as a baby.Cunningham gave Diana a black vase full of some powder, and told her to throw iton the brazier whenever he raised his hand towards her. He then announced thateverything was ready, and made me take up my position inside the pentagram. Hemade Carlotta lie on the couch, and pulled up her robe around her throat. Iexpected Carlotta to raise objections; instead, she lay with her eyes closed. Hethen kissed her on the navel and on both breasts, and proceeded with the “sexualinvocation.” I must confess that I now felt no desire to leave the room; I alsonoticed that Diana was staring, fascinated. As for Carlotta, I’m quite certainthat her pleasure was intensified by the knowledge that the whole thing wasbeing watched by us. She lay there while Cunningham covered her like a greatblack bat, with his face and shoulders suspended over her face, looking down onher, and making love as impersonally as if he were an animal. It suddenly cameto me that this was the truth of “black magic”; by destroying all taboos, itappeared to release forces that were completely beyond the experience of theparticipants. I can easily imagine what would happen if this room had been fullof men and women, and a Black Mass in progress; within minutes it would turninto a sexual orgy.After five minutes of this, Carlotta began to moan and shudder; then shesuddenly grabbed Cunningham’s hair and began to writhe like a madwoman. With thelight on the top of his great round head, and his eyes in shadow, Cunninghamlooked like the devil.Finally, she quieted down, and Cunningham stood up, his robe now wide open—as itremained for the rest of the ceremony—and made her stand in the middle of herpentagram. He then began chanting formulas in Latin and Hebrew (although some ofit was in English), and I called the responses as he had explained. It wentsomething like this: Cunningham intoned, “I exorcise thee, creature of ink, byAnston, Cerreton, Stimulator, Adonai ... ” I had to call: “Abrachay, Araton,Samatoi, Scaver, Adonai.” Then Cunningham would drone on: “I exorcise thee,creature of the feather kind, by Etereton and Adonai ... ” I have taken theabove from Abrahamelin the Mage, but it sounds roughly like what Cunninghamsaid, and the kind of thing I had to reply. He also scattered a white powderfrom a dish—probably salt—and burnt some feathers. After ten minutes of this, hestroked Carlotta’s forehead, while I had to stand to one side and swing the goldmedal on its chain in small circles in front of her eyes. She went off veryquickly, and Cunningham started asking her questions:“Where are you?”“In front of a door.”“Open it and go in.”“I can’t. There is some obstacle.”“Push it aside and go in.”“I have pushed it aside. But the door won’t open.”She then declared that a man in silver clothes was standing behind her, andCunningham told her to ask his name. The man apparently replied: “Ashtiroth.”I cannot detail what went on in the next two hours. To me, it sounded mostlymumbo-jumbo. At one point, Carlotta said that she saw two men lowering an effigyof Cunningham into a coffin, and driving a knife through its heart. Cunninghamthen began to repeat all kinds of strange sounding formulas (which he told melater were ancient Egyptian), and Carlotta described how one of the men had cuthis wrist quite badly on the knife. She then said: “They know you are workingagainst them.” Cunningham said: “Tell them I will hunt them down and kill them.”She said: “I can’t speak to them. I can only watch them.” “Then tell Ashtirothto tell them.” “He says he can’t speak to them either.”Unfortunately, the room was now getting horribly cold, and instead of thinkingabout the magic, I began to wonder if Carlotta wasn’t frozen stiff under thethin white muslin; poor Diana was definitely cold, and kept blowing her fingers,then trying to warm her hands at the brazier, which was filling the room with acurious odor, containing a definite component of vegetable decay.It was quite an ordeal standing there—at least, after the first half hour. ButCunningham showed no sign of letting up. After a while, he made Carlotta lie onthe bed again (she seemed to be still in a trance) and repeated the wholemagical ceremony, making me repeat the responses. This woke me up temporarily,but as his chanting went on, I found myself sleeping on my feet—waking up as Iwere about to fall. Added to all this, I wanted to get down to the lavatory. Theroom was so full of blue smoke that my eyes were watering. Suddenly, Cunninghamgrabbed Diana, and called: “Into the circle,” pushing her in so that she stoodbeside me. This woke me up for a while, but I could see nothing, except that theroom was now so smoky that it might have been a pea-soup fog. When he paused fora moment, I hinted that my bladder needed relieving, but all he did was whisper“Keep still.” So I stood there for another half hour, getting colder and morefed up, although it was a consolation to have my arm round Diana—we helped tosupport one another. Suddenly Diana gripped my hand, and I opened my eyes. Inthe corner over the empty cage, there was a definite disturbance of the smoke,as if a draft were coming through the floor. I then had the impression that Iwas being looked at from the same spot. There was not, as far as I could gather,an actual figure there, although the smoke gave something of this illusion.Cunningham had his back to it, and didn’t seem to notice it. I closed my eyesagain, prepared for another hour of discomfort, when Cunningham suddenly stoppedchanting. The room was now almost empty of smoke. Cunningham said: “Good.They’ve gone.” He then said: “Thank you, Gerard. You’ve been a great help. Youtoo, Diana.” He woke up Carlotta—I suspect that she had only been fastasleep—and told her that she could now go to bed. I said that Diana and I wouldgo home immediately, and we left. As we went out of the door, Cunningham askedme: “Did you see anything?” I was feeling so irritable—and also rathertaciturn—that I answered: “No. Not a thing.” He asked Diana, and she said: “Idon’t think so.” But on our way home, she agreed that she thought she had seen ashadowy figure above the cage, and also had a sensation of being looked at. Butwe both agreed that, after two hours of chanting, incense, sex magic and cold,it would have been very easy to make us think we’d seen ghosts.Nov. 29. Romain Rolland once called artists “the masters of the world, the greatdefeated.” This, I suppose, is one of my central problems and preoccupations,and the reason that Cunningham interests me, because he plainly has no intentionof being defeated. And yet for all that, I am aware that he has no hope. Why? Ican’t explain it. I simply sense it. Still, that’s a poor admission for awriter, so let me try to be more specific. What he lacks is a desire for thesimplicity of self-conquest. What is at issue here is our idea of success. ForCunningham, success means power and fame, a life like a procession of an IndianRajah, noisy success, success that no one can deny. My own vision of success iscompletely dissimilar; it is a state of sudden illumination that is entirelysubjective, something closer to Wordsworth’s vision of that dark hill above thelake and “unknown modes of being.” But I’m sick—utterly, miserably sick—of thisnarrowness of my consciousness, this inability to see or think beyond thepresent moment. My body has never been so heavily oppressive, my spirit never sototally bound, as at present. My brain is like the engine of a car with acompletely dead battery; no amount of effort can stir it into life; I onlyexhaust myself. My spirit twists and wrenches to bring forth its solution, for Iam convinced there is a solution.All these gloomy thoughts come to me after having spent the afternoon withOliver. Luckily, Diana had gone out, knowing that Kirsten would finish hismoving today, and afraid he would come in and find her here. Oliver arrived justbefore she’d gone; he was in a worse mood than I’d seen him in for a long time.When he saw Diana, he was about to leave again, but she forestalled him and saidshe had to go. When she’d gone, he said: “So it was you who robbed Kirsten ofhis wife?” His tone irritated me, but I said that I thought it might prove to bebest for all of us. “For Kirsten, at least,” he said, “Gertrude has been tidyinghis room all morning.” As soon as he began to gossip about Gertrude, he cheeredup. I told him that I was pretty certain I’d marry Diana, as soon as Kirstendivorced her, and he became cynical again: “And how long do you suppose it willlast?” I couldn’t be bothered to contradict him. I said that I thought hisdisappointment over Christine had given him a pessimistic outlook. He said:“That’s another thing. Christine. She’s found out where I live. I saw herstanding watching me when I went out yesterday.” I asked him what the point wasin bearing a grudge against a thirteen-year-old girl. It was pointless, as Ishould have realized. It wasn’t Christine’s fault. It was Oliver’s fault forimagining she embodied some ideal. And yet I’m sure that, given a chance, shecould give Oliver what he needs—love and admiration and loyalty. I sometimeswonder if he doesn’t enjoy torturing himself.I offered him something to eat, and made myself a ham sandwich. He refused, butfinished by eating two large sandwiches anyway. This seemed to improve histemper, and he told me he intended leaving this place as soon as possible. Iasked why (thinking that perhaps he wanted to avoid Christine). But he said:“Because that man [meaning Cunningham] is driving me mad.”As soon as he started talking to me, his confidences came out in a rush. Itstruck me as peculiar that Oliver should think of me as his best friend. (Heactually said this at one point.) He’s so given up to extremes of emotion that Ican’t imagine him feeling anything as positive as friendship. However, it wasobvious to me that he’d been under great emotional strain, and needed badly totalk to someone.He told me first of all how Cunningham had prevented him from committingsuicide. Amusingly enough, he’d decided on this after reading a pessimisticnovel by Artsybashev called The Breaking Point, which paints a grim picture oflife and declares that suicide is the only dignified way out. (I read it myselfyears ago and found it bad and depressing—and also a fake, because if the authorhad really believed it, he’d have committed suicide instead of writing a book.)However, Oliver read it at a time when he was feeling very low, and itsBuddhistic pessimism seemed to him an accurate account of the human situation.His account of how Cunningham stopped him corresponded pretty closely withCunningham’s own account. For a few days after this, he felt happy and exalted,and was sure that Cunningham was going to provide him with a solution to all hisproblems. There was only one fly in the ointment. (It obviously took Oliver atremendous effort to tell me this, and I found myself admiring a strange,despairing honesty in him.) Cunningham preached the need for destroying allsexual taboos, rooting out all sexual shame, in order to discover one’s “truewill.” He asked Oliver what he found most repulsive in sex; Oliver admitted thathe had always loathed the idea of homosexuality. He hadn’t expected Cunninghamto take this so seriously; but in fact, Cunningham returned to the subject againand again, told Oliver it was due to repressions instilled by his parents, andthat the total destruction of his suicidal impulses depended on his coming toterms with homosexuality. The result of this was that after a week, Oliver gaveway. First of all, he consented to sleeping with some silky-haired little fairywhom Cunningham picked up in Lancaster, and finally slept with Cunninghamhimself. He said he did all this in a genuinely ascetic spirit. (I can believethis, remembering how he used to sleep on the bare wires of his bed and indulgein other forms of self-torture.) But the result was the discovery that, contraryto Cunningham’s expectations, he had no repressed homosexual tendency at all; hefound it rather boring. (I could have told Cunningham this; if he really wantsto release Oliver’s deepest repression, he should get him into bed withChristine.) In spite of this, Cunningham periodically insists that Oliver shouldovercome his revulsion—hence the scene that I witnessed the other morning. (Iwas pretty sure at the time that something was going on between Oliver andCunningham, and yet simply couldn’t imagine Oliver as a queer.)But the major shock, according to Oliver, was the matter of his exhibition. Iremember that he always refused even to try to exhibit his work, saying that hedidn’t want impertinent busybodies telling him how he ought to paint. WhenCunningham said he would get his paintings exhibited, he hardly took himseriously. But the result of being written about by various art magazines, andeven bombarded with requests to give lectures in art schools, was that he lostall sense of privacy. Luckily, the gallery refused to give people his address;but even so, he got letters from enthusiastic art students who wanted to comeand admire him—all of which he took care not to answer—and requests to talkabout his painting on the Third Program.In any other person, I would have suspected these complaints of lackingsincerity; but I know Oliver too well to suppose anything of the sort. Iremember the passage in Rilke in which he advises young poets to take care toremain unknown as long as possible, because fame will destroy their sense ofprivacy; he must have been thinking of people like Oliver.He says that he has now begun to find the constant presence of Cunninghamoppressive. Cunningham has been sensible enough not to try to influence Oliver’spainting, but he still makes comments, and generally gives Oliver a feeling ofbeing under some kind of an obligation.I failed to sympathize with a great deal that Oliver said. After all, he’sbetter off now than he was a year ago; he can always go and hide where no onecan find him, and he’s now in no danger of starving.Oliver complained that all money is paid direct to Cunningham, who is his“agent,” so that he has no money of his own. I told him that if he was reallydetermined to move, I would lend him enough money to find himself another place.Besides, all he has to do is go to the gallery and say that in future all moneyis to be paid direct to him. But, like myself, he is a moral coward when itcomes to offending anyone (or else he’s afraid that Cunningham might put a spellon him!).I promised to raise this matter with Cunningham—tactfully, without letting himknow that Oliver has spoken to me. When he left, an hour ago, he seemed morecheerful. But I then began to think that he doesn’t know when he’s well off. Iwouldn’t object in the least to having my work known. And if he hadn’t metCunningham, he might have committed suicide—although, having heard Oliver’sversion, I am doubtful about this. Then, having reflected that Oliver is a kindof spiritual hypochondriac, who is simply constitutionally incapable of allowinghimself to be happy, I realized that I have no right to talk. I have everythingthat should make me happy—my freedom, the books I need, a girl I’m in lovewith—and I still feel this inexplicable oppression of spirit. Perhaps I need toescape ... I don’t know. Where should I go? I always had a romantic notion ofliving in the Aran Isles, imagining a misty land where the soul would confrontthe bareness of the sea and sky and throw off all its civilized boredom. Butwhen I read Synge’s book about them, I realized that they are simply cold, wetand fishy, and not nearly as convenient as London from the point of view oflibraries.It’s so easy to agree with De L’Isle-Adam’s Axel—that the world is nothing butdisappointment, that life is an indignity. Yet somehow I can’t believe this.Sunday morning. I am writing this in the bedroom, while Diana irons clothes inthe other room. Cunningham told me last night that he has a publisher interestedin my Methods and Techniques of Self-Deception; he borrowed the manuscript twoweeks ago—the hundred pages I typed out in Kentish Town—and sent it to a JamesCurzon of Lloyd and Rich; yesterday he got it back with a letter that says: “Ifeel this book shows a remarkable and original talent, and if the second partmaintains the same standard, we shall be happy to publish it.” The letter goeson to say that I can’t expect a sale of more than a couple of thousand copies,and that they would like to see a novel if I decide to write one.This is why I can’t make up my mind about Cunningham. He agrees that I’ll belucky if I make a hundred pounds out of the book, and that the publishers mighteasily lose money. So what possible motive can he have for trying to get itpublished?On the other hand, the whole business is rather strange. He didn’t tell me aboutthe Lloyd and Rich offer until I had begun to talk about Oliver. I went overafter supper, and found Carlotta installed, laundering his clothes. I got him tocome out to a pub for a drink, and then told him that I’m worried about Oliver,and that I think he wants to go away. Cunningham immediately became slightlyindignant, and asked me if I thought he was interested in Oliver solely for thesake of the money. I assured him I didn’t. But he then told me he had a surprisefor me, took me back up to his room, and produced the letter. Naturally, I wasoverwhelmed, and decided to go home immediately and settle down to typing therest of the book. Remembering my complaints in my journal a few hours earlier, Ifelt guilty. However, Cunningham said it would be a good idea to keep themwaiting for a while. It was then that I recalled that the date on the letter wasthe 24th—four days ago. Of course, it may simply have been waiting around thepublisher’s office for three days, or been delayed in the post. This seems veryodd. I also had a devil of a job persuading Cunningham to return the first halfof the typescript—he said he had left it upstairs somewhere. At this point,Carlotta said that she had seen it in a cupboard, and went and fetched it. Icaught the expression on Cunningham’s face—it was murderous exasperation. (Fromseveral things he said, I gather that he is already wishing that he hadn’tinvited Carlotta to act as his medium last night; she actually behaves as ifshe’s married to him.)Finally, Cunningham settled down to a fairly frank discussion of Oliver. Most ofit struck me as nonsense. He told me that he had been forcing Oliver to undergohomosexual experiences to “learn his true will,” and had concluded that he wasoriginally mistaken in supposing that it was repressed homosexuality that wasOliver’s trouble. At this point, I said: “I can tell you Oliver’s trouble,” andtold him about Christine. As soon as I’d spoken, I regretted it. He said slowly:“Ah, I see. I think you may have found the solution.” I quickly told him thatChristine’s father is a difficult character, who wouldn’t hesitate to accuse usall of violating his daughter if he thought he could get us into jail.As I left him, he told me that he intended to get Carlotta into a trance againat midnight, to find out how successful he has been in defeating his “enemies.”I immediately said that Diana had declared that she wouldn’t take part in anymore magical ceremonies. He said: “I hope you don’t feel the same?”I said no, although I realized that I was being a coward. There’s nothing I wantless than to have to spend another two hours listening to Cunningham deceivinghimself with gibberish and imagining he’s conjuring up spirits. However, he saidhe wouldn’t need any help tonight, as he only proposes to hypnotize her.When I left, I noticed that Gertrude’s car was parked around the corner, so Ipresume she is still nursing Kirsten’s genius.Dec. 1. Odd things happening. Yesterday I had a visit from Radin, who asked meif I would go with him to see a man in St. Johns Wood. Out of curiosity, Iagreed. On the way there, Radin offered me money—five pounds a week—to keep himinformed about Cunningham. Naturally, I refused.The interview was brief. Wise was there, and a tall, skinny man in a Scotchkilt, to whom I took an instant dislike. The skinny man—whose name isDoughty—told me that he had reason to believe that Cunningham intends to publishvarious secrets of his magical order, secrets that Cunningham had once beenpledged not to reveal. I suppose this must be the order that Cunningham oncetried to dominate. I said I had no idea what Cunningham intended. (The man’sbullying manner annoyed me.) He then asked me—as if he were a prosecutingcounsel and I were in the dock—if I had had any experience of Cunningham as a“mage.” Since I had already told Radin something about our experience the othernight, I didn’t try to deny this. He immediately began to ask me questions aboutthe ceremony. I hadn’t told Radin about the “sex magic” part, but it now slippedout—to Radin’s evident delight. Doughty shouted: “Just as I thought—he’sdeliberately distorting our ceremonial with his filthy abominations.” By thistime, I was just about ready to explode. So I said that, if he wanted to know, Ithought Cunningham’s magic was all self-deception and mumbo-jumbo, and that Ithought anyone who took magic seriously should be put in a lunatic asylum.At this he smiled very thinly and very wickedly, and said: “Thank you, sir. Youhave told me what I wanted to know. Good day to you.” I strode out without evenspeaking to him. But I was also in a filthy temper with Radin, who was burstingwith curiosity about the “sex magic,” and obviously wanted to flatter andpropitiate me. So he began by saying that he thought it was all rubbish too, andthat Doughty was a bit mad—however, he had a great deal of money and influencein certain circles, and no journalist could afford to ignore the possibility ofa good story, etc. By this time, I was almost bursting with loathing. So I said:“Look here. I don’t care if Cunningham is mad, or even if he’s a crook. But he’sgiven me no reason to sell him—either to you or Mr. Doughty.” By this time, wewere near the Baker Street tube, so I insisted on getting out and taking atrain—claiming I had other things to do before I went home. Radin refused to beoffended, said that he would keep in touch with me, that I wouldn’t regret beingfrank, etc.—and drove off.Dec. 3. I’ve been working hard on my book for the past two days, and so have hadno time for keeping this journal. Cunningham has been around several times inhigh good spirits. He certainly knows a tremendous amount about magic and itshistory. I am adding a chapter on the great charlatans—Cagliostro, SaintGermain, etc. I intended to include Nostradamus, and for that purpose gotLaver’s book on him from the Whitechapel library. I’m amazed to discover thealmost creepy accuracy of his prophecies. I was glad to have a chance to discussall this with Cunningham. His view is that concentration on any faculty willdevelop that faculty, even if it had not existed before. He cites the case ofthe Fox sisters, the founders of spiritualism—how, as soon as they madetable-rapping fashionable in the States, the craze spread all over America,although it was almost unknown before.Nostradamus predicts the end of the world for 1999. I hope he isn’t as accurateabout this as he was about the date of the French Revolution, etc. The onlyconsolation is that he seemed to be most accurate when predicting things in thenear future, and became less so with more distant epochs.I have also decided to include Crowley in my charlatan chapter. Cunningham knewhim well in the thirties, and is of the opinion that Crowley definitelypossessed certain powers, although most of his magic was wishful thinking. Thisis the thing that startles me about Cunningham—that he can be so detached andsceptical about magic, while apparently holding the most fantastic beliefs. Hecriticized a sentence of mine in which I said that a kind of mental blindness isnecessary to swallow the extravagances of Cagliostro. He said: “My dear boy, youneed hardly any credulity to become interested in the occult. The minimumworking hypothesis is very simple. The first thing you know is that you’re boredand tied hand and foot. Everybody agrees about that. The only other thing youneed to accept is that there are great powers in the universe, outside yourself,and that in rare moments you can make contact with them and feel like a god. Assoon as you study the methods of making contact, you become interested inmagic.”The magicians are the ideal subject for the last chapter of my book, becausethey stand in the way of a simple, wholesale solution of the problem. It istempting to agree with Schopenhauer and the Buddha that all men are adept atself-delusion, and that there is no reality except death. But the magicians makeit apparent that this would be an oversimplification. They represent such astrange blending of illusion and reality. Is it possible to believe in illusionsso fiercely that they turn into realities? I am sure it is. By the power oftotal belief, we summon up powers we didn’t know we possessed. This must be theanswer to all magic, spiritualism and the rest. It is the summoning of theunknown life forces from our own depths.Later. Was seriously distracted from my book when Cunningham met Radin on thestairs, and threw him all the way down. Radin was on his way to visit me. Hewent off swearing to sue Cunningham for assault and battery; I expected him toreturn with a policeman, but he didn’t. Cunningham claimed that he had receiveda sudden “psychic message” to the effect that he must hurry to my flat toprevent some serious mischief. I wish I could believe everything he tells me;half the time I suspect it’s wishful thinking.But later on, he showed me an interesting trick. Diana came in very tired afterdoing the shopping, and I persuaded her to go and sleep. Cunningham came abouthalf an hour later, and I heard him throwing Radin downstairs. We made tea, andsat talking about magic, fairly softly, so as not to wake Diana. He suddenlyoffered to give me a demonstration of “psychic force.” He took off his shoes,and crept into the room where Diana lay asleep. He stood at the side of the bed,stretched out his hand over her head, and concentrated on her. After a fewmoments, she rolled over on to her back, and her lips parted. Suddenly, her hipsbegan to move, and it was quite obvious to me that she was having a sexualdream. Cunningham concentrated more, bending over her, and she began to lookworried. Then she woke up, saw Cunningham bending over her, and shrieked. Ittook me about five minutes to calm her. Cunningham went out of the room, smilingto himself, and I explained that he had offered to give me a demonstration ofpsychic force. (As a matter of fact, I felt embarrassed, and wouldn’t have beensurprised if she’d lost her temper and walked out on me—I wouldn’t have allowedit if I’d known what Cunningham intended to do.) However, when she calmed down,she said that she had been dreaming that she was being embraced by a tall, blondman who reminded her of me. Suddenly, he began to change into Cunningham, and atthis point she woke up.Cunningham told me that this was a simple trick of thought transference andsuggestion, that anyone can master with a little effort. He claims that peoplecan communicate on several different levels, besides ordinary conversation. Weall have the potentiality of becoming telepaths. He thinks that, in the nextstage of evolution of the human race, certain “magical” faculties will be quitecommon—intuitions of danger, seeing around corners and through walls, etc.All this strikes me as of immense importance. Even in my family—about the leastpsychic I’ve ever known—I’ve heard of odd things that can’t be explained exceptby some kind of thought transference—for example, my father suffering mymother’s labor pains, although she was a hundred miles away, and the baby wasn’texpected for another fortnight—so he could have had no idea when her labor wouldbegin. This kind of thing is fairly common, I believe, and supports Cunningham’scontention that all “paranormal phenomena” like second sight, clairvoyance,precognition, etc., are simply examples of faculties that will seem perfectlyordinary to our remote descendants. I also remember examples in Jim Corbett’sbooks on tiger hunting—how he would suddenly be quite certain that a tiger waswaiting for him on a particular stretch of road, although there was no concreteevidence to account for his certainty. This, I think, is also fairly common—thata man who spends a great deal of his life meeting certain kinds of dangerdevelops a “sixth sense” about the danger. This sixth sense is partlyunconscious observation; but I do not think this accounts for all suchinstances.The thing that irritates me is that these faculties lie so close to us, and yetI remain encased in this stupid, insensitive body, and there seems to be no wayof escape.Dec. 4. The talk with Oliver about boredom seems to have crystallized somethingin me, and I have been sitting around all day in a curious state of depression;no, the right word is oppression, a sense of gathering storm. I walk up anddown, look out of the window, read a few pages of a Moravia novel, and feel mysenses coated with a thin, sticky boredom. No doubt Moravia is not the idealperson to read under these circumstances, since his favorite topic is boredom,and he writes about his dyspepsia as if it were a universal condition or amystical insight. This is the trouble with all these apostles of suicide andnausea—they all write with a naive egoism, assuming that their weakness isuniversal.And yet my misery alternates with moments of intense certainty, when it seems tome that, like Arjuna, I was born to conquer.I understand, I understand it all—the unfulfillment, the meaninglessness, theennui. I know that our basic experience of the world is of pointlessness, matterleading back to itself, denying the reality of mind. I contain in myself all themost suicidal pessimists of the past 150 years, from Werther and Childe Harolddown to the latest hero of Moravia or Beckett; yet in spite of all this, I amthe most incorrigible optimist I know. The men who can do something for this agewill recognize one another; the others do not matter. I know that we shallfinally create a race of men who are incapable of boredom, men in whom valuesand vitality are synonymous, who never find their appetite for life diminishing,negating the values of yesterday.But I am tired. And this tension oppresses me. I wish it would rain.Jan. 15. (Shannon Cottage, Galway.) It has been more than a month since I lastwrote in this journal. It arrived this morning in a parcel, together with proofsof the extracts that will appear in the Sunday Star. The extracts they havechosen are stupid and unrepresentative, but at least they might counteract someof the stupidities that have been quoted in the other newspapers. So much hashappened in this last month that I’ve had little time for writing, although evenso, I managed to post off the manuscript of Methods and Techniques ofSelf-Deception four days ago, and this morning received the hundred poundsadvance that Lloyd promised me. Also, the local representative of the SundayStar tramped out here last night to tell me that Cunningham is definitely inSouth America, and to get my comments.The day after my last entry, Gertrude came to see me. She told me that she hadseen Cunningham with Christine, and that she was convinced that his intentionswere definitely “wicked.” I dissuaded her from going to see Christine’s parents,and said that I would speak to Cunningham myself about it.Cunningham wasn’t at all pleased when I went to see him. He looked as if he weresuffering from a hangover. (Actually, as I discovered later, he was waiting fora delivery of drugs, and was in a state of tension because they were delayed.)He had a violent outburst about interfering women—about Diana as well asGertrude. He said: “I will tell you frankly, Gerard, I’m disappointed in you.It’s one thing to steal another man’s wife to sleep with her, but quite anotherto decide to marry her. You’ll be unfaithful to her within a fortnight of beingmarried. Why can’t you be like Oliver, and remain a lone wolf?” I told himGertrude’s suspicions about Christine, and he readily admitted that she wouldconsider his intentions wicked. His intention was—quite openly—to get Oliver toovercome his inhibitions about Christine. What is more, he had carried out thefirst part of his plan—had Christine in to tea, and told her that Oliver wasactually romantically in love with her, and hoped to marry her as soon as shewas old enough. He said she was obviously overwhelmed and delighted, butpretended not to believe him. She was too shy to see Oliver again, but hadagreed to come back to tea the following day.I had to agree that this didn’t sound too wicked. I know Oliver well enough tobe sure that he wouldn’t take advantage of the child; on the other hand, to seeher again would probably have an excellent effect on his work, and I could seeno reason why he shouldn’t marry her in five years’ time if she still wanted to.So I agreed to do what I could to help. That is, I went down to see Oliver, andtold him that Christine had been to see me and wanted to see him again. Hisfirst reaction was rage—he stormed and swore, and called the poor child namesthat made her sound like the whore of Babylon. I then laid it on thick—told himabout her devotion to him, how she had tried to contact him through me, andfinally pointed out that the fact that he had returned to live in the same areaproved that he subconsciously wanted to see her again. The result, as Iexpected, was to calm him down. He asked me to go away so he could think aboutit, and I left him in an obvious state of excitement and perplexity. I didn’ttell him that she was invited for tea the following day. But Oliver came to seeme the next morning, saying that he had thought it over, and could see no reasonfor refusing to be friendly with the child, although he had no intention ofassuming their old relations.There was, however, a delicate situation that had to be faced. Christine’sfather had separated from her mother—she got sick of his drunken rages, andcalled in two of her brothers to bully him. It ended in the father’s stampingout of the house, with his wife suing him for maintenance.But although this apparently simplified Christine’s life—it was her father whohad had Oliver arrested on a charge of raping her—it actually made things moredifficult. He was alleging that his quarrels with his wife were about thechildren’s morals, and that she was no fit guardian for them. Christine was hisfavorite child, and he was trying to get her away from her mother. This ideahorrified Christine. If her father found out about Oliver and Cunningham, hewould probably use it to prove that she was under “dangerous influences.” So itwas important that she should be on her best behavior until her father gave upthe idea of having her live with him.At all events, Christine came to tea—I wasn’t there, but Cunningham told meabout it—and finally went downstairs to see Oliver. I gather there was a greatreconciliation scene that ended with Christine sobbing on Oliver’s shoulder, andOliver promising that he would never leave her again. Cunningham was delightedby all this. He obviously expected that a Lolita situation was the next obviousdevelopment. I didn’t disabuse him of this idea.The next important development was that Kirsten found out about Diana. I hadn’tseen much of him for several days—I was working hard, and I gather that he wasworking on his opera for the Washington opera group. (I note from this week’sRadio Times that some of his chamber music is being done in the Thursdayconcert.)One day, I met him on the stairs at Cunningham’s, and asked him how things weregoing. He gave me a most odd look, and then said quietly: “You don’t have to tryto deceive me any more, you know. I know about Diana.” I felt embarrassed aboutthis, but since he knew, decided I would rather explain it to him. So I askedhim if he’d let me explain, and we went up to his room. I noticed immediatelythat he wasn’t angry. And when I saw the state of his room—incredibly tidy, witha neat pile of newly laundered washing on the table, and not a speck of dustanywhere—it wasn’t difficult to guess the reason. Not that I believe there’s anyromantic relation between Kirsten and Gertrude; I’m sure she feels that she ishelping a great musician as impersonally as Nadezhda von Meek helpedTchaikovsky, and is reveling in the feeling of selflessness. Still, this made itall much easier; I told Kirsten about the bookmaking type, and this seemed toplease him. He was very bitter about Diana. When I said I wanted to marry her,he asked me how I could ever be sure she wouldn’t treat me as she had treatedhim. Finally, he ended by admitting that he now felt better off than everbefore, and that he was glad it was all over.I was glad of this. I didn’t want Kirsten to feel compelled to break with me. Weparted on good terms, and he referred to Gertrude as his “guardian angel.”Cunningham was beginning to feel that he was losing his hold over all three ofus. Oliver’s association with Christine had temporarily solved thatproblem—Oliver no longer talked about getting away—but Cunningham was aware thatboth Diana and Gertrude were using their influence against him. So one day, heasked me to come and see him. He told me that he had decided to leave for hisisland immediately after Christmas, when the signs of the heavens would bepropitious, and wanted me, Kirsten and Oliver to join him there. He realizedthat Kirsten wanted to stay in London until his opera was revised, and thatOliver would probably not want to leave Christine, but he was relying on me togo with him and prepare the place to become a great cultural center.I was naturally dubious, being happy enough where I was, especially sincefinishing my book was a full-time job, and I needed to be within reach of theBritish Museum reading room.Cunningham said: “I realize why you hesitate. You are not convinced that itisn’t all self-delusion. Weren’t you convinced by my last demonstration?”(meaning the long conjuration in his room). I agreed that both Diana and Ithought there had been another person in the corner of the room, but thatneither of us could be certain.He said: “In that case, you need more demonstrations. Suppose, for example, Icould prove to you that the sexual orgasm can be prolonged for severalminutes—perhaps even as long as half an hour?”The end of it all was that I agreed to help him in a series of experiments thatwould last about a week. He explained to me that there are drugs that canproduce an impression like a sexual orgasm for a long time—at least an hour—butthat these drugs are dangerous. They burn up the body as a candle flame consumesthe candle, leaving no inner resources of energy. On the other hand, if a mancould learn to tap his inner reservoir of power, this intensity would leave himcompletely unaffected. This, Cunningham said, was the only safe way. The otherway usually turned into some dangerous disease in a matter of weeks—usuallyconsumption. He pointed out that this is true of sex generally. Sometimes an actof sex can leave you completely exhausted and drained; yet under differentcircumstances—or with a different partner—the appetite seems to increase in acurious way, as if it is fed by some inner spring of power, rather as a wellcontinues to remain at the same level no matter how much water is taken out ofit.All this intrigued me. I have already noted my belief that the whole key tohuman existence lies in the sexual orgasm. I have always felt that if only itcould last longer—minutes instead of seconds—I would have the whole secret ofhuman existence. Someone once wrote a novel about men trapped in a bunker, withenough food and drink to last for years, but no hope of escape, and about howthey turned into animals.12 On the other hand, someone once wrote of the Tarotpack that a man who was kept in solitary confinement with nothing but thesecards would be able to acquire the whole sum of human knowledge through them.Well, if human beings are still half animal—as pessimistic philosophers nevertire of pointing out—it is because we have all been confined to a huge bunker,with enough hardship to keep us wide awake, and enough amusements to occupy ourleisure, but no inspiration to prevent our becoming worthless and lazy.Civilizations have developed on the human need for self-assertion, and havecollapsed when that need wore itself out; religions have been created to explainthe mystery of man to himself, and have died when the ignorance and prejudicethat sustained them has been dispersed. But still man is basically in ameaningless universe, with no guide but a bundle of instincts which civilizationdilutes.And yet again and again, in the sexual orgasm, I have felt that the solution isnearer than we think—that if that intolerable light would only persist for tenminutes instead of dying in a few seconds, man would know every secret of hisown being, would fuse into a united whole instead of living as a mass of dividedemotions and half-completed insights. The first man to achieve such a visionwould be as distinct from all other men as man is from the gorilla. Light wouldshine from his head; his whole presence would radiate a power that could besensed in all his neighborhood. The wave carries us to a height, poises us therefor a moment, then swoops down again; but how if we could cling to some ledgewhile we are up there, and be left on it when the wave subsides? Man would bepermanently on a new plane of being.Then, I realize, men who have become more godlike than others sometimes fallfrom their ledge and die insane—like Nijinsky. But that is because they lack thestrength to be godlike in this world without purpose, in this enormous bunkerwhere bored men play cards and spit tobacco juice.It seemed to me that if Cunningham knew some technique to increase thatintensity, he might provide me with my “key,” even if he possessed no real poweror knowledge of his own. (It is obvious to me that, in spite of hisintelligence, his mind has no concentration; it lacks the analytical toughnessto think for long distances and to keep a tight hold on its results.)Carlotta was still ostensibly living in Kentish Town, but in fact she spent mostof her time at Cunningham’s. It soon became obvious that she was getting on hisnerves; I saw her several times in tears, and one day she appeared with aswollen cheek and a partially-black eye. This did not seem to affect her feelingfor him; I have an idea that when he wasn’t blacking her eyes, he was spendinghours in “sex magic,” and that even in hitting her, he was only responding toher taste for being dominated. I have always felt sorry for Carlotta. There arecertain women who seem born for lives of vague dissatisfaction. Too strong tomake a man their whole center of gravity, and yet too weak to stand alone andcreate, they invite unhappiness. And when they choose, they choose the worstpossible man, as if out of a deliberate perverseness. I doubt whether Carlottaresponds deeply to anything in Cunningham; she is fascinated by his confidence,his apparent certainty of purpose, but her feeling is as irrational as a moth’sattraction to light. And she’s puzzled when the glittering thing that attractsher shows its dark side and blacks her eye.I stopped going to Cunningham’s because of the possibility of meeting Gertrude.Not that I felt any dislike for her, but I felt guilty about her. My absence hadthe effect of making Cunningham anxious to show me “results” that would turn meinto a full-time disciple. Also, he didn’t like the way that I was settling downwith Diana—quietly and unexcitingly, without quarrels or even disagreements. Ihave always felt that it makes very little difference to Diana whether she’smarried to me or Kirsten—or anybody else, for that matter; she’s a quiet, goodgirl who takes life as it comes, and wants security. I sometimes find thispassiveness exasperating—but then it fits in with my own methodical character.Finally, on the 10th of December, Cunningham told me that I was to prepare for arevelation on the following night. He told me that ideally I should fast for twodays—but that if I didn’t want to fast completely, I should at least confinemyself to bread and butter and milk—on no account meat or alcohol. He alsoadvised me to read the Marquis de Sade, explaining that although Sade is a foolwho lacks the capacity for thinking clearly, his belief in a total freedom frommorality is a good mental preparation for magic.I was more than dubious about all this. To begin with, I was now working in theBritish Museum during the day. After three hours of reading and writing, I wouldfind myself getting tense and nervy, and the ideal remedy was a beef sandwichand a pint of bitter in the pub across the road. But apart from that, all thistalk about leaving England to live on an island bored me. I realized that I owedthe acceptance of my book to Cunningham, but now I was working on it, the ideaof going on a wild goose chase to Sardinia was intolerable. Besides, I hadDiana, and in many ways felt more contented than I’d been for years. So Isuppose I was unconsciously willing Cunningham’s “magic” to fail and release mefrom my obligation.On Thursday (the 10th), I met Radin and Wise in the Museum. I wanted to letRadin know that I was not a party to Cunningham’s roughness the other night—infact, I’d been feeling guilty about it ever since it happened. But he didn’tseem to bear me any grudge, and immediately asked me to go and have a drink. Isaid I couldn’t—that I wasn’t drinking. I didn’t intend to tell them the reason,but Wise asked immediately: “Are you fasting for some initiation?” I admittedthat Cunningham wanted to impart certain secrets to me and wanted to get me intothe right frame of mind. I thought I was being tactful, but my remarks seemed todrive Wise to a fury. “Our secrets!” he said, grinding his teeth, “the secretshe swore never to reveal.” I tried to smooth things over, but it was hopeless. Ifinally agreed to go to the pub with Radin simply to get away from Wise. (Idrank orange squash.) I tried hard to convince Radin that I thought he was onthe wrong track with Cunningham—that Cunningham had no real magic powers, andwas only a harmless crank. To convince him, I told him in detail about theceremony of the other night, feeling that, since he knew half of it, there wasno point in trying to hide the rest. But I also tried hard to convince him thatCunningham’s main interest was in feeling himself “in charge” of asituation—arranging things for his friends and arranging their lives. I told himabout Kirsten’s opera, about my own book, and finally, about Christine. I tookcare not to mention Cunningham’s expectations about this Christine situation,but simply told him that he had brought them together again in a thoroughlydisinterested way. Then I noticed that he was listening with his eyes on thetabletop, as if completely bored, and I knew this to be a danger signal—that hewas not looking at me because he didn’t want me to see that he was mentallyrecording every word. So I dropped the subject, and refused to start it again. Ileft Radin—on friendly terms—an hour later.I spent part of my time reading Sade, but found him boring. All his gleeful talkabout incest, rape and murder struck me as schoolboyish. But here again, I wasmade aware of elements in Cunningham’s character that he is clever enough not toshow. For example, his disregard of other people, his capacity for cruelty. Ihad only seen this briefly, or been left to infer it from his treatment ofCarlotta, his “sacrifices,” etc. But I am unobservant, and always think the bestof people until the worst is too obvious for me to miss. But reading Sade mademe aware that my own habit of mind is completely foreign to Cunningham—a rathercautious and scientific approach, a deliberately cultivated manner of bourgeoisliving to counterbalance my tendency to lose myself in dreams or abstractions.There is something of Nero about Cunningham—a desire to set the world on firewith a torch and then watch it burn. I became aware of all this as I read Sade.It is extreme romanticism—impatience with all restraints, the desire to reachthe stars with one leap, and a muddled way of thinking that concludes that thereluctance to commit murder and rape is only another form of slavery.I didn’t tell Diana too much about Cunningham’s plans, hoping that he wouldn’texpect her to take part in the ceremony. But early on Friday evening, he came upto our room and told me that I shouldn’t eat anything for the rest of theevening. As Diana was cooking supper, I found this tiresome. However, I ate afew water biscuits with cheese when he’d gone. He said I could drink now, as itwould be a suitable preparation for the ceremony, but I decided not to, since Ihadn’t eaten much all day. Cunningham also said that he wanted Diana to come; Iknew she was unwilling, but that she didn’t like to oppose him openly. Finally,we went over there at about ten o’clock. On the way up, I met Oliver on thestairs, and he asked us to go into his room. Christine was fast asleep in bed.Oliver was worried; he said that Christine had been to Cunningham’s for tea, andthat Cunningham had offered to hypnotize her. She had gone to sleep and answeredsome questions—rather incoherently—but when he tried to wake her, she went onsleeping. Cunningham said that this was common in cases of suppressed hysteria:the subject has a subconscious desire to stay in the hypnotic trance becausecertain deep inner forces are allowed to escape. I immediately suspected a moresimple explanation—that Cunningham had put some kind of drug into her tea, andused the hypnotism business as an excuse. However, I didn’t tell Oliver this—hewas worried enough already about how to get her home. It was long past the timewhen she was supposed to leave, and he couldn’t take her himself, for obviousreasons. He had tried ringing Gertrude, to get her to take Christine in hercar—Gertrude could fabricate some excuse, and Christine’s family knew her as asocial worker—but got no reply.I suggested ringing her again; I went down to a public telephone; but I also gotno reply. What puzzled me was Cunningham’s motive in drugging her. It was Dianawho saw the explanation—that a scandal about her might compel Glasp to leave thecountry—especially since he had already been accused of assaulting her by herfather. Even so, this explanation seemed to me rather far-fetched, becauseprobably all that would happen would be that Christine would return home late,get into trouble with her mother, and perhaps not be allowed to see Oliveragain. This wouldn’t necessarily make Oliver willing to go to Sardinia.We decided to ask Cunningham if he couldn’t get her out of her “trance.” I evensuggested to Oliver that he should promise Cunningham to go out to Sardinia fora few weeks—after all, he couldn’t be compelled to stay. So I went up toCunningham’s room, and found him sitting with Kirsten and Carlotta, both prettyhigh. I persuaded Cunningham to go down to see Oliver. I felt pretty constrainedwith Kirsten there, and it was obvious that Diana didn’t like the situation anymore than he did. Finally, she came in and sat down in a corner of the room,then whispered to me: “I’m going home soon.” We helped ourselves to gin, havingnothing better to do. After 20 minutes or so, I decided to go down and see whatCunningham was up to, and warn him that Diana wanted to leave. I found Christinesitting up in bed, looking quite happy but very dazed; she said she feltwonderful. Cunningham had apparently produced this effect by stroking herforehead and reciting incantations. We got her out of bed and asked her if shecould walk, but she promptly sat down and began to giggle. She said she wantedto stay in Oliver’s bed, and she put her arms around his neck and began to kisshim—to his obvious embarassment. Then she got back into bed. Oliver talked toher about her mother, but she only said: “I don’t care.” We made two moreattempts to get her to walk, but the third time, she simply went back to sleep.I suggested calling a taxi and sending her home, but this was obviously nosolution. Glasp was in despair—was afraid that the police were probably alreadysearching for her, and that this would provide her father with a perfect excuseto get her away from her mother. Finally, Cunningham said he could suggest onlyone thing: that they should take her upstairs, and he would try to bring herback to consciousness by “magical means.” Glasp didn’t like this idea, butfinally agreed, and Cunningham made various passes over her forehead, toguarantee that she wouldn’t wake before the ceremony was over. It was only hisassurance that Christine wouldn’t know about the ceremony that made Oliveragree. Cunningham picked her up and carried her upstairs. There she was laid onthe bed, and Cunningham explained the situation to Kirsten and Diana. He thenasked Diana to undress Christine. Oliver immediately said that he couldn’t allowthis. Cunningham said that he couldn’t perform a magic ceremony if Christinewere dressed—it might bring her into great danger. In that case, Oliver said,they wouldn’t perform the ceremony at all, and he started to shake Christine andtry to wake her. I could see Oliver was getting hysterical, so I joinedCunningham in persuading him that it made no difference if Christine was asleep.So we left Diana and Carlotta to get her undressed, while Cunningham got out hisblack robes, drew pentagrams on the floor, lit candles on the altar, and startedto burn incense. He also told me that I would have to take off most of myclothes, but that I could keep on my trousers and shirt. He then dropped a smallquantity of some brown powder into a glass of gin, and told me to drink it down.Oliver refused to drink his, until Cunningham told him that he would either haveto participate in the ceremony or go out of the room. He then agreed to drinkthe stuff. I noticed no immediate effect except a burning sensation on mytongue. But within a matter of minutes I felt as if I’d drunk a quart ofwhisky—this may have been the effect of gin on an empty stomach.Cunningham now told Diana that she would have to strip and put on the red robe;she was unwilling, but by this time the atmosphere was so electric that shedidn’t make much objection. I noticed that Carlotta made no bones aboutundressing in the middle of the room, and putting on her robe. Glasp lookedquickly in the opposite direction when he saw her, and said: “I say, Cunningham,I hope there’s not going to be any sex?” Cunningham said grandly: “Of coursethere’s going to be sex. The ceremony couldn’t be performed without it.” But hepointed a sort of black wand at Christine and said: “Don’t worry, she won’t betouched.” This seemed to reassure Oliver, and he even took off most of hisclothes until he was also wearing only a shirt and trousers. Cunningham thengave us both short silk jackets to wear—they were bright blue and yellow, andlooked as if they’d been used in a pantomime of Aladdin.Carlotta was helping herself very freely to the gin, and also to the brownpowder. This had an almost immediate effect of plunging her into a condition ofecstasy—she sat on a chair, stretched out her arms, and looked as if she werebeing carried up to heaven by angels.Cunningham said: “I can feel evil currents. We must hurry.” He gave me the sameparchment as before, and Oliver another copy of it, instructing us to call theresponses alternately.It was now about midnight, and Oliver was obviously anxious about gettingChristine home as quickly as possible. He asked Cunningham if we couldn’t hastenthe ceremony, and Cunningham agreed. He warned us all that we must stay insideour pentagrams whatever happened. Diana, who had been changing in Oliver’s room,came in with her robe on, and was given the same task as before—keeping thetripod fed with incense. Cunningham poured her gin, then looked into the jarcontaining the brown powder, and said; “Who’s been taking this?” I pointed toCarlotta, and he said: “Oh Christ, why didn’t you stop her?” I said I didn’tknow anything about it and asked him what it was, but he seemed too worried toreply. He asked her if she felt all right, and she said (without opening hereyes): “Oh, beautiful, BEAU-tiful!” So Cunningham said: “We’d better begin.” Ithought he looked anxious.Since Christine was on the bed where they usually practiced their “sex magic,”he spread a kind of quilted blanket on the floor, and made Carlotta lie on it.Kirsten had fallen into a drunken doze by the fire; he was waked up, made totake off most of his clothes like Oliver and myself, and given one of the bluejackets to wear. He wasn’t given anything to read, but was told to repeat aformula in a loud voice if any evil influences appeared. (It sounded like:“Omfalu gadoris tvasem abishthu”—a language I don’t recognize—but I wouldn’tvouch for my accuracy here.)They then proceeded exactly as before, with the chanting, the kissing ofCarlotta’s navel and breasts, and the act of “sex magic.” I now suspected thatthe brown powder was a sexual stimulant, because I found myself sexually excitedin a way that I cannot describe. But it was not the normal excitement that I cancontrol. There was less of a cerebral element in it; it felt unpleasant, as if Iwas being excited against my will, like being tickled so that it hurts. But itundoubtedly produced quite new sensations in me. I find this difficult toexplain; but it felt as though my brain was like a permanently opened eye. Halfan hour before, I had felt sleepy; now I had a strange, naked sensation insidemy head as if I could never again hope for sleep, and a realization of what itwould be like to get more and more tired and yet be unable to fall asleep. Ialso felt an unpleasant sensation as if I were on waves. I usually associatethis with getting drunk and feeling sick, but in this case, there was nosensation of physical sickness—just a weird feeling of being in a boat at sea.It was getting so dark in the room that I could barely make out the responses;besides, the fumes from the censer were choking. When Oliver’s voice repeatedthe responses, it was very tense, as if his throat had contracted. (He told meafterwards that he felt someone was trying to strangle him; this may have beenbecause he was too close to the censer.)Then Cunningham stood up, leaving Carlotta lying there, looking as if she’dfallen from a great height and broken all her limbs, and went over to thecorner; when he came back, I saw that he was holding a black bird—I’m not surewhat kind of bird it was, but it looked too big to be a crow. He carried this tothe altar, where poor Diana was completely enveloped in smoke, held its headagainst a metal plate, and cut it off with one blow of a heavy knife. Thisshocked me; I hate the idea of killing animals (although I suppose its death wasquick enough). Cunningham then allowed its blood to run into a chalice, madevarious passes over it with his hands, and drank it down in one gulp. I nowbegan to feel ill, and my forehead was sweating. Cunningham then went back toCarlotta, made her sit on a stool, and started to ask her questions. I was notlistening carefully this time. I heard her say that she was in a stone room, andshe thought it was in a pyramid. He pointed to Christine and asked: “Who isholding her captive?” Carlotta said: “No one. She is asleep.” “Who was holdingher captive?” “He who is dressed in black.” (It didn’t strike me until afterwardthat Cunningham was dressed in black.)Cunningham then went over to Christine and began to repeat all kinds of formulasover her, and I got the impression that currents of air started to stir thesmoke in the room. Cunningham suddenly said: “Something is going wrong.” Helooked around, and saw that Diana had sat down on a chest that stood behind her.He said: “Quick, stand up and get back into your circle.” She dragged herself toher feet; I could see she was very tired. I said: “How much longer is this goingon?” Then, as I spoke, both candles suddenly flared up, sputtered, and went out.The room immediately filled with a smell like burnt hair, and I felt dizzy.Carlotta’s voice started to sing a song in German, and Kirsten began to repeatthe formula that Cunningham had given him. Something brushed against me, and Ifelt I had to sit down, so I cautiously lowered myself on to the floor, and satwith my head between my hands. Cunningham’s voice was droning on with hisincantations, and he suddenly called: “No one is to move out of his circle.There are evil spirits in the room.” Carlotta’s voice started to moan: “They arehurting me,” and then there was a sound as if she were vomiting. This time, Ihad no sensation of something strange in the room; although I felt so dizzy thatI couldn’t tell anyway. I heard Oliver’s voice say, very sluggishly: “What areyou doing, Cunningham? What about Christine?,” and Cunningham said: “She’s stillasleep.” Christine’s voice came out of the darkness: “No I’m not.” At thispoint, a strange languor came over me, and a feeling of well-being. I stretchedout on the floor and let myself fall asleep. The last thing I remember was thesound of Carlotta moaning and being sick.When I woke up again, I was in the same room. I looked at my watch; it was fouro’clock. Only Cunningham was still in the room. I said: “Where’s Diana,” andCunningham answered: “I think she’s asleep on Oliver’s bed.” I dragged myself tomy feet, feeling very ill and faraway, and saw that the floor was an awful messof vomit and broken glass. (I didn’t find out where the latter came from.)Cunningham said: “Quick, help me to clean up. I’ve sent for a doctor forCarlotta.” I asked what was wrong with her, and he said: “She’s being sick. Shetook too much of that powder.” (Later, I discovered that the main component ofthe powder was cantharides—Spanish fly—as well as some cocaine. No wonder itknocked me out!) I asked about Oliver, and learned he’d taken Christine home ina taxi.I went downstairs, and found Diana asleep in Oliver’s bed, still wearing therobe. I woke her up and helped her to get dressed. At this point, the doctorarrived, and went up to Kirsten’s room, where Carlotta was apparently in bed.Cunningham then rushed in, and said in a whisper: “Go away quickly, and denythat you’ve been here this evening.” I didn’t need telling twice; I helped Dianadownstairs—she seemed very shaky, but the night air woke her up. When we gothome, she said: “Promise you’ll have no more to do with him.” I promised—I’dalready made up my mind that this was my last experiment in magic. We then fellinto bed, after I’d taken several asprin.As we were falling asleep, she turned over and said: “Gerard, why did you getinto bed with me when I was asleep?” I immediately knew what had happened. Iasked her: “Did I make love to you?” She said: “Yes ... didn’t you?” I said:“No, but I know who did.” I asked her if she was quite certain that someone hadclimbed into bed with her, or whether it was possible she dreamed it. She gotup, and went into the bathroom without a word. A moment later, she came back andsaid: “No, I didn’t dream it.”There seemed nothing we could do about it, so we went to sleep. I could see nopoint in being angry. It wasn’t Diana’s fault—I suppose it was mine, ifanybody’s. And I remembered what I’d written in my journal about Cunningham’sobsession with sexual conquest—with the actual possession of as many women aspossible. And after all, I suppose it makes no difference to anybody, providedthere are no unpleasant consequences.In the morning, I woke up at ten, still feeling ill and drunk, and immediatelyhad to rush to the lavatory. I noticed that my diarrhea caused a burningsensation at the point of evacuation, exactly like the feeling in my mouth whenI took the brown powder in the gin. I have since discovered from a book ontoxicology that this is another sign of cantharides poisoning.In spite of feeling ill, I was anxious to find out if Carlotta was all right.Diana didn’t want to get up, so I left her in bed while I walked around toCunningham’s. As soon as I arrived, I saw the police car outside. At first I wastempted to go back home; then I went in, reflecting that I hadn’t done anythingillegal. I knocked on Oliver’s door; he opened it, and immediately signaled meto be quiet. I asked him what had happened, and he told me that Carlotta hadbeen taken to the hospital, and that the doctor had notified the police—asapparently he was bound to.As we talked, we heard the police coming down the stairs, and Cunningham’s voicewith them. They went out, and we heard the car pull away. I asked aboutChristine; Oliver said he hadn’t heard from her yet; he had taken her home atthree in the morning, and she had thought up some excuse about a schoolfriend ofhers. He hoped her mother believed it. At all events, she seemed none the worsefor her experience. Oliver asked her if she wasn’t frightened to wake up in thedark with strange incantations and the sound of someone vomiting; she said: “No,because I heard your voice and knew it was all right.” We talked for a whileabout what might happen to Cunningham, but it obviously depended on Carlotta’scondition. Besides, both Oliver and I had seen her helping herself to thepowder, so there was no question of blaming Cunningham. I also asked Oliver howDiana had got into his bed. He said Cunningham had carried her down, and that hehad left Cunningham alone with her when the taxi came.I went back home, feeling horribly sick and tired, and wishing I’d stayed inbed. I was sweating, and my whole body was prickling as if I had ants under myclothes. I was afraid I’d collapse in the street. The Saturday morning crowdsmade me feel awful; I felt I’d never have the strength to get home. However, Iarrived—and found Radin’s car outside the door. And when I got up to the room,he was just on the point of leaving. His eyes were glittering, and he called me“my dear Gerard.” I told him I felt too ill to talk to him; he asked me what wasthe matter, and as soon as I mentioned the symptoms, said; “That sounds likecantharides poisoning. You should see a doctor.” I said I only wanted to go tobed and be left alone. I pulled off my clothes and collapsed into bed, feelinghorrible. Radin was persistent. It was soon evident to me that Diana had givenhim an accurate and minute account of the proceedings, omitting nothing. I couldonly nod as he reeled off the whole story and asked me to confirm it. He evenmentioned Christine. At this, I remembered Oliver, and asked him to try to keepher out of it as much as possible. As he left, I asked him how he’d heard aboutit, but all he would say was: “We have our sources.” But I gather thatnewspapers automatically check with all police stations to find if there’sanything happening, and Radin must have told his night editor to let him know ifthere was any news item involving Cunningham.I slept for the rest of the day, although Diana went out and brought a doctor.He simply gave me a sedative, said he thought that I was suffering from ahangover, and went away. Diana seemed better than I was, and looked after me.But she made me promise that if Cunningham came I wouldn’t admit him—justpretend that I wasn’t at home, and keep the door locked.By evening, I was well enough to get up, and sat around reading, feeling veryweak. We went to bed at ten o’clock. I was awakened hours later by the sound ofmy bell ringing. Diana woke up and said: “Don’t answer it.” I didn’t need anyencouraging; I wasn’t going to tramp down three flights of stairs at two in themorning. It went on ringing, and finally, we heard someone coming up the stairs,and knocking on the door. One of the other tenants had opened the front door.Someone’s voice called: “Mr. Sorme, could I speak to you?,” and I realized itwasn’t Cunningham. So I got out of bed, pulled on my dressing gown, and openedthe door.It was a reporter from one of the daily papers. He was carrying a first editionof the Sunday Messenger (which is the Sunday version of the Daily News). Itsheadline read: BLACK MAGIC BY CANDLELIGHT: NEW CARADOC CUNNINGHAM REVELATIONS. Ihad to invite him in—besides, I was curious about the story. It was a fullspread, and Radin had done what he had always hoped to do—get a scoop onCunningham—There was even a photograph of Christine. There were one or twoexaggerations: it declared, for example, that all the women present were naked.But it hinted very plainly that Diana had been raped, and ended by declaringthat Cunningham should be arrested and charged with impairing the morals of aminor.I am told that the article was flagrantly libelous, and that Cunningham mighthave sued them for heavy damages. It dragged up all kinds of things in his past,and even hinted that he had sacrificed babies. It said that Carlotta was on thedanger list, and that he had poisoned her. (Both statements were untrue—shespent a week in the hospital and recovered; but then, Diana hadn’t seen herhelping herself to the brown powder, and assumed that Cunningham had given it toher as he had to the rest of us.)I could see that Cunningham might be in serious trouble, so I gave my ownaccount of it, toning it all down greatly, emphasizing that Christine’s moralshad been in no danger, that he hadn’t given Carlotta the poison, and that hewasn’t practicing black magic but white magic.The reporter spent nearly an hour with us; when he asked Diana if it was trueshe had been violated, I gave her a warning look, and she said No, she didn’tthink so. When we finally got rid of him, I disconnected the bell, and wemanaged to get a good night’s sleep. But the following day was hopeless. Firstthe police came—I gather they were upset by the allegations that they wereallowing black magic to be practiced under their noses—but at least theyconfirmed that Carlotta was in no danger, and that Christine had been examinedby a doctor who verified that she had not been assaulted.After that, a stream of reporters turned up. By midday, I was exhausted, so Ihailed a taxi, and Diana and I drove over to Gertrude’s in Hampstead. We foundKirsten already there—also hiding from reporters. Gertrude was magnificent inthe crisis—no reproaches or anything of the sort; she simply let me go to bedand sleep until evening, and treated Diana with perfect courtesy. (Caroline camein the evening, bringing the actor she’s going to marry, but I was fast asleepand didn’t see her.)The Monday morning papers were also full of the story, and added the informationthat Cunningham was nowhere to be found. We stayed at Gertrude’s for two days,until the thing died down of its own accord, and then went back home. (Gertrudefirmly put Diana in a separate bedroom, though!) We also saw something of FatherO’Mahoney, and although Gertrude has not said anything more about it, I gathershe has every intention of becoming a Roman Catholic. Even Cunningham’s approvaldidn’t put her off.That is pretty well the end of the story, as far as I’m concerned. We have heardno more of Cunningham. Presumably he had no need to go to America; I can’timagine what charges the police could press against him; as far as I know,practicing magic isn’t a legal offense.Diana and I had a great deal of unpleasantness; abusive letters through thepost, and someone even chalked on our door: “Get back to hell where you belong.”The local tradesmen all regarded Diana with suspicion, so that she moved furtheraway to do the shopping. The owner of the flat came to see me, saying that theother tenants of the house were complaining about the publicity, and Iimmediately offered to let him have his flat back for the same amount I’d paidfor it. A week later, he found another tenant. By this time, it was Christmas,and there wasn’t much to be done; we spent it with my family, then came here, toIreland, leaving most of our belongings to be sent after us. Diana had relationsin Galway, so we came here, and almost immediately found ourselves this cottage,which we rent for seven shillings a week. It has its disadvantages: I have toget drinking water from a well in the garden; I am doing my best to poison therats, and the local council wants £50 to connect us to the main electricitysupply. But it is quiet; I’ve started to work on a novel, and never cease tocongratulate myself on getting away from London. Oliver has promised to come andspend some time here later in the year. He is still living in the same place. Igather that the publicity has made the Christine situation difficult, and he hasbeen asked not to see her until the court proceedings about her mother’sseparation have been completed.Poor Cunningham. I didn’t dislike him, and I can’t bring myself to agree withDiana’s resentment. I wonder where he’s living now, and whom he’s driving mad...1 Austin Nunne. Between July and November, 1955, Nunne murdered seven women inthe Spitalfields district of East London. A homosexual with strong sadistictendencies, he was certified insane at the request of his own family andinterned in a private mental home near Ascot; the murders were officially“unsolved” at the time the above was written.2 John Reginald Halliday Christie, a multiple sex murderer. Sexually impotentwith conscious women, he murdered and violated at least five women at his homeat 10 Rillington Place, London W. 11, between 1940 and his arrest in 1953. Healso killed his wife in December 1952.3 Oliver Glasp, the well-known painter, had also been a friend of Austin Nunneand of Gertrude Quincey. In 1954 he met the girl whom I shall call Christine,who was then ten years old. His curious emotional relationship with her led to anervous breakdown, and he left London suddenly in November 1955. At the time ofwriting, I had heard nothing from him for over a year.4 William McGonagall, Scottish poetaster of the 19th century. McGonagall’s workwas so atrocious that it became a popular joke; but as no one ever bothered totell McGonagall why it was popular, he continued to believe himself a greatwriter, and described himself as “William McGonagall, poet and tragedian.”5 J. W. Dunne’s book An Experiment with Time deals with the possibility that wecan have actual visions of the future in dreams; he developed a theory of“serial time” to explain his own dream-experiences of precognition.6 A shoemaker of Casale, Italy, who made two attempts to commit suicide byself-crucifixion. He constructed a machine that would lower a cross from a thirdstory window overlooking the market place, and somehow succeeded in nailinghimself to it. He died of self-starvation in an asylum. Oliver Glasp passedthrough a period when he practiced many self-torments; at this time he madeseveral paintings and sketches of Lovatt’s suicide attempt.7 Labeled by journalists “the world’s wickedest man,” Crowley (1875-1947) was acurious mixture of charlatan and man of genius; he claimed to be a magician, andwas the founder of a cult of “Crowleyanity.” His life has been written by JohnSymonds, under the title of The Great Beast, and by Charles Richard Cammell;Symonds has also written a study of the magic of Crowley.8 For various reasons, connected with the surviving relatives of the man named,it has been thought advisable to suppress the next sentence.

The press had no idea of my whereabouts for several weeks after Ileft the Whitechapel flat, and I had no idea that my journals were not still ina locked box, waiting with the rest of my books to be sent on to me when I founda permanent address. Consequently, I had no idea of my sudden leap to notorietyuntil, in Galway, I saw a newspaper headline: IDENTITY OF WHITECHAPEL MURDERERDISCLOSED IN SEX DIARY.Radin’s paper had another “scoop.” There were also photographs of Oliver and ofAustin Nunne’s father; the article talked about a “plot to evade justice” andabout the serious consequences for all who knew that Austin was the Whitechapelkiller. These stories died out two days later when it was revealed that thepolice had always been fairly certain of the identity of the Whitechapel killer,but had dropped the case for lack of sufficient evidence, and because Austin’sfather had undertaken to ensure that he would be permanently confined in aprivate mental home with no possibility of escape. Later, Austin was examined bya number of doctors, who found him to be suffering from a venereal disease thathad affected his brain tissue, so that he would be completely unable tounderstand the proceedings if he should be brought to trial.In the meantime, I took care to keep my whereabouts a secret. I found myself acottage and then, when I was certain that there was no further possibility ofproceedings, wrote to my former landlord, and arranged to have my belongingssent on. In the following weeks, I was interviewed by a great number ofreporters, and by the police. Like most press sensations, this one was dead andforgotten in a matter of weeks, and I was able to work quietly on the finalchapters of my book. I was later attacked by Radin for allowing extracts from myjournals to be printed in a Sunday newspaper, and for accepting a large sum ofmoney from the newspaper. I have already, in my prefatory note, explained myreasons for doing this.When Methods and Techniques of Self-Deception appeared in the autumn of 1957, Iwas startled by the amount of attention that it attracted—out of all proportionto the number of readers I expected to interest. At first I congratulated myselfon the size of the audience it had reached, and it took several months for me torealize that it was being bought on the basis of my dubious notoriety, but wasnot being read. In spite of its sale, both here and in America, it had noaudience—for the readers I had originally hoped to reach were put off by thepublicity the book received. All this became very obvious to me when my secondand third books were published, and were attacked and praised in a way thatappeared to have no connection with the content of the books themselves. Thisprovides me with a further reason for publishing these journals without anyattempt at editing. I am told that some of the aims and motives revealed in themare hardly creditable, and that some passages are extremely damaging. I feelthat this is preferable to the present tangle of misunderstanding. There isnothing here that I think worth concealing.Caradoc Cunningham was recently deported from the United States, after thelatest “Cunningham scandal” in Los Angeles was given wide coverage in Americannewspapers, and was taken up in England by the newspapers who were so prominentin attacking him six years ago. I am told that he is at present living in MexicoCity, supported by members of various Cunningham Societies in the United States.I also hear that his books are regarded as having scriptural authority, and thathe is the founder of a new religion."},{"pageContent":"VISIONS is a series of visionary books by 20th Century writers published byRonin in new quality editions.An exploration of male sexual obsession by the first of England’s “angry youngmen,” author of The Outsider, Mind Parasites, and The Occult.Man Without a Shadowby Colin Wilson“My kind of good read ... a psych-probe satire”—Timothy LearyCan a young seeker find enlightenment by intense sexual experience?
