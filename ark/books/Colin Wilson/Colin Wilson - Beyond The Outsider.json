These books are closely linked - so closely that it is impossible for any orre oi them to be fully under-stood without the others. Each approaches the same problem from a difierent angle, and attempts to develop the viewpoint outlined in the pre- vious book. As these books appeared between 1956 and 1968, I was surprised that no reviewer appeared to notice ihat all wele _a part of the same thesis. Only Religion and the Rebel seemed to be regarded as having any conne€tion with The Outsider. The Age of Defeat was reviewed as a book about 'the vanishing hero', The Strength to Dream as a book about the imagination, Origins oy tne Sexual Impulse as an attack on Freud, and so on. And it was generally alleged against them all that no consistent viewpoin! *uf presented, that they were, so to speak, anthologies of ideas rather than an attempt to deveiop a thesis. Only one reviewer of The Streigth to Dream observed that I seemed to be trying to pioduce a .new philosophical synthesis' based on existentialism and romanticism. To some extent, the reason for this was obvious enoug.h: before the publication of the present volume it would have taken a fairly careful reading of the previous five volumes to recognize the direction ,in which they werg tending.

Moreover, some of the most eminent of existentialist philosophers have dressed up certain of their personal pre;udicei and shortcomings in an impressive and abstraci language, thus making tie various issues all the more difficuli to sort out. r felt-that my resentment of the central problem, with its re- emphasis on the personal, was a modest but worthwhile contribution to existential thinking. _ My point was taken - at least, I iupposg it was, for the book achieved a succe_ss beyond anything r had expected. But critics were not slow to pointlout ihat its statement of the problems was a great dear more satisfying than its atgempt at solutions. r myself became aware, in the dis cussions that followed, that a broad.er stand.point was needed, and Retigion and, the Rebel was an attempt to establish such a standpoint.

Work seemed a good way to avoid self-pity. I produced three novels deal- irg with. different aspects of my existentialism, and another 'philosophical' book, The Strength to Dream, dealing mainly with the problem of nihilism in modern writers. I even underlined my rejection of Sartre's abstractionism by making an encyclopedia of murder a vehicle for expounding my theory of the 'intentionality of values'. When these books had been published, I had to acknowledge that I was still back where I started, six years before. Ignoring the ideas in my books now seemed to have become a critical tradition. Reviews still tended to be personal. Sometimes a critic admired my per- sistence in writing the kind of books I wanted to write 'in spite of the vertiginous ups and downs of my literary ca^reer'; others dedared angrily that it was time I stopped regurgitating the books I had read or that publishers slopped accepting my work. By now, I felt like jrlmping up and down and shouting: 'But what about the id,eas?' I,recognized that this indifierence was partly because England and America have no tradition of interest:.in ideas. But more basically, it was the result of the curious reputation I had acquired in 1956, which made it irn- pogsible for critics even to take the preliminary step of assuming that I might have something worth saying. In the autumn of 196r I went to the United States to make a tour of universities. The attempts to compress my ideas into ninety-minute lectures provided the stimulus for a projected final volume of the 'outsider cycle', to b€ called An Outline of a New Existentialism. This volume $las started early in 196*, but I soon began torencounter difficulties; To begin with, it was difficult to know how much knowledge of the previous volumes could be 3wumed, in my readers. Second, the section dealing with the, phenomenological analysis of sex. threatened to occupy half the volume. I solved this latter problem by detaching the $ection and publishing it as a separate volume. Even so, the book \\ras too long. Since it would obviously be the most important of the series, it was necessary that the argument should be prgsented as deanly as possible. Several revisions and rewritings have compressed it to its present size. At first I was dubious about speaking of 'the outsider cycle'; since a cycle returns to its starting point. But whefr I was writing the final chapter of this 6obk, I found my- self summarizing the problem - and my solution of it - in terms of Sartre's Nausea and Wells's Mind at the End ol lts Tether, the books analysed in the first chapter of The Outsider. In a sense, therefore, it can be called a cycle. The impetus behind these books has been a kind of frustration. I felt like a mathematician who has been handed a problem that has baffied the ingenuity of several earlier generations of mathematicians; the last page has the word 'insoluble' scrawled over it. It seemed to me that constructive philosophical thinking is im- possible in the face of this 'insoluble'. Philosophical thought needs a sound basis if it is to develop . and ex- pand in the way th'at scientific thought was able to de- velop after Newton. The 'outsider cycle' is an attempr to provide such a basis; the attempt involved a care.ful analysis of the cultural trends of the past three hundred years, a 're-checking' of the previous calculations. The present book offers my conclusions in as orderly a. manner as my naturally untidy mind will allow. What is presented is not a 'system' in the Hegelian Eense although it is self complete - but the preconditions for a system. I should conclude with an apology. This is about fiy use of the phrase 'St Neot margin', ,which I define in Chapter r. This notion of a tax on consciousness, an in- difference threshold, has seerred to me for fnany yeirrs flow the central problern of existence philosophy. t4 t5"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":": INTRODUCTION Trrrs BooK argues that a point has arrived in twentieth-century ihought when a completely new im' pulse and direction is needed. It may ryetl be that futufe lenerations will, describe the first half of the twen{\",h i\"trt.rty as 'the age of meaninglessness'. The sense of lack of rueaning, of purpose, dominates our literature, art and philosophy. fnbr. is a general feeling that the certainties irrovided by religion have been lost, and can nev€r be ieplaced; science, by solving our Practic-al_-problems, can oniy make this inner void more painfully obvious. It seeurs self-evident that in this sense of purpose,'inner- direction, western culture has been running at a hreavy loss for at least a hundred years; it is a matter for specu- larion how long it can go on before becoming completely bankrupt. This- problem of meaninglessness has brought iruo being thl philosophy known as existentialism. But far from being able to offelany consolation, existentialism has only confirmed the\"diagnosis. The sense of universal purpose offered by religion was a lie. Man believes him' ietf-important and unlque because he has to; the sad truth ii that he is neither. Man is a paradoxical being who believes that.he is distinguished from the animals by his 'thirst for truth'. The thirst for truth has taught him that this difierence does not really exist; truth is a de- structive appetite. Now soiiety is unable to work on this premise of meaninglessness; it must take for granted certain values and standards. Inevitably, then, those who are most aware of the sense of meaninglessness feel alienated from society. The consequence is that nearly all serious litera- ture of the past sixty years has expressed this sense of alienation, and could be called 'literature of protest'. This was the starting point of the first volume of this cycle, The Outsider, and the reason that it was sub-titled t7 'i. Unfortunately, no other existential philosopher seems to have made use of the concept; and try as I will, I cannot think of a phrase that defines this tendency that might be called 'the law of entropy in prehension'. 'St Neot margin', apafi from being merely a personal label, is un- satisfactory in that it seems to apply .to a thing rather than to a tendency: to the door-spring, as it were, rather than to the door's tendency to close. So at the risk of seeming egoistic, I have retained the phrase 'St Neot margin; - enclosing it in inverted commas to indicate that I am not too happy about it. r6"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"'An inquiry into the nature of the sickness of mankind in the mid.twentieth century'. For the protest itself has re- mained confused and incoherent. One writer puts the blame on the failure of human beings to communicate, another on original sin, another on human stupidity and cruelty, another on. the present social system (whatever it happens to be). The Outsider was an attempt to find out whether these protests amount to a coherent indictment, arrd whether, when the whole indictment has been con- sidered, there is any ground for hope. It is necessary to recognize that the problem has two aspects. The 'outsider problem' is partly the problem of the' abnormal individual in society. If this aspect is allowed to assume too much importance, it rbduces thb whole problem to nonsense, since most people are 'abnormal' in some way or another, and one might reasonably object that the word 'outsider' is meaningless as a classifrcation. But more fundamentally, the 'outsider problem' is the problem of existential phiiosophy. If it is approached from this angle, the blurred lines become clear and sharp. For the kind of problems presented by Heidegger, Sartre and Camus only become apparent when mind has developed to a certain level. Tha man who is aware of these problems is therefore in the posi- tion of Wells's hero in The Country of the Blind,. ' According to Sartre, the fundamental problem is that of human 'contingenc)', the 'unnecessary' quality of human life. This amounts to the problem of meaning- lessness already mentioned, since ii tite has a meanin[, theh objective values exist, and man is not a creature of chance, but part of a design. Equally important is the problem of 'absurdity', described by Camus and Heidegger. This is closely bound up with the problem of time. Man is not dependent for his values upon his phys- ical needs; he also has an appetite for 'truth for its own sake'. 'Truth' is timeless, and in so far as he pursues truth, the philosopher dissociates himself from his tem- poral aspect - his personflity and personal problems. Yet r8 he can never wholly dissociate himself, for even thought takes time. The philosopher finds himself in the position of a man in charge of a team of two horses that insist on running oft at ttght angleb to one another. Plato and Plotinus solved the paradox by declating the body an irrelevancy; Plato reached the 'absurd' conclusion that the philoiopher's quest reaches its consummation in deatli, when mind -is 'freed' from the body. This is obviously no answer, and the paradox remains. The only other way of resolving it is to declare that man is mis- taken in be[eving thai he has a 'will to truth' - that it is only a disguised form of some lower appetite. This in itself leads to a paradox, for it is the will to truth that has led to this cdnclusion, and that leads us to accept it. Therefore it must exist. And yet if we accept its real exis tence we immediately face another problem. An animal gdes on living because it has no choice; the demands of ihe moment constitute its values. It accepts life and it accepts death unquestioningly. This, on the whole, would seem to be a sensible thing to do. But if the human mind really has this will to truth, then it has the right to make a choice based upon an attempt at a 'summing up'. Philosophers from Ecclesiastes and Aristotle onward have been inclined to declare that life is a cheat, that its 'con- tras' outweigh its 'pros'. In that case, surely a funda- mental problem is whether the philosopher should com- mit suicide? Camus declared that suicide is the most basic of all philosophical problems; and yet one might disagree *it! Lim. It might ieem so to a philosopher who was inclined to take a Hardyesque view of life and fate. ('What has Providence done to Mr Hardy that he should rise up ... and shake his fist at his Creator?' asked Edmund Gosse.) But surely a more obvious one is the problem, of the meaninglessness and boredom of the human :life, the strang€ human incapacity to lay hold on experience.* * To which I shalt later refer as the problem of the 'St Neot margin'. r9"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":", ,,.r;ll4:.y: ' i: ,.:i ! ii ,i::,!: ::itJ, This aspect .is summarized in'the nursery tale of the old woman who lived in a vinegar bottle. A passing fuiry heard the old woman complaining about her unh'aPPy Iot, and obligingly transforrded the vinegar bottle into a pretty cottage. Passing by again some time later, she ttopped to $ee how the old woman was enjoying life, and again found her complainirg - that the cottage was dhmp, too small, etc. The fairy changed the cottage into a small house. A month or so later,,passing the spot, she 'heard the old rvoman complainitg - she needed seryants, etc. The fairy changed the house into a palace. A few months later the old woman was still as dissatisfied as ever - the place was too big, cold, etc.; this time the fairy lost patience and changed the palace back into a vinegar bottle. Iluman beings seem to have no caPacity for freedom' This is the outcome of the 'meaninglessness'. They re- spond to negative stimuli - pain, inconvenience - in short, loss of freedom - and yet freedom immediately re- veals their fundamental lack of purpose. Threats to free- dom force them to climb a few stePs of the ladder towards .motive, towards intensity of purpose; but as $oon as the threats-disappear, they slip down to the bottom again. Again, an animal can never be aware of this problem, since all its motives are 'negative' in this sense. But then, life as lived by most animals provides plenty of this kind of motive. Man's will to truth has also given him an abundance of leisure in which to exercise it, and this leisure forces him to recognize that, as a motive, 'truth' is infinitely weaker than hunger or fear. He is like a slave who has clamoured all his life for freedom, and then dis- covers that freedom leaves him motiveless and listless, the victlm of his own boredom. This is the reason for the decline in the 'stature' of the hero in twentieth century literature (which I analysed in The Age of Defeat). Tbe eighteenth century waS inclined to glorify man's intellect and will; the nineteenth century recognized that they are incapable of sustaining the weight of freedorn; the go twentieth century is inclined to take the defeat for granted. But then, the problem has another aspect that is hardly taken into account by such writers as-Camus, Sarre and Heidegger. They seem to take it for granted that life is a difficult and dull business with occasional glimpses of the underlying futility and 'contingency'; but most healthy .people have experiences that are the opposite of the 'nausea', moments th:at seetn to involve a recognition of underlying meaning, and lead one to suspect that the answer to at least one of the problems may lie closer at hand than we generally recognize. T. E- Lawtence, for example, can write: We started off on one of those clear dawns that wake up the senses with the sun. . ., For an hour or two, on such a morning the sounds, scents and colours of the world struck man individually and directly, not ft,lt- ered through or made typical by thought. (My italics.) Certainly, we would exPect that the people who are most aware of these problerns of contingency and.absurd- ity are irrclined to filter the world through their thought, and rob it of some of the meaning that it naturally Ipssesses. This, in fact, is the claim made by Aldous l{ux- Iey, who experimented with mescalin, and discovered that the dr\"S had the power to restore percePtion of the 'is-ness of things'. It seems, then, that we should at leart make some allowances for the distortions imposed by thought in the work of some of the more pessimistic existentialists, and recognize that at least a Patt of the answer lies in some discipline for preventing these dis tortions and re-establishing a more direct contact with 'existence'. (Huxley suggested that mescalin should be made as generally available as tobacco, but there are ob' jections to this.*) There is a philosophical method whose purPose is to * See APPendix I. 8r"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"uncover these' 'distortions imposed by thought,; it is called phenomenology, and one of the aims ofthis book will be to apply the phenomenological method to the problems that have been outlined above, to discover how T*y of them are genuine problems, and how many are {ue to-'thought riddled narure'. It is generally accepted that phenomenology is the srarting point of the exi6ten- tialism of Heidegger and Sartre; yer, as I shall artempt to show, their negative condusions are laigely the resrilt of turning their backs on the most important aspects of' phenomenology. The aim of this book, then, is to create a foundation for a 'new existentialism'. All existentialism begrns from the same point; the boredom and meaninglessness that axe inherent in the human situation, marri incapacity for freedom, his glimpses of meaning. These lattEr are far too rare, so it is difficult for philosophy to assess their value. The situation might bi compared to that of a blind man who relies on rwo adviseis whose suggestions always conflict. one ofiers advice that is bold ail excit- in_g; unfortunate-l-y, he appears for only one day a year. The other is dull and cautious; his advice seems to be based on pessimism. But it is difrcult to reject it, since he is present for the rema.ining three hundred and sixty-four days of the year. Each man has his two advisers, \"rrd his assessment of his existence is based on his estimate of the relative value of their advice. This is the most funda- y.3t+ reality of the human situation. Ary philosophical 'solution' must be tested by refenr\"ing to ii.' - It lr pelhaps unnecessary to add that, although some of the fundamental ideas of this book are tr-ke, from Husserl and Whitehead, the synthesis is my own.

He looked at the world as a savage might look at a power plant; it was bewildering, noisy, oier- whelming; still, somebody understood what it was all about. It had purpose. . But this simile fails to convey an important aspect of the medieval world-view. If a workman in a facrory accidentally knocked over a bucket, even the rur\"gi would infer that this accident was not as pur?osive as the, movement of the conveyor belts. But in the medieval world picture, there were no accidents. A sparrow falling from a tree was part of the design of providence. The basic problem of human existence is so simple that no philosopher has succeeded in stating it. People do not spend their time 'weighing up existence' in order to get through the average working day. And yet every, thing we do betrays a basic attitude to life, revealing that, in a,certain sense, everything has been weighed up and judged. A man's handwritin[, even the wai he tiei his shoelace, reveals his character, and character itself is nothing less than a series of acts that 'pass judgementf on human life. An exa\"mple may clarify this. In Conrad's Heart of Darh,nes;., ,Mr Kurtz dies muttering 'The horror! The horror!' And Conrad's narrator Comments: 'fle had. summed up - he had judged.' All this makes it sound as if Kurtz had had_ somg final glimp_se q41 th-e evil in the universe opposed to the good, and had decided that evitr. has the last word. And yet when Marlow describes his own glimpse of the 'heart of darkness', it is clear that it is not a summary at all: It is the most unexciting Contest you can imagine. It takes place in an unpalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot with nothing around; without spectators, without clamour, without glory ... in a sicktry atrno- sphere of tepid scepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary .. . I was within a hair's breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement, and I found . . . that f'would irur. nothing to say. This is closer to it - to the basic atmosphere of human life, and human death. It is not merely ihat there is no 'opportunity for pronouncement'. Pronouncement is irrelevant to it, and this is part of the 'horror'. ' It is not a conflict between Carlyle's 'eternal yes and eternal no', which is stated so clearly by Van Gogh or Ivan Karamazov. It is an even more fundamental con- flict. It is the question of whether it is even worth mak- ing an act of will. There is an immense basic problem here, and if it could only be stated clearly, it would be somewhat nearer solution. ,To begrn with, this attitude of 'unheroic nihilism' rqight be called an indictment of human existence, or perhaps of the meaning of human existence. What exactly does this indictment amount to? Basically, it is a feeling that human beings can rrcver escape illusions, that they live and die enmeshed' in them. The feeling is expressed with considerable power in Eliot's Hollow Men, which has an epigraph from' Heart af Darkness.

In exchange, it asks that one places c€r- .i tain social values above self-interest. In making this '. sacrifice, the individual's life is given meaning; he comes i'. to opt out :- p'articularly if he feels that society is iot ., keeping its half of the bargain and making him feel as if he 'belongs'. fle can revert to total self-interest, and be- come a criminal. But this revolt is only a half measure, for while rejecting society, the criminal continues to acc€pt that he is a part of it. If he were cour?,qeous enough to carry his individualism to its limits, ro turn his back completely on other human beings, he would soon reyert to the purely animal level; the rejection . would hurl him into a void of meaninglessness. In the words of Henry James senior, society 'redeems' men ftom their animal selves. But if values are'merely a social,in- vention - a part of a system of mutual admiration, as it were then Eliot and Beckett and Hemingwai a^re right: we are biological accidents, hollow men. The uni- verse is indifierent to us. I,Vehad better make the most of one another, huddle together to gain a little warmth, and recognize that death is the end. And yet, somehow the mind cannot, accept that values are completely relative, even allowing that most of our - 'value reaetions' are emotional rather than intellectual. If they are, then the Marquis de Sade was right, and there is no good re'ason why we should condemn him for indulging in daydreams of fuing pregnant women out of cannons. Individual pleasure is as valid a standard as social duty - more so, in fact, because the advocates of duty imagine it to be an obiective rralue and are there- fore deceiving themselves. De Sade's relativism is atl veiy rqell, but the nose detects something wrong with it, just - as it detectq something wrong with Beckettis attitude.

The image that can be found i' in so many modern novels - of the hero staring at a cob- web in the corner of the ceiling and feeling no desire to do anythirg - is a symbol of a\"certain uspect of modern consciousness. We examine life; it is poker-faced, appax- , ently meaningless.

I All this indicates that the charge of total meaningles* ness brought against human existlnce by Sartre, Beikett, etc, is. not entirely fair. It seems that the indictment should at least be softened a'little, and some of the blame put on human nature. When a Beckett character cgr.nplains that nothing is worth doing, or Greene de- clares that life is a long drawn out defbar, we might at . Ieast ask how far this is our own fault.

On the contrary, the evidence seems to in- dicate that pessimism is often related to lack of early struggles. Kierkegaard, Andreyev, Proust, Beckett, Greene and Eliot were all born in fairly comfortable circumstances; Proust frankly^ admits that most of his later troubles.were the outcome of being spoiled by his mother. But the intelligent man who starti'ai the bottom' of society cannot afford the luxury of cynicism or pes- simism; he harnesses his mind to the problem of impiov- ing his position as he might harness a dray horse to a cart that is stuck in the mud. If he succeeds -'as Lawrence, Ifells, Shaw, N€xo and Gorki succeeded - then he has also taught himself a pracrical view of the intellect and its relation to civilization, so that he feels that the next !!gp ir to harness it to rhe problems of h|s age. Beckert's 'Nothing to be done' never enters his head because if he believed it, he would still be drudging at some badly paid job. fh-\". keyword here is purpose; without purpose, the mind is left ro support irs own weight. Shiw'j St Joan comments: 'Minding your own business is like minding ryyr own body - it's the shortest way to make yourself sick.' The heroes of Proust and Beckett are a case in point; they have norhing to do but mind their own busi- ness and their own bodies. The question: -What-purpose? is not of primary im- portance; but it is usually connected in sorfie way'with society. Even D. H. Lawrence, who disapproved of 'Christ a$ much as of Caesar, believed thar the artist is a life). His^ writings_and liter_ary personality are in many ways remi- niscerrt of r. E. Hulme - although the resemblance did not extend to their, personal lives. capetanakis was modest and self-eftacing. t4 spiritual leader of society, whose tsok is .to reveal the life mystery and by his revelation create a new possibility, a strange element in life'* (my itarics). Thise words ,a Ixange element in life'-g-o to the heart of the problem. For Beckett characters, hre is boring and limited: one of them says that 'the e'arth is extingulshed, though r never saw it lir'. This is only ro say thit, unlike Lairrence, he has never seen life as u ,.ui* of supra-personal possi- bility. Laziness, habit and weakness liirit is. The answer is self-discipline,-self-control. shaw points out that self- control, 'a highly deveroped vitar s.irse, dominating and regulating the T\"r: appeiites,, is the fundamental qiality needed for survival and evolution. since Beckett ct uruc- ters feel they have no reason for self-discipline, it follows that they are doomed to remain spiritullly static. The u.dlll': capacity for freedom is suferior to that of the child because he is more capable of- self-discipline. Purpose means_ escape jrom the persoiat. This is lyferbll expressed bI H. G. Wells in a passage of The Undying Fire, where Job Huss talks of edircatiJn: Man ... is born as the beasts are born, a greedy egotism, a clutching desire, a thing of lusts and-fears. fre can regard nothing except in ieration to himself.

The descendants of the marnmoth and sabre- toothed tiger are still with us because they had learned the trick of adjusting their bodily temperature to a- change of environment. The dinosaurs - like the reptiles of today had a constant body temperature; conse- quently they disappeared. Early man had yet another faculty to help survival: Ianguage. Many animals - monkeys, for example - have cries that express a definite meaning: 'Enemy approach- ing', 'Baby fallen out of tree', etc. fluman language no doubt began in this primitive way, and developed under the pressure of the need to survive. And yet no theory involving enemies - animate or otherwise - can explain the development of these natural cries into a symbol lan- gu'age. Anyone who has worked with nawies or farm Iabourers knows how little language is needed for co. ordinated work. Instead of enemies and dangers, it is now necessary to posit another equally important pres- sure: boredom. Perhaps some sudden improvement in natural conditlons allowed our priinate ancestors to relax after thousands of generations of hard struggle that demanded cunning and vigilance. This relaxation would have the effect that prison has on the criminal; for an enounous percentage, it would cause degeneration, and lower the survival capacity. But a very tiny number would be the equivalent of the modern man of genius; the energy would flow inwards, animate the brain. So it may be that we owe all our civilization to some chance improvement in environment - like the warm periods betrueen the great ice caps of the Pleistocene - that created the most valuable of all commodities, leisure, and its concomitant, boredom. The earliest development of the brain was not in the direction of language, but simply of imagination - the power to envisage something beiond the immediate en- vironment. W. Grey Walter points out that all animals by, marr lack the ability to envisage any change in 38 environment.* 'Unable to rehearse the possible conse- quences of different responses to a stimulus, without any faculty of planning, the apes and other animals cannor 'learn to control their feelings.'The chimpanzees, nearest creature to man, 'cannot retain an image long enough to reflect on it'. The human brain, more or less identical with the brains we know today, has existed for about half a mil- lion years, possibly longer. And yet learning, science, has come into existence only in the past three thousand ,years. ft is true that the earliest development of rehgro5r was also the development of science. When a man was frightened by the thunder, and concluded that ir was an angry God, he had advanced a hypothesis ro unify his experience of storms. This is the definition of science - the creation of unifying hyporheses. And all evolution is an unconscious urge of the whole being to unify its experience Changes in a species occur by what biologists call rnutations: These firutations may explain how some early ape man decided to walk on his hind legs or to make language grunts, but they cannot explain why certain civilizations showed particular aptitudes. The Chaldeans s€em to have been the first to have noted the arrange- ment of the stars; the Egyptians invented geometry; the Hittites learned to smelt iron. The Ancient Greeks took a step that was greater than any of these, and invent€d science and philosophy. We know of no previous de- velopment of civilization that will explain why the Greeks developed this love of 'knowledge for iti own sake', as distinguished from knowledge for practical pur poses. Possibly the Greeks had more Ieisure than the Chaldeans- or the Hittites, and invented science a$ modern journalism inventedl the crossword. puzzle.

Goethe at least believed in an .un- seen world' of which this one is merely a reflection. But as the .century went oD, and science progressed, the romantics became gloomily certain that,'for- all his im- mortal spirit, man is an accident in an indifierent uni- verse. For all his aspirations, he sufiers from boredom, lack \"f pl1pgse, weakness, sickness, a sense of futiliry: ,The poet Iileist was a kind of living Faust, who was so ;ov€rcorrre by the philosophy of Kantind the'feeling that human b:ilgr can never know certainty, that he\"com_ mitted suicide. THE NEW ROMANl'ICISM-EXISTENTIALISM 4od yet although romanticism ended in exhaustion and deJeat, a third 'assault on the Bastille' was being pre- pT.g. Existentialism was founded by a typical romantic, Kierkegaard, who felt that tlre worrd and the spirit are 44 forever at war. But in the twentieth century, it was taken up by a number of thinkers who had no such romantic predisposition ro defear. Men like Heidegger, Jaspers and'Marcel recognized rhat the failure of?maiticisrn was due to the failure of language. Their txistentialism, yp \"S.I \" r9y romanricism, given the added precision of a philosophical vocabulary. rt shourd nor be assumed that-new language is- merely a matter of inventing new words, or even new ideas, like Heidegger's 'authentic and iirauthentic existence'. First of all, i\"whole new frame- \"work of ideas has to be created; new language then de- y:l\".p: naturally from new ways of .seein{tfrJ old ideas.

Hei{egge-r proceedea to deverop I ir\"* psych.o- logy of man based upon the idea that ali our modirr, itt, spring from 'forgetfulness of Existence'. Gabriel Marcel was..also preoccupied with the 'rediscovery of the im- mediate' that has been lost in abstract thought, but tried to link his thought with tradirional metapiysics. - By this time - the mid-rgsos - existeitiarism was in the air of the cenrury; it is piesenr in rhe poetry of Rilke and Eliot, and in James Joyce's determiried rejection of the 'novel of ideas'.

Both camus and sartre are cloir to the Kierkegaard tradition; they ask again the question of values in a universe of chance,. Existentialism has again placed the question of human existence under the 'language micror.oi\",.

The real problem is to reconcile the demands of a healthy individuarism with those of a healthy sociery. A healthy individualism could be de- fined as one that is not neurotic or serf-destructive. The same is true of a healthy society; it would aim at a heightening of creative vitality in all its members. _ _A little thought reveals the fallacy of the Rimbaud- Miller type of individualism. obviousr.y, a healthy 49 i,l .i i'l :l:. t'. ti. ,i j i, \\ l\"i ,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"society would !. u society of healthy individuals.

But ,rr. -rJ 5t"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"world is irritatingly un.mathematical; it is full of vio- lence and uncertainty. So Greek thought declared that 'the real world is unimportant, an illusion. Reality lies in the world of ideas. Before a carpenter can make a chair, he must have an idea of a chair; consequently, the idea must be more important than the actual chair. One can destroy the chair, -und it is easy enough to make another; but if the idea were destroyed no chairs could be made. The idea is like the mould in which all real things are cast. Somewhere behind the fagade of reality, according to Plato, there is a world in whith these *o.ridr are keptl This real world can be glimpsed behind the everyday world of change if one stares hard enough. The everyday world is like a fence with small cracks between each board. If you apply your eye to the crack, you will see . only a narrow strip of the world on the other side. But if you ride past the fence on a bicycle, all the cracks seem to merge together, as if the fence were semi-transparent, and you can see everything that lies behind it. But speed is essential. And in the same way, one needs speed in a mental sense - intellectual vitality and curiosity - to see the eternal world of ideas that lies behind rhe changing face of the material world. There is obviously a basic truth in this. But Greek thought threw out the baby with the bath water. Since the philosopher spends his life trying to ignore the real world and study the world on 'the other side of the fence', he will achieve final freedom in death. This is the argument with which Socrates comforts his friends on the day of his execution, and the reason he gives for not escaping while he had the chance. He does not explain why, in that case, he did not commit suicide as soon as he decided to be a philosopher. The world-rejection of Greek thought dominated philosophy for the nexr two thousand years. In,$urope, it happened to fit in very well with the world-rejection-of Christianity. Then its weaknesses began to appear. Aristotle was regarded as the great scientist and r6alist, ,,'.. in contrast to Plato's idealism. But Aristotle, like plato, felt rather contemptuous of the material world; he was inclined to make assertions without testing them. He de- clared, for ex'ample, that an object aroflpea from the mast of a moving ship will fall behind the mast; he also believed that heavier bodies fall fasrer than lighter ones.* fle was aware of the theories of earlier thinkers that the earth revolves round the sun, and that it has an axial rotation, but he rejected them in favour of the idea that the earth is the centre of the universe. - The great revolution came nearly two thousand years later, with Galileo. He proved that ,all bodies fall ai the same speed. I{e invented a telescope and discovered the moons_ of Jupiter, confirming the theory of Copernicus that the sun is the centre of our system. Ha rolled weights down an inclined plane and concluded that a moving body will continue to move unless something stops it. Galileo practised what Aristotle only preached - close observation of nature. THE SOURCE OF CONFUSION_DESCARTES Y99jr\" phitosophy begins with a conremporary of Galileo, Rend Descartes. Descartes was a mathematician and a scientist, and he asked what he considered to be the fundamental question: What can we know for certain? Descartes began with the principle that one musr doubt everything, then went on to ask: Can I be certain that I am sitting here in rhis chair? No, for it is possible that I might be dreaming. What, then, do I know for certain? I know that I exist, because I am thinking. -Descartes' principle of 'radical doubt' was accepted by 'all--subsequenr philosophers. It is rhe applicaiion to philosophy of Galileo's principle: 'Test everything., Bur the. _principle had an unfortunate .orr.q.r.r..e; it d,iuided'science from philosophy.

Descartes was carried away by enthusiasm for the scientific method, which, after two thousand years, was now revolutionizing human knowledge. science exam- ines the world through a magnifyiig glass; so Des- cartes naively proceeded to examine the hu-man situation through a 11g-nifying glass, rrying ro reduce everything to reason. Oddly g-ngugh, he did not apply his principlI of doubt to his ieligio;, and contirrr.di,r'r\"guri himietf as a good catholic. so it is not surprising thit his system should be confused and self-divided,- with religious dogma on the one hand and. naive rationalism on the other. His rationalism led him to decide that animals are complicated machines withour a sour. This led to a diffi- _cult problem. If animals are really clockwork, how do we know that men are not also clockwork? .Because,, Des- cartes replied, 'r know I have a soul. I think, therefore r am.' But if an animal can go through all the motions of being alive without-really_being alive, then is there any need, for a soul to drive the human clockwork? plainty not. The soul, Descartes said, lives in the brain, and can indirectly influence the body. Descartes' disciple Geu- lincx saw the inconsistencies in this theory, and iook it to an extreme. The soul has no influence on the body at all. rt is true that if you want to raise your arm, you'can do so; but this is on-ll because the soul and the boay are like two clocks that have been synchronized by God. one of them shows the hour, and the other strikes. we imagine that they are connected, but this is an illusion. Geulincx's 'improvement' of Descartes is typical of modern philosophy. A theory is serf-contradiclory; but instead of checking the premises, another theorisi i\"r.., the contradictions to an extreme, and reduces the whole 1hi$- to absurdity - but also ro consistency. If Descartes had been bold enough, he would have taken his own radical doubt to an extreme and decrared that men are also machines, that consciousness is an illusion produced by the_ body,-and that all religion is a producr of igrror- ance. Later thinkers took these steps. comte founded the school of positivism, that declared rerigion to be non- sense; Ernst Mach declared that consciouiness is merely a series of sensory impressions; the leader of the n.- haviourist group of psychologists, J. B. 'Watson, wrote '. .. no behaviourist has observed anything that he can .41 consciousness, sensarion, imagiry, [erception or will'. Yet another soup of philosophers took Descartes' principle of doubt still furiher, urr-d continued the work of reducing-man to a machine.

In the Meno, socrates per- suades a slave to reason out a geometrical problem, ind -goes _on_ to argue that the slave already possessed the knowledge inside himself; it is onry u q,r.rtitn of getting it out inro consciousness.

L ' - Bishop Berkeley went a step further. Descartes had already said that we can only i<.now the physical world through the mind.

Berkeley ends by suggesting that objects only^exist when FP c5 54"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"we are looking at them - or at least, they would, if it were not for God, who is everywhere and is always look- ing at everything. It can be seen that, in this final conclusion, Berkeley is as inconsistent as the rest. David Hume, twenty-six years younger tlan Berkeley, made the usual utt.*pt to push these conclusions to the absurd limit of consiitency. He did this by blending together the essence of Descartes, Locke and Berkeley. He began with Descartes' principle of doubting everything, then proceeded to agree with Locke and Berkeley that all knowledge is derived from experience, and that there are no general ideas. Next he denied the 'self' (i.e., the soul), declaring that conscious- ness is just a flow of perceptions, and that men are bundles of perceprions (psychologically speaking). Fin-ally, he wenr further than any previous philosophir and denied that cause and effect have any necessary connection. r + t : Z may be a valid example of cause and effect, but in nature, 'every efiect is a diitinct'event from its cause', and 'It could not, therefore, be discovered in the cause'. After Ffume, philosophy faced a blank wall. Descartes at least had left a basis for certainty: 'I think, therefore I am.' Ilume replied: 'That does not prove that you exist at all.' Berkeley had got rid of the outside world; now ,Fq*. got rid of the mind as well. Reason had proved to be a kind of forest fire that ended by consuming every_ thing. Descartes' principle of doubt left nothin[ stand- r+9. The task of rescuing philosophy from Hume's total scepticism was undertaken by Kdnt. Kanr, like all the rest, accegted Descartes' premise, and, followed roughly the same line of reason as Berkeley and Hume. The main problem, as Kant saw it, was to re-establish plato,s idea that all knowledge 9a1 be found inside man - not just mathematical knowledge. Kant's aim was excellent, but his means were not entirely honest. And his first step seems to be only another concession to Locke and Humi. 56 Nob-ody hdLd ever doubted that r + t : 2 is a .necessary, truth,.ur. opqgred to a statement like .It is snowing be- cause it is cold', which is logical enough, but may n6t be true. Kant declared that 5 + 7 : ,e is no more .neces_ $ary' than the connection of cause and effect, because the idea of rg is not 'contained' in the idea of b + 7. At first sight, 1, *ry_ seem thar Kanr was only giviirg away more ground to Hume. But this was \"$.nliul to -hi, plan, for he goes on ro propose a theory of the mind which is the reverse of.Hume's. For Hume, the mind is almost noth- ing, a machine set going by perceptions. For Kant, the mind is everything. For not onty do?s the mind embellish nature with colours and textures and smells - not to mention cause and effect - but it also adds space and time. Kant l$rees with Descartes that we .u., ,,.i.\", know the external world, but only our impressions of it. rn that case, what is the external world tit<el we can never know. The mind adds practically everything to what we perceive; these additions are divided into twelve cate- gories, which include colour, shape, size, smell and causality. The only way we .r, ,rd.rstand our impres- sions is to sort them out into these categories, ^ and arrange- them tidily in the order of space and- time. The categories are like a pair of coroured spectacles that we can never remove; we can never hope to see tr,e Ding an si_ch, things as they really are. Reaiity remains unknow- able. It has been pointed our thar Kanr failed to follow his arguments to their extremes, like Descartes and Berkeley. For why should we bother to postulate a .reality, orr, there, if the mind can do so mich? worse still, if *t . mind can create the whole world, how do I know that il is not also creating other people, and that r am not the only person in the univerle?-But Kant slips past these objections, and proceeds quickly !o less^ bewildering matters.

In one swedp, Kant had managed to reinstate religion. The meaning of Kant's achievement can be seen if we view it in historical perspective - and also its inevit- ability. Galileo had started the process when he talked about primary and secondary qualities. Shape and size and mass are primary qualities which really belong to nature; secondary qualities, such as colour, texture, smell, may be added by the mind. Berkeley went on to argue that even the primary qualities are added by the mind, because a square seen from an odd angle may appear to be a parallelogram. But still, space and time remained stubbornly 'out there'. Kant simply took space and time into the mind. The 'out there' vanished alto- gether, and everything was simple again - except that Kant's conclusions seemed a dead end. For \\,r'here could philosophy go from there? It seems astounding that no eminent thinker simply challenged the premises of Descartes' philosophy . total doubt - or felt intuitively that reason, applied in this sweeping way to the living world, was only producing destruction. In fact, one friend of Kant's did feel this, but he was unfortunately not an eminent thinker or a man of influence. This was J. G. Harnann, a passionately convinced Christian, who believed that Kant was leading philosophy into a cul-de-sac. Efamann asserted that the world is far too complex to submit to such clumsy reason, and that to try to apply scientific.reason to the human situation is like using a .fishing net as a tea strainer. Kant thought [Iamann a crank and a dogmatist, a.nd made no attempts to understand his objections. Kant can h'arclly be blamed; although flamann published several books about his ideas, he was no thinker; his reaction was in- stinctive, and badly expressed. \\' / The importance of Hamann, in the present context, is the influence he exerted on a young Danish thinker of the nineteenth century, Soren Kierkegaard, who is 58 generally regarded as the founder of existentialism. This distinction should perhaps go to Flamann. But there is yef unotir.i thinker whose work is, in mqny respects, an anticipation of existentialism - a man who usually receives only brief notice in the histories of philosoptry. And yet, it might be contended, he produced some of the most exciting ideas of the nineteenth century. This is Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Kanr,s disciple and thirty-eight years his junior. Fichte accepted completely Kant's view that the mind creates all the laws we know - the laws of nature, the laws of reason and logic. It is, of course, almost impos- sible for philosophy ro go further in this direction. brt Kan_t had proceeded from his examination of pure reason to the study of practical affairs, and concluded that man - possesses free_ will which is more important than any moral laws. only common sense and sbcial necessity bid us to do unto oihers as we would have them do to us. (This is the famous 'categorical imperative'.) It was this a_spect of Kant that struck Fichte as a way out of absolute doubt and despair. rn one of his best books, The voca- tion of Y.on (r8oo), Fichte srates the whole problene with a splendid clarity worthy of Nierzsche. ti is in three books. The first shows Fichte looking at the universe as a philosopher, and being overwhelmed by the problem of 'values in a u,iverse of chance' (to use pierci's phrase). Man thinks he is free, but as soon as he .*r*ilr., the problem, he finds that his t'reedom is an illusion. Fre can do nothing without a 'reason' from outside; he is a mere p_enny in the slot machine, and it is nature that puts in the pennies. In the second book, a spirit appears to him (probably inspired by Goethe,s Fauit, of wiich the first fragment had been published a few years before) and expounds to him Kant',s philosophy - that nature itself is a figment of his brain; the mind creates everything, in- cluding- the 'laws of narure'. This plunges irr. p--rrito- sopher into even deeper despair. whit is to preverrt him from falling into total solipsism - believing tlut he is the 59"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"only person in the universe?* 'You yourself have the answer to that'says the spirit, and disappears. And in the third book, Fichte addresses himself, and recognizes that, indeed, he does hold the answer. The answer - which is of considerable importance for existentialism - is that philosophers make the mistake of supposing that their only task is to know tlrre universe; but just as important as knowing is doing. 'Nor fon idle contemplation of your- self are you here, not for brooding over devout sensations - no, for action you are here; action, and action alone, determines your worth.' At first, this might sound a somewhat disappointing conclusion. It is important to grasp the spirit behind it, Descartes sat in his armchair and wondered what he could know. Philosophy accepted his way of propound- . ing the question, and stayed in its armchair, uitil-Hume managed to doubt the whole world out of existence. Then came Kant, and reversed the procedure. The mind, he said, creates the universe and its laws. True, there is an unknowable reality 'out there' - the nou,ntena, but it is unknowable precisely because it does not need to obey our laws, and so cannot enter our perceptions, or even our reason. Now Fichte plunged into the next stage. Why bother about the noumena? he asked; let us forget about it. What is left is Man in a uniuerse of his own creating. Here a minor problem arises. Can I 'create, the universe, and yet not be aware that I am doing so? Well, Kant said so, and his arguments sound convincing. So there must be two 'me's'. One of them is Descartes' 'I think', which sits in its armchair. And plainly, there is a subconscious 'me' that does the work of creating - be- hind the back, as it were, of the other 'me'. The full implication of Fichte's argument can now be seen. In Book One, the philosopher despaired because it * A view expressed with tremendous dramatic force by - of all people - Mark Twa,in, in his stoty The Mysterious Stranger, rvhich is recommended as a kind of summary of all the philosophical problems of the nineteenth century. 6o seemed that he had no free will, only consciousness. In Book Two, the spirit showed him that what he thought was 'implacable nature' was actually his subconsciouJ.f, busily creating the world and its laws. This is a situation rather like the one in Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday where the detecrive who is spying on the anarchists finally discovers that all the anarchists are de- tectives who think they are spying on anarchists. The enemies are friends after all. A certain problem remains, as Chesterton saw. Who created the confusion? Who is responsible for the pracrical joke ? Fichte is not concerned about this; he is roo delighted by the realization that the enemy.has turned out to be a friend. Man can stop worrying. We are cautious animals who basically distrust the world, and the philosopher is qerhlpl the most cautious of all. That is why Descartes decided to sit in an armchair and think. Now we have thought ourselves beyond mistrust we can go and act in the certainty that it will turn our alt right. Fichte had stumbled upon the most important single insight of the nineteenth century. But he was not awafe of it. He had solved the basic problem of Cartesian philosophy - or rather, pointed out that Kant had solved it. But no one noticed his solution, and it has gone on troubling philosophy down to our own day. In a funda- mental sense, Fichte had seen deeper than his master (who later repudiated Fichte). For Kant only believed that he had resolved the Cartesian dualism by reducing everything to mind. (And in fact, Kant really kept the dualism, for he kept the noltnl,ena.) Fichte perceived that he had done something more momentous: -destroyed the dualism and, replaced it uith a tri-alism. Instead of the contemplating mind ('I think') looking out at alien nature, there is a far more interesting situation. There are two 'I'$'; one is the 'I think', and the other the 'trans- cendental ego', the ego behind the scenes, the cinema projectionist who is projecting 'nature' out there. This metaphor of the cinema describes the situation precisely."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"For if you are sitting in a cinema watching the screen, you assume that what you are watching is happening in front of you. But in a far more fundamental sense, it is happening behind you, in the projection room. If the film breaks, or the projectionist decides to go home, the screen will go blank. Descartes was only aware of the 'I' sitting in the cinema; Fichte pointed out that there is another 'I' in the projection room. The left side of the mind doesn't know what the right side is doing. It cannot be said that Fichte developed this insight in any important way. If his inspiration had held out, he might have gone on to ask: 'flow can the \"I\" sitting in the cinema find out more about the \"I\" in the projection room?' Thii question might have led him to create the science of phenomenology a century before Husserl. As it was, Fichte only went on to anticipate the philosophy of Je'an-Paul Sartre; for he went on to declare that philo- sophy is incomplete unless it le-ads to action, to commit- ment. (H. was also a strong influence on the prag- matists.) Like Sartre, Fichte allowed philosophy to lead him into politics. He roused German youth with his Addresses to the German Nation, an attempt to incite resistance to Napoleon, and never afterwards retreated from his conviction that the most important thing about philosophy is its ethical and political consequences, which should lead to social reform. Because of the Addresses, he is now largely regarded as a kind of proto- Nazi; while his philosophy of the Ego is often inter- preted as a mere anticipation of Nietzsche. On the whole, one cannot be surprised that Fichte failed to grasp the meaning of his own thought. He swal- lowed Kant lock, stock and barrel - if we except rejection of the noLernena - and consequently rlelieved that there is nothing 'out there'. He failed to see that this is a self- contradiction; for even in our metaphor of the cinema, there is at least a screen 'out there'. Simply to posit an :out there' is to posit a third member of the tri-ality. So Fichte came to be rejected as a muddled and self- contradictory thinker by later generations. So he was; but his single insight was more important than whole systems of later philosophers. There was another reason that Fichte lost influence; another, and more exciting star, was rising in the first decade of the nineteenth century: Hegel. Hegel seemed to promise all that previous philosophers had been un- able to achieve. He began, like Fichte, by brooding on the problem of religion and revelation. On this subject, Hegel was a true existentialist, for he decided that 'his- torical truth' can never be as important as subjective truth, the eternal truths of the reason. Whether a min called Christ really existed'is beside the point But while in this early sceptical stage, Hegel had his own sudden flash of insight; it may well have been a mystical vision of some kind. fle saw the 'idea' as the ultimate reality, the absolute, from which all things derive: logic, Nature and Spirit (or mind). All the world as we know it is made up of sub-divisions of these cate- gories. To grasp the essence of Hegel's achievement - and to ignore its illogicalities, self-contradicti,ons and moments of downright absurdity - we have to recall for a moment the basic attitude of Greek philosophy: the rejection of the real world in favour of the world of reason and ideas. (Plotinus, for example, refused to allow any pictures of himself to be made, or to give any biographical facts, for- he claimed that the 'real' side of himself was not only supremely unimportant, but a contradiction of his true self, the spirit striving after the absolute idea.) World re- jection has entered deep into philosophy; it can be seen even in Descartes' tendency to stay in bed all duy. Eastern and Western philosophy show the same basic pattern: the man of thought and the man of action are fundamentally opposed - except for the occasional en- lightened king. Hegel's temperament rejected this dualism. Something healthy and optimistic in him wanted to be allowed to 63 6z"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"accept the real world - but in a profounder sense than its usual kind of acceptance by practical men. (It is typical that Hegel was delighted when Napoleon won the battle of Jena - even though it meant that Hegel was out of a job; there was something cheerful in him that could not help approving of vitality.) Therefore it was necessary, as it were, to be a super-practical man, far above both the shallow world-accepters and the pessimistic world-re- jectors. And this 'synthesis' on a higher level is the fundamental movement of all Hegel's thought. Hegel did not spend his life arguing in terms of thesis-antithesis- synthesisj this is one of the myths promulgated by people who have never actually read Hegel; it was a purely in- stinctive movement of his thought.* If he was to justify this world-acceptance, it would re- quire arguments and reasonings that would make all previous philosophizing seem dilettantism. To some ex- tent, he succeeded. But it must also be admitted that this desire of his - a certain element of the actor in him - also led directly to his worst feature: his incomprehensible style. It is impossible to doubt that his obscurity was a part of his technique for being. impressive.f Whether this is regarded as a particularly serious charge against Hegel depends on the view one takes of the writer's responsi- * According to G. E. Mueller and Walter Kaufmann, it is men- tioned only once in the twenty volumes of Hegel's works. f Brand Blanchard has a delightful passage which sums up the case against Hegel's style: 'To say that Major Andr6 was hanged is clear and definite; to say that he was killed is less definite, be- cause you do not know in what way he was killed; to say that he died is still more indefinite, because you do not even know whether his death was due to violence or to natural causes. If we were to use this statement as a varying symbol by which to rank writers for clearness, we might, I think, g€t something like the following: Swift, . Macaulay and Shaw would say that Andr6 was hanged. Bradley would say that he was killed. Bosanquet would say that he died. Kant would say that his mortal existeni:e achieved its termination. Hegel would say that a finite determination of infinity had been further determined by its own negation'. (On Philosophical Style, P. 3o.) 64 bility to be as clear as possible. What seems to be gener- ally acknowledged - Karl Popper i's one of the few vio- lently dissenting voices* - is that in spite of his atrocious style, Hegel has a great deal more to say than most other philosophers of the nineteenth century. In view of this refusal to be a 'world-rejector', it is not surprising that he eventually became the official philo- sopher of the Prussian state. For Hegel's philosophy is essentially an immense attempt to 'justify the ways of God to man'. It has one important distinction: it is the first clear attempt in the history of pl itosophy since Plato, to refute the idea that the world is evil or mean- ingless, and that the philosopher is better off dead. Hegel's philosophy of history has been the most frequent target for the jeers of anti-Hegelians - for he attempted to show that all history is moving steadily towards the ultimate self-expression of spirit - but for all its absurdi- ties and over-simplifications, it is a philosophy that be- lieves in evolution, and refuses to accept that history is a 'nightmare'. One might criticize Hegel by saying that his philo- sophy is not true philosophy at all: that although he be- gins by talking about perception, consciousness, logic, he has actually broken with the Cartesian tradition of closely connected reason, and is really writing a kind of monstrous novel or epic poem about 'SpiriJ. There is some truth in this, but it could be argued about end- lessly. Could a completely 'logical' philosophy - without vision or intuition - ever arrive at 'truth'? At all events, Hegel stands next to Goethe as one of the greatest creative minds of the nineteenth century. Hegel's greatest achievement was his recognition purely intuitive - that the old dualism musr be somehow transcended. If he h'ad been a f.ar greater man, his in- fluence might have been more decisive; he might have written in clearer language, and have shown far more x'l'he Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol s, a brilliant but unfair attack. 65"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"definitely that there was a fallacy in Descartes' dualism. As it was, he became the father-figure of a British school of idealism, and over the next fifty years gradually ceased to exercise any active influence on philosophy. But, strangely enough, it was the philosophies of vio- lent reaction provoked by Hegel's thinking that came to exercise rnost influence on post-Hegelian thought, and that still dominate philosophy in the twentieth century. The first of these was the positivism of Auguste Comte; the second, Kierkegaard's existentialism. Comte was one of the first of the great worshippers of science of the nineteenth century. History, he says, pro- ceeds in three stages: superstition, metaphysics and science. The first stage is one of total ignorance; when men are dominated by fear. In the second stage, men know enough to reject the idea of a universe populated by gods and demons, but are still inclined to connect up their facts with vague theories about the 'absolute', 'essences', and so on. Finally, with the coming of science, history enters its final stage; the sun of knowledge rises, and the millennium is in sight. All knowledge can now be verified by observation and logic. To men of the twentieth century, this view sounds harmlessly optimistic, but naive. In its own time, it exer- cised a considerable influence, p'articularly on the British school of philosophers led by Mill and Herbert Spencer. The other major philosopher to oppose Hegel rnust be considered at greater length. Although Kierkegaard re- mained unknown outside Denrhark during his lifetime, and was forgotten for more than half a century after his death, his influence on twentieth century thought has been enormous, and has extended to thinkers with as - little in common as Jaspers, Heidegger, Marcel and Sartre. With Kierkegaard, as with Hegel, one must under- stand his temperament if one is to go to the heart of his thought. Hegel was fundamentally a kind of Shavian optimist; he experienced despair in his youth, but went 66 beyond it. Kierkegaard never went beyond despair; he never tru$ted life. He was the son of old parent$ and was always physically weak; he was also crippled in one leg. His father was an imaginative neurotic who encouraged the child's intelligence and stunted his development as a norm'al boy. Kierkegaard inherited his father's emotional immaturity and instability, and when he became en- gaged to an attractive girl, found it necessary to destroy the relationship as, a spoilt child smashes a toy. He went to Berlin, and heard Schelling - a friend and admirer of Hegel - lecture; as a consequence 6f which he developed an intense dislike of Hegelianism based upon incomplete understanding. There was, of course, a fundamental difference of temperament between Hegel and Kierkegaard. Hegel re- minds us in many ways of Wordsworth. (Their portraits even rnake them look rather alike.) He had Wordsworth's fundamental vision of universal harmony; but apart from this, his character was pedestrian, and his -life orderly, stable and dull. His marriage to a girl many years his junior was uniformly happy. Like Wordsworth he became a pontifical reactionary, somewhat conceited; but none of this detracts from the value of his vision. And he had little patience with the excesses of ttre Sturm und Dramg movement. Kierkegaard, on the other hand, was volatile, witty, thin-skinned and unstable. The neurotic oversensitivity bequeathed him by his father gave him endless rouble. Add to this that Kierkegaard's acquaintance with Hegel's.*ork was all at second-hand, ahd that he was totally unaware that the young Hegel had been some- thing of a religious visionary, antd it can be seen that Kierkegaard's 'ffegel' was a stuffed dummy that he set up for target practice. Kierkegaard's neurosis did not prevent him from producing work of genius; and if he had been a poet it would hardly have been worth mentioning, except for its biographical interest. Bur philosophy aims ar objectivity, 67"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"and it must be recognized that, in spite of his genius, Kierkegaard was nor ideally equipped for being ob- jective. His complaint - understandable enough - was that, as far as he was concerned, flegel's system was not a key to the universe. The reaction was primarily emotional, o, even physical - like a man with a hangover shuddering at th_e thgught of breakfast. In another respect it r,yas noi at all unlike the reaction that w. B. yeais felt towards Bernard shaw. Kierkegaard mistook Hegel for something he was not, a heartless rationalist, a kind of gigantic cal-- culating machine ofiering a 'solution' to th1 universe. His response was the standard response of the anarchist to authority - to shake his fist and shout defiance. This is not to say that his rejection of Hegel was en- tirely a. matter of temperament and immut.r.1ty. There was a certain valid perception that philosophy since Descartes had become too detached and abstricr - pre_ cisely ffam'ann's objection to Kant. Kierkegaard wis a man of religious temperament, and he felt that the pur- pose of seeking truth is to 'exist in it', not to think u6out it. 'To exist under the guidance of pure thought is rike travelling in Denmark ivith the help of a smil map of Eu1op9 on which Denmark shows nb larger than a pen- point.' (Unscientific Postscript.) This is only to say thit he was intens_ely aware of the hidden component in man, the concealed self that is not the detached 'r think', but a struggling and- purposive force. But instead of trying to correct the fallacy that had crepr into philosophy witr, Descartes, he chose to reject all philosophy in ihe name of religion - a paradoxical and pessimisiic religion of his own. According to Kierkegaard, to be a christlan means to recognize that the closer you keep to God, the worse it will be for_you. 'For in a strict sense, being a christian means to die to the worl4 and then to be sacrificed.' (Iournals, r8br.) This recalls Kafka's remark: .In the strugg-le !9twee1 the world and yourself, alwayS rake the wodd's side.' Kierkegaard's chief desire, it seerns, was to 68 be the Anti-Hegel. rnstead of being reasonabre, and taking what ,was good in Hegel -. uia previous philo- sophers - and then modifying it to suit frimself, Kierke- gaard rejected it wholesale in a thoroughly emotional way, cutting off- his nose to spite his facl. Hegel was a professor; so Kierkegaard denounced professors and exalted suffering poets; Heger thought tfrat history w.as part of the divine plln: Kierkegaard rejected history as an irrelevancy; Hegel believed that thbught could be constructive; Kierkegaard set out to shor,v- that, in the paradoxical light of eternity, destruction is constructive.

Bur fbr the sike of completeness, it may be as well io speak of some minor developments. Perhaps it is hardly accurate to speak of the philo- sophy of Nietzsche as a minor development - parricularly since he is often regarded, together wittr Kieikegaard as the founder of existentialism. But Nietzsche's work was essentially incomplete; he went insane before he could bring it to fruition. If Nietzsche had stayed sane, he migfrt well have efiected the great Hegelian synthesis in p_hilosophy, rising above the simple pessimism of the Greeks and the simple oprimism bf Hegel. For he rvas Hegel's successor in one important respect: he did not put the world of thought and the world of history into two separate compartment$. Although he began as a pessimistic romantic and disciple of Schopenhauer (who believed that the basic choice was: Huppy animal or sufiering god?), his natural mental vigoui-soon rejected Schopenhauer's crypto-Buddhism. He was less of a weak- ling than most romantics, and his nature was resilient: ,I have made ny philosophy out of my will to livc ... Self- preservation forbade me ro practise a philosophy of wretchedness and discouragement.' Like m-ost romantics, he was inclined to go too far in his opposition to the things he disliked, and his glorification bf the military man or the 'blond beast' sometimes sounds a note of sheer absurdity. (h practice, Nietzsche lost no oppor- gunity to sneer ar the Prussian rendency to militaiiim.) But on the whole, his philosophy is remarkably balanced, remarkably free of imprecision and overstatement. Dar- win's theory of evolution provided him with the basic concep_t_he needed for his neru romanticism: the super- man. 'Not mankind but Superman, is the goal., Ai an analyst of the weaknesses and pockets of decay in con- lempgrary_ thought, he was unrivalled. He speaks of the 'smell of defeat' in contemporary thought, and declared with sheer inspiration that 'the nineteenth century goes 7o in search of theories by which it may justify its fatalistic submission to the empire of facts.' He captured the ob- jection to Descartes in a single phrase when he jeered at 'the idea of will-less contemplhtion as the road to truth' (WiU to Power, gb). Like Hegel, Nietzsche had ex- perienced a vision in his teens, on the top of a hill called Leutch,* as a consequence of which he wrote: 'Pure will, without the confusions of intellect - how happy, how free ! ' This vision, of total life-afirmation, transcending the mere animal will to live and the doubts of the in- tellectuals, was always the mainspring of his thought, and is far more important than the casual aspects of it that are sometimes selected for criticism: his glorification of the Ego, his occasional anti-rationalism, his contempt for 'the herd'. Under slightly different circumstancts Nietzsche might easily f,uu\" become the officially approved philosopher of Germany at the turn of the century. But there were obstacles. Like Kierkegaard, he had inherited feeble health from his farher, and this was made worse when he contracted syphilis in a brothel. His feeble health was an obstacle to sustained intel- lectual efiort, so that his books are written in brief dis- connected fragments; unlike Hegel, he was incapable of o_ut-Kanting Kant. (And perhaps the fact that Hegel had already done it, discouraged him.) Finally, his fluctuat- ing health emphasized the inner-inconsistency of his philosophy, so that the exalration of free will is im- mediately countered by amor fati, and the idea of the superman is contradicted by the notion. of Eternal Re- currence. Nietzsche had chosen a task - or rather, his temperament had. chosen it for him - that was too great for a sick, poverty-stricken man who had no rtuble domestic background. And yer even so, his life gives us a feeling of a near miss. His sanity collapsed at just about 1!: pgi\"t when he was becoming a Elropean celebrity.

Apart from Nietzsche, European philosophy continued in the rut selected for it by Desiartes. The work of Comte was continued by Ernsr Mach (1836-1916), a scientist-philosopher who became alarmed at the way tha-t metaphysical ideas were .infiltrating into physici, and who attempted ro remedy this by creiting a materialistic philosophy of science. 'Concepts have mean- ing_o-nly if we can point to objecrs to which they refer., In Mach's time, there were bewildering developments in science in physics, mathematics, psychology and 'scientists were becoming increasingly prone to use con- cepts that seemed to belong to philosophy.

It is an attempt to remove the contradictions of the nineteenth century- philosophy by applying Mach,s prin- ciple: sticking to the observable, orlo ifraiwhich .u, be verified by logic. The founder of the 'Vienna school, of logical positivists, Moritz schlick, believed that philo- pphy should be confined to an artempr ro clarify ireun- ings by the use of logic; anything that-cannot be ieduced to logic can be dismissed as meaningless. This view dearly stems frorn the same impulse thit induced Marx to explain history in terms of economic conflict, or that 72 led Freud to reduce religion to rhe need for a father figure. It is an emodonal gesture of despair in the face of complexity. A more recent form of positivism afrrms that the business of philosophy iS the logical analysis of language; it works- upon the assumption that thinkers like Kant and Hegel managed to deceive themselves by their unconscious misuse of language. For this schooi, philosophy is a science, and has no business to concern itself with human life. The cartesian dualism vanishes betause mind is reduced to that which is observable. Logical positivism is related - emotionally at least - to another doctrine that attempts to resolve the cartesian dualism by violenr methods: pragmatism. pragmatism was foreshadowed by Fichte, wilh [is impatientteclara- tion that if the nou,rnena is unknowable, ihen we had all bett_er fgrget abour it. C. S. Pierce and William Jarnes apply the same kind of test to the confusions of ptrilo- sophy. What are the respective merits of Kant's nournena and Hegel's absolute idea? Can it possibly make any djfference to practical conduct? No? Then they mean the same_lhilg: James himself was by no means a scepric - as his Varieties of Religious Experience makes cleir - but his way of resolving the problems of belief has an air of convenient over-simplification. There is no final way of knowing whether a religious or moral belief is true or not. So James follows Fichte in saying: Truth is relative to the individual. If belief in God works for you, then it is true_- for you. Belief is better than scepticism because the believet rnay be right, whereas the s-eptig suspend- itg frir judgement, is neirher right nor wiong. Jaines,s idea of belief obviously h'as a certain humoro-us casual- ness about it, like filling in a football coupon with the help of a pin and a btindfold. It can be setn that both pragmatism and logical positivism are forms of relativ- ism. Truth is not 'absolute'; in one case, it is relative to human psychology (and conducr), in the other, ro rhe laws of science and language. All this will have made it clear rhat my simile of the 78"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"\",\"!_rdy room is hardly adequate to describe the stare of philosophy in the twentieth century. If the concern of philosophy is to understand the universe and man's place in it, then it seems that there has been no advance -sirr.e Descartes. There is not a single statement by any philo- sopher since then that cannot be immediateiy' con- tradicted by another statement from another philoiopher - or sometimes from the same one. It rnight seem thit it would require the synthesizing power o1 a Newton ro create a unity out of this chaos. And yet again, the prob- lem can be approached with common sense, and ceitain basic 'truths' begin to emerge. To begin with, it is clear that Descartes was re- sp-onsible for much of the confusion by introducing a fallacy at the very beginning. The faliacy was nor a logical one; rarher it *ui psychologicar. Descartes assumed that the philosopher is a thinking machine who can solve the problem by pure thought. rrE reminds us of Pg:-r D.ugin, who solved the myrt..y of Marie Roget while sitting in an armchair with it e blinds drain. Fichte stumbled on a glimpse of the rruth. Descartes was wrong to assume that all the problems are 'out there,, and that the machine can be riusted completely. Admit- tedln Fichte expressed his question in a somewhat ex- treme form, which prevented his immediate successors from pcrceiving its fundamental good sense. 'can I create the universe and yet not be aware that I am doing so.?' Probably not; but I can do a great m,any thingi without being aware that I'm doing th1m. when r think something- or perceive something, it is not a simple mechanical process; thousands of interior valves flicier into life; my whole being takes part in the proceiss. For example, someone may whistle J few bars of music and say: 'What is that?', and I reply immed.iately, ,The opening of Beethoven's fifth symphony., He asks: .How did you know?', and after a moment of baffied silence, r shrug and say: 'But it was obvious., It seems an ex- tremely simple process; bur ro explain it fully would re- 74 ]i,r gu'r . a combination of scientist, psychologist and ': musician, and e-xpranations about rogarithms of fre- quency ratios and their efiect on the .o.f,I.u, as well as of the selective action of memory. we are like a man who thinks that cars are simpl. *eihunisms because he knows how to drive one, even ihough he has never toot<ed under the bonnet. Descartes was irmost certainly right in be- lieving thar narure wil finaly be entirery J\"pi?tabre in terms of logic and sciencei but he was miitaken in assum- ing that the laws of the mind are the laws of rogic and science. From this simple cartesian farlacy sprang a[ the sub- sequent confusion. Descarres declaied thai the k.y to p.nitglopny is simplicity; so Locke and Hume aimed for simplicity, even if it meant assuming that -u, is a machine and can therefore have no possible use for truth. comte and Mach certainry achieved simplicity; so did Kanr and Hegel, in a different way; so have the iog- ical- positivists.

The starting point is still the 'I think', the ques' tioning intelligence. But instead of looking out at the universe from its armchair, it now needs two faces, one to look out, one to look inward towards the 'hidden I', the transcendental ego. But at the same time, it should be recognized that this is not a true 'tri-ality', any more than that a person who sleep-walks is truly two people. Although the 'I think' seems self-evident, it is actu'ally an abstraction, a single aspect of the transcendental ego. (I am borrowing Kant's phrase for the 'hidden I' at this point, because it will have to be brought in again later in discussions of Husserl.) CHAPTER 3 The New Foundations WHITEH EAD PROPOSES A SOLUTION Ar rHIS poINT, the problem becomes somewhat more difficult to present. So far, I have been able to present it historically, showing the unfolding of science, philosophy and romanticism. If twentieth-century philosophy could be represented as a steady advance, this would be the ideal way to continue. Unfortunately, it cannot. Two of the rriost important thinkers of the century have been curiously uninfluential - Whitehead and Husserl. Both of them took important steps towards solving the prob- lems posed in the last chapter. Whitehead has had no followers; Husserl has had many - the most important being Heidegger, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. But in both cases, the essence of their solutions has been ignored. Whitehead's contribution is simple, but of incalcul- able importance. It is stated in one of his least known books, Symbolism, Its Meaning and Effecl, and takes the form of a criticism of Hume. Whitehead simply points out that when we talk about the problem of perception, we are forgetting that there are two distinct ways ot' per- ceiaing the outside world,. These Whitehead calls, some- what ponderously, 'presentational immediacy' and 'causal efficacy'. If I am getting bored in a dentist's waiting-room I am aware only of objects. I may stare at my finger-nails, be- come aware that my left foot itches, find myself listening to every sound from the street. Now suppose that I see an article in a magazine that interests me. I cease to be aware of sounds and sensations; if I am interested enough, I may even forget an aching tooth. My attention is still focu$ing on minute particulars - the rvords on the ,t, # #' flrl' il' '( lt s *,1f' rfi rf, $,, 'Vi, . 1,, tl 76 77"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"page - but something else has come into play. When I was bored, my attention was only aware of miriute par- ticulars; apart from that, my mind was a blank. Now another kind of perception has started in my brain: a perception of the meaning of the article. This is like a great brackdt that.holds together all the individual per- ceptions of words. Now observe what happens if I turn from this article to an article which I find very difficult to understand. My mind tries to grasp the meaning of the sentences, and qlips, as if I have tried to get a foothold on ice. It can no longer grasp the meaning of a whole page or paragraph; it finds it'difficult enough to make sense out of -in- dividual sentences. Finally, if the article continues to baffie me, I become aware only of individual words on the.page, and have to read a short passage two or three times to give the words any connection. The meaning- perception has gone; I am back to my perception of 'immediacy'. Hume would say: 'There is nothing strange in this. You know the meaning of the individuat words; you simply add these meanings together to ger the meaning of the sentences and paragraphs.' You might object: 'Bui that is not true; I am very bad at adding up figures, and PI pelggption of the meaning of the article is nothing like adding up sums.' Efume would reply: 'No, it is ohly that it takes place so quickly and naturally that you are not aware of it as a process of adding up. A trained office girl can feed figures into a calculating machine at such a speed that you might suppose the machine was inspired and leapt to the answer in a flash; but it is not true; for eJery figure, a key had to be pressed. The meaning (i.e., the answer to the sum) was the result of several tiny steps.-And all meanings can be analysed down into steps., This might seem convincing until one reflects on the sense of beauty. I look at a scene and say: 'f,trat is beautiful.' This is the hnswer' to the sum of one's per- ceptions of the scene. But how can I analyse this sense of \"78 beauty into its constituent parts? I can analyse the scene, but the analysis will not inr:lude the 'beauty'. The scientific approach would be to examine it with a mag- nifying glass; bur this is like trying to locate rhe beauty of a lake by swimming in it or drinking it. yeats ex- presses this idea in the poem Towards Break of Day, speaking of a waterfall 'rhat all my childhood counted dear': I would, haae touched, it like a child, B,ut h.new my finger could, but haae touched Cold stone and water. I grew wild, Eaen accusing Heauen bicause It had, set down a,rnong its laws: Nothing that we loue ouermuch Is ponderable to our touch! The sense of meaning is what whitehead calrs 'causal efficacy'. Whitehead admits that Hume is right about cause and efiect - if the only mode of perception is immedi-acy. Hume's meaning could be mahe cliarer by an analogy with space. One is in a dark room, and is asked to examine the room carefully by the sense of. touch, and afterwards make a drawing of tire inside of the room. This seems easy enough; but the.room is large, and the darknes,s total. one discovers that there is i tabre in the middle of the room - ar least, you think it is prob- ably the middle of the room by pacing from the ta6le to the walls. There are also rer.rul- chaiis and other pieces of furniture disposed around the room. some of the^m are so close to the table that you can place one hand on the table and the other on the chair, ind judge the distance between them and their relative posiiion. But where a chair is too far from other objects to use this method, it is . more difficulu one has to rely on less immediate methods. ' Now l{ume *oyld objeci that unless you can place one hand on the table and the other on a chair, yorr-hur. no right to make a positive assertion about theii relative position- You might be deceived in the darkness; when 79"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"you thin\\ yo, are walking in a srraighr line, you might have made a bl.ight turn, and so on. Whitehead would agree, but would say: 'There is a simple answer: turn on the light.' Hurne would deny that this is possible. There is no light, only the ,\"rr. oi touch, and the sense of sight is really the sense of touch Ig.d by logical inference. We might reply indignantly: 'Nonsense, sight is something quite - different from touch ! ' 'No,' Ffume would reply, 'they are the same thing; sight is only rhe sense of touch ai a distance. In- stead of your hand encountering a book, a ray of light bounces off the book and then bounces off your eyebill, and you infer the presence of the book.' ' This simile of the room also helps to explain why it is that science is a product of the western mind, and that the East has produced so little science. If a blind man and a man with sight were led into the same room, and both told that, after ten minutes, they would be led out- side and asked to describe it in detaii, which of the two would be able to offer the minutest description? crearly, the blind man, for it would cost him far more effort to get to know the room. FIe would be forced to take a tape measure and first of all measure the exact size of tLe room, then to note the position of all objects along the walls (bookshelves, tables, etc), then to pu.-\" o,rt distinces across the floor and me'asure the distanie of other objects from the walls. Because of the sheer effort of alt ttrii he would have a closer acquaintance with the room than the man who possesses sight, for the latter would prob- ably wander around casually, taking a vague mentil in- ventory of the objects he saw, confident that he would rernember them later because their impact is so im- mediate. And, like a man who says he *ill remember a telephone number, he would probably forget half of what he has seen. Western man is in the posirion of the blind man; his meaningperception is so limited that he is forced to rely on his intellecr and upon symbolism to give him a grasp 8o o{ ye.anings.

In its early stages, science is not concerned with meaning-per- ception, but with 'facts'. In science, nature is presumed guilty until she hai proved herself innocent. Science is based on the principle of verification, on examining nature through a microscope. In Symbolisrza, Whitehead points out that 'immediacy-perception' is definite, clear cut, while meaning-perception is vague, imprecise. Man is in the position of a painter painting a gigantic canvas. If he is close enough to be able to work, he is too close to see it as a whole. If he stands back to see it as a whole, he is ' too fai away to use his paint-brush. The natural solution for the painter would be to move back and forth as often as possible. But the scientist would feel that such conduct was unscientific. He keeps his nose to the canvas, and creates 'theories' to unify his facts. Science begins with' facts, proceeds to theory, then returns to the facts to verify or disprove the theory. The scientist has no use for meaning-perception - at least in theory. In fact, any good - scientist or mathematician will admit that imagination is as indispensable to the scientist as to the poet; still, one will find no mention of this in books on scientific method. The scientific method - the method of doubt and veri- fication - is indispensable to science. But it was never meant to be applied to philosophy. Philosophy is con- cerned with the question of the univerce and, human life. One can learn a certain amount about the universe by examining it through a microscope, just as one can learn a certain amount about Leonardo's paintings by study- ing the texture of the paint. But an art critic who was concerned only with paint texture would rniss the whole r point. To change the simile slightly, the philosopher co.uld be compared to the music critic, whose task is to r'nterpret difficult works to a musically unsophisticated public. From the'critic's point of view, a symphony has , two aspects: the emotions the composer wanted to con- vey, and the techniques he uses to convey them. If the 8e critic confined his explanatiorls to the technique - 'Irere the main theme is repeated a semitone highe;' - he will fail in his task of interpreting the music. ena if he began a book about the quartets of Beethoven by saying: .i,V. must start by doubting everything', the book would soon become as confused and gaseous as . nineteenth century philosophy. It will be seen, then, that Whitehead,s ,answer to Erume' is also an answer to Descartes. For Descartes' philosopher, sitting in his armchair, there is only one type of perceprion - looking at what is at the end of his nose. All knowledge has to be inferred, from this im- mediacy-perception. But if immediacy-perception is the percep-tion of the 'r think', then what aqpect of conscious- ness deals with meaning-perception? It is something broader, more intuitive, than the 'I think,. It stretchei away into the penumbra of consciousness. Descartes was intoxicated with the scientific method, this ability of the human mind to concentrate a searchlight beam of con- sciousness on particular problems, and solve them by logic. fre assumed that this method wourd eventually be able to take in everything in the universe; that all our feelings, emotions, beliefs, could ultimately be translated into this beautifully clear language of immediacy and 1ogr.. What he forgot was thai a Jearchlight beam pays for its intensity with a certain narrowness, so that it-can only focus on one thing at a time. And flume, in a way, reduced the whole thing to absurdity by asking how we could be sure there is any necessary link beiween the different objects the beam picks out. Hume's criticism - his attack on causaliry - shbuld have made philosophers realize that there is something wrong witl Descirtes, dream - and conseq_ue1{y wittrthe waJ, they were doing philosophy. Instead, Flume's absurdity was solemnl! accepted, and philosophers brooded on rhe problem oi how to incorporate it in the structure.

But it should be noted here that Whitehead's criticism of Hume is a part of his general attack on what he calls 'the bifurca- iion of nature', the scientist's tendency to treat the world as if it could be comprehended in terms of logic or mathematics. When Galileo divided nature into primary and secondary qualities, the primary qualities being 'really there', and the second'ary qualities (colour, smell, etc) added by the senses, he assumed that nature is 'really' a 'dull affair . .. merely the hurrying of material, endlessly, meaninglessly'. So there was no need for a second mode of perception, meaning-PercePtion, because the meaning was added by the human mind. There was no meaning to perceive,* for meaning is inferred not perceived. (Sir Charles Snow's more recent plea for a closer liaison between 'the two cultures' is a re-statement- of Whitehead's complaint about the bifurcation of nature.) Whitehead has also added another valuable term to the discussion. Instead of talking about PercePtion, he prefers to speak of 'prehension'. When the mind per- ceives, it does not merely see something; it actively grasps and digests; the process is active, like the.stomach digest- ing food, not passive, like receiving a slap in the face. A man staring out of a train window and about to fall asleep may be perceiving passively; but the moment the consciousness wakes up and takes stock of its surround- ings, it begins an act of appropriation, of grasping. The importance of this concept will also be seen after we have spoken of Husserl. * It wilL now be seen why I have preferred to speak of 'meaning- perception' rather than using Whitehead's phrase 'causal efficacy'. Wtritehead was aiming at lfume, and stating that we do possess a faculty that perteives cause and effect. But Galileo was the real culprit. [. RIGINS OF PHEN OMENOLOGY_BRENTANO Flusserl's master was'a theologian-turned-psychologist called Eranz Brentano. Brentano (r8g8-rgr7) was con- cerned with the chaos of nineteenth century philosophy, and wondered how it might be untangled. It seemed to him that this might be done by starting from human psychology. The same reflection led thinkers like MilI and James into 'psychologism'. Psychologism is a tend- ency to declare that meraphysical absolutes (or logical absolutes) can be translated into terms of psychology. (In the same way a biologist might declare that philosophy and logic have no independent existence, b.ut can be re- duced to terms of the body and its workings; such a philosophy would be a 'biologism'.) But Brentano found himself unable to take this conveniently simplifying step, for he was unable to agree with the psychologists about fundamentals. Since Galileo and Locke had left philo- sophy in such confusion about what the mind'adds' and what it merely sees, psychology had involved itself in contradictions about such questions as sensation and imagination. According to Berkeley, there is no real difference between riding a horse and thinking about riding a horse; but even without taking this extreme attitude, we can see that physical and mental pheno- mena are mixed up in a rnost complex manner. For example, I may be blindfolded and told that I am about to be burnt with a red hot iron; if someone then touches me with a piece of ice cold metal, I may cry out, con- vinced that it is red hot. In this case, a physical pheno- f,nenon is 'adulterated' with a mental one. Again, in the , case of a musical chord, it could be argued that the chord ;is not a physical phenomenon, since it is a mere vibra- tion of afu until I hear af; here again it is a question of fi where the mental begins and the physical ends. ;, Brentano proposed what seemed to him a satisfactory way of distinguishing mental from physical phenomena. i;A mental phenomenon, he said, is directed at an object; 84 85"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"mental phenomena 'include an object intentionally within themselves'.- The important word here is in- tentionally. Consciousness focuses like a searchlight beam, or, to use a simile closer to Brentano's mode of expression, it encloses its 'object' in the way that a fruit encloses its stone. (For this reason, Brentano spoke of in- tentional inexistence' meaning intentional existence in consciousness.) Brentano's influence on Husserl was enormous. But more important than any specific idea or theory was Brentano's attitude to life and philosophy. He started as a theologian; his ultimate aim was to write about the problems of God and human destiny; and, yet he spent his whol.e life preparing to r,vrite about rhem, laying the foundations. Ilusserl u'as later to remark: 'No man is tbo good for foundation work.' (Many of Brentano's philosophical papers are still unpublished, so it is im- possible to know how far he got beyond the foundations.) The aspect of Brentano that became the st'arting point for flusserl was his assertion that 'the true method of philosophy is none other than that of the natural sciences'. At first sight, this may seem to be identical with Descartes' premise. But although Descartes was a scien- tist, his method was not scientific; he sat in an armchair and proceeded to theorize. The true scientist like Galileo - begins by dropping weights off a tower or roll- ing them down an inclined plane; that is to say, he be- gins by collecting his data. With his discovery of the in- tentionality of consciousness, Brentano had stumbled on a starting point that was far more fundamental than Descartes' idea of doubting everything. Science is the attempt to be completely objective about 'the facts'; bur if the scientist's instruments are inaccurate, objectivity is impossible; he musr begin by examining his initrumenrs. The philosopher's basic instrument is nor logic; it is ob- servation - that is to say, coniciousness. so ihe sfarting point of philosophy, according to Brentano, should b; the checking of the instrument of consciousness. 86 : I.NTENTIONALITY Before describing ffusserl's application of .Brentano,s idea of a 'scientific philosophy', I should perhaps attempr to make clear what is meant by 'intentionality'. The basic activity of consciousness is prehension - ro use Whitehead's word. This is what Brentano meanr when he spoke of mental states as 'including something 1s u1 object' within themselves. Consciousness may be described by two analogies. rt is a beam of attention, likb .the 'eyebeams' that Donne mentions in one of his poems. Or it could be described as a hand, grasping bb;..t, within its continuum. If I look at a tibr.-top covlred with assorted objects, and then look away, I- shall re- member cerrain of the objects and forget bthers. But r can also remember something of the relation of the ob- jects to one another and to ihe table-top; my attenrion somehow grasped the situation as,a whole, even though it cannot remember all the individual parts. Wly did my attention select ceitain objects ro re- member rather than others? The reasons ire not im- po_rtant; what is important is that my consciousness selected its objects. This act of selection is a form of in- tention'ality. I reproduce below three figures that selective activiry. 1i \"ii, 'tr1 *r,: I 'r. ,.l,,} ili;' t!. l' lr ,J., \",t:, ,ir i/ i,{i ,l{ I f; Al il, Ulr irt' ittr # {lj'.

Figure 2 may be seen either as'a Maltese cross (shaded) or a white four- leaved clover, Figure 3 (known as the Miiller-Lyer illu- sion) shows two lines of equal length; the 'forked twig' A appears longer than the double-headed arrow B because the eye continues the movement of A along the forks. In the first two examples, it will be observed that the atten- tion can be trained to see first one aspect of the figure, then the other; but no matter how quickly the mind can make the leap from faces to vase, from Maltese cross to four-leaved clover, it can neuer see both aspects at the same time. The attention has to grasp the picture in a particular way, as the hand might grasp an object to pick it up; but the hand cannot simultaneously hold the object in two different ways. In the Miiller*Lyer illusion, the mind can, with considerable effort, see the two lines A and B as being the same length, but to do so has to make a mental act of excluding the arrow heads or forks; if the attention slips and 'sees' the arrowheads, the lines immediately change length. In looking at these figures, we can catch the attention in its act of selectivity. Other examples of this working of intentionality are the facbs we see in the fire or on the moon. A face seen in the fire can be endowed with as much personality as a good photograph by staring at it and allowing 'in- tentionality' to work. Yet if one looks away for a mo- ment, the face may disaPPear completely.

His earliest reading in philosophy was the British empiricists, from Locke to Hume. Their question: How far does the mind influence what we perceive? became the basis of his phenomenology. (Until the end of his life, Husserl re- commended the British empiricists as the best intro- duction to phenomenology.) Husserl, then, had returned to the sources of European philosophy before the stream becan're hopelessly muddied by Kant and Hegel. Hethen moved into the problems of mathematics and logic, and in his early work Philosophy of Arithmetic, tried to derive the foundations of mathematics from psycho- logical acts - that is to say, he began his career as an exponent of 'psychologism'. This soon began to dissatisfy him, and he turned to philosophy to resolve some of his problems - only to experience complete disillusionment when he discovered that philosophy has even less cer- tainty than mathematics. With considerable optimism, Husserl set out to reconstruct philosophy from the foundations, starting out with only one basic idea; that every statement should be carefully analysed for any kind of preconceptions or prejudices. Nietzsche once re- marked contemptuously that philosophy is only the autobiography of individual philosophers. Husserl recog- nized the truth of this, but felt that it should not be true. Philosophy should begin by merely trying to describe things without prejudice. And since everything depends on man's subjective states, then it should be, to begin with, a descriptiae analysis of subjectiae states. The question in which Husserl was basically interested was: Why does the consciousness select in a certain manner? True to his scientific approach, flusserl did not propound the question in these terms. According to the scientific method, 'Why?' often demands an,unnecessary amount of theorizing, but 'How?' can be observed by anyone who goes to enough trouble. What Husserl did in his major work, Id,eas (rgre) *\"r' to suggest a certain method for observing the workings of intentionality. The basis of this method was the technique that he called 'bracketing'. (However, later phenomenologists, includ- ing Husserl himself, have tended to drop this bracketing ritual.) Bracketing consists in disconnecting the atten- tion from the object under examination, attempting to outwit the 'natural standpoint' by treating it as com- pletely alien. An example might make this clearer. I am writing a letter to a man who might employ me, and I write it frankly and without attempting to conceal any- thing. Having finished rhe lemer, I now re-read it as if I am the man I am sending it to.I try ro suspend all that I know about myself, pretend that I am a total stranger reading the letter for the first time, trying to understand how it will strike the reader. I treat the letter 'purely as a phenomenon'. This is bracketing, the temporary suspen- sion of the natural standpoint. An objection will be seen immediately. It is rrue thar I can, with an effort, put myself outside myself and treat the letter purely as a phenomenon. And yet even if I am a total stranger reading the letter, I am stitl applying sorne preconceptions to it. I know it is written by a human being, and I know various things about human beings in general. If I withdraw myself too far from the letter, it will become merely a white sheet covered with signs. The next stage would be to close my eyes and be- come totally unconscious of it. Plainly the simple act of reading the letter is nor as simple as it seems on the surface. How far can we sort out the different layers of preconception as we read it?.This is the task that Husserl sets himself. For if we can learn how to read a letter without prejudice, then we are pre- pared to start reading the universe without prejudiie - to start philosophizing, that is. I am not concerned at this point to analyse Husserl's complicated system of. epochis (as he calls the act of bracketing) and 'reductions'. What is more important is 9r 9o"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"to grasp the essence of his method, which attempts to analyse the act of perception. Its first object is to force us to study consciousness more closely. The history of art provides an illuminating parallel. The ancient Greeks had no idea of perspective. If you asked a Greek artist to sketch you a house, he would have drawn a square with windows and a door. You might have pointed out: 'But we can also see the other wall.' The artist would have added another square to the first. At this point, you might say to him: 'But observe closely. Does that second wall appear to us as a square? We know it is a square? But how does it appear to you?' By pointing out to him th?t it appears as a parallelog?rfi, you would have tairght him the essence of perspective. The lesson would have been a simple illustration of phenomenology. 'Do not tell me what it is; suspend your belief in its real existence and only tell me what you see.' Cdzanne had grasped the essence of phenomenology years before Husserl formulated the method; he ex- pressed his approach to painting in the words: 'An eye, a brush.' Cdzanne was a phenomenological painter; this is the reason that he appeals as a purist. In.some ways, painting provides the simptrest illustra- tion of flusserl's approach. Consider the work of a liter- ary painter whose-picture tells a srory, like 'When did you last see your father?' Such a painting requires a human level of interpretation as well as the pure atten- tion that would be brought to Cdzanne. If we wished to consider it purely as painting, then the story level would have to be 'bracketed out'. Even so, we cannot yet con- sider it purely as a painting, because it contains human figures, and even if we feel no curiosity about their story, there is anocher level of curiosity aLout the figures - whether they are attractive human beings or not. This level can also be bracketed out, leaving only a series of shapes on the canvas. Now at last we,are ready to analyse the workings of intentionality'. We know about our emotional response to the story, we know about our interest in the hum.an shapes. But why do we feel certain responses to the forms and colours when these extraheous responses have been bracketed out? we are now analys. , irg our response to an abstract design. (w. can even ' bracket out our awareness of the col6urs, and consider the painting purely as architecture.) Phenomenology, in short, is the stud,y of the way that consciousness perceiaes objects. Now it can be seen that Husserl's method has an im- mediate application to rhe probrem stated earlier in this book. The world appears to have 'no grain', to be poker- faced when interrogated about its r-elation to hlman aspirations and destiny. It most carefully conceals the colour of its whiskers behind a fan. phenomenology pro- vides a new starting point. when I stare at the world in al1 attempt to see some meaning in nature, it seems to me that-my static consciousness ii confronted by a poker- faced world. Husserl has shown that my consciousiess is not as static as I thought, and the poker-faced world is not the real world at all, but a woild of symbols. The . world seems t9 !\" wearing a m'ask, and my *ina seems to confronr it helplessly; then I discover that my conscious- ness is a cheat, a double agent. rt carefully fixed the mask on reality, then pretended to know nothing about it. It can now, be seen 11hy Husserl gave existential philo- sophy a new imperus. Kierkegaard calred himself u prrito- sgpher, but Mach would never have admitted his right to this title at all; in the eyes of a scientist, existential philgggphy was _o_nly anorher name for autobiographical - rambling. Now Husserl had provided existential-ism with a scientific method: the description of consciousness and the way it apprehends the world. what use s'artre and Heidegger made of this method - or failed ro rnake - will ne aeic-rined in the next chapter. But the next point to be made is one on which Husserl parts company with most later existentialists.

He often spoke of the task of phenomenology as being $e approach to 'rhe mothers', ihe keepers of the key oI the ultimate sources of being (alludinf to the .mothers, of part two of Goethe's Faust). The 'life-world' may be defined as the world of our living experience, as distinguished from the world of abstractions with which science deals. This life-world is not the world as seen from the natural standpoint, since this world is, as we have shown, largely ; world of abstractions of a different kind. But the life-worrd is rqore primitive than the world seen from the natural standpoint; it can only be separated from this world by a certain reduction, a suspension of science, an attempt to see the world without categories of logic or mathemitics. The work of Heidegger and Sartre is a development of this idea of the life-world; Heideggefs Sein unh Zeit, of. which I *ul|-lpeak in rhe next chaprer, is an attempt to present the life-world in all its complexity, beford our human tendency to familiarize and iimpliiy can get to work on it. t This outline o{ Husserl's phenomenology will help to 9fglfy one of the mosr obviously baffiing featurei of Whitehead's 'two modes of perception,. We fina it very difficult to believe that 'immidiacy-perceprion, is not thi most basic mode of perception. When wt are bored, we find ourselves stuck in a world of objects, a meaningless worl{ whereas when we are excited by ideas or by mirsic, our 'meaning-perception' seems to expand. Surely, ih that case, most animals would possesi immediacy-per- ception without meaning-perception - not vice versa, as Whitehead suggests? An.animal's world must be rather bgrin-g, by 9u1 srandards (which is no doubt why we use the phrase 'a dog's life'), and an animal, certainly, has no capacity for getting carried away by ideas or art: But consider for a moment what science teaches us 96 eycs are actually registering the impact of two difierent wavelengths of light, and passirrg oi this information ro qy brain.

The process was rather Iike w-hat happens when a child learns io read and write, but far more _complicated. We do not really .seel colours; we read them, but the reading has become so automatic that it has become seeing. rt will now be seen why preser,taiional immediacy is a 'higher' form of perception than causal efficacy. All the rmmense concentration and mental efiort that goes into -seeing and hearing is done by us subconsciousl|; we are born with it. when a- mal yiwnr in a dentist's'waiting- room and says 'r am bored', he does not realize that his boredom - that seems the cheapest and most common thing i1 the world - has been purchased by millions o{ ),ears of effort; as a commodity, it is more expensive than radium.

GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY At the same time that Husserr was formurating the method of _ph€nomenolo_gy_, a number of psy.h;frgi;; were formulating a psychology that was alfo'a kind of 'answer to Hume'. this.chafter would be incomplete without an outline of their viiws. In r8go, the German thinker vori Ehrenfers pointed out that th-ough the ear can analyse a musical sound into a tone and various partial tones, these are heard in a 1o1g of certain pitch, ulg. p.. pitch does not correspond to the sum of its tones.

The scientist of the 'age of reason' regarded the scientific method as the reverie of that of religion, since religion starts from faith (preconceptions).

Gestalt psychology replies, in efiect: No, science .is a temporary reversal of the natural flow of the living mind. The scientist never merely 'observes'; it is not true that Jre looks first and judges later; he would see nothing if he did not judge first.

Accounts of Heidegger's think- .ing are generally prefaced with the sratement that he is the most difficult of modern philosophers. This is true; brrt not in the sense that is usually iniended. Admittedly, his language and mode of self-expression are even more difficult than Whitehead's. But this is partly a kind of elumsiness, and partly his way of utilizing Husserl,s con- cepts. Acquaintance with Elusserl, and the use of a cer- tain amount of intuition, can overcome this barrier. The real difficulty of Heidegger is of another kind, closer to the difficulty presented by the work of William Blake. Even more than flusserl, he is.a poet or a mystic trying lo expless his intuitions in the language of philosophi. But no amount of study can make a conne.ted .systeri, of his work. Sometimes he arrives at the goals that he has 'announced in advance; sometimes he-arrives at quite different goals than the ones he announced; but most often, his works remain signposts pointing towards goals that he seems unable to reach. H1 is at once the most rewarding and the most exasperating of existentialist thinkers. - Heidegger was prevented from studying under Husserl by financial difficulties, but he became Husserl's assistanr in Freiburg in rg16; his major work, Being and, Time lyOzl) yur_ published in Husserl's Phenimenological Yearbqok..

Serious discussion, the attempt to burst througli this dead language to urgencies, is regarded as bad taste. There are times when Heidegger seems to be writing a more serious version of Stephen Potter's books on One- Upmanship. (They could certainly be used ad ideal illustrations of what he means by inauthentic existence.) How can man escape inauthenticity? There are two yryr. First of all, one must live constantly in the face of _e1ft, recognizing it as the ultimate neceisity. (Gurdjiefi had also declared rhat man could escape from his failen- 'ness if he had an organ that made him constantly aware of the date of his death.) Heidegger goes further tLan the biblical idea of 'remembering the last things', he takes over Nietzsche's idea of an active acceptance of death, willing it as one's ultimate fate, a:mor fati,. There is another way - and to this Heidegger has de- voted most of his work since Being and Time. poetry and gyll can bring man closer to tha realm of pure lieing. Heidegger is fascinated by the poetry of Hciiderlin, an? has published several essays analysing it. The Greeks felt that the alternative to the messy real world is the worrd of ideas; Heidegger prefers to believe that it is the rearm of poetry or spirit: He sees the conflict between .the world and holiness' as the fundamental characteristic of Hdlderlin's poetry. He also symbolizes the world of holiness in the Greek gods; he seems to .mean by these what Husserl meant by the Mothers, the .keepers,of the keys of Being'. So to some extent, the rift betwee-n Heidegger and Husserl begins to vanish when one com- pares their later work. It would not be true to say that Heidegger,s final posi- tion is pessimistic, even though his idea? 'existence-to- lo8 :wards-death' dominares his philosophy. His attirude to death is stoical rather than, pessimistic; but his belief that poetry is a key to authenticity has a definite nore of ppJimlsm.* But perhaps more important rhan any of this is his fundamental insight: that ihe cause of the-decrine and crisis in human history is due to forgetfulness of Be- ing. This must be examined further aftei the analysis of Sartre. There is a central objection to the work of Heidegger, which also applies ro Kierkegaar4 Marcel, Jaspers-ind Sartre. Language, as Heidegger points out, tends to ob- scure Being (or truth). This is particularly rrue of the abstrac-t- language of science and philosophy. So it is a ,contradiction ro talk about 'existential pfiil6sophy,. The Zen masters sometimes found it necessary to kick ; pupil downstairs to free his mind from its bondage to idias and make him grasp the essence of reality. so in a sense, it might be said that the philosopher who attempts to 'unveil Being' in a ponderous analysis is like a man who digs a hole by throwing each shovelful of earth over his shouldet so that it simply falls back in the hore. A piece of music or a painting would stand a better chanie of convgying_ the- essence of reality than a philosophicar treatise; the chances of a play or a novel ire somiwhat higher.'But this is nor an ultimate objection. An idea is not-necessarily the antithesis of reality; a vital mind could train itself to absorb ideas without blunting its :ens: of Being. But it must be admitted that Heidegler,s fondness for ten-syllable German words is likely to 6Iunt all but the strongest minds. SARTRE sartre was strongly influenced both by Husserl aud Heidegger. The influence of Kierkegaard, is also clearly present. .

There is a note of optimism in his constant euphasis on the idea of free- dom; and yet the overall tone of his philosophy is rationalistic and pessimistic. I have analysed the literary aspect of his work elsewhere,* so I shall confine this an'alysis, for the most part, to his philosophical ideas. As soon as one examines Sartre's most fundamenta:L idea, one sees why pessimism and defeat are unavoidable. He is a Cartesian; he rejects the whole notion of the 'un- conscious mind', and believes that consciousness must mean something which is aware of itself. Inevitably, then, he finds himself tangled in the problems that baffied philosophy for two centuries. It seems ironical that Sartre was a follower of }Iusserl, and yet failed to accept the most important aspect of I{usserl's work. And yet his first book, The Transcend,- cnce of the Ego, written in 1936, is simply a denial of flusserl's concept of the transcendent'al ego. Admittedly, this attitude is foreshadowed in Brentano, who, when he said 'No love without something loved, no hate without something hated' etc, might also have been implying that mental states are thus dependent upon their objects. But for Sartre, consciousness cannot be regarded as 'in- tentional' in the sense of possessing motives of which it is' not normally aware. It is a mere 'wind blowing towards ' objects', an emptiness, a kind of eternal observer with no power to do anything but observe. I{usserl had trans- formed Brentano's concept of intentionality into some- thing far more active; now Sartre restored its passivity. Consciousness, said Sartre, is intentionality. It is also freedom. Why did Sartre do this? His motive, it seems, was rationalistic. He wanted to restore phenomenology to its old simplicity, to the state wheri there was a clear division between subject and object. Descartes had based his philosophy on this clear division; he was'in here', the it In The Outsid,er and. The Age of Defeat. rlo r'world was 'out thgre'. Berkeley, Kant and the rest had : betrayed philosophy into solipsism, total subjectivism. Husserl seemed to have rescued it from.this state; once again there was a clear division: objects out there; con- sciousness in here (but directed at objects). Then Husserl placed the transcendental ego in charge of .consciousness, and we were once again not sure of which was the object ,, and which was consciousness. For intentionality, accord- ing to ffusserl, performs its work on data (or hyle - stuft - as he preferred to call it), and the consciousness knows this, not the object itself. S'artre would seem to feel Heidegger's distrust of sub- jectivity - the stifling little inner-world furnished with ideas and worn-out language - and wants to turn to a real world of objects for relief. ffence this strange anti- subjectivism. Two of the best books on Sartre - by Iris Murdoch and . Maurice Cranston - have pointed out this strong,anti- emotional tendency, and also the curious puritanism of Sartre's disposition, his constant reference to the physical world in terms of disgust. His rationalism - the desire to reduce the world to straight lines and clean surfaces - is a kind of passion. Hence this rejection of the subcon- scious. The rationalism is a reaction against the disgusq it seems to be an attempt to irtrpose a logical order on a disturbing world. Under different circumstances, one feels that Sartre would have been a follower of Comre or Mach, and been glad to see the world in terms of a simple materialism. And yet at this point, there is another paradox. Earlier 'reaLists' had felt that the real existence of the external ' world is something to be pleased about. Bertrand Rus- sell, for example, describing his own early mehtal de- velopment, wrote: 'Bradley argued that everything com- mon sense believes is mere appearance; we reverted to the opposite extreme and thought that eaerything is real that common sense, uninfluenced by philosophy or theology, supposes real. With a sense of escaping frorh ; \\"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"prison, we allowed ourselves to think that grass is green, that the sun and stars would exist if no oni was aware of them.' But this real external world disgusts Sarffe as much as man's confined subjective world; he seems to seek relief in Plato's world of ideas. This becomes apparent in one of Sartre's earliest and most interesting books, the novel Nausea. It concerns a man called Roquentin who is living in a French seaside town and writing a history of an eighteenth-century diplomat. He is overwhelmed by sudden strange insights. The first happens when he picks up a stone to throw into the sea. 'I saw something which disgusted me; I no longer know whether it was the stone or the sea.' And the roots of a tree in the park become 'a knotty mass, entirely beastly'. \"What has happened is that Roquentin has somehow lost the defence of inauthenticity that keeps marr away from Being; suddenly he realizes that things exist in their own right. Sartre was not aware of it, but Whitehead had dealt urith precisely this problem in Symboli,sm. For example, Whitehead writes: As William Pitt, the Prime Minister . . . luy on his death bed ... he was heard to murmur: \"I,Vhat shades we a^re, what shadows we pursue\". ffis mind had sud- denly lost the sense of causal efficacy, and was illumin- ated by the remembrance of the intensity of emotion that had enveloped his life, in its comparison with the b,arren emptinesi of the world passing iir sense presenta- tion.' Whitehead comments: '...in some tired moments there comes a sudden relaxation, and the mere presenta- tional side of the world overwhelms with a sense of its emptiness'. Whitehead recognized that the new vision of cmptiness is not a glimpse of reality; the reality is the world of causal efficacy. What has happened to Roquen- tin is that his faculty of intenrionaliryt has slipped, leav- ing him in a universe divested of meaning. Sartre himself can find no answer to these problems. Roquentin has many experiences of 'nau$ea', ^when the tt2 I ' world is seen as meaningless; yet he 'also has other ex- ,'il ( tli . ii{' $S1 ,hd IL '1., .

But there is an essentil ally static quality about the book. All that Sartre can do is to present these two opposed states, and make his hero realize that he has been living inauthentically. But there is no real solution; for all we know, Roquentin goes ofi to kill himself at the end of the book. - Always in Sartre's -work there is this feeling of the two 'realities' contradicting one another. At times - particu- l*ty]-\" the early worli -- there is a strong nore of optim- ism. If man can stop deceiving himself, Sartre impli6s; he c_an -express his freedom. He must recognize thailGod is dead', that man is alone in an empty universe. But there is a feeling of courage abour this. Cirestes, in The Flies, refuses to make himself responsible to Zeus, and when Zeus demands'Who created you?', replies: 'you did, but you made one mistake: you created me free., It was .this aspec-t of sartre that made him such a powerful influence on the younger generation after th; war.

It is not made clear in what fundamental sense his guilt-differs from that of Orestes. But the full consequences of Sartre's denial of the transcendental ego appear in his most famous work -Be- ing and, Nothingness (rg+g). The world that Sarrre creates in this is a world completely without meaning. Being and Nothingness resembles Heideggefs Being and, Time in that it is an artempt to describe the human condition using the phenomenological method; it is writ- ten more dearly than Heidegger's work, although there are times when Sartre seems wittutty to imitate ihe Ger- man's ponderousness.* There are, according to Sartre, three kinds of being. Objects have being 'in-itself' (en soi). People have being 'for-itself', because consciousness exists for itself (whereas objects do not). Finally, there is being-for-orhers, which means that we all exist in the eyes of other people, and our estimate of ourselves comes from what other people think of us. Consciousness for-itself is an emptiness (a nothingness, Sartre calls it - hence the title); a man left completely alone would not be aware of his psychic existence. (Cdnrad's Heart of Darkness might be taken as a parable illustrating rhis attitude.) The gaze of other people makes me exist for myself, and my gaze makes other people exist. If my gaze is contemptuous and dis- missive, then its recipient will exist less; if it is admiring, he will exist more. So all relations between people are a form of conflict. Real love is an impossibility, for what I really want from you, is for you to give me more exist- ence by admiring me. Since the same applies to you, love is at the best a bargain, and'at the worst a conflict; thete can be no real exchange. Hatred, sadism and masochism are subjected to the same kind of analysis, and proved to * In an article on Sartre quoted by Maurice Cranston, Mme de BEauvoir remarks that _young Sartre was never so happy as when he could not understand whal he was writing. t14 ust as frustrating. It is not surprising that Sartre ends the famous conclusion: L'homme est une passion le. is doctrine of existence only in the eyes of others (which, like the categories of for-itself and in-itself, Sartre has adapted from Hegel) is a natural consequence of the denial of the transcendental ego and of causal efficacy. If consciousness is an emptiness, it follows that it can only become a 'somethingness' by having things imposed on it - that is to say, inauthentically. Ar fiist sight, Sartre's views seem to be supported by our common experience. ft is true that if I am caught looking through a keyhole, I feel myself suspended on the end of the other's gaze, stained with guilt; it is true that flattery gives me a sense of importance. This is to say that for a large.parr of the time, my consciousness is purely passive. But what of the sudden moments of intensity when my inner being seems to light up, or to harden into reality? What of Roquen- tin's experience listening to One of these days? If Sirtre is indined to dismiss these as illusion, then he is advanc- ing a view that amounts to'a new Watsonian material- ism, with consciousness as a mere reflection of matter. But in fact, Sartre has never faced the implication of Roquentin's moments of reality, of anti-nausea. The con stant refrain of Nausea is the phrase 'There's no ad- venture'; yet at the end of the Sunday when he becomes a*Te of the poetry of the external world, Roquentin writes: 'Then I felt my heart swell with a great feeling of adventure', and says 'For a moment I wondered if I were not going to love humanity' (which recalls Greeners 'I was discovering in myself a thing I thought I had never,possessed: a love of life'). But Roquentin hastens to add: 'But after all, it was their Sunday, not mine., The meaning, the 'adventure' of which Roquentin be- came aware, canxe from outside.

Accotding to Being and Nothi,ng ness, this is an impossibility. One of the most revealing things that has been written about Sartre appears in Mlle de Beauvoir's The Prime of Life, the second volume of her autobiography. About a year before the writing of Nausea, Sartre took mescalin. Mlle de Beauvoir says: 'He had not exactly had hal- lucinations, but the objects he looked at changed their appearance in the most horrifying rnanner; umbrellas had become vultrtres, shoes turned into skeletons, and faces acquired monstrous characteristics, while behind him, just past the corner of his eye, swarmed crabs and polyps and grimacing Things ... I was wearing a pair of crocodile-skin shoes, the laces of which ended in two acornlike objects; he expected to see them turn into gigantic dung beetles at. any moment. There was also an orang-utan . . . which kept its leering.face glued to the window.' A few days later: 'His visual faculties became distorted; houses had leering faces, all eyes and jaws, and he couldn't help looking at every clockface he passed, expecting it to display the features of an owl - which it always did. He knew perfectly well that such objects were in fact houses and clocks, and no one could say he be- li,eaed in their eyes and gaping maws - but a time might well come when he would believe in them; one day he would be really'convinced there was a lobster trotting along behind him.'re Significantly, she mentions that Sartre was in a state of deep depression when these things rArere occurring, and believed he would go insane. Compare this with the account in Nausea: 'And then, all of a sudden, ther.e it was, clear as day: existence had suddenly unveiled itself. It had lost the harmless look of an abstract category; it was the very paste of things; this root was kneaded into existence. Or rather the root, the park gates, the bench, the sparse grass, all vanished; the * English ed. p. 169. rr6 iliversity of things, their individuality, were only an iii. appearance, a veneer. This veneer had rnelted, leaving i' soft monstrous masses, all in disorder - naked with i ,r frightful, obscene nakedness.' i#l- The word 'naked' recalls Aldous Huxley's use of it in , fr. describing his own mescalin experiences in Doors of per- ,s ception. But there is here a curious difference. What fli; g\"\"ley saw was 'what Adam saw on the morning of his ftl first creation the miracle, moment by momint, of fl-- naked existence'. It would also seem that mescalin de- I hvered Huxley from the world of inauthenticity: ,1, 'Mescalin had delivered me (from) the world of selves, of ,$', time, of moral judgements arrd utilitarian considera- ,tl tions, the world . . . of self-assertion, of cocksureness, of ffllt over-valued words and idolarrously worshipped norions, ,lU in short, from 'forgetfulness of Existence'. Like ,,ffi:t Roquentin, Huxley became aware that things existed in , !!eir own right, but the realization was enrirely pleasant. lr Huxley uses the word istigheit to describe it: - 'is-ness,. l1 His bookshelf is filled with 'red books, like rubies; &:.. emerald books; books bound in white jade; books of agate, of aquamarine, of yellow topaz; lapis lazuli books whose colour was so intense, so intrinsically meaningful, ;, that they seemed to be on rhe point of leaving the shelves ,, to thrust themselves more insistently on my attention, (my italics).

Mescalin has the\"effect of sweeping away the 'thought riddled nature', so that reality is seen as if through a magnifying glass. The effect is like that of waking up suddenly on a train and finding a stranger with his face thrust within an inch of one's own. A nervous person would scream; a baby would probably smile, since it would associate this kind of proximity with its mother. It is clear from Doors of Per- ception that Huxley's attitude towards the world was basically one of trust. (It is equally clear from Mme de Beauvoir's account of Sai'tre's relationship with other women - with strong elements of jealousy and aggressive- ness - that Sartre's attitude was the opposite of trust or 'abandonment of selfhood'. These experiences take on altogether new meanings in the light of Whitehead's book. Whitehead calls 'causal efficacy' 'the sense of controlling presences', arrd gives as an example the fears we sometimes feel in the dark. He points out that 'mo$t living creatures of daytime habits 'are nervous in the dark'. If Hume is right, the sense of meaning ought to vanish in the dark and increase in the daylight, not vice versa. 'This the sense of unseen pres- ences in the dark is the reverse of what should happen.' It might be objected that the sense of unseen presences . in the dark is illusion, a remnant of the fear felt by our distant ancestors, Iistening for wild beasts. But Huxley suggests another reason. 'Experimental psychologists have found that if you confine a man to a \"restricted environment\", where there is no sound or light, nothing to smell, and if you put him in a tepid bath, with only one almost impercbptible thing to touch, the victim will soon start \"seeing things\", 'ohearing things\" and having strange bodily sensations. He explains the mescalin efiect by saying that it interferes with the enzyme system of the brain. By starving the brain of sugar, 'it lowers the rrB :l l'.efficigncy of the brain as an instrument for focusing the ,,mind on the problems of life on the surface of this planet. This lowering of what may be called the bio- logical efficiency of the brain seems to permit entry into consciousness of certain classes of mental events which. ar€ norm'ally exclude4 because they posses$ no survival value'. The efiect of mescalin on Huxley was to remove all desire to do anything; a world in which everyone took mescalin would have no wars, but it would have no civil- ization either. Huxley quotes a theory of C. D. Broad to the effect that the nervous system is not designed to let things in but torkeep them out. The brain contains a filter to pre- vent the mind from being srtl2mped with useless know- Iedge and experience,'and mescalin puts this filter out of action. (See also Page 168). In the light of Husserl's ideas, we know that there is no need to posit a particular filter or reducing valve; man rains his mind for survival - and also for evolution; the function of intentionality is mainly eliminative. From all this, we can begin to grasp the fundamental difierence between the existentialism-of Heidegger and that of sartre. Heidegger's basic intuition is closeito that of Hgxleyi the possibility of the real exisrence of objects outside himself strikes him as a form of salvation; hlnce his emphasis upon the 'forgetfulness of Existence, as the fundamental (if necessary) evil of the modern world, and a nostalgrc looking-backward to a simpler state of things , in Ancient Greece - or in the narure poerry of Hiilderlii. .Sartre, like Greene, seems to see the world from a lower energy level; his 'indifference threshold, is wider; con- sequently the external world is usually seen in negative terms, and his internal world provides no efiictive escape.* The alternative is to take up an aggressive atti- tude towards the external world, to see it ai something --,. Th.. pub\\tion of the firsr volume of Sartre,s autobiography W.o1ds^(rg0+)- se'Eyns to confirm the above speculations; the p\"r\"in.i with Greene becomes even more striking. .rt .1t 'r! lit' I ;id, . :..i{ il ,t t I .4 I .ll ;i '! ,i' i!' r19"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"SPon which categories or ideas -- or social neforms * rrxus;t be imposed\" THE ULTI${ATE OBJECTION TO SARTRE To'surrlrfiarize: it will be seen that both Heidegger and sartre recognize, in their different ways, that t6'-funda- ye11al problern for existentialism is rire problem of rhe 'st Neot margin'.

Most nnen are so wrapped up in their everyday affairs thatft,[rey need nothing else ro give them a iolid $en$e of ideE*ity. This applies particularly to rhe scien- tists and philosophers of the nineteenth century, who were too absorbed in their version of progress to notice , that anything was wrong\" Only a few of the more sensi' tive ones became aware that there wa$ sofirethirg funda- rnentally wrong with the Cartesian outlook as applied to a godless universe. Jouffroy was one of theie, and William Jarnes quotes the passage in which, Jouffroy described his own atternpts to 'doubt everything'\" I shall never forget that night of December in which [kre veil that concealed from rne my orvn incredulity was torn.

Heidegger also recognizes contingency in his attitude towards death - that it is inescapable, and that there is no immortality, personal or otherwise. The sense of contingency is the outcome of accepting the simple Cartesian attitude - that consciousness ii pas- sive, a 'wind blowing towards objects'. It can mean one of two things; that life ts so fundament4lly insecure and meaningless that there is no point in even thinking; or that Cartesianism is an error. The first can hardly be called an alternative, for the result of total acceptince of it would not be an'attitude', it would be pure terror; man would look at the universe around him with the feelings of a rabbit facing a snake. The second alterna- tive is the only one possible to human beings. The first one, properly faced, amounts to hurling oneself into a furnace. We can only conclude, therefore, that neither Sartre nor Heidegger did face it completely; it would have led them into the state of mind of Tolstoy's madman - from which it is hardly possible to write books of philosophy. And yet Sartre has continued to declare thathe is bisic- ally a Cartesian, and that he cannot accept that con- sciousness is anything more than an 'emptiness', an observer. It should now be clear what are rhe implications of the attitude of Husserl and Whitehead when applied to science. For better or worse, Descartes' God vanished. All that was left of the Cartesian position was the feeling that it was quite right that consciousness should confronl the unknown universe; after all, it had the methods of science to help it investigate. Then Tolstoy stumbled on the objection. 'But who am f? Never mind about the un- known universe - that can wait.

Husserl and Whitehead did not provide an answer; but at least they provided something-that could save the philosopher from plunging into the despair of Tolstoy,s madinan: the recbgnitlon that 'Who im I?, is nor a lightning-fla^$h that destroys all man's pretensions, but a reasonable q-uestion that can be investigated like any other scientific problem.

'That such a life is likely to be ecstatically happy I will not claim. But that it can be lived in quiet content, accepting resignedly what cannot be 'helped, not expecting the impossible, and thankful for small mercies, this I would maintain.' Stace predicts that if man cannot learn to do this, he will sink back to a 'humble place among the lower animals'. This states the problem clearly, and it obviously pro- vides no answer, unless a rather joyless and resigned stoicism be regarded as an answer. As Stace puts it, there are no other alternatives. Implicit in the ideas of Whitehead and Husserl is the possibility of another alternative. The scientific view of the universe is the Cartesian view _ man's conscfous mind probing unknown nature, the known confronted by the unknown. Husserl has demolished this view of passive consciousness, and therefore without fully grasping the implications of his own revolution = de- molished the epistemology of science. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MODERN SCIENCN? Let us consider this question of the, scientific outlook more closely - first of all, in biology, which in certain fund'amental respects, seems to disagree with physics. For example, in a famous passage in The Nature of the Phy* ical World, Eddington speaks of the primacy of the 'second law of thermodyn'amics ('Energy can only flow from a higher to a lower level'), which 'stands aloof from all the other laws of nature'. This law is sometimes called the law of entropy, and it states that entropy must always increase. (Entropy is the element of disorder in the uni- verse; if I drop a pack of cards, I have increased its dis- order; but if I carefully sort them out again, I have still increased the total disorder in the universe, because I re8 F-[r. dissipated energy in doing so.)

They may disagree , there is at least nb aisagreement. , But having said this, we now confront certain funda- . ' mental disagreements, which mu$t be explained at some r length. According to Darwin, species change by 'natural selec- tion', which favours the strongest. There is no need to , posit an 'evolutionary force' whose purpose is to build op the case of the Japanese Heike crab, whose back has a ' design that so reiembles the face of an ang'ry warrior that the Japanese will not eat it, believing it to be inhabited by the spirit of one of a tribe of warriors who committed suicide in r rb5 by leaping into the sea. There is obviously Ro question of the crab hnowing that it will not be eaten if it can learn to resemble a warrior. What has happened is that the crabs that least resembled warriors got eaten; i the others mated, and so on - natural selection 'polishing up' the resemblance until today it is uncannily precise.* There are far more unfavourable mutations than favour- - able ones; but it is the favourable ones that survive - hence evolution. Now even Darwin was slightly worried by thts x New Bottles for New Wine, lg5g, p. rB7. r30 #ir'\"t a mindless and purposeless evolution; rowards ttie end ffi'' of.his life he expressed strong misgivings abour it; for if 'I, mind was an accidental product of nature, how could it t1 ti. ,jr -{ .r{ 1i 'J t,,-,,.i ,.4 :\",1\" picture make value judgements?

Darwin accepted rhat Lamarck was r probably right ro a limited exGnt; for him, natural selection did not completely rule out Lamarckian evolu- tion, although he thought that its effects were probably very slighr when compared to those of natuial selec- tion. rn the second half of the nineteenth century, a monk called the Abbc Mendel made certain experiments coir- cerning the growing of peas, and when their results event-ually became known, they seemed to deliver a kill: ing blow ro rhe Lam'arckian theory.

Mutations are due to changes that take place in the ' gehes. We now know that radiation afiects the genes and caR cause mutations. Since all living organisms are under a constant_bombardment from outer space, it would seem that we need look no further for the reason that species change. It will now be seen why the work of Mendel destroyed the possibility of Lamarckian evolution. According'to Lamarck, an animal changes some fundamental charac- teristic because it wants to - or has to if it is to survive; this change is then passed on to the children. Let us sup- pose that a pair of crocodiles find their way into some northern lake, and manage to surviv€ the cold.* Accord- ing to Lamarck, w€ could expect their children and descendants to be born with thiiker skins, larger bodies - or whatever characteristics the crocodiles had developed to resist the cold. According to Mendel, the young croco- diles would be exactly like their parents, and would have to develop similar powers of resiitance on their own; the same would be true of the thousand.th generation of crocodiles, unless some chance mutation had happened to occur. The genes cannot be afiected by the will of the individual; therefore there can be no inheritance of acquired characteristics. The al.ternative to this mechanistic principle had been first advanced by Georg T'rnst Stahl in the seventeenth century - the notion called 'vitalism' - that the body is not governed by physical and chemical laws, but by the action of a soul or vital force; even in our own time, a form of vitalism was held by the biologist Hans Driesch.f * As a single crocodile is actually supposed to have survived in Loch Ness, according to Commander Gould. f This type of vitalism tends to be dualistic - to believe that the body is a machine operate4 by a ghostly soul that is in some way the; 9x1ct jounterpart of the body. The arguments applied by Gilbert lyle in The Concept ol Minil to the Cartesian body-soul dualisrn also apply to this vitalism. rg2 Fli,ISr form of vitalism has become somerhing of an Aunt ft$,F Sal]y to modern biologists and psychologistsi ,i' - $h3* and Bergson were both vilalists in another sense; ': , that is to say, they believed that evolution is not a purely , r mechanical process, but is the result of a forc€r fnor€ or:., less'purposive, which shaw called the life-force, and Bergson the ilan aital. samuel Butler had attacked; .

The reason for this is obvious. Soviet ideology was optimistic, and emphasized the importance of the will. If acquired characteristics could be inherited, then the educated peasant could pass on his advantages to his children in a biological as well as a social sense. A horticulturalist called Michurin was the patron saint of the neo-Lamarckian movement. Michurin claimed that the heredity of plants can be altered by cer- tain experiments - mainly by u process called 'shatter- ind, a kind of shock treatment - and that this new heredity will be transmitted to all future generations. An Austrian biologist named Kammerer had made a spec- tacular daim to have demonstrated the inheritance of acquired characteristics in toads and salamanders; but it was discovered that certain of his specimens had been faked. Kammerer declared that someone had tampered with them to discredit him, but he was generally dis- believe4 and committed suicide.* Michurin died in rggb, his views favoured by Stalin, since they seemed to demonstrate that environment is the all-important factor - a view that obviously fits in closely with Marxian materialism and its dialectic of history. In the same year, Trofim Lysenko published a book, on which he had collaborated with the philosopher Prezent, attacking Mendelianism - or at least, the aspect of it that *Kammerer claimed to have demonstrated the inheritance of acquired characteristics with midrvife toads - a variety in which the male carries the female's eggs on his legs until they hatch. Several generations were raised under abnormal conditions, some entirely out of water, some in water with islands that were kept too hot to afford anything but tempo ary rest. He claimed that the male toads raised on land lost their egg-carrying habit, while the water toads developed horny pads on tfre ttnimUl, possessed by ordinary frogs to hold on to their mates in the water. Dr G. K. Noble noticed that the 'pads' were actually injections of Indian ink under the skin.

(Sir Julian Iiluxley retorted that we can no rnore explain evolution in terms of. ilan aital than we can gxplain the motion of a train by saying it possesses an ilan loco-' rnotif.) Darwin's discovery of the mechanism of natural selection meant that no force was necessary; nature favours'complexification'; therefore, evolution could be the result of 'accident'. There was no need for God, or 'universal purpose'. Post-Mendelian biology has coo- fiirmed the Darwinian position. Waddington and Huxley have shown that inheritance of acquired characteristics is unnecessary r in fact, downright undesirable, since de- generative characteristics would also be,heritable. It is now clear that evolution is a far Inore complicated pro- cess than Darwin realized, and that simple 'mutationism' is a long way from being able to explain it. Environment daes afrect the genes, but by a process of what Huxley call.s 'cybernetic feedback', not in a simple Lamarckian way.{e It might seem, then, that we are back in the 'mindless' universe of nineteenth century materialism. In fact, this is not so. The development of biology in the fast fifty years has demonstrated that Shaw was wrong to assume thaf the only hope for true evolutionism lies in the inheritance of acquired characteristics. To begin with, no biologist to- day holds the view that'living matter is fundamentally indistinguishable from inorganic matter - that is, that Iife is some sort of an emanation of matter; a by-product of the 'running down of the universe'.

Man All this is expressed with great force by sir Julian [{uxlgla an rycggpromising neo-Darwinian. In an\"essay, 'Man's Place in Nature', he writes: .All nature is a singli process. we may properly call it evolution, if we defne evolution as a self-operating, self-transforming process which in its course generates both greater vaiieiy a,nd higher levels of grgalizations'.* He [oes on to say that there are three levels or processes In nature: the in- - organig the biolosiul and ihe human. on the inorganic level, 'complexificition' is limited and slow. on thJ bio- l\"q.ul level, with the aid of natural selection, the tempo is faster. on the human level, the change seems to -be accelerating all the time. , The full significance of this can be seen by reconsider- ing the. plssage {rom the opening of Wells,s'E xperiment , i: Autiobiogro?hy (cited on pagJg6).

Huxley srares his biological credo in a remarkable Tsay called Transhurnanism, that opens his book New Bottles for New wine. From this, it ian be seen that the discrediting of Lamarck and Lysenko makes no real difference to the evolutionist vision; there is no danger of a lapse into the mechanistic outlook of the nineteenth century. Huxley begins by stating: 'As a result of a thousand rnillion lgars-of evolution,lhe universe is becoming con- scious of itself, able to understand something of iti past history and its possible future. This cosmic ,\"ff-u*ur.r.r, is being realized in one tiny fragment of the universe - in a few of us human beings.'

Dead matter can obey only natural laws; it might be said that water possesses 'purpose' in flowing down- hilt, if purpose is understood simply as a movement to- wards a ceriain end. An'animal possesse$ purpose when it goes in search of food, but it has a wider range of choices than a stream flowing downhill; it is incapable of pur- poses beyond a certain range of instincts.

Some of these drives have come 'from 'outside', 'have been built up by consciousne$s type, for example\" But this cannot be said of the sexuatr impulse.

The central objection, then, to the Huxley-Wells notion that evolution has so far been mechanical, and that it is only now becomirg purposive (in man), can be $ummarized in two words: Carpenter's monkeys\" Let us imagine a mechanist of the old Watsonian sctrool, who feels that Fluxley and Wells are allowing their idealismn to get the better of their scientific training, and who be- lieves that rll'an, like all animals, is a rnachine pure anct simple - a machine with consciousness, but no wiItr. This man will argue that there is no evidence at all of a. 'break' between biological rnaterial and human material.. He will, of course, agree with Huxley about the origin of life due to the 'action of sunlight on carbon suspended in water, and on the action of natural selection in bringing life to its present stage. F{e will So on to argue that man is sirnply a higher form of monkey, that his art and re- ligions prove nothing to the contr&r|, since they can be accounted for in Freudian ternns. As to what we might call 'Wellsian man', the mechanist will have little diffi- culty demonstrating that he amounts to wishful think- irg. Wells says that he does tlot wish to live unless h.e can devote his life to satisfying an appetite for intensification of consciousne$s - which we have cited as evidence that rnaru possesses a kind of appetite unknown to any animal\" But Wells had gained his position in society his dorninant position through the use of his mind; (he was, of course, born into a working-class background). Ilorniruance is a fundarnental_ animal appetite, al.rnost as !42 fundarnental as the need for food, and Wells is only re- vealing his urge to continue to develop the- i\"rt*rnenr that has gained hirn his dominanr p*iitiorr\" No doubt Carpenter's monkeys also thought thi*t rheir love of offi- experiment showed that it Tvas less deep than tfre need for art established territory.

Anti so, our rnechanist would .orr.lirhe, evolutionary huntanism is no rnore scientific than Shinto- ism or the worship of idols. From the Huxley*Wells position, this is unansueril,bl,e.

The Cancept of Mind, argues briiliantly that alt statements about man can be made without implying rhe cartesian dualism. one of Ryle's chief arguments is that the mind's activities are physi,cal activities that take place in space, like the actions that result frorn them- (if, that h my thinking leads me to action).

Imagination is the k.y word\" The aninnal travels through time head first; its life consists of physical experiences. Nfan has this smange capacity for anticipat- i*g his experience, or even evoking experienc€s .that are never likely to happen to him. Man's discovery of these powers, of the mind is as startling and monaentous as if he lracl suddenly noticed that he possessed wing$. , In , a fiIomeut, he assumes a new status, discovers that he is not in' the least ,what, 'he thought he was, and that nefther fls t.he universe what he took it for. Later on in the individuatr's development, the prob- lems begin to appe'ar. Like Faust, man realizes that knowledg. has_onLy u limited power, and that it may still leave him confined in a narrow and unsatisfying tife; or tre ypy -enthusiastically set sail on the $eas of philosophy, and find himself becalmed in the shallow waJtes of posi- tivism, or sirnply involved in self-contradictions that deftr' disentanglement. But in any case, that early sense of miracle cannot be expected to persist. The nocisphere is not yet man's natural home, and the water behind him exerts a strong gull. The sense of purpose evaporates, and man finds it hard to believe thar it was not an ilLusion. He comes back to the realization that he is axl uncomforrable misfit, that the promise of a nerv kind of existence has not been fulfilled, that he might have been better off without this vision of purpose that has no\\tr becorne his jailer. T. E. Lawrence writes: 'I \" , . lamented pfsg]f rnost when I saw a soldier with a girl, or a man fondling a dog,_ because my wish was to be as superficial. and as perfected, and my jailer held me back.' This is the 'outsider' ' phase, a phase of misery and self-doubt. (Nietzsche analyses it penetratingly in 'The Tree on the Mountainside' in zaratkustra.) This is the period when the 'outsider' cannot afford, t, believe that tife is futile and the universe a vast machine (as Lawrence did). Some kind of belief, some sense of purpose, is an urgent neces- Iity. Evolutigna{y humanism can at leasr *pply the frarnework of this sense of purpose. Fundarnentally, the problem is a problem of con- sciousness, not of mere 'lcnowledgen ('head-knowledge', as D. [{. Lawrence called it).

At bottorn, Freud is tleepl,v pessimistic; man lives in a world of illusiod i; tlrese collapsed, it is difficult to say whether man coulct survive. lt-he idea of 'transhurnanir*' put forward by Sir .[ulian Huxley would have struck Freud as some kind of sublimation. one of the most curious aspects of Freud,s psychology is ttrat he revived vitalism in tris rheory of rh; iiniao as the source of all vital impulse; yer rhe tiUlao, rhe force of .sexual creativity, was a Ltirra impulse to create another generation; it lead no ultimate Evolutionary end. It is completely consistent with his pessimism thar his chief contribution- ro psychology, apuit from rhe libido, is rhe idea of the death wish.

One fbels that the revolt was only half-accornplished in his work. Perhaps the greatest advance in psychology has been the formulation of an 'existential psychology' by Straus, Binswanger, Minkowski, Medard Boss, and others. This is the cloiest that psycholosy has come to an evolutionary theory, for existential psychotrogy recognizes that neurosis is not the result of man's maladjustment to societ), but to' the whole of existence. This at least removes one of the major Freudian heresies: that somehow a 'sociatrly adjusted' man is the ideal that the psycho-therapist should try to produce, and that nothing more can be expected\" It might be said that existential psychology recognizes that for man, the only 'norm' can be creativ- , ity, some form of self-transcendence. Neurosis is due to' a kind of lop-sidedness, like an overloaded car driving with turo, wheels off the ground.

It might be said that the aim of the existential psychologist is to destroy 'forgetfulness of :existence' (since preoccupation in ,a world of illusicms is the same thing as-losing touch with existence).

MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY The late ilIaurice h,Ierleau-Ponry, Flusserl's most irn- portant follower, has also devoted two of his rnost im- portant books to an attack on 'mechanistic psychology,, and so should be considered at this point. outside France, iVtrerle?u.Ponty is sornetimes regaided - wrongly as a disciple of Sartre; in fact, he is fundarnentaltry opposed to Sartre in rejecting the latter's basic idea , of the meaninglessness of the woilcl\" Merleau-Po-nty's^concern for a broadening and deepen- it g of the scientific attitude is as real as-Whiteheid'$, and is the k*y to all, his work. Like r{usserl, he starts from the 'scientific attitude', and attempts to base all his late generaJizations on it. He is unwilling to evoke Bergson:s elan aital or Shaw's life force, st-iltr less the 'evolutionary principle'. His first book, The structure af Behaaiour (rg4e) is a fine example of logical induction; he begins with Pavlovian'behav-iourism'-and \\Aiatsonian reflexolosy (i..,, the idea that the mind is a machine that works on reflexes), and attacks it on its olvn ground, attempting to show that only a gestalt interpretation can account for various phenomena connectad with the brain. This leads to a section in which Merleau-ponry 'atternpts to show that existentialism is a logical exten- sion of ,,the conclusions of the previous section, by dis- ti1$,tshing between three 'ordeis of nature', the physi- cal,. the biological and the human, and showing that alX can be defined in terms of process or behaviour- The !uma3 lgvei i1 therefore as valid a subj,ect for science ,as thE physical.

During the Korean war the Chinese discovered that it was not necessary to expend large numbers of men on guarding prisoners; they merely sub- tracted the five per cent of 'trouble-makers' and placecl them under heavy guard, and left the remaining ninety- five per cent with'dmost no guard at all. And yet there were no attempts on the part of the ninety-five Per cent to escape. The impulse to escape would have come from the other five per c€nt * the men with the will-power, the 'dominant rninority'. Again, it is observable that the comrnunist party in Russia is about five per cent of the total population. It would seem, then, that if biologists ever carried out a series of experiments to establish in- heritance of acquired characteristics, they would do well to pick out the dominant five per cent minority, who would almost certainly be the 'carriers'. Most of the objections to Shaw's Lamarckism seemed to be based on a dislike of his Nietzschean theory of the superman. (This is particularly true of the Eliot-Law- rence generation.) It was a part of the rejection of the nineteenth century ideal of 'Progress'. Now that Sir Julian Huxley's 'transhumanism' has revived the idea of progress on a scientific basis, it is perhaps time to re- examine Shaw's ideas with a less prejudiced eye. , I The Analysis of Man ' THs pRoBLEM then, as Sir Julian Huxley has stated, is \" to redefine man in terms of possibility and limitation. lt might be said that human history has been working to- . wards such a synthesis. Ancient literature - the Greeks, the Old Testament - felt that life is fundamentally tragfC since man is a creature. The early romantics went to the opposite extreme, and decided that man was born for absolute freedom - that man is really a 'god in exile'. They acted on this belief after the manner of a man who lfeels that he should be able to fly like a bird by flapping' his hands, and tests the theory by leaping off the robf. The impact of reality startled them so much that most of them died of despair. But man is neither a creature nor a god; he is somewhere between the two, and his evolution depends on recognizing the precise nature of his limita- tions. fle can occasionally experience the state of mind :in which Van Gogh painted The Starry Night or in which Nijinsky wrote 'I am God'; but nature refuses to allow rnan to live in this state for long. It would destroy his usefulness as the evolutionary spearhead. As Aldous Huxley pointed out in Doors of Perception, a certain limitation of consciousness is necessary if the work of civilization-building is to continue. Let us try tp state this problem as clearly as possible: Man has two possible attitudes towards his experi- . ence: passive and active - the animal and the truly human. If I am deeply asleep and the bedclothes slide ofi the bed, I may grope for the sheet and pull it over me; I shall still be cold, but I do not have to rouse myself from sleep. If I find the cold intolerable, I will wake myself up, switcti on the light and (if necessary) make the bed. These are the two attitudes to all living experience. The ltl F+ t\" [, +t t\\f, r ,. r58 r59"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"active attitude is what Whitehead meant by prehension. ,Now according to.sartre and HeideSEer, the world is rneaningless, so it is dompletely uP to me which udi*t- raent I make; it makes no difierence to anyone but me. Roquentin's experience of nausea (undoubtedly the re- sult of fatigue) is a tendency to be completely passive in the face of the wor[d. 'Nausea' is a recognition of the meaningless 'is-ness' of reality, a confirmation that Roquenlin is right to make no attemPt to impose his will on it. And yet Roquentin's other fundamental experi' ence is a sense of meaning and adventure. Merleau-Ponty accepts this as the more fundamental truth when he writes that man is 'conderrned to meaning'. This would seern to indicate that no matter how alien and meaningless life may aPPear to immediate con- sciousness, man is fully aware of its meaning on some deeper level. It would be, perhaPS, ?. mistake to spea-k' of thiJ deeper level as 'the unconscious mind'. In the Meno, Socraterdemonstrates that a slave contains all the axioms of geometry 'within himself'; and yet it would hardly be true to say that the slave knew them subconsciously, using the word in its Freudian sense. Man is involved with the world on many levels. His beam of consciousness picks out matters for attention as a pocket torch might pick out single objects in a dark cave. An enormous area of his own being is inaccessible to the beam of consciousness. There are moments when he be- comes aware that he contains a'god-like chaos', that he is .potentially an enormous force. These moments are the opposite of 'nausea', for in nausea man feels isolated in an alien world of objects; in the moments of insight, he becomes aware of i connection between himself and nature - that he is capable of a mealringful relationship with nature. Sartre found these two experiences irreconcilable; so they are, on the Cartesian-Hume-ian outlook that Sartre accepts. Nausea is only Hume-ian immediacy-percePtio_n takeh to an absurd limit. But it was Hussetl who teally r6o exploded, Hurte by pointing out that if we are going to obiect to causality on the grounds that it is 'added' by the mind,, then we must obiect to any kinil of perceptian at all, since it is all intentional, all added by the mina. Pure perception - with intentionality inactive - cannot exist (unless, as Merleau-Ponty contends, the kind of per- ception we experience on rhe edge of sleep is pure)- In Nausea, Sartre only went on to illustrate Husserl's refutation of Hume with a parable - but misunderstood the meaning of his own parable, assuming it to be a proof of Hume. The two kinds of perception illustrated are Whitehead's two modes, presentational immediacy and causal efficacy, apd Whitehead had already pre- sented his refutation of rhe book in the passage quoted on page ror) about William Pitt. Nausea is a clear demonstration that the Whitehead-Husserl hypothesis mu$t replace the GalileeDescartes hypothesis; there is no ', alternative. , , To gpryp futly the meaning of rhis, we should nore : that Whitehead distinguishes a rhird mode of experience - conceptual analysis. Man not only possesses meaning perception, tl,.e ability to grasp wholes, causal relation- { ittips, ep; he also poss.m\"\"r tli.. po*er of- gr*pi\"t f; 'i greater 'wholes' by means of his intellect which, through , the_ use of symbols, has a larger storage capacity. Hume ri andSartrerecognizethesetwomodesofexperience,but object that they are unconnected, that immediacy-per- . ception contradi,c,fs conceptual analysis. Whitehead ind Husserl have simply pointed our that there is a third mode of experience which connects the two others. What is clear is that the con_tent of the 'moments of insight' is an evolutionary content, in that it points to further meanings, to 'adventure' (as Sartre calls it) and prompts to action. It is the reverse of Beckett,s .nothing r' to be done'. Man's 'two counsellors', of whom I spoke ai the beginning of this book, are no more than the two advocates of the two modes of perception.

It miglt be said that these twi modes correspond to causal efficacy and p-resenta- tional'ipmediacy.-what has never yet begn understood in the course of Luman history is the relation of the two modes, and the fact that this relation is dynamic and not static, that it can be varied, so to speak, to gain fullest advantage. Romanticism attemPted to disconnect 'im- mediacy; and live in the world of meaning; but in reject- irrg th; world of facts, the romantics only enfeebled thEmselves. They eliminated themselves by natural selec- tion. Man cannot, then, live aontinually in the 'world quivering with me_aning' that Aldous Huxl_ey saw under rirescdini the penalty is too great. But this does not mean that he ir purirunently condemned to a barren world o[ immediacy. There are two clear alternatives, in no waJ mutually self-exclusive. He can develop- the meaning- faculty, which always accompanies immediacy-perception in any case. But he can also, it the intentional nature'of .orrr.iorro.r, is understood strengthen the meaning- faculty with conceptual analysis. The second alterndtive is the'one opened'up by Hussert; it amounts to pheno_- menological analysisind the develop*9rrt of.language. I shalt rpl\"k of this in, a moment. The first alternative is existenltial - that is to say, practical. In order to grasp its irnplications more futly, Et me try to summarize the argument so far. , fne romantics were the first to bring into clear focus the problem of the meaninglessness of life, of man's lack rOe ,i: of an instinct of life-purpose, and of the 'St Neot mrgin' - the fact that man knows what he doesn't want far more strongly than he knows what he does want. Like the creature$ created by Pyg*alion in Bach, to Methuselah, the romantics died protesting: 'I am discouraged. Life is too heavy a burden. I am afraid to live.' And yet they had at least stated the problem: Why does li,fe fail? In the twentieth century, this problem was taken up ag{n by the existentialists, particularly Heidegger and Sartre. Sartre's answer is completely discouraging. The hero of. Altona speaks about 'the basic horror of exist- ence'. Life has no objective meaning; all that stands be- tween man and 'the basic horror' is therefore his own will - and the existentialists are as aware as the roman- tics of the feebleness of the human will unsupported by illusions. Heidegger proposed an alternative - the one also pro- posed by Gurdjiefi. Man may lack a positive purpose, but at least his will can be intensified by contemplating that which he objects to more than anything else - his own death. Thia alternative is certainly efiective Hemingway derives his whole strength from it, and his best work conveys an intense feeling of naked existence. But it is like disciptining a class of lively boys by threaten- ing heavy punishments. It certainly achieves its end - but there is a better way: giving them a sense of pur- pose, giving them something that keepS them so absorbed that they need no external discipline. Sartre and Heidegger would reply: this is undoubt- edly true: but there fs no external purpose that is true for all human beings: only individual purposes that are mostly based on illusions. Blake once said: 'An error must be taken to its ex- treme before it can be combated.' Twentieth century literature has applied itself to the task of taking this error to its limit.

And the more *.r develops this faculty of selecting and-exduding, the further he ietreats from meaning-perception. This is to say\"that the more highly develo-ped the intellect, and the *\"i\"tty for focusing ittention, tfie more the world is sein as rneaningless. It was Husserl who showed the way out of this cul-de- sac. For even while man is working in a world that appears to be meaningless - aware of himself only as a p^ri*ir. consciousness - another level of his being is absorbed in the meaning-a$Pect of ttrc world, and is ' i\"r\"\"*ly active. Brentano- had pointe-d out that all con- sciousness is intentional - whiih only meant, for him, ' ,nut a mental acr is always clearly distinguished from its object. Husserl recognized that it is intentional in a pro- founder sense, that\"the mind is perpetualll engaged in what could be called 'subconscious prehension'. on the level of the cogito, all may be silent, aPParently Purpos€- Iess; but then,-the cogito is a room at the top of a tower. r64 ( ,,i .: A few floors below, man's being is like a factory, full of deafening activity. And unlike'the White Knight,'whose' whiskers were invisible behind a fan, 'intentionality' is not inscrutable. Phenomenology the descriptive analysis of subjective experience - can discern the mean- ings behind this activity. For example, the phenomeno- logical analysis of sex reveals that the origin of the\"sexual impulse is not a blind libido, but the same basic impulse that animates the artist, the saint and the social re- former. The phenomenological analysis of imagination reveals that it is not a faculty for creating 'compensatory realities', but a form of intentionality that involves the use of all three modes of experience - immediacy, mean- ing and conceptual analysis - and as such, is a part of man's machinery of purpose. What is usually called 'mystical experience' is a tem- porary reversal of the usual order of presentational im- mediacy and causal efficacy, without ttre usual weakening of immediacy (that occurs, for example, when 'meaning' is glimpsed on the edge of sleep). But the usual price of these 'mystical' experiences has been the inability to con- vey their essence in language. (Van Gogh succeeds better in painting.) Phenomenology. is a systematic attempt to connect the two realms with language. In the most fundamental sense, I{usserl's phenomenology is a psycho- logy; it is a mistake to think of it merely as a philo- sophical method. An important point should be made'here. I have said that Husserl replaces the Chrtesian dualism with a 'tri- aility', and it might seem that identifying Descartes' cogito with presentational immediacy, and Sntentional- ity' with causal efficacy (or prehension) supports this idea of a triadic structure ip the subject-object relation. This would be to oversimplify. We refer to a'tri-'ality' for the sake of convenience, and because immediacy-perception and rneaning-perception seem to be alien to one another. But it should also be remembered that imagination and conceptual analysis also seem alien to immediacy-per- r6E"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"ception, and if we proceed in this rnanner, wl shalt,soon have hdman consciousness divided into a dozen difierent modes. The truth is that these modes are only difierent aspects of the totality of consciousness in the same way .,that imagination is a combination of. the modes them- selves. Sartre is right in a sense; there is no transcen: dental.. ego; there is only consciousness. But Sartre's cogito,'his'wind blowing towards objects', is only a single aspect of consciousness; its passive top-layer. Merleau- Ponty and Gilbert Ryle are also right in their criticism of the Cartesian subject-object relation. Body is only another aspect of consciousness. It is convenient to think about man as a combination of 'body and mind', but consciousnes$ - or mind - is a constituent of body, an aspect of body-as-consciousness. ffusserl's phenomenology, then, is an investigation of meaning. Husserl himself apparently failed to realize its deepest implications, since he was a scientist and a logician rather than a metaphysician; there is no evid- ence that he was ever awa.re of the problem of 'nausea' or of personal identity. He saw phenomenology as a logical 'analysis of descriptions that might be compared to Socrates's method of making a slave solve a geometrical problem in the Meno. It was merely a question of un- covering 'structures'. But Tolstoy's madman and Sartre's Roquentin presented phenomenology with a kind of ultimatum. Is the sense of meaning, of 'adventure',.to be regarded as an illusion? Even Sartre does not go this far; he leaves the nausea and the sense of 'adventure', as it , were, in silent opposition. If not, if man'is 'condemned to meaning], how far can phenomenology _uncover this meaning? According to biology, the world possesses a 'tendency' to complexification; since man is the highest expression of this tendency, it is reasonable to assume that phenomenological analysis of man should uncover it. It may be said, then, that the ultimate task of pheno- menolo,gy is the study of euolutibnary intenti,onality. (Hlrsserl was undoubtedly developing towards this recog- r66 ion when he spoke of a 'genetic phenomenology' and a nstructive phenomenology'.) , This uncovering of evolutionary intentionality is the answer. to the problem of the 'St Neot margin'; Heideg- B!r's 'death contemplarion' is self-defeating (which can also be- recognized in the work of Heming*ry). A simple example of this uncovering through analysis can -be found in the last act of Back to Methusetah, in the con- versation between Strephon and the maiden who is dis- covering that she has outgrown him. SrRrpnoN: You are maturing, as you call it - I call it ageing - from minute to minute. you are going much further than you did when we began this con- versation. Tnn MaronN: It is not the ageing rhat is so rapid. Ir is the realization of it when it-has-actually hapiened. Now that I have made up my mind ro rh; facl-that I have left childhood behind me, it comes home to me in leaps and bounds with every.word you say. Here the maiden's attempt to explain what has hap- pened to her - to bring it to consciousness - has the efieit of fixing' her new development, making it a basis upon which to act and think in future. But in this case-, it qight be said that the evolution had already taken place; the act of. uncovering it required very liitle self- analysis. Awareness had risen to the surface. The pheno- menological 'uncovering' is the act of going in seirch of the awareness long before it has reached the-surface. The starting point for this uncovering is meaningless- less,- as €xpressed by Sartre or Beckett - or by Wells at the beginning of. Mind at the End, of lts Tether, the sense that man and nature are alien to one another, like' two train lines that have run parallel by accident, and are now diverging. The analysis then proceeds in the manner of a mathematical proof that begins by sa),rng 'Let us assume that the proposition is untrue,, uha ifren de.monstrates that this assumption leads to self-contra- 167"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"dirtion. Whitehead's philosophy; !n fact, began at'this point in The Concept-of Nature, with the problem of the tadicat dislocation\"between mind and nature,* and pro- ceeded through the recognition of the two 'modes of per- ception to t it ultimati 'philosopha of organism' in *ni.u man and nature form part of a single organism. Whitehead's philosophy is evolutionary in a sensg thlt Husserl's is not (although the manner of expression is closer to llegel than to Smuts, for examplg - whose Holism and, Eaolution exPresses similar views). Whitehead's philosophy of organism is difficult to approach throu{h his early bookg (its true starting point is iris criticism of Eirrrt\"in in The Principle ol Relatiu' fty), but there is a passage in Aldous Huxley's Doors ol Pbrception that seems to Present a similar idea: 'Rdflecting on my exPerience, I find myself agreeing with the ehirent 'Cambridge philosopher, Dr C' D' Broad, ..that we should do well to consider much more seriously ... the type of theory which Bergson Put for- ward in connection with memory and sense perception. The suggestion is that the filnction of the brain and nervous-iystem and sense organs is in the main elimina- tiae and not productive. Each Person is at each moment capable of rdmembering all that'has ever happened- to hfii and of perceiving everything that is -happening everywhere in- the universe. The function of the brain and'nervous syst€m is to protect us from bein_g over- ,whelmed and confused by this mass of largely useleSs and irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive or remember at any momcnt, ,and leaving only that very small and special selection which is lfuety to be practically useful.' Accordinq to such a theory, each one of us is potentially Mind at Large. But in so far as we are animals, our business is at alt 6sts ro survive. To make biological survival possible, rnind at I'arge has to be flrnnelled through the'reducing valve of thg brain and nervous system. What comes out * See mry Religion and thc Rebel, Part 2, Chapter 9' r68 at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of con- sciousRess which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this particular planet. To forrnulate and express the contents of this reduced awareness, man has invented .. . languagesr' In this last sentence, it will be seen how close Huxley. comes to the Whitehead of Syralbolism, Its Meaning and Effect. Now it is difficult to see how anyone could suggest seriously that man is at any moment Potentially capable of perceiving everything that is happening in ths uni- verse unless, as Huxley says, man is somehow considered as a fragment of 'Mind at Large' - that is to say, unless we advance a new theory of perception in which each individual is somehow a member of the universe in the way that my fingers and toes are rnembers of my body, and therefore a part of its nervous system. And this is . exactly what Whitehead does suggest in the philosophy of organism: that in some ultimate sense, man and nature are part of the same organism. It is true that this statement has a disturbing resemblance to the Hegelian form of monism that excited such a strong reaction from Kierkegaard. But its idealistic aspect can, for the mo- . ment, be ignored. AU that is really being asserted is that man is in a fundamental sense a dual being, a cogito that functions on immedi,acy-perception and inference, and a deeper self th,at functions on meaning'perception and a, purposiae eaoluti,onary consciousness. A Practical example might m'ake this clearer. In his various books on tiger shooting in India, Jim Corbett frequently mentions that he developed a kind of sixth sense that warned him when the tiger was lying in wait for him; on one occa' sion, he even makes a sketch of his route along a road and across a bridge, showing how he quite unconsciously walked over to the other side of the road before crossing the bridge, and returned to the other side on crossing it; he later discovered that the tiger he was hunring was .waiting for him under the bridge, on the side that he r69"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":",:y *:\" had avoided. The usual explanation for this kind of in- tuition would be that it was 'subconscious observation'. No;w according to Whitehead, it would mean simply that he was exercising his faculty of 'causal efficacy'; Corbett rvas in good health and was 'in tune' with hisrsurround- ings; he was a part of the organisrn that surrounded him. One may, of course, reject Whitehead's philosophy of organism as 'too metaphysical', and involving too many consequences that are not susceptible of scientific veri- fication. But it should be recognized that (a) the philo- sophy of organism is a logical consequence of the White- head-Husserl theory of perception, and that (b) gestalt psychology has provided a certain amount of scientific evidence for the Whitehead-Husserl theory. The mesca- lin experience provided still more evidence in its favour. Some of the implications of this theory could be sum- marized as follows: The sense of 'oneness with the universe', although re- garded by the mystics as the suPreme goal, does not make for evolution. The oriental races have always been more deeply aware of the 'unity of the universe' than the west; but, as Whitehead points out, there is no evidence that China or India would ever have produced a grain of science.,The enormous advances made by western civil- ization in the past few centuries are due to u/estern man's sense of isolation from the rest of the universe, his feeling of alienation - that is to say, to his faculty of immediacy- perception working in close harmony with conceptual 'analysis. But this success has also brought its problems; western man now finds himself in the midst of-a period of crisis. Auden expressed an important aspect of this crisis in the lines: Put the car awali when life fails What's the good of going to Wales? llhe 'failure of life' is a consequence of the new emphasis on immediacy-perception; ,*\", is 'stuck in the present'; r7o- ffi..':.l'il::,...,.;...: ffi: $r he loses the feeling of wider-implicarions; he has a seftl\" ]\" of rootlessness, lack of purpose, insignificance. Science ',,;, assures him that man is a biological accident on a fourth- ,; rate planet; history tells him that 'decadence, is inevit- able, and that our civilization cannot hope to escape the 'r '' fate of a dozen others; literature tells him that neurosis is the lot of twentieth century man, and that defeat in some form or another is inescapable; psychology tells him that culture is only skin-deep, and that undeineath this, the ape-man is waiting to escape. Philosophy is divided into two camps, one of which assures him fhat man's fate is inevitably tragic, rhe other of which declares that even to talk about man's fate is meaningless, since philosophy is mainly misunderstanding due tolanguage. - ' AII this is only ro say thar man is living-in a poisoned i cultural milieu. It would seem common sense tobegin by attacking this aspect of the problem. I have tried tJshow that philosophy has failed because it has always carried within itself the seed of irs own defeat - the cartesian fallacy, the notion of man as a passiae observer of the universe. This meilns that ordinary 'passive conscious- ness' is taken for granted, and that if a;meaning, is to be sought, it must be sought 'out there'. It is true, to some extent, that the meaning is 'out there', as Huxley dis- covered under mescalin; but it cannot be observed by ordinary passive consciousness. To assume that everyday consciousness will be ttie permanent basis of man,i re- lation to existence is as false as would be a child,s a$sumption that the world will look the same to its adult r eyes. Consciousness is aaariable.To some.extent, man is aware of this. The East has always known how to vary it by means of breathing exercises and concentration. fhe methods used by western man are in keeping with his notion of himself, as a passive being; he has developed many forms of relaxation in which he makes the mini- , mum of effort, from the colour television to alcohol and drugs.

And yet it would not be true to say that the pypose of phenomenology is to 'remove the blinkers'. Presenta- iional immediicy is as necessary as 'meaning-PercePtion,. A painter may work close to the canvas or stand back from it as he ieels inclined. The important thing is that he has the choice. At the moment, western man does not have the choice of standing back - or rather, does not realize that he has the choice. Most fundamental of all is the need to study the prob- 'lem, of life-failure and the 'St Neot margin' by the use of the descriptive method. For twentieth century_ man, this problem presents itself in a new form - as Wells noted in ir,ir u,rtobiography. The 'intellectual worker' dislikes the minor problems of everyday life; he wants to-be free to devote himself completely to thinking. Yet although he is quite clear about his impatient rejection of most of the tttirgr that were life to his ancestors, he is not equally sure of himself when it comes to replacing them. A man such as Wells might rage and storm against the time- wasting aspects of running a home and keeping the bills paid; ind- yet left completely to his 'originative intel- iectual worL' he finds his vitality running low; it would not be true to say that boredom creePs in; but the appetite for life ebbs lower. Wells explains thi-s by saying thit men are still half-fish and half-mammal; but this seems to imply that he may have to wait another million years before he is wholly at home in his new element. In fact, this is the very point where phenomenological dis' 'cipline could bring about the desired evolution. The i: pioblem is analogous to the medical prob_l9r-n- of rans- |lanting bodily oigans - replacing disglsed kidneys, etc. The body has a system of defence which causes it to re' ject alien matter - germs, etc - and this defence system t78"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":".,..,;! hec to be put rcmporarily out of action before a-new kidney is put in place of'the old one - otherwise the patient dies. In tLe same way, man's consciousness is focused in a narrow beam on the present, and the life- energies respond to the challenges of the present. When the consciousness is disconnected from the present and turns inward, the energies sink; the world of concepts cannot provide the same stimulus as the world of present reality. (This, of course, accounts for the high mortality rate among the nineteenth century romantics.) Heideg- ger's answer to the problem is the contemplation of death; but I have already pointed out that this is a half- measure. Man must learn to disconnect his consciousness - and therefore his life energies - from presentational immediacy, and discover how to expand or narrow the beam of consciousness at will. The problem is that the intellectu&l - or imaginative - stimulus is usually so much weaker than the stimulus of 'hard fact'. And yet there are certain departments in which the vital energies respond to imagination almost as readily as to reality - sex, for e:rample. There is no reason why they should not be disciplined -to respond to urgency of concepts in the same way. And here again, we face the problem of 'nihil- ism'. If the world is regarded as meaningless, then imagination is only a form of escape, and ideas can only be 'speculations', devoid of urgency. If the idea that man is 'condemned to meaning' is accepted, then ideas be-' come ploughshares, cutting into the soil of the mind, attempting to establish man's direct relation to evolution as a living reality instead of an abstraction. Without powerful intellectual preoccupations - that, is, without ideals - man is the victim of triviality and the 'St Neot m'argin'. In the past, religion played this role (and it is no accident that the sufierings of the cruci- fixion occupied a central place in Christianity - provid- ing, as it were, a standard against which to judge the petty irritations of everyday life). But most of the great religions have been as 'Cartesian' as science; that is, man 174 ls envisaged as a simple consciousness confronting the world and God, fundamentally passive. Science destroyed the notion that there is any point in searching for mean- ''ing 'out there',,and left miri in an apparentiy 'meaning- less universe, with no fundamental value to redeem him from the banality of everyday life. And yet science and philosophy have gradually replaced what'they destroyed, since science has demonstrated the reality of evolution, and phenomenological philosophy has shown that man is not the passive consciousness he assumed himself to be. In fact, although it is not yet fully realized - except by a few men such as Sir Julian Huxley - science has replaced religion with a set of ideals and values that are as pro- found as those of the old 'Cartesian' religion, and asiign man an altogether more responsible role than has been granted to him by any religion with the possible exception of Hinduism. 'It-may be objected that man has known about evolu- tion for a }ong time now, and there is no sign that the idea of evolution can replace the values of Christianity. This is bgcause evolution seems to be an impersonal idea. According to Christianity, every sinner matters to God as much as if he were the only one..Evolution ack- nowledges that the part played by the individual is spimportant - each one is a single grain of sand on a beach. But this is not quite the whole rrurh. Religion has so far been irreplaceable because it enables the individual to participate in a uniquely satisfying way in the sense of a meaningful scheme of things. Science can offer no equivalent to prayer and worship. Science has always objected to 'particularizing' rhe individual; it deals with generalities. When a poet - like Yeats -'wishes to believe in individual destinies, he has to first of all state his fundamental opposition to all science. (When Yeats was youn& his bugbear$ were Tyndall and T. H. Huxley.) In so doing, he placed his intuitions outside the serious con- sideration of science. But this 'bifurcation of nature' r75"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"(into 'scientific truth' and 'artistic truth') was exactly what Whitehead spent his life opposing; his philosophy of organism was an attempt to create a continuum where the opposition would vanish. And if Whitehead's organ- ism and flusserl's phenomenology are to form the basis of a 'new existentialism', this problem must be faced. Art and religion are concerned with the individual. Philo- sophy and science are concerned with generalities. So the very idea of an 'existential philosophy' seems to be a con- tradiction There is only one way to escape this contradiction: to make the idea of evolution the basis of existentialism, to recognize, as Sir Julian Huxley says, that man is on the brink of an evolutionary change that could make him a direct and conscious agent of evolution instead of a grain of sand, a mere part of an immense process. It is impos- sible to recognize the full implications of this notion. Western man has become so accustomed to the idea of his passivity and insignificance that it is difficult to imagine what sort of creature he would be if pheno- menology could uncover his intentional evolutionary structure and make it a part of his consciousness. Re- ligion redeemed man from his.sense of insignificance, but at the cost of making him a mere sleeping partner in the universal scheme, an atom whose only business was obedience to God. Newtbn and the romantics between them destroyed forever the idea of man as a creature; but unfortunately, science could see no way of conceding man the kind of importance he had been allowed by re- ligion. In a way, Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor might be interpreted as an attack on religion from the point of view of science, for'the Grand Inquisitor argues that men do not want the heavy responsibility of fighting for their own salvation and therefore being, in a sense, co- partners in the universal scheme - and that the Church will keep man in his old position as the 'obedient atom', the sleeping partner. And as an existentialist (which he is generally conceded to be) Dostoevsky argues in favour of r76 rfsporrsibility for individuals, and the rejection of the Grand Inquisitor's offer. One problem worried Dos- toevskn and apparently struck him as'insoluble. The G-rand I_nquisitor is quite obviously right; the majority of people do not wanr the responsibility of their own salvation. Where, then, is the place for them in a religion that dedares 'Truth is subjectivity'? Is not one forced to agree with the Grand Inquisitor that men must not be robbed of the religious illusion - and perhaps even with Peter Verkhovenskt in The Deuils that the only really satisfactory society would be a society of mediocrities, in i which men of genius were destroyed as soon as they : showed. ttre first\"rign of individualityl But Dostoevsky was arguing on a naive all-or-nothing basis, unaware that the theory of the dominant minority ' ' is sound biology, and not a disguised form of fascism. , , The proportion of the human race capablq of grasping r' the principle of individual salvation' could-hardly be ,,, more than five per cent. Whitehead writes: 'Religion is [' what a man does with his solitude.' In that sens. of the wor4 the human race has never possessed more than five per cent of religious - or potentially religious in- dividuals What seems probable is that if the human race ever develops its five per c€nr of human beingS who are cap- able of an intuitive grasp of evolutionary intentionality, and a certain control of the 'St Neot margin' by means of phenomenological disciplines, these beings will not ex- perience the need for 'subjective religion' in Kierkegaard,s sense, since the need will already have been fulfilled'on another level. Many of the personal aspects of religion - prayer to a 'personal God' ritual, collective worship - are a',frreans of combating the 'St Neot margin', restoring the equilibrium of _a being that has been attacked by the Tlsg of insignificance (although this is not to argue rhar this is their only value). Phenomenology is the syitematic study of the 'St'Neot margrn', so that tiiis particular need of religion will be fulfilled in another way. r77"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Let me try to be explicit about the basis of this 'new existentialism'. Sartre -summarized the objection to re- ligious values in one word: 'conting€rrc)'r and embodied his objection in a book Nausea. H. G. Wells expressed it in Mind, at the End, of lts Tether as follows: 'He (the writer) has come to believe that the congruence with mind, which man has attributed to the secular process, is not there at all. The secular process (i.e., the workings of nature) is entirely zt one with such non-men(al rhythms as ... the flight of a shower of meteors. The two processes (rnind and nature) have run parallel for what we call Eternity, and now abruptly they swing ofi at a tangent from one another.... Man's mind accepted the *e.rilu process as rational .. . (only) because he was in- volved as part and parcel of it.' This problem forms the basis of the 'nihilism' investigated in The Outsider and subsequent books. Now what is proposed is that mind and nature are not as separate as Wells assumed. Man is not as 'contingent' and accidental as he looks. He has arrived at this conclusion because of an evolutionary peculiarity of western man: the prominence of his faculty of immediacy-perception', and the consequent weakening of his faculty of 'meaning-perception'. This lop- sidedness of western man has made him, up till now, a highly successful evolutionary experiment; but a time has come when it must be consciously recognized and compensated. Otherwise there can be no 'next step' in evolution Biology and zoology have now recognized that evolu- tion is not a mechanical process, like the running down of a clock, but seems to contradict the physical law of running-down. It was Elusserl who, without fully intend: ing it, gave this force a philosophical status by recogniz- ing that philosophy is mistaken to think of man in terms of a contingent consciousness, and by demonstrating that man's 'intentional consciousne$s' , can be a subject of scientific investigation. Man believes he is separate; but he is connected with the 'organism' in ways that are hid- r78 ,flli,, den from the observation of the natural standpoint. ,ml, Wells was mistaken; the two processes are not alien to i one another; their fundamental law is the same: com- . plexification. Writing of mescalin, Huxley said: 'Like , the earth of a hundred year.s ago, our mind still has its {' darkest Africas, its unmapped Borneos and Amazonian , basins. In relation to the fiuna of those regionq we are .'i not yet zoologists, we are mere naturalists and collectors of specimens'. (Thereby denying, of course, Sartre's notion that consciousn€ss : intentionality - man). Phenomeno- ' logy is an attempt to raise man's $tatus from that of the collector to that of the zoologist and cartographer of the ' 'mind's antipodes'. If, as seems probable, the structure of. intentionality proves to be evolutionary (i.e., the 'inten- tion' is complexification, not; as Sartre seems to assume, the static preservation of illusions that make life bear- able), then it can be stated flatly that contingency is an illusion. The old objection to evolutionism -' in ils Shavian or Bergsonian form - was that compared to re- ligion it is an abstraction. A convinced reader might lay \" down Eaolu,tion Criatrice or Man and Superman, arrd . sigh: 'But what am I supposed to do?' An existentialism based upon Whitehead and Husserl is able to answer this question. The basis of the phenomenological method has been laid down by flusserl, whose role in this respect 1 might be compared to that of Newton in science. The , line of development is clear. Phenomenology -. the descriptive analysis of intentional structure$ - must pro-- ceed until it becomes the descriptive analysis of evolu- t tionary intentionality. This would be a fundamental step in the process that Nietzsche called'the revaluation of values' - the changing of the direction of our pessi- mistically-oriented culture by reversing its fundamental ,r: pr€rrises. This is basically what is hinted at in the open- i,,t ing pages of Wells' Experiment in Autobiography. So fan human beings, Iike animals, have relied on the challenge of circumstances to maintain their vital intensity. And as Toynbee points out, when the challenge vanishes the r79"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"'i civilization declines; human beings are incapable of maintaining their intensity without external challenges. And yet it is these challenges that prevent 'the outsider'' from being able to concentrate on inner-development; this is Wells's complaint. What Wells is saying is that, whether we like it or not, we are producing a new type of human being who finds himself stifled by the irrelevancy of everyday necessities - and yet who is not strong enough to do without their stimulus. (The Outsider and Religion and the Rebel attempted to point out that such a being is by no means a new evolutionary type; never- theless, it does seem to be 'true that our civilization is producing them in larger quantities than ever before.) I{ence 'the outsider' finds himself in a curiously painful position, with which his basic human instincts are un- able to cope. He is self-divided because a part of him rejects the irrelevancy of everyday necessity, and the other half is honest enough to recognize that 'the world of the mind' is not a real alternative, since it requires a self-discipline beyond anything that human beings at the moment possess. What is needed, then, is that human be- ings should turn their power of analysis squarely upon this problem of the 'St Neot margin', and recognize that it is as urgent as the problem of the hydrogen bomb. (They are fundamentally identical; the problem of war as the problem of the 'St Neot margin'.) Man's tendency to boredom is a part of the 'natural sfandpoint'; that is to say, it is taken for granted because it has become a habit. But it is not necessary that the 'pre$sure in the mind' should be dependent on outward circumstances. ('When his cafd empties, his head empties too'). This is an un- necessary habit, like a tail or an appendix. What is more, it is a dangerous habit. Whether we like it or not, the next stage of evolution has been entered upon; Newton launched it, and the romantics gave it reality. The romantics found the challenge too much; but it remains, all the same. A new kind of mental strength is required, and a new sense of purpose. r8o The next question, then, is that of the means to this end. A number of solutions have been ofiered during the past forty years, Shaw was one of the first to state clearly that civilization cannot exist without a religion, and he $rent on to suggest that the main features of the ri'orldls 'greatest religions' should be combined - particularly their mythologies. In the final volume of The Stud,y of History, Arnold Tonybee offered a similar suggestion. But it requires very little consideration to recognize that a consciously constructed 'ersatz' religion would not answer the nee{ even if individual religions could be persuaded to 'amalgamate'. Religions are formed from within by a vital impulse, not constructed. Aldous Hux' ley is closer to the reality of the situation in suggesting that mescalin should be made as generally available as alcohol or tobacco - at least he recognizes that the prob lem is to produce a change in western man's mode of consciousness, to develop the perception of causal efficacy. Huxley admitted there were objections: mesca- lin takes longer.to act than alcohol, and tle efiects last Ionger. The effects are also unpredictable: it may pro- duce mystical ecstasy or paranoia. But he apparently overlooked the real objection: the mescalin'taker re- mains 'passive'; it teaches him nothing - certainly not how to reproduce the experience at will. The real prob- lem, the 'St Neot margin', remains untouched. Ultimately, it must be recognized that if the problem is of a change in the mode of cgnsciousness, then it can only be approached through the analytical study of con. sciousnesq that is to say, through phenombnology, the descriptive analysis of subjective states. In the preface to the present volume, I stated that the impetus behind the six books of the 'outsider cycle' was a feeling of frustration: that what was needed Was founda- tion work These six books constitute a re-examination of the foundations of modern phitosophy, and an attempt to provide a basis for firture development. With the r8r ,J"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":",*b present volume, the 'foundation work' is complete; the direction for develoPment is clear. ' It will also be seen why I have drosen to speak of these books as the 'outsider cyile', atthough the word was used extensively only in the first two volumes. After the publication of 'The Outsider, critics objected .ghat.jh: i\"r* was too loose, that almost anyone can be described as an outsider; in short, that it is a matter of degree, not of kind. To some extent, this is true. The kind of distinc- tion between 'outsider' and 'insider' that I had in mind is illustrated by an anecdote of Tolstoy, who saw a brother officer itriting a soldier, and asked him- indig- nanrly if he had nevei read the Gospels. The officer re- tottedt 'ffaven't you read the army regulations?' flere the difierence is ilear: there are two sets of standards due to two ways of seeing the world. But the weakness of this kind of ostensive definition is that people are not usually as sharply defined as this; most of them can syrn- pathize with both points of view. From the preseni volume, it will be seen that the 'out- sider' remaiis a fundamental concePt, in spite of this objection. As a social tyPe, the 'outsider' mul F vague; as -a description of a stale of consciousness definable by phenomenology, it is precise, It is describba Uy Wells in the opening pages of h1s autobiography, and it is, in the sense already explained, a new evolutionary tyPe, confronted by a new problem. This problem defeated most, of the 'outsiders' of the nineteinth century and, if we are to judge by Nau-sea atd Mind, at the End, of lts Tether, is still unsolved. I have suggested that this defeat has t\\tro causes: first, that most of the nineteenth-century'outsiders' were unable to bring the problem fully to consciousness; second, that existintialiim, that has explored the problem more analytically, has been bogged down in its own false premises. The books of the 'outsider cycle' have been an ittempt to exa,mine these Premises, and to suggest--ho$/ ,they iirignt be revised p that existentialism will no r8e longer be involved in a self-contradictory nihilism. What has been suggested is that the answer is to be sought in the idea of evolution, as described by Shaw, Wells or Sir Julian Huxley. The objection is that evolu- -tion is too impersonal'to replace religion, that it can never satisfy the personal need in the same way as Chris- tianity, for example. But is this entirely true? What ulan has lost in religion is something that, by the nature of his evolution, he was bound to lose anyway, the sense of .be- ing- a mere creature whose only business is passive obedience to a master. If this was the price that man paid for his s€nse of 'belongrg' in the worl{ then it was too high. With the collapse of the old religious dogmas, man has gained a kind of fieedom; he has become more adult than his forefathers. It is objected that he has lost the feeling of individual purpose, of being part of a meaningful scheme - in short, the feeling of having a kind of direct telephone line to God in prayerand worship. This, say the objectors, is the thing that science can neYer replace Yet what if science could replace that sense of in- dividual meaning, the feeling of having a direct tele- phone line to the universal purpose? For this is precisely the aim of evolutionary phenomenology: to change man's conception of himself and of the interior forces he has at his command, and ultimately to establish the new evolutionary type, foreshadowed by the loutsiders'. The new element to which these 'amphibians' must learn to adapt themselves is the world of the mind and of ideas - what Teilhard de Chardin calls the 'nodqphere'. This can only be achieved by means of the techniques of pheno- menology. Kierkegaard recognized the basic direction of this evolution when he wrote 'Truth is subjectivity', but the full meaning of this statement only appears when it is viewed in the light of phenomenology. For the romantics, it only meant that truth is relatifi - is in the 'eye of the beholder'. For the phenomenologist, it means that truth is, in a paradoxical sense, both subjective and ,rgB"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"objective. It is 'within', and yet it is not relative; it must be sought by means of science like any law of nature. .The law of man's evolutionary being must be uncovered and brought to consciousness by the same methods that uncovered the laws of the planets. What distinguishes re- ligion from speculative thought is that it is 'lived by'; when the laws of evolutionary intentionality have been uncovered and brought to consciousness, they will also be 'lived by', continually Present to introspection. Des- carte$ wa.$ wrong in believing that man'$ only certain knowledge is: 'I think, therefore I am.' All feeling, as Whitehead pointed out, is absolute knowledge. I{usserl's method of exploring'subjective processes' is therefore the only philosophical method that can claim certainty, the only possible direction of development for a philosophy that can claim to be scientific. If we can also feel the same certainty about evolution - as a Proces$ of corn- plexification - then post-Sartre existentialism has an un- shakeable foundation. Howard Fast has an interesting story called The Fi,rst Men, in which he points out that, in the few known cases where a hum'an child has been stolen by apes or wolves and brought up among them, the intelligence of the child has been permanently impaired.* The condusion he draws is of peculiar interest: if, among human beings, there were a small number who carried the evolutionary germ of a higher type of man; we might also expect this germ to be stifled within the child's first ten years of life. In Mr Fast's story, a number of investigators select a dozen or so of these potential 'men-plus' (by investigat- ing the intelligence quotients of very young children) and bring them up in isolation; the result, as they expect, is the production of a higher evolutionary tyPe. , I mention Mr Fast's story because he summarizes an idea that has been 'floating free' in the cultural atmo- sphere for a long time. (For example, Wells deals with it in a novel called Star Begotten. Tt was also the basis of * Mr Fast tells me that his story was based upon actual cases. r84 my own Outsider.) It is impossible to doubt that man stands at the beginning of a new phase in his develop- ment, and that the germs of this development have been present for at least a hundred and fifty years. But the title of Mr Fast's story shows that he has grasped the mo$t important implication of this idea. When one considers man as he has existed for the past five thousand years - that is, from the dawn of his cultural history - it seems clear that we cannot say that he has yet completed the transformation from animal to 'spiritual' being. Admit- tedly, when we consider what man has achieved through language, imagination and his social sense, the difierence between man and ape is seen to be equivalent to the distance between man and god. The life of an animal is purposeless, tied to physical needs; in comparison, man is part of a great organism of purpose. And yet real purpose is precisely what man lacks. There is a sense of 'some- thing missing'. The Christian religion has always ascribed this imperfection to original sin. But when we consider what is meant by 'original sin', w€ see that it is nothing else than the problem of the 'St Neot margin'. Man dreams of'autonotny, of free will; yet his internal resources are too feeble. We have to describe this curious imperfection in similes. The story of the old woman in the vinegar bottle makes us think of the human situation in terms of a man climbing a glacier, who keeps slipping back to his starting point. This means that, in spite of all he has achieved by way of civilization, man still lacks a cstain fundamentat guality that would distinguish him dearly from the ape. In Heart of Darkness, Conrad shows how the lack of this quality can lead to a reVersion to the animal level. Professor Erwin Schpddinger, in an essay called What is Li,fe?, has pointed out that the workings of living matter cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics; there is, as it were, a radical break between a machine and a living organism. The living organism possesses various qualities that can be sutnmarized in the word r8b"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"'autonomy'. There is no gradual shading of machine into animal; there is an absolute break. And ]et in another sense, the animal is still largely a machinq its Purposes can all be defined in terms of simple physicbl needs. Be- tween the ape and man, there would seem to be another tabsolute bieak', although, again, ape and man have much in common. Yet in man, the word 'autonomy' has quite a different sense. The machine -ii dependent en- tirely on its operator; the animal is. dependent on the stimuli of its environment; rnan inhabits yet another world, the noiisphere, the world of mind. When we have said this, we tealize that, in terms of these 'absolute breaks', the transition from aPe to man is still incomplete. Man cannot yet be said to 'inhabit the world of mind'. He has learned to swim in the new ele- ment, but he is not yet at home in it. (This, of course, is to reverse Wells's simile of the amphibian') He objects to his old element, and yet has not the strength to make a complete transfer to the new one. He is not yet a 'spiritual being', for spiritual, in its ultimate sense, rntans capable of exercising freedom, and freedom is meaningless without ultimate purPose. For thousands of years, religion has supplied this spiritual need for pur- pose; yet this was not true PurPose, for it depended on illusions - upon man's picture of himself as a passive creature. Religious man was also incomplete; he was walking on crutches. The crutches have now been taken away. It is impossible to evade the implication. The one thing that is required to complete the transition from ape io man is the birth of a new kind of purPose insiile man. Sir Julian Huxley is right in calling this sense of eVolutionary purpose a 'new religion'. He writes I 'Finally, the evolutionary vision is enabling us to discern, howevir incompletely, the lineaments of the new religion that we can be sure will arise to serve the needs of the coming era. Just as stomachs are bodily organ! concerned with digestion, and involving the bioctremical activity of special juices, so are religions psychological organs con- r86 .\\: cerned with the probleFns of human destiny,'and invofv- ing the emotion bf sacredness and the sense of right and wtong.'* Alf this can be summarized in a single statement: there is no point in talking about the superman, because rnan does not yet exist. Sir Julian Huxley has declared that he considers that animal evolution and human evolution are separated by a 'critical point', after which the nature of the material undergoes radical changes (presumably in the way that the nature of the 'biological material' difiers from inorganic matter). The next im- portant recognition is that even beyond this critical point, the change is not yet complete. One might say loosely that biological matter difters from inorganic matter in that it has a dimension of freedom - that is to say, as a plane difters from a straight line. We should be able to say that the human material difiers from bio- logical material as a cube. differs from a plane - in hav- ing yet another dimension of freedom. And yet we cannot yet, say this, for much of the human material still belongs to the animal sphgre of Sartre's cafd proprietor. There does exist human material in which the change has started to take place; but it is not yet completed. Fast calls such material 'man-plus' (or perhaps 'potential man- plus'); in Star Begotten, Wells speaks of 'Martians'; in the first two volumes of the present cycle, I preferred the term'outsider'. Let us cast a summarizing glance back over the whole problem, and try to reduce it to its simplest terms. Idealism - belief in man's future - is fundamentally a belief that thought can make man the master of life. But the romantics soon became disenchanted with this idea when they discovered th:at a clever man is not necessarily a free man - that man seems to be held by invisible nets. Hence the despair of Faust, Schiller's Karl Moor, etc. *_Mul Without God The Obsenter Weekend, Reaiew, September grd, 196r. ,{?"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":", Now for modern pan, the deepest of his psychological problems is his feeling of unimportance,\" of being acci- dental - contingent. Western man sufiers particularly from this sense of contingency because of the strength of his faculty of immediacy-perception', which keeps him finnly jammed in the present, and will allow him very lirtle access to his o\\,vn past, or to the sense of mean- ing. (This applies far less to Eastern races, and - apPar- ently - to Celts.) Science, which owes its development to this peculiarity of the western mind is an attempt to see the world in terms of immediacy, and'-to reduce meaning to im- mediacy. (If the mind can grasp meanings intuitively, it can see no need for science.) Science is, so to speak, a blind man's method of de- scribing the world. Compared to the East, western man is blind-blinkered by immediacy-perception. And yet this blindness has given the west a certain superiority over the east, for it has led western man to develop a system of tabelling his ideas and perceptions (which might be com- pared to a kind of Braille). : fn the days when Christianity was the universal re- Iigion in the 'West, this lack of meaning-PercePtion did not matter greatly; Christianity ofiered meaning. But when science undermined Christianitn western man found himself in his present uncomfortable position * without a religion, and without an intuitive sense of meaning. His temperament now confirrned the cQn- clusions reached by his science: that man is an accideht in a purposeless universe. There are various ways in which a man can intensify his sense of meaning - of causal efficacy. The simplest is through work, since work involves a Practical succession of cause and efiect. The same is true of garnes. Listening to (or reading) stories is almost as universal, since a story compresses many events into a brief sPace of time, and ugai\" produces. a sense of meaningful cause and efiect. r88 Other.arts seem.to evbke meaning in a more sophistiiated way - music for example - but the basic principle is the $arre. Then there are more direct physical means - alcb- hol and drugs. These have the effect of temporarily in- tensifying the vitality, fortifying consciousness against the pressure of the world. The same is true of''sexual ex- citement. For Proust, a piece of cake dipped in tea made him cease to feel 'mediocre, accidentil and mortal'. Finally, there are the so-called 'mystical experiences', which rnay be due to many causes, but which seem in- variably to produce this sense of universal meaning. I say 'so'called mystical experiences' because they are not really of a different order from the experiences men- tioned above. The main difierencq is that they are usually more intense, and so their meaning is more diffi- cult to describe. But William James agreed that alcohol produces the mystical experience to some extent; drugs like mescalin certainly do. In all these 'meaning experiences', meaning is ex- perienced as being out there, in the world; nausea, the sense of futility is recognized to be an illusion, or rather an error due to our.'worm's-eye' perspective on the uni- verse. Western manls problem is that his meaning experiences are too brief and too difficult to hold on to. For western man, then, the central problem is not any abstract question of the scope and limits of philosophy or the decay of religiorf: it is the problem of contingency. What he lacks is certainty, confidence, sense of purpose. But even if he has no intuition of meaning - because of his overdeveloped faculty of immediacy-perception - he has the power to grasp meanings intellectually - which is eventually preferable to the purely intuitive approach, since meanings grasped by intuition are too easily lost. [f he had more access to his own past, to meniory his sense of purpose would be immensely augmented. f{esse's Steppenwolf expressed this sense of meaning due to re- possession of the prut: r89"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":".. . For moments together my heart stood still between delight and sorrow to find how rich wai the gallery of my life, and how thronged the soul of the wretched Steppenwolf with high eternal stars and constella- tions.... The kernel of this life of mine was noble. It came of high descent and turned, not on trifles, but on the stars.... Proust's Recherche is also a determined attempt to gain access to the past. We may feel that Proust's past was hardly worth all that trouble, and that his self-pity invalidated most of what he had to say; but the book remains a monument of evolutionary humanism because Proust dearly recognized that matt rnusf have such access to his past if he is to become truly human. ff Proust's attempt had been successful, and he had demonstrated that man can regain his past by a long intellectual disci- pline, the major problem of Bodern man would be solved. He would have achieved sense of purpose without ,sacrificing the increased immediacy-perception that is western man's chief distinction. It has been argued that Proust's aim could have been more efiectively achieved by drugs (LSD or lysergic aci4 for example) but this point has already been dealt with; drugs operate at the expense of immediacy-perception. Nevertheless, the use of drugs in controlled experiments could furnish valuable data; after Aldous Huxley's Doors of Perception, this is impossible to doubt. This road is by no means a blind alley. Now it must be admitted that evolutionary humanism cannot provide the sense of contingency, of purpose, that was once provided by Christianity, since it will not allow man the comfort of thinking of himself as a creature who can be justified through faith. It demands a sense of autonomy and purpose, which can only be achieved through certain disciplines. But here the chief barrier is of language. Science is nothing less than this ability to fix meanings in words and symbols, so that the symbols can r90 be made to do the work.,Unfortunately, we have only the most rudimentary symbols for 'describing our psycho- lgqrgal 6tates, so that the efforts of a Proust or a Sieppen- wolf are doomed in advance. Language can only Ue ae- veloped through the expansion of a fixed co-ordinate sys- tem of general ideas. (I shall speak further of this in the . final chapter.) In the meantime, evolutionary humanism provides the basic outline of a creed whose evolution (and complexification) is bound up with the use of the phenomenological me rhod. What is most important for man in the twentieth century is that his creed should recognize the possibility of evolution. So far, phenomenology has been made thi instrument of the anti-evolutionary philosophy of Sartre a_nd Heidegger. In such works as The Undying Fire, The Croquet Player and Experiment in Autobiography, Wells revealed that he was as profoundly concernea wiitr arl existenz-philosophie as Sartre, but compared to the author of L'Imaginaire and L'Etre it li Niant, he seemed hopelessly unmerhodical. It has been my purpose to show that,'unmethodical or not, Wells's fundirrtehtal intuitions were sounder than Sartre's, and that they pro- vide a basis for an existentialism that can transceird self- contradictions. Such an existentialism could fulfil Hus- serl's prediction that phenomenology would become the basis of a universal science. A NOTE'ON THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN SEXUALITY The evolutionist picture of the universe of Huxley and Teilhard de chardin has some interesting implications for sexual psychology. The animal has no [o*.i ro tran- scend its environment and view it objectivety; the human level is clearly distinguished from the animal level by its use of language and of imagination. One of the most difficult problems for all writers on the psychology of sex has been how to define 'normality,; r9r"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"All sexual 'perversion' seems_ to be the result of the misuse of iriagination, the clash between imagination and reality.

The stoical pessimism of Sei,n und Zeit, Altona or La Chute seems to indicate a limit, a closing period. In the present book, I have attempted to establish a new set of foundations for existentialism. In this aim I have, I believe, ^been successful. What Husserl called the 'transcendental ego' is the drive to complexi- fication. Evolution is the 'hidden achievement of the transcendental ego'. But the problem of proceeding be- yond this point still remains - even though this problem is, by nature, completely difierent from the one we have been considering. In this final chapter I shall attemPt to offer some indications - necessarily perfunctory - of the way in which a strictly phenomenological existentialism might develop. I have already said that the fundamental objection to 'evolutionism' as a religion is that it is incapable of 'spe'aking to the condition' of the ordinary human being. A man who contemplated suicide would hardly be dis- suaded by Teilhard's Phenomenon of Man or Huxley's New Bottles lor New Wine. The idea of evolution is too impersonal; it lacks the power of any of the great re- Iigions to 'speak directly'. It might seem that religion and evolution are opposed in a way so fundamental that it is impossible that they should be reconciled. Religion is based upon what Ardrey calls 'the fallacy of central position', the idea of the individual that he is somehow the centre of the uni- verse, an immortal soul whose salvation or damnation 'are of importance to God himself. Evolution demolished this notion: man was not specially created; he is funda- mentally an animal like other animals, even if of .\"a higher type. This change of emphasis, it seems, consti- tutes the basic difference between religion and science. And yet this is not entirely accura6. It is true that the . *\"1. primitive religions regarded man purely as a creaturei yet the lighel religions - like Hinduism and Christianity 1 already hold it as a basic tenet thar 'the kingdom of 1pod is within you'. This is immediarely a shifi of ern- phasis from 'God outside' to 'God inside'. Many nine- - teenth century scientists and thinkers held a view that might be called 'primitive evolutionism', in which man was a mere creature of evolution, a twig carried along in the great strearn. The new evolutionism - as held- by Shaw, Huxley and Teilhard - recognizes evolution as an in-ternal principle, not a by-producr of the running-down of nature. Now it might be said that all the disciples pre- scri-ped by the saints and fathers of the church - mystical and otherwise * were means of bringing the 'God within, nearer to the surface, uncovering the 'atman,, as it were, FI , species of excavation. fn fact, one has to read very little of Boehme, Eckhart, De Sales, Scupoli, to recognize that what these men are practising, within a frame*ork ) of Christian dogmas, is a primitive phenomenology.

(Faber dv Faber.) Eliot's work'provides an in- teresting proof of the fundamental similarity of aim of phenomenology and religious introspection. By considering the writings of Boehme - or Eliot - it can be seen that to speak of phenomenology is to speak of the limitation of language in describing man's inner processes. Aldous Huxley underlines the nature of the problem in using a geographical metaphor to describe the mind; 'we have no adequate maps to describe this terri- tory'. Brentano observed: 'It is a sign of the immature 'state in which psychology finds itself that one can scarcely utter a single sentence about mental phenomena which would not be disputed by many.' This was written of pre-Freudian psychology; and yet, in many ways, Freud made the situation worse by shifting the emphasis from phenomenology to practical results, and allowing some of his personal prejudiges to masquerade as theory. Psychology is still in an immature state, and the first necessity is the systematic creation of new concepts and language from descriptive analysis.

A positive existentialism should begin from an aware- r96 ness of the ,limitations of our langirage. lVe atre acclls- tomed to think of ourselves as knowing too much, of'hav- ing developed technical and scientific resources that are far in excess of our everyday needs. It would be healthier to recognize that, as far as communication goes, we are as primitive as aborigines. Our language at pr€s- ent is little better than a primitive sign langu.age A farmer could describe precisely how he would set about developing a tract of rough land. Can the pheno- menologist describe how he proposes to develop lan- guage? In the Philosophical Inaestigations (Part r, pa.ra. r2) Wittgenstein makes a good beginning. If we look into the cabin of 'a locomotive, we see all kinds of handles; but they serv€ quite different functions, and operate in different ways. One is intended to be pulled, others to be pressed down, ahother to be wound in circles, another to b-e pumped back and forth. Wittgenstein goes on to say that when we say 'Every word in language signifies some- thing', we have said nothing whateaer. Words are of as many different types as rhe handles in rhe cabin of the locomotive; at present, we have no system of ,classifying them as a lepidopterist classifies butterflies. Consider the first example I have given above, flow would you describe the difference between the taste of an orange and that of a tangerine? One's first reaction is: 'Impossible.' But is it any more impossible th,an describ- ing the difterence between a Chinese and a Hottentot to a class of school children? It is necessary to rely on a cer- tain comrnon ground, between the teacher and the chil- dren. No language is 'absolute'; it always depends on comparing something to something else. The development of language parallels exactly the de- velopment of counting by ordinal numbers. Each unit is grven a name; the seventh unit is called seven. To cer- tain primitives, this system would seem as remote from gveryday life as opening a bank account or taking out a life insurance policy.

And yet all thought has-developed by this 'antici- patory labour' - analogous to. taking out_ an insurance poticy to couer a thousand euentualities that may neuer brrur. If, for example, we wish to use language to de- Scribe the difference between an orange and a tangerine, it would be necessary fot some scientist to work on a catalogue of smells, including every known -smell and combiiation of smells, to understand the relations be' tween smells in the way that we understand the relation between the colours of the spectrum and the vibration that produces them, and to give all these smells names, numbers or descriptions. (If it ever became necessary to the progress of slience, such a 'sy,stem' could be de- veloped -in a year .or less.) It would eventually become r,ecr^srr\"y for every schoolchild to learn this catalogue and associate each name with its smell in the way that he learns FrenCh or algebra. This would be 'extension of language'. Wittgenstein draws attention to another of the in- adequaiies of language when he asks 'What is a Sarne?' Wit[genstein answered that there is no simple definition of a-game, for poker, football, patience, cowboys and Indians and the game a cat plays with a mouse have no common element; instead, Wittgenstein says, there is a 'network of relationships'. And yet it might be objected that this .is one of the c?ses (there are many in Phi'lo' sophical Inaestigations) where Wittgenstein's lack of ph\".ro*.nologicil training produces difficulties that do not really 'exist. All games have one thing in common: their relationship to reality, which might be called a 're- hearsal relation'. But even this hint of a definition re- veals the limitations of language. The reason that the word 'gr{tt.' is so difficult to define is because it has no stable underpinning of accepted ideas. We can see that the Olympic-Games of 1936 had a certain 'rehearsal' re- r98 lation to the Nazi attemPt at world domination, but what is meant here by the difierence between 'sport' and :realiiy'? Is it what is meant by the difference between dre'am and reality? Or phenomenon and reality (noumenon)? Plainly not; in each case, the word 'reality' has a different meaning. Most of Wittgenstein's work after ttre Tractatus Logico- Phitosophicus is concerned to make his readers aware o-f the nature of language, to destroy the 'natural stand- point' in which language is accepted as a comprehensive descriptive system of reality. Language is not one thing; it could better be described as a net$rork of language galnes, having as little in common as the games men- iioned above, but connected by u network of relation- ships. it wiU at once be seen that Wittgenstein's aim and llusserl's were identical, although their methods of approach wer€ difterent. Wittgenstein felt that most Post- iirteuirn philosophy is a muddle of misunderstandings' due to inadequate definitions; his aim, he said, was to train his readers to see disguised nonsense as Patent non- sense. F{usserl's approach was constructive; Wittgen- stein's tended to be destructive; nevertheless, both rryere concerned with foundation work, with the prolegomena to philosophy. ttr. *.tnba or extension suggested above might be called 'the frame method'. Imagine a large square frame, subdivided into hundreds of smaller squaxes. The scien- tist who was trying to exPand our language of smells would take a frame, and set out all the known smells in each of the squares, givlng each a name. As he discovered the secret of the inter-relationship between the smells .- analogous to that between colours and atomic vibrations - the order of the smells within the frame would be altered. It would also become possible to postulate new smells, and to name them in advance, rather as the atomic chart enabled scientists to Postulate elernents and describe their properties before they were isolated in @1r:.y:,.'tl::v.!)\":t:1.:::,:t,y.r:i.in' i.tty::.\",:t:,:1,..:Jt:::;r:.tt|i, r99"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"nature.* It is remotely possible, for example, that some such organization of smeil-words, colour words, etc, might one day reveal an interesting parallel between orange and tangerine, and the difference between, say, sea-green and grass-green. The frame method, then, could be used for the ex- tension of various departments of language; to begin with, the 'smell frame' would be mostly empty squares; the aim would be to fill it up, but the existence of the empty squares would be like an insurance policy, a cal- culation involving the future. The third question the description of subjective states - is a matter for phenomenological analysis. The data are 'internal'; therefore a 'frame' is of no immediate value; the relationship between the data will be dynamic rather than static, and determine its own frame. The problem here is analogous to the engineer's problem of resolving a complex force into its constituents - a kind of psychological vector analysis. We know, for example, that the kind of will that enables us to move the fingers is quite different from the kind that enables us to perform the operation of defecating, and that both these types of will are difierent from the kind that controls digestion. The will that enables us to make simple bodily move- ment$ could be called 'direct'; it is as simple in its action as turning a handle to oPen a door, The other kinds are more complex, involving relaxation as well as the act of volition. Sornetimes, these more complex forms of will seem to operate by the law of reversed effort; a man * An interesting example of what I mean can be found in Thomas Mann's nouella, The Black Swan. Out for an afternoon walk, two rromen smell an odour of musk. They discover that this comes from a small dead creature covered with blowflies, mixed with rotting vegetation and excreta; the mixture of smells produces the smell of musk..James Joyce observes in Illysses the urine smell of fried kidneys\"ana td\" \"feety smell' of gorgonzola cheese; and yet no one doubts that we would be revolted by a piece of cheese that tasted of urine or a kidney that tasted of unwashed feet.

It fs pos- sible to prevent oneself from being sick by an acr of witl; but it is a complex act, and so far we have no means of describing its constituerits. There are even more complex- reaches of the will mechanism; hysteria can produce curious psychosomatic effects; many people who are rlot necessarily saints can produce stigmata effects like thoSe of St Francis; fakirs can drive nails through their hands without bleeding, and temporarily stop the movement of the heart. Even the simple act of trying to remember a name or a tune is beyond the present scope of pheno- menology; again, it seems to work, to some extent, by the Iaw of reversed efiort. ' Expressed in this manner, it might seem that the task \" of descriptive analysis is hopeless; but this is only an appearance. Once the main lines are laid down, the analysis becomes simpler. It is necessary, for example, to bear in mind the distinction between inorganic material, biological material and human material. The statemehr that these can be compared respectively to a straight line, a plane and a cube indicates that the 'vector analysis' applies here. The peculiar attribute of human material is its third dimension of freedom - even though, as already observed, this dimension is 'incomplete'. This dimension complicates the whole problem of will and the 'St Neot margrn' - turns it, as it-were, into a complex variable. We can see the rvay in which this 'third dimen- sion' complicates the issue in the case of sex. Anirnal sexuality is a physical matter, dependent upon certain a-ppetites and energies, and upon the smell of oestrum. If an animal is tired, and theie is no physical stimulus, then sex is unthinkable.

What Wells is saying is that man - or rather, men such as himself - have trans- ferred their hopes and ambitions to a new level of their being, the levef of intellectual evolution.- (I_ here use 'in- te[eEiual' in its fullest sense to mean all the activity of the human spirit.) The position is strange and uncom- fortable, for unless the mental component possesses great power - the kind of power that can be given only by h..p conviction - it ii no g,enuine counterweight to- the negative stirnuli of physicil existence (and the _positive stiiruti - physical pleaiures - have lost the absoluteness 2o2 , that they possess for animals.) In the ages of religion, this kind of deep conviction was possible; today this is no longer true (at least, not for minds such as Wells's). It would seem that man's own mind, without the support of religion, is incapable of raisiqg its sense of purpose_like. a ,' cathedral spire. The nineteenth century bears ample wit- ness to this; a creator like Wagner, for example, at' tempted to create a secular counterPart of religious conviction - and almost succeeded but ended by bartering his humanist ideal for Christian abnegation. And yet when we consider the problem as Presented by Wells, new ground for hope emerges. Wells is saying that his desire to live depends on the evolution of his intel- lectual consciousness. We observe that the Power of this ,conviction is less great than the Power of negative i stirnuli. And yet, as Wells points out, it is only in the past hundred years or so that one could say to a man tes, you live and work, etc, but what do you do?' It is true that there have'always been men who have instinc- tively recognized that man should have a new dimension . of freedom, and who have rejected 'the world' in the name of this freedom. But in the past, the saints have been rarities; since the beginning of the nineteenth century, this tendency to 'world-rejection' has become a comrnonplace. As we have seen, the urge to intellectual evolution in the romantics was often frustrated by the confused nature of their reasoning and the failure of their language. Today, this is ceasing to be true. If the culture of our time can throw off its nineteenth century Iegacy of defeat, there is no reason why it should not cease to be true altogether. We can now see that the : whole process of becoming human ('hominization', Teil- hard calls it) is the deaelopment of a conscious d,imen- si,on of eaolutionary purposs. The 'outsiders' - such men as Van Gogh and T. E.

So on the rSth of Jrly, at half Past ten in the mo*iog, I took abou't a quarter of a gram of- mescalin sulphate dissolved in water. (It tasted rather like Epsom salis.) Aldous Huxley mentioned that he had taken four- tenths of a gram - just under a half - but I wanted to be on the safe side, in case the effects were unpleasant. (I had been tol4 however, that it was safe to take uP \"to a gram) - Huxley mentions that within half an hour, he became aware of''a slow dance of golden lights' then swelling red surfaces - then saw 'reality' far rnore vividly. I read quietly, determined not to anticiPate the -effects_by e1- c-itement; but an hour later, there were still no efiects of any kind. I had had a very light breakfast, and suspected that perhaps the mescalin was taking longer to work for this ieason. I therefore decided to take another quarter gram. I took this at about midday- Half an hour later, ihere were still no distinct effects, although by now I was beginning to feel very slightly unwell - feverish, as if I had a b-ad head cold. Finding the house intolerably stufiy, I decided to walk down to the beach. On the way-, I noticed that the 'head-cold' efiect had intensified; 'real- ity' was further away, as when one has a slight fever. I was also reminded of my first exPeriences of drinking spirits. Twenty minutes later, on my way back home, I realized I was feeling distinctly ill, and found myself zo6 wishing that I had not walked so far. An acquaintante stopped me to talk, and I found that I could barely finish ihe conversation. On my way back along the lane that leads to our house, I had the impression that my sense of smell was far keener. The scent of various flowers in the hedgerow seemed stiflingly strong. My sense of smell has always been strong - ? c€rt?in smell will bring back a scene from the past with which it is associated far more ;v,rvidly than a sound or sight. But in this case, it may h?v€ been only that the feeling of physical illness made me more sensitive to smells. When I carne into the kitchen and found *y wife making coffee, I had to hurry into anot}rer room of the house. . I decided to make myself sick. This wa$ not difficult. A srnall quantity of the mescalin came up - I could tell it by its taste. But I was aware that the rest of the mescalin was already working in my system. I felt as if I was trembling slightly - although I was not - and had a feel- ing of something,working in my blood - the feeling trr'at alcohol produces, but less pleasant. I felt as if I had been poisoned. I decided to lie down on the bed and try to sleep it off. This was difficult, since I felt so sick. I'can remember thinking repeatedly 'Oh God, I'll never touch this filthy stuff again', and feeling relieved that I had not been tempted to take the whole gram. For about an hour it was a question of trying to lessen the sickness by a form of mental persuasion, as one tries to prevent oneself from being physically sick. I also tried making myself sick several times nx)r€, but with little efiect. My wife brought me a cup of glucose dissolved 'ie water, since Huxley had mentioned that the efiect of mescalin is due to sugar sta.rvation o{ the brain. I did not expect this to work, and I am $ure it didn't. Finally, I managed to fall into a light doze for a few pinutes - this would probably be towards half past one or two. When,I woke up, I found ttrat the sickness was subsiding, leaving me feeling extremely weak. I got up 2o,7"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"and walked about. There were still no visual efiects of any kind - certainly none of the kind described by f,Iux- l\"y - although it seemed to me that there was a strangely .prismatic play of colours on a varnished door. flowever, i later discovered that this is so even when one has not taken mescalin. I now realized that the mescalin was finally having a positive efiect - well over four hours after taking the first ios\". My body was feeling the gratitude that it normally experiences after having been physically lick - the feel- i\"S of recuperating. I noticed that this feeling of pliasure was stronger than the usual relief after vomit- - irg. As I concentrited on it, it became a well defined rhythm, a kind of wave motion, that seemed to start at my brain and travel all the way down TI b9dy, as -a hand might stroke a cat, or as a raft might be gently rocked up and down on the sea. I am not sure whether becominf aware of it intensified it, or whether perhaps a negative attitude on my Part had prevented me from feeling it much earlier - a resistance to it. My sleep seemed to have placed me in a reccptive frame of mind, as unresisting as a baby; consequently the effects became stronger. I soon realized that I felt as if something outsi,de was trying to communicate with me. This was not an un- pleasint sensation, but not pleasant either. I recalled Robert Hichens's $tory How Loae Came to Professor Guildea, about a kind of idiot ghost,' a mindless ele- mental, that falls in love with a professor and plagues him with constant attention. I felt rather like the pro- fessor in the story. This part of the experience is difficult to desc'ribe without conveying the wrong impression. There was no sense of something outside my bod,y trying to communi- cate. This was entirely a 'feeling'. Moreover, it mani- fested itself as a warrnth and benevolence, a sense of innocence and trust. Huxley speaks about Adam on the dawn of creation; certainly this feeling was like the trust eoB it., tt at one experiences as a baby, a sense of mottrcr'love, 4- I :'.completely -uncomplex innocence. When 'I consciOusly turntd sry thoughls towards innocence - for example, my eye feII on a volume about Marilyn Momoe on my Udotittetf - I had a sudden feeling of recognition: 'Yes, that's it.' It seemed that the innocence of which I was so intensely aware was the innocence that I had so often instinctively recognized in people in Miss Monroe (whom I had met on a couple of occasio\"t): B my three- year-old daughter, in perhaps a dozen people in a1l (most of them women or girls). i In speaking of the 'mystical experience', Huxley h31 .laid a gr.u, deal of emphasis on the idea of the 'not-self' us opposed to the 'self',bf the freedom from the prison of persbnality, of the way that 'personality' usually em- , Lodies the evil and selfishness in people, the Petty 'self- hood'. Now I felt most strongly that he wa$ w-rong,'that there is an element of Manicheeism in Huxley, a ten- dency to reject the world as evil (which olce led'me to borrow one of Huxley's characters - Mr Propter - and transfer him to a novel of my own, merely to contradict this idea). This has ted him to aL equally simple equation of selfhood with evil. Now I was intensely cer-- tain that he was wrong. Although this sense of love and innocence was delightful, it was too innocent. I found myself fighting aguittst it - not as Huxley says, because the Old Adam was putting uP a hard fight against grace - but because selfhood is a precise insuument for a cer- tain purpose, and this feeling was blunting the insru' ment. I iound myself thinking about Peter Kiirten the Diisseldorf sadist,'or of Strafien, the child-murderer, and i, recognizing that adult minds 'are intended to be the ,, poliiemen-of the universe. My daughter came into the bedroom and confirmed this feeling; her afiection ex- pressed precisely the same kind of thing that I was teeling inwardly; yet lying there, feeling physically en' feebled overwhelmed by this sense of universal love and trust, I recognized that I was in the wrong position in 2o,9"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"relation to my daughter -,that the job of the adult is protection and care. And the ,job of all responsible human beings is the same protection and care towards the universe. For this, one needs, as a preliminary stgp, to insulate oneself against this universallove. Having tiken this step of insulation - the first step towards adulthood - all crime becomes possible, if one does not operate upon a kind of ingrained confidence that the univerqp means well by one. Even lapped in this sense of universal love and innocence, I could not find it in myself to con- demn Ktirten completely, aware as I was that, \\aving taken the first step towards 'adulthood', he had hhd no reason to feel that 'the universe meant well by him'. (Kiirten's upbringing was extremely brutal and miser- able.) I should note that there was a slight erotic component in this sense of innocence, buL nothing strong enough to be called sexual excitement. In any. case, the sense of physical enfeeblement was so strong that sexual excite- ment would have been impossible. By this time, I was feeling well enough to sit up and drink, a cup of coffee; I also felt hungry and suggested $omething to eat. But when my wife brought me a Iamb chop, I found it impossible to'eat more than a mouthful. It would have been as difficult as to eat human flesh\" Again, I felt overwhelmed by the cruelty of human be- ings. I am not a vegetarian, although I am inclined to feel that I should be. But if I took mescalin regul'arly, I am sure that I would have no alternative. I could no more eat a lamb chop than I could have strangled the lamb with my bare hands and eaten it raw. A friend who took mescalin told me that shc had a sensation of descending'into the cellars of her mind' arrd becoming aware of all kinds of depths and of mental proce$ses and feelings of which she was normally un aware. My own experience could be described in the same way. I felt like a radio without a VHF att'achment, so that alt kinds of stations were interfering at the same 2ro r,,fime. The capacity to will, which depends on clarity of 1'purpose, was'strongly diminished. ' I'b\"lieve this expiains my body's strong resistance to , mescalin, and the ieason that I felt i11 for so long. My r owr mind has a strong 'vHF_attachment\" a mechanism ' fo, allowing me to foc,rs all my -attention on what absorbs me -rt the moment, and exclude all other ideas and feelings; rhis has been developed by a long process of mainly un-conscious discipline. Mescalin temporarily put this attachment out of aclion, and I realized instinctively that this was something I did not want. (O, re-reading Huxley's Doors of Peiception on the evening -bgfor.e taking' r-nescalin, I- remember feeling -strongly: 'I don't need io take the stuff', and also experiencing-a premoni- r tion that it would not give me any glimpse of 'the morn- ing of creation'.) i \"* also inclined to believe that mescalin made me 'psychic' to some extent, it certainly seemed that many- of tle feetings and 'messages' I was receiving were floating loose in the atmospherl, like radio \\Maves. But it may have been an illusion due to some stimulation of imagination. For example, when I thought -of the area in whilh I Iive (in south-Cornwall), *y min{ immediately received a strong impression ot ui,tchcraft. My wife, who takes some inteiest ln Cornish history and antiquities, tells me that, as far as she kngws, this area was never connected with witchcraft. I not only disliked the sense of being overwhel*gq !y 'feelings'; I was certain that these feelings somehow lie in the op-posite direction from my -momgnts of-real insight. Huxle!. seems ro equare the feeling of loss of selfhood, of univerial love, witfr mysrical experience. I c1n only say- that this has never held true for me. I shouldsay first of all that I do not believe that mystical experiences are confined to mystics and saints. Professor A' H' Maslow of Brandeis university, usA has turned his attention to the subject of. extremely healthy human be' ings, and has conclude, ,l1j most healthy people. ex-"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"perience what he calls 'peak moments', mystical insights; moments of life-affirmation that seem to be based on the sense of universal love. I am certain that a 'mystical in- sight' depends partly on a certairr kind of mental health, partly upon a mental discipline, and partly'merely in 'Iooking in the right place'. I am inclined io suspect the kind that comes through ill-health or physical privation - like Pascal's vision. My own moments of intense insight have always been accompanied by a sense of health and control. They take the form of an intensification of reality, but not in the visual rense'of which Huxley speaks; they are the opposite of what Heidegger means by 'forgetfulness of existence'. 'We live in a world of petty preoccupations and illusions, and there is a strong ele- ment of the spoilt child in all of us - that is, we are inclined to behave as if some trivial worry or incon- . venience were the most important thing in the universe. Sometimes, some outward event is kind enough to bring us back to earth - as if a man about to shoot himself because his wife has left him should hear of the outbreak of war, and recognize that his own catastrophe ii un- ' important in comparison. But mostly we are confined to a claustrophobic world of personal little values. We can do something to combat these by some mental discipline, by refusing to be carried away by trivialities, by refusing to make mountains out of personal molehills, by trying forcibly to 'unspoil' oneself. (On the basis of . a slight acq-uaintance with hirn, I believe that the late Aldous Huxley did this highly successfully.) But it is also pos- sible sometimes to 'shatter' one's narrow personal values by forcing the imagination to contemplate some great ch'allenge, or perhaps the idea of death. A poem like Wil- fred Owen's 'Exposure' can have this efiect of bringng reality closer; so can a passage like 'El Sordo on the Hill- top' from Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. lt might be said, of course, that in the simplest sense, these experiences of 'reality' are simply part of the process of growing up. But it should also be recognized that rnost 2t2 trleople never db grow up; they remain lxed in this chitd' istr -stage of self-contemplation, believing that' their emotions'are the most important thing in the universe. t will now be seen why I found myself fighting so hard against the sense of love and trust brought on by the mescalin; it was the reverse of the process of be- coming adult; it was sliding back to the beginning again, seeing the universe through great mists of one's own feel- , ings - even though these feelings had no element of , cruelty or'selfishness. One was further away than ev-er from Being in Heidegger's sense. The great objection to this 'personal' world is that it blocks one's vision, exactly as if someone emptied a bucket of glue over the.wind- , screen while one was driving. Therefore, instead of one's ' inner being responding healthily to challenges, it is be- wildered. by conflicting voices, like a host of- children clamouring for attention I could understand perfectly why Sartre and Huxley had experienced opposite reactions, and why my reaction was difterent from either. When Huxley was interviewed the interviewer asked him if he could understand in what direction madnesi lies, and Huxley replied em- phatically 'Yes'.'If you started the wrong wal, everything that happened would be a proof of a conspiracy against you .,. If one began with fear and hate as the major prernise, one would have to go on to the conclusion.' Huxley saw the world 'quivering with meaning', sofrl€. how projecting the inner intensity outward on to things. If one started with the wrong premise - thit the universe was actively against one - thig 'meaning' would seem to be its malevolence seen face to face. Most chil&en and adolescents have a certain feeling of mistrust about the universe - it is one of the first consequences of losing the inhocence of babyhood (and no doubt the reason that so many young children develop self-pity, and use their pains and illnesses as a weaPon for extorting afiection), Ridding oneself of this feeling that the universe has a personal grudge against one is the first and most difficult 213"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"' task in growing to adulthood. A simple, but'' dangerous means' of bringing it under control is to select some parj ticular object as ltre target for one's sense of universal unfairness - perhaps the Jews, or the communists, or the capitalist conspiracy. One justifies the mistrust.by reason - or something that has a specious appearance of reason. Now Sartre has certainly used reason to justify his pessimistic view of the world; consequently it is to be expected that mescalin should introduce him to 'hell' rather than heaven. On the other hand, it is clear that Hirxley has spent a lifetime in trying to free himself from 'selfhood', to 'unspoil' himself. This process involves rough treatment of one's tendency to self-pity. But the consequence is that there is no suppressed feeling of uni- versal unfairness, no 'basic horror of existence', for the mescalin to release. Huxley's problem - as he explains - i$ rather that he is too intellectual, too much given to _ making the world bloodless by conceptualizing it, and therefore too confined to this airless, sterilized world of concepts. Mescalin had the exhilarating efiect of putting his reason out of action. ln Ash Wednesday, Eliot had prayed that he might forget 'these matters that with my- self I too much discuss, too much explain'. T. E. Law- rence made the same observation: the intellectual some- times finds his reasoning mind clacking on like a type- writer until he begins to feel that his nature has been permanently dehydrated. Intellectuals are always finding themselves in this difficult position, victims of their own tendency to analyse. There are various ways of counter- acting this efiect: alcohol (within reason), social inter- course, listening to music, playing games, etc. Mescalin is undoubtedly more effective than any of ,these; the Frankenstein reason is chained; the world of feelings and objects rushes in to replace the world of concepts, and. suddenly, with delight, one realizes that the world is real, when one had begun to suspect that it is an abstraction. This accounts, I think, for Huxley's sense of release and his delight in the 'is-ness' of things 2t4 l,;\" Ar to myself, allhough I suppgse I also q\"\"lrfy as an ; :intellectual', I.dislike being confined in a world of 9ol ;: cepts, so I am inclined io keep my thinking 'existential. ', I tnint with my instincts as far as possible, and use reason as a kind of midwife, brought in to help and ; cLarify. I am bad at languages and at mathematics be- ,,,' cause I object to abstract thinking, to ideas or concepte (or words) for their own sake. Eliot was right when he objected to the practice of speaking about'vague emotion' and'clear thoufht', since thought is more often vague and il, *r\"* :.** u.^vs6^r!, u.rrvv ii emotion precise. I find that my own thought is clearest 1' when connected to a strong impulse or insight; the stronger the feeling, the clearer the idea. I im also fundamentally optimistic. When I read ,' Doors of Perception and thought 'I_ don't need to take i mescalin', it was the recognition that I experience a weaker degree of the mescalin sensation fairly frequentln and that it forms the underpinning of my everyday thinking. On the whole, I take it for granted that the universe means well by me, and always have, ever since my childhood. Throughout my childhood and teens I can remember experiencing sudden moments of certainty that 'everything is well', that the world is unbelievably beautiful, and that only our human limitations prevent us from seeing it. It always seemed therefore that the only problem is somehow to get past the limitedness of human vision, our 'worm's eye view' of'the universe, and it would instantly be seen that the universe is mostly cornposed of good, with very little evil. I recognize that in'order to achieve this distant objective, it is necessary to limit my consciousness, just as a watchmaker needs to harrow his attention to repair a watch. The universe it- self may possess infinite power, and yet suc! power is as useless for the small and precise tasks of evolution as the power of the Niagara Falls would be for rgpairing_ a watch. In order to get this precision, we need to install a valve for cutting down this ggeat flow of power to a trickle. We install the mental 'cut-out', the VHE attach- 2r5"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"ment, and it. immediately becomes possible to fqcuq the rnind on its problems with a new accuracy. The only thing to watch out for is the cut-out getting jammed. f am indined to believe, therefore, that my own cut- out can be disengaged slightly more easily than Huxley:s; so that there were no dehydrated tracts of my mind to be irrigated by th3 action of the mescalin.'The mescalin ex- perience was in no way fundamentally $trange to. me; but it was too strong. Instead of refreshing like an April 'shower, it swamped me like a monsoon After the attempt to eat the lamb chop, there is,noth- ing of great interest to report. My wife said she was gplng to the local church f6te, and I decided to get up and go too. I felt tired, but no longer ill. The wave-sensation was still going on like faint regular shocks of electricity - but less strongly. At the f6te I realized with relief that the feeling was wearing oft. I felt the same kind of pleasure that an athlete must feel on recovering from a sick-bed. My feelings were again controllable; I no longer felt like a female pig feeding a dozen young ones. Later in the duy - particularly around supper time - I ex' perienced twinges of the mescalin effect, a surge of feel- ing that had to be controlled. (There is a distinct sense of being able to grve these feelings a positive or. a negative interpretation, somewhat similar to Persuading oneself not to be sick; the feelings seem to be like a powerful animal that is safe so long as one's control o*er it is absolute.) A few of these twinges recurred the follow- ing day; but they had all ceased within forty-eight hours. Thinking about this later, I was glad that I had 'ne\"ver been tempted to try mescalin in my teens, when I might have found the forces released by it uncontrollable. The other half gpam of mescalin was taken a month later by u Soho friend; the results were not spectacular. EoF several hours he seemed to be intensely happy, and kept repeating: 'I feel wonderful.' (He compared the effect to marijuana.) When listening' to Tristan and, Isold,e a few hours later, he burst into tear$. The mescalin g16 :,ibeenred to have an un-inhibiting eftect on him, similar to that of alcohol. , Another friend who took mescalin - a young novelist - rhas supplied me with her notes on the experience, which :largely confirm the theories I have developed above, par- ,ticularly that mescalin plunges the taker into a kind of ,,dream world, a world of inaction, where one has no de- fence against one's latent fears and fantasies. She de- 'scribes fierself as inclined to catatonia - a state of mental automatism in which the will ceases to function, and the limbs remain fixed in any position in which they are placed. Her account brings to mind Greene's description of tris state of mind in his teens: 'For years . . . I could take no 'aesthetic interest in anything visual at all: star- 'ing at a sight that others assured me was beautiful, I would feel nothing. I was fixed in my boredom.' The first effect of mescalin upon this subject was to make her creep into a corner and assume what she calls an 'Egyptian pose', and to contort her limbs in various other ways. '. . . the compulsion wa$ a sort of inner neces- sity, similar to, but more elaborate than, the need to turn off a dripping tap or to touch every third railing. I should mention that I am normally an obsessive com- pulsive^type, and the mescalin tightened it.' W'alking in the street, 'I felt weightless and glided along'. This was late at night, and the lights produced a ,r sensation of pleasure; an office block, for example, looked like 'a bunch of flowers against the sky'. She writes: 'There is a point where the verb \"to see\" is'raised to \"to experience\". Llnder mescalin, visions have an objective, unquestionable quality; they seem to be a change in the -world, rather than in you.' 'Further colour experienceS occurred in the bathroom. The walls had originally been green, then whitewashed and repainted pale blue. The work had been badly done, and risulted in watery patches of discoloration. Now ,the walls looked like a iubmarine scene, with aquatic diftusions of blues and turquoises, and a submerged 217"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"'r mountain rangg. The window ledge had a sort of eroded crust, formed by years of blistering paint and spattered toothpaste. I thought the spots and spores looked mil- dewed like the rind of a gorgonzola cheese.' Discussing these phenomena with C (her landlord), we used the word 'bathroom' so oftein that C made a slip of the tongue and said 'bloodbath' (from a recent newspaper headline). I told him that when advertising rooms to let, he should print on the card 'Come and see the sub- merged gorgonzola in our bloodbath', as he would thus attract the right sort of tenants. 'I tried closing my eyps, and iaw parallel rows of tiny identical figures, made of brightly coloured tin like the scraps inside a kaleidoscope.' Huxley, also, mentions a similar experience. I myself found that closing my eyes made no difference - in fact, my eyes were dosed much of the time. After eating, they sat in opposite chairs. 'I turned the armchair into a flight of front steps, on which C ... had established his court for the night . . . I further supplied a Greek pillar and some empty milk bottles. From this time on, I gave him the persoriality of the zany professor. My own personality was the Egyptian,. whom I entitled the Egyptian Catatonic. This business of personae needs elucidating; neither C nor I were like something; we toere something. Similes became metaphors. It was rather like an 'agreement betweeh actors; one of them finds a policeman's helmet in the property trunk, and by put- ting it on becomes, for present purposes, The Policeman.' 'I was not T'he Egyptian all the time. Walking home, I had been for a while a face, half of which wa$ a skull ... Later, I became a horrible Thing. A thing was a facd, like the flat head of a snake, with slit, idiot's eyes. It was soft and disgusting sluglike, and had no lower iaw, but ended in the curve of the cheeks and upper Iip.- I had a concept of the Thing, and knew it was me. The ex, perience was horrible while it lasted.' Here the experience begins to sound like Sartrers. gr8 fr Again, it can be seen that .the ,usual mental, filter, that . one establishes by long discipline, vanishes, and the I .of Cocteau; his ruinscapes in which an attic lumber room ,f ieads away down an 6ndless cbrridor; than a corner is 'ltl turned and we are in a desert with a group of pillars as the sole landmark.' 'I felt I had magical powers; I could see how a group \".of drug takers would be in the right'mood to invoke the i devil or practise necromancy. The fesling of possessing rnagical powers was, however, only subjective; the drug did not make me think that magic was possible, and in 'fact left my usual, rather objective manner of thinking unimpaired.' Again, one is reminded of Sartre's account. ''I used my feeling of magical powers to practise self- analysis; various intuitions emerged with the certainty of revelations. Later, cold consideration of these 'revela- r,i tion$' tended to confirm them. They were all rather de- , pressing. . .' l:,,, At this point, her account becomes more than ever reminiscent of Sartre. 'My experiences were almost all unpleasant. I was eating a pear, and suddenly noticed \"that its flesh wiu composed of granules. Where I had bitten, the granules were writhing like bisected maggots 'and bleeding pus. The whole thing was organic; it re- volted me. I turned the pear and regarded it from an oblique angle; now it heived and writhed like larva. I could r-rot stop looking at it; f was hypnotized by disgust.' Ttris seems to confirm the suggestion I have made that i.'the experiences described in Nausea were those of Sartre's mescalin experience, or its after efiects. There were also visual illusions that sound similar to Sartre's 'lobster': 'Out of the tail of my eye, I saw beetles crawling over the fireplace. The grate was ferny with cbbwebs and centipedes. Greenfly climbed the plastic flex of the bed- gr9 i i-world becomes a place of fears, as in a nightmare. :,,; '. . .*y mescalin world mostly resembled' a black and i white film . ..

Whep I looked straight at them, the insects stopped moving and proved to be mlarks on the paint, 61 qpecks of dust.' At this point, the experience begins to sound similar to that-described by American 'hopheads', and perhaps explains some of the peculiarities of 'Beat' Poetry. because it was distorted by compulsions. I felt compelled to print this word in block capitals, or put that one in brackets, or to distort my handwriting.. . . These dis- tortions served as a devious way to Present the truth; whereas writing should be a direct statement of it. : 'I could not iead because the lights and sparks emitted by the page, -like interference on a radio, bombarded the meaning of the words.' 'About 4 am my sight started to run down, like a camera shutter that dicks rapidly between each image, and produces the jerky efiect of old films. I went to bed but could not sleep until 7 arn, when my ceiling looked as beautiful as if a pallet knife had spread it with difier- ent thicknesse$ of white paste.' , 'She adds, 'I consider that the experience had a long term efiect on me' in terms of general depression and abnormal behaviour. She concludes: 'I did not like writ- ing this account .. . I do not like thinking of those yeals at all; the.ice is s,o thin; it is easy to fall again into that terrible depression.' ' In this account, it is clear that mescalin had two efiects. The first hardly differs from the efiect of alcohol - she felt a warmth towards the world and particular ob- jects - desire to dance with a post-office van, etc. The second efiect may also be associated with alcohol - the slowing down of sensation, so that objects are seen more dearly - or rather, obtrude into consciousness by their stillness. One may even experience an analogous sensa- tion through indigestion -- the feeling that the limbs are made of stone or wood, and are swelling. (This usually 22o , occ-urs when lying down with the eyes closed.)' ., ' ,At any moment, human beings 'axe more or'less aware ' of the pro and,contra' of existence. But the mind's fcut- .'out valve' $eems to work more strongly with the 'pro' than the 'contra'. It is easy to see the world as a place of misery and insecurity and cruelty. The 'pro' is a more difficult matter; it seems to have two possible forms: natural goodness and evolution'ary coirsciousness. By : ,tnatural goodness' I mean not only ordinary moments of pleasure - aesthetic and physical - but also the state that : Boehme called 'the sabbath of the soul', which seems to , be analogous to Aldous Huxley's sensation under mesca Iin. By evolutionary consciousness, I mean a// pleasures assoqiated with the intellect or intellectual sensibility (which includes music, painting - even wine tasting). Natural goodness causes a sense of passivity, receptivity. 'Keats's'negative capability'; evolutionary consciousness is an intensity in which consciousness is aware of itself 'as actiuity. This is the purpose of education, as described by rWells on p. BE. It is a sense of power, of control, and is difierent in kind from any physical pleasures. (Wells catches it admirably in t}rre Autobi,ography, describing the exhilaration of his first explorations into science) It involves a sense of responsibility (as distinguished from i passive enjoyment), and in Man and Superrno,n Shaw speaks of 'the birth of the moral passion' to describe the awakening of this sense of acthte participation in the business of evolution. (I here use evolution in its simplest sense, meaning any kind of complexification; the notion of biological evolution need not be present.) , Mescalin seems to inhibit evolutionary consciousness. Whether its effect is pleasurable or not therefore de- pends, to begin with, on how far one needs a rest from evolutionary consciousness. A thinker who finds himself thinking too much comes into this category. But it is clear that Huxley was generalizing his own experience too much when he assumed that most people would enjoy a 'mescalin holiday'. Front Huxley's early work - 22r"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"t . .4 , slorie$ like' The Boo;ksho| and Richard Greenow or a hovel like erorne Yellow it seems apparent that Huxley's boyhood and youth were not hiirnted: by ,a sense of insecurity; there is a freshness, a feeling of the gentle enjoyment of existence, about them. Moreover, Huxley was in his sixties when he took mescalin, and had therefore had time to develop a perception of meaning, a iejection of the idea of exisienCe ,s i,orror and nausea. All this explains why he found the mescalin experierice so pleasurable. A younger person of comparable sensi- tivity will almost inevitably be more aware of the 'con- tra' side of existence. (Dostoevsky himself was more aw'are of the 'contral than the 'pro', as is apparent from The Brothers Karamazov.) Unless such a peison possesses 3 sl1o\"S enthusiasm for ideas, of the order expressed by Wells in The Undying Fire, the effecr of mescalin will be to-emphasize these fears, produce a feeling of 'skating on thin ice'. It may even produce a sense of total hoiror, nausea, as described by William James in The Varieties of Religious Experience, It is interesting to note that James's account of his own attack of 'horror' has much'in cornmon with the above account of mescalin-induced 'catatonia'.It, came when he was in a state of ill health Trd nervou$ depression, and was accompanied by an image of a catatonic patient whom James Lad seen in an asylryna who sat unmoving atl day looking like 'a sculp !,rr.d Egyptian cat or Peruvian mummy ... looking abso lutely-non-human'. James adds: 'f awoke morning atter morning with a horrible dread in the pit of my stomach, and with a sense of the insecurity of life that I never knew before.' This'dread in the pii of the stomach, is the most familiar of everyday sensations to many people whose lives seem to,, be a constant battle against vari6us forms of insecurity and unpleasantness. It can be seen, then, why Huxley's recommendation of mescalin for general use should not be taken too seriously. It is note- , worthy that James says that his attack took place when he was in a state of 'general depression of spirits about 222 my prospr;rr' - a state that is familiar to most people, But James's account also eonfirms the thesis that I have advanced'in the first chapter of this book - that the most powerful optimists a\"re those who have swallowed 'a .strong dose of pessimisrn early, or have had difficult be- ginnings that make them less indined to self-pity. Huxley's comment that schizophrenia can produce o some df the effects of mescalin is confirmed by an exarnple related to me by Margaret Lane. In rg45, im- .mediately after the birth of her second child, she found herself in a condition of emotional oversensitivity, when any thought of pain or misfortune would bring her close to tears. It was at this time that the famous 'fliroshima' copy of The New Yorker arrived, devoted entirely to ,John ffersey's account of the dropping of the atomic 'bomb and its after effects. In a state when even the men- tion of somebody's cat being lost could seem intolerable, llersey's narrative was a shattering experience that had the efiect of 'burning out her emotional fuses' (in her own words). She became completgly incapable of any kind of feeling, as though all the 'feeling nerves' had ' been cauterized. Even when she had recovered physically, the capacity to feel did not return, although she 'went through the motions' of social and family life. One of the symptoms of this state of inner deadnEss' was that grass took on an artificial appearance, while the leaves on tree$ seemed to be cut out of green tin. Living became a kind of ritual, without any spontaneous feelings of love or hatred, pleasure or distaste. A year later, she and her husband were thinking of buying a cottage in Hamp- shire, and went. to view it. Miss Lane went out alone into the field behind the cottage. The grass, as.usual, looked a clever imitation, and the leaves like tin. She noticed some unfamiliar blue flowers in the grass; their blue was so intense that she stopped to stare. Suddenly, the blue- ness seemed to break through the glass wall between her- self and reality, and a sense of tremendous emotional re- lief 'followed so that she burst into tears. She knew this 223"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"was the beginning of recovery. During the next few days; the frozeii feelings seemed'to thaw and break up, until the capacity to feel had returned completely. As she described these experiences to me, I immedi- ately recognized the state of oversensitivity following pregnancy as being identical with my own experience under mescalin, when it became impossible to eat a lamb chop. In such a state, with an almost non-existent pain- threshold, such a revelation of pain and cruelty as ffersey's book could easily produce-total and permanent insanity. Some interior safety-mechanism obviously came into operation, preventing such a collapse, completely suspending all feeling, 'blowing the fuses'. But what is significant is that gras$ and leavis were seen as lifeless.In fact, it would hardly be untrue to say that grass and leaves really look rcther like green raffia and tin; ure supply their'life' in looking at them. The burning out of internal fuses meant that this energy was no longer airailable to the subconscious intentionality, so that nature was seen as dead. It is interesting to speculatp what would have been the effect if, in the state following childbirth, Margaret Lane had had an experience that produced the opposite effect - a sense of universal love and trusu would this have consolidated itself later as a kind of. positiae mescalin vision? The rbal significance of all this emerges if one thinks for a moment in terms of phenomenological analysis. Miss Lane described her state of inner deadness' as a kind of schizophrenia and, in a technical sense, no doubt she is right. But in that case, schizophrenia is not illness, like mumps, divided from normality by a definite break, but a mere point on a line, on which another arbitrarily selected point is labelled 'normality' and yet another 'mystical vision', while further in the opposite direction is suicide-mania and catatonia. And since not even a Watsonian mechanist would deny that progression from schizophrenia to 'abnormality' is an evolution, and that this evolution might be brought about, or at least facili- 224 ' tate,4 by phenomenological ., analysis, it follows that ,mari's natural evolution lies in ,the 'visionary' direction- , ord that this is also partly a matter of phenomenological analysis. c Let me try to summdrize one of the central ideas of this book, in the light of what has been said above. ,, One of the most fundamental problems of the human condition is. that man assumes his reality to be identical with his present states, physical and mental. Since he is necessarily aware of himself as a 'social animal', a human personality that knows itself essentially through it$ inter- action with other human personalities, it is inevitable that,his human personality - tied to the static Present - will act as a filter through which the outside world has to pass. 'Reality' is seen stained by the mediocrity of every' day existence. Man lives at the bottom of a kind of fish- t\"rrk whose glass is gre'asy, dusty and inclined to distort. Certain experiences can endow him with a mental energy that momentarily rockets him clear of the top of the fish tank, and he sees 'reality' as infinitely alien, in- finitely strange. What is more, it is curiously meaningful; if ,a direct relation could be established with it, rlife would be seen in the light of purpose. (It is impossible to think of meaning dissociated from purpose.) It should be made clear that the glass of the fish tank is not the senses - as Descartes and subsequent philosophers have assumed; it is the human personality, which knows , itself as an active p'articipant in the world, in relations ' with other people.- This fine networh of relati,ons is the d,istorting rned,ium, not the senses. Man iJ mistaken, of course, ir,r assuming himself to be a static being. Even if he fails to mature in any mental sense, he grows older physically, If he could somehow develop a faculty of seeing himself as a dynamic rather than as a static being, the problem would be solved. Un- fortunately, the mind of western man has developed the faeulty of presentational immediacy at the cost of that of sausal efficacy. A man deeply involved in some active"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"work that grves him a sense,of development can escape the fish tank to some extent; but this is no answer unless the gains can somehow be.consolidated. The mystics were all aware of this in some degree; it is the subject of all Blake's work, for example, The roman' tics, and later the existentialists, were also aware of it. But to be aware of a problem is not to solve it. I{usserl began to lay the foundations of a method for attacking the problem. The problem is the distorting medium, which Husserl labelled 'intentionality'. The gre.atest achievement of existentialism has been to recog- nize that it is active human intentionalitn not the 'senses', that is the distorting medium; this, so far, has been its major contribution to philosophy. The first problem is to become aware that 'the world' we naively take for granted is being seen through a distorting medium. Husserl's life-work was mainly concerned with developing a scientific method for getting beyond this point. Heidegger and Sartre both believed that they were concerned with the next smge of the problem - how to clear away the distorting medium. Heidegger's chief con- tribution was to analyse the exact part played by human relations and by time in the distorting medium. By lay- ing the emphasis on time, he emphasized that the prdb- lem is not a static business, as e'arlier philosophers had assumed; it is inextricably tangled with action and human personality. It must be approached kinetically. Sartre approached the problem from a slightly difier- ent viewpoint. As I have already said, he was inclined to emphasize the need for action, rather in the manner of Ficirte. This was largely because his metaphysigpl foundations his theory of consciousness and iuten- tionality = werr so shaky. For Sartre, purposive action will get man out of the fish tank. The central emphasis of hii positive philosophy lay on the notion that man is not a static being, that he is wrong to accept his present 'reality' as his permanent reality, that he must learn to zeG recognize\"his freedom to become sometling orl.' th-an the -selfr that is determined by his being-in'the-world. Sartre had stated in less abstract terins, what Husserl had already stated: that the first step in fregdom lies in recognizing the natural standpoint for what it is, a temporary convenience. Aidous Huxley brought the whole probleT one $tep neat'er the practicat daylight by expressing it in terms of It can clearly be seen what noW remains to be done' The present book has attempted to outline thg prgblem, to t\"[.e it a step further and to show the way to future development, 6 'show the fly the way out of the fly bottle'] as Wittgenstein expressed it - or to show man the way out of the fish tank. Mescalin, I believe, could be used to produce the 'shocks' necessary to - make the existentiaiist thinkers aware of the problem; but its use- fulness is limited. What is now needed is a new existen' tialism based upon the method of flusserl, and apply+g this method to ihe material supplied by Heidegger - the nerwork of relations that iJ intentionality. what is happening is that the problem expre_ssed by the mystics - urrd by Blake in parlicular - has been first of all ex' ' pressed it terms ihat would have been acceptable tq bescartes, and second, expressed in terms of science, of phenomenological psychology, so that it can be attacked iike uny otheiscientific problem. First of all, the destruc- tion of the natural standpoint efiected by Husserl and Heidegger mu$t be incorporated into ev911day con- sciousniss. This is not difficult - no more difficult, say, than learning a language. The phenomenologrgal method must ihen be directed upon the problem of the renewal of man's two worlds, the language world and the perceived world - both of which- are composed-mai$y -of worn out parts. Phenomenological existentialism is the systematic replacement of the worn out parts.

This was published in England in ryb7.While it is not a wholly sucressful novel, it seems to me in many ways one of the most important to have appeared since the war. In The Angry Decade, Kenneth Allsop remarked on, the violence of the attacks on the book, unlike the usual $ympathetic reception given to fi.rst novels. Hopkins's AYM afiliations were not entirely responsible for these. The Diaine and the Decay is an uncompromising book, a curiously fanatical book, showing no visible influences, making no concessi.ons to what the reader exPects of modern fiction, preoccupied only with working out its problem'of 'how a rnan can be a giant in a world of pygmies'. It is also the work of a poet and a dramatisp rather than of a born novelist; it has an assertiveness that has been missing from English fiction since D. H. Lawrence. All these led certain critics to jeer about the 'search for a Superman', and to smell out 'cryPto-fascism' in the book's theme. Other critics supposed that the book is a savage satire on its fascist-type hero. Neither view is correct. The novel concerns Peter Plowart, the young leader of a neo-fascist movement in London's East End. Plowart 'goes to Vachau - a Channel Island obviously based on Sark - ostensibly for a holiday before a political cam- paign, but in reality to have an alibi when h[s co,partner in the movement is murdered in London. Plowa^rt is in some ways a typical 'hero of our time'. In s28 t,xj:-I, tr, rrrl., spite of his instinctive contempt for other men, he lacks rlal selt-Uelief. He is the true dictator tyPe - a romantic and dreamer who can never be contented with introspec- tion, who needs to see his effect on men. But although he lives and works in 'society', he is no realisu he is hardly aware of anything but his own inner compulsions. This strange 'lack of contact' with the real world is demon- strated in the opening scene of the novel, where he is on the boat crossing to Guernsey, and falls into conversation with a-middle-aged man; almost immediately, Plowart plunges into self-revelation. He is not aware of the un- iuitability of his audience, only of his own need to spgak. He tells the man: 'The outstanding trait of my personal- ity was a strong aversion to othei human beings; I saw in them all, a shibby travesty of myself and of everything that constitutes.human greatness.'

He is aware of his own Power in contact with other human beings. But left to himself, he feels nothing. Lawrence of Aribia had the same characteristic; all who worked with him spoke of an extraordinary inner force, that made him a natural leader; and'yet the Seaen Pillars of Wisdorn is fuil of self-doubt, the fallacy of insignificance.

He is only a pipe through which life flows....' This 'hollow men' aspect of Plowart is revealed after his conversation on the boat. He falls asleep, and has again one of the appalling nightmares that liave always. haunted him; it leaves him feeling exhausted and empty. In a cafd on Guernsey, some Vachau fishermen acci- dentally smash his portable radio; Plowart had been relying on it to bring him the new$ of the murder; he flies inrto an insane rage and threatens to stab one of the fisher- men. This episode has later repercussions in the book. On Vachau at last, he finally takes lodging with a re- pulsive, self-pitying cripple named Lumas. The story of his encounter with the fishermen has preceded him, and be is generally avoided. Only one rnan - a drunken old villain named Buffonet - ofters to c,lrry his bags, and offers him a certain grudging regard. He is later beaten up by the other fishermen for ignoring the boycott. Lumas, Plowart's landlord, is everything for which he feels contempt. He is intelligent, but nihilistic. For several years, his wife has been having a love afiair with a tomato grower from Guernsey named Lachanell. Lumas stews in his self-pity, and drinks heavily. V\"ry soon, Plowart meets the other major character in the book, the young Dame on the islan4 Claremont. Now, for some reason that Hopkins does not make quite clear, Plowart becomes fascinated by her. ft is not a sexual attraction. For some strange reason, Ploruart senses that she possesses knowledge and'power'; not his kind of power over other people, but subjective power. I{e seems to feel almost that she is a supernatural being. This is uldoubtedly a weak link in the book; for although Claremont come$ over as an intelligent and self-possessed young lady, the reader finds it hari to imagine'why she should impress Plowart more than all the other similar young ladies he must have met at London parties. Claremont does not return Plowart's admiration. He ipeaks to her with his usual frankne$s about'his,am- fttions, his contempt for human beingu; she is secretly horrified, but takes care not to show it. She ProPoses a 'test' for him, which she claims is a tradition among,the young men of the island. It involvgl crawling dowrr-a ipw of rock that juts out from the difi oler the sea; this, sire says, will prove whether he is merely a braggart and,a coward. Plowart accepts, and edges his way along the spur; it breaks away from the clifi, and_he falls a hun- dred feet into the sea. Badly shaken, but unhurt, he drags himself back to his room. Claremont apparently assumes that he is dead; the reader is left to suPPose that this was her aim in proposing the test. The lover of Mrs Lumas - the tomato grower, Lacha- nell - wants Plowart to vacate his room; it is an attic reom in which Lachanell usually stays when he is on the island; the cripple.cannot reach it because the ladder is too steep. Plowart refuses. But soon the tomat_o grortr€r gains tLG means'to blackmail Plowart. He finds a c9m- prornising letter - a letter that ptovgs P19war1's involve- ment in the murder. Plowart decides that the tomato grower must be eliminated and begins to play on the self- iorrte*pt and self-pity of his host to try to make him the instrument of Lachanell's destruction. In the ureantime, he sees Claremont again, spends. the nl.ght at her house, and ends by raping-her. At the last mi--nute, instead of resisting, and thus acknowledging his superior strength, she becomes calm and with{rawn, and as^Plowart ta.fes her, he feels that she has defeated him agaln.

The passages in which Pl6wart express€s his ideas are also of unifoim excellence. From this point of view, the central passage .of the book is the speech in which Plowart exflains-to Claremont his theory oJ 'ultimate compassiorri.

And yet this is not entirely un- true. (In the last appendix, I shall go into this problem more fully where it concerns Soviet Russia.) ': This is the problem that makes the book so difrcult - and so rewarding. Hopkins cannot be accused of sim: plifying the issues to gain symPathy. Plowart is not a ivmpathetic character; it would help the reader to feel thai the author disapproves of him. But Flopkins's atti- tude is difficult to define. It is not comPlete appro-val; but it is very far from disapproval. The author obviously feels as Plowart does; the failure of men to rise above mediocrity worries him. The reaction of T. E. Lawrence to the same feeling was withdrawal from society, a refusal to ofier his intimacy. With an aPParently insane ideal- ism, Hopkins obviously feels that men can be changed, that theie 'are ears to listen to sermon$ on the need of man to increase his stature. In his essay in Declaration, it becomes apparent that he feels basically as Plowart does. He beginJ with a fortftright denunciation of literature since the war, declaring that it lacks PurPose, direction and power, has opened no new roads of imagination and created no monumental cha^racters. He also has the re' markable sentence: rThere are only a few who demand 'all the truth a writer possesses.' fle speaks of the need for 'writers with phenomena! Powers of dedication'. The title of the essay, significantly, is Way! Without a Pre' cedent. It is unfortunate for Hopkins that his book appeared when it did, in rgg7. Seven years earlier, when the critics were gloomily prophesying that there would be no liter.' ary revival to parallel the revival of the 'twenties, his book would probably have been read with rnore Per- ception. (This was the time when Mr Angus Wilson's first book of stories - hardly promising his future de- velopment - was acclairned) At it was, it received the worJt of the backwash of the uirpreced.lt.d- publicity- of the Angry Young lVlan movement. Sir Charles Snow has rccently spoken of the ,* #iagnanimity in British life today -.he suspects it may spring from Britain's sense bf being a waning power in world politics. Since the mid- fifties, it has been particularly evident in literature. This has been nowhere more obvious than in the reception of The Di,aine and, the Decay. For what Hopkins is trying to do is, after all, supremely worthwhile. The literature of the twentieth century has very few memorable characters. The few re- markable 'heroe$' have been self-portraits of their authors: Lawrence's Paul Morel, Joyce'S Stephen, Proust's Marcel, Hemingruay's Nick. Aldous Huxley had tried to create a few 'positively good' characters in his later novels, beginning with Propter in After Many a Summer; all are quite unmemorable. , The central problem was expressed by Sartre in his nouvelle, Childhoo.d of a Leader. Lucien Fleurier is a handsome and intelligent young man, but far too sensi- tive, far too introspective. He also has no sense of inner- power', of being somehow 'necessary'. fle is even capable of wondering whether there is any proof that he exists. But unlike Huxley's Gumbril, he does not 'glory in the name of earwig'; he finally succeeds in leaving behind his self-doubts by becoming a fanatical anti-Semite and a fascist thug. The story ends with his realization that he has 'the stufi of a leader' in him. . But Sartre's meaning is unmistakable, and his book on anti-Semitism underliries it: Lucien has 'sold out' by be- eoming an anti-Semite, plunged quite deliberately into self-delus ion (mauu ai,se -f o i,), chosen an inauthentic means of escaping his inner chaos. Thd is-qplendid. But what would be an authenti,c way? This is the question that Sartre never tries to answer; the hero of his major novel, Roads to Freedom, is another hopeless weakling. Hopkins has attempted to answer the question, there- by taking existentialism a stage beyond Sartre. And he is bold enough to recognize that the problem cannot be solved in terms of the 'o.rdinary'.man' - that is, a self- 235"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"divided .m.odern man, without self-belief or any other kind of belief. At least Plowart has a fierce belief in the possibility of human evolution. . But Hopkins's rnajor advance beyond Smtre is in ,the lrope trick' at the end of the novel. Like all modern heroes, Plowart feels 'empty inside'; he is a pipe through which life flows. It is not that he does not possess the power; he does. He is in the position of Ramakrishna's grass-eating tiger who could not believe that it was not a sheep. It is self-belief that he does not possess. (In his later years, Dickens had to read his works aloud to audiences because he had to see them sobbing over the death of Little Nell or fainting over Bill Sykes's murder of Nancy; it somehow convinced him that he was a great writer.) But did the rocks move or not? Claremont was lying and yet Plowart made the rocks move and experienced the 'revelation'. It is the 'rope trick' again. It is the act of faith, of self-belief that is the preliminary of existential- isrn'and of phenomenology. There would be no point in seeking for an intentionality if we believed that the 'phenornenon' was the only reality. Although it is doubtful whether he had heard of phenomenology at the time he wrote The Diaine and the Decay and Ways Without a Preaedent, he has many things to say that might be simply a restatement of the views I have tried to outline in the latter p'art of this book. For example: '. . . I predict that within the next two or three decades we will see .the end of pure rationalism as the foundation of our thinking. If we are to break out of our present encirclement, we rnust en- visage Man from now on as super-rational; that is, possessing an inner-compass of certainty beyond all logic and reason....' It is this 'inner-compass' that has so far been lacking from existentialism. Kierkegaard's'Truth is subjectivity' expresses it only feebly, because it seems to justify the view that there are as many 'truths' as there are in- 296 dividuals, and all'are equally valid. It would be more accurate to say: 'Truth is evolutionary intentionality.' Oyt basic experience of life is of fighting; from the moment we are born, gravity pulls us to the earth, and requires a constant .effort to resist it. Before we have achieved a sense of balance, we fall and learn that the force of gravity and the hardness of the ground seem to be in league against us. We nev€r oyercome gravity, and when, in old age, our legs groil, wbak, gravity begins to win again. (Consequently, 'freedom' is often identified with floating; drugs and alcohol have the effect of making.us forget gravity, or of making the body seem lighter.) It might be said, then, that man is foredoomed to lose the battle against gravity, and that his life is a 'burden' py its very nature. On the'other hand, this is to forget that there could be no human life and no civilization without gravity; 'we would float away. Gravity is the basis of most machines. If gravity were regarded as man's inevitable tragedy, we would gape with astonishment at men who are eccentric enough to go walking as a hobby, or even climbing mountains; it would be regarded as self-flagellation. But we take these things for granted, because we recognize that gravity is a necessity of life that is a nuisance only to a limited extent, but that can be used in a thousand different ways. We have only to generate enough basic energy to neutralize the pull of gravity - which has to be paid like a shareholder in a company - and the rest of the profit is our own. lluman life in general is an exact parallel to this basic physical situation. It is easy enough to prove that.it is a burden, that man 'can't win', that when the 'facts are weighed in the balance of logic, it would have been bet- ter if we had never been born'. But logic alone can lead to nothing and proae nothi,ng. If you are watching a game of chess, and you know the rules of the game, logic will inform you whether each move has been made according to the rul,es or not. But unless your mind 23?"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"grasps the total purpose of the game and can'see all the possible moves,. you cannot be said to 'understand' it. Without a grasp of the intentionality that drives all life, it is indisputable that 'man is a useless passion'. : At present, man is in the position of knowing most of the 'rules of the game'. He may even accept that the game has a purpose connected with evolution. But a good chess player needs more than a knowledge of the rules and the ultimate purpose; he also needs a firm glasp of its possibilities, a pictorial intuition. The further ahead this intuition is capable of reaching, the more likely he is to win the game. Without such an intuition of purpose, life undeniably would be meaningless. Plowari 'flels' himself to b; greater than other men; all that he means is that his intuition of purpose is deeper and drives him harder. All that is lacking is one final piece of knowledge that would complete a pattern - and yet ignorance of it is as impor-. tant as ignorance of just one number to open.a combina- tion lock; it invalidates all the rest. , It is difficult to define exactly what was lacking io Plowart before his 'revelation', and it is even more diffi- cult to guess what will happen to him next. This is partly because of the difficulty and complexity- of the prpblem itself, and partly because of the shortcomings of Plowart's creator. If we accept Plowart as he is presented he is a strange mixture. Hi is oddly childish in many ways, too vulnerable. There is a scene near the beginning of thi book where he meets Claremont's two younger brothers; they annoy him and end by throwing pebbles at him; Plowart loses his temper, and begins to hurl boulders at them as they run away down the clifi - any. one of which could kill them. This is the violence of a p'aranoiac, like the scene in which he threatens the fisher- man with a knife because his radio set has been accidentally smashed. Earlier in the book, Plowart recalls an occasion when an abscess swelled under his arm; the pain almost drives him insane, but he refuses to go to a 238 doctor because 'it had become the incarnation of every- thing that opposed him'. When finally he is taten to hospital, he demands to be anaesthetized before ,they lance it, and then at the last minute, under the ma$k, Sghts the unconsciousness because he dreads losing his mind more than he dreads the pain. This begins :to sound very like a persecution mania. It is a remark made by the brothers about Claremont - repeating one of her observations about Plowart, when she sees him from a distance leaping over rocks - that convinces Plowart that she is an 'oracle'. These extremes of his character - vio- lence and gullibility - make it difficult for the reader to take much sympathetic interest in him. In spite of its faults, The Di,ui,ne and the Decay is an impressive performance - the only attempt I can recall to create a sympathetic hero who is not governed by qhe fallacy of insignificance, a man who is in some ways 'larger than life'. T. E. Lawrence has an interesting pas- sage in one of his letters: I have looked in poetry everywhere for satisfaction: and haven't found it. Instead, I have made that col- lection of' bon bons, chocolate eclairs of the spirit,, whereas I wanted a meal. Failing poetry, I chased my fancied meal through prose, and fbund everywhere little good stfifi, and only a few men who had tried honestly to be greater than mankind: and only their strainings and wrestlings really fill my stomach. I do not doubt that Lawrence would have found some- thing of what he looked for in Hopkins's novel. I a^ur equally certain that he would not have found it in any of the other 'AnSy Young Men'. John Braine's Joe Lamp- ton, in Room at the ToF, briefly produced an impression that something healthier and breezier than 'anger' was making its appearance; but when Lampton reappears in Life at the Top, it is seen that his 'will to power' in the e-arlier novel was largely a social matter. Joe shows him- setf willing ,to settle for peace and domesticity on ,fivc 2'39"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"thousand ayear. The romantic glow has vanished; Braine reveals himself as a realist, writing superlatively well about the world we know. Hopkins is a romantic in every sense; he is not interested in pleasant brooks; he wants cataracts falling from mountain tops. He does not want to make conversation about the weather; he wants to speak of tornados and bolts of lightning. The danger is obvious; the more a book wishes to achieve romantic heights, the deeper it has to cut.its foundatioirs of real- ism. There seems to be no prospect of Hopkins altering his aim - even the announced titles of his 'works in pro gress' prove this - Time of Totality, The Titans. Thre question, then, is of how deep he is prepared to cut?. It would not take a great deal of 'foundation work' to turu the immense prorriise of The Diaine and the Decay into secure achievement, But the main importance of the book lies in the power with which it 'symbolizes' the rope trick. There are, in existentialist fiction, certain works that symbolize ,the meaning of various abstract terms so well that it is diffi- cult tolwrite about existentialism without referring, 1s them. No one has ever expressed 'bad faith', self-decep- tion, with quite the.sdme polver and finality as Sartre in Childhood of a Leader. No one has ever embodied\" the ideas of 'authentic' and 'inauthentic existence' in a story so,perfectly as Hemingway in The Short and Happy Life of Franci,s Macomber. Crime .and Punishment contains the perfect symbol for the 'definitive act'. Kierkegaardfs Diary of a Sed,ucer embodies the idea of arbitrary choicc and freedom; Briussov's City of the Southern Cross is an ernbodiment of man's hunger for 'the irrational'. Hop- kins's novel is the only expression of 'the rope trick' that I .know in existentialist literature: of the paradox that the untrue can be made true by an act of Uelief, because the untrue w&s secretly true' in the first place. Because of the power with which it captures this intuition, it,should be,regarded as a cornerstcihe of the literatr.lre of evolu- tionary existentialism. - iil,i:i:ri ii. :. rii.it:ii: i APPENDIX III Culture in the Soaiet Union I N 1958, r NI the preface to The Age of Defeat,I expressed my feeling that Soviet culture places far too great an em- , phasis on the duty of the artisi to rhe $rare. Since then, I '' have had a chance to read many Soviet novels and hear a . great deal of Soviet musig as well as to form my or4rn personal impressions of Russian life on a visit to Lenin- . grad. It now seems to me that I was guilty of a consider- .. able over-sirnplification, and of drawing some false con- clusions. For it seems to be undeniable that the general '' 'tune' of modern Soviet writing and music is a greit deal healthier than its western counterpart; there is a sense of optimism and idealism, and'a lack of the 'fallacy of in- significance'. This does not mean that I think my com- ments in The Age of Defeat were entirely mistaken; but I think the situation is in actuality far more complex and interesting; it also has some bearing on the subject of the present book. It is easy to understand why artists in the west should feel a. certain hostility towards Russia, quite apart from their views on the desirability of socialism. The artist often staxts out on his career'with a tendency to intro- spection, a failure to 'fit in'. Frequently, the conflict be- , gins in his own family. We think of Shelley's father, Rimbaud's mother, Poe's step-father. Without further in- vestigati<rn, the western artist thinks of Russia as the country where the State itself is a father-figure, refusing to recogrrize the inner needs of its writers, demanding that they grind out works of 'social realism'. There is possibility of an element of truth in this. And yet Russian literature and music are flourishing, pro- ducing an enormous amount of first-rate work. Why should this be so? I 240 24t"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":";;irrj. . i. I .ri 'I believe we exaggerate the element of compulsion in the Iife of the Russian artist. We also imagine, with a certain naiaetC, that all 'free art' must develop exactly like our own. I was speaking recently with an intelligent painter who had been in Russia; he is an admirer of Jackson Pollock, and has specialized for some years now in tachiste painting. He had spoken to a Russian musician about the music of Alban Berg; the musician remarked on his admiration for Wozzeck. The painter replied: 'And yet you write popul'ar music for the masses?' The musician explained that he had written some experimental works in the manner of Schoenberg but that he had never submitted them for public per- formance. The painter then asked him excitedly if.he did not think it possible that Russian paintep did tachiste paintings in secret, and made sure that they never came to the notice of the authorities. The musician \\{as ,puzzled and slightly ofiended. When the painter told me the story, he was convinced that his guess was correct, but that Russian artists would never d'are to admit to a ta$te for abstract paintings for fear of official reprisals. I found his conviction amusing. It struck him as so obvious that 'free artists' should want to paint abstract pictures and write music in the manner of Boulez and Stockhausen. To scandalize him, I contended that tachiste painting is only a symptom of the fallacy of in- significance. When an artist has lost all real certainty and conviction, he still possesses the 'intentionality' of his 'form-imposing faculty'. This faculty will enable him io see faces in the fire, interesting patterns when he rubs . his eyes vigorously - or meaningful shapes as he throws paint on the canvas and waits for something to 'ernerge'. But the fact that he need:s to fall back on his 'uncon- scious mind' indicates that he is drifting; the grcat artists of the past have known precisely what they intended to do and how they intended to do it. I said these t't irrgr to be provoking (and succeeded). But it struck me later that there was some justification for my view. I recalled the BBC hoax when several tech- nicians banged tin cans and made arbitrary noises, and i,,\" the rgsult was presented as a neW piece of modern music, ;,, and was accepted as such by the critics. Like much 'modern artr, this type of music claims for . itself the scientist's right to demand a special.level of 'sophistica- il;, ' tion' from i-ts audience, hinting that its relation to the art of the past is like the relation of Einstein's relativity to Aristotle's physics. After all, no one condemns a page of mathematical equations for refusing to yield up its meaning at first glance. But there is a fallacy here. The 'inner logic' of art can never achieve the authentic com- plexity of a mathematical equation because intuition 'il, defined language. Where art and music are concerned. ',' ' the critic might be forgiven for using a$ his basic criterion a $entence of Wittgenstein: 'What can be said at all can be said clearly.' No one can deny that Soviet art encourages darity. This is not to say that it confines itself to a nursery- ,,,, ,rhyme simplici,ty. To an unmusical listener, the music ,,.,''t of Prokoviev and Shosrakovitch may sound as'difficult' as -- the music of Stockhausen. But Soviet artists - writers and musicians - do not seem to feel that being immediately comprehensible is somehow shameful. I am not, of course, claiming that the communist ideo, logy is the ideal background for a writer. But at least it at .a real background, a tradition. What is more, it has its roots in the great Russian tradition of artistic^clarity, of national art. It is easy to cite examples of absurdities to which some 'official' theories have given rise. Stravinsky, who dislikes Russia's new m'asters,.has cited a number in his Poetics of Music how the authorities expressed approval of i' 'Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin because of its realism, and Condemned Rimsky-Korsakov's Inuisible City of Kitezh for its 'mysticism', afld then later reversed their decision, 242 243"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"finding Kitezh, to be 'national', and Onegi:,n to be decadent and aristocratic. I , Nevertheless, on the whole, the influence of the 'official line' on Soviet 'art has been healthy rather than other- wise. Shostakovitch is frequently cited as an example of a man who has been bullied by the Party; in the rg3os, his opera Lady Macbeth of Mtensh was censured and with- drawn, and he produced his Fifth Symphony, sub-titled 'A Soviet Artist's Reply to Just Criticism'. It was a great popular success. In rg48, Shostakovitch was included with a number of'other musicians (includirg Prokoviev) in another censure by an officious minister of culture. Yet the results, as far as his music is concerne4 do not seem to have been in any way harmful; he has since written much'of his finest music, including the twenty-four Pre- ludes and Fugues, and the fourth and fifth quartets. Pro- koviev and Miaskovsky produced their most delightful sy'mphonies 'as a result of the 'censure'. IR rgf8, after Stalin's death, it was officially acknowledged that, in cer- tain respects, the cen$ure had been unjust and unneces- sarily harsh. The worst of Soviet music tends to be very bad - cheap, jingoistic and obvious. But the best - urd there is a great deal of it ; possesses all the best national qualities. (I can herd cite my own experience as a col- lector of opera on gramophone records. I have frequently bought modern operas without first hearing them. With certain American operas, one hearing has been enough, and the works have stayed unplayed on my shelves. But rny 'blind buying' of Soviet operas has been luckier; even when they lack musical profundity, they usually possess enough tunefulness to make them worth replaying many times.) Soviet literature seldom possesses psychological pro- fundity; yet it fnanages, on the whole, to maintain a standard that is a great way above most English and American best sellers. The Russians have an endearin$ 'serious mindedne$s', so that when a Rovel is dull, it is ,honestly and opcnly dull, with no flavouring of sex,and violence to act as artificial seasoning. Modern Russian literature could be compared to Engtish literature two centuries ago - in the Tom lones and. Captain Singleton stage. There are, perhaps, too many 'honest engineers' and so on, but again, its seriousness is pleasant. The main objection of the west towards Soviet 'art: (I use the word to include music, painting and literature) is that it is based on a marerialistic ideology, and that rnaterialism and art are basically in opposition. But it need surprise no one that this 'materialii*' is not gener- atrIy apparent in Russian literature or in opera. For in the true sense, pessimists like Andreyev or Samuel Beckett are more materialistic than the socially optimistic soviet writers. Very few writers plumb the depths where a philosophy of materialism would make any difierence. A good writer creates human beings, a bad one over- simplifies; this is the most important difierence. The writer who is a facile and silly pessimist is usually bad. At least Soviet literature has been saved from the Samuel _B-eckgtt type oi pointlessness, or the spiritual dyspepsia of Mr Greene. 'But for the wrong reasons,' the western critic will hastily interject. This is only partly true. The worsr tendencies of modern western art again I include painting, music and writirrg - are due to the romantic fallacy of unlimited freedom. Lawrence once 'said: 'Thank God I'm not free, any more than a rooted tree is free.' The free artist, if he wants to develop, must seek for roots, for a tradition, a direction, a purpose. And the best traditions are those that hold up an idia of a future for man. It might be objected that the communistic 'future' is merely social, materialistic. But what right has the western britic to-complain about this when western art has,degenerated into a bog of despair and setf-pity that is the outcome of its lack of social optirnism? - These bickerings between two culturei do not deser\"ye a great deal of attention; they 'are too often.a matter of 245 244"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"the.rpot calling the kettle black. Western critics declare that Stalin kitled ofi Babel, and interfered unwarrant- ably in the artistic lives of Prokoviev and Shostakovitch; a Russian critic could reply that America allowed Bartok to die in misery and poverty, and refused to grant Schoenberg the miserable pittance he needed to 'finish Moses and Aaron before he died. There is justice on both sides. Many western writers and musicians would willingly accept State interference if the State would also agree to take an active interest in the artist, as it does in Russia. But again, it is easy to oversimplify the issues. ft seems to me that Russia is, at present, in a healthier position than the West in regard to culture. It is true that the early days of the revolution may have placed all kind of irksome restraints on the artists - some of which were due to Stalin's delusion that he was a universal genius and qualified to pronounce on everything. But the basic Russian ideology is optimistic. Irs spirit, and therefore its 'invisible premises', were idealistic, not materialistic. At the time of the Lysenko-Mendel controversy, no one pointed out that the roles seemed to have got reversed, that Russia, the home of 'materialism' and behaviourism, was championing the evolutionary spirit of man, while the 'free' west was explaining with pleasure that man has absolutely no control over his future, and must hope for - a random mutation to produce a' human being who is not naturally greedy, selfish and murderous. It may seem that I am expressing only a neo-commun- ism, like the uneasy'alliance of the intellectuals and the comtnunist party in the 'thirties. But it seems to m€ that the situation has changed immensely since the 'thirties, and very largely.for the better. The writer cannot afford to ofier simple allegiance to one country or another (although he is usually a bad writbr if he does nor feel a strong attachment to his own country). In The colours of the Day, Romain Gury expressed the hope that the present conflict of East and West would prove to be, like Hegelian dialectic, a means to a new synthesis, with both 246 t;/ i: the right and the left drawn closer to the centre. The writer's allegiahce is to that synthesis of the future, not to any Present status quo. ^ It seems,possible that the 'dialectic' of the past twenty- five years has brought this synthesis closer. i, u recent address on Magnanimity, Sir Charles Snow pointed out ' that western Europe has many reasons for reglrding both America and Russia with a certain admiration. For a long time now, Amer:ica has produced a very large per- centage of the world's finest scholarship. Immediately after the war, Russia flung all her .r.r[i.r into educa- tion = an extraordinarily idealistic decis-ion, in view .of the social and economic reconstruction that might have becn regarded as a prior need in a war-shatteredio.rotry. The results of this idealism are visible today in the high Ievel of Soviet science. The old conceptions of these countries no longer fit the facts; neither does their view of one an6ther; America is no longer the commercial jungle that Maya- kovsky wrote about, any more than Russii is the totari. t_arian jungle of ,Nineteen Eighty Four. rr seems possible that the country that wins the tug-of-war wilr be the one , that is sensible enough to let go of the rope, and will- ingly incorporates into itself some of the beit features of its 'rival'. In his mosr recent book, the Critique of Dialectical Reason, Sartre has attempted to persuade Marxian philosophy ro abandon its old-fasfiioned nineteenth century materialism, and'accept a more realistic existen- tial psychology as the hasis of its social optimism. This, as I have pointed out, is not as revolutionaiy as it sounds; it was already foreshadowed in the rejection of biorogical determinism as the official 'party Line,. If Sartri is successful, and Russia combines existential premises with her naturally optimistic premises and belief in the future of man, I think there can hardly be any doubt of the outcome of the 'cultural race' of our time. And yet even so, it would be impossible to predict that such an 247"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Outcome would be final. My own observation of America, with its tremendous intellectual vitality'(held in check only by a strange 'insignificance' neurosis) convinces me' thal existential realism could also channel these energieS to produce a new 'world culturel. f.rt *ott inspiring of all is the possibility suggested by G*y - that the two great cultures might unit9, forget- ting their differences, and co-oPerate to produce 'the greatest civilization ever known to man'. BIBLIOGRAPHY i In the present bibliography, it.has been necessary to be highly selective for reasons of space: for example, an adequate bibliography for Chapter s would obviously occupy a dozen pages. I have therefore restricted myself to books actually mentioned in tlre text, or to the essential works on any particular subject. On gestalt psychology, for example, I have mentioned only Ellis's compilation. Existential psychology and phenomenology are listed as subjects. ARoRrv, Robert.
