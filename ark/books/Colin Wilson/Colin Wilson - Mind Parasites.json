Several years back— it must have been about 1959—I had stopped at the Dorset farm of an old friend—an American named Mark Helfer. The setting of this place would have de lighted Lovecraft. The small town of Corfe Castle is little more than a village, with windi ng streets and an ancient inn that sells superb beer. The castle itsel f is an impressive ruin dating back to the eleventh century and from its ramp arts you can look out over the ‘wind blasted furze’ of Hardy’s Egdon Heath. To get to Mark Helfers’s farm, you turn under an ancient bridge, then climb a step and narrow road into the hills. And finally, on a high exposed hilltop, y ou reach the grey stone farmhouse, many hundreds of years old, with its thick wa lls and tiny windows. Its ceilings are low; the floors are of stone slabs; it has that smell of age and coldness which is not unpleasant. And then I lay in a bed at half past eleven at night, the bedside lamp flickering (for the electricity was produ ced by a dynamo that thumped away in the distance), pleasantly drunk on Marks’s home-made cider. (In England, all cider is alcoholic.) But I felt like reading before I dropped off to sleep, so I poked around the room for a book. An d apart from old bound volumes of Punch and the Illustrated London News, all I could find was a book called The Outsider and others by H. P. Lovecraft. The title interested me fo r a simple reason. Some three years earlier, I had been hurled into notoriety by the completely unexpected success of my first book, The Outsider , a rather heavy tome on ex istential philosophy. It had become an overnight best seller—to the publisher’s amazement—and was translated in sixteen languages within th e course of a year. I knew my title was not original. The Negro writer Richard Wright had written a book of the same title in the early fifties. Camus’s L’Etranger, called The Stranger in America, is translated into English as The Outsider . There are at least three more novels of the same title. Still, I fe lt that my use of the word had a certain originality, for before my book, an outsider ha d simply meant somebody who didn’t belong. (‘We can’t have that bounder in the club. He’s a demned outsidah.’) I opened the Lovecraft book—I'd never heard his name before. It was an old, black-bound edition, printed in th e late months of 1939, and it was on crumbling yellow paper that smelt must y. And before falling asleep I read The Outsider , the Rats in the Walls, and In the Vault, the story about the mortuary keeper who chops off the corpse’s feet to make it fit the coffin. I knew immediately that I had discovered a writer of some importance. So the next morning, wh en I left, I borrowed the book. And driving back towards my home in Corn wall, I brooded on the question of the horror story, and the type of imagination that produces it. I brooded to such good purpose that as soon as I got home, I began to write a book called The Strength to Dream , in which Lovecraft figures largely."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" I must confess that my estimate of Lovecraft would not have pleased his most ardent admirers. The view I expr essed in that book was that, while Lovecraft was distinctly a creative ge nius in his own way, his pessimism should not be taken too seriously: that it was the pessimism of a sick recluse and had about an element of rassentiment , a kind of desire to take revenge on a world that rejected him. In short, Lo vecraft was a 19th centu ry romantic, born in the wrong time. Most men of genius dislike their own age, but the really great ones impose their own vision on the age. The weak ones turn away into a world of gloomy fantasy. Well, the book appeared in Engla nd in 1961, and I thought I had done with Lovecraft. But later th at year, I found myself in Providence, lecturing at Brown University. There I met the Blak e scholar Foster Damon, who looks and sounds like Mark Twain, and he showed me the house where Poe had lived and told me of lege nds that still survived. But here, in this town of clapboard houses, with its streets ankl e-deep in leaves, my imagination was haunted by another writer—Lovecraft. I fo und that his stories now returned to mind a dozen times a day. I went and l ooked at the house in which Lovecraft had lived; I spent hours in the university library readi ng Lovecraft’s letters in manuscript, and a thesis that somebody had written on his life and work. Here I read for the first time The Case of Charles Dexter Ward and The Shadow Over Innsmouth. And I had to admit that there was something about Lovecraft that makes him very hard to dismi ss. In many ways, I found him more impressive than Poe. Poe’s imaginati on was simply obsessed by death. In some ways his most typical story is The Premature Burial , which is the kind of nightmare that might occur to any of us . Basically, Poe is a gentle romantic, a lover of beautiful pale women and ancient Gothic mansions set among wooded hills. Lovecraft is not so concerned w ith death as with terror. Poe is pre- Dracula; Lovecraft is very much post-Dracula. Poe’s world is the world we all live in, seen through eyes that were al ways aware of ‘the skull beneath the skin.’ Lovecraft’s world is a creation of his own, as unique and nightmarish as that of Hieronymus Bosch or Fuseli. I found the address of Arkham House in a bookseller’s catalogue, and wrote to enquire what books of Lovecraf t were still available. The result was a friendly letter back from August Derl eth who knew my work. As a result of some of Derleth’s commen ts, I made several alterations of the Lovecraft sections in the American edition of The Strength to Dream (although he still considered it unfair to Lovecraft). A nd at some point in our correspondence, Derleth said: ‘Well, if you’re so critical about Lovecraft, why don’t you write a fantasy novel, and see wh ether it’s any good. . .’ For a long time, it was only an idea floating in the ba ck of my mind. Whenever I thought about it, I always came up against the same problem—a problem that has also given some troubl e to Derleth, Robert Bloch, Donald Wandrei, and various other writers in th e HPL tradition. It is this. You begin your story with the old house or farm or whatever it is, and its queer goings-on."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Then the narrator goes to investigate. Then So mething Awful Happens—a rotting corpse knocks on the front door, a monster with tentacles on its belly tears down the wall, etc. This is inevitably the climax of the story, and it is hard to think up something that really terrifies you enough to make you terrify the reader. And then one day, when writing a chapter on ph enomenology in a book about my own kind of existentia lism, I saw the solution—monsters inside the mind. . . . The result is my first fant asy novel—and probably the only one I shall ever write. * * * But to return to Lovecraf t, I am now willing to admit that my assessment of him in The Strength to Dream was unduly harsh. But I am still no nearer to understanding why Lovecraft exercise s such a curious hold upon my imagination, when the work of Arthur Machen, for exam ple, strikes me as only mildly interesting. I suppose what makes Lovecraft both good and bad is the fact that he was an obsessed writer. And this is also the reason that so few of the works in the Lovecraft tradition have touched th e same level of imaginative power. August Derleth or Robert Bloch can capture the Arkham atmosphere and style excellently, but it doesn’t express their true centre of gravity as writers. Bloch is really himself in the all-too-possible horrors of Psycho , with its motel rooms and atmosphere of realistic nastiness su ch as you might find in the pages of any True Detective magazine. As to Derleth, his fi nest work is in a sphere far removed from horror of fantasy—books about everyday life in Sac Prairie, about the changes of season, the animals and birds. (His work reminds me in many ways of that of a much underr ated English novelist, Henry Williamson, author of Tarka the Otter, as well as of that stra nge nature mystic, Richard Jefferies.) He is a writer in the gr eat American tradition of Thoreau and Whitman—even, to some extent, of Sinclair Lewis. This explains why Lovecraft has rema ined unique, in sp ite of the number of writers who have been fascinated by his mythical world and by his style. He created the Cthulhu Mythos out of inner necessity. * * * All of this amounts to admitting that Lovecraft possesse d genius. And it is this, I think, that makes him basically a tragic figure. It also links him with my own ‘Outsider’ thesis, and with the present novel. My stating point in The Outsider was that, round about the year 1800, a strange change come over the human r ace—or over an important part of it. Quite suddenly, there appeared a new sort of man —romantic man. In the days of ancient Greeks, romantic man would have been regarded as wicked and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" dangerous. Because some deep instinct tells him that man is not a mere insect, a ‘creature,’ but is, in some important sense, a god. The Greeks called this sin hubris , and it was punishable by madness and death. And that is why the fate of so many of the romantics would have confirmed the Greeks in their view that these men were wicked and dangerous . When you come to think of it, the list of men of genius who died insane, or in accidents, or of tuberculosis, or committed suicide, is terrifying and impr essive. Shelley, Keat s, Poe, Beddoes, Holderlin, Hoffmann, Schiller, Kleist , Nietzsche, van Gogh, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Lautreamont, Do wson, Johnson, Francis Thompson, James Thomson . . . the list could be extended for page s. And these are on ly some of the famous ones. How about all the would-be poets and artists who never made the grade and died quietly in some dirty lodging house? Now all romantics have one thing in common. Th ey are like those Greek sailors who heard the Syren’s song, and prefer to fling themselves overboard rather than return to th e dull world of everyday exis tence. Or lik e the lame child in the Pied Piper who describes how, when th e Piper played, he heard a ‘joyous land,’ ‘where everything was strange and new,’ and who now spends the rest of life mourning for the lost vision. Most people seem contented to plod through commonplace lives; the romantic has glimpsed something beyond the commonplace. All ro manticism is summed up in the great sentence of Axel (in the play by Villiers de L’Isle-Adam), ‘A s for living, our servants will do that for us.’ There is a great novel by the Britis h writer L. H. Myers (who committed suicide in the 1940s) called The Near and the Far , and its opening chapter has the perfect symbol of the romantic longi ng. It takes place in India in the 16th century, and opens with the young Prince Jali standing on the tip of a palace, looking out across the desert—over wh ich he reflects that there are two deserts; one is glory to the eye; the other is a gony to the feet as you plod across it. And the two deserts never come together; if Jali goes out of the palace, seeking the desert that is so beautiful to the eye, he will encounter the other desert, the one that is a weariness to the trudge. The near and far . . . this is the basic problem of the romantics. As Yeats one said: ‘Nothing that we love overmuch is ponderable to the touch’ This is why romantics find the re al world so dreary and unpleasant. Sometimes they loathe this real worl d so much that their work becomes a paean of blasphemy, lik e the work of de Sa de or Lautremont. It is a story that is repeated over and over again. I am acquainted with the author of one of the finest supernatural novels ever written: E. H. Visiak—an old man now approaching his nineties. His Medusa is a novel of such strange power that it haunts the mind for year s after one has read it. A few weeks ago, Visiak sent me the manuscri pt of his autobiography to read. And I had not read"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" more than ten pages before I thought: ‘Yes, it’s the same thing all over again. . .’ That strange curse of the 19th cent ury. Visiak was a shy, quiet boy, the son of middle class parents, and the wo rld of his childhood was a world of enchantment. Then come his teens, and the necessity to work for a living, and ‘the shades of the prison house begin to close.’ He spent the next twenty years of his life in the telegraph office of a news agency, not very happy, leading a lonely, bookish existence. During his childhood, his happiest times had been when staying by the sea. So Visiak began to write poetry about pirates and secret islands, then produced his first novel, The Haunted Island, and then, many years later, his masterpiece, Medusa . And now, in his eighties, he is an old man whose life hasn’t been trem endously happy. He is a haunted man, another victim of the syrens’ song. Visiak’s closest friend was the novelist David Lindsay, whose Voyage to Arcturus seems to me perhaps the greatest novel of the 20th century. (This has recently been reissued in America by Macm illan.) Lindsay’s story was much the same a Visiak’s—a trem endous vision, expressed in Voyage to Arcturus and The Haunted Woman. But his contemporaries were not ready for it; he lived a life of poverty and neglect in Cornwall, and died in the forties. Lindsay possessed towering genius; Visiak’s genius is of an altogether more gentle and romantic nature. Yet both are victims of this ‘outsider tragedy’ that is so common to our ti me: men whose vision makes them unfitted for the struggle for everyday existence, but whose genius is not of the ‘commercial’ nature. These outsiders live like hermits in the midst of modern cities. If they are lucky—like Kierkegaard—they have a private income, and can write their strange, contemplative books in peace. If they are not lucky—like Lovecraft— their fate is the saddest in the world. * * * In Heartbreak House , Shaw makes Ellie Dunne state an important truth. Shotover asks her how much hi s soul eats, and she replies: ‘Oh a lot. It eats music and pictur es and books and mountains and lakes and beautiful things to wear and nice pe ople to be with. In this country, you can’t have them without lots of money: that is why our souls are so horribly starved.’ This is true. The outsider-poet is not a hermit by choice. Lovecraft declares in one of his letters that he w ould like to lounge in the sun on the deck of a yacht, looking at the shore-line of Greek islands. Men hunger for experience as they hunger for food a nd drink. And how can a man express what is best in hi m without a certain amount of co-operation from fate? Can you imagine a Shelley born in a London slum? Can you imagine a Byron born in the Gorbals of Glasgow or the Bowe ry in Lower Manhattan? It might seem that the lives of Keats, Sh elley and Byron were tragic enough in their way. But"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" at least Keats somehow managed to avoid working for a living, and spent much of his time on tours of England and Scotland. At least Shelley went to Eaton and Oxford, and spent the next ten years wandering around Europe. At least Byron had an income and was neve r short of beautiful mistresses. What about the ‘outsiders’ who are not so luc ky? The declaration of rights declares that all men have the right to a certai n freedom. But there is no declaration of rights for Outsiders that declares that th ey all have a right to the experiences that will feed their souls and allow them to realize their potentialities. This was Lovecraft's problem. He was born into a dreary provincial city—attractive enough in its way, but a painfully narrow and dull one, the Norway in which Henrik Ibsen grew up. In the northern states of America, as in England, you cannot have ‘beautiful things’ withou t having lots of money. What is more, America has always been one the worst in the world for an outsider to be born into. This is gradua lly ceasing to be true as America pours some of its surplus income into educati on and encouragement of the arts, but it was true for Lovecraft, as it had been true for Poe and Melville. What is more, Lovecraft was urgently in need of a pr ivate income or of patronage; the only patronage he received was that of Weird Tales and, to a lesser extent, of his wife during their brief marriage. We might raise the interesting question: what would have happened if Lovecraft had possessed a private income—enough, say, to allow him to spend his winters in Italy and his summer s in Greece or Sw itzerland? My own suspicion is that he would have deve loped certain traits which are already apparent in his work. He would undoubtedly have produced less, but what he did produce would have been highly polished, without the pulp magazine clichés that disfigure so much of his wo rk. And he would have given free rein to his love of curious and remote eruditi on, so that his work would have been, in some respects, closer to that of Anatole France or the contemporary Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges. (I myself have only recently discovered the tales of Borges—collected in Labyrinths and Ficciones , both available in paperbacks—and am amazed to find a livi ng writer so close to Lovecraft in spirit.) I suspect that some of the mo re horrific aspects of his work would never have developed—the actual physical horrors of the stories dealing with necrophilia or cannibalism— but that there would have been an increasing emphasis on imaginative fantasy—as typified in The Shadow Out of Time or The Call of Cthulhu. What I am suggesting is that the em phasis upon the gruesome and the violent was, to a large extent, Lovecr aft’s way of keeping himself mentally healthy in the dull, stifling atmosphere of Providence. This does not dismiss it as some form of ‘compensation’; all art is the artist’s way of keeping himself mentally healthy. But then again, the same is true of crime and sadistic violence. Blake says: ‘When thought is clos ed in cave, then love shall show its root in deepest hell.’ In other word s, when creativenes s and vitality are frustrated, they rage and become violent. Peter Kurten, the Dusseldorf sadist"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" who killed eleven people between 1927 an d 1929, admitted that his sadism had first had time to develop in long periods of solitary confinement in prison. To save himself from total boredom a nd the degradation that comes with stagnation, he developed sexual fantas ies, which had to become more and more powerful as time went by—for th e mind’s images tend to fade, like bad carbon copies, when not stimulated by a certain amo unt of reality. The same is true of de Sade. It is all very well to condemn de Sade for the nightmare horrors of Juliette and 120 Days of Sodom , but we have to remember that there is no evidence that he ever tried to put them into practice; they were the work of a man of enormous vi tality who spent much of his adult life in jail. Lovecraft also lived in a ki nd of jail for much of his life. It is a sign of his genius that, in spite of lack of money, of ill health and frustration, he still managed to create a world of such haunting poetic power. For Lovecraft was far more than a frus trated product of a rainy provincial town. He was a man whose st ruggle to find self-expression turned him into a kind of prophet or magician. In this respect, he reminds me of the Swedish dramatist Strindberg. Strindberg was also born into a frustrating provincial backwater; he also spent his life st ruggling against neglect, misunderstanding and poverty; at one point in his career, he went completely insane. Like Lovecraft, Strindberg was fascinated by the past, and by such subjects as alchemy and black magic. And towards the end of his life, he made a series of oddly accurate predictions about the 20th century, which he saw as a time of torment for the human race, particularly for the ‘outsiders’. In his last play, written in 1910, he has a Japanese who wants to commit suicide to atone for his sins, and who has decide d to take a drug that w ill make him ap pear to be dead, and then leave a note asking to be cremated. When someone asks: ‘But supposing you wake up in the furnace,’ he says, ‘I want to wake up; I want to feel the purifying flames . . .’ . But the most hair-rising part of all this is that the name of the Japanese is Hiroshima. . . . Lovecraft also seemed to have this strange insight into the future. In The Call of Cthulhu, he talks about a time when a large part of the human race seems to go insane, when nightmarish things happen, unexplainable and horrible crimes. Thirty years after Lovecraft's death, such a time has arrived. In England, a young man and woman kidnap children, torture them, and bury their bodies on the moors; in Chicago, a man forces hi s way into a hostel and kills eight nurses in long night of terro r; another youth enters a hairdresser’s shop, makes women and children lie on th e floor, and shoots them one by one in the back of the head with a revolver. When asked why he did it, he replies: ‘I wanted to get known’ . . . . Similar ‘motiveless’ crimes are happening in every country of the world. Here in Roanoke, Virginia, where I happen to be writing this, the body of a young woman was discovered a few weeks ago. She was a Catholic door to door worker, he lping to take a census. Her murderer had cut open her stomach, stuffed it with kerosene-soaked rags, and set them alight. He had apparently done this quite openly, close to a public highway,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" ignoring the risk of being caught. On e can imagine a man having various motives for killing a girl, including the obvious one of rape; by why stuff her with rags and set fire to her? I am not, of course, clai ming that Lovecraft was actually prophetic, in the sense that Nostradamus apparently was. It was simply that he was a man of genius and intelligence, who experienced the worst fears of the 20th century in a particularly virulent form. If he had been born in England a century earlier, his name could have been John Keats. He was a man whose soul needed music and pictures and books and mountains and lakes. He would also have certainly been happier if he had lived in Soho or Vienna or Prague, where he could have met other writers over a glass of cheap wi ne in sidewalk cafe. His letters to Derleth, Robert Bloch, and various ot her young writers who needed advice, reveal that he was a highly social man who longed for th e company of his equals. But he was also something of a natural aristocrat, and would have found the dreary humiliations of poverty in New York or London unbearable; he preferred the second best of his own home in Providence, where at least he could be poor with a certain amount of dignity and solitude. All this meant that he was experiencing with peculiar inte nsity the miseries that would be experienced by millions of ot her ‘outsiders’ in the course of the next hundred years.* This is why his work had a fascina tion that goes beyond its actual literary qualities, and perh aps even beyond Lovecraft’s intentions. Far more than Hemingway or Faulkner, or even Ka fka, he is a symbol of the outsider- artist in the 20th century. _________ * I reckon that ‘outsiders’ are approxi mately .5% of the total population. * * * Now that I have tried to e xplain my attitude to Lovecraf t, it should be easier to understand what I tried to do in writing The Mind Parasites. There are obvious profound differences between my own te mperament and Lovecr aft’s. I am an Englishman; I was born in to a working class background in the midlands—the English equivalent of America’s midwes t. At the age of ten, I found my outlet in science, and then, later, in the plays of Bernard Shaw and the work of T. S. Eliot and Joyce. I started writing horror stories—much influenced by Poe and Hoffmann—at the age of fourteen, I had no alternative but to work in factories—they left my mi nd free to think—and late r on, farm labouring or ditch digging. All this, I suppose, t oughened me and freed me from the outsider’s greatest enemy—his tendency to morbid self-pity. I was always as voracious a reader as Lovecraft, but my tr aining in science—I meant to go into atomic physics at one time—gave me a tendency to look for essentials in the books I read, and to retain these in me mory. The problem that interested me mainly was the problem of the outsider-a rtist in the 20th century, and of the violence that results when a stupid and materialistic society denies outlet to"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" such men—and sometimes even the right to live. There were also deeper aspects of the problem that intrigued me : for example, the strange weakness of the human mind that means that although the outsider-artist longs for freedom, he often doesn’t know what to do with it when he gets it. In fact, undiluted freedom is one of the most destructiv e corrosives ever known; it can eat away a soul in months. Spengler was ri ght when he called our age Faustian. I brought together all my researches in The Outsider , and was lucky enough to make enough mone y and reputation to be able to devote my full time to writing, with a certainty of an audience. This makes no kind of difference to my basic ob sessions. In books like Religion and the Rebel and Beyond the Outsider I continued to explore the qu estion of the outsider-artist in the 20th century and to deeper philosophi cal implications of the problem. And my novels have continue d to show what my cr itics sometimes call my ‘unhealthy preoccupation with violence.’ My first, Ritual in the Dark , was a study of sadistic killer based on Jack the Ripper and Peter Kurten. A more recent one, The Glass Cage , deals with the confrontation of a Blakeian mystic, and a murderer whose crim es are based on the Clev eland Torso murders of 1935-37, and our own Thames Nude Murders of the past three years. I have always believed that a good serious writer can use any convenient form to express his ideas. Shakesp eare could write popular comedies; Dostoyevsky produced romans policiers; Balzac launched his career with a series of crude ‘shockers.’ I have used the crime novel— Ritual and The Glass Cage —detective story— Necessary Doubt —science fiction— The Mind Parasites —and even the spy story in my latest novel The Black Room . In every case, it has been my aim to rais e the form to a level of intellectual seriousness not usually found in the genre , but never to lose sight of the need to entertain. (I have even written a volume of tongue-in-cheek pornography and diabolism— The Sex Diary of Gerard Sorme —which embodies, in fictional form, the ideas I exp ound in my phenom enological study, Origins of the Sexual Impulse .) All of this should make clear why I f eel such affinities with Lovecraft, and why the present volume contains my own partly tongue-in-cheek, partly affectionate tribute to him. It so happ ens that the Lovecraft tradition is largely my own. I feel more at ho me with books than with people, I take a great delight in adding authenticity to my fi ction by piling-in the results of my reading, and by working out elaborate myth s of metaphysical systems. So in this book I have combined Lovecraft’s preoccupation with strange unknown forces with my interest in the problem of why the human race suddenly began to produce ‘outsiders’ in such qua ntity after the French Revolution. I also realised, after I had finished th e book, that I had stolen its central idea—of mind parasites—from a science fiction story I once read. In this story, the first man to travel to Mars suddenly has an experience of some strange creature wrenching itself out of his mi nd, and hurling itself back screaming towards the earth, which is its home. Unfortunately, this story ended, in the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" rather ‘smart’ manner so characteristic of pulp science fiction, with the man landing on Mars, and immediately being possessed again by the same parasites. For some reason, writers of science fiction take a delight in pessimistic endings. (My friend A. E. Van Vogt is a remarkable exception: this is because he never ceases to be preocc upied with the problem of the superman which, like myself, he inherited from Nietzsche and Shaw.) And while I am admitting to theft (something that neve r bothers me since I feel that, like Shakespeare, I improve everything I steal), I may as well mention being impressed by a film called Forbidden Planet , which I saw in 1956, in which a scientist (played by Walter Pidgeon) conjures up—without knowing it— monsters from his ‘id,’ which destroy ev ery expedition that tries to land on the planet and ‘rescue’ hi m. Anyone wh o wishes to understand phenomenology without effort should go and see this film. The present novel has one passage to wh ich I would draw your attention: the description of Austin’s night-long battle with the mind parasites. This scene—I say with all modesty—is a tour de force , since it spends several thousand words describing a battle that takes place entirely in the mind , and in which, therefore, none of the usual cl ichés of battle scenes can be called upon. I should also add that the ghastly, flaccid writing of the opening pages was supposed to be a par ody of the Stevenson-Machen type of narrator, with perhaps a touch of Serenus Zeitblom from Mann’s Doktor Faustus . It didn’t come off; but what the hell, I’d rath er get on with another book than tinker about with it. I have also cut out a fifty thousand word extract from Karel Weissman’s Historical Reflections from the middle of th is novel; my wife felt that it slowed down the narrative. I may later publish it as a separate volume. — Colin Wilson Hollins College, Virginia Christmas 1966.

BERTRAND RUSSELL Letter to Constance Malleson, 1918, quoted in My Philosophical Development p. 261 PREFATORY NOTE We make no apology for devoting Volume III of the Cambridge History of the Nuclear Age to his new edition of that important document known as The Mind Parasites by Professor Gilbert Austin. The Mind Parasites is, of course, a composite document made up from various papers, tape recordings, and ve rbatim reports of conversations with Professor Austin. The first edition, whic h was only about half the size of the present one, was published shortly after Professor Austin’s disappearance in 2007, and before the Pallas had been found by Captain Ramsay’s expedition. It consisted mainly of the notes made at th e request of Colonel Spencer, and of the tape recording numbered 12xm, in the library of London University. The later edition that appeared in 2012 included the transc ript of the shorthand conversation taken down by Leslie Purv ison on 14 January, 2004. Inserted into these transcripts was material from tw o articles written by Austin for the Historical Review, and from his pref ace to Karel Weissman’s Historical Reflections. This new edition retains the old text in toto , and includes completely new material from the so-called Martinus File, that was for many years in the possession of Mrs Sylvia Austin, and th at is now in the World Historical Archive. The editors have made clear in the footnotes the sources from which various sections have been drawn, a nd have utilized th e still unpublished Autobiographical Notes written by Austin in 2001. No edition of the Mind Parasites can clai m to be definitive. It has been our aim to arrange the material in such a way that it forms a continual narrative. Where it was thought to be strictly relevant, material from Austin’s philosophical papers has been added, and one short pa ssage from the introduction to Homage to Edmund Husserl, edited by Austin and Reich. The resulting narrative seems, in the opinion of the editors, to suppor t the views they advanced in New Light on the Pallas Mystery. But it should be emphasi zed that this was not their aim. They have tried to include all relevant materi al, and believe that the justice of this claim will be demonstrated when Northwes tern University completes its edition of the Complete Papers of Gilbert Austin.

A story as complex as this has no obvious starting point; neither am I able to follow Colonel Spencer’s suggestion of ‘beginning at the beginning and going on to the end’, since history has a habit of meandering. The best plan is probably to tell my personal story of the battle against the mind pa rasites, and to leave the rest of the picture to the historians.

Add to this that our dinner had finished with an excellent claret of the 1980s, and it will be unders tood that I was in a most cheerful and agreeable frame of mind when I inserted my key in the front door of my flat in Covent Garden. My telescreen was ringing as I came in, but it stopped before I reached it. I glanced into the recording slot; it registered a Hampstead number that I recognized as that of Karel Weissman. It was a quarter to twelve, and I was sleepy; I decided to ring him back in the morning. But somehow, I felt uncomfortable as I undressed for bed. We were very old friends, and he frequently rang me up late at night to ask me to look something up in the British Museum (where I spent most mornings). Yet this time, some faint psychic alarm bell made me uncomfortable; I went to the screen in my dressing-gown and dialled his number. It rang for a long time; I was about to hang up when the face of his secretary appeared on the screen. He said: ‘You have heard the news?’ ‘What news?’ I asked. ‘Dr Weissman is dead.’ I was so stunned that I had to sit down. I finally mustered the wit to ask: ‘How should I have known?’ ‘It is in the evening papers.’ I told him I had only just come in. He said: ‘Ah, I see. I’ve been trying to ring you all evening. Could you possibly come up here right away?’"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" ‘But why? Is there anything I can do? Is Mrs Weissman well?’ ‘She is in a state of shock.’ ‘But how did he die?’ Baumgart said, without changing his expression: ‘He committed suicide.’ I remember staring at him blankly for several seconds, then shouting: ‘What the devil are you talking about? That's impossible.’ ‘There can be no possible doubt. Please come here as soon as you can.’ He started to remove the plug; I scr eamed: ‘Do you want to drive me mad? Tell me what happened!’ ‘He took poison. There is almost nothi ng else I can tell you. But his letter says we should contact you immediately. So please come. We are all very tired.’ I called a helicab, and then dressed in a state of mental numbness, telling myself that this was impossible. I had known Karel Weissman for thirty years, ever since we were students at Uppsala. He was in every way a remarkable man: brilliant, perceptive, patient, and of immense drive and energy. It was impossible. Such a man could never comm it suicide. Oh, I was fully aware that the world suicide rate had multiplied by fifty since the mid-century, and that sometimes the most unexpected people kill themselves. But to tell me that Karel Weissman had committed suicide was like telling me that one and one made three. He had not an atom of self-des truction in his composition. In every way, he was one of the least neurotic, be st integrated men I had ever known. Could it, I wondered, have been murder? Had he, perhaps, been assassinated by an agent of the Central Asiatic Powers? I had heard of stranger th ings; political assassina tion had become an exact science in the second part of the eigh ties, and the deaths of Hammelmann and Fuller had taught us that even a scientis t working under high security conditions is not safe. But Karel was a psychologist , and he had, as far as I knew, no connection of any kind with the government. His main income came from a large industrial corporation, who paid him to devise ways of combating dyno-neuroses and generally increasing productivity. Baumgart was waiting for me when the taxi landed on the roof. The moment we were alone, I aske d him: ‘Could it be murder?’ He replied: ‘It is not impossible, of course, but there is no reason to think so. He retired to his room at three this afternoon to write a paper, telling me that he was not to be disturbed. His window was locked, and I was sitting at a desk in the anteroom during the next two hours. At five, his wife brought tea, and found him dead. He left a letter in his ow n handwriting, and had washed down the poison with a glass of water from the toilet.’ Half an hour later, I was convinced that my friend had indeed committed suicide. The only alternative was that Ba umgart had killed him; yet I could not believe this. Baumgart had the control and impassiveness of a Swiss, but I could tell that he was deeply shaken, and on the point of an emotional breakdown; no man is a good enough actor to simulate thes e things. Besides, there was the letter"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" in Karel’s handwriting. Since Pomeroy produced the electro-comparison machine, forgery had become the rarest of crimes. I left that house of gloom at two in the morning, having spoken to no one but Baumgart. I had not seen my dead friend, and neither did I want to, for I am told that the face of one who dies from cyanide is horrible. The tablets he had used had been taken from a psycho-neurotic patient only that morning. The letter in itself was strange. It offered no word of regret for the act of self-destruction. The handwriting was shaky, but the wordi ng was precise. It stated which of his possessions was to be left to his son, and which to his wife. It asked that I should be called as soon as possible to take charge of his sc ientific papers, and mentioned a sum of money that was to be paid to me, and a further sum that was to be used, if necessary, in their public ation. I saw a photostat of the letter, the police had taken the original—and I knew that it was almost certainly genuine. Electronic analysis confirmed my view the following morning. Yes, a most strange letter. Three pages long, and written with apparent calm. But why had he suggested that I should be contacted immediately! Could it be that his papers contained the clu e? Baumgart had already considered the possibility, and had spent the evening examining them. He had found nothing there to justify Karel’s demand for hast e. A large proportion of the papers concerned the Anglo-Indian Computers Corporation, his employer; these would naturally be made available to the firm’s other research officers. The remainder were various papers on existential psyc hology, Maslovian transactionism and the rest. An almost completed book dealt with the uses of psychedelic drugs. Now, in the last named work, it seemed to me that I had found a clue. When Karel and I were at Uppsala, we spent a great deal of time discussing problems of the meaning of death, the lim its of human consciousness, and so on. I was writing a thesis on the Egyptian B ook of the Dead, whose actual title, Ru nu pert em hru, means ‘the book of comi ng forth by day’. I was concerned only with the symbolism of this ‘dark night of the soul’, of the perils encountered by the disembodied spirit on its night-long journey to Amentet. But Karel had insisted that I should study the Tibetan B ook of the Dead, an entirely different cup of tea, and compare the two. Now, as any student of these works knows, the Tibetan book is a Buddhist document whose religious background bears no resemblance whatever to that of the anci ent Egyptians. I felt that to compare the two would be a waste of time, a mere exercise in pedantry. However, Karel succeeded in stimulating in me a certain interest in the Tibetan book for its own sake, with the consequence that we sp ent many a long evening discussing it. Psychedelic drugs were at the time almost unobtainable, since Aldous Huxley’s book on mescalin had made them fashionable among addicts. However, we discovered an article by Rene Daumal describing how he had once made similar experiments with ether. Daumal had soaked a handkerchief in ether, which he then held to his nose . When he lost consciousness, his hand dropped, and he would quickly recover. Daumal attempted to describe his"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" visions under ether, and they impressed and excited us. His main point was the same as that made by so many mystic s: that although he was ‘unconscious’ under ether, he had a sense that what he experienced was far realer than his everyday experience of the world. Now, bot h Karel and I agreed on one thing no matter how dissimilar our temperaments mi ght be in others that our everyday lives had a quality of unreality. We could so well understand Chuang Tzu, who said that he had dreamed he was a butterf ly; and felt in every respect exactly like a butterfly; and that he was not certain whether he was Chuang Tzu dreaming he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Chuang Tzu. For a month or so, Karel Weissman and I tried to ‘experiment with consciousness’. Over the Christmas holida y, we tried the experiment of staying awake for three days on black coffee and cigars. The result was certainly a remarkable intensity of intellectual pe rception. I remember saying: ‘If I could live like this all the time, poetry would b ecome worthless, because I can see so much further than any poet’. We also tried experiments with ether and carbon tetrachloride. In my own cas e, these were altogether less interesti ng. I certainly experienced some enormous feeling of insight of the kind that one occasionally gets on the point of sleep but it was very brief, a nd I could not remember it afterwards. The ether gave me a headach e for days, so after two experiments I decided to give it up. Karel claimed that his own results corresponded to those of Daumal, with certain differences; I seem to remember he found the idea of rows of black dots extremely signi ficant. But he also found th e physical after-effects unsettling, and gave it up. Later, when he became an experimental psychologist, he was able to get mescalin and lyse rgic acid for the asking, and suggested several times that I should try them. But by this time I had other interests, and refused. I shall speak of these ‘other interests’ presently. This long parenthesis has been nece ssary to explain why I thought I understood Karel Weissman’s last request to me. I am an archaeologist, not a psychologist. But I was his ol dest friend, and I had once shared his interest in the problems of the outer-limits of human consci ousness. In his last moments, surely his thoughts had returned to our long night s of talk at Uppsala, to the endless lagers we had consumed in the little re staurant overlooking the river, to the bottles of schnapps drunk in my room at two in the morning? Something about it all bothered me, some faint, indefinable anxiety, of the kind that had made me ring Karel’s Hampstead house at midnight. But now there was nothing I could do about it; so I preferred to forget it. I was in the Hebrides at the time of my friend’s funeral. I had been called to examine the neolithic remains so remarkably preserved on Harris and upon my return I found several filing cabinets of material on the landing outside my flat. My head was full of thoughts of neolithic man; I glanced into the firs t drawer, looked into a folder entitled: ‘The Perception of Colour in Emoti onally Starved Animals’, and hastily slammed the drawer. Then I went into my flat and opened the Archaeological Journal, and came upon Reich’s article on the electronic dating of the basalt figurines of the Boghazkoy temple. My exci tement was intense; I rang Spence at"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" the British Museum, and rushed over to see him. For the next forty-eight hours I thought and ate and breathed nothing but Boghazkoy figurines and the distinguishing features of Hittite sculpture. This, of course, saved my life. There can be no possible doubt that the Tsathoggua ns were awaiting my return, waiting to see what I did. And luckily, my h ead was full of archaeology. My mind was floating gently in the immense seas of the past, lulled in the currents of history. Psychology was repellent to it. If I had eagerly studied my friend’s material, searching for a clue to his suicide, my own mind would have been possessed and then destroyed within hours. When I think of it now, I shudder. I was surrounded by evil, alien minds. I was like some diver at the bottom of the sea, so absorbed in contemplating the treasure of a sunken ship that I failed to notic e the cold eyes of the octopus that lay in wait behind me. In other moods, I might have noticed them, as I did later at Karatepe. But Reich’s discoveries occupied all my attention. It pushed out of my head all sense of duty to th e memory of my dead friend. I conclude that I was under fairly constant observation from the Tsathogguans for several weeks. It was dur ing this time that I realized I must return to Asia Minor if I was to cl ear up the problems raised by Reich’s criticisms of my own dating. Again, I can only feel that this decision was providential. It must have confirmed the Tsathogguans in the feeling that they had absolutely nothing to fear from me . Obviously, Karel had made a mistake; he could hardly have chosen a less suita ble executor. In fact , I felt twinges of conscience about those filing cabinets dur ing my remaining weeks in England, and once or twice forced myself to glan ce into them. On each occasion, I felt the same distaste for these matters of psyc hology, and closed them again. On the last occasion on which I did so, I remember wondering whether it would not be simpler to ask the caretaker to burn all this stuff in the basement furnace. The idea instantly struck me as utterly immoral, and I rejected it a little surprised, to be honest, to find myself entertaining it. I had no idea that it was not ‘I’ who thought the thought. * * * I have often wondered since then how far the choice of myself as executor was a part of my friend’s design, and how far it was a last minute decision made in despair. Obviously, he can have given l ittle thought to it, or they would have known. Was it, then, a sudden inspired deci sion, the last lightning flash of one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century? Or was I chosen faute de mieux ? We may know the answer one day if we can obtain access to the Tsathogguans’ archives. I like to think that the choi ce was intentional, a masterstroke of cunning. For if providence was on his side in making the choice, it was certainly on mine during the next six months, wh en I thought of a nything but Karel Weissman’s papers. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" * * * When I left for Turkey, I instructed my landlord that Baumgart was to be allowed into my flat during my absence. He had agreed to attempt a preliminary sorting of the papers. I had also ope ned negotiations with two American publishers of textbooks of psychology, who showed themselves interested in Karel Weissman’s papers. Then, for some months, I thought no more about psychology, for the problems involved in the dating of the basalt figurines absorbed my full attention. Reich had esta blished himself in the laboratories of the Turkish Uranium Company at Diyarbakir . His main concern so far, of course, had been the dating of human and anim al remains by the argon method, and in this technique he had become the fore most world authority. In turning his attention from the ages of prehistory to the reign of the Hittites, he was exploring a relatively new field as far as his own work was concerned. Man is a million years old; the Hittite i nvasion of Asia Minor occurred in 1,900 BC. For this reason, he was delighted to see me in Diyarbakir, for my own book on the civilization of the Hittites had been the standard work since its publication in 1980. For my own part, I found Reich a fascinating man. My own mind is at home in any period from 2,500 BC to the end of the tenth century AD. Reich’s mind was at home in any period from th e Carboniferous age onward, and he could speak of the Pleistocene a mere million years ago as if it were recent history. I was present once when he exam ined a dinosaur tooth, and he remarked casually that it could not possibly be as re cent as the Cretaceous age and that he would place it in the late Triassic about fifty million years earlier. I was also present when a Geiger counter verified his guess. His instinct for this kind of thing was quite uncanny. Since Reich will play a considerable part in this story, I should say something about him. Like myself, he was a big man; but unlike myself, his bigness owed nothing to surp lus fat. He had the shoulde rs of a wrestler, and an enormous, prognathous jaw. His voice alwa ys gave surprise, for it was gentle and rather high—the result, I believe, of a throat infection in childhood. But the main difference between myse lf and Reich lay in our emotional attitude towards the past. Reich was a scientist through and through. For him, figures and measurements were everythi ng; he could derive enormous pleasure from reading through a column of Geiger readings that extended over ten pages. His favourite assertion was that history should be a science. Now I have never tried to hide the powerful element of th e romantic in my composition. I became an archaeologist through an almost mys tical experience. I had been reading a volume on the civilization of Nineveh by Layard, which I had picked up casually in the bedroom of the farm at which I was staying. Some of my clothes were drying on a line in the yard, and a burst of thunder made me hurry outside to get them in. Just inside the farmyard there was a large pool of grey water, rather muddy. As I was taking the clothes from the line, my mind still in Nineveh, I"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" happened to notice this pool, and forgot, for a moment, where I was or what I was doing there. As I looked at it, the puddle lost all familiarity and became as alien as a sea on Mars. I stood staring at it, and the first drops of rain fell from the sky, and wrinkled its surface. At that moment I experienced a sensation of happiness and of insight such as I had never known before. Nineveh and all history suddenly became as real and as alien as that pool. History became such a reality that I felt a kind of contempt fo r my own existence, standing there with my arms full of clothes. For the remai nder of that evening I walked around like one in a dream. From then on, I knew I ha d to devote my life to ‘digging up the past’, and to trying to recons titute that vision of reality. It will be seen, in a moment, that all this has great relevance to my story. It meant that Reich and I had totally dissimilar attitudes towards the past, and constantly amused one another by mi nor revelations of our individual temperaments. For Reich, science containe d all the poetry of life, and the past merely happened to be the field in which he exercised his ability. As to myself, science was a servant of poetry. My ear liest mentor, Sir Charles Myers, had strengthened this attitude in me, for he had the most total contempt for all that was modern. To see him working on a digging was to see a man who had ceased to exist in the twentieth century, and who looked down on hist ory like a golden eagle from some mountain peak. He had a shuddering distaste for most human beings; he once complained to me that most of them seemed ‘so unfinished and shabby’. Myers made me feel that the true historian is a poet rather than a scientist. He once said that the contempl ation of individual men made him dream of suicide, and that he could rec oncile himself to being human only by considering the rise and fall of civilizations. During those first weeks at Diyarbak ir, when the rainy season made it impossible for us to do field work on th e Karatepe diggings, we had many long discussions during the evenings, while Reic h drank beer by the pint and I drank a most excellent local brandy. (Even here the differences in our temperaments revealed themselves!) Now it happened that one evening, I re ceived a letter from Baumgart. It was very brief. He stated simply that he had discovered certain papers in Weissman’s filing cabinets that convinced him that Weissman had been insane for some time before his suicide: that Weissman had believed that ‘they’ were aware of his efforts, and would try to destroy him. Baumgart said that it was clear from the context that ‘they’ did not refer to human beings. He had therefore decided not to go ahead with his negotia tions for the publication of Weissman’s psychological papers; he would leave it for my return. Naturally, I was puzzled and intrigue d. It happened that Reich and I had reached a certain point in our work wher e we felt we had a right to rest and congratulate ourselves; so our talk that evening was concerned entirely with Weissman’s ‘madness’ and suicide. During the early part of the discussion, there were also present two of Reich’s Turkish colleagues from Izmir, and one of them mentioned the curious fact that the suicid e rate in the rural areas of Turkey had"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" risen in the past ten years. This surprised me; for while the urban suicide rate had increased steadily in most countries, the country populatio ns, on the whole, seemed immune from the virus. This led one of our guests, Dr Omer Fu’ad, to tell us about the researches that his department had been conducting into the suicide ra te of the ancient Egyptians and Hittites. The later Arzawa ta blets mention an epidemic of suicide in the reign of King Mursilis the Se cond (1334-1306 BC), and give the figures for Hattusas. Strangely enough, the Meneth o papyri, discovered in 1990 in the monastery at Es Suweida, also mention an epidemic of suicide in Egypt in the reign of Haremhab and Sethos the First, covering approximately the same period (1350-1292 BC). His companion, Dr Muhammed Darga, was an admirer of that strange piece of historical charlatanism, Spengler’s Decline of the West, and proceeded to argue that such epidemics of suicide could be predicted accurately according to the age of the civilization and its degree of urbanization. He went on to evolve some farfetched metaphor about biological cells and their tendency to ‘die voluntarily’ when the body has lost its ability to be stimulated by the environment. Now all this struck me as nonsense, since the civilization of the Hittites was barely 700 years old in 1350 BC, while that of the Egyptians was at least twice as old. And Dr Darga had a rather dogmatic manner of stating his ‘facts’ that annoyed me. I became rath er heated—the brandy may have had something to do with it—and challenged our guests to produce facts and figures. They said, very well, they would and would submit them to the judgment of Wolfgang Reich. And, having to fly back to Izmir, they took their leave fairly early. Now Reich and I engaged in a discussion that sticks in my mind as the true beginning of the story of the fight agai nst the mind parasites. Reich, with his clear, scientific intelligence, quickly summ arized the pros and cons of our earlier arguments, and allowed that Dr Darga seemed to have little gift for scientific detachment. Reich then went on: ‘Cons ider the facts and figures that are available to us about ou r own civilization. How much do they actually tell us? These suicide figures, for example. In 1960, a hundred and ten people of every million committed suicide in England—a doubling of the rate since a century earlier. By 1970, this rate had doubled again, and by 1980, it had multiplied by six.’ Reich had an astonishing mind; he seem ed to have stored all the important statistics of the century in it. Now usually , I detest figures. But as I listened to him, something happened to me. I felt a t ouch of coldness inside me, as if I had suddenly become aware of the eyes of so me dangerous creature. It passed in a moment, but I found myself shuddering. Re ich asked: ‘Cold?’ I shook my head. And when Reich stopped talking for a while, to stare out of the window at the lighted street below us, I found myself saying: ‘When all’s been said, we know almost nothing about human life.’ He sa id cheerfully: ‘We know enough to be getting on with, and that’s all you can expect.’"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" But I could not forget that feeling of co ldness. I said: ‘After all, civilization is a kind of dream. Supposing a man suddenly woke up from that dream? Wouldn’t it be enough to make him commit suicide?’ I was thinking about Karel Weissman, and he knew it. He said: ‘But what about these delusions about monsters?’ I had to agree that this failed to fit my theory. But I could not shake off the cold touch of depression that had se ttled on me. What is more, I was now definitely afraid. I felt that I had seen something that I could not forget to which I would have to return. And I felt that I could easily slide downhill into a state of nervous terror. I had drunk half a bottle of brandy, yet now I felt horribly sober, coldly aware that my body was slightly drunk, yet unable to identify with it. The idea that came to me was terrible. It was that the suicide rate was increasing because thousands of human beings were ‘awakening’, like me, to the absurdity of human life, and simply refused to go on. The dream of history was coming to an end. Mankind was already starting to wake up; one day it would wake up properly, and there would be mass suicide. These thoughts were so awful that I was tempted to go back to my room and brood on them. Yet I forced myself, against my will, to express them to Reich. I don’t think he fully understood me, but he saw that I was in a dangerous condition, and with inspired in sight, he said the exact words that were necessary to restore my peace of mind. What he bega n to talk about was the strange part that coincidence had played in archaeol ogy; coincidence that would be too wild to use in fiction. He talked of how George Smith had journeyed from London with the absurd hope of finding the clay ta blets that would complete the epic of Gilgamesh, and how he had, in fact, f ound them. He talked of the equally ‘impossible’ story of Schliemann’s disc overy of Troy, of Layard’s finding of Nimrud as if some invisible thread of destiny had pulled them towards their discovery. I had to admit that, more than any other science, archaeology inclines one to believe in miracles. He followed it up swiftly: ‘But if you can agree with that, then surely you must see that you’re mistaken in thinking that civilization is a kind of dream or a nightmare? A dream appears to be logica l while it lasts, but when we wake up we see that it had no logic. You are sugge sting that our illusions impose a similar logic on life. Well, the stories of Layard, Schliemann, Smith, Champollion, Rawlinson, Bossert, contradict you flatly. They really happened. They are real life stories that make use of outrageous coincidence in a way that no novelist would risk...’ He was right, and I had to agree. And when I thought of that strange destiny that had guided Schliemann to Troy, Layard to Nimrud, I recollected similar examples from my own life—for exam ple, of my first major ‘find’ of the parallel texts in Phoenician, proto-Hattian and Ka nisic at Kadesh. I still remember my overwhelming sense of desti ny, of the ‘divinity that shapes our ends’, or at least, in some mysteri ous law of chance that came over me as I scraped the earth from those clay tablets. For I knew, at least half an hour before"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" I found those texts, that I was going to make a remarkable discovery that day; and when I stuck my spade in a casually chosen spot, I had no fear that it would prove to be a waste of time. In less than ten minutes, Reich had talked me back into a state of optimism and sanity. I did not know it, but I ha d won my first battle against the Tsathogguans. (Editor’s note: from this point onward, the tape recording is being supplemented by professor Austin’s Aut obiographical Notes, by kind permission of the Librarian of Texas University. Thes e notes have been p ublished separately by the University in professor Austin’s Miscellanies. I have attempted to use the notes only to expand material mentioned in the tape record ing, which continues for another ten thousand words or so.) * * * The luck of the god of Archaeology wa s certainly with me that spring. Reich and I worked together so well that I decided to take a flat in Diyarbakir and remain there for at least a year. And in April, a few days before we set out for the Black Mountain of Karatepe, I received a letter from Standard Motors and Engineering, Karel Weissman’s former employers, saying that they would like to return a great many of Wei ssman’s papers to me, and enquiring as to my present whereabouts. I replied that letters would reach me care of the Anglo-Indian Uranium Company at Diyarbak ir, and that I would be grateful if they would return Weissman’s papers to my London address, or to Baumgart, who was still in Hampstead. When Professor Helmuth Bossert firs t approached Kadirli, the nearest ‘town’ to the Black Mountain of the Hi ttites, in 1946, he ha d a difficult journey over muddy roads. In those days, Kadirli was a tiny provincial town with no electricity. Today it is a comfortable but quiet little town with two excellent hotels, and within an hour’s reach of London by rocket plane. The trip from there to the Black Mountain, Karatepe, cost Bo ssert another arduous day’s travel over shepherds’ paths overgrown with prickl y broom. We, in our own helicopter, reached Kadirli in an hour from Diyarb akir, and Karatepe in a further twenty minutes. Reich’s electronic equipment had already been brought by transport plane forty-eight hours earlier. I should, at this point, say something about the purpose of our expedition. There are many mysteries attached to the ‘Black Mountain’, which is part of the Anti-Taurus mountain range. The so-calle d Hittite Empire collapsed in about 1200 BC, overcome by hordes of barbaria ns, prominent among whom were the Assyrians. Yet the Karatepe remains date from five hundred ye ars later, as do those at Carchemish and Zinjirli. What happened in those five hundred years? How did the Hittites succeed in preserving so much of their culture through such"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" a turbulent time, when its northern capital Hattusas was in the hands of the Assyrians? This was the problem to whic h I had devoted ten years of my life. I had always believed that further cl ues might lie deep under the ground, in the heart of the Black Mountain—just as deep excavations into a mound at Boghazkoy had revealed tombs of a hi ghly civilized people a thousand years older than the Hittites. My excavations in 1987 had, in fact, turned up a number of strange basalt figurines, whose carving differed strikingly from the Hittite sculptures found on the surface—the fam ous bulls, lions and winged sphinxes. They were flat and angular; there was so mething barbaric about them and yet not in the manner of African sculptures, w ith which they have occasionally been compared. The cuneiform symbols on thes e figures were distinctively Hittite, rather than Phoenician or Assyrian, yet, if it had not been for these, I would have guessed that the figures came from a completely different culture. The hieroglyphs in themselves presented another problem. Our knowledge of the Hittite language has been fairly comprehensive since the researches of Hrozny, yet there are still many lacunae. These tend to occur in texts dealing with religious ritual. (We could imagine, for ex ample, some archaeologist of a future civilization being baffled by a copy of the Catholic mass, with its sign of the cross and odd abbreviations.) In that case, we su rmised, the symbols on the basalt figures must deal almost entirely with religious ritual, for about seventy- five percent of them were unknown to us. One of the few statements we could read was: ‘Before (or below) Pitkhanas dwelt the great old ones’. Another read: ‘Tudaliyas paid homage to Abhoth the Dark ’. The Hittite symbols for ‘dark’ may also signify ‘black’, ‘unclean’ or ‘untouchable’ in the Hindu sense. My finds had excited considerable comment in the world of archaeology. My own first view was that the figurin es belonged to another proto-Hattian culture (i.e. the forerunners of the Hitt ites), that differed considerably from the one discovered at Boghazkoy, and from which the Hittites took over their cuneiform. Pitkhanas was an early Hittite ru ler of about 1900 BC. If my surmise was correct, then the inscription meant that before Pitkhanas th ere lived the great proto-Hattians from whom the Hittites de rived their script. (‘ Below’ could also signify that their tombs were below those or Hittites, as at Boghazkoy.) As to the reference to Tudaliyas, another Hittite ruler of about 1700 BC, it again seemed likely that the Hittites had derived some of their religi ous ritual from the proto- Hattians, of whom ‘Abhoth the Dark’ (or unclean) was a god. * * * This, I say, was my original interpretation: that the Hittites had taken over parts of the religion of their pr edecessors at Karatepe, and had made inscriptions upon Hattian figurines to this effect. But the more I considered the evidence (which is too complex to detail here), the more I was inclined to believe that the figurines helped to explain how Karatepe remained an island of culture long after the fall of the Hittite empire. What force will k eep invaders at bay over a long period?"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Not, in this case, the force of arms; the evidence at Karatepe reveals an artistic, not a military culture. Sheer indifferenc e? Why should they be indifferent? Through Karatepe, Zinjirli and Carchemish la y the road to the south, to Syria and Arabia. No; it seemed to me there was only one force strong enough to hold back an ambitious and warlike nation: superstitious fear. Surely the power of Karatepe and its neighbours was the power of so me mighty religion, some religion of magic? Possibly Karatepe was a rec ognized centre of magical culture, like Delphi. Hence those strange reliefs of bird-headed men, of strange, beetle-like creatures, of winged bulls and lions? Reich disagreed with me, and his disagreement was based upon his dating of the figurines. He claimed that, in spite of their excellent st ate of preservation, they were many thousands of years older than the proto- Hattian culture. He later verified this beyond all doubt with the us e of his ‘neutron dater’. Well, I was willing to be corrected; I was not entire ly happy with my own provisional dating of the figurines. But an immense problem remained. As far as we know, there was no civilization whatever in Asia Minor before 3000 BC. Further south, civilization dates back to 5000 BC; but not in Turkey. So who made the figurines, if not the proto-Hattians? Did they come fr om further south? If so, where? During the first two months that I spen t with him, Reich continued to work on his ‘neutron dater’, and used my figurin es as basic testing material. But here absurd difficulties arose. The dater show ed itself remarkably accurate with samples of potsherd from Sumer and Babylon, where we had a means of cross- checking its results. But they had little su ccess with the figurines. At least, their results were so extraordinary as to be obviously inaccurate. The neutron beam was directed at minute fragments of stone dust in the cracks and hollows of the figurines. From the ‘weathering’ and decay of these fragments, the dater should have been able to give us a rough estimate of how long ago the basalt was carved. It failed completely; the needle of the indicator swung to its furthest remit about 10,000 BC! Reich talked about increasing the range of the indicator, simply out of curiosity, to see what date it would finally arri ve at. In fact, he actually doubled its range, by some fairly simple adjustments. The needle still rang to its limit with th e same unhesitating speed. It was scoring insane, and Reich began to wonder if he had made some elementary error. Perhaps the dust had not been produced by carving? In which case, the dater was attempting to give us the age of the basalt itself! At all events, Reich left his assistants the task of constructing a dial that would s how anything up to a million years—an immense task that would take most of the summer. And then we made our expedition to Karatepe, to try to in vestigate the problem at its source. * * * Yes... the source of the problem. How incred ible it now seems as I tell the story! How is it possible to believe in simple ‘coincidence’ in the light of these facts?"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" For my two problems were converging: th e problem of my fri end’s suicide, and the problem of the basalt figurines. When I think b ack upon that summer, it is impossible to believe in a materialistic historical determinism. Let me try to place the events in their order. We arrived at Kadirli on April 16th. On the 17th, we established a cam p at Karatepe. Admittedly, there was nothing to stop us from commuting between Karatepe and our comfortable hotel at Kadirli. But our workmen had to stay in the nearest villag e, and we decided that it might be better if we spent most of our time at the site of the excavation. Besides, all the romantic in me revo lted at the idea of leaving the second millennium and plunging back into the la te twentieth century every evening. So we set up our tents on a level space of ground near the top of the mound. From below us came the perpetual roar of the Pyramus river, with its swirling yellow waves. The electronic probe was set up on top of the mound. I should say a word about this instrument—Reich 's invention—that has since revolutionized the scie nce of archaeology . Fundamentally it is no more than an X-ray, whose principle is similar to that of the mine detector. But a mine detector is only able to detect metal, and an X-ray will onl y be stopped by some hard, opaque body. Since the earth itself is hard and opaque, the old X-ray principle was of no use in archaeology. Moreover, the things that interest archaeologists—stones, earthenware and the rest—have more or less the same molecular structure as the surrounding ear th, so they would hardly show up on an X-ray plate. Reich’s modification of the electronic laser would penetrate to a depth of three miles, and its principle of ‘neutron feedback’ meant that it immediately indicated any object of regul ar shape—a stone slab, for example. The only problem then was to dig down to the object, and this could be done fairly easily with our robot ‘moles’. It should not be difficult to imagine my state of excite ment on the day we set out for Karatepe. Fifteen years of hard digging had failed to reveal any more basalt figurines, or to yield any clue to their source. The sheer volume of earth to be excavated made the problem apparently insoluble. Reich’s invention solved it with a beautiful simplicity. And yet, for the first three days, th e results were disappointing. A probe taken directly below the old diggings re vealed nothing. A further half day was occupied in moving the probe to another site a hundred yards away. This time I was certain that something would be re vealed and I was mistaken. Reich and I looked gloomily at the plain below us , then at the enormous bulk of the electronic probe, and wondered how many times it would have to be moved before we made a ‘find’. On the third evening, we received a visit from our two Turkish colleagues, Fu’ad and Darga. We decided to fly back into Kadirli for a meal at the hotel. Our feelings of irritability due to our suspicion that they were there to spy on us for the Turkish government soon vanished, fo r they were both full of warmth, sympathy and eager questionings. After an excellent meal and some good claret, the day’s disappointments seemed less impor tant. Afterwards, we retired to the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" visitors’ lounge, which we had to our selves, and drank Turkish coffee and brandy. It was at this poi nt that Dr Muhammed Da rga revived the topic of suicide. He had come armed with facts a nd figures this time. I shall not attempt to detail the discussion that followed—it went on until well after midnight—but it certainly seemed to indicate that Da rga’s theories about ‘biological decay’ were not as wild as they sounded. How, said Darga, could we account for this tremendous rise in the world suicide rate if we stuck to our view that it was simply a matter of ‘civilization neurosis’? Too much security, lack of real pur pose? But there was still plenty of ‘challenge’ in the modern world, and psychology had made tremendous advances in the past fifty years. The crime rate was far below what we might expect from the world’s overcrowding. In the first half of the twentieth century, the crime rate and the suicide rate had risen together. So why had the crime rate dropped while the suicide rate had increased so dramatically? It wasn’t good sense. Suicide and crime had always been connected in the past. In the first half of the twentieth century, the high suicide rate was partly due to crime, since one third of all murderers committed suicide. No, said Darga, this was a matter of some strange law of historical decay that only Spengler had suspected. Individual men are merely ce lls in the great body of civ ilization; and, as with the human body, the rate of decay in creases steeply with age... I had to admit that he had me more than half convince d. At half past midnight, the four of us parted on the best of terms, and our two helicopters separated in the moonlight above Kadirli. We were ba ck at the excavation by one o’clock. It was a beautiful night. The air was fu ll of the scent of asphodel, which the Greeks called the flower of the underworl d, and of the distin ctive odour of the shrubs that grew over the hill. The only sound was the churning of the river. The mountain peaks reminded me of my first trip to the moon; they had the same detached, dead beauty. Reich went into his tent; he was s till brooding on Darga’s statistics. I walked up the hill, and into one of the chambers of the upper gate. Then I climbed the stairs to the top of the wall, and stood there looking out over the moonlit plain. I admit that my mood was ro mantic, and that I experienced a need to intensify it. So I stood there, hardly breathing, thinking of the dead sentries who had stood where I now stood, and of the days when only the Assyrians lay on the other side of those mountains. All at once, my thoughts took a gloomy turn. I felt totally insignificant, meaningless, standing there. My life was the tiniest ripple on the sea of time. I felt the alienness of the world around me, the indifference of the universe, and a kind of wonder at the absurd persistenc y of human beings whose delusions of grandeur are incurable. Suddenly it seemed that life was no more than a dream. For human beings, it never became a reality. The loneliness was unbearable . I wanted to go and talk to Reich, but the light in his tent had gone out. I felt in my upper pocket for a handkerchief, and"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" my hand encountered a cigar that I had accepted from Dr Fu’ad. I had taken it as a ritual gesture of friendliness, for I am almost a non-smoker. Now its smell seemed to take me back to the human world, and I decided to light it. I cut off its end with a penknife, and pierced the ot her end. As soon as I took the first mouthful of smoke, I regretted it. It tast ed foul. I placed it on the wall beside me, and continued to stare out over the valley. After a few minutes, its pleasant smell led me to take it up again. This time I took several more deep pulls at it, swallowing the smoke. My forehead felt dam p, and I had to lean on the wall. For a while I was afraid I was about to vom it and waste my excellent supper. Then the nausea passed, but the feeli ng of disembodiment persisted. At this point, I looked at the moon again and was suddenly overwhelmed with an inexpressible fear. I felt li ke a sleepwalker who wakes up and finds himself balancing on a ledge a thousand feet above the ground. The fear was so immense that I felt as if my mind would dissolve; it seemed impossible to bear. I tried hard to fight it, to understand its cau se. It was connected with this world I was looking at with the real ization that I was a mere object in a landscape. This is extremely difficult to make clear. Bu t I suddenly seemed to see that men manage to stay sane because they see the world from their own tiny, intensely personal viewpoint, from their worm’s eye view. Things impress them or frighten them, but they still see them fr om behind this windshield of personality. Fear makes them feel less important, but it does not negate them completely; in a strange way, it has the opposite effect, for it intensifies their feeling of personal existence. I suddenly seemed to be taken out of my personality, to see myself as a mere item in a universal landscape, as unimportant as a rock or fly. This led to the second stage of the e xperience. I said to myself: ‘But you are far more than a rock or a fly. You are not a mere object. Whether it is an illusion or not, your mind contains knowledge of all the ages. Inside you, as you stand here, there is more knowledge than in the whole of the British Museum, with its thousand miles of bookshelves’. This thought, in a sense, was new to me. It led me to forget the landscape, and to turn my eyes inside myself. And a question presented itself. If space is infinite, how about the space inside man? Bl ake said that eternity opens from the centre of an atom. My former terror vanished. Now I saw that I was mistaken in thinking of myself as an object in a dead landscape. I had been assuming that man is limited because his brain is limited, that only so much can be packed into the portmanteau. But the spaces of the mind are a new dimension. The body is a mere wall between two infinities. Space extends to infinity outwards; the mind stretches to infinity inwards. It was a moment of revelation, of ove rwhelming insight. But as I stood there, totally oblivious of the outside worl d, straining all my powers to stare into those inner spaces, something happened that terrified me. This is almost impossible to describe. But it seemed that, out of the corner of my eye—the eye of attention that was turned inward—I caught a movement of some alien"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" creature. It was a strange shock, the feeling you would ge t if you were relaxed in a warm bath, and you suddenly felt a slimy movement against your leg. In a moment, the insight had passed. And as I looked at the mountain peaks above me, and at the moon sailing over them, I felt a thrill of pleasure, as if I had just returned home from the other end of the universe. I felt dizzy and very tired. All this had taken less than five minutes. I turned and walked back to my tent, and tried to look inside myself again. For a moment, I succeeded. This time, I felt nothing. But when I was wrapped up in my sleeping bag, I found that I no l onger wanted to sleep. I would have preferred to talk to Reich, or to anyone . I had to express what I had suddenly realized. Man assumes that his inner worl d is private. ‘The grave’s a fine and private place’ said Marvell, and we have the same feeling about the mind. In the real world, our freedom is limited; in im agination, we can do anything we like; what is more, we can defy the world to penetrate the secret; the mind is the most private place in the universe; sometimes, perhaps, too private. ‘We each think of the key, each in his prison’. And the whole difficulty of treating madmen is to break into that prison. Yet I could not fo rget that feeling of something alien inside my mind. Now I thought back on it, it did not seem so te rrifying. After all, if you walk into your own room, expectin g it to be empty, and you find someone there, your first response is fear: it coul d be a burglar. But this soon passes. Even if it is a burglar, you confront him as a reality, and that orig inal flash of fear passes away. What was so alarming was that feeling of something or someone inside my own head, so to speak. As my mind lost its fear , and became simply interested in the problem, I felt sleepy. One of my last thoughts before I fell asleep was to wonder if this was some kind of hallucination due to the Turkish coffee and the cigar. When I woke at seven the next morn ing, I knew it wasn’t. The memory of that sensation was curiously clear. And ye t, let me confess, it now aroused a kind of excitement in me rather than terror. This should be easy enough to understand. The everyday world demands our attention, and prevents us from ‘sinking into ourselves’. As a romantic, I have always resented this; I like to sink into myself. The problems and anxieties of living ma ke it difficult. Well, now I had an anxiety that referred to something inside me, and it reminded me that my inner world was just as real and im portant as the world around me. At breakfast, I was tempted to talk to Reich about it all. Something withheld me—the fear, I suppose, that he would simply fail to understand. He remarked that I seemed abstracted, and I said that I’d made the mistake of smoking Darga’s cigar and that was all. That morning, I supervised the moving of the electronic probe to a place further down the mound. Reich went back to his tent to try to devise some easier method for moving the thing—a cushion of air underneath, for example, on the hovercraft principle. The workmen shifted the probe to a position halfway down the mound, below the lower gate. The n, when it was ready, I took my seat,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" adjusted the controls on the screen, and pulled the starter. Almost instantly, I knew I had struck something. The white lin e that ran from the top to the bottom of the screen showed a distinct bul ge halfway down. When I cut the power, increasing the feedback, this immediately spread into parallel horizontal lines. I sent the foreman to fetch Reich, and pro ceeded to move the control cautiously, probing around the regular object in all dire ctions. The screen showed that there were more of these objects to the left and right of it. This, of course, was my first experi ence of discovering anything with the probe, so I had no idea of the size of the object I had found, or of its depth below the ground. But when Reich came running over a moment later, he took one look at the dial, another at th e controls, and said: ‘Oh Ch rist, the bloody thing’s gone wrong.’ ‘In what way?’ ‘You must have twisted th e control too far, and disconnected something. According to this, the object you've located is two miles below the ground and seventy feet high!’ I climbed off the seat rather ruefully. It is true that I have no ability to deal with mechanical appliances. New cars break down within hours when I drive them; machines that have never given the slightest trouble blow a fuse as soon as I approach. In this case, I had no cons ciousness of having done anything wrong, but I felt guilty all the same. Reich unscrewed a plate and looked in side. He said there was nothing obviously wrong, and that he would have to test all the circuits after lunch. When I apologized, he slapped me on the shoulder. ‘Never mind. We’ve found something anyway. Now all we’ve got to discover is how deep it lies.’ We ate a good cold lunch. Then Reich rushed off to his machine. I took an air mattress, and went and lay down in th e shadow of the lion gate, to make up for lost sleep. And I slept deeply and peacefully for two hours. When I opened my eyes, I saw Reich standing beside me, staring out across the river. I looked at my watch, and sat up hastily. ‘Why on earth didn’t you wake me?’ He sat down on the ground beside me. His manner struck me as subdued. ‘What is it? Can’t you trace the fault?’ He looked at me thoughtfully. ‘There is no fault.’ I failed to understand. ‘You mean it’s repaired?’ ‘No. There never was any fault.’ ‘Well, that’s cheering. What went wrong then?’ ‘That’s what bothers me. Nothing went wrong.’ ‘No? In that case, you know how deep this thing is?’ ‘Yes. It’s as deep as th e gauge showed. Two miles.’ I restrained my excitement; stranger things had happened. ‘Two miles,’ I said. ‘But that’s qui te a distance below the foundations of this hill. I mean... that kind of depth ought to take us down to archaeozoic rocks.’ ‘That depends. But I’m inclined to agree with you.’"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" ‘Besides, if it’s accurate about the de pth, it’s presumably accurate about the size of the blocks seventy feet high. Th at sounds a trifle unlikely. Even the building blocks of the great pyramid aren’t that size.’ Reich said good-humouredly: ‘My d ear Austin, I agree with you completely. The thing is impossible. But I have checked every circuit in the machine. I don’t see how I could be mistaken.’ ‘There’s only one way to find out: send a mole down.’ ‘Which is what I was about to suggest . However, if it’s really two miles down, the mole is of no use.’ ‘Why?’ ‘To begin with, because it was never intended to cut through rock—only through earth or clay. It’s bound to encounter rock at that depth. Second, because even if there’s no rock at that depth, th e pressure of the earth would destroy the mole: it would be like being two miles under the sea. The pressure would be thousands of pounds to the square inc h. And since the temperature rises by a hundred degrees to a mile, it could also be too hot for its electrical equipment.’ The sheer size of the problem now struck me. If Reich was correct, we could never hope to unearth the ‘obj ects’ down there—objects that were obviously part of a wall of a city, or of a temple. With all our modern engineering efficiency, we had no machines capable of working at that temperature and pressure, and raisin g enormous blocks for two miles. Reich and I returned to the probe, disc ussing this problem. If the probe was correct—and Reich seemed to think it was—then it set archaeology an extraordinary problem. How on earth could remains sink to this depth? Perhaps the whole tract of land ha d subsided in some eruption and collapsed into an abyss underneath? Then perhaps the hollow had been filled with water and mud... But mud to a depth of two miles! How many thousands of years would that take? We both felt as if we were goi ng insane. It was a temptation to rush to the telephone and consult coll eagues, but the fear of ha ving made some absurd mistake held us back. By five o’clock, we had the mole rea dy to launch, its nose pointing straight downwards. Reich operated the remote c ontrol panel, and its bullet-like nose began to revolve. Earth sprayed, then sett led into a small, loose pile. For a few moments, the pile quivered. Then there was no sign of the mole. I went across to the radar screen. At its top, a brilliant white dot seemed to tremble. As we watched, it moved down slowly, very slowly, slower than the minute hand of a watch. Next to the rada r screen, a kind of television screen showed only wavy lines that looked as if they were made of smoke. Occasionally, these lines became thinner in places, or vanished altogether; this was when the mole encountered a rock. If it encountered any object that was more than ten feet across, it would stop automatically, and the electronic laser would scan its surface. An hour later, th e white dot had moved halfway down the screen—a depth of about a mile. It was now moving slower. Reich went to the probe, and set it going. Its scr een registered the mole at a mile down. And still in"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" the same position, further down the screen showed the enormous blocks. The probe was accurate. Now we all felt the tension. The workmen were standing in a group, their eyes fixed on the radar screen. Reich had switched off the probe, since its beam could damage the mole. We were risking damaging an expensive piece of equipment, yet we could see no alternative. We had checked and rechecked the probe. It indicated unmistakably that the im mense blocks were of a more or less regular shape, and were rest ing side by side. It was impo ssible that they could be natural rocks. Neither was it inevitable that we s hould lose the mole. Its electronically fortified metal would withstand a temperature of two t housand degrees; its makers had assumed that it might encounter veins of volcanic lava. The strength of its shell was enormous; the makers guara nteed that it could stand a pressure of two and a half tons to the square inch. Bu t if it reached the blocks at a depth of two miles, it would be supporting about twice that weight, or very nearly. Besides, its transmitting equipment might not stand the temperature. And then there was always the possibility that it might pass beyond the range of the remote control, or sustain damage to its receiver. By half past eight, night was falling, and the mole had traversed another half of the distance. The blocks were onl y half a mile below it. We had told the workmen to go home, many of them stayed. Our cook prepared us a meal from tins; he was obviously in no conditi on to cook anything elaborate. When the night came down, we sat there in the dark, listening to the faint hum of the radar equipment, and watching the brilliant white dot. Sometimes, I became convinced that it had stopped. Reic h, whose eyes were better than mine, assured me that it hadn’t. By half past ten, the last of the workmen had gone home. I wrapped myself up in a dozen bl ankets, for the wind had risen. Reich chain-smoked; even I smoked two ciga rettes. Suddenly, the humming stopped. Reich leapt to his feet. He said: ‘It’s there.’ ‘Are you sure?’ I found that my voice had become a croak. ‘Absolutely. The position’s right. It ’s now directly over the blocks.’ ‘What now?’ ‘Now we activate the scanner.’ He started the machine again. Now our eyes were fixed on the television screen. It was blank, indi cating that the scanner was trained on a massive and hard object. Reich adjusted the controls . The wavy lines bega n to reappear, but they were now thinner and straighter. Re ich made some adjustment that brought them closer together, until the whole su rface of the screen became a pattern of fine white and black lines, like a pair of pin-striped trousers. And showing very clearly against this pattern of lines there were a number of black scars, indentations in the rock. The excitement of the past few hours had been so great that I was able to look at these wit hout strong emotion. It was impossible to"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" doubt what they were. I had seen them many times before on the basalt figurines. I was looking at the symbols that repr esented the name of Abhoth the Dark. There was nothing more to be done. We photographed the screen, then went back to Reich’s tent to radio Darga at Izmir. Within five minutes, Reich was speaking to him. He explained the si tuation, apologized for the risk we had taken with the mole which belonged to th e Turkish government and told him that we had definitely establis hed that these blocks bel onged to the culture of the ‘great old ones’ mentioned on one of the figurines. Darga, I suspect, was a little drunk. The situation had to be explained to him at length before he understood. Then he proposed fetching Fu’ad and flying over to join us immediately. We convin ced him there would be no point, as we were about to go to bed. He said that we should move the mole along to scan the next blocks. Reich pointed out that this was impossi ble. It could not move sideways, only forwards and backwards; it would have to be withdrawn a hundred feet or so, and re-directed. This would take several hours. Finally, we convinced Darga, and broke the connection. We were both a ppallingly tired, yet neither of us felt like sleep. The cook had left equipment for making coffee. Against our better judgment, we used it, and opened a bottle of brandy. It was there, sitting in Reich’s tent at midnight, on the 21st of April, 1997, that I told Reich about my experience of the night before . I started to tell him, I think, to distract our minds from the probl em of those seventy-foot blocks below the ground. In this, I succeeded. For, to my surprise, Reich found nothing strange in what I had to say. At university, he had studied the psychology of Jung, and was familiar with the idea of a ‘racial unconscious’. If there was a racial unconscious, then human minds are not separa te islands, but are all part of some great continent of mind. He had read a great deal more psychology than I had. He cited the work of Aldous Huxley, w ho had taken mescalin sometime in the 1940s, and had also reached my own c onclusion that the mind stretches for infinity inside us. Huxley, apparently, had gone further, in a way, and spoken of the mind as a world of its own, like the world we live on—a pl anet with its own jungles and deserts and oceans. And on this planet as one would expect there live all kinds of strange creatures. At this point, I objected. Surely Huxley’s talk about strange creatures was only a meta phor, a piece of poetic license? The ‘inhabitants’ of the mind are memories and ideas, not monsters. At this, Reich shrugged. ‘How do we know?’ ‘I agree, we don’t. But it seems common sense.’ I thought about my experi ence of the night before , and felt less sure of myself. Was it ‘common sens e’? Or have we got into a habit of thinking about the human mind in a certain way as our ancestors thought of the earth as the centre of the universe? I speak of ‘my mind’ as I speak of ‘my back garden’. But in what sense is my back garden really ‘mine’? It is full of worms and insects who do not ask my permission to live there. It will continue to exist after I am dead... "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" * * * Oddly enough this train of thought had the effect of making me feel better. It explained my anxiety or seemed to. If individuality is an illusion, and mind is actually a kind of ocean, why should it not contain alien creatures? Before falling asleep, I made a note to send for Aldous Huxley’s Heaven and Hell. Reich’s thoughts had taken a more practical tur n. Ten minutes after we separated, he called to me from his tent: ‘You know, I th ink we might be justified in asking Darga to lend us a large hovercraft for sh ifting the probe. It’d certainly make life easier...’ * * * It now seems absurd that neither of us anticipated the c onsequences of our discovery. We expected, of course , to produce some excitement in archaeological circles. Both of us had conveniently forgotten the kind of thing that happened when Carter found the tomb of Tutankhamen, or when the Dead Sea scrolls were discovered at Qumran. Archaeologists are inclined to discount the world of mass communications and the hysteria of journalists. Fu’ad and Darga woke us up at half past six, before the workmen arrived. They had with them four officials of the Turkish government, and a couple of American film stars who happened to be sightseeing. Reich was inclined to resent this unannounced intrusion, but I pointed out to him that the Turkish government was within its rights except, perhaps, where the film stars were concerned. First of all, they wanted to be convinced that th e blocks were really two miles deep. Reich started the probe, and showed them the outline of the ‘Abhoth block’ (as we came to refer to it), a nd the mole next to it. Darga expressed doubts that the mole could ha ve penetrated to a depth of two miles. Patiently, Reich went over to the mole’s transmissi on panel, and switched it on. The result was discomforting. The screen remained blank. He tried the digging control; it produced no result. There could be only one conclusion: that the temperature or possibly the pressure had damaged the mo le’s equipment. It was a setback, but not as serious as it might have been. A mole was expensive, but it could be replaced. But Darga and Fu’ad still wanted to be convinced that there was not some fault in the mechanism of th e probe. Reich spent the morning demonstrating that every circuit was in or der, and that there could be no room for doubt that the blocks were really tw o miles down. We developed the radar photograph of the Abhoth block, and compar ed its cuneiform with that of the basalt figurines. It was impossible to doubt that the two came from the same culture. There was, of course, only one possible answer to the problem: a full scale tunnel down to the blocks. I should point out that, at this point, we had no idea of the size of individual blocks. We presumed that the height indicated on the probe’s screen could be the height of a wall or a whole building. Admittedly,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" the radar photograph posed an interesti ng problem, for it had been taken from above which meant, presumably, that the wall, or building, was lying on its side. No past civilization has ever been known to write inscriptions on the top of walls or on the roof of buildings. Our visitors were baffled but impresse d. Unless this turned out to be some kind of a freak, it would undoubtedly pr ove to be the greatest find in archaeological history. So far, the oldest civilization known to man is that of the Masma Indians of the Marcahuasi platea u in the Andes 9,000 years old. But we now recalled the results of our tests on the basalt figurines with the neutron dater, which we had assumed to be inaccurate. They tended to support our assumption that we were now dealing with the remains of a civilization at least twice as old as that of the Marcahuasi. Fu’ad and his colleagues stayed to lunch, and left at about two o’clock. By now, their excitement was affecting me, although I had an obscure feeling of irritation at allowing myself to be affected. Fu’ad promised to send us a hovercraft as quickly as possible, but me ntioned that it might take several days. Until this arrived, we felt reluctant to move the probe by hand. It was obvious that we were going to receive a great de al more governmental support than we had expected, and there was no sense in wasting energy. We had a second mole, but it seemed pointless to risk it. So at ha lf past two, we sat in the shadow of the lower gate, drank orange squa sh, and felt at a loose end. Half an hour later, th e first of the journalists arrived—the Ankara correspondent of the New York Time s. Reich was furious. He assumed incorrectly that the Tu rkish government was seiz ing this opportunity for publicity. (We later discovere d that the two film stars were responsible for informing the press.) Reich vanished into his tent, and I was left to entertain the journalist, a pleasant enough man who ha d read my book on the Hittites. I showed him the photograph, and explained the working of the probe. When he asked me what had happened to the mole, I said I had no idea. For all I knew, it had been sabotaged by troglodytes. This , I am afraid, was the first of my mistakes. I made the second when he asked me about the size of the Abhoth block. I pointed out that we had no evidence that it was a single block, even though there appeared to be similar blocks on either side of it. It could be a religious monument in the shape of an enormous block, or perhaps a construction like the ziggurat at Ur. If it was a single block, then it would indicate that we were dealing with a ci vilization of giants. To my surprise, he took me seriously. Di d I subscribe to the theory that the world had once been inhabited by giants who had been destroyed by some great lunar catastrophe? I said that, as a scientis t, it was my business to keep an open mind until definite evidence was produced. But was this evidence? he persisted. I replied that it was too earl y to say. He then asked me whether I would agree that such immense building blocks could have been moved by ordinary men as in the case of the Gizeh pyramid or the Toltec sun pyramid at Teotihuacan. Still unsuspecting, I pointed out that the larg est blocks of the Gizeh pyramid weigh"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" twelve tons; a seventy foot block could weigh a thousand tons. But I agreed that we still had no real knowledge of how the stones of the Cheops pyramid—or those at Stonehenge, for that matter—ha d been moved; these ancient people may have possessed a far greater knowledge than we realize... Before I had finished talking to the New York Times man, three more helicopters appeared. More journalists . By four o’clock, Reich had been persuaded to emerge from his tent, and was demonstrating the mechanism of the probe with a bad grace. By six o’clock, we were bot h hoarse and weary, escaped back to the hotel in Kadirli, and manage d to eat a quiet supper. The manager had been told to refuse all telephone calls. But at nine o’clock, Fu’ad got through to us. He was waving a copy of the New York Times. The whole front was devoted to the story of the ‘World’s Biggest Discovery—Ever’. I was quoted as endorsing the theory that we had discovere d the city of a race of giants. I was made to hint that these giants had al so been magicians who had raised their thousand ton building blocks by some strange art that has now been forgotten. A well known colleague of mine stated his opinion that the pyramids of Egypt and ancient Peru could never have been built by any known method of engineering, and that this new discovery would surely prove it beyond all doubt. On the inside page of the newspaper, a popular write r on archaeology contributed an article called The Giants of Atlantis. I assured Fu’ad that I had never said a nything about giants, at least, not in the context quoted. He promised to ring the New York Times and correct their account. Then I crept off to Reich’s room to drink a final glass of brandy, leaving instructions that I was at home to no one—not even the Sultan of Turkey. I think I have said enough to indicate why we were unable to return to the site for another week. The Turkish govern ment supplied soldiers to guard our equipment; but they had no orders to k eep visitors at bay, and the air above Karatepe swarmed with helicopters like wasps around jam. Th e hotels in Kadirli were jammed for the first time since they had been built. Reich and I had to stay in our rooms, or risk being accosted a hundred times an hour by cranks and sensation seekers. The Turkish governm ent granted us the hovercraft within twelve hours, but it was impossible to use it. On the following day, the Carnegie Foundation granted us two million dollars for starting the tunnel, and the World Finance Committee produced another two million. Finally, the Turkish government agreed to build a forty foot wire enclosure around the Black Mountain, and they did this in less than a week, with some help from American and Russian foundations. We were th en able to return to work. Inevitably, everything had changed. Ther e were no more quiet siestas after lunch, or midnight talks in our tent. Soldiers stood guard all over the mound. Prominent archaeologists from every c ountry in the world plagued us with questions and suggestions. The air buz zed with helicopters, which were prevented from landing by warning radio broadcasts from a hastily erected control tower—again a product of Am erican and Russian co-operation."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Still, the compensations were considerable. A team of engineers harnessed the probe to the hovercraft, so that we c ould take instant read ings over the most difficult terrain. The Turkish government pr ovided us with two more moles, both specially reinforced. Money and equipment could be had for the asking—a situation to delight the h eart of any archaeologist. Within two days we had made a number of astonishing discoveries. First of all, the probe indicated that we had, in fact, discovered a buried city. Walls and building extended for over a mile in bot h directions. The Black Mountain of Karatepe appeared to be r oughly above the centre of this city. It was, indeed, a city of giants. The ‘Abhoth block’ was not a building or a religious monument; it was a single building block, cut from solid basalt, the hardest kind of volcanic basalt. One of the reinforced moles actua lly cut off a fragment of the block, and brought it to the surface. Yet a curious bad luck followed us. W ithin forty-eight hours, we lost one of the reinforced moles in the same manne r as the first. It ceased to respond to signals at a depth of two miles. A week later, we lost the other mole in the same manner—half a million pounds worth of equi pment buried at the bottom of a sea of earth. A careless operator lost control of the hovercraft, an d allowed the probe to crash into a hut full of Turkish soldiers, killing eighteen. The probe was undamaged, but the newspapers, which were still in full cry, were not slow to draw parallels with the misfortunes of the Carter-Carnarvon expedition of 1922, the sensational stories of the curse of Tutankhamen. A colleague, upon whose discretion I thought I could rely, reported my theory that the Hittites of Karatepe owed their survival to their reputations as magicians, and started a new wave of sensational stories. It was at this point that the name of H. P. Lovecraft entered the story. Like the majority of my colleagues, I had never heard of Lovecraft, the writer of supernatural stories who died in 1937. For a long time after his death, a small ‘Lovecraft cult’ had persisted in America, largely due to the advocacy of Lovecraft’s friend, the novelist August Derleth. It was Derleth who now wrote to Reich, pointing out that the name of ‘Abhoth the Unclean’ o ccurs in Lovecraft’s work, and that he figures as one of the ‘Great Old Ones’. My first thought, when Reich showed me the letter, was it was a hoax. We checked in a dictionary of literature, and discovered that Derleth was a well known American writer, now in his eighties. Lovecraft was not mentioned in the dictionary, but a call to the British Museum produced the information that he had also existed, and had written the books Derleth attributed to him. There was a sentence in Derleth’s letter that struck me. After admitting that he could not explain how Lovecraft c ould have known about ‘Abhoth the Dark’ since the name does not occur in any of the Hittite documents that were uncovered before 1937, he added: ‘Lovecraf t always attached great importance to dreams, and often told me that the s ubjects of many of hi s stories occurred to him in dreams’. ‘Another piece of ev idence for your racial subconscious.’ I commented to Reich. He suggested that it was more proba bly coincidence."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" Abbaddon is the destroying angel of He brew legend; the ‘hoth’ ending is Egyptian. A god ‘Abaoth’ is mentioned in certain Babylonian writings that Lovecraft might have seen. As to the ‘great old ones’, the phrase is not so strange that it might not have occurred to a writer of supernatural fic tion. ‘Why drag in the racial subconscious?’ sa id Reich, and I was inclined to agree with him. A few days later, we changed our minds. The parcel of books sent by Derleth finally arrived. I opened a story called ‘The Shadow Out of Time’ and immediately came upon a description of immense stone blocks buried beneath the desert of Australia. At the same mo ment, Reich, who was sitting in the other armchair, gave an exclamation, and read aloud the sentence: ‘The dweller in darkness is also known by the name Nyogtha’. Only the evening before, we had arrived at a tentative translation of th e inscription on the Abhoth block: ‘And the horses shall be brought two by two into th e presence of Nyogtha’. I then read Reich the description of the underground cities from ‘The Shadow Out of Time’, the ‘mighty basalt cities of windowless towers’ built by the ‘half-polypus elder race’. There could no longer be any reasonabl e doubt that Lovecraft had, in some strange way, anticipated our discoveries . We wasted no time in speculating how this had come about: whether Lovecraft ha d somehow looked into the future in the manner described by Dunne in his Expe riment with Time and seen the results of our investigations, or whether hi s dreaming mind had somehow penetrated these secrets buried below the earth in Asia Minor. This was irrelevant. The question that now presented itself to us was: how much of Lovecraft’s work was mere literary invention, and how much was visionary ‘second sight’? It seemed strange to be neglecting our archaeological du ties to study the works of a writer who had published most of his work in a pulp magazine called Weird Tales. We kept our secret as long as possible, giving it out that we were devoting our days to the study of the c uneiform inscriptions . We spent several days locked in Reich’s room (which wa s larger than mine), reading steadily through the works of Lovecraft. When our meals arrived, we concealed the books under cushions and pored over photograp hs of inscriptions. By this time, we had learned our lesson; we knew what would happen if any journalist discovered how we occupied our days . We had talked to Derleth on the telescreen—a friendly and courteous ol d gentleman with abundant white hair— and asked him to mention his discovery to no one. He agreed readily enough, but pointed out that there were still many readers of L ovecraft who were bound to stumble upon the same discovery. The study of Lovecraft was, in its elf, an interesting and pleasant occupation. He was a man of remarkable imagination. Reading his works in chronological order, we observed a gradual change of viewpoint.* _________ * These remarks on Lovecraft are taken from Lovecraft and the Kadath Inscriptions , a lecture delivered by Dr Austin before the New York Historical Society on 18th June, 1999."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" The early stories tend to have a Ne w England background, and deal with a fictional county called Arkham, with wild hills and sinister valleys. The inhabitants of Arkham seem to be mostly weird degenerates with a taste for forbidden pleasures and the conjuration of demons. Inevitably, a large number of them come to a violent end. But graduall y, there is a change in the tone of Lovecraft’s work. His imagination turns from the horrible to the awe-inspiring, to visions of tremendous aeons of time, of giant cities, of the conflict of monstrous and superhuman races. Except that he continues to write in the language of horror stories no doubt with his market in mind he might be considered one of the earliest and best exponents of science fiction. It was mostly with this latter ‘s cience fiction peri od’ that we were concerned, (although this should not be taken too literally; a mention of ‘Abhoth the Unclean’ occurs in one of his earliest Arkham stories). What was most striking was that thes e ‘cyclopean cities’ of the great old ones (not the polypus race, which they re placed) fitted what we now knew of our own underground city. According to Lovecraft, these cities had no stairs, only inclined planes, for their inhabitants were huge, cone-like creatures with tentacles; the base of the cone was ‘fringed with a rubbery grey substance, which moved the whole entity through expansion and contraction’. The probe had revealed that this ci ty below Karatepe had many inclined planes, but apparently no stairs. And its size certain ly merited the adjective ‘cyclopean’. As can well be imagined, our underground city presented a problem that is almost new to archaeology. Layard’s pr oblem of excavating the immense mound of Nimrud was nothing compared to ours. Reich calculated that in order to expose the ruins to the light of day, we would have to move about forty billion tons of earth (using the American bill ion—a thousand million). Obviously, this could never be done. An alternative would be to dig a series of wide tunnels down to the city, and create large chambers at the end of these tunnels. It would have to be a series, because we could ne ver risk creating a chamber of any size. No metal known to man could be relied upon to support a roof two miles thick. This would mean that the city itself c ould never be exposed as a whole; but the use of the probe might show us which pa rts were best worth the trouble. Even the digging of a single tunnel would invol ve moving a hundred thousand tons of earth. Still, this was well within the range of possibility. It took the press exactly one week to catch up with our discovery of Lovecraft. This was, perhaps, the greates t sensation since our original discovery. The newspapers went insane . After all the talk about giants, magicians and dark gods, this was all the stor y needed. So far, popular archaeologists, pyramid cranks and exponents of the world-ice th eory had had a field day. Now it was the turn of the spiritualists, occultists a nd the rest. Someone wrote an article to demonstrate that Lovecraft had borrowed his mythology from Madame Blavatsky. Someone else declar ed that it was all part of a cabalistic tradition."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" Lovecraft suddenly became the most wide ly read writer in the world; his books sold by the million in every language. A nd many who read him were terrified, believing that we were about to disturb the ‘great ol d ones’ in their underground tombs, and that the result would be the catastrophe that Lovecraft describes so powerfully in ‘The Call of Cthulhu’. The city of ‘The Shadow Out of Time’ was unnamed, but in an early Lovecraft novel it is mentioned as ‘Unknown Kadath’. The newspaper writers christened our underground city ‘Kadat h’, and the name stuck. And almost immediately, a madman in New York called Dalgleish Fuller announced the formation of an Anti-Kadath Society, whose purpose was to prevent us from excavating Kadath and disturbing the Grea t Old Ones. It is indicative of the insanity of those times that it immediately gained a membership of half a million, which quickly increased to three millions. They adopted the motto: ‘Sanity lies in the future; forget the past’. They bought advertising time on television, and hired respectable psychologist s to declare that Lovecraft’s visions were a straightforward example of the Extra-Sensory Perception that Rhine and his colleagues had demonstrated so convi ncingly at Duke University. In that case, Lovecraft’s warnings should be h eeded; if the ‘Great Old Ones’ were disturbed, it might well be the end of the human race. Dalgleish Fuller was a crank with some organizing ability. He rented an enormous area of ground within five miles of Karatepe, and set up a camping site there. His followers were exhorted to take their annual holiday s there, and to spend them creating a nuisance at Karatepe. The land was privat ely owned by a farmer who was glad to accept the immense sums they offered him, and the whole thing was arranged before the Turkish government could take action. Fuller had a gift for attracting cranky rich women who poured funds into the movement. They bought helicopters that buzzed over the mound dragging sky-signs with anti-Kadath inscriptions on them. At night, the helicop ters came and dumped rubbish at the site, so that when we arrived in the morning, it often took several hours to clear away the rotten fruit and vegetables a nd old tins. The campers made protest marches to the barbed wire twice a day, sometimes in columns of a thousand. It was six weeks before the United Nations could be persuaded to take action and send in troops. By this time, Fuller had re cruited five American senators to his party, and together they introduced a bi ll to ban further digging at Karatepe. They explained, of course, that they were not activated by superstitious fear, but by reverence of a long dead civilizations: Had we the right, said they, to disturb the sleep of centuries? It is to the credit of the Senate that the bill was outvoted by an enormous majority. And just when it seemed that the Anti-Kadath Society was losing influence through its noisy ex cesses, the whole thing was given new impetus with the publication of the findi ngs of Stanislaw Perzynski and Mirza Din. The facts about these two are brie fly as follows. Perzynski was a Pole, Mirza Din was a Persian; both died insane in the first decade of the twentieth century. Perzynski was the better documented of the two; he had gained a certain reputation with a biography of his grandf ather, the Russian poet Nadson. He had"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" also edited an edition of the supernatural stories of Count Potocki. In 1898, he published a curious book warning the human race that it was about to be taken over by a race of monsters from another world, who had built enormous cities under the ground. A year later, he was co mmitted to an asylum. His papers included strange sketches that might have been intended for illustrations of Lovecraft’s stories about Kadath: monstr ous architecture with inclined planes and great angular towers. These were published in full by the Anti-Kadath Society. The case of Mirza Din was more dubious. He was also a writer of apocalyptic visions, which seldom achieve d publication. He also spent the last five years of his life in an asylum, writing warning letters to members of the Persian government about a race of monsters that plotted to overrun the earth. Mirza Din located his monsters somewhere in the jungles of central Africa, and described them as looking like huge slugs. Their enormous cities were built from their own slimy excretion, which hardened into a kind of stone. Most of Mirza Din’s insane letters had b een destroyed, but the few th at had survived showed a remarkable similarity in style to Pe rzynski’s letters, and his slugs were sufficiently like Lovecraft’s cones to lend credibility to the claim that all three were describing the same vision of th e ‘Great Old Ones’ and their city. After the government’s inte rvention, and the digging of the first tunnel, the activities of the Anti-Kadath Society gradually diminished; but for a period of eighteen months, they succeeded in creatin g a considerable nuisance. Dalgleish Fuller was murdered by one of his own female disciples under strange circumstances.* _________ * See Dalgleish Fuller, A Study in Fanaticism , by Daniel Atherston, New York 2010. The first tunnel was completed exactly a year after our discovery of the Abhoth block. The digging of the tunne l had been undertaken by the Italian government, who used the same giant mole that had already been used in the construction of the tunnel between Scilla and Messina (in Sicily), and later between Otranto and Linguetta in Albani a. The digging itself took only a few days, but the chief problem was to prev ent the lower parts of the tunnel from collapsing. The block itself was as impre ssive as we had expected—sixty-eight feet high, thirty feet wide, ninety feet long, carved out of solid volcanic basalt. It became impossible to doubt that we were dealing with a race of giants or magicians. From the existence of the basalt figurines, I was inc lined to doubt that they had been a race of giants; the figurines were too small. (It was not until ten years later that Mercer’s dramatic discove ries in Tanzania revealed that these great cities were inhabite d both by giants and by hum an beings, and that the giants were almost certainly th e slaves of the human beings.) The exact dating of the blocks re mained a problem. According to Lovecraft, the ‘Great Old Ones’ existed a hundred and fifty million years ago,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" and his idea had gained popular credence. This, of course, was inconceivable. Reich’s neutron dater later suggested that the remains were less than two million years old, and even this may be an overe stimate. The problems of dating are in this case unusually complex. The archaeol ogist usually relies on the various layers of earth above his find, for in these he possesses a kind of ready-made calendar. But in the thr ee known cases of these gian t cities, the clues seem contradictory. All that we can say with ce rtainty is that each was destroyed by a deluge that buried them under many thous ands of feet of mud. The word ‘deluge’ immediately suggests the Pleist ocene to a geologist—a mere million years ago. But in the Queensland deposits have been found traces of a rodent that is known to have existed onl y in the Pliocene era, which could add another five million years to the dating. All this is ir relevant to my main story. For long before the completion of the first tunnel, I had lost interest in the Karatepe excavations. I had come to recognize them for what they were—a red herring deliberately introduced by the mind parasi tes. My discovery came about in this way. By the end of July 1997, I was in a state of tota l exhaustion. Even with a five mile sun-umbrella reducing the temperature to a mere sixty in the shade, Karatepe was intolerable. The rubbish dumped on us by Fuller’s disciples made the place stink like a swamp; the various disinfectant fluids that were used to cover it up only made it worse. The winds were dry and dusty. We spent half the day drinking iced sherbet with rose leaves and reclining in the air-conditioned huts. In July, I began to get violent headaches. Two days spent in Scotland improved things, and I went back to wo rk, but after another week, I went down with fever. I had had enough of constant interruptions from press men and Anti- Kadath cranks, so I went back to my fl at in Diyarbakir. It was cool and quiet, being on the territory of the Anglo-Indian Uranium Company, whose guards had a short way with intruders. I found heaps of letters and several great parcels waiting for me, but for two days I ignored them, and stayed in bed and listened to the operas of Mozart on gramophone reco rds. Gradually, the fever left me. On the third day, I had emerged from my accidie enough to open my letters. Among them was a note from Standard Motors and Engineering, saying that, in accordance with my request, they were forwarding most of Karel Weissman’s papers to me at Diyarbak ir. This, then, explained the enormous parcels. Another letter came from Northw estern University Press, and enquired whether I would be willing to entrust th em with the publication of Karel’s psychological papers. All this was tiresome. I forwarded th e letter to Baumgart in London, and went back to my Mozart. The next day, conscience nagged me, and I opened the remainder of my post. And I found a letter from Carl Seidel, the man with whom Baumgart shared a flat (he was a homo sexual), telling me that Baumgart had suffered a nervous breakdown, and was at present back with his family in Germany. This obviously meant that the que stion of Karel’s papers was now in my hands. So, with immense unwillingness, I went about the ta sk of opening the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" first of the parcels. It weighed about forty pounds, and consisted entirely of the results of a test made upon a hundred em ployees to determine their response to colour changes. I shudd ered, and turned back to The Magic Flute. That evening, a young Persian executive with whom I had become friendly dropped in to share a bottle of wine. I was feeling a little lonely, and was glad to talk. Even the subject of the excavations had ceased to be unbearable to me, and it gave me pleasure to tell him the ‘inside story’ of our work. As he was leaving, he noticed the parcels, and asked if they were connected with the excavations. I told him the story of Weissman’s suicide, and admitted that the idea of opening them produced a boredom that approached physical pain. In his cheerful and kindly way, he offered to return the next morning and open them for me. If they were all routine test papers, he would get his secretary to pack them straight off to Northwestern University. I knew he ma de the offer as a kind of repayment for my confidences of the evening, and I accepted cordially. By the time I was out of my bath the next morning, he had finished. Five out of six parcels contained routine material. The sixth, he told me, seemed to be of a more ‘philosophical nature’, and he thought I might like to look at it. With that, he withdrew, and his secretary cam e shortly afterwards to remove the enormous pile of yellow foolscap page s from the middle of my sitting-room. The remaining material was in neat blue folders, and consisted of typewritten pages held together by me tal rings. The cover of each bore a handwritten label: Historical Reflectio ns. Every folder was sealed with a coloured sticky tape, and I surmised—ri ghtly, as it later turned out—that they had not been opened since Weissman’s death. I never discovered what mistake had le d Baumgart to send them to General Motors. I would guess that he put them by for my attention, and somehow packed them with the industrial material. The folders were not numbered. I broke open the first, and quickly discovered that these ‘historical reflecti ons’ covered only the history of the past two centuries—a period that had never held any great interest for me. I was tempted to send them off to Northwestern University without further examination, but conscience got the better of me. I retired to bed, and took the half-dozen blue folders with me. This time, by accident, I started in the right place. The opening sentence of the first folder I opened read: ‘It has b een my conviction for several months now that the human race is being att acked by a sort of mind-cancer.’ An arresting sentence. I thought: Ah, what an excellent opening for a volume of Karel’s papers... A mind cance r, another name for neurosis or anhedonia, the spiritual malaise of the twentieth century... Not for a moment did I take it literally. I read on. The strange problem of th e rising suicide rate... The high incidence of child murder in the modern family... the perpetual danger of atomic war, the increase in drug addiction. It all seemed familiar enough. I yawned, and turned the page."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" A few minutes later, I was reading with closer attention. Not because what I was reading struck me as true, but because I suddenly had a definite suspicion that Karel had gone insane. In my youth, I had read the books of Charles Fort, with their suggestions of giants, fair ies and floating continents. But Fort’s extraordinary farragoes of sense and nonsense have an air of humorous exaggeration. Karel Weissman’s ideas sounde d as mad as Fort’s, but they were obviously advanced in all seriousness. Eith er, then, he had joined the ranks of famous scientific eccentrics, or he had gone completely mad. In view of his suicide, I was inclined to the latter view. I read on with a kind of morbid abso rption. After the opening pages, he ceased to mention the ‘mind cancer’, and launched into an examination of the cultural history of the past two hundred years... It was carefully argued, and brilliantly written. It revived memories of our long talks at Uppsala. At midday, I was still reading. And by one o’clock, I knew I had stumbled on something that would make me remember this day for the rest of my life. Mad or not, it was horribly convincing. I wanted to believe it was madness. But as I read on, my certainty was eroded. It was all so unsettli ng that I broke the habit of years, and drank a bottle of champagne at lunch tim e. As to food, it was all I could do to nibble a turkey sandwich. And despite th e champagne, I became steadily more depressed and sober. And by late afternoon, I had grasped the whole tremendous and nightmarish picture, and my brain felt as if it would burst. If Karel Weissman was not insane, the human race confronted the greatest danger in its history. * * * It is obviously impossible to explain in detail how Karel Weissman arrived at his ‘philosophy of history’.* _________ * A detailed examination will be found in the three volumes of Max Viebig’s Philosophy of Karel Weissman . Northwestern University, 2015. It was the result of a lifetime of work. But I can at least outline the conclusions he reached in his Historical Reflections. The most remarkable faculty of manki nd, says Weissman, is its power of self-renewal, or of creation. The simplest example is the kind of renewal that occurs when a man sleeps. A tired man is a man already in the grip of death and insanity. One of Weissman’s most striking theories is hi s identification of insanity with sleep. A sane man is a man who is fully awake. As he grows tired, he loses his ability to rise above dreams and delusions, and life becomes steadily more chaotic. Now Weissman argues that this facu lty of creation or self-renewal is abundantly obvious in European man from the Renaissance to the eighteenth century. In this period, human history is full of cruelty and horror, and yet man"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" can throw it off as easily as a tired ch ild can sleep off its fatigue. The English Elizabethan period is usually cited as a golden age because of its creativity; but anyone who studies it closely is horrifi ed by its callousness and brutality. Men are tortured and burnt alive; Jews have their ears cut off; children are beaten to death or allowed to die in incredibly filthy slums. Yet so enormous is man’s optimism and power of self-renewal that the chaos only stimulates him to new efforts. Great age follows great age: the age of Leonardo, the age of Rabelais, the age of Chaucer, the age of Shakespeare, the age of Newton, the age of Johnson, the age of Mozart... Nothing is more obvious than that man is a god who will overcome every obstacle. And then a strange change comes over the human race. It happens towards the end of the eighteenth century. The tremendous, bubbling creativity of Mozart is counterbalanced by the nightmare cruelt y of de Sade. And suddenly, we are in an age of darkness, an age where men of genius no longer create like gods. Instead, they struggle as if in the grip of an invisible octopus. The century of suicide begins. In fact, m odern history begins, the age of defeat and neurosis. But why did it all happen so sudden ly! The industrial revolution? But the industrial revolution did not happen overni ght, and neither did it affect a large area of Europe. Europe remained a la nd of woods and farms. How, asked Weissman, can we explain the immense difference between the genius of eighteenth century and that of the nineteenth, except by surmising that some invisible yet cataclysmic change came over the human race in about the year 1800? How can the industrial revolution e xplain the total dissimilarity between Mozart and Beethoven—the latter a mere fourteen years Mozart’s junior? Why do we enter a century in which half the me n of genius committed suicide or died of tuberculosis? Spengler says that civilizations grow old like plants, but this is a sudden leap from youth to old age. An immense pessimism descends on the human race, which is reflected in its art, its music, its literature. It is not enough to say that man has suddenly grown up. What is far more important is that he seems to have lost his power of self-rene wal. Can we think of a single great man of the eighteenth century who committed su icide? And yet their lives were just as hard as those of the nineteenth centur y. The new man has lost faith in life, he has lost faith in knowledge. Modern man agr ees with Faust: that when all is said and done, we can know nothing. Now Karel Weissman was a psychologist, not an historian. And the field in which he made a living was in indus trial psychology. In the Historical Reflections, he writes: It was in 1990 that I entered the field of industria l psychology as the assistant of Professor Ames at Trans-wo rld Cosmetics. I immediately discovered a curious and nightmarish s ituation. I knew, of course, that ‘i ndustrial neurosis’ had become a serious matter—so much so that special industria l courts had been set up to deal with offenders who sabot aged machinery or killed or injured workmates. But only a few people were aw are of the sheer size of the problem."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" The murder rate in large factories and similar concer ns had increased to twice that of the rest of the population. In one cigarette f actory in America, eight foremen and two high executives were killed in the course of a single year; in seven of these cases, the murderer committed suicide immediately after the attack. The industrial Plastics Corporation of Iceland had decided to try the experiment of an ‘open air’ factory, spread over many acres, so that the workers had no sense of overcrowding or confinemen t; energy fields were used instead of walls. At first, the experiment was highly successful; but within two years, the factory’s rate of industria l crime and neurosis had ri sen to equal the national average. These figures never reached the nati onal press. Psychologists reasoned— correctly—that to publicize them would make things worse. They reasoned that it would be best to treat each case as one would an outbreak of fire that must be isolated. The more I considered this problem, the more I felt that we had no real idea of its cause. My colleagues were frankly de feated by it, as Dr Ames admitted to me during my first week at Trans-world Cosmetics. He said that it was difficult to get to the root of the problem, because it seemed to have so many roots—the population explosion, overcrowding in cities, the indivi dual’s feeling of insignificance and increasing se nse of living in a vacuum , the lack of adventure in modern life, collapse of religion... a nd so on. He said he wasn’t sure that industry wasn’t treating the problem in entirely the wrong way. It was costing more money on psychiatrists, on impr oving working conditions—in short, in making the workers feel like patients. But since our living depended on this mistake, it was hardly up to us to suggest a change. And so I turned to hist ory to find my answers. And the answers, when I found them, made me feel like suicide. For, according to history, all this was completely inevitable. Civilization was ge tting top heavy; it was bound to fall over. Yet the one thing this conclusion fa iled to take into account was the human power of self-renewal. By the same reasoning, Mozart was bound to commit suicide because his life was so miserable. But he didn’t. What was destroying the human power of self-renewal? I cannot explain quit e how I came to believe that there might be a single cause. It was something that dawned on me slowly, over many years. It was simply that I came to feel increasingly strongly that the figures for industrial crime were out of all proportion to the so-cal led ‘historical causes’. It was as if I were the head of a firm who begins to feel instinctively that his accountant is cooking the books, although he has ho idea how it is being done. And then, one day, I began to suspect the existence of the mind vampires. And from then on, everything confirmed my guess. It happened first when I was consider ing the use of mescalin and lysergic acid for curing industrial neurosis. Fundamentally, of course, the effect of these drugs is no different from that of alcohol or tobacco: they have the effect of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" unwinding us. A man who is overworked has got himself into a habit of tension, and he cannot break the habit by merely w illing.

Through millions of years of evolution, he has developed all kinds of habi ts for survival. If any of these habits get out of control, the result is mental illness. For example, man has a habit of being prepared for enemies; but if he allo ws it to dominate his life, he becomes a paranoiac.

Another one, with the sa me cause, is his refusal to notice beauty, because he prefers to concentrate on practical problems. These habits are so deeply ingrained that al cohol and tobacco cannot reach them. But mescalin can. It can reach down to man’s most atavistic levels, and release the automatic tensions that make him a slave to his own boredom and to the world around him. Now I must confess that I was inclined to blame these atavistic habits for the problem of the world suicide rate and the industrial crime rate. Man has to learn to relax, or he becomes overwr ought and dangerous. He must learn to contact his own deepest levels in order to re-energize his consciousness. So it seemed to me that drugs of the mescalin group might provide the answer. So far, the use of these drugs had been avoided in industrial psychology, for an obvious reason: mescalin relaxes a man to a point where work becomes impossible. He wants to do nothing but c ontemplate the beauty of the world and the mysteries of his own mind. I felt that there was no reason to reach this limit. A tiny quantity of mescalin, administered in the right way, might release a man’s creative forces without plunging him into a stupor. After all, man’s ancestors of two thousand years ago were almost colour-blind because they were in a subconscious habit of ignori ng colour. Life was so diffi cult and dangerous that they couldn’t afford to notice it. Yet modern man has succeeded in losing this old habit of colour-blindness without losing any of his driv e and vitality. It is all a matter of balance. * * * And so I inaugurated a seri es of experiments with drugs of the mescalin group. And my first results were so alarming that my engagement with Trans-world Cosmetics was terminated abruptly. Five out of my ten subjects committed suicide within days. Another two had a tota l mental collapse that drove them into a madhouse. I was baffled. I had experimented with mescalin on myself in my university days, but I found the results uninteresting. A mescalin holid ay is all very pleasant, but it all depends whether you en joy holidays. I do not; I find work too interesting."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" But my results made me decide to try it again. I took half a gram. The result was so horrifying that I st ill perspire when I think about it. At first, there were the usual plea sant effects—areas of light swelling gently and revolving. Then an immense sense of peace and calm, a glimpse of the Buddhist nirvana, a beautiful and gentle contempla tion of the universe that was at once detached and infinitely i nvolved. After about an hour of this, I roused myself from it; I was obviously not discovering what had caused the suicides. Now I attempted to turn my attention inward, to observe the exact state of my perceptions and emoti ons. The result was baffling. It was as if I was trying to look through a te lescope, and someone was delib erately placin g his hand over the other end of it. Every attempt at self-observation failed. And then, with a kind of violent effort, I tried to batte r through this wall of darkness. And suddenly, I had a distinct feeling of so mething living and alien hurrying out of my sight. I am not, of course, speaking of physical sight. This was entirely a ‘feeling’. But it had such an imprint of reality that for a moment I became almost insane with terror. One can run away fr om an obvious physical menace, but there was no running away from this , because it was inside me. For nearly a week afterwards, I was in a state of the most abject terror, and closer to insanity than I have ever b een in my life. For although I was now back in the ordinary physical worl d, I had no feeling of safet y. I felt that, in returning to everyday consciousness, I was like an ostrich burying its head in the sand. It only meant that I was unaware of the menace. Luckily, I was not working at the time; it would have been impossible. And about a week later, I f ound myself thinking: Well, what are you afraid of? You’ve come to no harm. I immediately be gan to feel more cheerful. It was only a few days after this that Standard Mo tors and Engineering offered me the post of their chief medical officer. I accepted it, and plunged into the work of an enormous and complex organization. Fo r a long time it left me no time for brooding or devising new experiments. And whenever my thoughts turned back to my mescalin experiments, I felt such a powerful revulsion that I always found some excuse for putting it off. Six months ago, I finally returned to th e problem, this time from a slightly different angle. My friend Rupert Haddon of Princeton told me of his highly successful experiments in rehabilitating se xual criminals with the use of L.S.D. In explaining his theories, he used a great deal of th e terminology of the philosopher Husserl. It immediately becam e obvious to me that phenomenology is only another name for the kind of se lf-observation I had tried to carry out under mescalin, and that when Husserl ta lks about ‘uncoveri ng the structure of consciousness’, he only means descending in to these realms of mental habit of which I have spoken. Husserl had realized that while we have ordnance survey maps that cover every inch of our eart h, we have no atlas of our mental world. Reading Husserl renewed my courage. The idea of trying mescalin again terrified me; but phenomenology starts fr om ordinary consciousness. So I again"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" began making notes about the problems of man’s inner world, and the geography of consciousness. Almost at once, I became aware that certain inner-forces were resisting my researches. As soon as I began to brood on these problems, I began to experience sick headaches and feelings of nausea. Every morning, I woke up with a feeling of profound depression. I have always been a student of mathematics in an amateurish way, as well as a good che ss player. I soon discovered that I felt better the moment I turned my attenti on to mathematics or chess. But the moment I began to think about the mind, the same depression would settle on me. My own weakness began to infuriate me. I determined that I would overcome it at all costs. So I begged two months’ leave of absence from my employers. I warned my wife that I was going to be very ill. And I deliberately turned my mind to these problems of phenomenology. The result was exactly as I predicted. For a few days I felt tired and depressed. Th en I began to experience headaches and nerve pains. Then I vomite d up everything I ate. I took to my bed, and tried to use my mind to probe my own sickness, using the methods of analysis laid down by Husserl. My wife had no idea of what was wrong with me, and her anxiety made it twice as bad. It is lucky that we have no children; otherwise, I would certainly ha ve been forced to surrender. After a fortnight, I was so exhausted that I could barely swallow a teaspoonful of milk. I made an immense effort to rally my forces, reaching down to my deepest instinctive levels. In that moment, I became aware of my enemies. It was like swimming down to the botto m of the sea and su ddenly noticing that you are surrounded by sharks. I could not, of course, ‘see’ them in the ordinary sense, but I could feel their presence as clearly as one can feel toothache. They were down there, at a level of my being where my consciousness never penetrates. And as I tried to prevent myself from screaming with terror, the fear of a man facing inevitable destruction, I suddenl y realized that I ha d beaten them. My own deepest life forces were rallying agai nst them. An immense strength, that I had never known I possessed, reared up like a giant. It was far stronger than they were, and they had to retreat from it. I suddenly became aware of more of them, thousands of them; and yet I knew that they could do nothing against me. And then the realization came to me with such searing force that I felt as if I had been struck by lightning. Everythi ng was clear; I knew everything. I knew why it was so important to them that no one should suspect their existence. Man possesses more than enough power to destro y them all. But so long as he is unaware of them, they can feed on him, like vampires, sucking away his energy. My wife came info the bedroom and was astounded to find me laughing like a madman. For a moment, she thought my mind had collapsed. Then she realized that it was th e laughter of sanity."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" I told her to go and bring me soup. And within forty-eight hours, I was back on my feet again, as healthy as ever in fact, healthier than I had ever been in my life. At first, I felt such an immense euphoria at my discovery that I forgot about those vampires of the mind. Then I realized that this in itself was stupid. They had an immense advantage over me; they knew my own mind far better than I did. Unless I was very careful, they could still destroy me. But for the moment, I was safe. When, later in the day, I felt persistent, nagging attacks of depression, I turned agai n to that deep so urce of inner power, and to my optimism about the human futu re. Immediately the attacks ceased, and I began to roar with lau ghter again. It was many w eeks before I could control this laughter mechanism whenever I ha d a skirmish with the parasites. What I had discovered was, of course, so fantastic that it could not be grasped by the unprepared mind. In fact, it was extraordinar y good luck that I had not made the discovery six years ea rlier, when I was working for Trans- world. In the meantime, my mind had ma de slow and unconscious preparation for it. In the past few months, I have b ecome steadily more convinced that it was not entirely a matter of luck. I have a feeling that there are powerful forces working on the side of humanity, although I have no idea of their nature. (I made a special note of this sentence. It was something I had always felt instinctively.) * * * What it amounts to is this. For more than two centuries now, the human mind has been constantly a prey to these energy vampires. In a few cases, the vampires have been able completely to take over a human mind and use it for their own purposes. For example, I am almost certain that de Sade was one of these ‘zombis’ whose brain was entirely in th e control of the vampires. The blasphemy and stupidity of his work are not, as in many cases, evidence of demonic vitality, and the proof of it is that de Sade never matured in any way, although he lived to be 74. The sole purpose of his life work is to add to the mental confusion of the human race, deliberately to distort and pervert the truth about sex. As soon as I understood about the mind vampires, the history of the past two hundred years became absurdly clea r. Until about 1780 (which is roughly the date when the first full-scale inva sion of mind vampires landed on earth), most art tended to be life-enhancing, like the music of Haydn and Mozart. After the invasion of the mind vampires, this sunny optimism became almost impossible to the artist. The mind vampires always chose the most intelligent men as their instruments, because it is ultimately the intelligent men who have the greatest influence on the human race. Very few artists have been powerful enough to hurl them off, and such men ha ve gained a new strength in doing so— Beethoven is clearly an ex ample; Goethe another. And this explains precisely why it is so important for the mind vampires to keep their presence unknown, to drain man’s lifeblood without his being aware"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" of it. A man who defeats the mind vamp ires becomes doubly dangerous to them, for his forces of self-renewal have conquered. In such cases, the vampires probably attempt to destroy him in a nother way—by trying to influence other people against him. We should remember that Beethoven’s death came about because he left his sister’s house after a rather curious quarrel, and drove several miles in an open cart in the rain. At all events, we notice that it is in the nineteenth century that the great artists fi rst begin to complain that ‘the world is against them’; Haydn and Mozart were we ll understood and appreciated by their own time. As soon as the artist dies, th is neglect disappears—the mind vampires loosen their grip on people’s minds. They have more important things to attend to. In the history of art and literature since 1780, we see the results of the battle with the mind vampires. The artists who refused to preach a gospel of pessimism and life devaluation were destr oyed. The life-slander ers often lived to a ripe old age. It is interesting, for ex ample, to contrast the fate of the life- slanderer Schopenhauer with that of the li fe-affirmer Nietzsche, or that of the sexual degenerate de Sade with th at of the sexual mystic Lawrence. Apart from these obvious facts, I have not succeeded in learning a great deal about the mind vampires. I am inclin ed to suspect that, in small numbers, they have always been present on earth. Possibly the Christian idea of the devil arises from some obscure intuition of the part they had played in human history: how their role is to take over a man’s mind, and to cause him to become an enemy of life and of the human race. But it would be a mistake to blame the vampires for all the misfortunes of the human race. Man is an animal who is trying to evolve into a god. Many of his problems are an inevitable result of this struggle. I have a theory, which I will state he re for the sake of completeness. I suspect that the universe is full of races like our own, st ruggling to evolve. In the early stages of its evolution, any race is mainly concerned to conquer its environment, to overcome enemies, to assu re itself of food. Bu t sooner or later, a point comes where the race has progressed beyond this stage, and can now turn its attention inward, to the pleasures of the mind. ‘My mind to me a kingdom is’, said Sir Edward Dyer. And when man rea lizes that his mind is a kingdom in the most literal sense, a great unexplored c ountry, he has crossed the borderline that divides the animal from the god. Now I suspect that these mind vampires specialize in finding races who have almost reached this point of evol ution, who are on the brink of achieving a new power, and then feeding on them until they have destroyed them. It is not their actual intention to destroy because once they have done this, they are forced to seek another host. Their intention is to feed for as long as possible on the tremendous energies generated by the evolutionary struggle. Their purpose, therefore, is to prevent man from discoveri ng the worlds inside himself, to keep his attention directed outwards. I think there can be no possible doubt that the wars of the twentieth century are a de liberate contrivance of these vampires."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" Hitler, like de Sade, was almost certainly another of their ‘zombis’. A completely destructive world war would not serv e their purposes, but continual minor skirmishes are admirable. What would man be like if he could de stroy these vampires, or drive them away? The first result would certainly be a tremendous sense of mental relief, a vanishing oppression, a surge of energy and optimism. In this first rush of energy, artistic masterpieces would be created by the dozen. Mankind would react like children who have been let out of school on th e last day of term. Then man’s energies would turn inward. He woul d take up the legacy of Husserl. (It is obviously significant that it was Hitler w ho was responsible for Husserl’s death just as his work was on the brink of new achievements.) He would suddenly realize that he possesses inner-powers that make the hydrogen bomb seem a mere candle. Aided, perhaps, by such dr ugs as mescalin, he would become, for the first time, an inhabitant of the worl d of mind, just as he is at present an inhabitant of earth. He would explore the countries of the mind as Livingstone and Stanley explored Africa. He would di scover that he has many ‘selves’, and that his higher ‘selves’ are what ancestors would have called gods. I have another theory, which is so absurd that I hardly dare mention it. This is that the mind vampires are, without intending it, the instruments of some higher force. They may, of course, succeed in destroying any race that becomes their host. But if, by any chance, the race should become aware of the danger, the result is bound to be the exact opposite of what is intended. One of the chief obstacles to human evolution is man’s boredom and ignorance, his tendency to drift and allow tomorrow to take care of itself. In a certain sense, this is perhaps a greater danger to evolution—or at le ast, a hindrance—than the vampires themselves. Once a race becomes aware of these vampires, the battle is already half won. Once man has a purpose and a be lief, he is almost invincible. The vampires might serve, therefore, to i noculate man against his own indifference and laziness. However, this is no more than a casual speculation... The next problem is more important than all this speculation: How is it possible to get rid of them? It is no answer simply to publish ‘the facts’. The historical facts mean nothing at all; th ey would be ignored. In some way, the human race has to be made aware of its danger. If I did what would be so easy— arranged to be interviewed on television, or wrote a series of newspaper articles on the subject—I might be listened to, but I think it more probable that people would simply dismiss me as insane. Yes, indeed, this is a tremendous problem. For short of persuading everyone to try a dose of mescalin, I can think of no way of convincing people. And then, there is no guarantee that mescalin would bring about the desired result—otherwise, I might risk dumping a large quantity of it in some city’s water supply. No, such an idea is unthinkable. With the mind vampires massed for attack, sanity is too fragile a thing to risk. I now understand why my experiment at Trans-world e nded so disastrously. The vampires deliberately destroyed those people, as a kind of warning to me. The average"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" person lacks the mental discipline to resist them. This is why the suicide rate is so high... * * * I must learn more about these creatures. While my ignorance is so complete, they could destroy me. When I know somethi ng about them, perhaps I shall also know how to make the human race aware of them. The part of the statement I have quoted was not, of course, where I began; I have selected its central passage. The Historical Reflections were actually lengthy reflections on the nature of thes e mind parasites and on their part in human history. The work is in the form of a diary, a diary of ideas. Inevitably, it is extremely repetitive. He is a man who is trying to hold tight on to some central insight, and who keeps on losing it. I was struck by the fact that he was able to concentrate for such long periods. Under his circumstances, I woul d certainly have f ound it harder to suppress my nervousness. But I came to beli eve that this was because he felt that he was now relatively safe from them. He had beaten them in the first battle, and he had the elation of vict ory. His main problem, as he said, was to get other people to believe him. Apparently, he di d not consider this as too urgent. He knew that if he published his findings as they stood, he would be regarded as a madman. In any case, as a scientist, he ha d the habit of trying to verify his facts and to enlarge them as far as possible before announcing them. What puzzled me and continues to puzzle me is that he did not try to confide in anybody, not even in his wife. This in itself shows a peculi ar state of mind. Was he so absolutely certain that he was now in no danger that he felt time no longer mattered? Or was this euphoria another trick of the parasites? Whatever happened, he went on working at his notes, convin ced that he was fighting a winning battle until the day they drove him to suicide. * * * I think my feelings as I read all this can be guessed. At first, incredulity—in fact, the incredulity kept returni ng all day; then excitement and fear. I think I might have dismissed the whole thing as insanity if it had not been for my experience on the wall at Karatepe. I was ready to believe in the existence of these mind vampires. But what then? Unlike Weissman, I had not the streng th to keep it to myself. I was terrified. I knew that the safest thing would be to burn the papers and pretend I had never read them; I was fairly sure th at, in that case, they would leave me alone. I felt very close to insanity. All the time I was reading, I kept glancing around nervously, and then realizing that, if they were watching me, it was from inside. This was an almost unbearable thought until I came across the passage in which Weissman compares their method of ‘eavesdropping’ to listening over a"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" radio. Then I saw that this was reasonable. They were apparen tly in the depth of consciousness, in the realm of the deepest memories. If they came too close to consciousness, they were in danger of revealing themselves. I came to the conclusion that they probably dared to come close to the surface late at night, when the mind was tired and attention wa s exhausted; this explained what had happened on the wall at Karatepe. I already knew what would be my next move. I would have to tell Reich; he was the only man I liked and tr usted deeply enough. Perhaps Karel Weissman’s tragedy was that he liked a nd trusted no one as much as I liked and trusted Reich. But if I intended to tell Reic h, then the safest time would be in the morning, when we were both wide awake. And I knew I was incapable of keeping this secret overnight. And so I called Reich on our private code at the digging. As soon as his face appeared on the screen, I felt closer to sanity. I asked him if he felt like having a meal with me that evening. He asked me if I had any particular reason, and I said no—only that I was feeling better and felt like company. Luck was with me; some directors of A.I.U. were over there that af ternoon and would be returning to Diyarbakir by ro cket at six o’clock. He would be with me by half past. As I pulled out the plug, I had my firs t insight into why Weissman had kept silent about them. This idea of being ‘ overheard’ as if someone was tapping the telescreen line led one to play safe, to behave calmly, to try to keep the thoughts restrained, running on common matters. I ordered a meal downstairs in the director’s restaurant, to which we had access. It seemed somehow safer to tell him there. And in the hour before his arrival, I lay back on the bed, my eyes cl osed, and deliberately tried to relax, to empty my mind. The odd thing is that, by this time, it wasn’t difficult. This exercise of concentrating upon one’s own mind had an exhilarating effect. There were certain things that I began to unde rstand immediately. As an unashamed ‘romantic’, I have always been subject to boredom. This boredom arises out of a kind of mistrust of the wo rld. You feel you can’t ignore it, can’t take your eyes off it and forget it. So you sit staring at a corner of the ceiling when you could be listening to music or thinking about history, held by a strange sens e of duty. Well, I now felt that my duty lay in ignoring the outside world. I knew what Karel meant: that it was vital for the parasites to keep us in ignorance of their existence. Merely to become aware of them was to gain a new feeling of st rength and purpose. Reich came sharp at half past six, and said I looked much better. We had a martini, and he told me what had been happening since I left the site—mostly squabbles about the best angle at which to sink the first tunnel . At seven o’clock, we went down to supper. They gave us a quiet table ne ar the window, and several people nodded to us—we had both b ecome international celebrities in the past two months. When we were seated at table, we ordered iced melon, and he"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" reached for the wine list. I took it from him, saying: ‘I don’t want you to drink any more this evening. You’ll see why late r. We shall both need clear heads.’ He looked at me in astonishment. ‘What’s happening? I thought you said you had nothing on your mind?’ ‘I had to. What I’ve got to tell you has to be kept secret for the present.’ He said, smiling: ‘If it’s as bad as th at, perhaps we’d better check the table for hidden microphones.’ I told him there was no need, beca use what I had to say wouldn’t be believed by an eavesdropper. He was looking baffled by this time, so I began by saying: ‘Do I strike you as fairly normal and sane?’ ‘Of course you do!’ ‘And supposing I told you that in ha lf an hour you’ll be doubting my sanity?’ He said: ‘For Christ’s sake get on with it. I know you’re not mad. What is all this about? Not some new idea about our underground city?’ I shook my head; and since he was l ooking bewildered by th is time, I told him that I’d been reading Karel We issman’s papers all the afternoon. I said: ‘I think I’ve discovere d why he killed himself.’ ‘Why?’ ‘I think you’d better read this particular on e yourself. He explains it better than I could. But the main point is this . I don’t believe he was mad. It wasn’t suicide—it was some kind of murder.’ All the time I was saying this, I was wondering if he w ould think me mad, and I tried to appear as calm and sane as possible. But it was a relief to see that nothing was further from hi s thoughts. He only said : ‘Look, if you don’t mind, we’ll have a drink after all. I need one.’ So we ordered half a bottle of Nuits St Georges, and I helped him drink it. And I told him, as succinctly as I c ould, Weissman’s theories about the mind parasites. I began by reminding him of my experience on the wall at Karatepe, and our discussion. Before I had finished speaking, my respect and liking for Reich had doubled. He would have been justified in humouring me and sending for a strait jacket as soon as he was out of my sight. And the brief account I gave him must have sounded insane enough. Howe ver, he realized that I had read something in Weissman’s papers that had convinced me, and he was willing to be convinced himself. As we went back upstairs after the m eal, I remember my sense of unreality. If I was right, then the c onversation that had just take n place was one of the most important in human history. Yet here we were, two ordinary human beings, trying to get back to the privacy of my room, and being accosted by fat, prosperous looking men who wanted us to meet their wives. It all seemed too normal and commonplace. I looked at th e enormous bulk of Wolfgang Reich ambling ahead of me up the stairs, and w ondered if he really believed the science fiction story I had told him. I knew that, to a large extent, my sanity depended on his believing me."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" In my room, we drank orange juice. Reich now understood why I wanted to k eep an absolutely clear head. He did not smoke. I handed him the folder of the Historical Reflections, and showed him the passage that I have printed above. I reread it, seated beside him. When he had finished, he stood up and walked up and down the room without speaking. I said finally: ‘You realize that, if this is not just a mad dream, I’ve placed your life in danger by telling you?’ He said: ‘That doesn’t bother me. It’s been in danger before. But I’d like to know how far there is any real danger . I’ve not had your experience of these mind vampires, so I’ve no way of judging.’ ‘Neither have I. I know as little as you. Weissman’s other volumes are full of speculations about them, but there’s not hing definite. We have to start almost from scratch.’ He looked at me steadily for severa l moments, then said: ‘You really believe this, don’t you?’ I said: ‘I wish I didn’t.’ It was absurd; we were talking like two characters out of a Rider Haggard novel; yet it was all real. We talked to no purpose for half an hour or so, then he said: ‘There's one thing that we have to do immediately, anyway. We must both make a tape recording about all this, and deposit it in a bank tonight. If anything happened to us in the night, it would serv e as a warning. There’s less chance of people thinking two of us are insane than one.’ He was right. We got out my tape recorder, and did what he suggested, reading extracts of Weissman’s notes al oud. Reich had the last word. He said that he was not yet sure whether all this was madness or not. But it sounded sufficiently likely to justify this precaution. We still did not know how Weissman died, and we had his diary for the day before his suicide with notes that sounded completely sane. When the tape was finished, we sealed it in a plastic box, and walked down to drop it into the night safe of the A.I.U. bank. Then I rang the manager at home, told him that we had deposited a ta pe containing certain important ideas in his night safe, and asked for it to be kept in his vaul t until it was needed. We encountered no difficulty here; he a ssumed that it was some important information that concerned the diggings and A.I.U., and promised to give it his personal attention. I said I thought we now both needed a night’s sleep, and explained my idea that the parasites have less power over the fully conscious mind. We agreed to keep an open telescreen line between us all night, in case either needed help. Then we separated. Without hesitation, I took a strong sedative although it was barely ten o’clock and went to bed. Wh en my head touched the pillow, I willed myself not to lie awake and think, a nd I fell asleep immediately. My thoughts felt ordered and discipline d; I had no difficulty in preventing my mind from wandering."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" At nine the next morning, Reich woke me up, and sounded relieved to find I was all right. Ten minutes later, he came over to have breakfast. It was now, sitting in a sunlit room and drinking iced orange juice, that we did our first useful thinki ng about the parasites. Our minds felt alert and fresh, and we recorded the whole conversation on tape. First of all, we discussed the problem of how far we could keep our knowledge a secret from them. The answer was that we had no way of know ing. Yet Weissman had survived for six months, which indicated that the danger was not immediate. What is more, they knew that Weissman was on to them; they had actually resisted his attempts to turn his mind upon the problem. So he was a marked man from the beginning. On the other hand, I had felt no alien pres ences the day before as I read the Historical Reflections, and af ter I had mastered that init ial feeling of anxiety and panic I had felt exceptionally healthy, mentally and physically. I was rising to the challenge. (My grandmother once told me th at during the early days of the last World War, every one seemed happier and more resilient than ever before, and now I understood perfectly.) So it was possible that ‘they’ didn’t ye t realize that Weissman’s secret was out of the bag. This was hardly surpri sing. We did not know their numbers—or even whether the concept of number applied to them—but if they had the problem of policing five billion people —the present world population—then the danger was not too great. Let us, said Re ich, suppose that Jung’s theory is correct, and that the human race has one great ‘mind’, a vast ocean of the ‘subconscious’. We also suppose that thes e parasites are creatures that inhabit the depths of this ocean, and avoid coming too close to the surface for fear of detection. In that case, they might not discover what we know for years, provided we did not give ourselves awa y, as Weissman did, by alarming them. That set a problem. On the previous ev ening, we had both felt that the best way to learn more about the parasites wa s to experiment with drugs that would enable us to explore our own minds. No w we realized that this would be dangerous. In that case, was there any way in which we could learn about the mind without the use of drugs? Luckily for us, this was a problem a bout which Weissman had written at length. We discovered this in the course of the day, going through the Reflections page by page. Husserl’s phenomenology was the method we needed. Husserl was concerned to map the ‘s tructure of consciousness’ (or its ‘geography’ as we preferred to say) by means of conscious reflection alone. And as we thought about the matter, we saw that this was common sense. If you are going to map an unknown continent—let us say, one of the jungles of Venus— you do not have to waste much time ploddi ng among the trees. You rely mainly on instruments, and on your helicopter. Wh at is most important is that you should become proficient at recogn izing what is below you—knowing how to recognize swamp land by its colour, and so on. Well, where the geography of the human mind is concerned, the main problem is not to plunge into the realms below consciousness, but to learn to fit words to what we do know about it. With"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" the use of a map, I could walk from Pa ris to Calcutta; without a map, I might find myself in Odessa. Well, if we had a similar ‘map’ of the human mind, a man could explore all the territory that lie s between death and mystical vision, between catatonia and genius. Let me put this another way. Man’s mind is like some vast electronic brain, capable of the most extraordinary feat s. And yet unfortunately, man does not know how to operate it. Every morning wh en he wakes up, man crosses to the control panel of that vast brain, and proceeds to turn knobs and press buttons. And yet this is the absurdity: with the immense machine at his disposal, he knows only how to make it do the simplest things, to deal with the most obvious, everyday problems. It is true that ther e are certain men whom we call men of genius, who can make it do far more ex citing things: write symphonies and poems, discover mathematical laws. A nd then there are a few men who are perhaps the most important of all: men w ho use this machine to explore its own capabilities. They use the machine to find out what they can do with the machine. They know that it is capable of creating the Jupiter symphony and Faust and The Critique of Pure Reason a nd multi-dimensional geometry. Yet in a sense, these works have been achieved by accident, or, at least, by instinct. Well, many great scientific discoveries have been stumbled on by accident; but when they have been discovered, the scientist’s first task is to learn the hidden laws that govern them. And this el ectronic brain is th e greatest of all mysteries, for to know its secret would turn man into a god. So to what better purpose can consciousness be employed than to explore the laws of cons ciousness? And this is the meaning of the word ‘phenomenol ogy’, perhaps the most important single word in the vocabulary of the human race. The sheer size of the task overawed us. Yet it did not depress us. No scientist could be depresse d at the prospect of e ndless discovery. Again and again—I should say a thousand times ove r the next few months—we made the same remark: that we could understand th e vampires’ need for secrecy. Because everything depended on the human race taking its mental sickness for granted as a natural condition. Once it began to que stion it, to fight it, nothing could stand in its way. I remember that we went down to the canteen for tea at mid-morning. (We decided that coffee might qualify as a drug, and should be avoided.) As we crossed the main square of A.I.U., we found ourselves looking at these people around us with a kind of god-like pity. They were all so preoccupied with their petty worries, all enmeshed in their pe rsonal little daydreams, while we at last were grappling with realit y—the one true reality, that of the evolution of mind. There was one immediate result. I bega n to lose my exce ss weight, and my physical health became perfect. I always slept well and deeply, and awoke feeling calm and totally healthy. My mental processes began to gain a feeling of amazing precision. I thought calmly, slow ly, almost pedantically. We both realized the importance of this. Weissman had compared the parasites to sharks."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" Well, the quickest way for a swimmer to a ttract the attention of a shark is to splash and shout on the surface. We we re not going to make that mistake. Both of us returned to the diggings, but soon made excuses to spend a minimum of time there. This was not difficult, for most of what remained to be done was a problem for engineers rather th an archaeologists. Reich, in any case, had thought of moving his equipment to Australia, to investigate the site described by Lovecraft in The Shadow Out of Time, since our present finds left no doubt that Lovecraft was some sort of clairvoyant, and the possibility was worth exploring. Now, in August, we simply decided to take a holiday, making the hot season our excuse. Both of us were daily on the lookout fo r any sign of the parasites. We were working well and smoothly; both of us we re experiencing th e same sense of physical and mental well-bei ng, and we maintained a c onstant vigilance for any of the kind of mental ‘int erference’ that Karel ha d described. There was none, and we were puzzled about it. I accide ntally discovered the reason when I revisited London in early October. The lease on my Percy Street flat needed renewing, and I could not make up my mind whether it was worth the trouble. So I took the morning rocket to London, and was in my flat by eleven in the morning. And the moment I entered, I knew they were watching me. Months of expecting them had sensitized me. In the old days, I would have ignored this sudden feeling of depression, of some obscure danger, dismissed it as indigest ion. Since then, I had learned a great deal. I had learned, for example, that wh en human beings have that unheralded ‘shivery’ feeling, which they describe as ‘someone walking on my grave’, it is usually an alarm signal; some parasite has blundered too close to the surface of consciousness, and the shiver is due to awareness of the presence of the alien. In my room, I knew immediately that the mind parasites were watching me. It may sound paradoxical to say that they were ‘there’ in my room, when I have already said they were inside me. This is due to the inad equacy of everyday language. In a certain sense, universal mind and universal space-time are coincidental, as Whitehead understood. Mind is not really ‘inside’ us in the same sense that our intestines are. Our indi viduality is a kind of eddy in the sea of mind, a reflection of the total identity of the universal humanity. So when I went into my room, the parasites were at once inside me and waiting for me there. It was the papers they were there to guard. The weeks of training had had their effect. I allowed my mind to bend to the sway of their observati on as a tree might bend in the wind, or as a sick man bends to his sickness. Again, I had a f eeling of being observed by octopuses rather than sharks, by baleful creatures of stillness. I went about my business pretending not to notice them. I even went over to the cabinets and glanced inside, allowing the upper part of my mind to respond to the folders on psychology with its usual i ndifference. It was now that I became clearly aware that I had developed a new power of mi nd. I was quite detached from the human being I would have called ‘Gilbert Austin’ two months earlier, as detached as a"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" puppet master from his puppet. And ye t while I was being watched by the parasites, I blended into my old self, and became, so to speak, a mere passenger of my old self. I had no fear that I might give myself away. I was too well- controlled for that. I had sw itched over on to the circuits of the old ‘Gilbert Austin’, and it was now he who walked around the room, rang Hampstead to enquire after Mrs Weissman’s health, and finally rang a storage firm to take away the furniture (which was my own) and the filing cabinets to a warehouse. After that, I went down and spoke to my landlord, then spent the rest of the day in the British Museum talking to Herman Bell, head of the archaeology department. All the time, I was still aw are of being under the observation of the parasites, although more distan tly now. Since I had told the removal firm to fetch the filing cabinets, their inte rest had obviously slackened. For nearly forty-eight hours, I cont rolled my mind to think of nothing but routine matters connected w ith the Karatepe digging. Th is was not as difficult as it sounds (as many of my s econd stage readers will know). It was merely a matter of identifying myself with my part , like a ‘method actor’, of participating in Bell’s excitement about the excavations, and so on. I walked around London and saw friends; I allowed myself to be lured to a ‘small party’ to be lionized. (It turned out to be an enormous party; the hostess rang about a hundred guests as soon as I promised to be there.) I deliber ately allowed my mind to work in its old manner: that is to say, badly. I let myself get overexcited, and then depressed. On the plane home, I allowed myself to wonder whether the whole thing had not been a stupid waste of time, and made a resolution not to let myself be lionized in this manner again. When the A.I.U. helicopter landed me in Diyarbakir, I had a feeling that the sky was clear again; but I continued to shield my thoughts for the next forty-eight hours, just in case. Re ich was luckily back at the diggings, so there was no temptation to relax my precautions. As soon as he returned, I told him my story. I said I thought that the rem oval of the filing cabinets into storage probably reduced ‘their’ interest in me to nil. But neither of us had any intention of allowing ourselves to become over-confident. This experience led us to formulate another theory about the parasites. Clearly, they did not keep watch on every human being all the time. In that case, why did not people simply ‘recover’, as we had, when there were no parasites around? The question bothered us for twenty-four hours. It was Reich who came up with the answer. He happened to talk to the wife of Everett Reubke, the President of A.I.U.; her husband had just gone off for a fortnight to the moon as a ‘rest cure’. She admitted that his nerves were ragged. ‘But why?’ asked Reich. Surely things were going excellently for the company? ‘Oh yes,’ she said. ‘But when a man is president of a concern as bi g as A.I.U., he gets into the habit of worrying, and sometimes can’t stop.’ That was it! Habit! How obvious, how self-evident, when you thought about it! Psychologists had been telling us for years that the human being is largely a machine. Lord Leicester compar ed human beings to grandfather clocks"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" driven by watch springs. A single traumatic experience in childhood could be the foundation for a lifelong neurosis. One or two happy experiences in early childhood can make a man an optimist for life. The body will destroy the germs of a physical illness within a week; but the mind will preserve germs of morbidity or fear for a lifetime. Why? B ecause the mind tends to be stagnant, as far as the life-forces go. It works on ha bit, and these habits are tremendously difficult to break, particularly the nega tive ones. In other words, once a human being has been ‘conditioned’ by the mind pa rasites, he is like a clock that has been wound up; he only requires attention once every year or so. Besides, Weissman discovered, human beings ‘c ondition’ one another, and save the parasites work. The parents’ attitude to life is passed on to the children. One gloomy and pessimistic writer with a power ful style affects a whole generation of writers, who in turn affect almost every educated person in the country. * * * The more we learned of the parasites, the more we realized how terrifyingly simple the whole thing was, and the more it seemed an impossible piece of luck that we should have stumbled on their secret. It was to be a very long time before we understood that ‘luck’ is as unsatisfact ory and vague as most of the abstract nouns in our language, and that someth ing quite different was at issue. Naturally, we spent a lot of time disc ussing who else could be entrusted with our secret. This was a difficult pr oblem. We had made a good start, but one false step could ruin everythi ng. First of all, we had to make sure that we picked people who were mentally ready to receive what we had to say. This was not so much a matter of being thought insane—w e were no longer very worried about that—but of making sure that some carel essly chosen ‘ally’ did not give the whole thing away. We did much reading of psychology and philosophy, to find out whether there were other minds that were alre ady thinking along th e right lines. We found several, but we were still cautious. By luck, Reich and I had quickly picked up the techniques of phenome nology; because neither of us were philosophers, and had no preconceptions to get rid of, Husserl’s seed fell on fertile ground. But since this was a battle, we had to work out a way of training people to this mental discipline. It was not enough to rely on their ordinary intelligence. They had to be taught to defend themselves against the mind parasites in the shortest possible space of time. The fact, you see, is this. Once you have got the knack of using the mind properly, everything follows easily. It is a matter of breaking a habit that human beings have acquired over millions of years; of giving all their attention to the outside world, and thinking of ‘imagination’ as a kind of escapism, instead of recognizing that it is a brief excursion into the great unknown countries of the mind. You had to get used to thinki ng how your mind worked. Not just your ‘mind’ in the ordinary sense, but yo ur feelings and pe rceptions as well."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" * * * I found that by far the most difficult thi ng, to begin with, was to realize that ‘feeling’ is just another form of percep tion. We tend to keep them in separate compartments. I look at a man, and I ‘see’ him; that is objective. A child looks at him and says: ‘Ooh, what a horrid man’. The child feels about him, and we say that is ‘subjective’. We are unaware of how stupid these classifications are, and how much they confuse our thinking. In a sense, the child’s feeling is also a ‘perception’. But in a far more important sense, our ‘seeing’ is also a feeling. Think for a moment of what happens if you are trying to adjust a pair of binoculars. You turn the little wheel, and everything is a blur. Suddenly, a single extra turn makes everything become clear and sharp. Now think what happens if someone says to you: ‘Old so-and-so died last night’. Usua lly, your mind is so full of other things that you don’t feel a nything at all or rather, your feeling is indistinct, blurred, just as if the binoculars are out of focus. Perhaps weeks later, you are sitting quietly in your room reading, when something reminds you of old so-and-so who died, and quite suddenly you feel acute grief for a moment. The feeling has come into focus. What more is necessary to convince us that feeling and perception are basically the same thing? This is a work of history, not of philosophy, so I do not propose to go into phenomenology at any length. (I have done so in other books, and I would also suggest the books of Lord Leicester as an excellent introducti on to the subject.) But this much philosophy is necessary to understand the history of the fight against the mind parasites. Because, as we realized when we thought about this matter, the chief weapon of the parasi tes was a kind of ‘mind-jamming device’ that could be loosely compared to a ra dar-jamming device. The conscious human mind ‘scans’ the universe all the time. ‘The wakeful life of the ego is a perceiving’. It is like an astronomer scanning the skies for new planets. Now an astronomer discovers new planets by comp aring old star photographs with new ones. If a star has moved, then it isn’ t a star, but a planet. And our minds and feelings are also constantly engaged in this process of scan ning the universe for ‘meanings’. A ‘meaning’ happens when we compare two lots of experience, and suddenly understand someth ing about them both. To take an extremely simple example, a baby’s first experience of fire may give it the impression that fire is wholly delightful: warm, bright, interesting. If he then tries putting his finger into the fire, he learns something new about it—that it burns. But he does not therefore decide that fire is wholly unpleas ant—not unless he is exceptionally timid and neurotic. He superimposes th e two experiences, on e upon another, like two star maps, and marks down that on e property of fire must be clearly separated from its others. This process is called learning. Now supposing the mind parasites deliberat ely ‘blur’ the feelings when we try to compare our two experiences. It would be as if they had exchanged an astronomer’s spectacles for a pair with lenses made of smoked glass. He peers"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" hard at his two star maps, but cannot make much out. We do not learn clearly from experience when this happens. And if we happen to be weak or neurotic, we learn entirely the wrong thing—that fi re is ‘bad’ because it burns, for example. I apologize to non-philosophi cal readers for these explanations, but they are quite essential. The aim of the parasites was to prevent human beings from arriving at their maximum powers, and th ey did this by ‘jamming’ the emotions, by blurring our feelings so that we faile d to learn from them, and went around in a kind of mental fog. Now Weissman’s Hist orical Reflections we re an attempt to examine the history of the past two cen turies to discover exactly how the parasites had conducted their attack on th e human race. And this was one of the first things he realized. Take those ‘romantic’ poets of the early nineteenth century—men like Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley, Goethe. They were quite different from the poets of the previous century—Dryden, Pope and the rest. Their minds were like powerful binoculars with a sharper power of focusing human existence. When Wordsworth looked down on the Thames from Westminster Bridge in the early mo rning, his mind suddenly roared like a dynamo, and superimposed a great many experiences on top of one another. For a moment, he saw human life from above , like an eagle, instead of from our usual worm’s eye view. And whenever a man sees life in this way—whether he is a poet or a scientist or a statesman—the result is a tremendous feeling of power and courage, a glimpse of what lif e is all about, of the meaning of human evolution. Well, it was at this point in history, just as the human mind had taken this tremendous evolutionary leap forward—e volution always proceeds by leaps, like an electron jumping from one orbit to a nother—that the mind pa rasites struck in force. Their campaign was cunning a nd far sighted. They proceeded to manipulate the key minds of our planet. To lstoy glimpsed this truth in War and Peace, when he declared that individuals play little part in history, that it moves mechanically. For all of the protagonist s of that Napoleonic war were moving mechanically—mere chess men in the hands of the mind parasites. Scientists were encouraged to be dogmatic and mate rialistic. How? By giving them a deep feeling of psychological ins ecurity that made them grasp eagerly at the idea of science as ‘purely objective’ knowledge—just as the paras ites had tried to divert Weissman’s mind into mathematical probl ems and chess. The artists and writers were also cunningly undermined. The parasites probably looked with horror upon giants like Beethoven, Goethe, Shelley, realizing that a few dozen of these would set man firmly on the next stag e of his evolution. So Schumann and Holderlin were driven mad; Hoffmann wa s driven to drink, Coleridge and de Quincey to drugs. Men of genius were ruthlessly destroyed like flies. No wonder the great artists of the nine teenth century felt that the world was against them. No wonder Nietzsche’s brave effort to s ound a trumpet call of optimism was dealt with so swiftly—by a lightning-stroke of madness. I shall not go into this matter at length now—Lord Leicester’s books on the subject document it exhaustively."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" * * * Now, as I have said, the moment we recognized the existence of the mind parasites, we escaped their cunningly laid trap. For it was nothing less than a history trap. History itself was their chie f weapon. They ‘fixed ’ history. And in two centuries, human history became a parable of the weakness of human beings, the indifference of nature, the he lplessness of man co nfronting Necessity. Well, the moment we knew that history had been ‘fixed’, it ceased to take us in. We looked back on Mozart and Beethoven and Goethe and Shelley, and thought: Yes, great men would have been two a pe nny if it hadn’t been for the parasites. We saw that it is nonsense to talk a bout human weakness. Human beings have enormous strength when it is not bei ng sucked away every night by these vampire bats of the soul. This knowledge in itself was naturally enough to fill us with enormous optimism. And at this early stage, th is optimism was increased by our ignorance of the parasites. Since we knew that they attached such importance to secrecy, to the human race being ignorant of their exis tence, we leapt to the conclusion—for which we would pay dearly—that they had no real power of doing harm. The problem of Karel’s suicide bothered us, but his widow had provided me with a plausible theory. Karel took saccharines in his tea. Th e bottle of cyanide tablets resembled the saccharine bottle. Supposing he was working hard, and had absent-mindedly dropped cyanide in his tea instead of saccharine? The smell would give it away, of course. But supposing the parasites ha d some way of blanketing the sense of smell, ‘jamming’ it, so to speak? Perh aps Karel was sitting unsuspecting at his desk, concentrating upon his work, rather over-tired, perhaps. He reaches out automatically for the saccharine, and one of the parasites gently guides his hand a few inches to the left... Reich and I were both inclined to accep t this theory, which fitted with the presence of cyanide in the tea. It also f itted with our view that the parasites were fundamentally no more dangerous than any other parasite—woodworm or poison ivy—that, provided you knew about them and took measures against them, all would be well. We told ourselves that we would not be as vulnerable as Karel Weissman. There were a limited number of ways in which the parasites could try to trick us as they had tricked Karel. They might lead us to make some error when driving a car, for example. Driving is very much a matter of instinct, and this instinct could easily be tampered with when you were driving at ninety miles an hour and concentrating on the road. So we agreed never to drive in a car, under any circumstances, or to allow ourselv es to be driven. (A chauffeur would be even more vulnerable than we our selves.) Travelling by helicopter was another matter—the automatic radar controls meant that a crash was almost impossible. And one day, when we hear d that a soldier ha d been killed by a berserk native, we realized that this was another possibi lity that had to be taken"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" into account. For that r eason, both of us carried guns, and made a point of avoiding crowds. Still, during those first months, everyt hing went so well that it was difficult not to become over-optimistic . In my early twenties, when I was learning about archaeology under Sir Charles Myers, I ex perienced a delight, an intensity, that made me feel I had only just started liv ing. But it was nothing to the intensity that I now felt continuously. It became clear that there is a fundamental mistake about ordinary human existence—as absurd as trying to fill a bath with the plug out, or driving a car with the hand brake on. Somethi ng that ought to build up into a greater and greater intensity is lost minute by minute. Once this is recognized, the problem vanishes. The mi nd begins to brim with a sense of vitality and control. Instead of being at the mercy of moods and feelings, we control them as easily as we control th e movements of our hands. The result can hardly be described to anyone who has not experienced it. Human beings get so used to things ‘happening’ to them. They catch cold; they feel depressed; they pick something up and drop it; they e xperience boredom... But once I had turned my attention into my own mind, these th ings ceased to happen, because I now controlled them. I can still remember the greatest experience of those early days. I was sitting in the library at A.I.U. at thre e o’clock one afternoon, reading a new paper on linguistic psychology, and speculating whether its author could be trusted with our secret. Some references to Heidegger, the founder of this school, excited me, for I suddenly saw clearly the error that had crep t into the foundation of his philosophy, and how, with this er ror corrected, tremendous new prospects would open up. I started to make shortha nd notes. At this moment, a mosquito buzzed viciously past my ear with its hi gh pitched whine; a moment later, it came past again. My mind still full of He idegger, I glanced up at it, and wished that it would find its way to the window. As I did so, I had a distinct sense of my mind encountering the mosquito. It veered suddenly off its course and buzzed across the room to a closed window. My mind kept a firm grasp on it, and steered it across the room to the fan vent in the open window, and outside. I was so astonished that I sat back a nd gaped after it. I could hardly have been more astonished if I had suddenly sprouted wings and started to fly. Had I been deceived in supposing that my mind had guided the creature? I remembered that the washroom had a plague of wasps and bees, for there was a bed of peonies undern eath its window. I went along there. It was empty, and there was a wasp buzzing against the frosted glass of the window. I leaned my back against the door, and concentr ated on it. Nothing happened. It was frustrating—there was a sense of doing something wrong, like trying to pull open a locked door. I cast my mind back to He idegger, felt the lift of exaltation, of vision, and suddenly felt my mind click into gear. I was in contact with the wasp, just as certainly as if I was holding it in my hand. I willed it to move across the room. No, ‘willed it’ is the wrong phrase. You do not ‘will’ your hand to open and close; you just do it. In the same way, I drew the wasp across the washroom"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" towards me; then, just before it reached me, made it turn and veer back to the window, and out. It was so incredible that I could have burst into tears, or roared with laughter. What made it so funny was that I could somehow feel the wasp’s angry astonishment at being made to do this against its will. Another wasp buzzed in—or perhaps the same one. I caught it again. This time, I was aware of my fatigue. My mind wasn’t used to this kind of thing, and its grip was slipping. I went to the window and looked out of the flap at the top. A large bumble bee was rifling the honey from a peony. I let my mind grasp it, and willed it to come out. It resisted, and I could feel its resistance as directly as one can feel the pull of a dog on its lead when you take it for a walk. I exerted my strength, and it buzzed angrily out of the flower. I suddenly felt mentally tired, and let it go. However, I did not do what I used to do in the old stupid days—let my fatigue plunge me into depression. I simply let my mind relax, deliberately soothing it, and turned my thoughts elsewhere. Ten minutes later, in the library, the feeling of me ntal cramp had disappeared. I now wondered whether I could exerci se this same mental power over dead matter. I turned my attention to a lipstick-stained cigarette butt that someone had left in an ashtray at the next table, and tried to move it. Yes, it switched across the ashtray, but it cost me a far greater effort than with the bee. And at the same time I received another surprise. I felt a distinct shock of sexual desire in my loins as my mind touched the cigarette. I withdrew from it, then touched it again; once again I felt the s hock. I discovered later that the cigarette butt had belonged to the secretary of one of the directors, a full-lipped, dark- haired woman who wore very powerfu l horn-rimmed glasses. She was about thirty-five, unmarried, rather neurotic, and neither attractive nor unattractive. At first, I assumed that the shock of desire had come from me—had been a normal male reaction to the sexual stimulus of the lipstick-stained cigarette. But next time she came to sit near me in the library, I let my mind reach out cautiously to touch her, and was almost electrocuted by the musky, animal shock of sexual desire that came from her. It was not that she was actually thinking about sex— she was wading through a volume of statis tics—or that she felt desire for any particular person. She apparently lived w ith this high-tension sexual current, and regarded it as perfectly normal. I learned something else from her. As my mind withdrew from the contact, she glanced at me speculatively. I went on reading, and pretended not to notice her. After a while, she lost interest and we nt back to her statistics. But it proved that she had been aware of my ‘menta l probe’. The men I had tried it on had remained totally unaware. It seemed to prove that a woman, particularly a sexually frustrated woman, has an abnormal sensitivity to such things. However, this came later. For the mo ment, I only tried moving the cigarette butt, and found that, although it could be done, it was hard work. This was because it was dead. It is easier to make a living object do what you want, because its vitality can be used by you, and there is no inertia to overcome."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" Later that afternoon, still absorbed in my new discovery, I tore up some cigarette paper into tiny pieces, and am used myself by making the small flock rush around the table like a snowstorm. This was also exhausting, and I had to give it up after about fifteen seconds. That evening, Reich came over from Karatepe, and I told him of my discovery. He was even more excited than I was. Oddly enough, he did not immediately try the experiment himself. Instead, he analysed it and discussed its possibilities. Of course, human beings had known about this possibility of ‘psychokinesis’ for half a century, and Rh ine had investigated it at Duke. He defined psychokinesis (or PK) as a phenomenon ‘in which the individual produces an effect upon some object in his environmen t without the use of his own motor system’. ‘Thus’, he adds, ‘psy chokinesis is the direct action of mind upon matter’. Rhine had been put on to the problem by a gambler who remarked that many gamblers believe they can influe nce the fall of the dice. He conducted thousands of experiments into the matter, and his results revealed what I had myself experienced—that, after a while , the mind gets tired of exercising ‘psychokinesis’. There were far more ‘hits ’ at the beginning of the experiment than later on, and the number reduced steadily as the expe riment proceeded. So human beings have always possesse d PK powers in a minor degree. The increase in strength of my mind sin ce I had been practising phenomenological disciplines simply meant that I was able to direct a more powerful stream of mental energy into psychokinesis. Reich’s mind soared like a hawk releas ed from its lead. He predicted the day when we would be able to raise the ruins of Kadath to the surface with no machinery of any sort, and when man w ould be able to travel to Mars by a spontaneous act of will, without the need for a space ship. His excitement infected me, for I saw that he was correct in saying that this was our greatest advance so far, in a philosophica l as well as a practical sense. For, in a certain sense, man’s scien tific progress has been progress in the wrong direction. Take the matter of the Ka ratepe diggings; we had been treating it purely as a mechanical problem, how to raise a city from underneath a billion tons of earth, and this relia nce on machines meant that we were ceasing to treat the human mind as an essential element in the operation. And the more this same human mind produces labour-saving machines , the more it bli nds itself to its own possibilities, the more it tends to regard itself as a passive ‘reasoning machine’. Man’s scientific achievement ove r the past centuries had only thrust man deeper and deeper into a view of himself as a passive creature. I warned Reich that so much mental excitement might attract the attention of the parasites. At this, he forced himself to be calm. I tore up a few cigarette papers, and moved them across the desk for him, pointing out as I did so that it was all I could do—to move these two grammes of paper—so that, in fact, I was better equipped to dig my way to the ruin s of Kadath with a pick and shovel than with my mind! Reich now tried moving the papers, and failed. I tried to explain to him the ‘trick’ of getting the mind into gear, but he couldn’t do it. He tried for"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" half an hour, and couldn’t move even the tiniest piece of paper. He finished the evening more depressed than I had seen him for a long time. I tried to cheer him up by pointing out that it was simply a knack that might come at any moment. My brother could swim when he was th ree years old, but it took me until I was eleven to acquire the knack. And, in fact, Reich acquire d it about a week later. He rang me up in the middle of the night to tell me about it. He had been sitting up in bed reading a book on child psychology when it happened. Thinking about the way that some children seem to be ‘acciden t prone’, he had recognized how far this is due to the child’s own mind. And as he thought about these hidden mental forces that we learn to control with such painful effort, he suddenly realized that, in exactly the same way as an ‘accident prone’ child, he had been holding back his own powers of psychokinesis. He concentrated on the page of his book—which was of India paper—and made it turn of its own accord. I gathered from him the next day that he had not bothered to sleep; he had simply spent the night practising PK. He discovered that the ideal material for these exercises was the ashes of burnt cigarette papers. Th ese are so light that the slightest effort of the mind can move them. Moreover, th e slightest puff of breath will send them spinning, and the mind can cat ch them in motion and utilize their energy. After that, Reich developed his PK pow ers far more quickly than I did, having a more powerful brain, as far as simple cerebral discharge is concerned. Within a week, I saw him perform the incred ible feat of causing a bird to veer in its flight, and circle twice around his h ead. This act produced rather amusing consequences, for some secretaries sa w him from a window, and one of them later told the press about it. When a reporter asked Reich about this ‘omen’ of a black eagle circling his head (the story had grown in the te lling), he had to declare that his family had always been bird lovers, and that he had used a special high pitched whistle to attract it. During the next month or so, his secretary had a full time job answering lette rs from societies of bird watchers who wanted him to come and lecture. Af ter this, Reich took car e to practise PK in the privacy of his room! The fact is that I was no t greatly interested in my powers of psychokinesis at this stage, for I failed to grasp their implications. It cost me such an effort to transport a sheet of paper across the room by PK that it was easier to get up and fetch it. So when I read the last act of Shaw’s Back to Methuselah, in which his ‘ancients’ can grow themselves extra arms and legs merely by willing, I felt that Shaw had passed well beyond the bounds of possibility. The business of mapping these mental realms was in every way more exciting and rewarding, for it brought a far more exciting kind of control. Human beings are so used to thei r mental limitations that they take them for granted. They are like sick men who have forgo tten the meaning of health. My mind could now command prospects that were beyond anything I had dreamed of before. For example, I had always been bad at mathematics."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" Now, without the slightest effort, I grasped the theory of functions, multi- dimensional geometry, quantum mechanic s, game theory and group theory. I also read through the fifty volumes of the composite Bourbaki for bedtime reading—I found that I could skip whole pages at a time because the reasoning seemed so obvious. I found that the mathematical studies were valuable in many ways. If I turned my mind to my old l ove, history, it became so easy to ‘realize’ a period, to grasp all its details with an imagina tive intensity that made it into a reality, that I found it too exciting to bear. My mind would soar to a pitch of exalted contemplation that was only to o likely to attract the attention of the parasites. So I stuck to mathematics, a safer study. Here my mind could turn intellectual somersaults, hurtle like a bullet from one end of the mathematical universe to the other, and still remain emotionally sober. Reich was interested enough in my expe rience with the secretary at the next table to carry out some experiment s in this direction. He discovered that about fifty per cent of the women, and thir ty-five per cent of the men at A.I.U. were ‘sexually overcharged ’. This undoubtedly had so mething to do with the heat, and with poor domestic facilities. No w one might have expected that this intensity of sexual emotion would mean that A.I.U. would have a low industrial suicide rate. In fact, it had an excep tionally high one. And when Reich and I discussed this, we saw the reason. The se xual intensity and the high suicide rate were directly related—and re lated, of course, to the ac tivity of the parasites. Sex is one of man’s deepest sources of satisfaction; the sexual urge and the evolutionary urge are closely connected. Frustrate this deep urge in some way, and it overflows; it tries to find sa tisfaction in all ki nds of basically unsatisfactory ways. One of these is promiscuity of which there was a great deal at A.I.U. It is once again a matter of ‘focusing’ emotion. A man believes that a particular woman will afford sexual satisfaction, and persuades her to become his mistress; but the parasites interfere, a nd he is unable to ‘foc us’ his energies in the sexual act. He is now rather bewilder ed. She has ‘given’ herself, according to the common meaning of the phrase, and yet he remains unsatisfied. It is as baffling as eating a large meal and finding your hunger unsatisfied by it. There are two possible outcomes. He d ecides that the trouble lies in his choice of woman, and promptly looks ar ound for someone else. Or he decides that the ordinary sexual act is unsatisfyi ng, and tries to devise ways of making it more interesting: that is to say, he explores the sexual perversions. Reich discovered, by a little discreet questioni ng, that a great many of the unmarried executives at A.I.U. had a reputa tion for ‘peculiar’ sexual tastes. * * * A week after we had started discussing these sexual matters, Reich came into my room one night with a book, which he threw on my table. ‘I’ve found a man we can trust.’"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" ‘Who?’ I snatched up the book and looke d at its title. Theories of the Sexual Impulse, by Sigmund Fleishman, of th e University of Berlin. Reich read passages aloud to me, and I saw what he meant. There could be no possible doubt that Fleishman was a man of excep tional intelligence who was baffled by the anomalies of the sexual impulse. But again and again he used phrases that sounded as if he suspected the existe nce of the mind parasites. He had recognized that sexual perversion is the re sult of some kind of polluting of man’s sexual springs, and that there is an elem ent of absurdity about it, like drinking whisky to quench your thirst. But why, he asked, should man in the modern world find sexual satisfaction so elusive? It is true that he tends to be sexually over-stimulated by books, magazines, films. But the urge to propagate the race is so strong that this should not make a great deal of difference. Even women, whose main instinct has always been to marry and raise children, seem to be succumbing to this rising tide of sexua l abnormality and the number of divorce cases in which the husband accuses the wife of infidelity has been rising rapidly... How can we explain this weaken ing of the evolutionary impulse in both sexes? Could there be some unknown factor, either physical or psychological, that we have failed to take into account? As Reich commented, there were actually places in the book that sounded as if the author was blaming God for a piece of bungling in creating the human sexual impulse, and making it dependen t on a sort of mutual frustration. Yes, it was very obvious that Fleishman was our man, and that in this particular field, we might find others w ho were struck by th e anomalies in the sexual impulse. One of our problems, of c ourse, was how actually to contact the various possible allies—neither of us had time to rush around the world seeking out such people—but in this case it wa s made unexpectedly easy. I wrote to Fleishman, discussing certain points in his book, and professing an interest in the whole subject. I said vaguely that I mi ght soon be taking a trip to Berlin, and would hope to call on him. Within a week, I received a long re ply from him, in the course of which he said: ‘Like ev eryone else in the world, I have been following your investigations with bated breath. Would you think me rude if I suggested coming to see you?’ I replied telling him that he would be welcome at any time, and suggesting that very week-end. He sent me a tele gram of acceptance. Three days later, Reich and I met him off the plane, at Ankara, and brought him back to Diyarbakir in the firm’s rocket. Ever ything about him pleased us. He was a lively, intelligent man in his mid-fifties with a delightful se nse of humour, and the typical German breadth of cultural interest. He c ould talk brilliantly about music, primitive art, philosophy and archaeology. He struck me as one of those few men who have a natural resi stance to the mind parasites. We gave him a good lunch at Diyarbak ir, during which time we talked of nothing but the diggings and the problem posed by the ruins. In the afternoon, we flew out to Karatepe by rocket (A.I.U. found our presence there such excellent publicity that we were allo wed privileges that would have been"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" unthinkable when Reich was only their c onsultant geologist.) The first tunnel was almost completed. We showed Fleishma n what there was to see of it, then the rest of the ‘exhibits’ —the corner broken off the Abhoth block, the electronic photographs of the inscriptions on other blocks, and so on. He was fascinated by the whole problem of a civilization older than the remains of Pekin Man. His own theory was interesting and plausible enough: it wa s that the earth had once been the site of an attempted settlement from another planet, probably Jupiter or Saturn. He agreed with Schrader’s theory that all the planets had held life at some time, and probably—as we know in the case of Mars—intelligent life. He ruled out Mars because the size of the planet—its mass is a tenth of ours—and its low gravity ruled out the possibility of ‘giants’; Jupiter and Saturn both have sufficient mass—and gravitation pull—to produce ‘giants’. Reich countered with his own theory: that the total population of earth had been destroyed several times through cat astrophes involving the moon, and that after each destruction, man had painfu lly to evolve once again from earlier stages. If, as seems almost certain, these moon catastrophes involved great floods, it would explain why these ancient civilizations—millions of years older than Holocene man—were buried so deeply. So the day passed by in wide-ranging di scussions. In the evening, we went to see an excellent performance of The Pirates of Penzance by the A.I.U. operatic society, then had a le isurely meal in the direct or’s restaurant. Reich had arranged for a bed to be made up in his own sitting-room, and it was there that we now went. But still we avoided the actual subject of the mind parasites, remembering the danger of discussing them late at night. But we did persuade Fleishman to talk at length about his theory of the sexual impulse. By midnight he was well into his stride, and had put before us a brilliant exposition of the whole problem. Sometimes we pretended to misunderstand him, forcing him to be more explicit. The results were re warding beyond our hopes. Fleishman, with his sweeping scientific intelligence, had grasped the whole problem. He saw that man’s sexual impulse is basically roman tic, just like his poetic impulse. When a poet receives ‘intimations of immortality’ from the sight of mountains, he knows perfectly well that the m ountains are not really ‘cloud-capped gods’. He knows that his own mind is adding their majesty to them—or rather, is seeing them as a symbol of the hidden majesty of his own mind. Their greatness and aloofness remind him of his own greatness and aloofness. And when a man falls romantically in love with a woman, again it is the poet in him that sees her as an instrument of evolution. The sheer power of the sexual impulse is the power of the god-like in man, and a sexual stimulus can arouse this power as a mountain can arouse his perception of beauty. We must see man, said Fleishman, not as a unity, but as a constant struggle betw een his higher and lower selves. Sexual perversion, as found in de Sade, represents these tw o locked together in conflict—locked togeth er so tightly that you cannot prise them apart. It is the lower self deliberately using the energy of the higher self for its own purposes. At this point, Reich interrupted."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" How, in that case, do you account for th e steep rise in sexual perversion in this century? Ah, precisely, Fleishman said gloom ily. Man’s lower self seems to be getting artificial support from somewhere. Perhaps our civilization is decadent, tired out, and its ‘higher’ impulses are exhausted. Yet no, he could not believe that. Neither could he believe that the modern neurosis is due to man’s inability to get used to being a civilized animal—in fact, a highly industrialized animal. Man has had plenty of time to get adjusted to big cities. No, surely the explan ation must lie elsewhere... At this point, I yawned, and said that I would like to continue the discussion over breakfast, if they wouldn’t mind. We had a long and interesting day planned for Fleishman... Reich agreed with me. All this was too fascinating to discuss when we were tired. So we said goodnight, and all retired. Next morning, at breakfast, we were glad to see that Fleishman was in sparkling spirits. He was obviously finding his week-end highly stimulating. When he asked us what we had planned for the day, we told him that it was something we would prefer to discuss af ter breakfast. Then we went back to Reich’s room, and Reich continued the discussion exactly where we had broken off the night before. Reich quoted back Fleishman’s remark: ‘Man's lower self seems to be getting artificial support from somewhere’. Then he left it to me to tell the story of Karel Weissman, and our discovery of the parasites. It took two hours, and we knew from the beginning that Fleishman had been an excellent choice. For perhaps twenty minutes he suspected an elaborate hoax. Karel’s diaries convinced him otherw ise. From then on, we saw the light breaking on him. When his excitement m ounted, Reich quickly warned him that this was the most certain method of warning the parasi tes, and explained why we had waited until morning before telling him. Fleishman saw our point. From then on he listened quietly and seriously, and from the set of the lines of his mouth, it was clear that the parasites had found another formidable enemy. In a way, Fleishman was easier to convince than Reich had been. To begin with, he had studied philosophy at colle ge, and had done a term on Wilson and Husserl. And then, our PK demonstrat ions were particularly convincing. Fleishman had bought a ball made of col oured leather to take back for his granddaughter; Reich made this bounce al l round the room. I exerted my powers and made a book float across the room , as well as holding a wasp buzzing angrily on the table, unable to move. As we went on explaining, Fleishman kept saying: ‘My God, it all fits in.’ One of the central concepts of his psychology is what he calls ‘the tax on consciousness’. We were able to show him that this ‘tax’ is mostly imposed by the mind parasites. Fleishman was our first pupil. We spent the whole day trying to teach him all we knew: how to sense the presence of the parasites, how to close the mind to them when they seem to be present. Mo re than that was not necessary. He saw the main implication immediately: th at by a kind of trick, man has been prevented from taking possession of a terr itory that belongs to him by right: the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" country of the mind; and that once an individual knows this with complete certainty, there is nothing whatever to prevent him from claiming his right. The veil of fog lifts, and man becomes a trav eller in the mind as he has become a traveller on sea and in the ai r and in space. What he then does is up to himself. He can simply make brief pleasure trips in to this new land, or he can set out to map it. We explained why, at present, we dared not use psychedelic drugs, and we told him of what we had been able to add to the realms of phenomenology. We ate a large lunch—the morning’s work had made us all ravenous—and afterwards it was Fleishman’s turn to talk. As a psychologist, he knew many who had asked the same questions as himself. There were two more in Berlin: Alvin Curtis, of the Hirschfeld Institute, a nd Vincent Gioberti, one of his own ex- students, now a professor at the university. He told us of Ames and Thomson in New York, and Spencefield and Alexey Remizov at Yale, of Shlaf, Herzog, Klebnikov and Didring at the Massachusetts Institute. It was also at this point that he mentioned the name of Geor ges Ribot, the man who would almost destroy us... It was also during the cour se of that afternoon that we first heard the name of Felix Hazard. Reich and I knew little about modern literature, but Hazard’s sexual preoccupations had naturally inte rested Fleishman. We learned that Hazard had a high reputation among the av ant garde for his curious blend of sadism, science fiction and world-weary pessimism. He was apparently paid a regular sum by a Berlin nightclub that cate red for perverts, simply to come and sit there for a stated number of hour s every month and be admired by the clientele. Fleishman described some of Hazard’s work to us, and added the interesting information that he had begun life as a drug addict, but now claimed to have cured himself. Everything he to ld us about Hazard seemed to indicate that this man was another ‘zombi’ of th e mind parasites. Fleishman had met him only once, and had found it an unpleasant e xperience. He said that he had written in his diary: ‘Hazard’s mind is like a newl y opened grave’, and that he had been strangely depressed for days after meeting him. The question now arose: should we work closely together, or should we leave Fleishman to use his own discretion about making allies? We agreed that this latter might be a danger ous course: it would be bette r if all three of us could make such decisions together. On the ot her hand, there might be less time than we thought. The important thing was to ga ther a small army of men of high intellectual standing. Every one we added to our ranks made the task easier. Fleishman had been easy to convince because there were two of us. When there were enough of us, the whole world shoul d be easy to convince. And then the real battle would commence... * * * In the light of what happened, it seems in credible that we could have been so confident. But it must be remembered that luck had been with us all the way, so"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" far. And we had come to believe that the parasites were helpless against men who knew of their existence. As we took Fleishman to his plane that evening, I remember him looking at the crowds in the brilliantly lit streets of Ankara, and saying: ‘I feel as if I’d died over the weekend and been born a different person...’ And in the air terminal, he remarked: ‘It’s strange, but all these people strike me as being asleep. They’re all somnambulists.’ We knew then that we had nothing to worry about where Fleishman was concerned. He was alrea dy taking possession of the ‘country of the mind’. And now things began to happen so sw iftly that whole weeks seem a blur of events. Three days later, Fleishman was back to see us with Alvin Curtis and Vincent Gioberti. He arrived on Thursday morning, and left at five o’clock on Thursday evening. Curtis and Gioberti were all we could have wished, particularly Curtis, who seemed to ha ve approached the problem through the study of existential philosophy, and who ha d come very close to suspecting the existence of the parasites through his own researches. Only one thing disturbed us. Curtis also mentioned Felix Hazard, and strengthened our suspicion that Hazard could be a direct agent of the pa rasites, a ‘zombi’ whose mind had been completely taken over when he was in a drug-stupor. Apparently Hazard produced on many people a curious effect of evil, which neurotic young girls found stimulating. On Curtis, he had reprodu ced the same disturbing effect as on Fleishman. But what was worse, Hazard had twice sneered at Curtis’s work in an avant garde magazine published in Berlin. Cu rtis had to be more careful than the rest of us; he was already suspect in the eyes of the parasites. If we had not been fools, we would have arranged to have Hazard killed. It would not have been difficult. Fleishma n had already developed rudimentary PK powers, and a little more training would strengthen them to a point where he could steer Hazard under a passing car—driven by Curtis or Gioberti. As it was, we felt the usual compunction. It was hard to realize that Hazard was already dead and that it was only a question of making his body useless to the parasites. During the next three weeks, Flei shman came every weekend, always bringing a new ally with him—Spencefie ld, Ames, Cassell, Remizov, Lascaratos (of Athens University), the Grau brothe rs, Jones, Didring, and our first woman recruit, Sigrid Elgström of the Stockholm Institute. All passed through our hands in a space of twenty days. My feelings a bout it all were mixe d. It was a relief to feel that the secret was sp reading, and that Reich a nd I were no longer its sole custodians; but I was always afraid that someone might make a mistake and alert the parasites. Although I had convinced myself that they were not really dangerous, some instinct told me the importance of continued secrecy. Some of the developments were ex tremely exciting. The Grau brothers, Louis and Heinrich, had always been close together, and already possessed a certain ability to communicate telepathic ally. They now outstripped us all in psychokinetic powers, and revealed that we might be underestimating the importance of PK. I was present in the antiquities room of the British Museum"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" when they moved a marble block weighi ng thirty tons by concentrating in unison. The only others present were Ia nnis Lascaratos, Emlyn Jones, Georges Ribot, Kenneth Furneaux (the director of the archaeology section, whom I had ‘initiated’) and myself. The brothers explained that they did this by somehow reinforcing one another’s efforts in a pulse rhythm. At the time, we were completely incapable of understanding them. Before I go on to describe the first disaster that overtook us, I should say something more about PK, since it plays a pa rt in my narrative. It was, of course, a simple and natural consequence of the new purpose given us to fight against the parasites. The first thing I reali zed when I started practising Husserlian disciplines was that human beings have been overlooking an extremely simple secret about existence, although it is obvious enough for anyone to see. The secret is this: that the poor quality of human life—and consciousness—is due to the feebleness of the beam of attention that we direct at the world. Imagine that you have a powerful searchlight, but it has no reflector inside it. When you turn it on, you get a light of sorts, but it rushes off in all di rections, and a lot of it is absorbed by the inside of the searchli ght. Now if you install a concave reflector, the beam is polarized, and stabs forward like a bullet or a spear. The beam immediately becomes ten times as powerful. But even this is only a half measure, for although every ray of light now follows the same path, the actual waves of light are ‘out of step’, like an undisciplined army walking along a street. If you now pass the light through a ruby laser, the result is that the waves now ‘march in step’, and their power is increased a thousand-fold—just as the rhythmic tramping of an army was able to bring down the walls of Jericho. The human brain is a kind of searchlight that projects a beam of ‘attention’ on the world. But it has always been like a searchlight without a reflector. Our attention shifts around from second to second; we do not really have the trick of focusing and concentrating the beam. And yet it does happen fairly often. For example, as Fleishman observed, the sexual orgasm is actually a focusing and concentrating of the ‘beam’ of consci ousness (or attention). The beam of attention suddenly carries more power, and the result is a feeling of intense pleasure. The ‘inspiration’ of poets is exactly the same thing. By some fluke, some accidental adjustment of the mind, th e beam of attention is polarized for a moment, and whatever it happens to be focused on appears to be transformed, touched with ‘the glory and the freshness of a dream’. There is no need to add that so-called ‘mystical’ visions are exactly the same thing, but with an accidental touch of the laser thrown i n. When Jacob Boehme saw the sunlight reflected on a pewter bowl, and declared that he had seen all heaven, he was speaking the sober truth. Human beings never realize that life is so dull because of the vagueness, the diffuseness, of their beam of attention—although, as I say, the secret has been lying at the end of their noses for centuries. And since 1800, the parasites have been doing their best to distract th em from this discovery—a discovery that should have been quite inevitable afte r the age of Beethoven and Goethe and"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" Wordsworth. They achieved this mainly by encouraging the human habit of vagueness and the tendency to waste ti me on trivialities. A man has a sudden glimpse of a great idea; for a moment, his mind focuses. At this point, habit steps in. His stomach complains of being empty, or his throat complains of dryness, and a false little voice whispers: ‘Go and satisfy your physical needs, and then you’ll be able to concentr ate twice as well.’ He obe ys—and immediately forgets the great idea. The moment man stumbles on the fact that his attention is a ‘beam’, (or, as Husserl put it, that conscious ness is ‘intentional’) he has learned the fundamental secret. Now all he has to learn is how to polarize that beam. It is the ‘polarized’ beam that exerts PK effects. Now, what the Grau brothers had discovered, quite accidentally, was how to use each other’s minds as ruby lasers , to ‘phase’ the beam. They were by no means expert at it; they wasted about 99% of the beam’s power. But even the remaining 1% was enough to move thirty tons with the greatest of ease. It would have been enough to move a block weighing five hundred tons if we had had one available. * * * And now to the night of Oc tober the 14th, when catastr ophe struck us. I have no way of knowing who was responsible for al erting the parasites. It was probably Georges Ribot, a rather strange little man who had been initiated by Gioberti. Ribot had written various books on telepat hy, magic, spiritualism, and so on, with titles like The Hidden Temple and Fr om Atlantis to Hiroshima, and founded the magazine Les Horizons de L'Avenir. It would perhaps be unfair to say that Gioberti showed a lack of judgment in choosing him. Ribot was a man of keen intellect and a good mathematician. His books revealed that he had come very close to suspecting the existence of the mind parasites. On the other hand, they were too speculative, not sufficiently scientific. He would pass from Atlantis to atomic physics, from primitive tribal ceremonies to cybernetics. He would spoil a sound argument on evolution by drag ging in some unverified ‘fact’ from spiritualist literature. He would cite cranks and scientists in the same footnote. He came to Diyarbakir especially to see me—a small man with a thin nervous face and intensely penetrating black eyes . He gave me an immediate sense of being less reliable than the others I had met, in spite of his intelligence and knowledge. His movements were too nervous and fast. I had a feeling that he was less stable than the others, less mentally secure. Reich expressed this by saying: ‘He’s not indifferent enough.’ At ten o’clock at night, I was making notes in my room. I suddenly had that ‘shivery’ feeling that told me that the parasites were present. It was exactly as in my Percy Street rooms. I surmised that they were making some kind of periodic check on me, so I simply merged my ne w personality into my old one, and began to think about a chess problem. I delibera tely thought in slow-motion, examining"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" each aspect of the problem minutely, a lthough my mind could have leapt to a conclusion instantly. Halfway through, I a llowed my thoughts to be distracted, and got up to get myself a fruit juice. (I had ceased to drink alcohol; the stimulus could now be achieved quite easily by a mo mentary act of concentration.) Then I pretended that I had lost my grip on th e problem, and started laboriously from the beginning. After half an hour or so of this, I yawned and allowed my mind to grow tired. All this time, I remained awar e that they were watching me, and at a deeper level of consciousness than in Percy Street. A year ago, I would not even have experienced depression under such obs ervation; it was completely outside the range of conscious or unconscious awareness. After I had been in bed for ten minutes , I realized they had gone, and began to speculate on what they could have done to me if they had decided to ‘attack’. It was difficult to tell, but I felt that my mind was strong enough to repulse an exceptionally strong attack. At midnight, my screen rang. It was Reich, and he looked worried. ‘Have they been to you?’ ‘Yes. They went an hour ago.’ Reich said: ‘They only just left me. It ’s my first real experience of them, and I don’t like it. They’re stronger than we thought.’ ‘I don’t know. I thi nk it’s some kind of rout ine check up. Did you manage to hide your thoughts?’ ‘Oh, yes. Luckily I was working on thes e Abhoth inscriptions, so I simply had to concentrate on them and think at half speed.’ I said: ‘Ring me if you need any he lp. I think we might try putting our minds in phase, like the Grau brothers. It might work.’ I went back to sleep. I even to ok the precaution of allowing my consciousness to drift into sleep, in the old way, instea d of shutting it off like a light. I woke up from sleep with a feeling of oppression like a hangover, or the beginnings of some illness. My mind felt rusty and cramped, as my body might have felt cramped if I had fallen asleep in a cold and damp spot. Instantly, I knew that the time for bluff was over. They had moved in quietly while I was asleep, and had me prisoner. I was like a man held tightly by both arms and legs. Now it had happened, it was not as unpleasant as I had expected. Their actual presence was not disgusting, as I had always believed. It was alien, and had an element that I might describe as ‘metallic’. I had no idea of resisting. For the moment, I was like a man under arrest w hose best chance of survival depends pleading to his captors that they are mist aken. So I reacted just as I would have reacted a year ago: with a certain fear, with bewilderment, but with a fundamental lack of panic, a certainty that it was some oppression that I would throw off with a dose of aspirin. I let my mind search my actions in the previous day to try to account for this feeling of illness."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" For about half an hour, nothing else ha ppened. I simply lay there, quite passive and not too worried, wondering if they would relax. I felt that I could exert my strength if necessa ry, and throw them off. Then I began to realize that this wa s no use. They knew that I knew; they knew I was playing possum. And, as if th ey sensed my realization, a new stage began. They began to put pressure on my mind, the kind of pressure that would simply have driven me insane in the old days. Just as physical nausea produces a sense of physical oppression, so their pr essure produced a sense of mental oppression, a kind of nausea. I obviously had to resist, but I decided not to show my hand yet. I resisted passively, as if I were not even aware of their pressure. They probably had a sensation of trying to move a hundred ton block by pushing it. The pressure increased, and I felt quietly confident. I knew I had the strengt h to resist fifty times this much. But half an hour later, I felt as though my mind was supporting a load the size of Mount Everest. I still had plenty of reserve strength, but if this carried on, I might exhaust it. There was nothing but to show my hand. So with an effort like a man bursting his bonds, I threw them off. I focused the beam of my attention to about th e intensity of a sexual orgasm, a nd blasted it at them. I could have increased it to ten times that am ount, but I still wanted to keep them guessing about my strength. I was still ca lm and unpanicked. In a sense, I was almost enjoying this contest. If I won, it meant that in future I did not have to limit my strength carefully, because they now knew in any case. The result of my first effort was di sappointing. The weight vanished and they scattered; but I had a feeling that they were unhurt. It was like trying to hit shadows. It would have been infinitely satisfying to f eel that I’d hit them, like a boxer landing a punch; bu t obviously, I hadn’t. Their attack commenced again immedi ately. This time, it was so sudden and violent that I was forced to parry it from an unprepared position. One might say that I was like a householder facing an attack from a horde of tramps. I had a feeling that these things belonged to some ‘lower’ order, that they were a kind of vermin that had no right in my mind. Like rats from sewers, they had decided that they had the strength to attack, a nd it was my business to show them that they would not be tolerated. I was not afraid; I felt that they were on my ‘territory’. As they came b ack, I lashed out at them, and felt them scatter again. I have occasionally been asked by the uninitiated whether I actually ‘saw’ them, or felt that they had a definite shap e. The answer is no. My sensations can best be envisaged if you imagine how it feels when you are hot and tired, and everything seems to be going wrong. Every time you start to cross the road, a bus almost runs over your feet. You feel as if the whole universe were hostile, like two lines of thugs between whom you have to run a gauntlet. Your feeling of security vanishes, and it seems that ev erything about your life is horribly brittle and destructible. Well, this gives an idea of the form that the attacks took. In the old days, I would have assumed they were merely attacks of pessimism and self-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" pity, and would have promptly found so mething to worry about, so that they seemed reasonable. We all fight such battles a hundred times a day, and those who win them conclusively do so by hurling aside their tendency to be negative, to worry about life, and by thinking in te rms of conquest, of important purposes. We all know this trick of drawing on the ‘secret life’ inside us. My training over the past months had simply made this secret life far more accessible. My strength came from optimism, from ‘positive thi nking’, if I might borrow that dubious phrase. For perhaps an hour, I skirmished with them. I did not let myself worry about what would happen if there we re millions of them, enough to keep attacking me for weeks until my mind was exhausted. When this thought presented itself, I suppressed it. And ye t, of course, it was the basic danger. By five o’clock, I was a little tired, but not at all depressed. It was then that I got the impression that they had received reinforcements, that they were massing for attack. This time, I decided to ri sk letting them get in close. I wanted to find if I could hurt them. So I let them press in on me, like a great crowd. I let them press closer and closer, until I felt I was suffocating. It was a terrifying sensation, like allowing someone to close a vice on your hand. The weight increased. Still I made no resistance. Then, when it seemed to become too heavy to bear, I gathered all the force of my mind, and lashed out at them, as if firing a cannon right into the midst of them. This time, there was no mistake. They may have been as light as a swarm of flies, but they were massed so thickly that they could not retreat quickly enough, and I had the satisfyin g feeling of damaging a large number. * * * Now, for half an hour, there was peace. Th ey were still there, but it was obvious that they were badly shaken. I discovered later why this was. With my months of preparation, I had learned to call on an inner-strength that would be the mental equivalent of a hydrogen bomb. It was the fi rst time I had ever us ed it, so even I had no idea of its power. They had mobbe d me like a horde of rats mobbing a kitten and then discovered they were attacking a full grown tiger. No wonder they were startled. I also felt well satisfie d. Although I had exerted my full strength in repelling them, I had not exhausted myself . I felt as fresh and strong as ever, and the exhilaration of their defeat made me feel as if I could carry on for weeks. But as the daylight began to come through the curtains, I knew I was facing something for which I had not been prep ared. It was a curious sensation, like suddenly feeling cold water round your feet, then feeling it slowly rising up your legs. It took me some time to realize that they were attacking from some part of my mind of whose existence I was unaware. I had been strong because I was fighting them out of knowledge, but I s hould have known that my knowledge of"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" mind was pitifully small. I was like an astronomer who knows the solar system, and thinks he knows the universe. What the parasites were doing was to attack me from below my knowledge of myself. It is true that I had given some small thought to the matter; but I had rightly postponed it as a study for a more advanced period. I had reflected often enough that our human life is based completely on ‘premises’ that we take for granted. A child takes its pa rents and its home for granted; later, it comes to take its country and its so ciety for granted. We need th ese supports to begin with. A child without parents and a regular home grows up feeling insecure. A child that has had a good home may later le arn to criticize its parent s, or even reject them altogether (although this is unlikely); but it only does so when it is strong enough to stand alone. All original thinkers develop by kick ing away these ‘supports’ one by one. They may continue to love their parents and their country, but they love from a position of strength—a strength that began in rejection. In fact, though, human beings never re ally learn to stand alone. They are lazy, and prefer supports. A man may be a fearlessly original mathematician, and yet be slavishly dependent on his wife. He may be a powerful free thinker, yet derive a great deal more comfort than he would admit from the admiration of a few friends and disciples. In short, human beings never question all their supports; they question a few, and con tinue to take the rest for granted. Now I had been so absorbed in the adventure of entering new mental continents, rejecting my old personality and its assumptions, that I had been quite unaware that I was still leaning h eavily on dozens of ordinary assumptions. For example, although I felt my identity ha d changed, I still ha d a strong feeling of identity. And our most fundamental sens e of identity comes from an anchor that lies at the bottom of a very deep sea. I still looked upon myself as a member of the human race. I still looked upon myself as an inhabitant of the solar system and the universe in space and time. I t ook space and time for granted. I did not ask where I had been before my birth or after my death. I did not even recognize the problem of my own deat h; it was something I left ‘to be explored later’. What the parasites now did was to go to these deep moorings of my identity, and proceed to shake them. I ca nnot express it more clearly than this. They did not actually, so to speak, pu ll up the anchors. That was beyond their powers. But they shook the chains, so that I suddenly became aware of an insecurity on a level I had taken completely for granted. I found myself asking: Who am I? In the deepest sense. Just as a bold thinker dismisses patriotism and religion, so I dismissed all the usual things that gave me an ‘identity’: the accident of my time and place of birth, th e accident of my being a human being rather than a dog or a fish, the accident of my powerful instinct to cling to life. Having thrown off all these accidental ‘trappings’, I stood naked as pure consciousness confronting the universe. Bu t here I became aware that this so- called ‘pure consciousness’ wa s as arbitrary as my name. It could not confront the universe without sticking labels on it. How could it be ‘pure consciousness’"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" when I saw that object as a book, that one as a table? It was still my tiny human identity looking out of my eyes. And if I tried to get beyond it, everything went blank. I was not doing all this thinking for f un. I was trying to fi ght my way down to some solid bedrock on which I could take my stand against them. They had simply been cunning enough to show me that I was standing over an abyss. For my mind leapt on to recognize that we also take space and time for granted, although death takes us beyond them. I saw that what I call ‘existence’ means existence in space and time, and that this universe of space and time is not an absolute. Suddenly, everything became absurd. For the first time, a dreadful sense of insecurity and weakness gripped my stomach. I saw that everything I take for granted in this universe can be questioned—that they could all be a trick. As a thinker, I had got into the old roma ntic habit of feeling that the mind is beyond the accidents of the body, that it is somehow eternal and free; that the body may be trivial and particular, but the mind is universal and general. This attitude makes the mind an eternal spectator, beyond fear. But now I suddenly felt: ‘But if the universe itself is arbi trary, then my mind is as casual and destructible as my body’. This is the point where one remembers the times of sickness and delirium, when the mind seem s altogether less durable than the body, when one suspects that it is mainly the body’s toughness that is preventing the mind from disintegrating. Suddenly, abysses of emptiness were ope n beneath my feet. It did not even produce fear; that would be too human a react ion. It was like contact with an icy reality that makes everything human seem a masquerade, that makes life itself seem a masquerade. It seemed to strike at the heart of my life, something I had thought untouchable. I felt like a king who has always given orders and had them obeyed, and who suddenly falls into the ha nds of barbarians who drive a sword into his bowels. It was so horribly and in stantly real that it negated everything I had ever been, made everything an illu sion. In that moment, it became totally unimportant whether the parasites won or not. All my strength, all my courage, ran away. I felt like a ship that has struck a rock, and suddenly realized that it is vulnerable. The parasites did not attack. They watc hed me, as they might have watched a poisoned animal wriggling. I tried to gath er my forces to prepare for attack, but I felt paralysed, exhausted. It seemed poi ntless. My mind’s strength was against me. Instead of flickering inattentively, as in the old days, it contemplated this emptiness unblinkingly. They made a mistake not to attack then. They would have overcome me, for I had lost most of my strength, a nd had not time to recover it. This was how they had killed Karel Weissman—I knew this with certainty. For this vision of futility, of nothingness, also brings the thought that death cannot be worse than this. One f eels that life means clinging to the body and its illusions. One looks back on the body just as one looks down on the earth from a space ship; but in this case, there is a feeling that there would be no point in returning."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" Yes, they should have attacked then. Perhaps Karel’s death convinced them that I would die in the same way, by committing suicide. But there was no such temptation in my case, for my mind was free of the neurotic pressures that w ould have made me dream about release. Only a neurotic woman faints when someone attacks her; a strong-minded woman knows that this is no solution. Now a thought came that helped to turn th e tide. It was this: that since these creatures had deliberately induced this fe eling of total meaninglessness, they must be in some way beyond it. As soon as this idea floate d into my mind, strength began to return. I saw that they had set out to get me into this state, just as turtle hunters used to turn them on their backs; they knew that this was a direction from which human beings were vulnerable. But if this was so, then presumably they themselves knew it was some kind of illusion, this sense of emptiness. My mind was doing its best, but it was making a mistake. An adult can easily browbeat a sma ll child by taking advantag e of his ignorance. He could, for example, drive a child insane by filling his mind with horror stories of the Dracula-Frankenstein variety—and then pointing to Buchenwald and Belsen to prove that the world is even more horrible than these. In a sense it would be true, but it would take an adult to s ee through the fallacy: that Belsen and Buchenwald are not necessary horrors in th e nature of the univ erse; that they can be fought by human decency. Perhaps thes e creatures were taking advantage of my ignorance in the same way? My r easoning seemed accurate enough: that our ability to go on living depends upon a series of supports that have the nature of illusions. But, then, a child can cease to believe that its parents are infallible without ceasing to love them. In other words, there is still a reality left there to love, when the illusions have vanishe d. Could it be that this awful agony—or, rather, this awful lack of agony, this f eeling of utter coldne ss and reality— was no more dangerous than a child’s pain when it falls down? I grasped at this possibility and clung to it. Then another thought came that strengthened me. I realized that when I contemplated this alien ‘universe’, and felt it to be arbitrary absurd, I was making the oldest of human errors: of believing that the word ‘universe’ mean s ‘universe out there’. The mind, as I well knew, was a universe of its own. They had made their first mistake in not attacking me when I was shattered and exhausted. They now made an even greater one. They saw that I was somehow recovering, and they attacked in force. I was panic-stricken. I knew I had not th e strength to fight them off. This glance into the abyss had drained off all my courage; now it had to seep back slowly. At that moment, the full implicati ons of my argument about the child dawned on me. A child can be browb eaten in its ignor ance because it underestimates its strength. It does not rea lize that it is potentially an adult, perhaps a scientist, a poet, a leader."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" In a flash, I saw that perhaps I wa s doing the same thing. And I suddenly remembered Karel’s words about his first ba ttle with the parasites: about how his own deepest life forces had rallied to b eat them. Were there actually deeper levels of strength that I had not ye t called upon? At the same moment, I remembered my frequent feeling, over th e past months, that there was some strange force of luck on our side—what I used to ca ll ‘the god of archaeology’, some benevolent force whose purpose was to preserve life. No doubt a religious man would have id entified that force with God. For me, this was irrelevant. I only knew sudde nly that I might ha ve an unexpected ally in this fight. And as I had this thought, it was as if I heard the trumpets of an army coming to relieve me. The most frenzied exaltation I have ever known swept through me. No form of emotiona l expression could have been adequate for that sense of relief and triumph; crying or laughing or screaming would have been absurd, like trying to empty the sea with a thimble. As soon as it started, it spread like an atomic explosion. I was al most more afraid of it than of the parasites. Yet I also knew that this pow er was being released by myself. It was not really some ‘third force’, outside me and the parasites. It was some great passive benevolence that I had contacte d, something that ha d no power of action in itself, but which had to be approached and used. I overcame my fear and seized it. I cl amped my teeth together and grasped this power with my will. To my amaze ment, I could control it. I turned my attention-beam on the enemy, and then le t the power blast down it, dazzled and drunk by it, seeing meanings that were beyond anything I ha d ever suspected, and quite unable to grasp them in any way. All my words, ideas, concepts, were like leaves in a hurricane. The parasite s saw it coming too late. Obviously, in a sense they were as inexperienced as I wa s. It was the blind fighting the blind. The inexpressibly searing blast hit them like some enormous flame thrower, destroying them as though they were earwi gs. I had no desire to use it for more than a few seconds. Somehow, it would have seemed unfair, like using a machine gun on children. I deliberately turned it off, and felt wave after wave of it roar through me, crackling around my head like sparks of electricity. I could actually see a sort of blue-g reen glow emanating from my chest. It went on and on in waves, like thunder, but I no longer used it. I knew there was no reason to use it further. I closed my eyes, and le t my body take it, aware that it could destroy me. Gradually it subsided, and in spite of my ecstasy and gratitude, I was glad to see it go. It had been far too great. Then I was back in the room—for I had been elsewhere for many hours. The sound of traffic came from below. The electric clock said half past nine. The bed was soaked with sweat—so wet that it seemed as if I had emptied a bath of water over it. My eyesight was affected; I tended to see slightly double, as if everything had an outer ring of light. Things seemed incredibly bright and clear, and I understood for the first time the vi sual effects produced by mescalin on Aldous Huxley."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" I also knew that I was in another ki nd of danger: that I must not try and think about what had happened, because I would only get hopelessly confused and depressed. In fact, the danger was greater than it had been half an hour or so before, when I had looked into an abyss. So I determinedly directed my thoughts elsewhere, to everyday things. I did not want to ask myself why I was fighting the mind parasites if I had such strength, why human beings are fighting life when they could overcome every problem instantaneously. I did not want to speculate whether the whole thing was some kind of play. I hurried to the bathroom and washed my face. I was startl ed that I looked so fresh and normal in the mirror. There was no physical sign of the conflict, except that I seemed slightly thinner. When I stood on the bath room scale, I had another surprise: I was two stones lighter. The telescreen rang. It was the head of A.I.U. I looked at him as if he was from another world. I also noted that he looked somehow relie ved to see me. He told me that reporters had been trying to contact me since eight o’clock. For twenty of my colleagues had died in the night: Gioberti, Cur tis, Remizov, Shlaf, Herzog, Klebnikov, Ames, Thomson, Didring, Lascaratos, Spencefield, Sigrid Elgström—everybody, in fact, except th e Grau brothers, Fleishman, Reich, myself—and Georges Ribot. The first four had apparently died of heart failure. Sigrid Elgström had slashed her wrists, then her throat. Klebnikov and Lascaratos had jumped from high windows. Thomson had apparently broken his neck in some kind of epileptic fit. He rzog had shot his whole family and then himself. Others had taken poison or ove rdoses of drugs. Two died of brain lesions. Reubke was in a state of nerves, thin king about the bad publicity for A.I.U., since almost everyone of the victims had been my guests—and guests of A.I.U.—in the past weeks; Reubke had met most of them himself. I soothed him as best I could—I was shaken myself—and told him not to allow any reporters to get on to me. When he said he had trie d to ring Reich, but got no reply, I felt as though my stomach had turned to ice. Reaction was setting in heavily now. I would have preferred to sleep. But I used my own special dialling code, and rang Reich’s number. When his face app eared on the screen, my relief was unspeakable. Reich’s first words were: ‘T hank God you’re all right.’ ‘I’m all right, but how about you? You look awful?’ ‘Did they come to you in the night again?’ ‘Yes, all night. They came to all of us.’ In five minutes, I was with him—pa using only long enough to tell Reubke that Reich was all right. But when I saw him, I realized this was an overstatement. He looked like a man who is just recovering from a six months’ illness. His flesh had become the colour of cooked veal. He looked older. Reich’s experience had been very much the same as mine—with one significant variation. They had not tried the ‘total undermining’ technique with him. They had merely pressed him hard all night, hurling wave after wave at"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" him. Towards morning, they had produced a kind of crack in his mental armour, a leak in his energy tanks. It was after this that he became so exhausted. And then, when he had begun to believe that defeat was inevitable, the attacks had stopped. I had no difficulty in guessing when this had happened: at the time when I released my ‘energy blast’ at them. Reich verified this. It had happened about half an hour before I rang him. Before that, he had heard the screen ringing, but had been too exhausted to do anything about it. * * * My news about the others depressed him, but then my own story brought back his hope and courage. I tried my best to explain how they had succeeded in undermining me, and how I had called upon the god-force to defeat them. It was all he needed—the knowledge that he wa s mistaken to think we were helpless against them. The characteri stic of ‘initiates’ of th e phenomenological method is that they can recover from physical or mental catastrophes at a great speed— naturally, since they are in direct contact with the sources of power that drive all human beings. In half an hour, Reich no l onger looked ill, and he was talking as excitedly as I was myself. It took me most of the morning to explain to him exactly how they had undermined me, and how it could be combated. For what it involved was teaching Reich to ‘undermine’ himself voluntarily, to examine his own foundations of identity. I discovered that his temperament was very different from mine fundamentally. In certain respects he was far stronger, in others, weaker. At midday, we were interrupted by Reubke, who came up to see us. By this time, every newspaper in the world was headlining the ‘night of suicide’, and speculating about the part Reich and I ha d played. I was told that the whole A.I.U. factory—covering eight hundred acres—had become unapproachable because of thousands of helicopters waiting outside—journalists. A quick mental probe told me that Reubke was not strong enough to be told the full truth. I was tempted to take over his mind completely—I had realized that I could do this since early this morning. A feeling of ‘respect for the individual’ withheld me. Instead, we told him a story that was close to the truth, but easier for him to grasp. What it am ounted to was telling him that the Anti- Kadath Society had been right: our diggi ng at Karatepe had disturbed immense and dangerous forces: the Great Old Ones themselves. The rest of the story was more or less true: that these creatures had a psychic power that could drive men insane. We told him that their aim was to destroy the human race, or at least to enslave them so that the Elder Race could again rule the solar system. But so far, they were not strong enough. If we could defeat them in time, they could be finally expelled from our galaxy, or perh aps even destroyed completely. What we had done was to turn the truth about the parasites into a child’s fable—"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" something that could be easily grasped, something not too frightening. We even gave these creatures a name—the Tsathogguans—borrowed from Lovecraft’s mythology. We ended by placing the quest ion solemnly before him: should the human race be told of its danger, or woul d this create a panic that would be a far greater danger? Reubke turned the colour of putty, and walked up and down the room gasping—he was trying to hold off an asthmatic attack, and I was helping him— and finally said that he thought we had to present our story to the world. It was interesting to see that there was no que stion of disbelief: our two minds had complete power over him. * * * But the ‘Tsathogguans’ were st ill one jump ahead of us, as we found out an hour later. Georges Ribot made a statement to United Press in which he accused Reich and myself of being murderers and confid ence tricksters. Part of his statement ran as follows: ‘One month ago, I was approached by Vincent Gioberti, the assistant of Professor Sigmund Fleishman at the University of Berlin; he told me that a small group of scientists had formed a World Sa fety League, and had suggested me as a member. In due course, I was introduced to other members (here the others are listed), and to the co-founders of the League, Wolfgang Reich and Gilbert Austin, the men who discovered Kadath. Their discovery had given them an idea for saving the world: they had decided that the whole world must be united against some common enemy. This comm on enemy would be the “Great Old Ones” of Kadath... All of us had to ag ree to support this deception whatever happened. Reich and Austin believed th at only a body of well-known scientists could convince the world of their fant astic story... I was asked to undergo hypnosis, like the others, but I refused. Finally, under the threat of death, I agreed to a single session. My own hypnotic powers enabled me to deceive them that I had become their slave...’ In short, Ribot claimed that what ha d happened in the night was the result of a unilateral suicide pact, inspired by myself and Reich. The aim of the pact: to convince the world beyond all shadow of doubt that it was facing a dangerous enemy. Reich and I had claimed that we w ould die with the others, and that our revelations about the Great Old Ones would be published after our deaths. It was fantastic, but ingenious. It all sounded impossible: but then, the suicide of twenty leading scientists was also impossible, and our own alternative explanation was equally fa ntastic and impossible. If it had not been for my own persona l victory over the parasites, this would have been the most depressing mo ment of all. Twenty-four hours ago, everything had seemed perfect; we had reckoned that it would take another month before we were ready to make our announcement to the world, and by then we would have been a formidable team. Now almost everything was ruined,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" and Ribot had become an ally or a victim of the parasites, turning our own best- thought-out plans against us . As far as convincing the world was concerned, the parasites were definitely in the lead. We had no proof of their existence, and they would take care that no proof was fort hcoming. If we announced our story about the Tsathogguans now, Ribot would simply challenge us to produce any proof that they were not our own invention. The only people who would believe us would be the Anti-Kadath Society! It was Reich who said su ddenly: ‘It’s no use sitti ng here brooding about it. We take things too slowly, and these creatures get ahead of us. Speed is essential.’ ‘What do you suggest?’ ‘We’ve got to get the Fleishman and th e Grau brothers together, and find out how badly they’re hurt. If they’re as exhausted as I was four hours ago, the parasites could destroy them now.’ We tried to contact Berlin on the telescreen; it was impossible. The number of calls coming and going around Diyarbak ir ruined long distance reception. We called Reubke, and told him that we needed a rocket plane immediately to go to Berlin, and that total secrecy had to be observed. It was obvious that Reubke was worried about Ribot’s ‘confession’, so we wasted ten minutes in re-energizing his mind. It was disappointing work; he wa s so mentally flabby that it was like trying to fill a bucket with a hole in the bottom. Still, we managed it by appealing to his greed and lust for celebr ity, pointing out that, as our chief ally, his name would go down in history, and that his firm could hardly fail to prosper. Together with Reubke, we arranged a small deception to keep reporters on the wrong track. Reich and I made a tele-reco rding, in which Reich answered the telescreen, and I was visibl e behind him; then Reich shouted irritably at the operator that no calls from outside were to be put through. We arranged that this recording should be shown about half an hour after we had left—some reporter would be put through ‘by accident’. The ruse worked. We were actually ab le to watch ourselves on the rocket’s television as we arrived in Berlin. The reporter who got this ‘scoop’ had tele- recorded it at his end, and within twenty minutes it was being broadcast from the Diyarbakir television station. There had apparently been much speculation about whether we were alive, in spite of Reubke’s statement to the press, so this item of news was immediately given widespr ead publicity. As a consequence, one or two people who thought they recognized us at the Berlin Airport must have decided they were mistaken. At Fleishman’s house, we had no altern ative except to reve al our identity. The place was surrounded by reporters, a nd we would never have got in. But here we both discovered a rather useful as pect of our psychoki netic powers. In a way, we were able to make ourselves ‘invisible’: that is, we were able to intercept any attention directed towards us, and turn it aside, so that people simply did not notice us. We actually managed to get as far as ringing Fleishman’s front door bell before we we re recognized. Then the rush started."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" Luckily, Fleishman’s voice spoke to us out of the intercom, and the moment we identified ourselves, the door opened. A mo ment later, we were inside, and the reporters were rattling the door and s houting messages thr ough the letter box. Fleishman looked better than we expected, but he was obviously exhausted. In a few minutes, we learned that his story was identical with Reich’s—a long night of skirmishes, and sudden relief at exactly eight-twenty-five that morning—allowing for the two hour time lag between Berlin and Diyarbakir. This raised my spirits considerably: at least I had saved the lives of two of my colleagues, and saved the night from complete disaster. Fleishman was also able to tell us about the Grau brothers who were at present in Potsdam, their home. He had been able to contact them that morning, before reporters began jamming all out- going calls... They owed their safety to the accident of being telepathically linke d. Just as they were able to use one another’s minds as amplifiers for their PK powers, so they were able to draw upon one another’s strength in their night battle. Fleishman gathered that the parasites had also attempte d to ‘undermine’ them as they have undermined me, but, again, their telepathic li nk was their strength. I learne d later that they had not ‘faced’ the problem of non-identity, as I had. They had simply encouraged one another in refusing to consider it, in looking away from it. The undermining technique depends very much upon the victim being alone. * * * The next problem seemed almost insolubl e: how to get to Potsdam and collect the Grau brothers or, at least, how to get them to come to Diyarbakir immediately. The house was surrounded by reporters, and a dozen helicopters simply hovered overhead. When the ne ws of our presence spread, these increased to about a hundred. Any a ttempt to contact Potsdam would send reporters scurrying there, since local calls we re easier to tap than long distance ones. As far as we knew, the name of the Grau brothers had not yet been dragged into the story, so they probably st ill had some freedom of movement. It was Fleishman who saw the soluti on. After an hour with us, he was already feeling better; the progress of re-energizing his mind was far simpler than in the case of Reubke. The story of my victory had upon him the same effect as upon Reich—of restoring all the old optimism and purpose. And now Fleishman suddenly remarked: ‘We’ve l earned one interesti ng thing about the parasites! It’s wrong to think of them as existing in some kind of space. The crowd attacking me here must have been more or less the same crowd who were attacking you two in Diyarbakir—othe rwise the attacks wouldn’t all have stopped at the same moment.’ This had also struck myself and Re ich earlier. But Fleishman saw another consequence. ‘In that case, we’re mistak en to think about th e mind in terms of physical space. In the mental sense, al l the space in the universe is somehow"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" compressed to a point. They don’t have to travel to get from here to Diyarbakir. They’re already in both places at once.’ ‘And in Potsdam too,’ Reich said. All of us saw the consequences at once. If the parasites were, in a sense, in Potsdam at the moment, then so were we. Of course, it should have been obvious! Human beings exist in the physical world only in so far as they have no power to enter their own minds. A man who can withdraw into himself on a long tr ain journey has escaped time and space, while the man who stares out of the window and yawns with boredom has to live through every minute and every mile. Our power to fight the mind parasites lay in precisely that ability to descend in to ourselves and figh t them on their own ground. A man who swims on the surface is an easy prey for sharks, but a diver who swims under the surface with a mask and a spear is on terms of equality with the shark. Well, in so far as we c ould descend into our own minds, we were able to enter that same realm of spacelessness and timelessness as the parasites. The brothers could communicate with one another telepathic ally; why shouldn’t we be able to communicate with them? There was a simple answer: we had no idea of how to go about it. We knew that it must involve the same kind of f aculty as psychokinesis, but that told us nothing at all. So we turned off the lights and expe rimented, sitting around a table. To anyone entering the room, it would have l ooked as if we were holding a seance, sitting with bowed heads, our hands touching. I tried first. As soon as we had sat down, I sent a mental signal: ‘Are you ready?’ to them. There was no result. Then suddenly, with a shock of pleasure, I seemed to hear Reich’s voice inside my chest saying: ‘Are you ready?’ I sent back: ‘Yes, can you hear me?’ His vo ice came back: ‘Not very clearly.’ It took Fleishman some ten minutes before he could enter into our game. By that time, Reich and I were communica ting fairly clearly. This was obviously because, like the Grau brothers, we had gr own adjusted to one another. However, after some time, we were able to pi ck up Fleishman’s thought waves, sounding like a voice shouting in the distance. We now knew we could communicate with one another: but could we communicate with the Graus? A long and exhausting hour now went pa st, and I felt like someone lost on a mountain, shouting for help. I kept se nding out mental signals for Louis and Heinrich Grau, but these signals kept turning into mere words, as if I was shouting their names aloud. What was needed was to project the naked urge to contact them, without words. Suddenly, Reich said, ‘I think I’m getti ng something.’ We all concentrated hard, trying to send back a ‘Message received’ signal. A nd then, with an astounding clarity that made us all jump, a voice seemed to shout in our ears: ‘I am getting you. What do you want?’ We looked at one another in astonishment and triumph, then closed our eyes again and redoubled our concentration. The"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" loud, clear voice said: ‘Not all at once. One at a time. Reich, will you signal? You seem to be clearest.’ It was as if the clear one-way communication from Potsdam to Berlin cleared the line the other way. We c ould feel Reich’s mind pumping out messages like spurts of energy. ‘Can you get to Diyarbakir?’ He had to repeat the message a dozen times. Then, listeni ng to him we found ourselves making a certain effort in sympathy. To begin wit h, the Graus protested: ‘One at a time.’ Then, suddenly, it was as if we fell into step with Reich, using our own mental amplifiers simply to amplify his signal and send it on. Imme diately, the voice of the Graus said: ‘That’s better. I’m getti ng you clearly now.’ From then on there was no difficulty. We were even able to gi ve them a resume of our situation, just as if we were speaking on the telephone. During all this time, we were not in the room. We were totally self-absorbed, lik e men in prayer. And I suddenly realized that the reason for the bad amplificati on was that I was not deep enough in my own mind; I was too near the surface. Th e trouble was a simple one: if I sank too deep into my mind, I tended to fall asleep. Language and meaning belong to the realm of the body. It is as difficult to carry them into the dept hs of one’s mind as to carry logical thought into a dream. I mention this because it was at this moment that I first became clearly aw are of the immensity of our ignorance. Those deep areas of the mind are inhabi ted mainly by memories and dreams, which drift by like great fishes . It is tremendously difficu lt to preserve any sense of purpose at that depth, to distinguish reality from illusion. And yet for really efficient telepathy, one has to ‘send’ from this depth. However, on this occasion, it did not matter. Reich, Fleishman and I reinforced one another. It is only in an experience like this that one can recognize the full meaning of the phrase ‘we are members of one another’. When we had finished talking with the Graus, we all felt strangely happy and refreshed, as if waking from a deep and peaceful sleep. Fleishman looked his old self again. His wife, who brought us in some coffee, and was obviously trying to control her hos tility to Reich and myse lf, looked at him with amazement, and obviously revised her ideas about us. It was interesting, incidentally, to note that Fleishman’s obvious tenderness for her—she was thirty years his junior, and had only married him a year ago—communicated itself to Reich and myself, so that we looked at her with a proprietary fondness that combined lust and an intimate knowle dge of her body. She had simply dropped into our telepathic circle, and become, in a sense, the wife of all three of us. (I should also note that the lust experienced by Reich and myself was not the usual male desire to possess a strange fema le, for we had already, so to speak, possessed her, through Fleishman.) By three in the morning, the reporter s in helicopters had grown tired of waiting for us. Besides, their numbers were more than the city’s air safety regulations allowed. But the crowd outsi de the front door was undiminished, and the street was lined with automobiles c ontaining sleeping re porters. We went up to the attic, and placed a ladder against the skylight window. At three-twenty,"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" there was the sound of a helicopter above the house, and we quickly opened the window. With some manoeuvring, the rope ladder was dropped into the room; then Fleishman, myself and Reich clambere d up it as fast as we could, before the reporters below found out what was happeni ng. The Grau brothe rs pulled us to safety, and pulled up the ladder, then the helicopter set off at top speed for the airfield. The operation was perfect. The repor ters in the street were certain that we could have no way of summoning a heli copter, since they carried interception devices in their cars (strictly illegal, of course). So if any of them noticed the helicopter, they probably assumed it was a nother reporter, or pe rhaps a patrol of the Air Safety Council. At all events, we reached the airport with no sign of pursuit. The pilot had radioed ahead to the pilot of the rocket. By three-thirty- five, we were on our way to Paris. We had decided that ou r next business lay with Georges Ribot. * * * It was just after dawn when we landed at Le Bourget. We could have landed at the more convenient floating airport a bove the Champs-Elysees, but it would have involved radioing for permission, a nd this might have alerted reporters. Instead, we took a helicab into the centre of Paris from Le Bourget, and were there in twenty minutes. Now there were five of us, we were almost impregnable as far as casual recognition went. With our minds ‘in series’, we were able to form a kind of wall to divert the attention of anyone who happened to look at us. People could ‘see’ us, of course, but they could not look at us. The faculty of understanding or grasping follows that of perception (as you can see if you read something with your mind elsewhere). Most objects we look at are not pr operly registered, because they are not worth noticing. We me rely had to prevent the ‘attention’ of any onlooker from ‘closing’ on us—the same principle as jamming a stick in a dog’s mouth to prevent him from biting. We were virtually invisible as we walked through Paris. Our one hope lay in surprise. If the pa rasites were observing us, then they would make sure that we never got to Georges Ribot, for he could be warned hours before we arrived. On the other ha nd, they had sustained a considerable defeat the night before, and might well be off their guard. This is what we hoped. We only had to pick up a newspaper to discover where he was, for Ribot was now a celebrity on a scale he had never known before. An abandoned copy of Paris-Soir told us that Ribot wa s in the Curel Clinic on the Boulevard Haussman, suffering from some kind of nervous collapse. We knew how to interpret this. It was now necessary to use force, although we were st ill strongly opposed to the idea. The clin ic was too small for us to get in unnoticed. But the hour five in the morning ensured that there wo uld be few people around. A sleepy porter looked resentfully out of his office, and five minds clamped on him, seizing him"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" far more powerfully than our five pairs of hands could have done. He gaped at us, incapable of understanding what had happened. Fleishman asked him softly: ‘Do you know which room Ri bot is in?’ He nodded in a dazed manner—we had to relax our grip even to allow him to do that. ‘Take us to him,’ Fleishman said. The man pressed the automatic door opener, and led us in . A ward sister hurried forward saying: ‘Where do you think you’re going?’ A moment later, she was also smartly preceding us along the corridors. We asked her why there were no reporters. She replied: ‘M. Ribot is givi ng a press conference at nine.’ She had the presence of mind to add: ‘I th ink you might have waited until then.’ We met two night nurses, but they mu st have assumed our visit was in order. Ribot’s room was at the very t op of the building—a special private room. The doors to this section opened only by a special code. Luckily, the night porter knew it. Fleishman said quietly: ‘N ow, madame, we shall have to ask you to wait in this outer room, and not to try to escape. We shall do the patient no harm.’ This was by no means certain, of course ; it was said to soothe her. Reich drew the curtains back, an d the noise woke Ribot up. He was unshaven and looked very ill; when he saw us, he stared blankly for a moment, then said: ‘Ah, gentleme n. I thought you might call.’ I looked into his brain, and what I saw horrified me. It was like a town whose inhabitants have all been massacred and replaced by soldiers. There were no parasites present; they were unnecessary. Ribot had surrendered to the parasites in terror. They had entered his brain and taken over all the habit circuits. When these were all broken, he was virtually helpless, for every act now had to be performed with immense effort , through free-will. We do most of our living through the habit circ uits: breathing, eating, di gesting, read ing, responding to other people. In some cases—an actor , for example—the habit circuits are actually the result of a lifetime of effort. The greater the actor, the more he relies on habit circuits, so that only the supreme p eaks of his art are left to his free will. To destroy a man’s habit circuits before his eyes is crueller than murdering his wife and children. It is to strip him of everything, to make life as impossible for him as if you had stripped him of his skin. The parasites had done this, then quickly replaced the old habit circuits with new ones. Certain circuits were restored: breathing, speaking, mannerisms (for these were essential to convincing people that he was the same person, and in full possession of his senses). But certain habits were completely elimin ated—the habit of thinking deeply, for example. And a new series of responses had been installed. We were ‘the enemy’, and we aroused in him boundless hatr ed and disgust. He felt this of his own free will, in a sense; but if he had not chosen to feel it—half his circuits would have gone dead again. In other word s, having surrendered to the parasites, he remained a ‘free man’ in the sense that he was alive and could choose his actions. But it was consciousness on th eir terms—either that, or no consciousness at all. He was as complete ly a slave as a man with a gun pressed to his head."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" So, as we stood around his bed, we did not look at him as avengers. We felt pity and horror. It was like looking at a mutilated corpse. We did not speak. Four of us held him down by PK, of course, while Fleishman quickly examined the contents of his brain. It was impossible to tell whether he could be repaired, for it depended so much upon his own strength and courage. All that was certain was that he would have to exert enormous will- power—far more than he had succeeded in exerting against the parasites before he capitulated. It was no time for long deliberations. Our strength convinced him that he had as much to fear from us as from the parasites. Each one of us entered into the circuits of his brain that controlled his motor mechanisms, and learned their combination. (This is difficult to expl ain to non-telepaths; but communication with other brains depends upon learning a certain ‘combination’ which is their thought wave-length. After this, a degree of remote control is possible.) Fleishman spoke to him gently, telling him that we were still basically his friends, and that we realized the ‘brain washing’ was no fault of his. If he would trust us, we would free him from the parasites. Then we all left. The nurse and porter escorted us down. We thanked the porter, and tipped him in dollars (which were then world currency). In less than an hour, we were halfway back to Diyarbakir. Our mental contact with Ribot enable d us to discover what happened when we left. Neither the nurse nor the por ter could fully understand how we had forced them to take us to Ribot; they could not believe that it was not of their own free will. So there was no hue and cry. The nurse went back to Ribot and found him awake and apparently unh armed, and decided to say nothing. As we landed in Diyarbakir, Reich sa id: ‘Seven o’clock. Two hours before he gives his press conferen ce. Let’s hope they don’t...’ He was interrupted by a cry from Fleishman, who had agreed to k eep up telepathic contact with Ribot. He said: ‘They’ve found out... They ’re attacking in force.’ I asked: ‘What can we do?’ I tried to concentrate, to use my knowledge of Ribot’s brain, to re-establish contact, but there was no result. It wa s like turning on a radio set when you’ve forgotten to connect it to the mains. I asked Fleishman: ‘Are you still in touch?’ He shook his head. Each of us tried in turn. It was useless. An hour later, we discovered why. The television news announced that Ribot had committed suicide by leaping from his bedroom window. Was this a defeat or not? We could not tell. Ribot’s suicide prevented him from telling the truth at his press confer ence and withdrawing his ‘confession’. It also prevented him from doing us further damage. On the other hand, if our visit to the hospital was discovered, we would certainly be accused of killing him... As it happened, it was never discover ed. Probably the nurse continued to believe that we were just intrusive journalists. She had seen Ribot after we left and he was well. So she had said nothing."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" * * * At eleven o'clock that morning Reich and I summoned the press to the board room, which had been lent us for that purpose. Fleishman, Reich and the Graus waited on either side of the door, probing everyone who came in. Our caution was rewarded. One of the last men to come into the room was a huge bald- headed man, Kilbride of the Washington Examiner. Reich nodded to one of the company guards, who approached Kilbride and asked him if he would mind being searched. He immediately began to protest vehemently and noisily, shouting that it was an indignity. Then suddenly he broke loose and ran towards me, reaching for his inside pocket. I exerted all my mental force, and stopped him short. Three guards hurled themselv es on him and dragged him out. They found a Walther automatic pistol in his pocke t, with six shots in it and one in the barrel. Kilbride protested th at he always carried it for protection, but his action in trying to shoot me had been seen by everyone. (Later, we probed his brain and discovered that the parasites had invade d it while he was drunk the day before— he was well known as an alcoholic.) This diversion produced a strong atmo sphere of expectancy. There were about five hundred reporters present—a ll the room would hold. The rest watched outside on closed circuit television. Re ich, Fleishman and the Grau brothers joined me on the platform—their purpose was actually to scan the hall and make sure there were no more potential a ssassins—and I read aloud the following statement: ‘Our aim today is to warn the people of the earth about a greater menace than they have ever faced. This plan et is at present being watched by an enormous number of alien intelligences, whose aim is either to destroy the human race or to enslave it. ‘Some months ago, when we were conducting our first archaeological investigations into the Black Mountai n at Karatepe, Professor Reich and I became aware that we were in the presence of disturbing forces. We were aware, that is, of a power that actively resisted our efforts to uncover the secret of the mound. We assumed at the time that this pow er could be in the nature of some psychic field of force established th ere by long dead inhabitants for the protection of their tombs. Both Reich a nd myself had long been convinced that such things were possible, and explained, for example, the difficulties of the first excavators of the tomb of Tutankhamen. We were prepared to risk invoking this curse, if this was its nature, and continued our investigations. ‘But in recent weeks we have become convinced that we are facing something far more dangerous than a curse. It is our conviction that we have disturbed the sleep of forces that once dominated the earth, and who are determined to dominate it again. These forces are more dangerous than any yet known to the human race because they are in visible, and are capable of attacking"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" the human mind directly. They are able to destroy the sanity of any individual they attack, and to cause suicide. ‘They are also capable of enslaving cer tain individuals and of using them for their own purposes. ‘At the same time, it is our belief that the human race has no cause for panic. Their numbers are small compared to ours, and we have been forewarned. The struggle may be hard, but I think that there is every chance that we shall win. ‘I shall now try to summarize what we have succeeded in learning about these mind parasites...’ I spoke for about half an hour, and descri bed briefly most of the events that I have recorded here. I told the story of the destruction of our colleagues, and of how Ribot had been made to betray us. Then I explained how, once one became aware of the existence of these parasites, it was possible to destroy them. I went to great trouble to emphasize that these forces were not yet active; they were blind and instinctive. It was important to prevent panic. Most of the human race could do nothing whatever about these parasi tes, and it was best that they should feel fairly confident of ultimate victory. I spent the last quarter of an hour of my talk emphasizing the bright side of things; how, now that man was forewarned, the destruction of the parasites could be only a matter of time. We concluded the meeting by inviting questions; but most of the reporters were so anxious to get to the nearest telescreen that the question period was short. Two hours later, the news was on th e front page of every newspaper in the world. * * * To tell the truth, all this bored me. The five of us were ex plorers preparing to investigate an exciting new world, and it was tiresome to have to waste time on reporters. But we had decided that this was the best way of ensuring our own safety. If we died now, it would alert the whole world. As it was, the best plan of the parasites would be to try to discredit us by allowing everything to proceed normally for a month or so—perhaps even a year or so—until everyone decided it had all been a hoax. By making our announcement now, we had bought time— this, at any rate, was the idea. It would ta ke us a long while to realize that the parasites could outmanoeuvre us on almost every point. The reason for this should be obvious. We didn’t want to waste time on the parasites. Imagine a bibliophile who ha s just received a pa rcel containing a book he has wanted all his life, and imagine that, before he ha s opened it, he is interrupted by a bore who insists on talk ing for hours... The parasites may have been the greatest menace ever faced by th e human race, but to us, they were the dreariest of bores. Human beings get so used to their mental limitations, just as the men of three centuries ago got used to the enormous inconvenience of travelling. How"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" would Mozart have felt if, after some exhausting journey lasting a week, someone had told him that the men of th e twenty-first century would do it in a quarter of an hour? Well, we were like Mozarts who had been swept forward into the twenty-first century. Those mental journeys which we had once found so exhausting and painful could now be made in a matter of minutes. At last we understood clearly Teilhard de Chardin’s remark that man stands on the brink of a new phase in his evolution. For we ar e now in that new phase. The mind was like virgin country, like the promised land of the Israelites. All we had to do was to occupy it... and, of course, expel its pres ent inhabitants. So in spite of these anxieties and problems, our mood duri ng these days was one of ecstatic happiness. As we saw it, we now had two major tasks. The first was to find new ‘pupils’, others to help us in this fight. The second was to explore the possibility that we could turn this into an offensiv e battle. At present, we could not reach those lower regions of the mind inhabited by the parasites. Yet my night battle with them had taught me that I could call upon a power that came from some very deep source. Could we get close enough to that source to carry the battle into the enemy’s camp? I paid only perfunctory attention to th e reactions of the world press. Not surprisingly, most of them were hostile and sceptical. The World Free Press of Vienna said openly that the five of us should be placed under house arrest until the whole question of the suicides c ould be investigat ed. The London Daily Express, on the other hand, suggested that we should be placed in charge of a United Nations War Department, with full powers to combat the parasites by any means we considered effective. One item disturbed us all. It was an ar ticle in the Berliner Tagblatt by Felix Hazard. He did not, as we had expected, ridicule the whole business and support Ribot’s ‘confession’. He seemed to take it for granted that the world was in danger from this new enemy. But if this enemy was capable of ‘taking over’ individual minds, said Hazard, what guarant ee was there that we were not slaves of these parasites? We had made this announcement about their existence, but that proved nothing. We had to make the announcement out of self-preservation; after Ribot’s statement, we were lik ely to find ourselves facing criminal proceedings... The tone of this article wa s not entirely serious. Hazard seemed to leave open the possibility that he was ridiculing the whole thing with mild satire. Still, the effect was disturbing. There could be no possible doubt in our minds that Hazard was an agent of the enemy. There was one more matter that needed immediate consideration. So far, reporters had not been allowed into the site at the Black Mountain. But they would obviously have no difficulty in sp eaking to various workmen and soldiers from the site. This, if possible, had to be forestalled. So Reich and I proposed to escort a selected group of reporters to the site that evening, and we agreed to the presence of television cameras. We gave instructions that the strictest security precautions were to be observed before we arrived; no reporters were to be allowed near the site."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" At ten o’clock that evening, fifty re porters were waiting for us in two transport helicopters. The journey to Ka ratepe took an hour in these cumbrous machines. When we arrived, the whole site had been floodlit. Portable television cameras had been set up ten minutes before we landed. Our plan seemed foolproof. We would escort the group of reporters down as far as the Abhoth block, which was now fully exposed, and we would use our PK powers to create an atmosphere of oppression and tension. Then we would deliberately pick on the most nervous and susceptible members of the group, and try to induce total panic in them. This, of course, was our reason for failing to mention our PK powers in the earlier interv iew. We realized that they could, in fact, be used for ‘fra ming’ the parasites. We reckoned without the parasites. Ju st before landing, I noticed that the reporters in the other he licopter appeared to be singing. This seemed odd. We presumed that they had been drinking heavily. The Graus, Fleishman, Reich and myself were in the other helicopter. Th en, as soon as we landed, we sensed the presence of parasites, an d understood what was happe ning. They were reversing their usual method. Instead of sucking energy from their victims, they were giving energy. Many of these men were heavy drinkers and, like most reporters, not particularly intelligent. Because of th eir habit patterns, this ‘gift’ of mental energy had upon them much the same effect as drink. As soon as the reporters from our helicopter joined the others, they were infected by the same party spirit. I heard the television commentator sayi ng: ‘Well, these boys certainly don’t seem worried about the parasi tes, they seem to be tr eating the whole thing as a joke.’ I told the producer of the programme that there would be some delay, and beckoned the others over to a foreman’s hut in the far side of the digging. We locked the door, and concentrated on finding out what could be done. The link between us was easily establis hed, and we were able to enter the brains of some of the reporters. At first, it was difficult to discover what was happening; we had never come across anything like this before. Then, luckily, we came upon a reporter whose wave-length was identical with that of Ribot. This enabled us to conduct a closer exploration into his cer ebral processes. The brain has about a dozen major pleasure circuits, the most familiar being the sexual, the emotional and the social. There is also an inte llectual pleasure circuit, and a higher- intellectual circuit, connected with man’s powers of self-control and self- conquest. Finally, there are five circuits that are almost entirely undeveloped in human beings, connected with the energi es that we call poetical, religious or mystical. The parasites were boosting the energy of the social and emotional circuits in most of these men. The fact th at there were fifty of them did the rest: the ‘crowd’ mechanism am plified their pleasure. All five of us concentrated on the reporter we were examining. We had no difficulty in breaking the circuit a nd reducing him to a sudden state of depression. But as soon as we withdrew the pressure, he recovered. We tried a direct attack on the paras ites. It was hopeless, they were beyond our reach, and"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" determined to stay beyond it. We had a feeling that the energy we directed against them was completely wasted, and that they were mocking us. It was a dangerous situation. We decided that we woul d have to rely entirely on PK powers to keep the situat ion in hand. This meant working in close proximity to the reporters. Someone banged on the door of our hut and shouted: ‘Hey, how much longer you gonna keep us waiting?’ So we went out, and said we were now ready. * * * I went ahead with Reich. The reporter s followed us, laughing cheerfully, and the voice of the television commentator went on continually in the background. Walking at the back of the crowd, Fleish man and the Grau brothers concentrated on this television commentary. We heard the man say in a worried voice: ‘Well, everybody seems very light-hearted, but I can’t help wondering if it’s genuine. There’s a strange kind of tens ion here tonight...’ At th is, the reporters all began to laugh. And now the five of us linked our wills in series, an d exerted a pressure of insecurity and vague fear. Immedi ately, the laughter stopped. I said aloud: ‘Don’t worry. The air at this depth isn’t as pure as it might be. But it’s not poisonous.’ The tunnel was seven feet high, and sl oped at an angle of about twenty degrees. A hundred yards down, we were all able to climb into a number of small railway wagons. During the ten mile j ourney, nothing was audible above the rattle of the wheels. There was no need to exert any pressure to lower their spirits as we went downwards. The tunnel was roughly corkscrew-shaped—the alternative would have been to place its entrance several miles from the Black Mountain, and set up another site, whic h would have doubl ed our security problem. Every time the trucks lurched around a bend, we felt the wave of alarm that rose from them. They were also afraid that the vibrations of the trucks might collapse part of the tunnel. It took nearly half an hour to get down to the Abhoth block. This in itself was an impressive enough sight; its immense, grey-black sides towered above us like a cliff. Now we deliberately created an atmos phere of oppression. It would have been far better if we could have allowe d their imaginations to work, and merely stimulated them with a touch of fear. But the parasites were pouring energy into them, and it was necessary for us to paraly se the parts of thei r brains that would respond. So we exerted a dead weight of fear and distaste. The television commentator was obviously embarrassed to go on talking in the oppressive silence; he was speaking into his microphone in a whisper: ‘There’s an unpleasant, suffocating feeling down here. It could be the air.’ * * * "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" Then the parasites began to attack. Not in force, this time, but in ones and twos. Their purpose was obviously to harass us, to make us lose our grip. As soon as we turned our attention to fighting them, the atmosphere lightened; everybody became more cheerful. It was a frustrati ng experience, for there was little that could be done. In small numbers, they were almost invulnerable. It was like fighting shadows. The best thing was to i gnore them, but this was as difficult as to ignore a mongrel dog snapping at your ankles. And then the idea came to all of us simultaneously: at least, we were so linked that it is impossible to say who thought of it first. We looked at the Abhoth block, and at the ceiling that was so me thirty feet above it. It weighed three thousand tons. The Grau brothers ha d lifted a thirty ton block in the British Museum. We decided that it was worth trying. So after deliberately sending a wave of fear over the reporters, we began to exert our wills in unison, to lift the block. It seemed hopeless, as hopeless as trying to lift it with our bare hands. Then the Grau brothers gave us the clue. Instead of exerting the effort in unison, they exerted it alternately, at first sl owly, then with increasing speed. We understood what they were doing, and joined in. The moment we had grasped the trick, it became absurdly easy. The power th at five of us generated in this way was immense, enough to have lifted the tw o miles of earth above us. The block suddenly floated clear of the ground, and moved up to the ceiling. The lights flickered as it brushed a power cable. Th ere was an immediate panic, and some of the idiots ran under the block, or we re pushed under. We moved it sideways, and immediately plunged the place into darkness as the block ripped the power cable. The end of the cable trailed on the ground, and we heard a man give a throaty scream as he stumbled on it. The smell of charred flesh filled the chamber and made us all feel sick. * * * It was important not to pani c. One of us had to dise ngage his will and push the reporters to the edge of the chamber, so the block could be lowered without delay. This was difficult, since our wills were ‘locked’ together upholding the block. We were, so to speak, in parallel in stead of in series, sustaining the block with a five-fold alternation. This was the moment the parasites chos e to attack in force; they had us helpless, of course. The situation would have been funny if it had not been so dangerous, and if it had not already cost a life. It was Reich who said: ‘Could we atomize it?’ For a moment, in the confusion, we failed to understand him—th e parasites were su rrounding us like an army of shadows. Then, as we saw what he meant, we knew it was the only hope. The power we were exerting was enough to lift a thousand blocks of this size: would it be enough to destroy th is one? We tried it gripping the block mentally and exerting a crushing pressu re on it. We increased the rate of alternations automatically, and the exhila ration was so great that we scarcely"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" noticed the pressure of the parasites ar ound us. Then we felt it grind and crumble like an enormous piece of chalk held in a vice. In a few seconds, it was a great block of fine powder we were holding in the air. In this form, it could be forced into the tunnel. This we did, at such a pace that the draught sucked us back towards the tunnel, and the air filled for a while with dust. The moment the block was out of th e way, we used the accumulated will- power to lash out at the pa rasites, with the impatience of a man striking at a flea. The result was satisfying; again, they ha d no time to retreat, and we had the sensation of cutting into them like a flam e-thrower into dead leaves. Then Reich disengaged his will and pick ed up the end of the power cable, which he fused to the broken end. The lights came on, a nd showed us utter confusion. * * * The ‘social circuit’ had been snapped in all of them; each man felt himself totally alone, and terrified. The air was full of black dust that made us all choke. (We had to allow it to settle in the tunnel before we could dr ive it upwards, in order to allow clean air to flow in above it.) The remains of the dead man were stuck to the power cable above us, and still produced a charring smell. We were all black in the face, like coal miners. The atmos phere of panic was terrifying. Each one of them believed that he would never see the surface again. We were able to still the panic by ag ain linking in series. Then we ordered them to form into a double line, and retu rn to the trucks. Reich concentrated on the three television men, making sure that they started their cameras again. (The power cut had affected them, of course.) Meanwhile, the rest of us cleared the dust out of the tunnel, and se nt it slowly up to the surface, where it rose into the sky—luckily it was a dark night—and was allowed to settle over a wide area. When we came out into the air, we knew that we had won a considerable victory over the parasites mainly by accide nt. They had not given up, of course. They were still pouring energy into the repor ters as we came to the surface. We were able to block this completely. But obviously we would be unable to do so when they separated. Still, the whole wo rld had seen what had happened over the television cameras, and had seen the disappearance of the block. Whatever the reporters wrote hardly mattered. Besides, there was another factor. This artificial boosting of their social and emotional circuits would inevitably produce a reaction of fatigue, a kind of hangover. They could not be kept in this state of semi-intoxication forever. The reaction should serve us well. It was after midnight when the five of us ate a meal together. It was in a special room that A.I.U. had provided fo r us. We had decided that, from now on, the five of us had to stay together, by day and night. Singl y, we had a certain strength, but together, this strength was multiplied by a thousand, as we had demonstrated that evening."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" We did not deceive ourselves into belie ving that we were invulnerable. We were, perhaps, safe from direct attack fr om the parasites. Bu t they knew how to use other men against us, and this was the real danger. When we saw the newspapers the ne xt morning, it was difficult not to congratulate ourselves on a major victor y. Since almost everyone in the world had been watching their television scr eens, it was as if everyone had been present when the Abhoth block vanishe d. We thought that a few of the news- papers would suspect fraud—after all, what we had done was no more than a glorified conjuring trick—but no one did. Th ere were plenty of hysterical attacks on us, but they were attacks on our stupidity in releasing these ‘terrifying forces’, everyone assumed that the ‘Tsathogguans ’—it was a Lovecraft expert in the States who was responsible for the name —had destroyed the block to prevent us from learning more of their secrets. What terrified everyone was that if they could destroy a three thousand ton block, th ey could destroy a modern city just as easily. This fear was increased later in the day when scientists detected the layer of basalt dust covering the scr ub for miles around the site, and deduced correctly that the block had been somehow disintegrated. They were baffled. It would, of course, have been possible to disintegrate the bloc k using an atomic blaster, but the resultant release of energy would have destroyed everyone in the underground chamber; they could not understand how it had been done without even raising the temperature of the chamber. Gunnar Fangen, the president of the United Nations, sent us a message asking what steps we thought he should take against the parasites. Did we think it would help if Kadath was destroyed by atomic mines? Had we any idea of what weapons might be effective agains t them? We sent him a message asking him to come and see us, which he did forty-eight hours later. Meanwhile, A.I.U. was facing a problem of its own. The publicity, of course, was highly gratifyi ng; but while hundreds of re porters waited outside, they were in a state of siege, and busine ss came to a standstill. It was important that we find ourselves a new headquarters. For this reason, I spoke directly to the President of the United States, Lloyd C. Melville, asking him if he could find us a high security area where we would be guaranteed privacy. He acted quickly, and within an hour notified us that we could move to the U.S. Rocket Base 91, at Saratoga Springs, New York State. We moved there the following day, October 17th. Our new base had many advantages. We still had a list of a dozen men in America whom we had intended to ‘initiate ’ into our secret in due course; their names had been supplied by Remizov and Spencefield of Yale. Five of them were in New York State. We asked Presid ent Melville if he would ask these men to meet us on our arrival at Base 91. The men were Oliver Fleming and Merril Philips of the Psychological Laboratory of Columbia, Russell Holcroft of Syracuse University, and Edward Leaf a nd Viktor Ebner of the Albany Research Institute."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" The evening before we left A.I. U., Fleishman made a television appearance, recorded at A.I.U., in whic h he again emphasized that earth had no cause for panic. He did not believe that the parasites were strong enough to do any real damage to the human race. It wa s our business to try to make sure they never became strong enough. For us, this ‘public’ side of our work was the least important; in fact, it was a tiresome irrelevancy. We wanted to ge t down to the real business of exploring our own strength and that of the parasites. A.I.U. organized a fast rocket to take us to Base 91, and we were there within an hour. Our arrival was announced on television the same afternoon. The President made a personal appearance to explain his reasons for allowing us into Base 91 (which was the United States’ maximum security area—a joke said it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than to get into Base 91). He said that our safety was a ma tter of world importance, and that any attempt by reporters to contact us woul d be treated as a breach of security regulations, and dealt with as such. Th is certainly solved one of our major problems; from that time onward, we c ould move about without being followed by a dozen helicopters. Base 91 was hardly comfortable compar ed with the directors’ block at A.I.U. Our quarters consisted of a Nissen hut that had been constructed in the twenty-four hours before our arrival; it was little more than a well-furnished barrack room. The five men were waiting to meet us when we arrived—Fleming, Philips, Holcroft, Leaf and Ebner. All were unde r forty. Holcroft hardly looked like a scientist, being over six feet tall with pi nk cheeks and very blue eyes: I felt some misgivings on seeing him. The others struck me as first-rate men: intelligent, self-controlled, and with a sens e of humour. We all had t ea with the O.I.C. of the base and the chief security officer. Bo th these men seemed to me typical soldiers; intelligent enough, but somehow literal-minded. (The security officer wanted to know what measures he c ould take against Tsathogguan spies.) I decided to try to make them understand pr ecisely what we were up against; not an enemy who attacked you from in fr ont or behind, but one who was already inside us all. They looked baffled until General Winslow, the O.I.C., said: ‘I suppose you mean you could compare these cr eatures to germs that get into the bloodstream?’ I said that i ndeed you could, and from then on I had a feeling that they were altogether happi er about the idea, although the security officer was now thinking in terms of disinfectant. After tea, we took the five new ‘recru its’ back to the hut. I read in the security officer’s mind that there were a number of vibration microphones concealed under the concrete floor of our hut placed there on his own orders. So as soon as we moved in, I located them and destroyed them. They were, of course, set in the concre te itself—an inch deep, so it should have been theoretically impossible to destroy them without drilling into the concrete."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" Whenever I saw the security officer over the next week, I caught him looking at me in an odd way. We spent the evening explaining the situa tion to our five ‘re cruits’. First of all, they were given photostatted copies of the Historical Re flections to read. Then I told them briefly my own story. Wh ile I did so, it was tape recorded, so that it could be played back la ter if they still had questions. I quote here from the last five minutes of that tape recording, since it states clearly the nature of the problems we faced: ‘So we suspect that these things can be combated by a human being with a basic training in phenomenology. We also know that their chief power seems to lie in their ability to unbalance the mind. (I had al ready confessed that the destruction of the Abhoth block was our doing.) This means that we have to learn how to resist them at every mental level. ‘But this in itself raises a new proble m, which we must solve as quickly as possible. We know so little about the hu man soul. We do not know what happens when a man is born and when he dies . We do not understand man’s relation to space and time. ‘The great vision of the nineteenth century romantics was of “men like gods”. We now know that this is w ithin the bounds of possibility. Man’s potential powers are so immense that we cannot begin to grasp them. To be god- like means to be in control of things in stead of being a victim of circumstance. But it must be emphasized that there can be no ultimate control while there are great unanswered questions. If a man walks with his face turned to the sky, it is easy to trip him up. While we do not unde rstand the foundations of our being, these parasites could be planning to atta ck these foundations and destroy us. For all I know, these parasites ar e as ignorant as we are about these questions. But we cannot risk making that assumption. We have got to know the secrets of death and of space and time. This is our only guarantee of winning this fight.’ To my surprise—and great pleasure—Holcroft turned out to be one of the best pupils I’d ever had. That look of babyish innocence was, in a way, a true guide to his nature. He had been brought up in the country by two maiden aunts who adored him, and had done well in science at school. He was naturally generous and sunny and un-neurotic, so this fortunate background allowed him to preserve these qualities. As an experi mental psychologist, he was not brilliant: he lacked the kind of nervous drive that ma kes a first-rate scientist. But what was far more important is that he had a natural, instinctive adjustment to nature. He had a kind of spiritual radar that meant th at he made fairly light work of the business of living. So in a way, he already knew everything I told him. It instantly made sense to him. The others understood it intellect ually, and digested it slowly, like a python digesting a rat, in a state of inte llectual excitement. Holcroft knew it all instinctively. Now this was far more important than it sounds. For Reich and Fleishman and myself and the Graus were also inte llectuals. We could not get out of the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" habit of trying to use the intellect to explore the wo rld of the mind, and this tended to waste time—like an army comma nded by a general who refuses to act without making out documents in triplic ate and consulting headquarters about everything. Holcroft was a mind of ‘med ium’; not a spirit medium, although this is closely related. His sphere was not the ‘spirit’ but the instincts. On that first evening, we were able to ‘key him in’ to our telepathic circle; his inner ear was naturally attuned to us. And a new hope sprang up among the five of us. Could this man dive deeper into the mind than we could? Could he give us some idea of what the parasites were up to? For the next two or three days, we spent most of the time in our hut, teaching our new pupils all we knew. Our telepathic powers made this easy. But we also came to recognize that we had overlooked one of the most important problems of phenomenology. When you teach a man that he has been completely mistaken about his own nature all his li fe, it is as unsettlin g as suddenly giving him a million pounds. Or it is like taking a sexually frustrated man, and giving him the run of a harem. He suddenly di scovers that he can turn on moods of poetry like a tap, that he can heat up his emotions to a kind of incandescence. He realizes, with a shock, that he has been handed the key to greatness: that all the world’s so-called ‘great men’ were me n who had a mere glimmering of these powers which he now possesse s in abundance. But he ha s spent all his life taking a relatively modest view of himself. Hi s old personality has achieved a certain density through thirty or forty years of hab it. It refuses to wither away overnight. But the new personality is also exceptionally powerful. He becomes a battle ground of two personalities, and he wastes an enormous amount of energy in all this confusion. Holcroft, as I have said, was an excellent pupil; but the other four had far more strongly developed personalities, a nd they had no real feeling of danger or urgency: after all, the rest of us had survived an attack from the parasites, so why shouldn’t they? I am not blaming these four men. It wa s almost inevitable. Every university faces a version of this same problem: students who find their new life so fascinating that they don’t want to waste it in hard work. It cost the five of us a considerab le mental effort to prevent Fleming, Philips, Leaf and Ebner from throwing all discipline to the winds. We had to watch them constantly. These new ideas were a powerful int oxicant; their minds were so stimulated that they wanted to splash around like happy schoolboys in a river. While they should have been r eading Husserl or Merleau Ponty, they would start to remember scenes of chil dhood or past love a ffairs. Ebner was a music lover who knew all the operas of Wa gner by heart, and as soon as he was left to himself, he wo uld begin to hum some theme from the Ring, and immediately sink into a passive ecstasy. Philips was something of a Don Juan, and would recall past conquests until th e atmosphere vibrat ed with a sexual excitement that the rest of us found di stracting. In defence of Philips, I should say that his sexual adventures had always been a search for something he never"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" found; now he had suddenly found it, and he couldn’t stop himself from holding constant post mortems on the past. On the third day after our arrival at Base 91, Holcroft came over to talk to me. He said: ‘I’ve got a feeling that we’re making fools of ourselves.’ I asked with foreboding what he mean t. ‘I don’t quite know. But when I practise trying to pick up th eir wavelength’ (he meant the parasites) ‘I get a feeling of great activity. They’re up to something.’ It was maddeningly frustrating. We possessed the great secret; we had warned the world. And yet, in a fundamenta l sense, we were as ignorant as ever. Who were these creatures? Where did they come from? What was their ultimate aim? Were they really intel ligent, or were they as uni ntelligent as the maggots in a piece of cheese? We asked ourselves these questions often enough, and had arrived at a few tentative answers. Human intelligence is a function of man’s evolutionary urge; the scientist and the philosopher hunger for truth because they are tired of being merely human. Now, was it possible that th ese creatures were intelligent in the same way? Since they were our enemies, it is hard to believe. But history has taught us that intelligence is no guarantee of benevolence. At all events, if they were intelligent, perhaps we might propose a truce? Again, if they were intelligent, perhaps they might r ealize that they were beaten. But were they beaten? As soon as Holcroft had spoken to me about his suspicions, I called the others together. It was after breakfast, on a clear, bright morning, with plenty of warmth in the air. A few hundred yards away, a group of airmen in white gym tunics were drilling, and we could hear the shout of the sergeant’s voice. I explained my fears, and said that I thought we would have to make an attempt to learn something more about th e parasites. We asked our four ‘pupils’ to make an effort to establish a telepa thic link with us. This was going to be a dangerous operation, and we needed all th e support we could get. After half an hour of practice, Leaf suddenly announced that he was getting us clearly. The others had exhausted themselves in the effort to reach us, so we told them to forget it, and relax. We did not say what was in our minds : that in the event of an attack from the parasites, they would be in the greatest danger, since they had had so little practice in using their mental powers. We drew the blinds, locked the doors, and all sat and concentrated hard. I had become so used to this operation that I did it almost automatically. The first step was identical with the one I take when I wish to fall asleep; complete dismissal of the outside world, forgetfu lness of my body. Within seconds, I was plunging downwards into the darkness of my own mind. The next step took some practice. I had to detach myself from my ordinary physical personality. The intelligent part of me had to remain wide awake, and m ove down into this world of dreams and memories. This ope ration is, in a way, similar to what happens if you are having a nightmare, and you tell yourself: ‘This is only a dream; I am asleep in my bed; I must wake up.’ Your daylight se lf is present, but"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" it is bewildered in its wo rld of phantasmagoria. I soon found that I could descend through the layer of dreams retaining full consciousness—a difficult trick, since human beings use the body as a kind of refl ector of consciousness. It is a strange, silent world, the dream layer of the mi nd, one feels literally like swimming under the sea. For a beginner, this could be th e most dangerous part of the experience. The body acts as an anchor on the mind. In one of his poems, Yeats thanks God that he ‘has body and its stupidity’ to rescue him from his nightmares. The body acts as a great weight on our thoughts, a nd prevents them from floating all over the place. It is rather like being on the moon, and only weighing a few pounds. If you take an ordinary st ep, you go flying through th e air like a balloon. Thoughts also gain this demonic energy when freed of the body’s gravity. If the thinker happens to be a morbid sort of person, his thoughts immediately become terrifying devils. And unless he happens to know that th ese are his thoughts, and that they have no existence apart from hi m, he may become panic-stricken and make everything ten times worse. It is like a man in an aeroplane going into a steep dive, and failing to realize that he is unconsciously pushing the joystick forward. As I bumped gently downwards thr ough my dreams and memories, I took care to remain passive, to ignore them. If I made the mistake of concentrating on any one of them, it would instantly expa nd and become a universe of its own. For example, I encountered the smell of a pipe tobacco called Ginger Tom that my grandfather used to smoke. It had b een so long since I had remembered it that I paused and allowed my interest to be drawn towards it. Immediately, I became aware of my grandfather, and of the back garden of his Lincolnshire cottage. In fact, I was in the back garden, and it was re-created in a minute detail that, under different circumstances, would have convinced me of its reality. I made a determined effort to dismiss it, and in a moment was again sinking down into the warm darkness. This darkness is full of life, and it is not simply a reflection of the life of the body. It is the life that swarms like electricity throughout the universe. So the lower regions of the mind have been refe rred to as the ‘nursery’. There is an intensely alive feeling of warmth and innocence; it is a world of children without bodies. Below the ‘nursery’, there is an emp tiness that is like the emptiness of interstellar space, a sort of nothingness. This is a particularly terrifying region where it is easy to lose your bearings. In all my early experiments, I always fell asleep in this region and woke up many hours later. There is nothing to reflect back one’s feeling of indi viduality, or even of existence, so that a single moment’s inattention loses th e thread of consciousness. This was as far as I could go. Even then, I had to allow myself to rise periodically to the nu rsery region, to concentrate my attention. During all this time, our brains remained in telepathic contact. This is not to say that all seven of us were swimming side by side, so to speak. Each was alone; it was the brains that maintained contact. All this meant was that we were"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" able to help one another by a kind of remote control. If I had fallen asleep when I paused in my grandmother’s garden, the others could have wakened me. If one of us was attacked, we would all ‘wake up’ instantly and unite to repulse the attack. But at that depth, you were on your own. It was now that my remote contact with Holcroft told me that he was still descending. I was filled with admiration. I had become absolutely weightless at that depth. My consciousness was like a bubble that want ed to rise. I knew there was some ‘knack’ of getting deeper, but acquiring a knack takes a certain amount of exploration, of practice, and if it is all you can do to remain conscious, this is impossible. Holcroft obviously had the knack already. There is almost no sense of time in these regions of the mind—it passes and yet it does not pass, if this makes any sense. Since there is no body to get impatient, there is something neutral abou t its passage. I coul d tell that there were no parasites anywhere near me, so I simply waited, keeping my attention alert. Soon I gathered that Holcroft was returning. I floated ge ntly back upwards, through the dreams and memories, and came back to physical consciousness about an hour after the e xperiment had begun. Holcroft was still unconscious. It was about ten minutes before he opened hi s eyes. The colour had left his cheeks, but he was breathing quietly. He looked at us calmly, and we saw that he had nothing much to tell us. He said: ‘I can’t understand it. There’s almost nothing going on dow n there. I could almost believe they’d all cleared out.’ ‘Didn’t you see any?’ ‘No. I had a feeling once or twice that there were some around, but very few.’ We all recorded the same experience. It looked hopeful. But none of us felt very happy. At midday, for the first time in three days, we turned on the television news. And then we found out what the pa rasites had been doing for the past three days. We learned of Obafeme Gwambe’s mu rder of President Nkumbula of the United States of Africa, and the coup d’et at that had made him master of Cape Town and Aden. Then there was an extr act from the speech Gwambe made over the radio after the coup. We looked at one another. The voice was oddly expressionless, as if he was repeating something learned by rote, and was too tired to do it justice. ‘For too many years now the black ma n has looked on himself as the white man’s inferior. This has got to stop. The black man knows that he is superior to the white man in every way. He is physic ally stronger, he is more sexually potent, he can do longer hours of brain work without getting tired. The twenty- first century will be the century of the black man ...’ And so on. It was all extremely infla mmatory stuff, and Gwambe spoke it with a certain convi ction. Yet it was somehow t oo well controlled to sound"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" absolutely convincing, as if Gwambe were an actor who had recorded his speech after a dozen attempts. The speech ended with a reference to us: ‘The white men have thought up a new way of swindling the blacks. They have invented a lot of bogies called the Sagothuans [Gwambe mispronounced it] who are supposed to be invading the earth. Well, has anybody seen any of these bogies yet? No, because they don’t exist. It’s another tr ick of the whites to keep the black man’s mind off his grievances.’ Gwambe went on to list the ‘rights’ of the negro population of earth. Each country with a large negro population was to hand over a part of its territory to its negro citizens, and allow them an independent government. America was to hand over the states of Texas and Calif ornia. England was to hand over its southern counties, including London. The ne groes of Europe were to be given a country of their own—either Italy, Poland or Austria. These details, of course, bothered no one; they were obviously bl uff. What did bother us was that Gwambe was obviously under the control of the mind parasites. And we now knew enough of the parasites to know that underrating them was the most dangerous of mistakes. We understood their policy immediately; it was, after all, the policy they had pursued with such success for two centuries now: keeping mankind distracted with war. For two centuries, mankind had laboured to change its state of consciousness for something more in tense. For two centuries, the parasites had given them other things to think about. * * * We sat and talked late into the night. This new development obviously called for immediate action—but what action? We a ll had a strange sense of foreboding. At three in the morning we went to bed. At five, Holcroft woke us, and said: ‘They’re planning something—I can feel it. I think we’d better get out of this place.’ ‘Where to?’ It was Reich who answered the questi on: ‘To Washington. I think we’d all better go and talk to the president.’ ‘What good would that do?’ Reich said: ‘I don’t know. But I have a feeling that we’re wasting time while we’re sitting here.’ There was no point in delaying. Although there was still an hour to dawn, we went to the helicopter that the Un ited States government had placed at our service. By daylight, we saw the long, straight avenues of Washington below us. We brought it down gently in the street outside the White House. The soldier on duty at the gate came running over, hi s atom gun raised. He was a young man, and it was not difficult to convince him that he had better fetch his superior officer, while we moved the helicopter on to the White House lawn. This was"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" one of the pleasantest advantages of our powers: the ordinary obstacles of officialdom vanished. We gave the officer a message for the president, and then went for a walk to find coffee. To casual passers-by, th e eleven of us probably looked like a business delegation. We found a big, glass-plated restaurant, and occupied two tables overlooking the street. As we sat there, I looked into Ebner’s mind. He felt my probing, and smiled at me. He said: ‘It’s funny. I ought to be thinking a bout the danger that confronts the human race, and the city of my birth—I was born in Washington. Instead of that, I feel a kind of contempt for these pe ople wandering by in the street. They’re all asleep. It doesn’t really seem to matter much what happens to them...’ Reich said, smiling: ‘Don’t forget yo u were one of them a week ago.’ I telephoned the White House, and discove red that we had been invited to breakfast with the president at nine o’clock. As we walked back through the morning crowds on their way to work, we suddenly felt a faint tremor in the pavements. We looked at one another, and Ebner said: ‘Earthquake?’ Reich said: ‘No. An explosion.’ We quickened our step, and arrived back at the White House at 8:45. I asked the officer who came to meet us if he’d heard any news of an explosion. He shook his head. ‘What explosion?’ We found out twenty minutes later, just after we had sat down to breakfast. The president was called out. When he came back, his face was bloodless, and his voice was trembling. He said: ‘Gen tlemen, Base 91 was destroyed by an explosion half an hour ago.’ None of us spoke, but the same thou ght came to all of us: How long would it be before the parasites caught up with us? * * * Both Reich and Holcroft have written detailed accounts of th at interview with the president, so I shall confine myself to a brief outline of what happened. We saw that he was on the poin t of collapse, and calmed him by the methods we had now used so often. Melville was not a st rong-minded man. He was an excellent peace-time president, with a fine grasp of administration, but not the man to cope with a world crisis. We discovered that he had been so shaken by the news that he had forgotten to ring army headqua rters to order Amer ica’s full defence system to come into action. He was soon persuaded to remedy this, and we were glad to learn that the new high speed particle radar c ould guarantee the interception of an atomic missile travelling at a mile a second. Melville was inclined to cling to the hope that the explosion at Base 91 was due to some kind of accident, perhaps to the Mars rocket that was being constructed there. (Its energy units p acked enough power to destroy half New York State.) We told him brutally that there was no chance of this. The explosion was the work of the parasites, and they had almost certainly used Gwambe as"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" their instrument. He said that, in th at case, America was committed to a full- scale atomic war with Africa. We pointed out that this was not necessarily so. The explosion was aimed at killing us. It had been a throw of the dice that had failed because of chance and Holcroft’s intuition of danger. Gwambe would not have another chance to us e this method. So in the meantime, Melville could pretend to believe that the explosion was due to the Mars rocket. But one thing was obviously of immense importance: that we should get together the largest possible number of intelligent men, capable of grasping the problem of the mind parasites, and of training them into a kind of army. If we could get enough men capable of psychokinesis, we might be able to destroy Gwambe’s rebellion before it had time to spread. In the m eantime, we had to find a place where we could work undisturbed. The task of providing th e president with the moral courage and energy to meet the crisis occupied us for most of the morning. Melville had to appear on television and state that he believed the explosion to have been an accident. (It had destroyed an area with a thirty mile radius—it wa s no wonder we felt it in Washington.) This did a lot to soothe the nation’s nerves. Then the whole American defence system had to be el aborately checked, and a secret message sent to Gwambe warning him that there woul d be instant reprisals in the event of any further explosions. We decided that it would be better to announce that we were still alive. It was almost impossible to keep this from the parasites. On the other hand, the announcement of our deat h might cause widespread despair, since millions of people now looked to us for leadership. But when we sat together for an early lunch, there was a heavy atmosphere of gloom. It seemed impossible that we could win. The only hope was to admit another hundred or so men into our circle of ‘initiates’, and then try to destroy Gwambe by the same methods we had us ed against Georges Ribot. But in all probability we would be under constant observation from the parasites. There was nothing to stop them from taking ove r other leaders as they had taken over Gwambe. In fact, they could even take over Melville! It was no use thinking about making Melville himself an ‘initia te’. Like ninety-f ive per cent of the human race, he would never be capable of grasping the problem. We were in constant danger. Even as we walked thr ough the streets, the pa rasites might take over some passer-by, and hurl him at us like a missile. And one passer-by with an atomic pistol could make short work of us. It was Reich who said: ‘It’s a pity we can’t simply move to another planet and start another race.’ It was not intended to be a serious observation. We knew that no planet in the solar system was habitable; in any case, earth had no space ship capable of carrying human beings the fifty million miles to Mars. And yet... would this not be the answer to the security problem? America did have several rockets capable of carrying five hundred people to the moon. And then there were the thre e satellite stations that were in or bit round the earth."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" While we remained on earth we were in constant danger from the parasites. Alone in outer space, there would be no danger. Yes, that was obviously the answer . Immediately after lunch, Reich, Fleishman and I went to the president a nd explained our idea. If the parasites succeeded in destroying us, then the earth was lost anyway. Having won that battle, they would ruthlessly exterminat e everyone who tried to rediscover our secret. The best hope for the earth lay in a llowing about fifty of us to embark in a moon rocket, and spend the next few weeks on one of the satell ites, or cruising around between earth and the moon. In that time, we mi ght be strong enough to challenge the parasites. If not, then the fifty of us would split up into teaching groups, and each group would take another fifty men into space. We would finally create an army capable of taking over a country. It has been suggested by one hist orian that we ‘took over’ President Melville as the parasites had taken ove r Gwambe, and forced him to agree to everything we asked. Such a course would, of course, have been justifiable in the crisis; but it was unnecessary for us to take it. Melville wa s glad enough to do whatever we suggested; th e crisis terrified him. * * * I have said that Spencefield and Remiz ov had provided us with a list of a dozen men who could be admitted to our circle. We had only covered half this list. Moreover, Holcroft, Ebner and the rest had a number of suggestions of their own. The result was that by late afternoon, we had spoken to some thirty men, all of whom agreed to join us. The US Air Force collaborated with us in getting them to Washington, and by eight the following morning our group had swelled to thirty-nine members. It should have been forty-one; but the plane bringing two psychologists from Los Angeles cras hed over the Grand Canyon. We never discovered the reason for the accident , but it was not difficult to guess. The president had arranged that we could leave earth the following afternoon from the rocket port at Annapolis. In the mean time, we put our twenty- eight pupils through a high-speed course in phenomenology. We discovered that practice was making us perfect or very nearly so. Perhaps the general atmosphere of crisis also helped. (It had certainly produced an amazing change in Merril, Philips, Leaf, and Ebner.) Before the day was over, we actually had one of our new recruits producing slight PK effects on a piece of cigarette ash. Still the feeling of foreboding was on us. It was a highly unpleasant sensation—a feeling that we were menaced from the outside and the inside. Against any individual enemy we woul d have felt confident. But it was frustrating to realize that the parasites might use any one of several billions of people against us. It produced a ‘needle in the haystack’ feeling of hopelessness. I must also admit that we kept a close check on the president during all the time we were in Washington; it would have been so easy for the parasites to take over his brain circuits."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" Meanwhile, Gwambe’s success in Africa was startling. When the United Nations issued a warning to him, he simply used it for propaganda purposes—the white men trying to bully the blacks. And the speed with which his revolt spread made it very clear that the parasites had made Africa the scene of a mass operation of mind-invasion. Without cons ulting their troops, negro generals declared their allegiance to Gwambe. It took Gwambe only about three days to become virtually the master of the United States of Africa. The whole of that night before we left earth, I lay awake thinking. I had found that I now needed only a few hours’ sleep a night. If I allowed myself to oversleep, the result was a weakening of my mental powers, of my control over my own consciousness. But I now felt that I had to come to grips with a problem that teased and tormented me. I had a feeling that I was overlooking something important. This was a feeling that had been with me vaguely ever since that night when the parasites destroyed a ll but five of us. It seemed that, in a sense, we had been at a standstill ever since then. Oh, we had won various mi nor battles against them—and yet there was still a feeling th at our major achievements were over. This seemed stranger still si nce the night of the battle. Animals are very nearly machines; they live on reflex and habit. Human beings are also very largely machin es, but we also possess a degree of consciousness, which means, in essence, freedom from habit, the ability to do something new and original. Now I ha d the frustrating feeling that the ‘something’ I was overlooking was one of th e thousands of habits that we still take for granted. I was struggling for a gr eater control of my consciousness, but I was overlooking some deep-rooted habits th at stood in the way of real control. Let me try to make this point clear. What bothered me was connected with the tremendous rush of vital energy with which I had defeated the parasites. In spite of all my efforts to grasp its sour ce, it still evaded me. Now most human beings discover that sudden emergencies arouse inner-powers of which they were not aware. A war, for example, may turn a hypochondriac into a hero. This is because the vitality of most people is controlled by subconscious forces of which they are not aware. But I was aware of these forces. I could descend into my own mind like an engineer into the m achinery of a ship. And yet I could not get to that source of real inner power. Why? The emer gency of my battle with the parasites had enabled me to call on these tremendous energies. There was something unreasonable about this failure to get down to the root of my vital powers. All that night, I wrestled with the problem; I tried to descend deeper and deeper into my own mind. It was useless. There seemed to be some invisible obstacle—or perhaps it was simply my ow n weakness and lack of concentration. The parasites seemed to have nothing to do with it; I didn’t see a single one. At dawn I felt tired, but I went with Reich, Holcroft, and the Graus to the Annapolis rocket base to make a fi nal check. It was as well we did. We interviewed the whole team who had pr epared our rocket, on the pretext of"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" asking them routine questions . They all seemed comple tely honest and friendly. We asked them how the work had gone, and they said that it had been a smooth routine job with no hitches. But Holcro ft, who had been watching us without saying anything, suddenly asked: ‘Is there a member of your team who isn’t present?’ Colonel Massey, who was in charge of the team, shook his head. ‘All the engineers are present.’ Holcroft persisted: ‘But is there anyone apart from the engineers?’ ‘Only one man but he’s not importa nt. Kellerman, Lieutenant Costa’s assistant. He had an appointment w ith the psychiatrist this morning.’ Costa was the man whose chief task was the programming of the electronic brain that co-coordinated the workings of the rocket: fuel, temperature, air control, and so on. I said casually: ‘I know it isn’t importan t, but we’d like to see him. Just a matter of routine.’ ‘But Lieutenant Costa knows far more about the robot than Kellerman does. He can answer any queries.’ ‘All the same, we’d like to see him.’ So a call was put through to the base psychiatrist. He said that Kellerman had left him half an hour before. A ch eck with the guard house revealed that Kellerman had gone out on a motorcycle twenty minutes ago. Costa said awkwardly: ‘He has a girl -friend on the unive rsity campus, and I sometimes let him ride over to take a co ffee break with her. I suppose that’s where he’s gone.’ Reich said casually: ‘I’d be glad if you’d send someone over there to fetch him back. In the meantime, would you check all the circuits of the robot brain?’ * * * An hour later, the check had revealed that the brain was in perfect order. But the orderly who had been sent to the univers ity returned without Kellerman. No one had seen him. Costa said: ‘Well, he’s probably gone off into town to do some shopping. It’s a breach of regulations, of course, but I suppose he thought we wouldn’t notice on a busy morning...’ Colonel Massey tried to change the subject, bu t Reich said: ‘I’m sorry, Colonel, but we don’t intend to leave in this rocket until we’ve spoken to Kellerman. Would you mind putting out a general call for him?’ They obviously thought us mad and boorish, but they had no alternative but to agree. So a dozen military police cars were sent out, and all the police in the area were alerted. Then a check at the local helicopter terminal revealed that a man of Kellerman’s description had ta ken a plane for Washington several hours ago. The hunt immediately spread to Washington, and the police there were alerted, too."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" Kellerman was finally picked up at three-thirty in the afternoon—an hour after we were supposed to ha ve blasted off. He had taken a return trip back from Washington, and was recognized at the lo cal helicopter terminal. He protested that he had slipped off to buy his girl -friend an engagement ring, and thought no one would notice. But as soon as we sa w him, we knew our precaution had been justified. He was a curious kind of split personality; a whole area of his personality was completely immature. The parasites had taken advantage of this. There had been no need to take over hi s brain; the alteration of a few minor circuits had been all that was nece ssary. His schoolboyish desire to feel important did the rest. It was the same kind of mechanism that sometimes makes juvenile delinquents derail trains for the f un of it: a desire to join the adult world by doing something that has adult consequences. Once we had Kellerman, there was no difficulty in bullying the truth out of him. He had made some minute adjustment s to the temperature controls of the ship, so that the temperature would incr ease very slightly in outer space—too slightly for us to notice. But this cha nge would cause an au tomatic adjustment on the part of the robot. This adjustment would affect the brakin g mechanism of the ship, so that when we approached the satellite, our speed woul d be far too great; we would smash through the satellite, dest roying ourselves and it. The ordinary circuit checks had naturally failed to reveal this: after all, an electronic brain has some billions of possible circuits, and a ‘check’ only consists in making sure that its main junctions are responsive. We left Kellerman to his fate—I un derstood he was later courtmartialled and shot—and blasted off finally at four-thirty. By six o’clock we were doing four thousand miles an hour in the directi on of the moon. The gravitational mechanism of the ship was of the old ty pe: the floor was a ma gnet, and we wore special clothing that was attracted towards it, so that we appeared to have normal weight. The consequence was that we all experienced space dizziness for the first two hours. When we felt normal, we gathered in the dining-room, and Reich gave a preliminary talk on the pa rasites, and how Husserl’s method could be used to combat them. Further lectures were put off until the following day, since everyone felt too disturbe d and excited by their new surroundings (most of us had never been in space before ) to feel like ‘lessons’. While we were on the earth side of the satellite, we could pick up television. We switched on the news at 9:30. And the first thing I saw was the face of Felix Hazard, making an impassioned speech to a vast crowd of people. Eight hours before—at seven-thirty Be rlin time—Hazard had made his first Munich speech on the glory of the Aryan race, and calle d for the resignation of the present social democratic government, and of the chancellor, Dr Schroder. The response had been nation-wide. Two hours later, th e New Nationalist Movement announced that its leader, Ludw ig Stehr, had voluntarily ceded his position to Felix Hazard. Stehr was quoted as saying that Hazard would revive the old glory of the Aryan races and lead the nation to victory. There was much"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" talk about the ‘insolent thre ats of racially inferior groups’, and long quotations from Gobineau, Houston Stewart Chambe rlain and Rosenberg’s Myth of the Twentieth Century. It was obvious what had happened. Th e parasites had done their work in Africa, and fixed habit patterns of revolt. Now they had turned their attention to Europe. So far, the world had taken Gwa mbe’s revolt fairly quietly. Militant negro nationalism had become so much a matter of course in the twentieth century that no one found it too alarming; besides, most countries had defence systems that were impregnable even to hydrogen rockets. The parasites now set out to produce stronger reactions—a reviva l of Aryan racism. It is said that it takes two to make a quarrel; the parasites were making sure that this quarrel would not remain one-sided. This was the biggest danger yet. Europe was in no real danger from Africa. But Africa’s defence system was crude compared with that of Europe or America. It had been the African policy to spend most of its money on raising the standard of living to the European le vel, and the present defence system was largely the result of the ge nerosity of Russia and China. Half a dozen well-placed hydrogen bombs could wipe out millions of Africans. In all probability, Russia and China would feel obliged to interv ene, and the result was bound to be world war. I must admit that my spirits sank lower than at any time in the past months. Our task now seemed hopeless. At this ra te, the world could be at war within a week before we returned to earth. It looked as if there was nothing we could do. It was not even certain that there would be an earth for us to return to. The next thing that would happen was easy to pred ict: the parasites would turn their attention to disabling each country’s defence system by taking over key brains. America and Europe would cease to be impregnable as traitors sabotaged their early warning systems. I slept for only a few hours, and got up at four to watch the nine A.M. news from London. (Our clocks, of course, were set to American time.) It was bad. The German chancellor had been assassina ted, and Hazard had declared that the social democratic government was outlawed. As a true representative of the will of the German people, he appointed himself Chancellor. His party would take over the government of Germany. Th eir new headquarters would be the Reichstag in Berlin instead of the pa lace in Bonn. All members of the public were authorized to shoot members of the ‘renegade government’ on sight. (This later proved to be unnecessary; the social democrats accepted their dismissal, and declared their support for Hazard.) Hazard now announced his new scheme for white supremacy. When the ‘inferior races’ of the world had been subdued, they would be deported en masse to Venus —that is, about a billion negroes! This idea apparently aroused immense enthusia sm in countries all over the world, including Britain and America. (No one poi nted out that even if Venus could be made habitable, the cost of shipping a billion people thirty million miles would take more money than ther e was in the whole world.)"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" We were due to pass the halfway mark to the moon at seven o’clock that evening. By this time, we would have lo st television cont act with the earth, although we would still be receiving ra dio signals. The question now arose: should we turn the nose of the ship, and stay within a day’s journey of the earth? If there was going to be world war we would be better off on earth, actively combating the parasites. At least we could help to prevent the parasites from penetrating the defence system of Ameri ca. It would only take one of us placed in every defence unit in America to keep the parasites at bay and one of us in the Pentagon to make sure there was no treachery from higher up. This seemed so obviously the best polic y that we were all surprised when Holcroft opposed it. He could give no coherent reasons for opposing it; he simply said that he had a ‘hunch’. Sin ce his ‘hunch’ had alre ady saved our lives once, we were inclined to pay attention to what he said. I talked to him later, and tried to get him to explore the source of his hunch. After some groping, he finally said that he felt that the further we got from earth, the better. I must admit that I was disappointed. However, our decision had been made. We went on towards the moon. For the most part, the ten ‘old hands’ among us succeeded in forgetting the threat that hung over us, and concentrated on our phenomenological problems. It was less easy to make the others forget. Many of them had left families behind them and they were naturally worried. W ith a great deal of bullying, we managed to make them work ten hours a day on mind discipline. It was not easy, but after the second day we began to win this part icular battle. The sheer tension involved worked in our favour once we had persuaded them to forget the worries they had left on earth. It kept their efforts highl y disciplined. We had none of the trouble that we’d had earlier with Merril, Philips, Leaf and Ebner. And yet I was still dissatis fied. After fifty hours of flight, we were within forty thousand miles of the moon. And I act ually had a sense that the parasites were closer than ever. I talked about it with Reich, Fleishman and the Graus after we’d finished our classes. There were certain basic fact s about the parasites that we had never got clear. Theoretically, it should make no difference whether we were in outer space or on earth. They were in the mind, so one could not get further away from them. Anyway, they had not bothered us directly since the night when they destroyed most of us. They had realized that we could be defeated indirectly through a world war. And yet in a sense, the parasites were in space, for I had found them in my Percy Street rooms keeping a watch on Karel Weissman’s records. How did I explain this paradox? Well, they were bot h in space and out of it. After all, our minds are both in space and out of it. You cannot localize the mind; it does not occupy space. Yet it moves in space with our bodies. Again, I had the feeling of some clue that was missing. We sat there, going over the whole thing slowly, step by step."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" I said: ‘The parasites are in space, in a sense, because they are on earth. They came to earth deliberately to f eed on the human race. Now we know that human beings all appear to have sepa rate minds, because when each of us descends into his own mind, he loses dir ect contact with the others. And yet we also know that, in some deeper sense, human beings share a common mind, a kind of racial mind. We are li ke all the taps in a city, each one separate, and yet each drawing our water from some main reservoir...’ Reich interrupted (I am quoting literally from a tape recording we made): ‘But you said that you defeated them by drawing on some immense deep source of energy. Would that be the original reservoir itself?’ ‘I suppose so,’ I said. ‘But, in that case, these things are li ving in the reservoir, and the energy would also be available to them. How do you account for that?’ Yes, that was it! We were getting closer. Obviously, the depth of the mind where they lived and the reservoir of vita l energy that I had drawn upon, were two quite different things. That reservoir might be in the depths of the mind, but it wasn’t the same thing as the depths of the mind. ‘Very well,’ Fleishman said, ‘where does that get us?’ It was Heinrich Grau who said slowly: ‘I think I can see where it gets us. We are talking about some immense, primeval source of energy, what Bernard Shaw called the Life Force. It is th e raw vitality that drives us all.’ His brother Louis interrupted with excitement: ‘But why should the parasites bother with individual human beings if they could steal their energy direct from the source? So obviously...’ ‘Obviously they can’t,’ Heinrich sa id. ‘They have to get between the source and the human individual.’ We were not following them. I asked: ‘Which means...?’ ‘Which means that this basic source isn’t available to them—is probably actively hostile to them. In other words, if we could somehow get down to this source, we’d probably have enough en ergy to destroy the parasites.’ I explained that this thought had been in my mind earlier, although I hadn’t analysed its implications so clearly. Th e trouble was that I couldn’t get down to the source. Every time I tried, I had a sense of inadequate will-power. Reich said: ‘But if the parasites ar e between you and the source, they’re probably obstructing you somehow.’ We now began to see that this was a real possibility. The parasites had always used this ‘obstructing’ method against the human race—deliberately distracting the mind when it began to get to grips with its own secrets. We had learned how to prevent this: by penetrating to those depths of the mind from which the parasites normally operated. Th ey had retreated to depths where we could not follow, and were probably us ing the same old methods against us. So far, I had been assuming that so me ‘natural’ cause prevented me from penetrating below a certain depth in my mind. A dive r can only reach a certain depth in the sea at which the weight of wa ter he displaces is equal to the weight"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" of his own body. If he wants to go deeper, he has to put heavier weights on his diving suit. But I did not know of any method of making my mind heavier so that I could descend deeper into myse lf, and I had been assuming that this explained my failure to penetrate deep er. But did it? Now I thought about it, I realized that what prevented me from going deeper was a drain on my sense of purpose. My mind seemed to go blank; my sense of individuality became more precarious. In other words, it was very possible that I was being obstructed. I decided to test this again, and the others did the same. I closed my eyes, and made the usual descen t through the memory layers . But now I found that it was difficult to pass through them. Everyt hing seemed turbulent and violent, like swimming under the sea after a depth charge has exploded. I r ecollected that my dreams on the previous night had had th is same violent, disturbed quality. * * * Why? There seemed to be no parasites around. What was causing the disturbance? I tried hard to go lower, and succeeded, with immense difficulty, in sinking to the nursery level. But here it was worse. These wild, innocent energies had gained a kind of nervous force. They are usually characterized by a deep- breathing serenity and order, like the gent le heaving of a calm sea. Now the sea was distinctly choppy. I knew this was as far as I could go, so I allowed myself to surface quickly. Reich was already back. His experience of course had been identical with my own. As we waited for the others to retu rn, we discussed th e problem. Were we, perhaps, experiencing some great psychi c disturbance that affected the whole human race? Or... With a sense of helpless frustration, I crossed to the port, and looked down on the great, glowing surface of the moon that spread below us. It was now a mere eight hours away. I glan ced at the controls, to verify that they were compensating for the gravitational pull of the satellite. And as I did so, the fantastic idea flashed into my mind. Gr avity... the moon. I turned to Reich, and said: ‘This is probably just a stupid guess, but... could they be using the moon as some kind of base?’ ‘A base?’ he said blankly. ‘How coul d they? There aren’t any people there. And they don’t inhabit empty space, as far as we know.’ I shrugged. ‘It’s just an idea... to explain w hy our minds seem so disturbed.’ Holcroft came in at this moment, and I told him briefly what we had discovered. He closed his eyes, sat on a bed, and quickly verified that the subliminal layers of the mind were in an unusual state of disturbance. And although he had not heard my question, he turned and pointed through the front port at the moon."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" ‘It’s that. It’s somehow affecti ng us as it affects the tides.’ I asked him: ‘How do you know?’ He shrugged. ‘I can tell. I can feel its pull.’ This was possible. Lunatics... men whose minds are affected by the gravitational pull of the moon. But why? Why should the moon affect the mind? I asked Holcroft: ‘Do you think there are parasites there?’ He shook his head. ‘I don’t see how there can be. And ye t... it’s somehow connected with them.’ We decided that the others had better be brought into this discussion. It was the kind of problem where anyone’s ideas might shed light. So I asked them all to come in. Then I explained it as briefly as I could. It was a nuclear physicist called Berger who came up with the only useful suggestion. ‘Do you know the work of the philosopher Gurdjieff? He always said that human beings were food for the moon. He compared the human race to a flock of sheep that are bei ng fattened for the moon...’ I asked Holcroft: ‘Does that make sense to you?’ He said seriously: ‘I thi nk it does. There can be no doubt whatever that the moon exerts a curious pull on the huma n mind. This is nothing to do with gravity. We also believe that the moon wa s never a part of the earth or the sun— that it came from somewhere else. Perhaps it was a come t that the earth captured. Its chemical composition is quite unlik e the earth’s. Now supposing that the moon does steal human energy... or affect it in some way.’ Reich said: ‘You mean that it might be the base of the parasites?’ ‘No, I don’t think it is. But I believe that the parasites might make some kind of use of the moon all the same. I f eel it’s emitting some kind of disturbing energy—psychic energy. It’s a kind of gian t transmitter, and the earth’s a giant receiver...’ The others now began c ontributing fragments of moon legends that I had never heard. They told me about the Horbiger cult, to which Hitler had belonged, with its belief that the earth captures a new moon every ten thousand years or so. According to Horbiger, the present moon is earth’s seventh. The other six all ended by falling on the earth and causing tremendous cataclysms that destroyed most of mankind. The flood recorded in th e Bible was due to the fall of the sixth moon. Others in the group mentioned other moon theories—Velikovsky’s, Bellamy’s, Saurat’s—which seem to indica te that this notion of the moon as a hostile force had preoccupied many different minds. Most of these theories sounded too absurd to ta ke seriously. The fact remained that I was conscious that the moon was producing a definite disturbance in the pre-cons cious levels of my mind. Re ich also pointed out that the parasites seemed to have most power during the night. I had always assumed that this was because the mind is tired at the end of the day. Yet when I had"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" occasionally slept during the day, and stayed awake all night, I had been dimly aware of an increased feeling of vulnera bility during the night. I asked Holcroft: ‘Do you think it possible th at the parasites somehow use this curious energy emitted by the moon—use it to interfere with human thought processes?’ But Holcroft knew as little about this as the rest of us. Still, one thing was very clear. We had to find out whether we could get beyond the range of this disturbing influence. If, as Holcroft suggested, the moon was a gigantic transmitter and the earth a receiver, then we had to get right out of range of them both. That meant that our present course ha d to be changed, for it would take us in a huge arc within ten thousand miles of the moon. I radioed Colonel Massey back in Anna polis, and explained that we wanted to change our route, and go on into outer space, aiming roughly between the present positions of Jupiter and Saturn. Massey said that he saw no reason why not: we had fuel for another fortnight. Th is meant that we could risk going on for another three quarters of a million mile s before turning back. If he’d known earlier, he said, we could have carried e nough fuel to take us half-way to Mars. I said that I thought half a million miles should be far enough from earth. That is more than twice the distance between earth and the moon. * * * Following Massey’s instructions, I made the necessary changes in the robot control. Then I rejoined the others for supper. It was a curiously cheerful meal considering our situation. We were hurtling beyond the moon, and penetrating regions of space where no human being had ever ventured except the crew of the ill-fated Proclis. Somehow, anxieties about the earth dropped away from us, as business worries vanish on the first day of a holiday. That night, I slept more deeply and peacefully than for several weeks. * * * I woke up and looked at my watch; it was half past seven. I tried to remember why I was feeling so happy. Had I had a pleasant dream, perhaps? I could recollect no dreams. I got up and walked to the rear port. The moon was an immense crescent, with its mountains cl early visible. Near ly a quarter of a million miles behind it lay the great blue-green crescent of the earth, like an immense sun. The sun itself was a blinding white, as if about to explode, and the stars all looked many times larger than on earth. The sense of de light in me rose to such a pitch of intensity that I had deliberately to suppress it. I closed my eyes, and sank into my mind. It was calmer than yesterday, although the turbulence was still present. And now it seemed obvious to me that this turbulence was due to the moon. But its power had weakened. The result was a delightful feeling of inner calm a nd freedom, as if one were convalescing from an illness."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" I went and woke up Reich and Holcroft. I noticed that they looked healthier and happier than I had seen them for many weeks. They were experiencing the same freedom. None of us said much, but we all felt the same enormous hope. Nothing happened that day. We me rely sat around, watching the moon recede, and observing in ourselves the steady growth of freedom. In a sense, it was the most eventful day of my life, and yet there is almo st nothing I can say about it. * * * And it is at this point that the langua ge problem arises. Words begin to fail because our normal language has never had to describe these experiences. I can only try to suggest a parallel. Imagine a country of tiny dwarfs, who have various words and phrases for size: large, big, enormous, immense, vast, and so on, and who, when they wish to describe the idea of immensity, say: ‘As vast as a man.’ What would then happen if one of the dwarfs was snatched up by an eagle, and carried into the air above Mount Everest? How could he ever find a word to explain that the mountain was so large th at even a man is tiny in comparison? This is my problem. I shall not try to take refuge in cant phrases about the impossibility of describing it in words. No thing is indescribable in words if you take the time and the troubl e. If your present language framework is inadequate, then you must carefully create a larger one. Still, this is impracticable at the mo ment. An adequate description of what happened in the next ten days would require a long book, full of analogies. I must try to do my best with the inade quate linguistic resour ces available to me. What was happening, then, was that we were moving beyond the range of the mind parasites. We understood this on the first day. They were still present in my mind. I c ould tell as soon as I closed my eyes and sank into myself. I was now aware of them in the regions below the nursery. They were still beyond my reach, but I co uld sense their panic. They didn't like being half a million miles away from earth. As the gap widened, their panic increased. I knew then that they were creat ures of low intelligence. If they had been able to think logically, they would have realized that we would be back on earth within a fortnight. They would have no difficulty su rviving during this time. But they felt a wholly irrational pa nic, the kind of thing a child feels on leaving home. They had been on earth for a long time, swimming in the dense seas of human vitality, moving freely fr om one human being to another, always with a wide choice of prey. Now they felt their psychic links with the earth stretching and growing weaker, and they were frightened. Some of us were less happy about this. We mistook the fear of the parasites for our own—which was natural, since we felt it rising from instinctive depths of our own minds. The more experienced ones among us had to maintain a constant vigil to make sure that none of our new recruits succumbed to panic. We now"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" understood the nature of the ‘space fever’ that had so far frustrated all man’s efforts to penetrate far into space. But as the days passed, we knew that we had defeated the parasites; that it would only be a matter of time before th ey surrendered to the panic. Every day added 120,000 miles to the distance between us and the earth. It was simply a question of how far we would ha ve to go before they cracked. I now found that I could descend into my mind with extr aordinary ease. I could do it without effort, without even closing my eyes. At last I was beginning to understand what Teilhard de Chardin meant when he said that man’s true home is the mind. I was able to move around in my mind as simply and as freely as a man with a motor car can move around the country. I could also pass through the ‘nursery’ region, and float down into the ‘nothingness.’ But now I was aware that it was far from being a ‘ nothingness’. It certainly had some of the attributes of empty space stillness, lack of all tension. But it was like the stillness at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, where the pressure is so enormous that no creatures can live. The ‘nothingness’ was pure life energy—although words are now becoming so inaccurate that they are almost meaningless. I sometimes spent many hours in this sea of darkness, doing nothing, merely hovering. This is hard to grasp, because we are so accustomed to movement, and the parasites have so confused our habitual thought-processes. But stillness is natural to man: stillness and utter calm. Every poet knows this, for in stillness he begins to understand the greatness of his own inner powers or ‘soul’, as Wordsworth would have said. If you throw a pebble into a stormy sea, it ha s no effect. If you th row it into a still pond, you can see every ripple, and hear them lapping agai nst the bank. The parasites have always kept man’s mind stormy, by harnessing the disturbing energies of the moon, and this is why man has never been able to make use of his enormous powers. Poets and so-called ‘m en of genius’ are the only ones who even suspect the existence of such powers. A point came where we had a decision to take. We had been out from earth for ten days. We had enough fuel to take us back as far as the nearest artificial satellite. The mind parasite s were obviously near break ing point. Could we risk pushing on into space, and perhaps finding ourselves stranded? We had ceased to use all electrical equipment, knowing that the energy would be needed. The ship had immense photon sails which had been spread as soon as we were out of the earth’s atmosphere, and to some extent we were pushed onward by the pressure of sunlight. Much of the energy used to drive the ship’s engines also came from the sun. But, obviously, the photon sails would be of no use for returning to earth, for ‘tacking’ with a space ship is in finitely more complicated than with a yacht. It was true that we used very little energy as we went onward; we were ‘free-wheeling’ into space, the only opposing forces being the gravitational pull of distant planets, and of the meteorites th at swooped past us at a rate of two or three an hour."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" We decided to risk it. Somehow, it was impossible to feel pessimistic about our prospects of returning to earth. And so we went on steadily, ignoring the problems, waiting for the para sites to loosen their grip. It happened on the fourteen th day, and none of us an ticipated what it would be like. During the morning, I was aware of their increasing fear and of their hatred. My mind became cloudier and more turbulent than at any time since we left the moon. I was sitting with Reich near the rear port, staring back towards the earth. Suddenly his face distorted with fear, and I felt a wave of panic. I looked out of the port to see if he had seen something that frightened him. When I looked back, his face had become gre y, and he looked like a very sick man. And then he shuddered, closed his eyes for a moment and became transformed. He began to roar with laughter, but it was the healthy laughter of enormous delight. And at that moment, I felt an awfu l tearing feeling in the depths of my being, a pain as if some living creature were trying to eat its way out of me. Physical and mental agony became identical . It seemed obvious that I could not survive. Then I heard Reich yelling in my ear: ‘It’s all right! We’ve beaten them. They’re leaving!’ Now the thing became atrocious. Something infinitely evil and slimy was pushing its way down inside me . For a moment, I realized that I had been wrong to think of the parasites as separate beings. They were one: they were ‘It’, something I can only compare to an immense, jelly-like octopus whose tentacles are separated fro m its body and can move about like individuals. It was incredibly nasty, like fee ling a pain under your clothes, and finding that some great carnivorous slug has eaten its way halfway into your body. Now this infinitely vile thing was coming out of its lair, and I could feel its hatred of me, a hatred so powerful and maniacal that it almost needs a new word. Then the infinite, inexpressible relief of knowing it was gone. My reaction was unlike Reich’s. The happiness and gratitu de that rose in me were so strong that I felt as if my heart would burst, and tears blinded my eyes so that the sun’s light became a great glare that reminded me of swimming under water when I was a child. When this passed away, I felt like a convalescent who has just seen the doctors removing some loathsome cancer from inside him. The others were eating in the next room . We rushed in and told them what had happened. Everyone became immensely excited and began asking us questions. No one else had started to feel the preliminary pains. I presume that it was our position looking back towards the earth that had cause d us to experience it first. So we advised the others to m ove into the other room and warned them what to expect. Then Reich and I went to the other end of the ship, where everything was in darkness, to make our fi rst trip into the new free country of the mind. * * * "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" And this is the point where I become awar e that anything I say will be a lie. So I must make an effort to explain, rather than try to make everyday language do a job for which it was never intended. Freedom is the most important expe rience that can happen to human beings. In ordinary life, we experience it momentarily when some emergency calls upon all our energies, and then is s uddenly overcome. What happens then is that the mind becomes an eagle, no longe r tied to the immediate present. The greatest human problem is that we are all tied to the present. This is because we are machines, and our free will is almost infinitesimal. Our body is an elaborate machine, just like a motor ca r. Or perhaps a better simile would be those ‘powered’ artificial limbs worn by people who have lost an arm or leg. These limbs, with their almost indestruc tible power units, are as responsive as our real arms and legs, and I am told that a man who has worn them for years can totally forget that they are not real limbs. But if the power unit should break down, he quickly realizes that his limb is only a machine, and that his own will- power plays a very small part in its movements. Well, this is true of all of us. We ha ve far less will-power than we believe. This means that we have almost no real freedom. This hardly matters most of the time, because the ‘machine’—our bodies and brains—is doing what we want anyway: eating and drinking and excreti ng and sleeping and making love and the rest. But poets and mystics have moments of freedom when they suddenly realize that they want the ‘machine’ to do something far more interesting. They want the mind to be able to detach itsel f from the world at a moment’s notice, and float above it. Our atte ntion is usually fixed upon mi nute particulars, actual objects around us, like a car in gear. Then, in certain moments, the car goes into ‘neutral’; the mind ceases to be engaged w ith trivial particulars, and finds itself free. Instead of being tied to the dull real ity of the present, it is free to choose which reality it prefers to contemplate. When your mind is ‘in gear’, you can use your memory to recall yesterday, or to create a picture of a place on the other side of the world. But the picture remains dim, like a candle in the sunlight, or a mere ghost. In the ‘poetic’ moments, the moments of freedom, yesterday becomes as real as now. If we could learn the trick of putti ng the mind in and out of gear, man would have the secret of godhead. But no tric k is more difficult to learn. We are ruled by habit. Our bodies are robots that insist on doing what they have been doing for the past million years: eating, drinking, excreting, making love and attending to the present. Now my first discovery of the existence of the parasites enabled me to break the ‘habit’, which the parasite s had been carefully fostering and strengthening. What it meant was that I s uddenly realized that it is not in the nature of things that man should get brie f glimpses of freedom, his ‘intimations of immortality’, and then lose them immediately. There is no reason why he should not experience them for ten hours a da y if he likes. (Mor e than that would"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" be harmful, because after all, we have to attend to the trivia lities of the moment sometime.) Since the beginning of August when I first read Karel’s Historical Reflections I had been con tinually awake to the possibi lities of my own freedom, and this in itself meant that I had broken the chain that binds most human beings. The parasites relied mainly on habit and ignorance to keep the human race in chains. But they had also established th emselves at a deep level of the human psyche, where they could ‘drink’ the energi es that human beings draw from their wellspring of vitality. I should try to make this point qu ite clear. If man had not been an ‘evolutionary animal’, the parasites would have found a permanent host. There would never have been the faintest ch ance of man discovering their existence. They could have spent eternity happily ‘tapping’ man’s power cable, and man would never have been any the wiser. But a small percentage of the human race—about a twentieth, to be precise—are evolutionary animals with a deep and powerful urge to become truly free. Thes e men had to be ‘distracted’, and for this reason, the parasites had to m ove towards the surface of the mind, to manipulate their puppets. This was how they had given themselves away. * * * I have said that man draws his power from a secret life source in the depths of his being. This source is man’ s inviolable centre of gravity, his real being. It is completely indestructible. The parasite s therefore had no access to it. All they could do was to ‘steal’ energy in tran sit from this deep source to man’s conscious being. And now I can perhaps explain something of what I discovered when I made a fresh attempt to enter into my self, although my warning about language must be constantly borne in mind. * * * First of all, I observed an extraordin ary stillness in my mind. There was no longer any turbulence of any kind. This wa s because it was at last my mind, with no interlopers. At last, it was my own kingdom. This also made an immense difference to my dreams and memories. Anyone who has tried to sleep when his brain is over-tired, or he has a touch of fever, knows that awful sensation when all the thoughts seem to be fishes rushing about at a great speed, and they all seem alien. The inside of the head, which should be a ‘fine and private place’, is like a fairground crowded with strangers. Well, I had never realized unt il this moment how far the brain is always a fairground crowded with parasite s. For now it was completely calm and silent. My memories stood in orderly arra ys, like troops at a royal salute. At a single order, I could make any one of them step forward. I realized the truth of"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" the statement that every thing that has happened to us is carefully stored in the memory. Memories of my earliest childhood were as accessible as memories of yesterday. What is more, memories of pr evious lives were now connected in a continuous sequence with memories of my present life. My mind was like a completely calm sea, that reflects the s ky like a mirror, and whose water is so clear that the bottom is as visible as the surface. I understand what Jacob Boehme meant when he talked of a ‘Sabbath of the spirit’. For the very first time in my life, I was in contact with realit y. No more fever, no more nightmare, no more delusions. The thing that astounded me most wa s the tremendous strength of human beings, to have succeeded in liv ing, in spite of the terrible veil of insanity that hides them from reality. They must be one of the hardiest species in the universe. Now I descended through my mind like a man walking through the halls of a castle. For the first time, I knew what I was. I knew that this was me. It was not ‘my mind’, because the adjective ‘my’ re fers to only a minute section of my being. It was all me. I penetrated through the ‘nursery’ la yers, those bright energies whose purpose is to establish man’s moral balan ce, to act as moral policemen. When a man is tempted to believe the world is ev il, and has to be f ought with evil, these powers are drawn to the su rface as white blood corpuscles are drawn to an infected area of the body. All this wa s clear to me for the first time. Below them was the great sea of moti onless life. It was now no longer a sea of darkness and nothingness. As I descende d into it, I became aware that it had a quality of luminescence and warmth. This time, there was no obstacle, no force of blindness and malevolence to push me back. And then I began to unde rstand something which is almost impossible to express. There was no point in going deeper. Those de pths contained pure life, and yet, in a sense, they also contai ned death, the death of the body and of consciousness. The thing we call ‘life’ on earth is a co mbination of the pure life forces with the body; it is liaison betw een life and the inanimate. I say ‘the inanimate’ because ‘matter’ would be the wrong word. All matter is alive in so far as it exists. The key word here is ‘existence’. No huma n being can understand the word ‘existence’ because he is in it. But to exist is not a passive quality; it is to thrust out from non-existence. Existence in itself is a shout of affirmation. To exist is to defy non-existence. You can see that it is all a problem of language. I am being forced to make do with one or two words when I need about fifty. It is not quite analogous to describing colours to a blind man, because no human being is entirely ‘blind’; we all have glimpses of freedom. But freedom has as many colours as the spectrum. All this means that in trying to descend towards the ‘source’ of my life I was leaving behind the realm of existence, for the source does not exist; that is to say, it does not stand ou t from non-existence. "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" (The above passage comes from a manuscript written in 2005. (M. F.- WHA-3271). We have included it for the sake of continuity. This whole problem is covered in minute detail in Austin ’s monumental Life, Being and Language (2025-2041), particularly Vol. 8, chaps. 7-9.) * * * All this was freedom; the beautiful, ine xpressible intoxication of freedom. My mind was my own; and I was the first hum an being to achieve super humanity. And yet I had to leave these fascinating prospects to consider the problem that had brought us into outer space: the ear th and the mind parasites. So I came reluctantly back to the surface. And I looked on Reich as a stranger, and saw that he was looking at me in the same way. We smiled at one another, like two actors who have just finished rehearsing a scene in which they are enemies. I said: ‘What happens now?’ He said: ‘How far did you get?’ ‘Not far. There was no point.’ ‘What powers can we draw upon?’ ‘I’m still not sure. I’d like the advice of the others.’ We went back into the other room. Fift een of them had lost their parasites, and were helping the others. Some of th e new recruits were in such agony that they were likely to damage themselv es, like a mother who writhes around the floor as she gives birth. It cost us a c onsiderable effort to soothe them, since force would have been of no use—it woul d only have intensified their terror. One man kept screaming: ‘Turn the shi p, turn the ship, it’s killing me.’ The creature inside him was obvious ly trying to force him to ma ke us return to earth. His release came twenty minutes later, and he was so e xhausted that he immediately fell asleep. By eight o’clock that evening, it was all over. Most of the new recruits were so dazed that they could hardly speak. They were suffering from an extreme version of the ‘double exposure’ effect. They knew they were not themselves—not the people they had always taken themselves for—but they had not yet discovered that these strange de pths of alien being were themselves. There was no point in trying to explain, since this would confine them to the conscious part of the personality; th ey had to find out for themselves. At all events, about ten of us were pe rfectly clear-headed. We now realized that there could be no problem about fu el for the rocket. Our united PK powers could drive this rocket as far as Pluto at a thousand times its present speed. But that would serve no purpose. We had to go back to earth, and to decide how we intended to fight the parasites. It woul d not be difficult to destroy Gwambe and Hazard, but this would only be a temporary expedient. The parasites could create new Gwambes and Hazards at will. And we could not destroy all their followers, or undertake to ‘re-programme’ their minds . We had to play this game according to the parasites’ rules. It was like a game of chess, with human beings for pawns."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" We discussed it far into the night without arriving at any definite plan. I had a feeling that we were on the wrong track altogether. We were thinking in terms of out-generalling the parasites. But there must be some other way... At three o’clock in the morning, Reic h woke me up. I should say that his mind woke me up, for he was in the ne xt room. We lay in the dark, and conversed telepathically. He had not been to sleep; instead, he had been thinking back, slowly and methodical ly, over the whole problem. He said: ‘I’ve been trying to corr elate everything we know about these creatures. Because there’ s one thing that baffles me. Why should they hate leaving the earth so much? If they’re in the mind, it should not make any difference to them where they are.’ I suggested: ‘Because they exist at a level of the mind that’s common to all human beings—Jung’s racial unconscious.’ ‘That’s still no answer. Distance ma kes no difference to thought. I can communicate telepathically with someone on earth as easily as with you. So we’re still a part of the human subconscious mind. In that case, they ought to be as comfortable here as back on earth.’ I asked: ‘What do you think?’ ‘I still think it has somethi ng to do with the moon.’ ‘You think they use it as a base?’ ‘No. It’s something far more complicated than that. Listen to me, and tell me if this makes sense to you. Let’s start with the Kadath business. We know that all that stuff about the “Great Old Ones” was untrue. We assume therefore that there is no real connection betw een the mind parasites and Kadath—that they simply used it as a gigantic red herring to keep man looking for his enemies outside himself. Now this is probably true. But even so, doesn’t Kadath offer us certain clues? The first thing it proves beyond all shadow of doubt is that the usual dating of human history is a mistak e. According to geology, man is about a million years old. All that means is th at we haven’t found any human remains that date back further than that.’ ‘And the earliest remains indicate th at he hadn’t progressed far beyond the ape a million years ago,’ I reminded him. ‘Who hadn’t? Pekin Man? Australopithecus? How do we know they were the only kind of man? Don’t forget th at the Romans had a high degree of civilization when the British were still sa vages. And the Hittit es were civilized when the Romans and Greeks were still savages. It’s all relative. Civilization tends to develop in pockets. Well, the one thing we know about the evolutionary process is that it favours intelligence. So why should we make the curious assumption that man only appeared a milli on years ago? We know that dinosaurs and mammoths and giant sloths and even horses existed millions of years before that. Man must have had some kind of primitive, ape-like ancestor back in the Jurassic. He didn’t just appear from nowhere. ‘You’ll agree that the exis tence of Kadath bears out this theory? The only alternative theory is that the inhabita nts of Kadath came from another planet."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" ‘So we concede that man is a great deal older than a million years. But that raises the problem of why civilization didn’t develop sooner. And there again, I’m inclined to pay attention to the va rious myths about the destruction of the world—the great flood, and so on. Now, supposing the various moon-cranks are right, and there is some tr uth in the notion that the great flood was caused by the moon falling on the earth?’ * * * I was not entirely with him so far. I coul d not see what these speculations had to do with the mind parasites. ‘You will in a moment. If we correlate the various flood myths, we arrive at the conclusion that the flood took pl ace in fairly recent human history—say around five thousand B.C. Supposing, th en, the flood was caused by the moon circling closer to the earth, as Horbiger suggests? Could this mean that our present moon has been circling the eart h for only about seven thousand years?’ ‘I agree it’s possible.’ * * * ‘A curious line of maritime deposits can be traced from Lake Umayo, in the Peruvian Andes, (13,000 feet above sea level) extending for three hundred and seventy-five miles southwar d to Lake Coipusa. The line is curved, ending some eight hundred feet below its beginning, which is close to the equator. The disciples of Horbiger and Bellamy argue—convincingly, in my opinion—that these strange deposits indicate that the sea once formed a kind of bulge around the equator. This could only have been due to the moon being far closer to the earth than at present, and circling at a fa r greater speed, so that the “tide” never had time to retreat. The ruins of Tia huanaco, near Lake Titicaca, add another curious fragment to this puzzle. It c ould be said to be “above the Pacific Ocean”—twelve thousand feet above it; yet there are many indications that it was a port more than ten thousand years a go. The ruins are of su ch size that one can only surmise that they were built by giants—that is to say, by men who could grow to two or thr ee times the present averag e height by reason of the lesser gravitational pull of the earth (which the moon would neutralize)... Stranger still is the fact that among these ruined cities of the Andes the bones of toxodons have been unearthed and the toxodon is an animal that vanished from the earth a million years ago. Heads of t oxodons are carved on some of the ruins of Tiahuanaco’. G. Austin, Frontiers of Archaeology , p. 87. London 1983. * * * "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" ‘But as an archaeologist, would you say th ere is any real evidence to support the idea or is it just wild guesswork?’ ‘I think there’s a great d eal of evidence. I said as much in a book I wrote twenty years ago. But I still can’t s ee any connection with the parasites.’ ‘I’ll tell you. I’ve been brooding on this question of the origin of the parasites. Weissman said he thought they landed on earth about two hundred years ago. But we know they don’t like outer space. So where did they come from?’ ‘The moon?’ ‘Possibly. But that’s still supposing th at they can exist apart from the human mind.’ And, suddenly, I saw what he meant. Of course! We now had an important clue about the origin of the parasites— they didn’t like existing apart from the mass of mankind. Why shouldn’t they? The answer was so shatteringly simple that it was unbelievable. They couldn’t exist apart from mankind because they were mankind. The clue was there in the fi rst sentence of Weissman’s Historical Reflections: ‘It has been my conviction... that the human race is being attacked by a sort of mind cancer’. A cancer. And a cancer cannot live apart from the body of its host. But what causes a physical cancer? This was one of the problems whose answer is self-evident to anyone who has explored his own mind. It springs from the same root as the ‘split personality’. Man is a continent, but his conscious mind is no larger than a back-garden. This means that man consists almost entirely of unrealized potentialities. Th e so-called ‘great men’ are the men who have had the courage to real ize some of these potentialities. The ‘average man’ is too timid and cowardly to make the attempt. He prefers the security of the back- garden. Now a ‘split personality’ occurs when some of these unrealized potentialities take their revenge. So, fo r example, a timid man, who possesses a strong sexual urge which he tries to suppr ess, wakes up one day to find that he has committed a sexual assault. He tries to excuse himself by saying that it was as if ‘another being’ took over his body and committed the assault. But that ‘other being’ was really himself—a part of himself that he was too cowardly to recognize. Cancer is also caused by the ‘unrealiz ed potentialities’ ta king their revenge. The earliest cancer research wo rkers noticed that it is a disease of frustration or of old age. Men who have the courage to fulfill themselves do not die of cancer. But men who possess potentialities, but lack the courage to express them, form a high proportion of cancer patients. Their life-mistrust poisons their souls. Both cancer and split personality become impossible as soon as a man learns to descend into his inner-bei ng, for it becomes impossible for these pockets of frustration to build up. In a sense, Karel Weissman was right: the ‘parasites’ did appear about two centuries ago. The men of previous centu ries were so preoccupied with holding"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" body and soul together that they had no tim e to be frustrated. They were more ‘unified’ than modern man; they lived on a more instinctive level. Then man reached a watershed in his evolution, a point where he had to become a more conscious, more intellectual and self -critical being. The gap between his conscious level and his instinctive leve l grew wider. And suddenly, cancer and schizophrenia ceased to be rare dise ases and became commonplace. But what was the significance of the moon in all this? Again, cancer provides the clue. Cancer is due to a general drop in the level of vitality, due to frustration or old age. But this in itself is not sufficient to start the cancer. There has to be some specific irritant, a bruise, for example. If we consider life as a kind of electrical force that inhabits a human body, as magnetism inhabits a magnet, then we could say that the bruised flesh is no longer capable of carrying the same magnetic current as the rest. It slips to a lower level and proceeds to develop on its own, a kind of ‘split personality’. If oysters were higher organisms, the irritant of the pe arl would be enough to cause cancer. Reich’s theory of the mind parasites was ro ughly this: About ten thousand years ago, the moon was pulled slowly towards the earth by earth’s gravitation. It was probably earth’s th ird or fourth moon. It took about two thousand years before it finally crashed on the earth, splitting in pieces. The sea, which had been held near the equator by the moon’s gravity, was now able to rush back over the earth in a huge tidal wave, destroying al l that existed of civilization. (But not the Kadath civiliza tion; that had been destroyed by a much earlier moon.) * * * For a thousand years or so, earth had no moon, and very little life. Then it captured another space-wanderer, anothe r giant meteorite—our present moon. But it had captured an exceedingly dange rous satellite. For this new moon was ‘radioactive’ with strange forces, forces th at could exercise a disturbing effect on the human mind. Any theories about the origin of thes e forces is guesswork. Reich’s theory which I think as likely as any was as follows: the moon had once been part of some larger body, perhaps a sun, and had been inhabited by creatures who were ‘bodiless’ in the physical sense. This is less absurd than it sounds. Scientists used to declare that certain planets could never contain life because life could not survive under their conditions; they disc overed that life can gain a foothold under the most unpromising conditions. Life that could gain a foothold on the sun would certainly not be ‘physical’ in the sense that we understand it. A great burning fragment had been torn from this sun by a passing comet, and the hot gases had condensed into th e moon as we know it today, gradually destroying its inhabitants. But since they were not ‘bodies’ in the earthly sense, they could not die in the ordinary way. They tried to adapt to the cooling matter"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" of their world, becoming a pa rt of the molecular structur e of the solid as they had once been a part of the st ructure of the hot gas. So the moon remains ‘radioactive’ with a strange, alien life. If the moon had not been captured by our earth, this alien life would have died long ago, for life can only exist wh ere the second law of thermodynamics operates—that is to say, where there is energy flowing from a higher to a lower level. But the moon was kept ‘alive’ by the closeness of th e earth, a planet seething with life and energy. Its presence was like the continual smell of a hot dinner to a starving man. And as the hum an race slowly gained a new foothold on the earth, men were dimly and instinc tively aware of the living presence of the moon. * * * And here, I believe, we have the answer to the question about the origin of the parasites—of the ‘irritant’ that caused the cancer. Lower forms of life—fishes and mammals—are unaffected by the ‘wat chers’; they live on an instinctive level, and the alien presence seems quite natural to them. But man slowly proceeds to become the master of the earth, and he does this by developing his intellect, his conscious mind. So he b ecomes ‘split’, separated from his instinctive drive. Frustrat ions build up, and turn into fiery little pockets of suppressed energy. And at this point, th e ‘irritant’ of the moon, the constant psychic pressure of half-fro zen life, begins to produce its predictable effects. The mind-cancers begin to develop. It may seem that all this theorizing was built upon rather slender evidence. This is not true. It was all built upon l ogic starting from that puzzling question: Why were the parasites af raid of outer space? An immediate answer suggested itself. As man loses touch with his ‘inner being’, his instinctive depths, he fi nds himself trapped in the world of consciousness, that is to say, in the wo rld of other people. Any poet knows this truth; when other people sicken him, he turns to hidden resources of power inside himself, and he knows then that other people don’t matter a damn. He knows that the ‘secret life’ inside him is the real ity; other people are mere shadows in comparison. But the ‘shadows’ themselves cling to one another. ‘Man is a political animal,’ said Aristo tle, telling one of the greatest lies in human history. For every man has more in common with the hills, or with the stars, than with other men. The poet is a more or less unified being; he has not lost touch with his inner powers. But it is the other men, the ‘sha dows’, who are subject to mind-cancer. For them, human society is the reality. They are entirely concerned with its personal little values, with its pettin ess and malice and self-seeking. And since the parasites are a projection of these creatures, is it surprising that the parasites themselves cling to human society? They had no place in our space ship, for we"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" were all men who knew the secret: that man is never ‘alone’, for he is directly connected to the universal powerhouse. In other words, even if we had not gone out in space, our minds would have been no harbour for the parasites. In us, the cancer was slowly dying of starvation. Our journey in to space had only hastened the process. As we separated from the rest of humankind, our first sensation was a terrible fear and loneliness, like a child being separated from its mother for the first time. In that moment, one faces the great question. Is man really a social being who has no existence apart from other men? If that is true, then all our human values are lies: goodness, truth, love, religion and the rest—for these values are, by definition, absolute, more important than other human beings. That fear caused a new turning-inwar d, to the ‘source of power, meaning and purpose’. Those false telephone wires th at connect us to other human beings are cut. This does not mean that other human beings cease to be important. They become far more important, for you reali ze that, in a certain sense, they are immortal. But you become aware that all our so-called ‘human’ values are false, based on man’s devaluation of himself. That was why the parasites were fo rced to leave us. The deeper we journeyed into space, the more certainly we faced that truth: that other men do not supply our values. Other men do not matter in the sense we have always believed. Man is not alone. You could be the last man alive in the universe, and you would not be alone. Reich and I talked for the rest of the night. And when dawn came—or the hour that would be dawn on earth—something had happened to both of us. Within the past few hours we had changed. The chrysalis had become the butterfly. We no longer belonged to the earth. This empty space around us was our home just as much as that absurd litt le green globe that was two million miles behind us. It was a little frightening. It felt like being a beggar who suddenly inherits a fortune. He looks at the rows of servants waiting for his orders; he contemplates all the things he could do with so much money; he looks at the vast estates that now belong to him... and his mind reels; he experiences a certain vertigo, a terror of freedom. There was so much to be explor ed, so many things we didn’t know... But first, there was anot her task: to bring home this knowledge to the others. And although the earth was no longer our home, there could be no doubt of what we had to do next. We had b ecome policemen of the universe. I went across to the robot control panel. A week earlier, I’d had to get detailed instructions from Colonel Masse y. Now the thing seemed as simple as a child’s toy. I quickly made the nece ssary adjustments and pressed the re- programming switch. The ship immediatel y retracted its photon sails, and fired a"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" turning rocket. We began to turn in a slow, gentle arc. The others woke up and came to see what was happening. I said: ‘We’re return ing to earth. Give me your help in making this ship go faster.’ We locked our minds in parallel, and began to induce a delicate alternating current of will. And then, very slowly, we allowed it to discharge over the back of the ship. It was as if a giant hand ha d squeezed the ship like a great fish. We felt the spurt of acceleration, and did it ag ain. Again the ship responded. We tried stronger charges; the ship vibrated but responded. This was a delicate and dangerous business. We could apply a force equal to a dozen hydrogen bombs, but it had to be applied in such a manner that it would be transformed into linear velocity. Carelessly applied, it could wr eck the ship and disintegrate it into atomic dust. Reich and I could now surviv e this, but the others couldn’t. There was something amusing in being two million miles out in space in this absurd, crude tin rocket, that seemed to have been designed by imbeciles. Reich and I agreed that one of our first tasks on reaching the earth would be to show men how to construct a real space ship. The easiest and quickest way to explain to the others was to communicate telepathically. For this purpose, we all held hands in a circle, as in a seance. It took only about five seconds to communicate to them what had taken us most of the night to understand. For, in a sense, it was something they already knew. We had explored the road in the dark ; they were walking it by daylight. This was in itself an interesting e xperience. I had not looked at Reich during the night—we had been in different rooms. Neither had I bothered to look at my own face in the mirror. But as soon as we had transmitted our knowledge to the others, we saw a remarkable change come over them. It was, of course, to be expected, and yet to see it on so ma ny faces at once was a strange sight. The usual adjectives fail to express it. I could say that they became ‘nobler’ or greater, but that is a long way from the truth. It would be more accurate to say that they became child-like. But the sense of this mu st be understood. If you look into the face of a very young baby—say six months old—and then into that of an old man, you suddenly understand that subt le quality known as life, joy, magic. No matter how wise and good the old man is , he lacks it. But if the child is happy and intelligent, it radiates this qua lity, and it is almost painful to see, because he obviously belongs to a bright er universe. He is still half-angel. Adults—even the greatest—devalue life; a baby trusts and affirms with its whole being. It was this quality of pure life that suddenly descended into the breakfast room of the space rocket, and it is no ex aggeration to say that it felt like the dawn of creation. Seeing it in one anot her deepened the powe r and certainty in each one of us. And it was this that brought a new level of knowledge. When I had said to them: ‘Man is not alone’, I had understood what I meant, but all its implications were not clear to me; I was speaking about the source of power, meaning and"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" purpose. Now I realized that, in a far more obvious and simple sense, we were not alone. We had joined the police of th e universe, and there were others. Our minds now made instant contact with these others. It was as if we had sent out a signal which had instantly been picked up by a hundred receivers, who immediately signalled their presence back to us. The nearest of these receivers was situated only about four thousand m illion miles away, a cruising ship from a planet in the Proxima Centauri system. I shall say no more about this, since it plays no further part in my story. We were travelling at a speed of ab out a hundred thousand miles an hour. With two million miles to cover, this meant we were about twenty hours from earth. The moon, of course, revolves a bout a quarter of a million miles from earth, and it was still between us and th e earth which meant that we would be passing it in about seventeen and a half hours. Our busin ess, we knew, lay with the moon. There was no thought, at this stage, of actually moving the moon. Its weight is approximately 5 x 10^15 tons—t hat is to say, five thousand billion tons. As yet, we had no idea of how much mass our combined PK powers could move, but there seemed little enough chance that they were great enough for this task. Besides, what if we did succeed in pushing off the moon into outer space? The constant irritant upon the human psyche would vanish; but it had now done its work. The mind parasites would survive in any case. In spite of this, it was obvious that the moon was the key. It was something that demanded immediate investigation. * * * We were within fifty thousand miles of the moon before we again became aware of its pull. Reich and I looked at one another. The significance of this fact was obvious. In some obscure way, the moon was ‘aware’ of us. On our way out from the earth, it had been aware of us fr om the moment we left the earth, and its ‘attention’ had continued to focus on us long after we had passed beyond it. Now we were approaching from behind, and it di d not ‘notice’ us un til we were within a mere fifty thousand miles. The cloud ing of the faculties that we had experienced on the way out was now less marked. We knew what it was; trapped life forces that somehow observed us hopefully. The ‘clouding’ was actually an emotional disturbance. But once you becam e aware of its nature, it was not difficult to combat. This time, we turned the space ship directly into the moon. We began to brake immediately. Half an hour later, we landed gently, throwing up a great cloud of silvery moondust. I had been to the moon before, and it had merely seemed a dead rock. Now it was no longer dead; it was a tortured liv ing landscape, and the sense of tragedy was enormous, like looking on the burnt-out shell of a building where you know a thousand people had died."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" We wasted no time in trying the expe riment that had brought us here. Without leaving the spaceship (for we ha d no space suits, not having expected to land anywhere), we directed a beam of will-power at an immense mass of porous rock that looked like a great ant hill. Twel ve of us were linked in parallel, and the power we exerted could have blasted a crater ten miles wide. The whole of the ‘ant hill’—a mass about a mile hi gh—disintegrated like the Abhoth block, turning into a fine dust that formed a kind of fog around th e space ship. There was also considerable heat that made us all uncomfortable for ten minutes. And yet as the rock disintegrated, we all e xperienced for a moment a tingling of pure joy, like a very faint electric current. It was impossible to doubt. We had released the trapped life forces. But since they now had no ‘body’, they vanished, dissipated in space. There was something dreadfully oppressive about the moon. Shelley had exhibited a sixth sense when he asked: ‘Art thou pale for weariness?’ And Yeats had shown almost frightening perception wh en he compared the moon to an idiot staggering through the sky. This was wh at was wrong. It wa s like visiting a tormented soul in bedlam. Half an hour later, the moon lay far behind us, and the whole of the front port was occupied with the misty blue gl obe of the earth. This is always an exciting moment—to see the moon behind you, the earth in front of you, both about the same size. But on this occasi on, we still had business with the moon. We wished to establish how far it could be influenced by psychokinetic force. It will readily be seen that th is had to be done from a position midway between the earth and the moon, since we had to 'brace' ourselves against the earth. Obviously, we could exert no fo rce from our space ship; the moon’s incomparably greater mass would turn such force against ourselves and destroy us. Our ship was merely the third angle of a flattened triangle. This was a difficult exercise. First of all, it involved all of us for the first time—fifty minds in parallel. This actually proved to be the most difficult part of the problem. Most of them were barely aw are of their powers of psychokinesis, and now they were being asked to run these immature powers in double harness with a crowd of other people. Fleishman, Reich and myself had to act as directors of the force. What we were doing was highly dangerous. Never had the space ship seemed so tinny and crude. One man losing control for a moment could easily destroy us all. So the three of us concentrated upon preventing accidents, while Holcroft and Ebner c oordinated the attempt to build up the vibratory wave of PK energy. Then it wa s necessary to ‘feel ’ our way to the earth; and this in itself produced a s hock. It was suddenly like being back in Washington. Earth was transmitting ‘life’ as powerfully as the moon; not frustrated, imprisoned life, but fear a nd neurosis. The correctness of Reich’s theory about the mind parasites becam e immediately obvious. The people of earth were building up panic waves just as we were building up psychic energy; this panic removed them further from th eir true selves, and created a cancerous"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" shadow, an alter-ego, that immediately achieved a stra nge independent reality— as you can sometimes look at your reflecti on in the mirror and imagine it alive. Once we had established our contact wi th earth, we were in a position to exert a double leverage on the moon—a di rect beam of PK energy from the space ship, and a reflecte d beam from the earth. The point of this experiment was not to affect the moon in any way, but to gauge our response to it, as a cricketer might weigh the ball in his hand. I have said that the sensation of using PK energy is not very different from the sensation of actually touching something. The only difference is that its range is far greater. In this case, once we had es tablished the reflected beam from earth, we could actually gauge the moon’s resi stance. This meant simply exerting an increasing force, and finding out what ha ppened. I had no dire ct experience, of course; it was all Reich, Fleishman and I could do to ‘steady’ the force, to prevent its vibrations from wrecking the ship. We were aware of its increased power by the increase in the vibrations. Finally, I sharpl y ordered them to stop. It was becoming too dangerous. I asked Holcroft what happened. He said: ‘I’m not sure, but I think we got a response. It’s not diffi cult to encompass the moon. But it’s hard to say how much pressure would affect it. We’d have to try again from earth.’ He meant, of course, that the PK beam had been able to explore the shape of the moon. * * * But we still had no idea of whether it could be moved by PK force. We were all exhausted. Most of us slept for the remaining hour of our journey to earth. At nine o’clock we fired the brakin g jets and slowed down to a thousand miles an hour. At 9:17, we entered earth ’s atmosphere, and cut off all power. Massey’s control beam now pi cked us up, and we were able to leave the rest to him. We landed at a few minutes before ten. It felt like coming back after a thousand years. Everything in us had changed so completely that the earth its elf seemed a changed place. And the first thing we noticed was, perhaps, predicta ble. Everything seemed infinitely more beautiful than we had remembered it. This came as a shock; it was something we had not noticed on the moon, because of the satellite’s disturbing influence. On the other hand, the human beings who greeted us seemed alien and repulsive, little better than apes. It was suddenly incredible that these morons could inhabit this infinite ly beautiful world and yet remain so blind and stupid. We had to remind ourselves that man’s blindness is an evolutionary mechanism. Instinctively, we all shielded ourse lves from the gaze of other men, doing our best to appear unchanged. We felt the shame that a happy person feels among hopeless misery. Massey looked very tired and ill."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" He said: ‘Well, sir, any luck?’ ‘I think so,’ I said. His face changed, and the fatigue fe ll away. I felt a sudden wave of affection for him. These creatures might be little more than idiots, yet they were still brothers. I put my hand on his arm, a nd let some of the lif e flow out of me into him. It was a pleasure to see how quickly he became transformed—to watch the energy and optimism straightening his shoulders and taking the lines out of his face. I said: ‘Tell me what’s been happening since we left.’ The situation was serious. With tremendous speed and total ruthlessness, Gwambe had occupied Jordan, Syria, Turkey and Bulgaria. Where there was resistance, inhabitants had been destroyed by the thousand. A cosmic ray accumulator, that had been developed by African and European scientists for use in sub-atomic physics, had been turned into a weapon of war by the addition of a geronized-tungsten reflector, and all th e inhabitants of Jerusalem had been destroyed in a few minutes. From then on, there had been no resistance. An hour before we landed, Italy had surrendered, and offered Gwambe passage through Italian territory. The German armies we re massed along the frontiers of Styria and Yugoslavia, but the first major clash of the war had not taken place. The Germans were threatening to use the hydr ogen bomb if Gwambe used his cosmic ray accumulator, so it seemed probable that a long drawn ou t ‘conventional’ war would now follow. Fourteen high explosiv e rockets had penetrated the American air defences, and one of them had starte d a fire that had been raging in Los Angeles for the past week. It was difficult for the Americans to counter-attack with rockets because Gwambe’s armies were diffused over such an enormous area; but earlier in the day the president had announced th at in future an African town would be destroyed by rockets every time an African rocket penetrated the American defence system. But it was obvious to everyone that this was not a war that anyone could hope to win. Each retaliatory meas ure was only another step towards mutual destruction. The general feeling about Gwambe was that he was a homicidal maniac who constituted as grea t a threat to his own people as to the rest of the world. Strangely enough, no one had yet realized that Hazard was equally insane and dangerous. During the fortnight when Gwambe was occupying the Mediterranean countries, Ge rmany and Austria were mobilizing. Cape Town, Bulawayo and Livingstone had been heavily damaged by German rockets, but so far there had been no concerted act of war against Africa. But when it had been rumoured that Hazar d was moving mobile launching sites for hydrogen rockets into Austria, both th e Russian premier and the American president had appealed to him not to use atomic weapons. Hazard’s reply had been noncommittal. It seemed to be generally felt that he would behave sensibly. We knew better. So did president Melville, but he had had the sense to keep this to himself. A rocket plane took us to Washington; before midnight, we were eating a meal with the president. He also looked exhausted and ill, but half an hour with us restored his spirits. The White House domestic staff did an admirable job of"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" providing a scratch meal for the fifty of us in the great dining-room. Almost the first thing he said to me was: ‘I don ’t know how you can look so unconcerned.’ ‘Because I think we can stop this war.’ I knew that this was what he wanted to hear. I did not a dd that it suddenly seemed unimportant to me whether or not the human race destroyed itself. It was irritating to be back among these sq ualid, quarrelsome, small-minded humans. He asked how we proposed to stop the war. ‘First of all, president, we want you to get on to the central television agency and announce that you will be a ppearing in six hours’ time to make an announcement that concerns the whole world.’ ‘And can you tell me what it is?’ ‘I’m not yet sure. But I thi nk it will concern the moon.’ At a quarter past midnight, we were all out on the White House lawn. Clouds obscured the sky, and there was a cold, rainy drizzle. This made no difference to us, of course. Each of us knew precisely where the moon was situated. We could feel its pull from behind the clouds. We no longer felt tired. All of us fe lt immensely exhilarated by our return to earth. We also knew instinctively th at there would now be no difficulty in stopping this war. Whether the parasites could be defeated or not was another matter. Our practice in space had served us well. With the earth braced against us, it seemed the easiest thing in the world to lock our minds in parallel. This time, there was no need for Reich, Fleishman a nd me to act as controllers; the worst that could happen now was that we might shake down the White House. There was immense exhilaration as our minds combined, such a sense of power as I have never known before. A ll at once I knew what is meant by the phrase: we are ‘members of one another’, but in a deeper, realer sense than before. I had a vision of the whole human race in constant telepathic contact, and able to combine their psychic powers in this manner. Man as a ‘human’ being would cease to exist; the vistas of power would be infinite. Our wills locked like a great searchlight beam, and stabbed out at the moon. At this stage, we made no effort to increase the power through vibration. The actual contact with the moon was a surp rise. It was suddenly as if we were in the middle of the noisi est crowd the world has ev er known. The disturbing vibrations from the moon were transmitted directly along the taut cable of force that stretched between us. In fact, ther e was no audible noise; but for a few seconds our minds lost contact as the tid al wave of psychic disturbance broke over us. Then we combined again and braced ourselves against it. The beam of will grasped the moon, felt its shape, as a hand might feel an orange. For a moment, we gripped gently, waiting. Then, guided by Reich and myself, we began to generate pure motive power. The moon’s distance seemed to make no difference. From this, I inferred that our strength was so great that a mere quarter of a million miles was a stone’s throw. In the next twenty minutes we put this to the test. It was important to do it"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" slowly, not to waste our strength. This giant, five thousand billion ton globe, was swinging gently on the end of the thread of earth’s gravity, unable to escape. In a sense, therefore, it was weightless: all its weight was supported by the earth. And slowly, very slowly, we exerte d a gentle pressure at the moon’s surface, a pressure designed to make it rotate. At first, nothing happened. We increased the force, braced tightly agains t the earth. (Most of us found it more convenient to sit down, in spite of the wet.) Still nothing happened. We were holding it gently, completely untired, a nd allowing the force waves to build up almost of their own accord. At the end of a quarter of an hour, we knew we had succeeded. The moon was moving, but very, very slowly. We were like children pushing a giant roundabout. Once the initial inertia had been overcome, there was no limit to the speed we could induce by gently increasing the pressure. But the roundabout was not rotati ng in a direction parallel to the earth. Instead, we made it rotate at right angles to its ow n line of motion around the earth—that is to say, in a North-South direction. The North-South circumference of th e moon is roughly six thousand miles long. We continued to apply the force until the point of its application was moving at three thousand miles an hour. This took a little over five minutes, after we had overcome its inertial mass. This meant that the moon would rotate on its own axis once every two hours—a speed th at should serve our purpose in every way. We went indoors again and drank hot co ffee. Fifteen leading senators had joined us by now, and the room was overcrowded. We asked them to be quiet, and then all sat there, our minds focused on the moon, to see whether our manoeuvre had worked. It had. Within twenty minutes, a half of the segment that our moon usually presents to the earth was turned away fr om us, into outer sp ace. A half of the face that this earth has never seen was turned towards us. And, just as we surmised, the moon’s disturbing forces were halved. For thousands of years, these beams of psychic energy had been directed towards the earth. Now they were pointing away into space. The frozen vital forces in the moon no longer had active intelligence. They were not able to assess the situation and recognize that their home was rotating. Besides, it was rotating in a manner that complicated the situation. For centuries, their attenti on had been directed at the earth, which rotates from left to right, with a surfa ce velocity of a little over a thousand miles an hour. Now their own home was rotating at right angles to the earth. The result was inevitably confusion. At the end of an hour, the former dark side of the moon was turned entirely towards the earth. The disturbing vibrati ons from the moon had almost ceased. We asked various senators if they noti ced any difference. Some did not; others looked slightly puzzled, and said that it felt more ‘peaceful’ than an hour ago. It was then we were able to tell the president what he had to say. The plan was simple and obvious enough. He had only to declare that an American space"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" research station on the moon had been wi ped out, after reporting the presence of gigantic aliens, who had arrived in force. He seemed sceptical about whether it would work. We assured him it would, and sent him to get some sleep. I was not present when the president made his historic broadcast. I was taking my longest and deepest sleep since we left earth a fort night before. I left orders that no one was to awake me. So when I woke up at ten o’clock, it was to learn that our first result had been achie ved. The whole world had been tuned in to the president’s television appearance. In the larger cities of the world, the news of the moon’s axial rotation had already caused hysterical excitement. (And I had reason to reproach myself, fo r my old friend Sir George Gibbs, the Astronomer Royal, had collapsed with a h eart attack when he saw it through the telescope of Greenwich observatory; he died a few hours later.) The president’s announcement of aliens on the moon verifi ed everyone’s worst fears. No one asked why aliens should have caused the moon to rotate. But that it was rotating was plainly visible to ever y eye during the next twenty -four hours. It was almost at the full. Over large areas of Asia and Europe visibility was perfect. Admittedly, the rotation was not imme diately visible any more than the movement of a clock’s minute hand is vi sible—but anyone who stared at it for more than ten minutes could see plainl y that its major landmarks were moving slowly from North to South. We had hoped that this news would tu rn everyone’s thoughts away from war, but we had reckoned without the parasites. At midday, we heard that six hydrogen rockets had been fired into nor thern Yugoslavia a nd Italy, destroying an area of over a thousand square miles. Hazard was determined not to end the war without firing a shot. It would have b een convenient if he had at least killed Gwambe. But apparently he hadn’t—Gwambe made a television appearance later that afternoon, and swor e that, aliens or no alie ns, he would never forgive Hazard for this slaughter of his men. (Actually, it was mainly Italian and Yugoslav civilians who died; the bulk of Gwambe’s forc es were further south.) From now on, Gwambe said, it was total warfare to destroy the white races. At six o’clock that evening, the news was better. Thousands of Gwambe’s men were deserting. The prospect of a lien invasion from the moon made them anxious to be with their own families. But still Gwambe announced that his men would fight to the death. A few hours la ter, the town of Graz in Styria was destroyed by a hydrogen rocket. Half a million of Hazard’s men died. Three more rockets landed in open country betw een Graz and Klagenfurt, killing only a few people but devastating hundreds of square miles. Late that night, we heard that Hazard’s forces had finally crosse d the border into Yugoslavia and had engaged a large force of Gwambe’s men at Maribor. The actual town of Maribor had been completely destroyed by the co smic ray gun, and the clash of armies took place a mile outside the town. Now suddenly it was clear that we ha d to act. We had hoped that this moon-threat would stop the war for a fe w days, and give the World Security"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" Council time to act. What had the parasites to gain by continuing the war? If the world was destroyed as it undoubtedly woul d be they would be destroyed, too. On the other hand, if the war could be st opped, their chances of survival were almost non-existent. Now we knew the secret that the parasites lost their nerve in outer space we could destroy thousands of them a day (unless, of course, they learned to adapt to this new threat). Perhaps they hoped that a few thousand people would survive the cataclysm, as they had survived earlier moon-disasters. Whatever the reason, it looked as if they were determined that the human race should commit suicide. The important thing was haste. If Gwambe or Hazard was really out for universal destruction, it would not be t oo difficult. Even a fairly incompetent engineer could easily convert a ‘clean’ H bomb into a cobalt bomb with a jacket of cobalt; it could be done in twenty-four hours. It is true that even in this event, the human race could still be saved; it w ould simply be a matter of finding some way of clearing the atmosphere of coba lt sixty. Our psychokinetic powers were capable of dealing with the problem, but it could take months or years. Perhaps the parasites reckoned on this. In Durango, Colorado, a group of scientis ts had been working on a type of space rocket powered by giant photon sails . We had heard talk about it at Base 91. It was constructed of a specially light alloy of lithium and beryllium, and was enormous in size—as it had to be to support its giant sails. I spoke to the president. How far had the project advanced? Could the ship be used yet? He contacted the Durango base and came back with the answer: No. The structure was complete, but the engines were still in the experimental stage. I told the president this was unimportant. All we needed was the ship. And it had to be sprayed black. The base repl ied this was impossible: its surface area was nearly two square miles. The president scowled and shouted into the telescreen. Then he pulled out the plug. He told me that the sh ip would be black by the time a rocket plane could get us to Durango. The sheer size of the ship startled us. It was being constructed in the immense crater made by the impact of the 1980 meteor. Its construction was top secret. The crater was roofed with an opaque force barrier. An d under this barrier the Durango rocket looked like an immens e and foreshortened bullet. Its largest flat area was its rear end, which housed the sails. This was two thousand feet high. We arrived at the Durango base five hours after the president’s call. The whole place stank of cellulose paint, and everything was covered with black spray. The men themselves were all black fr om head to foot. But the ship itself was also black, every inch of it. It was nearly midnight. We told major-general Gates, the station commander, that all the men were to be sent home, and the force barrier was to be withdrawn. He had been told to obey every order without question, and he gave us excellent co-operation. But I have never seen a man look so completely puzzled. He showed us the mechanism for operating the photon sails. These had"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" not been painted black, and they were of bright silver, and shaped roughly like a butterfly’s wings. I must admit that we all felt a little absurd, standing in the immense silver hall. It was icy cold and smelt of spray paint The controls ha d been installed, but very little else. There was another year’s work to be done on the interior. There were only six seats at the fr ont, near the controls. The ot hers had to sit on camp stools that had been installed for them. But as soon as we began the work of getting it off the ground, this feeling of absurdity vanished. There were no difficulties; the shell was extremely light. One man could have moved it alone. As it was, we assigned th e task of powering the ship to a ten-man team led by Eb ner. I undertook the steering. The only man who was not a member of our team was Captain Haydon Reynolds of the U.S. Air Force, the navigator. He obviously w ondered what he was doing there, since a ship without engines needs no navigator. We lifted off at twenty minutes after midnight, rose to a height of ten thousand feet, and proceeded due east. Reynolds was so astounded for the first quarter of an hour that it was difficult to get any coherent instructions from him. Then he settled down, and from then on the flight was uneventful. The American defence system had been warned that we w ould be breaking through the early warning system at half past midnight, and we had no trouble. At a quarter to one, our television se t brought warning that some immense intruder had entered the ear th’s atmosphere from the direction of the moon. This was according to the instructions we had left with the president. Over the Atlantic, we accelerated to a speed of a thousand miles an hour. The result was that the temperature in the ship increased uncomfortably. But time was important. When we set out fr om Durango, it would already be half past eight in the morning at Maribor. We had five thousand mile s to travel, and it was important to do it before evening fell. Before we crossed the European coast, we increased height to twenty five thousand feet. We knew that early warn ing systems all over France and England would be ringing by this time, and that we would need constant vigilance. The first rocket was launched at us from so mewhere near Bordeaux. Ten of our team under Reich were maintaining the force barrier around the ship, and exploded it when it was two miles away from us. Un fortunately, Reich fo rgot to block the force waves, with the result that we were all suddenly tossed about like corks in a storm. For a few seconds we lost cont rol, then I managed to block the force waves, and we moved forward smoothly ag ain. After that, Re ich took care to direct the force of the explosion away from us. The television screens showed us that our passage was universally observed. The explosion of the missiles that were aimed at us left no one in any doubt that we were the moon-aliens, and that we had some kind of destructive ray. By one o’clock, European time, we we re directly over the battlefield at Maribor. We had reduced height to a few thousand feet. Since our method of"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" propulsion made no sound, we could distinctly hear the explosion of shells underneath us. * * * It was as well that we had chosen a sh ip of this size. The battlefield was enormous—ten miles across. There were no large troop concen trations—only the small groups of men who handled the m obile guns and rocket launchers. Our size meant that we could be plainly seen by both si des, even though the ground was covered with a thick haze of smoke. Now began the major part of the operation and the part whose success we were unable to guarantee. It would have been easy enough to destroy all life within that area of a hundred square miles, and put a complete stop to the fighting. And yet none of us would have been able to do this. We had nothing but contempt for the men who were trying to kill one another, but we felt we had no right to kill them. The first thing was to immobilize the mobile rocket units. Within ten minutes of our appearance, a dozen of th em had tried firing rockets at us. The missiles were destroyed, and Reich’s group then destroyed each of the launching machines by simply crushing them out of shape. But there were probably a thousand or so large guns and rocket launchers on the battlefield; we had to make sure of each of these, too. We wanted to be able to concentrate fully on the major part of the task. It took us near ly an hour of groping around in the smoke to locate every gun and launching site, and to destroy it. Our first appearance had caused a pa nic. But when no death-rays came from us, it subsided. The operation of immobilizing the guns was unspectacular; only those in actual contact with them noticed it. So after a while, everyone regarded us with curiosity rather than fear. Our mental ‘feelers’ were aware of this, and we actively encouraged the mood. It was a strange feeling. We all sat there, in complete silence. The only sound was the wind. All firing from belo w us had stopped. We were aware of being watched by a million men massed in two great armies. I was even aware of the presence of the parasites in many of them, for the response that came from the ‘zombis’ was cold and incu rious, unlike the human response. * * * At this point, Fleishman touched the butt on that controlled th e photon sails, and they slowly opened. It must have been an impressive sight—these immense silver wings that first of all slid out of the back of the ship, then slowly expanded until they were four times bigger than the ship, with a total area of eight square miles. We now looked like a giant insect with a black body, and shiny but almost transparent wings."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" It must be understood that we were in close contact with our ‘audience’, as close and intimate as any such contact be tween an actor and his audience in a theatre. Consequently we were able to re gister the reaction of astonishment that contained only an element of fear. As we began to move very slowly across the sky, I became aware of a change in the quality of the response. They were watching this great silver object with fascination, but no longer with in telligent curiosity. Their active attention was flagging—which is hard ly surprising, since no one had taken their eyes off us for over an hour. The sunlight on the photon sails was dazzling. For them, we looked like a gigantic and beautiful insect , too bright to watch with comfort, and yet too fascinating to lose sight of. The effect was exactly what we had supposed. The quality of the attention became flaccid and hypnotic as we moved very slowly, drifting across the sky, gradually dropping towards the ground. Th is slow, gentle movement was a considerable effort for Reich’s team, si nce the huge wing area meant that the ship was being constantly buffeted by wi nd, which would have sent it spinning if their vigilance relaxed for a moment. The other forty of us now linked in parallel. These watching minds were completely in our power, like a child fasc inated by a story. I also observed an interesting thing that I had always susp ected: all of these spectators were also telepathically linked together by their intere st in us. It explains why mobs can be so dangerous. An excited crowd builds up a certain telepathic force by a vibratory process, but in a clumsy a nd uncoordinated manner, so that it feels impelled to violent action to release the tension. The tension of this crowd was at our disposal. It was like one enormous mind opened to us. This mind was wholly concentrated on a great, insect-like object, that was now very close to the ground. They were hypnotized and completely open to suggestion. The central part of the operation wa s now in my hands. Their minds were like so many television screens, and I was the central transmitter. The consequence was that every one of them suddenly became aware that two huge doors were opening in the sides of the space ship. And then from these doors more than a thousand feet high stepped the moon aliens. The aliens were also more than a thousand feet high. They were also suggestive of insects, being green in colour, and possessed of long le gs like a grasshopper. Their faces were humanoid, with great beaky noses, and sma ll black eyes. They moved in a jerky way, as if unused to the earth’s gravity. Their feet were cl aws, like a bird’s. Then, in great leaps, the aliens moved across the ground towards the watching armies. I transmitted nightmare waves of panic, certainty of a horrible destruction. At the same time, I released the tension that held them all to the spot, watching helplessly. The result was a stampede away from us. The sense of panic was so unpleasant—almost indecent in its abject terror—that we broke telepathic contact with them, and left them to run. No one looked back. Thousands fell and were trampled to death; later figures showed that fifteen per"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" cent of them died in this way. The havoc could hardly have been increased even if the hostile aliens had been real. It was a highly unpleasant experien ce. For weeks afterwards, I kept remembering that panic; it returned like a bad taste in the mouth. But it was necessary. It certainly ended the wa r. From that moment on, Gwambe and Hazard were no longer leaders. They we re ignored, forgotten. The war was a dream from which everybody had awakened, a children’s game that had come to an end. Over the next three days, troops of the World Organization, acting in close co-operation with the president of the United States, were able to arrest thousands of the scattered armies, including Gwambe and Hazard. (The latter was shot while ‘attempting to escape’; Gwambe was confined in a lunatic asylum in Geneva, where he died a year later.) * * * It might be assumed that after this victory, we felt inclined to rest on our laurels. In fact, we felt nothing of the sort, for tw o reasons. The victory had been child’s play. I have related it in some detail here because of its historical interest, but as a piece of strategy it barely deserves tw o lines. Second, the rea lly interesting part of our task now lay ahead of us: to restore the world to some kind of sanity, and to consider measures for the fina l destruction of the parasites. There was nothing spectacular in the methods we adopted. We simply told people the truth. On the day after our ‘vic tory’, president Melville announced on television that the United States governmen t had every reason to believe that the ‘moon aliens’ were on their way out of our solar system, and that there was no longer any immediate danger to our planet . He added: ‘But in view of the constant danger of an extra-terrestrial attack, the United States urges the immediate formation of a Unified Worl d Government, armed with full powers for mobilizing a World Defence Force. ’ His proposal was immediately accepted by the United Nations. And then began th e great task which has been so ably documented by Wolfgang Reich in his book The Remaking of the World. Our most serious task, of course, was the destruction of the parasites. But we decided that this was not an immedi ate priority. The rotation of the moon had the effect of considerably diminishing their power by lessening the basic source of irritation. But there was another r eason for treating them as a secondary problem. I have said that, in a sense, the parasites were a ‘shadow’ of man’s cowardice and passivity. Their strength could increase in an atmosphere of defeat and panic, for it fed on human fear. In that case, the best way to combat them was to change the atmosphere to one of strength and purpose. And this we regarded as our major task during the next year. The first problem was to make the World Security Force really effec tive, to stamp out any sign of renewed activity on the part of the parasites. This meant that about twenty of our group had to apply themselves to problems of organization. Almost equally important was to make people understand that the pa rasites were a reality, against which"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" mankind had to maintain constant vigilance. And this in turn meant that we had to increase our group until it could be num bered in thousands, or even millions. For this reason only twenty of us (including Ebner and Fleishman) were assigned to the World Security Organization. The rest of us applied ourselves to the task of teaching. I must say a few words about this since, in fact, everything depended upon our success in this field. It was by no means an easy matter to pick candidates to be taught the techniques of ‘mind control’. It might seem that there was no problem at all; after all, I had taught myself; so had Reich and Fleishman. Surely we only had to announce the facts about the mind parasites to the human race, and men would teach themselves? This is only partly true. It happened, certainly. But this in itself raised a problem. The battle against the mind pa rasites requires a peculiarly tough and active intelligence; most people are so me ntally lazy that they can easily be outmanoeuvred by the parasites. They are now in a dangerous position, for they have a sense of false security, which the parasites are careful to foster. Here is certainly a case where a lit tle knowledge is dangerous. But the fact that about three-quarters of the human race immediately came to believe that they had achieved perfect ‘mind control’ set us a great problem. How were we to know which of these milli ons was worth our personal attention? It was not a problem we managed to solve immediately. We worked by hit and miss methods. We confined ourselves to highly intelligent people, particularly those who had ‘worked their way up,’ sin ce our most important requirement was courage and vitality. But there were a great many failures. When Reich and I had achieved our initial victories over the parasites, we had been stimulated by a sense of immediate danger. These new candidates were not, and many of them simply could not wake themselves up to a sense of urgency. I came to realize how much of ‘success’ in the world is due to a mere habit of aggressiveness and hard work, and not at all to intelligence. We had no time to waste on the failures. If we had used our telepathic powers to ‘wake them up’, it would only have increased their laziness. So they were quickly dismissed, and others admitted in their place. It soon struck us that ev en quite intelligent and serious people could suffer from mental laziness if they ha d acquired the habit in childhood. So we decided that our future candidates would ha ve to be caught as early as possible. For this reason, a number of us formed a separate group for testing the mental capacities of teenagers and children. This became the so -called ‘Behrman K-Test Group’ whose success exceeded all our e xpectations within two years—there were more than five hundred thousand mi nd control ‘adepts’ under the age of 21. At the end of a year, we knew we had won our battle to establish permanent world peace. We could now turn our attention back to the moon. This was by now necessary. The disturbing forces of the moon had become accustomed to its unusual motion, and we re re-focused on the earth. This was exactly what I had expected to happe n; the rotation of the moon was only a temporary measure."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" Without consulting anyone about it, a group of five hundred of us decided that the moon would have to be detached from earth’s gravitational field. We commenced work on this operation in Ja nuary, 1999—the last New Year’s Day of the old century. It was largely an engineering problem. It meant exerting a constant pressure on the moon for a very long period, and never relaxing this pressure. The operation had to be carried out very slowly. The moon’s density is very low compared with that of the earth; it is little more than an enormous cinder. In its long life it has also b een struck by innumerable meteors and comets, some of them very large indeed, so that it had been flawed through and through, like a lump of cracked glass. This meant that there was danger of its flying apart if we exerted any sudden pr essure; in which case, the earth would become surrounded by a ring of lunar astero ids, and we would be no better off. * * * Our intention was not simply to shield earth from the moon’s emanations. There was also the desire to do something about the life trapped in the satellite. We decided that the moon must be pushed in to the sun, where its bodiless inhabitants might once again be free. Four groups of a hundred and twenty-fiv e of us spaced ourselves out in the northern hemisphere, and commenced the wo rk of pushing the moon gently into outer space. What this meant in effect was increasing its speed of revolution around the earth, imparting to it more ener gy. This in turn w ould mean that the moon would move further from the eart h. (The moon was once much farther from the earth than it was in the twentieth century, but as it lost energy it tended to fall closer.) Over the course of the year 1999, we increased the moon’s speed of revolution from 28 days to 14. This was not a difficult task; by this time, I already knew enough about the secrets of the mind and its relation to the material universe to have been capable of doing it alone. It was now a million miles away from the earth, which meant that its sp eed of orbit had been multiplied by ten. We calculated that this speed would have to be doubled (to forty thousand miles an hour) before the moon would ‘escape’. It would then be drawn automatically towards the sun. This finally happened on February 22nd of the year 2000. The earth lost its moon, to the accompaniment of violent protests from sentimentalists, which we ignored. We ha d made one slight miscalculation; three months later, when crossing the orbit of Mercury, the moon was caught in the planet’s gravitational field. But since the mass of Mercury is approximately the same as that of the moon, there was no question of the moon becoming its satellite. Mercury was pulled seven milli on miles closer to the sun; the moon finally fell into orbit around the sun at an average distance of nineteen million miles. At this distance, the surface temperature is high enough to keep the rocks in a perpetually molten state. The moon’s ‘l ife’ has at least b een granted a certain degree of freedom."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" There is a point at which I have to stop; not because there is no more to say, but because what remains to be said is too difficult to express in this context. To the average human being of today, it must seem that we ‘initiates’ have achieved the status of gods. In a sens e, we have—compared with the human beings of the twentieth centu ry. In another sense, we are as far from that goal as ever. We are no longer limited by ignorance and lack of purpose; but our ignorance is still enormous. The road we have to travel still stretches into the distance. It is impossible for me to e xplain the nature of the problems that confront us. If human beings were cap able of understanding, there would be no need to explain. I do not know whether to regard myself as fortunate or unfortunate. I am fortunate in having been the spearhead of th is great movement in human evolution. I now understand what remains to be done . I am unfortunate in the sense of having lost contact with the rest of the human race with a few important exceptions. Man is lazy by natu re, and laziness is by no means to be condemned. It means he dislikes inconve nience, and he has created civilization to escape inconvenience; so his laziness has been an important factor in his evolution. But this also means that he prefers to evolve at his own slow and deliberate rate. The battle against the mind parasites has geared me to a faster rate of evolution: it has made me impatie nt to move on. I cannot be contented to know that the endless realms of mind now lie open for man’s exploration; this does not seem enough. There are too many que stions unanswered. It is true that man can no longer be separated from his sense of evolutionary purpose, and it now seems likely that men will live for centuries instead of dying out of boredom and defeat at the age of eight y. But we still do not know what happens when a man dies, or when existence is created from non-existence. We know there is a benevolent principle of purpos e in the universe, but we still do not know whether this principle is the ultimat e Creator of the Bible, or whether it depends upon some still deeper source. The mystery of time remains untouched; so does the fundamental question asked by Heidegger: Why is there existence rather than non-existence? The answer may lie in a completely different dimension, as different from the world of mind as mind is different from the world of space and time... * * * We have chosen to concl ude the account at this poin t, with a section from Austin’s unpublished journals, because it seems to the editor that these passages offer a possible solution to the mystery of the Pallas. So many words have been devoted to th is ‘Marie Celeste of space’ that the facts have tended to become blurred. Th e following extract from Captain James Ramsay’s Autobiography sets out the known facts clearly. * * * "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" In January of the year 2007, the governm ent of the United States announced that it had placed its space vehicl e Pallas, the largest spac e craft yet built, at the disposal of an expedition that was to be led by professors Reich and Austin. Their announced purpose was an archaeological expedition to the planet Pluto, in the hope of uncovering traces of vanished civilizations; two days before the expedition’s departure, an article by Horace Kimmell in World Press News stated that the true purpose of the expe dition was to discover whether Pluto could be the base of the immense space ships that had been reported in the upper atmosphere... This was categorica lly denied by professor Austin. The Pallas, with a crew of 2,000, all car efully chosen by th e leaders of the expedition (and including, incidentally, all but seven members of the earlier expedition of 1997), set out from Was hington on February 2nd, 2007, and was last contacted shortly befo re midnight on that day, when Professor Austin’s voice announced that the ship had covered about a million miles. After this, all attempts to establish contact with the Pallas failed... Exactly ten years later, on February 10, 2017, an expedition headed by myself set out with the specific purpose of discovering traces of the Pallas. There were three space craft, the Centaur, the C lio and the Leicester. Pluto was reached on January 12th, 2018. A month later, after four circuits of the planet, we prepared to return to earth. It was then that the Clio picked up the distinctive radio signals of the Pall as... It was finally locate d on March 2, 2018, floating about two million miles from Pluto. The li ghts of this enormous ship were all burning, and its freedom from external damage gave us reason to hope that some of its crew might have survived. Ho wever, when there was no response to signals, I agreed that this was unlikely, and ordered lieutenant Firmin to cut through the ship’s emergency lock. A party led by myself then entered the Pallas, and found it completely deserted. Ther e was no sign of violence, and the condition of the personal belong ings of the crew seemed to indicate that they had not expected to evacuate the ship. The log of the Pallas had been filled in up to June 9, 2007, and showed that the ship had spent some time on Pluto, and intended to make its way to Neptune wh en Pluto’s perihelion corresponded to Neptune’s aphelion. The ship’s automatic recording instruments had continued to function normally since that date, but indicated that the Pallas had been floating freely in space. There was no indication that the ship had been approached by any foreign body larger than a fifty pound meteor, which had been automatically repelled. They also indicated that the doors of the Pallas had not been opened since it left Pluto. A theory put forward by the Clio’s chief physician, to the effect that the crew of the Pallas had been spontaneously atomized by some exploding source of co smic rays that would affect only organic matter, was disproved by the evidence of a Dunbar Assimilator. The engines of the Pallas had been switched off normally at 9:30 P.M. on June 9th, and the ship had been brought to a halt. The engines still proved to be in perfect working condition when tested by us."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" The Pallas was brought back to earth, piloted by Lieutenant Firmin, and arrived on December 10, 2018. Subsequent investigations did nothing to clear up the mystery, and later expeditions to Pluto and Neptune failed to produce new evidence. * * * The view of the present editor, as I ha ve made clear elsewhere, is that the disappearance of the Pallas was planned, and that when the space craft set out from earth in February 2007 every man a board knew that he would never return. No other theory fits the facts. There is no evidence whatever that the Pallas was the victim of a surprise a ttack, and that its instruments were somehow re-set to destroy the evidence. Neither is there any evidence to indicate that the crew of the Pallas intended to build a new civili zation on another planet. There were only three women on board. The number would su rely have been higher if any such plan had been contemplated? In my own view, the pres ent edition of The Mind Parasites offers definite clues about what became of the Pallas. The passage on page 271 and 272 dealing with the ‘universal police’, drawn from Austin’s unpublished papers, seems to us the most important of these. He says: ‘The nearest of these receivers was situated only about four thousand million miles away, a cruising ship from a planet in the Proxima Centauri system’. In November, 1997, at the time this refers to, Pluto was almost at its aphelion distance from the sun (4,567 million miles). It is possible therefore that the ‘receiver’ Austin speaks of was somewhere near Pluto—although of course, it could have b een in any other direction. Could the ‘universal police’ from Proxima Centauri have had some sort of a base on Pluto? Again, where did Kimmel gain access to the information that the real purpose of the expedition was to see whether Pluto could be the base of the saucer-like space ships that had been seen by so many people in the early years of this century? Kimmel died in a rocket plane accident two m onths after the Pallas set out for Pluto, and never revealed the s ource of the rumour. But he was known as an honest and level-headed journalist w ho stuck close to the facts. It seems unlikely that he simply invented the story. Finally, we have Austin’s own words, written only a month before that final expedition, stating that he ‘had lost contact with the rest of the human race’, and that the battle against the parasite s had ‘geared him to a faster rate of evolution’. In the light of the passage about the ‘univers al police’, could anything be more natural than that Austin should plan to leave earth and join them? But above all, what could be stranger th an the brevity of Austin’s reference to the ‘space police’? This is surely a matter on which one might have expected him to spend several pages. Some clue as to his reason for this silence is given in a manuscript of Dagobert Ferris, another me mber of that original expedition, and author of Towards a Psychology of the Go lden Age. Ferris also vanished on the"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" Pallas, but he left behind an account of a conversation that took place between himself and professor Reich after they had become aware of the existence of these ‘space police’. In part, it runs as follows: ‘We speculated about the appearance of these Beings. Were they the same as ourselves, with arms and legs? Or w ould they resemble some strange animal or fish—perhaps an octopus? Would they simply take over the government of the earth and restore peace, or would they take stern repressive measures against people like Hazard and Gwambe?’ [This passa ge in itself is strange enough. Why should he assume that the ‘police’ woul d be taking over the earth? Had Austin actually spoken to them about this possibility? And had it b een finally decided that Austin and his associates could handle the Gwambe crisis?] * * * ‘I felt happy at this prosp ect of a new “government” fo r the earth. Ever since the “death of God” in the eighteenth century, man has had a feeling of being alone in an empty universe, the feeling that it is no use looking to the heavens for guidance. He is like a child who has wakened up one morning to be told that his father is dead and that he must now take over the positi on as head of the family. This feeling of fatherlessness is surely one of the greatest psychological shocks that anyone can suffer. We can all remember that feeling we had at school, where hard work brought immediate reward s, prizes at the end of term, praise from the headmaster, favours from the prefects. Then you leave school and there is no one “above” you any more. You are out on your own. (I must admit that I was tempted to join the army when I left school, merely to have that feeling of “belonging” to a group again.) And you get a strange feeling of emptiness, of the meaninglessness of anything you do. Surely this is what lies behind the “moral bankruptcy” of the twentieth century. ‘And now all this was over. There we re greater powers than man, powers that we could look up to. Life would be really meaningful again, the emptiness would be filled... The human race could go back to school. And why not, since it was largely composed of schoolboys? ‘Reich disagreed with me. He asked: “Don’t you think that’s our job?” ‘I said: “No, I’d rather learn than teach.” ‘At this point, Austin interrupted w ith the remark: “I agree with Reich. Nothing could be more dangerous for th e human race than to believe that its affairs had fallen into the hands of supermen.”’ For my own part, I believe that this is the reason why Austin refused help from the ‘space police’. I believe it is al so the reason why he decided that a time had come when he himself should vanish— vanish in such a way that the human race could never be certain of his death. And since it seems certain that no further evidence will ever be forthcoming, we have no alternative than to keep an open mind on the subject.
