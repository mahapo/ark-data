I replied without hesitation, \"Beyond the Occult,\" firstpublished in 1988. It unites two main currents in my thinking: the\"existentialist\" ideas developed in The Outsider, and the ideas that developedfrom my study of \"the occult.\" Beyond the Occult is my most important synthesis.Oddly enough, I had no desire to write it. It came about because I wasapproached by an old friend who had been the editor of many of my earlybooks-among them, The Space Vampires and A Criminal History of Mankind. He wasnow working for another publisher and wanted to commission another \"occult\" bookfrom me. I was anxious to oblige, but had no desire to write another book aboutthe occult. Finally, I allowed myself to be persuaded. In retrospect, I havenever been so satisfied with any decision I have ever made.My first book, The Outsider, appeared in 1956, and brought me overnightnotoriety that I found astonishing and exhausting. Since the ideas of TheOutsider play such an important part in Beyond the Occult, I must begin bytrying to explain them.Ever since childhood, I have been baffled by a strange phenomenon: how can wewant something badly and then feel bored almost as soon as we get it? I hadnoticed it particularly at Christmas time. For months before Christmas Day, Iwould look forward to owning some long-coveted toy, yet a few hours afterreceiving it, I was already beginning to take it for granted and even to find itslightly disappointing. I noticed the same thing about school holidays-howeagerly I would look forward to them during the school term, and how easily Ibecame bored with them.THE LIMITLESS REALMI glimpsed the solution to this problem when I was still a thirteen-year-oldschoolboy. One day, at the beginning of the six-week long August holiday, I wentto a church bazaar and bought for a few pence some volumes of an encyclopediacalled Practical Knowledge for All. It contained courses on every imaginablesubject, from accountancy, aeronautics, astronomy, biology, botany, andchemistry to philosophy and zoology. I had been fascinated by astronomy andchemistry since the age of ten, and now I conceived the preposterous idea oftrying to summarize all the scientific knowledge of the world in one notebook. Igave it the grandiose title of A Manual of General Science, and wrote steadilythroughout that August holiday, filling four notebooks with my round schoolboyhandwriting.And I noticed that I never became bored. Learning and writing about geology,biology, and philosophy kept me happier than I had ever been in my life. And Icontinued writing the book over Christmas, when I began the seventhvolume-devoted to mathematics. All the time I was writing this book, I had analmost drunken sensation of the sheer immensity of the world of ideas, whichseemed to stretch, like some marvellous unknown country, to a limitless horizon.Every day, when I began writing, I felt like a traveller preparing to discovernew lakes and forests and mountain ranges. I felt sorry for the other boys atschool, who were ignorant of this magical kingdom where I spent my evenings andweekends.I had learned a basic lesson: that the secret of avoiding boredom is to have astrong sense of purpose. Unfortunately, when I had finished the book, theproblem of boredom returned, for I had no idea what to do next. I spent one longschool holiday trying to read all the plays of Shakespeare and his majorcontemporaries: Marlowe, Jonson, Middleton, and the rest. During anotherholiday, I read all the works of the major Russian writers: Aksakov, Pushkin,Gogol, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Tchekov. During yet another, I studied thehistory of art, and discovered Van Gogh and Cezanne. Yet, because I was merelyreading and not writing about them, even this left me bored and dissatisfied.When I was sixteen, however, I came upon another important clue. It was soonafter the war, and a British publisher had started to reissue the novels ofDostoevsky. I bought Crime and Punishment with my pocket money. In theTranslator's Preface, I read Dostoevsky's letter to his brother Mihaildescribing how he-and other condemned revolutionaries-were taken out on theSemyonovsky Square to be shot:They barked orders over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts wornby prisoners condemned to execution. Being third in the row, I concluded I hadonly four minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones, and Icontrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, to bid themfarewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tatoo, and we were unbound, brought back tothe scaffold and informed that his Majesty had spared our lives.One of his fellow prisoners went insane.It struck me that if Dostoevsky had been offered his pardon on condition that hepromised never to be bored for the rest of his life, he would have acceptedgladly and been quite certain that it should be possible-indeed, that it shouldbe easy. And it seemed for me he would obviously be correct. Surely, someone whohad been through such a crisis would only have to remember being in front of thefiring-squad in order to be ecstatically happy.A CAUSE FOR REJOICINGIn fact, it was this episode-and the years in Siberia that followed-that turnedDostoevsky into a great writer. Before he was arrested, he was a good but minorwriter-in the tradition of Dickens and Gogol. But, as a human being, he wastouchy and self-obsessed to the point of paranoia. His arrest and longimprisonment in Siberia made him aware that even to be alive is a cause forrejoicing. The result of this new insight is expressed in a passage in Crime andPunishment where the hero is afraid he may be executed for the murder of an oldwoman. He thinks: \"If I had to stand on a narrow ledge for ever and ever, ineternal darkness and tempest, I would still rather do that than die at once.\" Hehad seen that \"life failure\"-to be bored, miserable, tortured by guilt-is a formof childish spoiltness.In my mid-teens, my problem was not simply boredom with my working-classexistence (My father was a boot and shoe worker who earned about Â£3 a week.), itwas a longing to escape from it and to retreat into that magical world of themind that I had discovered when writing the Manual of General Science. This wasintensified by my discovery-through Practical Knowledge for All-of the realm ofEnglish poetry. I left school when I was sixteen, and for a few months worked ina factory while I prepared to take the mathematics exam a second time. Factorywork made me so miserable that I spent my evenings and weekends readingpoetry-all kinds of poetry, from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales to Eliot's WasteLand. I quickly discovered that half an hour immersed in the world of Keats orShelley or Wordsworth would turn my rage and despair into a gentle melancholy,which slowly transformed into a sense of happiness and optimism, as if I wasfloating above the world, looking down on it like a bird. When, in the writingsof Richard Wagner, I later came across the phrase: \"art that makes life seemlike a game, and withdraws us from the common fate,\" I understood instantly whathe meant.The only problem with this state of mind-the bird's eye view-was that it made ittwice as difficult to go back to work the following morning and accept theworm's eye view of boredom and triviality. Years later, when I read ThomasMann's novel, The Buddenbrooks, I recognized my own problem in the episode whereyoung Hanno Buddenbrook goes to the opera to see Wagner's Lohengrin, and is sotransported into ecstasy that he feels he is walking on clouds. But when he hasto get up in the freezing dawn and make his way to school through the dark, icystreets, his despair is twice as deep because he has experienced ecstasy thenight before.It then seemed to me the problem of human existence can be expressed verysimply. At long intervals, we experience moments of strength and happiness inwhich we feel that we have the power to change the world and our lives. But suchmoments are brief. For most of the time, we experience the sense of beingvictims of circumstance, like dead leaves carried along by a river, with noability to choose our course. And, when circumstances become especiallydifficult, it is easy to imagine that fate will afflict us with a series ofmisfortunes, like Job, that will destroy all our security and leave uscompletely helpless.BEING AND BECOMINGAs I read my favorite writers-Plato, Hoffman, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Eliot-orlistened to the music of Beethoven, or looked at the paintings of Van Gogh, itseemed to me that all shared an awareness of this problem. Plato said that theuniverse is divided into a world of being and a world of becoming. The world of\"becoming\" is this everyday world of matter, of endless change, in which we aretrapped. The world of \"being\" is the world of intellect and ideas, the world oftruth and values that lies hidden behind the facade of the material world. As heprepares to commit suicide, Socrates declares that the philosopher spends hislife trying to live in a world of true being, and, therefore, that he shouldwelcome death which finally frees him from the distractions of the world of mere\"becoming.\"This, I realized, was why so many romantics were fascinated with death. Yet Istill found the idea of death stupid and repellent. It was an attempt to escapefrom reality. And the moments of ecstasy, of \"bird's eye vision,\" seemed topromise that life could be lived on the level of continuous joy and affirmation.When, in my late teens, I began to write a novel, it was inevitable that itshould be about this problem of the bird's eye view and the worm's eye view. Thehero of Ritual in the Dark is a young man who has spent years working in boringjobs, and whose strongest desire is to have the freedom to read and think andlisten to music. Then he receives a small legacy which enables him to rent acheap room and spend his days in libraries and art galleries. And he finds thatthis kind of freedom is curiously boring. Then he becomes accidentally involvedwith a man he suspects of being a murderer, and feels ashamed that, because henow has something to maintain his \"interest,\" he no longer feels bored. He isashamed, because it has taken an external stimulus to renew his sense of beingfully alive, when he feels that he ought to be able to do it himself. Surely heought to wake up every morning with a feeling of immense gratitude for nothaving to go to an office? What is wrong with the human mind that makes it soincapable of freedom?It was while I was writing this novel that I decided to break off and try toexpress some of its basic ideas in a volume of philosophy. Inevitably, this bookwas about \"Outsiders,\" people who felt a longing for some more purposeful formof existence, and who felt trapped and suffocated in the triviality of everydaylife. It was a book about \"moments of vision\" and about the periods of boredom,frustration, and misery in which these moments are lost. It was about men likeNietzsche, Dostoevsky, Van Gogh, T.E. Lawrence and William Blake, who have clearglimpses of a more powerful and meaningful way of living, yet who findthemselves on the brink of suicide or insanity because of the frustration oftheir everyday lives. The problem of the Outsider is summarized in the life ofVincent Van Gogh. His painting Starry Night is full of mystical vitality; yetVan Gogh committed suicide and left a note that read: \"Misery will never end.\"Here, then, is the vital question: Was the tragedy of Nietzsche and Van Goghinevitable, or should there be some way in which human beings can live on ahigher level of intensity?TRADITION OF DEFEATMy own conclusion was that tragedy was not inevitable. Many Outsiders causedtheir downfall through self-pity. In other words, they allowed themselves tobecome weak. Why? Because they were inclined to feel that life is futile andmeaningless-or, at least, that it is so difficult that it is not worth theeffort. In the twentieth century, this feeling has been expressed most clearlyin the works of Samuel Beckett. It is recorded that when he was a young man, hestayed in bed all day because he could see no reason to get up. And his worksare part of a long tradition of \"defeatism\" that goes back to Ecclesiastes, withhis \"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity,\" and \"There is nothing new under thesun.\" This is the feeling that haunts so many Outsiders, particularly when theybecome tired and discouraged. It was expressed with a certain gloomy power inthe philosophy of Schopenhauer. I labelled this sense of boredom and futility\"the Ecclesiastes effect.\"This sense of meaninglessness was also expressed by a Greek philosopher who diedfifty years before Plato was born. Heraclitus argued that the world of\"becoming\" is the only reality. Everything changes constantly. Permanence is anillusion of the senses. Therefore man can make no real \"mark\" on the world, forany \"mark\" we make vanishes again as quickly as the tide washes away wordswritten in sand. This view also implies, of course, that there is no such thingas good or evil, and that \"values\" are an illusion.This is certainly the feeling we get when we are exhausted with effort, and lifeseems to be an endless vista of problems and complications. Yet the truth isthat it is impossible to be a genuine follower of Heraclitus. According toHeraclitus, death is inevitable, and it is therefore no use making any efforts.Yet if Heraclitus had fallen into a river, he would have struggled to get outagain. And if someone had put a knife to his throat and asked: \"Shall I cut yourwindpipe and save you the trouble of living?\" he would have shouted: \"No!\"Still, Heraclitus has undoubtedly put his finger on our most basic problem: thateverything is soon undone by time. In The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus writes:\"Rising, streetcar, four hours of work, meal, sleep, and Monday, Tuesday,Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, according to the same rhythm But oneday, the \"why\" arises, and everything begins in that weariness tinged withamazement.\" Camus calls this sudden revelation \"the Absurd,\" a word he borrowedfrom his friend Sartre, who also coined a word for man's reaction to the Absurd:\"nausea.\" Nausea is the recognition that we are \"unnecessary\" and that the worldof matter that surrounds us is the only reality. \"Meaning\" is an illusion.A LITTLE MORE LIKE GODSYet Heraclitus, Sartre, and Camus contradicted themselves. Sartre recorded thathe had never felt so free as when he was working for the French Resistance andwas likely to be arrested and shot at any moment. And, on the evening before hisexecution, the hero of Camus's novel, The Stranger, is overwhelmed by a feelingof happiness and affirmation that sounds like Van Gogh's starry night. Hewrites: \"I had been happy, and I was happy still.\"And this, obviously, brings us back to Dostoevsky facing the firing squad. Hesuddenly knows that life is not pointless and meaninglessness. And we all knowthe same thing whenever we are faced with any serious problem or crisis. We knowthat the statement, \"Life is meaningless,\" or \"Nothing is worth doing,\" is theself-indulgence of a philosopher who is both lazy and weak.But moments of crisis are not the only moments in which we recognize that thephilosophy of Heraclitus and Samuel Beckett is nonsense. The same thing happensin all moments of sudden happiness-the feeling we experience on a spring morningor when setting out on holiday. In Seven Pillars of Wisdom, T.E. Lawrencedescribes such an experience:We started on one of those clear dawns that wake up the senses with the sun,while the intellect, tired of the thinking of the night, was yet abed. For anhour or two, on such a morning, the sounds, scents, and colors of the worldstruck man individually and directly, not filtered through or made typical bythought: they seemed to exist sufficiently by themselves, and the lack of designand carefulness in creation no longer irritated.This is the basic poetic vision, the sheer affirmation experienced by Wordsworthand Shelley and William Blake. And Lawrence has also identified the problem: the\"tired intellect\" which questions everything. Elsewhere he referred to it as his\"thought-riddled nature.\"It is the \"thought-riddled nature\" that causes Outsiders to see life asmeaningless. They are in a position of someone who wears dark glasses andcomplains that the world is dark.But, if it is thought that has caused this problem, surely thought is alsocapable of identifying and overcoming it.Let me again define the problem. It is the feeling that \"nothing is worthdoing,\" that life is so complicated, and the world is in such a state of endlessflux that all our actions our futile. It is the feeling that we cannot do.Yet this feeling vanishes-and is seen to be an illusion-every time we experience\"the spring morning feeling\" described by T.E. Lawrence. Optimism gives us thecertainty that action is worthwhile and that the use of the intellect can bringfreedom. We only have to look around us to see the truth of this assertion. Weare living in a world that has been completely transformed in the course oflittle more than a century by science and optimism. In fact, since the days ofthe cave man, human effort and optimism have steadily transformed the world.Individual men have died in failure and misery, yet the efforts of the humanrace have altered our lives until we are no longer mere animals, living andreproducing and dying. We are slowly learning to become something a little morelike gods.This, then, is the basic philosophy I reached after The Outsider. Dr Johnsononce said: \"When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrateshis mind wonderfully.\" The pessimism of Heraclitus and Samuel Beckett isbasically due to a lack of concentration. Our sense of futility, the feelingthat life is just one damned thing after another,\" is an illusion due tofatigue.But how can we rescue ourselves from this feeling? First of all, we have tostudy it and understand it, as I tried to understand it in The Outsider. Ourmost important ally in this battle is the imagination. If you can imagine thefeelings of Dostoevsky as he stood in front of the firing squad, then you arealready learning to overcome the petty annoyances and childish weaknesses thatmake most people feel unhappy. The truth is that we have no right to be unhappy.It is an insult to the spirit of life. A man who is dying of AIDS knows that, ifonly he could be cured, he would live his life on a far higher level of purposeand optimism.In the first part of this article (Magical Blend, October 1997), Englishphilosopher and writer Colin Wilson examined the curious human interaction ofdesire and malaise that first sends us scrambling to acquire something and thenleaves us bored as soon as we get it. Noting that this same dynamic ofteninterferes with our highest aspirations, Wilson reminds us that talented\"Outsiders\" like Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Van Gogh, T.E. Lawrence, and WilliamBlake had clear glimpses of a more powerful and meaningful way of living, yetfound themselves on the brink of suicide or insanity because of the frustrationof their everyday lives.Noting that T.E. Lawrence found inspiration in the \"clear dawn\" while \"theintellect [is] yet abed,\" Wilson wrestles with the intellect's role in creatingmisery or happiness. The intellect can free us, he says, but achieving spiritualinsight and serenity often requires a shock, as was the case with Dostoevsky,whose genius flourished only after narrowly escaping being shot by a firingsquad. It is at such times of crisis, says Wilson, that desire and intellectfocus in the realization \"that we have no right to be unhappy. It is an insultto the spirit of life.\"THE FUTURE PRESENTUntil the late 1960s, I had considered myself a kind of \"existentialistphilosopher,\" who was attempting to rescue existentialism from the pessimism ofSartre, Camus, and Heidegger. But at this point, I came upon a new subject ofstudy that turned my thoughts in an entirely different direction. An Americanpublisher asked me if I would be interested in writing a book about \"theoccult.\" It was not a subject that interested me greatly. As a child, I had beenfascinated by \"spiritualism\" and the question of whether there is life afterdeath. But as soon as I began to study chemistry, physics, and astronomy, thisinterest seemed to evaporate like a dream.After the request from the publisher, I began to give the matter some newthought. I also began to ask people of my acquaintance whether they had ever hadany \"paranormal\" experiences, and I was surprised by the number who said yes.One friend was a concert pianist called Mark Bredin. He told me how he had beenreturning, very late at night, from a concert in central London, and travellingin a taxi along the Bayswater Road. Suddenly, he knew with absolute certaintythat, at the next traffic light, a taxi would try to \"jump\" the light, and wouldhit them sideways. He wondered if he ought to warn his driver, but felt that hemight be regarded as slightly mad. And at the next traffic light, a taxi triedto \"beat\" the light at Queensway and hit them sideways.It seemed to me that there was a certain parallel between Mark's experience andthat of T.E. Lawrence in the early dawn. Both had been tired, and the\"intellect\" was therefore \"asleep.\" But what peculiar power could make Markaware of something that would happen in the future? I had already recognizedthat the mind possesses the power to escape from pessimism and defeat bymeditating on a firing squad. But this was something altogether more strange andunusual.Another friend, the historian A. L. Rowse, told me how he had been leaning outof a window in Oxford. The window frame was very heavy, and it occurred to himthat, if it fell, it might easily kill him. Since he was in a bad mood, hethought: \"Let the damn thing fall!\" A few moments later, just after he hadwithdrawn his head, the window fell.Rowse also told me how, one quiet afternoon, he had a premonition that if hewent into the college library, he would find two young men embracing. He crossedtwo quadrangles and walked into the library-and saw two young men embracing.Even stranger was the experience described to me by a middle-aged friend namedKay Lunnis, who spent several days a week in our house, helping to look afterour children. Kay described how once she had been seriously ill, and had feltherself rise up above her body so she could look down on it; then she haddescended and re-entered her body.A few years earlier I would have at least considered the possibility that thiswas some kind of hallucination due to fever. But in gathering material for TheOccult, I had come across far too many cases of out-of-the-body experiences todoubt that it was possible. Another friend, Lyall Watson, had described how,when his vehicle overturned in Canada, he suddenly found himself hovering abovethe bus, and looking at the head and shoulders of a boy who had been hurledhalfway through the canvas roof. It occurred to him that if the bus rolled anyfurther, the boy would be crushed. A few minutes later, he recoveredconsciousness in the driver's seat, got out of the vehicle, and rescued the boy,who was in exactly the position he had seen a few moments earlier.Now if these friends were telling the truth-and I was strongly inclined tobelieve that they were-then human beings possess at least two \"powers\" that wereunsuspected by Heraclitus, Schopenhauer and Samuel Beckett: the power to \"see\"the future, and the power to \"leave the body.\"Now, quite clearly, if this was true, then it should be taken into account inany attempt to create a philosophy of human existence. Such a philosophy demandsthat we try to understand what man is. And if, in certain moments, man can seeinto the future, then he is certainly more than Heraclitus assumed.MAN-A USELESS PASSION?Inevitably, I also had to reconsider the question of life after death. Anotherfriend, Professor G. Wilson Knight, was a convinced spiritualist, and told me acircumstantial story that seemed to prove beyond all doubt that his mother hadsurvived death. Now Dostoevsky had once remarked that if there is such a thingas life after death, it would be the most important thing that human beingscould possibly know. And Dostoevsky was the most profound of the \"existential\"philosophers. In The Brothers Karamazov, Ivan Karamazov argues that the world isso full of suffering that no religion can justify it; Ivan says that he wants to\"give God back his entrance ticket.\" Here he is expressing the philosophy ofHeraclitus and Ecclesiastes and Sartre-that in a world dominated by brutematter, \"man is a useless passion\" who is doomed to defeat. Yet Dostoevskyrecognized that if there is life after death, this fact would change everything.This, then, is why I regarded the evidence of the paranormal as so important.According to modern Western philosophy, it is the philosopher's duty to \"doubteverything\" until he has achieved some area of ultimate certainty-no matter howsmall-on which he can take his stand. Unfortunately this method has failed toyield any kind of certainty. It led Bishop Berkeley to doubt the existence ofthe material world and David Hume to doubt cause and effect, and even theexistence of the \"self.\" It led Sartre to conclude that \"it is meaningless thatwe live and meaningless that we die,\" and Camus to regard life as \"absurd.\" Themost fashionable of contemporary French philosophers, Jacques Derrida, is quitesimply a descendant of Heraclitus, who believes that there is no such thing as\"underlying meaning\" (which he calls \"presence\") in the universe; the onlyreality is the endless flux of matter.When The Occult appeared in 1971, it soon became apparent that many people whohad regarded me as a kind of maverick existentialist now believed that I hadturned to more trivial topics and abandoned the rigor of my \"Outsider\" books. Tome, such a view was incomprehensible. It seemed obvious to me that if the\"paranormal\" was a reality-as I was increasingly convinced that it was-then anyphilosopher who refused to take it into account was merely closing his eyes.\"CREATED BY THE GAZE OF OTHERS\"To begin with, most modern philosophers seem united in denying that man has acentral \"self\" (or soul). The Scottish philosopher David Hume started thisrevolution in the eighteenth century when he declared that, \"when I enterintimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particularperception or other . . . I never catch myself at any time.\" Sartre declaredthat man has no \"self\"; what he thinks of as \"himself\" is really created by \"thegaze of others.\" And this is the position that has been accepted by Frenchphilosophers ever since. Derrida, who is celebrated for his theory of\"deconstruction,\" believes that the \"self\" is a delusion that has been createdby \"metaphysical\" philosophers, whom he rejects with contempt.Sartre's close ally Simone de Beauvoir, expressed the same notion when she wrote(in Pyrrhus and Cineas): \"I look at myself in vain in a mirror, tell myself myown story, I can never grasp myself as an entire object, I experience in myselfthe emptiness that is myself, I feel that I am not.\" In other words, man is apurely superficial creature; the sense of selfhood is like a mere reflection onthe surface of a pond. Sartre carried this view to its logical conclusion whenhe declared that there is no such thing as the \"unconscious mind.\"Yet as soon as we begin to study the paranormal, we immediately encounter theexistence of all kinds of powers that contradict Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.Far from being a mere reflection on the surface of a pond, man seems to be likean iceberg whose most important part is hidden below the surface. Of course,Freud and Jung have already told us about the \"unconscious\" (the word wasactually invented by Leibniz) but it would seem that even they underestimatedits powers. Even the anecdotes I have recounted above seem to indicate that thepart of the \"self\" hidden below the water-line possesses virtually magicalpowers.And of course-as Dostoevsky recognized-the ultimate contradiction of the viewthat we possess \"no self\" would be an actual proof of life after death, forwithout a self, there would be nothing to survive death. This ultimate proofeludes us; but the existence of other paranormal powers seems to leave us in nodoubt of the truth of the \"iceberg\" view of the human mind.Moreover, some of these powers that lie below the surface seem to \"contradict\"the scientific view of man. Science tells us that the future has not yethappened; therefore we can only guess what is going to happen. Yet when he wasdeeply relaxed, Mark Bredin had a clear premonition of what would happen whenhis taxi reached the traffic light.BEHIND THE PAVILIONRobert Graves, the friend to whom The Occult was dedicated, drew my attention toanother curious example of these unknown powers. It is described in one of hisautobiographical stories called The Abominable Mr. Gunn. In Graves's class atprep school there was a boy called F. F. Smilley, who was apparently amathematical prodigy, a \"lightning calculator.\" When the master (Mr. Gunn) hadgiven the boys a difficult mathematical problem, Smilley simply wrote down theanswer. He explained that he did not have to work it out, because \"it had justcome to him.\" Mr Gunn accused him of looking up the answer in the back of thebook. Smilley denied this, and pointed out that the answer at the back of thebook had two figures wrong. Mr Gunn regarded this as impertinence, and sentSmilley to the headmaster to be caned. After that, he bullied Smilley into doingproblems \"the normal way.\"In the same story, Graves records a curious anecdote about himself. One summerevening, as he was sitting behind the cricket pavilion (and presumably in adeeply relaxed state of mind, like T.E. Lawrence and Mark Bredin), he received\"a sudden celestial illumination . . . It occurred to me that I knew everything. . . I remember letting my mind range rapidly over all the familiar subjects ofknowledge; only to find that this was no foolish fancy. I did know everything.To be plain: though conscious of having come less than a third of the way alongthe path of formal education . . . I nevertheless held the key to truth in myhand, and could use it to open any lock or door. Mine was no religious orphilosophical theory, but a simple way of looking sideways at disorderly factsso as to make perfect sense of them.This, of course, is precisely what existentialism wants to do and precisely whatI am trying to do in this article: to \"look sideways\" at the disorderly facts ofhuman existence and try to find some way of making sense of them. Graves,apparently, did it when he was fifteen. He says that he tried out his insight\"on various obstinate locks\" and found that they all opened smoothly. Theinsight was still intact when he woke up the next day. But when he tried torecord it in the back of an exercise book, \"my mind went too fast for my pen.\"He had another try later, but the insight had vanished.It is worth looking a little more closely into this mystery. There are certainnumbers called \"primes,\" which cannot be divided by any other number withoutleaving a remainder-numbers like 3, 5, 7, and 11. Nine is not a prime because itcan be divided exactly. The actual number of primes is infinite, but if a numberis very large, there is no way of telling whether it is a prime or not-except bya long and painful process of dividing every small number into it. Yet aCanadian \"calculating prodigy\" named Zerah Colburn was asked whether a certainten digit number was a prime, and replied after a moment: \"No, it can be dividedby 641.\"There is no logical way of doing this. The psychiatrist Oliver Sacks hasdescribed a pair of subnormal twins in a New York mental hospital who amusethemselves by swapping twenty-four figure primes. Obviously the twins somehowrise into the air, like birds, over the whole number-field, and instantly seewhich number is a prime and which is not.I would suggest that the ability that enabled Mark Bredin to \"know\" that histaxi would be struck by another taxi is closely related to the ability of ZerahColburn and Sacks's twins, and that both are related to T.E. Lawrence's feelingon the morning when \"the senses awoke before the intellect.\"Now long before I became interested in the occult, I had been fascinated byanother example of the powers that lie \"below the iceberg.\" (I say \"below theiceberg\" rather than \"below the visible part of the iceberg\" because it hasalways seemed to me that man's hidden powers are located in the sea below theiceberg as much as in the iceberg itself.) As everyone knows, Proust's vastnovel A la recherche du temps perdu sprang from a single incident in hischildhood, just as Graves's theories in The White Goddess sprang from hisexperience behind the cricket pavilion. One day, feeling tired and depressed,Proust's hero is offered by his mother a small cake (called a madeleine) dippedin herb tea. As he tastes it he experiences an exquisite sensation of sheerhappiness. \"I had now ceased to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal.\" After takinganother bite, he recalls what has caused this feeling of power and happiness:the madeleine had revived memories of his childhood in a small country towncalled Combray, where his Aunt Leonie used to give him a taste of her ownmadeleine dipped in the same herb tea.GLIMPSES OF THE DEPTHSWhy should this make him feel so happy? Because it reminded him of the depthsbelow the iceberg. He had been feeling bored and depressed-in other words,superficial. Now he catches a glimpse of the depths of his own mind, and of itshidden powers. He also realizes that if only he could learn the \"trick\" ofbringing back this feeling, he would never be unhappy again. This is why he setsout to revive it by writing his enormous autobiographical novel. Yet thisdeliberate intellectual activity fails. When he catches other glimpses of thismagical feeling of power and strength, it is always by accident, when he isthinking of something else.In the tenth volume of his Study of History, Arnold Toynbee describes severaloccasions on which he also had these strange glimpses into the reality of thepast-not his own past, but that of history. On each of these occasions, heactually seemed to see the past, as if he had been transported by a timemachine. On one of these occasions, he seemed to see the battle of Pharsalus,which had taken place in 197 BC, and saw some horsemen-of whose identity he wasignorant-galloping away from the massacre. It seems clear from his descriptionthat he felt this was not \"imagination,\" but some kind of glimpse of the pastlike Mark Bredin's glimpse of the future. (In Beyond the Occult I cite manyother examples of more distant glimpses of the future which proved to beaccurate.)On a snowy day in Washington in 1966, thinking about this curious ability to\"make real\" other times and other places, I labelled it \"Faculty X.\" But FacultyX should not be regarded as some paranormal faculty. It is simply the oppositeof feeling \"mediocre, accidental, mortal,\" which all of us feel when we aretired and depressed, and which Sartre calls \"contingency.\" And whenever FacultyX awakens, it tells us that we are not contingent, not mediocre, accidental,mortal. Our powers are far greater than we realize.In The Occult, I had pointed out that animals seem to possess all kinds of\"paranormal\" powers. The wife of the Scottish poet Hugh McDiarmid told me thather dog knows when her husband will return from a long journey, and goes andsits at the end of their lane several days before he arrives. On one occasion,the dog knew he was going to return before he did-circumstances had caused himto make a sudden decision to return home.JUNGLE SENSITIVENESSIn his book Man Eaters of Kumaon, the tiger hunter Jim Corbett describes how hecame to develop a faculty which he called \"jungle sensitiveness,\" which told himwhen he was in danger. I argue that all our remote ancestors possessed such afaculty, and that we have gradually lost it because we do not need it. Yet manypeople have not lost it. The archaeologist Clarence Weiant described how theMontagnais Indians of eastern Canada are able to contact distant friends andrelatives by telepathy. When they wish to make contact, the Indians go into aremote hut in the forest, and build up the necessary psychic energy (\"mana\")through meditation. Then the relative would hear his voice-distance made nodifference.Now it is obvious that it is simpler to pick up the telephone when we want tocontact a distant relative. Yet this does not mean that picking up the telephoneis \"just as good\" as contacting him or her through clairaudience. The Indian whois able to call upon these faculties from the depths of his own mind has anunderstanding of nature, a sense of connection with the rest of the universe,and a deeper knowledge of himself, that the rest of us have lost.What has happened is obvious. Even towards the end of the nineteenth century,the English poet Matthew Arnold was mourning that Victorian man no longer hadaccess to \"Wordsworth's healing power,\" while Tennyson was complaining thatscience had destroyed faith and left man in an empty universe, trapped in hisown smallness. But the problem had started long before the nineteenthcentury-perhaps when Euclid systematized geometry and Archimedes rolled a weightdown an inclined plane. This kind of knowledge-which Graves called \"solarknowledge\"-gradually eclipsed man's \"lunar knowledge\" or his intuitive awarenessof the hidden part of the iceberg.This was the problem that I had discussed in the second volume of The Outsider(called in England Religion and the Rebel.) Now, in Beyond the Occult, Iattempted to bring together this philosophy of \"Outsiderism\" and the insights Ihad gained from the study of \"the occult.\"THE NEW SYNTHESISYet I began to write the book reluctantly, feeling that I was merelyregurgitating something I had already expressed in previous books. But I soonrealized I was creating a new synthesis. The problem of human beings is that itis possible to \"know\" something without really knowing it. The adult Proustthought he \"knew\" he was a child in Combray, but the madeleine taught him thatthis \"adult\" knowledge was superficial. I thought I knew the ideas I hadexpressed in books like The Outsider and The Occult. Writing about them againmade me realize that my knowledge of them was superficial. In order to reallyknow something we must meditate upon it until we have absorbed it into ourbeing. (I have to confess that even writing this article has once again made meaware of this truth.)Beyond the Occult is an attempt to draw together all the insights I havediscussed in this article, and many more-particularly the insights of those whohave had sudden \"mystical\" experiences. They all teach us the same thing: thatour \"ordinary\" consciousness of ourselves is superficial and deceptive. We areall like Simone de Beauvoir, looking in the mirror and \"feeling that we cannever grasp ourselves as an entire object.\"Here is a typical example of one of these experiences. A girl describes how,when she was sixteen, she set out to walk up a lane towards a wood. \"I was notfeeling particularly happy or sad, just ordinary.\" As she stood in a cornfieldlooking towards the wood, everything suddenly changed. \"Everything surroundingme was this bright, sparkling light, like sun on frosty snow, like a milliondiamonds, and there was no cornfield, no trees, no sky, this light waseverywhere . . . The feeling was indescribable, but I have never experiencedanything in the years that followed that can compare with that glorious moment;it was blissful, uplifting, I felt open-mouthed wonder. Then the tops of thetree became visible once again, then a piece of sky and gradually the light wasno more, and the cornfield was spread before me. I stood there for a long time,trying in vain to make it come back, but I only saw it once; but I know in myheart it is still there-and here-around us.\"The girl-who describes this in a book called Seeing the Invisible (whichconsists of letters about mysticism written to the Alister HardyFoundation)-obviously had an experience which, in some ways, resembled that ofProust. Something \"triggered\" this marvellous perception of sparkling light. Andshe remains convinced that \"it is still there\"-that our everyday consciousnesssomehow filters it out, just as if we were wearing a pair of dark glasses.It is, of course, deeply frustrating that we cannot learn how to contact thesedepths \"below the iceberg\" at will. Yet-as I have tried to show-it is not asdifficult as it sounds.The conclusion I have reached over the years are as follows. The romantics ofthe nineteenth century had many of these \"glimpses,\" because they knew how to\"relax.\" (The girl in the anecdote does not say so, but it is clear that she wasdeeply relaxed.) But because these romantics were inclined to weakness-likeSamuel Beckett most of them could see no reason for getting out of bed-theyfailed to grasp the most important clue: that such experiences bring a feelingof strength, and that the best way to achieve them is certainly not to indulgein weakness and self-pity. Abraham Maslow, who called such moments \"peakexperiences,\" discovered that his \"peakers\" were usually strong and healthypeople who coped well with their lives.SNOWBOUNDIn Beyond the Occult, I described an interesting example of how I succeeded inachieving \"higher consciousness\" for most of an afternoon in 1979.It was the New Year, and I had gone to a remote farmhouse in Devon to give alecture to a group of extra-mural students. During that evening it began tosnow, and by the following morning the snow was so thick that it would have beenimpossible to drive back home. I was forced to stay there another night. Thefollowing morning, the weather forecast announced more snow, and it was obviousthat I might be unable to leave for a week. I determined to try to escape, and agroup of us began to clear the snow in the farmyard with shovels. When thefarmyard was clear, each of us tried to drive our cars up the slope that led tothe gate; mine was the only car whose tires would grip the slippery surface.There was still half a mile of snow-covered farm track between the farmyard andthe main road. I would drive a few yards, then get out and help to shovel snow.At one point, I even risked driving straight across a field to avoid a long bendin the road. And finally, after several hours of hard work, I walked back to thefarmhouse to eat some lunch and collect my bags. Then I walked back to the maingate, and began the long drive back home.Yet even now it was impossible to relax my vigilance, because the narrow countryroads were covered in snow, and it was impossible to see the ditch on eitherside. It would have been easy to drive off the road and become stranded again,perhaps all night. So I sat forward in my seat, peering out of the windscreen,and focusing all my concentration.Several hours later, I arrived at the main road, where heavy traffic had turnedthe snow into muddy slush, and it was possible to relax and drive normallyagain. And it was now that I realized that I was full of a sense of power andconcentration. Everything I looked at was obviously fascinating, and I had asense of meanings stretching around me into the distance. Everything I sawreminded me of something else-for example, of Christmases in my childhood. Itwas as if my normally narrow and limited consciousness had been widened anddeepened by concentration, until the whole world was seen to be fascinating. Ittaught me that \"higher consciousness,\" or \"positive consciousness,\" can beachieved by an act of focused concentration.PLATO AT THE DENTIST'SIn Beyond The Occult, I also quote the experiences of a writer called R. H.Ward, whose book about psychedelic drugs, A Drug Taker's Notes, is a modernclassic. Early in the book, Ward describes how he once had a remarkableexperience under dental gas. He writes: \"I passed, after the first fewinhalations of the gas, directly into a state of consciousness far more completethan the fullest degree of ordinary consciousness.\" He had a sense of enormouslyextended vision, so that his mind was aware of all kinds of things that wouldnormally have been beyond his natural range of awareness. Like Robert Gravesbehind the cricket pavilion, he seemed to understand everything. And as hecontinued \"rising,\" he seemed to pass through a \"region of ideas\" where \"All wasidea, and form did not exist.\" And he adds: \"It seems to me very interestingthat one should thus, in a dentist's chair and in the twentieth century, receivepractical confirmation of the theories of Plato.\" In short, Ward had seen thetruth of Plato's notion that the universe consists of two worlds: a world ofbecoming, and a world of true being. He had also seen the falseness ofHeraclitus's belief that the only world is the world of becoming.If we think once more of Dostoevsky in front of the firing squad, we can see theexpectation of death galvanized him to a new level of attention, in which heconcentrated the mind as never before-and as I concentrated my mind as I drovethrough the snow. It is this act of concentration-like pulling back a springloaded piston, or the string of a crossbow-that gives the mind the ability tobecome aware of the immense depths that lie \"below the iceberg.\"POSTSCRIPTAfter finishing this piece, I took my dog for a walk in the woods. I was tired-Ihad been working since early morning-yet in spite of my tiredness, I experienceda powerful sense of beauty and euphoria that filled me with optimism. This, Irealized, was because the contents of this piece had penetrated to myunconscious mind, and made me clearly aware that the world of everydayconsciousness is only the surface of the mind. For me, this underlines thecertainty I have always felt: freedom does not have to come from some religiousor yogic discipline. The most reliable way of achieving it is through intellect,through knowledge."}]
