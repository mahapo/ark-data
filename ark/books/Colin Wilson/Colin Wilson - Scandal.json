Murder has alwaysinterested me because it is one of the extremes of human nature; by comparison,an interest in scandal seems a rather discreditable form of self-indulgence,like a passion for chocolate eclairs. Then I began to think about some of theclassic scandals – the Mayerling affair, the Dreyfus case, the Fatty Arbuckle‘rape’, the Profumo scandal – and saw that I was being narrow-minded. The greatscandals afford the same opportunity to study the curious complexities of humannature as the famous criminal cases.The next problem was to decide precisely what constitutes a scandal. A goodstarting point seemed to be Henry Fielding’s remark: ‘Love and scandal are thebest sweeteners of tea.’ That is to say, a scandal is any event that ‘lets thecat out of the bag’ and provides material for interesting gossip. That is whythe best scandals seem to involve the downfall of some respectable person as aresult of sexual or financial misdemeanours. The case of the rector of Stiffkeyis probably the archetypal sexual scandal.As I began to work on the book, I began to see an altogether more interestingcommon factor. When Ken Lay and his colleagues hid Enron’s financial woes frominvestors, they must have known that the true scale of the company’s losseswould one day have to become public knowledge. So why did they do it? Becausethey were dual personalities. Lay was a respected and seemingly responsiblebusinessman with access to the most powerful men in the United States, butanother part of his personality seems to have had a coward’s inability to admitto and take responsibility for his own failures.There is an ultimate stupidity about most criminals, even when they happen to behighly intelligent; they are a disturbing example of what William James calls ‘acertain blindness in human beings’. With people involved in scandal, it is notso much blindness as a kind of astigmatism. They want the world to see them asrespectable, but there is an element of childish egoism that they somehow feelthey ‘deserve’ to indulge. The late Dr Rachel Pinney, a successful psychiatrist,told me that as soon as she found herself alone in someone else’s house, sheexperienced an immediate compulsion to go and look in the drawers. She admittedthat this dated back to childhood, when her parents went out and she was free toexplore the ‘forbidden’ places of their bedroom. In The Idiot, there is a sceneat a party where all the characters decide to tell one another the most shamefulthing they have ever done – proof that Dostoevsky recognized this same ‘split’as a fundamental part of human nature.It is here that we can begin to grasp the deeper reasons for the fascination ofscandal. Simone de Beauvoir remarked about Albert Camus that he often talked toher of an idea that obsessed him: that one day it had to be possible to writethe Truth. ‘The truth, as she saw it, was that in Camus the gap between his lifeand his writing was wider than in many others,’ says Herbert Lottman, Camus’sbiographer. Camus was an incorrigible seducer who found girls irresistible; hismarriage dissolved because of this problem and he spent much of his time livingin hotels where he could entertain his mistresses more freely. It must haveseemed ironic to this man, who knew he was regarded as one of the majorintellectual figures of his time, to have to go through the usual trivial patternecessary to get a girl into bed. He knew he was not interested in herpersonally, that all he wanted was to get her to remove her clothes. Yet he wassupposed to be a humanist who taught the importance of personal relationships.In a deeper sense, he undoubtedly believed in compassion and personalrelationships. So how could it be possible to tell the exact truth aboutoneself?The same point emerges in a story Lottman tells about Sartre and Camus gettingdrunk and staggering back home in the early hours of the morning. ‘To think,’said Sartre, ‘that in a few hours I’ll be lecturing in the Sorbonne about thewriter’s responsibility.’ He was not suggesting that there was somethinghypocritical or particularly irresponsible about a ‘serious’ writer being drunk;only noting that the Sartre who stood up to speak to the students and the Sartrewho was now weaving his way homeward were not quite the same person.Now obviously, the simplest and crudest way of ‘not being the same person’ is tobe a hypocrite, like Tartuffe. And that is why scandal intrigues us: because itsuggests that truth has finally triumphed and the hypocrite stands exposed. Butit is never quite as simple as that. Lord Byron and Oscar Wilde were certainlynot hypocrites; in fact, they did their best to drop very broad hints abouttheir ‘secret sins’ in their writings. (In the case of Wilde, I have alwayssuspected some masochistic element that unconsciously connived in his owndiscovery and downfall.) H.G. Wells was not in the least hypocritical about hislove life – indeed, he went out of his way to drop broad hints about it in manyof his novels. Yet when confronted with a scandal – in the case of the younglady who tried to commit suicide on his carpet – he hastily contacted hisfriends on the newspapers and made sure nothing appeared in print. He hadrecognized what becomes very clear in this book: that scandal is a kind ofdistorting mirror that obscures the truth just as much as it reveals it.This is because scandal is based on wishful thinking. The public wants to beshocked in order to confirm its own sense of virtue.Which explains why the universal love of scandal can be so dangerous. FattyArbuckle caused the accidental death of a young girl by landing on her with hisfull weight when she had a distended bladder. The simple explanation was notenough for the American public, and rumours began to circulate that he had rapedher with a bottle, that his member was abnormally large, and so on. Arbuckle,being a naive and good-natured soul, totally failed to grasp what was happening,and was convinced that the public would once again take him to its heart if hewas allowed the opportunity to make more films. What he failed to understand wasthat as a star of silent films, he had become a kind of myth. He was thearchetypal clown, like Buttons in the pantomime. After the death of VirginiaRappe, he suddenly became a different type of myth – the ravening monster. (Allfairy tales of monsters and beasts have sexual overtones. Think of Little RedRiding Hood.) He had become a victim of the psychological distortion mechanism.Hollywood is, of course, one enormous distorting mirror – which is why thesection on Hollywood scandal is the longest in this book. Robert Harrison, thepublisher of Hollywood’s most successful scandal magazine, Confidential,explained its success by saying, ‘Americans like to read about things which theyare afraid to do themselves.’ But I am inclined to see this as anoversimplification. Would most people really have liked to launch the South SeaBubble, or sodomize telegraph boys in cheap hotel rooms, or be involved in thebribery of politicians? Obviously not. What interests us is the contrast betweenmyth and reality that becomes apparent when a scandal explodes.Writers are particularly obsessed by this contrast because every writer sees itas his task to tell his own particular kind of truth. This occupation has itsown dangers, as Graham Greene discovered when he reviewed a Shirley Temple filmfor a magazine in the 1930s and found himself in court on a libel charge.Evidently irritated by the sugary sweetness of the Shirley Temple image, Greeneattempted to administer his own corrective by suggesting that her main appealwas to dirty old paedophiles; her studio was so enraged that they sued Greene onthe grounds that he had accused them of procuring Miss Temple for immoralpurposes. But why did the studio bother to sue the film critic of asmall-circulation magazine? The answer must be that they felt that Greene wastrying to prick the balloon, destroy the illusion, and their living depended onmaintaining illusions.This, then, is why we all enjoy reading about scandal: because we all enjoyseeing overinflated balloons explode. Yet this, as I have pointed out, is also akind of illusion. Arbuckle was not really an overinflated balloon, even if helooked like one. Oscar Wilde was not really a monster of perversity. Scandalspecializes in half-truths.This is why the range of this book is so wide and why some of its ‘cases’ – forexample H.G. Wells and Bertrand Russell – do not, strictly speaking, qualify asscandals. Scandal lies in the nature of a human being rather than in the chainof events that caused a public commotion. Some scandals, when examinedobjectively, dwindle to microscopic proportions, and we realize that this isbecause they were never really scandals in the first place. This appliesespecially to political scandals, which are usually inflated out of allproportion by journalists and opposition politicians. When I was in Washingtonin 1966, I had dinner at the house of a Georgetown hostess who had been a closefriend of President Kennedy. When I asked whether it was true that Kennedy hadbeen a notorious womanizer, everyone looked shocked and reproachful and I wasassured that there was absolutely no truth in the story. By the time therevelations of Judith Exner – and other of the president’s exmistresses – beganto appear, no one really cared any more. A recent paperback on Kennedy prints onits cover the story that when Jackie Kennedy came back from a journey, she founda pair of panties under the president’s pillow; she tossed them at Kennedy withthe comment, ‘You’d better return these – they’re not my size.’ If Kennedy’sopponents had got hold of that story in the early 1960s, it would have beenblown up into a major scandal; Kennedy would have been branded a lecherousbeast, a faithless husband, a danger to national security. Twenty years or solater, the same story provokes admiring chuckles; it proves that Kennedy wasmasculine and virile and willing to take risks – in fact, precisely the kind ofman who ought to be president.It seems even more puzzling that in spite of endless scandals about his allegedmistresses, Bill Clinton was then elected president for a second term, and thatthe Monica Lewinsky scandal, in which he was proved to have a taste for oralsex, apparently had no impact whatever on his popularity, and it seems highlyprobable that, if he had been allowed to stand for a third term, he would havebeen elected again.Why should that have been so? The reason, I would suggest, is obvious: thatClinton was such an easygoing charmer that most people liked him – which is alsowhy those who tried to bring him down, like Ken Starr and Linda Tripp, garneredso much unpopularity and so little public support. And that, in retrospect,seems to be why Kennedy’s sexual exploits were never revealed by some‘investigative journalist’ – everybody liked him. And to make a maximum impact,the central character in a scandal must be disliked – or at least, regarded as afigure of unimpeachable reputation.This is why the Jeffrey Archer story provided the British press with so manyacres of moralizing editorials. Archer’s rise to best-sellerdom and the House ofLords is certainly a remarkable success story. But the seeds of Archer’sdownfall lay in his love of publicity. He could not resist boasting about hisown achievement and emphasizing that he was a millionaire. And there can be nodoubt that the association of his name with that of Margaret Thatcher did him nogood, since – whatever her real political achievements – she was seen as aheadmistressy authority figure, whose ultimate downfall pleased as manyConservatives as Socialists.This is why, when Archer was accused of paying a prostitute to leave the countryin 1986, many people smiled grimly. Few – including myself – had the slightestdoubt that he was guilty. So when he was not only acquitted – due in part to theasinine remarks of the judge about Mary Archer’s ‘elegance’ and ‘fragrance’ –but also awarded staggering damages, most people seemed to feel that he had beenfar luckier than he deserved, and it was about time fate showed its impartialityby cutting him down to size. Under those circumstances, to stand as candidatefor the mayor of London showed extraordinary tactlessness. Which explains why itcaused such widespread satisfaction when, in 2000, he was found guilty of tryingto pervert the course of justice, and sent to prison.We could, of course, choose to look at all this from Archer’s point of view. Theoriginal libel case came about because of a deliberate ‘sting’ by the News ofthe World, who persuaded the prostitute in question to telephone him and explainthat she was being persecuted by the press. So when he found himself on thefront page of the News of the World, Archer undoubtedly felt that he had beentreated unfairly. His chances of winning the case were only 50/50 – particularlywhen a reputable journalist, Adam Raphael, testifed in court that Archer hadtold him that he had met Monica Coughlan – thereby contradicting Archer’s ownstory. If it had not been for the judge’s obvious bias in favour of Mary Archerand against the newspapers concerned, he probably would have lost.It is easy to see why Archer felt justified in asking a friend to change thedate on which he was supposed to have dined with him. This evidence was not, infact, required in court. But when Archer received his enormous damages, heprobably muttered, ‘Serves ’em bloody well right.’ And in altering a little ofthe evidence in his own favour, he was simply trying to serve them right.It seems highly probable that the Archer case had an influence on the subsequentdownfall of Jonathan Aitken. Aitken’s remarks in Parliament about ‘the cancer ofbent and twisted journalism’ have a ring of bitter sincerity. He had seen whathappened to his colleague Jeffrey Archer, and must have been delighted to seethe News of the World get its comeuppance. And he set out to give the press yetanother black eye.His mistake, we can now see, lay in overconfidence, and in not paying heed tothe warning of the editor of the Guardian that he had proof that Aitken had notpaid his own bill at the Ritz. Did it matter who had paid his bill? Probablynot. Aitken’s mistake lay in deciding to make an issue of it.There is one more important point to be made. In the course of writing my halfof this book, it became increasingly clear to me that most of the peopleinvolved in scandals have the same problem: an extremely powerful sex drive. Aglance down the Contents page will demonstrate that most of the people in it areextremely highly sexed. This is natural, because they belong to what zoologistscall ‘the dominant five per cent’, and most dominant people are highlyinterested in sex. But we may also observe that most of these people alsopossessed a high degree of recklessness, and that it was their recklessness andlack of judgement that qualifies them for inclusion in Scandal! – an observationthat adds a moral dimension to what would otherwise be a mere collection ofgossip."},{"pageContent":"AITKEN, JONATHANA POLITICIAN’S SELF-DESTRUCTIONONE OF THE most spectacular courtroom dramas of the 1990s ended in the downfallof the Conservative Cabinet Minister Jonathan Aitken, who had taken a libelaction against the Guardian newspaper and Independent Television’s programme,World in Action. Before he began his action, Aitken made a speech in Parliamentin which he declared: ‘If it falls to me to start a fight to cut out the cancerof bent and twisted journalism in our country with the simple sword of truth andthe trusty shield of British fair play, so be it. I am ready for the fight!’In fact, as Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger remarked after the trial: ‘It wasAitken who was impaled on the sword of truth.’Aitken had been an extraordinarily successful Conservative politician, who hadmade himself a fortune working as a ‘fixer’ for oil-rich Arabs – and inparticular, for Prince Mohammed bin Fahd, the son of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.It might be said that the man who was ultimately responsible for Aitken’s fallfrom grace was his great-uncle Max Aitken, better known as Lord Beaverbrook,millionaire proprietor of the Daily Express and minister in Churchill’s wartimegovernment. When Aitken was 21, in 1964, his great uncle told him that he hadbeen making his will, and went on: ‘I’ve been thinking about you. You’re a verybright boy with a very bright future. In some ways you’re the best of the bunch.I’m going to pay you the greatest compliment – I’m not going to give you asingle cent.’ Instead, he handed him £150: ‘Now here’s your fare back toOxford.’Aitken understood what he meant. His great-uncle was saying: ‘I’ve made my ownway in the world and I believe that’s the way it should be done. If I give youtoo much help, it would only make you lazy.’In fact, the young Aitken had a great deal going for him. Born on 30 August1942, Jonathan William Patrick Aitken was the son of a Conservative Member ofParliament, Sir William Traven Aitken, and Lady Penelope Aitken, daughter of the1st Baron of Rugby. His maternal grandfather was Lord Rugby, a distinguishedcolonial civil servant, who taught Jonathan Latin, French and poetry. Jonathanhad started life badly, with tuberculosis of the lungs that spread to his bones.He spent three years in a plaster cast. In due course, he was sent to Eton.There, as the President of the Political Society, he acquired his skill indebating and in the judicious use of the English language. Unfortunately, theritual beatings administered by prefects – whose ranks he eventually joined –also gave him a taste for flogging and being flogged.At Christ Church College, Oxford, he read law. Although his father hadquarrelled with Lord Beaverbrook, Aitken wrote to his great-uncle asking if hecould come and see him, and Beaverbrook was impressed. As a result, Aitken cameto know the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, and became a part-time speechwriterto Selwyn Lloyd, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. And so, while still at Oxford,he got his foot on the bottom rung of the political ladder.When Selwyn Lloyd was sacked by Macmillan in the famous ‘Night of the LongKnives’, Aitken went with Lloyd to Spain, helping him through a near-breakdown.As a result, he was appointed Lloyd’s private secretary. He was soon mixing withall the senior Tories. When Selwyn Lloyd became Leader of the House, Aitken’sprospects were greatly enhanced. Nevertheless, he turned down a suggestion byRandolph Churchill that he should contest a safe Tory seat at the age of twenty.Aitken’s father died in 1964, the same year as Lord Beaverbrook. Aitken was leftonly £5,000 and business interests in Canada (the original home of LordBeaverbrook).He joined the Evening Standard, which belonged to the Express Group, and provedto be a naturally brilliant journalist. He had already co-authored a travel bookon America called A Short Walk on the Campus; now he went on to write a bookcalled Young Meteors, about the up-and-coming younger generation, in which hesingled out Roy Hattersley, and even mentioned David Frost and the Beatles. Healso wrote a chapter about prostitution with some emphasis on sado-masochism. Athis book launch, he met a girl named Jenny Fabian, who was also an author. Shereturned to his flat, where he asked her if she would like to be whipped with anelectric cable, then tied her hands to the bedposts with a cord from his maroonsilk dressing-gown. But then, Aitken found it easy to get women, having thelooks of a matinée idol, and his sex life was interesting and varied.He became a presenter for Yorkshire TV and, in that capacity, travelled toNigeria to report on the civil war. It was because of this visit that he becameembroiled in an affair that led to his first appearance in court, and caused himto lose the nomination for a Conservative safe seat in Yorkshire.In December 1969, Aitken went to dinner with Major-General Henry TemplarAlexander, the father of a girl Aitken had escorted to a dance. Alexander hadserved in Nigeria as a military observer, and was a supporter of the Federalforces who were fighting the rebel Biafrans. Alexander showed the youngConservative contender a document which revealed that Harold Wilson’s Labourgovernment was supplying arms to the Nigerian Federal forces. It was by aBritish official in the High Commission in Lagos, Colonel Robert Scott. Aitkenphotocopied this, sent it to his political mentor, Hugh Fraser, then sold thereport to the Sunday Telegraph. The result was an article with the headline:SECRET BIAFRAN WAR PLAN REVEALED: MUDDLE, CORRUPTION, WASTE.The consequence of this revelation was that Colonel Scott was expelled.Alexander also found himself in trouble. Aitken lost no time in shifting theblame for the leak to Hugh Fraser, but the major-general had recorded theconversation in which Aitken explained that he was not to blame, and Aitkenfound himself in court for breaching the Official Secrets Act. Fortunately forAitken, the judge, Mr Justice Caulfield, disliked both the Labour government andthe Official Secrets Act and Aitken was acquitted.But the trial cost him his ‘safe seat’. The affair made him a lifelong opponentof the Official Secrets Act.Aitken completed his betrayal of Hugh Fraser by having an affair with his wife,Lady Antonia Fraser. In their book The Liar: The Fall of Jonathan Aitken, LukeHarding, David Leigh, a TV producer, and David Pallister, a Guardian journalist,mention that Aitken’s other conquests included Lady Charlotte Curzon, thedaughter of Earl Howe, Elizabeth Harrison, former wife of actors Richard Harrisand Rex Harrison, Arianna Stassinopoulos, Germaine Greer, Soraya Khashoggi, theex-wife of the millionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, and (at the same time)Soraya’s maid.Aitken finally became a Conservative Member of Parliament at the age of 32, in1974.However, Mrs Thatcher failed to warm to Aitken, perhaps prejudiced by Aitken’sremark to a Cairo newspaper that ‘I wouldn’t say she’s open-minded on the MiddleEast so much as empty-headed. She probably thinks Sinai is the plural of sinus.’This was picked up by Private Eye, and the MP Airey Neave told Aitken toapologize.He further alienated Mrs Thatcher by having a romance with her daughter Carol,who was ten years his junior. She went with him to knock on doors during hispolitical campaign, as did his secretary Valerie Scott, with whom he was havingan affair. Mrs Thatcher later referred to Aitken as ‘the man who made Carolcry’.His political advancement blocked, Aitken went into business and started acompany to manage Unit Trusts. With his cousin, Tim Aitken, he formed afinancial-services group, Aitken Hume. He soon ousted his cousin as chairman,and Tim Aitken was to tell friends that he had got ‘a knife between his shoulderblades’.Aitken was also associated with the immensely successful firm Slater-Walker,which was to collapse in 1974 as an indirect result of the Arab oil crisis.The previous year, Aitken had attended a lunch in Paris and met a Saudi princewho loved everything British: Mohammed bin Fahd, son of the Crown Prince Fahd –the latter would become king in 1975 when his father, King Faisal, wasassassinated. Mohammed and Aitken liked one another, with the consequence thatMohammed invited Aitken to call on him if he happened to come to Riyadh.Mohammed’s financial advisor and ‘fixer’ was a charming and good-looking youngman called Said Ayas, who would play a major part in Aitken’s rise – and fall.If you were a Saudi prince – or a close friend of a Saudi prince – it was easyto become very wealthy. Saudi Arabia’s wealth was based on oil, which had begunto flow in 1933. With its immense wealth, the country needed new towns,universities, railways, air transport, industrial machinery, a telephone system,and all the other appurtenances of modern civilization. The Western companiesthat were called upon to supply these goods and services could make suchenormous profits that they were perfectly happy to pay large bribes to anyonewho could persuade the Saudis to accept their tender. (Bribery was endemic inthe Middle East.) Prince Mohammed was the chief of these ‘fixers’ and reckonedon making an income of $60 million per year in commissions. Ayas’s income alsoran to millions annually.Jonathan Aitken made contact with the Saudis at about the time of the Yom Kippurwar of October 1973, when Egypt and Syria united against Israel, and which endedin an Israeli victory. But as Israel expanded its territory the Arabs began touse the ‘oil weapon’, and it was their threat to cut off Western supplies of oilthat led the West to intervene and bring the war to an end. In fact, ColonelGaddafi of Libya had already begun to raise oil prices shortly after histakeover in 1971.In 1973, in the euphoria of the original successes of Egypt and Syria in the YomKippur war, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) doubled theoil prices, and then doubled them again that December. So Aitken came along whenSaudi Arabia was literally awash with new wealth.It was at the end of 1974 that Aitken flew to Riyadh and called at Said Ayas’shouse for dinner. Six months later, he discovered the way to Ayas’s heart.Ayas’s brother, Mimo, wanted to go to Cambridge, but only had an American degreethat was not recognized by the university. Aitken pulled strings, and soon Mimohad been accepted at Downing College. It was the foundation of Aitken’sfriendship with Ayas – and of Aitken’s fortune. Ayas introduced him to a richPalestinian entrepreneur named Ramzi Sanbar who had made his fortune in theSaudi construction business. When the war between Muslim and Christian militiasdrove him out of Lebanon in 1975, Sanbar moved to London.Soon, Aitken was installed in Sanbar’s magnificent office in Park Lane. Theauthors of The Liar write: ‘Sitting in a wood-panelled ground floor office, withhis feet up on a mahogany desk, Aitken must have felt a cut above hisparliamentary colleagues, making do with cramped offices in the Gothic labyrinthof the House of Commons.’ There was a price, however, to this Faustianarrangement. From now on, Valerie Scott recalls, this junior Conservativeback-bencher was obliged to do ‘whatever made the Arabs happy’.Aitken became Chairman of the British-Saudi Parliamentary Group in the Commons,which gave him access to free travel to Riyadh. He was to remark: ‘I wish I hadsome interests to declare in this area, so fantastic are those opportunities.’Aitken soon had plenty of interests to declare – although, oddly enough, theywere never declared in the newly drafted Register of MPs’ Interests.Aitken was given a magnificent blue Jaguar by his new employers; he admonishedValerie Scott not to tell anyone the prince had given him the car, adding thathe was particularly anxious that his constituents (whom he described as‘peasants’) should not find out. The authors of The Liar mention that ‘gifts ofexpensive cars from princes to hangers-on were routine in those heady days. Ajoke going the rounds in Riyadh was that princely Cadillacs were dumped when theashtrays were full.’When the prince and his entourage came to Britain – which happened several timesa year for a fortnight at a time – Aitken was there to do his bidding.> His white Rolls-Royce, upholstered in blue velvet, would pull up on the> cobbled forecourt [of the Sanbar office]. A retinue of followers would throng> into the rather sombre office. It was always a moment of high excitement for> Sanbar’s staff. The office butler had laid on sandwiches and the prince’s> favourite chocolate gateau from a local patisserie. At the end of each visit> Said Ayas would get out the envelopes. Sometimes it was £250; if the prince> was especially generous it might be £1,000 – the equivalent of three months’> wages. The envelopes were handed out to everybody – the receptionist, butler> and secretaries.Aitken’s envelope was assumed to contain very large sums indeed.He worked for it. He learned Arabic, went along with the prince to variouscasinos – although gambling bored him – and came running whenever Mohammedbeckoned.Typical of Mohammed’s activity was a deal he brokered with the Dutch electronicsfirm, Philips. They were invited to place a bid to modernize the Saudi telephonesystem. The sum they quoted was £3.5 billion. The Saudi’s own consultantsestimated that it could be done for a little over half a billion. Otherelectronics firms – particularly in the US – protested, so that King Fahd feltobliged to put the contract out to the lowest bidder. Philips thereupon sent ina revised bid for £1.7 billion, and were given the contract in December 1977.Prince Mohammed’s commission was $300 million, while Said Ayas collected $50million. Presumably Ramzi Sanbar and his advisor Jonathan Aitken also collectedcommission.In the summer of 1977, Aitken helped Prince Mohammed buy a jet plane. It was aBoeing 747 Jumbo which even had a fountain. It was Aitken who introducedMohammed to Sir Kenneth Heath, the Chairman of Rolls-Royce, at the Paris airshow. The plane cost £3.5 million – little more than small change to Mohammed.Pilots were supplied by British Caledonian and Aitken recruited some of theair-hostesses.In the following year, Aitken’s power increased when the prince dispensed withthe services of Ramzi Sanbar, and got Aitken to buy a new office only fiftyyards away from the old one in Mayfair. Aitken became managing director of thefirm, which was called Al Bilad. Said Ayas was a director. Aitken purchasedRolls-Royces and Bentleys for the prince, and shipped them out to Arabia. Theprince came to own a fleet of ninety.But the chief business of Al Bilad UK was to act as the middleman for UKbusiness contracts with Saudi Arabia. Its commission fees, charged to theBritish supplier, were 15 per cent. The authors of The Liar quote a businessmanwho met Aitken: ‘a working man can quickly spot a spiv a million miles away. Hewas incredibly rude to people who worked for him and obsequious to the Arabs. Hewas like their messenger boy.’Aitken had by then acquired himself a wife, Serbian born Lolicia Azucki, wholater admitted that she had quite determinedly set out to marry him. At firsther campaign was unsuccessful – Aitken would even refuse to take her telephonecalls – but when she nursed him through typhoid at the end of 1977, he decidedthat, after all, he needed a wife.In 1980, Aitken’s contact with the Saudis enabled him to move into a four-storeyGeorgian town house in Connaught Square. It cost £183,000. A year later, theybought a Westminster house at 8, Lord North Street, close to the House ofCommons and Conservative Central Office. In 1987, he was to buy the White Housein Sandwich, in his Kent constituency, overlooking the Royal St George’s golfcourse, which cost £500,000.A sudden crisis in Britain’s relations with Saudi Arabia brought newopportunities. Commercial television presented a drama, based on real life,involving the execution of a Saudi princess and her lover for adultery. Theprincess was executed by being shot in the back of the head. Officially, she wasdeclared to have died in a swimming pool accident. The programme was broadcastin March 1980, and the Saudis were infuriated. The British Foreign Officeapologized fulsomely through Lord Carrington, but Aitken benefited by theincident when the Saudis decided that they should try to acquire some influenceby buying an interest in the British media. Aitken was part of a consortium thatwon the franchise for Breakfast TV. Peter Jay, the Chairman of TV-am, laterdeclared: ‘I was given the impression [the money] came from cutting down aBeaverbrook forest in Canada.’In fact, the Arab stake in TV-am contravened rules which prevented non-Europeansfrom controlling British TV stations. The answer was not to let it become known.When TV-am’s ratings plummeted, Peter Jay was ousted in favour of JonathanAitken – who was also quickly ousted by the Independent Broadcasting Authoritybecause, as a Conservative MP, he could not be regarded as politicallyimpartial. It was a cartoon character called Roland Rat who rescued TV-am’sratings.Aitken’s cousin, Tim, who had apparently failed to learn from the ‘knife betweenthe shoulder blades’ administered when he was ousted from the Chairmanship ofAitken Hume, had also joined the board of TV-am, but was once again dismissed.His place was taken by the Syrian entrepreneur Wafic Said.Seven years later, Tim Aitken would tell the Observer newspaper about the Saudifinancial backing organized by his cousin.Mrs Thatcher’s downfall came in 1990. John Major stepped into her shoes, and in1992, Aitken was made Minister of State for Defence Procurement.In fact, Mrs Thatcher had signed an arms deal with Saudi Arabia in 1986. It wasworth £1.5 billion a year to the Ministry of Defence. For a TornadoFighter-Bomber which cost £20 million to build, the Saudis were charged £35million. The manufacturers then paid 26 per cent of the price in ‘commission’.Helicopters, mine-sweepers and other arms sold to the Saudis were subject to asimilar arrangement. Associates of Aitken did very well out of the deals. WaficSaid was able to afford a £9 million apartment in London, a town house inRegent’s Park, a Paris apartment, a villa in Marbella, a ski-lodge inSwitzerland, and a flat in Monaco.Although Aitken did not know it, the seeds of his downfall were sown in 1979when an Alexandria-born entrepreneur named Mohammed al Fayed bought the run-downRitz Hotel in Paris and set out to turn it into a home-from-home for the veryrich. Jacques Chirac, then Mayor of Paris, presented al Fayed with the freedomof the city. But in London, this colourful Egyptian businessman was regardedwith rather less favour by the British establishment.According to the unauthorized biography by Tom Bower, al Fayed started outselling Coca-Cola on the streets of his home town of Alexandria, got a job witharms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and married his sister, then, in the 1960s,persuaded the dictator Papa Doc Duvalier of Haiti to put money into variouscapital projects, from which the dictator failed to gain the expected returns.In the 1970s, al Fayed and his brother met the remarkable businessman TinyRowland, who had made his fortune in Africa, and who was the head of a firmcalled Lonrho. For a while, the al Fayeds were on the board of Lonrho. But alFayed disapproved of Rowland’s methods, and there was a parting. In 1985, duringa cash crisis, Rowland asked Mohammed al Fayed to buy some of his shares in theHouse of Fraser Group (which owned Harrods), which Rowland was hoping to takeover. What followed was considered by Rowland to be a piece of appallingtreachery – it was al Fayed who took over the House of Fraser. And thegovernment, which had opposed Rowland’s bid (Rowland had been the target of MrHeath’s comment about ‘the unacceptable face of capitalism’), supported al Fayedand enabled him to take over the House of Fraser. Rowland was so furious that hespent the rest of his life trying to destroy al Fayed. Although he failed, andal Fayed was the eventual winner of their extremely public battle, theloquacious Egyptian did himself no good by saying uncomplimentary things aboutthe British establishment. He was particularly incensed by a Department of Tradeand Industry inspectors’ report into his takeover of the House of Fraser whichdeclared that al Fayed had lied about his origins.In June 1993, al Fayed invited Peter Preston, the editor of the Guardian, tocome and meet him in his office above Harrods. The Guardian had published astory about secret donations to the Conservative Party before the 1992 GeneralElection, which led to the threat of a libel action. Al Fayed, who claimedindignantly that the government ‘had shat on him’, made accusations aboutMargaret Thatcher, her son, Mark, and business dealings with the Arabs. At thesame time, he mentioned that he had been paying two Members of Parliament, NeilHamilton and Tim Smith, to ask questions in Parliament that would help Fayed inhis battle with Tiny Rowland.As a result of that meeting, two Guardian reporters began investigating thematter of party funding.But Fayed had come upon another story that he thought might interest theGuardian. And he told Preston about it on 16 October 1993. On the weekend of 17September, Fayed had seen Jonathan Aitken in the Ritz Hotel in Paris togetherwith Said Ayas, while Wafic Said was also in the hotel. According to Fayed, thisamounted to seeing the Attorney General dining with Al Capone.Moreover, said al Fayed, Aitken had not paid his own bill for that weekend. Ithad been debited to Ayas. And to prove his point, Fayed showed Preston a copy ofthe bill. It was for 8,010 French francs which, at approximately 8 francs to thepound sterling, was about £1,000. Since Aitken had not declared the benefitsthat came to him via Prince Mohammed in the MPs’ Register of Interests, he wasin breach of the Rules for Ministers.Preston was not deeply interested. A mere thousand pounds seemed a fairly minormatter. After all, Aitken was known to be a millionaire. Nevertheless, DavidPallister, a Guardian journalist who was an expert on Saudi affairs, wrote toAitken about his weekend at the Ritz, and asked ‘how it relates to your job inGovernment?’Aitken’s reply stated that the purpose of his visit to Paris that weekend hadnothing whatsoever to do with Said Ayas, or Wafic Said. He was there, he said,to meet his wife and seventeen-year-old daughter, who were going to her newschool in Switzerland that weekend. According to Aitken, he had had no ‘socialencounters’ that weekend except with the godparents of his daughter Victoria.Pallister happened to know that Said Ayas was Victoria Aitken’s godfather. SoAitken’s letter might be regarded as a deliberate evasion.At this point, the affair certainly showed no sign of the storm that wasbrewing. Aitken had had his bill paid by his daughter’s godfather, and he mighthave made a thousand excuses that would have satisfied Pallister’s curiosity.Perhaps Ayas had accepted Aitken’s hospitality in London, and was simplyreturning the favour. Or perhaps Aitken had simply left his credit card behind.Such excuses would have ended the affair there and then.However, Preston happened to know Aitken personally, and since he had reportersinvestigating possible Tory financial irregularities, he asked if Aitken wouldlike to explain himself more fully.Aitken replied breezily that he felt that Preston had put two and two togetherand made about seven, and that the dinner in Paris was simply ‘a casuallyarranged family affair’. It was nothing whatever to do with business.But in that case, why had Ayas paid Aitken’s bill?Now, although Preston had seen a copy of this bill in al Fayed’s office, alFayed had refused to give it to him. But al Fayed was helpful about how theGuardian could obtain a copy. They merely had to fax a letter on Aitken’s Houseof Commons notepaper asking if a copy of the bill could be sent to the faxnumber at the top of the letter – which was actually the Guardian’s fax.Forty-eight hours later, the copy of the bill arrived. The ruse was not quitehonest, of course, but then, its sole purpose was to keep al Fayed’s name out ofthe story.So now, on 11 January 1994, Preston wrote again to Aitken, saying that paying abill for a thousand pounds had been ‘an extraordinary act of generosity’ on thepart of Ayas, and asking him to explain it.Aitken then made his fatal mistake. In his reply, he stated that Preston hadbeen misinformed: ‘Mr Ayas did not pay my hotel bill . . . the hotel bill waspaid by my wife, with money given to her by me for this purpose some hours afterI’d left Paris.’Aitken had now committed himself to a lie, which he would eventually be forcedto defend in court.The truth was that Lolicia Aitken had not even been in Paris that weekend. Shehad gone to Switzerland to take her daughter, Victoria, to finishing schoolthere, and had then flown straight back to Heathrow. In committing himself to alie, Aitken was playing with fire.Preston replied: ‘I’m afraid I cannot easily accept your assurances about theRitz bill . . .’ The Guardian was in a position to prove that Aitken had notpaid his hotel bill. Moreover, Aitken’s assurance that his wife had paid thebill was rather mysterious in view of the fact that the bill showed that Aitkenhad been occupying a single room that weekend and, therefore, presumably, hiswife was not there.Soon, Aitken was phoning the Guardian to claim that he had now found his Ritzbill and had located ‘an independent French witness’ who confirmed that his wifeLolicia had paid it. Mr Ayas, he said, had now received a letter from the RitzHotel confirming that he did not pay the bill, and that Mrs Aitken did.Since Aitken had invited Preston to refer the matter to Sir Robin Butler, theCabinet Secretary, Preston sent the correspondence between himself and Aitken toButler. Sir Robin asked Aitken whether he had paid his hotel bill, and Aitkenassured him that he had. Thereupon, Butler wrote to Preston saying that Aitkenhad paid his own bill and so no breach of ministerial guidelines had takenplace. Preston’s response was to send the correspondence on to the PrimeMinister, John Major.The stakes increased in July 1994 when John Major appointed Aitken a minister,Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He could now call himself ‘Right Honourable’.In September 1994, al Fayed complicated the issue when he lost his temper afterlosing a case in the European Court of Human Rights. He had attempted to havethe report by the Department of Trade and Industry into his Harrods takeoverdeclared in breach of the Convention. Furious at what he saw as yet anotherbetrayal by the British Government (who were also preventing him becoming aBritish citizen), al Fayed asked Preston to come and see him again. He was quitedetermined to cause the Government any embarrassment he could. This meantadmitting that he had paid money to Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith to raisequestions in Parliament.When the Guardian printed this story, Tim Smith promptly resigned, and Hamiltonwas, in effect, sacked, insisting on his innocence.Shortly thereafter, the Guardian printed an article about the Aitken affair, andthe result was that the Shadow Chancellor, Gordon Brown, asked in Parliamentwhether any part of Aitken’s bill had been paid by Mr Ayas. Aitken answered: ‘Iwould very much welcome a chance to answer the question, not least because it isthe first chance to clear myself of the scurrilous allegations that have beenmade.’ And since the allegations against him now included the charge that he hadlied to the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robin Butler, he flourished a letter in whichSir Robin Butler declared that he did not regard Aitken as having lied to him.‘I hope that the House . . . will accept both my assurance and the CabinetSecretary’s assurance and put an end to the hysterical episode of sleazejournalism by the Guardian.’Aitken had now lied to the House of Commons.The story about the Guardian’s fake letter to the Ritz had now also come out,having been leaked by the Downing Street Press Office. The Tories were furious,and demanded Preston’s head. One Member of Parliament, Roger Gale, describedPreston as ‘the whore from hell’.At the end of 1994, exhausted and depressed by the struggle, Preston resigned aseditor, and Alan Rusbridger took over the post.But as far as Aitken was concerned, the enemies were multiplying. TheIndependent Television programme World in Action had become interested in theaffair, particularly in the fact that Aitken was taking part in the sale of armsto the Saudis at the time when he was Defence Procurement Minister. Itsproducer, David Leigh, had built up a reputation for fearlessness, and nowdecided to start digging into Aitken’s background.The first thing he discovered was Aitken’s enthusiasm for being whipped. Thisseemed to be widely known in London society. As to Aitken’s dealings with theSaudis, David Pallister of the Guardian was the ideal ally.Another interesting scandal that Leigh uncovered had to do with a ‘HealthHydro’, named Inglewood, that Aitken had run in the 1970s. Apparently many richArabs had taken advantage of its facilities, and had been supplied with callgirls.The result was a television programme called ‘Jonathan of Arabia’, which wentout on the evening of 10 April 1995. And it was on that day, a few hours beforethe programme, that Aitken stood up in the House of Commons and made the speechwhich included his fighting declaration about the ‘fight to cut out the cancerof bent and twisted journalism in our country with the simple sword of truth andthe trusty shield of British fair play’. It was at this point that he seems tohave decided that he had no alternative than to sue the Guardian and World inAction for libel.A few hours after Aitken’s ‘sword of truth’ speech, Alan Rusbridger went intoconference with Geraldine Proudler, the Guardian’s solicitor, and decided thatthey had better ask the famous barrister George Carman to defend them.On the surface, it might seem that the defendants had an overwhelming case –based on the Ritz receipt. But then, Aitken certainly looked and sounded like anhonest man. Besides which, he was a Conservative Cabinet Minister. He only hadto convince the jury that there had been some slight misunderstanding, and thathe really had paid his own bill, to have the defendants over a barrel.The Ritz allegation, of course, was only a small part of the case. Aitken hadbeen branded a pimp and a bribe-taker. If Aitken could somehow convince the jurythat the ‘gutter press’ had done its best to damage his career, and force hisresignation from office (which had happened in July 1995), he could receiveenormous damages. British judges were not much in favour of Fleet Street, as theJeffrey Archer libel case had shown.At this point, Aitken made a serious mistake. For several years, he had carriedon an affair with a woman called Paula Strudwick, who administered floggingswith a birch twig. But in dragging the Paula Strudwick allegations into thecase, Aitken was inviting the defendants to prove that they had a point. And thejury would hear an interesting story about adultery and sexual aberration thatthey might otherwise have been spared.Before the trial, which began in June 1997, there were the May elections, whichended in a landslide victory for Labour. Jonathan Aitken was among the many wholost their seats, as was Neil Hamilton.But before the libel case opened, Aitken and his team scored a notable victory.Aitken’s counsel, Charles Gray, QC, went before the judge, Justice Sir OliverPopplewell, to suggest that the case was so complicated that it would onlyconfuse a jury. The interests of justice would be better served if the judgeheard the case by himself. The Guardian team was dismayed. They had beenthinking in terms of convincing a jury of Aitken’s many faults andmisdemeanours; now they had to convince Popplewell alone. Since Popplewell was aConservative, who probably regarded the Guardian as a left-wing rag, this meantthat the going was likely to be more difficult than the defendants had hoped.For a while, there was even talk of a climb-down, although Rusbridger arguedstrongly against it.So on Wednesday 4 June 1997, the Right Hon. Jonathan Aitken entered the HighCourt with his wife Lolicia, prepared to do battle.Gray began: ‘Mr Aitken sues the Guardian over an article entitled “Aitken triedto arrange girls for Saudis”. It is no exaggeration to say they have butcheredhis personal, political and professional reputation.’ The Guardian had claimedthat Aitken had ‘pimped’ for Arab clients and ‘deliberately concealed’ the factthat he was ‘in the pockets of the Saudi Royal Family’. These allegations were‘false, utterly false’, he told the court.Aitken was in the witness box for eight days, and his performance wasformidable. Carman’s cross examinations failed to shake him.Aitken scored a particularly good point when he described how, after reading thedescription of himself as a pimp, his twelve-year-old son had asked, ‘What’s apimp, Daddy?’ There was hardly a newspaper the next day that could resist thequote – the Daily Telegraph even made it a headline.Over that weekend, Sir Justice Popplewell carefully studied the videotape of theWorld in Action programme. The following Monday he gave his judgement on it. Itgave the impression that Aitken had known about certain forbidden arms shipmentsto Iran when he was Minister for Defence Procurement. And since this could notbe supported by evidence to the contrary, Aitken had won an important point.But, as Aitken attempted to explain away his weekend at the Ritz by expressing asuspicion that he had been ‘set up’, several journalists noticed that LoliciaAitken, sitting on the front bench, was restless and dabbed her forehead andwrists with eau de cologne. The Guardian team had noted that, when Lolicia hadbeen asked by journalists before the trial whether she had paid Aitken’s bill,she had declined to confirm it. Why was she so nervous?In fact, Aitken’s version of events was about to hit a snag. On 6 April 1995,Aitken had been accosted by the World in Action team as he left home. He hadbeen alone, but in one of his witness statements he had claimed that he had leftthe house with his daughter, Alexandra, and that she was ‘visibly upset’ by thetelevision crew’s ‘aggressive behaviour’ and had burst into tears. He andAlexandra had then escaped in his Jaguar, but they had been pursued in adangerous ‘Keystone Kops’ chase by the Granada team driving a van, and wereeventually forced to swap vehicles at the Spanish Embassy.This was pure fiction and, in fact, the evidence was at hand to prove it.Quentin McDermott of the World in Action team recalled that the whole sequencehad been recorded, but that it had ended up on the cutting room floor. He wasable to recover it, and the videotape revealed that Aitken had left the housealone, clambered into his car, and driven off, while the journalists made noattempt to pursue him. When this was shown in court, Aitken looked deeplyembarrassed at being caught out, but fortunately, the day’s proceedings came toan end.The next morning, Carman was ready to attack. ‘Where on earth is your daughterin the film that we saw yesterday?’Sitting on the front row, Lolicia mouthed at him the words: ‘Another time.’Aitken quickly explained that he had been referring to another occasion – thatthey had been approached by camera crews several times that day. Once again hehad escaped.The case was accelerating towards its spectacular finish. A Guardian reporter,Owen Bowcott, was sent to the Swiss town of Villars, where Lolicia Aitken haddelivered her daughter, Victoria, to the finishing school, Aiglon College. Itseemed that the Hotel Bristol, where Lolicia Aitken had stayed during thatweekend, had since gone bankrupt. Bowcott’s job was to see whether he could gethold of the records of Lolicia’s stay.He found the caretaker, who introduced him to two men conducting a financialinventory of the hotel’s contents. They agreed that the reception records werestill in the basement, but were not authorized to allow anyone to examine them.But Bowcott was in luck. The Hotel Panorama, a sister to the Bristol, had alsogone bankrupt, and the manager there agreed to ring the head accountant inLausanne and see if he would agree to allow Bowcott into the basement. Theanswer was no. But the manager agreed to give Bowcott the accountant’s faxnumber, and Bowcott sent him a fax asking him to ring him at his hotel. In duecourse, the accountant rang back, and was fascinated by the story that Bowcotthad to tell him. Finally, he agreed that Bowcott should be allowed to go intothe basement.It seemed an impossible task. It was piled high with boxes containing files, andthere was almost no light. Eventually, after many hours’ search, Bowcott came upwith what he was looking for: a registration card for room 234 which stated:‘adultes: 2’, and eventually he found the bill that stated that Mrs Aitken hadarrived on Friday 17 September 1993, and stayed at the hotel that night with herdaughter, and then stayed the following night alone – Victoria having apparentlybeen delivered to school.So now they knew that Lolicia Aitken had left the hotel on Sunday 19 September –the day when she was supposed to have paid Aitken’s hotel bill in Paris. Ofcourse, that did not prove that she had not gone to Paris – it was just possiblefor her to have caught a plane that would have got her to Paris in time.When Bowcott’s evidence was produced in court, Aitken was unfazed. Did not thesedocuments prove, Carman asked, that Lolicia Aitken spent Saturday evening inSwitzerland, not in Paris? No, Aitken replied smoothly, he had phoned his wifeat the Hotel Bristol at 10:15 on Sunday morning, and his wife had already leftfor Paris. And Aitken decided to compound the lie by declaring that Lolicia’smother had also been staying there in the Hotel Bristol with her. He was nowplaying a very dangerous game, since the documents could prove that he waslying.More importantly, if Jonathan Aitken had spoken to someone in the Bristol Hotelat 10:15 in the morning, and that someone was not his mother-in-law, then hiswife must have been still there at 10:15.According to Aitken, his wife had arrived in Paris ‘late to midmorning’ on theSunday. A Guardian researcher soon proved that this was impossible. There was aplane at 11:15 am that would have taken her from Geneva to Paris just in time topay the hotel bill. But since the journey from Villars to the airport was overan hour, she could not possibly have made that plane.The Guardian’s lawyer, Geraldine Proudler, decided to subpoena British Airwaysto see whether Lolicia and Victoria had actually flown to Paris to have thatmeal with Victoria’s godfather that Aitken had already admitted to. But BA wroteback saying that this would be an enormous task, which would take at least ‘33man days to complete’. The airline appointed a senior British Airways criminalinvestigator named Wendy Harris to oversee the process. But she would not beavailable for another five days.At the end of this period, on Monday 16 June, two of Geraldine Proudler’s legalassistants turned up at Heathrow to aid the search. They found themselves in avast, windowless warehouse full of spools of microfiche stacked on metalshelves.The search was successful. The legal assistants found travel coupons showingthat Mrs L Aitken and Miss V Aitken had flown directly from Heathrow to Genevaat 8:30 am on Friday 17 September 1993, and that Mrs Aitken had flown back alonefrom Geneva at 7:05 pm on Monday 20 September. Neither of them had been anywherenear Paris.Geraldine Proudler was told of the discovery as she was leaving court later thatday. She realized immediately what this meant – that Aitken had been proved aliar beyond all possible doubt, and that they had therefore won the case. Thenshe began to experience doubts. Would Aitken find a way of wriggling out ofthis?In fact, Aitken had already decided that his wife and daughter would appear incourt on his behalf, swearing to his story about the Ritz. Victoria had alreadywritten out her witness statement, in which she claimed that her Serbiangrandmother had been present in the Hotel Bristol, and that she had telephonedthe hotel on Sunday morning to be told that her mother had already left, butthat her grandmother was still there.Fortunately, Victoria Aitken would not be required to perjure herself in court.Wednesday 18 June 1997 was the anniversary of the day Napoleon had been defeatedat Waterloo. If Aitken was aware of this, he showed no sign of it as he strodepurposefully into court.Back in Switzerland, another researcher was looking through car-hire documents.He found some that revealed that Lolicia Aitken had hired a Volkswagen Golf at12:02 pm on Friday 17 September 1993 at Geneva airport. According to Aitken, shehad been in Paris at that time. She returned the car on Sunday evening.At three o’clock that afternoon, Geraldine Proudler walked into court, andhanded envelopes to David Leigh and David Pallister, and then handed another toGeorge Carman. They contained Wendy Harris’s statement about flights.David Leigh was to write, ‘Carman then rose to his feet for what he laterdescribed as the most dramatic moment of his distinguished career at the bar.’He told the judge that he was in a position to provide the plaintiff’ssolicitors and the judge with a signed witness statement from an employee ofBritish Airways, after which he handed a copy of the statement to the judge, andanother to Charles Gray. A few minutes later, the Rent-A-Car documents arrived.Mr Justice Popplewell withdrew to his chambers to study the new evidence.Leigh writes:> the former Conservative minister was slumped in the front bench with the> statement beside him. He sat in a crumpled diagonal posture, legs crossed,> reading and re-reading every page. The press bench was buzzing. Aitken’s> barrister Charles Gray decided the best strategy was to pretend nothing had> happened, although he later admitted he was fully aware of the significance of> the document.When George Carman had guided the judge through the car-hire documents, thejudge remarked: ‘Thank you very much. No doubt, Mr Gray, you will want toconsider the position overnight.’ Aitken slipped quietly out of the back of thecourt with his solicitor. He knew, as everybody else did, that his career wasfinished.In fact, Aitken lost no time in slipping out of England and flying to Californiafor a holiday with his son; the press did not succeed in tracing his address.George Carman finally brokered an agreement with Charles Gray. Aitken would pay80 per cent of the costs – a huge sum of more than £2 million – and the Guardianand Granada would pay 20 per cent of their own costs. This was not simplegenerosity on the part of the defendants. There was a second action – on thequestion of arms dealing – to be decided, and the judge might conceivably stillfind against the defendants.Said Ayas was another victim of all the unwelcome publicity. Just before thecase opened, he had returned to Saudi Arabia, where he was arrested on theorders of his former friend Prince Mohammed on a charge of having pocketedmillions of dollars. Mohammed had apparently overspent and was half a billiondollars in debt to Saudi Arabian banks. Mohammed wanted some of it back.After four months under house arrest, Ayas succeeded in escaping by dressing upas a woman and slipping past the guards outside his home. Back in his flat inLondon, he hired a bodyguard. Soon he learned that Prince Mohammed had lodged awrit demanding the return of £144 million. Under this pressure, Ayas finallyexplained – through his lawyers – what had actually been going on that weekendat the Ritz. It was indeed a massive arms deal, involving hundreds of millionsof pounds. Ayas was likely to receive ‘commission’ of about $50 million.This, apparently, explained why Aitken was so anxious to insist that it hadmerely been an innocent family gathering, with no business involved.In May 1998, Aitken was charged with perjury, conspiring to pervert the courseof justice and perverting the course of justice. Ayas was also charged withperverting the course of justice. On 19 January 1999, Aitken appeared at the OldBailey to answer the charges. The result of the trial was that he was sentencedto eighteen months in prison. In fact, he served only seven months and emergedon 7 January 2000. He was obliged to wear an electronic tag on his ankle for twomonths. He proceeded to write a book declaring that the disaster had brought himto the feet of Christ.For two years, Aitken made no attempt to pay the Guardian’s costs, insistingthat he was bankrupt. Eventually, the Guardian settled for £1.3 million of its£2 million; Aitken was obliged to sell his Lord North Street home.Harding, Leigh and Pallister conclude in The Liar that:> The Guardian and Granada were, however, left with a consoling thought. The> irony was that none of the arms deals which Aitken and Ayas had been so busily> plotting in November 1993 ever came off – partly because Prince Mohammed’s> influence was fading fast, but more importantly because the Guardian> investigated, then took the risky, and perhaps courageous, decision to> publish."},{"pageContent":"ARBUCKLE, ‘FATTY’A STAR’S DISGRACETHE SCANDAL THAT wrecked the career of film comic ‘Fatty’ Roscoe Arbuckle – andtarnished the image of Hollywood – occurred after a three-day drinking party in1921.Arbuckle was born on 24 March 1887 in Smith Center, Kansas, USA and named RoscoeConklin Arbuckle. He worked as a plumber’s assistant, then became a performer incarnivals and vaudeville – for all his enormous weight (330 lb or 21 stone) hewas incredibly agile. At the age of 21 he was hired as an extra by the SeligPolyscope Company and he made his first one-reel comedy – The Sanitarium – in1910. He was hired by Mack Sennett and made a dozen films in 1913 includingFatty’s Day Off and Fatty’s Flirtation. His attraction lay in his cherubicinnocence – the good nature that he radiated was obviously genuine. Neither, fora Hollywood star, was he unusually sex-oriented; the girls he worked with foundhim protective and ‘big brotherly’. His reputation was a great deal better, forexample, than that of his co-star Charlie Chaplin. In 1917, he moved withSennett to Jesse Lasky’s Artcraft, and wrote and directed most of his own films.He gave Buster Keaton a start in life. When he made a film for Paramount, abanner over the gate read: Welcome To The Prince Of Whales. But an all-nightparty laid on in his honour by Jesse Lasky in Boston on 6 March in 1917, almostled to scandal. Twelve party girls were paid over $1,000 for their night’s work.But some Boston resident who peered through the transom and saw Fatty strippingon a table with several girls called the police. It is alleged that Lasky,Adolph Zukor and Joseph Schenck ended by paying the district attorney and mayor$10,000 to overlook the incident.In 1921, Arbuckle signed a contract worth $3 million and he decided to celebratewith a party in the St Francis Hotel in San Francisco. He arrived from Bay Cityon the evening of Saturday 3 September 1921, and took a suite, as well as threerooms on the twelfth floor, in the unlikely event that anyone should want tosleep. By the following afternoon, the party was in full swing, with about fiftyguests, including such Hollywood cronies as Lowell Sherman and Freddy Fishback,and a number of pretty actresses. Arbuckle, separated from his wife, had askedhis friend Bambina Maude Delmont to invite a girl he particularly admired – thestarlet Virginia Rappe. The two women were staying at the nearby Palace Hotel,together with Virginia’s agent.Twenty-five-year-old Virginia Rappe was a model from Chicago, who had achievedpublic notice when her face appeared on the sheet music of ‘Let Me Call YouSweetheart’. She was a pretty, fresh-faced girl, the type Hollywood liked tocast as a milkmaid – dressed in a check frock and sunbonnet she looked theessence of female innocence. According to film-maker Kenneth Anger (in HollywoodBabylon) this appearance was misleading. ‘An offer came from Sennett, and shewent to work on his lot, taking minor parts. She also did her share of sleepingaround, and gave half the company crabs. This epidemic so shocked Sennett thathe closed down his studio and had it fumigated.’ Arbuckle had been pursuingVirginia – without success – for five years. She found him unattractive and waslater quoted as having said: ‘I’d sooner go to bed with a jungle ape than havethat fat octopus groping at me.’ But since Arbuckle was now an influentialfigure in the film world and Virginia was still an unknown starlet, she waswilling to make certain compromises to advance her career.On Labour Day, Monday 5 September 1921, the party was still going, and Virginiahad come from the Palace Hotel, accompanied by a ‘bodyguard’. Arbuckle was stilldressed in pyjamas, carpet slippers and a bathrobe. Most of the other guestswere in a similar state of déshabillé. Virginia refused champagne and accepted agin and orange. She was drinking her third – and was anxious to get to thebathroom, which seemed to be constantly occupied – when Arbuckle grabbed her andsteered her into a bedroom, winking at his friends and commenting: ‘This is whatI’ve been waiting for.’A few minutes later, there were screams from the bedroom. Suddenly, the partynoises died away. Maude Delmont went and tried the bedroom handle, calling,‘Virginia, what’s happening?’ There were more screams. Maude Delmont picked upthe telephone and called down for the manager. The assistant manager, H.J.Boyle, rushed into the suite just as the door of bedroom 1219 burst open andArbuckle appeared with Virginia’s hat perched on his head at an absurd angle. Hegave an innocent smile and did a little dance on the carpet. Back in the room,Virginia was making groaning sounds. Fatty’s good temper seemed to slip and hesaid to Maude Delmont, ‘Get her dressed and take her back to the Palace.’ Andwhen Virginia started to scream again he yelled, ‘Shut up, or I’ll throw you outof the window.’Virginia was lying on the bed, almost nude, with her clothes scattered aroundher. She was moaning, ‘I’m dying, I’m dying. He hurt me.’ They tried to dressher, but her blouse was badly torn – it had obviously been ripped from her byforce.The house doctor was sent for and Virginia was moved to another room, stillmoaning. Arbuckle seemed to feel she was ‘putting it on’, perhaps to blackmailhim into offering her a part, and snapped, ‘Shut up. You were always a lousyactress.’She was in pain for the next three days, often becoming unconscious. She wastransferred to a nursing home, where she died. The doctor who performed theautopsy discovered that her bladder was ruptured. The result was death fromperitonitis. What had happened seemed clear. Arbuckle had flung himself on herwith his full weight when she had a full bladder and it had ruptured like aballoon. When it was reported to the coroner, police interviewed hospital staffto find out who was behind the accident. The next morning newspaper headlinesall over the country talked about the orgy that had ended in rape and death.An inquest found that Arbuckle was ‘criminally responsible’ for Virginia’s deathand recommended that he should be charged with manslaughter. Even before he wenton trial in November, his career was in ruins. The fat, innocent man who madeeverybody laugh was really a ‘sex fiend’. Rumours had it that his penis was soenormous that it had ruptured her bladder. But Arbuckle’s friend Al Seminacherintroduced a note of horror when he told people that Arbuckle had used a largepiece of ice from the ice bucket to penetrate Virginia. Rumour added that he hadfirst assaulted her by introducing a champagne bottle.Church groups and women’s clubs demanded that his films should be withdrawn fromcirculation, and that unreleased films should never be shown. It was hardlynecessary. No one could laugh at Arbuckle when they remembered that thisinnocent, babylike character had torn off a girl’s clothes and raped her. A‘Fatty lynching’ mood swept the country: in Wyoming, cowboys shot up the screenof a cinema showing an Arbuckle short; in Hartford, Connecticut, women tore downthe screen.Arbuckle was released on bail. His trial began in November; he denied doing anyharm to Virginia and his lawyers did their best to suggest that she was littlebetter than a prostitute. After 43 hours deliberation, a jury was in favour ofacquitting Arbuckle by ten to two but a majority verdict was not good enough anda mistrial was declared. At his second trial, the jury found him guilty by tento two and again they were dismissed. On 12 April 1922, a third jury found himinnocent, and the foreman added: ‘Acquittal is not enough. We feel a graveinjustice has been done him and there is not the slightest proof to connect himin any way with the commission of a crime.’ Outside the court, Arbuckle toldnewsmen, ‘My innocence of the hideous charge preferred against me has beenproved.’ But it made no difference. Comedy depends upon a make-believe world inwhich no one does any real harm and everything is a joke. Fatty’s ‘rape’ hadintroduced a brutal element of reality. This was the real reason why he remainedunforgiven.The $3 million contract was cancelled and his unreleased films were suppressed.It cost the studio $1 million. His friend Buster Keaton suggested he shouldchange his name to Will B. Good. In fact, he directed a few comedy shorts underthe name of William Goodrich. He toured America’s backwoods in second-ratefarces, but some of them were booed off the stage. In 1931 he pleaded inPhotoplay: ‘Just let me work . . . I think I can entertain and gladden thepeople that see me.’ He seemed incapable of grasping that the case had somehowundermined the public’s willingness to laugh at him.He began to drink heavily: in 1931 he was arrested in Hollywood for drunkendriving. Yet in 1933, his luck seemed to be turning. Warner Brothers took therisk of hiring him to make several short comedies. But after a celebration partyin a New York hotel on 28 June 1933, he returned to his room and died of a heartattack. He was 46 years old."},{"pageContent":"ARCHER, JEFFREYTHE PERJURY SCANDALON SUNDAY 25 October 1986, the News of the World carried a headline: TORY BOSSARCHER PAYS VICE GIRL. There was a picture of a prostitute named Monica Coghlanbeing offered an envelope at Victoria Station – an envelope, according to thenewspaper, stuffed with £50 notes. The man handing it to her, Michael Stacpoole,was a close friend of the bestselling novelist Jeffrey Archer.Monica Coghlan (known by her trade name of Debbie) operated in the West End ofLondon. Six weeks earlier, on Monday 6 July 1986 an Asian lawyer named AzizKurtha had been to Monica Coghlan’s room in the Albion Hotel, near VictoriaStation, for sex, and was about to drive her back to Shepherd Market in Mayfair(where she picked up clients) when an expensive car flashed its lights at them.Debbie approached the driver, and Kurtha then recognized him as Jeffrey Archer.He beckoned to her and told her who it was. Then Debbie went back into the hotelwith the man Kurtha believed he had recognized.Kurtha had tipped off the News of the World, who tracked down Monica Coghlan andsucceeded in persuading her – though rather against her will – to take part in a‘sting’. She had telephoned Archer, with a tape recorder at her side, and toldhim that she was the woman who had picked him up in Shepherd Market. She thensaid that she had been contacted by a man who had seen them together, and whowas pressing her to give him evidence against Archer.Archer protested that she must have the wrong number, and that he did not knowher.Coghlan went on to tell him that she was being ‘hassled’ by Private Eye andKurtha and wanted them off her back.Three weeks later, on 23 October, she rang him again, and said she was stillanxious about being pressured by journalists. And Archer finally asked her:‘Would it help if you went abroad again?’ Archer went on to suggest that heshould ‘help her financially’ to go abroad. And it was then that Archer told herthat if she would stand by platform 3 on Victoria Station at eleven o’clock thenext morning, a friend of his would pass an envelope to her. She agreed, andsaid that she would make herself easy to recognize by wearing a green leathersuit.The following morning, a group of journalists were hanging around platform 3 atVictoria Station. Monica Coghlan had a radio microphone hidden in her clothes,and there were half a dozen cameramen carrying hidden cameras.Stacpool at first approached the wrong woman, but when he located Coghlan andtried to give her the envelope, she refused to take it. He persuaded her to gowith him for a drink to the Grosvenor Hotel next door, where he bumped into oneof the news reporters he happened to know well, and confided to him that he was‘here to do a favour for a very important political friend’.This was the story that appeared in the News of the World. It could be arguedthat whether or not Archer had sex with a prostitute was no business of thetabloid newspaper, but the News of the World would undoubtedly have repliedthat, since he was the deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, it waseverybody’s business.The result was that Archer lost no time in resigning.The following day, another London evening newspaper, the Star condemned the Newsof the World, declaring that ‘it looks as if Archer has been the victim of aparticularly nasty set-up job’, and said that Archer had done the honourablething in resigning so quickly. But the following Saturday, the Star came outwith its own Archer story which claimed that ‘Vice girl Monica talks aboutArcher – the man she knew.’ It seemed that Monica Coghlan’s nephew, a man calledTony Smith, had confirmed the story about Archer, and suggested that Monica andArcher had had sex – which the News of the World had been careful not to do. Italso mentioned that 90 per cent of Coghlan’s clients could demand ‘a specializedfield of sexual perversion’. ‘One of them,’ Tony Smith said, ‘wanted to bedressed up like Little Red Riding Hood, complete with suspenders. He had to betrussed up, and Monica would whip him on the floor of his room.’After the News of the World story, Archer’s solicitor Lord Mishcon had lost notime in denying that his client had slept with the prostitute. Now, Archerissued libel writs against the two newspapers.The libel action came to court early, as a special favour to Archer, who hadprotested that his political career was on hold until his name could be cleared.And by that time, Archer’s lawyers had decided that the Star should be taken tocourt first, since it had gone further than the News of the World.Meanwhile, Archer was causing his own legal team some headaches. Although hisstory was that he did not know Monica Coghlan and had never met her, he had toldAdam Raphael, the political editor of the Observer, that he had met her ‘verycasually six months ago’. In his piece, Raphael had said that ‘friends ofArcher’ had made this statement. In Sunday Today Rupert Morris had also statedthat ‘Archer has told friends that he did meet the woman once.’ So here was anobvious contradiction, which an unsympathetic judge might take to indicateArcher’s guilt.The case came to trial on Monday 6 July 1987, and lasted for three weeks.Archer’s QC, Robert Alexander, put Archer on the stand to say that he had onlyoffered Monica Coghlan money because he deeply sympathized with her plight inbeing pressured by journalists. When the Star’s QC, Michael Hill, asked Archerabout telling Adam Raphael that he had met Coghlan ‘only once, very casually,about six months ago’, Archer flatly denied that he had said so, and claimedthat ‘among forty to sixty calls he got that evening’ he could not preciselyremember the conversation.The essence of Archer’s defence lay in an alibi. On Monday 8 September 1986,Archer insisted, he had been having dinner at Le Caprice in St Martin’s Lanewith his editor Richard Cohen and Cohen’s wife Caroline. Cohen and his wife hadleft at 10:30 pm, but Archer had gone back into the restaurant to chat to otherfriends, including the businessman Henry Togna and his wife. By then, his filmagent Terence Baker had arrived, and Archer said that he and Baker sat talkinguntil around one o’clock in the morning – the time he was supposed to be in bedwith Monica Coghlan. Then, said Archer, he had given Baker a lift back to hishome in Camberwell.Baker supported this, although the defence QC suggested that he and Archer hadconcocted the story between them. Baker admitted that he had no entry in hisdiary or even a chequebook stub to support his claim. The defence also asked whythis account of the evening was so different from others in various newspapers –presumably traceable back to Archer. He had, according to the Daily Express,been ‘in the presence of 40 other people at a function and then had othermeetings . . .’ These, it was implied, were all in connection with Archer’s rolein the Tory Party. But Archer simply insisted that the ‘40 people’ had been theother people in the restaurant.There were so many weak points in Archer’s story that it looked very much as ifhe was going to lose his case.The real turning point of the trial came when Mary Archer – his wife of morethan twenty years – appeared in the witness box for the second time to refute acomment made by Monica Coghlan, to the effect that the skin on Archer’s back wasdry and spotty, something she noticed when he had undressed. Mary Archertestified that he had no spots on his back. Mary Archer had also testifiedearlier that her husband was not the kind of man to go to bed with prostitutes,and that he would probably ‘run a mile’ if he was approached by one.Mary Archer certainly made a more effective witness than Monica Coghlan, who wasforced to admit repeatedly that she had lied to Archer on the telephone,although on one occasion, she suddenly burst out at Robert Alexander: ‘You’rethe liar and he’s the liar. You’re the one that’s making vast amounts of money,not me. I’m penniless through all this. He can carry on. What’s going to happento me?’But then, Coghlan did not help her own case by denouncing her nephew, TonySmith, (quoted by the Star) as a compulsive liar and romancer.The judge, Sir Bernard Caulfield, was obviously bowled over by Mary Archer’scharm. His summing up included the following comments:> Remember Mary Archer in the witness box. Your vision of her probably will> never disappear. Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without> the strain of this trial, radiance? What is she like in physical features, in> presentation, in appearance? How would she appeal? Has she had a happy married> life? Has she been able to enjoy, rather than endure, her husband Jeffrey? Is> she right when she says to you – you may think with delicacy – ‘Jeffrey and I> lead a full life’?And he went on to say that Archer obviously had no need of ‘rubber-insulated sexin a seedy hotel round about a quarter to one after an evening at theCaprice . . .’ Obviously, the judge was reflecting that Mary Archer was so muchmore attractive than Monica Coghlan that no one in his right senses would havehad sex with the prostitute.Finally, when the foreman of the jury was asked whether they found for JeffreyArcher or the Star newspaper, the foreman replied: ‘Mr Jeffrey Archer.’ And whenthe foreman went on to say that Archer was being awarded £500,000 in damages,Archer was heard to gasp ‘whew!’It certainly looked as if Archer – who by any standards was one of the mostsuccessful men in England – had pulled off another triumph. But his position wasnot quite as secure as he thought. According to Nick Elliott, a producer atLondon Weekend Television, Archer’s chief witness, Terence Baker – the man whoclaimed he had been driven back to Camberwell by Archer in the early hours ofthe morning – admitted to him in Le Caprice restaurant that he had lied incourt, and that the truth was that he had simply left Archer outside Le Capriceat a late hour which would still have left Archer time to have sex with MonicaCoghlan.Archer’s run of luck had certainly been remarkable. Jeffrey Howard Archer wasborn on 15 April 1940 in the City of London Maternity Hospital, the son ofWilliam Archer, aged 65, and of Lola, née Cook, aged 27. William Archer, itseems, was a charming conman and a crook – a fact first revealed by MichaelCrick in his biography, Jeffrey Archer, Stranger Than Fiction (to which thischapter is indebted). According to Jeffrey Archer, his father was a colonel inthe Somerset Light Infantry who received the DCM (Distinguished Conduct Medal)during the First World War. Archer also stated that his father had once servedas British Consul in Singapore – obviously not a city that needs a Consul sinceit was a British colony.Michael Crick stumbled on the truth about William Archer when, while waiting inthe New York Public Library for the librarian to bring a book, he happened tonotice a biographical index to the New York Times, and tried looking up WilliamRobert Archer. It spoke of a divorce suit in April 1919, in which Archer’s wifeFlorence Brainerd was demanding the annulment of the marriage. Since FlorenceBrainerd was the daughter of a distinguished Washington family, Crick was ableto follow up the story in the Washington newspapers. And what he discovered wasthat Jeffrey Archer’s father had not spent the First World War in the trenches,but in America, where ‘he was exposed as a compulsive liar, an impostor and aconman, pursued by the police in three separate countries’. Archer’s firstmarriage had been to Alice Linard, whom he married at the age of 25, in 1900; heproceeded to live so lavishly that by 1908 they had been forced to sell up –whereupon Archer deserted her. Two years later, Archer was declared bankrupt.Thereupon Archer sailed to New York from which he returned as a salesman ofchewing gum. When this also failed, Archer became a mortgage broker in London,and in October 1914 was charged at the Old Bailey with a series of fraudoffences. Archer was allowed bail – of £200 – but absconded. He fled to France,got himself a passport in the name of ‘William Grimwood’ and went to America in1916.There he posed as a British Army surgeon who was recuperating from war wounds.He claimed to be a man of property, educated at Eton and Oxford. And he begancollecting money for injured allied soldiers – which, predictably, never reachedthe soldiers.Then Archer met 22-year-old Florence Brainerd, daughter of a wealthybusinessman, and persuaded her to marry him. Immediately after their honeymoon,he resumed collecting money for charity – this time for artificial limbs forwounded soldiers.Arrested in January 1917 on fraud charges, he was sentenced to three years inprison, but sent to an asylum, from which he was released after ten months. Hethen fled to Canada, where he soon appeared in a Toronto court for swindling awoman of $500 in war bonds with which he bought himself a car. Sentenced to ayear in prison, he was instead deported back to Britain.There he was promptly arrested for his earlier frauds, but escaped because oneof the chief prosecution witnesses had died in the meantime. ‘During his stay inAmerica,’ says Michael Crick, ‘scarcely a day seems to have passed without hisdevising some brilliant new plot to rob someone.’Jeffrey Archer’s mother, Lola, was the daughter of a Bristol commercialtraveller named Harold Cook, who sold ‘fancy goods’. Her mother was a teacher.Lola got herself pregnant at the age of seventeen, and gave birth to anillegitimate daughter. This baby, Wendy, was given up for adoption. At the ageof nineteen, Lola fell in love with the smooth and good-looking William Archer.Very soon, Lola was pregnant again, and in 1934, gave birth to a boy who wasnamed Jeffrey Neville. Finally, because William Archer was so unreliable, Lolawas forced to allow her son to be adopted. In 1938, Lola finally persuadedArcher to marry her, and so, two years later, Jeffrey Archer was born.In 1942, the Archers moved to Somerset, then to Weston-super-Mare, where Lolabegan working as a journalist. At 67, William Archer must presumably have beenreceiving his old age pension. The rest of the burden of supporting the familyfell on Lola. In May 1949 she became a journalist on the Weston Mercury andbegan a column called ‘Over the Tea Cups’. In her first column, she talks abouther son Jeffrey, and the problems of teaching him the value of money. Later shenicknamed him Tuppence. His regular appearances in her column may have givenArcher his first taste for publicity. It may also explain why the young Archerwas known among his school friends as a ‘bighead’.At the age of eleven he raised nearly £4 for the local scouts doing ‘bob-a-job’.Fundraising would later become one of the young Archer’s specialities.In 1951, Archer won a scholarship to Wellington School, near Taunton, althoughto begin with he hardly distinguished himself, being something of a loner, andderided by other boys as ‘the Pune’ – because of his small stature.In 1955, an interesting and possibly significant event occurred – Archer divedinto the shallow end of the swimming pool, landed on his head, and dislocatedhis neck. According to one of his friends, Michael Taudevin, this completelychanged his character. ‘Suddenly he became a man with a burning ambition. Ialways maintained that it was because he fell on his head.’He may be right. Augustus John was not a particularly good painter when he divedinto the sea and knocked himself out on a rock; after that, he became a greatpainter. But then, it might also be observed that many sex criminals havestarted their careers with a bang on the head. This includes the ‘Burning Carmurderer’ Alfred Rouse (hanged in 1931) and the more recent Gloucester massmurderer, Fred West. It is an interesting thought that Archer’s dive into theswimming pool may have had something to do with his literary talent as well aswith his sexual promiscuity.Archer suddenly began to train obsessively, and to go in for weightlifting andgymnastics. He became a first class runner. And also began to take an interestin acting. He played parts in Julius Caesar and in Moliere’s The Miser.In 1956, his father finally died at the age of eighty – as Crick remarks:‘Dependent on others and in debt.’ Archer says that his father’s death came as aconsiderable blow to him, although the evidence seems to be that they were neverclose.And in spite of his new prominence in sports and drama, Archer remainedunpopular with the other boys – one former master says ‘because of his cockinessand bumptiousness’.It is not clear what Archer did after leaving school at the age of eighteen.Archer himself claims that he went to California and gained a BA degree and thathe then went to Canada and raised half a million dollars for the YMCA. But theUniversity of California apparently has no record of Archer being enrolled onany of its campuses. Later Archer downgraded his claims to attending a summerschool at the University of California.For a brief period Archer joined the army – The Duke of Wellington’s Regiment inYorkshire – then went on to Sandhurst. There seems to be no information on whyhe left after a few months. After that he became a police constable for a shorttime in London, but left in October 1960.After these two false starts, he became a PE teacher at a private school on theedge of the New Forest, and there finally made his mark, being described by onecolleague as ‘the finest PE master I’ve seen or imagined. His energy wasabsolutely unlimited.’ But the son of the school’s owner describes him as ‘analert, pushy young man – very pushy’.His next appointment was equally successful – as a PE master at Dover Collegewhere the headmaster, Tim Cobbs, became his warm supporter. And it was partlybecause of Cobb’s help that Archer was able to move on to Oxford – not as auniversity student, but as a kind of trainee teacher trying to gain his diplomain education. Archer, of course, was not a graduate – he only had three O levels– but because of Tim Cobb’s recommendation, was accepted for theteacher-training course.At Dover College, Archer had used his talent for fundraising to good effect, andhere at Oxford – the home of Oxfam – he made even more of a mark. Beginning withan attempt to raise £25,000 for a hospital in the foothills of the Himalayas, hesoon switched his attention to a campaign called H£Million.And it was here he showed his remarkable flair for publicity. He suggested tothe organizers that they should get Oxford students involved in collecting forcharity. Then, when he was introduced to the education correspondent of theDaily Mail, he asked him whether the Daily Mail might be interested in helpingOxford students to launch a campaign to raise half a million pounds. Thecorrespondent said that it was unlikely whereupon Archer asked if it would helpif he could persuade the Beatles to support it. The correspondent,understandably, thought it would.Next, Archer sent a telegram to the Beatles’ manager, Brian Epstein, signing iton behalf of 8,000 Oxford students. Epstein was only cautiously supportive. SoArcher and the editor of the university magazine Cherwell, travelled up toMerseyside with Oxfam posters and collecting tins and went to the Empire Theatrewhere the Beatles were recording for the BBC’s programme Juke Box Jury. Somehow,they got into the Beatles’ dressing room, and persuaded them to pose for aphotograph putting money into collecting tins and holding a posterreading:’WANTED £1,000,000’.Epstein, who felt that they had been pushed into this, insisted that the Beatleswould only ‘lend their name’ to the campaign. And at this point, Archer showedhis talents as a pro by ringing Epstein and telling him that if the Beatleswould agree to come to Oxford, Harold Macmillan – the ex-prime minister – wouldattend a dinner with them. And Epstein, who wanted to meet Macmillan, promptlyagreed.Oddly enough, so did Macmillan. But the meeting was never to take place. By somemix-up, the Beatles happened to be in Florida on the day when they were supposedto come to Oxford, so although Macmillan and the Beatles both dined at Oxford –on different dates – they never actually met. But with the help of the DailyMail, the sum of a million pounds was finally achieved.The following year, Archer had another brilliant idea – flying to Washington,and persuading President Lyndon Johnson to sign a set of records of WinstonChurchill’s war speeches, which would then be auctioned. Pan Am agreed to flyArcher to Washington free, and the result was another photograph, showing Archerin the Oval Office watching Johnson sign the record album.The result of all this was that Archer’s year at Oxford was finally extended tothree, and he was elected to the Oxford Union executive committee. He spoke inseveral political debates, usually backing conservative issues but, by thattime, his relentless careerism was earning him enemies, and he was not votedback onto the Union committee.He also continued his career in sport, and was able to run the hundred yards inunder ten seconds. He became a friend of the runner Chris Chataway.It was also while at Oxford that he met a brilliant young biochemistry studentcalled Mary Weedon, and persuaded her to marry him.Archer’s next venture into fundraising proved less successful. On leaving Oxfordin 1965, he joined an organization called The National Birthday Trust, his jobbeing to raise at least £10,000 a year. The purpose of the Birthday Trust was tohelp care for mothers and babies, and to research deaths of babies at the timeof birth. Archer’s sheer enthusiasm won him the job.Unfortunately, enthusiasm was not enough, and after six months he had onlysucceeded in raising £1,374. And at the end of the year, Archer had actuallycost the charity more than £6,000. Thereupon he resigned.During that year, Archer finally managed to get his foot into Conservativepolitics. Through Chris Chataway and the Conservative central office, he becamea Conservative candidate for the Greater London Council for the outer Londonborough of Havering. And Archer’s energetic campaigning won him a seat on theGLC as Havering swung to the Conservatives.Archer was soon appointed to the Inner London Education Authority. ChrisChataway had been put in charge of ILEA, and Archer asked whether he could servehim in some way. When Chataway said yes, Archer moved himself into Chataway’soffice in County Hall and took over a desk. Asked why he had appointed Archer,Chataway replied ‘I didn’t; he appointed himself!’Almost immediately he got himself into trouble with Tory colleagues. His firstjob was to appoint governors for several hundred schools and colleges; Archer’stask was to find hundreds of Tories for the job. With only a few weeks to dothis before each governing body chose a chairman, Archer hurled himself into itwith such enthusiasm that people were soon ringing ILEA saying: ‘Get thislunatic off our backs.’ In council debates, Archer was a good speaker, but oftenso vitriolic that he made himself many enemies – particularly in Labour.He also found an interesting new way of making money. He helped his fellow Torycouncillors to claim expenses, which required endless paperwork. In exchange, heexpected 10 per cent. Soon, he had become known as ‘Mr 10 per cent’. But to thepublishers of the first edition of Michael Crick’s book about him, Archerindignantly denied that he had ever taken 10 per cent – which Crick was able toreveal as a lie.Archer was still looking for full-time employment, and soon found a niche forhis talents in the United Nations Association (UNA), a charity which acts as asupport group to the UN. Its chairman, Humphrey Berkeley, signed on Archer asfundraiser. But Archer’s first effort, a flag day, raised only a few hundredpounds more than in the previous year. However, his next attempt was moresuccessful. Archer took charge of a fundraising dinner at 10 Downing Street. Hisjob was to persuade business tycoons to come to dinner with the leaders of theLabour Party (Harold Wilson), the Conservative Party (Edward Heath) and theLiberals (Jeremy Thorpe). Archer went off to see Jack Cohen, founder of Tesco,and Olaf Kier, head of an engineering company, and returned with a cheque for£50,000 from Kier and a promise of the same amount from Cohen. (Archer wouldlater make Cohen the model for the hero of his novel As the Crow Flies.) Thedinner was a great success and raised over £200,000.Although subsequent fundraising events – charity dinners and a film premiere inLeicester Square – raised far less money, Archer decided to start his own publicrelations business, which he called Arrow Enterprises. But the United NationsAssociation showed itself unwilling to pay the 10 per cent commission thatArcher was asking.On the other hand, the European Movement which campaigned for Britain to jointhe Common Market agreed to the commission, and Archer set out to raise £50,000.The result was another dinner, this time at the Guild Hall, but also with thethree political party leaders, which led to him raising £450,000. Harold Wilsonobjected to the idea of giving Archer 10 per cent, but the European Movementgave him a flat fee which just happened to be £45,000. For 1969, that was a vastsum. It seems to have been the beginning of Archer’s fortune.From 1966 until 1969, Archer continued to try to get into parliament, andcontested five seats.On being turned down for a job as deputy to Douglas Hurd, Heath’s politicalsecretary, Archer remarked to another MP that he hadn’t decided whether ‘tobecome an MP or make a million’.At the end of 1969, Archer finally gained his constituency – Louth, inLincolnshire, not far from Grimsby.Now a sudden embarrassment arose. His previous boss, Humphrey Berkeley, hadapparently discovered that, while Archer was working for the United NationsAssociation, he was fiddling his expenses. He made the mistake of claiming thathe’d given lunch to two millionaires in the Carlton Tower Hotel on the day whenhe happened to have had lunch with Berkeley and Chris Chataway. It proved thatBerkeley had even paid the bill. The sums involved were not great, but Archerwas obliged to repay £150. When a young reporter from The Times pressed Archerabout this on a train, Archer burst into tears and begged him not to write thestory. But what appeared was short and not too embarrassing. Archer, meanwhile,was suing Humphrey Berkeley for libel, but ended up by having to pay Berkeley’slegal expenses – £17,000 – as well as his own.As a Member of Parliament Archer did not make any great impact. He was in nohurry, feeling that he probably had a seat for life. His next aim was to make alot of money – since he felt that serious politics requires a large bankbalance.Before he became an MP, he had been asked to go and see Earl Mountbatten ofBurma who asked Archer for ideas to raise funds for the United World Colleges,over which he presided. Archer, always one to think big, suggested a concert ofBob Hope and Frank Sinatra, with Noel Coward compèring. Archer went on tosuggest a simultaneous show at the Royal Festival Hall with Richard Burton,Elizabeth Taylor, and Leonard Bernstein conducting. Noel Coward fell ill, andhad to back out. As an alternative, Archer thought Princess Grace of Monacowould make a good replacement. Mountbatten rang her, and she immediately agreed.The event – which was repeated twice in one evening – was a great success; itraised about £200,000, but Archer claimed to have been paid only a flat fee of£4,000.Other events, including Bernstein conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestraat the Albert Hall, and Marlene Dietrich singing at the Drury Lane Theatre, werealtogether less successful; Archer lost badly on the latter deal. And an attemptto persuade Elvis Presley to come to England (Presley never did) and to bringthe Beatles back together for a concert both fell through.And then, Archer ran straight into the biggest disaster of his career.The basic problem seems to have been greed. Archer was looking for a way to makea vast fortune, like his friend Jim Slater, who had made money by buying upmoribund companies and then ‘asset stripping’.Archer decided to go into the stock market and make a quick killing.He had become friendly with a banker named Michael Altmann, who worked at theFirst National Bank of Boston. Altmann happened to be staying in London, not farfrom Archer’s home in The Boltons in West London, with a man called JohnKennedy, and learned that Kennedy had agreed to pay a German inventor, KurtWymann, £25,000 for the rights to a remarkable anti-pollution device for cars, avalve that would cut carbon monoxide emissions and reduce petrol consumption.The company that would market this small device – about the size of a spark plug– was called Aquablast. Hearing about this, Archer was determined to get a sliceof the action. He went on to invest large sums, some of them borrowed, inAquablast. He ended by paying out £350,000.Archer lost all this. Aquablast shares fell from 350 pence per share to 55pence, and two men would later make an appearance in court in Canada on fraudcharges, and receive prison sentences.Archer made a desperate attempt to revive his fortunes by trying once more topersuade Elvis Presley to come to England for a concert – his 10 per cent wouldhave cleared all his debts – but Presley’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, wasadamantly against it. An attempt to rent the London skyscraper, Centre Point,and then let it out floor by floor, also came to nothing. The result was that on17 May 1974, Archer was obliged to tell his wife Mary, who was seven monthspregnant with their second child, that he was on the verge of bankruptcy.The danger of bankruptcy made Archer decide to resign as an MP. But althoughArcher had no way of foreseeing it, his financial disaster was one of the bestpieces of luck he ever had.When he told a friend that he intended to write a novel to retrieve hisfortunes, the friend commented ‘Jeffrey, you can barely spell, let alone write.’‘That doesn’t matter,’ Archer replied, ‘I can tell stories.’Archer approached a friend, a TV producer named Ted Francis (who would later beinstrumental in his downfall), and asked him to sit down while he read aloudfrom a sheaf of handwritten pages.Archer’s first plan was to write a film outline, and sell it to Hollywood ortelevision. But when a film producer told him that it would stand a betterchance if he wrote it as a novel, Archer went up to Oxford to stay with Sir NoelHall, of Brasenose, and spent his days writing – a full morning’s work, a briefpub lunch, then writing until six o’clock. In the evening, he would read what hehad written to the Halls. At weekends he went back home, where his wife Marycarefully read what he’d written, and edited it.Archer tells the story of Henryk Metelski, a Jew from New York’s East Side. Hebecomes a messenger boy in Wall Street by cheating a friend out of a job. Oneday, in the washroom of a brokerage house, he picks up a cheque for $50,000.This has been dropped by a broker. And since it is Friday night, he knows thathe has the weekend to turn the money into a larger sum. He uses a tip about anoil pipeline that he has heard during the day to buy himself shares in standardoil, then uses the shares to borrow the money to repay the lady who made out thecheque. The share prices rise, as he expected, and he makes over $7,000 profit.In due course, Metelski, now calling himself Harvey Metcalfe (by coincidence,the name of the man who told Archer he could not write) goes on to become amulti-millionaire and a financial shark. As the novel begins, he has justbankrupted four ‘suckers’ who have invested money with him. The four gettogether, vowing to get their money back, ‘Not a penny more, not a penny less,’and the remainder of the book tells the story of the ‘sting’ by which they dothis. It is a remarkable, fast moving piece of writing, and reveals that,whether he can spell or not, Archer is a marvellously inventive storyteller.Archer writes with the confidence of somebody who understands the stockexchange, and has read Gustavus Myers’s History of the Great American Fortunes;the fantasy has a marvellous air of authenticity.Archer’s next piece of luck was to acquire himself a good agent – Debbie Owen,wife of the MP David Owen. Debbie Owen was about to pass Archer along to anotheragent when her husband happened to pick up the typescript, and began to chuckleas he read it.Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less did not, as is often claimed, turn Archerinto an immediate millionaire. The American publisher Doubleday only paid anadvance of $12,000. A number of foreign publishers bought the book fromDoubleday for translation. But British publishers showed themselves lessinterested, and many turned it down. Finally, it was taken by Tom Maschler, ofJonathan Cape, who had been responsible for turning Catch 22 and the novels ofJohn Fowles into bestsellers. But Cape paid an advance of only £3,000. ThenWarner Brothers bought the film rights of the book for £125,000. And at last, itbegan to look as if Archer was slowly fighting his way out of debt. (Typically,he claimed that it had made him a millionaire.)Nevertheless, Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less did reasonably well. Then aCanadian businessman who had heard the story of Archer’s financial disastertelephoned him to offer him the use of his luxury home in Barbados, where hecould begin to write his next novel. This was Shall We Tell the President? andwas about a date in the future when Teddy Kennedy has become president, andthere is a plot to assassinate him. Obviously indebted to Frederick Forsyth’sDay of the Jackal, about a plot to kill General de Gaulle, Shall We Tell thePresident? has the same kind of feeling of authenticity as that novel. Archerobviously has an immense appetite for facts.Nevertheless, neither of these first two novels had made him a fortune or becomebestsellers. He decided to remedy this with his next novel, Kane and Abel, thestory of two businessmen, born on the same day, William Kane, from Boston, andAbel Rosnovski, born in poverty in Poland. Published in England in September1979, it reached the top of the Sunday Times bestseller list within two weeks,and went on to have the same kind of success in America, where it spent 29 weekson the New York Times bestseller list. At last, Archer was wealthy.He bought the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, associated with Rupert Brooke’s famouspoem, and there wrote a play based on a murder trial, although it was severalyears before it was produced. Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less was serializedby BBC television in seven parts, with Archer as the narrator. At last, in 1981,Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less reached the bestseller list.Now he was rich again, Archer decided to get back into politics – but not as alowly Member of Parliament. He became a very popular speaker at fundraisingauctions and Tory dinners. But when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announcedthat Archer was one of her favourite authors, alongside John Le Carré andFrederick Forsyth, it was obvious that he was destined for better things.One person who stood in the way of promotion – even a possible peerage – was theTory Party’s deputy leader, William Whitelaw, who remembered Humphrey Berkeley’sreport of 1969 and the libel trial that followed. Whitelaw is reported to havesaid that Archer would be promoted ‘over his dead body’. But at this point, toeveryone’s astonishment, Berkeley himself showed a forgiving spirit, and wroteto Mrs Thatcher saying that if she decided to give Archer a job, he wouldcertainly not object. And in September 1985, Margaret Thatcher telephoned Archerto offer him the post of Deputy Chairman of the Tory Party. This was obviously amajor step on the way to a peerage.In fact, Archer was not a particularly good Deputy Chairman. He was a little toofrank, and prone to put his foot in it. He referred to Lord Gowrie, who had justresigned from the Cabinet, as a ‘wally’ and advised unemployed young men to ‘getoff their backsides and find a job’, comparing their situation unfavourably withthe determination that had rescued him from bankruptcy.Another problem was his increasing reputation for promiscuity. According toCrick, ‘Archer had started being unfaithful to Mary within a few years of theirmarriage in 1966. One friend recalls how in the early 1970s Archer would borrowhis London flat for one-night stands. Then in the early 1970s, Archer began alengthy affair with Andrina Colquhoun, who tried unsuccessfully to persuade himto leave his wife.’ (To his credit, Archer replied ‘No, marriage is for life.’)Then, in 1986, came the bombshell of the News of the World story about MonicaCoghlan, and Archer offering her enough money to leave the country. And afterAdam Raphael had admitted at the libel trial that Archer had told him that hehad met the prostitute – although not slept with her – there were few peopleleft who did not believe that Archer was guilty. And when Archer not onlyemerged triumphant, but with another half a million pounds, many people thoughtthat his luck was just getting too good to last.Nevertheless, it did. And when Mrs Thatcher ran into leadership problems in 1990and was forced to resign, Archer appeared in her resignation honours list.Although Archer failed to get his peerage when the list was vetted by thePolitical Honours Scrutiny Committee, he was finally made Lord Archer in June1992, when the new Prime Minister, John Major, made him a Conservative workingpeer. Archer chose the title Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare of Mark.In 1994, Archer found himself in the centre of another storm. This one was aboutshares in Anglia Television, of which his wife had been a director since 1987.In November 1993, the National Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke, announced thatin 1994 companies could own two major ITV franchises, provoking sudden takeoverfever.On 13 January 1994, Archer telephoned a stockbroker named Simon Wharmby, andasked about buying some Anglia Television shares. Wharmby was able to buy him25,000 shares at 485 pence. Apparently Archer had explained that he was buyingthe shares for somebody else. The following day Archer bought another 25,000shares at the same price.On Tuesday 18 January the media group MAI made a bid for Anglia Television, andthe share price increased to 637 pence, a rise of 152 pence a share. Archerimmediately instructed Wharmby to sell – the deal had made a profit of £77,219.Since the timing looked just too convenient, the stockbroker had to refer it tohis directors. And at a board meeting, a member of staff asked whether anyonerealized that Mary Archer was director of Anglia Television.Six days later, the man Archer claimed he was buying the shares for, BrooskSaib, deposited a cheque for the £77,000 profit into an account in west London.The question, of course, was one of ‘insider dealing’ – the deliberate use ofinside information to make a profit.There was no reason why this story should ever have become public knowledge,except that a freelance journalist called Martin Tompkinson received a tip offand investigated the story, quickly discovering that Mary Archer was a directorof Anglia, and that the company had recently been taken over by MAI.The result was more bad publicity for Archer. Archer told a journalist who ranghim about the story: ‘It is completely untrue. I did not buy any shares.’ Headded ‘That sort of accusation is libellous.’ At that time, Archer was ridinghigh, tipped to become the new Conservative Party Chairman.When, in August that year, the full story of the buying of the Anglia sharesfinally emerged, Archer hastened to admit publicly that he had made a ‘graveerror’. He continued to insist that the deals had not been made with the help ofany inside information from his wife, but admitted that it was a mistake to havebought the shares when his wife was a director. The Department of Trade andIndustry (DTI) had decided by then that no further action would be taken.When, in 1997, the Blair Labour government decided that London should have aMayor, Archer’s name was mentioned as a Conservative contender. Since KenLivingstone was also regarded as a likely choice, most people did not think agreat deal of Archer’s chances. But Archer obviously felt that becoming Mayor ofLondon, like Dick Whittington, would be an appropriate climax for his politicalcareer.It was at this point – in April 1998 – that Michael Crick, the author of theArcher biography, felt that Archer ought to be opposed. He writes: ‘True, therehad been plenty of damning details in the first edition of this book, but itsscope had been restricted by the laws of libel. I knew there was plenty moreabout Archer’s dishonesty and criminal behaviour that would inevitably emergeduring a full election campaign.’ So Crick wrote to his old friend WilliamHague, whom he’d known since university days, to say that ‘In my view Archer isa much sleazier character than (Jonathan) Aitken or (Neil) Hamilton or any ofthe other miscreants of recent times.’ Crick went on, ‘I can think of at leasthalf a dozen incidents in Archer’s career when people have made seriousallegations about his behaviour, but the evidence was insufficient for me topublish.’Four weeks later, his letter having been politely brushed aside, Crick heardfrom Ted Francis, the television producer to whom Archer had read the firstversion of Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less. Francis told Crick how, inJanuary 1987, Archer had invited him for dinner at Sambuca, an Italianrestaurant in Sloane Square, and suddenly dropped into the conversation thecomment: ‘I want you to have had dinner with me here on 9 September.’ Francissaid that he laughed and said: ‘Oh, all right, Jeffrey, if you say so.’ ‘Then,’said Francis, ‘he asked me: “Will you write a letter to my lawyer saying we haddinner on that evening and stayed quite late?” I said, “Hang on, Jeffrey, Imight tell a fib for you but I’m not going to commit perjury. I won’t stand upin a court and say this.”’But when Archer explained that he had, in fact, been having dinner with AndrinaColquhoun on that day, Francis happily agreed to the request as a personalfavour. ‘I knew for a fact that he and Mary had a falling out over Andrina andMary said: “It’s her or me.”’In due course Ted Francis wrote to Lord Mishcon explaining that Archer and hehad eaten dinner together on Tuesday 9 September and that the dinner terminatedat approximately 9:45 pm.Early the following month, Archer agreed to lend Francis £25,000 for an EnidBlyton project. But when the contract came, the amount mentioned was only£20,000 – although Archer had made it clear that he would not expect this back.In fact, the amount that Francis finally received was only £12,000.Another cause of resentment was that at one of Archer’s parties, as Francis wastalking to the actress Susan George, Archer walked up to them and said in a loudvoice: ‘Oh you wanna watch this fellow. I lent him £20,000 and I’m still waitingfor it to come back.’Michael Crick and Ted Francis met for lunch in a pub, and discussed how thestory of the fake alibi might be used to destroy Archer’s chances of becomingMayor.In fact, Francis seems to have decided to go it alone after that meeting. Herang up the publicist Max Clifford who contacted the News of the World. Theyagreed to pay about £17,000 for the story, of which £5,000 would go to two ofFrancis’s favourite charities, £2,000 to cover his expenses, and the rest to buya second-hand car.What happened then was almost a repetition of the ‘sting’ with Monica Coghlan.Francis rang Archer with the News of the World reporter at his side taping theconversation. Francis declared that Crick knew all about the alibi story. Archerasked how, and Francis said: ‘I’ve no idea.’The following evening, Francis again rang Archer, claiming that Crick had gothold of a credit card receipt showing that Francis had, in fact, been staying atthe Grand Hotel in Brighton on the night of Tuesday 9 September 1986 – theevening he was supposed to be eating with Archer at the Sambuca. Archer saidthat didn’t matter because he had indeed been eating at the Sambuca thatevening.Forty minutes later, Francis rang back again. Archer said that he had nowconsulted his lawyer Lord Mishcon, and that ‘He says as long as you say nothing,they’ve got nothing.’By coincidence, on the Friday before the story was due to appear, the News ofthe World editor Phil Hall received a call from Jeffrey Archer inviting him toArcher’s Christmas party. He said he would love to come, but asked whether hecould go and see Archer immediately. At that meeting, Phil Hall told Archerabout the story they were going to publish on Sunday. When Hall had finishedexplaining, Archer took off his glasses and said: ‘Oh my God, this is going tobe so damaging.’It was at this point that Archer realized that he had to resign as mayoralcandidate.The Tory leader William Hague was told about Archer’s troubles. He consultedwith the Party Chairman, Michael Ancram, who agreed that Archer would have toresign. So when Archer rang Hague later that evening asking for another chance,Hague told him sternly that he would expect his resignation by the followingmorning.Hague’s own advisor, Stephan Shakespeare, reportedly told Archer: ‘Theestablishment and the media hate you, but ordinary people won’t condemn you.’This was undoubtedly a misjudgement. Shakespeare was underestimating the extentto which most people felt impatient with Archer after the Anglia affair andother scandals, so there was a genuine widespread desire to see him get his‘comeuppance’. William Hague made it clear that his own patience was at an end.‘Jeffrey Archer has let the Party down and there can be no question of himcontinuing as our candidate.’On the following Monday morning Hague summoned Archer to Central Office, andArcher was stripped of the Conservative Whip in the Lords. In fact, Hague hadgood reason for annoyance – the previous June, when the matter of Archer’scandidacy for Mayor was being discussed, Michael Ancram had asked him whetherthere were any ‘substantial and damaging allegations’ that were stilloutstanding, and had been assured that there were not. When reporters gatheredaround the gate at the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, it was Stephan Shakespearewho told them, ‘He’s extremely upset, extremely sorry, couldn’t be more sorry.He’s on the floor.’ Mary Archer was quoted as saying: ‘We are all human andJeffrey manages to be more human than most.’On 3 May 2001 Archer appeared at Bow Street Magistrate’s Court to face fivecharges of perverting the course of justice and perjury. He was granted bail.On 30 May the perjury trial began. Monica Coghlan, who was to have been calledas a witness, had in fact been killed as a result of a car accident on 27 April2001, when a fleeing robber, who had already hijacked two cars, collided withMonica Coghlan’s car in Huddersfield, Yorkshire.The accusation of attempting to pervert the course of justice arose from thefact that Archer had told his secretary, Angela Peppiatt, to make a bogusappointments diary that could be shown at the earlier libel trial. Peppiatt wasso concerned that she made photocopies of the entries in the bogus diary andkept the original. She had been told to insert a list of appointments for theevening of 8 September 1986, the night he was supposed to have slept with MonicaCoghlan. However, due to an error, Archer was accused of picking up theprostitute the following evening, Tuesday 9 September. The QC for theprosecution, David Waters, said, ‘You may think it is not an exaggeration to saythat had the jury seen that entry, putting it as its lowest, it would have had asignificant impact on the outcome of the trial.’The court was also told that during the first libel action, Archer was having anaffair and was cheating on both his wife and his lover. The jury was told thatArcher had a string of extra-marital affairs, including one that took place inNigeria, and it was not unusual for him to ask friends to provide alibis tocover his infidelities from his wife. The jury was also told that Archer did notfulfil his promise to donate all of his £500,000 Star libel award to charity.On 29 June, Lady Archer entered the witness box and flatly denied Mrs Peppiatt’sallegation that she and her husband had been leading separate lives for sometime before the period leading up to the libel trial.Archer undoubtedly damaged his own case by deciding to remain silent at thetrial, inevitably creating the impression that he was unable to produce anadequate defence against the charges.Summing up on 7 July 2001, Archer’s counsel Nicolas Purnell QC conceded thatArcher may have been ‘a bloody fool’ for attempting to cover up his liaison withAndrina Colquhoun, but he was not a criminal.On 13 July, Archer received the news that his mother Lola had died, aged 87. Onthe same day, the jury retired to consider its verdict on two counts of perjuryand three counts of perverting the course of justice.On Thursday 19 July 2001, Archer was found guilty of perjury and perverting thecourse of justice, and sentenced to four years in prison. He was ordered to pay£175,000 costs.Archer began his sentence at Belmarsh jail in south London, was subsequentlytransferred to Wayland Prison in Cambridgeshire, a category C jail, and then toNorth Sea Bank, an open category D prison near Skegness, in Lincolnshire. Where,the newspaper reports said, ‘He will have a key to his cell and the tang of seaair in his nostrils.’Another newspaper report of the time stated that Archer would repay the £500,000libel damages he received from the Star, plus interest, bringing the sum up tovery nearly £3,000,000. Another report said that Archer would be repaying theNews of the World the £50,000 damages and £30,000 costs it incurred at the libeltrial.Sir Bernard Caulfield, the judge whose lyrical outburst about Mary Archer hadprobably swayed the jury in Archer’s favour in 1987, was spared theembarrassment of seeing the novelist’s downfall – he had died in October 1994."},{"pageContent":"BYRON, LORD‘MAD, BAD AND DANGEROUS TO KNOW’NOT LONG AFTER the death of Lord Byron in Greece in April 1824, two of hisclosest friends – Tom Moore and John Cam Hobhouse – met at the office of hispublisher John Murray to decide what ought to be done with the poet’s memoirs.The vote went against Moore, who wanted to preserve them, and they wereconsigned to the office fire.What was in them that shocked Murray and Hobhouse so much? It may have been theadmission that he had slept with at least two hundred whores, or that he hadcommitted incest with his half-sister and fathered her child, or that he hadsodomized his wife, or simply that he found boys as sexually enjoyable as girls.But although the memoirs are lost to us, the researches of biographers haveuncovered most of Byron’s scandalous secrets.Byron’s father, ‘Mad Jack’, was a notorious rake and gambler; he ran away with amarried woman, the Marchioness of Carmarthen, who died six years later afterpresenting him with three children, two of whom died young. Then ‘Mad Jack’married a plump and plain Scottish heiress, Catherine Gordon, who (like theMarchioness) was at first able to keep him in the style to which he wasaccustomed. But he soon spent her £23,000. On 28 January 1788, the poet GeorgeGordon, Lord Byron, was born. ‘Mad Jack’ deserted his wife soon after and diedin France three years later, possibly by committing suicide.The boy’s childhood was miserable; he had a deformed right foot and hisschoolfriends made fun of his limp. The attempts of various doctors to ‘cure’ itcaused him a great deal of agony but made no difference whatever. Even hismother sometimes jeered at him as a ‘lame brat’ – she seems to have been subjectto violent changes of mood, which laid the foundation of his lifelong mistrustof women. He took refuge from reality in books, preferring history and storiesof the Mediterranean. When he was nine he had his first sexual experience with ayoung servant girl named Mary Gray. She seems to have been a nymphomaniac: whenshe was not introducing the shy boy to the delights of nakedness, she was givingherself to a succession of lovers, often with Byron looking on. It seemsdoubtful that he lost his virginity with her but she made him aware that he wasattractive to women. Mary threatened him with hellfire if he told anyone theirsecret – as his biographer Frederic Raphael remarks: ‘Cant and cunt revealedtheir proximity very early in Byron’s life.’Byron became next in line for the title when he was six and his cousin waskilled in battle. He inherited on the death of his grandfather, when he was ten,and he and his mother moved to the decrepit and gloomy Newstead Abbey, nearNottingham, a picturesque ruin that was the ideal setting for a romantic poet.For the next four years he attended Harrow School and was probably introduced tohomosexuality. He was in love with his cousin Mary Parker, and also with aneighbour, Mary Chaworth – but this feeling turned to hatred when he heard MaryChaworth ask her maid, ‘What, do you think I could feel anything for that lameboy?’ His mother meanwhile had been forced to rent Newstead to a certain LordGrey de Ruthyn, a 23-year-old rake who pursued Byron’s mother and even madehomosexual advances to Byron himself when he was home during the holidays.(Byron fled in terror – his own homosexual inclinations were always directedtowards those younger than himself.)Byron’s real sexual initiation began when he went to Cambridge in 1805, where hebegan to frequent prostitutes with such vigour that even a French procuress hadto advise him to season ardour with delicacy (i.e. be less rough). He had alsorenewed his acquaintance with his half-sister Augusta, who had married a ColonelGeorge Leigh and had a fine house near Cambridge. Byron fell in love with achoirboy named Edleston, whom he saved from drowning, but he later insisted thathis friendship was ‘pure’ – a clear hint that others of the same type were not.He began to put on weight; he had always been inclined to fleshiness, and soonweighed sixteen stones. For a man of his vanity this was intolerable and hestarved himself and played cricket wearing half a dozen waistcoats to induceperspiration.At this time he published his earliest poems but they were reviewed sounfavourably that he thought for a while of killing himself. However, instead hewrote a satire in the manner of Pope called English Bards and Scotch Reviewers,which gave him a certain reputation. Before leaving Cambridge, Byron hadacquired his first mistress, a girl called Caroline, whom he liked to dress inboy’s clothes and pass off as a male.At the age of 21, he went off on his first tour of the Mediterranean with hisfriend Hobhouse, who was planning a book called Sodomy Simplified, or PederastyProved to be Praiseworthy. They visited Greece, Albania, Turkey and Spain, andwhen Hobhouse left him alone in Greece, Byron took the opportunity to enjoy asentimental and impure friendship with a boy name Nicolo, who was fifteen. Healso spent a great deal of money on prostitutes. One day his curiosity wasaroused by a cart containing a sack that was wriggling; he bribed the driver toopen it and found that it was a woman who had been condemned to be thrown intothe sea for infidelity to her husband. Byron is said to have recognized her asone of the women he had slept with. He succeeded in smuggling her out of harm’sway.Back in England in 1812, Byron was deeply moved by the death of his mother. Helater made his maiden speech in the House of Lords, supporting the Nottinghamweavers who had smashed the mechanical frames that were putting them out ofwork. A few weeks later, John Murray published the poem that Byron had writtenduring his period abroad: Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage. This gloomy and romanticpiece of work, about a young man who has tasted every forbidden pleasure in hisearly twenties and finds life an intolerable bore, made him famous overnight.Suddenly, Byron was the social success of the season. Young girls regarded himwith adoration; young men imitated his brooding silence, his melancholy frowns,even his limp.One of the women who learned Childe Harold by heart was a beautiful and wilfulyoung married woman named Lady Caroline Lamb, the wife of the politician WilliamLamb (later Lord Melbourne). She declared in her journal that Byron was ‘mad,bad and dangerous to know’, and added: ‘That beautiful pale face is my fate.’Soon, Byron was a regular visitor at Melbourne House and the two became lovers.But his attitude towards her remained detached and ironical, and he greatlypreferred her mother-in-law, Lady Melbourne, who became a close friend. Byron’sindifference drove Lady Caroline to desperation; on one occasion, she disguisedherself as a page boy and hid in Byron’s carriage. Such exploits amused him buthe grew increasingly tired of her waywardness and of a certain lack ofprudishness – on one occasion she sent him some of her pubic hairs as akeepsake. When – with the help of Lady Melbourne – he broke off the affair, sheburned his image in effigy. Byron fled to Cambridge and his half-sister Augusta,whose husband was away hunting. No doubt seduced by the idea of incest as muchas by Augusta’s attractions, Byron began an affair with her. He had also allowedhimself to be seduced by the promiscuous Lady Oxford, whose children were knownas the Harleian Miscellany because of their doubtful paternity (her husband’sfamily name was Harley). After an abortive affair with the wife of a friend –whom he decided to spare at the last moment – he and Augusta went to Newsteadand she became pregnant. By way of flaunting his triumph, he inserted the incesttheme into his latest novel in verse, The Bride of Abydos.Byron, having been the darling of London society, was now its chief source ofmalicious gossip. Caroline Lamb was still pursuing him and the affair withAugusta had become known largely through the lack of discretion of both parties.He decided that it was time to silence the gossip by marrying. Lady Melbourne’sniece, an heiress named Annabella Milbanke, had already turned him down once,wounding his vanity; she was prim, serious-minded and demure. Rather to Byron’sdismay, she accepted him the second time he proposed.A character as spoiled and undisciplined as Byron was bound to be thrown intotorments and ambivalence by marriage. In the carriage, on the way to theirhoneymoon (or ‘treacle-moon’, as Byron preferred to call it) he set out to makeher miserable by assuring her that he was bound to hate anyone he married. Buttheir first sexual experiment – on a settee before dinner – seems to have beensuccessful. Annabella was totally inexperienced – it seems probable that she hadnever even been instructed in what lovers do in bed – and the evidence indicatesthat she came to accept sodomy as a perfectly normal variant of sexualintercourse. At first, Byron seems to have found marriage unexpectedly pleasant.But his natural gloom and self-pity, his determination to be unconventional, hisobscure conviction that he was somehow ‘accursed’, made his temper uncertain. Heflirted openly with his half-sister and was frequently drunk. And Annabella’sdemure virtue irritated him. Soon she was pregnant and that must have increasedhis feeling of being trapped. They moved to London although this was anextravagance they could not afford and the bailiffs became frequent visitors.His attempts to keep his weight within normal limits increased his irritability;sexual abstention may also have played its part – although later gossip statedthat he continued to sodomize his wife until late into her pregnancy. The birthof a daughter was a disappointment; Byron had wanted an heir. Exhausted by alaborious birth and by quarrels with her husband, Annabella decided to go hometo mother to recuperate. The separation was probably not intended to bepermanent – certainly not as far as she was concerned. The deciding factor wasprobably her admission to her mother that Byron enjoyed anal intercourse. SirRalph and Lady Milbanke were undoubtedly what would now be called ‘squares’, andonce Annabella had admitted to an act of ‘criminal perversion’ with a man whowas reputed to be his sister’s lover, nothing would have induced them to allowher to return to him. (In fact, Byron made some attempts at reconciliation.)It is still not clear why the end of Byron’s marriage caused him to becomesuddenly the most vilified man in London – Regency London was not the mostvirtuous place in the world. The answer is probably a combination of rumour –about incest, sodomy and so on – and envy. The desire to see idols hurledviolently from their pedestals is strong in all human beings. Byron had been oneof the most successful literary men of all times; poems like The Corsair, TheBride of Abydos, The Giaour were the nineteenth-century equivalent ofbestsellers. He had a reputation as a seducer of other men’s wives. He was toosuccessful. So London hostesses decided that it was time the wicked Lord wasostracized. If Byron had remained in England and ignored the disapproval, hisnext successful poem would probably have made society change its mind. But hewas too moody and self-centred to endure the least suspicion of a snub. Ifsociety despised him, he would show that he despised society. He ordered anelaborate coach, costing £500, had one last fling with a young girl calledClaire Clairmont, the step-daughter of the social philosopher William Godwin(whose daughter Mary was about to run away with another poet, Shelley), and inApril 1816 left England for the last time. The casual one-night stand withClaire eventually resulted in the birth of a daughter.Claire reappeared in Switzerland, together with Shelley and Mary. When Shelleymildly reproached Byron for seducing Claire, Byron replied that no one had beenmore carried off than ‘poor dear me’ – he had been ravished more often thananyone since the Trojan War. He really believed this.In Venice, Byron took lodgings in the house of a draper and quickly seduced hiswife Marianna, whose appetite was so strong that Byron had to make love threetimes a day. Then he met a pretty 22-year-old peasant, Margarita Cogni, when hewas out riding, and had soon persuaded her into his bed. In January 1818 he wasasked to escort a young married woman – recently out of a convent – TeresaGuiccioli, to an art exhibition; she also became his mistress. The sale ofNewstead (for £94,500) enabled him once more to live in the style he enjoyed andhe rented a palazzo and moved Margarita in. Then, in the words of FredericRaphael, ‘he embarked on an orgy to challenge even the Venetian capacity toremain unshocked’. The Palazzo Mocigeno became virtually a brothel. WhenMargarita began to learn to read so that she could keep track of his amoursthrough his letters, he decided to get rid of her. She threatened him with aknife and stabbed his hand, then threw herself into the canal. After that, Byronfirmly put her out-of-doors and she returned to her husband.Teresa, the girl he had taken to the art exhibition, was Byron’s last greataffair. Even in his early thirties, he was growing fat and his hair was recedingfast; he began to feel the need for a more relaxed and domesticated existence.Teresa was nineteen, her husband, Count Alessandro Guiccioli, 58. The Count wasreputed to be a dangerous man who had poisoned his first wife and murdered thenovelist Manzoni. But it was tacitly understood that when a teenager from aconvent marries a man nearly forty years her senior, he cannot expect permanentfidelity; in fact, one lover – or cavaliere servente – was thoroughlyrespectable. When, at one point, her husband protested about Byron, she repliedindignantly: ‘It is hard that I should be the only woman in Romagna who is notto have her amico.’ The problem was that Teresa was nearly as indiscreet asCaroline Lamb and Byron was tactless enough to get mixed up in Italian politics.Eventually, the Count and Countessa separated; Byron found, to his disgust, thathe was expected to be a substitute husband rather than an amico. She evenordered him to cease working on Don Juan which she detested. But he was gettingolder and no longer so disposed to revolt against anything that looked likeconventionality. A flash of the old Byron appeared when he told Hobhouse aproposTeresa, ‘Cain was right to kill Abel, that he might not have the bore of passingtwo hundred years with him.’ The death of his daughter (with Claire Clairmont)Allegra – from fever – and the death of Shelley by drowning made Byron feel thathe needed a change from Italy. And so, with the accompaniment of noisy tearsfrom Teresa, he set off for Greece where, instead of fighting for freedom, as hehad intended, he succumbed to a combination of boredom, non-stop rain and fever,and died in his 37th year."},{"pageContent":"CAROLINE, QUEENTHE ONLY BRITISH QUEEN TO BE TRIED FOR ADULTERYIT IS SOMETHING of a mystery why the Prince of Wales, the son of King GeorgeIII, agreed to marry the fat, ugly and tactless Caroline of Brunswick. It istrue that he did it largely to persuade Parliament to pay his enormous debts.But he could have married the queen’s niece, the beautiful and talented Louiseof Mecklenburg-Strelitz. His marriage to Caroline was a disaster for everyone.George Augustus Frederick, the Prince of Wales, was born in August 1762.Determined that his son would grow up virtuous and serious-minded, George IIIhad him brought up far from the court, according to a strict academic andphysical regimen. It had the opposite effect: the prince became a rebel, aspendthrift and a waster. At the age of seventeen he embarked on an affair withan actress, Mary Robinson, and his letters to her had to be bought backeventually for £5,000. The prince became a member of a hard-drinking,hard-gambling set, which included the Whig politician Charles James Fox – one ofhis father’s chief enemies – and the playwright Sheridan. He began to run upvast debts. He voted for Fox – and against his father – when Fox’s India Billcame before Parliament but the Whig politician lost and was dismissed. When hewas 23, the prince fell in love with the beautiful Catholic, Mrs Fitzherbert,and although she fled to France to escape his attentions, he finally persuadedher to go through a secret marriage. But constancy was not one of his strongpoints and he soon took another mistress, Lady Jersey.By the time he was thirty, the prince was an embarrassment to his father andintensely unpopular with the British public. His debts now amounted to £630,000– many millions in present-day terms – and Pitt’s administration showed noeagerness to find the money. So when it was suggested by his father that heshould marry and furnish an heir, he agreed on condition that Parliament paidhis debts.Caroline of Brunswick was short, plump and ugly, and she suffered from bodyodour – probably as a result of infrequent washing. Lady Jersey, the prince’scurrent mistress, may have pushed him into marrying Caroline rather than thebeautiful Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz as she would be less of a rival. On 5April 1795, at St James’s Palace, the prince was introduced to Caroline; he wasshattered. He staggered to the far end of the room and called for a brandy. Hewent on drinking brandy for three days until the marriage ceremony. On thehoneymoon – with Lady Jersey also in attendance – he seems to have done his dutyas a husband for Caroline discovered she was pregnant soon thereafter. But theprince found her unbearable and stayed as far away from her as possible; in thefollowing year he wrote her a letter saying that ‘our inclinations are not inour power’, but that being polite to one another was. When she received theletter, Queen Caroline was with the politician George Canning and asked him whathe thought it meant; Canning replied that it seemed to give her permission to doas she liked. Whereupon Queen Caroline proceeded to do just that with Canning.What no one realized at the time was that the royal line of Hanover sufferedfrom the disease known as porphyria, the ‘royal disease’, a genetic disorder inwhich, due to an enzyme defect, the body accumulates large quantities ofporphyrins (precursors of red blood pigment). The disease affects the digestivetract, the nervous system, the circulatory system and the skin; it causespsychotic disorders and epilepsy. George III had several attacks of it and diedinsane. The Prince of Wales was also subject to it and so was Caroline – two ofher brothers were imbeciles, probably due to porphyria. It may explainCaroline’s utter lack of self-control and her tendency to behave outrageouslywhich led many to suspect she was insane.Rejected by her husband she retired to a house in Blackheath and behaved in amanner that led Lady Hester Stanhope to call her ‘a downright whore’. She had aChinese clockwork figure in her room which, when wound up, performed grosssexual movements; she was also given to dancing around in a manner that exposeda great deal of her person.In 1806, rumours that a four-year-old child in her entourage, William Austin,was her illegitimate son, led to what became known as ‘the DelicateInvestigation’. A Royal Commission repudiated the charge and found Lady Douglas,who had started the rumour, guilty of perjury. But years later, Caroline toldher lawyer’s brother that the child was the natural son of Prince LouisFerdinand of Prussia, who had always been her love. Mrs Fitzherbert was to statelater that Caroline had secretly married Prince Louis before she married thePrince of Wales.Finally, in August 1814, Caroline decided to leave England. In Geneva, at a ballgiven in her honour, she shocked her hosts by dancing naked to the waist. InNaples she became the mistress of King Joachim, Napoleon’s brother-in-law. Whenshe left Naples – at the time Napoleon escaped from Elba – she had with herNapoleon’s courier, a coarsely handsome Italian named Bartolomeo Bergami, aformer quartermaster in a regiment of hussars. This swarthy, bearded, intenselymasculine character looked like a brigand from a Drury Lane play. He travelledwith her to Munich, Tunis, Athens, Constantinople and Jerusalem, and when theysettled in her villa near Pesaro they behaved as man and wife.James Brougham, her lawyer’s brother, now wrote to England suggesting that theprince – he was now Prince Regent (his father having become insane) – shouldobtain a legal separation from Caroline so she could never become queen ofEngland. But the prince wanted divorce or nothing. So nothing came of thissuggestion.George III finally died in January 1820 and his son became George IV. Carolineof Brunswick was now Queen Caroline. The government quickly offered her £50,000a year if she would agree not to return to England. In a fury, Caroline hurriedacross the Channel. Her husband was one of the most unpopular men in the countryand on that count many people espoused her cause. To the intense embarrassmentof the government, she settled at Brandenburg House, in Hammersmith. And on 17August the government took the offensive by hauling her in front of the House ofLords. Its aim was to dissolve the marriage on the grounds that Caroline hadengaged in ‘a most unbecoming and degrading intimacy’ with Bergami, ‘a foreignerof low station’. But the government had bitten off more than it could chew.Noisy mobs demonstrated in favour of Caroline and the House of Lords had to besurrounded by two strong timber fences. The queen’s coach was always surroundedby a cheering crowd. After 52 days the divorce clause was carried. But theoratory of Henry Brougham caused a turn in the tide and when the Bill was givenits final reading, it had only a pathetic majority of nine. The Lords decided todrop it.The coronation was scheduled for 29 April 1821. The queen wrote to the PrimeMinister, Lord Liverpool, to ask what kind of a dress she ought to wear for thecoronation. He replied that she could ‘form no part of that ceremony’. But whenGeorge was crowned, Caroline arrived at the Abbey dressed in a muslin slip anddemanded to be admitted. When she shouted, ‘The queen – open!’, pages opened thedoors. She continued with ‘I am the queen of England.’ An official roared, ‘Doyour duty, shut the Hall door’, and the door was slammed in her face. Undaunted,Caroline drove back to Brandenburg House and sent a note to the king asking fora coronation ‘next Monday’.She died two weeks later, on 7 August 1821 – so suddenly that it was widelyrumoured that she had been poisoned. When her body was on its way to the shipthat would take it back to Brunswick, there were riots at Kensington Church,bricks were thrown, and two men were shot by the Life Guards. Caroline wasburied in Brunswick Cathedral, with an inscription on her coffin: The InjuredQueen of England.George IV remained intensely unpopular. He lived on for only nine years afterthe death of Caroline. The major issue of the time was Roman Catholicemancipation (England had been anti-Catholic since the time of Elizabeth I andGeorge I had come to the throne of England from Hanover because of the Act thatprevented a Catholic from becoming king of England). As Prince of Wales, Georgehad been in favour of Wellington who, as prime minister, carried the act ofParliament that finally achieved Catholic emancipation (although Wellington washimself basically opposed to it, believing it would finally destroy English rulein Ireland – as it did). George IV became hysterical about the issue andthreatened to use the royal veto. But the throne no longer held the politicalpower it had under George III, and he was reluctantly forced to accept Catholicemancipation. After that, the king’s health deteriorated swiftly and he died on26 June 1830. He had a portrait of Mrs Fitzherbert round his neck on his deathbed. But the two had been estranged for many years – ever since, at a dinner inhonour of Louis XVIII in 1803, he had made sure there was no fixed place for herat table, so she must sit ‘according to her rank’. After that insult, she hadretired from the court."},{"pageContent":"CASH-FOR-HONOURSTHE PERENNIAL BRITISH GOVERNMENT SCANDALIT COULD BE argued that the British honours system was steeped in what we wouldnow call corruption from its inception at the time of William the Conqueror. Incarving up his new kingdom, the king handed out land and titles to hissupporters. These titles carried with them increased social rank, the rights tonew lands to govern and exploit (in the name of the king) and wide-rangingjudicial powers. This royal gift had the double effect of (hopefully)engendering gratitude in the recipient and binding them closer to the king. Awell-placed, well-timed offer of a barony or a dukedom has certainly defusedpotential rebellions and deflected various would-be usurpers throughout Britishhistory. The manipulation of the honours system was thus an essential skill forany successful and long-lived monarch.The acceptance of a title traditionally meant the recipient was thereafter underpersonal and financial obligation to the (royal) family of the donor, much ashappens within the Sicilian Mafia. The suggestion that a person should be given,say, a knighthood solely for doing good deeds would have struck mostpre-Victorian monarchs as laughable. If a man wished to be rewarded for hischaritable nature, they might have said, then let him go join the church. Asidefrom occasionally rewarding successful generals, honours were almost alwaysgiven to people who had helped or could help the king and his courtiers in someway. Charles II, for example, was infamous for giving titles to his manymistresses, partly to ensure that their children by him would be suitably caredfor by the cuckold husbands. It was only in the nineteenth century that honourswere increasingly given out to philanthropists – and most of these, it should benoted, also tended to be newly rich industrialists whose cash donations werealso sought by the new ruling power in Britain: the political parties.The British party system grew out of the power vacuum created by the seventeenthcentury English Civil War and the subsequent erosion of royal power. However,hopes that these groups of politically affiliated Members of Parliament (MPs)might rule with greater fairness than an absolute monarch were not entirelyfulfilled. The British political parties quickly settled down to become theequivalent of closed-shop guilds – MPs who did not belong to either of the twobig parties had little or no chance of passing their own legislation, let alonefinding a seat in the government – a situation that continues to the presentday.A particularly questionable element of the two-party system is the use of‘whips’. These are MPs given the disciplinary power to make sure that partymembers vote along the line of party policy, whether or not that policy conformswith the conscience of the MP or the views of the majority of theirconstituents. Such party harassment and control of elected officials might beseen as flying directly in the face of representative democracy, but it has goneon for many generations and is therefore seen as a part of British traditionallife, accepted as being above criticism or the need for reform – just like thehonours system.Nevertheless, it has often been pointed out over the years that Britain’s defacto two-party system is a classic example of ‘restrictive practices’ – amonopoly control of power that is strictly illegal in other sectors of publiclife. In response to this, party politicians can point to the special controlsset over them: the regular elections that can eject them from parliament, andthe oversight of the so-called ‘Upper Chamber’. This non-elected debating andlegislative chamber, the House of Lords, is the last vestige of official powerthat still rests in the British honours system. Those hereditary nobilityinclined to attend – and, in modern times, the non-hereditary, appointed ‘lifepeers’ – consider and have the power to amend all legislation passed by theelected representatives in the ‘lower’ House of Commons. Thus they are oftendescribed as the break on excessive political power in Great Britain.In fact, the House of Lords has no practical power of permanent veto over thelegislation of the Lower House, and is almost as riddled with party affiliationand blind party loyalty as the House of Commons. Yet, the House of Lords has, onoccasion, fought spiritedly against government policies that it disagrees with –especially if the party in government does not control a majority in the Lords.The creation of new lords, therefore, can be a key tactic in the never-endingchess match of bi-party politics.The vast majority of new peers are now appointed by the leaders of the two mainparties, the largest proportion of these nominations being within the gift ofthe sitting prime minister. (A few appointments are still traditionally allottedto the monarch as a regal birthday and New Year treat.) Therefore it can be seenthat in the control of the honours system, a prime minister and, to a lesserextent, the leader of the opposition party, have similar powers of preferment toa pre-civil war absolute monarch. Is it any wonder then that the whiff ofpolitical corruption has always hung around a prime minister’s handing-out ofhonours, just as it did when all titles were given out by a self-serving king orqueen?But of course modern times call for modern attitudes. No prime minister, we maysurely ask, would abuse the British honours system for the sake of favours orbribes? To which the answer is: no, not in person – that would be too risky. Thetraditional method is to get some dubious confederate to do it and, if thescheme is discovered, to also take the blame.In the early years of the twentieth century, an amiable con man named MaundyGregory was selected by prime minister David Lloyd George as his chief broker inthe sale of honours, knighthoods and baronetcies to replenish the coffers of theLiberal Party. It is worth adding that it has been plausibly suggested thatGregory was guilty of one or possibly two murders.Arthur John Peter Michael Maundy Gregory was born on 1 July 1877 at Southampton.He was the son of the vicar of St Michael’s and a boyhood friend of HaroldDavidson, later notorious as the Rector of Stiffkey. Gregory’s father was anunpopular vicar, for he had imbibed the High Anglican principles of Newman’sOxford Movement and his Low Church parishioners objected furiously to what theyfelt was an attempt to introduce popery. This may partly explain why Gregory wasalso unpopular at his prep school, Banister Court, where the boys were inclinedto jeer at him and call him ‘bum cheeks’ (in reference to his rosy cheeks).Another cause may have been his habitually effeminate manner – Gregory was, infact, a homosexual.From a formative age, Gregory’s great love was the theatre. At Oxford heorganized amateur theatricals. He also practised ventriloquism, and recitedcomic monologues. Gregory’s father was poor and Gregory was a non-collegiatestudent. When his father died in 1899, Gregory left Oxford without a degree.What happened next is unclear but in a theatrical Who’s Who of 1907 he isdescribed as a theatrical manager and playwright who had first appeared as adrawing-room entertainer, then manager of the Prince of Wales Theatre,Southampton, and later toured in various dramas and farces. He now calledhimself J. Maundy Gregory.In 1903 he became a manager of Frank Benson’s touring Shakespeare company at £5a week but was sacked for dipping his hand in the till. In 1908, Gregory andHarold Davidson went into a kind of partnership. By now Davidson had manyacquaintances among the aristocracy, through his charitable activities.Davidson’s role was to direct his aristocratic friends towards Gregory, whowould persuade them to buy shares in a syndicate whose purpose was to bring oversuccessful Broadway shows from America to tour regional England. Partly due tobad timing – Gregory tried to launch a revival of the musical Dorothy justbefore Christmas, when there were dozens of pantomimes to compete with it – thispartnership collapsed in 1909.As a theatre manager, Gregory had given a benefit performance of Dorothy for theMessina earthquake victims and was astonished at how many rich patrons he couldentice to the theatre. He had an instinct that snobbery might somehow beutilized to make him a fortune, and to that end he launched a magazine calledMayfair, and succeeded in persuading rich industrialists to pay for theprivilege of having their portraits sandwiched between those of the aristocracy.He also launched a kind of unofficial detective agency to keep note ofdistinguished guests who registered at the major hotels of London and Paris, andto establish their credit ratings. Many hotels, restaurants and jewellers paidhim a fee for his information.When the beginning of World War I put an end to these activities, Gregory usedhis ability as an information gatherer by becoming a member of MI5, the newlyset-up British Secret Service. He later claimed to have impersonated WinstonChurchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, at a public banquet when Churchillwas in danger of assassination. Presumably Gregory’s ‘bum cheeked’ face made hima dead-ringer for the young Churchill.In December 1918, the prime minister, David Lloyd George – the ‘Welsh Wizard’ –was head of a coalition government consisting mainly of Conservatives, with lessthan a quarter of the Members of the House of Commons belonging to his ownLiberal Party. He urgently needed at least £4 million as a campaign fund for theup-coming election. The solution lay in the sale of honours. ‘You and I knowthat the sale of honours is the cleanest way of raising money for a politicalparty,’ he once confided to J.C.C. Davidson.Knighthoods could be sold for £10,000 each; baronetcies were £40,000 each, sincethey could be inherited. Lloyd George needed a reliable man to act as his chiefsalesman – someone who could be trusted not to embarrass him by marketing hisproduct too openly. Maundy Gregory seems to have been recommended by Lord Murrayof Elibank, the Liberal Chief Whip (who had been involved in the Marconi scandalbefore the war that had almost wrecked the government).Gregory’s first step towards becoming an honours broker was to launch anothermagazine, The Whitehall Gazette, as a cover for his activities. The aim of theGazette, he claimed publicly, was to conduct a campaign against Bolshevism andcommunism. A henchman named J. Douglas Moffat, who had himself been in the‘honours for sale’ business before Lloyd George decided to go into massproduction, would keep his ear to the ground and approach likely prospects –such as a Justice of the Peace or Master of Foxhounds who would be willing topay £10,000 for a knighthood, or a rich war profiteer who was anxious for abaronetcy or even a peerage.A meeting with Gregory would be arranged and in due course, Gregory wouldreceive his cut – probably 10 per cent of the price paid. Maundy Gregory iscredited with suggesting that Lloyd George should originate a new honour, theOrder of the British Empire (OBE) that might be sold cheap – at about £100.Lloyd George created 25,000 OBEs in a few years. He also created 91 new peers –double the number that either of his two predecessors had created.Maundy Gregory was soon a very rich man, and he loved the role. He was alwaysimmaculately dressed, changing his suit so many times a day that it was notedand commented on, even in an age when it was still expected for a gentleman tosport a morning coat when he got up and change into evening clothes for supper.In an indulgence hinting at his secret link to the prime minister, Gregorybought a house at No 10 Hyde Park Terrace – he could then tell his staff to saythat he was ‘over at No 10’ if anyone called while he was out – the intendedimpression being, of course, that he was at 10 Downing Street with the primeminister. He also owned a bungalow called ‘Vanity Fair’ on Ditton Island on theThames, a flat at Brighton, and the Ambassador Club in London.Gregory was by no means just a corrupt spy and confidence man. He was acollector of first editions and had a genuine love of literature. He seems tohave been a likeable and generous person, who loved to give gifts. There is astory that he bought the Ambassador Club as a present for a handsome 23-year-oldwaiter named Peter Mazzina, who became manager there. Mazzina was one of the fewwho did not desert Gregory at the time of his later disgrace.Yet there was also undoubtedly a dark side to the prim seller of knighthoods andlordships. One writer, Donald McCormick, has connected Maundy Gregory with oneof the most curious mysteries of the twentieth century: the disappearance of theLabour Member of Parliament Victor Grayson.Grayson was a staunch socialist, who was elected to Westminster in 1907 at theage of 26 as Member for Colne Valley. He was a charismatic personality and amagnificent orator, his only major weakness being his love of drink. BeforeWorld War I, his political career seemed to be at an end because of hisinability to appear sober on a platform. But at the beginning of the war he wentto Australia and New Zealand to lecture on socialism and to proclaim the virtuesof fighting for one’s country – a new departure for Grayson.Grayson then joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and fought in France,where he was wounded. Back in England after the war, he was placed undersurveillance by MI5 as a possible agitator who might try to link up with theRussian communists or the Irish rebels. Grayson’s biographer Reg Groves states:‘Somehow Victor Grayson became concerned at the sale of honours and found outabout Gregory’s part in it. Gregory was keeping tabs on Grayson and Grayson wasled into finding out what Gregory was doing.’ Grayson was, of course, preciselythe sort of person who might blow the honours conspiracy sky high.On an evening in September 1920, Grayson was in the bar of a London restaurant,the Georgian, when the receptionist told him that she had just received atelephone call saying that some luggage of Grayson’s had been delivered to theQueen’s Hotel, Leicester Square, by mistake. The restaurant was in ChandosPlace, just behind the Strand, about ten minutes’ walk from the Queen’s Hotel.Grayson apparently remarked, ‘Don’t let anybody touch my whisky – I’ll be backin a moment.’He walked out and was never seen again.Since Grayson was by then an obscure, largely forgotten public figure, hisdisappearance was not noticed for some time – so long that the precise date isnot even certain. (There is even some doubt about whether Grayson was in theGeorgian restaurant or in some hotel on the Strand.) The acquaintance with whomhe had been drinking, E.K. Donovan, telephoned the Queen’s Hotel to ask ifGrayson had collected his luggage, only to be told they knew nothing whateverabout it – it was not they who had made the call to the Georgian restaurant.A short time later, on the afternoon of 28 September, a painter named GeorgeFlemwell was standing on the Middlesex bank of the Thames painting a watercolourwhen he saw an ‘electric canoe’ with two men in it crossing to Ditton Island,upon which Maundy Gregory owned a house. Flemwell recognized one of the men asGrayson who, by a stunning coincidence, Flemwell had known for some time. Theboat stopped at the island and Grayson and the other man walked into a bungalow.Since Flemwell wanted to see Grayson, he took a ferryboat to Ditton Island andknocked on the door of the house; a middle-aged woman answered the door andirritably denied all knowledge of Grayson. Shortly thereafter, Flemwell returnedto Switzerland, where he lived, not even aware that Grayson had vanished.It is conceivable, of course, that Flemwell was mistaken – after Grayson’sdisappearance became known, many people were convinced that they had seen him.(My old friend, Sidney Campion, who knew Grayson well, was absolutely convincedthat he saw him on the London Underground in 1939 – C.W.) One of the likeliesttheories is that Grayson embarked for Russia, but never reached his destination.It is certainly hard to imagine the amiable Gregory – who had more in commonwith Oscar Wilde than Bill Sykes – managing to murder a man who must have knownhe had every reason to distrust him. But it is quite conceivable that, withperhaps the connivance of Lloyd George and M15, he lured Grayson into a trap.A less dire alternative was suggested by David Clark, former Labour MP for SouthShields. He wrote that: ‘quite simply, Grayson contrived his own disappearance,and lived out his life in North England under a different name.’ Clark claimedto have made the discovery that Grayson was homosexual, and that his decision to‘disappear’ was due to the mental strain of his growing alcoholism and theemergence of his old homosexual tendencies.Still, the irritable middle-aged woman who answered the door to Flemwell doesfit the description of a close associate of Gregory’s. That woman was also hispossible second murder victim, and here the evidence against Gregory isaltogether stronger. Her name was Edith Marion Rosse, the tenant of the DittonIsland bungalow, ‘Vanity Fair’, and perhaps Gregory’s closest friend.Edith Rosse had been on the stage under the name of Vivienne Pierpont and hadmarried Frederick Rosse, a composer and director closely associated withGregory’s abortive theatrical ventures. The three of them seemed to beinseparable and spent a great deal of time exploring the Thames, which they allloved. In 1910, Gregory bought ‘Vanity Fair’ and the Rosses moved in as histenants. The three were still very close friends up to 1923, but then – forreasons unknown – Rosse and his wife decided to separate. Gregory and Mrs Rossecontinued to be inseparable, not least because she, as his presumed lover, wasan alibi and cover for his homosexual activities.Throughout the 1920s, Gregory’s wealth increased, in spite of the Honours(Prevention of Abuses) Act, passed by Parliament in 1925. He spent lavishly – onthe Ambassador Club, on his Whitehall Gazette, and on his friends. There were,however, times when he needed cash urgently. One amusing story tells how heasked one of his clients for payment in advance on a peerage. The man agreed butcannily post-dated the cheque for after the next announcement of new honoursand, as a double insurance, signed it with the title he had chosen. If Gregoryhad defaulted on the promised honour, the cheque would have become worthless.It also seems likely that Gregory wasn’t above asking old ‘clients’ for money –they certainly wouldn’t want, after receiving their titles, to be seen with thechief seller of honours, so would usually have paid up. It seems reasonablycertain that Gregory was being blackmailed in the late 1920s, not for his partin the sale of honours but because of his homosexuality. There is a fine ironyin the notion that the man who often resorted to blackmail should himself becomea victim. Then there was another blow. A man who had paid out £30,000 inexpectation of a title died before he received it and his executors – pointingout that they had no further use for the title – demanded the money back.Gregory refused to pay but when they started court proceedings against him wasforced to avert disaster by repaying the cash in three instalments.Then, in 1927, the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act of 1925 finally began tohave an effect and the government secretly closed down Gregory’s links to thehonours list. This did not upset his operations however. He simply continued ashe always had done, with the only difference being that none of his clients evergot what they paid for. What were they going to do? If they made a fuss theywould be socially ruined and, furthermore, liable to prosecution with Gregoryunder the Honours Act. But Gregory’s expensive lifestyle and blackmail paymentswere now, at last, clearly running ahead of the ‘fees’ he collected in thecrooked honours game.On 19 August 1932, Mrs Rosse complained to the housekeeper at the Ditton Islandbungalow that she felt unwell. At the time, Gregory was lunching with his friendKing George of Greece but he received a message that made him hurry back. Thedoctor had diagnosed Bright’s Disease. In the presence of the housekeeper andthe doctor, Edith Rosse said she wanted to make her will and demanded paper.Gregory pulled a menu card out of his pocket. On this, she wrote that her goodswere all to be left to Maundy Gregory; the doctor and housekeeper witnessed thewill. By 1 September Mrs Rosse seemed quite well again and went for a drive withGregory. Two days later, she had a relapse, with sickness and diarrhoea. Shedied on 14 September.Gregory now behaved rather oddly. He said that Edith Rosse had expressed adesire to be buried near the river she loved so much. Thames Ditton graveyardwould seem to have been the obvious choice but Gregory said that was not closeenough. He went much further afield, to Bisham, where there was a burial chargeof a hundred guineas to anyone not born in the parish. With some difficulty,Gregory obtained the necessary permission and paid the hundred guineas. Theundertaker who asked if Gregory wanted the coffin soldered up was told that shewouldn’t like that, and to simply allow the lid to rest on the coffin. In thegraveyard, he told the gravediggers that she wanted to lie close to the surfaceso the grave was positioned only eighteen inches below the surface – well out ofany clay that might have sealed the coffin to the river water that waterloggedthe soil.Mrs Rosse had left £18,000 – she and Gregory had had some disagreement not longbefore because she refused to lend him some of it. Now he was able to use all ofit to pay off his more urgent debts. But it was not enough. He decided that theanswer lay in a few quick sales of honours. His ‘scout’, a man called Pengelley,reported that a certain Lieutenant-Commander Edward Whaney Billyard Leake, RN,was a possible candidate. Accordingly, Leake was cautiously approached byGregory’s tout, J. Douglas Moffat, who requested an interview, hinting that itwould be to Leake’s advantage. Leake wanted to know what it was all about butMoffat was evasive.Eventually, out of curiosity, Leake agreed to a meeting. On 23 January 1933,Moffat asked Leake if he wanted a knighthood; if so, it would cost him £12,000.(Lloyd George was no longer in power but Gregory still had powerful friends inthe national coalition government under Ramsay MacDonald.) Leake said he was notinterested. Moffat should have taken warning but instead he persuaded Leake tomeet Maundy Gregory. They went to Gregory’s house and there Gregory confirmedthat, for somewhere between £10,000 and £12,000, Leake could be included in theJune Birthday Honours. There was a second meeting – Leake was now consumed withcuriosity but he finally declined the offer. Gregory asked him to reconsider andasked for £2,000 ‘to keep the pot boiling’. After discussing it with a friend,Leake went to Scotland Yard and reported the whole matter.Gregory behaved with extreme coolness when Chief Inspector Arthur Askew calledon him and handed him a summons. No doubt he felt that it should be easy to useinfluential friends who would ‘fix’ the investigation. When this provedunexpectedly difficult, Gregory again blackmailed various previous recipients ofhonours for £2,000 each, to pay for his defence.The case came up at Bow Street Court on 16 February 1933. Gregory had beenpersuaded to plead guilty so that it would not be necessary for the prosecutionto produce damning (and government-embarrassing) evidence for the press toreport upon. Gregory was sentenced to a suspiciously lenient two months’imprisonment – without hard labour – and fined £50.While Gregory was in prison, a niece of Mrs Rosse, Ethel Marion Davis, consulteda solicitor to see whether she could contest the will. Then she went to thepolice and told them she thought her aunt’s death was suspicious. A week afterGregory had been sentenced to prison, London newspapers announced that variousrelatives of Mrs Rosse had been questioned about her sudden death. While Gregorywas working in the prison library and earning remission for good conduct, thepolice were applying for permission to exhume Mrs Rosse’s body.Meanwhile, Gregory’s debt problem was as urgent as ever; an auction was held athis Hyde Park Terrace house and his goods – including many beautiful antiques –were sold for a total of just over £300.Gregory came out of prison on 11 April 1933, and was met by Peter Mazzina. Hethen made his way to a lunch at the Ambassador Club, at which certainpoliticians were present. It is not hard to imagine the scene: if Gregory hadharboured any hope that he might slip back into his old ways and life, he musthave been given a sharp shock. He was already an embarrassment and risk to hisfriends in power and the potential murder investigation certainly put Gregoryoutside their protection. It seemed that if he wanted to remain free (and alive)Gregory must take the first boat from Newhaven to Dieppe and spend the rest ofhis life under cover.Two weeks later, Mrs Rosse’s body was exhumed. As Dr Roche Lynch, the HomeOffice analyst, watched water pouring out of the coffin as it was raised hemuttered: ‘Not a chance.’ He was right. If Mrs Rosse had been poisoned, as herniece suspected, the Thames had done its work and removed all trace of it fromthe badly decomposed body. But the inquest made one thing quite certain: MrsRosse had not had Bright’s Disease. No cause of death could be ascertained.Gregory retired to Paris, and took rooms at 8 rue d’Anjou. In spite of havingbeen declared bankrupt, he never seemed short of money – friends ‘close to theConservative Party’ had provided him with a ‘pension’ of £2,000 a year. Hisfriend Peter Mazzina also prospered for a while, running the Bristol Grill andthe Millionaire’s Club but, by 1943, he was heavily in debt and committedsuicide by hanging himself at a house in Welbeck Street.In the summer of 1940, after the German invasion of France, Gregory hid himselfaway in a tiny room in a hotel in Chateauneuf-du-Faou, in Finistere, Brittany,for four months. He was eventually captured in November and taken to a civilianinternment camp at Drancy; he died on 28 September 1941, at the age of 64. Afellow inmate told Gregory’s biographer, Tom Cullen, that he had died of a ‘lackof booze’, because the Germans had cut off the supply of whisky that he had beensmuggling in from Paris.Yet, despite Maundy Gregory’s downfall, the cover-up for the real culprits inthe honours-for-sale scheme had been almost entirely successful. After all, from1918 to 1927, Gregory had merely been the agent for the ruling politicalparties. It was they who had been pocketing 90 per cent of the payments,disguising the fact beneath the anonymity and secrecy allowed to party donationsand funding under British law. It was only in 1974, with the publication of TomCullen’s biography of Gregory – Maundy Gregory: Purveyor of Honours – that thescandal finally came out. By that time, of course, the corrupt politicians whomight have been embarrassed or prosecuted as a result of Cullen’s revelationswere almost certainly dead. No police time was wasted on an investigation intowhat must have seemed a long-past conspiracy, rather than an on-going criminalactivity.Yet it was possible that honours were still being exchanged for cash or favours.Although the 1925 Honours Act was still in force, so was the anonymity of partyfunding that had allowed Prime Minister David Lloyd George to get away with thescam in the first place. And, as noted before, Lloyd George was not the inventorof the cash-for-honours scheme; he simply industrialized and streamlined analready existent trade. What reason was and is there to believe that partybigwigs would have ceased to exploit this financially lucrative, if illegal,opportunity just as they had before 1927?In fact, it seems not only possible that the cash-for-peerages swindlecontinued, in one way or another, well after the passing of the Honours Act butthat, to a certain degree, it has become normal for governments to ignore thespirit of the 1925 Honours Act. For example, in May 1998, Lord Pym, the thenConservative Chairman of the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee, told a Houseof Commons select committee that his committee considered a financial donationto a political party as a point in a nominee’s favour since it indicated activeinvolvement in public life; that the nominee had ‘put their money where theirmouth is’.In other words, giving money to a political party was equivalent to committingcharitable acts and was therefore not an act of corruption but of publicservice. Of course, few would dispute this point of view, provided the partydonor was not expecting direct favours, like an honour, in return.The difficulty arises in defining the line between normal practice andcorruption. Parties and governments assist and honour people all the time –that, after all, is one of their primary functions. But were publicly spiritedpeople, who happen to have donated money to a political party, to be blockedfrom any form of honour, just in case the nomination was seen to bequestionable?The key to the dilemma was the anonymity of party funding in the UK. As long asdonors remained anonymous it was not possible to correlate the relation of cashgiven to a party with that party’s nominations to the honours list. This was ablind spot in the law that Tony Blair’s New Labour Party promised to addresswhen they took power in 1997.The previous Conservative government had been plagued by ‘sleaze’ scandals. Theevidence that Tory MPs had accepted ‘financial incentives’ to raise politicallyloaded questions in the House of Commons, had badly shaken the public’s alreadywavering faith in the incorruptibility of their elected politicians (see AITKEN,Jonathan; page 8). Labour took advantage of this national disillusionment bypromising in their election manifesto that they would conduct a ‘reform of partyfunding to end sleaze’, in part by removing the anonymity of all people donatingmoney, or equivalent favours, above the value of £5,000 to any political party.This change was duly enacted in the ‘Political Parties, Elections andReferendums Act’ in 2000, which also set up the House of Lords AppointmentsCommission. This body has the duty to oversee nominees for peerages and, if theydeemed them unsuitable, veto those nominations.Labour had, by that stage, also delivered on another promised reform: theremoval of hereditary peers from the Upper House. This seemed only fair andsensible, since there was no justifiable reason that a peer should be given adeciding part in the legislative procedure, simply because, say, a distantancestor had been illegitimately impregnated by Charles II. On the other hand,by allowing only nominated life peers to sit in the House of Lords, PrimeMinister Tony Blair was greatly increasing his own power of patronage. He alsoeffectively blocked more radical reforms of the Upper House, such as having mostor all of its members elected by the public, as in the US Senate.By the general election of spring 2005, the reforms to party funding were havingsome unforeseen side effects. Continuing political apathy and disillusionmentamong the general public meant that party membership was at an all time lowacross the board; and so were, of course, party membership fees. Other sourcesof revenue were also at an ebb. The labour unions had long been cash supportersof the Labour Party, but both their own dwindling memberships and theirdisillusionment with the increasingly right-wing policies of New Labour werereducing these block donations. The other main traditional source of partyfinance was large donations by individuals and companies; but, thanks partly tothe loss of anonymity in the Political Parties Act 2000, company bosses werefinding it harder to convince their shareholders that big donations to apolitical party were the best way of investing funds. That just left individualdonors, and these too were falling away because of the removal of anonymity andthe growing cynicism about party politics.Both the main political parties –Labour and the Conservatives – were facingsevere debt after their record expenditure on political advertising in therun-up to the 2005 election. In fact, the Political Parties Act had alsoaddressed the danger of party election spending spinning out to insane levels(as it routinely does in the United States) by limiting spending by a singleparty in a general election to £18.84 million. However, this level of spendingwas more than enough to get the political parties into serious trouble if theirmain sources of finance were drying to a trickle.In the summer of 2005, the House of Lords Appointments Commission was due topublish their assessment on the 28 new life peers nominated by the politicalparties (11 by Labour, 8 by the Conservatives, and the remaining 9 from thesmaller parties). Yet an unexpected delay in publication caused sudden mediainterest. The stated reason for the delay – concern over donations to partyfunds – smacked of financial corruption.In February 2006, millionaire stockbroker Barry Townsley, who had been one ofthe eleven Labour nominees for life peerages, withdrew his acceptance, statingpress intrusion into his private life as the reason. Of course, this onlyincreased the media’s interest in him and his fellow nominees. Townsley, itturned out, had directly given only £6,000 to Labour, but he had also donated£1.5 million to a city academy school (city academies being a pet project ofPrime Minister Tony Blair). All this was perfectly legal under the PoliticalParties Act, but it also turned out that Townsley had loaned a further £1.5million to Labour. Since this was a loan under commercial terms at a commercialinterest rate, the 2000 Act said that it need not appear in New Labour’s publicfinance accounts. To financial journalists, it looked as if Labour might betrying to subvert the spirit of the law that they themselves had implemented.Further press investigation revealed that Sir Gulam Noon, an Indian-British foodmillionaire, had loaned Labour £250,000. Interviewed by The Times newspaper,Noon said that a ‘senior party man’ had told him that ‘there was no reason why Ishould declare this loan because it was refundable’. Noon went on to say that:‘I was told by this same person that because there was interest on the loan itwas a commercial matter and would not come under the same party funding rules asa donation.’In March 2006, Dr Chai Patel, director of the Priory private healthcare group,complained publicly that his life peer nomination (again, one of New Labour’s)was going to be blocked by the House of Lords Appointments Commission because hehad recently donated £10,000 to Labour. Although he insisted that there had beenno promise of a title in return for the cash, he did tell the BBC’s Todayprogramme that he believed he would have brought valuable experience to theHouse of Lords.Further questions were asked when it was revealed that Lord Levy, Labour’s chieffundraiser, had asked him to change his cash donation to a loan. Dr Patel hadagreed and loaned Labour £1.5 million. This, of course, did not appear on theparty’s balance sheet. Press investigation then revealed that, in the run-up tothe 2005 general election, £13.5 million had been loaned to Labour byindividuals. Three of the most generous – Dr Patel, Barry Townsley and Sir DavidGarrard – had then appeared on the very next honours list. Since Labour hadspent £17.94 million on its election campaign, this meant that all but £4.44million had come from these ‘secret’ loans.On 15 March, Jack Dromey, Labour’s party treasurer (a post he was elected to byparty members, rather than being appointed to by the prime minister) went publicwith his personal indignation over the question of the loans. Neither he norLabour’s National Executive Committee chairman, Sir Jeremy Beecham (anotherelected rather than appointed official) had been informed of these enormousloans from ‘non-commercial’ sources, despite the fact that they were bothroutinely informed about more conventional loans to Labour from the banks.This raised a key question: why had Labour gone to individuals for money – someof whom had been quite willing to present the money as a gift, but had beeninstead asked for the cash as a loan – when the banks would have been just aswilling to lend the money at the same or better commercial rates? Was it thatthe banks would have to eventually make the loans public in their own annualaccounts? Or was it that Labour had been hoping that, once the money was safelybanked and out of public view, the loans would be conveniently forgotten bytheir donors? And what might Labour have offered as repayment for suchgenerosity? Public honours, perhaps, at some later date?One thing seemed plain: asking for loans rather than straight donations wasidiocy if cash-strapped Labour indeed intended to pay the money back. Theinterest on the £13.5 million would cost the party an estimated £900,000 a yearunder the commercial agreements they had signed with the donors. Obviously, thiswas money they would not have owed if they had simply accepted the cash asdonations and thus made them public. Why had Labour saddled itself with such anavoidable debt?On 27 March 2006, the London Metropolitan Police announced that they wereinvestigating possible abuses of the Political Parties, Elections andReferendums Act (2000). As of this writing (January 2007) they have interviewedvarious people from both the Labour and Conservative parties, as well as fromthe third largest party, the Liberal Democrats. A lot of political feathers wereruffled when investigators not only questioned Lord Levy, but placed him underarrest. Although he was released subsequently without charge, Levy and hisfriends were outraged that he had been treated like a common suspected felon.Lord Michael Levy is the man who seems to have been centrally involved in thecollection of loans for Labour before the 2005 general election. He is a closefriend of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who appointed him in 2002 to be his‘personal envoy’ to the Middle East. Levy is also said to play tennis with TonyBlair on a regular basis.The police questioned the prime minister himself on 14 December 2006, at hisoffice in Downing Street. Much was made at the time, by the Downing Street pressoffice and loyal New Labourites, that the PM was not cautioned before theinterview. A caution that the interview might involve matters that couldincriminate the suspect is standard procedure if the police believe that theinterviewee might be guilty of a crime. So, arguably, the lack of a cautionsuggested that the police did not believe Blair guilty of anything, and merelywanted background information from him. In fact, it is not true that policealways caution suspects; sometimes they wait until they have evaluated theinformation from an interview before re-interviewing the suspect, at which timethey will issue a caution.Whether or not the police ever charge anyone with wrong-doing over the mostrecent incarnation of the cash-for-honours scandal, it seems plain that furtherreform of the honours system is called for. The removal of anonymity for partydonors was a big step towards removing temptation from cash-strapped partybosses; an improvement that Labour are to be thoroughly applauded forimplementing . . . if they haven’t already been abusing the new donationssystem. However, it seems plain that the party appointment of new honours isboth elitist and too open to abuse. One answer might be to have a fully electedUpper House – as is found to work in many democracies – with lesser,non-legislative honours (like knighthoods and OBEs) being distributed by anhonours committee, such as the one that awards Nobel prizes, and the Olympiccommittee that decides on venues for future games. But whether Members ofParliament and government ministers would ever stand for such a flouting ofparliamentary tradition – and such a reduction of their own power of patronage –remains to be seen."},{"pageContent":"CLEVELAND STREET SCANDALTHE ‘SEX-FOR-SALE’ TELEGRAPH BOYSIN EARLY JULY 1886, there was a theft of money from a room in the General PostOffice in St Martin’s-Le-Grand, in the City of London. A telegraph messenger boynamed Charles Thomas Swinscow came under suspicion and when he was searched, heproved to have eighteen shillings on him – a far larger sum than he was likelyto save up from his wages. On 4 July 1886, a police constable named Hanksquestioned the boy, who told him that he had obtained the money for doing some‘private work’ for a gentleman named Hammond, who lived at 19 Cleveland Street,just north of Soho. Finally, he admitted that he had been taken to the house bya post office clerk named Henry Newlove – who, like Swinscow, was fifteen.Newlove, it seemed, had earlier persuaded Swinscow to go with him to a lavatoryin the basement of the Post Office where he had ‘behaved indecently’. ThenNewlove had suggested that Swinscow might like to earn a little money by doingthe same thing with a gentleman. At the house in Cleveland Street, Swinscow hadgot into bed with a gentleman who, in the language of the police report, ‘puthis person between my legs and an emission took place’. The gentleman then gavehim half a sovereign, which Swinscow handed to the landlord of the house,Hammond. Hammond had given him back four shillings. The same thing hadapparently happened on a subsequent occasion.Swinscow mentioned two other telegraph boys who had gone to Cleveland Street:seventeen-year-olds George Wright and Charles Thickbroom. Wright admitted thathe and Newlove had gone to the basement lavatory and ‘Newlove put his personinto me . . . and something came away from him.’ Wright went with Newlove to theCleveland Street house where he went to a bedroom with a ‘foreign looking chap’.They undressed and got into bed. ‘He told me to suck him. I did so. He then hada go between my legs and that was all.’ Wright also received four shillings.Thickbroom told how Newlove had persuaded him to go to Cleveland Street, wherehe went to bed with a gentleman and they ‘played with one another. He did notput his person into me.’ He also received four shillings.Newlove admitted the truth of the statements. The next morning he hastened to 19Cleveland Street and warned Hammond. Charles Hammond, a 32-year-old maleprostitute, married to a French prostitute known as ‘Madame Caroline’ – on whomhe had fathered two sons – lost no time in fleeing. So did another homosexual,George Veck, who liked to pose as a clergyman. Veck moved to lodgings nearbyunder a false name, while Hammond fled to France.Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline of the CID applied for warrants for thearrest of Hammond and Newlove on a charge of criminal conspiracy. But when thepolice arrived at Cleveland Street the next day the house was shut up.On his way to the police station, Newlove commented that it was hard that heshould be arrested when men in high positions should be allowed to walk free.Asked what he meant, he replied,‘Lord Arthur Somerset goes regularly to the house in Cleveland Street. So doesthe Earl of Euston and Colonel Jervois.’Lord Arthur Somerset, the son of the Duke of Beaufort, was a major in the RoyalHorse Guards, and superintendent of the stables of the Prince of Wales, QueenVictoria’s son, whose name was to be associated with many scandals. When LordArthur – known as ‘Podge’ – was identified by the two telegraph boys Swinscowand Thickbroom as the man who had climbed into bed with them, ‘Podge’ hastilyobtained four months leave of absence and vanished to the Continent. His elderbrother Henry had been deserted by his wife because of his homosexualinclinations.Veck was also arrested and he and Newlove were committed for trial at the OldBailey. But by that time, the press had got hold of the story. The Pall MallGazette published a paragraph deploring the ‘disgraceful nature’ of the chargeagainst Veck and Newlove and asking whether the ‘two noble lords and othernotable persons in society’ were going to be allowed to get away with it. Itobviously had the makings of a first-class scandal. It may have been at thispoint that Arthur Newton, ‘Podge’s’ solicitor, breathed another name that madethe Director of Public Prosecutions raise his eyebrows: that of ‘Eddy’, the Dukeof Clarence, son of the Prince of Wales. Eddy, according to rumour, had alsovisited the Cleveland Street brothel. Meanwhile, ‘Podge’ was in more trouble;another teenager, Algernon Allies, had been interviewed by the police andadmitted that he had been intimately involved with Lord Arthur Somerset, whom hecalled ‘Mr Brown’. ‘The prosecution wishes to avoid putting any witness in thebox who refers to “Mr Brown”,’ wrote the Director of Public Prosecutions, SirAugustus Stephenson to the Attorney-General.It was no surprise to anyone when the case came up at Bow Street on 18 September1876 and lasted a mere half-hour. Veck and Newlove both pleaded guilty and wereboth given light sentences: Veck nine months’ hard labour and Newlove fourmonths’. That, it seemed, was the end of the case.But the press was not willing to allow it to rest there. There were manycrusading editors in London, like W.T. Stead of the Pall Mall Gazette, HenryLabouchere of Truth, and Ernest Parke of the North London Press. It was Parkewho put the cat among the pigeons. On 16 November 1889 – three years after thecase – Parke identified the aristocrats whose names had been so carefullysuppressed at the time of the trial: Lord Arthur Somerset and the Earl ofEuston. (These names, we may recall, had been mentioned to Abberline by Newlovewhen he was arrested.) Parke also commented that ‘a far more distinguished andmore highly placed personage . . . was inculpated in these disgusting crimes.’The Earl of Euston, Henry James Fitzroy, was 38 years old at the time of theCleveland Street trial. He immediately instructed his solicitor to sue forlibel. Parke’s trial opened at the Old Bailey on 15 January 1890. One of themost serious points against Parke was his allegation that the Earl of Euston hadfled to Peru; Euston had done nothing of the sort. (It had been unnecessary, forhis name had never entered the case after Newlove mentioned it to Abberline.)Euston admitted that he had been to 19 Cleveland Street. But, he said, it hadbeen a misunderstanding. He had, he said, been in Piccadilly in May or June1886, when someone had put an advertising card into his hand. It said ‘Posesplastiques’, and gave the address of 19 Cleveland Street. Poses plastiques meantnaked girls posing in Grecian attitudes. So, according to Lord Euston, hehurried to 19 Cleveland Street. He was admitted by a man who told him there wereno women there but left no doubt about what the house had to offer. ‘Youinfernal scoundrel, if you don’t let me out I’ll knock you down,’ said LordEuston and rushed out.The defence called several witnesses who said they had seen Lord Euston going inor out of Cleveland Street. The final defence witness was a male prostitutenamed John Saul. He claimed to have been picked up by Lord Euston, who took himback to Cleveland Street where they went to bed. The Times declined to reportwhat Saul claimed then took place but we can reconstruct what he said from acomment Saul had made to Ernest Parke about Euston: ‘He is not an actualsodomite. He likes to play with you and then “spend” on your belly.’The judge emphasized the contradictions in the statements of witnesses, anddescribed Saul as a ‘loathesome object’. The strongest point against Parke washis statement that Euston had fled to Peru. The jury found Parke guilty of libelwithout justification. He was sentenced to a year in prison without hard labour.The sentence was not regarded as severe by the press.The case was still not quite over. In December 1889, ‘Podge’s’ solicitor, ArthurNewton, was accused of conspiring to defeat the course of justice. The chargessaid that he had tried to get an interview with Algernon Allies – the youth whohad admitted being ‘Podge’s’ lover – and had collected three of the accusedtelegraph boys after they had left police custody and sent them to a lodginghouse while he arranged for them to leave the country. Newton’s defence was thathis clerk Frederick Taylorson, who was charged with him, had met Allies byaccident and exchanged a few words with him. And so to the second charge, it wastrue that he had sent the boys to a lodging house overnight, telling them thatthey ought to go abroad, but that this was because ‘Podge’s’ father, the Duke ofBeaufort, wanted to interview them to see if they had been bullied by thepolice. The Duke had subsequently changed his mind. Newton was, he admitted,therefore technically guilty of conspiracy. The judge took a light view of itand sentenced him to six weeks in prison. Taylorson, who pleaded not guilty, wasacquitted.Hammond, the man who ran the brothel, had fled from France to America and wasnever tried. ‘Podge’ spent the rest of his life living abroad, under an assumedname, and died in Hyères, on the French Riviera, in 1926. The scandalundoubtedly ruined his life. In his book The Cleveland Street Scandal, H.Montgomery Hyde suggests that he would have been wise to return and ‘face themusic’; a good solicitor could almost certainly have secured his acquittal, asin the case of Lord Euston. (The evidence suggests that Euston was a regularvisitor at Cleveland Street.) Euston’s trial certainly did him no harm; at thetime of the Cleveland Street case he was a prominent Freemason, the ProvincialGrand Master of Northamptonshire and Huntingdonshire, and subsequently becameGrand Master of the Mark Masons. He was also appointed an aide de camp by KingEdward VII in the coronation year, 1901. He died of dropsy in 1912.Ernest Parke became a Justice of the Peace after he retired as a newspapereditor. But the subsequent career of Arthur Newton, who went to prison forconspiracy, was less fortunate. In 1910 he defended the murderer Crippen andreceived much favourable publicity. But he then conceived the idea of forging aCrippen ‘confession’ and selling it to a newspaper: the Evening Times bought itfor £500, the writer Edgar Wallace acting as a go-between. Although Newton gotcold feet at the last moment, the newspaper forced him to deliver the promisedconfession and sold a million copies as a result. Newton was suspended frompractice by the Law Society for unprofessional conduct. In 1913 he was chargedwith being involved in a Canadian timber fraud, sentenced to three years injail, and struck off the rolls as a solicitor."},{"pageContent":"CLINTON, BILLTHE MONICA LEWINSKY AFFAIRHISTORY WILL PROBABLY rate William Jefferson Clinton – 42nd President of theUnited States – as one of the most successful American leaders of the twentiethcentury. Serving the maximum two terms as president, Bill Clinton (whose birthname was actually W. J. Blythe IV) was elected and re-elected on a strongmandate and was often favourably compared with fellow Democrat and chief icon ofthe Democratic Party, Jack Kennedy.As president, Clinton oversaw a prolonged period of economic expansion andprosperity in the US, did much to undermine the international tariffs that werestrangling free trade, passed rigorous laws to protect the environment, helpedbring peace to Haiti, the Balkans and (for a brief few years) the Middle East,and repeatedly faced down and defeated an almost unprecedented Republicanmajority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Yet, for thepresent generation at least, President Clinton is mainly seen as the man who wasexposed as having an affair with a young White House intern called MonicaLewinsky.The Clinton administration was saddled with controversy and scandal from thebeginning. One of the president’s first acts after his election victory overGeorge Bush Sr, in 1993, was to try to outlaw the automatic bar against gays andlesbians serving in the US military. His policy of ‘don’t mention it, and wewon’t ask’ was condemned by the religious right as going too far, and jeered bythe liberal left as not going far enough.He then promised to reform the rapidly deteriorating US medical service bybringing in a universal health insurance system for all citizens, rich and pooralike. Unfortunately, he made the mistake of putting his wife Hillary at thehead of the commission dealing with the matter – an unprecedentedly powerfulpost for an (obviously unelected) First Lady. Hillary Clinton’s forthrightprofeminist stance, coupled with the unworkably complex health insurance systemproduced by her commission, only gave more ammunition to the extremely vocalRepublican opposition.At this point Bill Clinton was probably tempted to think that the road topolitical hell must be paved with good intentions. However, he continued to actin a relatively enlightened, non-partisan fashion, and thus made the biggestmistake of his political career: he failed to veto the appointment of lawyerKenneth Starr – an avowed Republican – to the post of Special Prosecutor incharge of the powerful Office of the Independent Council.The OIC’s role is to police the corridors of power and investigate governmentaland/or individual corruption. As its name suggests, it is free of any politicalconstraint, and can even investigate the president if the Special Prosecutordeems it necessary. The OIC was instrumental in the investigations into both theWatergate and the Iran-Contra affairs and, in 1994, the OIC began investigatingPresident Clinton’s possible involvement in a banking fraud over a small area ofreal estate in Arkansas called Whitewater.As governor of Arkansas in the late 1970s, Bill Clinton had invested in theWhitewater housing development through a small bank, called the Madison GuarantySavings and Loan. The MGS&L eventually went bust during the great 1980ssavings-and-loan scandal that saw almost all such small (and often corruptlymanaged) local banks going bankrupt, leaving the American taxpayer saddled withthe bill. In the case of the MGS&L, the cost to the state was a cool $45million.James McDougal, the owner of the MGS&L and partner with Bill and Hillary Clintonin the Whitewater housing development (that, of course, was never built), wasinitially acquitted of the charge of bank fraud – only to be convicted of fraudyears later, at the instigation of the OIC. Clinton himself claimed to have lost$69,000 in the MGS&L collapse, but his Republican enemies felt sure that therewas still a ‘smoking gun’ to be found – that is, evidence that as Governor ofArkansas, Bill Clinton had used his power to somehow defraud the taxpayer andhis fellow Whitewater investors.However, the Whitewater accusations remained largely out of the public eye untilJuly 1993, when Vincent Foster – a former member of Hillary Clinton’s law firmand later lawyer to the Clinton family – was found dead, apparently a suicide.Obviously Foster, as the Clinton family lawyer, would have dealt with matterspertaining to Whitewater, and the discovery that, within hours of his death,White House aides had removed numbers of files from his office, led many tosuspect that a scandal was being covered up. It was even suggested, by the moreradical of the president’s enemies, that Foster had been murdered to prevent himrevealing Clinton’s Whitewater misdemeanours.In a congressional investigation into the behaviour of the White House aides,many of the staffers who were called to give evidence suffered unexplainedlapses of memory while under oath, which suggested to many that there was indeedsomething being covered up. However – apart from the resignation of the DeputySecretary of the Treasury over accusations of misleading Congress – the scandalhunters came up with nothing substantial, and President Clinton, althoughundoubtedly embarrassed by the whole affair, remained above the political mêlée.The OIC, under Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr, began its investigation intothe Whitewater affair in August 1994. However, apart from securing theconviction of the then sitting Arkansas State Governor (a Democrat) on unrelatedfraud charges in 1995, the OIC failed in what to many seemed to be Ken Starr’smain aim – to find enough evidence to impeach President Clinton.This was not to say that Clinton was in the clear as far as scandal went. In1996 – the year James McDougal was finally jailed along with ten others forfraud connected to the MGS&L collapse and Whitewater – the novel Primary Colorswas published and went straight into the bestseller list. Its anonymous authordescribes the rise of Jack Stanton, an unscrupulous and philandering stategovernor, to the White House, as seen through the eyes of an (initially)innocent party worker.Although the names were different, the physical description of the fictionalgovernor and of his lifestyle – for example, habitually eating enormous meals,but still remaining surprisingly fit – and that of his scheming, but stillpartly idealistic wife, left few in doubt who the book was really about. Eventsin the book also closely mimicked real events that had taken place during the1993 presidential election. At the time, Primary Colors was generally believedto be the partly fictionalized diary of a senior Clinton aide, so the scandalousbehaviour of the principal character read like an indictment of the sittingpresident.In fact it later emerged that the novel was actually written by Newsweekcolumnist Joe Klein, who admitted the whole plot was based on rumours about theClintons rather than on solid facts, but the damage had already been done. Thepublic had read and half-believed the descriptions of Jack Stanton/Bill Clintonhabitually cheating on his wife and generally behaving with a mixture of thecharismatic rascal and the cynical politician.The sexual rumours about Bill Clinton, satirized in Primary Colors, had firstcome to the public eye in 1992 – just before his run for the presidency – when awoman called Gennifer Flowers suddenly claimed that she and Clinton hadconducted an affair for over twelve years. The timing of the revelation, addedto the fact that Flowers offered no conclusive proof to back her claim, made itfairly easy for Clinton to flatly deny any such relationship had ever happened.In fact, the Flowers assertion probably did Clinton more good than harm in theshort run, as commentators and the public took Clinton’s side in what seemed tobe a case of particularly low political mudslinging by either Flowers or her(presumed) Republican backers. Certainly the scandal did not stop Bill Clintoncomfortably winning the 1993 presidential election.In the long run, however, Bill Clinton’s denial of ever having had a sexualrelationship with Gennifer Flowers was going to cost him. Forced on to thewitness stand and placed under oath in 1998, he admitted that he had indeedslept with her – just once, he insisted – in 1977. Of course, the differencebetween the two stories – an affair of twelve years against a single one-nightstand – meant that the public had to decide whether Flowers or Clinton werelying. The fact that the president had already had to confess to his earlier liemeant that it was easy for his enemies to condemn him, and public opinionstarted to swing against him.The Flowers scandal had been resurrected during the court proceedings ofanother, much more serious allegation against Clinton. In 1994 an article in theAmerican Spectator magazine had suggested that Bill Clinton had once had anaffair with a woman called ‘Paula’. This had incensed Paula Jones, a formerArkansas state clerk, who was convinced that the article was referring to her.She immediately contacted the media to insist that, far from being a sexualconquest, she had totally rebuffed the then governor Clinton in 1991.She said that she had been working behind the reception desk of the ArkansasExcelsior Hotel on 9 May 1991, when the governor checked in with his entourage.A state trooper had later asked her to go to Clinton’s suite, escorted her thereand left her alone with the governor. She and Clinton, Jones said, had chattedamiably on a sofa for a few minutes. Then, without a word of warning, he hadsuddenly pulled down his trousers and underpants to reveal his erect penis. Thegovernor had then indicated that she should perform oral sex. Jones told thepress that she had flatly refused and had tried to leave but, after hauling uphis trousers again, Clinton had briefly blocked her from leaving so that hecould ask her not to tell anyone what had happened. He had also mentioned thathe was a friend of her boss’s boss, and that if she ever wanted anything shejust had to ask. She added that the state trooper, who had stood guard outsidethe door of the suite, had smirked at her knowingly as she hurried out.Clinton’s last words to Paula Jones were phrased to sound like a friendly offer,but she later said that she had detected the possibility of a threat to herfuture employment in them, so had told no one what had happened until she sawthe article in the American Spectator. Clinton immediately denied the incidenthad ever taken place.Having made such a damaging allegation in public, Jones was now open to beingsued for slander by the president, so she decided to take the initiative and suehim for abusing her civil rights by ‘creating a hostile work environment’. Thecase dragged on for four years – mainly because Clinton tried to use hispresidential immunity to avoid having to give testimony. In 1997, however, theSupreme Court ruled that his immunity was invalid in civil cases and he wasforced onto the stand. There the prosecution took the opportunity to questionhim about Gennifer Flowers – hoping to show a general laxity of moral characterin the president – and he confessed to his earlier lie.The judge threw the Paula Jones case out on 1 April 1998, stating that theevidence presented by the prosecution simply wasn’t enough to allow for aconviction. She also said that Jones had not been able to show any real evidencethat the incident in the Excelsior Hotel had significantly damaged herfinancially, mentally or emotionally – so, even if the case had continued to aconclusion of guilty, the judge would have been unable to award significantdamages against the president. On the other hand, lest anyone think this rulingwas an unconditional victory for Clinton, the judge suggested that Clinton andPaula Jones should come to a financial settlement out of court – effectivelysaying that she, the judge, thought Clinton had done something unseemly, butthere wasn’t enough evidence to support a judicial conviction.Clinton eventually paid Paula Jones $850,000, but refused to admit wrongdoing ormake a public apology. Jones had to pay $700,000 of the money to her lawyers,but later managed to make some extra cash from her notoriety by posing nude forPlayboy magazine – much to the horror of the feminist groups who hadunquestioningly backed her during the trial.Another person who had been subpoenaed to give a statement in the Jones vsClinton case was a young former White House intern called Monica Lewinsky. Theprosecution had asked her to give a written statement as to whether she had everhad an affair with the president – thus rather tenuously proving that Clintonmight be the sort of immoral person who would expose himself to a total stranger– but, legally under oath, she had flatly denied that she and the President ofthe United States had been lovers. This, as it later turned out, was a lie, andseveral people watching the trial suspected or knew that it was.Monica Lewinsky was a pretty, if slightly chubby, Jewish girl from California.She was 21 when she arrived at the White House in 1995 to act as an unpaidintern – usually a short-term post that involved being a cross between asecretary and a general gofer, but one that carried a lot of weight on aperson’s future CV. Initially attached to the office of the Chief of Staff, LeonPanetta, Monica Lewinsky rarely saw, let alone spoke to, the president.However, the White House is run as a social venue as well as the home of theHead of State, with regular leaving parties for departing members of staff.Although, thanks to the tight presidential schedule, Bill Clinton could notoften attend these gatherings, he attended enough to notice and become attractedto Monica – who later admitted deliberately flirting with him by maintainingstrong eye contact while they chatted. Their affair began on 15 November 1995.By December, Monica had been moved to a posting in the Office of LegislativeAffairs. She was now in a paid position and, not co-incidentally, had to makeregular trips to the Oval Office (the president’s place of daily work) todeliver documents. The pair would sometimes spend long periods of time alone inthe Oval Office, with security guards at the door being ordered to allow nobodyin. Monica later said that Clinton would also telephone her at home in the smallhours – he was in the habit of working until one or two in the morning – andthey would indulge in phone sex, graphically describing sexual acts to eachother.However, despite the lurid and salacious slant later put on the relationship bythe media and the president’s enemies, Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky’s affairseems to have been largely affectionate and light hearted in nature. Monicalater stressed that she and the president chatted and gossiped together at leastas much as they fooled around. It is also worth noting that, despite Monica’swillingness, Clinton refused ever to have vaginal sex with her, telling herapologetically that he considered that as going too far.By May 1997, the president had decided that the affair itself was also a steptoo far, and broke with Monica as gently as he could. By this time she had beenmoved from her post in the Office of Legislative Affairs to the office ofPentagon spokesman Ken Bacon – where, possibly co-incidentally, she would haveno formal reason to meet with the president. Clinton seems to have had nothingdirectly to do with this effective demotion of Monica, and the White House Chiefof Staff later said she had been moved because of her inattention to work andher generally ‘inappropriate and immature behaviour’. Certainly, during theaffair, it must have been hard for Monica to maintain a proper degree ofprofessional decorum when the President of the United States was keeping her upat night with raunchy telephone calls.The end of the affair left Monica unhappy and lonely. Being from California, shehad few friends in Washington DC and sorely missed her night-time chats with herlover. However she had already made a very good friend at work, a 46-year-oldveteran Pentagon worker called Linda Tripp. By the summer of 1996, Monica hadcome to look on Linda as a bosom friend and confidante: she told her candidlyabout her relationship with Bill Clinton and they would often spend hours on thephone to each other, discussing every detail of the affair. Monica even showedLinda a blue dress with a little staining to the upper body caused, she said, bythe president accidentally ejaculating over her during a bout of oral sex.(Monica later stressed that she had not kept the dress as a slightly luridkeepsake, as some in the media had suggested. The fact was, she said, that shehad put on weight after the affair had ended and the dress had ceased to fit.She had meant to have the dress dry-cleaned but, while it was hanging unused inher wardrobe, she had simply forgotten to send it to the cleaners.)If Linda Tripp was tempted to believe that Monica was telling her a long andcomplex lie about her affair with the president, she claims to have seenevidence, in mid 1997, that convinced her the president was quite capable of‘fooling around’ during office hours. She told Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff– who happened to be the magazine’s expert on the Paula Jones case – that asshe, Linda, was passing the entrance to the Oval Office she had seen KathleenWilley, another White House volunteer intern, leaving the room looking‘dishevelled. Her face red and her lipstick off.’ Clear evidence, Tripp thought,that the president might have dropped Monica, but he was still chasing prettygirls.With the Paula Jones trial so much in the news, Linda Tripp became convincedthat the national media would be very interested in further presidential sexrevelations, whatever the consequences for her friend Monica. So, at thebeginning of October 1997, she started taping her telephone conversations withLewinsky while, at the same time, deliberately inciting her to reminisce abouther affair with Bill Clinton. It should also be added that Linda believed thatshe was at risk of being sacked for mentioning the Kathleen Willey incident toNewsweek – so she also saw the tapes as a method of protecting her job, if pushcame to shove.In the meantime, Monica was looking for a new job, having tired of the Pentagon.Betty Currie, Bill Clinton’s personal secretary, contacted an old friend of thepresident, a well-connected Washington DC lawyer called Vernon Jordan, to see ifhe could find Monica a decent job. Lewinsky and Jordan met on 11 December 1997,and he was able to make several helpful suggestions as to where she might findhigh-flying jobs.However, the rumours about Monica and the president were out by this time, ifnot actually in the public eye. Linda Tripp had played a selection of herLewinsky tapes to a small group of journalists from Newsweek magazine, and PaulaJones’s lawyers had somehow come to hear of the alleged relationship between thepresident and the pretty intern. On 17 December, Monica Lewinsky was subpoenaedto give evidence in the Paula Jones trial.On 28 December, Monica Lewinsky made her final visit to the White House,apparently to meet with the president. It has been alleged that he encouragedher to be ‘evasive’ in her deposition to the Jones trial. On 7 January 1998,Monica filed an affidavit in the Jones vs Clinton case, denying any sexualrelationship had ever existed between her and Bill Clinton. She could now befound guilty of perjury if evidence of her affair with the president ever cameout. Linda Tripp delivered her collection of ‘Monica tapes’ into the keeping ofher lawyer, Jim Moody, two days later.All this time, OIC Special Prosecutor Ken Starr had been following the PaulaJones case with interest. His Whitewater fraud investigation into theinvolvement of the Clintons had borne no fruit, despite costing the taxpayertens of millions of dollars. But the Whitewater investigation remained open, andStarr now made a momentous decision – against all previous OIC practice, hedecided to expand his present investigation to encompass a totally unconnectedmatter – the sexual scandal currently engulfing the White House.On 13 January, Linda Tripp met with FBI agents who were working with Starr andthe OIC, and allowed them to place hidden microphones in her clothes. Thus‘wired’ she met with Monica Lewinsky in the Virginia Ritz-Carlton Hotel forlunch. Their subsequent three hour conversation – mostly about Linda’s fearsover being called to give evidence to the Paula Jones trial – was recorded bythe FBI. All this was necessary because Tripp’s phone tapes of Monica’srevelations had been made in the State of Maryland, whose law forbids secretphone taping and thus, arguably, made them inadmissible as evidence in a federalcase.The following day Tripp and Lewinsky met again, and this time Monica handedLinda a document titled: ‘Points to make in an affidavit.’ It was not in factanything to do with her affair with the president, but coached Linda in what tosay about what she knew about Kathleen Willey. The latter had recently givenevidence – following the Newsweek article about her – that Bill Clinton had madeunsolicited sexual advances to her.On 16 January, Ken Starr made an official request to Attorney General Janet Renoto extend the OIC Whitewater investigation to cover ‘possible subornation ofperjury and obstruction of justice in the Paula Jones case’. A panel of threeFederal Court judges agreed the request and, within hours, FBI agents wereinterrupting another meeting between Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp at theRitz-Carlton Hotel.The federal agents took Monica to a suite in the hotel and questioned her forseveral hours. At Monica’s insistence, Tripp came as well, to witness theresults of what Monica considered Linda’s base betrayal of her. The FBI agentstold Monica that they believed that she had been offered a job by the president,via Vernon Jordan, in return for giving a false affidavit in the Jones trial.Monica was then offered the stark choice of at least several years in jail forperjury, or to give evidence as to who had influenced her to give the falsetestimony, in which case the OIC would grant her full immunity from prosecution.She was not arrested, and was eventually allowed to leave, but Monica must havefelt the sword of Damocles was hanging over her head.Matters then began to move quickly. The next day, 17 January, Monica’s lawyer,an old family friend called William Ginsburg, advised her not to sign theimmunity agreement until he had negotiated a better deal with Ken Starr and theOIC. On the same day Bill Clinton gave a written (and therefore non-public)deposition to the Jones trial, denying sexual misconduct with Monica Lewinsky.If he had known that the OIC had evidence against Monica, he probably would havenot committed the perjury. But Monica did not contact him – doubtless fearfulany communication would be detected by the FBI/OIC who might withdraw theirimmunity offer.Also on 17 January, the editorial desk of Newsweek decided not to run theirstory – provided by Linda Tripp – about the Monica tapes. They no doubtregretted this decision three days later when an internet gossip column, theDrudge Report, mentioned rumours of a relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky– the first public revelation of the rumour. The following day, 21 January, thestory made headlines across the world.In the following week, Bill Clinton made several denials, both private andpublic, to ever having sex with Monica Lewinsky, and also denied trying toinfluence her evidence to the Jones trial. Famously, he even went on televisionto state unequivocally: ‘I did not have sexual relations with that woman, MissLewinsky.’Vernon Jordon, the friend of Clinton’s who had offered Monica several jobopportunities, also denied any and all allegations of wrong-doing and went on tostate that Monica had, during their conversation, specifically denied everhaving an affair with the president.Starr reacted by convening a federal grand jury to hear evidence, andimmediately subpoenaing several White House staffers to give testimony,including Clinton’s secretary, Betty Currie. He also demanded access to theWhite House Logbooks – which, of course, would have shown just how often and forhow long Monica had visited and had been closeted alone with the president inthe Oval Office. At the same time, talks between Starr and Monica’s lawyerfailed to come to any agreement over her possible immunity from prosecution.Hillary Clinton, with characteristic tenacity, refused to believe the rumours ofher husband’s adultery and even suggested that a ‘vast right-wing conspiracy’was trying to blacken the president’s name. Even Bill Clinton publicly distancedhimself from this radical theory, but may have agreed with Hillary in private.Hillary later said that she believed the allegations would ‘slowly dissipateover time under the weight of [their] own insubstantiality’.On 29 January, to the relief of all in the Clinton camp, the trial judge sittingon the Jones case ruled any evidence relating to Monica Lewinsky was ‘notessential to the core issues’ being investigated, and therefore could not bepursued by the prosecution. But by now, Starr’s federal grand jury was an evengreater threat to the presidency than the Jones trial. By early February, it wasalready being publicly mooted that Clinton might resign over the Lewinskyaffair. He reacted by giving a press conference in which he told reporters andthe world: ‘I would never walk away from the people of this country and thetrust they’ve placed in me.’In the meantime, in the absence of an agreement to testify between MonicaLewinsky and Ken Starr, Marcia Lewis – Monica’s mother – was called to giveevidence before the grand jury. She was extensively questioned as to anyknowledge she might have as to the alleged affair between the president and herdaughter, but denied any such knowledge.On 11 March, it is alleged by some that the grand jury spent the day listeningto the Linda Tripp telephone tapes, despite their possible inadmissibility asevidence, thanks to the Maryland anti-bugging law.At the same time Kathleen Willey – the ‘other intern’ – had not yet left thepublic stage, and gave an interview to the popular TV show, Sixty Minutes,accusing Clinton of sexually harassing her. The White House reacted by denyingher claims and suggesting she was a publicity seeker, trying to sell the bookrights to her (false) story for $30,000. Willey’s lawyers, in turn, denied thisclaim.On 20 March, Bill Clinton formally invoked his right to presidential immunityfrom having to give evidence to the federal grand jury. Many saw this as adubious strategy, as it made it look as if he had something to hide. Clintonclearly did not want to be put under oath, as he already had been earlier thatyear in the damaging and humiliating Paula Jones case. More damaging revelationson the witness stand, like those that had come out about Gennifer Flowers, couldterminally damage the president’s standing. As noted above, the Jones case wasthrown out by the judge on 1 April, but with a summing-up that further damagedClinton’s credibility.Shortly thereafter Ken Starr filed for the right to call the White House SecretService staff to give evidence – a controversial request, as the men and womenof the security staff were considered legally the deaf-mutes of governmentcircles, before whom anything could be said with safety. Even former presidentGeorge Bush Senior, the man who had lost the White House to Clinton, came out topublicly attack Starr’s request, and some wondered if he had political skeletonsof his own he was anxious to conceal.The White House counteroffensive against Starr was, by now, well under way. Hisopen support of the Republican party was heavily stressed and Clinton went sofar as to suggest that Starr was the cutting edge of a ‘hard, well-financed,vigorous effort’ to undercut the Democrat presidency – an echo of HillaryClinton’s ‘vast right-wing conspiracy’ statement.However, on 5 May, a federal judgement denied Clinton’s claim to presidentialimmunity to subpoena by the grand jury. It was clear that he would have to takethe stand and give a statement under oath for a second time that year. Then, on22 May, the Clinton camp (and presumably ex-president George Bush) receivedanother blow when a federal judge ruled that Starr could indeed call White HouseSecret Service personnel to the grand jury witness stand.Matters were not all going Ken Starr’s way, however. Public feeling against whatmany believed was an overforceful, prurient and partisan hunt for evidence ofsex in the Oval Office was growing. It was neatly expressed by William Ginsburg,Monica’s lawyer, in an open letter to California Lawyer magazine:‘Congratulations, Mr. Starr! As a result of your callous disregard for cherishedconstitutional rights, you may have succeeded in unmasking a sexual relationshipbetween two consenting adults.’Meanwhile, in an odd side issue, Starr was trying to obtain the purchasingrecords of Kramer’s bookstore, seeking to prove that Lewinsky had purchased abook called Vox – a novel about a couple that indulge in phone sex. Somecommentators believed that in doing this he was showing both the weakness of hisbasic case and his cavalier disregard for rights privacy granted by the FirstAmendment of the US Constitution.By late June, however, Starr’s case against the president was gaining momentum.Dale Young, a friend of Monica’s, testified that Monica had confided intimatedetails of her affair with Clinton to her as early as 1996. Shortly thereafter,Linda Tripp took the stand for the first time, accompanied by her children, tomake much the same claim. She also stressed that she did not consider secretlytaping Monica’s telephone revelations as a betrayal of friendship. The publicdid not agree; Linda Tripp rapidly became an object of national revulsion andeven received death threats. The Maryland State’s Attorney also opened aninvestigation into her apparently illegal taping of telephone conversationswithout the agreement or knowledge of her interlocutor; Monica Lewinsky,unsurprisingly, offered unconditional help in the state attorney’sinvestigation.The White House Secret Service personnel gave their evidence in late July but,despite the previous legal fuss about their giving testimony, added little tothe OIC’s case. A secret serviceman’s concentrated effort is aimed at preventingthe president coming into contact with potential assassins, not pretty interns,after all. So, on 25 July, Ken Starr decided to go for the jugular, andsubpoenaed William Jefferson Clinton – 42nd President of the United States. Hewas scheduled to give his testimony the following week.Of course, if Clinton decided to flatly deny having an affair with MonicaLewinsky (and thus to committing perjury in his written statement to the PaulaJones trial) he might still have gotten away. For Starr and the OIC, it becameimperative that Monica herself admit to the affair and her own subsequentperjury.On 28 July, Monica’s lawyers finally came to an agreement with the OIC: inreturn for total immunity, she would admit to the sexual affair and her perjuryto the Jones trial. She would not, however, allow that any pressure had been puton her, by the president or others, to lie on her affidavit. In the face of thismajor defeat, President Clinton decided to be as graceful as possible, sooffered to give his testimony voluntarily, without the need of an enforcingsubpoena. His date to give evidence was set for 17 August, in the White Houseitself.On 6 August, Monica Lewinsky appeared before the federal grand jury. She made agenerally good impression on the stand – an apparently pleasant-natured youngwoman, surprisingly free of bitterness, despite her trapped situation. Naturallyshe was asked about sex:Jury Member: With respect to physical intimacy, other than oral sex [to whichLewinsky had already admitted] was there other physical intimacy performed?Monica Lewinsky: Yes. Everything up until oral sex.Jury Member: OK. And just for the grand jury . . . I’ll just read it . . . Itstates ‘Definition of Sexual Relations.’ For the purpose of the grand jurysession, a person engages in ‘sexual relations’ when the person knowinglyengages or causes contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh,or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desireof any person. Contact means intentional touching, either directly or throughclothing. Ms Lewinsky, do you understand that definition?Monica Lewinsky: Yes, I do.Then there was the matter of the (soon to be) infamous blue dress:Jury Member: Now directing your attention back to February 28th, 1997, the daythat you wore the blue cocktail dress. You mentioned that you believe that therecould be semen on it. Could you describe what you did with the president thatled you to believe that?Monica Lewinsky: We were in the bathroom and I was performing oral sex. I’msorry, this is so embarrassing. And usually he doesn’t want to . . . he didn’twant to . . .Jury Member: Ejaculate?Monica Lewinsky: Yes. And this has sort of been a subject that we had talkedabout many times before and he was always saying it had issues to do with trustand not knowing me well enough at first, and then not feeling right about thingsand – not that he said this – but I took away from that to sort of mean thatmaybe in his mind if he didn’t [ejaculate] then maybe he didn’t need to feelguilty about that. That maybe that was easier for him to rationalize. And it wason this occasion that after we had engaged in oral sex for a while and hestopped me as he normally did and I said to him: ‘You know . . .’ This is soembarrassing. I’m sorry. I said to him: ‘You know, I really . . . I want to makeyou [ejaculate].’The president acquiesced on this occasion, allowing Monica to bring him toorgasm. As they embraced afterwards, Monica said, some of the president’s semenspotted her dress. Of course, by this time the blue dress was already in thehands of the OIC and had been sent for DNA testing.The other, later famous event that came out during Monica’s testimony was theso-called ‘cigar incident’. On one occasion, in a deserted hallway leading tothe Oval Office, the president had been fondling Monica’s breasts and genitals.He then inserted the end of a cigar into Monica’s vagina, put it in his ownmouth and said, grinning: ‘It tastes good.’Monica’s testimony, although videotaped, was given in a non-public session – aswas the president’s sitting before the grand jury on 17 August. He made a verypoor impression – equivocating and self-evidently trying to avoid telling thetruth without actually lying. He repeatedly used vague wordplay andoverstretched definitions to avoid the central issue as to whether he had had asexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. At one point he even replied to astraight question with the sentence: ‘It depends on what the meaning of the word“is” is.’Two days later, one of the many press leaks that apparently originated from theOIC told the public that Clinton had handed over DNA material to allowcross-matching with the semen on the blue dress. Proof positive if there evercould be.On 11 September, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives received alleighteen boxes of evidence collected by the OIC, and promptly published 445pages of the less damaging material. A week later, ignoring furious DemocratParty and White House objections, the House Judiciary Committee released all3,183 pages of the Starr Report to the public, plus the incredibly embarrassingvideotaped testimony of the president.At the cost of making the leader of the USA look like a slippery fool before theentire world, the Republican Party believed that they had won a major victory.The following December, the House of Representatives voted to impeach thepresident on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. However, a slimDemocrat majority in the Senate overturned the decision and, after a year ofdamaging allegation and scandal, President Clinton was free to continue as ifnothing had happened.In retrospect, the Lewinsky investigation most hurt those who had been behindit. Linda Tripp remains a national hate figure and is rumoured to have beenforced to live under an assumed identity. Kenneth Starr’s reputation as a biasedinquisitor spoiled any hopes he may have had for further public office, forcinghim to resign from the OIC and return to his legal practice. Even the RepublicanParty – who must, at one point, have thought they were in a win-win situationwith the Lewinsky affair – did badly in the polls thereafter, winning the 2000presidential election only by what many believe to have been gross vote rigging.Former President Clinton, on the other hand, is generally respected as astatesman, is tipped for the Nobel Peace Prize for his presidential efforts tobring peace to the Middle East, and is said to be making a fortune on theinternational lecture circuit. As a guest speaker at the 2002 British LabourParty Conference, for example, he got a bigger ovation than Labour PrimeMinister, Tony Blair.The long-suffering Hillary Clinton – still firmly married to Bill – has arguablydone even better. She won the election to be Senator to New York, and is thoughtby many to be on the road to being the first female president of the UnitedStates.The generally ill-used Monica Lewinsky, after publishing her biography, hasretired into private life."},{"pageContent":"DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALESTHE SCANDALOUS PRINCESSON 30 AUGUST 1997, Princesses Diana was on a cruise along the coast of Sardinia,in the yacht Jonikal, owned by businessman Mohammed al Fayed, together with thenew man in her life, al Fayed’s son, Dodi. As usual, they were being observed byhordes of paparazzi, including two who were following the yacht in a rubberdinghy with a powerful engine. Sick of being pursued, Dodi decided to fly toParis. They left by a Harrods Gulfstream jet at 1:45 pm, and when they arrivedat Le Bourget an hour and a half later, they were driven to a villa that hadbeen owned by the Duke of Windsor, now the property of Mohammed al Fayed.Although they had been followed there by paparazzi on motorcycles, theever-restless Diana decided that they would leave the security of the villa andgo on to the Ritz Hotel in Paris, also owned by al Fayed, so she could goshopping for birthday presents for her son, Harry. Once in the Imperial Suite,Diana went to have her hair done. She also rang a friendly reporter on the DailyMail to say she intended to quit public life for good. He would mention in hisstory a rumour that she and Dodi Fayed intended to announce their engagement.Dodi now decided to go to his apartment in the Champs Elysées to change fordinner – once more followed by photographers, and by two bodyguards in a RangeRover. Later, finding that a bistro where they had intended to eat wassurrounded by photographers, they returned to the Ritz, and started to eat ameal there. But, nervous about having their privacy invaded by photographers,they left it unfinished and returned to their suite, where they finally atedinner.For some reason, Dodi then decided he wanted to return to his apartment. And hedecided that his regular chauffeur, Philippe Dourneau, should drive off in aRange Rover to mislead the paparazzi, while Henri Paul, who had met them off theplane, should take them to the Champs Elysées apartment, leaving the Ritz by theback way. Paul had been off duty, expecting a quiet evening. He had undoubtedlybeen drinking.The paparazzi were at the back door too, and lost no time in revving theirengines. Henri Paul decided to outrun them, and was soon driving at sixty milesan hour. As they plunged into the steep Alma tunnel, a 142-metre underpass, thecar went out of control and smashed into a concrete pillar. Dodi al Fayed andHenri Paul were killed outright, and Diana was so badly injured that she diedlater in hospital. Only the bodyguard employed by al Fayed, Trevor Rees-Jones,survived, his life saved by an air bag.The sense of shock was tremendous. Since the announcement of the engagement toPrince Charles in February 1981, Diana had been the British public’s favouritemember of the royal family, her beauty and shy demeanour turning her into amedia goddess. Crowds would wait all day outside her home, Kensington Palace, tocatch a glimpse of her. Rumours of her marital problems created widespreadanger. The marriage broke up in 1992, and public sympathy soon swung in Diana’sfavour when Andrew Morton’s book, Diana: Her True Story, revealed that the causeof the split had been the long-standing love affair between Prince Charles andCamilla Parker-Bowles.The lack of public grief displayed by the royal family following Diana’s deathundermined even the Queen’s popularity, and it may have been in response to therising tide of criticism that the royal family took the unusual step ofarranging for the funeral to be televised internationally.Sixteen years earlier, on 29 July 1981, 750 million people had watched themarriage of Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, to Lady Diana Spencer, and afrenzy of media attention had preceded the ceremony. The diffident bride-to-behad been pursued everywhere by gangs of reporters, and the curiosity of theBritish public was fed to bursting by daily stories in competing tabloidnewspapers. In the battle for circulation each one was desperate to outdo theothers with pictures of the couple taken in private, or stories of theircourtship wheedled from close friends. Diana’s face smiled from the cover ofnearly every magazine on the news-stands.The British public’s delight at the prospect of a royal wedding had been mingledwith relief. During the late 70s, Charles’s name had been linked with manyeligible socialites – Davina Sheffield, Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg,Susan George, Sabrina Guinness, Amanda Knatchbull, Anna Wallace, Jane Ward – thelatter the manageress at the Guards Polo Club where the Prince regularly played– but every time the gossip column writers predicted that a royal wedding was inthe offing, their hopes had been frustrated. ‘Sources’ close to the prince wouldreport that the relationship was over, or had never even happened. The generalopinion among royal observers was that Charles, at 31, was taking rather longerthan necessary to sow his wild oats.So when his engagement to Diana was announced on 24 February 1981, the sameroyal observers agreed that his choice showed excellent taste. The bride-to-bewas attractive, charmingly shy in front of the cameras and, most importantly,from the right background; Diana was the third daughter of Earl Spencer. In thetradition of the British royal family, she was not formidably intellectual – shehad left school with only two O levels, and had then taken a course in cookeryand worked as a child minder. Clearly Diana was not intended to take up aprofessional career. She had ‘wife of the gentry’ written all over her.What no one realized until later was that Prince Charles himself was notentirely happy about the idea of marrying Diana Spencer. He had finally givenway to family pressure to settle down and provide an heir – pressure from hismother and father, his Uncle Dickie (Lord Louis Mountbatten), and from the QueenMother, who virtually chose Diana herself – a demure, compassionate girl withthe right social background.In fact, Diana had not had the happy, sheltered life everyone assumed. When shewas three, her mother had fallen in love with another man, and the Spencers weredivorced three years later. She had been brought up by her father. The divorcedisturbed her deeply, and it may have been in reaction that she began to devotemuch attention to sick animals. It also seems to have been responsible for atendency to overeat that made her plump and – in her own eyes – unattractive. Asa teenager she had worked at a kindergarten in Pimlico, and shared a flat withthree friends. But although she had boyfriends, she remained – according to herflatmates – sexually inexperienced; one commentator says this was because shesaw sex as the cause of the breakup of her parents’ marriage, and was afraid ofit.Charles, on the other hand, had had three serious sexual relationships in theyear before the engagement was announced. Since the mid 1970s, many women hadbeen to dinner in his flat in Buckingham Palace and stayed the night. Theprince’s valet, Stephen Barry, later told a gossip columnist how he hadfrequently retrieved items of ladies’ underwear from under the bed or behind thecushions of the settee. If the owner was known, these were laundered andreturned to her in an Asprey gift box; if not, they might be presented tomembers of the Palace staff – occasionally gentlemen. (The same gossip columnistremarks that many of the male staff at Buckingham Palace are homosexual, sincehomosexuals have no wives to divide their loyalties, and tend to enjoy theprotocol of Palace life.) Prince Andrew is reported to have told a girlfriendthat his brother was trying to emulate actor Warren Beatty, who had thereputation of having slept with every attractive starlet in Hollywood. Accordingto gossip columnist Nigel Dempster, there was even a ‘slush fund’ that had beenset up to pay off the women who objected to being one-night stands, a few ofwhom received a dollar cheque running to six figures. Charles seems to have hadno problem financing his high turnover of mistresses.Charles had also had a brief romance with Diana’s sister Sarah (who laterinsisted it had remained platonic), and so the general assumption was that Dianahad begun to feel an interest in Charles at this time – many girls develop acrush on their elder sister’s boyfriends. (Sarah had apparently been finallyrejected by Charles’s vetters because she suffered from anorexia and was a chainsmoker – her sister called her ‘fag-ash Lil’.) The only slight problem seemed tobe the difference in the ages of Charles and Diana. At twenty, Lady Di was morethan ten years younger than her royal husband-to-be.On 29 July 1981, St Paul’s Cathedral was the focus of the world’s attention. Inthe surrounding streets, many were unashamed to weep with joy at the sight oftheir future king and queen. When the couple kissed on the balcony of BuckinghamPalace after the ceremony, the crowds that jammed the Mall screamed theirapproval. Despite the economic recession and Britain’s declining importance inthe league of world powers, the nation was proud; there had been nothing soromantic since Prince Rainier married Grace Kelly in Monaco.Perhaps it was the feeling of anti-climax that followed the wedding that startedthe reaction. Newspapers that had whipped their readership into a frenzy ofnationalism with massive souvenir pullouts and photo specials found it difficultsimply to drop the story and return to more mundane and depressing news. Even ifthe newspapers’ editors had wanted to, competition would not allow it. A paperwith a new picture of Diana outsold its Diana-less rival. The publicity wasunrelenting: every minor occasion at which the Prince and Princess of Walesappeared in public received blanket attention. In the fever of interest in thefuture queen, Charles was sometimes forgotten. At public appearances, it wasclear who the crowds had turned out to see; Charles seemed to take the impliedaffront in good part, apologizing to crowds in Wales that he only had one wife.Soon the purely descriptive news items, praising Diana’s dress-sense and cooingabout the happy couple, began to sound a little repetitive. Clearly, while thepublic’s appetite for royal gossip was undiminished, every tabloid editor sensedthat they were beginning to get bored with positive stories. To vary the diet,feature writers began turning out pieces expressing concern about Diana’swell-being. They pointed out that in February, when the engagement wasannounced, Diana had been a rosy-cheeked, healthy-looking girl who looked as ifshe played hockey every morning before breakfast. By the time of the wedding,she had shed considerable weight, and her cheeks were no longer so rosy. Nodoubt she had been dieting for her wedding day – but could it be that she wasoverdoing it?When, in the months following the wedding, the princess seemed to go on losingweight, the newspapers clucked and worried like maiden aunts. Their anxietycommunicated itself to the public, who responded by buying the newspapers thatsounded most concerned. So when, on 21 November 1981, the palace announced thatDiana was pregnant, everyone heaved a sigh of relief – not least the newspapereditors, who now had an excuse for beginning the party all over again.In February 1982, five months into Diana’s pregnancy, the Waleses holidayed onWindermere Island in the Bahamas. For many years there had been an unspokenagreement between Fleet Street and the Palace that royal holidays were no-goareas. This tradition soon fell victim to the circulation war, and newspaperphotographers secretly photographed Diana in her bikini. These pictures revealedthat, although pregnant, she was still obviously underweight.The publication of these pictures brought a strong rebuke from the Palace. Itwas, said the spokesman, ‘one of the blackest days in British journalism’. Sucha criticism from the royal family was unheard of, mainly becauselong-established guidelines of good taste had previously governed what could beprinted. But in Fleet Street times were changing. The struggle for circulationmeant that such tacit agreements were luxuries that could no longer be afforded.All this prying and intrusion involved a slow change in the attitude ofreporters towards Prince Charles. The tacit agreement that had operated sincethe time of Queen Victoria meant that reporters addressed the Prince of Wales as‘Sir’ and treated him with respect. They still continued to address him as‘Sir’, but the respect was eroding. Charles’s admission that he talked to hisplants in order to encourage them to grow resulted in acres of ridicule in thetabloids. Taken in combination with his avowed liking for the mystical writingsof Sir Laurens van der Post, Charles was made to appear to be a kind ofblue-blooded hippy. Yet he had many sympathizers when, in 1983, he attackedplans for an addition to the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, describing itas a ‘carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend’. (The plans forthe extension were then dropped.)The couple certainly had to endure trial-by-camera. Every time they appearedtogether, the expressions on their faces were analysed and discussed in thecaptions, and they sometimes had to endure intrusion by long telephoto lens.(Charles had been sensitive about such matters ever since he had beenphotographed, in May 1960, lying on a blanket by the river at Balmoral with agirlfriend named Anna Wallace.) Moreover, the smallest physical contact betweenCharles and any other woman who happened to be in the entourage was subjected tothe same minute analysis.There was also an attempt to ‘humanize’ the royal couple with ‘chatty’ (i.e.disrespectful) and ‘homely’ (impertinent) stories – for example, after theWaleses’ second son, Harry was born, the newspapers revealed that William andHarry were known by their parents as the ‘heir and spare’.Now in their fourth year of marriage, Charles and Diana were granted a respite.Finally starved of new material for gossip, the tabloids had turned theirattention to Prince Andrew, Charles’s younger brother. Andrew’s relationshipswith women provided more substantial fare than the diet of innuendo and rumourin the stories about Diana. Andrew was portrayed as libidinous and cheeky. Aconvenient contrast to the intellectual and contemplative Charles, Andrew playedup to the ‘Randy Andy’ tag. He attempted to get TV presenter Selina Scott’sphone number while being interviewed by her for Terry Wogan’s TV programme, andwas often photographed ‘out on the town’ with one-time soft-porn actressKatherine ‘Koo’ Stark.But by 1985, Andrew was 25, the age when royal tradition dictated that he shouldbe thinking of marriage. Then, during the Royal Ascot week party at WindsorCastle, the invited guests were surprised to see Andrew hand-feedingprofiteroles to the freckled and bouncy redhead who was seated next to him. Thewoman was Sarah Ferguson, daughter of Major Ronald Ferguson, Prince Charles’spolo manager. Such open friskiness tied in well with Andrew’s playboy image, andthe papers immediately began to cover the couple’s meetings extensively.And meet they did, often and publicly. At the time of the Ascot party, Sarah hadbeen the girlfriend of racing driver Paddy McNally. It was rumoured that, aftergiving MacNally the ultimatum ‘Marry me or else . . .’, Sarah had decisivelydropped him. The Palace plainly approved of Fergie (as Sarah was known). It was,after all, the seating arrangements at a royal party that had brought themtogether. Such things are not random or accidental.Andrew and Fergie’s engagement was announced in February 1986, to no one’s greatsurprise. Their wedding took place in Westminster Abbey in July of that year.Although not as grand an affair as the wedding of his elder brother, Andrew’swedding excited the same public enthusiasm. Fergie, of course, could hardly beless like Diana; where Diana’s image was shy and demure, Fergie’s waseffervescent and mischievous. Everyone liked her – she looked as if she wouldenjoy a game of darts in the local pub. When newspapers reported that Diana andFergie had dressed up as policewomen in order to gatecrash Andrew’s stag night,no one had any doubt who had thought up the idea.On his marriage, Andrew inherited the title of the Duke of York. The Queen’spresent to the couple was a lease on the Sunninghill estate, as well as themoney to build a family house there.The tone of the articles about the two royal couples became less and lesspositive as the decade wore on. The Duchess of York seemed to be permanently onholiday: she beamed from the ski-slopes or golden beaches at least once a week.Rightly or wrongly the British public suspected that it was their tax revenuesthat were enabling her to live this enviable life. The ‘respectable’ newspapersbegan to voice a certain irritation with the British obsession with the youngermembers of the royal family, and the Independent newspaper, which had just beenestablished, expressed the broadsheets’ boredom with royal stories by coveringBeatrice’s birth with a single line in the Births, Marriages and Deaths columnin the back pages. Again there was criticism when, after the birth of PrincessBeatrice, the Duchess of York went off to join her husband in Australia withouther daughter, and yet again when she took her daughter skiing in Switzerlandwhile she still had a chickenpox rash. Her plans for her new home in Berkshirewere derided as vulgar and ostentatious.What was worse, from the point of view of the royal family, was that it was veryobvious that all was not well between Charles and Diana. She was blamed becausemembers of Charles’s household were said to have resigned because they found hertoo demanding. Even in the mid-1980s it was noted that the couple seemed tospend little time together, and that they seemed to barely tolerate each otherin public. The days of sunny smiles for the cameras seemed to be past.By the late 1980s the tabloids were busy spreading doubts about the strength ofboth marriages. Prince Charles, they hinted regularly, was having an affair withCamilla Parker-Bowles, an old girlfriend now married. Fergie was also suspectedof infidelity with Texan millionaire Steve Wyatt, her financial advisor. Yet noreal evidence, apart from whispered confidences from sources ‘close to Charles’or ‘a Palace insider’, were offered. But it seemed clear that the newspapersknew more than they were prepared to print; they regularly hinted that theycould not tell the full truth.Things began to fall apart for the Yorks in January 1992. Maurice Marple, awindow cleaner, had been hired by an estate agent to clean a flat in CadoganSquare. While throwing out the unwanted property left by the previous tenant,Marple happened upon a thick stack of photos perched on top of a wardrobe. Idlyflicking through them before consigning them to the black plastic sack, Marplesuddenly recognized the face of the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson. Some of thephotos showed the duchess and a handsome tanned man in swimsuits, laughing andhaving a good time. Others showed the unidentified man playing with PrincessBeatrice, and riding a horse beside Fergie. What the other photos showed is notknown.Marple decided that the newspapers would be interested in his discovery. He tookthem to the Daily Mail who advised him to give them to the police. Whether hedid this is not clear; all that is known is that some of the photographs werepublished in Paris-Match.During the next few days the British tabloids made much of their restraint innot publishing the pictures. But they dropped very broad hints that the photosshowed the duchess in inappropriate positions with a man identified as the Texanmillionaire Steve Wyatt.In fact, the affair had been known to all Fergie’s friends for a long time.Wyatt was undoubtedly handsome, in a lean, Texan way, with very white teeth. Heand Fergie had met in 1990, when Prince Andrew was away from home – in the navy– for all but 42 nights of the year. She was pregnant when she visited Wyatt’sranch in Texas, but the affair progressed nevertheless. In a French Rivierarestaurant with Fergie and Saddam Hussein’s oil marketing chief (this was soonafter Saddam’s invasion of Kuwait), Wyatt embarrassed Lord McAlpine and hisguests by pulling Fergie into his lap with the comment: ‘Mah woman and I sittogether.’ Eventually, Fergie was persuaded by the Queen and her own mother todrop the indiscreet Wyatt. By January 1992, when the photograph scandal was thetalk of London, the affair with Wyatt was already over.For Prince Andrew, this seems to have been the last straw. On 19 March 1992, twomonths after the Wyatt photos story, the Yorks announced that they had decidedto separate. To a stunned public, this seemed to be a full acknowledgement ofthe duchess’s adultery. Before this new information had had time to sink in, thepublic was hit with a bigger revelation.DIANA DRIVEN TO FIVE SUICIDE BIDS BY ‘UNCARING CHARLES’ shrieked the headline ofthe Sunday Times on 7 June 1992. The story beneath contained some of the moststartling revelations from a new book by Andrew Morton, a royal journalist,entitled Diana: Her True Story. What made this book different from other similarworks – like Lady Colin Campbell’s Diana in Private – was that it was plainlywritten with some cooperation from the Princess of Wales. Morton had quite astory to tell. The book revealed that Diana had been doubtful about marryingCharles from the start. Since 1972, Charles had been friendly with CamillaParker-Bowles; they were so close that they addressed one another as Fred andGladys. Camilla was married to Andrew Parker-Bowles, a member of the Queen’shousehold, and Diana had known her since 1980. At first, Diana was unsuspicious,even when she learned that Camilla was reputed to ‘vet’ all Charles’sgirlfriends. She remained unsuspicious when Camilla asked her if she meant tohunt when she was at Highgrove (Prince Charles’s new house), and looked relievedwhen Diana said no. But a few weeks before their wedding, she learned thatCharles and Camilla used nicknames when Charles had sent Camilla a get-wellbouquet inscribed ‘from Fred to Gladys’. And when, on the eve of her wedding,she learned that Charles intended to give Camilla a bracelet inscribed GF(which, according to an alternative source, stood for ‘Girl Friday’, another ofCharles’s pet nicknames for Camilla), it dawned on her with an awful sense ofcertainty that Camilla was her future husband’s mistress, and that he had nointention of breaking off the relationship when he married. She came close tocalling the wedding off the night before the ceremony.When, on their honeymoon, photographs of Camilla fell out of Charles’s diary,and when she noticed that he wore cufflinks with two ‘Cs’ intertwined – which headmitted had been given to him by a woman he had loved and lost – her worstsuspicions were confirmed.Understandably, she was shattered. Ever since her parents’ divorce she had beenafraid of love, but was willing to suspend her distrust and learn to become acaring wife and mother. Now it was obvious that she was simply the third in atriangle and that, like so many women who had married princes of the Britishroyal family, she was going to be expected to close her eyes to her husband’sinfidelities.On the eve of the wedding, Charles allayed her fears when he sent her a signetring and an affectionate note. But all the tension made her eat more than sheintended to, then vomit it all up.They spent the honeymoon on the royal yacht Britannia, and here again, she beganto feel excluded. She wanted to spend time getting to know her husband – withwhom she was by now deeply in love. Charles took along his fishing tackle and apile of books by his mentor, Laurens van der Post, who had written of thebushmen of South Africa, and had been a friend of the psychologist Carl Jung.They hardly ever seemed to be alone. Again, Diana’s response to stress was tocreep into the kitchen and eat bowl after bowl of ice cream.What no one realized was that Diana was suffering from the nervous disordercalled bulimia nervosa, which involves overeating, usually followed by vomiting.Its sufferers tend to experience extreme mood-swings, and may become suicidal.Clearly, both Charles and Diana had problems. He had thought he was marrying anuncomplicated girl who would enjoy being Princess of Wales and then queen; tolearn – as he soon did – that she had nervous problems must have been a shock.For her part, she thought she was marrying a kind of protective father-figurewho would help her to adjust to her new life. But he seemed to live on anotherplane, and although he took her for long walks and read her page after page byJung and van der Post, she felt she was being talked down to.But the major problem, of course, was her suspicion that her husband was stillin love with Camilla Parker-Bowles, and meant to renew their relationship at thefirst opportunity. They began to have violent rows about Camilla. And once anewly married couple start having violent rows, the marriage has lost its chanceof the kind of slow and idyllic growth that can form the basis of a lifelongpartnership; the golden bowl had developed a crack.What she now needed was some close support from her husband, a reassurance thatall would be well. But Charles seemed unable or unwilling to offer suchreassurance. He seemed to feel that she was suffering from neurotic schoolgirltantrums, and that what was really needed was that she should pull herselftogether. Most of the royal family seemed to feel much the same. On New Year’sDay 1982, when she was three months pregnant with Prince William, she threatenedsuicide, and Charles accused her of being hysterical. When he went off riding onthe Sandringham estate, she hurled herself down a long wooden staircase.It was the Queen Mother, the major architect of the marriage, who found herlying dazed at the bottom, trembling with shock, and who sent for help. Ahastily summoned gynaecologist was able to assure everyone that both Diana andthe foetus were unharmed.Far from winning sympathy from her husband, it infuriated him as a piece ofmelodramatic hysteria. In a sense, the marriage ended then, less than a yearafter it had begun.According to Lady Colin Campbell in Diana in Private, Diana also felt that shewas an outsider in the royal family. The Queen, says Lady Colin, had absolutelynothing in common with Diana, and ‘the gulf between them grew worse and worse’.Princess Anne simply regarded Diana as ‘an airhead and a lightweight’ and couldnot understand why Charles had married her. But one day, at the dinner table,when Diana dropped into the conversation a question about how they saw the roleof the royal family in a united Europe, they regarded her with puzzlement for afew moments, then went back to discussing hunting. Diana’s increasingfrustration is understandable. Morton describes how Diana one day threw herselfagainst a glass display cabinet, and how, during one argument with PrinceCharles, she seized a penknife and cut herself on the chest and thighs.Charles’s reaction was to ignore her.For Charles it must have seemed that the fairy-tale marriage had turned into akind of hell. The sweet, shy twenty-year-old, who was supposed to adore him andbe delighted that he had introduced her to a new and wonderful life had turnedout to be a vengeful neurotic who spent half her time in tears and was alwayscomplaining. He must have wished that he had taken his courage into his handsall those years before, and married Camilla, who thoroughly understood him.The arrival of Prince William improved things for a while; Charles loved being afather, and was well suited to the role. Then there was a reaction, and Dianaplunged back into depression. She began to see a psychiatrist (Jungian,naturally), but continued to lose weight. Diana and Charles moved between theirtwo homes, Kensington Palace and Highgrove, but they had so little social lifethat their butler described working for them as boring.On the other hand, Charles continued to hunt with the Parker-Bowleses, and sawCamilla regularly. And Diana ‘found a shoulder to lean and cry on’ in herpersonal bodyguard, Sergeant Barry Mannakee. Morton notes that ‘the affectionatebond that built up between them did not go unnoticed either by Prince Charles orMannakee’s colleagues’. Mannakee was later transferred to other duties, and waskilled in a motorcycle accident. No impropriety has ever been alleged, but itseems clear that, lacking emotional support from her husband and the royalfamily, she felt a need to look for it elsewhere.The romance between Prince Andrew and Fergie provided a welcome diversion. Dianaand Fergie became close friends, and Diana, now more confident, guided Fergiethrough the routine of being a ‘royal’. In public, she was self-possessed and ascharming as ever. But she still felt that she was a kind of royal cipher. Therewas the occasion when she prepared a surprise for the royal family when theywere due to spend an evening watching ballet at Covent Garden. She and leadingdancer Wayne Sleep had rehearsed a routine in secret at Kensington Palace. Theaudience gasped when Diana stepped out onto the stage in a silver silk dress,and danced a specially choreographed routine to the song ‘Uptown Girl’,revealing that she had the makings of a first-class dancer. The audienceapplauded wildly, and she took eight curtain calls, even curtseying to the royalbox. But Charles later told her he thought that it had all been undignified and‘showy’.Even by 1987, it was becoming obvious to the press that the royal marriage wasunder some strain. Diana and Fergie came in for criticism for ‘frivolity’ whenboth were photographed at a race meeting poking a friend in the backside withtheir umbrellas. When Diana and a group of friends had a weekend party at thestately home of the parents of a young man named Philip Dunne, a gossipcolumnist reported that Diana had spent the weekend alone with him. When she wasambushed by a photographer as she emerged from a cinema with a group of friendsthat included a young man called David Waterhouse, Waterhouse leaped apedestrian barrier and fled into the night, causing more gossip than if he hadstayed put.In 1987, her confidence fortified by a new doctor who seemed to be helping herto conquer her bulimia, Diana cornered Camilla Parker-Bowles at a birthday partyand accused her of sleeping with her husband. Whether Camilla admitted it or notMorton does not record, but he tells us that the explosion ‘helped Diana to cometo terms with her jealousy and anger’.At about this time – in 1988 – a polo player named Captain James Hewitt cameinto Diana’s life when he began to teach Princes William and Harry horsemanship.She visited his home in Devon, and they were soon the subject of suspicion onthe part of the royal family. A colour-sergeant later told the News of the Worldthat he had been part of a surveillance team whose job was to spy on the coupleand photograph them making love in the garden. Hewitt’s friend, Anna Pasternak,later wrote a book – with his co-operation – in which she admitted that they hadbeen lovers.The reason for this oddly brash piece of behaviour on Diana’s part seems to liein Morton’s comment that the royal couple drifted apart to the extent ofmarshalling rival battalions of friends in their support. In a book calledClosely Guarded Secret, Inspector Ken Wharfe, who became Diana’s official‘minder’ in 1987, states that Hewitt was deeply in love with Diana, and wantedher to marry him; Diana, unattracted by the idea of becoming nothing moreexciting than an officer’s wife, decided to drop him.Morton also commented that Prince Charles ‘counted on’ Andrew and CamillaParker-Bowles for social support. Their home, Middlewich House, was only twelvemiles from Highgrove House. A Sunday newspaper spoke about the unmarked Fordestate car in which Charles frequently drove to Middlewich House.When, in January 1992, Prince Andrew and Fergie visited the Queen at Sandringhamto confess that their marriage was on the rocks – partly due to the latest pressuproar about her relationship with Steve Wyatt – the Queen asked them for atwo-month ‘cooling off’ period before they announced their separation. Thiscompleted, the press was informed that their marriage was over. Yet Charles andDiana were still officially together, even though they lived apart.When Andrew Morton’s Diana: Her True Story was published in 1992, afterserialization in the Sunday Times, it combined all these scandalous revelationswith a glowingly positive assessment of the princess, in which her work forcharity and her love for her children featured prominently. In this respect itread like one of the countless glossy coffee table books that portrayed theroyal family as practitioners of all the old-fashioned virtues, but Morton, withthe help of Diana’s friends, had taken this genre and cross-bred it withkiss-and-tell Hollywood scandal sheets. It sold massively, making Morton awealthy man.In the postscript to the paperback edition, Morton begins: ‘The days ofpretending were over forever.’ The book, apparently, had led the couple to faceup to the collapse of their marriage. From now on, they were to live separatelives.That summer of 1992, Fergie was back in the news. ‘Fergie’s Stolen Kisses’shouted the Daily Mail headline. An Italian long-lens paparazzo, Daniel Angeli,had snapped the duchess with her financial advisor John Bryan, a tall,prematurely balding Texan who had been a schoolfriend of Steve Wyatt. They wereholidaying together, with the duchess’s children, in a villa in the woodsoutside St Tropez. In one photo, Bryan kisses the duchess’s toes. The duchess istopless in the shots. Fergie was already virtually unmentionable within theroyal family, and the photographs seemed to make any reconciliation out of thequestion.Then, just at the point when Fergie was squirming uncomfortably in thespotlight, it was switched back to Diana again. On 24 August 1992, the Sunpublished an account of a taped conversation between Princess Diana and asecond-hand car dealer, James Gilbey. ‘My Life Is Torture: Dianagate tape oflove call reveals marriage misery’ declared the headline. The conversation opensarrestingly:> GILBEY: And so, darling, what are the other lows today?> DIANA: So that was it . . . I was very bad at lunch. And I nearly started> blubbing. I just felt really sad and empty, and I thought: ‘Bloody hell, after> all I’ve done for this fucking family.’On the 23 minute tape, Gilbey addresses her as ‘Squidgey’ (fourteen times) and‘darling’ (53 times), and at one point they blow kisses to one another down thephone. He tells her that he hasn’t played with himself for 48 hours, and thatsomething was ‘very strange and very lovely too.’ Diana replies: ‘I don’t wantto get pregnant.’ ‘Darling, that’s not going to happen. All right? . . . Youwon’t get pregnant.’ After more general conversation, Gilbey tells her: ‘Justhave to wait till Tuesday.’In fact, the tape had been recorded two years earlier, in December 1989, by aneavesdropper on the princess’s mobile phone, using a device called a ‘scanner’.It appeared to reveal that Diana had been on intimate terms with Gilbey whileshe and Charles were still living together. Yet the real interest of the tapelies in the enormous weariness Diana expresses regarding her in-laws. Here wasfurther proof of the misery of the princess and the lack of communication at theheart of the monarchy. A debate about whether Diana and Gilbey did or did nothave sex raged in the papers for weeks.Oddly enough, the tape did Diana no harm with the British public. The suggestionthat she had a lover added a dimension to her personality; the comment: ‘I don’twant to get pregnant’ substituted the image of a woman capable of sexual passionfor the demure schoolgirl persona that had made her seem a permanent virgin.Prince Charles was reported to have been disgusted by the publicity, while Dianais on record as saying that it was a catharsis.On 9 December 1992, Buckingham Palace announced ‘with regret’ that the Princeand Princess of Wales had decided to separate.Five weeks later, on Sunday 17 January 1993, the Sunday Mirror and the Peoplepublished in full a tape of another recorded telephone conversation, this timebetween Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles; like the Gilbey-Diana tape, ithad been recorded by an eavesdropper. This conversation had, in fact, takenplace on 17 December 1989, two weeks before the Gilbey-Diana tape. It wasconsiderably more explicit. When Camilla says: ‘You’re awfully good at feelingyour way along,’ Charles replies: ‘O, stop! I want to feel my way all along you,all over you, and up and down you and in and out . . . particularly in and out.’Camilla replies: ‘O, that’s just what I need at the moment.’ Charles suggests:‘I’ll just live inside your trousers or something. It would be much easier.’‘What, are you going to turn into a pair of knickers? You’re going to come backas a pair of knickers.’ ‘Or,’ says Charles, ‘God forbid, a Tampax. Just myluck! . . . to be chucked down a lavatory and go forever swirling around thetop, never going down . . .’In Behind Palace Doors, an even more revelatory book than Morton’s, gossipcolumnist Nigel Dempster reports that when Charles heard about the tape, fourdays before it was published, he kept repeating: ‘How can it all have gone wrongso quickly?’ He may have been cheered when, after newspaper publication of thetape, a crowd of well-wishers at Sandringham shouted: ‘Good old Charlie’, but aclose friend commented:> It was the worst moment of his life. He wanted to be taken seriously, to be> given respect as a man. He sincerely believed that he had important things to> say. He wanted to be thought profound. And in six minutes of private> conversation, a conversation that was nobody’s business but his and the woman> to whom he was speaking, his reputation was ruined. Maybe it was a delusion> that he was something of a sage and a philosopher, but it was a fairly> harmless delusion. The downfall of a prince holds a terrible fascination, but> he really didn’t deserve to be destroyed so publicly.A passage from the Encyclopedia Yearbook for 1992 summarizes succinctly thevarious problems encountered by the royal family in 1992:> During 1992 the media chronicled the breakdown of the marriage of the Prince> and Princess of Wales. Andrew Morton’s Diana: Her True Story revealed that> their marital problems had provoked several suicide attempts by the princess.> Although Morton had not interviewed Diana, it quickly became clear that he had> spoken to several of her closest friends, and that she had, tacitly at least,> authorized their disclosures. The stories about the couple, amplified by> aggressive reporting by tabloid newspapers, added to the pressure on the royal> family, which had seen the divorce of the Princess Royal (the Prince of> Wales’s sister) and the separation of the Duke and Duchess of York earlier in> 1992. Finally, on 9 December, Buckingham Palace announced that the Prince and> Princess of Wales would separate. This announcement completed what the Queen> described as an ‘annus horribilis’ in a rare public comment on her troubles> during a speech on the occasion of her 40th anniversary on the throne. Not> only had every one of the first marriages of her children ended in separation,> but she also had to contend with a fire that destroyed much of the interior of> Windsor Castle on 20 November. The government agreed to finance the castle’s> restoration, in line with established policy towards the royal castles,> leaving the Queen to pay only for the furnishings that had been destroyed> within her private apartments.

The one undoubted> source of joy to the royal family in the final weeks of a difficult year was> the Princess Royal’s wedding on 12 December to Commander Timothy Laurence, a> former equerry (aide) to the Queen.The prince’s ‘downfall’ was not as catastrophic as his friend seemed to suspect,and time has blurred the memory of the ‘Camillagate’ tape, although it wasrevived in 1995 by the divorce of Andrew and Camilla Parker-Bowles. Charles andCamilla were married in a civil ceremony in 2005. Although a Daily Mirror pollonce indicated that 63 per cent of readers believed that Charles was not fit tobe king, and that the crown should pass direct to Prince William, there seems tobe little doubt that, when the time comes, Prince Charles will become KingCharles III.Princess Di continued to be controversial up to her death. After announcing thatshe was giving up public appearances and returning to private life, shecontinued to appear at many public events. And scandals continued to beassociated with her name. Her friend, Oliver Hoare, complained to the policethat a caller was ringing his home in the early hours of the morning, thenhanging up without speaking; when the police investigated, they found that thecalls were coming from Kensington Palace. And the year-old marriage of England’srugby captain, Will Carling, came to an end after reports that he was seeing agreat deal of Diana.The Daily Mirror poll also found that 42 per cent of readers thought thatBritain would be no worse off without a royal family, and that one in six feltthat the monarchy would not survive beyond the end of the twentieth century.Diana’s endless capacity to generate scandal was demonstrated again in October2002, with the trial of her butler, 43-year-old Paul Burrell – whom she hadcalled her ‘rock’ – on a charge of stealing hundreds of items belonging to Dianaand Prince William. Paul Burrell, a lorry driver’s son, had been a member of theQueen’s household before he became Princess Diana’s butler.On 31 August 1997, Burrell had flown to Paris, and been handed the clothes inwhich Diana had died. He had dressed her body in clean clothes for its return toEngland. That November he was appointed a member of the committee to choose amemorial to Diana. But a month later he was sacked because of disagreements withfellow members.In January 2000, Burrell was arrested at his Cheshire home, accused of stealingover 300 items belonging to Princess Diana. He was granted bail, and latercharged at Bow Street Magistrate’s Court on 16 August 2001. The trial itself didnot begin until 14 October 2002, but was stopped two days later for legalreasons, and started again on the 17th.Then, on 1 November 2002, the trial collapsed dramatically when the Queencorroborated Burrell’s story that he had told her two years earlier that he hadtaken certain of Diana’s possessions into ‘safe keeping’. But the Queen’sintervention was received with widepspread scepticism. Was it coincidence thatBurrell was about to appear in the witness box on the day the trial was stopped?Burrell’s acquittal was soon followed by rumours that he had been offeredimmense sums of money by tabloid newspapers for his story.No one believed that he would be tempted. At a butler’s convention in Denver in2001, Burrell had made the keynote speech, underlining the importance ofdiscretion, and been received with a standing ovation.So there was general astonishment when it was revealed that he had accepted£300,000 from the Labourite tabloid the Daily Mirror, turning down a millionfrom another tabloid – he had chosen the Mirror because it had agreed to hisinsistence that he should not ‘tell all’, but only what he wanted to tell.A foretaste of the revelations appeared in the Daily Mail, in an article byRichard Kay, a journalist Diana had treated as a friend. Kay explained that whathad worried the butler was what was happening to Diana’s possessions. Herletters were being shredded, and the Spencer family were taking many of herpossessions to their home, Althorp, the Spencer family seat in Northamptonshire.Just before Christmas 1998, Burrell asked if he could see the Queen, and spentthree hours pouring out his heart. Diana had not even spoken to her mother,Frances Shand Kydd, for the last six months before the car accident, because hermother had criticized her taste in lovers, with special reference to Muslims:heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, and businessman Gulu Lalvani. Yet now the Spencerswere setting themselves up as sole guardians of her memory. Butler feltparticularly bitter because when he was sacked from the fund, a ‘senior figure’(Kay is too discreet to name names) sneered at his working class origin:‘Remember where you’re from.’ Burrell ended that long session with the Queen bytelling her that he was taking some of Diana’s possessions back home with him‘for safe keeping’.When the Serious Crimes Squad arrived at Burrell’s home in January 2001, theywere searching specifically for the contents of a large mahogany box in whichDiana kept intimate papers and possessions – what some tabloids came to refer toas ‘the crown jewels’. The box itself was now at Althorp, empty. The police werearmed with a list supplied by Diana’s elder sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, ofcertain things – such as cufflinks and ties – that Burrell was entitled to keep.Anything else, it was implied, was stolen. And so it was that in June that year,Burrell was charged with theft.Why did he not do the obvious thing, and direct the Serious Crimes Squad toBuckingham Palace, where the Queen would back up his story that he was trying tokeep Diana’s private possessions out of the hands of the Spencers? The answerseems to lie in Burrell’s well-known discretion. The butler felt he had a pactof confidentiality with the royal family. Was he to drag the Queen’s name intothis sordid squabble about love letters?The royals were infuriated at the way Burrell was being treated. Prince Charleseven had a row with his police bodyguard, Stuart Osborne, about Burrell, whom hewanted to help, while Osborne was on the side of the police investigators.Charles felt Burrell was being persecuted because of his loyalty to Diana, andhe got so angry with Osborne that he ordered the driver to stop the car and toldthe bodyguard to get out.Burrell had had a bad time of it while he was awaiting his trial, and money haddried up, so he was on the verge of bankruptcy. So that last-minute rescue bythe Queen must have come as an immense relief. Without it, Burrell would fairlycertainly have faced prison and ruin. The Daily Mail had no doubt who wasresponsible for this; its headline declared: THE BITTER SPENCERS, JEALOUS OF HISINTIMACY WITH DIANA, INSISTED ON PROSECUTION.Inevitably, the Serious Crimes Squad was also blamed – it was felt that they hadplunged into this prosecution, hoping it would bring them as much kudos as theJeffrey Archer investigation, and allowing themselves to be convinced ofBurrell’s guilt by the Spencer family. (In fact, Earl Spencer declared afterBurrell’s acquittal that he was furious with the police for bringing theprosecution on such slender evidence.)The picture of Diana that emerged in Burrell’s Daily Mirror revelations showedher as tense, emotionally insecure and thoroughly neurotic. She had beenemotionally fixated on a Pakistani heart surgeon, Hasnat Khan, whom she had metat the Royal Brompton Hospital in August 1996, where he was working under thefamous heart surgeon Sir Magdi Yacoub. Khan, six feet tall and good looking, wassitting by a patient’s bed when Diana came to visit the husband of heracupuncturist Oonagh Toffolo. They soon became lovers, and Burrell used tosmuggle Khan into Kensington Palace in the boot of his car. On one occasionDiana dressed up in sapphire and diamond earrings before going into her bedroomand removing all her clothes. Then she came out to go and meet Khan in only along fur coat. She was on her way to his flat near the Brompton’s sisterhospital, Harefield, in Middlesex, where she would often gain access by climbingthrough the window.Khan was a quiet, good-natured man, modest, unassuming, and totally obsessed byhis work. He had been twice engaged to marry Muslim girls who had been chosen byhis family, but both engagements had fallen through. And it seems clear that hewas soon feeling under pressure from Diana’s highly emotional nature. After theyhad spent the night together, she would often telephone him as soon as hearrived at work, once even insisting on speaking to him when he was in theoperating theatre. When he was unable to take her calls, she assumed that he wasavoiding her, and rang friends in floods of tears. ‘She was besotted with him,’said one friend. This was obviously a recurring pattern – it had happened withMajor James Hewitt and Oliver Hoare.The mild, studious Khan, whose ambition was to become a professor, was soonwishing he had not been drawn into the relationship. Diana was determined tomarry him, and to this end she insisted on meeting his family in the small townof Jhelum, in Pakistan, where she made a close friend of his grandmother, NannyAppa; she also became a regular visitor at the home of his uncle Omar and wifeJane at Stratford-upon-Avon, and enjoyed feeling a part of the family, insistingon doing the washing up.She confided in one friend that she was thinking of getting pregnant to makesure Khan married her.Khan found the emotional pressure-cooker atmosphere unbearable, and disliked iteven more when rumours of their relationship began to circulate, and he becamean object of curiosity. He realized that marrying her would simply have theeffect of turning him into ‘Mr Diana’ and making him a media celebrity. WhenPaul Burrell delivered letters from Diana into his hands, sitting in thehospital waiting room, the surgeon began to feel persecuted. The less responsivehe became, the more obsessive became his frantic lover; finally, he was in fullflight, with Diana in pursuit. When he saw her car waiting near his flat, hewould hurry away.When they finally parted in May 1997, they did so on friendly terms; but eventhen, Diana failed to keep her side of the bargain and stayed in touch.It was after this that she had an affair with an electronics tycoon, GuluLalvani. It has been reported that he now accepts that she was simply using himin an attempt to make Khan jealous. She did not succeed. Neither did her affairwith Dodi al Fayed have that effect; besides, they were basically unsuited, forDodi was too much under his father’s shadow to offer her the kind of qualitiesshe was looking for in a husband. Burrell dismisses the idea that the two becameengaged just before her death.The butler’s acquittal lit the touch paper of another scandal. Among the‘stolen’ articles belonging to Diana, the police were hoping to find a cassetteof an interview with a former palace footman, George Smith, who claimed he hadbeen the victim of a homosexual rape by one of Prince Charles’s servants; this,he alleged, had taken place in a kitchen in 1989. (David Davies, a retired chiefsuperintendent who had been in charge of the royal protection squad, would latercomplain about the problems caused by ‘promiscuous’ gay staff who sometimesbrought male prostitutes into the palace.) Smith reported the rape in 1996, andthere was a seven-month internal enquiry, which ended by deciding that there wasnot enough evidence to prosecute the accused man, one of Prince Charles’sclosest aides. But it seems that Diana decided to pursue her own enquiry, andmade a tape-recording of Smith’s story, which subsequently vanished. Diana wasclearly out to embarrass her former husband when the opportunity arose. A friendof Smith reports him as saying that the rapist then stole the tape from Diana’sapartment.Another item that had now vanished, according to Burrell, was seven videotapesmade by the princess, staring straight into the camera, laying bare ‘herinnermost feelings about her loneliness and isolation, making stunning newdisclosures about how Prince Charles betrayed her with Camilla Parker-Bowles.’The tapes were found when the Serious Crimes Squad made its raid on Burrell’shome, but were deemed ‘too sensitive’ to be mentioned at the trial.When the trial of Paul Burrell was abruptly terminated, there was inevitablyspeculation that there was a cover-up involving the Smith ‘rape tape’, and therewere demands for an inquiry into whether there had been an attempt to pervertthe course of justice.Prince Charles called in a prestigious law firm, Kingsley Napley, to representhis ‘trusted aide’, at an initial cost of £100,000; he also approached a topbarrister for advice on what to do if the aide should be named in the press.When the Palace then announced that there would be another ‘internal inquiry’into the rape allegations, there were groans of disapproval from the press, andmore allegations of a cover-up. Why, they wanted to know, an internal inquiry,rather than calling in the police?One of Prince Charles’s top aides, Michael Fawcett, also found himselfspotlighted in this storm of allegations and counter-allegations. He was accusedof ‘fencing’ Prince Charles’s cast-offs, as well as official gifts (of whichheads of state inevitably receive a vast quantity), and taking a cut of between10 and 20 per cent on the sales, the prince receiving the remainder. The LabourMP Ian Davidson, a member of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said that ifthe allegations were true, ‘we would certainly want to look into that. All themoney they receive should be used to offset the huge sums that the public purseprovides for them.’ Mr Fawcett, it was later announced, was to go on indefiniteleave.All of which made it clear that, even five years after her death, PrincessDiana’s ability to cause embarrassment to the royal family remains undiminished.At the close of 2002, the media revealed that James Hewitt was offering Diana’sletters to him for sale on the open market for ten million pounds. PrincesWilliam and Harry, it was reported, were considering buying them. Prince Charlesshowed no reaction."},{"pageContent":"THE DREYFUS AFFAIRTHE POLITICAL SCANDAL THAT SHOOK FRANCETHE DREYFUS SCANDAL, usually known simply as ‘the affair’, is probably the mostfamous cause célèbre of all time. It divided France, caused unprecedentedbitterness, and finally became an international scandal that tarnished thereputation of France.On the morning of 26 September 1894, Major Hubert-Joseph Henry, a Frenchintelligence officer, summoned a number of War Office colleagues and showed thema handwritten document written on onion-skin paper. It was unsigned, but itslast sentence: ‘I am just going on manoeuvres’, made it clear that it had beenwritten by an officer. The writer said that he was sending five documents andthen listed them: a note on an army field gun, on artillery formations, andsimilar items. It had been recovered from the waste-paper basket of Colonel Maxvon Schwartzkoppen, the German military attaché in Paris and it indicatedunmistakably that a French officer was betraying his country by spying forGermany. After the Franco-Prussian war of 1870–1, the French general staffsuffered an understandable phobia about Germany and no one doubted that the twocountries would soon be at war again. This is why the unsigned letter – thebordereau (list) as it came to be known – caused so much fury and dismay.Colonel Jean-Conrad Sandherr, Henry’s immediate superior, had the letterphotographed and copies circulated to all departments of the War Office, askingif anyone recognized the handwriting. A certain Captain Alfred Dreyfus soon cameunder suspicion. He was not much liked, partly because he was a Jew – there wasmuch anti-Semitism in the French army – and partly because he was inclined to becritical of his superiors. A sample of Dreyfus’s handwriting was compared withthe bordereau and there was a general agreement that they were identical.There were obvious reasons for doubting that Dreyfus could be a spy. To beginwith, he was rich – his family owned a cotton-spinning mill in Mulhouse – andsecondly, he came of an intensely patriotic family who, when the Germans hadseized Alsace, had preferred to emigrate rather than adopt German citizenship.But the evidence of the handwriting struck Sandherr as conclusive. Dreyfus wassummoned to the War Office and asked to write down words that would be dictatedby a certain Major Du Paty de Clam. The major dictated the words of thebordereau, then suddenly grabbed Dreyfus by the shoulder and shouted, ‘CaptainDreyfus, in the name of the law I arrest you . . .’ The bewildered Dreyfusretorted, ‘I’m going mad!’Long before his trial, the French press – known as the most irresponsible andcorrupt in Europe – had convicted him. France was in political turmoil with massunemployment, falling prices, widespread hunger, and the wine industry ruined bya curse known as phylloxera; the Dreyfus scandal was exactly what was needed todistract the public from these miseries. One newspaper reported that Dreyfus wasa gambler who had been losing thousands of francs a night; another declared thathe had confessed to his treachery. Major Henry kept the press fed with rumours.And when the trial opened, on 19 December 1894, no one had the slightest doubtthat Alfred Dreyfus was a traitor. The defence protested at the decision to holdthe trial in camera, arguing that it would surround Dreyfus with a wall ofsecrecy. The protest was overruled. Major Henry declared on oath that an‘honourable person’ had told him that there was a traitor in the war ministry,then pointed at Dreyfus and declared, ‘There is the traitor.’ When Dreyfusdemanded the name of his accuser, Henry replied, ‘There are secrets in anofficer’s head which must not even be revealed to his képi [his cap].’ Asked toswear on his honour that an ‘honourable person’ had named Dreyfus as a traitor,Henry declared in his stentorian voice, ‘I swear it!’ The famous criminologistBertillon testified that the handwriting of the bordereau bore a strongresemblance to that of Dreyfus. The members of the court were also shown aletter – intercepted by the French Secret Service – from the Italian to theGerman attaché, referring contemptuously to ce canaille de D– (that scum D) whohad passed on certain secret plans to him. Still, the evidence was thin andDreyfus had no doubt he would be acquitted. He was stunned when, on the thirdday of the trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to deportation. On 5 January1895, Dreyfus was publicly stripped of his rank and his sword was broken. Thenhe was shipped off to Devil’s Island, off French Guiana, a former leper colony,where he was incarcerated in a tiny hut; at night, his ankles were chained tohis bed. There he was to remain in solitary confinement for more than fouryears.Dreyfus’s problem was that he was a victim of France’s political conflicts. Theeconomic problems were spawning revolutionaries. In 1891, troops had fired on acrowd of demonstrating workers, killing women and children – it became known asthe massacre of Fourmies. Anarchist bombs exploded in public places – inDecember 1893, an anarchist named Auguste Vaillant detonated a bomb in theChamber of Deputies. Only three months before Dreyfus’s arrest, President Carnotwas stabbed to death in Lyons. The Trade Union Congress at Nantes adopted theprinciple of the general strike. The middle classes expected bloody revolutionany day. The Church, the monarchists and the army stood shoulder to shoulder tohold back the tide of destruction. As a Jew, Dreyfus was hated by the right; hisnatural allies and supporters were the left. It was the right-wing press thatclamoured for his conviction and celebrated his downfall with howls of triumph.Dreyfus became a kind of political football; whether he was really guilty wasalmost an irrelevance. It was liberalism that was on trial, not Dreyfus.For the prisoner on Devil’s Island – who was now prematurely aged – help was tocome from an unexpected quarter. In 1895, Sandherr – head of the StatisticalSection which had been responsible for Dreyfus’s arrest – became paralysed andhis place was taken by Major Marie-Georges Picquart. Picquart was asked tocontinue to find conclusive evidence of Dreyfus’s guilt and accordingly had allletters to and from Devil’s Island intercepted. Another source of informationwas a cleaning woman called Bastian who worked for the German attachéSchwartzkoppen and regularly sifted the contents of his waste-paper basket – shewas probably the source of the original bordereau. On 15 March 1896, MadameBastian handed over the latest consignment of discarded scraps of paper, amongwhich was a postcard known as a petit bleu. It had been torn into fragments butwas painstakingly reconstructed by one of Picquart’s subordinates. It wasaddressed to a certain Major Marie-Charles-Ferdinand Walsin-Esterhazy and themessage was cryptic and incomprehensible. But it was obvious that it meantsomething sinister – which in turn meant that Esterhazy was probably a spy forthe Germans.Esterhazy was a ne’er-do-well who spent as little time as possible with hisregiment; he preferred women and gambling. As a result, he was always heavily indebt. Picquart instituted cautious enquiries; he soon discovered that a numberof Esterhazy’s brother officers were fully aware that the major had a curiousthirst for classified information about gunnery. Then Picquart received twoletters from Esterhazy himself requesting a transfer to the War Office. Herecognized the handwriting immediately; it was that of the infamous bordereau.Picquart was a man of courage and honesty; he went to his superior, GeneralBoisdeffre, and told him that he was convinced Dreyfus was innocent and that thereal culprit was Esterhazy. Boisdeffre pulled a face and told Picquart to go andsee General Gonse, who had been intimately involved in the Dreyfusinvestigation. Gonse said, ‘So it looks as though a mistake has been made?’Then, after further reflection, he added, ‘Keep the two cases separate.’ Inother words, forget Dreyfus, and concentrate on investigating Esterhazy. ToPicquart, this was preposterous; if Esterhazy was the real spy, then the twocases could not be separated. ‘But Dreyfus is innocent!’ Gonse shook his head.‘If you keep silent, no one need know.’ Picquart was outraged. ‘What you say isabominable! I shall not carry this secret to my grave.’Even darker depths were being revealed. It turned out that Major Henry, who hadfirst announced the existence of the bordereau, had been a friend of Esterhazy’sfor years – although he claimed he had not seen him for a long time. It began tolook as if Henry might have recognized his friend’s handwriting on the bordereaufrom the beginning. He might well have decided to destroy it had not anothersubordinate seen it first.Picquart’s inconvenient streak of honesty pained his superiors. In November1896, Picquart was summoned before three generals, rebuked for ‘lack ofdiscretion’, and told that he was being removed from his job and posted to thefrontier of Tunisia, where the Arabs were giving trouble.If Picquart had died in Tunisia, as Boisdeffre obviously hoped he would, theDreyfus affair would have been over. But Picquart was not killed and hecontinued to brood about Dreyfus. He even wrote a long letter to the Presidentof the Republic, stating his belief in Dreyfus’s innocence and stating hisreasons but he did not mail it. Instead, he handed it over to a lawyer friend,agreeing that its details could be secretly ‘leaked’ to certain sympatheticmembers of Parliament. The lawyer, Louis Leblois, began cautiously to circulatethe truth about Dreyfus and Esterhazy.Dreyfus’s brother Mathieu had never ceased his efforts to have the casereopened. Now he began to find powerful allies, among them Georges Clemenceau, aradical Republican and editor of L’Aurore. Clemenceau opened his columns to the‘Dreyfusards’ – as they were now called – and the conservative government beganto realize that it had a scandal of immense proportions on its hands. MathieuDreyfus provoked the next major development by publicly denouncing Esterhazy asthe author of the bordereau. Esterhazy had already been retired on half pay,after quarrelling with his former ally Henry. (Oddly enough, neither he norSchwartzkoppen had realized they were the cause of Dreyfus’s downfall as thetrial had been held in camera – Esterhazy only found out when the bordereau wasfinally leaked to a newspaper.) Now Esterhazy was forced to try to clear himselfby demanding to be court-martialled. It was granted and on 11 January 1898, ittook the judges only three minutes to acquit him. Crowds cheered him in thestreets, shouting ‘Long live Esterhazy!’ and ‘Death to the Jews.’ But anyone whobelieved that was the end of the affair was being naive. Two days later,L’Aurore exploded a bombshell – a long open letter to the President of theRepublic by the novelist Emile Zola. In a flash of inspiration, Clemenceaucalled it ‘J’accuse’. It denounced the trial as a frame-up and named variousofficers, including Paty de Clam, of having ordered the acquittal of Esterhazy.He ended by daring the government to prosecute him for libel.The government had no alternative. Zola’s trial, in February, lasted two weeks.The charge was simply that Zola had accused the army of ordering Esterhazy’sacquittal; the government was still trying hard not to reopen the Dreyfus case.After a fortnight of tumult, Zola was found guilty; he was fined the maximum3,000 francs and sentenced to a year in jail. The mob screamed, ‘Death to Zola’,and tried to lynch him. The Chamber of Deputies passed a resolution ordering the‘energetic repression’ of people who wanted to rehabilitate the traitor Dreyfus.Picquart was dismissed from the army and his friend Leblois was suspended fromthe bar for six months for his part in circulating the story of Esterhazy’sguilt.Now came the dramatic climax of the astonishing affair. The new war minister,Godefroy Cavaignac, announced in the Chamber that the army now had irrefutableproof of Dreyfus’s guilt, in the form of three letters that had passed betweenthe Italian attaché Panizzardi, and the German attaché, Schwartzkoppen. Onereferred to ce canaille de D–, while another named Dreyfus as a traitor. Thewhole Chamber cheered wildly and voted to have the speech posted on officialbillboards all over France. This, certainly, looked like the final end of theaffaire Dreyfus.Then Picquart dropped his own bombshell. In a letter to L’Aurore, he declaredthat he was in a position to establish before a court that one of the letterswas a forgery and the other two did not refer to Dreyfus at all. The warminister reacted with fury and ordered Picquart’s arrest. Esterhazy was alsoarrested for ‘conduct unbecoming to an officer’.A young officer on the general staff, Captain Louis Cuignet, was appointed tore-examine the Dreyfus file with a view to refuting Picquart’s charge. Toeveryone’s dismay, Cuignet quickly realized that the three letters revealed thatPicquart was telling the truth. The one that named Dreyfus was an obviousforgery. The likeliest culprit was Henry – now a colonel – and in the presenceof the war minister he confessed to the forgery.What had happened, it seemed, was that French Intelligence had intercepted aletter from the Italian attaché asking the German attaché to dine. A letterimplicating Dreyfus was then forged on a blank sheet of paper by a petty crooknamed Lemercier-Picard; this was carefully glued on to the invitation thatcontained the Italian attaché’s signature. On closer examination, Cuignet couldsee at once that the letter had been fabricated. (His motive was not a desirefor justice – he spent the rest of his life denouncing Dreyfus as a traitor andtrying to atone for causing his superiors so much embarrassment.)Colonel Henry was arrested and General Boisdeffre resigned. The next morning,Henry was found dead in his prison cell; he had cut his throat with a razor. Hisaccomplice Lemercier-Picard hanged himself. The war minister Cavaignac alsoresigned. The government was further embarrassed when more of Henry’s forgerieswere later published – seven letters from Dreyfus to the German kaiser and areply from the kaiser. The affair was now thoroughly out of hand. France was nowvirtually in a state of civil war with mobs of Dreyfusards and anti-Dreyfusardsclashing in the streets. The Dreyfusards were still very much a minority,regarded as dangerous left-wingers and hated by most ‘decent’ Frenchmen. Whenthe High Court of Appeals agreed to review the case, one right-wing journalistsuggested that the judges should have their eyes put out – the only way tohandle traitors. In spite of its defeats, the right still seemed so much incharge that the pretender to the throne, the Duc D’Orleans, held himself inreadiness at the Belgian border to take over the throne. (The last French kinghad abdicated as a result of the 1848 revolution.)On 16 February 1899, the president, Felix Faure, died of a stroke – probably inthe act of making love to the pretty young wife of a painter, who was hastilyspirited away. Faure had been the chief obstacle to the reopening of the Dreyfuscase, a die-hard Conservative. The new president, Emile Loubet, was a moderateand he agreed to a retrial. There was an almost successful coup d’état by rightwingers but when it failed, the judges summoned their courage and, on 3 June1899, annulled Dreyfus’s conviction and ordered a retrial before a militarycourt. Picquart was released after almost a year in prison, Zola returned fromexile in England, and Dreyfus was finally brought back from Devil’s Island.(Ironically, most of his supporters found him a disappointing little man – dull,prosaic and rather irritating.)It might seem that now was the time to right the injustice and put an end to theaffair; after all, Henry had confessed to forgery and Paty de Clam was in prisonon a charge of forging documents in the case. But France was still full ofhysteria. Anti-Dreyfusards were demanding that Dreyfus should now be sentencedto death. In August 1899, Dreyfus’s court martial took place in Rennes. Dreyfus,who was only 39 years old, had a white beard and looked like an old man. Thetrial lasted four weeks and the generals who entered the witness box rehashedall the old evidence, including the forgeries, and insisted on Dreyfus’s guilt.Incredibly, the court ended by finding Dreyfus guilty of treason and sentencinghim to ten years in prison.There was talk of pardoning Dreyfus; the Dreyfusards objected strenuously,saying that this would be an admission of guilt. Dreyfus himself had a nervousbreakdown – he had been absolutely certain that he would be vindicated. Finally,worn out by suffering, he agreed to accept the pardon, and on 19 September 1899,became a free man again.The left, naturally, had no intention of allowing matters to rest there. Theycould see that they had the enemy on the run. The army was now thoroughlydiscredited. As a result of the affair, socialism had gained enormous ground inFrance. The Church was also on the run. In France, the Catholic Church hadalways held enormous power – much as it still does in Spain or Ireland. In 1801,Napoleon had concluded a Concordat with the Pope; the French clergy were to bepaid by the government. The Dreyfus affair led to such powerful anti-clericalfeeling that it finally brought about the separation of the Church and the Statein 1904, and the takeover of Church property by private corporations. In effect,Catholicism ceased to be the official state religion of France. One writer onthe affair (Guy Chapman) has called this the ‘Dreyfusian revolution’.Meanwhile, the Dreyfusards continued their attempt to clear Dreyfus’s name. TheSocialist leader Jean Jaurés lent his support. In 1903, Dreyfus himselfrequested a new inquiry. A search of War Office records revealed new evidencesupporting his innocence and Esterhazy’s guilt. The Minister of Justice agreedto allow the Rennes verdict to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Baudouin, theProceureur-Général, studied all the documents, expecting to find at least somereasonable grounds for the Rennes verdict and was shocked to realize that therewere none whatever. Finally, on 12 July 1906, a court decided that not afragment of the original evidence against Dreyfus was valid. The verdict of theRennes court martial was finally annulled. Dreyfus was reinstated in the armywith the rank of major; Picquart was made a Brigadier-General. Dreyfus was alsodecorated with the Legion of Honour. Picquart later became war minister andeventually died in January 1914 after a fall from a horse. He seems to haveshown a certain small-minded resentment of anti-Dreyfusards among armycolleagues and obstructed certain promotions. Dreyfus himself served honourablyin World War I, commanding an ammunition column. He died at the age of 76, in1935. An amusing story is told of these final years. A companion of Dreyfus’s atbridge remarked that a certain person had been arrested for espionage, then,realizing that this sounded tactless, added hastily ‘I daresay there’s nothingin it.’ ‘Oh, I don’t know,’ said Dreyfus placidly, ‘there’s no smoke withoutfire.’Esterhazy had been forced to flee the country and moved to London. Accused byhis cousin of embezzlement, he was sentenced to three years in prison in hisabsence and so decided never to return to France. He later changed his name toFitzgerald and became a journalist, writing anti-British articles for a Frenchnewspaper. Later still, he called himself the Comte Jean-Marie de Voilemont,moved to Harpenden and lived by selling tinned foods. He died in May 1923.On Sunday 28 September 1902, Emile Zola and his wife Alexandrine returned totheir house in Paris and told the servant to light a fire in the bedroom stove.The next morning, both were found lying in their bedroom: Zola was dead and hiswife was only just breathing. The cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning,due to a blocked chimney. Yet when the fire was lit in the bedroom by twoinvestigators and guinea pigs were locked in for the night, the animals wereunharmed. It has been plausibly argued that the chimney was stopped updeliberately by anti-Dreyfusards and the blockage removed the next day.L’Affaire has been written about extensively, both in fiction and non-fiction.It figures prominently in Proust’s novel A la recherche du temps perdu – Proust(who was half-Jewish) was understandably a Dreyfusard. Zola fictionalized theaffair in his novel Truth and Roger Martin du Gard wrote about it in his novelJean Barois. Perhaps the most amusing account is to be found in Anatole France’sPenguin Island, where Dreyfus figures as Peyrot, accused of stealing 80,000trusses of hay intended for the cavalry. France’s satire on the case occupiesmany pages and tends to strike the modern reader as long-winded andheavy-handed; yet anyone who reads it after studying the affair itself willrealize that, far from being heavy-handed, it understates the realities of theDreyfus affair. The facts of the case, and the emotions to which it gave rise,are so extreme that they defy all attempts to fictionalize them."},{"pageContent":"ENRONONE OF THE BIGGEST CORPORATE FRAUDS IN HISTORYIT IS A truism that Americans seem to trust ‘big business’ more than Europeansdo. Rightly or wrongly, the Old World is inclined to take Lord Acton’s view thatpower corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely; that a rigid moral codewould be an impediment for a corporation to grow to giant size. The viewAmericans might be said to prefer is that big business has been a major factorin making the US the planet’s sole super power, and that we should be gratefulthat it has helped to defeat competitors like the Soviet Union through superioreconomic strength.That, at least, was arguably true up to the end of 2001, when the collapse ofEnron, the seventh largest company in America, suddenly raised suspicions ofknavery, deviousness and deceit on a scale that dwarfed anything known tocorporate history up to that point. As Enron’s staggering losses becameapparent, the first and most obvious question was how such a giant could havetripped and stumbled into disaster. The answer that began to emerge tookeveryone’s breath away: it was that Enron had been maintaining itself with thelargest corporate fraud in history and had collapsed when it was no longerpossible to maintain the swindle.Even when the headlines were announcing the disaster, and the bankruptcy ofthousands of Enron employees, there were still millions of people who had noidea what the company did for a living. And this was to some extent deliberate.Enron senior managers took pleasure in repeating the boast that what the companywas specializing in at any one moment would have nothing to do with what thecompany would be doing ten years in the future. They prided themselves on thesheer diversity and flexibility of their moneymaking activities. The companycatch phrase was ‘Ask Why.’ The use of a full stop instead of a question markseemed designed to baulk further enquiry.Enron was a new kind of company, its existence only made possible by theextensive deregulation of the US business world in the 1980s. The company wascreated when a holding company formed by Northern Natural Gas (NNG) bought-outand merged with Houston Natural Gas (HNG), a smaller gas provider, in 1985. Thethen Chief Executive Officer of HNG, Kenneth Lay, was made CEO of the newlyformed ‘Enron’.The company was originally supposed to be named Enteron – a new-coined namemeant to suggest modern enterprise – but then someone pointed out that itsounded like the Greek word entera meaning ‘intestines’ or ‘bowels’, withunfortunate association with gastro-enteritis, so it was shortened to Enron.What Enron originally did, put simply, was organize the transportation ofnatural gas to customers. It did not drill for the gas or process it, but itmaintained the network of pipelines and the electricity power stations that usedthe gas. As such, Enron was just a bigger version of its two parent companies,NNG and HNG. Its formation had been possible thanks to the relaxation ofcompetition regulations (monopoly laws to the man-in-the-street) by the Reagangovernment. As a result Enron was big enough to perhaps corner the US naturalgas market, if it had a mind to, but such an idea was too conservative for CEOKen Lay.Lay was one of the foremost evangelizers for deregulation of the ‘free’ market.He and others pressed the US government – with a high degree of success – toremove the legal restrictions that prevented businesses in the United Statesbeing highly flexible and thus fully productive. Why shouldn’t Enron diversifyinto other markets – markets that perhaps had absolutely nothing to do withnatural gas? If they had the capital and skill to make a profit that way, thenwho was the loser? Let money make money seemed to be the business mantra.Against this belief some argued that if the big corporations could speculate inany field they wanted, government regulators would find it almost impossible totrack their activities and, therefore, spot any illicit actions. Also, thepossible cost of big corporations ‘playing about’ in markets and fields in whichthey had no previous experience might, it was argued, be catastrophic. When thebig corporations made mistakes, the entire nation usually had to pay the priceas the stock market dropped. But in the excitement of the 80s, these doubterswere ignored.Within a year of its formation, Enron was taking full advantage of marketderegulation by annexing a large share in an oil well venture called Spectrum 7.It was probably coincidental that the chairman and CEO of Spectrum 7 – a manwith several business disasters behind him, called George W. Bush – justhappened to be the son of the US Vice President. Spectrum 7 reported a $1.5million loss in 1986, and had to be sold.Over the following years, undeterred by this setback, Ken Lay led Enron furtherinto the exciting world of ‘diversification’. Enron’s interests came to includeoil as well as gas transportation, water management, paper manufacture, plasticand petrochemical production, steel, power station management, freight shipping,the new idea of ‘data streaming’ over the Internet and ‘weather riskmanagement’, to name just a few. At the same time as, hopefully, making a profiton these varied ventures, Enron maintained a large staff of stock marketspeculators. These employees utilized Enron’s growing expertise in variousmarkets to try to predict the movements of the markets and make profits forEnron by buying and selling stocks and shares.It was, of course, inevitable that such extensive speculating meant Enron riskedbeing accused of ‘insider trading’ – that is, utilizing knowledge of anindustry, that is unavailable to the market in general, to make profits on thebuying and selling of shares. Insider trading is a comparatively new offence,and some ‘white collar criminals’ have argued that it does little harm. So whatif a few experts make a profit while those not in-the-know don’t – where’s theproblem? Isn’t that the very spirit of the Free Market, they would ask. It isonly when it is realized how many millions can be made in just minutes throughinsider trading – millions that come from the losses of honest traders and theirclients – that the real damage is seen. The truth is that insider trading is aclever form of theft, pure-and-simple.In 1988 two Enron internal auditors, David Woytek and John Beard, discoveredbank records showing that millions of dollars had been transferred from Enroninto the personal accounts of Louis Borget and Thomas Mastroeni. This was a veryserious matter in that Mastroeni and Borget were two of Enron’s most valuedemployees. As the heads of Enron’s oil commodities trading section they hadrecorded consistent profits over the years – in fact, as we now know, theirs wasjust about the only part of the company to have done so.This profitability was in itself rather suspicious. The oil commodity market isnotoriously volatile. Big profits, of the sort that Borget and Mastroeni wereclaiming to be earning for Enron, were far from uncommon, but big losses are theusual price for anyone who does more than dabble in the market for any length oftime. It was rumoured in Enron that the pair had some sort of contact in SaudiArabia who informed them of the secret operations of OPEC. Of course, suchspeculations were mentioned in undertones, since any such action wouldconstitute gross insider trading.Beard and Woytek took their suspicions to Ken Lay, and he ordered them to fullyinvestigate the matter. However, when they later returned with a full dossier ofproof of embezzlement by Mastroeni and Borget – including evidence that the twotraders were spending a lot of the embezzled money on prostitutes – they weretold to drop the investigation and forget all about it. The oil commoditiesbranch of Enron was too profitable to disrupt.In fact, this profitability proved to be a mirage. It was revealed that the pairhad no ‘inside’ informant at OPEC and that they weren’t inside trading at all.What they were doing was cooking the books. Mastroeni and Borget had in factlost or embezzled all the money that Enron had given them to trade in oilcommodities; rather than being Enron’s biggest assets, they were a liabilitythat might sink the company.In retrospect it is tempting to wonder if the aftermath of the Mastroeni andBorget debacle wasn’t Enron’s first step towards the abyss that would engulfthem. Certainly the top Enron executives must have learned two specific lessonsfrom the situation: firstly, that a loss, no matter how big, can be representedas a gain if enough accounting trickery is employed to blind regulators andauditors – Mastroeni and Borget had demonstrated how convincingly this could bedone – and second, that having the confidence to pass off a big swindle is halfthe battle.The oil commodities scandal would probably have destroyed Enron if it had becomepublicly known – something that was bound to happen if correct accounts werepresented at the end of the financial year. However, ‘creative’ accounting andthe very complexity of Enron’s diversified financial interests meant that theloss of a few millions could be made to ‘disappear’ in the financial report. Ofcourse, such an operation was extremely risky. One over-interested investigatormight have blown the whole scam. Enron was lucky and got away with it.Enter now another key player in the Enron tragedy: Jeffrey Skilling. Ken Layprogressively promoted Skilling until, by 2000, he was second only to Lay in thecompany and was dealing with most of the hands-on, day-to-day running ofoperations. Skilling came to Enron with a double-barrelled reputation: on theone hand he was known to be a cold man with a taste for macho showing-off (Enronemployees nicknamed him ‘Darth Vader’). On the other hand he was said to be agenius at finding and exploiting new business opportunities.One of Skilling’s first ‘triumphs’ was to convince Enron’s audit committee thatthe company should be allowed to use ‘mark-to-market’ accounting to deal withits assets. Mark-to-market is a process originally created in the nineteenthcentury to aid traders on the stock market. It allows traders to value theirportfolio at the going market rate or at a reasonable assessment of the marketvalue, whether or not they are actually selling the shares in question. Thisprocess is entirely reasonable when used to value shares, whose worth isimmediately ascertainable by looking up the price they are trading for at anygiven moment. However, it becomes more questionable when used to judge lesstangible properties – like many of Enron’s assets.The problem (and temptation to fraud) of mark-to-market accounting comes in thephrase ‘reasonable assessment of market value’. Say that Enron – as it did –builds a giant electricity power station in Dabhol, India. It can mark down notjust the value of the power station itself as an asset, but the likely profitsit will make when it is up and running in the future. These too, after all, arecompany assets, and it would be unfair to leave them out of any overallvaluation.Now, say that nobody in yuppie-rich Enron thinks to wonder how impoverishedIndian farmers will be able to pay for expensive electricity from the Dabholpower station – that, in fact, the entire project is a white elephant that willnever realize a profit (and will actually come to lose the company over abillion dollars). There will be a strong temptation not to admit thisembarrassing fact to the auditors and go on marking Dabhol down in eachsubsequent year’s accounts as a net gain. After all, Enron still owns the asset(which is, in fact, abandoned by maintenance staff and already falling intoruins) and it might yet make a profit if Indian subsistence farmers all suddenlybecome as rich as American corporate executives . . . and pigs learn to fly likeswallows.Multiply this sort of incompetence and dishonesty across just a proportion ofEnron’s numerous and often near-etheric holdings and it becomes possible to seehow a company that is supposed to be one of the most rich and successful in theworld can be eaten away internally until it is just a glorious shell that hidesa vast financial void.Under Jeffrey Skilling’s guidance Enron created another dubious innovation: aninternal system nicknamed ‘rank-and-yank’. This involved everyone in the companybeing given a yearly rating by colleagues. The top-rated ten per cent were givenfabulous cash bonuses and privileges. The bottom-rated ten per cent wereautomatically sacked. It doesn’t take a genius to see that this sort of policywill turn the workplace into an arena in which workers spend much of their timejockeying for support and wondering who can be stabbed in the back to improvetheir own status. Such a workplace is unlikely to foster ethical beliefs,behaviour or a sense of reality.Nor did it – Enron continued to make wildly over-optimistic investmentsthroughout the 1990s, continued to clock-up mind-boggling losses, and continuedto use ‘creative’ accounting to make these losses look like gains. For example,they made a deal with Blockbuster video rental in which Enron proposed usingInternet technology to ‘data stream’ movies direct to people’s computers for afee. It was an idea that was literally a decade ahead of its time – Enron had notechnology to implement it. But it continued to put the Blockbuster deal down asa future profit and thus a positive asset, even after it was plain to executivesthat attempting to implement the deal had lost Enron $53 million.Yet, as long as the market believed the lies Enron’s stock would continue torise, the shareholders would continue to make profits, and everyone would behappy. For six years in succession, from 1996 to 2001, Enron was labelled‘America’s Most Innovative Company’ by Fortune magazine. And despite therank-and-yank policy, Enron was also high on Fortune’s ‘100 Best Companies toWork for in America’ list in 2000.Of course, Enron needed new capital to keep operating. They were now runningflat-out simply to survive; if they ever slowed down or pretended to have madeanything other than atmospheric profits, people might begin to look at theiractivities with a more critical eye. But so long as a front of total confidencewas maintained, the big financial institutions were delighted to lend more oftheir investors’ money whenever Enron asked for it.In retrospect, one particular Enron operation stands out as breathtakinglyoutrageous. In 1996, under pressure from the big energy companies, theRepublican governor of California, Pete Wilson, deregulated the state’selectricity ‘market’. This allowed greater competition between electricitysuppliers, which should in theory have led to lower bills for consumers.Franchised electricity suppliers were given a virtually free hand in directingand maintaining California’s power network, and Enron made sure it got a majorslice of the state’s power grid to manage.Wrangling between California legislators and aggressive lobbyists for ‘freemarket’ interests meant that the new deregulation legislation was monstrouslycomplex and full of the kind of legal holes that Enron employees were becomingexpert at ferreting out and exploiting.California’s problem was that as the most populous and affluent state in theUnion, electricity production had not kept pace with the growing need fornon-stop air conditioning in summer and heated outdoor swimming pools in winter.Yet there was still just enough energy to go around, provided it was managedproperly – which, Enron executives seem to have decided, would have been a wasteof their financial ingenuity.Instead they devised an operation codenamed ‘Ricochet’, under which electricitywas ‘exported’ out of the state in such a way that it created power shortages.If this seems hard to grasp, then imagine that the electricity is, instead, atrain system, whose trains, instead of travelling from A to B, were suddenlytold to travel via C. All the trains would run late and it would appear, to thecasual glance, that the railway doesn’t own enough trains to run the timetable.It apparently didn’t seem risky to California’s legislators that they werehanding control of much of their power supply to a corporation that, as well asmanaging electricity, also specialized in trading stocks and shares on theenergy markets. Enron traders were buying energy shares while the price was low.Then they would export electricity or, in extreme cases, order power stations toclose down for set periods of time. They would then profiteer on the soaringenergy prices, produced by news of the California power ‘shortage’, by sellingtheir energy shares just before they ended the shortage by reimporting the poweror allowing the power stations to start up again.In this way, one Enron employee was recorded as saying, they were stealingbetween $1 million and $2 million dollars from California every day . . . exceptOperation Ricochet employees didn’t call it ‘stealing’. They called it‘arbitrage’, a stock market term that describes the making of profitsover-and-above what one might expect to make on a deal.When Californians discovered that their energy crisis had been escalated byderegulated management, they were predictably furious. Unfortunately theydirected their fury at the wrong man – then incumbent Democratic governor, GrayDavis. Forgetting that it was the previous, Republican governor who had givenEnron a licence to rob the state’s citizens, they voted Gray Davis out of officeand chose the Republican, pro-deregulation candidate, Arnold Schwarzenegger, toreplace him.Undermining the infrastructure of one’s own nation purely for corporate profitis a crime no one has thought of including on the statute books. One can’t helpthinking that if someone had done something like this while in the pay of anenemy nation, they could be charged with treason. At the height of the energycrisis, California was forced to implement rolling blackouts. Whole areas wereperiodically denied electricity so that there would be enough for the rest ofthe state. Since this necessarily included cutting off the air conditioning ofthe old and frail, and the power to traffic lights at busy intersections, we canonly speculate how many deaths may have been caused by heat incapacitation andcar accidents.In spite of such imaginative malefaction, Enron continued to lose millions onits other, wilder speculations. What was needed was a new and bolder level ofcreative thinking. In 1996, Jeffrey Skilling promoted a surprisingly young man,Andy Fastow, to act as Chief Financial Officer for the whole company. Fastow wasonly 35 when advanced to the senior post by Skilling, but he had already earneda formidable reputation in business management.Fastow created a complex structure of shell companies (companies that exist onlyas legal entities on paper) that were all owned by Enron, but were often definedas ‘off-shore’, putting them outside most official US jurisdictions. He thenbegan complicated manoeuvres that involved ‘loaning’ Enron money from one ofthese sub-companies to another. This worked on regulators much like the oldfraudster’s trick of ‘find the pea under a nutshell’, except that here the ‘pea’was billions of dollars and there were many more than three shells where itmight be hidden. But the end result was the same: the ‘pea’ wasn’t actuallythere at all.One might enquire where Enron’s firm of independent accountants, Arthur AndersenLLP, were while all this was happening. The answer seems to be that they had nosuspicion of what was going on. It was their duty to thoroughly inspect and then‘sign off’ Enron’s yearly accounts. As one of the ‘Big Five’ internationalaccounting firms, Arthur Andersen’s silence over Enron’s dubious accounts actedas a vital smokescreen for Enron, convincing investors and regulators alike thatall was well with the corporation.One scheme involving a shell company called LJM (after the first-name initialsof Andy Fastow’s wife and two sons) may serve to illustrate what went wrongbetween Enron and Arthur Andersen. LJM had initially caused Andersen to baulk,since it seemed to be set up using particularly dodgy accounting methods.However, it has to be remembered that Andersen was receiving tens of millions inaccountants’ fees from Enron every year. If they rocked the boat to the extentthat they refused to sign off on Enron’s yearly accounts, they would be riskingthat nice little earner. So, in the face of disagreements over the LJM deal,they finally conceded that if the Enron board cleared it, they would too.Naturally Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling promptly delivered the board’s wholeheartedendorsement of the LJM scheme, so Andersen signed off that year’s accounts.Andersen presumably thought that in the unlikely event of the LJM deal beingillegal, then the members of the board would not endorse it – and failed toguess that Skilling and Lay had committed so many corporate frauds by then thatforcing through one more would hardly make their situation more perilous. Thusit can be argued that personal financial interest, and a certain willingness tobe browbeaten, fatally undermined Arthur Andersen’s ability to act as anindependent accountant – a failure that was soon to cost them dear.As far as the vast majority of Enron employees were concerned, Enron’srecord-breaking profits were a guarantee that all was well. Only a few couldhave known that Enron was willing to break the law to maintain the facade ofsuccess, and even fewer that the firm was billions into the red. In fact,Enron’s most loyal block of shareholders was their own twenty-thousand-oddemployees.One reason the employees were unaware of the truth was Enron’s sheer size. Insuch a deregulated and diversified company, very few of its many divisions wereaware of how the other divisions were doing: most racked up poor yearly gains orflat losses, sent the paperwork off to top management, then heard aboutincreasing yearly profits. Each of them must have assumed that they were comingat the bottom of the company’s earning league. Moreover, given the rank-and-yankcompany policy, nobody talked too loudly about personal failure, so bad newsnever travelled far.But by the turn of the millennium it must have become increasingly clear to manyof the top Enron executives that things were going wrong – it remains a moot(and possibly actionable) point as to just how many were aware of the illegalactivities, but the growing gap between the secret losses of the individualparts of the company and the billions in profits it was proclaiming must havebeen stretching credibility to breaking point.In the summer of 2000, Rebecca Mark (known unaffectionately within Enron as‘Mark the Shark’ and ‘Hell in High Heels’) resigned as head of Enron’sinternational division. Mark was arguably the third most important person inEnron, after Lay and Skilling. She certainly knew something of the huge lossesEnron had been incurring – she had been largely responsible for the Dabhol powerstation debacle and other ‘big asset’ money losers – but there is no knownevidence that she had been aware of illegal activities within the company. Markhas said that she left because she lost in her power struggle with theincreasingly autocratic Skilling.Enron’s stock price had hit an all-time high of $90-per-share in August 2000.The stock price then started to drop, but Enron executives continued toencourage people, including Enron staff, to hold onto their shares and, ifpossible, buy even more. Enron, according to Ken Lay, would soon climb to $130or $140 a share. Many took his advice at face value.The reason that Enron stock value had been falling since August 2000 was thattop Enron executives were quietly selling off their huge blocks of companyshares to realize maximum profits before the truth got out. As investigatingSenator Byron Dorgan later commented, comparing Enron to the Titanic disaster,‘In the Titanic the captain went down with the ship. And Enron looks to me likethe captain first gave himself and his friends a bonus, then lowered himself andthe top folks down [into] the lifeboat and then hollered up and said, “By theway, everything is going to be just fine.”’ This comment must have seemedparticularly bitter to Jeff Skilling, who had once made an embarrassing publicjoke about the California energy crisis: ‘What’s the difference betweenCalifornia and the Titanic? The Titanic went down with the lights still on.’Possibly the low point of Enron’s moral decline was reached in the matter of thecompany retirement funds. In an attempt to keep share prices high while theysold their stock, senior management padlocked the Enron shares of theiremployees in the company retirement funds. This meant that Enron employees couldnot sell their shares, even if they wanted to. The block was only removed whenEnron shares, and the employee retirement funds, were worth virtually nothing.In terms of the Titanic simile, this was like the ship’s officers knocking holesin all the lifeboats that they couldn’t use themselves.In February 2001 Ken Lay rewarded Skilling by promoting him to CEO of the entirecompany, with a basic pay of $132 million a year, not including his numerousbonuses and stock options. But even this apparently failed to settle Skilling’snerves about the fate that was obviously treading on their heels. While stocksin the company were trading at close to record highs, the actual losses anddebts were spiralling into billions. Something had to give, and in the end itwas Jeff Skilling.The first public sign that things were getting out of control looked innocuous.On 17 April 2001, Skilling was taking a recorded, public conference telephonecall with investors and market analysts. One of the analysts pointed out that,in one of its many guises, Enron was acting as a de facto financial servicescompany. FSCs are expected to present an earnings statement and balance sheetsto investors. Why was Enron not doing this? Skilling was apparently taken abackby the question. He stammered, ‘You, you, you . . . Well, uh . . . thank youvery much. We appreciate it.’ There followed a short pause, then Skilling wasclearly heard to say, ‘Asshole.’In anyone else this might have been seen simply as a human slip, but the CEO ofthe seventh largest company in America was simply not supposed to insult peoplein public – and on tape. However, most people and Enron’s employees saw thewhole thing as a joke – Enron market traders even made a new version of theEnron logo to hang in their office with the reworked company catchphrase: ‘AskWhy. Asshole.’But for the big market analysts the expletive was less important than Skilling’sham-fisted evasion of a direct accounting question. Just why, they began towonder, didn’t Enron present its balance sheet openly? Yet even then, no oneseemed to suspect the true answer.In the early part of 2001, the news for Enron all seemed good. The SupremeCourt’s appointment of George W. Bush to the presidency of the United Stateswould mean a business-friendly, pro-deregulation Republican government for atleast the next four years. Better still, Ken Lay had cleverly backed the righthorse in the presidential race, making Enron the biggest corporate sponsor ofthe Bush election campaign – after all, he and the Bush family were old friendsand business colleagues. It was soon widely rumoured that Lay – nicknamed‘Kenny-Boy’ by President Bush – would be rewarded by being made the Secretary ofEnergy in the Bush cabinet. The appointment, however, was never announced.Events were overtaking Enron.Jeff Skilling unexpectedly left Enron on 14 August 2001, claiming familypressures as his reason for resigning. His exit shook the market since suchresignations are usually announced months ahead of time so that the company’sshare value won’t dip as a result. What was going on? There had been noindication of management difficulties at the top of Enron, and no suggestionthat Skilling might be being headhunted by another big corporation. AndSkilling’s explanation of ‘family problems’ cut little ice: such a statement isnow largely seen – in political and corporate circles – as a standard euphemismfor ‘I’m trying to escape a scandal’.On Skilling’s hurried exit, the apparently unperturbed Ken Lay announced that hehimself would go back to being Enron’s CEO, but that didn’t stop Enron sharesfalling to $42 the day after Skilling cut and ran. Ken Lay continued to be asupbeat as he had through his previous fifteen years as Enron’s CEO, encouragingeveryone to buy Enron shares that he insisted were about to bounce back. Thismight seem fairly innocuous – it’s the job of a CEO to loyally support his firm– but it is also a CEO’s duty to warn of impending major problems in a company.Loyal employees held onto their shares, but other stockholders smelled a rat andEnron share values were down to $15 by October 2001.Unfortunately, many people believed Ken Lay when he started to tell investorsthat this was not evidence of the company going to the wall, but a goldenopportunity to make a fortune. Enron, he promised, was about to swing back tothe top and those that bought at a petty $15 a share would see their moneymultiply astronomically. And why not? Just over a year before, Enron had beenpulling in $90 a share, and there was no indication from Ken Lay, the governmentregulators or Arthur Andersen that anything was fundamentally wrong with thecompany.Enron declared bankruptcy on 2 December 2001, laying off over 21,000 employeesworldwide, most with only a few hours’ warning. As they emptied their desks,many of those employees must have realized that they had not only lost theirmonthly pay cheque, but also their retirement pensions and, in many cases, muchor all of their savings as Enron shares became worthless.To the horror of the US federal authorities and Arthur Andersen, it soon becameclear just what an empty shell Enron had been for years – a mass of hiddendebts, insider trading, bad investments and fraudulent accounting, all takingplace right under their regulatory noses. When finally totalled, it wasdiscovered that Enron owed $31.8 billion in debts.Top Enron executives were indicted, including Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling. Theyput up a spirited defence, paying for large legal teams with money previously‘earned’ from Enron. Before the corporation went bankrupt Skilling alone isbelieved to have made $200 million by selling his Enron stock. Lay is believedto have made $300 million in the same way.Their main line of defence was to blame everything on Andy Fastow, the crookedChief Financial Officer of Enron. The top Enron managers claimed that they hadall been in ignorance of his malefactions, but this cut very little ice witheither the public or the courts. Fastow had clearly been appointed to do justwhat he did: keep Enron going with whatever crooked deals were necessary. As itwas Lay and Skilling who had hired Fastow, they could not now distancethemselves from him.In November 2002, Andy Fastow was convicted of 78 counts including fraud, moneylaundering and conspiracy. He received ten years in prison and a fine of $23.8million (less than half of what he is estimated to have earned from Enron beforeit collapsed).Earlier that year Arthur Andersen had been convicted of obstruction of justice:it was discovered that the firm had shredded tons of documents relating to Enronbefore the federal regulators could inspect them. The firm had its licences topractise withdrawn, effectively destroying the company. The US Supreme Courtlater revoked this judgement, saying that the instructions given to the jury hadbeen faulty, but the damage had been done by the Enron scandal itself and ArthurAndersen lost all their clients. Over 29,000 Andersen employees were laid off.Jeffrey Skilling’s trial dragged on from July 2004 to May 2006, when he wasconvicted of nineteen counts of securities fraud and wire fraud. He wasacquitted on the charges of insider trading for lack of conclusive evidence.Skilling was sentenced to 24 years, 4 months in jail.Ken Lay was convicted of six counts of securities and wire fraud, for which hefaced a total sentence of up to 45 years in prison. However, on 5 July 2006, Laydied of a heart attack while he was awaiting the judge’s sentence – andvacationing at the exclusive ski resort of Aspen, Colorado. Inevitable rumourssprang up that (depending on the political views of the rumour-monger) Ken Layhad either been murdered to silence his potentially explosive revelations, orthat he had been killed by the cruel pressures brought to bear on him during hisprotracted trial. In fact, the autopsy showed that Kenneth Lay’s arteries wereclogged with fat from his years of high living as the boss of Enron."},{"pageContent":"GESUALDO, CARLOCOMPOSER OF GENIUS AND MURDERERTHE PRINCE OF Venosa, who died virtually insane, was known to his contemporariesas the man who murdered his wife when he caught her in bed with her lover. Forposterity, he is one of the greatest of all composers of madrigals.Gesualdo’s grandfather was made a prince in 1560 when his son married a niece ofthe pope. His grandson Carlo was born a year later. Gesualdo’s father, Fabrizio,kept his own band of musicians. His son became a close friend of the paranoidpoet Tasso, who wrote several poems about the tragic events which ended inmurder.In 1586, Fabrizio arranged a betrothal for his son, Carlo, with his cousin, abeautiful young girl named Maria d’Avalos. At the age of 25, she had alreadybeen widowed twice. The wedding in Naples was followed by magnificentcelebrations that lasted for days. In due course a son, Don Emmanuelle, wasborn. For four years, they lived ‘more like lovers than man and wife’ says achronique scandaleuse of the period. But it seems that the lady became boredwith her intellectual husband, whose greatest enthusiasm was for music. One ofthe visitors to their palazzo in Naples was a handsome young cavalier named DonFabrizio Carafa, the Duke of Andria, described as ‘perhaps the most handsome andgraceful cavaliere in the city [of Naples], vigorous and flourishing and not yetthirty years of age.’ The Duke was already married to a lady of religiousinclinations, on whom he had fathered five children.Donna Maria – who is depicted in a painting as a typically plump Italian beauty– seems to have been a woman of irresistible charm, so much so that Gesualdo’suncle, Don Giulio, fell in love with her and, ‘not heeding the fact that she wasthe wife of his nephew’, left no stone unturned to persuade her into his bed.She turned him down with sharp words, threatening to tell her husband if he didnot stop pestering her.Don Giulio was thrown into a passion of jealousy when he observed that hisniece-in-law was obviously fascinated by the handsome Duke of Andria, Fabrizio.‘The first messages of their desires were their glances which, with the tongueof the heart, betrayed the fire that burnt in each other’s breast. From glancesof love they proceeded to written messages . . .’ When husband and wife were ona visit to the house of a friend, Don Garzia of Toledo, in the town of Chiaia,the Duke hid in a pavilion in the garden, and bribed the wife of the gardener tohelp him. Donna Maria walked in the garden with her maid and some gentlemen,which must have struck her husband as safe enough, then she pretended she had apain and persuaded the others to go on. The gardener’s wife led her to thepavilion, where the Duke took her in his arms ‘and kissed her a thousand times,as she did him, and with the greatest ardour they were moved to enjoy togetherthe ultimate amorous delight.’ After this, they used the house of Don Garzia forsecret rendezvous and sometimes even in Donna Maria’s own bedroom, with the maidacting as sentinel.When Gesualdo’s lecherous uncle heard the news he rushed to tell the Prince, whowas ‘more dead than alive’ after receiving this unpleasant piece of information.Being an artist and an intellectual, he was not the type to challenge the Duketo a duel (besides which, the Duke had a reputation as a formidable swordsman).But the Duke soon divined – probably from his scowls – that the secret was outand told Donna Maria that it would be safer to end the affair, or at leastsuspend it until Gesualdo had ceased to be suspicious. Donna Maria’s responsewas to pour scorn on him and tell him that if he loved her as much as she lovedhim, he would not be afraid of anyone. The Duke’s pride was stung and he toldher that if she felt like that, then he was willing to die with her.According to one chronicler, Gesualdo announced that he intended to go huntingand would not be back until the following day. This does not accord with thetestimony of Gesualdo’s valet, who states that Gesualdo had supper in his roomat his usual time, ‘three hours of the night’ (probably about nine o’clock).Donna Maria had supper at ‘four hours of the night’ – evidence that they ledseparate lives. Then she went to bed and was undressed by her two maidservants,Silvia Albana and Laura Scala. The maids seem to have slept in an ante-roombetween the bedroom and the corridor – and from which a flight of stairs leddown to the mezzanine where Don Carlo had his bedroom. An hour later, DonnaMaria called Silvia and asked her to bring some clothes; she had heard the Dukewhistling in the street below and wanted to go out on to the balcony. Silviabrought her a skirt and shawl and Maria opened the window. Presumably her loverthen climbed up onto the balcony and joined her. Not long after, Donna Mariacalled Silvia again and asked to be undressed and also asked for anothernightdress, claiming that hers was damp with perspiration. It is not clear wherethe Duke was hiding during these proceedings. Silvia brought her a nightdresswith ruffs of black silk and fringes at the bottom, then went back to her ownroom where she sat dressed on the bed and read a book until she dozed off tosleep.She was awakened by the sound of her door opening. Opposite the door was thespiral staircase leading down to Gesualdo’s room. Three men came into the room,one carrying a halberd. They went straight into the bedroom of Donna Maria.Silvia heard two shots. A moment later, Gesualdo came into the room, followed byhis valet, who was carrying two torches. Gesualdo snarled at Silvia, ‘Traitress,I shall kill you,’ and ordered his manservant not to let her escape. Gesualdostrode into his wife’s bedroom, whereupon Silvia escaped into the bedroom ofDonna Maria’s small son and hid under the bed. Meanwhile, Gesualdo was heard toshout, ‘Kill that scoundrel, along with this harlot. Shall a Gesualdo be made acuckold?’ There were sounds of a struggle. Then the three men came out, followedby Gesualdo, whose hands were covered with blood. Gesualdo said, ‘I don’tbelieve they are dead,’ and went back into the bedroom. His valet looked intothe room and saw a man, wearing a bloodstained woman’s nightdress, lying nearthe door. Gesualdo went back to the bed, where his wife was lying, and stabbedher several times more – according to one chronicle ‘especially in those partswhich most ought to be kept honest’. Gesualdo then ordered the two bodies to bedragged out onto the spiral staircase, and the same chronicler alleges that‘while the said cadavers were lying on the said staircase, a monk of SanDomenico used the said Donna Maria even though she was dead.’ But thischronicler is suspect; he is the one who tells the story of Gesualdo pretendingto go hunting, which seems to be embroidery; he also states that when the Dukeentered Donna Maria’s bedroom, they ‘gave each other solace several times’, whenit is obvious that there were no witnesses, so he could not possibly have known.Gesualdo knew that his life was now in danger from Donna Maria’s kinsmen andfled from Naples to his castle, destroying the surrounding woodland so thatenemies could not take him by surprise. The Duke’s wife, Donna Maria Carafa,retreated to a convent; there was a widespread rumour that she had suddenlyexperienced the conviction that her husband was about to die as she knelt inprayer a few hours before his death.In the retirement of his castle, Gesualdo began to suffer from melancholia. Healso began to write madrigals; his first two books were published in 1594 andmade him a reputation as a fine composer. Until then he had been regarded as anaristocratic amateur. In 1594 he also married again, this time Leonora d’Este, amember of a rich and artistic family. But his second marriage was no happierthan the first. Leonora was bored with her composer husband and with the castleat Gesualdo; she preferred to spend much of her time at Modena with her brother.Between Gesualdo’s marriage and his death in 1613, there was a steadydeterioration in his mental state. A son by Leonora died in 1600, and his eldestson by Donna Maria died only a few weeks before Gesualdo himself.The first two books of madrigals are relatively conventional in style.Thereafter, Gesualdo’s work became increasingly difficult and complex, full ofdissonances and chromaticism. Most of his contemporaries regarded thesepeculiarities as a sign of his madness. It was only in the twentieth centurythat his genius began to be appreciated."},{"pageContent":"HOLLYWOODSCANDAL IN THE ‘DREAM FACTORY’THE HISTORY OF Hollywood begins in 1886, when Mrs Deida Wilcox, the wife of aKansas City estate agent, gave that name to a huge ranch not far from the smallcity of Los Angeles (population around 12,000), where they had decided toretire. But if by Hollywood we mean the motion-picture industry, then it isarguable that the history of Hollywood – and of Hollywood scandal – began twelveyears earlier, on 17 October 1874, when the photographer Eadweard Muybridgemurdered his wife’s lover. On the afternoon of that day, Muybridge was at workon his photographic plates in San Francisco when he was interrupted by a lawyerwho wished to discuss a debt of $100 that Muybridge owed to a midwife namedSusan Smith. By way of inducing Muybridge to settle the debt, the lawyer hintedthat Mrs Smith knew of a scandal concerning Mrs Muybridge and that she mightspread the word unless she received her money. Muybridge rushed off to interviewMrs Smith. He had reason to be jealous, for his wife Flora was a pretty girl of23 while Muybridge was an introverted and bad-tempered man of 47. What Mrs Smithtold him threw him into a frenzy. A certain Major Harry Larkin had brought FloraMuybridge to her house for the delivery of a baby and from the tender love scenethat took place between them, it was to be inferred that Larkin was the baby’sfather. Mrs Muybridge was in Dalles, Oregon, far from her husband’s rage, butthe handsome and debonair Major Larkin, a San Francisco reporter, was closer athand at the health resort Calistoga. Muybridge took a boat there, went to thehouse where Larkin was living and called out for him. Larkin came to the door.‘Here is a message from my wife,’ said Muybridge, and shot him in the heart.In California in those days, shootings were commonplace and a man who hadmurdered from an outraged sense of honour aroused public sympathy. The defencepleaded temporary insanity, pointing out that Muybridge had received serioushead injuries in 1860 in a runaway stage-coach accident. The Napa Court foundhim not guilty.Mrs Muybridge had vanished after the trial, and Muybridge himself disappearedinto obscurity. The drama had interrupted Muybridge’s work on an interestingscientific enterprise – an attempt to photograph a horse in motion. In 1872,Governor Leland Stanford had bet a friend that when a horse is galloping at fullspeed, all its feet leave the ground for a brief moment. Stanford was a rich man– he owned a racing stable – and he was willing to spend money to back hisassertion. Muybridge had been trying, without much success, to photograph ahorse in motion; his plates showed little more than a blur. But when he emergedfrom his five years obscurity in 1880, photographic emulsion had improved somuch that a mere fraction of a second was enough for a successful exposure.Stanford spent $40,000 equipping Muybridge with a whole row of cameras. Then amachine with a metal cylinder and projecting pins (like a music box) closed aseries of electrical contacts, setting off the cameras one after the other, asthe horse galloped past. Governor Stanford won his bet and Muybridge achieved acertain celebrity.A friend of Muybridge, Wallace Levison, took the next major step when he evolveda method for moving photographic plates on a wheel behind a lens. And by 1888,Thomas Alva Edison had discovered how to take a series of pictures on a movingstrip of film. From there, it was a short and very obvious step to projectingthem on to a screen like slides. In 1889, his workmen had solved the problem ofsynchronizing a moving picture with sound. The first ‘film’ showed his engineerWilliam Dickson stepping on to the screen, raising his hat, and saying ‘Goodmorning, Mr Edison. I hope you are satisfied with the kinetophonograph.’The Kinetoscope was basically a peep-show machine for use in fairgrounds. Itshowed such subjects as a man sneezing or girls dancing. But when the firstdramatic motion picture, The Passion Play, was presented at the Eden Musee on 30January 1898, its producer Rich Hollaman knew he had taken an important step. Hecommented, ‘I knew I had them when I saw the tears in the eyes of those Broadwaysports.’ This was, in fact, the most incredible thing about the film as amedium: its emotional impact. Today we take it for granted because we arefamiliar with television and cinema since childhood. It is difficult for us tograsp the overwhelming effect of the first films: the way they transported theaudience into ‘another world’. Edison was the first to make full use of thispotential in a film of 1902 called The Life of an American Fireman. It showed ahouse on fire and a man being rescued from an upstairs window followed by awoman and child, coughing and staggering as they were overcome by smoke. Thefiremen dashed through the streets on their horse-drawn wagons. As the motherand child collapsed, unconscious, a fireman burst in through the door. Hecarried the unconscious mother to a ladder; she awoke and begged him to save herbaby. He took her down, then went back for the child. Mother and child wereunited as the house blazed. At the first showing there was not a dry eye in theplace; the film had lasted only a few minutes but people felt as if they hadbeen through a crisis together – they smiled through their tears at theirnext-door neighbour.It was this emotional impact that turned the film star into something far morerenowned and illustrious than the great actors of the past. David Garrick,Edmund Kean, Henry Irving, all had ‘set the town on fire’ in their time. Buttheir admirers were separated from them by the footlights. In the cinema, youwere there, in the blazing bedroom, clinging to the upturned boat about to beswept over the waterfall, or clambering over the rooftops of the runaway trainin an effort to reach the engine. It was ten times as real as the theatre.Furthermore, every woman in the audience was in the arms of the romantic hero ashe swept her onto his horse and galloped away from the murderous ruffians hiredby the villain; every male in the audience gazed into her adoring eyes. Ofcourse, there had been plenty of romantic heroes in literature, from Byron’sChilde Harold to Owen Wister’s Virginian but they were for the literate. Thescreen brought romance, excitement and laughter to people who never read anewspaper. The result was that film stars achieved a degree of celebrity thathad been unknown in the nineteenth century, even to popular idols like Dickensand Jenny Lind. Charlie Chaplin came to Hollywood in 1912 to make pictures forMack Sennett at Keystone. He knew his films were popular because they mademoney. But when he took a trip to New York in 1915, he was staggered to be metby enormous crowds at every station; the telegraph operators, who had relayed atelegram announcing his arrival, had passed on the news to the press. When hecame to England in 1920 there was even greater excitement; telegrams began toarrive by the dozen when he was halfway across the Atlantic. Every time hestepped off a train he was met by the local mayor and a brass band.It was because the film star was regarded as a kind of god that the slightestbreath of scandal could be magnified into a tempest of opprobrium. The firstgreat Hollywood scandal broke in 1920, when news arrived that the lovely andpopular Olive Thomas had committed suicide with poison capsules in Paris. Hershad been the classic success story. As a teenager she had escaped from aPennsylvania slum and an unhappy marriage to become a shopgirl in New York. Thenshe entered a competition for the ‘perfect artist’s model’ and won it. Afterthat she became a Ziegfeld girl, then a Hollywood film star. She was married toanother screen idol, Jack Pickford – Mary Pickford’s brother, a clean-cut youngman who was regarded as the all-American boy. But investigations into OliveThomas’s death revealed that she was not quite the charming innocent she playedon the screen. Olive had arrived in Paris ahead of her husband and herperambulations included sleazy night clubs where she drank with members of theFrench underworld. Newspapers began to publish reports that she had been inthese places trying to buy heroin for her husband who was an addict. Laterstill, an American government investigation revealed that she herself had beenpurchasing heroin and cocaine before her marriage to Pickford. The headlinesdeclared: Olive Thomas, Dope Fiend. The American public had been prepared tobelieve that its idols were not angels – after all, Mary Pickford and DouglasFairbanks had just divorced their respective mates in order to marry – but thiswas beyond belief. Olive Thomas’s husband survived the scandal but made only afew more films.The next scandal was greater still. In 1921, the comedian Fatty Arbuckle wascharged with criminal responsibility in the death of Virginia Rappe (see page27), who died of a ruptured bladder after being raped by him. Again, it seemedincredible, as if Santa Claus had turned out to be Jack the Ripper. Theinference seemed to be that the inhabitants of the ‘dream factory’ were dopefiends or sex fiends.Chaplin himself was lucky to escape the same fate as Arbuckle. When he came toHollywood in 1912 (at the age of 23), his love life had been minimal and hesuffered from shyness and loneliness. His natural penchant was for very youngwomen – in fact, for underage girls. When he met Mildred Harris at a beach partyin 1917 she was fifteen and looked younger. In the following year herannouncement that she was pregnant led to her marriage to Chaplin but wasfollowed two years later by divorce. (Chaplin confided to Fairbanks that hiswife was ‘no mental heavyweight’.) He charged infidelity and she charged cruelty– a concept his admirers found hard to associate with the sentimental littletramp. It seemed to confirm the notion that Hollywood was the opposite of whatit seemed and that the great film moguls – Adolph Zukor, Samuel Goldwyn, JesseLasky, Louis B. Mayer – were trying to deceive the public.Chaplin’s next major involvement was with a girl named Lillita McMurray – shepreferred to spell it Lolita – whom he had met for the first time in April 1914– her sixth birthday. When she was twelve, she appeared as a child angel in TheKid. Her mother was distinctly suspicious of Chaplin’s intentions and kept abeady eye on him. Two years later, Lita was invited to play in The Gold Rush,which was filmed in Trukee, California. In her autobiography, My Life WithChaplin, Lita admits: ‘I wanted to be his little girl – and yet I wanted him toput his tongue in my mouth. I knew I was playing with fire . . .’ Chaplin’sresponse to this teasing attitude was to leap on her in his red silk pyjamas.Lita was duly horrified at his ‘animal movements’ and fled. The next time, hetried the softly, softly approach. ‘He was softer; even before he touched me Isensed I wouldn’t have to struggle . . . With deft, still unhurried movements hepeeled the bathing suit off me and sat back on his knees to look at me nude.Instinctively I began to cover with my hands the parts of me that no man hadseen until this moment, but looking at him again, I saw the absence of lewdnessin his eyes, and abruptly there was no shame. My hands fell to my sides.’ At thelast minute she changed her mind. ‘“No,” I whimpered, shaking my head wildly,taking my arms from around him, trying to close my legs. “Oh, I can’t, Ican’t!”’ The next time he tried was in the back of a limousine. ‘Wordlessly hefound his way to the top of the elastic-banded underpants, and wordlessly heyanked them down; I murmured for him to stop, though without much force, for hewas kissing me again. Then he was struggling with his own clothing and pullingme over on top of him.’ Their position made it impossible, and again Chaplingave up. Finally, he took her to his home in Beverly Hills and the long-awaiteddeflowering took place in the bathroom. ‘The foglike mist billowed, grew thickerand thicker, finally filled every inch of the room. I couldn’t seeanything. . . . What happened next was Charlie, lying beside me and teasing myneck with swift darting kisses. . . . Then there was a sharp, piercing paininside me and I cried out, but I did not release my grip. The pain blinded mefar more than the encircling steam, but I writhed wildly, as though in ecstasy,to let him know I belonged to him – and then I received all of him.’Chaplin disliked contraceptives and the result was that his child-mistressbecame pregnant. He had to marry in haste or face a charge of statutory rape.Chaplin and his fifteen-year-old bride tried to marry quietly in Mexico but werepursued by hordes of reporters. Chaplin is quoted as saying to his friends ofthe wedding party, ‘Well, boys, this is better than the penitentiary, but itwon’t last.’ Mrs McMurray moved in with the newly weds. Chaplin began to spendmost of his time with old cronies while Lita and her clan took over thehousehold. After two years, Chaplin fled to New York and Lita filed for divorce.While Chaplin was fighting off a nervous breakdown, the McMurray clan swooped onhis home and studio. A pamphlet entitled Complaint by Lita Grey passed from handto hand; it contained details of her allegations against Chaplin, including theaccusation that he had tried to persuade her to perform the ‘abnormal, againstnature, perverted degenerate and indecent act’ called fellatio and that when shedeclined he had said, ‘Relax, dear – all married people do it.’ It went on tostate that after their original lovemaking scene, they never had normal sextogether. The newspapers made the most of the revelations and H.L. Menckencommented in the Baltimore Sun: ‘The very morons who worshipped Charlie Chaplinsix weeks ago now prepare to dance around the stake while he is burned.’ WhenLita’s lawyers threatened to reveal in court the name of five prominentactresses with whom he had slept since his marriage, Chaplin capitulated andLita was paid $625,000. Chaplin could afford it; his total estate was reckonedto be worth $16 million. He was so embittered about the episode that he does noteven mention Lita Grey in his autobiography. But the divorce case did nopermanent damage to his popularity and when his next film The Circus wasreleased in 1928 it was as popular as ever.The experience with Lita Grey made Chaplin secretive and when he married thetwenty-year-old Paulette Goddard (at sea) in 1933, he kept it a secret for threeyears; Chaplin was 44 at the time of the marriage. Before this marriage ended indivorce in 1942, Chaplin was the defendant in a paternity suit brought againsthim by a young actress named Joan Barry and he was also charged under the MannAct – transporting a minor across state lines for immoral purposes. He was foundnot guilty of this charge but ruled to be the father of the child. A year later,in 1943, Chaplin married the eighteen-year-old daughter of playwright EugeneO’Neill, Oona; he was then 54. They lived together happily until his death in1977. The final scandal in which he was involved was not sexual but political.During the McCarthy era he was accused of being a communist and his filmMonsieur Verdoux was widely boycotted in America. In 1952, he was inmid-Atlantic when he was told that the Attorney-General had decided to deny himre-entry into the United States unless he submitted to an enquiry into his‘moral worth’. He preferred to move to Vevey in Switzerland. He was knighted in1975. A few months after his death two years later his body was ‘kidnapped’ fromthe graveyard in Vevey and demands for ransom were received – probably the onlyoccasion on which the victim of a kidnapping has already been dead; his body waslater recovered.Chaplin’s career epitomizes the basic problem of Hollywood. The famous alwaysattract members of the opposite sex and since most famous people are naturallydominant they are also, in most cases, highly sexed. Where sex is offeredcasually, it will inevitably be accepted casually. Chaplin tells of a typicalepisode in his autobiography. In a hotel room in Los Angeles, he was undressingand humming a popular tune when a feminine voice from the next room took it up.He whistled it and again the girl hummed it. When he laughed the girl said, ‘Ibeg your pardon.’ Chaplin persuaded her to open her door and saw ‘the mostravishing young blonde’ dressed in a negligee. He introduced himself but it wasunnecessary for the girl already knew who he was. They slept together thatnight, taking care not to acknowledge one another in public the next day. Thenext night, she tapped on his door and again they slept together. On the thirdnight he was beginning to feel tired and his work was suffering. On the fourthnight, he tiptoed into bed and ignored her when she tapped on the door. The nextday, she passed him icily in the hotel lobby. But that night, the handle of hisdoor turned – the door was locked – and she knocked impatiently. He decided itwas time to check out of the hotel.If this episode had been told in court or in the newspapers, it would haveruined his popularity as surely as the Virginia Rappe case ruined Arbuckle’s.Everyone who watched the little tramp flirting awkwardly with some pretty maidenwould have found themselves thinking about Chaplin’s ‘sex orgies’ with abeautiful stranger in a negligee and the illusion would have been destroyed. YetHollywood was no more a Sodom and Gomorrah than Broadway or Shaftesbury Avenuein London were. And Chaplin’s methods of seduction were endearingly innocentcompared to the ‘casting couch’ method inaugurated by Lewis J. Seltznick about1914, in which the corridor to his office was guarded by men whose job was toensure his privacy, and any young actress who wanted a part was expected toremove her clothes and lie down. (The method was later imitated by Harry Cohn ofColumbia – the film star Louise Brooks described how her refusal to lie on thecouch led to the end of her career in films.)The next major Hollywood scandal occurred before Fatty Arbuckle had beenacquitted of killing Virginia Rappe. William Desmond Taylor, an Irish actor andfilm director, was head of one of the most successful of the early Hollywoodfilm companies, Famous Players-Lasky. (The trio of Jesse Lasky, Cecil B. DeMille and Samuel Goldfish – who later changed his name to Goldwyn – hadvirtually founded Hollywood as a film colony in 1914, when De Mille rented anold barn and made The Squaw Man there.) In 1922, Taylor was 45 years old; he hadthe kind of thin, keen face that would have made him ideal for the part ofSherlock Holmes. He looked and spoke like a typical English aristocrat. On 2February 1922, his valet entered the living room at 7:30 in the morning to findhis master lying dead on the floor, with two bullet holes in his back.Investigations revealed that the film star Mabel Normand, Chaplin’s firstleading lady in Keystone, had been with him for an hour the previous evening.Another Chaplin leading lady – and girlfriend – Edna Purviance, had rung hisdoorbell about an hour later but received no reply. It looked as if a killer hadbeen waiting for Mabel Normand to leave. When the police began investigatingTaylor’s love life, they found that he seemed to have had affairs with half thebeauties in Hollywood. Mabel Normand had written him passionate love letters; ashad twenty-year-old Mary Miles Minter – and, in fact, her mother. Silkenundergarments belonging to many different women were found in his bedroom –apparently left as mementoes by his mistresses. Mary Miles Minter played thesame kind of ‘little girl’ parts as Mary Pickford and Olive Thomas, and wasanother symbol of girlhood innocence. When handkerchiefs with the monogram MMMwere found in Taylor’s bedroom and newspaper reporters revealed that she was nottwenty but thirty, her career came to a sudden end. Taylor’s murderer was neverfound but it seems likely that it was a woman. Many clues were destroyed whenZukor and other Famous Players executives descended on Taylor’s home andincinerated love letters and other telling evidence. The police foundpornographic photographs showing Taylor in the act of lovemaking with a numberof female stars.At the funeral, Mary Miles Minter kissed the corpse on the lips, then announcedthat the corpse had whispered, ‘I shall always love you, Mary.’A new dimension was added to the scandal by the discovery that Taylor’s previousvalet had been a homosexual (like his present one, Peavy), who had forgedcheques in his name, smashed up his car, and burgled his home twice. Was Taylora bisexual who was being blackmailed? This mystery was cleared up when it wasdiscovered that the previous valet was Taylor’s brother, an actor who had fallenon hard times.Further shock was caused when it became evident that Taylor had been a drugaddict. He also seems to have spent much of his time at parties where mendressed as women – the collection of underwear seemed to hint at transvestitetendencies.The final blow to Mabel Normand’s career came a year later, when her chauffeurshot one of her admirers, Cortland Dines, at the home of Edna Purviance. It wasclear that she was having affairs with both men. An article in Good Housekeepingsuggested that she was too ‘adulterated’ (perhaps intending a pun) for domesticconsumption and her career foundered.The newspapers of the millionaire tycoon William Randolph Hearst took everyopportunity to thunder about the immorality of Hollywood; they continued to makethe most of Fatty Arbuckle’s problems even after he had been acquitted.Hollywood moguls felt that they had to do something quickly to improve the imageof the film capital. An organization called the Motion Picture Producers andDistributors of America was formed and Will H. Hays, who was Postmaster Generalin Harding’s administration, was appointed head of the organization andcensor-in-chief at a salary of $100,000 a year. It was only later that itemerged that Hays himself was a man of dubious moral standards – he had acceptedgifts and ‘loans’ of a quarter of a million dollars in exchange for his part ingetting the unsuitable Harding into the White House. But at least hisappointment averted censorship by the federal government. After Hays becameHollywood’s conscience, a ‘morality clause’ was inserted into most contracts,stating that any action likely to result in public scandal would be a sufficientreason for rescinding the contract. But the double standard continued toprevail. Cecil B. De Mille insisted that his stars should regulate theirpersonal life so that ‘any degrading or besmirching’ behaviour should beavoided. However, he himself was known to make full use of his position to sleepwith his female stars, while his religious films always included a sinful orgyand an undressing scene in the bath-house.In the month Hays was appointed – March 1922 – Famous Players suffered anothermajor blow when their popular leading man Wallace Reid was consigned by his wifeto a private nursing home. The studio told the press he was suffering fromoverwork, but Reid’s wife Florence preferred honesty and admitted that herhusband was a morphine addict. In 1919 Reid had suffered head injuries in a railcrash and had been given morphine to ease the pain; he became an addict andaccelerated his breakdown with heavy drinking. He was in a padded cell for muchof the time until his painful death in 1923.Juanita Hansen, one of the original Mack Sennett comediennes, was a victim ofthe Reid scandal. Her name was discovered in a letter from a doctor from whomshe had sought treatment, and she was arrested and held in jail for three daysto determine whether she was still on drugs. In fact, she had been cured but herarrest destroyed her career. She later launched a foundation to help narcoticsaddicts.Other drug scandals followed. In 1926, Barbara La Marr, the actress who hadplayed the beautiful but villainous Lady de Winter opposite Douglas Fairbanks inThe Three Musketeers, died of a drug overdose. The studio tried to blame herdeath on dieting but the truth soon came out. Alma Rubens, star of East Lynneand Show Boat, suffered a ‘brainstorm’ when her doctor tried to incarcerate herin a private sanatorium in 1929, and stabbed a gas station attendant. Releasedfrom an asylum for the insane, she announced her intention of making a comebackbut was arrested for being in possession of forty cubes of morphine. She diedtwo weeks later in January 1931.Hollywood was treading a tightrope. America was enjoying the age of jazz andbootleg liquor, and the film audiences wanted to know all about it. The Haysoffice wanted ‘virtue’ but the public wanted sin. In 1921, a young unknowncalled Rudolph Valentino created a sensation by the manner in which he dancedwith Helen Domingues in Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse – he made it look asthough they were having sex or were about to vanish to the nearest bedroom. Inhis next film The Sheik, the lustful gleam in his eye as he lifted Agnes Ayresclear of the ground left no doubt whatever that she was about to be subjected toa long-drawn-out rape. But Valentino’s private life was unhappy; both his wivesproved to be lesbians – the first deserted him on their wedding night. Anewspaper article calling him a ‘pink powder puff’ plunged him into gloom and hedied from discouragement as much as from a perforated ulcer. Thousands of womenmourned his death on 23 August 1926; some even committed suicide.The female equivalent of Valentino was Clara Bow, who became a symbol of thejazz age in 1927 when she starred in Elinor Glyn’s film It. Elinor Glyn washerself a symbol of liberated womanhood; her novel Three Weeks is about a youngEnglishman who has a three-week orgy with a princess before she marries adecrepit old king. The book sold five million copies in 1907. A popular rhyme ofthe time ran:> Would you like to sin> With Elinor Glyn> On a tiger skin?> Or would you prefer> With her to err> On some other fur?No doubt this was a reference to the famous seduction scene on a tigerskin rug.After It, Clara Bow became the ‘It girl’ – ‘it’ being some indefinable qualitythat made a woman irresistible. She became the archetypal ‘flapper’ – the zanyyoung lady who rushed from party to party gulping cocktails and shrieking withlaughter. (‘Flapper’ at first referred to any innocent teenager whose pigtail,tied with a bow, flapped as she ran about; by the 1920s it simply meant anyunconventional young lady.) For the studio, the problem was that Clara’s privatelife was a little too much like the roles she played on screen. She was theco-respondent in a divorce case, when the wife of her physician alleged that hefound it necessary to remove all his own clothes before examining Clara. Clarawas forced to pay $30,000 for alienating the doctor’s affections. She was alsothe mistress of B.P. Schulberg, the man who launched her into stardom. He cameto refer to her as ‘crisis-a-day Clara’. There was the occasion when shewandered into a gaming casino at Lake Tahoe and played blackjack, then roulette.She was convinced that her chips were worth 50 cents each when they were, infact, worth $100. She ended by signing a cheque for $24,000. The next day, onthe advice of Schulberg, she stopped the cheque. Menacing bruisers called onher, then on Schulberg; but behind the curtains in Schulberg’s office were twoconcealed policemen, who overheard a threat to throw sulphuric acid in Clara’sface. The bruisers were placed in handcuffs. Schulberg and Clara needed policeprotection for some months after this incident. The newspaper stories portrayingClara as a bad loser tarnished her image as a ‘bright young thing’.Then came the Wall Street Crash and bright young things ceased to be admired byfamilies on the breadline. The advent of talkies further damaged Clara’s image:the fans had imagined her as the kind of girl whose father owned a mansion onLong Island and the sound of a flat Brooklyn accent issuing from that invitingcupid’s bow of a mouth was a disillusionment.The final crisis came in the form of a lady named Daisy De Voe, who became asecretary-companion for three years standing between Clara and the world. Ayoung actor named Rex Bell fell in love with Clara and became increasinglysuspicious of Miss De Voe. After inducing Clara to fire her, he obtained awarrant to open Daisy’s bank vault; it was found to be stuffed with Clara Bow’sjewellery and records of endless transfers from Clara’s special bank accountinto Miss De Voe’s – Daisy had the power to sign cheques on Clara’s account.Threatened with the law, Miss De Voe tried to blackmail the studio for $125,000in exchange for Clara’s love letters from the numerous stars with whom she hadhad affairs – these included Gary Cooper, Eddie Cantor and Bela Lugosi. SinceClara’s career had taken a downward turn, the studio felt she was not worth thatmuch money. Miss De Voe was told to publish and be damned. The court case was asensation; with so many irrelevant revelations about Clara’s bedroom behaviourthat the judge had to remind Daisy that it was she who was on trial, not Clara.She was found guilty and sentenced to eighteen months in jail. When she emerged,she took her revenge by selling a lengthy series on Clara’s love life to aHearst scandal sheet. It included such revelations as a description of the timeClara had given herself to a whole football team, including a young man calledMarion Morrison (who became John Wayne). By mutual agreement, the ‘It’ girl andher studio tore up her contract. As a result Clara had a nervous breakdown – thefirst of many. She married her admirer Rex Bell and moved to a ranch in Nevada,where a combination of alcohol and sleeping pills induced a weight problem andmore nervous breakdowns. She spent much of the rest of her life (she died in1965) in sanatoriums. Her career had ended when she was 26.The star who replaced Clara Bow as Paramount’s major attraction was twenty yearsClara’s senior and her sex life was just as uninhibited, if more private. Bornabout 1886, Mae West was billed as ‘the Baby Vamp’ before she was a teenager. In1926, starring on Broadway in her own play Sex, she was jailed for ten days onobscenity charges. She followed it up with a play called Drag about homosexuals,which she decided not to risk on Broadway. She then scored an enormous successin her play Diamond Lil. In her first film, Night After Night (a typical MaeWest title), she uttered one of her classic lines – when a hat check girl says‘Goodness, what beautiful diamonds!’ she replies (in her sexy drawl), ‘Goodnesshad nothing to do with it.’ She had the gift of making sex funny. Middle-agedmen and women chuckled when she sang, ‘I like a man who takes his time.’ AfterShe Done Him Wrong (1933) she became identified with the line (addressed to CaryGrant), ‘Come up and see me sometime.’ (In fact, it was ‘Come up sometime, seeme.’) Her films were a tremendous success and she saved Paramount (Zukor’scompany) from bankruptcy. But the innuendos scandalized the Hays Office andcaused a tightening up of regulations. They refused to permit dialogue like:> MAE: I like sophisticated men to take me out.> MAN: I’m not really sophisticated.> MAE: You’re not really out yet either.When her film It Ain’t No Sin was advertised on Broadway, a squad of priestsmarched up and down with a poster: Yes It Is. The title had to be changed toBelle of the Nineties. For her next film, Will Hays appointed a censor to stayon the set; despite this, she managed to get away with lines like, ‘A man in thehouse is worth two in the street,’ and ‘It’s better to be looked over thanoverlooked.’ But in a later film, Every Day’s a Holiday, she lost at least twoof her best lines: ‘I wouldn’t even lift my veil for that guy,’ and ‘I wouldn’tlet him touch me, even with a ten-foot pole.’ Even so, lines like: ‘Beulah, peelme a grape’ and ‘It’s not the men in my life that count; it’s the life in mymen,’ entered the public domain. Finally driven to bowdlerize her material by acombination of the Hays Office and the Hearst Press, she returned to thetheatre. At the age of 68, a cabaret act, in which she was surrounded bymusclemen, ran for three years.The scandal caused by Mae West was all on the screen. She was known to lovehulking, muscular males but she was discreet about them. Hollywood’s other seximage, Jean Harlow, had indiscretion thrust upon her by the suicide of herhusband, Paul Bern, production assistant of ‘wonder boy’ Irving Thalberg at MGM.Bern was a soft-spoken intellectual who treated women as if they were ladies inKing Arthur’s court. He had been wildly and romantically in love with Barbara LaMarr and was rumoured to have attempted suicide when she died of a drugsoverdose. In 1932, after the highly successful premiere of Grand Hotel, Berndrove Jean Harlow to see his home and as they drank sherry by his swimming poolhe talked at length about wine. Harlow later told her director why she likedBern, ‘He explains things and lets me know I’ve got a brain. He’s different anddoesn’t talk fuck, fuck, fuck, all the time.’ Two months later Bern and Harlowwere married.Jean Harlow was Hollywood’s latest sex symbol, the ‘blonde bombshell’. Sheattracted attention in a Laurel and Hardy film in which she lost her skirt whenit caught in a door; she became famous in 1930 in Howard Hughes’s Hell’s Angels.Her conversation was laced with obscenities and she looked and sounded like agangster’s moll. In fact, she was intelligent (she wrote a more-than-passablenovel), sensitive and a delightful comedienne.Three months after the marriage, on 5 September 1932, Bern shot himself in thegarden of his house in Benedict Canyon. He left a note saying:> Unfortunately this is the only way to make good the frightful wrong I have> done you and to wipe out my frightful humiliation.> Paul> PS. You understand last night was only a comedy.On the previous evening, apparently, he had gone into their bedroom wearing anenormous artificial phallus. Harlow had burst into shrieks of laughter. Bern hadlaughed too and together they slashed the phallus to pieces with scissors andflushed it down the lavatory. Was this what Bern was referring to? If so, theimplication was obviously that he was impotent and that he had intended toimprove his wife’s sex life with the dildo. But Harlow denied that Bern wasimpotent. Bern’s brother Henry, however, was able to provide a more plausibleexplanation. For five years, Bern had lived in the Algonquin Hotel in New Yorkwith another attractive blonde, Dorothy Millette, who was known as Mrs PaulBern. She had had a nervous breakdown and suffered amnesia; she was confined ina Connecticut sanatorium and doctors agreed her condition was incurable. But itwas not. When Dorothy Millette came out of hospital, she learned that her‘husband’ was now married to Jean Harlow. She wrote to him and told him she wascoming to California.On the evening before Bern’s suicide, neighbours heard sounds of a quarrel nearthe swimming pool. A chauffeur-driven limousine with a veiled woman had beenseen in the area. It seems probable that Dorothy Millette arrived at the houselate at night and there was a quarrel. The ‘wrong’ Bern was referring to in hissuicide note was probably the scandal that would be unleashed by Dorothy’spublic denunciations. (In America, a couple need to live together for five yearsto achieve a common-law marriage so Dorothy would have been able to bring acharge of bigamy.)On the day after Bern blew his brains out, Dorothy Millette boarded the steamerthat left San Francisco for Sacramento and threw herself overboard. In her hotelroom were found a number of letters from Bern, typed by his secretary, allcourteous but formal.Oddly enough, what frightened the studio was not that Harlow’s reputation wouldbe ruined by the scandal, but that people might feel sorry for her, which woulddestroy her image as the hard-boiled blonde-on-the-make. But nothing of the sorthappened, for Louis B. Mayer stopped the scandal before it began. Her love lifecontinued to be unhappy; a marriage to cameraman Harold Rosson – sixteen yearsher senior – lasted only eight months. After that, she fell in love with herco-star William Powell – twenty years her senior. But their relationship wasstormy, punctuated by quarrels, and he declined to marry her on the grounds thathe had already been married to one blonde bombshell – Carole Lombard – and wastoo old to start again. On Saturday 29 May 1937, she began feeling ill on theset of Saratoga and returned home. Her mother, who was a Christian Scientist,declined to call a doctor; she died a week later of uremic poisoning, at the ageof 26.In 1960, the screen writer Ben Hecht provided an interesting footnote to theBern case when he stated in Playboy that Bern had been murdered – almostcertainly by Dorothy Millette – and that the studio had forged the suicide note.Hollywood’s most publicized scandal of the 1930s was the divorce of Mary Astorfrom her husband, Dr Franklyn Thorpe. Mary Astor had a sad, dark-eyed prettinessthat made her look vulnerable. Appearances were deceptive: her diary revealedthat she was a highly dominant lady who thoroughly enjoyed sex. The diary wasfound in her underwear drawer and when Dr Thorpe opened it, his eye fell on thewords: ‘ . . . remarkable staying power; I don’t know how he does it.’ The manreferred to was the playwright George S. Kaufman, co-author of the MarxBrothers’ film A Night at the Opera and (later) of The Man Who Came to Dinner.Mary’s diary recorded how she ‘fell like a ton of bricks’ when she first metKaufman. He kissed her for the first time in a taxi on the way to the theatreand during the third act ‘my hand wasn’t in my own lap . . . It’s been yearssince I felt up a man in public but I just got carried away.’ The couple hadthen hastened back to George’s flat and settled down to an all-night lovemakingsession. ‘Once George lays down his glasses he is quite a different man. Hispowers of recuperation are amazing, and we made love all night long . . . It allworked perfectly, and we shared the fourth climax at dawn.’ She described how‘we went frequently to 73rd Street [Kaufman’s flat] where he fucked the livingdaylights out of me.’ When Kaufman came to Hollywood, Mary hastened to hishotel. ‘He greeted me in pajamas and we flew into each other’s arms. He wasrampant in an instant, and in a few moments it was just like old times . . . hetore out of his pajamas and I never was undressed by anyone so fast in all mylife. . . . It was wonderful to fuck the entire sweet afternoon away.’ And whenthey went to Palm Springs together, she recorded: ‘Ah, desert night – withGeorge’s body plunging into mine, naked under the stars.’Dr Thorpe’s reaction was to beg his wife to break off the affair; with tears inhis eyes he pleaded that he needed her. Mary’s reaction was impatience; she wasdetermined to continue to test George’s staying power for the remainder of hisstay in Hollywood. She moved out of her Beverly Hills mansion and Dr Thorpeproceeded to file for divorce. At the trial, in July 1936, the judge declined toallow the diary to be read aloud in court – he later ordered it to be burned –but the doctor’s lawyers leaked extracts to the press, including thedesert-night quotation, which were printed with asterisks in the appropriateplaces.For a while, it looked as if Mary Astor’s career was finished. It would havebeen if she had been identified with the kind of parts played by Mary Pickfordbut her screen image already had a touch of sin in it – she had played Dreiser’sJenny Gerhardt – and her fans found these revelations piquant rather thandisgusting. Mary went on to play a number of ladies of doubtful morals, likeBrigid O’Shaughnessy in The Maltese Falcon.The effect of the divorce case on Kaufman is not known but Miss Astor’srecommendations can scarcely have done his love life any harm.In the last weeks of 1935, Hollywood had another murder mystery to rival thedeath of William Desmond Taylor. The lovely Thelma Todd had become MissMassachusetts in 1921. She threw up a job as a schoolteacher to make her way toHollywood and in due course showed her talents as a comedienne opposite the MarxBrothers – in Monkey Business and Horse Feathers – and Laurel and Hardy – in FraDiavolo. In 1932, she married an agent named Di Cicco but divorced him two yearslater. In 1935, she had decided to give up films and go into the restaurantbusiness and she and a director named Roland West co-managed Thelma Todd’sRoadside Rest, on the Coast Highway. Thelma was living with West although he wasalready married. On Saturday 14 December 1935, Stanley Lupino and his daughterIda gave a party for Thelma at the Trocadero; Thelma’s former husband Di Ciccoturned up and there was a quarrel. In the early hours of Sunday morning, Thelmawas driven back to her home in Santa Monica. More than 24 hours later, at 10:30on Monday morning, she was found dead in her car in the garage above her beachrestaurant. There was blood on her face but she had died of carbon-monoxidepoisoning. Yet her evening slippers showed no sign of having climbed 270 roughconcrete stairs to the garage. West finally admitted that he and Thelma hadquarrelled violently after she returned home that Sunday morning and that he hadpushed her out of the front door; neighbours had heard her kicking the door andshouting obscenities. The inference was that she had gone to the garage andswitched on the ignition. But why, in that case, were her clothes so rumpled, asif in a struggle? And what of the witnesses, including West’s wife, who claimedto have seen her alive on Sunday, driving a Packard with a dark, handsome manbeside her?The Grand Jury brought in a verdict of ‘death due to carbon-monoxide poisoning’.Her lawyer insisted that she had been murdered on the orders of Lucky Luciano,who had tried to take over the upper storey of Thelma’s Roadside Rest to set upa crooked gambling establishment; she had turned down his offer. But at themention of Luciano’s name, Thelma’s director Hal Roach insisted he was perfectlysatisfied with the suicide verdict. The police received a telegram from Ogden,Utah, stating that Thelma’s killer was in a hotel there but they did nothingabout it.One theory of her death, noted by Kenneth Anger, in his delightful butinaccurate Hollywood Babylon, is that she was murdered by Roland West, who wasgetting tired of the relationship and of the financial problems associated withtheir restaurant. According to this theory, West persuaded a girlfriend to knockon the door and scream, while he knocked out Thelma inside before she wascarried to the garage and left to die. West himself never made another filmafter Thelma’s death, and died, forgotten, in 1952.Whether she was killed by West or by a Luciano henchman, or by some unknown manwho drove her into the garage and left the ignition running, there seems littledoubt that Thelma Todd was murdered. Her death remains a mystery.For the remainder of the 1930s, Hollywood managed to keep out of serioustrouble. The moguls found it very hard to get used to the idea that scandal didnot necessarily mean public outrage and the banning of films. It came to them asa pleasant surprise after Errol Flynn was found not guilty of rape in 1943.Flynn had become famous playing the swashbuckling lead in Captain Blood in 1935,and by 1942 he was one of Hollywood’s most successful male actors. That he wassexually insatiable he admits himself in My Wicked, Wicked Ways. Director,Vincent Sherman felt that Flynn had a basic urge to debase women and tells howFlynn brought two prostitutes on to the set. When he asked how he could find theenergy after a hard day’s work, Flynn explained, ‘I just lie there reading thetrade papers while they work on me.’In Bring on the Empty Horses, David Niven tells an amusing story that indicatesthe swiftness of Flynn’s technique. After suffering from one of Flynn’spractical jokes, Niven planned revenge. A writer friend mentioned that his auntand niece were coming from Ohio, and suggested bringing them to theestablishment shared by Flynn and Niven for drinks. In fact, the ‘aunt’ was a35-year-old prostitute, while the ‘niece’ was a beautiful whore of seventeen.Aunt and niece were introduced to Flynn, then the telephone rang, and the writerannounced that he had to return to the hotel to collect the girl’s mother.Niven, together with the writer and the ‘aunt’, watched outside the window asFlynn grabbed the girl without further ado, pushed her on to the settee andraised her skirts above her head. The girl had been instructed to hold on to herpanties for a few minutes but Flynn overcame this obstacle within seconds.Shortly afterwards, the ‘aunt’ strode into the room and shrieked: ‘Eunice, whatare you doing?’, and the girl peeped out from under Flynn and replied: ‘I don’tknow. Ask Mr Flynn.’ The ‘aunt’ retorted: ‘Mr Flynn, get off my nieceimmediately and explain yourself . . .’ Eunice was sent out of the room suitablydiscomfited, whereupon the ‘aunt’ made a grab for Flynn’s flies, explaining: ‘Isent Eunice out because I want a bit of that myself.’On 27 September 1942, Flynn drove to a party in Bel Air. Towards dusk, a carwith half a dozen teenagers arrived. Among these was a studio messenger boynamed Armand Knapp and his seventeen-year-old girlfriend named Betty Hansen.Betty drank too much and at one point, flopped on to Flynn’s lap, while hecontinued the conversation over her head. At dinner, she had to rush out of theroom to be sick. Afterwards, Flynn suggested she should come up to the bathroomattached to his bedroom; there he told her he thought she should have a sleep.According to Betty, she lay on a bed and Flynn began to undress her, removingeverything but her shoes. She explained that she thought he intended to tuck herup in bed. Then Flynn removed all his own clothes, except his shoes, andproceeded to make love to her for half an hour. One of the girls who had broughtBetty to the party came upstairs to look for her; by this time Betty had douchedherself in the bathroom and was back in bed while Flynn was taking a shower. Thenext day, Betty told her sister that Flynn had seduced her and was taken intoprotective custody in Juvenile Hall.The District Attorney recalled that fourteen months earlier, anotherseventeen-year-old named Peggy Satterlee had claimed that she had been raped byFlynn on his yacht. Flynn later insisted that the DA was inspired by adetermination to ‘clean up’ Hollywood and felt that this was his opportunity. On11 January 1943, Flynn appeared in court. He was defended by the brilliantlawyer Jerry Giesler. Betty described how she had allowed Flynn to remove hertight jeans in the belief that he was putting her to bed. Giesler asked herwhether she still believed this as Flynn removed her panties and she said yes.‘When did you first think about sexual intercourse?’ asked Giesler. The courtroared with laughter when she replied, ‘When I had sexual intercourse with him.’Without much effort, Giesler induced her to contradict herself. She had told thejuvenile officers that she had undressed herself; now she said Flynn hadundressed her. She flatly denied that she had helped him, then admitted that shehad given him some assistance in removing her shirt. Asked if she had helpedremove her panties she said, ‘I might have.’ Finally, Giesler obliged her toadmit that when she had been ‘raped’ by Flynn, she was already in trouble withthe juvenile officers for twice committing an act of oral sex on Armand Knapp.After this, Peggy Satterlee gave her evidence: how she had been on a trip onFlynn’s yacht; how she had climbed into bed in her underskirt and panties andhow Flynn had come into her cabin, got into bed with her and had intercoursewith her. Flynn seems to have used the same technique as with ‘Eunice’, pushingher underskirt over her head, her panties down, then making love to her for halfan hour. After this they went up on deck and he brought her a glass of milk. Thefollowing day she swam with him and they had pictures taken together for Life.That evening, he invited her to his state-room to look at the moon through aporthole. Still in some pain from the previous night – she had been a virgin –she tried to resist but Flynn insisted that, since he had possessed her once, hecould see no reason why he shouldn’t do so again. When he tried to remove herslacks, she fought so hard that the bed curtains were pulled down. Even whenFlynn was inside her, she struggled so hard that his penis came out. This wasdamaging evidence. So was the testimony of a police doctor that Peggy’s genitalswere bruised and swollen and that the hymen was newly torn. But Giesler scored apoint when he pointed out that Peggy could have seen the moon just as well fromthe deck and that in any case, she could not have looked at the moon through theporthole since it was on the other side of the yacht. He also managed to bringout in evidence the fact that, in the following year, Peggy Satterlee had had anabortion – then an illegal operation – and that the charge still hung over her.The implication was clear: that both girls were hoping for leniency from thepolice in exchange for their testimony against Flynn.In the witness box, Flynn denied everything. If the girls had been older, hemight have argued that the intercourse occurred with their consent but sincethey were both underage at the time of the offence, he could still have beenconvicted of statutory rape. So he perjured himself in the witness box. And indue course, the jury found him not guilty. A hysterical woman rushed over to himand kissed him on the lips. And to the unspeakable relief of Warner Brothers,the scandal actually seemed to increase his popularity: his films DesperateJourney and Gentleman Jim played to crowded cinemas.Most writers on the case take the view that Flynn had been ‘set up’ by a coupleof ‘tramps’; but no one who studies the transcript of the case can take thissimplistic attitude. Betty Hansen had just been violently sick, so she wasprobably telling the truth when she said that she objected to Flynn’slovemaking. Peggy Satterlee had been a virgin; she may or may not have beenwilling to surrender her virginity to Flynn in due course, but it seems clearthat he did not give her the choice. And her story of her struggle to avoid asecond bout of lovemaking when she was still sore from the first has a ring oftruth.In his autobiography My Wicked, Wicked Ways, Flynn admits having sex with PeggySatterlee, insisting that he had no idea she was under eighteen. On the delicatequestion of Betty Hansen, he avoids difficult questions by simply omitting tomention her appearance on the witness stand.This close brush with the law seems to have taught Flynn nothing about thedangers of having intercourse without first asking the girl’s permission. Duringthe trial he noticed a pretty girl serving behind the tobacco stand in the Hallof Justice. Her name was Nora Eddington. Flynn persuaded her to go out with himand discovered that she was an innocent virgin who regarded herself as engagedto a marine. He bided his time, took her out, and tried repeatedly andunsuccessfully to steer her towards the bedroom. One night, after drinkingheavily (and, according to one biographer, taking cocaine) he took her back tohis house, pushed her into the bedroom and tore off her clothes. Then heundressed and raped her. She testified, ‘I didn’t know what was happening. I wasterrified. Suddenly he was thrusting into me. It was like a knife. . . . Therewas blood everywhere.’ Afterwards, Flynn wept and begged forgiveness; Noramarried him but then, when she discovered he was incapable of staying faithful,divorced him.Flynn’s career went downhill in the 50s, largely as the result of heavy drinkingthat caused the once-handsome face to become fleshy and coarse. He died in 1959of a heart attack at the age of fifty. In 1980, in a book called Errol Flynn,The Untold Story, a writer named Charles Higham accused Flynn of being abisexual and a German spy. It is impossible to tell whether there is any truthin the bisexuality charge – Higham alleges that Flynn’s frequent trips to Mexicowere spent in pursuit of teenage boys – but the spy charge certainly remainsunproven. Flynn was apparently a close friend of a certain Dr Hermann FriedrichErben, whom Higham describes as ‘one of the most important and ingenious Naziagents’. Flynn apparently met him on the island of New Britain, in the Pacific,after Flynn had been shipwrecked in 1933. Subsequently, Erben seems to haveturned up frequently in Hollywood. But even if, as Higham insists, Flynn hadNazi sympathies, it is impossible to see how, as a film star, he had anyopportunity to do espionage work for Erben. Higham tells a story of how Flynnand Erben went to Spain during the civil war, their intention being to interviewGermans fighting for the loyalists, and to report their names to Berlin, sotheir families could be persecuted. But it hardly seems necessary to send afamous film star from America for this purpose as an ordinary German infiltratorwould have served just as well. Higham’s account of Erben makes it clear that,for an ‘important and ingenious Nazi agent’ he was unbelievably incompetent andregrettably accident-prone. The reaction of most reviewers to Higham’s ‘untoldstory’ was one of understandable scepticism; they found it difficult to creditthe hard-drinking, sexually insatiable Hollywood playboy with the firmness ofpurpose necessary for a spy. It is true that there have been such spies, butnone of them made highly successful films in their spare time. Whatever thefinal judgement on his life and personality, Errol Flynn will continue to liveon in folk memory for the satisfyingly descriptive catchphrase ‘In like Flynn’.At the time Flynn was deflowering Peggy Satterlee on the Sirocco, Hollywood wascontemplating another evolving scandal with a mixture of eagerness and alarm.Hollywood’s two leading gossip columnists were Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper;the former worked for the multi-millionaire newspaper magnate William RandolphHearst, the inventor of ‘yellow journalism’ (i.e. stories of doubtfulauthenticity but high scandal value). Early in 1940, the young theatricaldirector Orson Welles had arrived in Hollywood and before the year was out, thetown was full of rumours that he was making a film based on the life of awell-known newspaper publisher. The obvious candidate was Hearst, although noone was sure (since there was only one script and Welles slept with that underhis pillow). Hearst was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood – in fact, inAmerica – so there were expectations of an explosion. To Louella Parsons, Wellessolemnly denied that his film was about her boss. But when he invited her rivalHedda Hopper to a private screening of Citizen Kane, she watched it withincreasing dismay. It was not a matter of ‘accidental resemblance’ to Hearst;this was a carefully considered, deliberately unfair attack on thearch-capitalist tycoon. Hearst was an old friend of Hedda Hopper’s. ‘You won’tget away with it,’ said Hedda. ‘You want to bet?’ said Welles.In making Citizen Kane Welles had every intention of creating a scandal. He had,in a sense, built his career on scandal, and so far it had done him no harm. Hisacting career began at the age of sixteen with a touch of deceit. He hadpresented himself at the stage door of the Gate Theatre in Dublin and announcedhimself as a star of the New York Theatre Guild. The theatre’s director, HiltonEdwards, was not entirely deceived but liked the young man’s cheek, and offeredhim a part in Jew Süss. Three years later he made his Broadway debut inShakespeare. In 1937, he and John Houseman set up the Mercury Theatre project inNew York; it was an attempt to transplant the left-wing theatre of Brecht andWeill to America. In July 1937, Welles had an opportunity to demonstrate hisgenius for improvisation and also for making the headlines. The theatre projecthad scheduled the production of Marc Blitzstein’s satirical operetta The CradleWill Rock, a violent attack on capitalism and glorification of trade unionism.At the last minute, the government cancelled the production. It happened so latethat a queue had already formed outside the theatre. Welles told some of hisactors to entertain them, while he tried to find a theatre. Finally a little manwho had been trying to see Welles all day – and whom Welles had been avoidingbecause he looked like a process-server – managed to explain that he owned atheatre nearby which they could use. The whole audience of two thousand was ledup Broadway to the Venice Theatre. A piano on a truck followed them. An Equity(union) ban prevented actors from appearing on stage but there was nothing tostop the actors from standing up in the audience and playing their parts, whileBlitzstein himself played the piano on stage. A spotlight picked out each actoras he stood up. The evening was a sensation. The next morning, Welles wasdeluged with offers from other theatrical managers to present The Cradle WillRock in exactly the same manner.In the following year, Welles began presenting Mercury Theatre projects on theradio; for the fourth show he chose H.G. Wells’s War of the Worlds. On hearingthe recording, Welles decided it was dull and that the only way to improve itwas to make it more ‘newsy’ by presenting it as a series of newsflashes. Afterthe introduction (read by Welles), an announcer explained that the programmewould be continued from the dance floor of a hotel. Then the music wasinterrupted by a newsflash about explosions on the planet Mars. A secondnewsflash announced a meteorite in New Jersey that had killed many people. Afterthat, more news bulletins and on-the-spot reports described the arrival of theMartians, horrible leathery slugs with murderous ray guns.Many people who switched on after the beginning were thrown into a panic.Families rushed out of their houses and took to the roads; others went andcamped in the open. Meanwhile, on the radio, the voice of President Roosevelt –in reality an actor – begged the nation not to panic. Before the end of thebroadcast, the mayor of a mid-Western town had rung up to say that there wereterrified mobs in the streets. The New York police department received 2,000calls in fifteen minutes. The CBS network had to make broadcasts every tenminutes for the next 24 hours, reassuring America that the Martians had notreally landed. Welles had achieved overnight fame – or at least, notoriety.It was inevitable that he should be invited to Hollywood and equally inevitablethat he should think of his first film there in terms of scandal orsensationalism. His leftist affiliations suggested capitalism as a target and asuper-capitalist as its subject. He chose one whose income was $15 million ayear.William Randolph Hearst, born 1863, was the son of a multimillionaire owner ofsilver mines. He used his inherited fortune to become a press baron. In 1917, atthe age of 54, he had fallen in love with a Ziegfeld Follies girl, MarionDavies, a delightful blonde with a stutter and a sense of humour. He had set outto turn her into another Mary Pickford. He spent millions on her films. (When afriend told him there was money in the movie business Hearst replied drily,‘Yes, mine.’)Inevitably, the Hearst newspapers – he owned about forty – hailed every newMarion Davies film as a triumph. Unfortunately, Marion was no Mary Pickford; herreal talent lay in light comedy, not drama. All her films lost money andHearst’s aggressive publicity campaigns alienated the public. Hearst wasdiscreet about his affair but it became public knowledge in 1923 when a crookedattorney named Fallon, charged with corruption, stated in court that MarionDavies was the mother of twins and Hearst was the father. (The whole story wasan invention.)Three months after the Fallon trial, in November 1924, Hearst and Marion Davieswere the subject of even more scandalous gossip. On 15 November a group ofHollywood celebrities was invited on to Hearst’s yacht Oneida for the birthdayparty of the pioneer Western director Thomas Ince. Ince became ill, apparentlywith acute indigestion, and was put on a train for his home in Los Angeles. Hedied two days later of a heart attack. His body was cremated. But there werepersistent rumours that Ince had been shot by Hearst, who had caught him makinglove to Miss Davies. The rumours were so persistent that the District Attorneyfelt obliged to investigate them. He concluded that they had no foundation. Butinevitably, this only led to rumours that Hearst had paid out thousands ofdollars to suppress the truth. In Hollywood Babylon, Kenneth Anger describes howCharlie Chaplin and Marion Davies had slipped off together to the lower deck andthat when Hearst went looking for them, he found them in flagrante delicto.Marion screamed, ‘M-m-m-murder!’, which brought other guests rushing to the spotas Hearst ran for his diamond-studded revolver; when Hearst fired, it was Incewho dropped dead with a bullet in his brain.In his autobiography, Chaplin insists that he was not even present on Hearst’syacht and explains that the rumours about Ince’s death were absurd because heand Hearst went to see Ince two weeks before his death: ‘He was very happy tosee . . . us and believed he would soon be well.’ Since Ince died only two daysafter being taken off Hearst’s yacht, this story hardly disproves the ‘uglyrumours’. Even a standard reference work like Ephraim Katz’s International FilmEncyclopedia states that ‘Thomas Harper Ince was mysteriously and fatallyinjured aboard William Randolph Hearst’s yacht. . . . He died before regainingconsciousness.’ So it is just conceivable that the death of Ince occurred undersuspicious circumstances.All this explains why there was alarm and fury in the Hearst encampment whenHedda Hopper telephoned to say that Citizen Kane was a thinly disguised portraitof Hearst, complete with scandal. Hearst’s film columnist Louella Parsons wasasked to arrange a private screening and to take some lawyers along. Welles wasdelighted to oblige – his fellow actor George Coulouris believes that he hadbeen hoping to create a scandal. Louella Parsons left the screening lookingshattered and rushed to tell Hearst that he was being portrayed as a ruthlesscapitalist exploiter. Hearst immediately sent a telegram to the film’s producerat RKO demanding that the film should be withheld pending legal action. Theproducer, George Schaefer, defiantly refused. There was panic in Hollywood; itwas generally felt that if Hearst was offended, then his newspapers wouldboycott Hollywood films which might lead to the bankruptcy of some studios.Louis B. Mayer offered to pay RKO $800,000 – the cost of the film – to destroyit; Schaefer refused. Louella Parsons proceeded to attack Welles in her column,which was syndicated all over America. Her rival Hedda Hopper thereuponannounced that she would devote six of her radio programmes to a biography ofthe young genius Orson Welles. The nationwide furore was a publicity godsend.When Citizen Kane was finally shown in April 1941, it was an immense criticalsuccess, one critic declaring it to be ‘the finest film of all time’. (The truthis that Citizen Kane is rather a silly film, with its presupposition that thewicked newspaper magnate – the man who never loved anybody – has a sentimentalyearning for childhood innocence, symbolized by his sledge ‘Rosebud’. In fact –as Welles knew – ‘Rosebud’ was Hearst’s pet name for Miss Davies’ privateparts.)The scandal that Welles envisaged in Citizen Kane (‘Newspaper Boss Caught InSinger’s Love Nest’) had no foundation in fact; apart from their one brush withscandal in the Fallon case, Marion and Hearst lived together as placidly as anelderly married couple until Hearst’s death, at the age of 88, in 1951. It is anironical footnote to the story that Citizen Kane was a box-office failure.The year 1943 saw the downfall of the actress Frances Farmer, a determinedindividualist who frequently confessed that the only thing she liked aboutHollywood was the money. She had won a trip to the Soviet Union in an essaycompetition when she was a student; when she came to New York in the late 30s,she acted in the Group Theatre, which (like Welles’s Mercury) had strong leftisttendencies; she also acted in Clifford Odets’s Golden Boy. A few decades later,she would have fitted perfectly comfortably into the anti-Vietnam war movementbut in Hollywood in the 40s, she was a misfit. Her increasing exasperation withthe triviality of her Hollywood films led her to alienate ‘old timers’ likeZukor and she began drinking too much. In October 1942 she was arrested fordrunken driving on the Pacific Highway and screamed abuse at the cop whoarrested her. She was put on probation. Arrested again for failing to report toher parole officer, she hid in a bathroom and was carried off naked by thepolice. At police headquarters she signed her occupation as ‘cocksucker’. Incourt, the judge asked her about her drinking and she screamed: ‘Listen, I putliquor in my milk, liquor in my coffee and liquor in my orange juice. What doyou want me to do – starve to death?’ The judge stood up and shouted out asentence of 180 days. She screamed back, ‘Have you ever had a broken heart?’(alluding to her stormy affair with Clifford Odets). Then she hurled an ink potat the judge’s head and was carried out kicking.Her mother told the press that this was only a publicity stunt but neverthelessdeclared her a mental incompetent and signed committal papers. In hospital, shewas subjected to insulin shock treatment. For the most part, Hollywood wasdelighted with her downfall. Director, William Wyler commented, ‘The nicestthing I can say about Frances Farmer is that she is unbearable.’ She spent muchof the remainder of the 40s in mental homes and although she made one film, TheParty Crashers in 1958, never succeeded in making a ‘comeback’. She died ofcancer at the age of 57 in 1970.Chaplin’s paternity case, already mentioned, occupied the headlines through muchof 1943. He had suddenly lost his popularity when he appeared at a rally in NewYork demanding that the Allies open a second front to help the Russians. Herecords in his autobiography that after this, he suddenly ceased to be invitedto the houseparties of the rich. The final verdict in the paternity case wasparadoxical in that he was adjudged the father of Joan Barry’s daughter althougha blood test proved conclusively that it was impossible. Since he had admittedthat he had been ‘intimate’ with Miss Barry, the court no doubt felt that hedeserved to be the father.In 1944, Chaplin was acquitted of transporting Miss Barry over state lines forimmoral purposes and that year saw the suicide of one of Hollywood’s mosttempestuous actresses, Lupe Velez, at the age of 36. Born in Mexico and educatedin a Texas convent, she made her name starring opposite Douglas Fairbanks in TheGaucho in 1926. In 1929, she played in Wolf Song opposite Gary Cooper and had anaffair with him. (Cooper’s sex life seems to have been very nearly as eventfulas Errol Flynn’s – he made a habit of sleeping with his leading ladies; butsince he was discreet about it and everyone liked him he managed to stay out ofthe gossip columns.) Cooper found her fiery temper too much for him and shetransferred her affections to Johnny Weissmuller, the Olympic swimmer who playedTarzan. Their married life was stormy – according to Kenneth Anger, ‘Shecouldn’t understand why Johnny would get mad when she’d flash her charms atHollywood parties by flinging her dress over her head – she was always innocentof lingerie.’ After her divorce from Weissmuller, her love affairs becamelegendary – Anger calls her a ‘man-addict’. Finally, heavily in debt, pregnantby her latest boyfriend (and barred from abortion by her Catholic upbringing),she swallowed 75 Seconal tablets and was found lying on her bed with her handscrossed on her breasts in the position of a sleeping madonna.The news sensation of the summer of 1947 was the murder of the gangster BugsySiegel in the home of his mistress Virginia Hill, at 810 Linden Drive, BeverlyHills. Siegel was one of the major figures of Murder Incorporated, the Mafiaorganization headed by Luciano, and had the dubious distinction of turning LasVegas into the gambling capital of the United States. Benjamin Siegel – known as‘Bugsy’ because he appeared to become insane when he lost his temper – had beeninvolved in many murders since he had shot Lucky Luciano’s boss Joe Masseria –one of the old-fashioned style of gangsters – to oblige Luciano. By the time hewas 25 he had his own suite in the Waldorf-Astoria in New York – Luciano livedtwo floors above him. He was sent out to California as an emissary of MurderInc., chosen, perhaps, because he was a friend of actor George Raft, whom he hadknown since childhood in Brooklyn. Soon the handsome, charming Siegel had forcedhis way into the drugs racket in California and had gained control of the movieextras and bit-part players. His sex life was also rumoured to be extremelyactive among the starlets – he had a reputation as a rapist in New York. Hiswife and family had moved west with him but Siegel always behaved like abachelor. In November 1939, Siegel and two more gangsters – Frankie Carbo andWhitey Krakower – were ordered to kill Harry (‘Big Greenie’) Greenberg, a NewYork mobster who had fled to California and was threatening to ‘sing’ to the DA.Greenberg was found dead outside his Los Angeles home late at night. In thefollowing August, another member of Murder Inc., Allie Tannenbaum, had reason tobelieve that he was also on the death list and began to ‘sing’ to the DA of KingCounty, New York, and implicated Siegel in the murder of ‘Greenie’. In January1942, Siegel and Carbo finally went on trial for the murder of Greenberg. Theywere defended by that Hollywood veteran Jerry Giesler, who was able to discreditTannenbaum’s testimony so effectively that Siegel was ‘sprung’.Siegel had been driving through the quiet little town of Las Vegas in 1945 whenit struck him that this would be the ideal place for a gambling casino. Heraised $6 million from the ‘Syndicate’, and built the Flamingo Hotel – hisgirlfriend, Virginia Hill’s nickname.Luciano was deported from America in 1946. One year later, he called a meetingof members of the Syndicate in Havana, Cuba, whose crime was controlled by theSyndicate’s ‘accountant’, Meyer Lansky. When Siegel was asked about repayment of$3 million, he lost his temper and stormed out of the room. Lansky was asked totalk sense into him but Siegel still refused to talk about repayment, no doubtpointing to the vast sums of money he had syphoned into Murder Inc. from thedrugs racket in California.At about 10 o’clock in the evening of 20 June 1947, Siegel and some friendsdrove back from a Santa Monica seafood restaurant to Virginia Hill’s home – shewas away in Europe at the time. (She was a Syndicate courier.) As Siegel satreading the Los Angeles Times on the settee, there was a sound of breaking glassand then the deafening roar of gunfire. Siegel had his nose shot off, his eyesblown out, and his vertebrae smashed; one eye was found on the other side of theroom. At almost the same moment, a Syndicate member named Little Moey Sedwaywalked into the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas and shouted, ‘We’re taking over.’Few people attended Siegel’s funeral and Jerry Giesler reflected that if he hadnot ‘sprung’ Siegel five years earlier, the gangster would probably have stillbeen alive.In 1947, Hollywood had more serious problems than the occasional gang murder.The cold war had brought a wave of anti-communism. Senator Joseph McCarthy hadnot yet arrived on the scene – that would take another three years – but whatwould later become known as McCarthyism was already causing deep divisions inHollywood.In retrospect, it is easy to blame the Americans for overreacting. But in thecold war climate of 1946, it seemed obvious that the Russians were hoping totake advantage of the chaos in Europe to implant communism from France to theBalkans. In due course, America would combat the growing threat with Marshallaid, which revitalized the economies of Europe. In the meantime, it struck manyAmericans that an enormous number of the refugees who had fled from the Naziswere members of the Communist Party, and that they had implanted a communist‘fifth column’ in their own country. The House Un-American Activities Committee,founded in 1938, was given a new lease of life in 1946. In Hollywood, the MotionPicture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals came into existenceunder the presidency of John Wayne. (He was followed by Hedda Hopper.) This wasa direct result of a ‘Reds under the bed’ scare campaign initiated by NewHampshire congressman J. Parnell Thomas, who set out to prove that thecommunists had infiltrated the film industry.Hollywood’s problem had always been a certain tendency to view thingssimplistically, in terms of goodies and baddies. Its domination by a fewpowerful cliques also bred the conspiratorial mentality. In fact, very fewactors or directors were deeply interested in politics. The problem was thatthose who were interested were usually the more intelligent ones and since manyof them had been involved in the anti-fascist movement of the 1930s, it followedthat their views were distinctly towards the left.Thomas and his committee subpoenaed many actors and writers. Ten of the writersrefused to tell the committee whether they had ever been communists and weresent to jail – they became known as ‘The Hollywood Ten’. (Ironically, one of theten, Dalton Trumbo, was to meet J. Parnell Thomas in jail – he had beensentenced for sharp practice concerning the payroll.) The thriller writerDashiel Hammett was later sentenced to six months in jail for refusing to revealnames and all his books were allowed to go out of print. Charlie Chaplin wasexcused from appearing before the committee when he explained that he was simplya ‘peace monger’, but attacks on him in the press led to the widespread banningof his latest film, Monsieur Verdoux. Many careers were ruined: John Garfield,Gale Sondergaard, Larry Parks (who had played the title role in The JolsenStory); many others – like Joseph Losey and Jules Dassin – found themselvesunemployable in Hollywood and had to move abroad.Humphrey Bogart, who was an individualist and a libertarian without having theslightest communist tendency, organized a protest group called The Committee forthe First Amendment, which included Lionel Barrymore, John Ford, Gregory Peck,John Huston, Billy Wilder, Ira Gershwin, Gene Kelly, June Havoc and Danny Kaye.On 24 October 1947, a planeload of stars and directors, led by Bogart(accompanied by Lauren Bacall), flew to Washington, with press conferences enroute at St Louis, Kansas City and Chicago. It was not a good idea. ‘We went inthere green and they beat our brains out,’ said Bogart later. ‘In the shuffle webecame adopted by the communists, and I ended up with my picture on the frontpage of the Daily Worker . . . That the trip was ill-advised and even foolish Iam ready to admit . . .’ Bogart was fortunate; he was the studio’s biggest star.But many other of the three hundred members of his protest committee foundthemselves on a permanent blacklist that ended their careers in Hollywood.The irony was that there were no real villains in this particular drama. Thenames who supported the Un-American Activities Committee – Ronald Reagan, JohnWayne, Gary Cooper, Robert Taylor, Charles Coburn, Adolphe Menjou, GeorgeMurphy, Walt Disney, Howard Hughes – were equally sincere and well-meaning; theyalso regarded themselves as libertarians. It was basically a problem incommunication – an art, paradoxically, in which Hollywood has never beenskilled. The political scandal of 1947 was really a storm in a teacup, yet itcame closer to destroying Hollywood than 25 years of sexual scandal.In 1948, 29-year-old Carole Landis, star of the original version of A Star isBorn, and described as having ‘the best legs in town’, told Photoplay, ‘Everygirl in the world wants to find the right man, someone who is sympathetic andunderstanding and helpful and strong, someone she can love madly. Actresses areno exception.’ For Carole, the man who fitted these specifications was theEnglish actor Rex Harrison, who was already married to Lilli Palmer. On 4 July1948, in a fit of depression, Carole Landis took an overdose of sleepingtablets. One of the underlying causes of her depression may have been the factthat, although talented, she had never succeeded in starring in anything butsecond-rate B pictures.A few weeks later, the studios had their biggest publicity headache since theErrol Flynn rape case. Late on the evening of 31 August 1948, Robert Mitchum,the idol of the ‘bobby soxers’, arrived at a party at the house of his friendLila Leeds in Laurel Canyon, where everyone was smoking pot. Mitchum had onlyjust lit up when the door burst open and two policemen rushed in. Mitchum wasthe major catch. RKO executives bit their nails at the thought of the moraloutrage of American parents at the revelation that the hero of the teenagers wasa ‘dope fiend’. Mitchum declined to worry. As a teenager he had been a convictin a Georgia chain gang, on a vagrancy charge, and had escaped; later he workedas a drop-hammer operator. He got into films by accident, as a result ofwandering on to a ‘Hopalong Cassidy’ set, and the sleepy-eyed, menacingexpression – the look of a born rebel – soon made him, together with FrankSinatra, the dream-man of every underage girl. He had frequently remarked thatacting was not a suitable job for a grown man; the thought of losing his publicwas, therefore, not entirely alarming.He hired Jerry Giesler – it cost him $50,000 that he didn’t possess – whoseadvice was not to enter a plea, either of guilty or not guilty. If he pleadednot guilty, it meant a lengthy trial and many revelations about pot-smoking inHollywood that would be bad for the film industry in general. The minordisadvantage was that Mitchum would almost certainly draw a prison sentence. Hedecided to take the risk and the press ground its collective teeth when Gieslerannounced in court that he would waive a jury trial. There was one bad momentfor Mitchum when the judge announced that the sentence would be two years,followed by considerable relief when this was reduced to sixty days, with therest on probation. Mitchum served his two months without complaint and had itshortened by a day for good behaviour. It emerged later that the whole thing hadbeen set up by the police. The friend who had taken Mitchum to the party hadbeen trying to persuade him to go all day. The police had hidden a microphone inthe room and informed the press in advance that they expected to arrest a majorfilm star; they waited for Mitchum’s arrival before bursting in.The main question was how the fans would take it. In fact, it made no obviousdifference to Mitchum’s popularity – and neither did a great deal of badpublicity during the next decade about public brawls and a tendency to riptelephones off walls. It underlined the point that the public has no objectionto stars behaving in private as they behave on the screen; the baddie whobehaves like a baddie upsets no one. It is when the goodie behaves like a baddiethat the fans ask for their money back.As this recognition sank in, the whole concept of scandal became increasinglyblurred in Hollywood. If ‘bad behaviour’ can, under the right circumstances,improve a star’s image, then clearly it may be a waste of time to be good. Inany case, the notion of what constituted a film star was changing. From 1920onward, the women were expected to be glamorous and the men handsome andsophisticated. When 23-year-old Marlon Brando created a sensation as the brutishworking-class lout in A Streetcar Named Desire in 1947, the male image began tochange. Brando talked in a mumble – a technique known as ‘the Method’ (whichmeant acting natural) – and slouched around with no attempt at athletic grace.In Hollywood he dressed in a rumpled T-shirt and jeans and ate cherries out of abag. His admirer James Dean improved on this image to the extent of taking outhis penis on the set to urinate.The public now seemed to expect its stars to behave scandalously and in 1952 apublisher named Robert Harrison decided to satisfy their expectations bylaunching a magazine called Confidential, whose first issue sold a quarter of amillion copies. Its aim, quite simply, was to dig out the dirt on the stars –who was a nympho, who was a drug addict, who was sharing her boyfriend with herdaughter, who was a homosexual or a lesbian. The financial success of themagazine was so enormous that Harrison could afford to pay spies considerablesums of money for a gossip-column item. The concealed tape recorder and themini-camera took the place of the prying reporter whose manner invited a snub.What Harrison soon realized was that most stars prefer to minimize the damage byignoring the attack – the principle utilized by Jerry Giesler in the case ofMitchum’s arrest for pot-smoking. But finally, one of the victims decided therisk was worth it; after an article alleging nudist romps in a forest, DorothyDandridge sued Confidential for $2 million. Other stars followed suit. The moviechiefs realized that this could end as an unprecedented series of revelationsabout the private life of the stars and some of the more vulnerable – includingClark Gable – were hastily despatched on vacations to distant parts. Allattempts by the Hollywood moguls to hush-up the scandal failed and the case cameto court in August 1957. Dorothy Dandridge had dropped her charge, in exchangefor a substantial out-of-court settlement. Maureen O’Hara moved into the frontline. She sued Confidential because they had accused her of various indecentintimacies with a handsome South American in Grauman’s Chinese Theatre. Herdefence was that she had been in Spain on the date of the alleged indecenciesand she was awarded $5,000. Liberace received an out-of-court settlement of$40,000. (Two years later, in England, he sued the Daily Mirror for implying hewas a homosexual and received £8,ooo.) So many other stars received settlementsthat Harrison decided to call it quits and sold Confidential soon afterwards.Polly Gould, a member of his editorial staff, committed suicide the day beforeshe was due to give evidence and it emerged later that she was virtually a‘double agent’ selling the magazine’s secrets to the DA and passing on the DA’ssecrets to the magazine.After Confidential, the age of Hollywood scandal was virtually over. Starsrealized that nothing short of murder was likely to cause adverse publicreaction. Errol Flynn was one of the first to cash in with his autobiography MyWicked, Wicked Ways, and other stars followed suit. The next major Hollywoodscandal did involve a murder. On 4 April, Good Friday, 1958, Jerry Giesler wassummoned to the home of Lana Turner at 730 North Bedford Drive, where a corpsewas lying on the floor, the stomach stained with blood. It was her gangsterboyfriend, Johnny Stompanato. He had been fatally stabbed by Lana Turner’sdaughter, fourteen-year-old Cheryl, after hearing Stompanato threaten topainfully disfigure her mother.Lana Turner’s career had started at about the same age when she was playingtruant from school, and sipping a milkshake in a drugstore on Sunset Boulevard,wearing a tight sweater. A journalist approached her and asked if she had everthought of getting into the movies. Through an agent friend of the journalist,Lana (real name Mildred) achieved a bit-part in a film called They Won’t Forgetin which she was raped and murdered at an early stage. As ‘the sweater girl’ sheachieved fame during World War II and became a favourite pin-up of Americanservicemen. Her first marriage to bandleader, Artie Shaw, lasted two months andcaused her to have a nervous breakdown. The second husband, a young executivenamed Stephen Crane, asked her to dance for a bet, and married her nine dayslater; he was the father of Cheryl. Her third marriage was to a millionaire, BobTopping; the fourth to the screen Tarzan, Lex Barker. There were also a numberof well-publicized romances, with Frank Sinatra, Howard Hughes, Tyrone Power andFernando Lamas, the Argentinian star. By the mid-1950s, her sweater-girl imagehad been outgrown and her career was foundering. It was after the breakup of themarriage to Lex Barker that Johnny Stompanato, former bodyguard of gangsterMickey Cohen, telephoned her out of the blue – for a bet – and invited her outon a blind date. Stompanato was a muscular, hairy-chested specimen who wasnicknamed Oscar, apparently because a vital part of his anatomy was about theheight of a Hollywood Oscar when upright. Like most dominating females, Lanaapparently liked her men athletic and rough. On one occasion Stompanato toldher, ‘When I say hop, you’ll hop; when I say jump, you’ll jump.’ Lana was notaverse to obeying orders but when her own latent dominance surfaced, there wereexplosions.It seems clear that there was a mutual obsession. When she came to England tostar with Sean Connery, Stompanato followed her, and attempts to strangle herand threats to slash her with a razor led the police to have him deported. Backin America, she and Stompanato went on holiday to Acapulco, and then shereturned in time to receive her academy award for her part in Peyton Place, awelcome upswing in her career.On Good Friday 1958, Stompanato and Lana went to her home in Beverly Hills in astate of violent disagreement. The quarrel was so noisy that Cheryl was afraidhe was about to attack her mother; she removed a carving knife from the kitchendrawer. The quarrel continued in Lana’s bedroom and Cheryl looked in to see whatwas happening; her mother asked her to go away. But when her mother began toscream, Cheryl again looked in and saw Stompanato swinging at her mother with acoat on a coathanger. This time Cheryl rushed at him and, apparently, hit him inthe stomach. Stompanato groaned, clutched at his stomach and collapsed. At thispoint, Lana Turner saw the carving knife in her daughter’s hand.A doctor was sent for and administered adrenalin, while Lana tried the kiss oflife. It was useless. Shortly afterwards, Stompanato’s heart stopped.The case made all the front pages and fuel was added to the flames whenStompanato’s former boss Mickey Cohen handed over a dozen of Lana Turner’s loveletters to the press. The scandal sheets hastened to print them in facsimile.They certainly revealed that she was hopelessly infatuated with Stompanato. Incourt, Lana and Cheryl had all the sympathy of the jury, which arrived at averdict of justifiable homicide.The dead man’s brother filed a suit for $800,000 damages against Cheryl’sparents, alleging parental negligence. It was settled for $20,000.This time the studios had no doubt that their star would not survive; murder wassurely going too far? But to everyone’s astonishment, the scandal had theopposite effect; Lana Turner’s declining career revived triumphantly. During theshowing of Another Time, Another Place – the film she had made with Sean Connery– members of the audience shouted: ‘We’re with you, Lana.’ And her career oncemore prospered as it had in the early 1940s. The scandal had proved to be thebest kind of publicity.The Stompanato scandal could be regarded as a watershed in the history ofHollywood. For it meant, in effect, that the age of scandal was over. A scandalis not a scandal unless people are shocked – or at least, pleasantly titillated.When, in 1958, the press discovered that Marlon Brando’s latest wife, formerlyAnna Kashfi, was not (as she claimed) an Indian actress but the daughter of aWelsh factory worker named Pat O’Callaghan, the news was splashed in thetabloids because it aroused malicious amusement. Brando, the great tamer ofwomen, had been fooled by a scheming Welshwoman. But this was not true scandal,only gossip laced with spite. Real scandal, the kind that had destroyed FattyArbuckle in 1921 and almost destroyed Ingrid Bergman when she deserted herhusband for the director Roberto Rossellini in 1947, was a thing of the past. Inretrospect, it seems symbolic that the decade of the 60s opened with thepublication of Lady Chatterley’s Lover in England and America, followed shortlyby Henry Miller’s Tropic of Cancer. It meant that adultery and fornication hadceased to be shocking and had become only mildly reprehensible. And as far asHollywood stars were concerned, it was taken for granted as part of theirlifestyle. When Frank Sinatra came to Hollywood in the early 1940s, legend hasit that he pinned on his dressing-room door a list of the actresses he wanted tosleep with and crossed them off one by one as he achieved his object. A currentjoke had it that among Hollywood’s hat-check girls, the definition of a squarewas someone who hadn’t slept with Frank Sinatra. But the studio’s publicity menwere at pains not to allow this image to reach all those fans who adored Sinatrafor the warm sincerity of his voice and the boyishly innocent smile. By the1960s, a rock star was expected to prove his virility as a stud. Elvis Presleyhad been shocking the middle classes since the mid-1950s with his unashamedlysexual gyrations on stage. When he came out of the army in 1960, he brought afourteen-year-old girl back with him from Germany and began to sleep with herimmediately. Although he married Priscilla Beaulieu, he left her behind when hewent to Hollywood in the early 60s, when his name was linked with a series ofactresses. After his death from a drugs overdose in 1977, a cinema cashierdescribed how Presley had made her his mistress fourteen years earlier. Beforehe married Priscilla, Presley had told his stepmother that he had slept withabout a thousand girls. A biography published after his death described how oneof his lieutenants would go out to the gate of his Memphis mansion, select oneof the mob of girls waiting outside and bring her in for Elvis. Even during hislifetime, no one was shocked by rumours like this; it was expected of a rockstar.Jimi Hendrix, the black ‘rock demigod’ of the 60s, deliberately tried to outdoPresley in open sexual movements so there were times when he looked as if he wassodomizing his guitar (which, typically, he called ‘Electric Lady’). Often heended his performance by smashing his guitar to pieces and on one occasion heset it on fire with lighter fluid. Surrounded permanently by ‘groupies’, Hendrixwas able to ‘use girls like some people smoke cigarettes’, as one of his morepermanent girlfriends put it. His virility was apparently extraordinary. Twogroupies started an interesting project of taking plaster casts of the erectmembers of rock stars and other celebrities; one of them would induce theerection by fellatio. Hendrix was one of the few who could not only sustain hiserection until the plaster dried but who made it impossible to remove theplaster because his penis refused to go limp. In 1970, at the age of 27, Hendrixtook too many sleeping pills one night and drowned inhaling his own vomit. Hewas mourned as wildly and intensely as Rudolph Valentino had been in the 20s.Even the Beatles, whose public image was more seemly, made no real attempt toconceal active sex lives, aware that such revelations would do them no harm.Biographers Peter Brown and Steven Gaines in The Love You Make (1983) describehow, on the set of A Hard Day’s Night, the Beatles hired a movie projector towatch porno movies, and, ‘boys being boys, the young girls on the set being usedas extras were discreetly lured into the trailers for quickies between takes.’Their two road managers had the task of keeping them supplied with sex when ontour. ‘Mal wasn’t above the “If you fuck me first I’ll introduce you to them”’routine. The girls were screwed, blewed and tattooed, before Mal and Neil sweptthem out of the Beatles’ suite at dawn. The girls left with an autographedpicture, forged by Neil and Mal, and were told to keep their mouths shut.Miraculously, for no reason anyone can explain, the girls kept their mouthsshut. In America, at least, there were no ‘My Night with Paul’ stories in thetabloids, nor were there paternity suits. It was no small wonder, either, sinceit was not uncommon to find fifteen girls waiting in line in Neil’s and Mal’srooms, passing the time by ironing the Beatles’ stage costumes.All this, then, helps to explain why there have been so few Hollywood scandalssince 1960. The nearest thing to the old ‘shock headlines’ of the 20s and 30swere the headlines announcing the killing of Sharon Tate and her three guests on8 August 1969, an altogether different and more tragic affair, covered in alater chapter on Roman Polanski."},{"pageContent":"JACKSON, MICHAELTHE PAEDOPHILIA ACCUSATIONSMICHAEL JACKSON, ONCE an internationally beloved child pop star who went on tocreate the best-selling music album to date, is now seen by many people as abizarre eccentric who shelters from reality in a self-created, multi-milliondollar fantasy world. That world almost came crashing down in 2003, when Jacksonwas accused of multiple counts of paedophilia and child abuse.Born in 1958, Jackson was thrust onto the entertainment industry at a very youngage. His father, Joseph Jackson, was a mill crane operator who had long dreamedof becoming a famous blues musician. As this became less and less likely, Joebegan training his children to make it where he had failed. He initially put hiseldest three sons – Jackie, Tito and Jermaine – on the stage at numerous childtalent competitions. Then, in 1962, he added his two youngest boys – Marlon andMichael – to the Jacksons singing act, renaming it The Jackson Five. Michael wasjust four years old at the time.In cases of alleged paedophilia, investigators often try to discover if thesuspects were themselves sexually abused as children. The idea that abused kidsoften become abusers themselves is, fortunately, untrue in the vast majority ofcases, but it proves correct often enough to still be a useful rule of thumb forpolice officers and social workers. There is no known evidence that MichaelJackson was ever sexually abused, but there can be little doubt that his earlylife was often hellish.As The Jackson Five achieved ever-greater success, so Joe Jackson grimly pushedhis sons to work ever harder. The performances, tours and practice sessions wererelentless, and, in a 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Michael stated that hisfather often beat him.‘He was strict; very hard and stern,’ Michael Jackson recalled. ‘It wasdifficult to take a beating and then go on stage.’Michael, as the ‘baby’ of the group, was the most popular with the public. In1971 and 1972 he recorded solo singles that did well enough to indicate that hemight make it on his own. This was increasingly a concern; as The Jackson Five’spopularity waned in the mid-1970s, it looked at times as if Michael’s long-termcareer might go down with them.It was in 1978, during the filming of The Wiz – an all-black version of TheWizard of Oz – that people began to report strange behaviour by the star.Michael, then nineteen years old, played the character of the brainlessscarecrow, but was said to be ‘seeking solace’ in the fantasy role – refusing totake off his make-up after shooting, and sometimes going home in his fullscarecrow costume. His career took another hit when the movie was a tremendousflop. But the following year he recorded Off the Wall, his first solo album asan adult. It achieved great critical acclaim and financial success. He was nowseen as an adult star in his own right and went on to build a gleaming solocareer over the next decade, including his 1982 album, Thriller, which sold 47million copies, a world record that has yet to be broken. The media,unsurprisingly, dubbed him ‘the King of Pop’.However, Jackson’s eccentricity could hardly be denied, even as his successgrew; his other press nickname was ‘Whacko Jacko’. He took his pet chimp,Bubbles, as his dinner guest to the Oscars ceremony. His face changed visiblyover the years as a result of apparently frequent plastic surgery. This initself is hardly remarkable for a celebrity, but it soon seemed that Jackson’sface was looking less African-American and more Caucasian. The fact that hisskin also lost most of its pigmentation, making him appear almost white, didmuch to fuel rumours that he was trying to escape his birth race.In fairness it should be noted that Jackson claims the depigmentation was due tovitiligo, a rare epidermal problem that causes random patches of white skin toappear. However, vitiligo has previously been unknown to affect such a largearea of a person’s skin.At the same time as his skin was turning white, Jackson’s nose shape changed sosignificantly – again apparently due to repeated plastic surgery – that somedoctors warned publicly that his evidently thin nasal cartilage might collapsecompletely if damaged in any way.Then, in 1993, came the first accusation of child molestation. Aneleven-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, accused Jackson of sexually abusing him.Details were not made public at the time, but a security guard at Jackson’spalatial ranch, Neverland, later claimed to have seen Jackson kissing andperforming oral sex on the boy.The following year the case was settled out of court. Jackson paid the Chandlerfamily a reputed $26 million, but publicly insisted that he was innocent of allcharges.Nevertheless, the mere suggestion that the darling of millions of female popfans might be a paedophiliac homosexual shook the music industry and damagedJackson’s sales. Cynics were therefore unsurprised when, not long after settlingthe Chandler accusation, Jackson announced he was in love with and would marryLisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis.The international press, predictably, went wild: the King of Pop was going tomarry the ‘princess’ of the King of Rock ’n’ Roll. They sounded like the dreammusical couple. The marriage lasted nineteen months before ending in divorce.Some people claimed that the timing of the marriage seemed a little tooconvenient, but the couple insisted they married for love.Jackson’s next album, HIStory, did reasonably well in the US and Britain, butcontroversy continued to dog him. At the 1996 Brit awards Jackson, surrounded bya choir of apparently adoring children, was interrupted while performing his‘Earth Song’. Jarvis Cocker, lead singer of the British band Pulp, stormedonstage to denounce Jackson for trying to portray himself as Christ. Jacksonlater said that he was ‘sickened, saddened, shocked, upset, cheated and angry’at Cocker’s accusation.The next year Jackson suddenly announced that he was to marry for a second time.The woman in question was an Australian nurse, Debbie Rowe, who was alreadyexpecting their first child. Some cynics questioned the paternity of the child.The lyrics to Jackson’s 1983 hit ‘Billie Jean’ were ironically quoted by somemembers of the press: ‘the kid is not my son . . .’The child was a boy, christened Prince Michael Jackson. During the next year,1998, a daughter was born. She was named Paris Michael Katherine Jackson.Jackson divorced Debbie Rowe in 1999. She later said that she had left the twochildren in the care of their father ‘as a gift’. However, in 2006 Rowepetitioned the courts for custody of the two children.In 2001 Jackson’s next album, the perhaps hubristically titled Invincible, wasreceived badly by the critics and sales were sluggish.A little mystery surrounded the 2002 birth of Jackson’s third child, PrinceMichael Jackson II: the identity of the surrogate mother has never been madepublic, nor was it explained why the supposedly heterosexual Jackson wouldchoose to father a child in this hands-off manner.Like his other children, the new baby never appears in public without a mask orveil covering his face. Michael Jackson has claimed that this is to protect hischildren from identification by would-be kidnappers, although how a veil canprotect a child when Jackson’s bodyguards and other employees can’t is open toquestion. Some people have suggested the actual reason for the face-coverings isthat Jackson’s ‘children’ look nothing like him, and that this might revive therumours that he isn’t their biological father.Jackson was not so cautious of his baby’s safety on one notable occasionhowever. When visiting Berlin he held the child out over a three-storey dropfrom a hotel balcony for fans and reporters to see. Although some consideredthis reckless endangerment of a child, no charges were pressed against Jacksonby the Berlin authorities.The following year, Jackson gave an extended interview to British television.Martin Bashir, famous for his sympathetic interview of Lady Diana Spencer, wasallowed into Jackson’s Neverland ranch to record his lifestyle there. IfJackson’s publicity people had hoped that Bashir would give Michael an easy orsympathetic interview, they were wrong. Jackson’s home was shown as a weirdpseudo-funfair and Michael himself came across as not only strange-looking, butalso as a wildly extravagant spender (despite the fact that, in 2002, severalmajor banks warned publicly that Jackson was close to going bankrupt). Worsestill, Bashir and his director chose to leave in a section where Jacksonadmitted to sleeping in the same bed with under-age boys – but affectionately,not sexually, he had stressed.In November 2003, police raided the Neverland ranch. Two days later, MichaelJackson was arrested and charged with seven counts of sexually molesting atwelve-year-old boy and two counts of giving intoxicants to a minor for thepurposes of committing a crime. Released on $3 million bail, Jackson told thepress that he would ‘slit [his] wrists’ before he would harm a child. He alsocomplained that the arresting police had been ‘very rough’.The pre-trial hearing began on 16 January 2004. Jackson risked annoying JudgeRodney Melville by arriving at court over twenty minutes late. He pled notguilty to the initial charges, and to an additional four charges of childmolestation and a charge of conspiracy to abduct a child. The trial date was setfor January 2005.Jackson’s accuser turned out to be fourteen-year-old Gavin Arviso, a youngcancer patient whom Jackson had often invited to stay, with other members of theArviso family, at the Neverland ranch. Gavin and his younger brother bothclaimed that Jackson had had ‘outercourse’ (that is, non-penetrative sex) withGavin. The younger Arviso boy claimed that he had seen Jackson, clad in justunderpants, rubbing sexually against the apparently sleeping Gavin on twoseparate occasions. Gavin himself claimed that Jackson had masturbated him tothe point of ejaculation and had tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade Gavin tocaress Jackson’s genitals.They further claimed that Michael Jackson, before committing these acts, haddeliberately ‘groomed’ them (that is, made efforts to seduce them). Thisgrooming process, they claimed, included getting them tipsy on wine (which theysaid Jackson called ‘Jesus juice’) persuading them to say ‘cussing’ words, andshowing them pornographic pictures on the Internet and in magazines.There was some physical evidence that seemed to support this latter claim.Police investigators had found over seventy pornographic magazines in Neverland,some of them in Jackson’s bedroom. In Jackson’s favour, seeming to undermine therumour that he was homosexual, was the fact that the vast majority of themagazines contained only heterosexual content – only four were dedicated tospecifically gay-related themes. On the other hand, the Arviso boys haddefinitely seen at least two of the magazines, as their fingerprints were foundon them.Finally, both boys claimed that Jackson had made them swear to never tell anyoneabout his activities ‘even if they have a gun to your head’.Jackson’s defence team’s main aim was to discredit the Arviso family in the eyesof the jury. They had good luck in this, forcing Gavin’s younger brother toadmit that he had previously lied under oath in an unrelated court case, as hadhis mother.On 13 June 2005, Michael Jackson was acquitted on all charges and walked out ofcourt a free man. The jury took 32 hours to reach their verdict and when theclerk of the court read out their decision, Jackson’s fans cheered. Jacksonhimself made no comment, but his lawyer told the press, ‘The man’s innocent. Healways was.’His reputation, however, has been slower to rescue. After moving to a highlysecluded home in Bahrain with his children, he has only emerged to public viewfor special occasions. For example, he appeared in London in November 2006 toreceive a Diamond Award from the music industry for selling over 100 millionalbums. He also came out of seclusion on 30 December 2006 to attend the funeralof ‘Godfather of Soul’, James Brown. Jackson is currently said to be planning a‘comeback’ album. However, the various paedophile claims laid against MichaelJackson over the years – although none have ever been proved in court – arelikely to forever stain his reputation."},{"pageContent":"KELLY, DAVIDTHE DEATH OF A SCIENTIST AND THE PHANTOM IRAQI WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTIONSHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT on 18 July 2003, the wife of Dr David Kelly rang thepolice to report him missing. Kelly, a respected British expert on biologicalweaponry, had gone for his usual walk at around 3 pm the previous day, but hadfailed to return.Oxfordshire police found his corpse in nearby woodland on Harrowdown Hill. Theautopsy showed that he had ingested 29 tablets of co-proxamol – a pain-killerthat can be fatal in doses of over 20 tablets. The cause of death, however, wasapparently blood loss from a severed ulnar artery in his left wrist. A penknife,which Kelly had owned since his boyhood, was found nearby.Even under normal circumstances the strange death of such an eminent expertwould have made headline news. But Kelly had spent the weeks before his death atthe heart of a storm of national controversy, accusation and counter-accusation.Sentiments attributed to the softly spoken weapons expert had embarrassed andinfuriated the government of Labour Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and had starteda battle of words between government ministers and the BBC – the state-fundedbut supposedly politically impartial British Broadcasting Corporation.To understand why just a few sentences from Dr Kelly – apparently said off thecuff and ‘unattributably’ to a BBC journalist – had had such an explosiveeffect, one has to remember just how tumultuous the first half of 2003 had been.In just over a month, between 19 March and 1 May, America and Great Britain hadsuccessfully invaded Iraq and deposed its dictator, Saddam Hussein.So how was it that a highly successful war and the downfall of a tyrant,followed by the apparent suicide of a weapons expert, had somehow managed to putthe Blair government on the defensive against a significant proportion of boththe British media and general public?Despite the initial success of the Allies in the Iraq War, many people, in thesummer of 2003, were uncertain of the justice or advisability of the invasion.Tony Blair, up to then unassailably popular with a majority of UK voters, washaemorrhaging support over both the war and his close alliance with theRepublican administration of US President, George W. Bush. A few stridentcritics even suggested that the war had been in breach of international law, andthat Bush and Blair deserved some day to face criminal indictments. To TonyBlair’s evident amazement supporting a long-term ally, winning a war andtoppling a dictator had suddenly ceased to be vote-winners. But, given theevents of the previous two years, it was not so surprising.Less than a month after the terrorist attack of 11 September 2001 killed 2,973people on American soil, the US and several of their NATO allies (mostprominently Britain) started to give decisive military assistance to the AfghanNorthern Alliance in their civil war against the Taliban government in Kabul.The result, by December 2001, was the rout and collapse of the Taliban.The Taliban, or ‘Students of Islamic Knowledge’, were fanatical Islamists whoadvocated the most rigid application of Islamic law and practice. Until themid-1990s the US had held an ambivalent view of the Taliban government ofAfghanistan. The Taliban, like many Americans, believed that religious ethicshad a key part to play in national politics and daily life. But they were alsoreactionary religious bigots who denied basic human rights to women and punishedmen for crimes such as shaving and kite-flying.It was in 1996 that the Taliban had offered political asylum to Osama bin Laden,leader of the al-Qaeda organization that, two years later, conducted devastatingterrorist attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania: this, in turn, putthe Taliban firmly in America’s bad books. The situation became infinitely worsewhen bin Laden was identified by US intelligence agencies as the likelymastermind and/or paymaster for the 9/11 attack, and the Taliban continued torefuse to extradite him for trial in the US. This led directly to NATOinvolvement in the Afghan civil war and the Taliban’s defeat (if not, as we willsee, their total destruction as a dangerous guerrilla fighting force).Immediately following 9/11, many commentators had predicted the USA would ‘onlysettle for blood’ in their drive for justice and vengeance. The short butsuccessful Afghan war had indeed spilled the blood of some of the followers ofal-Qaeda and bin Laden (who, however, escaped – and who remains free as of thiswriting).With the Taliban defeated many in the international community called for majorefforts to bring about a reconciliation between the USA and the world’sbillion-or-so Muslims. It was pointed out that the vast majority of Muslims wereshocked and sickened by 9/11, and questioned the extremist beliefs that hadinspired the attack. If the NATO allies poured money into the economicrebuilding of war-torn Afghanistan, they would prove that they were not theenemies of Islam that bin Laden claimed. However, the Republican administrationin the White House had another plan.President George W. Bush and fellow ‘neoconservatives’ like Secretary forDefense Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheyney now argued that theIraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was a ‘real and present danger’ to the US. SaddamHussein’s regime, they argued, had directly supported al-Qaeda terroristoperations like 9/11 and, more importantly, the Iraqis were developing weaponsof mass destruction (atomic, biological and/or chemical) and the long-rangemissiles to carry them. In short, the Iraqis were continuing to support thosewho had attacked America and they would soon have the power to directly anddevastatingly attack the US and her allies.Many Washington insiders took these claims with a pinch of salt: Cheyney,Rumsfeld and other core ‘neocons’ had served in President George Bush Senior’sgovernment during the 1990 ‘First’ Gulf War against Iraq. It was well known thatthese neocons were irritated about the US Army’s failure to go on to conquerIraq after they drove the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. But, after wavering over theidea of militarily toppling Saddam Hussein, President Bush Senior had decidedthat the process of creating a ‘free’ Iraq would likely result in a Vietnam-likeconflict for the USA.In fact, in his autobiography, A World Transformed (Vintage Books, 1999) BushSenior wrote: ‘Trying to eliminate Saddam would have incurred incalculable humanand political costs . . . Had we gone the invasion route, [we] could conceivablystill be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land.’Moreover, critics of the neoconservatives suggested that the safety of the USand her allies was not the main cause of their continued hounding of the Iraqidictator. For example, the only anti-US terrorist operation that has ever beeneven vaguely linked to Saddam Hussein was the botched attempt to kill formerpresident George Bush Senior during his ceremonial visit to Kuwait in 1993.After being made aware of this claimed assassination attempt the incumbent USPresident, Bill Clinton, issued his first act of war – firing 23 Tomahawk guidedmissiles into downtown Baghdad which, among other things, destroyed theheadquarters of the Iraqi covert intelligence organization. The Bush family,however, were reported to have been annoyed that the missile strike had beenscheduled to take place at night, when the intelligence headquarters had beenempty of the hundreds of Iraqi secret service people who might have been killedor injured by a daylight raid. In a 2002 interview for CNN, George Bush Senioradmitted, ‘I hate Saddam Hussein.’ An understandable reaction and one, itseemed, that was shared by his son, President George W. Bush: ‘I’m going to kickhis sorry, mother-fucking ass all over the Mid East.’ This was how the youngerPresident Bush described his intentions for Saddam Hussein to White House pressaides on 1 May 2002, according to Michael Izikoff and David Corn in theirthorough and damning book Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and theSelling of the Iraq War (Crown Publishers, 2006). But was ‘hate’ and a familyvendetta the right motivation to guide US foreign and military policy?Other critics, especially outside the United States, pointed to Iraq’s large oilfields as the reason for the neocons’ wish to topple Saddam. Experts werealready warning that global oil production would ‘peak’ before 2010; that is,the point when the world’s oil fields would start to produce less and less. Andthis just as the world’s oil demand would be at an all time high, with no likelyalternative to oil-powered energy to be developed and implemented before atleast 2020. Even optimistic experts predicted an economic downturn as a result.Others feared another Great Depression or, worse still, worldwide wars to securewhat little oil was left for individual nations or power groups.Conquest of an oil-rich nation – and the subsequent setting up of a puppet or atleast US-friendly regime – might certainly help the US weather such leaneconomic times. But, again, was this a laudable motivation to go to war? TheGerman people had believed that they needed ‘living space’ in 1939, but had thatjustified the Nazi invasion of Poland?The Bush White House rejected all such criticism as cynical point-scoring bytheir political opponents or as false propaganda by the ‘enemies of freedom’,and they were backed in this by the enthusiastic support of British PrimeMinister Tony Blair. However, the General Assembly of the United Nationsremained cautious and refused to be frog-marched into supporting the proposedwar against Iraq. Many countries voiced the suspicion that the real reason forthe rush to war was that the US, and especially the White House, was simplyimpatient to destroy Saddam’s dictatorship.UN economic sanctions had been in force since Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990– maybe, despite Saddam’s proven record of ‘sanction-busting’, a new resolution,creating even stricter sanctions, might strangle the Hussein regime over thenext year or two? But Tony Blair and the Bush administration insisted that onlywar could topple Saddam.So-called ‘regime change’ is not a valid reason to go to war under internationallaw, no matter how vile the regime in question. Otherwise, for example, Hitlercould have legally justified his invasion of Stalin’s Russia as an attempt at‘regime change’. The US and her allies had to prove that Saddam was a genuinethreat to the rest of the world rather than, as he seemed to many, a half-brokentin pot dictator ruling a country and a military that was utterly impoverishedby over a decade of UN sanctions.US and UK spokespersons repeatedly stressed, throughout 2002 and early 2003,that Saddam’s regime was a direct threat to world peace, and as such couldjustifiably be toppled by a military invasion under United Nation rules andinternational law. The White House and 10 Downing Street insisted that they hadbeen given conclusive reports by their intelligence agencies that Saddam – indefiance of the UN non-proliferation policy – was developing weapons of massdestruction (WMD). When asked for solid, ‘smoking gun’ proof to back theseclaims, President Bush’s National Security Advisor, Dr Condoleezza Rice,pronounced chillingly, ‘We don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.’She was suggesting that Saddam might have WMD prepared for use, and might use,them if he were left in power in Iraq. Most of the American public accepted thisargument, but other nations remained sceptical.For example, it was pointed out that if the illegal invasion and occupation ofneighbouring territory and the secret production of weapons of mass destructiondeserved an international response, then the United Nations could and shouldsanction the invasion of Israel. The Israeli ownership of nuclear weapons was,after all, an open secret, and their occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip andGolan Heights had been condemned by a UN resolution (Resolution 242) since 1967.Nevertheless, much ‘evidence’ was presented to the public and the United Nationsin the hope of winning support for the invasion of Iraq. Unfortunately, most ofthis evidence proved uncertain or unreliable. For example, on 24 September 2002,Downing Street published a dossier that purported to prove that Saddam Husseinhad weapons of mass destruction under development. However, closer inspection byParliament, various experts and the media quickly showed it to be a hotchpotchof questionable or out-of-date material, none of which proved conclusive.Even so, one of its claims was that Saddam had missile-mounted chemical weaponsof mass destruction that could reach as far as the island of Cyprus (the nearestBritish military base) and could be readied for launch in just 45 minutes. Thisreceived wide coverage in the British tabloids; one London newspaper headlinescreamed ‘BRITS 45 MINS FROM DOOM!’On 3 February 2003, Downing Street tried again with another dossier. Thisrepeated the claims of the September document, but seemed to be made up of newand up-to-date material from the British Secret Service.On 5 February, US Secretary of State, Colin Powell – a hero of President BushSenior’s 1990 war with Iraq – presented a long and highly detailed report to aplenary session of the UN Security Council. Powell’s oratory was precise andpowerful. Yet his presentation of many satellite pictures of Iraqi buildings andvehicles that he insisted were part of a WMD manufacturing process was less thanconvincing. In this address, Powell also repeated many of the claims that hadoriginally been laid out in the British September and February dossiers.Powell was seeking to convince the United Nations mainly to placate the Blairgovernment, who feared that an attack on Iraq would be illegal without specificUN backing. However, while the UN continued to debate, a heavy blow underminedthe casus belli.On the same day that Colin Powell was presenting his case to the UN, UK Channel4 News had a scoop: Middle East expert Glen Rangwala was quoted as having madesome disturbing discoveries about the second Downing Street dossier, which hadbeen issued only two days before.Rangwala had spotted that much of the dossier’s revelations had been plagiarizedfrom various public sources, and that those sources were left unattributed bythe government. Most quoted was an article by Ibrahim al-Marashi entitled‘Iraq’s Security & Intelligence Network: A Guide & Analysis’, which waspublished in the September 2002 issue of the Middle East Review of InternationalAffairs. Other ‘sourced material’ had been taken from other publicly availablemedia – such as Janes’ Intelligence Review – some of it over seven years old andtherefore out of-date.Indeed, little effort seemed to have been put into the construction of theFebruary dossier – whole sections of text were copied so blindly from theiroriginal sources that even typos and printers’ errors were left in. On the otherhand, at various points the emphasis of the text had been carefully altered,always to more directly accuse the Iraqis of misdemeanours. For example, wherethe original text referred to Saddam ‘aiding opposition groups in hostileregimes’, the dossier wording had been changed to ‘supporting terroristorganisations in hostile regimes’. This was a change that substantially alteredthe original meaning: support for opposition groups in foreign nations is acontroversial but legitimate gambit in international politics; supportingterrorists is not.Thus the February dossier was not, as had been implied by Downing Street, thesole work of the UK and US intelligence services. Indeed, some claimed that itwas little more than a ‘sexed-up’ set of hopeful but unsubstantiatedspeculations, designed and edited to support the US government’s drive towardswar.Faced with a still intransigent United Nations, the Blair government suddenlycame to the conclusion that UN backing was not necessary to legalize the attackon Iraq, so they willingly signed up British troops to the invasion. It isquestionable whether, given the political risks involved, even the hawkish BushWhite House would have invaded Iraq without British support.On 19 March 2003, America and Great Britain, backed by other nations in apitifully small ‘coalition of the willing’, went ahead and invaded Iraq.Fortunately the conscript Iraqi soldiers were keener to surrender than fight,and Saddam’s regime was all but destroyed within a month of the start of thewar. By 1 May, President Bush was confident enough to stage a major media photoopportunity aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln – anchored safelyaway from the combat zone near the coast of southern California. Clad in acombat pilot’s jumpsuit, Bush proudly announced victory, standing beneath abanner that read ‘MISSION ACCOMPLISHED’.In fact, as he spoke, fighting against pockets of Iraqi Army diehards was stillon-going, Saddam was still free, thousands of Islamic radicals across the worldwere preparing to go fight the infidel ‘crusaders’ in Iraq and, mostembarrassing, no evidence of the promised Iraqi weapons of mass destruction hademerged.On 22 May 2003, Dr David Kelly met with BBC reporter Andrew Gilligan at theCharing Cross Hotel in London. Gilligan was a correspondent for the BBC’sflagship radio news programme, Today, and had written and reported extensivelyon the war and its effect on Baghdad. Different parties have given differentreasons for the meeting. On the grounds that Dr Kelly, through his UN inspectionwork, had been intimately involved with Iraq and Baghdad over more than adecade, it has been reasonably suggested that he simply wanted to ask Gilliganjust how badly the city had fared in the recent war. It has also been suggestedthat Kelly was acting as the unofficial spokesman for various experts involvedin the search for the speculated Iraqi WMD, who felt that their opinions werebeing silenced or ignored by the government of Tony Blair. This latter theoryalso seems reasonable: Kelly was perhaps one of the few government expertseminent enough to risk contacting the media with little fear of damaging hiscareer.Born in Wales in 1944, Kelly received his doctorate in microbiology from OxfordUniversity in 1971. He won his reputation as a world-class expert on bio-warfareas head of the Defence Microbiology Division at Porton Down – the UK Ministry ofDefence germ warfare research laboratory. Retiring from that job, Dr Kellybecame an ad hoc advisor on bio warfare prevention to the Foreign Office, theBritish Secret Service and to any other UK government body that might need hisexpert knowledge. In 1989 Kelly was one of the key members of the internationalinspection team that confirmed the dismantling of the bio-warfare capacity ofthe former Soviet Union. It was this that led to his appointment as a seniorUnited Nations weapons inspector in Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War. Kelly’ssuccess in rooting out what there was of Iraq’s bio-warfare capacity led to his(unsuccessful) nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize. The British government alsoshowed its gratitude by making Dr Kelly a Companion of the Order of St Michaeland St George in 1996.In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Kelly had acted as an advisor tothe Defence Intelligence Staff – the body that assesses and disseminatesinformation collected by the various wings of the British state including, andespecially, the secret service. He had nothing to do with the compilation of thetwo dossiers on Iraqi WMD, but he was asked to proofread and comment on theSeptember 2002 dossier. He was apparently unhappy with certain claims in thedossier, especially the allegation that the Iraqis had the capacity to launchlong-range WMD missiles within 45 minutes of an alert.Part of Kelly’s job as an ad hoc advisor to the government was to liaise withthe media, so his meeting with Andrew Gilligan on 22 May was not unusual initself. It remains unclear exactly what was said at the meeting but a weeklater, on 29 May, Gilligan gave a report on the Today programme that infuriatedthe government.Gilligan said that his unnamed source had told him that the 45-minute claim hadbeen left in the dossier on the insistence of the 10 Downing Street PressOffice, despite the claim’s rather dubious provenance: in effect, that thedossier had been ‘sexed-up’ in an effort to make it more politically convincing.The government flatly denied any such political interference with anintelligence document, but must have known that such denials sounded distinctlyhollow. They angrily demanded that the BBC reveal the identity of Gilligan’sinformant. The BBC refused, pointing out that, since no law had been broken,their first duty was to protect their sources.The row went on, making daily headlines as government ministers and the BBCcontinued to assail each other with thinly veiled bitterness and hostility.Meanwhile, Dr Kelly admitted to a work colleague that he had met with AndrewGilligan without authorization, but insisted that he had not uttered thecontroversial words that Gilligan had quoted from the ‘unnamed source’. On 30June, with no end in sight to the war of words, Kelly went to his line managerand admitted his meeting with Gilligan.It was decided at cabinet level to announce that the government had discoveredthe identity of Gilligan’s source, but not to name Kelly or report him to thepolice. Even if Kelly had made the comment about the political manipulation ofthe dossiers, he was not liable to prosecution under the Official Secrets Act:since the government continued to insist that the claim was untrue, it thereforewasn’t an official secret. Kelly was only guilty of meeting with a journalistwithout first clearing the meeting with his line manager.In such cases it is standard Ministry of Defence practice to protect theiremployees’ identities from the media and, even if the press correctly guess anidentity, to reply ‘no comment’ to all enquiries. In the case of David Kelly,however, the moment that a journalist asked if Kelly was Gilligan’s source, theMoD immediately admitted that he was.Kelly, a quiet and shy man, appeared horrified by the MoD’s seeming abandonmentof him to the press pack. In response to shouted questions from journalists, hecontinued to insist that he could not have been Gilligan’s sole source becausehe had not said key things attributed to that source. And, of course, this wasexactly what the government wanted to hear. It discredited Gilligan with theimplication that he had ‘sexed-up’ Kelly’s interview about the ‘dodgy dossier’.On 15 July, Dr Kelly gave evidence to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee inthe House of Commons. He was clearly under stress and spoke so quietly that theair conditioning had to be turned off so the members of the committee could hearhim. He doggedly repeated his belief that he was not Gilligan’s source for the‘sexing-up’ claim, but seemed disconcerted by the forcefulness of some of thequestioning.Two days later David Kelly was dead and Tony Blair’s government was hurriedlyimplementing a damage-limitation exercise. A judicial enquiry into thecircumstances of Kelly’s death was announced and set to start on 1 August. Thishad the dual effect of stopping anyone, under British sub judice laws, makingpublic comments about the case and also meant that the coroner’s inquest intoKelly’s death was cancelled.Fear of breaching sub judice restrictions did not, however, apply to everyone.On 3 August, Tom Kelly – the prime minister’s spokesman and no relation to DavidKelly – caustically referred to Dr Kelly as a ‘Walter Mitty’ personality. WalterMitty is a character in a James Thurber comic short story who escapes his sadand unimportant life with an almost non-stop series of self-aggrandizingfantasies, played out in his head. The apparent intended implication was thatthe late Dr Kelly was a self-important fantasist, whose opinions and – moreimportantly – criticisms were uninformed and not to be taken too seriously. Thecomment caused a fresh storm, not least because everybody working in the samefield as Dr Kelly acknowledged him as a world-class expert – and many now cameforward to say so. Accused of blackening the name of a dead man, the Blairgovernment hurriedly disavowed the words of its own spokesman.David Kelly was buried on 6 August, his funeral accompanied by much publicregret and hand wringing by the very politicians who, it was later shown, hadthrown him to the media.The public judicial inquiry was led by Lord Brian Hutton, a senior judge on theverge of retirement. Hutton had recently been in the public eye when he led thecampaign that, unsuccessfully, sought to block the extradition of AugustoPinochet from Britain to Spain, where the former Chilean dictator faced chargesover the torture and murder of Spanish citizens.Lord Hutton extensively examined the circumstances of David Kelly’s death,including all of the available written material and police reports. He alsoquestioned anyone involved in the run-up to and aftermath of Kelly’s death. Theinquiry was followed closely by the media and the public, and most weresatisfied that it was at least making a thorough effort. Some feared, however,that a soon-to-retire establishment figure like Lord Hutton would be too open togovernment influence.The Hutton Inquiry Report was published on 28 January 2004, and turned out to bean almost complete exoneration of the government and a damning attack on theBBC. Hutton found that there was ‘no underhand [government] strategy’ to nameKelly as the source for Gilligan’s accusations. Furthermore, Andrew Gilligan’soriginal accusation of political interference with the construction of the WMDdossiers was condemned as ‘unfounded’, and the BBC’s editorial and managementprocesses that had allowed Gilligan to make the statement on live radio wereruled ‘defective’. The dossiers themselves had not been ‘sexed-up’, and theircontroversial content was, at worse, ‘subconsciously influenced’ by thegovernment’s political desires. Finally, Doctor David Kelly had committedsuicide; the implication being that he had been driven to the desperate act byexcessive pressure from the media. Hutton exonerated the Blair government of allblame in respect of Kelly’s death.The Hutton Report was so notably one-sided in its findings that many suspectedthat it was entirely a government whitewash. Even evidence within the reportitself threw some of Lord Hutton’s conclusions into question. For example, itwas plain that the wording of the February dossier had been substantiallyaltered to present the strongest possible case for war – why this did not countas political interference was a moot point.It is also clear in the Hutton Report that quite a few experts in theintelligence community felt that their reservations about the dossiers’ contentshad been ignored or overruled out-of-hand by Tony Blair’s government: even ifDavid Kelly hadn’t told Gilligan that Downing Street had interfered with theevidence, there were plenty of other unhappy experts who might have done so.But the fact was, from evidence given to Hutton, that David Kelly had directcontact with dissenters within the intelligence service and had apparently takenit upon himself to communicate their reservations to several journalists –sometimes using phrases very like the one that had caused the storm ofcontroversy in the first place. Andrew Gilligan just happened to be the firstjournalist to voice these concerns to the public, and now he had been thoroughlyslapped down by Lord Hutton for his trouble. Gilligan immediately resigned hisjob at the BBC under the cloud of the Hutton Report.Finally, and arguably most damningly, there is the clear statement in LordHutton’s report that the prime minister himself chaired the cabinet meeting atwhich it was decided that Dr Kelly’s name would be confirmed by the Ministry ofDefence, provided it was first put to them by a journalist. The cabinet musthave known that Kelly’s name was one that was bound to be suggested, so theirdecision could be seen as a particularly Machiavellian one: in effect, to giveKelly’s name to the press, but to do it via the Ministry of Defence pressoffice. They could thus keep the cabinet’s hands clean as far as the public wasconcerned.This flew directly in the face of Hutton’s conclusion that Kelly’s suicide wasin no way the fault of the government. Nobody questioned that the British presspack can be a ruthless pursuer and that Kelly had clearly hated being dissected,day after day, in the full gaze of the public. But it was Tony Blair, as chairof the meeting, who effectively stripped Kelly of his anonymity and set thejournalists after the shy scientist in the first place. It would seem to someobservers that if any one individual could be said to be to blame for knowinglyplacing David Kelly under excessive pressure, it was Tony Blair. However, LordHutton refused to see it that way.But did David Kelly commit suicide? Naturally, with such a controversial death,there are plenty of conspiracy theories in the air, and some odd facts seem topoint towards murder rather than to self-destruction. The ambulance crew calledto the scene of Kelly’s death later insisted that there wasn’t enough blood inevidence to have caused a man to die. Then, in a letter to the Guardiannewspaper on 27 January 2004, three eminent British doctors – David Halpin, C.Stephen Frost and Searle Sennett – insisted that the lone severing of the ulnarartery in Kelly’s wrist would almost certainly not be enough to cause a grownman to bleed to death – clotting of the blood would have sealed such a‘matchstick thick’ artery before death could occur.Then there is the key question as to Kelly’s mental state at the time of hisdeath. His wife admitted in her evidence to Hutton that Kelly had been depressedby recent events, and by the veiled threat from his superiors that, despite hiseminent expertise, he might be given the sack as an advisor to the government.It was also possible that he might lose his government pension if this happened.Others, with whom he was in e-mail contact just hours before his death, insistedthat David Kelly was more angry than depressed – feeling that he had beenbetrayed by his employers and threatening to strike back at them. Angry men arerarely prone to suicide; but ruthless governments have been known to assassinateangry would-be dissidents.Finally there is the matter of Kelly’s profound belief in the Bahá’í faith,which condemns suicide, and the fact that he, a family man, left no suicide noteto explain his decision; both facts that seem to undermine the official suicideexplanation.A popular conjecture is that Kelly was kidnapped as he went for his walk andthen fatally injured – perhaps poisoned – in some subtle way not discovered bythe coroner at the subsequent autopsy. Kelly’s unconscious and dying body wasthen taken to the woods on Harrowdown Hill and his wrist was cut before he diedto make it look like suicide. Such an assassination has secret service –British, American or Iraqi? – written all over it. But this theory is just aconjecture that is unlikely to be either proved or conclusively disprovedwithout further investigation.Because of the announcement of Lord Hutton’s inquiry, the coroner’s inquest intoDavid Kelly’s death came to a premature halt before it could arrive at aconclusion. Calls for the inquest to be reopened have been ignored.The consequences of the invasion of Iraq are perhaps so great and terrible thatthe death – suicide or murder – of a lone scientist is dwarfed into comparativeinsignificance by them. As of this writing, over 3,000 occupying Americanmilitary personnel have been killed by insurgents in Iraq. Over 120 Britishtroops have also died while serving in Iraq. As to the Iraqis, the casualtyfigures are horrific beyond imagination. In October 2006, the respected medicaljournal the Lancet published a study suggesting that over 650,000 Iraqis hadbeen killed since the invasion. Foreign insurgents – many either members oraffiliates of Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda network – repeatedly attack theoccupying forces and any Iraqi they deem to be aiding the ‘crusaders’. Car bombsin crowded streets and suicide attacks are taking place on a daily, sometimeshourly basis.Yet recent evidence suggests that many more victims – men, women and children –have been killed by native Iraqi death squads. Intent on random revenge forprevious sectarian killings, the Sunni Iraqis are turning on the Shi’a Iraqis,and Shi’a are killing the Sunnis. Many of these death squad victims are left inpublic places as an act of further provocation, and many show signs of havingbeen tortured before they were killed.Iraq seems to be collapsing into a particularly brutal civil war and theresponse of the Bush and Blair governments is to talk, reluctantly, aboutgetting their troops out of the country. At the same time, Afghanistan is alsosliding into chaos.Corruption in the NATO-backed Afghan government is admitted to be rife.Impoverished Afghan farmers are again growing vast amounts of poppies for theillegal heroin trade. Suicide bombers, insurgents and terrorists are killingcivilians and NATO troops alike. And there seems to be no NATO plan to improvethe situation . . . and no money if there was a plan. The billions that mighthave been spent on dragging Afghanistan out of this twenty-first-century DarkAge have instead been spent on the Iraq war.Before the invasion of Iraq, the Bush White House believed that the total costof the war and post-war operations would not top $20 billion – the White HouseChief Economic advisor had actually suggested a figure ten times as high, butthis estimate was ignored and the advisor was later removed from his post. As ofJanuary 2006, the US Congress had already appropriated $251 billion for theinvasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq.In the same year a study was published by the Nobel Prize-winning economistJoseph Stiglitz and Harvard Professor Linda Bilmes, presuming an eight-year USoccupation of Iraq, with troop numbers being gradually reduced after 2006. Theycalculated that the long-term cost to the USA alone (including medical care foran estimated 16,000 seriously wounded US military personnel) might be astaggering 1.2 trillion dollars. Such a cost would not only use up all the moneythat might have been ear-marked for Afghanistan, but might seriously endangerthe stability of the US economy itself.This state of corruption and social turmoil is strikingly similar to that leftafter the Soviets were forced to leave Afghanistan in the 1980s – a hellishnational collapse that allowed the Taliban (originally just a small group ofPakistani-schooled Koran students) to sweep to power. And now the once shatteredremnant of the Taliban are making a strong comeback in southern Afghanistan,determinedly fighting to retake power from the ‘infidels.’Both the US and UK governments now belatedly admit that there were no weapons ofmass destruction in Iraq, and probably never were. It is also clear, now that wehave access to the Hussein regime’s secret files, that the Iraqis were notsupporters of al-Qaeda. Saddam was a secular dictator, so he was hated by binLaden just as much as Saddam distrusted al-Qaeda – a point that was made by manyof Bush and Blair’s critics before the invasion of Iraq.The British and US governments blamed ‘intelligence failures’ for their mistakenbelief that there were ever WMD in Iraq – intelligence failures by theirspecialists and experts, a significant number of whom apparently begged them notto believe in Saddam Hussein’s phantom WMD arsenal. Both governments alsocontinue to deny the suggestion that they knew all along that Saddam was nothreat to them, but that they pretended that he was to provide an excuse toinvade Iraq.To support this stance, the Blair government points to the results of the 2004Butler Inquiry that looked into the government handling of intelligence materialin the run-up to the war. Lord Butler found that ‘more weight was placed on theintelligence than it would bear’ and that the intelligence services and theJoint Intelligence Committee had been under political pressures that made itdifficult for them to maintain ‘normal standards of neutral and objectiveassessment’. He also dismissed the infamous 45-minute claim, saying that itshould not have gone into either dossier on such weak supporting evidence. But,in the end, Lord Butler exonerated the Blair government of either bad faith ordishonesty over their stated belief that Iraq was a clear and present danger toUK interests.On 15 December 2006, the Independent newspaper had a scoop. It reported that theHouse of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee had uncovered certain evidence thathad been given to the Butler Inquiry in secret. This evidence had remainedundisclosed ever since under an Official Secrets Act seal, placed on it by theForeign Office. When the committee questioned the FO ruling, the government wasforced to admit that the material was not, strictly speaking, officially secret.The committee examined the evidence and then published it.It turned out to be a deposition made by Carne Ross, a former UK chiefnegotiator to the United Nations with a special brief to cover matters relatingto Iraq. Ross – who resigned his post in the summer of 2002 because of hisdisquiet over British policy – told Lord Butler plainly that he and those heworked with were left under no illusion that the Blair government did not reallybelieve that Iraq was a threat to the UK: ‘ . . . at no time did HMG [HerMajesty’s Government] assess that Iraq’s WMD – or any other capability – posed athreat to the UK or its interests.’In fact, Ross said, it was commonly if quietly agreed among British officials ofhis acquaintance that Saddam Hussein had been ‘effectively contained’ by thefirst Gulf War and subsequent UN sanctions.Of course, Carne Ross’s decision to abandon a high-flying diplomatic career,mainly because he had profound disagreements with the Blair government’s foreignpolicy, might have skewed his views, making him an unreliable witness. But, ifthat is so, why did the Foreign Office – and presumably the FO’s ministerialmasters – try to cover up Ross’s statement to the Butler Inquiry? And if Ross iseven partially correct in his recollections, then the Blair government is askingthe world to believe that, against a chorus of their own intelligence expertsand their own UN diplomatic corps, they still had no inkling that there were noWMD in Iraq and thus no excuse for war.The Blair and Bush governments also deny that the on-going war in Iraq hasgreatly strengthened the anti-West Islamic extremists, but this position hasalso become increasingly untenable for them. The evidence is clear that al-Qaedaand their fellow travellers are stronger now than they ever have been, bothmilitarily – with hordes of new recruits – and politically.A year after the Iraq invasion, Richard A. Clarke, the retired ChiefCounter-Terrorism Advisor to the White House (who served a key role during thecrisis of 9/11) commented in his memoir Against All Enemies: ‘Rather thanseeking to work with the majority in the Islamic world to mould Muslim opinionagainst the radicals’ values, we [the USA and allies] did exactly what al-Qaedasaid we would do: we invaded and occupied an oil-rich Arab country that posed nothreat to us.’ (Free Press, 2004).Britain and America could have done no better had they deliberately set out toappear to be stupid, bullying, anti-Islamic thugs to the eyes of moderateMuslims worldwide. The result is that increasing numbers of Muslims are lookingto the religious extremists for leadership.What if – as happened in 1979 in Iran – the unstable but key Western allies ofSaudi Arabia or Pakistan fall to reinvigorated theocratic revolutionary parties?And what if Iraq or Afghanistan emerges from their present troubles with aTaliban-style government? Those countries, together with Syria and Iran, mightform an anti-Western (possibly nuclear-armed) power block that would controlmost of the world’s remaining large oil fields.And what might Islamic fundamentalists do with such an economic stranglehold onthe West? Two possibilities suggest themselves. They could push oil pricesthrough the roof to enrich themselves and cripple our economies – just as theOPEC nations did in the 1970s to protest the West’s support of Israel: a partialembargo that created a worldwide recession. Or they could simply turn off thetaps and let our economic and social infrastructures collapse for want of theoil to transport or provide essential resources; resources like electricity,food and clean water. Which course would Osama bin Laden – or state leaderssharing his Jihadist beliefs – take?But the US-UK invasion of Iraq has created more immediate worries. Thesubsequent strengthening of Islamic terror groups worldwide has increased therisk that one such group might get their hands on a ‘black market’ weapon ofmass destruction. In that case, the loss of a top WMD expert like Dr David Kellymight yet carry an incalculable cost for the world.Whatever Dr Kelly’s position was in the run-up and immediate aftermath of theinvasion of Iraq, he seems to have had no illusions about the dangerous forcesthat surrounded him. Foreign Office mandarin David Broucher told the Huttoninquiry about a conversation he had had with Kelly in Geneva in February 2003.As they parted Broucher had asked Kelly what he thought would happen if Iraq wasinvaded. Kelly, in a seemingly throwaway remark, said ‘I will probably be founddead in the woods.’"},{"pageContent":"KENNEDY, JACKALL THE PRESIDENT’S WOMENDURING HIS POLITICAL career – spanning the late 1940s, the prudish 50s and thepre-hippy years of the 1960s – John F. Kennedy pursued a sex life that wouldmake most of us dizzy to contemplate.Protected and covered up for by friends and colleagues, tactfully ignored by amore gentlemanly (not to say timorous) media, and almost unassailably popularwith his supporters, he indulged himself with almost every attractive woman whoshowed willing – and there were plenty of those for the glamorous Jack Kennedy.Nobody has ever tried to put a figure to his conquests, but these must have beenwell into the upper hundreds.In his book, Kennedy and His Women, Tony Sciacca records numerous accounts ofKennedy’s philandering from those close to him throughout his political career.Reading the anecdotes one soon forms an impression that Jack Kennedy must haveviewed attractive women in the same light that a voracious reader might considerpaperbacks. He clearly needed a continuous and ever-changing supply of lovers,yet he seems to have viewed sex more as a relaxing and necessary pastime thanthe driving force of his life.However, this did not stop him from allowing his sex drive occasionally toimpinge on his political life. He often spent pleasant afternoons (when his wifeJackie was away) bathing naked in the White House swimming pool with whateveryoung lady or ladies he presently had attached to his entourage. Hassledpresidential aides had a lively time stopping uninitiated ministers anddiplomats wandering round to the pool to have a quick word with Mr President.Richard Nixon, a US president with a very different set of vices, later had thepool filled in and turned into the White House pressroom. Televised presidentialstatements are now given in exactly the same space where President Kennedy onceenjoyed aquatic philanderings.During the 1962 Nassau conference Kennedy shocked the British Prime Minister,Harold Macmillan, by offhandedly saying: ‘You know, I get very severe headachesif I go too long without a woman.’ He then excused himself and left with twoattractive members of his personal staff, who up to then had seemed to fulfil nospecific purpose. An hour later he returned alone, looking much refreshed.Smiling, he told the mildly indignant Prime Minister: ‘My headache’s gone.’Life as a Kennedy White House staffer could be both hectic and demanding. Thesecret service men seconded to protect the president were given the additionalduty of unobtrusively sneaking in his girlfriends on demand. Presidential aidesoften had to rush about tidying up the evidence of the president’s visitors whenMrs Kennedy’s arrival was unexpectedly announced. Hairpins were searched for inthick carpets, beds were rapidly remade and the odd female garment swiftlyrelocated.On one occasion they were a bit lax in their efforts and Jackie Kennedy found apair of panties stuffed into a pillowcase. She calmly handed them to her husbandsaying, ‘Would you please shop around and see who these belong to? They’re notmy size.’It seems clear that Jackie knew about at least some of the other women, butaside from creating a slight distancing from her husband, she did not let itspoil their marriage. One has to respect her fortitude; she not only had to putup with the arduous life of the first lady, but also had to contend with thefact that her husband was totally incapable of being faithful to her.In contrast to contemporary American politicians, Kennedy seems to have beentotally unconcerned that his enemies might use his private life to wreck hiscareer. In 1952, during his first campaign to enter the Senate, a photograph ofKennedy and a young lady lying naked on a sun-drenched beach came into the handsof his Republican opponent, Henry Cabot Lodge. Instead of handing it straight tothe media, Lodge had a copy of the photograph sent to Kennedy’s campaignheadquarters, where it caused quite a stir.Kennedy’s campaign strategists examined the photograph and despaired; it lookedlike the end of his electoral chances and possibly his entire political career.It was decided that Kennedy must be informed of the situation and severalunhappy aides took the photograph to his office. One later said that Kennedy‘just looked at the picture a long time and then told us about all the greattimes he had had with the girl and how fond he’d been of her. He put it in hisdesk and told us not to worry about it.’ Lodge didn’t publish the photograph,perhaps merely hoping to shake his opponent’s confidence, and Kennedy won theelection easily.A fellow congressman who attended an informal dinner party thrown by JackKennedy at his Washington house in 1948, relates another example of Kennedy’spredatory attitude to women. Also present were several of Kennedy’s Navy friendsfrom his war service days and an attractive redhead from an airline ticketoffice that Kennedy had casually asked along.She noticed that he was not eating and asked him why. Kennedy replied: ‘How canI eat when all I’m thinking about is taking you upstairs?’ She replied that shewasn’t hungry either and they excused themselves and went upstairs.Later they all went to the movies after which Kennedy packed his date off in acab. As soon as she was gone he called another young lady. He said he had mether a few weeks before at Palm Beach, and had offered to show her the sights ofWashington. They picked her up at her hotel and drove back to Kennedy’s house.After a brandy nightcap, the congressman and his date tactfully left.The next day the congressman met Kennedy on Capitol Hill and asked how thingshad gone. Kennedy said he had had a terrible time. His new date seemed to havethought that ‘after one screw with Jack Kennedy she was going to marry him.’ Shehad finally stormed out at about two in the morning. ‘Then he turned and wavedtoward some real luscious woman sitting up in the House gallery. And hestage-whispered to me: “She’s the one I spent the night with.” Jack wasn’tbragging. To him, it was all very casual, something that a bachelor had comingto him . . . I tell you, I was awfully jealous of that man. The women seemed tobe coming out of the woodwork . . .’This detachment seems to have characterized Kennedy’s dealings with women. Yet,despite the modern view of Don Juanism, his womanizing almost certainly did notspring from a contempt for the female sex. Even his detractors admit that heinvariably behaved with courtesy and tact in his love affairs and, as can beseen above, he was at pains to avoid giving the impression that he took peoplefor granted.Although most of Kennedy’s affairs were short term – as little as a couple ofhours in some cases – he also maintained a few longer-lasting relationships –the most notorious perhaps being with the two iconic goddesses Marilyn Monroeand Jayne Mansfield. His basic good nature was again illustrated by his conductin these affairs. He would go to elaborate lengths to ensure that the lady wasprotected from press difficulties while being almost cavalier with his ownreputation.At the beginning of World War II, Kennedy was stationed in Washington, workingin the Office of Navy Intelligence. Captain Alan Kirk, director of the ONI, wasan old family friend, and Jack’s father, Joe Kennedy – then Ambassador to GreatBritain – had pulled strings to get his boy a plum job. Yet by January 1942,Jack had been kicked out of Naval Intelligence and sent to a minor desk job inSouth Carolina. The reason was Inga Arvad, a gorgeous Danish journalist whomAdolf Hitler had once described as ‘a perfect Nordic beauty’.Inga had come from Europe with her pro-Nazi husband, had left him for asuspected pro-Nazi and had eventually ended up working on the WashingtonTimes-Herald on a society column, through which she met Jack. The FBI alreadysaw her as a potential Mata Hari and her involvement with a young intelligenceofficer in a key position decided them. They bugged her telephone and had herkept under surveillance.Meanwhile, great pressure was placed on Jack – by the Navy and his father – tobreak with Inga, but he remained intransigent. His lover was not, he insisted, aNazi spy – she had told him so herself. Indeed, rather than meekly surrender,Kennedy then went on the offensive to save his girlfriend’s reputation.He eventually pulled enough strings to receive an interview with FBI director J.Edgar Hoover himself. Hoover was forced to admit that there was absolutely noevidence against Inga and apologized on behalf of the Bureau. Jack Kennedy, atthe age of 25, with the mere rank of Navy Ensign, had faced down one of the mostpowerful men in the country to protect the reputation of his lover.Hoover must have recalled the Inga Arvad incident with some irony when he washanded a report, late in 1961, on Judith Campbell. It seemed that Judy, as shewas known to her friends, had been ringing the White House to speak with thepresident. Hoover was, of course, well aware of Jack Kennedy’s affairs. Theprudish bureau chief – himself a secret homosexual and transvestite – wasobsessed by the need to gather information about the sex lives of the famous andpowerful. He can have had little doubt about the nature of the attractive MissCampbell’s connection with the president. The trouble was that the FBI also hadinformation that she was a lover of Sam Giancana, one of the most powerful Mafiabosses in the United States.Kennedy had met Judy in February 1960, at a party thrown by his friend andsupporter Frank Sinatra. She was one of Hollywood’s many aspiring actresses andwas also known as something of a ‘party girl’ – a facet that endeared her to thehard-playing Sinatra and his circle.Jack and Judy soon became lovers and saw each other fairly frequently over thenext two years. Judy later claimed that he rang her often and that she hadvisited him at the White House at least twenty times for intimate lunches. Shecalled him quite often as well. The White House telephone logs recorded seventycalls from Judy Campbell during a 54-week period in 1961 and early 1962. Some ofthose calls were made from a house in Oak Park, Illinois: the home of mobsterSam Giancana.Whether Giancana was using Judy to get a blackmail angle on Kennedy has neverbeen made clear, but he certainly must have known that he was sharing hisgirlfriend with the president. Once, when Judy was staying with Giancana in theluxurious Miami Beach Hotel, Kennedy got word to her that he was vacationingalone at Palm Springs and would appreciate a little female company. Apparentlywith Giancana’s blessings she left to join the president immediately.J. Edgar Hoover contacted Bobby Kennedy, Jack’s younger brother, then serving asAttorney General. Bobby Kennedy had a particular hatred for organized crime andhad personally insisted on the multi-level FBI surveillance on Sam Giancana.(Ironically this operation took place against the wishes of Hoover, who insisted– against all available evidence – that there was no organized crime inAmerica.) First Bobby, then J. Edgar Hoover remonstrated with the president andhe was finally persuaded to stop Judy ringing him at the White House. Even so,he continued to see her until the summer of 1962.It may seem insanely foolish of Kennedy to have continued such a dangerousaffair once he had been appraised of the facts, but on closer inspection onerealizes that it was yet another illustration of his cool political insight. Hehad no intention of breaking off an enjoyable relationship and he knew thatGiancana could not harm him; in fact, quite the opposite. One of his formeraides later commented on the affair: ‘Back in those days no reporter in thecountry would have touched the Judy Campbell story, no one would have believedJack was screwing around and certainly not with a mobster’s woman. If it got outin any way, we would have just said that it’s a vicious tale spread by amurderer from Chicago named Giancana because the Kennedy Administration isseriously damaging the mob. We could have easily turned it into a plus for Jack.And Jack knew it.’Various psychological explanations for Jack Kennedy’s womanizing have beenoffered over the years, one of the most frequent being that he was trying tolive up to his father. Old Joe Kennedy Senior was one of the great Americanentrepreneurs in every sense of the word. He made a huge fortune from the stockmarket, from the movie business and, it is alleged, the bootlegging trade duringProhibition. Joe Kennedy nursed a lifelong chip on his shoulder over hisfamily’s exclusion from the East Coast ‘Brahmin’ upper-class circles, due totheir Irish background. As a result he was as aggressive in his sexual affairsand home life as he was in the business and political worlds, and encouraged hisboys to behave in the same way. Jack Kennedy, frequently ill during his earlyyears, is known to have felt inadequate compared to his father’s demands andspent much of his youth fighting with his father’s favourite, Jack’s elderbrother, Joe.During World War II, two events seem to have deeply marked Jack. The first washis own near death when a Japanese destroyer rammed his small ‘PT’ patrol boat.Jack’s backbone was badly damaged when the enemy destroyer ploughed over andsank the little patrol boat, but he managed to assemble his crew in the waterand swam with them to a nearby island. Despite his agonizing back injury, hethen swam out into the strait every night until he managed to flag down anotherUS patrol boat to rescue them.Kennedy was cited for conspicuous bravery, but was virtually crippled. Shortlyafter the war his doctors informed him that there was a revolutionary newoperation that might help him, but that his survival chances during theprocedure were at best 50–50. He immediately insisted on going through with itand, of course, survived. However, he was forced to wear a support corset forthe rest of his life and, despite his Herculean taste for women, had to makelove with considerable caution.The second event to deeply affect the generally carefree Jack, was the death ofhis older brother Joe, on a volunteer-only bomber mission against a German V-1missile base in northern France in 1944. Afterwards, Joe Senior’s ruthlessdetermination to put at least one of his sons in the White House settled on Jack– who up to then had shown little intention of a political career.Moreover, both these events seem to have caused Kennedy to be driven by thecertainty of his own death and a determination to live life to its full. Indeed,his very poor state of health throughout his life actually seems to havereinforced this drive. He once admitted to a colleague, ‘The doctors say I’vegot a sort of slow-motion leukaemia, but they tell me I’ll probably last untilI’m 45.’In this light one can see that Kennedy’s hyperactive sex life was only part ofthe picture. Everything he did, including his successful run for the presidency,was part of his need to enjoy and excel in life. In his eulogy after the Dallasassassination, Bobby Kennedy pointed out that at least half of Jack’s days hadbeen spent in agony due to his poor health, yet he was one of the most fulfilledpeople that he had ever known.Jack Kennedy was 46 years old when he was assassinated in Dallas, in 1963."},{"pageContent":"LAW, JOHNTHE LOUISIANA SCANDALJOHN LAW WAS a Scots adventurer whose brilliant but overambitious financialschemes brought France to ruin. He was born in Edinburgh in April 1671, the sonof a goldsmith who made a fortune from moneylending. As a child, Law developedinto a remarkable linguist and mathematician. He was tall, handsome and hadenormous charm. His father died in 1685, leaving him two country estates. ButLaw’s temperament was unsuited to country life; he wanted excitement andadventure. Besides, he was a born gambler. In London, he had a love affair witha certain Mrs Lawrence and fought a duel with another of her admirers, a mancalled Beau Wilson whom he killed in Bloomsbury Square. He was convicted ofmurder but managed to secure a royal pardon. But then Wilson’s brother filed asuit against him and he was imprisoned; he escaped and fled to the Continent. Hewas 26 years old.John Law was a gambler but he was fascinated by high finance, believing that itcould be turned into a science. He studied banking in Amsterdam – then thefinancial centre of the world – and later in Venice. In 1700, he returned toScotland and approached the government with a proposal which, he said, wouldrelieve the poverty of the Scots. He proposed that a national bank should befounded and it should issue paper money instead of gold. This money was alwaysto be instantly redeemable against gold in order to create confidence. Onceconfidence had been created, the government could then increase its wealthsimply by printing more money. Nowadays, we are aware that this procedurecreates an inflationary spiral but to Law, it seemed foolproof. The Scotsdeclined to try the scheme. And since a union with England was imminent, Law hadto return to the Continent to avoid arrest. There he continued to live bygambling – being periodically moved on by the police as dejected losers reportedtheir suspicion that he was cheating. He was also staggeringly successful inlove in spite of the fact that he was married to the Earl of Banbury’s daughterCatherine.He continued to try to interest influential politicians in his scheme for anational bank without success. King Victor Amadeus of Sardinia told him, ‘I amnot wealthy enough to survive bankruptcy.’In Paris in 1708, he was received into the innermost circles of the aristocracyand his skill – and luck – as a gambler became legendary. He ran a faro bank inthe house of a famous actress, Madame Duclos, and had private counters made,each worth eighteen louis. There he met a man who took an immediate liking tohim: the Duc D’Orleans. The duke was soon convinced that Law was a financialgenius; he introduced Law to the Minister of Finance, Desmarets. Just as itseemed that the long-awaited turn in his fortunes had arrived, the Chief ofPolice, D’Argenson, ordered Law out of the country. Presumably D’Argenson musthave had some evidence of illegal dealings otherwise Law could have appealed tohis influential friends to countermand the order. As it was, he left France andspent the next five years travelling from capital to capital around Europe andamassing a fortune of £80,000 by gambling.When he heard that Louis XIV had died in 1715 and that the Duc d’Orleans hadbecome regent (Louis XV being only five years old at the time), Law hastenedback to Paris. He found that France was on the verge of bankruptcy, largely dueto the extravagance of the ‘Sun King’. Money, Law told the Duke, was thelifeblood of a country and credit is to business what the brain is to the humanbody. If a sound system of credit could be established, a merchant could embarkon schemes that would normally be far too ambitious for his pocket. In this way,business would be stimulated and wealth increased.The Regent was impressed but the Council of Finance was not and rejected theidea of a national bank. They agreed, however, to allow Law to set up a privatebank. This he did, using his capital to start a bank in the Place Vendôme inParis. His aim was to establish confidence. He sold shares in the bank at aprice that attracted everyone who knew anything about finance: a quarter in goldand the rest in government bonds which were worth only one-fifth of their facevalue. At first, he lost money heavily but he created confidence. The governmentwas impressed when he devised a dubious scheme which enabled it to make a 50 percent profit on all bonds.Law’s problem was that he had issued 60 million’s worth of francs in notes andhe only had 6 million francs in gold. If confidence ebbed, he would be bankrupt.He needed to find ways of increasing his capital until he could withstand any‘run’ on the bank – some business that would expand and yield rich profits. Hedecided that the answer lay across the Atlantic, in Louisiana, which had been‘discovered’ by the French. A businessman named Crozat had been granted amonopoly, but was finding that he lacked the capital to take advantage of it.Law persuaded the Duc to transfer the monopoly to him; Crozat seems to have beenglad to get rid of it. From August 1717 Law’s company became known as theMississippi Company. It owned a piece of land 3,000 miles long and the companycould plant colonies and develop it as it liked.Law’s first step was to organize ‘propaganda’. He sent his agents all over thecountry, telling tales of the immense riches of the Mississippi basin, includingwhole rocks made of emeralds. He imported six dusky maidens from Louisiana andshowed them off in Paris; one of them, who was described as the ‘Daughter of theSun’, was married to a French sergeant with enormous publicity and the mansailed off to America with his royal bride. (Unfortunately, she exercised herroyal prerogative of executing any husband who failed to please her and themarriage lasted only a few months.) The foundations of New Orleans were laid;Law himself started a German reservation in Arkansas. But there were still notenough colonists to provide the quick returns he wanted. Law took advantage ofhis privilege to raise his own troops – they were dressed in blue and silver andknown as Law’s Archers – and sent them round Paris collecting vagrants,ex-convicts and women of the streets, and packing them off to Louisiana. Whenhis troops began seizing ordinary men and women in the streets, there wereriots; twenty Archers were killed, and the government hastily decided thatpowers of recruitment should be confined to criminals.In spite of these setbacks, things looked promising. Law had been granted amonopoly of the Canadian fur trade and his profits were immense. He began toabsorb other French colonial companies in the East Indies, China, Senegal andother regions. He even acquired a tobacco monopoly in Virginia.For years, Law had been plotting to get his own back on the police chiefD’Argenson for ordering him out of the country. In fact, he had made D’Argensonone of his chief lieutenants, to keep him out of mischief. In 1719, Law struck.D’Argenson and some business associates had made enormous profits by purchasingthe right to collect taxes – the French government preferred ready cash.D’Argenson’s group paid 48 million francs for this privilege. In 1719, Lawstepped in and offered 52 million – one of D’Argenson’s chief sources of incomesuddenly dried up.Law now launched his biggest gamble of all. He offered to pay the national debt(the money the government borrows from various sources). The idea was that hewould pay the government the sum of 1,500 million livres to enable it to repayall its creditors. The government in turn would pay Law a 3 per cent interest onhis money instead of the usual 4 per cent. And what would the creditors do withthe money that had been returned to them? They could reinvest it in Law’scompany. And Law guaranteed that he would repurchase at their original value insix months if the investors wanted to ‘unload’.Law’s office in the Rue Qincampoix suddenly became the centre of a permanentscramble. In less than a year – between June 1719 and February 1720 – his sharesincreased eighteen times in value. Crowds packed the street and tried to pushtheir way to the desk where Law sat with a huge pile of shares in front of him.Anyone who could buy a few shares could walk outside and immediately sell themfor several times what he had paid. Every house or shop in the dingy streetrented rooms at thousands of francs a week to people who wanted to be outsidethe door the moment Law opened up in the morning. A poor cobbler made a fortuneovernight; Law’s own coachman became a rich man, and came to his master with twomore coachmen, saying, ‘Choose which one you want and I’ll take the other.’No one quite understood how money could be created so quickly, but it wasobvious that Law had some secret. The result was a kind of frenzy. All over thecountry, the crime rate soared as people scrambled to lay their hands on thegold that could be doubled or trebled overnight. A young nobleman, the Comte deHorn, related to the Regent, lured a speculator to a house, and beat him todeath to lay his hands on 150,000 francs the man had just made. He was broken onthe wheel as an example but this example made no difference to the crime wave.Shrewd speculators realized that the bubble was bound to burst and begansmuggling their profits out of the country. One Dutch financier converted amillion francs into gold and silver and smuggled it out in farm carts coveredwith hay; he himself dressed as a farm labourer. The word ‘millionaire’ wascoined to describe a phenomenon that was becoming increasingly common.It was the people without wealth enough even to buy one share who suffered.Prices rose because most people had more money to spend while the poor could notafford the new prices. Law was causing mass starvation as well as crime.His greatest problem was that speculators were bound to decide to take theirprofit while the going was good and every time this happened, it drained thebank’s capital. Law persuaded the Regent to make it illegal for anyone topossess more than 500 livres in gold and silver. Goldsmiths were ordered not tomake any gold articles that weighed more than one ounce. But this only increasedthe general anxiety to turn their paper money into gold. The Prince de Contibrought carts to carry away his gold. Law was forced to issue a statement sayingthat he would not change more than a 100-livre note per person. He issued anedict threatening shopkeepers who refused to accept his notes; they ignored it.There were still crowds outside Law’s bank but they no longer had the samepurpose; they wanted their money back. On 17 July 1720, a huge crowd waited allnight – 15,000 of them. By morning, it was discovered that sixteen people haddied of suffocation. A mob marched to the Palais Royal, carrying four of thedead on stretchers, to show the Regent what his policies had led to; they werefinally persuaded to disperse. But revolution had been very close.Law hid in the Palais Royal for ten days then escaped to one of his countryhouses. His family was taken under the protection of the Duc de Bourbon at hishouse at St Maur. Law was in a state of shock; he found it incomprehensible thatthe tremendous edifice had collapsed and seemed unable to understand what hadgone wrong. He was still hoping that the Regent could save his bank with a hugeloan but the French parliament flatly refused a loan. On 21 December 1720, Lawfinally left for Brussels in a post chaise. He had a shock at Valenciennes whenhe was arrested by the son of his old enemy D’Argenson, for if, as he suspected,the Regent had been deposed, then he would probably never escape from Francealive. But within a few days, an order arrived from the Regent allowing him toproceed on his way.In Brussels, he was approached by an agent of the Tsar of Russia, Peter theGreat, who wanted him to take over the financial reorganization of the Russianempire. Law politely declined on the grounds that he needed a rest from hislabours – in fact, his nerve was shattered.In the following year, 1771, he journeyed to London and was received by KingGeorge I (who finally granted him his pardon). The news that he had beenvirtually the Prime Minister of France made the British decide that he deservedtreating with respect. No one held it against him that it was his example thathad led to England’s greatest social disaster of the century, the South SeaBubble, which had left thousands bankrupt.Law continued to be on good terms with the Regent – in fact, he received apension from him. When he asked in a letter: ‘What did you do about thebankruptcy?’ the Regent replied: ‘I disposed of it by simply making a bonfire ofall the documents.’ Law hoped to be recalled to France to take charge of itsfinances but the death of the Regent in 1723 dashed his hopes. He was separatedfrom his wife but her relatives gave him a small allowance. And he made a smallfortune by offering to bet anyone £1,000 to a shilling that they could not throwsix double sixes in succession with dice; the number who tried was incredible.Law moved to Venice where he died on 21 March 1729, aged 58.Napoleon later sold Louisiana to the Americans for $15 million."},{"pageContent":"MCKINNEY, JOYCETHE CASE OF THE MANACLED MORMONFROM A BRITISH tabloid journalist’s point of view, the 1977 case of thekidnapped Mormon missionary had everything: religion, obsession, conspiracy,sex, bondage, true love and a beautiful (and apparently maidenly) young womanwho was supposedly the perpetrator, not the victim, of an abduction and a sexualassault. Short of the involvement of the Loch Ness Monster, the story could nothave been better front-page material.The first official suggestion of scandal came on 15 September, when ScotlandYard officers announced that a visiting Mormon minister – 21-year-old KirkAnderson from the town of Provo in Utah – had apparently been abducted theprevious day from outside his church in East Ewell, near Epsom (south ofLondon). The Yard’s news bureau told pressmen that Anderson had been lured intoa car, then, out of the sight of witnesses, had apparently been overpowered andabducted. Although there was no known motive and no ransom demand, the policeviewed the matter very seriously.The investigators’ only lead was that a mustachioed young man calling himselfBob Bosler seemed to be at least part-responsible. This Bosler was evidently astranger to Kirk Anderson, but had telephoned him several days before, asking tobe schooled in, and hopefully accepted into, the Church of Jesus Christ of theLatter-Day Saints (a.k.a. the Mormons).Anderson’s fellow missionary and roommate, 21-year-old Kimball Smith, had gonewith him on the morning of Wednesday 14 September to meet with Bosler; Mormonmissionaries always travel in pairs to provide spiritual support to each other(and also to help each other avoid sinful temptations). Bob Bosler had pulled upat the front of the East Ewell Mormon Church in his car, got out and had chattedpleasantly with both the young missionaries. He had then asked Anderson to getinto the car with him to point out the way to the local Mormon headquarters on aroad map he had there.Had this request come from a woman, Anderson would have undoubtedly refused.However – perhaps lulled by the fact that Bosler, judging from his accent, wasalso an American – Anderson willingly accompanied his would-be convert to theparking area.Moments after both had got into the vehicle (and were out of Kimball Smith’sview) it suddenly sped away, leaving Smith wondering what was going on.Eventually, when they did not return, he realized that his fellow missionary hadbeen snatched away and reported the matter to his superiors. They called thepolice.The investigating officers did not say so directly to the press, but the spateof political kidnappings in recent years by terrorist groups like the IRA, thecommunist Baader-Meinhof gang and the Palestine Liberation Organization musthave meant that the unexplained abduction of an American citizen on British soilwas automatically a cause of concern in high places. All ports and airports werebeing monitored, in case there was an attempt to smuggle Anderson out of thecountry, and officers were also looking into the possibility that somebody witha grudge against the Mormon Church might be responsible.Nevertheless, most British newspapers paid the case little or no heed – at mostgiving it a paragraph or two on an inner page. The whole thing sounded too muchlike either a student prank or some sort of petty internal dispute in theodd-sounding foreign religion.The Church of the Latter Day Saints originated on a small farm outside Palmyra,New York State, in the 1820s. A farmer’s son, Joseph Smith Jr, claimed to havebeen visited by visions of both Jesus and God the Father, and that it had beenrevealed to him that all the present human religions were false. Later, in 1827,Joseph was further visited by an angel called Moroni – actually the spirit ofthe last member of the Lost Tribes of Israel – who commanded him to dig into alocal hillside. There Joseph found a number of inscribed golden tablets and twomagical stones set into a silver frame like a pair of opaque eyeglasses.Angel Moroni told Smith that on no account was anybody else to see these holyitems, but that he could borrow them to transcribe the story written on thegolden tablets. Fortunately the magic stones allowed Smith to translate thearchaic writing on the plates (said to be ‘Reformed Egyptian’) but he neededsomeone to take down what he read, so he enlisted the help of a literateneighbour called Martin Harris. To hide the gold plates and the magic glassesfrom the sight of Harris, Joseph is said to have sat under a blanket and shoutedthe translation out to his friend who, in turn, transcribed every word.The result was the Book of Mormon (titled in honour of the rather unfortunatelynamed angel, Moroni). It tells of how a lost tribe of Israel crossed theAtlantic and settled in America several thousand years ago. Due to God’s curse,this people split into three skin colours – white, red and black. The evil reds(later to be called Native Americans) eventually wiped out the equally evilblacks and the saintly whites, but not before Jesus of Nazareth had paid thewhite tribe a proselytizing visit. The Christian faith of the extinct whitetribe was the only true religion in the world, and it now fell upon Joseph Smithto revive it.Modern, non-Mormon readers might think that this sounds like a racist sciencefiction story, and they would not be alone: when the Book of Mormon was firstpublished in 1830, most critics reviled it as a particularly feeble piece offantasy fiction masquerading as the Holy Writ. Some even suggested that Smithhad stolen the entire plot from a recently deceased New York clergyman, SolomonSpaulding, who had written a similar story as fiction, but had not bothered toget it published.However, despite the almost universally negative reception the Book of Mormonreceived in East Coast intellectual circles, a good number of poorer New Yorkerswere drawn to the new religion. 1830s America was undergoing what was latercalled the Religious Fever, and many new (usually neo-Christian and Apocalyptic)religions sprang up in that decade – although few have survived to the presentday.Finding that he had a talent for outdoor preaching and mass conversions, Smithand his followers headed for the western states (then reaching no further thanIllinois in the Midwest): converts were much easier to find on the wild frontierwhere life was brutal and usually short, and thoughts of the hereafter wereconsequently on most people’s minds. Unfortunately, Smith’s abrasive style and –later on – his insistence that he and the twelve members of the Mormon rulingcouncil had a special dispensation from God to take as many wives as they liked,shocked and infuriated whole communities of non-Mormons as the self-styled‘Saints’ travelled westward.The Prophet Smith, as his followers called him, was shot dead by an Illinoislynch mob in 1844 – leaving 27 widows. He was replaced as Mormon leader by theequally forceful Brigham Young.Aside from winning new converts, the Saints, now numbered in thousands, sought aplace to settle and start a religious community. Young decided that, in the faceof local hostility, it was a time for the sword rather than the ploughshare, andwaged what amounted to a religious guerrilla war on the unbelievers of Illinois.However, he and his people were eventually driven west, into the wilderness.They crossed the Rocky Mountains and, after appalling hardships, arrived on thedesert-like Utah plateau. Most people would have given up and died in the faceof such a brutal existence and such hostile geography but, with Herculeanefforts, the Mormons irrigated the region around the great central salt lake andbuilt a municipality there: the pragmatically named Salt Lake City.Brigham Young rewarded his followers by consenting – with God’s permission – tothe spread of multiple spouse-taking (polygamy) to all male Mormons. In fact,this was arguably something of a necessity, as the Saints then had rather morewomen than men in their surviving population.Utah was blocked from joining the United States for many years, because theMormon practice of polygamy was illegal under US law. Fortunately in 1890 – justas the US Congress was about to pass a law that would impose a crushing economicblockade on Utah – President Wilford Woodruff (Smith’s third successor to theMormon leadership) was granted a vision from the Lord.Henceforth, Woodruff announced, polygamy was an abomination in the eyes of theLord, and any Mormon who had more than one wife was to be ejected from theMormon fellowship. The only exception to this rule was to be himself and his ownharem of wives. Utah was thus allowed to join the United States, but theunbelievers in the federal government eventually prosecuted Woodruff, forcinghim to give up all but one of his wives.From this controversial start, Mormonism soon settled into being one of the mostrespectable religious communities in the world. Mormon towns are generallypictures of order and neighbourliness, where habits of respectable dress,general abstinence and moral rectitude are expected of all citizens, old oryoung. Polygamy does still take place here and there, but almost always insecret and usually in the more out-of-the-way parts of America’s vast outback.Mormons live under a strict religious infrastructure: sin is dealt with harshlyby more senior Mormons (Smith refused to initiate a priest caste) and tithes of10 per cent of a believer’s income (before tax) are demanded on a yearly basis.This may seem a rather austere lifestyle in modern, hedonistic America but, onthe other hand, any Mormon in trouble – spiritual or financial – can always turnto fellow Mormons and the hierarchy of the Church of the Latter Day Saints forhelp and support.Male Mormons in their early twenties are encouraged to go abroad as missionaries– struggling to convert heathens to Mormonism and living as respectably as theywould at home. They are forbidden alcohol and drinks containing caffeine, wearrespectable suits (whatever the weather) and – as noted above – are strictlyprohibited any but the most blameless contact with women. Any white person is apotential convert but, up until recently, non-whites (especially NativeAmericans and blacks) were not welcome in the Church of the Latter Day Saints. Amissionary’s only rewards for this often fruitless and frustrating work are aswifter advancement in the church hierarchy in later life and a better chance ofachieving eternal reward after death.Male Mormons believe that they do not simply go to Heaven when they die – theybecome gods themselves and go on to create life in a new star system (Adam isthe same as God the Father in the Mormon creed). Female Mormons, however, do notbecome goddesses unless they are married to a worthy Mormon; this allows them tobe spiritually piggy-backed to a lesser form of deity as the ‘celestial partner’of the husband.Faithful Mormons look upon sex before marriage, homosexuality and adultery withparticular repugnance. These ‘ungodly acts’ specifically undermine heterosexualmarriage – one of the principal elements of what a Mormon believes leads to ahappy life after death. As we will see, the taboo on premarital sex was to provean important factor in the events that led to the kidnapping of Kirk Anderson in1977.Kirk reappeared on Saturday, 17 September, just over three days after hisdisappearance from East Ewell. He was physically unhurt and had apparently beenfreed and returned to his lodgings in Epsom without a ransom being paid or evendemanded. Nevertheless, he insisted that he had been kidnapped.A news story that breaks on a Saturday is a godsend to the Sunday newspapers –who generally find themselves picking over the old news of the previous week andrarely getting good scoops – so the return of the Mormon missionary kidnapee wasnow enthusiastically followed up by the press, even though the public remainedlargely unaware that he had even been missing. All the Sunday papers sentreporters to Epsom Police Station to get an official statement and were theremet by Richard Eyre, director of the southern region of the Mormon Church inGreat Britain.Kirk Anderson’s abduction, the soberly suited Eyre announced from the steps ofEpsom Police Station, was the result of ‘a personal problem’ stemming from hisconnection with a woman called Joyce McKinney. That was all he, or his church,were willing to say publicly at that time.The official police spokesman would only add that Kirk Anderson and severalother persons were helping them with their inquiries and that the mysteriousJoyce McKinney remained at large. Investigators were anxious to speak to her.She was described as an American in her mid-twenties, average height withshoulder-length blonde hair and a distinct Southern accent. She had a smalltriangular scar on her jaw and wore glasses with notably thick lenses. She wasbelieved to be in the company of another American – the sandy-haired,mustachioed young man who had called himself Bob Bosler during the abduction ofAnderson. Police now believed Bosler’s real name to be Keith Joseph May.Of course, the pressmen wanted one question answered above all others, andDetective Chief Superintendent Bill Hucklesby – in charge of the case – waspolitic enough to answer it: yes, Joyce McKinney was said to be a veryattractive young woman.Unofficially, of course, police officers are often willing to give details ‘offthe record’ to the press, provided they don’t risk prejudicing their case and,perhaps, if there is an off-duty pint of beer in it for them. Quiet journalisticpersistence soon revealed that Kirk Anderson had claimed to have been manacledto a bed for at least part of his three-day abduction. This was more than enoughfor news editors to work up some highly speculative, but eye-catching headlines.The police were also pleased when, the following day, Monday, Joyce McKinney andher accomplice, Keith May, were picked up in a police roadblock on the A30 inDevon. Anderson’s description of his enforced journey and his place ofincarceration had sounded as if he had been taken to the West Country, so Kentpolice had enlisted the help of the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary. These soonfound the cottage McKinney and May had rented – an isolated place on the edge ofDartmoor, near Okehampton. Inside there was evidence of recent habitation,including a pair of handcuffs, a set of foot manacles and a length of heavychain attached to a double bed. Anderson’s claim to have been held against hiswill seemed to have been confirmed.Now that the daily newspapers were also front-paging the story, foreigncorrespondents in the States soon turned up new details about the peopleinvolved. Joyce McKinney was from a small village called Minneapolis in NorthCarolina (not to be confused with the city of Minneapolis in Minnesota). To thedelight of the tabloids, she was found to be 27 years old, sported a ‘38-inch,C-cup bosom’ and had been a successful beauty queen – Miss Wyoming 1974.Joyce had converted to the Mormon Church after leaving Tennessee University –which had caused something of a rift with her parents – and had moved to thetown of Provo in Utah to immerse herself in her new faith. Joyce’s mother toldreporters that her daughter was ‘an introvert and a terribly lonely person’.However, her conversion had taken place a year before her success as MissWyoming, so Joyce had evidently not taken the Mormon teachings on maidenlyself-effacement too much to heart.Joyce’s mother also told pressmen that her daughter had met Kirk Anderson inProvo in 1975, and soon after had announced that they were engaged. However Kirkhad apparently broken it off immediately thereafter – for which Joyce had blamedher parents’ objections to the Mormon Church – and had subsequently gone awaywithout telling Joyce where he was headed. Joyce had been making frantic effortsto find him ever since, according to her mother.Kirk Anderson’s mother, on the other hand, simply told the press: ‘We didn’tknow anything about this girl. We do know that [Kirk has] had very little to dowith girls – only to teach them about the church. I personally think that he hasbeen living very close to the Lord.’Investigators found this all rather inconsistent. Joyce’s choice of such astrait-laced religion and her mother’s description of her as an ‘introvert’seemed rather at odds with her winning of the Miss Wyoming beauty contest – notto mention her involvement in an alleged kinky kidnapping.Further investigation then turned up another odd fact about her: during her timein Utah, she was believed to have attempted suicide after a romantic involvementwith Wayne Osmond – a member of the world-famous Mormon pop group, The Osmonds.Mrs Olive Osmond (mother and manager for the wholesome boy-band) flatly deniedthat any such relationship had ever taken place, claiming that Joyce had beenjust one of the many adoring fans who constantly pestered her sons. However,Joyce’s apparent obsession with the Osmonds – then the most famous Mormons inthe world – highlighted an aspect of her personality that almost everyacquaintance mentioned sooner or later – that Joyce McKinney was sure that shewas going to be famous one day.Although she was unavailable to give even restricted interviews until (and if)she was granted bail, Joyce McKinney sent an open letter from Holloway Prison tothe local newspaper in her home village of Minneapolis, North Carolina. Certainthat journalists would interview those she had grown up with, she wrote: ‘I urgeyou to tell them the truth. That my nickname in high school was “Iceberg”, thatI was boy-shy, and seldom dated. (I was the more studious type.) And I didn’teven play kissing games at parties. Also that I was never known to smoke, drinkor use any types of drugs or profanity and that I came from a very good family.Also that I represented Avery County in the Miss North Carolina High Schoolcontest as “North Carolina’s ideal high school girl”, as well as being a NorthCarolina Junior Miss and later Miss Wyoming in the “Miss USA” Pageant.’This odd mix of respectability and downright egotism only further whettedBritish newspaper interest in Miss McKinney, but little more of her personalcharms were expected to be revealed until she and Keith May were sent to theirfirst preliminary hearing on 12 October 1977.Preliminary hearings are primarily to help the presiding magistrates to decideif there is a criminal case to be heard and, if they deem it so, the entireprocess of evidence presentation needs to be begun again before a judge andjury. British reporting restrictions for preliminary hearings limit journaliststo revealing only the name, age, address, physical appearance and plea of anydefendant. Nevertheless, Joyce McKinney was determined to have her say in publicas soon as possible . . .Held for eighteen days in Holloway Women’s Prison, Joyce had requested a bible –which she consulted constantly during her stay there. However, as well aspresumably taking strength from its teachings, she also wrote in the ‘good book’herself.Joyce was placed in a windowed police van, to be taken to the preliminarymagistrate’s hearing on 12 October. Strictly speaking, she should have eithertravelled in an enclosed vehicle or should have had the traditional blanket overher head as the vehicle arrived at Epsom courthouse (this covering of a suspectis to prevent the risk of press photographs contaminating the evidence ofwitnesses at any later identity parades). However, as the police van pulledthrough a gaggle of pressmen, Joyce was under no such constraint. Turning to thewindow closest to the eager journalists she pressed her open bible to the glass.Written over the pages of Book of Job were the words: ‘PLEASE TELL THE TRUTH. MYREPUTATION IS AT STAKE.’Joyce’s escort of female officers struggled with her, but she managed to openher bible to another page, on which was written: ‘HE HAD SEX WITH ME FOR FOURDAYS.’ And on yet another page she had written: ‘PLEASE GET THE TRUTH TO THEPUBLIC. HE MADE IT LOOK LIKE A KIDNAPPING.’ Finally, as she was about to bedragged into the court building, she held up a last message: ‘ASK CHRISTIANS TOPRAY FOR ME.’Potentially solid gold as these messages were for the newspapers, news editorscould not print anything but Joyce’s pleas for truth and prayer. The statementsabout sex and faked kidnapping came directly under the British sub judice rule,which bans the public revelation of any fact that could be consideredprejudicial in a future trial.The first preliminary hearing itself was rather dull compared to the scene thathad taken place outside the court. Joyce’s profession was described as ‘model’and Keith May as ‘trainee architect’. Both pleaded ‘not guilty’ on charges ofkidnapping, but admitted to entering the country on false papers (Keith had beenarrested carrying documents with nine different identities, Joyce with four).Bail was denied May on the grounds that he was a trained pilot (and thus was agreater escape risk). Joyce was denied bail for her own protection as she had anadmitted history of attempted suicide.Joyce herself asked that non-sub judice reporting restrictions be lifted, so hercouncil could later make a statement to the press concerning her falsepassports: Joyce McKinney lived in fear of the Church of the Latter Day Saints,he stated, and carried false papers to hide herself from them. She believed, hewent on, that the Mormons sought retribution on her as a convert who had laterrenounced the faith. Her pursuit of Kirk Anderson following his becoming amissionary – and was thus supposed to have nothing to do with non-believingwomen – had only increased her fear that the Mormon hierarchy would seek to harmher in some way.Joyce also made her own direct statement to the press when again beingtransported in a police van. She pressed a piece of card to the window,revealing the hand-printed message: ‘KIRK LEFT WITH ME WILLINGLY! HE FEARSEXCOMMUNICATION FOR LEAVING HIS MISSION AND MADE UP THIS KIDNAPRAPE STORY.’Again, the message could not be printed due to the sub judice law, but Joyce hadmade plain to the press what her defence would be.At a preliminary hearing, Queen’s Council Neil Denison stated the case for theprosecution. Joyce McKinney was obsessed with Kirk Anderson, he said. She haddriven him from his native Utah, but even his taking-up of missionary workabroad had not put her off her relentless pursuit. Tracking him down, with theaid of her associate, Keith May, she had kidnapped Kirk at gunpoint, had takenhim to an isolated Devon cottage, had chained him to a bed and had then forcedhim to indulge in sexual acts with her before he was released. She and herassociate were guilty of kidnapping and Joyce herself was guilty of sexuallyabusing Kirk Anderson, Denison insisted.Here the reader should note that under British law, it is deemed impossible fora woman to rape a man. The law takes the view that if the man is genuinelyunwilling to have sex, he will naturally fail to achieve an erection. If, on theother hand, he achieves enough to sustain intercourse, then it is deemed that hemust have been willing in the first place. A charge of sexual abuse is, on theother hand, possible even if the man in question achieves an erection, providedhis partner is proved to have used excessive threats, force or physicalrestraint on him.The obvious witness to support the prosecution’s case was Kirk Anderson himself– the man whose charms had drawn a beauty queen across the Atlantic was a personthe public and press were keen to see, but he had, with laudable Mormonself-effacement, stayed away from the public eye up to that point. As he nowmade his way to the witness stand, all eyes were on him.In fact, Kirk Anderson was a remarkably unstriking figure. His bespectacled,fairly average-looking face topped a big body – at least seventeen or eighteenstone. Although he appeared more big-boned than actually fat, Kirk moved in agawky way and walked with a flat-footed shamble. He was arguably a fine exampleof a milk-fed young Mormon missionary, but he hardly looked the catalyst of somuch trouble in two countries.Under questioning by the prosecution, Kirk described meeting Joyce at a Provodrive-in ice cream parlour. Joyce had a maroon, open-top Chevrolet Corvette – avery flashy sports car for a female Mormon convert to own – and Kirk hadwandered over to ask her about it. They became friendly and started to date.Joyce had liked Kirk so much that she had suggested marriage on their thirdmeeting.Kirk had doubts, not only because he hardly knew Joyce, but because he wassigned up to do his tour of missionary work. He was also worried because he andJoyce had already broken the rules of premarital chastity, so Kirk consulted hisbishop (a more informal title in Mormonism than in other branches ofChristianity, but still a religious director with the power to hand outspiritual judgements and church punishments). Kirk was firmly told to break offhis relationship with Joyce McKinney and to prepare himself spiritually for hismissionary tour.Joyce, Kirk told the court, ‘did not accept that position’. She had made severalembarrassing scenes in public and, at one point while he was riding amotorcycle, had forced him off the road by driving dangerously close in herCorvette. Eventually, to avoid further such problems, Kirk had been sent toCalifornia to begin his missionary work early. He indicated that Joyce’spersistent hounding of him had then driven him to relocate from California toOregon, and eventually to Epsom in England. It was there that she had finallycaught up with him, and had abducted him.Kirk went on to describe the actual kidnapping. He had met with the youngAmerican who called himself Bob Bosler (Keith May) and had agreed to point outthe location of the Mormon Southern England Headquarters on a map in ‘Bosler’s’car. As they moved out of view of Kimball Smith (Kirk’s missionary partner) Kirkhad felt something hard poked into his ribs:‘I was startled,’ Kirk told the court, ‘and as I looked down I saw it was a gun.I was quite scared.‘He took me over to the car, that was parked fifty yards away, and I got intothe rear seat. Joyce was in the front seat wearing a dark wig and she hadanother gun.‘She said something like how did I think eight thousand miles of ocean was goingto keep us apart, or something to that effect.’Keith May had got into the driver’s seat and drove away from the church. Joycethen climbed into the back seat with Kirk, still threatening him with the gunand, on May’s suggestion, made Kirk lie down so she could cover him with ablanket.There followed a long and, for the bulky Anderson, a presumably uncomfortablejourney. At one point he managed to peek out of the car window long enough tosee a sign reading ‘Yeovil’, but he had no idea where he was when the careventually pulled up outside the isolated Dartmoor cottage McKinney had rented.‘I was taken to the bedroom and allowed to sit while Joy cooked dinner,’ Kirkcontinued. ‘They explained they had brought me to the cottage so we could sortout the things that had happened since I had known her.‘She told me she still loved me and wanted to marry me.’While Keith May had politely slept in another room, Joyce and Kirk had shared abed. Nothing sexual happened that night, Kirk insisted, and he had spent a lotof the hours of darkness listening to the affectionate chattering of hiskidnapper.The next day ‘Bob’ had attached a leather strap to Kirk’s ankle and ran a longchain from the strap to the heavy bed frame – ‘for Joyce’s protection’ Andersonwas told.‘I had thought of escape,’ Kirk explained to the court, ‘but I didn’t reallyknow where I was. I decided if I tried to co-operate and gain their confidence Iwould be able to sort out a release.’Joyce emphatically told him that the price of his freedom – short of fullmatrimony – was to ‘give her another baby’.‘That night (15 September) she spent the night with me in bed. I kissed her andheld her in my arms. But there was nothing else. I was trying to co-operate.’The metaphorical gloves came off, he said, on the third night of hisincarceration.‘When she came into the room there was a fire in the fireplace and she put somemusic on. I recognized it because she played it in the apartment two yearsearlier when we first had intercourse.‘She was wearing a negligee. She came to me as I lay on the bed. I said I wouldlike my back rubbed. She proceeded to do that, but I could tell she wanted tohave intercourse again. I said I did not and she tried to convince me. She thenleft the room and returned a few minutes later with May. May was carryingchains, ropes and padlocks.’The pair then tied and chained Kirk, spread-eagled on his back, to the fourbedposts. Keith May left and Joyce ripped off Kirk’s pyjamas and his sacredundergarment, then forced him to have full, penetrative sex.Prosecution Council Neil Denison asked Kirk: ‘You mentally didn’t want it tohappen, so how could it physically have occurred?’Anderson replied that first ‘she had oral sex.’As Stuart Elgrod, council for the defence, cross-examined Kirk, he was probablyquite unaware that he was, at one point, making religious history. He asked Kirkwhat he meant by the ‘garment’ he said he had worn beneath his pyjamas. Kirk,clearly uncomfortable with the question, replied that all faithful Mormons weara sacred garment beneath their normal clothing – resembling a woman’s one-pieceswimsuit. This item is embroidered with sacred symbols – usually by the Mormon’smother – and is supposed to protect their chastity, both physically andspiritually.This was the first time that this inner secret of the Church of the Latter DaySaints had ever been revealed in public. Some people jeered at such an oddprecaution – especially as it had failed so singularly in Kirk’s case – butMormons pointed out that it was no sillier than the traditional accoutrementssported by those in other religions. It has been reported, however, that certainunscrupulous non-Mormon lawyers in the United States have since deliberatelyworn fake ‘chastity garments’ during trials with Mormons sitting on the jury.The idea being that a Mormon will note the tell-tale rumpling of the lawyer’sclothes and might be more sympathetic towards their case.On matters of more import to the immediate case, Elgrod asked Kirk how manytimes he and Joyce had made love on the night before he was released.‘Three times,’ Kirk replied. The two times following the first he had been justas unwilling, he stressed, but allowed himself to be coaxed by Joyce because shehad threatened to get Keith May to chain him to the bedposts again.‘I am suggesting,’ Elgrod continued, ‘that at no stage were you ever tied up inthat cottage except for the purpose of sex games.’ Kirk flatly denied this.Elgrod’s questioning later turned up the fact that Keith May had politely leftKirk and Joyce alone in the cottage for around 24 hours, but Kirk had made noattempt to escape, even though he must have guessed that Joyce would never shoothim (in fact, the guns turned out to be harmless replicas).‘I was bolted in,’ Kirk replied, referring to his ankle chain.Then there was the matter of Kirk’s release on Saturday 17 September. Kirkadmitted that he had been unrestrained when Joyce and Keith had driven him backto London. Arriving, they had stopped off in Haymarket to withdraw money fromthe American Express office. Then they had wandered around Trafalgar Square andhad had lunch in the Hard Rock Café on Piccadilly. At no time had Kirk eithertried to escape or sought aid from passing policemen. Why?‘Because they were taking me back to Epsom,’ Kirk shrugged.Under Elgrod’s questioning, Kirk confirmed that the reason he had ceased to seeJoyce in Utah was because they had indulged in pre-marital sex, and his bishophad forbidden Kirk to associate with, much less marry her.Was it true, Elgrod asked, that following this enforced breakup, Kirk hadreceived a letter from a firm of Provo solicitors, acting on Joyce’s behalf,informing him that she was pregnant, that she intended to have the child andwould file legal proceeding against him if he failed to acknowledge paternityand marry her? Kirk conceded that this was true, but he had done nothing becausehe believed Joyce had been lying about the positive pregnancy test.‘She told me she was pregnant just three days after we [originally] hadintercourse,’ Kirk said to underline Joyce’s overoptimistic eagerness to be inthe ‘blessed state’. He had been unsurprised, he went on, when the pregnancyfailed to develop and he did not believe Joyce’s claim to have had amiscarriage. He believed she had simply invented the baby to try to forcemarriage on him.Following his appearance in the witness box, Kirk Anderson did not return to thecourt, although his fellow Mormon representatives were always there in force.The case defence council Stuart Elgrod presented to the presiding magistrateemphasized that Joyce and Kirk had been lovers and, if Kirk had been less inthrall to his faith, would probably have been man and wife. However, underpressure from his religious superiors, Kirk had been forced to abandon thepregnant Joyce and go abroad. Over the following year, Joyce had tirelesslysought out her lover and, when she discovered his location in England, hadhurried to be reunited with him. He had gone willingly to Devon with Joyce andher friend Keith May. All three had regarded the trip as a rescue from aheartless religion, not a kidnapping.The evidence of Kirk’s willingness to go with Joyce, Elgrod continued, was seenin his total failure to try to escape and his readiness to have sex with her.The chains, ropes and manacles were nothing more than bondage sex toys: a littleunorthodox to the old-fashioned and prudish perhaps but, after all, this was1977. Sexual experimentation was hardly a rarity in British or American society.Unfortunately, after they had returned to London, Kirk’s fear of excommunicationfrom the Mormon Church had overcome his happiness at being reunited with Joyce.Instead of facing up to his religious superiors and insisting that he and Joycewere not going to be forced apart again, he had cravenly filed a claim ofkidnapping and sexual assault against her.‘It is quite clear, from what we know, that any further relapse by Mr Andersonwould result immediately in his being sent home and excommunicated,’ Elgrod saidin conclusion. Certainly the Church of the Latter Day Saints and their chosenbeliefs were not standing trial, he stressed, but the magistrates should takethe strictness of the Mormon way of life into account when considering how ithad impacted on the events of the immediate case.Elgrod ended on a Shakespearian note with a modified line from Hamlet: ‘Methinksthe Mormon doth protest too much.’If Kirk Anderson had been a rather unimpressive figure in court, the same couldnot be said for Joyce McKinney. While wearing the sort of sober clothes thatemphasized her claim still to be a deeply religious person – if not a Mormon anymore – she still managed to show off the good looks and strong personality thathad helped her win the title of Miss Wyoming three years earlier.She had a rounded, pert face, a broad, winning smile and a slightly up-turnednose, all surmounted by surprisingly dark brown eyes for someone who claimedthat her honey-blonde hair was totally natural. She made the same claim for herapparently gravity-defying breasts. As she was being led back to the police vanto be returned to Holloway Prison, tabloid journalists shouted bawdycompliments. She paused, presented her full profile to the photographers and,indicating her upper body, shouted: ‘All mine!’Neither Joyce nor Keith May gave evidence, because the defence chose not to callthem. (In fact it is rare for a defendant to give evidence, unless called uponto be examined by the prosecution. It is a legal truism that the most dangerouswitness to a defence case is the defendant themselves, as they rarely make aperfect impression on judge or jury.)However, following her defence lawyer’s summing up, Joyce announced that shewould like to read a prepared statement to the court. The magistrates said thatthis would be allowable, if it was not too long, and Joyce made her way to thewitness stand with an ominously thick folder in her hand. Printed on the foldercover – in Joyce’s now easily recognizable handwriting – were the words: ‘THEGREATEST LOVE STORY EVER TOLD’. It was noted that Stuart Elgrod did not lookhappy about the new turn of events.Taking out fourteen pages of closely handwritten script, Joyce launched intowhat she plainly meant to be her big scene (she had already started to write thefilm script of her version of events, and meant to insist that she should playherself when Hollywood producers competed to buy the rights to her story).She began by describing her earlier life, speaking quickly in a Deep Southaccent that her British listeners sometimes found hard to follow. She describedherself in far from humble tones – stressing her accomplishments at university,as a beauty queen and as an amateur actress. She even mentioned her IQ score atthe age of nine: ‘Nine points above that of genius. I’m not saying this just totoot my own horn.’She then moved on to her conversion to Mormonism and her pilgrimage to Utah.There, she said, she had soon become deeply disillusioned. Staying in the hallsof residence of the Brigham Young University, she had been horrified to seeMormon girls drinking alcohol and ogling pictures of naked men. The young maleMormons were, she said, even worse: ‘The missionaries, whom I expected to bespiritual enough to be prospective husbands, were wolves.’‘I didn’t expect this at all,’ she went on. ‘I was in a state of cultural shock.I prayed for a very special boy who would come into my life . . . and that iswhere Kirk comes in.’Joyce went on to describe her first meeting with Kirk in more or less the samedetails he had given previously, with one exception – she was clearly nettled athis statement that he had originally been drawn to the charms of her car, ratherthan herself – ‘I would like to say that he did not propose marriage to the car;he proposed marriage to me,’ she commented tartly.It was Kirk who had first suggested marriage, Joyce continued, not she. She hadasked him: ‘Honey, are you sure you can support me?’ To which she said thenineteen-year-old had enthusiastically replied: ‘Honey, I’d work five jobs tosupport you.’‘To a woman this means something,’ Joyce read on, ‘these are pretty heavypromises. He even promised to give me a rock [a diamond on their engagementring] so big it would make my hand sag.‘Believe me,’ she stressed, ‘after fighting off guys for twenty-four years, Iwouldn’t just give myself to a man unless he’d made some pretty heavy promisesand marriage plans.’On a rather plaintive note, Joyce added: ‘We even had our [prospective] childrennamed. They were to be called Gabriel Kirk and Joshua Kyle.’Concerning the pre-marital sex she had with Kirk in Utah, Joyce said that ‘anyphysical desire I felt was an indirect result of the real spiritual and mentallove I had for him. A love he encouraged.’She added, perhaps rather cattily: ‘I cannot say I ever got any pleasure out ofsexual relations with Kirk – I was too busy trying to satisfy him.’As to the sinfulness of even pleasureless sex before marriage, Joyce had decidedthat God had forgiven her: ‘[Making love with Kirk] was the most specialcommitment of my life. It had made me his wife in God’s eyes.’Unfortunately, Kirk had not seen the matter in the same light: ‘[For him] it wasa quick thrill. Something we call casual – something to cover up to his bishopand his mother.’On the subject of Kirk’s attempts to escape the righteous wrath of his churchand family, Joyce said: ‘This isn’t the first time he’s accused me of rapinghim. He told the same story in Utah. A friend of his told me that he said to hismother: “Mom, she did everything I just lay there. I didn’t have anything to dowith it.”’After his interview with his bishop, Kirk and many of the Mormons of Provo hadostracized her, Joyce said. People crossed the street to avoid her, her car wasdented by a vandal with a crowbar, and she started to receive anonymous phonecalls at night, threatening both her and her unborn child.As to the public rows she had with her former lover, Joyce described herselfinvariably getting the better of ‘scared little boy’ Kirk. At one point, whenmeeting with him and his mother to discuss Joyce’s pregnancy, Kirk had shouted‘Fuck you!’ at her. She described herself calmly replying: ‘That’s what you did,dear, and that’s why we’re in this mess.’Kirk at that time, Joyce insisted, was sheltering behind the skirts of hismatriarchal mother, and allowed his excessive love for her to eclipse his properfeelings for Joyce and their unborn baby. When Joyce lost her temper with him atone point, calling him a ‘son-of-a-gun,’ Kirk had shouted: ‘Don’t call my sweetmother names!’(Joyce seems, like many people, to have thought of ‘son-of-a-gun’ as a very mildexpletive, but perhaps Kirk knew its actual derivation. It’s a naval insult fromthe age of sail used to describe the bastard of a low-price prostitute – thosewomen who would come on board a ship in port to do business with members of thecrew between two guns on the cannon deck.)However, according to Joyce, matters soon became much more serious than merechildish name-calling. She claimed that two men attacked her, knocked her downand kicked her in the stomach. That trauma, she said, coupled with her fragileemotional state was what had caused her to miscarry the baby.‘I believe the spirit of Kirk’s child is still living as much as you or me,’Joyce read to the court through her tears. ‘And I believe I can still mother himone day.’Joyce did not believe Kirk was behind the assault and insisted that he stillloved her.‘If I did not have faith in his love for me, I could not have flown halfwayround the world with my wedding band and my trousseau in my suitcase to seehim.’However, turning to the alleged kidnapping itself, Joyce was predictablyscathing of Kirk’s version of events. She and Keith May had carried guns, sheadmitted, but only to frighten off any Mormons who tried to stop them leaving.Kirk had guessed that the handguns were fake the moment he saw them. Climbinginto the car of his own volition, Kirk had grinned at Joyce and said: ‘Hi,pintsize. Are you going to fight the whole Mormon army?’The drive down to Devon had been an escape from the grasping control of theChurch of the Latter Day Saints, not a kidnapping, Joyce then insisted. Shepositively scoffed at the idea that Kirk had been dragged away and held againsthis will.‘I picked a romantic little honeymoon cottage because I wanted to get away fromthe smog of Los Angeles. You should have seen the place when we walked in. Therewere presents everywhere for him and his slippers under the chair. I had asolid, eighteen-carat gold ring for him. It cost me over £1,000, but I wantedhim to have the best. I just loved cooking for him, fixing his favourite mealsand massaging his back.‘We made love several times at the cottage,’ she read on. ‘If he didn’t like it,why didn’t he just walk up to the people next door and say: “Excuse me? There’sa girl in the cottage next door and she’s kidnapped me! She’s there making myfavourite meals and baking me chocolate cake, giving me a better back rub thanmy mother and making love with me!”‘Why didn’t he do that?’ she demanded. ‘Because nobody would believe him. They’dthink he was a fool.’Concerning his claim of sexual assault, Joyce was positively scornful.‘A woman raping a man? Him eighteen stone and me eight stone? Come on! Whom iskidding whom? His claim that he was unwilling makes me laugh!‘I was supposed to play-act the part of a beautiful woman who had him in herlove prison. He laid down on the bed for me and let me tie him up. I did so bymyself [not with the help of Keith May] and put fake stage blood on him.‘Yes, I tore off his pyjamas and it was : “Oh! You sexy tiger!” But I acted thewhole scene out for him. The whole works on his request.‘If he was so unwilling, then why was he lying there grinning like a monkey? Whywas he moving his hips with me?‘I said, “Honey, does that feel good? Do you like it like this?” And he goes“Phew! Hot!”’Perhaps noting the court’s reaction to her intimate statements, Joyce apologizedto the bench, suddenly as demure as any southern belle from Gone with the Wind:‘It sure embarrasses me to tell things like this. But it has to be told.’She then continued with her reading: ‘At this point I think I should explainsexual bondage and Kirk’s sexual hang-ups.‘Kirk was raised by a very dominant mother. He has a lot of guilt about sexbecause his mother over-protected him all his life. When we make love he has tohave all the lights out and wash up afterwards. He believes truly that sex isdirty.‘Kirk has to be tied up to have an orgasm. I co-operated because I loved him andwanted to help him. Sexual bondage turns him on because he doesn’t have to feelguilty. The thought of being powerless before a woman seems to excite him.’She continued shyly: ‘I didn’t have to give him oral sex, but I did do it, athis request, because he likes it.‘It was just amazing,’ she added, apparently off-the-cuff and in a tone ofwonder, ‘he just kept going and going . . .’Then she returned to the main theme: her defence against the charges.‘He’s had all kinds of temper tantrums after sex. I guess putting me in prisonis an extension of those tantrums.’Speaking for over an hour, Joyce painted a picture of herself deeply in love: ‘Iloved him so much that if anybody had tried to shoot him, I would have steppedin front of him and stopped the bullet.’Unfortunately, according to her, the object of her love was a young man withsevere sexual hang-ups and a fear of his church that could lead him even toframe the woman he loved: ‘My little priest is quite sexually frustrated. But assoon as the ropes hit his wrists, he attained sexual satisfaction . . . Itsaddens me now to think of the things he did at the cottage to make it look likea kidnap.’Her summing up was a plea to the court that would have done credit to ScarlettO’Hara: ‘This man has imprisoned my heart with false promises of love andmarriage and family life. He has cast me into prison for a kidnap he knows heset things up for. I don’t want anything more to do with Kirk. He does not knowwhat eternal love is.‘All I ask is that you do not imprison me any longer. Let me pick up the piecesof my life. I ask you to let me out of prison so I can get a counsellor to helpme get over the great emotional hurt I feel inside.’Again in floods of tears, Joyce made a final plea for mercy before leaving thestand: ‘My father has a bad heart and this may be the last Christmas I spendwith him.’The bemused magistrates took very little time, however, to decide that it wouldtake a full trial at the High Court to winnow the truth out of such a bizarrecase. Nevertheless, Joyce’s pleas had moved them enough to allow the release ofboth Joyce and Keith May on bail. Joyce’s bail was paid by her father – a poorman who had to mortgage his house to get the money, a circumstance that couldnot have helped his heart condition.The newspapermen trying to follow the story were, if anything, more confusedafter Joyce’s lengthy statement. On the one hand there was Kirk Anderson, whoclaimed that an experience that most men his age would have leapt at was, tohim, a terrible ordeal. On the other was the attractive Miss McKinney, whoclaimed to have spent her life savings of $17,000 tracking, ‘rescuing’ andpampering a man who returned the compliment by having her thrown in jail.Certainly most sympathy lay with Joyce, as Kirk had not been hurt in anynon-spiritual fashion, but that didn’t mean that her story was taken at facevalue. She was a little too much of a drama queen – a demure southern rose oneminute, a roistering girl-of-the-world the next – to be wholly believed.Then there was the mysterious Keith May who, so far, had remained silent. Aneducated Californian in his mid-twenties, he did not, on first sight, seem thetype to cross the globe to help two other people find true love, whetherenforced or not. Throughout the preliminary hearing Joyce had sat next to himand held his hand. The pair’s affectionate body language clearly indicated thatthere was some sort of a close bond between them – but, the pressmen wondered,just how far did it go?However, such uncertainties certainly made for good news copy, and anunrehearsed comment Joyce had made off-the-cuff during her statement to thecourt had especially the lowbrow British tabloids in a fever. Describing thedepth and passion of her love for Kirk, Joyce had said that, for him, she would‘have skied down Mount Everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose.’Now she was out in comparative freedom, the papers were frantically competing tobuy her exclusive story (most of which would have to be printed after theup-coming trial to avoid the ever present British sub judice laws). The editorof the Sun was said to be especially keen to pay Joyce to pose for the paper’s‘art’ photo on page three.Specifically, he wanted her on a fake mountain, wearing nothing but skis and acarnation – although presumably he did not want her to push the latter up hernose. Joyce – in full religious maiden mode – indignantly refused the offer,insisting that she could never pose nude, whatever the payment. She wasinterested, however, in selling her story . . . to the highest bidder.Meanwhile, some journalists had spotted the main hole in Joyce’s story. She camefrom a poor family and gave her profession as ‘model’. If so, where had sheamassed the small fortune of 17,000 dollars that had paid for her pursuit ofKirk?Most of the two years since her split-up with Kirk in Utah had been spent,according to Joyce, in Los Angeles, California. Journalists from the Mirrornewspaper (the Sun’s main competitor in the British tabloid market) headed forLA, mainly in the hopes of finding photographs of Joyce ‘modelling’ – howeverdemurely – to scoop the Sun. They realized that some such pictures had to existif Joyce had indeed made her money as a model.Interviews with several of Joyce’s friends and acquaintances in Californiainitially confirmed her story – she had certainly been looking for Kirk and hadtold everyone who would listen that she feared the retribution of the Church ofthe Latter Day Saints. She had also apparently saved herself for her lost love –refusing all offers of dates and, as far as anyone knew (or would admit), neverhaving sex with anyone.The Mirror journalists had all but given up on finding any salacious gossipabout Joyce when a chance encounter led them to the man who was looking afterJoyce’s belongings, car and dog while she was away.Steve Moskowitz casually admitted that both he and Keith May were in love withJoyce, but she had made it plain that her heart belonged to the missing Kirk.When asked if he was also holding Joyce’s modelling portfolio, Moskowitz handedover several sheets of black and white contact proofs. Most of the tiny picturesshowed Joyce in various respectable modelling costumes – a cowgirl, a ladyaviator, a bride etc. – but there were also several of her naked, prancingthrough a field, apparently representing Eve in the Garden of Eden. As if thiswere not enough of a scoop, Moskowitz then casually asked why, if they wantednaked pictures of her, the journalists hadn’t asked the porno magazines Joycehad posed for?It turned out that, far from being too moral ever to pose naked, Joyce had beenphotographed for magazines with titles like Chopper, Hogtie, Knotty and Bound toPlease, sometimes in positions that were virtually gynaecological. Strangely,although most of the pictures were sado-masochistic hardcore – involving Joycepretending to be tortured by other women – she maintained her fidelity to Kirkin one respect: there were no pictures of her engaged in actual sex.The Mirror journalists, perusing the magazine back-issues at the publisher’sdown-at-heel office, were also interested to note that although Joyce was anatural blonde – as she had claimed – tell-tale scars visible in certainpictures were clear evidence that her vaunted breasts had, in fact, beenenhanced by surgery.However, even lowering herself to hardcore pornography did not explain how Joycehad made over 17,000 dollars in a little over a year. The answer again came fromher friend Steve Moskowitz.When asked about the money he laughed and told the journalists: ‘Hell! The wayJoy spent money tracking Anderson, 17,000 dollars wouldn’t have gotten her tothe airport.’He then showed them an advert in the LA Free Press (nicknamed the FREEP):> Gorgeous Former> ‘Miss USA’> Contestant Desires Work!> Beauty Brains and Talent! –> THE BEST GAL IN THE FREEP> (PhD in Drama/Film, former model, actress & state beauty queen, 38-24-36, a> slim sweet Southern Blonde) – How would you like her to leisurely bathe you,> lovingly blow-dry/style your hair, then give you a delicious nude massage on> her fur-covered water bed? ($100) – or try her ‘Fantasy Room’ – (Your fantasy> is her speciality! – S&M, B&D, escort service, PR work, acting jobs, nude> wrestling/modelling, erotic phone calls, dirty panties or pictures, TV, charm> school fantasies etc.) Mail your Fantasy to> ‘JOEY’> P.S.- ‘Ah love shy boys, dirty ol’ men and sugah daddies!’The style of the advert – the confused wordiness and mix of egotism andworldliness – made it unquestionably the work of Joyce ‘Joey’ McKinney. But didthe inclusion of the phrase ‘escort service’ (a euphemism for high-classprostitution) indicate that she had finally been fully unfaithful to her Kirk?Steve Moskowitz was unequivocal in his denial. In fact, he said, when Joycerealized that some customers could not be satisfied with everything but fullsex, she had brought in a female partner to perform that extra service. Shecould afford to, Moskowitz said – after all, the ‘business’ was making thousandsevery month.Joyce did not read the Mirror’s subsequent revelation of her secret life inCalifornia – at least, not in Britain. She and Keith May skipped bail andescaped back to America via Ireland before the case could come to trial. She waseventually found guilty in absentia and ordered to serve a year in prison but,of course, never returned to undergo the token sentence.Kirk Anderson had been sent back to Utah well before Joyce and Keith did theirmoonlight flit, but he was not excommunicated from the Church of the Latter DaySaints.The usually taciturn Keith May made a comment to a British journalist shortlybefore skipping bail: ‘This is a pretty strange country. If Joy had been bustedin the US for doing what she did to Kirk, the only thing the cops would havedone before they let her go was make sure they had her phone number.’"},{"pageContent":"MCPHERSON, AIMÉE SEMPLETHE MYSTERY KIDNAPPINGAIMÉE SEMPLE MCPHERSON – once described as ‘the world’s most pulchritudinousevangelist’ – lost her immense following with dramatic suddenness after afarcical trial in which she was charged with ‘a conspiracy to obstruct justice’.She was born Aimée Elizabeth Kennedy, on a small farm in Canada, near Ingersoll,Ontario, on 9 October 1890. Her mother, a highly dominant woman, had been aSalvation Army lass until she married a devout farmer many years her senior.Aimée, like her mother, had a determined character, and there was a great dealof conflict between them in her childhood. Minnie Kennedy – later known as ‘Ma’– found marriage to her elderly husband boring and frustrating and took it outon her family.At the age of seventeen Aimée fell in love with a young English evangelist namedRobert Semple and married him in spite of her mother’s objections. Sempleintended to become a missionary and apparently felt that she would make an idealwife. She joined her husband in his evangelist activities in Chicago, then theywent to England to see his parents. But when they arrived in Hong Kong, where heintended to begin his missionary work, Semple was stricken with fever and diedin the English hospital. Aimée gave birth to a girl soon afterwards. The Chinamission provided funds to send her back to America.She joined her parents, who had moved to New York, tried life on the farm inCanada, then returned to New York and married a grocery clerk named HaroldMcPherson, by whom she had a son. Marriage bored her and within eighteen monthsshe was on the move again, following the only profession she knew – that ofevangelist. In Canada, she attracted a crowd by standing on a chair at a streetcorner, her eyes closed and her arms raised in prayer. As the crowd waited insilent expectation, Aimée suddenly opened her eyes and yelled, ‘Follow me!’ andrushed to the revival hall. Once the crowd was in she shouted, ‘Shut the doors.Don’t let anyone out.’For the next few years, it was a rather discouraging routine of travellingaround the country in a battered old car with a tent in the back. Her motherjoined her and took the collections. Aimée preached the literal truth of everyword in the Bible and the personal return of Jesus Christ. Slowly, she acquireda following. She began to hire lecture halls. Then, in 1917, at the age of 27,she made the momentous decision to head for California. In her old car, with hermother and two children, she made her way slowly across the country.Aimée was not, in fact, ‘pulchritudinous’; her features were too heavy, and herlegs were like those of a Welsh dresser (so she always wore long skirts). But bythe usual standards of female evangelists, she was a welcome change. Within aweek of arriving in Los Angeles, she was able to rent the PhilharmonicAuditorium, which held over 3,000 people. Suddenly she was a celebrity. The richcontralto voice could hold the multitudes. On a new wave of confidence, shetravelled to Canada, New Zealand and Australia. It seems to have dawned on herthat American sales techniques could be used to sell religion. Back inCalifornia, this time in San Diego, she scattered evangelical tracts from anaircraft and held meetings in a boxing arena.It was in San Diego that Aimée suddenly became far more than a successfulpreacher. San Diego was full of old and retired citizens and the suicide rateand the statistics for mental and physical illness were far higher than in therest of California. At an outdoor meeting in Organ Pavilion, in Balboa Park, amiddle-aged paralytic rose from her wheelchair in front of 30,000 people andtook a few halting steps. Suddenly, hundreds of people were hobbling towards theplatform, tears streaming down their faces, praising the Lord and Aimée SempleMcPherson. The next day, everyone in San Diego was talking about the miracle.Aimée embarked on another triumphant tour of the Pacific coast. Then sherealized it was time to stop moving around like a travelling showman. She wouldbuild a temple in Los Angeles. In 1923, Los Angeles was not the world’s mostsprawling city; it was still an enormous village, full of country folk. Theywelcomed the idea of an evangelical temple, and contributed generously. On 1January 1923, trumpets blared, and Aimée unveiled the floodlit, electricallyrotating cross that formed the heart of the Angelus Temple; by night it could beseen fifty miles away. The Temple, and Sister Aimée’s house next door, had costabout $1(1/2) million. The Temple had a seating capacity of 5,000, abroadcasting station, a theological seminary, an enormous organ, and a ‘MiracleRoom’ full of discarded crutches. Groups of disciples engaged in non-stopprayer, participating in relays. Aimée, with a genius that owed something toHollywood (and to which Billy Graham undoubtedly owes some of his own methods),held pageants with music, picture-shows of the Holy Land, and dramatizedsermons, all accompanied by a vast choir. Her neighbour Carey McWilliamsremarked felicitously that, ‘Aimée kept the Ferris wheels and merry-go-rounds ofreligion turning night and day.’ At the end of her sermons, she asked sinners tocome forward to be saved; as the lights were lowered, and soft music soothed theaudience, hundreds rose to their feet and moved down the aisles. Then Aiméewould shout, ‘Turn on the lights and clear the one-way street for Jesus,’ andsuddenly the music would turn into a brazen blare. Aimée was one of the earth’sgreat showmen. For sheer entertainment her meetings surpassed anything thatcould be seen in the cinemas.It was in 1925 that a new radio operator took over the Temple’s radio station.His name was Kenneth G. Ormiston and he had a soothing, cultivated voice. Atfirst, Aimée spoke to him only over the headphones; then they met by the Templesteps and and she drove him home to his wife. But soon Ormiston was no longerhurrying home to his wife once the programmes were over. Instead, he went to aroom in the Ambassador Hotel, where Sister Aimée was waiting. In 1926 Aimée wenton a visit to the Holy Land, financed by ‘love offerings’ from her followers.Ormiston was absent from California during this period, although it is not knownfor certain whether he travelled with Aimée. She was back in Los Angeles in May1926, and continued her clandestine meetings with Ormiston in various hotels. On14 May Ormiston rented a cottage in Carmel, told the landlord that he would bereturning with his ‘invalid wife’, and went back to Los Angeles.Four days later, Aimée disappeared. She had gone to the beach at Venice for aswim. She sat in a beach tent, working on sermon notes, and after a while, shesent her secretary off on some errand. When the secretary returned, Aimée hadvanished. Her mother proclaimed from the steps of the Temple, ‘She is with Jesus– pray for her.’ For the next 32 days, her followers mounted a frantic search.Aircraft flew close to the waves; men in diving suits looked for her body on theocean floor. Two followers committed suicide – a young man yelled ‘I’m goingafter her’ and leapt into the sea. Aimée’s mother had flowers scattered from anaircraft on the spot. A collection of $36,000 was taken for a memorial.On 27 May, a newspaper mentioned that Ormiston had also vanished; his wife hadreported him missing. Further probing by reporters revealed that he had alsobeen absent when Aimée was in the Holy Land. As all Los Angeles began to buzzwith indecent rumour and speculation, Ormiston strolled into the searchheadquarters, denied all knowledge of Aimée’s disappearance and vanished again.The police of California began to suspect that there might be a connectionbetween Aimée and Ormiston, and that if they could find one they would find theother. Suddenly the search was intensified. On the morning of 29 May Ormistoncalled at a Salinas garage, near Carmel, to collect his car; he was accompaniedby a woman, and later that day, they registered as ‘Mr and Mrs Frank Gibson’ ata hotel in St Luis Obispo. That night, their car was stopped by a suspiciousnewspaper reporter. Ormond turned and headed back towards San Francisco. Fivedays later, on 23 June 1926, a resident of a cottage in Agua Prieta, just acrossthe Mexican border from Douglas, Arizona, was awakened by a knocking at thedoor, to be confronted by a woman who claimed she had been the victim of akidnapping. It was Aimée.Her story was that she had been kidnapped by two men and a woman – Rose, Steveand Jake. She had been taken to a shack in Mexico and had eventually escaped.When she returned to Los Angeles, 30,000 people were waiting at the station andshe was carried to her car through lanes of flowers. Her followers showed atendency to forgive and forget, and the rest of the world might have done thesame, if Aimée had not tried quite so hard to prove her innocence.She kept asking what the police were doing to find the kidnappers and issuedchallenges over the radio. A grand jury declared that there was no evidence toindict anyone. Soon after that, someone tracked down her ‘love nest’ in Carmel.Ormiston, who was still in hiding, sent an affidavit stating that although hehad stayed in the cottage with a woman who was not his wife, that woman was notAimée. This seemed to be confirmed when a woman announced that the lady inquestion was her sister; Aimée publicly declared herself vindicated. But whenthe lady proved to be wanted by the police for passing bad cheques, the pressonce again showed a disposition to regard Aimée as an adulterous woman who haddecided to brazen it out. Another grand jury was convened; this time, a followerof Aimée’s vanished to the lavatory with a major piece of evidence – a scrap ofpaper found in the ‘love nest’ with Aimée’s writing on it – and flushed it downthe toilet. The grand jury was dismissed. Finally, Aimée was charged withconspiring with others to obstruct justice. She raised a ‘fight the Devil fund’of $¼ million, explaining to her followers that she was being crucified by theforces of evil. The evidence against her looked overwhelming; chambermaidstestified about her sessions in hotel rooms with Ormiston and the hotelregisters left no doubt about it. She was identified as the ‘Mrs McIntyre’ ofthe Carmel ‘love nest’ and the cheque-bouncing lady who had supported Ormiston’sstory now admitted she had been paid by Aimée, who had carefully coached her inher story. And yet, in spite of all this, District Attorney Asa Keyes suddenlymoved to dismiss the case against her – there was talk of a $30,000 bribe.(Keyes was later sentenced to prison for corruption in office.) Aimée announcedthat the Lord had rescued her and settled down to writing her autobiography, Inthe Service of the King, in which she repeated the kidnapping story.Soon after this, Aimée set out on another lecture tour; this time the subjectwas her own life and she expected her audiences to pay for admission. To hersurprise, few people seemed inclined to do this. It was the same when she wenton a European tour in 1928. The faithful continued to regard Sister Aimée as asaint and a wronged woman but the general public seemed to regard her with acynical amusement. Her publicity stunts, her public quarrels (with her mother,among others) and her law suits began to bore even the American press. Shechartered a liner for a crusade to the Holy Land but only a hundred followersturned up. For this occasion, Aimée had her chestnut hair bleached to blonde;her mother was indiscreet enough to mention that she had also had her facelifted and this alienated more of the faithful than the kidnapping escapade. In1931, she decided to ignore her own teaching on divorce – she had alwaysinsisted that no divorced person should remarry during the lifetime of the otherpartner – and married an overweight radio announcer named Dave Hutton. Two daysafter the wedding, another woman sued Hutton for $200,000 for breach of promise.When the case was tried, Hutton was ordered to pay $5,000. But when she heardthe news, Aimée fainted and fractured her skull on the flagstone of thecourtyard. She went to Europe to recuperate. Hutton sent her a telegram: ‘Takeyour time, honey . . . Daddy wants a well woman.’ But she and Hutton never livedtogether again.During the remainder of her life she was sued 55 times in the courts of LosAngeles for unpaid bills, broken contracts, slander and other charges. Therewere a number of successful suits by relatives of Temple followers who had lefttheir money to Aimée. She was as flamboyant as ever and as she grew older, herstyle in clothes became increasingly girlish, but the world had ceased to beinterested in her.On the morning of 27 September 1944, Aimée Semple McPherson was foundunconscious in her hotel room in Oakland, California, with sleeping capsulesscattered around her on the floor; she died later in the day. It was neverestablished whether she had taken an overdose deliberately or accidentally."},{"pageContent":"MAXWELL, ROBERTTHE STRANGE DOWNFALL AND DEATH OF A ‘TYCOON’THE STORY BEHIND the drowning of publishing baron Robert Maxwell on 5 November1991 is still a mystery. Since his giant publishing empire had literallycollapsed under him, it may well have been suicide. But then, Maxwell was sowidely detested that there was inevitably speculation whether it might actuallyhave been murder. Accident seems the least likely of the three.Ian Robert Maxwell was born in Slatinske Doly, a Ruthenian village on theCzech-Romanian border, on 10 January 1923. His real name was Jan Ludvik Hoch,and his family were poor Jewish peasants, Mechel Hoch and his wife Hannah.Maxwell once claimed that he had not owned a pair of shoes until he was sevenyears old, and this may well be true. The child’s original name was AbrahamLajbi, but by the time Maxwell was born, his birthplace had changed its positionfrom Hungary to Czechoslovakia, and the Czechs insisted on the change of name.Because the orthodox Jewish community disliked the emphasis on Christianity inthe local school, they organized their own education system, so Maxwell learnedHebrew, and proved to be a brilliant linguist who picked up languages easily.This ability was to launch him on his career as an entrepreneur.When Hitler invaded the Sudetenland in late September 1938, Ruthenia becameHungarian yet again. Since the Hungarian leader, Admiral Nicolas Horthy, was ananti-Semite, and was forcing young Jews into labour battalions, Maxwell’sparents decided to send him to Budapest. His progress during the war isunrecorded, but the Czech unit in which he was fighting was evacuated toLiverpool on the fall of France. Most of Maxwell’s family perished inconcentration camps.Maxwell joined the Pioneer Corps, learned English with ease, and changed hisname to DuMaurier. Always charming, he impressed the brigade commander of theSixth Battalion of the North Staffordshire Regiment and was transferred toIntelligence. In France after D-day, now calling himself Jones, he was promotedto Second Lieutenant, and it was his Brigadier, Carthew-Yourston who suggestedthat he should change his name to Robert Maxwell. In Paris he fell in love withElizabeth Meynard, and married her.He fought with distinction at Paarlo, on the Belgian-Dutch border, and receivedthe military cross for his bravery in leading his platoon in counter-attacks onthe Germans. It was Montgomery himself who presented the medal. The end of thewar saw him in Hamburg, where his position as one of the few Intelligenceofficers who spoke nine languages, including Russian and Polish, made himinvaluable to the British. He served in the Allied Control Commission working asa captain in the Public Relations and Information Services Control, which meantthat, in effect, he became a kind of censor, who had to be approached by anyonewishing to publish books or newspapers. A man named Arno Scholtz applied for alicence to publish a newspaper to be called Der Telegraf, which was granted, andit soon became the best known in Berlin. Maxwell and Scholtz became closefriends, and it was Scholtz who introduced Maxwell to Ferdinand Springer, thehead of Springer Verlag, a publishing company specializing in science – theyeven published Einstein. Soon Maxwell became the British and Americandistributor for Springer, and bought a publisher called Pergamon Press for£13,000. By now, Maxwell had moved back to London. With a fellow Czech namedLow-Bel, he bought German newspapers for sale to prisoners of war in Britain.Springer was delighted to be distributed by this brilliant young man, whoseofficial position meant that he could circumvent the many regulations imposed bythe occupying forces. This was the beginning of Maxwell’s enormous fortune.Soon, Pergamon Press became the most prominent scientific publisher in Britainand, by 1957, was publishing over a hundred books and journals a year.In 1964, Maxwell was elected to the UK Parliament as a Labour member. ButMaxwell was never a popular Member of Parliament. He lacked the kind of tactrequired to be a good politician. Soon he was widely disliked for hisboorishness and his obvious determination to make an impact. His relations withthe Soviet Union were extremely close, partly because Pergamon published so manySoviet scientific journals.It was in May 1968, travelling by train from Moscow to Kiev, that he wasapproached by Zaloman Litvin, a Jewish officer in Soviet military intelligence,who had also been a Soviet spy attempting to steal America’s atomic secrets. Hebrought Maxwell to Moscow, where he was taken to meet Yuri Andropov, head of theKGB. Russia at the time was angry about the ‘Prague Spring’, the attempt of theCzechs to gain a certain freedom from the Russian yoke. Alexander Dubcek wasenormously popular, and the Soviets anticipated having to use force to bring himto heel. They wanted Maxwell’s help in persuading the British Parliament toaccept this. And that is exactly what Maxwell did. When, on 26 August 1968,Russian tanks rolled into Prague and the Czech bid for freedom was crushed,Maxwell stood up in the House of Commons and gave an influential speech,underlining the importance of continuing détente with the Soviets. He carriedthe day, and Labour’s protest to Moscow was feeble.It was in 1969 that Maxwell’s financial methods suddenly became the subject ofharsh criticism. The American company, Leasco, made a takeover bid for PergamonPress, but the accountants concluded that Pergamon’s accounts were fraudulent,and the takeover panel described Maxwell as a liar. The Department of Trade andIndustry declared that Maxwell was not fit to run a public company. In 1970,Maxwell was defeated in the General Election, and ceased to be the Member ofParliament for Buckingham.Maxwell now demanded a favour in return for his support of the Soviets. Heneeded them to bail Pergamon out of trouble. So the Soviet Union agreed thatPergamon should publish biographies of communist leaders, which would bepublished in huge editions of 50,000 each. According to Tom Bower, in Maxwell:the Final Verdict, Maxwell deceived the KGB and Leonid Brezhnev about the numberof copies published. The subsidy from Russia never appeared in Pergamon’saccounts.With the aid of the Communist Bloc, Pergamon was again showing a healthy profitby 1974. And at this time, Maxwell began to show signs of that almost manicdesire to add to his empire – the passion that was finally to bring him down –by buying the British Printing Corporation (BPC) in 1981, then the Mirror GroupNewspapers in 1984. BPC, which was on its last legs when Maxwell took it over,had soon been revived by immense injections of cash borrowed from the banks, whowere deeply impressed by Pergamon’s success.The Daily Mirror was also having problems when Maxwell bought Mirror GroupNewspapers in 1984. Tom Bower has pointed out that Maxwell was jealous of RupertMurdoch’s success, and went out of his way to try and impress him. In February1991, Maxwell rang Murdoch and declared: ‘We’re two big publishers – we shouldtalk.’ Accordingly, Murdoch went to see Maxwell in Maxwell House, making itclear in advance that he only had exactly forty minutes to spare. Maxwellapparently spent the whole forty minutes boasting about his worldwide diplomacy,his intimate relations with the Kremlin, and with the Government of Israel. Atthe end of forty minutes, Murdoch asked: ‘Is there anything else we need to talkabout?’ ‘No,’ said Maxwell. And as Murdoch went down into the street, heexclaimed: ‘What was all that about? He’s ludicrous.’It could have been this desire to rival Murdoch that brought about Maxwell’sdownfall. He bought the American publisher, Macmillan, for $2.6 billion, whichwas generally regarded as paying over the odds, and bought the Official AirlinesGuide for $750 million. He also bought the Berlitz Language School and then theNew York Daily News.Maxwell’s obituary in the Encyclopedia Britannica Yearbook summarizes theproblems that he brought on himself:> The recession and high interest rates reportedly intensified his financial> woes . . . In 1991, to generate cash, Maxwell floated Mirror Group Newspapers> on the London Stock Market and sold part of Pergamon to a Dutch publisher.> Nonetheless in May 1991 he acquired the financially troubled New York Daily> News and was a willing front-page hero. Maxwell continued to shuffle> businesses in and out of both a family trust and holding company, which he had> incorporated (1984) in Liechtenstein, and a Gibraltar-based operation he> opened in May 1991.It adds: ‘The value of Maxwell’s vast holdings was impossible to pin down, butit became clear that his debts exceeded profits.’ In fact, all his life, Maxwellhad shuffled profits in and out of holding companies, so that it was difficultto pin them down. Says John Canning: ‘Huge misappropriations of funds, mostdisgracefully from the Mirror Group Pension Fund, had taken place; the Byzantinestructure of his financial empire with its interlocking complex of private andpublic companies, made it fiendishly difficult to track down the missing moneynow estimated at £2 billion.’The only thing that seems clear is that Maxwell had spent far too much money,and was about to be engulfed by his debts.On the morning of 31 October 1991, Maxwell flew from Luton in his Gulfstream jetto join his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, at Gibraltar. He was suffering from aheavy cold. They set sail at four o’clock that afternoon. Two days later, theyacht put into harbour at Funchal, and Maxwell went for a swim and visited acasino. On Sunday they went on to Tenerife, and the captain, Angus Rankin,reported that Maxwell was in a good mood throughout the cruise, swimming,relaxing, working and taking endless telephone calls. If he was suicidal, hecertainly did not show it.Nevertheless, Maxwell had a great deal on his mind during those last few days.Since the previous November, his companies had been in trouble. The MaxwellCommunications Corporation had been forced to try and raise money, and theinternational banks were worried. His youngest son, Kevin, had been trying topersuade various possible backers that the financial squeeze was only temporary.The truth was that his father was on the edge of bankruptcy. When Credit Suisseturned down a loan of £50 million, Kevin Maxwell told their representative,Julie Maitland, ‘We can provide ample security for the loans.’ But the sharecertificates offered for security were registered in the name of BishopsgateInvestment Management, a private company established by Maxwell to manage ninepension funds of his 23,400 employees. These contained about £727 million. So,in fact, Maxwell was borrowing money from his employees without their knowledge.Moreover, Kevin offered Julia Maitland 500,000 Berlitz shares, owned byMaxwell’s public company, as security for this deal. In effect, the Maxwellswere using money that belonged to the public company for their own privatepurposes.Maxwell had another problem. The American investigative journalist, SeymourHersh, had alleged in his book, The Samson Option, that Maxwell was working forthe Israeli Secret Service, Mossad, and had been responsible for the betrayal ofthe man who had blown the whistle on Israel’s secret nuclear weapon. He wasMordechai Vanunu, a technician who had taken photographs of the Dimona nuclearfacility, and sold them to the Sunday Times. When Vanunu went to London, the daybefore the photographs were published, he was entrapped by a beautiful Israelisecret agent and lured to Rome, where he was drugged, kidnapped, and taken toIsrael. There he was sentenced to eighteen years’ imprisonment. Hersh allegedthat Vanunu’s address in London had been betrayed to Mossad on Maxwell’s ordersby the Daily Mirror’s foreign editor. Maxwell, declaring that the whole thingwas a ‘ludicrous invention’, issued a writ for defamation. But when two Membersof Parliament mentioned the accusation in the House of Commons, they wereprotected by Parliamentary privilege, so that every newspaper was able topublish the allegations.Maxwell’s New York Daily News was also doing badly, its circulation having sunkto the level (720,000) which would allow advertisers to demand refunds. Maxwellasked one of the executives to massage the circulation figures upwards, but hehad refused.As Maxwell’s yacht continued south, Kevin Maxwell rang from London to say that55 bankers were telephoning for reassurances about their loans. Lloyds, to whomMaxwell owed £166 million, flatly turned down a request for a further 10 to 20million.The Credit Suisse, however, lent Maxwell a further £12.8 million, secured byshares that Julia Maitland believed to be owned by Maxwell. Kevin had to exertall his considerable charm to soothe various other bankers from Sumitomo,Salamons, Bank of Nova Scotia, Citibank and Swiss Bank, and managed to get someof the loans rescheduled. Another bank, Goldman Sachs, was also badgeringMaxwell for repayment, and when Maxwell had telephoned the bank a month beforethat last trip, a lawyer there had flatly declined to see Maxwell, saying ‘I’mnot interested – our only interest is in being paid.’ Maxwell demonstrated hisdetermination and persuasive power by walking into the bank and talking theminto accepting a payment of £5 million a week.As Maxwell’s yacht departed, the Financial Times was about to publish a reportrevealing that his debts were double those that he publicly acknowledged.Goldman Sachs decided to start selling Maxwell shares. And on the afternoon ofTuesday 5 November 1991, Maxwell’s company shares were suspended on the StockExchange. Kevin rang his father on his yacht to tell him about this, and thatthe Swiss Bank was threatening to call in the Fraud Squad.At 11:10 on the morning of Tuesday 5 November, a call from New York was putthrough to Maxwell’s stateroom. When there was no reply, Captain Rankin wentdown to investigate and found the cabin door was locked. He entered with themaster key and found it empty. Maxwell’s nightshirt was on the bed.A search of the ship failed to disclose his presence, and at 11:30 am, thecaptain phoned Kevin Maxwell to tell him his father had disappeared.Hours later, a Spanish air-sea rescue helicopter winched the body of RobertMaxwell aboard – all 22 stone of him. It was naked, and had been floating faceup. An autopsy the following day, carried out by Doctor Carlos Lopez de Lamela,Doctor Maria Ramos and Louisa Garcia Cohen revealed little water in Maxwell’slungs, a graze on his forehead, and a cut behind his ear. The result was afinding of natural death – apparently there was no sign of a heart attack. Butthe autopsy reports also revealed that he had a chronic lung disease and a heartailment. Maxwell’s body was flown to Jerusalem, where he was buried.The tone of British obituaries was at first respectful. Maxwell was referred tofrequently by his nickname of ‘Cap’n Bob’, and no one seemed to have any doubtthat, piratical or not, he was a remarkable man. But when the plundering of thepension funds became apparent, the tone changed completely. Maxwell was suddenlyseen for what he was – a crook on a gigantic scale.In due course his two sons, Kevin and Ian, and two directors, went on trial forfraud. At the trial in 1995, Kevin’s defence was that his company had beenplunged into bankruptcy by the City. (Kevin Maxwell had himself gone bankruptfor £406 million.) Kevin and Ian Maxwell and Larry Trachtenberg were all foundnot guilty.How did Maxwell die? A widely held opinion is that it was suicide, but anotherpossibility, mentioned by John Canning in a book on unsolved mysteries, is thathe may have been murdered. Photographs of Maxwell’s body taken during a finalpost-mortem before he was interred show that he was badly bruised. A Frenchpathologist who examined the evidence said that it was probable that Maxwell hadsuffered a violent blow to the back of the head with a weapon. Canning pointsout that if, in fact, Maxwell was an agent for Mossad, and also an arms dealer,he might have been targeted by many Arab organizatons. ‘The slackly guarded,high-profile tycoon in the slow-moving Lady Ghislaine would not have been adifficult “hit” for a group of determined assassins.’But Tom Bower writes:> Distillation of the pathologists’ opinions leads towards the most reliable> conclusion. Feeling unwell, the deceased had been on deck for fresh air.> Stumbling, probably from a minor heart attack, he had fallen backwards,> passing under the steel cord or over the rail and, as he had twisted to grab> it, had hit the side of his head against the boat. In double agony, he had> lost his grip and dropped into the sea. There he died, some time later, from> exhaustion or a heart attack.However, in November 2002, a book by two investigative journalists offered themost astonishing solution to the mystery so far: that Maxwell was murdered by anIsraeli hit team. The book, called The Assassination of Robert Maxwell: Israel’sSuperspy, is by Gordon Thomas and Martin Dillon. They cite various Israelisources and state that, as he realized that he was close to ruin, with debts of£2.2 billion, Maxwell approached Mossad, the intelligence service (for which hehad worked), imploring them to exert their influence with banks in Israel and,if possible, in London and New York, to provide him with money. After anincreasing number of desperate phone calls, he was told that it was impossible:providing that kind of money was simply not in their remit. ‘But he refused toheed the spy chiefs’ implicit warning not to involve them in his personaldisaster’, claim Thomas and Dillon.Maxwell now made his major mistake; he attempted to apply pressure bythreatening to reveal all he had done for Mossad and Israel. What he wanted was£400 million.At that point, Mossad decided that Maxwell had to die. So the assassination wasarranged.It is not surprising that Maxwell seemed cheerful when he set out in his yacht.He believed that an Israeli team was coming on board the Lady Ghislaine in theearly hours of the morning to give him a bank draft for £400 million.That evening, Ian Maxwell made a speech on his father’s behalf at theAnglo-Israeli Association in London. It had gone down well. And when Ian endedthe phone conversation: ‘See you tomorrow, Dad,’ Maxwell responded: ‘You bet.’At 4:25 that morning Maxwell was seen standing on the after deck by the secondengineer, Leo Leonard; he was staring out at the lights of the Gran Canaria.From where he was standing, the security cameras could not have picked him up –which is probably why he often chose that spot to urinate over the side. SeeingLeonard, Maxwell asked him to turn up the air conditioning in his cabin, andLeonard went below to carry out the order.According to Thomas and Dillon, during a trip ashore a few hours earlier,Maxwell had received a call telling him that the packet he was expecting wouldbe delivered on deck between 4 and 5 am.Then, say the authors, a dinghy came alongside from a nearby yacht; it containedthree men in frogmen’s suits. They used rubberized grappling hooks to comesilently on board. One removed a syringe from a rubber pouch on his belt. Withinseconds, the assassin had plunged the syringe into Maxwell’s neck behind hisright ear. It contained a deadly nerve toxin. Maxwell’s unconscious body waslowered into the sea, and within minutes, the assassination team was back onboard their own yacht.When a young Spanish pathologist, Dr Maria Ramos, helped perform the postmortem, she noted the tiny puncture behind the right ear – it looked like amosquito bite. Lacking other evidence, the Spanish team finally decided thatdeath was probably due to heart failure.This version of Maxwell’s death invites a few obvious doubts. Would not Maxwellbe suspicious to be told that three frogmen were coming aboard simply to delivera bank draft? Surely there were simpler ways of handing it over than all thiscloak and dagger stuff? And would the Israeli secret service have murdered oneof their country’s major benefactors? (The answer to that is, sadly, yes –Mossad is known as one of the most ruthless intelligence organizations in theworld.) And what could Maxwell have said that would have embarrassed Mossad sodeeply that they wanted him dead? The answer to that question has probably beenburied with Maxwell.It has to be admitted that this story certainly provides us with a convincingaccount of why and how Robert Maxwell died."},{"pageContent":"MAYERLING AFFAIR, THEDOUBLE-SUICIDE IN A HUNTING LODGETHE SUICIDE OF Archduke Rudolf of Habsburg after killing his eighteen-year-oldmistress has been described as the greatest royal scandal of modern times.If Rudolf had lived, he would have presided over a collapsing empire. Thedynasty of the Habsburgs had dominated Europe for seven hundred years. But bythe end of the nineteenth century, it had spread itself too far; it had too manyill-assorted subjects and great social changes were ripping apart the oldfabric. Subject nations wanted their independence. The 1848 revolution had madethe Emperor Franz Joseph determined to resist all change but it was like tryingto hold on the lid of a pressure cooker by manual force.Franz Joseph was a rigid disciplinarian, who rose at 4 am to work on statepapers; his life was one of exact routine. His empress, Elizabeth, was beautifuland sensitive and she found the atmosphere of her husband’s court – dominated byher mother-in-law – impossible to stomach; she spent most of her time travellingover Europe, permanently dissatisfied.Her eldest son Rudolf had his father’s obstinacy and his mother’s sensitiveness.Born in August 1858, he became an army officer and took pride in the number ofhis sexual conquests, entering their names in a ledger – red for aristocrats,black for commoners. He grew bored with seduction and flirted with left-wingideas. Later, he wrote newspaper articles that revealed he had considerableliterary talent. He was indeed highly intelligent.It seems conceivable that at some point he contracted venereal disease. What iscertain is that he contracted the rich dilettante’s disease of boredom and asense of meaninglessness. ‘He seemed to doubt the validity of everything hedid,’ says one commentator. His father declined to allow him any taste ofresponsibility. At 23 he was married to the 17-year-old Princess Stephanie ofBelgium, a silly, selfish, empty-headed girl, who bore him a daughter. Rudolfbecame increasingly depressed and listless, and began to take morphine. When theGerman emperor inspected Franz Joseph’s army in 1888, he protested that theinfantry ought not to be in the charge of an incompetent like Rudolf; he wasremoved – one more blow to his self-esteem. To some brother officers he made thesurprising proposal of a suicide pact, which they failed to take seriously,although it was reported to the police.His relationship with his father became increasingly bitter. He began to plot,in a rather half-hearted manner, his father’s downfall. His friend Count StephenKárolyi was a Hungarian patriot and he planned to speak in the Hungarianparliament against granting funds to Franz Joseph’s army. Rudolf seems to haveagreed to a hare-brained scheme of Károlyi’s to oust Franz Joseph and put him onthe throne. (It might, in fact, have saved the Austrian Empire if it had everhappened, since Rudolf’s liberal tendencies may have defused the tensions.) Abutler reported that the emperor bitterly upbraided his son for disloyalty.Maria Vetsera was an attractive teenager of Greek extraction, whose mother hadmarried into the minor Austrian nobility. She caught a few glimpses of Rudolf insociety and decided she was passionately in love with him. Through her friend,Countess Marie Larisch, who was Rudolf’s cousin, she succeeded in beingpresented to him in the Prater in Vienna. Rudolf was not one to turn down theopportunity to accept a girl’s virginity when it was offered; the two becamelovers in 1888. By this time he was already brooding on suicide.On 28 January 1889, Rudolf received a telegram from Budapest. As he threw itaside he was heard to mutter, ‘It has to be. There is no other way.’ He spentthe day writing farewell letters, then set out for his hunting lodge atMayerling. He had arranged to meet Maria on the way; that morning, she slippedaway from her mother and made off in a carriage sent by Rudolf. It seems likelythat she had already agreed to the suicide pact. They met at an inn.Rudolf had arranged a hunting party at his lodge and various friends were alsothere. But on 29 January 1889, he protested that he had a cold and stayedindoors. That evening, he dined with Count Hoyos, while Maria stayed upstairs.When Hoyos left, Rudolf’s valet, Loschek, entertained them by singing for them.They both wrote farewell letters – Maria told her sister: ‘We are both goingblissfully into the uncertain beyond . . .’ They then discussed whether theypreferred to die by poison or a bullet and decided on the revolver. Maria notedthis decision on an ashtray. They went up to the bedroom where Rudolf shot Mariaimmediately. He himself waited until six in the morning, when he went downstairsand told Loschek to prepare breakfast. He returned to his room, drank a glass ofbrandy, and shot himself in the head. The bodies were discovered a few hourslater.Franz Joseph was deeply shocked by the news, and the empress broke down when sheread Rudolf’s farewell letter. At first the court insisted that Rudolf had diedof heart failure but the truth could not be held back for ever. There was awrangle with the Cardinal Secretary of State, Rampolla, as to whether Rudolfcould be buried in consecrated ground as he had committed suicide. Eventually hewas laid to rest in the Capucin Crypt in Vienna. Maria’s naked body was throwninto a woodshed immediately after she was discovered and was not recovered fortwo days.It is still not clear why Rudolf killed himself and why he, a Catholic, chose todie with the murder of Maria Vetsera on his conscience. The answer to the latterquestion may be that he was a physical coward and wanted someone else to diewith him. He was probably not in love with Maria for he had spent the nightbefore leaving Vienna with a prostitute named Mizzi Kaspter. It seemsconceivable that she was as anxious to die with the man she adored as he was tohave someone to die with him. He may even have felt he was conferring a favouron her by involving her in the suicide pact – after all, he was heir to thethrone and she was a nobody.In 1983, ex-Empress Zita, the last survivor of the Habsburg monarchy, caused asensation when she announced that the double-suicide was really a politicalmurder. She claimed that she had received this information from her husband,Emperor Karl, and from Prince Rudolf’s sisters, Archduchess Gisela andArchduchess Marie-Valerie and her aunts Archduchess Maria Theresa and theDuchess Marie-Jose. ‘I have recorded precisely everything that was told to meunder the seal of deepest sympathy. I intend to publish these documents whichare among my personal papers when the time is right.’ According to theex-Empress, Prince Rudolf was assassinated because of his republican sympathiesand because he had made many political enemies. In a cloister built out of partof the hunting lodge, Carmelite nuns in a silent order still pray day and nightfor the ‘three dead’ of Mayerling. Why three, rather than two, remains anothermystery; according to some, Maria Vetsera was expecting Rudolf’s child.The Empress points out that an enormous amount of documentation has disappearedfrom the state archives, including a 2,000-word telegram which the Emperor sentto Pope Leo XIII arguing that in spite of the official suicide explanation, hisson had a right to a Christian burial. This telegram has also disappeared fromthe Vatican archives.In September 1898, the Empress Elizabeth was stepping into a boat at Geneva whenshe was stabbed to death by a young anarchist named Luigi Lucheni. There werethose who felt her death was a release. Since Rudolf’s suicide she had beenwandering all over Europe like an unhappy shade.Rudolf was succeeded as heir to the throne by his cousin, Archduke FranzFerdinand. It was the assassination of the archduke and his wife at Sarajevo on28 June 1914 that precipitated World War I, and brought about the finaldestruction of the Austrian Empire."},{"pageContent":"NOYES, JOHN HUMPHREYTHE ONEIDA COMMUNITY – PROMISCUITY JUSTIFIED BY THE SCRIPTURESTO HIS DISCIPLES, John Humphrey Noyes was an inspired prophet and a greatspiritual leader but to most of his contemporaries he was a libertine whosedoctrines of free love and ‘complex marriage’ were a danger to the community.There were many strange religious communities in America in the nineteenthcentury: the Shakers (so called because they went into convulsions of religiousecstasy that made them shake all over), the Ephrata, the Rappites, Zoarites andmany others. Most of these were ‘Perfectionists’ – that is, they rejected thenotion that man is a miserable sinner as unnecessarily pessimistic and taughtthat, through Divine Grace, man can achieve perfection. The Shakers believedthat God is both male and female by nature, so women were as important as men intheir religious rites, many of which looked like orgies. But the Shakers taughtthe importance of strict chastity.The 1830s and 1840s were a time of tremendous religious revivals in America, tosuch an extent that one portion of New York State was known as the Burnt OverRegion because the fires of revivalism had burned so fiercely there. Men likeHiram Sheldon, Erasmus Stone and Jarvis Rider preached their gospel in thecotton village of Manlius and their converts adopted the name of the Saints. Oneof the subjects that fascinated them was whether the old marriage vows wouldstill be binding when the New Heaven and New Earth arrived. (Most of the greatreligious revivals were based on the conviction that the Day of Judgment wasjust around the corner.) It was John Humphrey Noyes who provided a startling andcontroversial answer to that question.John Humphrey Noyes was born at Brattleboro, Vermont, the son of a congressman;he studied law, then divinity. He was a man of considerable magnetism andremarkable intellect and he seems to have spent the two years following hisconversion (at the age of twenty) in religious broodings and wrestlings. Hefound that he simply could not accept that he was a miserable sinner. Then, whenhe was 22, the answer suddenly revealed itself to him in a blinding flash ofrevelation. Reading the Gospel of St John, he could see clearly that Jesus hadannounced the Second Coming within one generation of his own lifetime – that is,in the year AD 70. But if Jesus had already come to earth, then the Kingdom ofGod was already here. In that case, why was there so much sin on earth? Theanswer must be because people were unaware of the Second Coming. This, Noyescould now see and explained why he himself could never feel that he was asinner. He wasn’t. He was already saved. All he had to do was to live accordingto the gospels and nothing could go wrong.The Bible said that in heaven there would be no marriage or giving in marriage.The Shakers also accepted this and for them it meant an obligation to celibacy.Noyes did not agree. Sex is obviously necessary to continue the race. What theBible meant was obviously that all men were married to all women and vice versa.In The Battle Axe, the newspaper of the Perfectionists, he published in 1837 aletter in which he explained that ‘at the marriage supper of the Lamb . . .every dish is free to every guest.’ Sexual intercourse is one of the best thingsof life – men and women were intended to ‘reflect upon each other the love ofGod’. Sexual shame was a consequence of the Fall, so all the Saved should nowabandon it. Men and women should have sex together just as they felt inclined,regarding it as a sacrament.At the age of 23, Noyes returned to his home in Putney, Vermont, and preachedhis views; he converted a number of his own family. He married the daughter ofthe state governor and one of his disciples, J.L. Skinner, married his sister.In 1840, Noyes and a number of disciples founded the Putney Community, whichconsisted of seven houses and a store on five hundred acres of fertile land.They spent the afternoons in manual labour to support themselves and the rest ofthe time in debate, prayer, reading, and teaching various subjects, includingLatin, Greek and Hebrew.Meanwhile, Noyes continued to brood on the problems posed by his doctrines of‘free love’. In 1846, he saw the answer. The problem with sexual intercourse wasthat it often produced unwanted results in the form of children. Mrs HarrietNoyes had produced five babies in six years and four had been stillborn. Theanswer was simple. Men and women should have full sexual intercourse, withorgasm taking place in the vagina only when they wished to produce children. Forthe rest of the time, the man must teach himself continence – not abstention. Hecould place his penis in the vagina but he must exercise severe self-disciplinenot to have an emission. It was a method that would later become known as thekarezza, a term invented by Dr Alice Bunker Stockham of Ohio. Noyes pointed outthat this method ‘vastly increases pleasure’ (his italics). This doctrine wascomplemented by the notion of ‘complex marriage’ – that every man should regardall women as his wives and vice versa.Noyes was not a man to keep his ideas secret – religious prophets seldom are –and he preached ‘male continence’ (i.e. the karezza) and ‘complex marriage’quite openly. His neighbours were naturally outraged at what they took to be apublic rejection of all decency. (Even nowadays, a community with these ideaswould probably have a hard time of it if they lived in the vicinity of a smalltown.) There was public outrage and the following year, Noyes was indicted on acharge of adultery. He decided that his great vision was too important to bedestroyed by a few bigots. Fortunately, some of his disciples had already set upa community near Oneida Lake, about sixty miles away, with 23 acres of land. In1847, Noyes and his disciples moved there and set up the Oneida Community.What followed was a typical American success story – success preceded bydisappointment and hard work. There were only two log houses, a log hut and anold sawmill; the disciples were obliged to sleep in garrets and outhouses foranother twelve years. There were many hardships until an inventor called SewellNewhouse joined the community; he saved it from bankruptcy by inventing a steeltrap which the community proceeded to manufacture. They made travelling bags,satchels, preserved fruit and silk, and their workmanship made them widelyknown. They acquired more land and more people joined them. Two years after thecommunity was formed, another branch was started at Brooklyn, and then others atWallingford, Newark, Putney, Cambridge and Manlius. By 1878 there were overthree hundred members. They had built a large brick house in which they alllived. They had factories, offices, a school, a carpenter’s shop, barns andstables. The Mansion House – the main building – was centrally heated, withbaths and labour-saving kitchens. The community also employed over two hundredworkers from outside and treated them well.The aspect that has chiefly interested posterity was the sexual innovation. Anyman could propose love-making to any woman (or, indeed, vice versa) and she wasfree to reject him. Oddly enough, direct courtship was not allowed – a man whowanted to sleep with a woman had to approach her through the intermediary of athird person. What ‘male continence’ (or coitus reservatus) meant in practicewas that the man put his penis into the woman’s vagina, then they lay still foranything up to an hour and a quarter. The woman was allowed to climax but theman was not expected to do so – even after withdrawal – Noyes denounced RobertDale Owen’s idea of coitus interruptus as ‘Male incontinence plus evasion’. Themale was supposed to stay in the woman until he lost his erection and this wasbelieved to obviate any frustration and nervous tension. Noyes claimed that hiscommunity had a far better record of less nervous illness than the outsidecommunity while failing to recognize that there may have been other explanationsfor the situation.As a system of sexual and moral hygiene ‘complex marriage’ seems to have beenhighly successful. Boys lost their virginity soon after puberty, girls somewhatlater. An older person of the opposite sex was generally chosen to initiate theyoung – one of the aspects of ‘complex marriage’ that horrified the ‘outsideworld’ which felt a mixture of envy and moral indignation at the idea of amiddle-aged man or woman being allowed to deflower a fifteen-year-old. Onevisitor wrote: ‘The majority of the old women are hideous and loathsome inappearance and it seems to me the most horrible fate in the world to be linkedwith them.’ But Noyes himself, as the father of the community (he was even knownas Father Noyes), naturally had a wider freedom of choice than most – after theage of 58 he fathered eight children. It is not clear whether this wasaccidental or intentional. The community practised eugenics – which Noyes calledstirpiculture – and at one stage, 24 men and 20 women were selected for anexperiment in selective breeding. But ‘accidents’ also happened – on average oneevery eighteen months.Accounts of the community make clear that it was not a sexual free-for-all. Thewomen dressed modestly, looking rather like the Chinese in long white trouserscovered by a skirt. Any tendency by a couple to fall in love was regarded asselfish and ‘idolatrous’, and was discouraged by the system of ‘mutualcriticism’, which usually meant that the person to be criticized was summonedbefore a committee, who then detailed his or her faults. People often requestedmutual criticism just as someone today might go to a psychiatrist. One historianof the movement, Mark Holloway in Heavens on Earth (1951) has recorded that itwas also used successfully to cure physical ailments, demonstrating that FatherNoyes also understood about psychosomatic illness. There was one case in which‘mutual criticism’ went further: when William Mills, a man in his early 60s –with an unattractive wife – tried to initiate more than his share of teenagevirgins with the aid of sweets and alcohol, and as a result was hurledunceremoniously into a snowdrift.Close attachments among children were also discouraged as selfish, which causeda certain amount of heartache. Otherwise, the children had an enviably pleasanttime. They were allowed to sleep as late as they liked in the morning and therewere dances, plays, pantomimes and other forms of entertainment for them. Norwere they deprived of parental affection. A mother weaned her child, then placedit in the Children’s House where, until the age of three, it spent the daylighthours. After that children also spent the night there but parents could visitthem as often as they liked and take them for walks. They left the Children’sHouse at fourteen, when they were ready for sexual initiation and to join theadult community.The adults also had a pleasant time of it once the community waswell-established. Most members were supervisors rather than workers and theycould change their jobs to avoid monotony. Times of meetings, amusements andmeals were also changed for the same reason. There was fishing, hunting, boatingand swimming at Oneida Lake, twelve miles away, and they could visit othercommunities.The only real problem was the attitude of the outside world. The Americanconstitution allowed for religious freedom but flagrant sexual immorality wasquite another thing. One of the community’s chief enemies was Professor John W.Mears, of Hamilton College, who denounced it as ‘a Utopia of obscenity’. ThePresbyterian Synod of Central New York appointed a committee of seven toinvestigate the activities of the community but was unsuccessful in destroyingit. Eventually, the community began to decay from within. Many younger membersthought that Noyes’s religious doctrines were absurd; some were even agnostics(Noyes allowed members to study Huxley and Darwin). Noyes wanted to retire andappointed his agnostic son, Dr Theodore Noyes, to take his place but this causeddissension. Some members of the community even sided with the puritanical DrMears. Noyes finally slipped quietly away from Oneida and moved to Niagara Fallsin 1876 at the age of 65. It became clear that if Oneida wanted to survive, itwould have to stop outraging the outside world with its sexual freedom. ‘Complexmarriage’ was abandoned; the alternatives offered were celibacy or marriage andmost preferred marriage. But to try to suppress ‘complex marriage’ wastantamount to removing one of the main foundations of the community. ‘TheCommunity sank step by step into its own Dark Ages,’ says one historian. The oldgenerosity of spirit vanished, so that ‘it was almost impossible to borrow ahammer from one’s next door neighbour’. In 1881, the Oneida Community wasreorganized as a joint stock company, and ‘communism’ was abandoned. Childrenwere still educated free until they were sixteen, then they were given $200 togive them a ‘start in life’. ‘An arid commercialism’ replaced the old communalspirit and the community began to split up. Yet the original Oneida branchremained commercially successful.Noyes died in 1886 still believing firmly that the community had been ordainedby God; praise and violent criticism continued long after his death. One Englishvisitor had described him as ‘a tall, pale man, with sandy hair and beard, grey,dreamy eyes, good mouth, white temples and a noble forehead.’ But the secularistCharles Bradlaugh was to describe him as ‘singularly unloveable, with hisprotruding, stuckout lower lip, his tired satyr-like leer . . . an eccentricgoatish half-inch stripe of beard running from ear to ear.’ Yet 53 young womenhad once signed a resolution declaring that they belonged to him as ‘God’s truerepresentative’, and that they were perfectly happy for him to decide which ofthe male members of the community were to father their children. It cannot bedenied that Noyes was one of the most remarkable visionaries to come out ofAmerica in the nineteenth century."},{"pageContent":"PAEDOPHILE PRIESTSTHE CATHOLIC CHURCH CHILD-ABUSE SCANDALIN 1318, BISHOP Jacques Fournier of Pamiers started a six-year inquisition inthe village of Montaillou, in the Pyrenees, to detect signs of the heresy calledCatharism. Fournier made meticulous notes during his inquisition and the resultwas a series of documents that (among other things) revealed some astonishingsex scandals involving priests. When historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie publisheda book, Montaillou (trans Barbara Bray, Penguin Books, London: 1989), aboutFournier’s inquisition, it became an instant best-seller in France. Passageslike this, about a sub-deacon called Arnaud de Verniolles, explain why: ‘Arnaudthreatened me with a knife, twisted my arm, dragged me by force despite mystruggles, threw me down and made love to me, kissing me and ejecting his spermbetween my legs.’Arnaud, the book reveals, had been introduced to sodomy when he was eleven, andsharing a bed with an older fellow pupil. The book also makes it clear that thelocal priest treated the women of the village as a kind of harem.A book by Francine du Plessix Gray called At Home with the Marquis De Sade(Penguin Books, London: 1999) makes it clear that four centuries later moralitywithin the Church was just as lax. Sade’s uncle, the Abbé Jacques-Francois-Paulde Sade, was known as ‘the priest of Epicurus’, and had a full sex life and manymistresses, including a live-in mother and daughter and the housemaid. Becausehe had once been arrested in a raid on a Paris brothel, he kept away from thecapital and ‘confined his lust to Provence’, writes Gray.She also quotes an edict of the Avignon pope aimed at raising money for theChurch, which begins: ‘A nun who has given herself to several men,simultaneously or successively, within or outside her monastery, and wishes toachieve the rank of abbess, will pay 131 livres 15 sous.’ A list of prices forabsolution for sins of fornication ends: ‘add an extra four livres for incest’.A sex scandal that erupted in Boston, Massachusetts in 2002 made it clear thatthe Catholic Church still displayed an attitude of tolerance towards immoralpriests, and went to great lengths to protect them from censure and publicexposure. It was discovered that decades earlier, in 1960, a decree calledCrimen Sollicitationis had been sent to bishops all over the world, withinstructions that it was to be kept under lock and key in their safes. It said,in effect, that all victims of sexual abuse by priests were to be ordered toremain silent under threat of excommunication. The Vatican official in charge ofthis policy was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who would become Pope Benedict XVI onthe death of John Paul II in May 2005. One of the first things he did onbecoming pope was to issue a decree reinforcing Crimen. But this new decreecontained an important addition. All cases of sexual abuse by priests were to bereferred direct to the Vatican, and not discussed elsewhere or with the locallegal authorities. The Vatican, it said, had ‘exclusive competence’, whichmeant, in effect, exclusive powers of cover-up.Crimen Sollicitationis only came to light in 2002 as the result ofinvestigations into a series of sex scandals in the Boston area. One of thepriests at the centre of the numerous allegations that came to light that yearwas Paul Shanley, who would be sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in February2005 for the homosexual rape of a minor. Yet in 1977, in Rochester, N.Y., he hadmade a public speech promoting paedophilia, incest and bestiality.Shanley, who was known as the ‘Street Priest’ because he spent much of his timetrying to rescue people on the streets, could be seen as a descendant of theBeat Generation of the 50s and 60s, and was quite open about his homosexuality,even running a bed and breakfast facility for gay customers near San Bernardino,California, in the 1990s.The number of cases of sexual abuse by Catholic priests that came to light in2002 led to the setting up of a National Review Board in the United States totry to establish the extent of the problem. It soon became clear that abusewithin the Church was not confined to one area, but to the whole United States(or in fact the whole world), and that the statistics for every diocese showedremarkable regularity from coast to coast. But what caused most indignation wasthe revelation that priests who had committed child abuse were not punished, butwere usually moved to another parish, where they could simply continue theirpaedophile activities.On 28 October 2006, Pope Benedict XVI went belatedly on record in a meeting witha group of visiting Irish bishops, expressing his personal ‘anguish and horror’about another sex abuse scandal that had shaken the Church in 2002, this time inFerns, Co. Wexford, Ireland.That scandal began when a priest named Father Sean Fortune was exposed as along-time paedophile. One of the victims who decided to break his silence wasColm O’Gorman, who, at the age of fourteen, had been repeatedly abused byFortune. He told how Fortune would get up at dawn to go and say early mass,leaving him in bed, and would then return to bed and often abuse him againbefore breakfast, after which the boy had to go to church and watch the priestperforming mass again. Fortune was already known to the Church authorities as apaedophile, but whenever he had been exposed in the past, he had been moved toanother parish. Fortune committed suicide on the eve of his trial. As a resultof the scandal, his bishop, Brendan Comiskey, was summoned to Rome, anddismissed.The Ferns Report, published in 2005, spoke of more than a hundred allegationsagainst priests in the Ferns diocese in the forty years from 1962 to 2002, andinvolving 26 priests. It was as a result of the Ferns inquiry that the publicbecame aware of the existence of Crimen Sollicitationis, and of the Vatican’sdecree that any sex scandals that came to light should be suppressed. The excusegiven for this policy was that the Vatican wanted time to look into theallegations. In fact, it was applied in many cases as the instrument of acover-up, and on occasion accused priests were even moved to Rome and shelteredunder the aegis of the policy.One Irish victim, Aiden Doyle, was a pupil at a Catholic boarding school run bypriests. One Saturday afternoon, a priest entered his room to ‘help him with hismusic’. Doyle, then fourteen, was made to lie on the bed and to grope hisgenitals. As soon as he escaped from the room, Doyle told another priest whathad happened. He was told solemnly that the seal of the confessional was to beapplied to him, and that if he ever spoke of what had happened, it would meanexcommunication from the Church. The abuse continued to occur on Saturdayafternoons, creating misery and guilt for Doyle, and it was forty years beforehe decided to speak out. His abuser was never punished.In the US, a former Benedictine monk named Patrick Wall was in charge ofapplying Crimen in his Minnesota diocese. With a budget (in 1996) of $7 million,his job was to move quickly when a scandal threatened to become public, and makesure it was silenced. Eventually he left the job in disgust and joined lawyersacting for victims.One of his cases concerned an Irish priest, Father Oliver O’Grady, who had beenworking in California and who was accused of sodomizing a boy over a hundredtimes. It was alleged that he had abused more than thirty victims, both boys andgirls (but three-quarters of them boys). After serving seven years in jail, hewas deported back to Ireland, but the Irish police were not informed of hisstatus as a sex criminal, so O’Grady was free to continue to molest children.Frank Keating, chairman of the National Review Board, was obliged to resignafter remarking in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that the actions ofthe Catholic Church in enforcing silence about the sex crimes of priests couldbe compared to those of la Cosa Nostra – the Mafia. District Attorney RickRomley, of Phoenix, Arizona, can testify to the veracity of Keating’s remark. Hehas convicted eight paedophile priests in his diocese to date, and succeeded inforcing a confession from the local bishop that he had knowingly protected childsex abusers from the police. Romley said ‘Obstruction from Church authoritiesduring investigations was unparalleled in my entire career as DistrictAttorney.’In the US, as in Ireland, some priests fled to the Vatican for protection. Oneof the US priests who succeeded in fleeing the country was Father Joseph Henn,who had left for Rome when his paedophile activities with altar boys wereuncovered. There he was able to obtain protection in the headquarters of hisorder, the Salvatoreans. Romley wrote to Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the VaticanSecretary of State, asking that Henn be made to return to America to facecharges. Sodano refused to accept the letter and returned it unopened.It seems, then, that whatever protestations of shock and horror are professed byPope Benedict XVI, the Vatican currently has no intention of altering its policyof protection towards paedophile priests."},{"pageContent":"POLANSKI, ROMANTHE RAPE CASEROMAN POLANSKI’S LIFE as a successful Hollywood film director came to an endabruptly one day in 1977, when he was arrested and charged with drugging andraping a thirteen-year-old girl.Polanski’s own version of what happened is told in his autobiography Roman(1984).Polanski was the enormously successful director of films like Repulsion (1965),Rosemary’s Baby (1968) and Chinatown (1974).In 1977, Polanski was doing a photographic assignment for Vogue. It wasPolanski’s own idea to do a feature on some adolescent girls. A friend suggesteda thirteen-year-old girl named Samantha Gailey, the daughter of an aspiringactress. Polanski drove out to the house one afternoon, and was introduced toher. They drove up into the hills, where Polanski took some photographs. Henoticed a bruise on her neck, and she told him that it was a love bite, given toher by her boyfriend, with whom she admitted having spent the night in hermother’s house when he was sleeping on the settee, and she went and joined him.The next time Polanski filmed her was in a house belonging to the film star JackNicholson. On the way there, Polanski asked her when she had first had sex, andshe admitted casually that it was at the age of eight, with a boy down thestreet.He decided to take some shots in the jacuzzi. He snapped photographs of the girlnaked in the water, drinking a glass of champagne. After that, Polanski divedinto the swimming pool. When he got out, the girl and he dried one another‘then, very gently, I began to kiss and caress her. After this had gone on forsome time, I led her over to the couch.‘There was no doubt about her experience, and lack of inhibition. She spreadherself and I entered her. She wasn’t unresponsive. Yet when I asked her softlyif she was liking it, she resorted to her favourite expression: “It’s allright.”’Afterwards, he drove her home, and showed her mother the photographs he’d taken.She seemed to like them. But later, the friend who had first mentioned the girlrang up to say that the mother was furious and thought the photographs were‘horrible’. Polanski was puzzled, since the mother herself had seemed to likethem.The following day, about to leave his hotel lobby, he was accosted by a man whoshowed him a badge and told him he was from the Los Angeles Police Department.He said that he was arresting him for rape.In an interview with Martin Amis which took place in 1979 in Paris, Polanskiremarks that when he was being driven to the police station the car radio wasalready talking about his arrest. ‘I thought, you know, I was going to wake upfrom it. I realised, if I had killed somebody, it wouldn’t have had so muchappeal to the police, you see? But . . . fucking, you see, and young girls.Judges want to fuck young girls. Juries want to fuck young girls – everyonewants to fuck young girls! No, I knew then that this is going to be another big,big thing.’At the trial, Polanski was found guilty of having sex with a minor, and allowedbail to go and direct a film for Dino de Laurentiis in Tahiti, Hurricane. Infact, he never made the film, but instead went to Paris, the city of his birth.Roman Polanski had been born there on 18 August 1933; his father RyszardPolanski (who also called himself Liebling) was a painter and plasticsmanufacturer. His Russian wife, like her husband, was Jewish. Because of arising anti-Semitism in France, the family returned to Poland in 1937. But whenthe war broke out, they were confined to the Polish ghetto in Krakow, and werethere until 1941, when both his parents were thrown into concentration camps.His father had cut the wire around the ghetto and pushed Roman out, telling himto run away. Later, Roman saw his father being marched away, in a column ofother Jews. When Roman tried to speak to him, his father hissed: ‘Push off.’His father had made plans for Roman’s survival in case he himself was arrested.A couple named Wilk would take him in and look after him. They were reassured bythe fact that Roman did not look Jewish.Polanski’s mother, who was pregnant, would die in a gas chamber in Auschwitz.His father survived the war, dying in 1984.From the beginning, Roman had been obsessed by films. He was given pocket moneyby the Wilks, and since the cinema was cheap, was able to see a great many ofthe pre-war classics. Out of the tea caddy he found on a rubbish dump, he triedto make himself a movie projector. Soon after that, Roman was sent out of thecity to live in the country with a poor peasant family, where he learnedsomething about farming and the care of cattle. He returned to Krakow, butduring one of the last German air raids, was blown through a lavatory door by aGerman bomb. And at the age of sixteen, he had a close brush with death when hewas persuaded to enter a bunker by a man who began to beat him over the headwith a rock. With blood pouring from his head, he succeeded in escaping. The manwas arrested later, and proved to have committed three murders.The Russians entered Krakow, and although they were capable of rape and a greatdeal of thieving, they were kind to children, and in the famine which followedthe German withdrawal, organized soup kitchens. And one day, his father returnedfrom the concentration camp. He had been well fed by the Americans, and lookedtanned and healthy.Back at school, Polanski continued to see as many films as possible – he sawOlivier’s Hamlet twenty times, and then went on to read all Shakespeare’s playsin Polish.Polanski became a child actor by accident. There was a weekly radio programmecalled The Merry-go-round, which went out from Krakow, and one day, the publicwas allowed in to visit the studio. Polanski was asked what he thought of theprogramme, and said he thought it was awful. Asked if he could do any better, heproceeded to recite a peasant monologue, which led to his being hired on thespot. Polanski went on to get the lead role in a play about a boy who was aregimental mascot. When the play was presented in Warsaw, Polanski won a cashaward, which was shared out among the cast.His drawings led to his acceptance in the school of fine art, while his stageexperience brought an offer of a part in a film being made by some Lodz filmstudents. After this, Polanski applied for a place in the Krakow Drama Schoolbut was rejected because of his size. This was a disaster, because unless hecould get into some kind of educational establishment, he would be called up todo his National Service, and any hope of an acting career would be over.Fortunately, at the last moment, he received a phone call from a cameraman heknew, telling him that a director called Andrzej Wajda was making hisfull-length feature film, and had a part for Polanski. It was a film with aCommunist ideology content, but Wajda’s realism turned A Generation (1954) intoa masterpiece, which made his reputation.Polanski spent the next five years at the Lodz Film School, and made a number ofshort films that immediately revealed his talent – Two Men and a Wardrobe beginswith two men staggering out of the sea carrying a wardrobe. This won a prize atthe 1958 Brussels World Fair. Short films that followed, The Fat and the Thinand Mammals, showed strong surrealistic influence, and increased his reputation.He also married for the first time. His wife, Barbara, was an exceptionallybeautiful actress, and in 1959, they went to Paris, hoping that she would have afilm career. Although her lack of knowledge of French was an obstacle, shefinally landed a small part as an au pair girl. They managed to stay on in Parisby borrowing money.They returned to Poland, and here at last Polanski’s career took off with hisfilm Knife in the Water (1962) a drama of sexual rivalry in which a young couplepick up a hitchhiker and invite him for a weekend on their yacht. Thisfull-length film already contains the essence of Polanski – a certain obsessive,subjective quality, and the Polish film critics predictably hated it – itsmessage was not sufficiently optimistic and socially committed. It neverthelessgained a prize at the Venice Film Festival, and brought Polanski a degree ofinternational recognition. It was even nominated for an Oscar, which Fellinieventually won with his film 8½.Polanski was now bankable, but was finding it extremely difficult to raise themoney to make a film that was to be about two gangsters on the run who gettrapped on an island. (This finally became Cul de Sac.) But in London, he wasapproached by a group who ran a Soho Cinema Club which specialized in mildlypornographic movies. This was the ‘Compton Group’, and it was they who offeredPolanski to finance a cheap horror movie made in black and white. Polanskidecided he could probably make something worthwhile out of it, and although theCompton Group became desperate as he overran his budget as well as his time withhis careful and precise scene setting, Repulsion (1965) was an instant success.It is about a beautiful and neurotic girl who is terrified of sex, and whomurders her boyfriend and then her landlord. There is little dialogue, and theaction seems curiously unmotivated, but the film has undoubted power.It made him enough money and reputation to be able to persuade the same group toback his film about the two gangsters. The shooting of Cul de Sac on theScottish island of Lindisfarne was something of a disaster, and Polanski’sdescription in his autobiography Roman is brilliantly funny. Unfortunately, thefilm left the critics completely bewildered, and was a commercial flop.The same thing, unfortunately, applied to his next film The Fearless VampireKillers (1967), a spoof of Dracula which showed an extraordinary lapse ofjudgement – at that time audiences wanted to be scared by vampires, not to makefun of them. The star was the beautiful blonde Sharon Tate. Issued in America asPardon Me, Your Teeth Are In My Neck, it deservedly flopped, although Polanskiprotests that it was so hacked and changed that he felt ashamed of it. (Hisoriginal version became a cult success in later years.)But as soon as he read Ira Levin’s novel Rosemary’s Baby, about a young couplewho become involved with a group of devil worshippers, he was instantly grippedby it. Again, there were problems in the making, and at one stage he was almostsacked because he was taking too long and overrunning the budget. Nevertheless,the film justified the care he put into it, and was a box-office hit. It madethe reputation of Mia Farrow as an actress, but also broke up her marriage withFrank Sinatra, who wanted her to work on a film he was making, The Detective,and had her presented with divorce papers when she refused to walk off the set.By this time, Polanski was married to Sharon Tate, the actress who had played inThe Fearless Vampire Killers.In February 1969, the Polanskis rented a house off Benedict Canyon from TerryMelsher, the impresario of the Beach Boys. Two of their friends looked after thehouse during their frequent absences: Wojtek Frykowski, who had worked on filmswith Polanski in Poland, and the coffee heiress Abigail Folger.On the evening of 8 August 1969, Sharon Tate, who was eight and a half monthspregnant, was giving dinner to her house-sitters and to a former lover calledJay Sebring, a fashionable hair-stylist. Three people entered the house – a manand two women, who were followers of the paranoid ‘messiah’ Charles Manson. Theysaw Frykowski asleep on the settee; then he woke up and asked ‘Who are you?’ andthe man answered, ‘I am the devil, and I’m here on the devil’s business.’ Theyproceeded to tie his hands with a towel. One of the women, Susan Atkins, wassent upstairs to see how many people there were in the house, and glanced intoAbigail Folger’s bedroom. Abigail, high on MDMA, gazed back at her and smiled.When Susan Atkins reported to the man, Tex Watson, that there were three morepeople upstairs, he ordered her to bring them down. She did this by threateningthem with a knife. Sebring tried to grab Watson’s gun, and was shot through thelung. Then Watson looped the length of a long nylon rope they had brought roundSebring’s neck, and threw the other end over a beam; he then tied it round thenecks of the other two women. Frykowski succeeded in running into the garden,but Susan Atkins pursued him and stabbed him in the back. Indoors, Watson shotFrykowski twice then beat him over the head with the jammed gun. The two womenwere struggling to free themselves, and Abigail Folger got as far as the gardenbefore she was also stabbed several times by Susan Atkins. Then Watson, SusanAtkins and a third woman, Patricia Krenwinkel, joined in stabbing the pregnantSharon Tate to death. Sixteen wounds were later found on her body. Susan Atkinsdipped a towel in Sharon Tate’s blood and daubed the word ‘pig’ on the livingroom door.Polanski was in London when he heard the news by telephone. He was so dazed thathe began banging his head against the wall and had to be held back by film starWarren Beatty, and part-owner of the Playboy Club, Victor Lownes. Completelyshattered, Polanski flew back to Los Angeles. There the general theory seemed tobe that these four victims, together with a youth called Stephen Parent, who hadbeen visiting the houseboy when he was shot by Watkins, were generally believedto have been high on drugs, and their death was attributed to some quarrel withdrug dealers. Polanski himself was even asked to take a lie detector test tomake sure that he had no connection with the murders. Most of the newspapers andmagazines drew attention to the similarity of the murder scene and Polanski’sown films.Manson’s killers had gone on to commit another murder the following evening – asupermarket owner called Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary. This time Mansonhimself was present; he went into their bedroom and tied them up, then orderedhis followers to go in and kill them. All were high.Two and a half months later, in October, Manson and his followers were arrested– but not for the murders. The ‘family’ were living on a deserted farm in DeathValley, and had been charged with destroying a bulldozer by setting it on fire,an act of gratuitous drugged-induced vandalism. They were also suspected ofmurdering a musician named Gary Hinman. In prison, Susan Atkins confided to hercellmate that she had taken part in the Sharon Tate killings. The Manson familywent on trial in 1970, and were condemned to death, although the sentences weresubsequently commuted to life imprisonment. Watson was tried separately andcharged with seven counts of murder, and he was also sentenced to death,although it was commuted.Polanski had been about to make a film called The Day of the Dolphin at the timeof the murders, but when he encountered problems with the film company, UnitedArtists, he decided to drop it; in any case, he had no heart for work.In an attempt to forget the tragedy, Polanski went to make a film in Italycalled What? He describes this as: ‘A ribald Rabelaisian account of theadventures of a fey, innocent girl, wholly unaware of the sort of company thatsurrounds her in a weird Riviera villa inhabited exclusively by phallocrats.’ Inspite of having Marcello Mastroianni in the lead, this flopped. And so did asubsequent film of Macbeth, written by Polanski and the critic Kenneth Tynan.Critics generally felt that it was too realistically bloody and violent. But hisnext film, Chinatown (1974), a superbly made detective story in the tradition ofRaymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett was perhaps his greatest success so far,and is regarded by many as his best film. It received six academy awardnominations.His next venture was a French film called The Tenant, in which Polanski himselfplayed the lead, a Polish-born bank clerk whose mental stress leads totransvestism and suicide. Badly received at the Cannes Film Festival in May1976, it received harsh reviews, one critic saying that it was like Repulsionwith Polanski in the part of Catherine Deneuve, but not as good.It was while in France that Polanski received an invitation to be the guesteditor of the Christmas 1976 issue of Vogue, and it was this that led to thedisastrous encounter with the Californian nymphet that caused Polanski to fleeto France, and make his home in Paris.Polanski’s next film, shot in France, was Thomas Hardy’s Tess (1979). Theheroine was played by Nastassja Kinski, the daughter of actor Klaus Kinski, withwhom Polanski had had a relationship since 1975, when she was fifteen. Theshooting, as usual, took far longer than intended, and went wildly over budget.The four-hour film, finally cut to three, received its premiere in Germany,where it was hatcheted. The three-hour version was successful in France, but wasunable to find an American or British distributor. An attempt by Coppola to editit and make it more ‘acceptable’ failed to appeal to Polanski. But eventually, awarm review by Charles Champlin, critic of the Los Angeles Times, calling it thebest film of the year, finally led Columbia to agree to distribute it, whereuponit was a considerable success, and finally justified Polanski’s faith in it.By any standard, Polanski’s career has been vertiginous. While undoubtedly oneof the most brilliant film directors of his time, his obsessively subjectiveapproach has prevented him from gaining the wide audience appeal that hedeserves. Perhaps the reason can be found in the first sentence of hisautobiography Roman: ‘For as far back as I can remember, the line betweenfantasy and reality has been hopelessly blurred.’"},{"pageContent":"PROFUMO AFFAIRTHE MINISTER AND THE RUSSIAN SPYFEW IF ANY politico-sex scandals in British history have titillated the public’simagination as much as the Profumo–Christine Keeler affair of the so-called‘swinging 60s’. It centred on a real-life situation which, on the face of it,seemed so absurd as to sound more like a plot for some particularly bawdy WestEnd farce; one in which John Profumo, MP, Her Majesty’s Secretary of State forWar, took turn and turn about in call-girl Christine Keeler’s bed with (amongothers) Captain Eugene Ivanov, the assistant Soviet naval attaché in London and,allegedly, a Russian spy bent on gathering nuclear secrets from any resultantpillow talk.So seriously was the possibility taken that a judicial inquiry was appointed andcharged, among other things, with considering ‘ . . . any evidence there may befor believing that national security has been, or may be, endangered . . .’ And,if that were not enough, the affair also had racial undertones, arising from thetrial and imprisonment of two of Miss Keeler’s former lovers, both West Indian.The resultant scandal was sparked off by her disappearance on the eve of thefirst trial, in which she was due to appear at the Old Bailey as chief witnessfor the prosecution; instead she was discovered, by the press, in Spain. As allBritain laughed behind its hand, questions were asked in Parliament. After firststrenuously denying allegations of any impropriety in his dealings with MissKeeler, War Minister Profumo later resigned – when he had confessed that he hadlied to the House, the Cabinet and the Prime Minister about their relationship.Soon there was talk in the foreign press of ‘widespread decadence’ in Britishpublic life, while the most scurrilous and salacious rumours (neversubstantiated) began to circulate at home of sexual orgies in upper-crustcircles, attended by ‘The Man in the Mask’ – always naked, carrying a whip, andpopularly supposed to be another Tory cabinet minister. This particular rumourgained such credence that it became common gossip in pubs, clubs and homesthroughout the country.Then came tragedy, when Dr Stephen Ward – osteopath, talented portrait-artist,procurer of women for his rich and famous friends (who all deserted him afterhis arrest) and a central character in the whole Profumo Affair – committedsuicide during his own Old Bailey trial, in July 1963. Ward took an overdose ofbarbiturates when the court adjourned for the night after part-hearing thejudge’s summing up, and died in hospital without knowing the verdict. MissKeeler herself was later jailed for committing perjury at the trial of thesecond of her two West Indian former lovers. Finally, a year after theresignation in October 1963 of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, on healthgrounds, the Tory party was beaten at the polls after more than twelve years inpower; a defeat, said the pundits, which was hastened by the odium of theProfumo Affair.At the time the scandal began, ‘Dr’ Stephen Ward – he was an osteopath, not amedical practitioner – had for several years rented a cottage orné, onpeppercorn terms, at Cliveden, the country estate owned by his friend LordAstor. Ward’s guests were allowed use of the swimming pool and it was there thathe introduced Christine Keeler to both Mr Profumo and Captain Ivanov in thesummer of 1961. Unconfirmed reports that Profumo, the husband of actress ValerieHobson and a wealthy man in his own right, was competing with Ivanov for MissKeeler’s favours were already circulating in Fleet Street by mid-1962. OnlyQueen magazine dared, however, to hint at the incredible situation that was saidto be developing. It printed a brief but barbed reference to a chauffeur-drivenRussian Zis limousine arriving at an unnamed lady’s front door, just as agovernment chauffeur-driven Humber pulled away from the back. That flat was inWimpole Mews in central London, provided by Stephen Ward at nominal rent forChristine Keeler’s use. But since no identification was made, the article causedno great stir beyond a privileged readership.Then on 14 December 1962 a West Indian called Johnny Edgecombe was arrestedafter firing a revolver at the door and window of the flat. Inside wereChristine Keeler and a friend, Mandy Rice-Davies, likewise destined soon tobecome a household name. They rang Dr Ward at his consulting rooms nearby and hecalled the police. On 14 March 1963 Edgecombe stood trial at the Old Bailey. Thecharges included one of attempted murder and another of wounding ‘Lucky’ Gordon,a fellow West Indian who had supplanted him in Christine Keeler’s affections.Chief prosecution witness Keeler failed to appear; unknown to the court she wasin Spain. However, no request was made for a postponement and of the two womenpresent in the flat at the time of the shooting, only Miss Rice-Davies gaveevidence. Edgecombe, who had previous convictions, was found not guilty ofattempted murder, or of wounding Gordon, but guilty on a lesser charge, ofpossessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. For this he was sentenced toseven years’ imprisonment and the scandal now moved into the open.Two national newspaper reporters who had refused to name their informants to theVassall (spy) Tribunal were already in jail, so Fleet Street, although fullyaware of Mr Profumo’s association with Christine Keeler, was obliged to proceedcautiously. It, therefore, printed stories about the Edgecombe trial and itsmissing prosecution witness, alongside apparently unconnected stories concerningJohn Profumo. The Sunday Pictorial printed an exclusive interview with DrStephen Ward, in which he said: ‘Now it looks as though somebody – no doubt aloyal friend – has spirited her away . . .’Who that ‘loyal friend’ may have been and what if any were his motives, hasnever been established. In his official report, Lord Denning, who had examinedthe bank accounts of both Mr Profumo and Dr Ward, found no evidence to suggestthat either man had assisted her in leaving the country. However, on 22 MarchPrivate Eye published a mock ‘report’ under the byline ‘Lunchtime O’Booze’ whichread:> Mr Silas Jones, a West Indian immigrant of no fixed abode, was today sentenced> at the Old Bailey to twenty-four years Preventive Detention for being in> possession of an offensive water-pistol. The chief ‘witness’ in the case, gay> fun-loving Miss Gaye Funloving, a 21-year-old ‘model’, was not actually> present in Court. She has, in fact, disappeared. It is believed that normally,> in cases of this type, a Warrant is issued for the arrest of the missing> witness.> Parties. One of Miss Funloving’s close ‘friends’, Dr Spook of Harley Street,> revealed last night that he could add nothing to what had already been> insinuated. Dr Spook is believed to have ‘more than half the Cabinet on his> list of patients’. He also has a ‘weekend’ cottage on the Berkshire estate of> Lord—, and is believed to have attended many ‘parties’ in the neighbourhood.> Among those it is believed who have also attended ‘parties’ of this type are> Mr Vladimir Bolokhov, the well-known Soviet spy attached to the Russian> embassy and a well-known Cabinet Minister.> Resignation? Mr James Montesi, a well-known Cabinet Minister, was last night> reported to have proffered his ‘resignation’ to the Prime Minister, on> ‘personal grounds’. It is alleged that the Prime Minister refused to accept> his alleged ‘resignation’. Mr Montesi today denied the allegations that he had> even allegedly offered his alleged ‘resignation’ to the alleged ‘Prime> Minister’.That night, outspoken Socialist MP Colonel George Wigg – no friend of MrProfumo’s and with whom he had already clashed in the House on another unrelatedmatter – addressed the Commons as they debated the affair of the two reportersjailed by the Vassall Tribunal. Colonel Wigg said,> There is not an Honourable Member in the House, nor a journalist in the Press> Gallery, nor do I believe there is a person in the Public Gallery, who in the> last few days has not heard rumour upon rumour involving a member of the> Government Front Bench. The Press has got as near as it can – it has shown> itself willing to wound, but afraid to strike. This all comes about because of> the Vassall Tribunal. These great Press Lords, these men who control great> instruments of public opinion and power, do not have the guts to discharge the> duty that they are now claiming for themselves. That being the case, I rightly> use the privilege of the House of Commons – that is what it is given to me for> – to ask the Home Secretary, who is the senior member of the government on the> Treasury Bench now, to go to the Dispatch Box – he knows that the rumour to> which I refer relates to Miss Christine Keeler and Miss Davies and a shooting> by a West Indian – and, on behalf of the government, categorically deny the> truth of these rumours. On the other hand, if there is anything in them, I> urge him to ask the Prime Minister to do what was not done in the Vassall Case> – set up a Select Committee, so that these things can be dissipated and the> honour of the Minister concerned freed from the imputations and innuendoes> that are being spread at the present time.Home Secretary Henry Brooke refused to pick up the gauntlet, while Mr Profumohimself was not in the House. He was, however, informed of what had happened andpromptly made a personal statement to the Commons. The ‘personal statement’ is adevice used by MPs, including Ministers, for a variety of reasons (including thedenial of rumours, repeated under the cloak of Parliamentary privilege). Bytradition, the speaker is never questioned about a personal statement so that hein turn becomes honour-bound to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing butthe truth. To betray this mutual trust is to commit political hara-kiri. MrProfumo made his personal statement with his wife watching from the Stranger’sGallery, and himself on the Front Bench flanked by Prime Minister HaroldMacmillan and lain Macleod, the Leader of the House.He said,> I understand that my name has been connected with the rumours about the> disappearance of Miss Keeler. I would like to take this opportunity of making> a personal statement about these matters. I last saw Miss Keeler in December> 1961 and I have not seen her since. I have no idea where she is now. Any> suggestion that I was in any way connected with or responsible for her absence> from the trial at the Old Bailey is wholly and completely untrue. My wife and> I first met Miss Keeler at a house party in July 1961 at Cliveden. Among a> number of people there was Dr Stephen Ward, whom we already knew slightly, and> a Mr Ivanov, who was an attaché at the Russian Embassy. The only other> occasion that my wife or I met Mr Ivanov was for a moment at the official> reception for Major Gagarin [the first man in Space] at the Soviet Embassy. My> wife and I had a standing invitation to visit Dr Ward. Between July and> December 1961, I met Miss Keeler on about half-a-dozen occasions at Dr Ward’s> flat, when I called to see him and his friends. Miss Keeler and I were on> friendly terms. There was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship> with Miss Keeler. Mr Speaker, I have made this personal statement because of> what was said in the House last evening by the three Honourable Members, and> which of course was protected by privilege. I shall not hesitate to issue> writs for libel and slander if scandalous allegations are made or repeated> outside the House.Later that day the Minister and his wife were photographed at the races in thecompany of the Queen Mother. Press reaction was restrained, although theGuardian declared: ‘ . . . only the most compelling evidence to the contrarycould warrant any suspicion now, after such explicit statements from MrProfumo. . . . They ought to end the talk.’ Christine Keeler, found at last bythe press in Spain, said somewhat obliquely, ‘I have nothing to be ashamed of; Iknow that now.’ When she returned to Britain, the only penalty she incurred wasto forfeit the £40 recognizance put by the Court on her duty to appear aswitness at the Edgecombe trial. Mr Profumo himself made good the threat he haduttered earlier in the Commons, by commencing actions for libel against ParisMatch and Tempo Illustrato magazines. (He gave the £50 out-of-court settlementpaid by Illustrato to charity.) ‘Dr’ Stephen Ward said on television that MrProfumo had told the truth about Miss Keeler; to all intents and purposes itseemed as if the ‘scandal’ was no more than press invention. And yet itstubbornly refused to die down.On the night of 18 April 1963, Christine Keeler complained to the police thatshe had been attacked by ‘Lucky’ Gordon as she left a woman friend’s house inLondon. He was arrested and bail was opposed. One week later Mandy Rice-Davieswas arrested at London airport en route to Majorca and charged with possessing aforged driving licence. The licence enabled her to drive the Jaguar car given toher on her seventeenth birthday by slum landlord and racketeer, Peter Rachman.(In her memoirs, The Mandy Report, published in 1964, Miss Rice-Davies claimedthat the real reason for her arrest was to persuade her to make a statementconcerning Stephen Ward. She then gave evidence at his trial, which began on 22July 1963.) Also in 1964, author and broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy wrote in hisbook The Trial of Stephen Ward that: ‘ . . . [Ward] felt, naively perhaps butnot altogether unreasonably, that as he had done his best to protect theGovernment’s War Minister, the Government might do their best to call their dogsoff him. He wrote to the Home Secretary, his local MP Sir Wavell Wakefield, andthe Leader of the Opposition, Mr Harold Wilson. To Mr Wilson he wrote:“Obviously my efforts to conceal the fact that Mr Profumo had not told the truthin Parliament have made it look as if I myself have something to hide. It isquite clear now that they must wish the facts to be known, and I shall see thatthey are . . .”’Copies of some of the letters Ward wrote were also sent to the press and furtherquestions were tabled in the House. The Prime Minister thereupon instructed LordDilhorne, the Lord Chancellor, to investigate. Meanwhile Johnny Edgecombe’sappeal had been dismissed; now it was ‘Lucky’ Gordon’s turn to stand trial atthe Old Bailey. This time Christine Keeler was present to give evidence. Gordonclaimed that she had been pregnant by him when she went to Spain. As heattempted to talk matters over with her on her return, she fell over hersuitcase and so caused the injuries she had sustained. Miss Keeler denied thepregnancy allegation and protested so vehemently when Gordon said she had givenhim a venereal disease that the judge ordered her from the court. Gordon, whodismissed his counsel and then conducted his own defence, asked for a number ofwitnesses to be called, including John Profumo and Stephen Ward. Neither wascalled. Only two men (said by Gordon to have been in the flat as Miss Keelerleft) were sought but could not be found. Gordon was found guilty and sentencedto three years’ imprisonment. A few weeks later, that sentence was quashed andhe was freed. In his book The Profumo Affair, Aspects of Conservatism, authorWayland Young wrote: ‘Six weeks later the Lord Chief Justice, having heard somenew evidence which was not made public, upset the verdict and released [Gordon].But already on the second day of the trial the whole grumbling, menacing mess ofhappenings and rumours of happenings had been lifted to the level of a dulyconstituted scandal by the resignation of the Secretary of State for War . . .’After telling his wife the full story of his association with Christine Keeler,Mr Profumo had cut short their holiday in Venice, returned to England andresigned both as Minister and MP. The interchange of letters between himself andthe Prime Minister revealed that he had committed the unpardonable sin of lyingto Parliament when he made his personal statement.John Profumo wrote:> Dear Prime Minister,> You will recall that on 22 March, following certain allegations made in> Parliament, I made a personal statement. At the time rumour had charged me> with assisting in the disappearance of a witness, and with being involved in> some possible breach of security. So serious were these charges that I allowed> myself to think that my personal association with that witness, which had also> been the subject of rumour, was by comparison of minor importance only. In my> statement I said that there had been no impropriety in this association. To my> very deep regret I have to admit that this was not true, and that I misled> you, and my colleagues, and the House.> I ask you to understand that I did this to protect, as I thought, my wife and> family, who were equally misled, as were my professional advisers. I have come> to realize that, by this deception, I have been guilty of a grave misdemeanour> and despite the fact that there is no truth whatever in the other charges, I> cannot remain a member of your Administration, nor of the House of Commons. I> cannot tell you of my deep remorse for the embarrassment I have caused to you,> to my colleagues in the Government, to my constituents, and to the Party which> I have served for the past twenty-five years.> Yours sincerely,> Jack Profumo.To which Mr Macmillan, then on holiday in Scotland, replied:> Dear Profumo,> The contents of your letter of 4 June have been communicated to me and I have> heard them with deep regret. This is a great tragedy for you, your family, and> your friends. Nevertheless, I am sure you will understand that in the> circumstances, I have no alternative but to advise the Queen to accept your> resignation.> Yours very sincerely,> Harold Macmillan.The Times commented acidly: ‘There can be few more lamentable documents inBritish political history than Mr Profumo’s letter of resignation. In his replythe Prime Minister says: “This is a great tragedy for you, your family, and yourfriends.” It is also a great tragedy for the probity of public life inBritain . . .’If that was undeniable, the moral question was now overtaken by a more sinisteraspect of the affair: had the national security been put at risk by Mr Profumo’sconduct? It was clear that he had laid himself open to possible blackmail, buteven before the Commons could debate the matter Mr Michael Eddowes, a formersolicitor and member of the Thursday Club, published the contents of a letter hehad written earlier to the Prime Minister. In it Mr Eddowes claimed he hadwarned MI5 in March 1963 that Miss Keeler had told him Ivanov had asked her tofind out from Mr Profumo the date on which nuclear warheads were to be deliveredto West Germany. (Christine Keeler herself maintained later the suggestion hadcome from Stephen Ward, not Ivanov, and had not been intended seriously: nor hadshe put any such question to the War Minister.) However, the disclosure came ata time when everything Miss Keeler said, or did, or was said to have done, wasnews. Her ‘Confessions’ were appearing weekly in the mass-circulation News ofthe World. She was said to have turned down an offer of £5,000 per week (fortwelve weeks) to compère a cabaret show called ‘Turkish Delight’. Against allthe backcloth of rumour and known scandal there was also talk in politicalcircles of more threatened Cabinet resignations, even a move to oust PremierMacmillan.The highly responsible New York Times declared that: ‘A political crisis evenmore profound than the storm over Suez which blew Anthony Eden out of office andbrought Prime Minister Macmillan to power is now shaking Great Britain to itsfoundations. The Suez crisis forced a change in Conservative Prime Ministers butleft the Conservative Government intact. The present crisis threatens to end thetwelve-year rule of the Conservative party . . .’During the Commons debate – which was held while Stephen Ward was awaiting trial– Mr Macmillan revealed that Ward had called on his Private Secretary on 7 Mayof that year, in the presence of an MI5 officer. During the course of hiscomplaints, ‘Mr Ward let drop the remark that Mr Profumo had not told the truth’(in his personal statement). Later, when the Lord Chancellor began hisinquiries, he learned that ‘. . . Christine Keeler had told the police on 26January (1963), while they were questioning her about the Edgecombe affray, thatStephen Ward had asked her to discover from Profumo the date on which certainatomic secrets were to be handed to West Germany by the Americans – this was atthe time of the Cuba crisis – and that she did not put this question to MrProfumo . . .’ The Prime Minister added, ‘I think it very unfortunate that thisinformation was not given to me, but the head of the security service, inconsidering these reports, did not take that as of great importance.’Ironically, the then head of M15 was Sir Roger Hollis, who was himself lateraccused by some of his senior officers of being a Soviet agent. (There wasanother ‘spy’ connection, unknown at the time. On 22 July 1963, the day on whichWard’s trial began at the Old Bailey, an exhibition of his drawings opened inLondon. Among his portraits of the famous were some of members of the RoyalFamily. As the trial proceeded a mysterious caller who declined to give his namebought the lot for £5,000 – paid in cash, with £5 notes. He was later identifiedas Professor Anthony Blunt, then Keeper of the Queen’s Pictures. Another yearwas to pass before he confessed to being a long-term Soviet agent.)At the lower court hearing, the magistrates found that no prima facie case ofbrothel keeping had been made against Dr Ward; by the time his Old Bailey trialbegan, the Crown had further decided to leave two abortion charges on the file.Ward pleaded not guilty to five counts of poncing and procuring. On the seventhday of his trial, held in the Bailey’s famous No. 1 Court and packed to capacitythroughout, proceedings were adjourned before the judge had completed hissumming-up. Ward was allowed home on bail. After sending for a Daily Expressreporter, to whom he confessed that he was afraid of the outcome, he later tookan overdose of barbiturates. For the ensuing three days he hovered between lifeand death at St Stephen’s Hospital. Meantime the trial continued. He was foundguilty on two counts (of living off the immoral earnings of three prostitutes,including Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies), not guilty of the otherthree. Dr Ward died before he knew the verdict or could appear before the judgefor sentence.However, he left several suicide notes, including one each to his trial judgeand both leading counsel, as well as Lord Denning, who had been appointed by thePrime Minister to inquire into the whole Profumo Affair. He also wrote thankinga prostitute named Ronna Ricardo for having told the truth at the trial anddirected that she should be paid £500 from his estate. (She had retracted muchof the evidence she gave earlier at the magistrates court, claiming she wasunder police pressure.) To prostitute Vickie Barrett, another Crown witness, hewrote: ‘I don’t know what it was or who it was that made you do what you did.But if you have any decency left, you should tell the truth like Ronna Ricardo.You owe this not to me, but to everyone who may be treated like you or like mein future.’Mr Wayland Young said apropos the Denning Report, which was published inSeptember 1963,> But many questions remain to worry the public. Was Ronna Ricardo telling the> truth when she said she had been threatened by the police into giving false> evidence? Why did Vickie Barrett break down when Ward died, confess to a> journalist that she too had been lying, and then retract her confession? On> whose instructions and with what right had Mandy Rice-Davies been forcibly> kept in the country to give evidence against Stephen Ward? And, a question> which seems to sum up the others, why did the police find it necessary to> interview 140 people before they moved against Stephen Ward? How many people> do they usually think it worth interviewing in order to prepare charges of> poncing?In general, Lord Denning found there had been no damage done to the nationalsecurity, while he was ‘satisfied’ MI5 had not known in 1961 of Mr Profumo’saffair with Christine Keeler (as Ward claimed). He confirmed, however, that MI5knew in February 1963 about Miss Keeler’s statement to the police, claiming thatWard had asked her to discover from the War Minister the date on which atomicsecrets were to be handed to West Germany. ‘They (the Special Branch Commanderand a senior MI5 officer) decided there was no security interest involved suchas to warrant any further steps being taken.’ He was, however, critical of thegovernment’s failure to face facts and take the appropriate action. ‘The conductof Mr Profumo was such as to create, amongst an influential section of thepeople, a reasonable belief that he had committed adultery with such a woman insuch circumstances as the case discloses. It was the responsibility of the PrimeMinister and his colleagues, and of them only, to deal with this situation: andthey did not succeed in doing so . . .’Stephen Ward said, at his trial, of Christine Keeler, ‘I don’t think she everhad intercourse with Ivanov.’ In his official Report, Lord Denning came to thesame conclusion – although Miss Keeler, who should know, stated categorically inher book Nothing but . . . (with Sandy Fawkes, 1983) that, ‘He gave me the kisswe had both been waiting for and we made marvellous, passionate love. He wasgorgeous, so utterly masculine, we were for a while totally swept away . . .’Whoever was telling the truth, Ivanov was the only one of the central charactersin the Affair who got away scot-free. He simply stepped on a plane back toRussia. In December 1963 Christine Keeler was jailed for nine months forcommitting perjury at ‘Lucky’ Gordon’s trial. Some thought it a stiffer sentencethan she might have received for absconding and flying to Spain a second time.Stephen Ward was dead, while Mr Profumo disappeared from public view anddedicated the rest of his life to running Toynbee Hall, the East End of Londonsettlement and community workshop."},{"pageContent":"RUSSELL, BERTRANDSEX LIFE OF A LOGICAL PHILOSOPHERBERTRAND RUSSELL WAS a lifelong philanderer of whom one biographer wrote his‘private life was a chaos of serious affairs, secret trysts and emotionaltightrope acts that constantly threatened, if never quite exploded into, ruinousscandal.’Russell’s father, Lord Amberley, was not quite so fortunate. At the age of 22,his tutor recommended him to read a book on the overpopulation problem and fouryears later, Amberley took the chair at a meeting of the London DialecticalSociety, in which he criticized the clergy for being opposed to the preventionof overpopulation and said that if women had more say in the matter they wouldbe opposed to large families. Ten days later, the British Medical Journalrepudiated birth control, and Lord Amberley, with ‘indignation and disgust’. TheJournal, and other organs that took up the attack, seemed to believe thatAmberley was advocating abortion or infanticide. (Victorian delicacy made ithard for anyone to say openly what Amberley had advocated.) He was called a‘filthy, foulmouthed rake’, and when he stood as a Liberal for Parliament, aplacard of ‘a scandalous and indecent character’ was flourished at him.Understandably, he failed to gain the seat.Russell was born in 1872. He tells in his autobiography how his father hired atutor named Spalding to teach his elder brother science. The tutor was in anadvanced stage of consumption but Lord and Lady Amberley decided that, althoughhe ought to remain childless, it was unfair for him to remain celibate. So LadyAmberley gallantly offered Spalding the use of her own body to allay hisfrustration, ‘though’, adds Russell, ‘I know of no evidence that she derived anypleasure from doing so.’ This seems a naive remark; no woman, particularly thedaughter of a peer, is likely to consent to allowing a young man to use her likea prostitute unless she has some sneaking admiration for him. The affair startedsoon after Russell was born. However, two years later, Lady Amberley died ofdiphtheria, and her husband, soon after, of bronchitis.Russell was raised by a Presbyterian grandmother and brooded a great deal on hissinfulness. At fifteen he was ‘constantly distracted by erections’ and learnedto masturbate. Then, at twenty, he fell in love with Alys Pearsall Smith, anAmerican Quaker. At the same time he became involved with Alys’s sister Mary,who had just left her husband. He later told intimate friends that he had had anaffair with Mary. This seems to contradict the statement in his autobiographythat until 1911 he had never had ‘complete relations’ with any woman. Thesolution may lie in the word ‘complete’. As a child, Russell had fallen out of acarriage and hurt his penis and there is a suggestion that this induced periodicimpotence. He mentioned later that he ‘failed totally’ to give his first wife achild. So he and Mary may have tried hard but failed to achieve any result.Russell married Alys, who was five years his senior, and they seem to have beenreasonably happy, in spite of her conviction that ‘sex was beastly’ and that‘all women hated it’. After some initial sexual problems, which he found ‘merelycomic’, they seem to have overcome problems of mutual adjustment. Even so,Russell describes ‘a day after three weeks of marriage, when, under theinfluence of sexual fatigue, I hated her and could not imagine why I had wishedto marry her.’ This is a highly revealing comment, which throws some light onthe curious paradox of Russell’s mental life. Intellectually he was brilliant,with a natural capacity for abstract reasoning. But he always seemed to handleemotional problems with a clumsiness that shows a total lack of imagination.This is why his writings, particularly on moral and social questions, often seemnaive.Russell was himself capable of recognizing this emotional inadequacy. When hebegan to work on his monumental Principia Mathematica with Alfred NorthWhitehead, he fell in love with Whitehead’s wife Evelyn. She often sufferedintense pain from heart trouble. One day Russell walked into the room to findher undergoing a severe bout of pain: ‘She seemed cut off from everyone andeverything by walls of agony, and the sense of the solitude of each human soulsuddenly overwhelmed me. Ever since my marriage, my emotional life had been calmand superficial. I had forgotten all the deeper issues, and had been contentwith flippant cleverness. Suddenly the ground seemed to give way beneathme . . .’ The result was a sort of religious conversion, which turned him into apacifist and, socially speaking, an idealist.One day out bicycling, he suddenly realized he was no longer in love with Alysand that she irritated him profoundly. With typical unconscious cruelty, hedecided he had better tell her so immediately. The poor woman was naturallyshattered and went on clinging pathetically to him for several years,periodically begging him to come to her bed. (He did, but found it unenjoyable.)Then one day he fell in love. He had been canvassing for his friend PhilipMorrell, a Liberal candidate. In March 1911 he went to stay the night at theLondon home of the Morrells and found that his host had had to go elsewhere. Hewas entertained by Lady Ottoline Morrell, Philip’s wife, who had red hair and aface like a horse. But both she and her house were intensely feminine andRussell was tired of Quaker plainness and flannel nighties. ‘Making timidapproaches, I found them to my surprise not repulsed. I found to my amazementthat I loved her deeply and that she returned my feeling. . . . For external andaccidental reasons [he means presumably that she was menstruating] I did nothave full relations with Ottoline that evening but we agreed to become lovers assoon as possible.’ The opportunity came when Russell went to visit her at hercountry house, Studland. Russell’s dentist had told him he thought Russell hadcancer and he describes how this knowledge heightened his happiness by giving itgreater intensity. A specialist reassured him about the cancer and he andOttoline remained lovers for five years to the fury of Alys and the disgust ofPhilip Morrell.Russell, having embarked on a career of adultery, never looked back. In 1913, onholiday in Italy, he saw a young German woman sitting alone and induced one ofthe ladies in the party to invite her to join them. ‘I made friends with thelady and we made an expedition into the country. I wished to make love to her,but thought that I ought first to explain about Ottoline. Until I spoke aboutOttoline, she was acquiescent but afterwards she ceased to be so. She decided,however, that for one day her objections could be ignored.’ In the followingyear Russell visited America, and met a surgeon’s daughter named Helen Bradleyin Chicago. He confessed to Ottoline that they had spent the day in the woods‘and I found that I care for her a great deal. It ended by our spending thenight together and she will come to England as soon as she can.’ Helen Bradleycame to England with ‘hopes and preparations for a honeymoon’; but Russell hadalready tired of her. Helen had to pour out her miseries to Ottoline, with whomshe was staying. When Russell and Helen went together to Garsington – theMorrells’ new country home – Helen could be heard knocking on Russell’s bedroomdoor in the middle of the night; but he refused to open up. And back in London,Russell was making love to Ottoline in his new flat when Helen came and knockedon the door – and again received no answer. Meanwhile, Ottoline had introducedhim to the beautiful Irene Copper Willis, a research assistant who worked withhim on a political pamphlet. Russell made love to her, then wished that hehadn’t for she was afraid of scandal and refused to go away with him. ‘I do likepeople to be willing to shoot Niagara,’ said Russell, conveniently overlookinghis tendency to fall out of love with women when they were struggling in thewater.During World War I, Russell was dismissed from his lectureship at TrinityCollege, Cambridge, for his pacifist views. In 1916 his pacifism brought himinto contact with a pretty twenty-year-old actress, Lady Constance Malleson, whowas married to the actor Miles Malleson. When Russell had delivered a pacifistspeech and received an immense ovation, they dined together and afterwards hewent back to her flat – her husband was away – where they became lovers.In 1915, Russell had bumped into T.S. Eliot in London – he had met him earlierin America (and Eliot had written a poem about him called ‘Mr Apollinax’). Eliotwas now about to marry a beautiful but rather unstable young lady named VivienHaigh-Wood and they had nowhere to live. Russell offered to let them share hisBury Street flat. Apparently Eliot had no objection to Russell staying in theflat with Vivien when he himself happened to be away. Vivien seems to havepreferred Russell to Eliot in many ways – Eliot was undervitalized (a doctorremarked that he had the thinnest blood he had ever come across). Even when theEliots found their own flat, Russell would sometimes take Vivien out to dinneror lunch. He had decided that his relation with the Eliots should be purely‘paternalistic’, but in 1918, he finally gave way and made love to Vivien. Hetold Constance Malleson that the experience was ‘hellish and loathesome’ andthat he had to disguise his antipathy. He took the first opportunity of breakingwith Vivien, who later went insane.In 1919, Russell moved to Lulworth, in Dorset, for the summer. Among manyvisitors there was a personable young lady named Dora Black, a Fellow of Girton.She was also a campaigner for women’s rights who was ‘outspoken in her advocacyof greater sexual freedom.’ She found Russell ‘enchantingly ugly’ and thought helooked like the Mad Hatter. The next time they met they talked about heraversion to marriage and he asked her what she wanted to do about children. Shereplied that they should be entirely the concern of the mother. Two weeks laterthere was a ring at her doorbell and Russell asked her if she could catch the12:30 train to Lulworth on Monday. ‘Am I to understand . . . ?’ asked Dorabreathlessly and Russell nodded. ‘But I understand you are already in love witha lady?’ Russell assured her it was all over. (In fact, it was to be another twoyears before he threw over Lady Constance.) Typically, halfway through theirweekend, Lady Constance sent a telegram announcing her arrival so Russellinformed Dora she would have to leave immediately . . .In spite of this bad start, when he was offered a post at Peking University, itwas Dora Black Russell decided to take with him. When they returned in 1921 shewas pregnant. They agreed to marry but both insisted that they should retaintheir individual freedom. And when, in 1926, the Russells decided to start theirown experimental school, one of the things they advocated was that free loveshould be allowed to the staff. Russell regarded the female staff as his privateharem and thoroughly enjoyed himself. He explained to his staff that it wasimpossible for a man to know a woman until he had slept with her (a view alsoheld by his contemporary Professor Joad). ‘He had no hesitation putting hisbeliefs to the test,’ says Russell’s biographer Ronald Clark, who also quoteshim on the subject of his ‘inability to restrain his abnormally strong sexualurges’. He had one fairly regular affair – a girl with whom he disappeared mostweekends to his London flat, explaining blandly to his staff, ‘As we both haveto go to London it saves a chauffeur if we both go at the same time.’ This canhave fooled few of them, since Russell was in the habit of propositioning themore attractive females. One new teacher turned him down on her second eveningat the school (he seems to have borne her no ill will). When Dora Russell wasfinally granted a divorce in 1935 the judge commented that Russell had ‘beenguilty of numerous acts of adultery . . . with persons in the household.’ Headded, ‘in circumstances which are usually held to aggravate the offence’,implying that Russell did not confine his activities to ‘dirty weekends’ inLondon, but carried on under his wife’s nose. Dora Russell describes how she hadbeen spending a weekend with a young man in London when she received a note fromthe cook saying she must return home at once – she was refusing to let thegoverness come near the children because she had caught her sleeping with ‘theMaster’. ‘Bertie had an aristocratic attitude to the servants,’ says Dora,recording that the cook had to go but that the governess, ‘who was a charminggirl’, should stay on. Russell had by this time broken with Lady ConstanceMalleson after several attempts at reviewing the affair that had ended in briefreconciliation. Russell remarked that philosophers in love ‘are exactly likeeverybody else, except, perhaps, that the holiday from reason makes thempassionate to excess.’Russell had discovered that his ugliness – the prim but weak mouth, the recedingchin, the large nose – made no difference where women were concerned; his famewas an aphrodisiac. Clark records that even as he approached sixty he was stillendangered by ‘an insatiable appetite for personable and intelligent youngwomen’. There was, for example, the case of a Miss Joan Folwell, whom he metafter addressing a political meeting in Salisbury. She was 21. Russell was aguest in the house of her parents and he asked her to read aloud an essay shehad written. ‘I then realized,’ wrote Miss Folwell, ‘that he was more interestedin me than my writing.’ Letters soon progressed from ‘My Dear Joan (may I callyou so?)’ to ‘My darling Joan’, and after a short time he was inviting her tospend the night with him. ‘My only fear is lest you may find me sexuallyinadequate, as I am no longer young . . . but I think there are ways in which Ican make up for it. And I do want you dreadfully . . .’ Problems intervened; hehad to send her a telegram and cancel. Then he went to America but when hereturned he renewed the pursuit. They met – the second time for dinner, thethird to stay the night together. It had taken Russell three years to get herinto bed. ‘He was very tenacious . . . But the sleeping wasn’t a success, so Igave him up.’ More than forty years later, Miss Folwell recorded her convictionthat Russell was largely responsible for the permissive society and that hewould have hated it.The marriage to Dora ended after she had had two children by an Americanjournalist. Dora hired a pretty governess named Patricia Spence, known as Peter;inevitably, Russell became attracted to her and when Dora Russell’s Americanjournalist visited, they formed a ménage à quatre. Eventually, he and Patriciamarried but there continued to be other women. It made no difference whetherthey were already married or married to men with whom he was friendly – likeGamel Brenan, wife of his friend Gerald Brenan, whom Russell pursued withcustomary tenacity for years. Then there was the young wife of a Cambridgelecturer, who moved into Russell’s house with her husband to look after him whenPatricia was in hospital after an accident. Although now in his mid-70s, Russellbombarded her with letters suggesting clandestine meetings in London orelsewhere. The philosopher Sidney Hook, who knew Russell well, records that themarriage with Patricia broke up when Russell declined to make a pledge of mutualfidelity. ‘That was the last straw for. Patricia who had suffered humiliationenough because of Russell’s roving eye and affections.’ Hook also recorded (inEncounter, March 1984):> He volunteered confessions about his sexual powers, and related matters about> which I would no more have enquired of him than I would of my own father. He> seemed always on the prowl when attractive and vivacious young women were> around and he assumed that my interest in extracurricular matrimonial activity> was as keen as his own. On occasions I was rendered speechless by his> unsolicited advice on how to ‘make’ a girl and what to do after one made her.> ‘Hook,’ he once advised, ‘if you ever take a girl to an hotel and the> reception clerk seems suspicious, when he gives you the price of the room,> have her complain loudly, “It’s much too expensive!” He’s sure to assume she> is your wife . . .’ At another time when I commented on his remarkable memory,> he mildly demurred and observed that it was not what it used to be. Seconds> later, as if to illustrate his point, he turned to me and asked, ‘Hook, what’s> been the most embarrassing moment of your life?’ Without waiting for a reply> from me, he went on, ‘Mine was the failure to remember at breakfast the name> of an attractive woman to whom I had made ardent love the night before. I> really knew it, of course, but it came to mind too late!’ Like George Bernard> Shaw, Russell was apparently an eloquent vocaliser in his love-making> ecstasies.Hook offers some interesting insights into the paradox that was BertrandRussell: the brilliant mind, the penetrating intellect, allied to a curiousemotional immaturity. He lists the three things that prevent him fromclassifying Russell as one of the ‘great minds who were also great humanbeings’. ‘The first was Russell’s vanity. He once told me that whenever he met aman of outstanding intellectual reputation, his first unuttered reaction was:“Can I take him or can he take me? . . .” There was more than a touch ofexhibitionism in the riskless sit-downs of his last years, when he madewell-publicized gestures to Ban The Bomb that were as futile as they wereill-advised.’ The second trait Hook found unpleasant was Russell’s greed. ‘I wasshocked to find what Russell was prepared to do for a little money. . . . Healways seemed strapped for money and tended to blame it on Patricia’sextravagance which seemed hardly plausible to me.’ He cites an article Russellwrote for a magazine called Glamour entitled ‘What To Do If You Fall In LoveWith a Married Woman’. When Hook asked him why he did it, Russell replied, ‘Forfifty dollars.’ The third trait Hook disliked was a certain cold-bloodedness. ‘Ireluctantly came to the conclusion that Russell’s religion of truth overlaid astrong streak of cruelty.’ He cites many examples, including Russell’s treatmentof Helen Bradley. ‘Sensitive readers of Russell’s autobiography will have beenrevolted by the cruelty of some of its pages, not only his account of histreatment of the infatuated young woman who followed him to England, butparticularly by the reproduction of a letter from a harmless German savant whoafter making some contributions to the philosophy of mathematics had becomeinsane. Publication of that letter was like jeering at a cripple.’Dora Russell made the interesting comment, ‘In love, too, Bertie was aperfectionist; the “spiritual” bond must exist, if it were broken then lovemight come to an end. In this, as in other matters, Bertie was not fully awareof his underlying motives; that spiritual bond might well mean that a wife mustagree with him in every detail, so that she might be fully possessed.’ It is thenearest she comes to admitting that Russell was an adept in self-deception."},{"pageContent":"SCOTLAND YARDTHE GREAT BRIBERY SCANDALHARRY BENSON, ONE of the most ingenious swindlers of all time, is rememberedchiefly for his leading role in the great Scotland Yard scandal of 1877.Benson was the son of a well-to-do Jewish merchant with offices in the FaubourgSt Honoré in Paris. He had charming manners, spoke several languages, and likedto represent himself as a member of the nobility. Soon after the Franco-Prussianwar of 1870–71, he approached the Lord Mayor of London, calling himself theComte de Montague, Mayor of Châteaudun, seeking a subscription for the relief ofcitizens made destitute by the war. He collected £1,000 but his forged receiptgave him away and he was sentenced to a year in prison. He found prison life sointolerable that he attempted suicide by trying to burn himself to death on hisprison mattress. He was crippled by it and had to walk with crutches thereafter.When he came out of prison, Benson advertised for a secretarial position,mentioning that he spoke several languages. The man who answered hisadvertisement was a certain William Kurr, who specialized in swindles connectedwith racing. His crude method was to decamp hastily with his customers’winnings. The ingenious Benson soon convinced him that there were better andless risky ways of making a fortune. Members of the French aristocracy were thechosen victims. Kurr and Benson issued a newspaper called Le Sport whichcontained articles about racing translated from British newspapers. It alsocontained many references to a wealthy Mr G.H. Yonge, who was so incrediblysuccessful in backing horses that British bookmakers always shortened their oddswhen they dealt with him. Le Sport was sent out, free, to dozens of Frencharistocrats interested in racing; they had no earthly reason for suspecting aprospective swindle.One of the aristocrats who became a victim was a certain Comtesse de Goncourt.She received a letter from Mr Yonge of Shanklin, Isle of Wight, asking her ifshe would agree to act as his agent in laying bets. All she had to do was tosend the cheque he would send her to a certain bookmaker; if the horse won, shewould receive his winnings, which she would forward to Mr Yonge, and wouldreceive a 5 per cent commission. Madame de Goncourt agreed to this arrangementand received a cheque for a few hundred pounds, which she posted off to thebookmaker in her own name. In due course, she received a cheque for more than athousand pounds in ‘winnings’ and after she had sent this off to Mr Yonge, shereceived her £50 or so commission. It seemed a marvellously easy way of earning£50. What she did not realize was that the ‘bookmaker’ to whom she forwarded thecheque was simply another of Mr Yonge’s aliases. When she had sent Mr Yongeseveral more lots of winnings and received several more lots of commission, shedecided that he was obviously a financial genius and entrusted him with £10,000of her own money to invest on her behalf. That was the last she saw of it.Although Scotland Yard was a relatively new institution in the 1870s (it wasestablished in 1829), its methods of crime-fighting depended a great deal onunderworld ‘narks’ who betrayed fellow criminals. Police officers, then as now,were forced to cultivate the acquaintance of many criminals. It also meant thatan underpaid police officer – in those days the salary of a detective was a mere£5 6s. 2d. a week – might be subjected to the temptation of accepting presents,favours and open bribes for protecting his own ‘narks’. This may well be how acertain detective officer named John Meiklejohn became friendly with WilliamKurr and then began to accept money from him in exchange for not pressing hisinvestigations into Kurr’s earlier swindles. When Chief Inspector NathanielDruscovich, a naturalized Pole, confided to Chief Inspector Meiklejohn that hewas in financial difficulties, Meiklejohn told him he knew a ‘businessman’ whocould help him. The businessman was Benson and all he wanted in return for the£60 he ‘lent’ Druscovich was a little information – prior warning if the Yardintended to arrest him. Soon a third dectective had been drawn into the net –Chief Inspector William Palmer. Not long after this, Meiklejohn warned Kurr andBenson that the Yard was getting close. Meiklejohn’s superior, Chief InspectorClarke, had been tracking down sham betting offices and was hot on the trail ofGardner and Co., the name under which Kurr and his confederates had beenoperating.Among these confederates was a man called Walters who belonged to a gang thatClarke had recently broken up. Now Benson wrote to Clarke from his pleasant homein the Isle of Wight – he kept a carriage, and had an excellent cook and manyservants – saying that he had some interesting information about Walters.Unfortunately, he explained, he was crippled and could not come to Scotland Yardbut if Clarke would be kind enough to come down to Shanklin. . . . In thosedays, policemen stood in awe of the aristocracy and were likely to treat awealthy suspect with obsequious respect. So Clarke hurried down to Shanklin andwas duly overawed by Mr Yonge’s magnificent home. He was worried when Mr Yongetold him that Walters was going about saying that he had bribed Clarke and thathe had in his possession a letter to prove it. Indeed Clarke had written Waltersa letter; he was not a very literate man and he might easily have expressedhimself in a way that could be open to false interpretation. Mr Yonge promisedto try to get hold of the letter and he and Clarke parted on friendly terms. ButClarke then reported to his own superior that Yonge was a scoundrel. They hadsome correspondence and Yonge addressed Clarke as ‘My Dear Sir and Brother’ forthey were both freemasons. They met several times and ‘Yonge’ later claimed hehad given Clarke £50.With this network of ‘police spies’, the Benson–Kurr gang should have beenuntouchable. But Benson now overreached himself. He wrote to the Comtesse deGoncourt saying that he had a marvellous and unique opportunity to invest afurther large sum for her. The Comtesse had no more ready cash and she called onher lawyer, a Mr Abrahams, to ask him to turn certain securities into cash. MrAbrahams took the precaution of contacting Scotland Yard and asking whether theyknew anything about a certain Mr Yonge of ‘Rose Bank’, Shanklin. Druscovich, whowas in charge of frauds connected with the Continent received the message andhastened to warn Benson that trouble was brewing. Scotland Yard had been askedby the Paris police to intercept letters containing money from various dupes –but the telegram containing this request was pocketed by Druscovich. Druscovichcould see that he was playing a dangerous game; he would be expected to make anarrest soon. He begged the swindlers to remove themselves beyond his reach assoon as possible.The gang, which included Kurr’s brother Frederick, and two men named Murray andBale, had put most of its ill-gotten gains into the safest place, the Bank ofEngland. They could, of course, withdraw it without difficulty. The only problemabout that was that English bank notes are numbered and for such a large sum ofmoney, they would be numbered consecutively and would, therefore, be easy totrace. If the gang escaped to the Continent, they would be leaving a trail ofbank notes behind them like a paperchase. Benson withdrew about £16,000 from thebank and hastened up to Scotland where he opened an account in the Bank ofClydesdale in Greenock; he also withdrew £13,000 in Bank of Clydesdale £100notes. These had the advantage of bearing no number but they were still easilytraceable. Benson was eating dinner with the manager of the Clydesdale Bank whenhe received a telegram from Druscovich warning him that he was on his way toarrest him. Benson fled, forfeiting the £3,000 still in his account at Greenock.The detectives were rewarded with about £500 each (although Clarke does not seemto have been included). Meiklejohn immediately made the mistake of cashing oneof his £100 notes and giving an office of the gang as his address. A week laterhe cashed another note with a Leeds wine merchant. The Leeds police discoveredthis and since they were on the lookout for the gang sent a telegram to ScotlandYard. Druscovich intercepted the telegram and burned it.Scotland Yard found it baffling that, in spite of all their efforts, the Bensongang had slipped through their fingers. The bribed detectives were still notsuspected. Clarke’s superior Williamson set it all down to sheer bad luck. Infact, most of the gang was now in hiding at Bridge of Allan in Scotland. Whenthe Comtesse’s lawyer Abrahams traced them to Scotland, Chief Inspector WilliamPalmer sent them a letter warning them to scatter.It was Druscovich who was made responsible for rushing around the country totrap the swindlers. He met Kurr at the Caledonian Station in Edinburgh and wasoffered £1,000 by him if he did not go to Bridge of Allan. Druscovich had todecline for he had been ordered to go to Bridge of Allan to collect certainletters that had been addressed to one ‘Mr Giffard’ at the Queen’s Hotel. MrGiffard was William Kurr.Inevitably, the birds had flown by the time Druscovich reached Bridge of Allan.Williamson was understandably disappointed. He was astounded to learn that hissubordinate Meiklejohn had been seen in the company of the swindlers at Bridgeof Allan. This was surely the point when Scotland Yard had to smell a rat . . .But Meiklejohn explained that he had no idea he had been wining and dining withcrooks. He had met Yonge by chance and believed him to be a perfectlyrespectable gentleman. Williamson accepted his story.Now the gang found themselves with thousands of pounds in uncashable £100 notesand with no ready cash. Murray was sent off to cash a cheque at one of the banksin Scotland where they had opened an account; the police were waiting for him.Benson went to Rotterdam and tried to cash a note at his hotel but Scotland Yardhad alerted the Dutch police and he was arrested. Druscovich passed on the newsto Kurr who persuaded a crooked attorney named Froggatt to send the Dutch policea telegram signed ‘Scotland Yard’, ordering them to release Benson on thegrounds that his arrest had been a mistake. It almost succeeded but the Dutchpolice decided to wait for a letter confirming the telegram, and this nevercame.It was Druscovich, the expert on Continental crime, who was sent to Rotterdam tobring back Benson – and Bale, who had also been arrested there. There wasnothing he could do about it except to look at them sternly and mutter under hisbreath that he would do his best. There was no opportunity to allow them toescape. Besides, his own position was now in danger. Williamson had now heardabout the letter from the Leeds police, telling them that Meiklejohn had casheda £100 note there. He wanted to know if Druscovich had seen it. Druscovichdenied all knowledge of it and he realized that any attempt to allow Benson toescape was now out of the question.The swindlers finally stood in the dock and were found guilty. Benson receivedfifteen years and Kurr received ten. As soon as they reached Millbank Prison,they asked to see the governor and told the story of the corrupt detectives. Ashort time afterwards, Druscovich, Meiklejohn, Palmer and Clarke all stood inthe dock – and, for good measure, the police had also arrested the crookedattorney Froggatt. Many letters from the detectives were produced, warning thecrooks of the activities of Scotland Yard. Druscovich had also been seen talkingto Benson and Kurr at St Pancras Station, London.All except Clarke were convicted – the evidence against Clarke was inconclusive.Druscovich, Meiklejohn and Palmer all received two years’ hard labour, themaximum sentence for conspiring to defeat the ends of justice.Clarke was retired on a pension. Meiklejohn became a private detective. Palmerused his savings to become a publican. What happened to Druscovich is not knownbut he disappeared from sight; while Froggatt died in a workhouse.The two principle swindlers still had many successful years before them. Bensonand Kurr both received a third remission of sentence for good conduct. Theyteamed up again and slipped across the Atlantic where they became mining companypromoters. Benson returned to Belgium and continued in business selling stock innon-existent mines. The Belgian police found out more about him from ScotlandYard and arrested him. Huge quantities of postal orders and cheques, apparentlysent to him by gullible investors were found in his lodgings. He spent anothertwo years in jail then moved to Switzerland. There he again set out to give theimpression he was a wealthy stockbroker. He met a girl in his hotel, whosefather was a retired general and surgeon of the Indian army. He persuaded thegirl to marry him and induced the father to sell his shares and hand over theproceeds of £7,000 for ‘investment’. Then he tried to disappear to America. Hisfather-in-law managed to have him arrested at Bremen but decided not toprosecute when Benson gave back £5,000. Jewellery that Benson had given hisfiancée proved to be made of paste.His last great coup was in America. The singer Adelina Patti was arriving in NewYork for a tour. Benson, calling himself Abbey, bribed customs officials to lethim on the boat ahead of the Patti Reception Committee. He introduced himself toher as the head of the committee. When the committee arrived, he was deep inconversation with her and they assumed he was her manager. She left the boat onhis arm. He then went to Mexico and sold thousands of bogus tickets of Patticoncerts. He was arrested when he went back into the States and committed to theTombs. Apparently, unable to face the prospect of another long period in prison,he leapt from a high gallery and fell 50 feet, snapping his spine. At the timeof his death he was little more than forty years of age."},{"pageContent":"SIMPSON, O.J.THE MURDER TRIALJUST AFTER MIDNIGHT on Monday 13 June 1994, a howling, blood-spattered Akita dogattracted investigation by neighbours of 35-year-old Nicole Brown Simpson. Theyfound her lying dead in the garden of her luxurious Santa Monica condo in apartially enclosed area near the entry gate. Lying nearby was the corpse of25-year-old Ronald Goldman, also murdered. Both had been dead for just over twohours.Los Angeles police scene-of-crime officers quickly reconstructed the events ofthe two murders from the available evidence. The angle of the wound indicatedthat Nicole Brown Simpson had been standing near and was probably conversingwith the killer when he struck at her neck with a long-bladed weapon, nearlysevering Nicole’s head from her body and killing her almost instantly. The25-year-old Goldman then struggled with the murderer and was stabbed and slashedover thirty times. The murderer then escaped.Even from this sparse evidence the police could make some preliminary guesses:the killer was quite possibly known to Nicole Brown Simpson, as he had beenstanding close to her when he attacked – people, especially women, tend to keepover an arm’s-length away when talking to total strangers. The killer was alsoalmost certainly a man – to judge by the strength needed to make such damagingattacks on two unrestrained adults – a very strong man at that. Finally,although much more speculatively, there was the possibility that this was acrime of passion: a savage attack on an attractive woman and a young man whomight have appeared, to the jealous killer, to be her lover. (In fact RonaldGoldman was a waiter from a nearby restaurant who was – as far as we know –simply returning a pair of dark glasses that Nicole had left there earlier thatday.) All the initial evidence seemed to point to Nicole’s ex-husband: footballhero and movie star, Orenthal James ‘O.J.’ Simpson.Before he fell under suspicion as a double murderer, O.J. Simpson’s life hadbeen a classic American success story. Starting his public career in Americanfootball in the 1970s, he was soon one of the most famous players in the game’shistory. Playing in the position of running back, the young O.J. displayedmasterful dexterity, strength and, most of all, running speed – breaking severalrecords, including the most touchdowns scored in a single season. Also, the factthat he was black and from a relatively poor background made him a living iconof the American Dream: that talent could take anyone, from any background, rightto the top.O.J. retired from professional football in 1979. In that year he also divorcedfrom his first wife and, shortly thereafter, lost his young son in a tragicswimming pool accident.Despite these personal misfortunes, O.J. maintained his public career and highpopularity. His pleasant, affable demeanour made him a popular TV personalityand he eventually branched out from the usual profession of retired sportsheroes – sport commentary – to start a new career as an actor. His success inthe role of an inept, accident-prone policeman in the hit comedy movie The NakedGun, in 1988, made O.J. a hot property in Hollywood. He followed this withanother acting success, playing a black man framed by a racist cop in TheKlansman. O.J. also landed a lucrative advertising contract as the endorsingcelebrity for Hertz car rental – in one TV advert for the company, O.J. wasshown desperately running through an airport, trying to catch a departing plane.The irony of these TV and movie images was later to be much commented upon.In 1985, O.J. Simpson married Nicole Brown. He had originally met her servingtables in 1977, when she was seventeen and still in high school. The simple factthat Nicole was white again seemed to highlight O.J.’s role as an icon of themodern American Dream: in this case, showing that prejudice against mixed-racemarriages was a thing of the past (in the well-off part of Los Angeles, atleast). However, all was not as perfect in the relationship as was shown in theglossy magazines.Nicole complained to friends and family members that O.J. was violently jealousof her. She also showed them bruises that she claimed had come from beatingsO.J. had given her for playfully flirting with other men. O.J. later denied everhaving hit Nicole, insisting that the bruises had resulted from friendly gamesof ‘wrassling’, but the very fact that Nicole was making such claims indicateddeep problems in the marriage.Few friends of the pair were surprised, therefore, when Nicole filed for divorcefrom O.J. Simpson in 1992. She won a $433,000 cash settlement, plus $10,000 amonth in child-support for their two children.O.J. Simpson was in Santa Monica at the time of the murders – his house beingonly a few blocks from Nicole’s – but he was not there when police called toinform him of the death of his ex-wife. He had caught a flight to Chicago at11:45 pm – less than two hours after the killings.A limousine, booked to take him to the airport had arrived at 10:25 pm, but thedriver, Allan Park, failed to get any response when he rang the doorbell. Usedto the often eccentric behaviour of LA’s upper crust, Park went back to thelimousine and waited.At 10:56 pm Park saw a big man in dark clothes walk up the drive and enterSimpson’s home. He assumed that this was O.J., though it was too dark to make apositive identification. A few minutes later O.J. opened the front door and toldPark that he had been inside all the time, but had dozed off and had not heardthe doorbell. They then drove to the airport and O.J. caught his flight toChicago without incident.The police tracked Simpson to the O’Hare Plaza Hotel the following morning. Theofficer assigned the difficult task of telephoning to inform a national herothat his ex-wife had been murdered, nevertheless noted that O.J. did not askhow, when or where Nicole had died – the usual questions immediately asked by arelative of a murder victim. O.J. didn’t even ask if the murderer had beencaught.Homicide officers very gently questioned O.J. for about half an hour later thatday. He denied any knowledge or involvement in the killings but was, at the sametime, vague about his movements on the previous evening. The investigatorsfailed to press him on these points.Many people later thought the interviewers were too easy on Simpson. Follow-upquestions were not asked and several obvious lines of inquiry were not pursuedat all. This might have been because O.J. seemed to be emotionally shattered,and officers didn’t want to upset him further, but his demeanour might also havebeen the behaviour of a guilty murderer. As any experienced homicide detectivewill testify, the first interview with a murderer is often the most important,as they may not have invented all the details of their false alibi and can becaught out and encouraged to confess.The interviewing police did notice, however, that O.J. had a bandage on his lefthand. He told them that he had a deep cut to the palm, but claimed not toremember where he got the wound. This was one of the key issues thatinvestigators were criticized for not pursuing. O.J. later claimed to have cuthis hand reaching into his Ford Bronco car on the night of the murders. He hadreopened the wound, he said, when, stricken by grief at the news of Nicole’sdeath, he had crushed a hotel water glass. The prosecution at his later trialclaimed that this injury had actually been sustained during the murders.Despite the obvious reasons to suspect O.J. Simpson’s involvement in the doublemurder, the Los Angeles police continued to treat him with kid gloves – he was,after all, a popular celebrity and in fact had several close friends in theLAPD. This unwonted leniency was another bone of contention during the latertrial, with many commentators concluding that this was evidence of specialpolice treatment for rich and influential suspects.The police allowed O.J. to remain free; an almost unheard of privilege for aperson suspected of violent homicide. The normal procedure would have been tohold him for questioning until investigators had enough evidence to charge andarrest him or, if such evidence was not forthcoming, until they had to let himgo under the habeas corpus rule. In fact, even after amassing enough evidence toissue a warrant for Simpson’s arrest, the LAPD allowed him to remain at largeuntil after Nicole’s funeral. They simply asked the man they had charged with asavage double killing to hand himself in at his local police station at 10 thefollowing morning.Simpson failed to turn up. The police and Simpson’s lawyer drove up to O.J.’shouse, but found it empty. However a note was discovered, written ‘To whom itmay concern’, and phrased in such a way as to hint that O.J. had killed himself,but without actually saying so directly.Any anxiety O.J.’s friends in the LAPD might have felt were soon allayed. O.J.was spotted being driven by a friend, A.C. Cowlings, on the nearby freeway in awhite Ford Bronco. There followed a farcical ‘slow-motion’ chase in which dozensof police cars and several news helicopters followed the slow moving Bronco asit drove around the Los Angeles road system. Police negotiators talked to bothmen via mobile phone and Simpson eventually had himself driven to his home,where he was finally arrested. The car was found to contain a gun, $8,750, apassport and a false beard.In their very first decision in the case – as to where the trial was to takeplace – the prosecution made what many believe to have been a bad tacticalblunder. Normal procedure would have been to conduct the trial in the area inwhich the crime took place: Santa Monica. But the prosecutors instead asked forthe case to be heard in downtown Los Angeles. They explained that the largerdowntown courthouse would allow more members of the press and media to cover thetrial and, rather selfishly, that the members of the prosecution team would alsohave less of a commute each day if the trial was not held in distant SantaMonica.In fact, these reasons were almost certainly a cover for the real reason thetrial was held away from affluent Santa Monica: the authorities’ fear of racerioting.Three years earlier, on 3 March 1991, four white LA police officers had stoppedspeeding black driver, Rodney King, and proceeded to hit him 36 times with heavynightsticks, unaware that a horrified member of the public was filming them.Despite the unprofessional and conflicting reports of the incident filed by theofficers and the apparently conclusive evidence of the videotaped beating, inApril the following year a majority white jury acquitted all four officers.Downtown Los Angeles exploded into violent race riots. In the following 6 days54 people were killed, 2,383 were injured, looters caused $700 million worth ofproperty damage and the National Guard had to be called out. Given this veryrecent history in the city, prosecutors in the Simpson case could have beenforgiven for erring on the side of caution.A jury called in the exclusive and rich Santa Monica neighbourhood would almostcertainly have a white majority. If such a jury convicted one of the mostpopular black men in the country, there might be serious repercussions. Adowntown jury, on the other hand, would almost certainly be racially mixed – asit in fact was. Many commentators have suggested that the outcome of the casewas influenced by the positive discrimination of the black majority jury.Another prosecution mistake – also perhaps politically motivated – was to droptheir option to call for the death penalty if Simpson were to be convicted. Manystudies have shown that a so-called ‘death qualified’ jury is more likely toconvict, because those that oppose the death penalty are automaticallydisqualified from capital punishment cases. People who are against capitalpunishment are statistically more prone to find defendants not guilty, whereas ajury of people who have all indicated their support of the death penalty aremore likely to find a defendant guilty.The 133-day ‘trial of the century’ followed, starting on 24 July 1995. There wasunprecedented press coverage. TV cameras were allowed in the court by JudgeLance Ito, and from the beginning the often tedious courtroom developments gotas much news coverage as the average major war. Asked how he intended to plead,O.J. Simpson replied emphatically: ‘Absolutely 100 per cent not guilty.’The prosecution’s case was that Simpson was a jealous and abusive husband whohad preferred to murder his estranged wife rather than see her with another man.He had, they said, confronted Nicole and Goldman after letting himself into hergarden. O.J. had clearly planned to commit murder because he had brought along-bladed weapon with him. After the killings he had made his way back to hisown estate, hurriedly disposed of some, but not all, of the incriminatingevidence, then had calmly caught a flight to Chicago.The chief evidence for this theory – aside from numerous witnesses who had seenor heard O.J. threatening Nicole at one time or another – was the cut onSimpson’s hand, dating from the night of the murder, and a pair of socks and aleather glove found in Simpson’s home. They were stained with blood that DNAtesting showed to belong to Nicole Simpson. Furthermore, blood found at themurder scene had been DNA tested and, the prosecution claimed, had beenpositively proved to be O.J. Simpson’s.Although a largely circumstantial case, few would have bet on Simpson’sacquittal.The prosecution first presented witnesses to O.J.’s willingness to kill Nicoleand his predilection for marital violence. Nicole’s sister, Denise Brown,described a family meal during which O.J. had grabbed Nicole by the crotch andsaid loudly: ‘This is where babies come from, and this belongs to me.’ Anothertime, she said, she had seen O.J. pick up Nicole and literally throw her againsta wall.Denise also described seeing O.J. at his daughter’s school dance recital only afew hours before the double murder. She told the court that he looked ‘scary’like a ‘madman’.Ron Shipp, a friend of Simpson, described how O.J. had told him once that ‘I’vehad dreams of killing Nicole.’Finally, and visibly disturbing to the jury, the prosecution played a tape of anemergency services 911 call made by Nicole. The eerie sound of the dead woman’svoice filled the court, begging for assistance because her husband, O.J., hadjust beaten her and was threatening to do it again. O.J. himself could be heardshouting furiously in the background of the recording.Next the prosecution offered evidence that O.J. Simpson had actually committedthe murder. The limousine driver, Allan Park, testified to the apparent absenceof O.J. from his home at 10:25 pm – approximately half an hour after the murders– and the arrival of the unidentified man who had looked like Simpson at 10:56pm. He added that when O.J. had finally emerged from the house to go to theairport, he had been carrying a small black bag. Park offered to carry this bagalong with the other luggage, but Simpson declined. O.J. was not carrying thebag when he checked onto his flight a few minutes later, and an airport staffmember was called by the prosecution to testify that he had seen O.J.approaching a rubbish bin. The implication was that this was how Simpson had gotrid of the murder weapon.O.J. Simpson’s house had not been empty on the night of the killing; there was ahouseguest called Kato Kaelin staying there. He testified that he and O.J. hadgone on a ‘run for Big Macs and French fries’ at around 9:30 pm. He had not seenO.J. again after they got back. Then, just before 11 pm, Kaelin had heardseveral loud thumps on his wall. Again, the prosecution wished the jury to inferthat after the food run, Simpson had slipped out, committed the murders and hadbeen crashing about when he got back, trying to deal with the bloody evidence ofhis crimes.This final, possibly clinching proof – the physical evidence – was theconcluding part of the prosecution case. First there was the wound on O.J.’sleft palm. His vague explanations to the police could not hide the fact that thecut looked very like a knife wound, perhaps sustained during a frenzied attack.Several technical experts testified that hair, clothing fibres and footprintsfound at the murder scene indicated Simpson’s presence. There was also bloodfound there – DNA testing showed that only 0.5 per cent of the population couldhave deposited this blood; O.J. Simpson was one of this very select group.The police had found a pair of bloodstained socks at the foot of O.J.’s bed and,even more damning, an extra large Aris Light leather glove, of a type Simpsonwas known to wear, was found at the murder scene. Another such glove –apparently the partner of the murder scene glove – was found soaked in blood, ina hallway of O.J.’s house. The likely inference was that O.J. had attacked hisvictims with only his right hand gloved (there was no cut to the palm of theleft glove), had sustained the wound to his left hand, then dropped the leftglove at the crime scene. He had accidentally dropped the blood-soaked rightglove in his hall during his efforts to clean himself up to catch his flight toChicago.DNA testing pointed to a 6.8 billion-to-one likelihood that the blood on thegloves and socks belonged to Nicole Simpson Brown – she was probably the onlyperson on earth with blood to match the samples.Short of the murder having been videoed by a member of the public, theprosecution case could not have been stronger – at least, that is what numerouspress commentators believed before the council for the defence began theirattack on the evidence.If the prosecution had gone about the trial as if Simpson were not a superstar –presenting the evidence concisely and plainly – they probably would have stood abetter chance of winning a conviction. However, under the unnerving publicspotlight, they decided to err towards excess and cross every ‘t’ and dot every‘i’. They brought in so many witnesses – 72 in all – that the jury, not tomention the worldwide viewing public, apparently became tired, confused and nota little bored. A more direct and forceful case would have presented the fairlydamning evidence much more effectively.O.J. Simpson’s defence team – dubbed the ‘Dream Team’ by the press, because theycomprised some of the best lawyers in the country, including F. Lee Bailey –sought to exploit the tired confusion of the jury to sow a seed of doubt. Inthis task they were given invaluable help by one of the prosecution’s starwitnesses: Officer Mark Fuhrman of the LAPD.During the prosecution’s questioning of Fuhrman – the officer who had found theglove in Simpson’s house – he had been presented as a model policeman. Thedefence cross-examination, however, soon exploded this image. He was asked if hehad ever used the ‘N-word’ (nigger) to which he immediately replied that theword had never passed his lips. The defence then played an audio tape – madewhile he was acting as an advisor for a TV show about the LAPD – in whichFuhrman not only used the ‘N-word’ with racist abandon, but also admitted toplanting evidence to help secure convictions.The Dream Team built much of their defence argument on Fuhrman’s racial bigotryand admissions of evidence planting. The glove in Simpson’s house, theyinsisted, had originally been at the crime scene with the other, but Fuhrman haddipped it in Nicole’s blood and had transplanted it to O.J.’s hall. Presumablyhe also took a pair of O.J.’s socks back to the murder scene, dipped them inblood and then transported them back to be found under his bed. Predictably (andarguably with good reason) the prosecution objected repeatedly to this purelytheoretic line of defence but, despite the lack of supporting evidence, JudgeIto allowed it to go into the record.After their defeat over Officer Fuhrman, the prosecution attempted to win backthe lost ground by getting O.J. to put on the gloves in front of the jury. Thiswas another crashing mistake because the gloves were self-evidently too smallfor him. Visibly shocked and demoralized at the complete reversal of theirattempted coup, the prosecution team later pointed out that a leather glovesoaked in blood would have shrunk, but the damage could not be undone.Even what might have been a case-winning stroke in other circumstances could notsave the prosecution. When the defence called a doctor to state that, despitehis bulk and golfing activity, O.J. was a martyr to arthritis (less a physiquelike Tarzan than of ‘Tarzan’s grandfather’) the prosecution played a recentvideo in which O.J. was to be seen doing very vigorous exercises. At one pointhe even performed a number of punching movements while joking to the camera thatthis was one to try ‘with the wife’.In what could be called a dazzling display of smoke and mirrors, the defenceteam argued, with little or no supporting evidence, that there was a racistconspiracy to convict the innocent O.J. Simpson. They also presented characterwitnesses who swore to O.J.’s gentle nature and called their own forensicexpert, Dr Henry Lee, who rubbished the DNA evidence of the prosecution’s bloodsamples. Today his testimony can be seen to be far from incontrovertible, but in1994 DNA profiling was still being questioned and the science was mistrusted bymembers of the general public. So Dr Lee’s refutation of the prosecutionevidence seems to have carried a lot of weight with the jury.In the final summings-up, the difference between the prosecution and defenceteams were thrown into sharp contrast. Prosecutor Marcia Clark spent much of hertime attacking one of her own witnesses: Mark Fuhrman. He was the ‘worst type’of cop – one you wouldn’t want ‘on this planet’ – but Fuhrman’s personal faultsdid not add up to proof of a criminal conspiracy to convict an innocent man nor,indeed, prove that O.J. Simpson was guiltless. The entire speech soundeddefensive, even though her logic could not be faulted.On the other hand, Johnny Cochran, for the defence, was anything but defensive.He too attacked Officer Fuhrman, comparing him to Hitler. From there Cochranproceeded to attack Hitler’s racism and ‘anti-religionism’. What this had to dowith the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman is unclear, butCochran certainly managed to underline the dangers of white racism to a jury ofwhich nine members were black. (Fellow Dream Team member Robert Shapiro lateraccused Cochran of ‘not only playing the race card, but playing it from thebottom of the deck’.)Cochran concluded by stressing that the jury should not convict if there was ashadow of a doubt in their minds. Echoing the moment when O.J. put on the glovesand showed they were too small (or shrunken) for his hands, Cochran repeated thelitany: ‘If it doesn’t fit, you must acquit.’The jury took just three hours to acquit O.J. Simpson on all charges.In his post trial statement, O.J. Simpson insisted that he would dedicate therest of his life to tracking down the actual killer of his ex-wife. He gotlittle time to do this, however, as the bereaved families immediately filed acivil suit, demanding damages from O.J. for killing their loved ones (civilcases can only award financial penalties).All over the US, African–Americans were jubilant, while whites were stunned andenraged. This was reflected in the title of a book called Outrage by VincentBugliosi, the prosecutor in the Manson case, who defiantly subtitled the bookThe Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away With Murder. He saw the major reasonas Judge Ito’s decision to allow the defence to play ‘the race card’. And thecover blurb says: ‘there were disastrous lapses in the prosecution’s strategywhich allowed damaging defense testimony to go unchallenged; prosecutors Clarkand Darden failed to stand up to the abuses of Judge Ito, thereby hurting theircredibility with the jury; the final summations were weakly constructed,listlessly argued, and, most unforgivably, inadequately prepared. The trial wasa travesty of justice, a showcase of incompetence.’In what is probably the best account of the case, The Run of His Life – ThePeople v O.J. Simpson, by New York Times journalist Jeffrey Toobin, the authorleaves no doubt that he regards Simpson as guilty, blaming his acquittal, likeBugliosi, on the incompetent prosecution. And he rules out totally the defence’sattempt to show that the police planted evidence, pointing out that this wouldhave been impossibly complicated.Where Judge Ito in the criminal trial was often criticized for letting lawyerson both sides wander off the case into wild theories, Judge Hiroshi Fujisake,who sat on the civil proceedings, kept a tight ship. All attempts by O.J.’sdefence team to suggest that their client was the victim of a huge, ifunprovable, racist conspiracy were overruled by the bench. Only solid evidencewas accepted onto the court record.Some new evidence at the civil trial showed that O.J. Simpson had lied to policein one important matter – the footprints found around the murder victims. Theprints of the murderer proved to have been made by a pair of size twelve BrunoMagli shoes. Simpson had denied ever owning such a pair of shoes, but picturestaken before the murders were found by the newspapers, clearly showing Simpsonwearing Bruno Magli shoes of the type that had made the prints. Simpson’s feetwere also size twelve.O.J. Simpson had not been called to give evidence in the criminal trial, but wasforced to in the civil case. He made a bad impression on the stand, mumblingreplies to questions and looking furtive.After a deliberation of seventeen hours, the civil jury concluded that O.J.Simpson was liable for the ‘wrongfully caused deaths of Ronald Goldman andNicole Brown Simpson’. He was ordered to pay compensatory damages of $8.5million to the bereaved families and $25 million in punitive damages. This didnot reduce him to a pauper because, under California law, he was able to set upa $25,000-a-month pension fund that could not be touched by any legal judgementagainst him.Toobin points out that in the civil case, the only juror who thought Simpsoninnocent was a middle-aged black woman.As a result of the case Simpson’s contracts with Hertz Rentacar and NBC werecancelled. And although never formally expelled from the Riviera Country Club,where he played golf, he was informed that he would no longer be welcome there.A two-hour videotape interview with him about the murders was a commercial flop.Then followed a lengthy legal battle over whether Simpson should have access tothe two children he had had with Nicole Brown Simpson, which he won.In America, as under most democratic legal systems, O.J. Simpson cannot bebrought before a criminal court twice for the same crime without dramatic newevidence coming to light that calls for a verdict of mistrial on the first case.It is perhaps indicative that, despite his promise to ‘hunt down’ his ex-wife’skiller, O.J. Simpson has apparently done nothing substantial towards that end.On the other hand, Simpson has started to make tentative moves towardsrestarting his public career as a celebrity.In 2006, O.J. starred in a one-off show called Juiced on pay-per-viewtelevision. In the show he appeared in disguise, backed up by a variety ofcharacter actors, playing pranks on unsuspecting members of the public. When atrick was finally revealed for what it was, O.J. would whip off his disguise andshout ‘You’ve been juiced!’ to the bemused sucker. Some might say that theprogramme had a distinct freak show element: an unsubtle touch of ‘Come and payto see the man accused of murder act like a fool in public!’ Others mightsuggest that OJ was again flaunting his delight at fooling the public in frontof their very faces.This apparent willingness to debase himself in public to try to restart hiscelebrity career then took an even nastier turn. In November 2006, RupertMurdoch’s HarperCollins Publishers announced that one of their imprints,ReaganBooks, was planning to publish a memoir by O.J. Simpson, titled If I DidIt. The book was rumoured to first describe Simpson’s relationship with Nicolethen go on to describe, ‘hypothetically’, exactly what might have happened ‘if’he had killed her and Goldman.However, much as criminologists might have loved to study O.J.’s ‘hypothesis’,the project was swiftly stopped by Rupert Murdoch himself as soon as it becameclear just how big a public outcry was likely to take place over the book – andthe two, hour-long interviews that O.J. had recorded and that were scheduledwith Fox News. The airing of the interviews was cancelled and all copies of thebook are said to have been pulped.So, did O.J. do ‘it’? The writing of a pseudo confession certainly seems tosuggest that he did, even if he continues to declare his innocence. It isinteresting that Johnny Cochran – the one man most responsible for getting O.J.acquitted in the criminal trial – is said, before he was assigned to the DreamTeam, to have told a friend: ‘OJ is in massive denial. He obviously did it.’"},{"pageContent":"SINATRA, FRANKSWING WHEN YOU’RE SINNINGFRANCIS ALBERT SINATRA was the only child of a reasonably well-off family inHoboken, New Jersey. As a child he wore Fauntleroy suits, and was given anythinghe wanted. Even at the age of fifteen, he still played with dolls, whileaffectionate uncles kept him well supplied with candy. In fact, he wasthoroughly spoilt, exploding into fits of rage when he was not allowed his ownway – which helps to explain why he went on to become one of the most detestableindividuals in twentieth century show business. When he lost his temper, whichwas not infrequently, he went virtually insane – on one occasion, he tried tohurl one of his retinue out of his private aeroplane in midair, and was onlyprevented from committing murder when others restrained him.This kind of conduct has characterized many tyrants in history, including Ivanthe Terrible and Adolf Hitler, but probably Sinatra is the only popularentertainer who can claim that distinction.Sinatra was lucky. He was more than seventy years old when someone finally daredto tell the whole truth about him. This was the journalist Kitty Kelley, in abiography called His Way, and it is her version, rather than the many accountsby star-struck admirers, that will be followed in the following pages.Francis Albert Sinatra was born on 12 December 1915, in an Italian and Irishneighbourhood in Hoboken. ‘Everybody carried a twelve inch pipe then – and theyweren’t studying to be plumbers,’ Sinatra later remarked. But, as we have seen,this attempt to portray himself as a tough, deprived kid was a myth he inventedhimself.His father, Anthony Martin Sinatra (known as Marty), was physically a small man,born in Sicily, who started life as a bantamweight boxer. Sinatra’s mother,Dolly, was an extrovert blonde, who dominated the family, and was known as apractising abortionist. She was born in Genoa.When Sinatra was six, his uncle Babe – his mother’s younger brother – gothimself arrested for driving a getaway car after the driver of a Railway Expresstruck was shot to death. Dolly went to court every day, pretending to be Babe’swife, and holding a baby, which she had borrowed. She sobbed noisily, declaringthat the baby needed his father, but the judge declined to be swayed, andsentenced Babe to fifteen years hard labour.When Prohibition arrived in 1919, Dolly Sinatra lost no time in becoming abootlegger, adding to the family’s already adequate income.At the age of sixteen, Sinatra entered Demarest High School, but was expelledwithin a few months for being rowdy. He had always disliked school, and histeachers regarded him as lazy.With no qualifications, there were not many jobs open to him. His mother got hima job on the local newspaper, the Jersey Observer, on which his godfather wasthe circulation manager. He worked on the delivery truck, heaving around bundlesof newspapers for $12 a week. When the sportswriter on the paper was killed in acar crash, Sinatra’s mother told him to take over the job and, accordingly,Sinatra went and sat at his dead colleague’s desk, assuring the editor that hisgodfather had given him permission to be there. When his godfather admitted heknew nothing about it, Sinatra was fired. Both Sinatra and his mother were sofurious that they never again spoke to his godfather. Dolly Sinatra had alreadypushed her husband into a job at the fire department by using political contactsat City Hall.Dolly made so much money from her abortion practice that the family was able tomove into a new house. It cost more than $13,000 – an astronomical sum when mosthouses cost less than a quarter of that sum. And although her son was out ofwork, Dolly Sinatra bought him a car in which he took out his first girlfriends.When he was seventeen, it was a girlfriend who suggested that he should form aband to play at school dances. The quartet, which they called the Hoboken Four,was a success, and Sinatra began doing vocals, inspired by the singer he admiredmost – Bing Crosby. His mother bought him a PA system, and when other localbands wanted to use it, Sinatra was usually allowed to sing. But since his voicewas so light, most of his neighbours agreed that he was awful.When he was twenty, Sinatra appeared in his first film, made in the New YorkBiograph Studios in the Bronx. He made-up with a black face and wore a top hat.And Dolly Sinatra, who had lobbied vigorously to get her son this job, invitedthe cast over for a large breakfast before Frankie drove them out to the studio.The Hoboken Four appeared on stage in the Capitol Theater on 8 September 1935,in a talent competition, and walked away with first prize. The result was thatthey were signed up at $50 a week, and went on tour with other acts.It was on this tour, when he was 23, that Sinatra became accustomed to adoringfemale fans, which enraged the other three members of the quartet. The resultwas that the skinny, undersized Frank was often beaten up. He finally got tiredof it, and walked out on the quartet to return home.He began taking elocution lessons, and one of his friends commented that hebegan to sound like an Englishman.In 1938, while he was still 23, Sinatra was taken on as a singing waiter at aroadhouse called The Rustic Cabin – the pay was $15 a week. One of his fellowmusicians later put it on record that ‘he didn’t seem to have any talent.’Nevertheless, Sinatra began to sing on the radio every Saturday evening.It was at The Rustic Cabin that Sinatra became the subject of a dispute betweentwo girls; Toni Della Penta who had been made pregnant by him not long before,but had had a miscarriage, and Nancy Barbato, a stonemason’s daughter who wasseveral years Sinatra’s junior. After Toni had tried to tear off Nancy’s dress,Sinatra sent Nancy away, and then told Toni that he had to marry Nancy becauseshe was pregnant. Toni went straight to the police and swore out a morals chargeagainst Sinatra – that he’d had sexual intercourse with her having promised hermarriage. That was the first of two occasions when Sinatra spent time in jail ona charge of seduction.Toni finally agreed to let Sinatra out of jail when he promised that his motherwould apologize to her for treating her as her inferior. But after anotherscreaming fight between Toni and Dolly, it was Toni who was arrested.Probably to end this kind of thing, Dolly Sinatra pushed her son into marryingNancy Barbato. This was on 4 February 1939, when Sinatra was 23. He was making$25 a week as a singing waiter, and Nancy was making $15 as a secretary.Sinatra’s first break came when the trumpeter Harry James heard him singing onthe radio. James had just left the Benny Goodman band to set up on his own.James went along to watch him sing and said that he knew immediately that ‘hewas destined to be a great vocalist’. So in June 1939, Sinatra’s salary suddenlyincreased to $75 a week. Harry James suggested that Sinatra should call himselfFrankie Satin, but Dolly immediately vetoed that.Sinatra’s early recordings were not a success; his ‘All or Nothing at All’ solda mere 8,000 copies. He was unhappy at the lack of acclaim, but cheered up whenHarry James was booked into the Palomar in Hollywood. Unfortunately, this burneddown before they got there. Another club accused the band of playing too loud,and they were thrown out when Sinatra was halfway through singing ‘All orNothing at All’.Soon after that, when James’s band was playing in Chicago, the band leader TommyDorsey slipped Sinatra a note asking him to meet him, and offered him a job at$125 a week. Sinatra did not hesitate. His replacement with Harry James was asinger called Dick Haymes, who became a film star.Within a few months of working for Dorsey, Sinatra recorded a song called ‘I’llNever Smile Again’, and suddenly became famous – the record stayed in the hitparade for weeks.The drummer, Buddy Rich, resented Sinatra’s elevation, and the two became swornenemies. On one occasion, Sinatra hurled a jug of iced water at Rich’s head, andit shattered all over the wall, leaving pieces of glass stuck in the plaster.Finally, Dorsey fired Sinatra for two weeks, until he agreed to keep his temper.Sinatra was finding it hard being a famous singer and a married man. Alwayshighly sexed, he saw no reason why he should not take advantage of the dozens ofteenage fans who literally swooned as he sang.He went to Hollywood with the band and made his first film, Las Vegas Nights,for Paramount, in which he sang ‘I’ll Never Smile Again’. He had a major loveaffair with a blonde starlet called Alora Gooding, and they began to livetogether. Rita Maritt was fresh from a convent school when Sinatra seduced herat the age of sixteen. Another mistress was a socialite named Mary Lou Watts,whose father was an oil baron. It was Mary Lou who finally persuaded Sinatra toeradicate the last traces of New Jersey from his accent.By 1941, Sinatra had displaced Bing Crosby as the top American vocalist.Sinatra was driven by consuming ambition, particularly after he made a recordwith ‘The Song is You’ on one side and ‘Lamplighter’s Serenade’ on the other. Heplayed it over and over again, obviously amazed at his own vocal skill. Shortlyafter that, he gave Dorsey notice. Dorsey took it very badly indeed, feeling –rightly – that he had made Sinatra. Shortly afterwards, he agreed to let Sinatrago for $60,000.The story went around that the Mafia boss Willie Moretti had called on Dorsey inhis dressing room and waved a revolver at him. Both Dorsey and Sinatra deniedthis. Dorsey is quoted as saying of Sinatra: ‘He’s the most fascinating man inthe world, but don’t stick your hand in the cage.’The first time Sinatra sang on his own at New York’s Paramount Theater, hisbacking was Benny Goodman. The clarinettist had never heard of Sinatra, but assoon as the vocalist walked out on stage, the girls in the audience began toscream and Goodman, his arms raised to start the orchestra, looked over hisshoulder and said: ‘What the fuck was that?’ Soon after that, Sinatra’s newpress agent, George Evans, hired plump teenage girls wearing bobby sox (anklesocks) to shriek as Sinatra sang. Evans’s relentless publicity campaign mademillions of males all over the world furious, and turned millions of women intofans. Bing Crosby had certainly never provoked this hysteria. Evans also made agreat deal of the fact that Sinatra was a happily married family man, and gothim to say things like: ‘Nobody comes before my wife Nancy.’Sinatra was now making larger sums than he’d ever dreamed of, thousands ofdollars a week. But he accepted a mere $800 a week for an engagement at a NewYork nightclub, the Riobamber, taking third place in the billing – the two leadstars were paid twice that much. The nightclub was in trouble with dwindlingaudiences, but within days it was jammed to the doors for every Sinatraperformance, and finally the other two stars were sacked so that Sinatra couldtake over on his own. His pay was also doubled.When he returned to the Paramount Theater, screaming teenagers surrounded thebuilding and broke down the doors. According to Nick Sevano, Sinatra’s ‘butler’,the girls threw their bras and panties at him. ‘They went nuts, absolutelynuts.’Sinatra suddenly found himself the centre of a storm of criticism. From then on,almost every attack on Sinatra involved the word ‘hysteria’. One doctor evensaid it was due to ‘mammary hyperaesthesia’.Nick Sevano also mentions that Sinatra showed an increasing tendency to fly offthe handle. ‘He’d just go crazy if things weren’t done the minute he wanted themdone.’ In short, Sinatra was turning into a full-blown version of the spoiltchild he had always been.As criticism mounted that Sinatra, unlike most of his famous contemporaries, wasstaying well clear of the war, he finally decided that it was time to make amove. His preliminary medical showed him to be 1-A. But a month later he wasfound to be 4-F because of a tiny puncture in his eardrum.Not long after that, Sinatra fired Nick Sevano, who had been with him for fouryears. Nancy Sinatra was irritated because Nick was going to Hollywood with hisboss while Nancy had to stay in New York and look after their two children. Oneday, she saw Sevano going into Sinatra’s bedroom and taking a ten dollar bill –which he needed to make some purchases that Sinatra had asked for. Nancy toldSinatra Nick was a thief. And she kept up the nagging until Sinatra agreed tofire him.In Hollywood, Sinatra sang at The Hollywood Bowl with the backing of a symphonyorchestra, and had to tell his teenage fans not to scream. He had a recordaudience. And by 1944, Sinatra was not only the most famous singer in America –he was the most famous singer in the world.Soon after that, he became equally famous as a film star. His first film Higherand Higher drew huge audiences, even though one critic called it Lower andLower. After that, Sinatra went on to make one of his best movies, AnchorsAweigh, with Gene Kelly.Sinatra now decided to move out to California, and bought Mary Astor’s hugeestate in the San Fernando Valley. His mother Dolly was indignant because Nancywas also taking her sisters with her. But then, Dolly had become a socialcelebrity in New Jersey ever since her son achieved worldwide fame, so she hadnothing to complain about.When Roosevelt stood for re-election in the autumn of 1944, Sinatra supportedhis campaign, and gave $5,000 to it. When he performed in the Paramount Theater,begging the screaming girls to be quiet, one disgusted male member of theaudience managed to hit him in the face with three eggs.When, early in 1945, Sinatra again had to appear before the draft board to checkon his health status, he was upgraded to 2-AF, which meant that there was apossibility he might after all be inducted into the army. As a result, therewere headlines about girls threatening to commit suicide if Sinatra was drafted.Comedian Phil Silvers thought of an interesting way to defuse some of thehostility. When he first appeared in front of troops in Italy, Sinatra waspresented as the underdog, continually interrupted and slapped down by Silvers.The result was that a sympathetic audience begged Sinatra to sing ‘Nancy Withthe Laughing Face’, a song Silvers had written for Sinatra’s four-year-olddaughter Nancy.Sinatra learned an interesting lesson – that a good way of defusing hostilitywas to make fun of yourself.Soon after this, Sinatra discovered a new way of courting popularity. He beganpleading against racial intolerance, and talking about the problems of juveniledelinquency. The discovery that the millionaire singer had a social consciencewent down well with the music critics.But Phil Silvers’s wife remarked: ‘He was a sincere liberal . . . but then hewas always mean to the little people around him. He seemed to enjoy makingpeople look little in front of others.’One of the men Sinatra admired most was ‘Bugsy’ Siegel, the head of the Mafia onthe West Coast. When Sinatra and Silvers saw Siegel in a restaurant where theywere eating dinner, they stood up, saying: ‘Hello, Mr Siegel. How are you?’‘They were like two children seeing Santa Claus,’ said Silvers’s wife. Sheadded: ‘Like Bugsy, Frank had a Mafia red-neck mentality.’Sinatra was also not averse to demonstrating his power over women. When a groupof his buddies were sharing an apartment where they held bachelor orgies,Sinatra arrived with Marlene Dietrich, took her by the hand, and led her pastthe card-playing men into the bedroom.In Hollywood, Sinatra was getting a bad name for being temperamental. He oftenkept members of the MGM crew standing around all day long, and simply didn’tshow up. When a Hollywood columnist, Erskine Johnson, criticized Sinatra, he gota telegram saying: JUST CONTINUE TO PRINT LIES ABOUT ME AND MY TEMPER – NOT MYTEMPERAMENT – WE’LL SEE THAT YOU GET A BELT IN YOUR VICIOUS AND STUPID MOUTH.His temperament also caused problems with his wife Nancy. In October 1946 hewalked out on her, and went to Palm Springs where he began seeing Ava Gardnerand Lana Turner. It was Phil Silvers who engineered a public reconciliation in aHollywood restaurant.Closer ties with the Mob seem to have started in January 1947, when he renewed afriendship with the Chicago gangster Jo Fischetti, a cousin of Al Capone. ‘LuckyLuciano’ had been exiled to Cuba, and Mafia bosses from across the country weregoing to see him in Havana. Sinatra was invited to join them. Sinatra wasphotographed with Luciano, and with other gangsters, including Albert Anastasia,Carlo Gambino, Vito Genovese, Frank Costello and many others. ‘Doc’ Stacher, whocontrolled slot machines for the gangster Meyer Lansky, is quoted as saying:‘The Italians among us were very proud of Frank. They always told me they hadspent a lot of money helping him in his career . . .’Unfortunately, this publicity backfired on Luciano when a newspaperman – andlater novelist – Robert Ruark denounced Sinatra for ‘cavorting among the scum’,which resulted in Luciano being arrested and sent back to Italy. It was fromthen on that Sinatra had the reputation of being mixed up with mobsters. Sinatraexplained his position by saying: ‘Any report that I’ve fraternized with goonsand racketeers is a vicious lie. I was brought up to shake a man’s hand when Iam introduced to him without first investigating his past.’ But on a visit toNaples, Sinatra gave Luciano a solid gold cigarette case inscribed: ‘To my dearpal Charlie.’Another columnist who took issue with Sinatra over his friendship with gangsterswas Lee Mortimer, who, among other things, referred to Sinatra as ‘Frank (Lucky)Sinatra’. In April 1947, in the Hollywood nightclub Ciro’s, Sinatra saw Mortimerleaving with a female singer. At the front door, Sinatra’s friends grabbedMortimer – who was not a large man – while Sinatra called him ‘a fuckinghomosexual’ and hit him. Mortimer fell down and Sinatra’s friends held himpinned to the ground while Sinatra continued hitting him.A photographer called Nat Dallinger saw the fight and intervened. Sinatra andhis friends finally backed off.At two in the morning, Sinatra’s West Coast publicity agent Jack Keller wasawakened by a reporter, who told him that Sinatra had just hit somebody. Afterthat, the phone went on ringing with enquiries from journalists. Then Sinatraknocked on Keller’s door saying: ‘Jeez, I think we’re in trouble.’ ‘You bet yourass we’re in trouble,’ said Keller and hastily took Sinatra to the house ofanother of the entourage. There, Sinatra was instructed to ring up thenewspapers and to tell them that the reason he attacked Mortimer was that heheard him saying to the lady he was escorting: ‘There’s that little dago bastardnow.’The next day, the newspapers reported that Sinatra had knocked Mortimer to theground with one punch because Mortimer had referred to him as a dago.Mortimer lost no time in swearing out a warrant for Sinatra’s arrest charginghim with assault and battery. The following day, Mortimer received two anonymouscalls threatening him unless he dropped the charges.Lee Mortimer worked for the newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, and allHearst’s newspapers took up the case. When MGM attorneys discovered that it wasuntrue that Mortimer had referred to Sinatra as a dago, Lewis B. Mayer orderedSinatra to pay Mortimer $9,000 in damages and to apologize publicly.Sinatra’s publicity man George Evans tried to persuade the famous Hollywoodcolumnist Louella Parsons to join the argument on Sinatra’s side, but sherefused. Eventually she relented, accepted a lunch invitation from Sinatra, andwas predictably charmed.The next problem was the Hearst press. But because he knew Hearst’s mistress,the actress Marion Davies, Sinatra succeeded in getting invited to tea withHearst, and the 84-year-old magnate, who was in failing health, was also charmedby him.Nevertheless, Sinatra’s next film, Miracle of the Bells, in which he played aCatholic priest, received such bad reviews that Sinatra refused at first to goto the premiere in San Franciso.His unpopularity made MGM decide to try and repeat the success of Anchors Aweighby teaming Sinatra with Gene Kelly again. The first film, Take Me Out to theBall Game, was a flop, but the second, Leonard Bernstein’s On the Town, hasbecome a classic.But Sinatra’s penchant for getting into trouble continued to make his privatelife unpredictable. His admiration for gangsters had led him to buy a couple ofrevolvers. One night in the autumn of 1948, Sinatra and Ava Gardner went out toa small place called Indio, in California, got drunk, and proceeded to fire offthe revolvers in all directions. Again, it was the West Coast publicity agentJack Keller who had to get them out of trouble. Sinatra and Gardner were injail, but the police chief had recognized Sinatra, and taken care that the pressdid not find out. Keller rang up a friend who ran a hotel and asked him how muchmoney he had in the safe. His friend said $30,000. Then Keller hired a plane andflew out to Indio. He sat down with the police chief and asked: ‘Okay chief, howmuch to keep this quiet?’ The chief thought that $10,000 would do for the moment– $5,000 for himself, $2,000 each for the arresting officers, and $1,000 to getrid of the hospital records of a man whose stomach had been grazed by a bullet.Keller paid it out, and then got the addresses of various storekeepers whoseshops had been hit by bullets. He went around to all of them and offered to payfor their damage on the spot. They all accepted. But the man who had been grazedwith the bullet was more difficult – he thought he might get more by taking itto court. He showed Keller the line made across his stomach by a bullet that hadgone through his clothes. But finally he accepted $10,000 to keep quiet.It was typical of Sinatra that he decided to fire Keller soon after this, fortelling his East Coast publicity agent, George Evans, about the trouble; heordered Evans to break the bad news. But Evans dug in his heels and refused.Whereupon Sinatra lost his temper and fired him too.By this time, Sinatra was involved in a passionate affair with Ava Gardner. Hehad become totally obsessed by her. Unfortunately, she had the same fierytemperament as Sinatra, and the result was violent clashes. One of Sinatra’sreasons for firing George Evans was that he’d strongly advised Sinatra to stopseeing her.The consequences of firing Evans were disastrous. With no one around to ensurefavourable items in the press, his appeal began to fade, and in the Downbeatpoll of 1949, Sinatra was in fifth place for the first time in six years.Magazines began to pan his latest records, and film critics panned his latestfilm, Take Me Out to the Ball Game. When he made it, Sinatra had been assuredthat his name would appear above Kelly’s. But by the time the second Kelly andSinatra film, On the Town came out, Sinatra was so unpopular that the studiodecided to give Gene Kelly top billing.There was more bad publicity when Sinatra walked out on his wife, Nancy, becauseshe wouldn’t give him a divorce. His ex-publicity agent George Evans prophesiedthat ‘a year from now you won’t hear anything about him. He’ll be deadprofessionally.’ Shortly after, Evans dropped dead of a heart attack. Sinatrawent to his funeral, and seemed to be devastated. And as the publicity aboutSinatra and Ava Gardner continued, Nancy Sinatra finally agreed to give him adivorce. As ‘the other woman’, Ava Gardner became almost as unpopular asSinatra. But she remained defiant, telling even the studio publicity team tomind its own business. The studio became seriously angry after Sinatra’s latestescapade. Ava Gardner had agreed to go to a party at the home of her formerhusband, bandleader Artie Shaw. Sinatra rang up and said he was calling to saygoodbye. When she asked where he was going, she heard the sound of two shots.She rushed from the party, screaming, and went to the hotel where she andSinatra were staying. He was in bed in his pyjamas, with two bullet holes in themattress. This was hastily exchanged for a mattress from another apartment, sothat when the police arrived, they could find no trace of bullet holes. MGMinsisted that Ava Gardner should leave for Spain immediately to start work on afilm called Pandora and the Flying Dutchman.MGM also decided to terminate Sinatra’s contract a year before its expiry date,agreeing to pay him $85,000. But Nancy Sinatra’s lawyer served the studio with arestraining order preventing them from paying the money until her maintenancesuit was settled.It began to look as if George Evans’s prediction was coming true.In Spain, Ava Gardner, irritated by Sinatra’s failure to get a divorce fromNancy, began a highly publicized affair with her costar, a bullfighter calledMario Cabre. On stage in a nightclub called The Copa, Sinatra’s voice suddenlygave out completely, and when he opened his mouth, not a sound came out. Thenext day, The Copa announced that Sinatra had suffered a haemorrhage of thethroat, but the truth was that it was purely psychosomatic – a form of hysteria.He rushed to Spain, quarrelled with Ava Gardner, then returned to New York,where crowds of reporters wanted to know if it was true that he had run awayfrom the Spanish bullfighter.Sinatra’s records were no longer selling, and his voice was beginning to fail.The Columbia Records engineers, who would often help out a singer by extendinghis notes in an echo chamber, were sick of his tantrums, and decided to donothing. Sinatra signed a three-year contract with CBS for a weekly televisionvariety show as well as a radio show, guaranteeing a quarter of a milliondollars a year. But after thirteen weeks, poor ratings led CBS to cancel theshow.Finally, Sinatra was forced to beg his Mob contacts for nightclub jobs, and manyof them obliged. Jo Fischetti, Al Capone’s cousin, gave him work in Chicago. Inreturn, Sinatra made a plane trip to Palm Springs with Fischetti to impress anautomobile tycoon from whom Fischetti was trying to buy a franchise. Because ofSinatra, the deal went through, and the Fischettis were able to open caragencies run by the Mob in various cities.Sinatra’s affiliations with the Mob were again brought to public attention in1950 in the nationally televised Kefauver hearings into organized crime. At oneof these hearings, photographs of Sinatra and Lucky Luciano in Havana were shownto the cameras. Joseph L. Nellis, one of the committee’s lawyers, reeled off along list of the names of gangsters – Frank Costello, Jo Adonis, Longy Zwillman,Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel – and Sinatra admitted that he knew them all and that‘those guys were okay’. But when asked whether he knew what business LuckyLuciano’s friends were in, Sinatra claimed he did not.He was divorced from Nancy in October 1951. A week earlier, he and Ava Gardnerhad taken James Mason – star of Pandora and the Flying Dutchman – and his wifePamela out to dinner. There Ava decided that Sinatra was paying too muchattention to a woman at a nearby table, and threw her six-carat diamondengagement ring across the room, shouting: ‘Let’s just call off this fuckingwedding.’ But they had made up the quarrel by the time of the wedding.The trouble was that Sinatra was almost demoniacally possessive. He told her toturn down a part in Hemingway’s The Snows of Kilimanjaro, because he wanted herwith him in New York, and finally only allowed her to act in the film when thestudio agreed to shoot her part in ten days.Ava Gardner could be equally temperamental. One night when she was in theaudience at a New Jersey nightclub, an ex-girlfriend of Sinatra’s, MarilynMaxwell, walked in. Convinced Sinatra was singing for Marilyn alone, Ava stormedout of the club, and flew back to California. It was one of dozens of suchspats.All this was reducing Sinatra to a nervous wreck. When he sang in his home townHoboken, his voice was so bad that the audience booed and threw fruit.It was Ava Gardner who finally gave her husband’s career the boost it needed sobadly. Sinatra had read James Jones’s bestseller From Here to Eternity, andthought that he would be good in the part of Maggio, the good-natured littleprivate who is beaten to death by a sadistic sergeant. Ava Gardner rang the wifeof Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia Pictures, to ask if she could go and seeher. When she was there, she begged her to help Sinatra get a screen test forMaggio. Mrs Cohn’s pressure on her husband worked, although Cohn had earlierdismissed Sinatra out of hand. But he finally agreed to give him a screen test.When Sinatra didn’t hear after many weeks, he decided to fly to Africa with hiswife, who was going to play opposite Clark Gable in Mogambo.There, for a week, the Sinatras raged at one another and fought, and GraceKelly, who was occupying the next tent, was shocked and told a friend: ‘Ava issuch a mess it’s unbelievable.’In the midst of this, the call for Sinatra’s screen test came, and he went backto Hollywood. Handed the script, Sinatra said: ‘I don’t need this – I’ve read itmany times.’ The test was so good that the producer, Buddy Adler, knewimmediately that Sinatra was the right man. However, Cohn was out of town, andso Sinatra went back to Africa. There he sank into total depression, and had tobe cheered up by Clark Gable.Fortunately for Sinatra, Eli Wallach, the actor Cohn preferred, demanded moremoney than Cohn was willing to pay. Cohn, torn between the two actors, finallyasked his wife to look at the screen test and decide. She pointed out thatWallach was much too heavily built to play the skinny little Maggio, so the partfinally went to Sinatra.From Here to Eternity surpassed everybody’s expectations. It was nominated asthe best picture of 1953, and everybody in it was showered with praise –Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, Donna Reed, Deborah Kerr – and of course,Sinatra. Everybody agreed that his portrayal of Private Maggio was a greatperformance – one critic said of it that Maggio’s death scene was one of thebest ever filmed.Sinatra behaved himself, except during the conclusion of the filming in Hawaii.He wanted to play a drunken scene sitting down, while the director, FredZinnemann, wanted it done standing up. Montgomery Clift, who shared the scene,also wanted to do it standing up, according to the script. Sinatra burst into aflood of obscenity, refusing even to compromise by having the scene shot bothways. Somebody had to ring Harry Cohn, who was just sitting down to dinner withhis wife, and who came over to the set and exploded with rage. Sinatra was toldhe was leaving on the next plane back to the US. Fortunately, by that time, thescene had been shot.But although From Here to Eternity was the turning point in his career, the filmhad not yet been released when he went on a singing tour of Europe. An Italianaudience booed him, he sang to half-full houses in Copenhagen, and in Malmö,Sweden, the press were so rude about his cutting short an open air performancein a park that the bad reviews decided Sinatra to cancel the rest of the tour.Sinatra and Gardner went back to America separately, and the fights were now sofrequent and so violent that by October 1953, MGM had announced that theirmarriage was over. On 18 November, Sinatra was found on the floor of an elevatorwith his wrists slashed. Finally, Sinatra was persuaded to see a psychiatrist –the same one who looked after Marilyn Monroe.His luck as a singer began to change when he signed with a new company, CapitolRecords, and was assigned Nelson Riddle as an arranger. It was Riddle’s swingingarrangements that finally put Sinatra back on top. The invention of thelong-playing record was also a break for Sinatra, because it enabled him tobuild up a mood over a whole side instead of being restricted to single songs.But in Spain, where she was making The Barefoot Contessa with Humphrey Bogart,Ava Gardner was now having an affair with the famous bullfighter Dominguin, andwas suing for divorce from Sinatra. Sinatra took it all very hard, and spent hisnights playing cards and getting drunk. After the divorce, which came through in1956, Sinatra told a friend that one of the insults Ava Gardner threw at him wasthat he was a ‘goddam hoodlum and a gangster’.Now his career was revitalized, Sinatra proceeded to prove her right by buying astake in the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, where he was among an impressive line-upof gangsters. The New Jersey mobster Joseph ‘Doc’ Stacher, who ran the Sands,admitted that Sinatra had been drawn in to attract the ‘high-rollers’. For thenext thirteen years, Sinatra made an enormous income from the Sands.One of the first completely frank assessments of Sinatra appeared in Lookmagazine. It was by a journalist called Bill Davidson, and the first article,‘Talent, tantrums and torment’, infuriated Sinatra so much that he threatened tosue the magazine for more than $2 million. The second article told the truthabout Sinatra’s upbringing in Hoboken – that he was not, as he liked to pretend,some poor slum kid, but a spoilt mama’s boy. The third article talked aboutSinatra’s sex life, and his obsessive promiscuity. (There was a saying inHollywood that the definition of a square was a hat check girl who hadn’t beento bed with Frank Sinatra.) Sinatra finally dropped the case.After the death of Humphrey Bogart from throat cancer in 1957, Sinatra begandating his wife, Lauren Bacall. After he proposed and she accepted, they went toa restaurant on Sunset Boulevard and when a girl came to their table asking forautographs, Sinatra told Bacall to put: ‘Betty Sinatra’. The result was that 24hours later, headlines proclaimed that they were going to get married. WhenBacall rang Sinatra long distance to Miami, he was upset and said: ‘We’ll haveto lay low for a while, not see each other.’ That was the last time Bacall heardfrom him. She was shattered by the public humiliation.Sinatra was making more money than ever before, but a weekly show for BBCtelevision was dropped after 26 weeks because of what was described as Sinatra’s‘arrogance’. Sinatra’s attitude to the shows was casual, his attitude to theother actors patronizing, and his refusal to rehearse insulting to everybodyelse in the show.Sinatra had developed a group of friends who often appeared with him on stage inLas Vegas, consisting of Dean Martin, Peter Lawford, Sammy Davis Jr, Joey Bishopand actress Shirley Maclaine. They were known as the Rat Pack, a name thatLauren Bacall had coined for the group around Humphrey Bogart which had includedSinatra. But when Davis said in an interview in Chicago that, although Sinatracould be the kindest and most generous man in the world, he also ‘does thingsthere are no excuses for’, he was suddenly excommunicated. He had said it inChicago, where Sinatra’s most admired mobsters lived. After two months ofrefusing to talk to Davis, Sinatra finally forgave him.But because of his friendship with the Mob, Sinatra was about to face thebiggest humiliation of his life.Sam Giancana was the Chicago Mob boss who succeeded Tony Accardo when Accardostepped down. Where Accardo had been quiet and retiring, Giancana lovedpublicity and enjoyed displaying his power publicly. His various rackets broughthim in up to $50 million a year. Sinatra worshipped him, and was always eager toperform in Giancana’s nightclubs. He would finish his act by singing ‘My Kind ofTown’, as a tribute to Giancana. Says Kitty Kelley in His Way, ‘Each hadsomething the other wanted. For Frank it was the power derived from associatingwith an underworld capo; for Giancana it was the opportunity to enrich Mafiacoffers by using the biggest entertainer in Hollywood as a draw.’ And she quotessinger Eddie Fisher as saying: ‘Frank wanted to be a hood. He once said “I’drather be a don of the Mafia than president of the United States.”’Giancana often visited the Sands in Las Vegas, but because he was one of elevencriminals who were not allowed in any casino in Nevada, Sinatra had to keep himhidden in his dressing room.Because Peter Lawford, the British film star and long time member of the RatPack, was married to Patricia Kennedy, the sister of the man who would becomepresident, Sinatra agreed to support Kennedy’s campaign. But he thought that hecould do something that would be even more valuable. He went to Sam Giancana andsuggested that if he could do something to help Kennedy win, Kennedy wouldalmost certainly turn down the pressure on the Mafia. Kennedy’s brother Roberthad served on the McClellan Committee senate hearings, whose aim was to exposeMafia involvement with the Teamster’s Union headed by Jimmy Hoffa, which washeavily involved with the Mob. Robert Kennedy had exposed corruption in fifteenunions and fifty corporations. The implication was that if the Mob would helpKennedy into power, his brother would show less hostility to the Mob.Accordingly, Giancana used his Mafia connections to swing the Black Wards inChicago. Kennedy carried the state of Michigan by only 8,858 votes.In fact, Kennedy won the election by the skin of his teeth – a mere 118,000votes out of the 68 million cast.Sinatra believed that after Kennedy became president, he would become anhonorary member of the Kennedy clan.Unfortunately, Sinatra had left out of account the fact that Robert Kennedy hadsworn to break the power of the Mafia. So when Kennedy appointed his brotherAttorney General, Giancana and his friends felt that they had been stabbed inthe back – not only by Kennedy, but by Sinatra.Sinatra had another reason for feeling that Kennedy ‘owed him’. Throughout theiracquaintance Sinatra had kept him supplied with a stream of women, probablyincluding Marilyn Monroe, who had a chalet in the Sinatra-owned club Cal-Neva atLake Tahoe. In His Way, Kitty Kelley quotes a lawyer on Bobby Kennedy’s staff:‘We are out front fighting organized crime on every level, and here thePresident is associating with Sinatra, who is in bed with all these guys.’Robert Kennedy asked the lawyer for a memorandum with all the facts, and threereports on Sinatra were prepared detailing his association with ten leaders oforganized crime in America.The president was due to stay with Sinatra at his Palm Springs home in March1962; Robert Kennedy rang Peter Lawford to ask him to break the news to Sinatrathat Kennedy was cancelling. Sinatra had spent a lot of money preparing his homefor Kennedy’s visit, building extra cottages for the secret service men,installing 25 extra telephone lines, and building a heliport. When Sinatra wastold that the president would be staying with Bing Crosby – a Republicansupporter – instead, Sinatra exploded into a screaming rage, and began todemolish the helipad with a sledgehammer. After that he declared himself aRepublican supporter. But his failure to deliver on his promises of immunitybrought him into considerable disfavour with the Mob.The evidence now seems to suggest that it was the Mob that was responsible forKennedy’s assassination in Dealey Plaza, in Dallas, on 22 November 1963. Amateurfilm footage of the shooting taken by a man named Abraham Zapruder showsKennedy’s head jerking violently backwards as the bullets hit him, although LeeHarvey Oswald, the man believed to be the assassin, was actually behind Kennedyon the sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository. On the other hand, an assassinhidden on the grassy knoll, which Kennedy’s car was approaching at the time ofthe shots, would have been in the ideal position to hit him. A young soldiernamed Gordon Arnold was watching the president’s motorcade from the top of thegrassy knoll when a bullet whizzed past his ear; it came from behind a fence onthe knoll, where a man claiming to be a secret service agent had forbiddenArnold to go a few minutes earlier. As Arnold dropped flat, another shot soundedfrom behind him.The man who organized the assassination was almost certainly Sam Giancana.It was only revealed later that Sinatra had been Kennedy’s pimp, and that SamGiancana and the president had actually shared one mistress – Judith Campbell(who would later write a book about her affair under the name Judith CampbellExner).In fact, before the assassination of Kennedy, Robert Kennedy had already orderedthat Giancana should be closely shadowed by the FBI. Even on the golf course,Giancana was followed by federal agents. He finally became so angry at this lackof privacy that he actually sued the FBI, and won.It was in 1962 that Marilyn Monroe tried to commit suicide at Cal-Neva, and wasrushed to hospital just in time, to have her stomach pumped. (She would die afew days later from another overdose – a reason for suspecting that the storiesthat she was murdered may lack substance.)Giancana spent a great deal of time at Cal-Neva, in spite of the fact that hewas a mobster. And Sinatra himself was behaving more and more like a mobster. Acocktail waitress called Toni, who had been Sinatra’s mistress, married DeputySheriff Richard E. Anderson in March 1962. On 30 June 1962, Anderson came lateto pick up his wife, and was standing in the Cal-Neva kitchen talking to thedishwashers when Sinatra came in and asked him what he was doing there. A fightdeveloped, and Anderson punched Sinatra so hard that Sinatra was unable to singfor the rest of that week.Two weeks later, on 17 July 1962, Anderson and his wife were on their way to theCrystal Bay Club for dinner, driving along Highway 28, not far from Cal-Neva,when a maroon convertible drove towards them at top speed. Anderson’s car wentoff the road and hit a tree, killing him immediately. Toni suffered multiplefractures. The maroon car did not stop, and the sheriff investigating theaccident could not determine what had happened.Recounting the story in His Way, Kitty Kelley leaves little doubt that shethinks Sinatra was behind the death of Anderson.The FBI reported Giancana’s presence at Cal-Neva to the Nevada Gaming ControlBoard. When Ed Olsen, head of the Control Board, rang Sinatra to ask aboutGiancana, Sinatra asked him to dinner. Olsen refused, and suggested meeting inhis office. Sinatra was soon screaming down the phone ‘Don’t you fuck with me.’Olsen decided to issue a complaint, accusing Sinatra of violating Nevada’sgambling laws, and trying to intimidate the chairman himself, as well asoffering bribes to agents who had been in Cal-Neva in the course of duty.When Sinatra failed to answer these charges within fifteen days, as thecomplaint specified, the board revoked his gaming licence.Giancana was so angry with Sinatra’s behaviour that he broke off his friendship.‘That bastard and his big mouth. All he had to do was keep quiet, let theattorneys handle it . . . but no, Frank has to get on the phone with that damnbig mouth of his and now we’ve lost the whole damn place.’When Sammy Davis happened to see Olsen he took him aside to say: ‘That littleson of a bitch, he’s needed this for years. I’ve been working with him forsixteen years and nobody’s ever had the guts to stand up to him!’In May 1964, when Sinatra was filming in Hawaii, his life very nearly endedprematurely. On the afternoon of Sunday 10 May 1964, he was on the beach withseveral friends he had invited, including a powerfully built actor named BradDexter. Sinatra went into the sea with Ruth Coch, the wife of his executiveproducer. They were both dragged further out by a riptide, and Dexter was in thehouse collecting drinks when someone shouted that Sinatra was drowning. WhenDexter swam out to them Sinatra gasped ‘I’m going to die – I’m finished. It’sall over.’ And although Dexter shouted at him that nobody was going to die,Sinatra seemed to have given up. Finally, lifeguards reached them withsurfboards, and got them back to land.Sinatra’s reward was to draw Dexter closely into his private circle of friends.But Dexter was shocked by the way that Sinatra could explode. Sinatra had ablack valet called George Jacobs, and Sinatra treated him as if he was a blackslave. When, after inviting Dexter to dinner, Sinatra lost his temper about thespaghetti and threw it in George Jacobs’ face, Dexter said: ‘That was a veryunkind thing to do.’ George Jacobs calmly wiped the spaghetti off his face, andwent back to the kitchen.In due course, both George Jacobs and Brad Dexter would be victims of Sinatra’sparanoia.When the young actress Mia Farrow determined to marry Frank Sinatra, she wasunaware of what she was taking on. In 1965, at the age of nineteen, she wasselected to play Alison in the television serial Peyton Place, which was beingfilmed in Hollywood. She had a taste for older men – such as Yul Brynner andKirk Douglas – and instantly fell for Sinatra when she saw him on the set of VonRyan’s Express. She was wearing a transparent gown, and had undoubtedly decidedto make a play for Sinatra. When she saw him about to leave for Palm Springs ina jet plane which only had room for three, she asked why she hadn’t beeninvited, and Sinatra lost no time in issuing an invitation. That is how theiraffair began.Typically, it was only after Dexter had told Sinatra that he did not approve ofthe marriage because the thirty-year age gap was too great, that Sinatra beganthrowing things, then grabbed the telephone and told one of his lieutenants inLas Vegas to get a marriage certificate. Dexter said later: ‘Mia’s doom wassealed.’ The two were married in Las Vegas on 19 July 1966.As with Ava Gardner, conflicts soon developed because Sinatra did not want Miato work. When producer David Susskind reluctantly gave her the part of the mutein Johnny Belinda, Sinatra had him threatened by the Mob, and a friendlygangster warned Susskind not to go to either Las Vegas or Miami. Susskind laterdescribed Sinatra as ‘an ill-bred swine who operates on the level of an animal.’When the executive vice-president of the Sands, Carl Cohn, stood up to Sinatraone night and retaliated against his violence by hitting him in the face,splitting Sinatra’s upper lip and knocking the caps off two of his teeth, peoplein Las Vegas suggested that Cohn should be elected mayor.Kitty Kelley has an amusing paragraph contrasting Sinatra and Mia Farrow: ‘Hedrank Jack Daniel’s; she smoked marijuana. He got drunk; she got stoned. He gaveher diamonds; she wore wooden love beads . . .’In the autumn of 1967, Sinatra was about to begin a film called The Detectiveand wanted Mia to star in it. He wanted her to begin work immediately. She saidshe couldn’t, because she was working on Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby. And when heordered her to walk off the set and come and join him, she flatly refused.Like a spoilt child, Sinatra would not be thwarted. He called his lawyer MickeyRudin and told him to draw up divorce papers. These were presented to Mia Farrowas she was about to begin shooting a scene in Rosemary’s Baby. She wasunderstandably shattered, as Sinatra had intended her to be – when he gaveorders, everybody had to jump.The night before the decree was granted, Mia Farrow was in a nightclub calledthe Daisy when Sinatra’s valet, George Jacobs, walked in with his date. Miadanced with him a couple of times, and there was an item about it in anewspaper. The result was that when George Jacobs returned to Palm Springs,Sinatra refused to speak to him, and told Mickey Rudin that he was to be fired.Brad Dexter, the actor who had saved Sinatra from drowning, was dropped in thesame abrupt way when he made some objection to Sinatra’s desire for change in afilm Dexter was directing. Later, when somebody mentioned Dexter to him, Sinatrasaid ‘Who’s that?’When Lyndon Johnson announced in 1968 that he would not seek a further term aspresident, the democratic senator Hubert Humphrey announced his candidacy. Sodid Senator Robert Kennedy, the enemy of the Mafia. Sinatra lost no time indeclaring himself for Humphrey – he was still determined to try and get a footin the door of the White House.But most of Sinatra’s show business friends – like Shirley MacLaine and SammyDavis – were supporting Robert Kennedy. And yet again, the question of Sinatra’sMob connections came up when a number of Humphrey’s friends pointed out to himthat Sinatra had been known as a friend of Lucky Luciano, Sam Giancana (who hadbeen shot to death in 1967), and other mobsters. When a story about Sinatra’sMob connections appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Sinatra was enraged, andcancelled his appearance at the Democratic Convention lunch.Sinatra’s support made no difference anyway; Humphrey lost the presidentialelection to Richard Nixon.The publication of Mario Puzo’s novel, The Godfather, in 1969 raised the wholequestion of Sinatra’s Mafia connections again. The singer Johnny Fontane, whosecareer is almost floundering when the godfather intervenes to make sure he getsa part in a Hollywood movie, is fairly obviously based on Sinatra. Sinatra sawPuzo in a Hollywood restaurant, and screamed abuse at him.When the New Jersey State Commission on Crime summoned Sinatra to testify aboutthe Mafia, Sinatra sued, claiming that the Commission was unconstitutional. Helost the case and appealed to the US Supreme Court, who also turned down hiscase. But when Sinatra eventually testified in front of the Commission – atmidnight (to avoid reporters) on 17 February 1970, he lied as usual about hisconnections, claiming that he had no knowledge of Sam Giancana’s reputation as amember of Cosa Nostra (the Mafia) or of Lucky Luciano’s.When Governor Ronald Reagan of California announced in 1970 that he was apresidential candidate, Sinatra once again outraged his friends by deciding tosupport him, and TV host Steve Allen wrote Sinatra a letter accusing him ofsupporting Reagan as a way of getting revenge on the Kennedy family. Sinatra didnot reply.In 1971, Sinatra announced that he intended to retire from show business andtake a long rest. His films were getting poor reviews, and his records sellingbadly.To everyone’s amazement, Sinatra decided to support Nixon for re-election in1972. Sinatra had also been for some time a friend of Vice President Spiro Agnewand when Nixon was re-elected, Sinatra at last had his wish to get his foot inthe door of the White House.Things soon went wrong for Agnew when he was accused of taking bribes and wasforced to resign in order to avoid criminal prosecution. But Sinatra stood byhis friend, lending him $200,000 to pay back taxes.In 1973, Sinatra decided he’d had enough of retirement, and announced hisre-entry into show business. But a big television special failed to attract alarge audience. His public performances were still full of the old Sinatrapersonality, and his ability to mesmerize an audience, but he was also showing atendency to paranoia in his addresses to the audience, with violent attacks onjournalists – particularly female journalists, about whom he said many crude anddownright nauseating things.When the German press attacked Sinatra for his gangland connections, Sinatracancelled his tour of Germany. In England he was better received, but PrinceCharles said he was distressed by the ‘creeps’ (Sinatra’s bodyguards) and ‘Mafiatypes’. And Prince Charles also noted that Sinatra could be ‘very nice oneminute and . . . well, not so nice the next.’In Australia, Sinatra found himself immensely unpopular with his attacks on thepress. And went on to talk about female journalists as ‘hookers’.The next day, the leader of the Labour Party in New South Wales asked whoSinatra thought he was, and a Member of Parliament made some unkind referencesto Sinatra’s ‘goons’. And when the Stagehands Union refused to work, Sinatra’stour came to an abrupt end. The Waiter’s Union refused to serve him, so he couldno longer get room service at his hotel. Airport workers refused to refuel hisplane until he apologized. Sinatra’s lawyer Mickey Rudin had to step in andnegotiate with the unions about a public statement that would satisfy everybody.In America, newspapers observed with satisfaction Sinatra’s humiliation.Back in America, Sinatra displayed the same paranoia about journalists wheneverhe stopped singing to talk to an audience, and in Toronto, he even made thecritics pay for their own tickets.By this time, he was married again – to Barbara Marx, ex-wife of Zeppo Marx, whowas a former model. Her boss at the time said: ‘Barbara is not very intelligent,but she’s beautiful, she’s sweet, and she’s incredibly patient.’ These wereobviously qualities that Sinatra needed in a wife. She put up with his insults,and even his violence – in the South of France he slapped her so hard that shecould not come out of the hotel room for two days.In 1976, Sinatra was back in trouble again for his relationship with the Mob. InTarrytown, New York, the Mafia built the Westchester Premier Theater, but it wasbankrupt within a year as a consequence of the Mafia habit of taking money fromthe till. Federal agents taped a phone conversation that revealed theinvolvement of the New York Gambino crime family in the theatre, and the resultwas an investigation. One of the exhibits that came up at the trial was aphotograph of Frank Sinatra posing with a number of mobsters, including CarloGambino, Jimmy Fratianno and Paul Castellano.Fratianno co-operated with the prosecution when he learned there was a Mafiacontract on his life, and described how he had gone to see Sinatra in PalmSprings and told him that his crime family needed a favour – some benefitperformances by Sinatra at the Premier Theater. Sinatra agreed to fourperformances and Fratianno told him, ‘If ever there’s anything we can do foryou, just say the word.’Fratianno then claimed that Sinatra’s secretary had telephoned to say thatSinatra wanted one of his former bodyguards murdered because the bodyguard hadwritten articles in the National Inquirer, and there were rumours that he waswriting a book about Sinatra.This plan apparently fell through because no one quite knew where to find theex-bodyguard. But the incident offers an insight into the kind of ‘favours’Sinatra expected from the Mob.During a three-year hearing, Sinatra’s name was frequently mentioned inconnection with gangsters, and Sinatra responded, as he had throughout his life,by stepping up his charitable activities.Reagan had lost in his first bid for the White House, but in 1980 he campaignedagain, and again, Sinatra supported him. This time, Reagan won, and becamepresident in January 1981. Sinatra, naturally, became a favoured visitor of theWhite House.Kitty Kelley’s unauthorized and frank biography of Frank Sinatra, His Way,caused the predictable explosion of rage, but the book became one of thebestselling biographies of all time, and Sinatra was finally presented to theAmerican public as he really was, and not simply as he wanted to appear. He inturn accused her of using items from newspapers and magazines without checkingher facts. But undoubtedly, the basic facts she gives about Sinatra’s foultemper and violent behaviour are accurate.After the appearance of Kitty Kelley’s book, Sinatra had ten more years to live.He retired to his magnificent home in Beverly Hills, surrounded by his wife andchildren – Tina, Nancy and Frank Jr. His career as a performer was now over, hisvoice little more than a croak, but the rewards and tributes continued to pourin.When Congress proposed to bestow its gold medal on Sinatra in January 1997,Kitty Kelley wrote a number of articles denouncing the nomination.By 1996, it was clear that Sinatra’s health was failing, and when he washospitalized in November, there were rumours that he was being treated forpneumonia and heart problems. In January 1997, he was in hospital again, thistime for a minor heart attack.He finally died of a heart attack on 14 May 1998, at the Cedars-Sinai Hospitalin Los Angeles."},{"pageContent":"THORPE, JEREMYTHE LIBERAL LEADER AND THE MALE MODELTHE TRIAL OF Jeremy Thorpe, leader of the British Liberal Party, on a charge ofconspiracy to murder was the greatest political scandal in England since theProfumo case (see here) [index_split_027.html#filepos742273]. The charge wasthat Thorpe had incited three men – who stood beside him in the dock – to murderthe former male model Norman Scott, with whom Thorpe was alleged to have had ahomosexual affair.Until the Scott case, the career of John Jeremy Thorpe, born on 29 April 1929,had been an unbroken success story. The son of a Conservative Member ofParliament, he was educated at a private school in Connecticut (during World WarII), then at Eton College and Oxford University. He was obviously a man ofdriving ambition and became President of the University Liberal Club, then theLaw Society, and finally – the most coveted post of all – of the Oxford Union,the debating society whose presidents have often become distinguishedpoliticians. He was called to the bar in 1954 and contested the North Devonconstituency as a Liberal in the following year. His flair for politics wasobviously great, and he conducted his campaign ‘with all the panache of anAmerican congressional campaign’, in the words of his biographers (LewisChester, Magnus Linklater and David May, in their book Jeremy Thorpe, A SecretLife). The same biographers quote various Oxford contemporaries of Thorpe to theeffect that he could be too ruthless in achieving his aims and was capable of‘cutting corners’. This first political campaign ended in failure, but he cutthe Tory majority in half. When he contested the seat again in 1959, he won by362 votes. He made an immediate impact on the House of Commons with his wit andoratory. There was only one small cloud on the horizon: in March 1960, a routinesecurity check into his background concluded that he was believed to havehomosexual tendencies – at that time, homosexual activity was a criminaloffence. It was also in 1960, on a visit to a riding stable in Oxfordshire, thatThorpe made the acquaintance of the man who was to be his political downfall,Norman Josiffe, later to be known as Norman Scott.Josiffe, eleven years Thorpe’s junior, was the child of a broken marriage andwas emotionally unstable. The most important thing in his life was his pony. Atthe age of sixteen he was found guilty of larceny and placed on probation. Inthe following year he became a riding instructor. By this time he was havingsevere emotional problems: he was subject to crying fits and was in the habit ofinventing tragic stories about his background to arouse pity. A doctorprescribed tranquillizers and he was admitted to a clinic. In 1961 he took anoverdose of Largactil and had to be rushed to hospital. It was when he came outthat he recalled Jeremy Thorpe’s remark that if ever he was in difficulties, heshould feel free to look him up at the House of Commons. Josiffe went there on 8November 1961, and had an interview with Thorpe. Afterwards, they went down toOxted, in Surrey, where Thorpe’s mother had a house. According to Josiffe, theirhomosexual affair began that night.Josiffe alleged that on the way to Oxted, Thorpe asked if he would mind beingintroduced as a member of a television camera crew, with whom he would betravelling abroad the next day. At Mrs Thorpe’s house, Josiffe signed thevisitor’s book with a false name. That night, when Josiffe was in bed, Thorpevisited him with a book by James Baldwin, the homosexual novel Giovanni’s Room.Later, he returned to Josiffe’s room in a dressing gown and pyjamas, and sat onthe bed. ‘He said I looked like a frightened rabbit . . . he just hugged me andcalled me “poor bunny” . . . he got into bed with me.’ Thorpe went out to getsome Vaseline which he put on his penis. Then he put a towel on the bed and madelove to Josiffe, with Josiffe as the passive partner. According to Josiffe, whenThorpe left, ‘I just lay there with my dog . . . crying.’ But although Josiffedeclared that he did not enjoy being sodomized, (‘I just bit the pillow andtried not to scream’), the affair continued apace. Josiffe was given a job onthe staff of Len Smith, a Liberal Party official, and moved into a small serviceflat near the House of Commons where, according to him, Thorpe went to make loveto him. They went down to Mrs Thorpe’s house four or five times. They would meetin the Reform Club and go to a Chelsea restaurant for dinner. Josiffe went downto Devon with Thorpe at Christmas and while their hosts were walking in thegarden, Thorpe made love to Josiffe in the bathroom.Problems began to arise. A Mrs Ann Gray accused Josiffe of stealing her suedecoat and when the police wanted to question him, Thorpe insisted on theinterview taking place in his office in the House of Commons, explaining that hewas ‘more or less’ Josiffe’s guardian since Josiffe had lost both parents. Soonafter, Josiffe moved to a position with a farming family in Somerset, and Thorpewrote him a letter in which he told him that he could ‘take the Ann Grayincident as over and done with’. The letter concluded: ‘Bunnies can (and will)go to France.’ There was a postscript: ‘I miss you.’But when Thorpe began to look into the matter of Josiffe’s ‘lost’ parents anddiscovered that they were both alive and well, the relationship began to cool –at least, on his side. There was the additional problem that the farming familyfound Josiffe too nervous and highly strung. Josiffe moved to the home of a DrKeith Lister and when the doctor wrote Thorpe a letter enquiring about the youngman’s background, he was told rather brusquely that he should consult Josiffe’sparents, whose addresses were enclosed. But Thorpe continued to help Josiffe andsorted out a problem about his national insurance card.Unfortunately, as Thorpe seems to have found himself losing patience with the‘bunny’, Josiffe decided he was in love with Thorpe. When Josiffe’s dog Tishkilled Dr Lister’s ducks, Josiffe was asked to leave. He tried confessing his‘sins’ to a Catholic priest but was refused absolution unless he broke off hisassociation with Thorpe. Josiffe felt himself torn in several directions at onceand began to feel increasingly bitter. One day, in a fit of wild self-pity, hebegan talking to a young lady about his plan to kill Thorpe and commit suicide.The result was that Josiffe was interviewed at the Chelsea police station inDecember 1962, and began a statement: ‘I have come to the police to tell youabout my homosexual relations with Jeremy Thorpe . . .’ The police took the‘Bunnies will go to France’ letter and another, and these ended up in the fileof the Assistant Commissioner of Police. The police made no attempt to follow upthe allegations about the homosexual affair. Josiffe soon went to Ireland totake another job involving horses. When a West End outfitter, Gieves Ltd, wroteto Thorpe asking payment for a pair of silk pyjamas that Josiffe had ordered onhis account, Thorpe refused to pay, and said he had no idea of Josiffe’s presentwhereabouts. It was obviously his fervent wish never to hear from Josiffe again.It was not to be. In 1964, Josiffe contacted Thorpe to ask for his help ingetting a job on the Continent. Thorpe advanced him the money to go toSwitzerland. Josiffe went there, disliked the job, and returned promptly withouthis luggage. With exemplary patience, Thorpe offered to help him retrieve theluggage. By now, Josiffe had upgraded himself; he called himself the HonourableLianche-Josiffe and declared that his father, who had died tragically, was apeer of the realm. He also claimed that his wife had died in a car crash. Hewent back to Ireland, ran into more employment problems and finally wrote JeremyThorpe’s mother a letter telling her in some detail about his homosexual affairwith her son, and alleging that he felt himself shamefully mistreated. MrsThorpe passed the letter on to her son.Thorpe was worried and his reaction was to confide in a fellow Liberal MP, PeterBessell, the Member for Bodmin. Bessell’s political career had been, in someways, as meteoric as Thorpe’s own, and Thorpe had helped him in the crucialcampaign. Bessell listened sympathetically and then flew off to Dublin, carryinga legal letter threatening Josiffe with a libel suit. He met Josiffe and foundhim, on the whole, likeable. Bessell told him firmly that he could not believethat there had been a homosexual relationship with Jeremy Thorpe and asked if hehad any proof. Josiffe replied that he did – that there were letters from Thorpein the luggage that was still in Switzerland. Bessell promised to help himretrieve this. Bessell’s secretary finally located the luggage and sent it on toDublin. When it arrived, Josiffe telephoned Bessell to report that the lettersfrom Jeremy Thorpe were missing . . . Bessell was less concerned than he mighthave been; he was on the verge of bankruptcy and all his efforts were directedat borrowing $15,000 or so. Eventually, with some help from Jeremy Thorpe, hesucceeded.In 1966, the Labour Party won the election, dashing the hopes of the Liberalleader, Jo Grimond, for a pact with the Labour Party. Grimond decided to resign.To many Liberals, Jeremy Thorpe was the obvious choice as a replacement. He hadproved himself a brilliant fundraiser and had become party treasurer. There weremany who felt he was too lightweight, that for all his charm and eloquence, helacked the qualities of a future Prime Minister. And, regrettably, there werealso rumours about his sexuality – largely the result of Bessell’s inclinationto gossip. A ‘Stop Jeremy’ movement was formed among Liberals. But it made nodifference and Thorpe was elected leader of the party in January 1967 by aunanimous vote of the executive. He was 37.Meanwhile, Josiffe had changed his name to Norman Scott and had found work as amale model. Three months after Thorpe became leader, Josiffe-Scott wrote toPeter Bessell explaining that he wanted to go to America but had burned hispassport during the ‘upset’ over Jeremy – could Bessell help? Josiffe alsolacked insurance cards, which meant he could not apply for unemployment benefit.In August 1967, Josiffe came to London and Bessell arranged to pay him a‘retainer’ of between £5 and £10 a week until he could either find a job orobtain another passport. There was, of course, no reason why Josiffe should notapply for a new passport and insurance card. But he had come to the conclusionthat Jeremy Thorpe should have put insurance stamps on his old card and this wasthe basis of yet another grudge.Bessell was not sure that it would be a good idea for Josiffe to go to America.Although homosexuality had ceased to be a criminal offence in England in July1967, there was still a stigma attached to it. If Josiffe accused Thorpe ofbeing a homosexual in England, Thorpe could sue him for libel, and since Josiffenow had no proof that he had known Thorpe, Thorpe would undoubtedly win. InAmerica, Josiffe could say anything he liked, and the results could beembarrassing for everyone, including Bessell, who had business interests there.And as far as Thorpe was concerned, this was certainly no time for a scandal.Many Liberals were dissatisfied with him; his style of oratory had become dulland pompous, and some fellow party workers felt he was too dictatorial.In May 1968, Jeremy Thorpe married 29-year-old Caroline Allpass, whom he had metthrough a friend named David Holmes, a businessman who became his honorarydeputy. While he was on honeymoon, there was an attempt to unseat him as Liberalleader and he had to rush back to London. All this aroused sympathy for him andthe threat temporarily receded. But Scott remained a menace in the background.And sometime in the autumn of 1968, according to the prosecution case, Thorpebegan to consider seriously the idea of killing Scott. In December, he andBessell had a discussion in the House of Commons just before the division bellrang. When Bessell said it seemed to be impossible to find Scott a job inAmerica, Thorpe replied, ‘In that case we have got to get rid of him.’ Bessellasked, ‘Are you suggesting killing him off?’ and Thorpe answered, ‘Yes.’In May 1969, Thorpe had a temporary respite from his worries about Scott whenthe latter married. But his relief was short-lived. Scott and his wife had movedto a Dorset cottage and she was pregnant. Soon cash was short and although anemergency insurance card was issued, so that the expectant mother could claimmaternity benefit, Scott became increasingly angry and hysterical. He rangJeremy Thorpe’s house in Devon, and found himself speaking to Caroline Thorpe.He poured out his story to Caroline who was understandably shocked. Scott alsorang Bessell, threatening to give his story to a Sunday newspaper; Bessell didhis best to soothe him. Eventually, Scott’s marriage came to an end when heconfessed to his wife that, during her absence, he had been sleeping with aformer boyfriend. Once again, Thorpe was in the firing line.Matters began to come to a head when Scott’s wife sued him for divorce in theautumn of 1970. Both Bessell and Thorpe knew what that could mean. Anything aman says in a court of law is ‘privileged’ – he cannot be sued for libel. Bothknew Scott well enough to believe that he would seize his opportunity todenounce Thorpe. But denounce him for what? For having ‘seduced’ him in 1961?But a seduction involves two people and besides, Scott had since become apractising homosexual. Scott was, in fact, trumping up a number of absurd andhysterical charges against Thorpe. Thorpe’s increasing irritation anddesperation were justified. These were undoubtedly increased by the personaltragedy that took place soon after the summer election of 1970 (which Labourlost to the Conservatives). On 29 June, Caroline Thorpe set out to drive toLondon from Devon. Near Basingstoke her car struck an oncoming lorry and she wasdead by the time she reached hospital. Later gossip asserted that Scott had goneto Thorpe’s house the previous day and told her the full story of the homosexualaffair, and that this was preying on her mind. Scott flatly denied this story.But it does seem likely that Thorpe’s problems with Scott were preoccupying hermind on that last journey.The next time Scott put on the pressure, he received an irritable rejection.With Bessell’s help, Scott had moved to Talybont, in Wales. He decided to starta horse-training school and asked Bessell to help him with money. But Bessellhad serious troubles of his own; his own money worries were enormous and he wasstruggling to avoid bankruptcy. He finally announced that he was unable to helphim. Scott persuaded a new friend in the village to write to Thorpe, explainingthat Scott’s financial situation was now critical. A reply came from Thorpe’spersonal assistant that he did not know a Mr Scott but that if he was the sameperson as Mr Josiffe, then Mr Thorpe was under no obligation to him.Scott now persuded another gullible acquaintance, a Mrs Gwen Parry-Jones, towrite to a local Liberal MP, Emlyn Hooson, to say that a certain well-knownLiberal had shamefully wronged a young man of her acquaintance. Hooson thoughtthat the MP referred to was Peter Bessell. A meeting was arranged between Scottand Liberal MP David Steel who was shaken to learn that the accused man wasJeremy Thorpe. Hooson’s reaction, when he was told, was ‘Thorpe must go’. Butwhen Thorpe learned about this, he protested angrily. Scott, he said, was anunbalanced young man whom he had helped in earlier days and who had concoctedthis whole absurd fantasy. Four Liberal MPs now interviewed Scott; one of themopenly accused him of blackmail. Scott walked out indignantly. He began tellinghis story to the press: ‘I was deeply in love with Jeremy. I thought our idyllicfriendship would last forever. But he discarded me. That’s why I loathe himnow.’ (Hooson was to say, ‘I formed the strong impression that Norman Scott hada definite fixation about Jeremy Thorpe, somewhat in the manner of a jiltedgirl . . .’) But the newspapers declined to touch it.In March 1973, Thorpe married the former concert pianist Marion Harewood. Atabout this time, Scott attempted suicide by slashing his wrists. In the autumnof that year, he met Thorpe’s Tory opponent Tim Keigwin and told him the long,sad story. Clearly, he had no intention of fading into the background. And when,in the following year, Edward Heath called his emergency election in an attemptto break the miners’ strike, Thorpe began to feel that Scott was a tickingtime-bomb that would blow up the Liberal Party. Scott no longer had Thorpe’s ownletters but he had all the letters from Peter Bessell, which constituted strongevidence for his claims – after all, why should Bessell have paid him severalhundreds of pounds unless there was a guilty secret somewhere? It was certainlynot Bessell’s guilty secret – Bessell’s own extra-marital affairs were strictlyheterosexual. The result was that Thorpe’s friend David Holmes paid Scott £2,500for the ‘Bessell file’. Thorpe was re-elected with an increased majority. Butthe election was otherwise a tie, in which the Tories lost their majority. For awhile it looked as though Heath would propose a Liberal-Tory pact and Thorpewould at last attain some real political power. It was not to be, but the longdiscussions at 10 Downing Street were an indication of Thorpe’s crucialpolitical importance.Meanwhile Scott had spent most of the £2,500. He was living in squalor in acottage on the edge of Exmoor, taking various drugs and drinking heavily. He wasnow convinced that his life was in danger and that he had been a fool to partwith the Bessell file. He even started to institute proceedings to recover itfrom the well-meaning doctor who had acted as intermediary with David Holmes.(In fact, Holmes had burned Bessell’s letters.) Odd incidents terrified Scott.He alleged that a helicopter landed near his remote cottage and two men came andknocked on his door and that he stayed quiet until they went away. A man whoclaimed to be a foreign journalist, interested in his story, arranged anappointment in a hotel lounge in Barnstaple. Scott went along with his briefcaseand was called to the telephone by the journalist, who said that he had tocancel the appointment because Mrs Margaret Thatcher had been appointed head ofthe Conservative Party and he had to rush to London. When Scott had finished thetelephone conversation, he found his briefcase was missing. A week later he wasbeaten up by two assailants as he came out of a pub in Barnstaple. Then a manwho called himself Peter Keene came to see him and told him he was in greatdanger because a hired killer was on his way from Canada to assassinate him.Scott was too nervous to go with Keene to meet the unknown benefactor who,according to Keene, was trying to protect him. However, he agreed to meet him inthe centre of Combe Martin on 24 October 1975. Scott decided to take his GreatDane along.‘Keene’ was a junior pilot officer with British Airways called Andrew Newton.They met at a hotel, as arranged, and Newton persuaded Scott to drive with himto Porlock, where he had business. They could discuss the ‘assassin’ on the way.Newton left him in Porlock for an hour, then collected him with apologies forbeing late. Scott was now beginning to feel at ease with ‘Keene’. Newton seemedto be driving very badly and explained that he was tired. Scott offered todrive. On the edge of the moor, Newton stopped the car, Scott got out and ranthrough heavy rain to the driver’s side of the car. As he arrived there, hefound the door open and Newton standing outside the car. The Great Dane, Rinka,was barking excitedly. ‘This is it,’ said Newton, producing a Mauser pistol. Heshot the dog through the head, then placed the gun against Scott’s head, saying,‘It’s your turn now.’ Scott froze, terrified. But the gun seemed to have jammed;Newton was swearing loudly. Scott began to run over the moor, then decided itwas useless to run away and went back to his dog. Newton pointed the gun at himagain and said, ‘Fuck it.’ He jumped into his car and drove away. Soon after,another car drove up and Scott flagged it down. Its occupants included an AAscout who contacted the police for Scott.Newton was easily traced: a suspicious landlady had noted the number of his carthe first time he came to see Scott and it proved to have been hired from a firmin Blackpool. Newton was arrested and told the police that Scott had been tryingto blackmail him, and that he had shot the dog to ‘scare him off’. In duecourse, Newton was sentenced to two years in prison – he served slightly morethan a year.In January 1976, Norman Scott was charged with defrauding the Department ofHealth and Social Security of £58.40. On 29 January, he finally did what he hadbeen threatening to do for so many years. In court in Barnstaple, he blurted outthat he was being hounded because he had once had a homosexual relationship withJeremy Thorpe.Now the story was out. Inevitably, Thorpe promptly denied it. He told theLiberal chief whip, Cyril Smith, in confidence, that Scott was a commonblackmailer and that he had been blackmailing Bessell about an affair he washaving with his private secretary. Bessell had been persuaded to write a letterto this effect – it would explain the sums of money he had paid to Scott overthe years. But Bessell had been told that his ‘confession’ would only be used ina case of extreme emergency. When away in America a friend told him on thetelephone that the letter had been leaked to the press; Bessell’s first reactionwas to deny it. Thorpe telephoned him and persuaded him to withhold his denialfor a few days. ‘Peter, I’m begging for time.’But by now the press felt they had an important story. The Prime Minister, SirHarold Wilson, added a new dimension of scandal to it when he proclaimed hisbelief that sinister forces from South Africa were behind the attack on theLiberal leader – Thorpe being an outspoken opponent of apartheid. From Thorpe’spoint of view, this intervention was less than helpful, for it led investigativejournalists to probe deeper than ever into his own background. A ‘Get Rid ofJeremy’ movement began to snowball – one of its supporters was the nowdisillusioned Peter Bessell, who was living in Oceanside, California, where hehad fled from his creditors. Finally, Thorpe had to give way. On 10 May 1976, hesent in his letter of resignation as party leader.For another year, the scandal again became dormant; it began to look as if, inspite of losing his position as party leader (he was succeeded by David Steel),Thorpe was going to survive politically. But in April 1977, Andrew Newton wasreleased from prison. He felt that someone owed him something for his year ofdiscomfort and began trying to sell his own story to the press. On 19 October1977, the scandal exploded again when the London Evening News came out with aheadline: ‘I Was Hired To Kill Scott. Exclusive. Gunman tells of incredible plot– a murder contract for £5,000.’ The newspaper had paid Newton £3,000.A week later, Thorpe gave a press conference in which he read aloud a statementgiving his own version of his relationship with Norman Scott. He admitted askingBessell to act as his intermediary with Scott but insisted that he had noknowledge of the purchase of the ‘Bessell file’ for £2,500. He added: ‘As far asMr Bessell is concerned, it is my considered opinion that if he had credibleevidence to offer, he should have gone to the police rather than the press.’This was virtually a declaration of war on the man who had helped him so much.Matters now came quickly to a head. The Director of Public Prosecutions had todecide whether to prosecute. By now, the newspapers had sniffed out what theycalled ‘The South Wales Connection’ – the allegation that Newton had been hiredto kill Scott by two businessmen from Port Talbot, Wales – John Le Mesurier, whoran a discount carpet firm, and George Deakin, who had made a fortune fromone-armed bandits. On 2 August 1978, warrants were issued for the arrest ofJeremy Thorpe, David Holmes, John Le Mesurier and George Deakin. On 20 November,the four men appeared in court in Minehead, the nearest court to the place whereNorman Scott’s dog had been shot. The magistrate had to decide whether there wasa case to answer. The chief witness was Andrew Newton, with his assertion thathe had been hired to kill Scott. The story that emerged was that in October1974, David Holmes had gone to visit an old friend, John Le Mesurier, in PortTalbot, and was introduced to George Deakin, the ‘one-armed-bandit king’. At thethird or fourth meeting, Holmes mentioned that a friend was having trouble witha blackmailer. Could Deakin find someone to frighten this man? Deakin in turnwent to a friend called David Miller, who ran a printing shop in Cardiff; it wasMiller who recommended his friend Andrew Newton. Newton had at first beenpromised £15,000 to frighten Scott; this was later dropped to £10,000, then to£5,000. When Newton came out of prison in April 1977, he was summoned to alonely moorland road by Miller and Le Mesurier and given his £5,000. A privatedetective hired by Miller roared past in a car and photographed the transaction– Miller was hoping he might sometime sell his story to the press.This, then, was the background to how Newton came to shoot the dog. (Newtoninsisted he had no intention of killing Scott and that he had deliberatelypointed the gun away from him before pulling the trigger a second time.) Themagistrate decided that all this amounted to a conspiracy to murder. The trialof the four men opened at the Old Bailey on 8 May 1979.All four – Thorpe, Holmes, Le Mesurier and Deakin – pleaded not guilty. Thecounsel for the prosecution, Peter Taylor, QC, told Norman Scott’s story, of howhe had been seduced by Thorpe and the gradual breakdown of their relationship.According to Scott, the affair with Thorpe had continued for five years and hehad frequently come back from Ireland to have sex with Thorpe. The turning pointin the relationship came when Scott wrote to Thorpe’s mother, telling her thathe and Jeremy had been lovers for the past five years.The most startling evidence came from Peter Bessell on day four of the trial. Hedescribed acting as intermediary between Thorpe and Norman Scott, then went onto tell of the day in the House of Commons in 1968 when Thorpe had firstsuggested ‘getting rid’ of Scott. They had then discussed various methods ofdisposing of Scott’s body – it could be buried, dropped in a river, concealed inthe rubble of a new motorway. When Bessell mentioned the tin mines in hisCornish constituency, Thorpe took him by the shoulders and exclaimed, ‘That’sit!’ The body could be dropped down an empty mineshaft. Bessell said he thoughtkilling was immoral and Thorpe replied, ‘It’s no worse than shooting a sickdog.’A few months later, according to the prosecution, Bessell and Holmes attendedanother meeting in the House, and this time, Thorpe proposed that Holmes shouldpose as a reporter and invite Scott to Plymouth. On the way he could get himdrunk in a pub, kill him in a lonely spot and dispose of him. Bessell remarkedthat shooting Scott would be noisy and messy. ‘In that case,’ said Thorpe, ‘itwill have to be poison. You can slip it into his drink, David, in a pub.’ Holmessaid it might be awkward if Scott dropped dead off his bar stool. Bessell said,‘You can apologize to the landlord and ask for directions to the nearestmineshaft.’ Thorpe snapped, ‘This is a serious matter.’According to Bessell, they regarded Thorpe’s murder plans as something of ajoke. In any case, they were dropped when Scott got married. But Thorpeanticipated more trouble from Scott, and began to discuss luring him to Americato kill him in some remote place.In 1971, Holmes and Bessell met in New York to discuss a ‘charade’ that wouldconvince Thorpe they meant to kill Scott. Holmes bought a toy pistol that wouldfire plastic pellets a few feet so he could report he had acquired a murderweapon. Holmes telephoned Thorpe from New York to explain that the plan hadfailed because Scott had not turned up.The prosecution told the story of how Andrew Newton had been hired and how hehad asked Deakin privately, ‘I understand you want somebody bumped off?’ Newtonwas apparently not particularly competent and went to Dunstable instead ofBarnstaple. He contacted Holmes, who explained he would be happier if Scottvanished from the face of the earth. Newton described how he tried to lure Scottto the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington and had gone there with a chisel hiddenin a bunch of flowers – he intended to kill Scott with the chisel in a hotelroom. But Scott failed to show up. Finally, Newton described how he hadcontacted Scott under the name of Peter Keene and had taken him for the drivethat ended in the death of the dog. He again insisted that he had only pretendedthat the gun had jammed. It was for this abortive attempt that he was paid£5,000.Where had this money come from? It was part of the prosecution’s case that ithad been syphoned off from Liberal Party funds, supplied by a millionaire namedJack Hayward, who had been a generous benefactor of the Liberals. After the 1974election, Thorpe had written to Hayward, explaining that he needed £50,000 forelection funds, but that it would be best if he could have two cheques, one for£40,000 and one for £10,000. The £40,000 went into the Liberal funds; the£10,000 into an account on Jersey belonging to Thorpe’s friend, and thegodfather of his son, Nadir Dinshaw. Dinshaw sent the money on to David Holmes;in March 1975 the procedure was repeated, and a further £10,000 went to Holmesvia Dinshaw. (The latter was dubious about the proceeding but was reassured byThorpe that it was all perfectly above board.)When the prosecution had finished presenting its case, things looked very blackfor the accused. The evidence that Thorpe had wanted Scott ‘disposed of’ hadbeen precise and circumstantial. But when the defence presented its case, thingsbegan to look better. In the witness box, Peter Bessell agreed that he washoping to make a great deal of money from a contract with a newspaper; if Thorpewas convicted, the total payment would be £50,000; if not, only £25,000. Thedefence’s inference was that Bessell had good reason to want to see aconviction. Bessell was made to admit in court that he had ‘disappeared’ in 1974to escape his creditors. It also emerged that the prelude to this disappearancehad been an unsuccessful plot to swindle Jack Hayward of $(1/2) million. Thorpehad been heavily involved in this scheme according to Bessell. In a brilliantcross-examination, George Carman QC succeeded in conveying a strong impressionthat Bessell was a swindler and a habitual liar.He was equally impressive with Norman Scott. He scored a vital point when hemade Scott admit that he had been boasting about a sexual relationship withJeremy Thorpe before he went to see Thorpe in the House of Commons for the firsttime. Scott admitted that he had been mentally ill at the time and was sufferingfrom a delusion. The implication was obvious: that Scott might have invented thewhole story of his sexual relations with Jeremy Thorpe. And even if he hadn’t,he had gone to the House of Commons with the idea of an affair in his mind – sothe story of being dragged unwillingly into homosexuality by Thorpe must beuntrue. This admission may well have been the turning point of the trial.Scott made a thoroughly bad impression in court – one of a hysterical neuroticwho had persecuted a public man out of malice. The impression made by AndrewNewton was equally bad. He began by admitting that he had lied on oath at hisoriginal trial for shooting the dog. Carman pressed him to admit that he hadbeen hired simply to ‘put the fear of God’ into Scott and not to kill him.Newton disagreed but by the time he had finished giving his evidence, hisgeneral credibility was also badly dented.Of the four accused, George Deakin was the only one who chose to go into thewitness box. He insisted that he had merely helped to find someone to frighten ablackmailer and that he had been totally incurious about who was beingblackmailed. He denied any subsequent involvement in intimidating Scott – he hadbeen named as the man who had gone to Barnstaple to steal Scott’s briefcase.The prosecution and defence took five days to summarize their cases. Thorpe’scounsel emphasized that the fact he had chosen not to go into the witness boxdid not prove him guilty. He had a perfect right to remain silent. The summingup by Mr Justice Cantley was, on the whole, in favour of the accused. He wasscathing about the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and he alsoemphasized that the refusal of Thorpe, Holmes and Le Mesurier to go into thewitness box should not be regarded as evidence of guilt. When he spoke ofBessell the judge further emphasized that his evidence about Thorpe’s ‘ultimatesolution’ to the problem of Scott was uncorroborated. When he spoke of Scott, heobviously found it impossible to hide his distaste. He spoke of his ‘hysterical,warped personality’, and described him as an accomplished liar and a crook. Hepointed out that the ‘Bunnies can go to France’ letter might be seen as evidenceof a homosexual relationship or it might not. It was possible that when Scottfirst went to see Thorpe at the House of Commons, he had blackmail in mind. ‘Heis a fraud. He is a sponger. He is a whiner. He is a parasite. But of course, hecould still be telling the truth. It is all a question of belief.’When the jury retired, they were divided six to six for and against acquittal.An hour later, they were two to ten in favour of acquittal. By the followingday, only one man held out for a guilty verdict. Finally, after two days, thatone man was convinced. On Friday 22 June 1979, the four accused filed back intothe dock. The foreman read out the verdicts of acquittals for all the four.Thorpe looked rigid and stunned. Then he tossed the three cushions he had beensitting on over the side of the dock and leaned forward to embrace his wife.The authors of Jeremy Thorpe, A Secret Life, add one curious footnote to thecase. The turning point had probably been Scott’s admission that he had boastedabout a sexual relation with Thorpe even before he went to the House of Commons.The authors traced Scott’s psychiatrist and asked about this. The psychiatrist,Dr Anthony Willems, assured them that this was not true; Scott had discussed hissexual fantasies very fully during his treatment, in the days before he went tomeet Thorpe in the House. But Thorpe’s name had never been mentioned. So Scotthad, in effect, unnecessarily undermined his own case – another example, as theauthors point out, of his being his own worst enemy."},{"pageContent":"VOIGT, WILHELM‘THE CAPTAIN OF KOPENICK’THE STORY OF the bogus ‘Captain of Kopenick’ made all Kaiser Wilhelm’s Germanyrock with laughter. On the morning of 17 October 1906, a troop of ten soldiers,headed by a sergeant, was marching through Tegel (now in West Berlin). Suddenly,a man in a captain’s uniform stepped in front of them and roared, ‘Halt!’ Thecaptain was a plump man with a drooping moustache, in his late 50s. He inspectedthe squad, then ordered the sergeant to accompany him to Kopenick, a dozen or somiles away, where he had official business at the town hall. Being Prussians,they obeyed without question. When they arrived at Kopenick, the captain gavethem a mark each and told them to fall out for the midday meal. After theirmeal, he lined them up outside the town hall and set guards at the doors,ordering them to keep callers from entering. Then he marched the remaining sevenmen into the building, set some of them as guards on stairs and in corridors,and marched into the mayor’s office. The captain informed the mayor that he wasunder arrest. Then he demanded to be shown the cash box with the municipalfunds. It contained 4,000 marks which he confiscated, after carefully countingthem.The captain ordered his men to lead the prisoner away, while a soldier was toldto requisition three vehicles. Into the first two of these, the soldiers and themayor were ordered; their destination was a police station some fifteen milesaway. The captain and the cash box entered the other cab. It was this cab thatfailed to arrive at the police station. It took more than two hours of confusionand mutual recriminations before it dawned on the police and the mayor that theywere victims of a hoax.The ‘captain’ was an old lag named Wilhelm Voigt, who had spent 27 of his 57years in jail. He had walked into a pawn shop, shortly after his release fromhis latest spell in prison, and purchased the second-hand captain’s uniform. Itis not clear whether the robbery was planned, or whether it was a spur of themoment decision as he saw the soldiers marching through Tegel.The news of the comic-opera robbery spread round the world. Even the kaiser issaid to have roared with laughter when he heard about it and said, ‘Such a thingcould only happen in Germany.’ From the description, it didn’t take the policelong to identify the captain as Voigt. While all the Berlin police searched forhim, the city was flooded with picture postcards of the exploit showing thetrembling mayor standing before the ferocious captain, while another showedVoigt winking and smoking a fat cigar. The newspaper Berliner Tageblat said thathe ought to be rewarded, not punished, for teaching the Germans a lesson.Voigt was arrested ten days later in his room in a Berlin slum. Most of the4,000 marks were still unspent. He was sentenced to four years in jail but thiswas later reduced to twenty months – on the direct intervention of the kaiser,it was whispered.Voigt came out of prison in 1908 and discovered that a dramatist called Kalnberghad written a successful play called The Captain of Kopenick. Voigt requested,and received, a free seat for a performance of the play.The case had political echoes. In 1910, Herr von Oldenburg-Januschau, afire-eating right winger, defended Prussian militarism against the dangerousliberalism that seemed to be undermining the country. He declared, ‘It mustalways be possible for the German Emperor and King of Prussia to tell thenearest lieutenant: take ten men and close down the Reichstag (parliament).’This sentiment backfired as comedians all over Germany parodied the statement.After the exploit of Wilhelm Voigt, Prussian authoritarianism was no longertreated with quite the same respect."},{"pageContent":"WATERGATETHE US PRESIDENTIAL SCANDALAT 1 O’CLOCK IN the morning of 17 June 1972, a young black security guard namedFrank Wills, who worked in the vast Washington complex of shops and offices thatincluded the Watergate Hotel, noticed that the spring catch of a door into abasement garage had been ‘taped’ back – that is, a piece of sticky tape had beenstuck over the catch to prevent it from closing. Clearly, whoever had done itwas no professional burglar, for a professional would have placed the tapevertically down the edge of the door, where it could not have been seen when thedoor was closed, not horizontally, as this was. He removed the tape – lockingthe door – but when he came back from eating a cheeseburger at the HowardJohnson motel across the street, the lock was taped again. So whoever had donethis was not only no professional; he was also stupid enough not to realize thatin replacing the tape, he was alerting the security guard that an intruder wasstill in the building.He called the police. A three-man patrol arrived, and found that locks on thesixth floor had also been taped. This floor contained the temporary office ofthe Democratic National Committee, the ruling body of the Democratic Party. Andas the police moved from room to room, they trapped, and then arrested, five menhiding behind a desk. What was happening soon emerged when the leader of thefive admitted – after offering a false identity – that he was James McCord,security co-ordinator for the Campaign to Re-elect the President, (CRP – knownto Democrats as Creep) i.e. Richard Nixon. His co-burglars were carryingelectronic gear for bugging phones, and large sums of money in hundred dollarbills – presumably their ‘wages’. They were – it emerged later – intending totap the phone of Larry O’Brien, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.The other burglars had all worked for the CIA, the foreign Intelligence service,and three had been involved in the abortive invasion of Cuba in 1961.Clearly, someone was up to ‘dirty tricks’ – although, looking back on it fromseveral decades later, we might be forgiven for feeling that no very seriouscrime had been committed. However, the Republicans had most certainly beencaught with their trousers down, and the Democrats can hardly be blamed forplaying it for all it was worth. Which is exactly what they did. And althoughNixon was, in fact, re-elected in November 1972, the clamour continued until hewas forced to resign in August 1974.But to return to 17 June 1972: when the burglars were arrested, two more men,Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy, the planners of the operation, were in a room inthe Watergate Hotel; warned by a look-out, they lost no time in fleeing. Huntwas an ex-CIA agent, while Liddy, an ex-FBI man, was finance counsellor of theCRP.At the time the news of the arrests was reported, President Nixon was in theBahamas. His Chief of Staff, Bob Haldeman, was in Florida. John Mitchell, formerAttorney-General and now Director of the CRP, was at a fundraising event in LosAngeles. John Dean, counsel of the president, was in the Philippines. Only thePresident’s Domestic Policy Advisor, John Ehrlichman, was in Washington.Liddy rang his own immediate boss, Jeb Magruder (who had authorized thebreak-in) in Los Angeles. Magruder was appalled. He had never liked Liddy – whohad a hair-trigger temper – and now groaned: ‘Oh God, why didn’t I fire thatidiot when I had the chance?’ But he now made a serious mistake. He told Liddyto approach Richard Kleindienst, the new Attorney-General, and ask him to getthe burglars out of jail. This involved the assumption that Kleindienst was amere catspaw of the president, and when Liddy approached him at his golf club,he was furious, and rang the prosecutor handling the case to tell him that theburglars were to be treated like anybody else.Back in Washington, Bob Haldeman began the cover-up operation by ordering thatvarious documents be shredded. Hunt was ordered to get out of town, and flew toLos Angeles. John Dean, however, declined to throw a briefcase full of evidenceinto the Potomac, and so managed to emerge from the case with his reputationmore or less intact.The day after the break-in, John Mitchell issued a statement that the burglarswere not operating with the consent of the White House, and that the CRPdeplored what had happened. Four days later, the president himself stated thatthe White House had no involvement in the incident.This was plainly absurd; on whose behalf was the Democratic headquarters beingbugged, if not the president’s?While the burglars were awaiting trial, newspaper investigation revealed that$114,000 had been paid into the account of one of the accused, Bernard Barker,and the signator of a traceable cheque (most of the money was ‘laundered’) saidit was a $25,000 campaign contribution paid to the CRP. This seemed undoubtedproof that the burglars were linked to the CRP. So as the press stepped up thepressure – two young reporters on the Washington Post, Carl Bernstein and BobWoodward, were told to devote their full time to investigating everyoneconnected to the break-in – the White House’s problem was damage limitation.Whithin a week or so, the investigators heard the name Gordon Liddy, who wassupposedly involved in an organization known as ‘the Plumbers’, or White HouseSpecial Investigations Unit, a kind of ‘dirty tricks’ squad who were paid bymoney siphoned off from campaign contributions to the CRP. In mid-September 1972Liddy and his co-conspirator Howard Hunt were also arrested.What the CRP did not know was that someone in their own ranks had turnedtraitor, and was passing information on to Woodward and Bernstein. His identityis still a secret, but he became known as ‘Deep Throat’ (after a famouspornographic film of that period). More than anyone else, Deep Throat wasresponsible for the White House’s accumulating problems.But why should the White House want to organize a burglary in June 1972, whenNixon was well ahead in the polls?The problem had begun in 1971, when a former government employee named DanielEllsberg, a passionate opponent of the war in Vietnam, released to the pressvarious classified documents about the Vietnam War. Ellsberg was clearly in thewrong, since he had broken his oath of secrecy; but in that atmosphere ofanti-war demonstrations, he received widespread support from liberals. LyndonJohnson had been driven out of the White House by the anti-war movement, and oneresult was a conservative backlash that brought Nixon to power.In June 1971, the Washington Post began publishing the ‘Pentagon papers’, andtwo weeks later received support from the Supreme Court on grounds of freedom ofthe press. Liddy and Hunt had been sent to California to try and dig upinformation showing Ellsberg to be of unsound mind, and they organized abreak-in at the office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist Dr Fielding. When JohnEhrlichman, Nixon’s Domestic Policy Advisor, heard about it, he lost no time inordering this line of approach to be discontinued. But Nixon, feeling himselfunder siege from liberals and leftists, began to show signs of paranoia; he evenordered a phone tap on Henry Kissinger, his own National Security Advisor.Watergate sprang from this atmosphere of paranoia and mistrust. The ‘Plumbers’were founded to investigate White House leaks.By the autumn of 1972 Nixon heartily wished he had never heard of Watergate, buthis opponents had no intention of letting him off the hook.Nixon decided that more of the CRP team had to be thrown to the wolves. On 30April 1973, he broadcast to the nation, admitting that there had been a cover-up– although he had not been involved himself – and he now wished to announce theresignation of Haldeman and Ehrlichman, ‘two of the finest public servants ithas been my privilege to know.’ He also announced the resignations of John Deanand Richard Kleindienst. John Mitchell resigned, giving as his reason that hiswife had left him.It was all, of course, too late. The media had smelt blood and the Americanpublic was delighted to be entertained with this escalating political scandal.If Nixon had jumped off the roof of the White House, everybody would have beendisappointed that the show had finished so soon.In fact, there were fresh developments on the day of Nixon’s broadcast, whenJudge Matthew Byrne, presiding over the Ellsberg trial in Los Angeles, orderedEllsberg to be released, on the grounds that the ‘conduct of the government’ hadprecluded a fair trial. He also revealed that he had been offered thedirectorship of the FBI, the implication being clearly that he was being offereda bribe to find Ellsberg guilty.Just as Nixon must have felt his fortunes were hitting rock bottom, there was aneven greater disaster. On 17 July 1973, Alexander Butterfield, a Haldeman aide,told the Senate Investigation Committee that for the past two years, Nixon hadbeen taping all phone conversations in the White House. This meant that therewas taped evidence about whether or not Nixon had ordered the Watergatebreak-in.Understandably, the Committee wanted those tapes. Equally understandably, Nixonwas determined to hang on to them. (His aim in making them had apparently beento provide material for a future book on his presidency, and he regarded them ashis personal property.) He claimed ‘executive privelege’.The ensuing struggle was bitter. Nixon offered a ‘summary’ and the Committeedeclined. And when some of the tapes were handed over, on 21 November 1973, noone was surprised when one of them proved to have an eighteen and a half minutegap in a conversation between Nixon and Haldeman. Nixon’s secretary admitttedthat she had ‘accidentally erased’ five minutes, but that left thirteen and ahalf minutes unaccounted for.Now everyone was asking: can an incumbent president be indicted and broughtbefore a grand jury – perhaps even sent to jail? More tapes were demanded andreluctantly handed over, Nixon protesting that all this would ‘irreparablydamage the presidency.’ In July, the Supreme Court ruled against him. And inlate July, the Judiciary Committee voted that the president should be impeached,accused of conduct ‘designed to obstruct justice’.Shown by the tapes to have directed the FBI agents away from the White House,Nixon was forced to admit that he was involved in the cover-up, and this costhim his support in Congress. In the country itself, his popularity had dwindledfrom 61 per cent to 27 per cent since the election. He resigned the presidencyon 9 August 1974. His vice president Gerald Ford (who had taken over from thedisgraced Spiro Agnew, forced to resign through a tax-evasion scandal) becamepresident on 6 December 1974.Although Ford had stated that he would not interfere with the indictment ofRichard Nixon, he in fact granted him a full pardon a month after assumingoffice on 6 December 1974. His own popularity rating instantly dropped from 71per cent to 50 per cent, and the slump undoubtedly played a part in hiselectoral defeat by Jimmy Carter in 1976.A suggestion that all the Watergate conspirators should be pardoned encountereduniversal hostility. Haldeman would serve eighteen months, and write abestselling book, The Ends of Power. Ehrlichman also served eighteen months.Charles W. Colson, a senior White House aide (who had threatened that afterNixon won the election, the administration was going to ‘shove it in’ to theWashington Post), received seven months. (In fact, challenges of the Post’sownership of two Florida TV stations had caused the Washington Post stock todrop by 50 per cent.) John Dean would serve four months for conspiracy (but hisbook Blind Ambition was also a bestseller, and that, plus a televisionpresentation, made him a millionaire). Jeb Magruder was in jail for seven monthsand became a born-again Christian. John Mitchell served nineteen months.As to the original ‘Watergate seven’, Gordon Liddy was sentenced to ‘not lessthan six years and eight months, and not more than twenty years’. (He served 52months in jail, the longest of all.) Hunt was sentenced to 35 years, of which heserved 33 months. The ‘Miami four’ (Eugenio Martinez, Bernard Barker, VirgilioGonzales and Frank Sturgis) were sentenced to forty years each, but in factserved between twelve and fifteen months each. McCord served four months.Nixon’s reputation saw a slow but steady rise for the remaining twenty years ofhis life (he died on 22 April 1994); a series of television interviews withDavid Frost showed him in a sympathetic light, while television programmes abouthis life underlined his real political achievement. In retrospect it isdifficult to maintain the view of Nixon as ‘the man who shamed a nation’."},{"pageContent":"WELLS, H. G.THE LOVE LIFE OF A LITERARY DON JUANAS A LIFELONG seducer of women, H.G. Wells was the subject of a great deal ofscandalous gossip – Arnold Bennett recorded in his journal, perhaps with a touchof envy, that Wells openly displayed photographs of his various mistresses onthe mantelpiece. However, the gossip never reached the general public; perhapsthe nearest thing to an open disclosure was a malicious story of M. P. Shielcalled ‘The Primate of the Rose’ in which Wells is represented as a popular butmediocre journalist-philosopher whose self-esteem depends upon sexual conquest.(Wells had once stretched the truth in the opposite direction when he describedShiel as ‘a flaming genius’.)Wells was the son of a gardener and a maidservant. He experienced a great dealof poverty during his childhood in Bromley, Kent, where his father ran anunsuccessful crockery shop; his mother deserted the family when he was thirteenand became housekeeper in a country mansion. ‘Bertie’ (as he was known) wasapprenticed to the drapery trade, which he hated as much as Dickens hated theblacking factory, and he ran away at the first opportunity. (His mother forcedhim to return just as promptly.) He became a schoolmaster, gained a scholarshipto the South Kensington School of Science, had a few articles accepted, andbecame a writer. (His first book was a textbook of biology.) He came near todying of tuberculosis, married his cousin, and slowly achieved success. Butduring the period when he was struggling to make a living, his marriage brokeup, and he ran away with one of his students, Amy Catherine Robbins.Unfortunately for Wells, who was sexually insatiable, Catherine was only mildlyinterested in lovemaking, so he remained sexually obsessed with his first wife.(In his autobiography, he even admits to going over to see her a few years aftertheir separation and imploring her to give herself to him again; she refused.)Soon after marrying Catherine in October 1895, Wells was unfaithful for thefirst time. He was alone in the house with a Miss Ethel Kingsmill, to whom hiswife was teaching the retouching of negatives. ‘I forget by what excuse EthelKingsmill flitted from her retouching desk upstairs to my study. But shesucceeded in dispelling all the gloomy apprehensions I was beginning toentertain, that lovemaking was nothing more than an outrage inflicted uponreluctant womankind. . . . The sound of my returning aunt’s latch-key separatedus in a state of flushed and happy accomplishment.’ Wells had been virtuallysex-starved up to the age of thirty but he set out to make up for it in theremaining fifty years of his life.In the posthumously published postscript to his autobiography (H. G. Wells inLove, 1984), Wells describes how it was the renewal of acquaintance with achildhood friend, Sidney Bowkett, who had become an actor, that converted himfrom a romantic attitude towards women into a determination to ‘get’ them.Bowkett boasted about his own conquests.The first girl Wells tried to ‘get’ was apparently a teenager named May Nisbet,the illegitimate daughter of a journalistic colleague, E.F. Nisbet, who had diedsuddenly. Wells paid the girl’s school expenses and invited her to his house atSandgate for holidays. He describes her as a ‘gawky and rather sullen girl’ offifteen or sixteen, to whom he was not particularly attracted until ‘one dayupon the beach at Sandgate she came down towards me wearing a close-fittingbathing dress; instantly she seemed the quintessence of sunlit youth to me, andI was overwhelmed with a rush of physical desire . . .’ He goes on to say, ‘Inever gratified that physical desire’, and then adds, rather puzzlingly, ‘I madelove to May Nisbet, but quite vaguely and inconclusively . . .’ But thisinconclusive love affair aroused a desire ‘that had to be assuaged’.He met a writer named Violet Hunt at some literary gathering, who experienced‘the same restless craving for the clasp of an appreciative body as myself’.They became lovers. ‘There were one or two other passades about this time.’ Onewas with Ella D’Arcy, who wrote short stories in The Yellow Book; another wasDorothy Richardson, a schoolfriend of Catherine Wells, whose mother hadcommitted suicide, and who had become a dentist’s receptionist. ‘For me, it wasa sensuous affair, for Dorothy was then a glowing blonde. . . . But a vein ofego-centred mysticism in her had always made her mentally irritating to me; sheseemed to promise the jolliest intimate friendship; she had an adorable dimplein her smile; she was most interestingly hairy on her body, with fine goldenhair, and then – she would begin intoning the dull clever things that filledthat shapely, rather large, flaxen head of hers; she would lecture me onphilology and the lingering vestiges of my Cockney accent, while there was not astitch between us.’ Dorothy Richardson later gave an account of her love affairwith Wells – calling him Hypo Wilson – in a volume of her autobiographical novelPilgrimage (Dawn’s Left Hand). He also recalls a woman from Australia who hadread Kipps and asked him to come to her lodgings, and a black prostitute inAmerica with whom he talked literature after their lovemaking.In 1901, a book called Anticipations, containing Wells’s vision of the future,was a considerable success, and Wells was invited to join the Fabian Society, asocialist group run by Sidney Webb, Bernard Shaw, Graham Wallas and HubertBland. Bland, who looked the typical English gentleman, with his monocle andbristling moustache, was himself an incorrigible Don Juan. He was married toEdith Nesbit, the writer of children’s books, and his wife’s best friend, MissHoatson, also lived with them. When Miss Hoatson announced that she waspregnant, Edith was warmly sympathetic until she found out that her husband wasthe father of the baby. She ordered Miss Hoatson out of the house but Blandthreatened to go too so they continued as a ménage à trois. In due course, Blandturned to seducing his daughters’ schoolfriends. Then, according to Wells, hebegan to contemplate incest with Rosamund, his illegitimate daughter, a‘dark-eyed sturdy girl’. Wells decided that the best way to save Rosamund was toseduce her himself. Bland found out his intention before this was accomplishedand was furious, while Edith Nesbit wrote letters to Catherine Wells denouncingher tolerance of her husband’s affairs. ‘Rosamund was hastily snatched out of myreach.’Wells was becoming a leading figure in the Fabian Society, challenging Shaw andthe ‘old guard’ for leadership. His heady teachings about sexual freedominspired a number of young ladies with ardent admiration. One of these was AmberReeves, a teenage student at Cambridge, who was the daughter of two Fabians,Maud and Pember Reeves. Maud Reeves encouraged the development of a friendshipbetween Wells and her daughter, a pretty, dark-haired girl. They used to go forlong walks and discuss social questions. Wells called her Dusa (short forMedusa). One day, Amber told Wells she was in love and when Wells asked ‘Withwhom?’, she hurled herself into his arms. Wells was never one to decline aninvitation to lovemaking. They stripped and climbed into bed although withoutlovemaking. In Soho shortly thereafter, Amber surrendered her virginity –probably in one of the hired rooms that Wells had learned about from VioletHunt. They spent some days together in a lodging at Southend while Amber wassupposed to be with friends in Epping and then Wells took a room in London wherethey could spend a day together every week or so. He describes how they wouldsnatch opportunities for lovemaking on country walks and how they obtained thekey of a church belfry from the sexton and made love in the room below thebells.Wells told himself that this was the ideal situation for a writer: Amber, themistress, Jane (as he called his wife), the understanding mate, and his work.Amber told her mother about the relationship and Maud Reeves did her best to bebroad minded. (For some reason, this always seems to be easier for the mother ofa seduced girl than for the father.)Soon Amber Reeves became aware that she was pregnant. Her father had to be toldand this was done by a young man called Rivers Blanco White, who was in lovewith Amber himself, and wanted to marry her. Pember Reeves ‘became all that aneighteenth-century father should be’, declared his intention of shooting Wellsand made the whole affair a public scandal – at least, among the Fabians.Wells was greatly torn. His ideal ménage à trois was turning into a nightmareand there was no doubt that for Amber, the ideal solution would have been forWells to divorce Jane and marry her. But Wells was too fond of his home andchildren. The worst of it was that he was physically addicted to Amber. Wellsinstalled her in a chalet in Le Touquet and rushed over to see her as often aspossible. Finally, he told her that the best solution would be for her to acceptthe offer of marriage from Rivers White. She was shocked and indignant. Wellsleft her. On her way back to England on the Channel packet, she attempted tojump overboard but was saved by a steward. Finally, exhausted, she agreed tomarry Rivers White.Beatrice Webb, a leading Fabian, was particularly outraged by Wells’s conductand began writing poison-pen letters to other members of the Society who hadteenage daughters, warning them to keep them out of Wells’s reach. One of theseletters was sent to Sidney Olivier, a member of the ‘old guard’ who had fourpretty daughters. Olivier liked Wells and showed him the letter saying, ‘Here’ssomething that will make you laugh.’ Wells was furious and wrote the Webbs aletter so full of abuse that it made Sidney Webb recognize that his wife wasrunning the risk of a libel suit. Beatrice ceased to write the poison-penletters but continued her campaign verbally. She was even more outraged to learnthat Wells was a frequent visitor at the cottage at Woldingham, in Surrey, inwhich the young married couple had settled. Rivers White must have been eitheran admirer of Wells or a singularly weak man, for he allowed Wells to live withthem in a ménage à trois for several weeks. Wells and Amber still contrived tomeet after she had had the baby, a daughter, and in later life, she and Wellsand Rivers White once again resumed an open friendship. Wells remarks in hisautobiography that, ‘I do not see much of Blanco White because I find himsententious and argumentative in an unimaginative way. I prefer . . . toentertain her alone. I take her to a theatre or opera at times or we dine at arestaurant . . .’His wife’s attitude was equally accommodating. Wells implies that she wasperfectly happy to see her husband having affairs with other women. ‘Jane waswonderful. She betrayed no resentment, no protesting egotism. She had never seenor felt our relationship as being primarily sexual. . . . She had alwaysregarded my sexual imaginativeness as a sort of constitutional disease; shestood by me patiently, unobtrusively waiting for the fever to subside. Perhapsif she had not been immune to such fevers, I should not have gone astray . . .’This, at all events, was Wells’s rationalization. Unfortunately, we have nodirect insight into how Jane Wells felt about it. We only know that she died ofan abdominal cancer in 1927.Wells further scandalized the Fabians by publishing a novel called Ann Veronica,which had been written during his affair with Amber, about a girl who proposesto her college teacher that she should become his mistress. Every reviewer inLondon knew that Ann Veronica was Amber Reeves and it seemed that Wells wasflaunting his immorality. The reading public was shocked at the idea that a‘nice’ young, middle-class girl should offer her virginity to her teacher andthat he should accept it. The chorus of outrage made Ann Veronica something of abestseller. There was further trouble two years later with Wells’s novel The NewMachiavelli, about a politician who deserts his wife for his mistress – themistress was again clearly based on Amber Reeves. (There was also an acidportrait of the Webbs.) When the book appeared, after being turned down byseveral publishers, it was banned by a number of book sellers and libraries butthe controversy did the sales no harm.It was as well that Jane lacked the proprietorial temperament. After the breakwith Amber, Wells set himself up in a flat in Candover Street and tried to getthe ‘fever of Amber’ out of his blood by sleeping with as many young women aspossible. One of these was Elizabeth von Arnim, a successful authoress who hadleft her German husband, the Count von Arnim, because he wanted to keep her in aperpetual state of pregnancy. She had called on the Wellses at Sandgate, wasapparently fascinated by Wells’s reputation as a lady-killer, and became hismistress at the first opportunity. They went abroad together several times andmade love on the pine needles at her villa near Montana. While he was stillhaving an affair with her, he met another young woman who showed an immediateinclination to become his mistress. Her name was Cicely Fairfield; she wroteunder the name of Ibsen’s heroine, Rebecca West. She had attacked one of Wells’sbooks and he asked her to come and see him. She spent a weekend with Wells andhis wife. The next time they met, ‘face to face with my bookshelves, in themidst of a conversation about style or some such topic, and apropos of nothing,we paused and suddenly kissed one another.’ She went to see Wells at his flat inSt James’s Court and they became lovers. ‘It was our second encounter and shebecame pregnant.’ Rebecca declined to have an abortion, so Wells rented a villaat the seaside town of Hunstanton and persuaded her to go there. In due course ason, Anthony West, was born. Rebecca made a series of moves from place to placebut it was only after an unpleasant episode in a house at Leigh-on-Sea, when itdawned on her that an unmarried mother was regarded with contempt even by theservants, that she decided to replace Jane as Wells’s wife. Jane’s reaction wassimply to pass the word round that Rebecca was behaving badly. When this gotback to Rebecca, she gave way to violent emotions that thoroughly alienated herlover. He flatly refused to divorce Jane and marry her. So the stormyrelationship dragged on until, after World War I, it gradually broke apart. Inthe biography of his father, Anthony West suggests that she was a mythomaniac –not so much a liar as a person who totally believed her own fantasies.In 1923, Wells’s private life almost became public property. A ‘pretty youngwoman with a face like the Mona Lisa’ came to see him from Vienna, to tell himabout what was happening in Austria. She also asked if she could translateWells’s Story of a Great Schoolmaster, which provided a further excuse to seeWells. One day when Jane was absent ‘she passed rather suddenly and skilfullyfrom an intelligent appreciation of my educational views to passionatedeclarations. . . . I hate to snub an exile in distress, and she was anextremely appetising young woman . . .’ He was soon forced to recognize yetagain that there is probably no such thing as a love affair without ‘strings’attached. She bombarded him with letters about her adoration and Wells gave wayand ‘assuaged her sufferings on various occasions’. One weekend she came down toFelsted, near Easton, where Wells was living, and asked him to call oneafternoon to meet her hosts. When Wells called, he found her alone for the hostshad gone away, leaving her in charge of the house. She was wearing a tea gownand nothing much besides. ‘“This must end,” said I, “this must end,” – allowingmyself to be dragged upstairs.’She went back to Austria for a while and when she returned, Wells had decided itwas time to call a halt to the affair. He instructed his maid that if she calledhe was not at home. One evening he was about to leave his Whitehall Court flatto go to dinner when the woman called and a temporary housemaid let her in.Wells went into his study and found her lying on the hearthrug, naked except fora waterproof – which she had opened – and her shoes and stockings. It is a proofof how far she had exhausted Wells’s patience that he declined the invitationand went to summon the hall porter. While his back was turned, she produced arazor, and slashed her wrists and armpits. Two policemen were summoned and shewas taken off to Charing Cross Hospital. The carpet was covered with blood.Wells realized that this was the kind of story that could ruin him if it gotinto the newspapers. He had recently published his bestselling Outline ofHistory and was planning a further two immense volumes covering biology andsociology. How could readers take him seriously if the sight of his nameconjured up visions of a woman wearing only shoes and stockings lying with herlegs apart on a hearthrug? Fortunately, Wells knew two of the leading pressbarons, Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere. He telephoned them and explainedthe problem. They gave orders to all their newspapers that Wells had ceased tobe news for the next few weeks. And apart from a couple of brief mentions inother newspapers, the affair was suppressed. Later, Wells learned that the womanmade a habit of trying to commit suicide in front of lovers who had decided toget rid of her – she had learned how to cut her veins without bleeding to death.On his seventieth birthday, Wells had a friendly note from her, she was nowhappily married, and met her without unpleasant repercussions.Yet Wells never seemed to learn by experience. It was at about this time that hestarted yet another affair with a woman who was to cause him endless trouble –Odette Keun. The telephone rang and a woman’s voice explained that she had comefrom Grasse to see him; she asked him to come to her hotel. She had been writingto him for several years and made it clear that she wanted him to become herlover so Wells knew what he was letting himself in for. ‘I found myself in adimly lit apartment with a dark slender young woman in a flimsy wrap and anaroma of jasmine.’ She told him that he was all she had to live for. ‘“If youfeel like that,” said I . . .’ And in writing of the episode, Wells makes theacute observation: ‘This sort of free gift is one that no one should accept.’ Hewas beginning to suspect at last that this kind of bait usually had a fish-hookattached.But not soon enough. Odette Keun proved to be his biggest mistake so far. Shewas highly intelligent but aggressive, emotional and quarrelsome. Anthony Westsays that her ‘profound seriousness was masked . . . by a rather childish desireto shock and by a degree of sexual exhibitionism.’ She liked to repeat the storyof her ‘seduction’ of H.G. in mixed company. Fortunately, she was unable toobtain a visa to come to England, having had differences with the Britishauthorities in Constantinople, so Wells was able to keep his life with her apartfrom Jane and his family. He built a house for her in the South of France andhad inscribed over the fireplace: Two Lovers Built This House. (Wells toldCharlie Chaplin, who visited him there, that he had had it removed and restoredseveral times, after each violent quarrel.) But he soon began to find her anintolerable nuisance. She began by regarding him as a kind of superman. ‘Mygod-like quality diminished with every freedom I gave her. . . . The danger oflosing me, which had had the most salutary influence on her behaviour at thebeginning of our liaison, seemed to have passed altogether.’Wells tells a typical story of her craving to shock. A highly respectableEnglishman, Sir Wilfred Grenfell, was dining with them and Odette was hoping hewas going to invite her to Labrador, where he was in charge of various missions.The conversation turned to Casanova, and Sir Wilfred asked vaguely, ‘Now let mesee – what exactly did Casanova do?’ Wells saw an ominous brightness in Odette’seyes and knew there was nothing he could do about it. ‘She told him in a word.’An awful silence fell. Wells hastily intervened with more general information.Odette was not invited to Labrador.Wells was sick of her by 1928. But it was not until 1933 that she gave him theexcuse to break with her, by opening a letter from a woman friend who was not amistress, but who began her letter ‘Darling’. Odette threatened to tell thewoman’s husband. Wells told her that if she opened his letters, he was finishedwith her. But when he started to write the postscript to his autobiography in1934 he had to admit: ‘So Odette is receding out of my life down a diminuendo ofparting shots.’ The ‘parting shots’ were violently abusive letters which,according to Wells, were Odette’s normal way of letting off steam.Ironically, the only woman Wells really loved deeply in the last years of hislife refused to marry him. She was Baroness Moura Budberg, whom Wells had firstmet in St Petersburg in 1914. He met her again in 1920 when he went to Russia tovisit Lenin; she was now the secretary of Maxim Gorki. Wells learned later that,because of her connection with a British secret agent, Bruce Lockhart, she hadbeen blackmailed by the secret police into working for them and spying on Gorki.She decided to tell Gorki the truth; the result was that he became herprotector. When Wells was in Moscow she became his official interpreter. ‘I fellin love with her, made love to her, and one night at my entreaty she flittednoiselessly through the crowded apartments in Gorky’s flat to my embraces.’In 1929, at a time when Odette was making his life a misery, Moura turned up ata lecture Wells gave in Berlin, and he decided instantly that he was in lovewith her. In 1932, Odette exploded when Wells told her he expected to see Mouraat a writers’ conference in Dubrovnik and told him that if he went, he neednever come back. Wells seized on the excuse to leave their home in the South ofFrance for ever. Even his discovery that Moura was still a Russian spy made nodifference to his feelings. But he went through a crisis of misery and jealousywhen he discovered that she had been staying with Gorki at a time when shewanted him to believe she was at her home in Estonia. By the time he wrote abouther, in the postscript of his autobiography, in 1934, he had decided that ‘shedoes not cheat deliberately. It is just her easy way with fact. . . . Like achild she believes a thing as she says it . . .’ Their relationship lasted, onand off, until Wells’s death in 1946."},{"pageContent":"WILDE, OSCAR‘ONE MUST SEEK OUT WHAT IS MOST TRAGIC’OSCAR WILDE’S FATHER, Sir William Wilde, was a constant subject of Dublin gossipand scandal. Known as ‘the Wilde knight’, he was reputed to be the father ofmany illegitimate children – Bernard Shaw said he had a child in everyfarmhouse. In 1864 (when Oscar was ten), a libel case against his wife, LadyJane Francesca Wilde, turned into a trial of Sir William, a leading physician,on a charge of raping a female patient.Lady Jane had written a furious letter to a Dr Travers, Professor of MedicalJurisprudence at Trinity College, accusing his daughter of blackmailing SirWilliam and disseminating a pamphlet accusing him of ‘an intrigue’ with her. Thedaughter, Miss Mary Josephine Travers, decided to sue; she wanted £2,000damages.When the case came up on 12 December 1864, the prosecution lost no time ininforming the jury that ‘the particulars . . . are of so shocking a descriptionthat I wish to God it had devolved upon some other counsel to presentthem . . .’ Having cured Miss Travers of ear trouble, Sir William had lent herbooks and money, bought her bonnets and dresses, taken her to lectures andexhibitions, and finally raped her in his consulting room. (One lady fainted andhad to be carried out of the courtroom.) She had gone to him to be treated for aburn on her neck and in the course of the treatment had fainted. She hadawakened to realize that, alas, she was no longer a maid. Sir William had urgedher to keep this quiet. Miss Travers had gone to Lady Wilde to complain but hadbeen treated with scorn. She had attempted suicide with a dose of laudanum(opium) but had recovered. To redress her wrongs, she had printed the pamphletaccusing Sir William of taking advantage of her. When Miss Travers was called tothe witness box, the judge told the ladies in the gallery that any who wished todo so might leave; no one did. Then the prosecution asked the question, ‘Whenyou were unconscious was your person – er – violated?’ and Miss Travers replied,‘It was.’But the cross-examination was damaging. Why, Miss Travers was asked, did sheaccuse Sir William of violating her after administering chloroform? Miss Traversagreed that it had not happened like that but could give no excuse for printinga false version. Then Sergeant Sullivan, in Sir William’s defence, went in forthe kill. Had the alleged assault happened on other occasions? Blushing, MissTravers admitted that it had. She explained that Sir William had led up to itwith ‘rudeness and roughness’. But the jury must have found it a little odd thata girl who had been raped while unconscious should give the rapist theopportunity to do it several times more – even with rudeness and roughness. Thejury returned to say that they found Lady Wilde’s letter libellous, whichimplied that her husband was guilty, but they awarded Miss Travers only onefarthing in damages. The Wildes had to pay the considerable costs. Oscar shouldhave learned from the example of Miss Travers that it can be dangerous to accusesomeone of libel; it can lead to embarrassing counterclaims.Oscar Wilde was born on 16 October 1854. At seventeen he won a scholarship toTrinity College, Dublin. There he came under the influence of the remarkableProfessor of Ancient History, the Reverend John Pentland Mahaffy. It was fromMahaffy that Wilde picked up his passionate love of the classics, particularlythose of ancient Greece. At this time, Wilde’s sexual inclinations werebasically heterosexual, with a mild touch of ambivalence, such as may also benoted in Lord Byron. And, as with Byron, his intellectual and emotionalappreciation of Mediterranean pederasty laid the foundations for his laterdevelopment.At Trinity, and later at Oxford, Wilde was brilliant rather than hardworking. Hehad the typical charm of those born under Libra. At Oxford he came under theinfluence of John Ruskin, who taught him to appreciate painting andarchitecture, and Walter Pater, who taught that the basic aim of life is to livewith ‘a hard, gem-like flame’ and who revived Victor Cousin’s phrase ‘Art forart’s sake’. Pater confirmed Wilde in that intellectual elitism he had picked upfrom Mahaffy, the feeling that the true aristocrats of this world are the men ofbrilliance and imagination. And when, at the age of 23, he accompanied Mahaffyon a tour of Greece, the experience confirmed his conviction that beauty is theonly ultimate value.In his last year at Oxford, Wilde wrote to a friend: ‘I’ll be famous, and if notfamous, I’ll be notorious.’ And when he went to join his mother in London – hisfather had died – he decided to become both at once. His elder brother Willie,who had become a journalist, introduced him to editors, and Wilde published somepoems. He fell in love with the famous beauty Lily Langtry, mistress of thePrince of Wales, and wrote her a number of poems. When a volume of verse failedto bring him fame, he announced that a revolution in dress was more importantthan a revolution in morals, and began to call attention to himself with avelvet coat edged with braid, knee breeches and black silk stockings. He was oneof the first great modern experts in the art of self-publicity. By 1880, he wasbeing regularly satirized in Punch. In the following years, W.S. Gilbertportrayed him in Patience as the mediocre poet Bunthorne. Gilbert no doubtthought he was being cruel but Wilde was delighted with the notoriety it broughthim. This led to a request to go on a lecture tour of America. Wilde arrived inNew York with the typical comment, ‘I have nothing to declare but my genius.’ Hewas not particularly fond of America. Later, when he heard that Rossetti hadgiven someone the money to go to America he commented, ‘Of course, if one hadenough money to go to America, one wouldn’t go.’In 1883, after a lecture tour of Scotland, he announced his engagement toConstance Lloyd, daughter of an Irish barrister, a beautiful and sweet-naturedgirl. They were deeply in love and on the morning after his wedding night, Wildestrolled in Paris with his friend Robert Sherard and described his sexualpleasures with embarrassing detail. Two sons were born of the marriage.It was about two years after his marriage that Wilde made a shatteringdiscovery. At Oxford he had contracted syphilis from a prostitute and had been‘cured’ with mercury treatment (which had discoloured his teeth). Now he learnedthat the spirochaetes were still in his bloodstream. With modern treatment hewould have been cured in a weekend. As it was, he felt that he had to give upsex with Constance. At about this time he met a seventeen-year-old youth namedRobert (‘Robbie’) Ross, who was amusing, cultivated and amiable. Ross laterclaimed that he was the first male Wilde had been to bed with.Success was slow in arriving; early plays like Vera, or The Nihilists and TheDuchess of Padua failed to make an impression. He was literary critic for thePall Mall Gazette, and he became the editor of a magazine called The Lady’sWorld (renamed Woman’s World). He wrote short stories, children’s stories, poemsand essays. Finally, in 1891, when he was 37, The Picture of Dorian Grayappeared and caused a degree of public outrage that he must have found highlysatisfying. In the following year, Lady Windermere’s Fan went on at the StJames’s Theatre and finally made Wilde rich as well as famous.In the year of Dorian Gray, Wilde met a handsome young aristocrat of 22, LordAlfred Douglas, son of the Marquess of Queensberry (responsible for theQueensberry Rules in boxing). Soon they were inseparable, dining in expensiverestaurants, spending weekends at country houses, attending art exhibitions andfirst nights. Inevitably, they slept together, although Douglas later insistedthat there was no sodomy – only mutual masturbation and a certain amount of oralsex. ‘Bosie’ (as Wilde called Lord Alfred) was himself a pederast and preferredboys to older men. The French novelist André Gide has described how Wilde andDouglas were responsible for his own downfall. For years he had been strugglingagainst his homosexuality. In Algiers, he discovered that Wilde and Douglas werestaying in the same hotel – he had met Wilde in Paris. Before they set out forthe evening, Douglas remarked to Gide, ‘I hope you are like me. I have a horrorof women. I only like boys.’ Wilde told the ‘vile procurer who came to pilot usthrough the town’ that he wanted to see some Arab boys and added ‘as beautifulas bronze statues’. But a brawl broke out in the café the procurer took them toand they went home disappointed. Soon after, Douglas went off to Blidah, wherehe was hoping to buy an Arab boy from his family (in fact, the boy ran away witha woman). Wilde took Gide out for another evening in the Casbah, and in a littlecafé, a beautiful Arab youth came and played on a flute for them. Then Wilde ledGide outside and whispered in his ear, ‘Dear, would you like the littlemusician?’ and Gide, his voice choking, answered, ‘Yes.’ Later, the youth cameto a hotel room and Gide wrote: ‘My joy was unbounded, and I cannot imagine itgreater even if love had been added.’Back in London, Wilde met Alfred Taylor, an upper-class young man who had spenthis way through a fortune. Taylor was a homosexual who liked to dress as awoman; he burned incense in his dimly lit apartment and spent his days pickingup young men – many of them telegraph boys of the kind who figured in theCleveland Street scandal (see page 80) – and taking them back to his room forsex. The first youth Taylor picked up for Wilde was a twenty-year-old namedSidney Mavor – known in his own circle as Jenny. The following evening, Wildetook Taylor, Douglas and ‘Jenny’ to dinner at Kettner’s and afterwards Wilde andMavor went to a hotel room together. It emerged later that Wilde’s idea of sexwas to have the boy seated on his knee, while he fondled his genitals andoccasionally indulged in oral sex. Wilde would tell them to imagine they werewomen and that he was their lover, which suggests that his role wasfundamentally masculine and dominant. He disliked obviously feminine youths – hecommented once that having sex with coarse, masculine types gave him a feelingof ‘dining with panthers’. His appetite seems to have been enormous – he toldBeardsley once that he had had five messenger boys in one evening and had kissedthem all over their bodies. ‘They were all dirty and appealed to me for thatreason.’Some time in 1893, Douglas gave a suit of clothes to an unemployed clerk, whofound in the pockets a number of letters from Wilde. The result was an attemptto blackmail Wilde. ‘A very curious construction can be put on that letter,’said the blackmailer, to which Wilde replied, ‘Art is rarely intelligible to thecriminal classes.’ When the blackmailer said he could get £60 for the letterfrom a certain man, Wilde advised him to go and sell it immediately. Theastonished blackmailer relented and gave Wilde the letter back for nothing – anexample of Wilde’s extraordinary charm, which was based upon a fundamentalkindliness.Unfortunately, a copy of the letter fell into the hands of the Marquess ofQueensberry who was particularly outraged by the sentence: ‘It is a marvel thatthose rose-red lips of yours should have been made no less for music of songthan for the madness of kisses.’ Queensberry was an eccentric Scottisharistocrat – in The Trial of Oscar Wilde Montgomery Hyde calls him ‘arrogant,vain, conceited and ill tempered’, and says that he was probably mentallyunbalanced. One day when Queensberry saw Wilde and his son dining together atthe Café Royal, he allowed himself to be persuaded to join them, and was dazzledby Wilde’s charm, and told ‘Bosie’ afterwards that he could understand why heloved him. The ‘rose-red lips’ letter seems to have changed his mind and hewrote a furious letter ordering Douglas never to see Wilde again. Douglasreplied with a telegram: ‘What a funny little man you are.’ Queensberry began tohaunt the restaurants where Wilde and Douglas dined, threatening to thrashWilde. One afternoon, the Marquess came to Wilde’s house to order him to stopseeing his son. Wilde ordered him, and his bodyguard, out. Queensberry continuedto persecute Wilde. He tried to get into the theatre on the first night of TheImportance of Being Earnest, but was kept out by police. On 18 February 1895, heleft his card at Wilde’s club, the Albemarle, with a note written on it: ‘ToOscar Wilde, posing as a somdomite’ [sic]. When he received it two weeks later,Wilde decided to sue. He went to see a solicitor, Charles Humphries, and assuredhim that the accusation of being a sodomite was untrue. (He may well have felthe was being honest – he was not, as we know, inclined to sodomy.) Humphriesagreed to prosecute.The first trial proved a disaster for Wilde. His old schoolfellow Edward Carsonwas defending. Wilde was brilliant and amusing in the witness box but whenCarson declared in court that he would prove that Wilde brought boys to theSavoy Hotel, it was obvious that Queensberry had done his homework – or paidprivate detectives to do it – and the prosecution realized it would have towithdraw or suffer defeat. The Marquess was acquitted.Now Wilde’s friends begged him to flee the country. Homosexuality was a criminaloffence. Wilde refused and there was undoubtedly a touch of masochism in hisrefusal. In fact, he seemed to identify himself with Christ and to believe thathe had to live out a tragic destiny. (‘One must always seek what is mosttragic,’ Wilde had told Gide.) On the day the Marquess was acquitted, a warrantwas issued for Wilde’s arrest, on a charge of committing acts of indecency withvarious male persons. Taylor, who had refused to betray Wilde, was also chargedwith him. This, Montgomery Hyde insists, was unfair to Wilde, since the caseagainst Taylor was a great deal stronger than that against Wilde. The secondtrial lasted from 6 April to 19 April 1895. The judge’s summing up was inWilde’s favour – at least, he urged the jury to take into account every possibledoubt of Wilde’s guilt. The jury failed to reach an agreement. For the nextthree weeks Wilde was out on bail.The third trial began on 20 May 1895, and this time, Taylor was triedseparately. He was soon found guilty of indecent acts with males. Then Wildestepped into the dock. Again, a succession of working-class young men describedbeing taken back to Wilde’s room. Sodomy sometimes took place; more often,mutual masturbation and fellatio. Wilde was again brilliant and amusing in thebox but seldom convincing. Finally, as everyone by now expected, Wilde was foundguilty on every count but one. He and Taylor were sentenced to two years’imprisonment with hard labour.Wilde was taken to Reading jail. Standing around on the station platform heremarked to the guard, ‘If this is the way Her Majesty treats her prisoners, shedoesn’t deserve to have any.’ But the old sparkle had gone. The experience ofprison almost drove Wilde insane. He wallowed in self-pity and wrote a longletter – in fact, a short book – to Alfred Douglas, accusing him of his ruin. Itwas later published, in an expurgated version, as De Profundis. His hard labourconsisted in picking oakum (that is unpicking old ropes for caulking boats). Heserved every day of his sentence and was finally released on 19 May 1897.The desire to write had vanished. ‘Something is killed in me,’ he told RobbieRoss. Constance Wilde died in a nursing home in Genoa after an operation tocorrect a spinal injury, soon after reading Wilde’s long poem The Ballad ofReading Gaol. Wilde went to Dieppe, where he bumped into the poet Ernest Dowson,who persuaded him to go to a brothel. Wilde did not enjoy it. ‘The first inthese ten years – and it will be the last,’ he told Dowson. ‘It was like coldmutton.’ He lived in Paris under the name of Sebastian Melmoth – borrowing thename from the Gothic novel Melmoth the Wanderer by Maturin – and died in povertyin a cheap hotel on the Left Bank on 30 November 1900, telling a friend who cameto see him, ‘I am dying beyond my means.’"},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYAlexander, Marc The Outrageous Queens (Frederick Muller, 1977)Altick, Richard D.
