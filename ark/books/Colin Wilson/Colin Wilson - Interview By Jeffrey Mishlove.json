I'm JeffreyMishlove. Today we're going to be exploring the heights and thedepths of consciousness. With me is one of the most prolificwriters in the English language, Colin Wilson, author of overseventy books, including seventeen novels and numerous worksin criminology, existential philosophy, psychology, religion, theoccult, mysticism, wine, and music. Amongst his most wellknown books are A Criminal History of Mankind, The MindParasites, The Philosopher's Stone, Religion and the Rebel, TheOccult, Mysteries, and of course, his first book, which became aworld-wide best-seller in 1956 when he was twenty-four years ofage, The Outsider. Welcome, Colin. You know, to my surprise,although you've written widely in so many areas and havewritten so much, you've described yourself as a person who hasbasically written on one theme your entire life."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm2/16COLIN WILSON: Yes, I've written the same book seventy timesover.MISHLOVE: And that is reconciling this issue of the heights ofconsciousness with the depths of despair.WILSON: You know, Isaiah Berlin once said that there are twokinds of writers, hedgehogs and foxes. He said the fox knowsmany things, the hedgehog knows just one thing. SoShakespeare is a typical fox; Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky aretypical hedgehogs. Now, I'm a typical hedgehog. I know just onething, and I repeat it over and over again. I try to approach itfrom different angles to make it look different, but it's the samething.MISHLOVE: Much of your writing has focused on your ownworking through of states of panic, states of despair, that you'veexperienced in your own life.WILSON: Yes, I suppose that first book, The Outsider, wasalmost an autobiography, and of course twenty-five years later,when I produced this book Mysteries, I suddenly had thishorrifying series of panic attacks that made me feel I was goinginsane, due to overwork. I'd been working very, very hard on aseries of books about crime. I was supposed to write theintroduction to each issue, and so it was pretty hard work. Saythe issue was on kidnapping. We would have a big kidnappingcase and a big kidnapping trial, and my business was to do thehistory of kidnapping from the beginning. So I had to read up alot of stuff to do this. What happened was that the publishersaid, \"OK, the American publisher says we can go.\" So off wewent, and he said, \"Look, I'm afraid we're going to need four"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm3/16articles per week.\" Well, this was OK; you know, three thousandwords each is about twelve pages. And then later he said, \"I'mawfully sorry. We're going to need seven articles per week.\" Andthen, when I was really working like a madman, he said, \"Look, Idon't know whether you can manage this, but we need tenarticles per week.\" Now, this is a full-length book every threeweeks. I was doing pretty well; I was working away nicely, andone day two bloody Canadian journalists came to interview me.They were bores. They talked and talked and talked and talked,and I was doing pretty well until then, but you know the way youget when someone just talks, you get, uhhhhhhhh, and I did this,and I went to bed the second night when they'd been there, andabout four o'clock in the morning I woke up feeling a bit hungover, and began to think about all the work I'd got to do, andquite suddenly my heart began to pound and my face went allhot, and I thought, perhaps I'd better go straight downstairs andget to work immediately. Then I thought, no, no, no, you're goingreally insane if you do that. And I made a great mistake. I tried torepress it by sheer will power, and this was a mistake, because Icould have done it if I'd gone all the way through with it, but it'slike pulling back a spring and being terrified suddenly that it'llbound back on you. I let go, and quite suddenly my heart beganto pound so fast I thought I was having a heart attack, so Irushed into the lavatory and I just sat there in the cool, trying tocalm myself down, as you might try to calm a frightened horse.Then I went back to bed after half an hour, and it just startedagain, as soon as I got into bed. So I went to the sitting roomand put the lights on, and I thought, what's happening? I hadonce written a book called The Mind Parasites, which was aboutthis idea that parasites can insert themselves into yourunconscious mind and just suck your energies dry, and that was"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm4/16supposed to be a parable of what was wrong with human beings-- you know, what you might call original sin. But now I wassuddenly experiencing the damn thing. Finally after hours I wentback to bed and I managed to stop the panic by just staring atthe window frame and refusing to let my mind move an inch ineither direction. Finally I fell asleep, but I woke up the nextmorning a total physical wreck, drained of energy. Now, Imanaged to get rid of this by actually describing it. I just wentdownstairs and wrote it down, and this is the opening of mybook Mysteries. I just put it straight down on paper, and when Ifinished that I felt much better. But that night, before I went tobed, I thought, Oh God, I hope it doesn't happen again, and ofcourse there's no more sure way of making sure it does happenagain. I woke up in the middle of the night, thought about it --you know, boom, boom, boom -- and off it all went again. Andyou get this sort of funny sound in your ears, as if you'reswimming under water, and so on. I finally discovered, afterthree or four nights of this, that I could control it if I woke myselfup as fully as I possibly could, and then it was like aschoolmistress coming to a room full of quarreling schoolboysand [clapping] like that -- a sudden deathly silence. I found thatI'd discovered the basic trick. It was as if there was a kind ofhigher Colin Wilson up there, and when he chose to come downand make his presence known, everything was OK. But youknow the way you are in the middle of the night -- you wake upand you begin to worry about money and all kinds of things. Thelower levels take over in the middle of the night. Well, this iswhat happened. Now, that experience seemed to me socompletely pointless and miserable and rotten that I could seeno meaning in it. It seemed to undermine all my life's work. Andyet, when at the end of three months I'd sort of struggled with"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm5/16this, what it amounted to was catching my adrenalin before itflooded into my bloodstream. As soon as I became afraid -- youknow, you feel that surge of adrenalin, and everything goes hot.It was kind of like catching a fly in the air, before the adrenalingets into your blood stream, and stopping it dead. I learned thistrick after a while, catching the adrenalin. And when finally Iovercame the panic attacks, I realized that my wife could drop aplate on the floor and I didn't even flinch. I could stop theadrenalin like that. The interesting thing was, I only realizedafterwards that this was the most valuable experience of mywhole life -- that it had taught me the real problems that I'd beenwriting about in The Outsider.MISHLOVE: Well, much of the history of mystical, shamanistic,psychic training has to do with curing oneself of forms of whatwe might think of as insanity. It seems that you went almostthrough a shamanistic initiation here.WILSON: Well, I don't know. I'd always, you see, even in myearly teens, had these problems -- problems of suddenly wakingup in the middle of the night and having this horrifying vision thatlife is completely meaningless. You know -- just thinking aboutsomething like the depths of space, and realizing it's got tocome to an end somewhere, but apparently it doesn't, and thensuddenly getting this terrible feeling that maybe life is a totaldelusion. G.K. Chesterton once said that in his teens he sawhell, and I really think I did too. I went through extremedepressions, glooms. There was one occasion on which Idecided actually to commit suicide. I'd got into this state -- I wasworking as a lab assistant at the school, and what would happenwas that I'd make tremendous efforts to push myself up to alevel of optimism. I'd do it in the evenings by reading poetry,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm6/16thinking, writing in my journals, then I'd go back to the school thenext day and blaaahhh, right down to the bottom again. Thiswas the feeling of The Mind Parasites -- there's something thatwaits until you've got lots of energy and just sucks you dry like avampire. This sudden feeling that God was making fun of memade me feel one day, \"For God's sake, let's not have any moreof this nonsense. I'm damned if I'll be played about with like this.Let me kill myself.\" And immediately I felt this, I felt a curioussense of inner strength. So I went off to night school quitedetermined that what I was going to do was to take down thebottle of potassium cyanide from the reagent shelves and drinkit. I knew that cyanide burns a hole in the bottom of the stomachand kills you within seconds. Well, I went into the classroomquite determined. There was a group gathered around theprofessor at the desk. I went over to the reagent shelves, I tookdown the bottle of potassium cyanide, I uncorked it, and as Istarted raising this to my lips I suddenly had an extremely clearvision of myself in a few seconds' time with an agonizing pain inthe pit of my stomach, and at the same time I suddenly turnedinto two people. I don't mean that literally, but I mean that therewas I, and there beside me was this silly, bloody little idiot calledColin Wilson who was in a state of self-pity and about to killhimself, and I didn't give a damn whether the fool killed himselfor not. The trouble was, if he killed himself he'd kill me too. Andquite suddenly a terrific sense of overwhelming happiness cameover me. I corked up the bottle, put it on the shelf, and for thenext few days was in total control of my emotions and everythingelse. I realized suddenly that you can achieve these states ofcontrol, provided that you put yourself in a crisis situation. Andthat's why throughout The Outsider I keep saying the outsider'ssalvation lies in extremes."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm7/16MISHLOVE: You've focused in your writing somewhat on theworks of Gurdjieff, who tended to push people into exaltedstates of consciousness by using a similar method of pushingthem to extremes.WILSON: Yes, well, you see, the basic point about thephilosophy of Gurdjieff, and I suppose about my own basicideas, is this recognition that we have inside us what I call therobot -- a sort of robot valet or servant who does things for you.So you learn something like talking French or driving a car orskiing or whatever, painfully and consciously, step by step. Thenthe robot takes it over and does it far more quickly and efficientlythat you could do it consciously. However, the important thing isnot to interfere with the robot once he's learned it, because youcompletely screw him up if you do. Now, the robot does all thesevaluable things like talking French and so on for us. The troubleis he also does the things we do not want him to do. We listen toa piece of music; it moves us deeply the first time. We read apoem, we go for a country walk, whatever, and it moves us. Butthe second or third time you do it, the robot is listening to themusic or reading the poetry or doing the country walk for you. Isaid I've even caught him making love to my wife. And this is ourreal problem -- that the robot keeps taking us over and doing thethings that we would rather do. Now, Gurdjieff recognized this;he talked about the machine. Gurdjieff, of course, would walkinto, let's say, the dormitory of his students at midnight, snap hisfingers, and everybody had to be out of bed and in somecomplex position within two seconds flat. Obviously he wouldkeep people at a certain level of tension by doing this. Do youremember that Sartre said that during the war, when he was inthe French Resistance and he was likely to be arrested and shot"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm8/16at any moment, he never felt so free. And obviously you wouldin these circumstances -- you keep your energy so high becauseof your sense of crisis, that you would feel far more free. Nowthis is clearly the secret of freedom -- keeping your energy sohigh that the robot is a bit like the thermostat on the wall whichturns on quite automatically when your energies drop below acertain point, and then suddenly, without even noticing it, you'reliving mechanically, robotically, instead of with the real you. Theinteresting thing is that it's only a matter of one degree.Therefore, if it's just one degree to turn on to the robot, it's onlyone degree of effort to turn the robot off.MISHLOVE: You know, I had an experience several months thatthrew me into an exalted state, and I realize that it's very similarto one that you've had and written about. I was riding a bicycleand was hit by a truck. Something like that occurred to you andseemed to have a similar effect.WILSON: Well, I suppose the suicide attempt did produce thiseffect. But you know, ever since then I recognized that theanswer lies in crisis. You see, we feel really alive when we are inwhat you might call \"all systems go\" states. If you can actuallyget yourself into this state where adrenalin is flooding in, whenyou're really intensely concentrating on something, then you feelfully alive. Now, our problem is we're always falling below thatlevel, and what's more, as soon as you place us in a pleasantsituation, where we should be extremely happy in theory,immediately everything drops, and quite suddenly, instead ofbeing happy in the pleasant situation, we're happy for a fewseconds, and then we're bored. You know, the Germanphilosopher Fichte said, \"It is heaven to become free, butactually to be free is nothing.\" And this is true. As soon as we"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm9/16are free permanently, we just relax. To become free, that's themoment when it suddenly becomes heavenly. Clearly then, insome peculiar way, we've got to keep our level up. Now, the wayI would express it is this. Human beings are what you might callabout forty-nine percent real you -- the essence, the free will --and fifty-one percent robot. So the robot slightly alwaysoverbalances the real you. Now, as soon as a crisis occurs, assoon as anything drives you to make a real effort, quite suddenlythe real you rises that extra one percent, and suddenly you arefifty-fifty. And in the fifty-fifty moods -- you know, setting out onholiday; driving along on a spring morning and thinking, my Godisn't it all beautiful -- in the fifty-fifty mood, when you and therobot are perfectly balanced, in crisis situations, in whichsuddenly -- you know, Hans Keller, who used to be head of BBCmusic, said that in Germany in the 1930s, when Jews weredisappearing into concentration camps, and he was Jewish, hesaid, \"Oh my God, if I can just get out of Germany, I swear that Iwould never be unhappy again for the rest of my life.\" You cansee exactly what he meant. It would be so easy to remain happyfor the rest of your life, compared to the prospect of vanishinginto a concentration camp. But what do we actually do? Underthese circumstances, where we think, \"God, if only . . .\" wesuddenly find that normality, pleasantness, puts us into thiscurious robotic state in which we forget everything, and down wego again.MISHLOVE: You've written extensively about the romantic poetsand artists, like Van Gogh, who seemed to experience such anexquisite sense of the life force permeating everything, and suchgreat joy, and then would commit suicide and turn to depths ofdespair."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm10/16WILSON: Well, that was the thing that really started me off onthis whole business. I was fascinated by these romantics of thenineteenth century -- as you say, like Van Gogh, or like Goetheand Schiller and Wordsworth, the early romantic poets, whowould experience these exquisite moods of universalperception, in which everything was self- evidently good, and inwhich everything in the universe seems to be connectedtogether, and then suddenly waking up the next morningthinking, \"My God, what did I mean by it?\" -- the feeling that itwas an illusion, that maybe you'd had a drink too many, orwhatever. So the question I asked myself from the beginning is,how could you determine which was true -- the moods ofintensity, or the suicide note that Van Gogh left saying, \"Miserywill never end\"? The philosophers at the time, when I producedThe Outsider -- people like A.J. Ayre and Gilbert Ryle and so on-- would have said, \"That's a totally meaningless question. Afterall, you feel one thing in one mood, you feel another thing inanother mood. They're just relative.\" Now, I could not believethis, because every time I've experienced these moods ofintensity it's like going to a hilltop and seeing precisely the samevision, exactly the same landscape below you. It must be solid,or it wouldn't be the same every time. It would be different everytime. On the other hand, of course, in what you might call theworm's-eye-view moods, things appear bad in a different wayevery time. You suddenly feel that the truth is these views of theworm's- eye view are subjective and emotional, and it's only thebird's eye views that are true. I've always believed this deeply --it's the big that's true, not the small. In other words, close-upness deprives us of meaning. I have always felt this is thebasic truth of life. Somehow you've got to get that trick of pullingback and seeing things through a kind of wide-angle lens. As"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm11/16soon as you do this, you instantly go into a state of intenseoptimism.MISHLOVE: In other words, for you the small details, themelodramas of our lives that sometimes cause us such despair,aren't as real as the larger picture.WILSON: Well, I think that the main problem is that we have noway of galvanizing ourselves when we are in the low moods.That's the real problem. Now, at this point -- this was two yearsafter I'd written The Outsider -- I came upon this interesting cluein the form of a letter from an American professor of psychologycalled Abraham Maslow, who wrote to say he'd read a book ofmine called The Stature of Man, in which I'd said that I was fedup with the fact that modern literature appears to feel that tellingthe truth means to express defeat and misery, and that any formof conquest is generally regarded as a fantastic lie. Maslow saidthat he got sick of studying sick people because then he talkedabout the sickness, and he instead decided to study thehealthiest people he could find. So he asked among his friends,\"Who's the healthiest person you know?\" And he studied thesehealthy people, and he made this discovery which no one elsehad ever made, because nobody else had studied healthypeople, which was that healthy people have with a fairly greaterfrequency what Maslow called the peak experience -- justbubbling experiences of overwhelming happiness, not mystical,just ordinary happiness. The interesting thing was, his students,as soon as they began talking about peak experiences, wouldsay, \"Ah yes, I remember now,\" and begin to describe someprecise peak experience they'd had in the past. Not only that --and this was the really significant point -- as soon as they begantalking about their peak experiences to another and discussing"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm12/16them all the time, they began having peak experiences all thetime. So in some way, you see, the question of how to create thepeak experience depends upon realizing that this is a norm ofordinary human consciousness. It's a perception. It's not anemotion, it's a perception. You turn your face in that direction,towards the peak experience, and it's like looking at somethingthat gives you pleasure, like a mother looking at her baby. Youjust suddenly bubble over.MISHLOVE: It's as if, if we are willing to acknowledge thepossibility of something greater, we open ourselves up to it, andwe can experience that.WILSON: I think it's more than simply acknowledging thepossibility of something greater. I think that we recognize that inour own depths we possess enormous reserves of strength ofwhich we are normally totally unaware. This is what fascinatesme. This is obviously what happened to the romantics. They justhad these bubbling experiences of power coming up from theirown depths, and were startled by this. And what's moreinteresting, I've noticed again and again when you experience asense of power coming from your own depths, you are likely tofeel that in some way it's coming from the external universe,because it so transforms the universe -- like Van Gogh's visionof the starry night, with all the stars turning into great whirlpoolsof force and the trees looking as if they're flames rising towardthe sky -- it so transforms it that it appears to be an externalvision. Of course all that's happening, so to speak, is that youare glowing with light that transforms the external universe. Soin all the mystics you get this strange thing. They say the innerbecomes the outer, and the outer becomes the inner -- it'scharacteristic of all the mystical experiences, that. And then, as"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm13/16soon as I began to see this, that it is a matter of sort of innerstrength, I became extremely interested in this problem. Thequestion I asked myself was, how then could you create thepeak experience at will? Because obviously, if you want tocompare that with what you might call the depth experience, thedepression, somehow you've got to create them and put themside by side so you can see them side by side, and you seewhich is higher than the other. Well, I talked to Maslow aboutthis, and Maslow said, \"It's impossible. You can't do it. The peakexperience comes when it wants to, and it goes when it wantsto, and there's nothing you can do about it.\" Now, thenineteenth-century romantics had said this. You know, Pushkincompares the poet's heart to a coal which is blown into a redglow by the flame of inspiration and then goes black again, andthere's nothing he can do about it. And yet, I said to Maslow, \"Ina sense, you're contradicting your own basic theory, that thereare higher ceilings of human nature, that we're free.\" That's whatfascinated me so much, this notion that we are actually free --that we get these curious moments in which freedom floods overus with a kind of explosion that suddenly shakes us awake. It'swhat the Buddhists call enlightenment. Whenever it hits you, youget this strange feeling of, \"My God, of course.\" Then of courseyou wake up the next morning saying, \"Of course what?\" So theproblem was to define it precisely, and the only way you coulddo this was by learning, if possible, to create peak experiencesat will, and that was the problem to which I gave myself afterabout 1958 -- how could it be done?MISHLOVE: Many Buddhists would suggest there's a logicalparadox there, because the I, the part of us that wills, is not thepart of us that gets to experience that."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm14/16WILSON: Yes, precisely. That was something I discovered manyyears later -- in the late 1970s, in fact, when of course Isuddenly discovered that we have two I's inside us. I'd knownabout this split-brain psychology for years -- I mean, I'd knownthat the right brain is concerned with pattern recognition and allthe rest of it, the left brain is concerned with logic and languageand mathematics. And it hadn't struck me as terribly interesting.I thought, OK, so what? Then I read this book, The Origin ofConsciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind byJulian Jaynes, in which he explains that if you split somebody'sbrain down the middle, which they do to prevent epilepticattacks, they literally turn into two people. This is what interestedme so much -- that they become two people, and that theperson who actually says \"I\" lives in the left brain. You know,what Jaynes says is if you show a split-brain patient an applewith the left eye and an orange with the right eye, and you say,\"What have you just seen?\" he will reply, \"An orange.\" If you say,\"OK, write with your left hand\" -- which is connected to the rightbrain --\"what you have just seen,\" and you don't let him see it, he willwrite \"Apple.\" You say, \"What have you just written?\" and hereplies, \"Orange.\" If you show him a dirty picture with his rightbrain, he will blush. If you say, \"Why are you blushing?\" he says,\"I don't know.\" So obviously I, I don't know, means that I lives inthe left brain, and that total stranger lives over in the right. Now,you may say, \"But I'm not a split-brain patient.\" On the otherhand, Mozart said that tunes were always walking into his headfully fledged, so he just had to write them down. Now, where didthey come from? Obviously, that other self in the right brain, and"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm15/16they walked into the place where Mozart lived. Now, if Mozartwas a split-brain patient, so are we all.MISHLOVE: We all have two hemispheres, of course, to ourbrains.WILSON: And what's more, they're totally disconnected-- disconnected to such an extent that we're not even aware thatwe have this other person living in the other hemisphere. Now,when I began writing a book about Wilhelm Reich --MISHLOVE: We have just about a minute now, Colin.WILSON: Oh shit -- I realized that in fact these two were exactlythe same as Laurel and Hardy in your movies, and that theperson living in the other hemisphere is in fact Stan Laurel. He'sthe one who sends up all the energy; Ollie is the living you. Andsomehow they're like lumberjacks at either end of a double-handed saw, whose business is to collaborate. If you onceactually get the collaboration of Stan in the other hemisphere,everything is fine.MISHLOVE: So to summarize a very long story here, it wouldseem as if part of the art of rising from the depths of despair tothe heights of peak experience is to develop a kind of workingrelationship between these Laurel and Hardy characters.WILSON: One is totally creative, but unfortunately is so silentthat you don't even know he's there except in your high moods,your intense -- Van Gogh could see his Stan when he waspainting A Starry Night, and soon as you know Stan is really"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"5/4/2020THE HIGH AND THE LOW with COLIN WILSON :: Reader Viewchrome-extension://ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/data/reader/index.html?id=1052&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intuitionnetwork.org%2Ftxt%2Fwilson.htm16/16there, what I'm saying is that he will always support you, alwayssend up these surges of creative energy when you need them.MISHLOVE: Colin Wilson, thank you very much for being withme.
