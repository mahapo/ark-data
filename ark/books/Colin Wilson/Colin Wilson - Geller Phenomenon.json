The title alone was enough to bring agleam of anticipation into the eyes of booksellers—Uri: A Journal of the Mysteryof Uri Geller. Uri Geller was the young Israeli psychic who had achievedovernight fame less than a year before with his remarkable feats of telepathy,and by his even more baffling ability to bend spoons and repair broken watchesby merely touching them. On subsequent trips around Europe and America, he hadbecome a subject of international controversy. And in these days when any bookon an occult subject has a ready market, both the subject and the title ofPuharich’s biography promised a best seller.[../Images/main-7.jpg] Uri Geller, with one of the thousands of keys he has bentduring his spectacular career.In due course, the book made its appearance. But the anticipated rush neverhappened. Puharich had apparently achieved the impossible: he had written a bookthat was so astonishing and unbelievable that nobody wanted to read it. Even thereviews were muted, as if reviewers felt that Puharich had played an unfairtrick. He was known as a respectable scientist; the writer Aldous Huxley haddescribed him as “one of the most brilliant minds in parapsychology”; his bookBeyond Telepathy had become a classic of scientific investigation. Yet contactwith the young Israeli seemed to have destroyed his judgment. He was actuallyasserting that Uri Geller was some kind of divine messenger, an instrument of“the controllers of the universe,” and that the aim of these mysterious entitieswas to bring a new age of peace and prosperity to the earth. Everyone had beenexpecting a book about carefully planned experiments, and perhaps some bold andoriginal theory about psychic energies. All this stuff about spaceships andextraterrestrials was a bit too much.To do Puharich justice, the book was less bizarre than it sounded. If the eventshe described were true, then his conclusions were logical enough, if a trifleincautious. For his story, in brief, was as follows:In 1952, Puharich had been investigating a Hindu scholar who possessedclairvoyant powers. Suddenly, the scholar went into a trance, and proceeded tospeak in a strange voice, with a perfect English accent. The voice describeditself as a representative of “the Nine Principles and Forces,” superhumanintelligences whose aim is to aid human evolution.Four years later, in Mexico, Puharich met a doctor and his wife who had alsobeen in touch with “Space Beings,” through the mouth of a trance medium. Sometime later, this doctor sent Puharich two “messages” he had received from theSpace Beings, who had ordered him to transmit them to Puharich. The messagesstated that they were the same “Nine Principles” who had spoken through theHindu scholar, and that they would be contacting Puharich again in due course.Puharich naturally suspected that the doctor had somehow found out about hisearlier sessions with the Hindu scholar. But this, apparently, was not so.In the 1960s, Puharich became fascinated by the strange feats of the Brazilian“psychic surgeon” Arigo. This man, an ordinary mine worker, had one day goneinto a trance, seized a knife, and performed a surgical operation on a woman whowas dying. The operation—done without anesthetic or sterilization—had beencompletely successful. Arigo set up a surgery and performed hundreds of suchoperations. The operations were usually performed with a rusty kitchen knife,which Arigo wiped on his shirt to clean it. The wounds never turned septic, andthey healed without the help of antibiotics or germicides. There is no record ofany failures. Arigo attributed these astonishing feats to the spirit of a deadGerman surgeon who, he claimed, possessed him while he was in a trance. Puharichvisited Arigo and observed his work, and Arigo successfully removed a tumor fromPuharich’s forearm. But in January 1971, Arigo was killed in a car crash.[../Images/main-8.jpg] Andrija Puharich, American doctor and parapsychologist,who has an established reputation as a sound researcher in the field ofparanormal claims and activities. He was the first international figure to takea scientific interest in Geller’s achievements.Puharich was stricken with guilt, feeling that he should have devoted all histime to investigating this remarkable man while he was still alive.At the time Arigo was killed, Puharich had already read a report about a youngIsraeli with incredible powers, including the ability to move the hands of awatch without touching it, and to cause a ring—held by someone else—to snap,merely by cupping his hands around the person’s hand. Puharich resolved thatthis time he would not fail. He wrote to Uri Geller in Israel and went to seehim. In due course, he brought Geller to America. One day, when Geller was in alight hypnotic trance, a strange metallic voice speaking from the air identifieditself as some kind of superhuman (or nonhuman) entity, and went on to explainthat “they” had chosen Geller to be an instrument of their purpose. In latercommunications, the Space Beings identified themselves as the Nine—of whomPuharich had heard for the first time some 20 years earlier—and explained thatthey existed in another dimension, outside space and time, and had been watchingthe human race for some thousands of years. At present, they were in a“starship” called Spectra somewhere out in space. They were connected with thephenomena we know as “flying saucers” or UFOs. Their ultimate purpose was tosave man from destroying himself, and to bring world peace.1 [../Images/1.jpg] Jose Arigo, the Brazilian psychic surgeon, who died in 1971.His sudden death was a great blow to Puharich, who was overwhelmed with a senseof lost opportunities. He resolved that should he ever find another equallygifted psychic he would not fail again.The metallic voice was not, apparently, the real voice of the Space Being; itwas created electronically. Puharich tape-recorded it, but the tapes were alwaysmysteriously wiped. Photographs of UFOs taken by Geller and Puharich failed todevelop, or vanished. But the extraterrestrials periodically proved their powersby such feats as stopping a car engine and restarting it, and transportingPuharich’s briefcase from America to Israel.No wonder the critics were baffled, astonished, and in some cases outraged. Thesimplest hypotheses were that Puharich had gone insane, or was telling lies. Atypical review, by D. Scott Rogo, a writer on psychic phenomena, pointed outthat Puharich expects the reader to take his word for all kinds of absurditieswithout offering evidence for a single one of them. The vanishing photographsand tape messages were really rather convenient, Rogo observed. As to the claimthat Uri had been chosen as the unique “messenger” of these Space Beings, it canbe undermined by simply glancing at the list of books by “contactees”—people whoclaim to have been inside flying saucers or to have spoken to their inhabitants.There is not a single claim in the whole book, says Rogo, that can stand up toserious examination.All of which is obviously true. Yet it apparently solves one problem only toleave another just as baffling. If Puharich is a liar, why is he such a badliar? If he wanted to advance Geller’s claims as the world’s most extraordinarypsychic, all he had to do was to write a detailed account of the experiments hehad carried out under controlled conditions. Some of these—such as the abilityto dematerialize small animals and transport them to other places—wereastounding enough on their own. The stuff about Spectra simply isn’t necessary.And even if Puharich was cunning enough to anticipate this reaction and hopethat people would mistake his lack of solid evidence for honesty, the book stillwouldn’t advance Geller’s case—as, in fact, it didn’t.Besides, Puharich’s integrity as an investigator of the paranormal had alreadybeen proved by his remarkable first book, The Sacred Mushroom. In it, hedescribes his investigations of a young Dutch sculptor named Harry Stone, whoperiodically went into trances, spoke ancient Egyptian, and wrote Egyptianhieroglyphs. The “trance personality” who spoke through Stone claimed to be anEgyptian of the Fourth Dynasty named Ra Ho Tep. Puharich spent three yearsstudying the ancient Egyptian language and hieroglyphs and diligently trying tofind some historical record of the original Ra Ho Tep. His summing-up of theevidence about Harry Stone is a model of scientific caution and lucidity,demonstrating that he understood—and thoroughly accepted—the scientist’sobligation to be tough-minded. The same quality is apparent in his book BeyondTelepathy, in which, after citing many cases of telepathy, apparitions, and“astral travel” (the experience of being outside one’s body), he calls upon theaid of modern physics and mathematics to attempt to establish the existence of“psi plasma.” He explains how this psi plasma (which the layman could translateas “mind stuff’) can operate between human minds to produce psychic phenomena.No one who has read these two books could believe for one moment that Puharichis secretly a cranky “occultist” masquerading as a scientist.[NOT PICTURED] Geller with Puharich. In 1971 Puharich came to Israel to find outmore about Geller, whose fame was beginning to spread outside his own country.He was greatly impressed, and persuaded him to cooperate with scientificresearch into his strange powers.All of which leaves us with the disturbing question: Could Puharich be right?Are there really “super beings” who have been observing our earth for thousandsof years, and who have chosen Uri Geller as a “transmitter” because hisbiological make-up happens to be appropriate? Or could there be some otherexplanation of the mystery that we have not so far considered?Before we examine these questions more fully, let us turn our attention to thecareer of the man at the heart of the controversy: Uri Geller.Geller is a Hungarian name, and Uri’s parents, Itzhaak and Margaret, had fledfrom Hungary shortly before the Second World War. They succeeded in reachingPalestine (now Israel) in 1940. Itzhaak Geller joined the British Army, andfought against Rommel’s forces in North Africa. Uri was born on December 20,1946, in Tel Aviv. His parents’ marriage began to break up when his father fellin love with another woman.When I questioned Uri about the origin of his powers, he mentioned an incidentto which he attached little importance—so little that he had not even botheredto mention it to other interviewers. His mother had a sewing machine, which hada small hole through which he could see a tiny blue spark. One day, when he wasfive years old, he tried to touch the spark with his finger; the shock threw himbackward violently.[../Images/main-10.jpg] Geller’s mother and father, in a picture taken shortlyafter their wedding in Hungary in 1938. Uri with his mother, when he was abouttwo years old. By this time, in 1948, his parents had escaped separately fromthe Nazis and made their way to Israel.Oddly enough, his powers began to manifest themselves at about this time. Hediscovered one day that he could read his mother’s mind. When she came back fromplaying cards with friends, he suddenly knew precisely how much money she hadlost. She was astounded when he named the exact figure. He also noticed that hewould often start to say things at the same moment that she did. This kind ofthing is not, of course, unusual. Many married couples have the same experienceof telepathic contact, and it is not uncommon between parents and youngchildren. (When my own children were babies, I could wake them up merely bythinking about them.)The tangible phenomena began when he was six. His father had given him a watch.One day, in class, he noticed that it was half an hour fast. There was nothingvery odd about that; he put it right. When it happened several more times, hedecided there was something wrong with the watch. When left at home, it behavedperfectly. Then one day he placed it in front of him on the desk and saw thatthe hands were going around much too fast. Deciding it was faulty, he persuadedhis parents to buy him another, but its hands somehow bent upward so that theypressed against the glass; it was ruined. Some time later, as he sat in classwithout a watch, the boy sitting next to him remarked: “My watch just moved onan hour.” In a mischievous mood, Uri said, “I did that.” He took the watch,concentrated on it, and somehow made the hands move ahead. Uri gained areputation among his schoolfriends.Then the spoon bending began. One day while he was eating soup, the bowl of thespoon fell off the handle. In a coffee shop that he sometimes frequented withhis mother, the spoons began bending although he was not touching them. Hisfather thought of taking him to see a psychiatrist, but later dropped the idea.That may be a pity. An open-minded psychiatrist would have recognized that thesephenomena could be due to some paranormal forces. (Of course, he would firsthave had to satisfy himself that Uri was not faking the occurrences to getattention.) And if the psychiatrist had any kind of interest in the paranormalphenomena, he might also have decided that they were worth investigating. By1955 (when the spoon bending started), it was common knowledge that so-called“poltergeist” phenomena are often caused spontaneously by emotionally disturbedchildren and adolescents.Uri’s home life was certainly insecure at this time—his father was alwaysdisappearing with the “other woman.” So poltergeist phenomena would have been asensible hypothesis. Uri’s strange powers might have been investigated some 15years before they came to the attention of Andrija Puharich. Whether this wouldhave shed any more light on them than we have at the moment is a matter forspeculation.[../Images/main-12.jpg] Geller at school in Nicosia, Cyprus, in 1963. He was nowattending a Roman Catholic school on a hill overlooking the city. At the schoolhe discovered he could use his telepathic powers deliberately: once he summonedhelp when he was lost, and often he read the mind of a more clever pupil duringclass examinations.When his parents finally divorced, Uri was sent to a kibbutz near Tel Aviv. Hewas lonely there, and was glad when his mother got married again—this time to aHungarian pianist—and told him they were all moving to Cyprus. There, as inIsrael, Uri was again surrounded by war: the conflict between Greek and TurkishCypriots. In Cyprus he used his powers deliberately for the first time. In thefamily’s garage was a bicycle that his stepfather had promised him as a BarMitzvah present. It was secured by a combination lock. Uri was eager to try thebicycle, so one day he concentrated hard on the lock and willed it to open.After several attempts, it suddenly gave way. Having obtained his present, theboy taught himself to ride.One day Uri’s stepfather had a heart attack. Unaware of this, Uri experienced anodd compulsion to go to the hospital, and actually found his way to the roomwhere his mother sat beside his stepfather’s bed. We may surmise that he hadbeen “guided in” telepathically by his mother. The telepathic link between themwas as strong as ever; he tells how, when she was in an auto accident in Haifa,he knew about it at the moment it happened, although he was himself in Tel Avivand several hours elapsed before he was able to verify it.[../Images/main-13.jpg] Geller with his father in 1967. At that time Uri was aparatrooper, and his father was a sergeant major in the Tank Corps. Geller’sparachute being checked by the instructor before he made a night jump.In Cyprus, Uri was sent to a Roman Catholic school, which he disliked. While hewas there an incident occurred that suggested he could send, as well as receive,telepathic messages. In defiance of school rules, the boys used to explore thedeep caves in the hills near the school. One day Uri ventured too far into acave and lost his way. He sat down in the dark and prayed. An hour later, heheard a bark. The family dog had come out from Nicosia, 10 miles away, and foundits way through the cave to Uri. They played together for a while, and then thedog led him safely out of the cave.Uri soon discovered that his telepathic faculties were useful in exams. He onlyhad to stare at the back of the head of a clever pupil to see the answers toquestions. (He describes the sensation as being like a television screen insidehis own head.) Teachers suspected him of cheating, because he got the otherpupil’s mistakes as well as his correct answers, and they moved Uri to a distantcorner of the room. Distance made no difference; he still got the answers—andthe mistakes. The teachers may have begun to suspect that something strange wasgoing on when Uri began bending keys and mending watches by resting his hand onthem. Years later, one of them, Mrs. Julie Agrotis, wrote a letter to theBritish newspaper News of the World, confirming that Uri’s spoon-bending featshad already begun while he was at school. The period at the Catholic school cameto an end when his stepfather died of a heart attack.It was while he was in Cyprus that Uri became involved with the IsraeliIntelligence Service. He discovered that a friend named Joav was an Israeli spy.Joav agreed to let the boy help by serving as a courier there in Nicosia. Thiswork came to an end when Uri’s family returned to Tel Aviv. Uri went into theIsraeli Army as a paratrooper to do his military service. It was while onmaneuvers with the paras that he had his strangest experience up to that time.It was his job to carry a heavy Browning machine gun. Because he had noexpectation of using it on the first day of maneuvers, he decided to leavebehind the heavy parts of the gun, including the barrel and firing pin. Then,unexpectedly, they were ordered to open fire on an imaginary enemy. Thinkingquickly, Uri placed a small gun beside the stripped-down Browning and hoped thatno one would notice that the big gun was not working. But when he pressed thetrigger of the small gun, both guns started firing. An officer congratulated himon his shooting. The Browning was surrounded by its empty cartridge cases. Ithad fired without a barrel or firing pin.In 1967 war broke out between Israel and Egypt—the Six Day War. Uri had apremonition that he would be badly hurt, but not killed. It proved to becorrect: he was injured by a grenade, and his arms, legs, and forehead werepeppered with shrapnel. While he was recuperating, he was offered a job in achildren’s holiday camp near Tel Aviv. There he met a boy called Shipi, who wasto become one of his closest friends. Shipi persuaded him to put on ademonstration of his powers, for a fee, at his school. It was Uri’s first publicperformance. It lasted for two hours and included his now familiar feats of mindreading, watch repairing, and spoon bending. It was a great success.2 [../Images/2.jpg] Uri with one of his friends who was wounded near him in theSix Day War in 1967. He sensed beforehand that he would be injured himself, butfortunately his own injuries were not serious.When he came out of the Army, in 1968, Uri continued giving shows while he triedto make up his mind what to do with his future. One day it dawned on him that hecould make a living by continuing with his demonstrations. Soon he wassufficiently well known to be signed on by a professional manager. And here hemade his first crucial mistake: he allowed the manager to persuade him to cheat.Of course, in the context of professional stage magic it was not cheating to useperfectly normal means to discover, for example, the license plate number ofsomebody’s car, and then to pretend to have discovered it by mind reading. Butfor someone claiming genuine psychic powers, to resort to occasional trickerycan seriously undermine his reputation if he is found out.Around this time, Uri’s life began to go sour. An appearance in Rome proved aflop. There was a small scandal about a composite photograph of Uri with SophiaLoren. The photo had been faked by a photographer who had not been allowed totake a picture when Uri visited the film star in Italy. Although Uri had nothingto do with organizing the deception, it created a bad impression.In 1970, Uri met an Israeli psychical researcher named Itzhaak Bentov, whoworked in America. For Bentov, he demonstrated his ability to break metal—inthis case, a pin—while it was held in someone else’s hand. Bentov sent the twobroken halves of the pin to Andrija Puharich in America. As a result, Puharichcame to Israel to meet Geller. It was to be a turning point in Uri’s career.Puharich met Uri Geller in a Jaffa discotheque on August 17, 1971. After beingintroduced, Puharich sat in the audience, and listened to a succession of popsingers, clowns, and comedians. Geller then came on stage—the youthful audiencecheering wildly—and announced that he would attempt to demonstrate telepathy andpsychokinesis. The telepathy consisted of the usual mind-reading act: Geller wasblindfolded, and then accurately “guessed” various words written on a blackboardby members of the audience. After this, he broke a ring held in a woman’s handby cupping his own hands around hers. Puharich later admitted thinking at thetime that the effects were probably produced by trickery.But a series of tests in Puharich’s own private apartment the following day ledhim to change his opinion. Geller wrote a number on a sheet of paper, then askedPuharich to think of three figures. When Puharich had done so, he was shown thepaper: Geller had written the same three figures before Puharich thought ofthem. He had apparently made Puharich think of them by transmitting themtelepathically. During this and subsequent sessions, Geller performed otherfeats under Puharich’s close observation. He started a watch that haddeliberately been allowed to run down—without touching it—and caused a weddingring to crack while it was being held in someone else’s clenched hand.[../Images/main-15.jpg] After the war and his army service, Uri began to do somelecture demonstrations of his powers.

Later he used this picture forthe official autograph photo he sends out to his fans.Now Puharich was totally convinced that Geller’s gift was no fake. In the firstof a series of tests involving scientific instruments, Geller raised the mercuryin a thermometer six to eight degrees Fahrenheit apparently by willing it torise, while the mercury in a second thermometer nearby remained unaffected.[../Images/main-19.jpg][../Images/main-20.jpg][../Images/main-22.jpg] An earlyGeller stage performance in Geneva, Switzerland. Skeptics and believers alikeagree that Geller is a natural showman. He wrote himself of his very firstperformance, at a school, that he “was fascinated with the reaction of theaudience and gratified by the interest of both teachers and children.” Thatfirst show, like this one in Geneva, was an immediate and complete success.Asked by Puharich if he had any theory that might explain his powers, Urisuggested that perhaps telepathy acts at a greater speed than light—which,according to Einstein, is the maximum attainable speed in our universe—and thatthis might explain how the laws of nature were apparently being broken. He alsohazarded the guess that he might be the descendant of “space men” who possessedgreat powers and who landed on earth a long time ago. Von Daniken’s Chariots ofthe Gods? had been published in English some two years before, not long afterthe release of Stanley Kubrick’s well-known film 2001: A Space Odyssey; and sothe idea was very much in the air at the time.The most extraordinary session took place on December 1, 1971. This was theoccasion when the computer-like voice spoke from the air. But before thishappened, Geller was placed in a hypnotic trance, and asked a number ofquestions about his childhood. He spoke in Hebrew (because he had not learnedEnglish until he moved to Cyprus), and described his early years in Tel Aviv.And then, suddenly, he told an extraordinary story. At the age of three, he hadgone into a garden opposite his home. In the sky above his head, he noticed abright, bowl-shaped object. There was a high-pitched ringing sound in the air.The light came down closer, dazzling him, so that he fell to the ground and lostconsciousness.Puharich quotes two versions of this story in his book Uri; in both of them, hementions that some kind of figure, with a shining face, appeared in front of thechild, and that a ray of light emanating from its head knocked Uri to theground. In Geller’s own version, in his autobiography My Story, there was nomysterious figure. The child was simply dazzled by the light of the bowl, andfelt as if he had been knocked over backward. This version certainly sounds lessincredible than the one Puharich relates.It was after Geller had told his story of the garden, on tape, that the metallicvoice issued from the air, explaining that “we” (the Nine) had found Uri in thegarden when he was three (Puharich gives the exact date—December 25, 1949), anddecided that his biological make-up was suitable for their purposes: that is, hewas a suitable “receiving station” for the powers they would transmit throughhim. “We reveal ourselves because we believe that man may be on the threshold ofa world war. Plans for war have been made by Egypt, and if Israel loses, thewhole world will explode into war.”[../Images/main-25.jpg] In Germany in 1972. His new manager suggested that Urimight try a few spectacular experiments, to give his series of lecturedemonstrations a good launching in the press with a lot of publicity. One suchstunt was to try to stop this escalator in a large Munich department store. Uriand his party traveled on the store’s escalator for about 20 trips before theescalator stopped dead—as much to Geller’s surprise as to anyone else’s.When Uri awoke from his hypnotic trance, the tape was played back to him. Herecalled nothing of what had taken place, and when his own voice related thegarden episode, he commented: “I don’t remember any of this.” When the metallicvoice started, Geller reached out, removed the cassette from the recorder,paused for a moment with the cassette in his hand, then rushed out of the room.Puharich says that the tape vanished as Geller’s hand closed over it. He wasfound later standing in an empty elevator, apparently in a state of shock. Thetape was not recovered.This was the first of a series of strange events that give Puharich’s book thequality of a surrealistic nightmare. There were more messages from “theNine”—although the tapes were found to be wiped blank when they were played backlater. Sometimes the cassette recorder itself “spoke,” with the recording keydepressed by some invisible force, but nothing was heard on the tape when it wasplayed back. In the desert, in an army jeep (Uri had been entertaining troops),Puharich and Geller saw a red light that they took to be a flying saucer; thesoldiers driving the jeep saw nothing. An army cap that one of the soldiers hadleft on his bed appeared on Puharich’s head. A ballpoint pen with an especiallynumbered cartridge was placed in a sealed box, and when the box was opened a fewminutes later, the cartridge had vanished from the pen. Soon afterward, Gellerexperienced an urge to take Puharich to a suburb of Tel Aviv at night; therethey saw a “ball of pulsating bluish-white light” on a deserted lot.[../Images/main-24.jpg] Geller with the cable car outside Munich that stoppedafter he had been concentrating on it. Again, this was a publicity stuntsuggested by a newspaperman, and Geller had not been at all sure that he wouldbe able to do it.Geller approached it, seemed to go into a kind of trance, and returned holdingthe cartridge from the ballpoint pen.In February 1972, Puharich was about to leave Israel for Rome when IsraeliIntelligence officers insisted on searching him. They confiscated various films,books, and letters. It seemed that they were convinced Puharich was some kind ofsuperspy. (This incident may have been related to Uri’s former spy-ringconnections.) On his arrival in Rome, Puharich contacted New York and heard thatpeople were saying he had gone insane, and that Geller was his evil genius.Puharich decided it was time to relax for a while; he found a remote hotel ontop of a mountain pass, and began to write his book about Uri Geller.Meanwhile, back in Israel, Uri accepted an offer to appear in Germany. The manwho arranged the tour understood the value of publicity; when Uri and his friendShipi arrived, they were met by crowds of reporters and batteries of cameras. AMunich newspaper ran a six-part series about him. In answer to his manager’splea that he try something spectacular, Uri apparently stopped a cable car onthe side of a mountain and an escalator in a Munich department store. It ispossible that both these events were coincidence—both the escalator and thecable car had worked for some time before his efforts to stop them had anyeffect. And skeptics were not slow to point out that the newspaper in questionhad a certain interest in the project, and that a bribe of a few hundred markscould have stopped the escalator and the cable car as effectively as Geller’ssupposed supernormal powers. This time, the controversy did Uri no harm. By thetime he returned to Israel, and prepared to take off again for America, for aseries of controlled tests, he was well on his way to becoming the most famous“psychic” in the world.[../Images/main-27.jpg] Barbara Scheid, a German housewife, sitting with 53pieces of silver that had been tidily wrapped in cloth and put away in a drawerduring Uri’s first TV appearance in Germany.

The decisive eventwas his appearance on November 23, 1973 on a British Broadcasting Corporationtelevision program, the “David Dimbleby Talk-In.” Also present in the studiowere John Taylor, a physicist and professor of mathematics at London University,and biologist Lyall Watson, whose book Supernature was on the best seller lists.Geller was not entirely unknown in Britain. Word had circulated of tests thathad been conducted on him at the Stanford Research Institute in Californiaearlier the same year, and on several nationwide TV programs, including the JackPaar show, that he had appeared on. But for some reason Geller’s feats had notgenerated much excitement in the United States. Perhaps the profusion oftelevision stations—as contrasted with the three channels available in mostparts of Britain—siphoned off a large proportion of viewers. Or perhaps thepresentation of his talents on the American shows was relatively unconvincing.Such attention as he did attract tended to be unfavorable. Time magazine, forexample, denounced him as a cheat. So the American tour had been anything but anunalloyed success.[../Images/main-29.jpg] Geller’s most spectacular success came in Britain, wherehe appeared on a BBC-TV program, the “David Dimbleby Talk-In,” a show that dealtwith miscellaneous topics in a studio format with an audience present. Oneprogram was devoted to Geller, who astonished them. In a telepathy experiment, asailboat was a target drawing. Below it is Geller’s reproduction.The Dimbleby program changed all that. On the table in the BBC studio werevarious articles, mostly spoons and watches. Geller was handed a sealedenvelope, which contained a drawing that had been made immediately before theprogram. Geller closed his eyes, concentrated on the envelope, and then made adrawing on a sketchpad of a child’s sailboat. The envelope was opened and thedrawing found to be practically identical to the one Geller had made. Next,David Dimbleby held a fork in his hand, his fingers around its thinnest point,where the handle joins the base. Geller stroked it gently without, apparently,applying any pressure. Within 30 seconds, the fork had begun to bend. Uri laterpointed out that another fork that had remained on the table had begun to bendof its own accord. He took watches that had ceased to work, rubbed them gently,and made them start again. Lyall Watson’s own watch stopped during thisperformance. But what probably impressed the audience—and the twoscientists—most was that the hands of one of the watches were found to have bentupward so that they pressed on the glass. If this was a conjuring trick—as someof the audience believed—it was difficult to see how he had tampered with asealed watch.One member of the audience stood up and said that he would be convinced ifGeller could bend a stout metal bar, which he offered to bring onto theplatform. Uri declined, explaining that although he could do it, it would takeso long that the program would be over before he succeeded.The producer of the program came on to say that they had received dozens oftelephone calls from people who said that their own cutlery had been bendingwhile they watched the program or that long-inert watches and clocks hadstarted.The next morning, Uri was famous. I had missed the program, but someone told meabout it before the morning was over. There could be no doubt that the successhad surpassed everyone’s expectations, including Geller’s. On the previousevening, Geller had performed similar feats on a radio program; but then hearingis not the same thing as seeing. Everyone who had watched the “David DimblebyTalk-In” felt they had personal proof that Geller was genuine. And they wantedto know how he did it. Not next year or next month, but instantly. And becauseno one knew the answer, it was discussed in pubs, bingo halls, and bowlingalleys all over the country. Stage magicians dismissed it scornfully as sleightof hand; one journalist stated authoritatively that he had supervised thepreparation of a chemical that would cause metal to crumble and bend, but laterhad to retract his rash statement. The science editor of the Sunday Times, BrianSilcock, described how he had accompanied Uri in a taxi to Heathrow Airport, andoffered him his own front door key. As soon as Uri began to stroke it, it bent,so that it was later unusable. Silcock, who had been a skeptic, admitted that hewas converted.[../Images/main-31.jpg] Geller with Dimbleby. In this experiment, Dimbleby helda key ring and key in his palm, and Geller placed his hand over it.[../Images/main-34.jpg] Then Geller took the key ring from Dimbleby and held itin plain view, and the key slowly bent before their eyes.[../Images/main-35.jpg] Above: Dimbleby with his key, now rendered completelyuseless. Below: while Geller and Dimbleby were experimenting with the key,London journalist Rosamund Mann was looking on with fascination. (She can beseen in the picture above, next to Dimbleby.) Abruptly, with no warning, a linkof her bracelet shattered, and the gold-leaf chain slipped to the floor,surprising all those present. [../Images/main-37.jpg] One of the many cartoonsthat have appeared about Uri. This one, by Mac, came out at the time of hisLondon success. The caption to it read, “So I said to this guy Uri back there,‘Okay, Smarty-pants, what else can you do, apart from bend spoons?’ ”When the news of Geller’s British triumph reached the United States, theAmericans were puzzled and intrigued. Although seemingly more skeptical than theBritish on Geller’s first appearance, they could not help being impressed oncehe had achieved success abroad. When he returned to the States—and to theanxious scrutiny of Andrija Puharich—Geller found that his rather dubiousnotoriety had changed into celebrity.Meanwhile, in England Geller’s fame continued to grow in his absence. There wereextraordinary reports that during his broadcasts large numbers of the BBC’stransmission devices ceased to function. A mass-circulation newspaper, theSunday People, cashed in on the publicity to organize an experiment at shortnotice: at half past noon on the Sunday following his Friday-evening Dimblebybroadcast, Uri was to concentrate on England (he was at Orly Airport, nearParis, at the time) and order as many spoons as possible to bend. The People’svast readership was asked to cooperate by keeping a careful eye on all cutleryand clocks at this time. The results, published in the following week’s edition,included nearly 300 forks and spoons bending and more than 1000 watches orclocks restarting.[../Images/main-36.jpg] Geller with a paper knife at Heathrow Airport, as he wasleaving London in 1973. Just before this he had impressed the previouslyskeptical Sunday Times science editor, Brian Silcock, by managing to bend thejournalist’s own front door key.But by far the most significant thing about the British success was thatscientists took Geller seriously. If he could really read minds and bend spoons,then it ought to be possible to study these phenomena in the laboratory. Ofcourse, Geller had already been tested in America; but that was by scientistsspecializing in parapsychology. In England, scientists in more orthodox fields,such as Professor John Taylor and Dr. Ted Bastin, both mathematicians, wanted totest Uri in their own laboratories. When the Stanford Institute’s report finallyappeared, it was in the British journal Nature, possibly the most highlyregarded scientific journal in the world.While the publicity continued, and the arguments grew acrimonious, the cause ofall the uproar made his way around the world in a leisurely fashion, pausing inScandinavia, Spain, Italy, and Japan to demonstrate his powers. In Oslo, Gellerhad just remarked to a reporter that sometimes his psychic energies caused thelights to fuse when suddenly all the street lamps went out. While at sea in theMediterranean, Geller jokingly asked a few friends to help him to concentrate onstopping the ship. A few minutes later, it slowed down, then stopped. A crimpedfuel pipe was later discovered to be the cause. As in the case of the Munichescalator and cable car, both of these curious events could have beencoincidental. But they made such excellent copy that journalists had nohesitation in writing about them as attested examples of Uri’s psychic powers.Inevitably, the reaction began to set in. Geller himself was undoubtedly shockedand dismayed by it. He found it incomprehensible that he should arouse suchviolent hostility in people who had never set eyes on him. He remarks, in MyStory: “I tried not to be on the defensive all the time, but it was sometimeshard.”Yet Geller himself, with his own obsession with fame, should have understood thehostility. It was the normal working of the anti-success mechanism. In ourovercrowded modern world a hit record, a best-selling book, a successful film,can reach more people in a week than Shakespeare or Beethoven reached in a wholelifetime. And so fame has become the most romantic, the most desirable of allcommodities, the dream for which a modern Faust might sell his soul to theDevil. Once attained, fame is never as easy to hold on to as most peoplebelieve. The people who achieve fame by some accident of fashion are usuallyforgotten within a week; the ones who remain on top have to work to stay there.But few people understand this. The result is that anyone who achieves suddennotoriety arouses envy and hostility. The greater the success, the greater thereaction. Uri was no longer merely the favorite of some Israeli teenagers in aTel Aviv discotheque; everything he did now reached an audience of millions. Thereaction, when it came, would be on the same scale.And because America is more success-conscious than most countries, it wasinevitable that it should happen there first. In fact, the first shots hadalready been fired in that country some six months before Geller went toEngland. Time magazine had asked Geller to come to the office for an interview.Also present at the interview were the magician James Randi (“the AmazingRandi”) and Charles Reynolds, editor of Popular Photography and himself anamateur conjurer. Puharich describes the atmosphere as being that of a kangaroocourt. In these hostile surroundings, Geller’s psychic powers worked badly; histelepathy demonstrations were fairly successful, but attempts to bend a key anda fork produced little. The Time story, which appeared in the second week ofMarch 1973, was a scathing, all-out attack on Geller. It stated that Ray Hyman,a professor of psychology from Oregon, “caught Geller in some outrightdeceptions.” These, apparently, were as follows:[../Images/main-41.jpg] Geller with Merv Griffin on his talk show in July 1973.On this show everything worked. With Johnny Carson, perhaps because Geller wasexcited and the results were not so good. [../Images/main-40.jpg] Geller duringan impressive 90-minute performance on television in Finland, following hisLondon success with Dimbleby. [../Images/main-42.jpg] Early in 1974 Uri was inNorway, giving another demonstration of his spoon-bending prowess. Herescientist Per Kofstad holds a spoon that Geller touches. [../Images/main-43.jpg]The spoon snaps in two.Geller asked George Lawrence, US Department of Defense consultant, to think of anumber between one and 10 and to write it down, as large as possible, on anotepad. The notepad, of course, was turned away from Geller. But, says the Timereport, Hyman was able to observe Geller peeking through his fingers, so that hewas able “to see the motion of Lawrence’s arm as he wrote,” and thus correctlyguess the number. The other “deception” was practiced when Geller deflected acompass needle by five degrees; Lawrence concluded that it had been done bycausing the floor to vibrate, and he repeated the demonstration, causing theneedle to deflect even more than five degrees.Anyone who thinks that one’s arm moves while writing a number on a notepadshould try the experiment. In fact, of course, only the hand moves, and thatwould be hidden behind the pad. Randi, too, later accused Geller of peeking, butasserted that Geller had guessed the number correctly by watching the movementof the pencil top over the notepad, which is just one degree more plausible thanthe moving-arm theory, but hardly convincing. In any case, neither of the twoexamples cited above actually amounts to catching Geller in “outrightdeceptions.”The article goes on to describe how Geller had come to the offices of Time-Lifeto demonstrate his powers and adds that after he left, “Randi ... duplicatedeach of his feats, explaining that any magician could perform them.” Later, bothRandi and Charles Reynolds were to claim that they actually saw Uri bending afork by pressing it on the tabletop. For some reason, Time omits this importantpiece of “evidence,” although it is hard to see why. After all, if they hoped tocatch Geller cheating, and Randi actually did catch him, they had every reasonto publicize the discovery. The article concludes with the assertion that Gellerleft Israel in disgrace after a computer expert and some psychologistsduplicated his feats and called him a fraud. This statement is factually untrue;Geller left Israel to perform in Germany, then to take part in research atStanford; there was no disgrace and no exposure.When Geller returned to America early in 1974, his world triumphs behind him,the onslaught began in earnest. Leading the anti-Geller battalions were the twoveterans of the previous campaign, Randi and Charles Reynolds. Randi seizedevery opportunity to denounce Geller as a fraud, and began preparing a bookexposing his “tricks.” As the editor of Popular Photography, Reynolds hadreacted with indignation to a report that had appeared on the front page of theBritish newspaper The News of the World, describing how Uri had takenphotographs of himself with the lens cap taped over the camera lens. Now thiswas encroaching on Reynolds’ own special field. In the mid-1960s, a Chicagobellhop named Ted Serios had aroused widespread attention by his apparentability to take “mental photographs.” Serios would hold a small cardboard tubeover the camera lens, stare into it with intense concentration, and press thebutton. When developed, the film sometimes revealed images of buildings,vehicles, even people. Reynolds was convinced that Serios achieved his effectsby trickery, and in 1967 he and an associate published an article in PopularPhotography asserting that they had worked out how it was done. According tothem, it merely involved palming a color transparency and inserting it into thecardboard tube. As an explanation it was highly plausible—the single objectionbeing that every investigator of Serios had already thought of it, and hadtherefore examined his cardboard tube before and after the experiments. In spiteof this, American magicians continued to refer to Reynolds’ “exposure” of TedSerios.[../Images/main-44.jpg] James Randi, a magician who bills himself in his showsas the “Amazing Randi.” A longtime anti-Geller campaigner, Randi claims he canduplicate Geller’s effects.Now Uri was making the same kind of claim, and Reynolds once again prepared todo battle. A former Life photographer, Seth Joel, provided him with theammunition he needed. Joel spent a day with Uri, and he described it in anarticle. Uri had taken Joel’s Pentax camera, its lens cap taped on tightly, andpressed the camera against his forehead, trying to transmit the picture of aneagle onto the film. Then he suggested that they try a little mind reading, andasked Joel and his assistant to go into the next room and make a drawing. Withanother camera (the Pentax being in the room with Geller) Joel photographed hisassistant making the drawing, which was of a chair. The drawing was put in anenvelope, and then into an outer envelope, and taken to Geller. Uri concentratedon the sealed double envelope, seized a pencil, and did an accurate sketch ofthe chair. After this, he pressed the Pentax against his forehead and tried morepsychic photography.Later, in the developing room, most of the film was found to be blank. But oneexposure did contain a blurred image. It showed part of a man’s chin and hissweater; most of the picture was covered with a black blot.[../Images/main-45.jpg] The News of the World experiments, with Geller trying tophotograph himself with a camera that has the lens cap still in position. Theyused the photographer’s own Nikon F.At first, Joel had no doubt that Uri had succeeded in photographing himselfthrough the covered lens. But when he called in at the Time-Life Building, thechief photographer shook his head. His verdict was that someone had tried totake a picture with the lens cap partly covering the lens. Other photographersagreed. And so, on reflection, did Joel. What had happened, he concluded, wasthat Uri had partly untaped the lens cap while they were in the next room, andtaken a shot of himself.4 [../Images/4.jpg] Two rolls of film—which Geller never touched—came out blank.In the middle of the third roll were these two pictures.Joel’s photograph, together with an article describing the visit, was publishedin the June 1974 issue of Popular Photography. In the same issue, CharlesReynolds returned to the attack with a long article in which he described theTime office episode of the previous year, and asserted that both he and Randihad observed Uri bending a spoon with his hands and bending a latch key bypressing it against a tabletop. He continued with an analysis of the sessionwith Yale Joel, admitting that Geller had succeeded in various mind-readingfeats, including “reading” a message in a sealed envelope that had been writtenby Joel’s son before the session. On the “psychic photography,” however, it wasdefinitely thumbs down. The article concluded with an outline of Puharich’s bookon Geller—which is, admittedly, enough to make the most ardent believer shudderwith embarrassment.5 [../Images/5.jpg] Ted Serios and Uri Geller both attempted to produce mentalphotographs: but whereas Serios produced views by staring into a camera lens,Geller produced a picture of himself through a lens cap. A Serios“thoughtograph” of Munich’s Frauenkirche (right).Reading Joel’s article, and looking at the “psychic photograph,” theunprejudiced observer has to admit that it looks as if Uri tried cheating. Atthe same time, there are a few things to be said for the defense. Reynolds wasalready committed to an anti-Geller position when he (presumably) sent Joel tospend the day with Geller. The Time editors, who pointed out the deception, werealso anti-Geller; and Joel had been a photographer for Time-Life. If Joel wasthere to observe Geller critically, why didn’t he count how many pictures Gellersnapped before he and his assistant left the room, and again when he returned?It is the kind of thing you would expect a good journalist to do as secondnature. If he had made a count, he could have stated with total conviction thatthe “fake” photograph must have been taken while he was out of the room. Whydidn’t he? And what about the mind reading? Was that genuine, or was Gellerpeeping through the keyhole as well as untaping the camera lens?This is the problem that one encounters again and again in connection withGeller. Skeptics can frequently make a fairly convincing case for someparticular incident of cheating; but they usually have to admit that half adozen other matters remain unexplained. In March 1974, Time magazine renewed itsattack—not merely on Geller, but on the whole psychic scene.[../Images/main-48.jpg] Serios producing a thoughtograph. When about to shoot,Eisenbud writes, Serios went into a state of intense concentration, ending withan explosive burst of energy at the camera.Charles Reynolds was quoted as saying that many agnostics still cling to abelief in black magic, “only now it’s called the paranormal.” Kirlianphotography, ESP research, out-of-the-body experiences, “the secret life ofplants,” psychic surgery, and Geller’s spoon bending were all dismissed as ifthey were equally preposterous. An insert called “A Long History of Hoaxes”contained one of the famous “fairy” photographs taken by two English girls andpublished in Conan Doyle’s The Coming of the Fairies; Ted Serios grimacing at acamera; and some of Professor J. B. Rhine’s assistants at the parapsychologylaboratory at Duke University. The section includes, inevitably, the story ofCharles Reynolds’ “exposure” of Ted Serios and seems to imply that Serios wascaught cheating.The weakness of the attack lies in its lack of discrimination. It is possiblethat psychic surgery is a hoax, that plants cannot really read our minds, thatKirlian photography (photographing the “life-aura” of living creatures) maydepend on some simple electrical phenomenon. But to lump all these together asif they were all on the same level of improbability shows a certain lack ofdiscernment. The same applies to the list of “hoaxes.” Rhine’s careful researchinto extrasensory perception at Duke University is generally conceded to beserious and sincere, even by people who think his test conditions were tooloose. The famous fairy photographs are quite probably a hoax, but no one hasever produced an atom of proof either way, and until someone does, no one can bequite as confident as the editors of Time seem to be. And Ted Serios has neverat any time been exposed as a fraud—although obviously he might be. We see herea phenomenon that we shall encounter again in relation to Geller: that when ascientist or a “rationalist” sets himself up as the defender of reason, he oftentreats logic with a disrespect that makes one wonder which side he is on.[../Images/main-50.jpg] Geller’s “through the lens cap” picture produced withYale Joel’s Pentax. Originally impressed by the picture, Joel came to think Urihad partly untaped the lens cap while Joel was briefly out of the room onanother experiment. [../Images/main-49.jpg] A picture of Seth Joel thatresembles the Geller photo. But the Seth Joel picture was taken with the lenscap held partly away from the camera, as shown here. They later found that oneperson could do it alone. 7 [../Images/7.jpg] Geller with Seth Joel in amind-reading experiment. If the lens cap photography was slightly suspect duringthe session with the Joels, Geller’s other demonstrations were highlysuccessful. 6 [../Images/6.jpg] Geller with his mother and yet another bentspoon, in a picture taken by Seth Joel during the same session. Geller’smetal-bending power and mind-reading abilities were not disputed by Joel.In contrast to the other parts of the Time article, the attack on Geller isoddly restrained. It does, however, repeat the assertion that a certainProfessor Hyman caught him in some “outright deceptions,” without specifyingwhat these were. The writer adds that Geller canceled a British tour “after agroup of British magicians made plans to catch him in the act ... citingmysterious death threats.” In My Story, Geller explains that he canceled theBritish tour because there had been assassination attempts on prominent Jews,and he had received death threats from Arab terrorist organizations. Anyone wholived in England at the time can verify that there were several assassinationattempts, by both Arab and Israeli terrorists, and that Geller’s fears were notentirely imaginary.But by far the strangest item in this issue of Time is the letter from theeditor on the contents page. Ralph P. Davidson admits there that his Los Angelescorrespondent had submitted his fingertips to Kirlian photography and wasinterested to see that the developed film showed “blotchy, whorled or spiky‘coronas’ that corresponded to his different emotional states.” In the weekbefore publication, the alarm clock of editor Leon Jaroff—who was responsiblefor the article—failed to go off on three occasions, making him late for work.“Even more bizarre was the mysterious force that glitched Time’s complexcomputerized copy-processing system on closing night—on almost the precisemoment that our psychic phenomena story was fed into it. Against astronomicalodds, both of the machines that print out Time’s copy stopped workingsimultaneously. No sooner were the spirits exorcized and the machines back inoperation than the IBM computer in effect swallowed the entire cover story; itdeveloped a flaw in its programing that sent the copy circling endlessly throughmemory loops from which it could not be retrieved.”And so, once again, it sounds rather as if Geller had somehow managed to havethe last word.Future generations are going to find it difficult to understand the bitternessand violence of some of the attacks on Geller. They may conclude that they arepart of the malice and envy of the “anti-success mechanism.” This would be lessthan fair. The blunt truth is that, whatever his strange powers, Uri is not theideal ambassador for the psychic world. Both hostile and friendly observers havemade the same observation: that the center of Uri’s universe is Uri himself. Indirect personal contact with people he likes, his chief characteristics aresincerity and enthusiasm. In front of reporters or TV cameras, he moves into ahigher gear and produces an impression of flamboyant egotism. Martin Ebon, aneditor of books on the occult who is basically pro-Geller, observes wryly: “Bycontrast [with Puharich] Uri Geller is crudely two-dimensional. His drive andegocentricity are that of a rock star; he thrives on the kind ofadulation—preferably perpetual—that usually surrounds amplified guitars andvoices. Whatever conversation he has circles like a plane caught in an airportapproach pattern, around himself and his feats ... ”It is true that in his public persona Uri projects a certain modest charm. Thetrouble is that his self-absorption tends to overrule this, so that aself-congratulatory tone keeps leaking through. Anyone who knows him recognizesthis as an amplified version of his boyishness and sincerity; but the overallimpression can be unfortunate. The following piece of dialogue from his secondappearance, in 1974, on the Jimmy Young Show (BBC Radio) illustrates the point.YOUNG: “How do you react, Uri, to the comments of some scientists that yourfeats of telepathy are probably phoney?”URI (expansively): “Look, Jimmy, I want to be quite honest with you. I have apress conference tomorrow and I want to have as many things to tell to the presswhich I don’t want to say openly here and now. You know, people tell me, don’tsay this, don’t say that ... So let me just say ... because tomorrow I want togo into very deep detail about it to the press ... [Jimmy Young interrupts topoint out that he is at present reaching about 8,000,000 people.] Well, anyhow,Jimmy, the thing is that with all this controversy going on around me, and allthese accusations of silly things ... I mean, people heard of bugs planted in meand so on ... But look Jimmy, this earth is built of two kinds of people, thosewho believe and those who don’t believe, and I’m not going to challenge thosewho don’t believe. I have very little sympathy for them. If you don’t believe,it’s your own problem ... ”[../Images/main-52.jpg] Geller with Jimmy Young in November 1973, on the BBCradio show that started his remarkable London demonstrations.[../Images/main-53.jpg] Jimmy Young with the key that Geller bent on theprogram.What he actually says is reasonable enough, but the way he says it is at onceirritating and embarrassing. The emphasis on press conferences, with itsconnotation of a politician about to make some important announcement, and onthe thousands of people who are now discussing him suggests delusions ofgrandeur. And his implicit disparagement of the Jimmy Young Show, while a gueston that program, is certainly tactless.In September 1975, I appeared on the BBC’s Monday morning program Start the Weekalong with Uri, and television personalities Richard Baker, Esther Rantzen, andothers. I had been invited because I was known to believe that Uri’s powers aregenuine; everyone else in the studio made it plain they thought he was a fake.As I listened to Uri describing how he had been walking along in New York City,and then had suddenly been “teleported” 36 miles away, to come crashing througha screen in the house of Andrija Puharich in Ossining, New York, I feltconsiderable sympathy. Uri knew perfectly well they were all I thinking “bloodyliar.” A moment later, Richard Baker asked Uri whether he had not claimed to bean instrument of beings from outer space, the Nine. Uri replied: “No, you’re notquoting from my book. You see, there are so many books written about me.” Igroaned inwardly and shook my head. As far as I knew at that point the only bookabout him was Puharich’s, although Ebon’s symposium was on its way. A fewmoments later Uri repeated his claim: “You see, there are so many books writtenabout me that everybody misinterprets me ... I’ve been called a fraud, acharlatan, I’ve been called a messiah from God and all that ... Now I do notbelieve that beings from outer space are watching me ... I do not rule that outeither ... I don’t know.”Once again it struck me that if, as Ebon implies, Uri is his own greatestadmirer, he is also his own worst enemy. I don’t doubt that he was doing hisbest to answer their questions honestly, fully aware of the general atmosphereof skepticism; but what he appeared to be saying was: “Someone as fascinatingand many-sided as myself must expect to be misunderstood. Of course, I don’tthink I’m God but some of my followers do, and I could be wrong ... ” At thispoint, I felt an urgent desire to take him aside and whisper in his ear thecritic James Agate’s remark: “The British instinctively admire any man who hasno talent and is modest about it.”[../Images/main-55.jpg] George Porter was one of the listeners to the JimmyYoung Show that November day.

And it mustbe admitted that the results have been, on the whole, rather disappointing. Itis not that the psychics have failed to produce the results. On the contrary,some of the phenomena have been spectacular: accordions played by invisiblehands, tables rising off the floor in broad daylight, flowers appearing out ofthe air—one medium apparently materialized a six-foot golden lily, complete withplant pot. But the basic rule for a scientific experiment is that it should berepeatable. And the basic trouble with psychical phenomena is that they seem tobe as temperamental as opera singers; they perform seemingly according to whim,and cannot be pinned down to a schedule. Again and again, individualinvestigators have “proved” the reality of telepathy, psychokinesis, secondsight, and the power to foretell the future. And still nobody is absolutelyconvinced—least of all, the scientists themselves.[../Images/main-59.jpg] Geller’s finger at rest. [../Images/main-60.jpg] AKirlian photo of Geller’s finger sending a burst of energy during one of hisdemonstrations.This is why psychical researchers rub their hands with delight whenever a reallygifted psychic appears—someone who seems able to call upon his powers at will.In the whole history of psychical research, there have been fewer than a dozensuch people. As soon as Puharich heard reports of Uri Geller’s powers, herealized that this could be the breakthrough everyone had been seeking. Ofcourse, it was just as likely that Geller was simply a clever trickster—morelikely, in fact, because there are more con men in the world than miracleworkers. Therefore, his first task was to check Geller—to the best of his ownability—and then to get him into a well-equipped laboratory.As we have seen, it took Puharich only one hour to decide that Geller’stelepathy was genuine. Some of the “debunkers” have used this as evidence thatPuharich was credulous and overtrustful. But it is difficult to see how thischarge can be sustained. Geller wrote something on a pad, placed it facedownward on a table, then told Puharich to think of three numbers. When Puharichpicked up the pad, his three numbers had already been written on it. Fewexperiments would be harder to fake.The same applies to Puharich’s thermometer experiment, conducted the followingday. It may sound easy enough for a stage magician to raise the temperature of athermometer by trickery, particularly if he is allowed to handle it or breatheon it. But it is difficult to see how this could be done if the thermometer wason the other side of the room, as Puharich alleges.Puharich’s next move was to speak to astronaut Ed Mitchell, the sixth man toland on the moon. On his 1971 moon flight Mitchell performed an experiment intelepathy, attempting to transmit a series of numbers to four friends on earth.The result was astonishing: not because the number of hits was high, but becauseit was incredibly low—far below what would have been expected by chance. Youmight compare this result to someone who overhears a conversation in a foreignlanguage of which he knows a few words, and gets a completely mistakenimpression of what it is all about. But he could get such a mistaken impressiononly if he partly understood the language. Ed Mitchell’s friends obviously“overheard” something, which they proceeded to get all wrong. This wasintriguing enough to make Mitchell decide to persist in his investigations intothe paranormal. When he left the army, he set up an Institute of NoeticSciences—that is, studies relating to the intellect. Its aim was to try toinvestigate the ways in which people can use their psychic energies.[../Images/main-62.jpg] Mitchell on the moon. While on the moon flight, Mitchelltried some unauthorized experiments with telepathy, trying to transmit a seriesof numbers to friends on earth. The results intrigued him enough to involve himfull time in a study of psychic energies after he resigned from the spaceprogram. [../Images/main-63.jpg] Geller with the former astronaut Ed Mitchell.The two met early in Geller’s first trip to the United States in 1972, andMitchell was instrumental in getting Uri tested by scientists. 8[../Images/8.jpg] A photo Uri Geller took out of the window of a jet travelingbetween England and Germany. Uri took the picture when his camera levitated infront of him—at that time he could not see anything in the sky. It was only whenthe film was developed that these images of UFOs flying alongside the jetappeared.Geller arrived in the United States for the first time in August 1972; he stayedat Puharich’s house in Ossining, New York. Ed Mitchell came, together with Dr.Gerald Feinberg of the Physics Department of Columbia University, and a numberof other scientists. Uri demonstrated his powers; he caused the hands of a watchto move, and broke a steel ring and a sewing needle. Both Mitchell and Feinbergwere convinced. Mitchell was so impressed that he offered to put up the cash topay for further investigation of Uri’s powers at the Stanford ResearchInstitute, at Menlo Park, California—an independent organization, not connectedwith Stanford University.Mitchell was eager to get the opinion of his friend Wernher von Braun, thefamous rocket scientist, who is a vice-president of a large industrialcorporation in Germantown, Maryland. Von Braun’s attitude, like that of mostscientists, was distinctly skeptical, but Geller’s demonstrations soon had himconvinced. Von Braun held his wedding ring in his own hand, without allowingGeller to touch it. Geller held his own hand near von Braun’s—without touchingit; the ring slowly bent into an oval shape. Later, as Geller and Puharich wereabout to leave, von Braun discovered that his pocket electronic calculator wasnot operating, although it had a new battery. Uri took it in his hands for amoment and concentrated. The battery then began to work, but the calculatoritself seemed to have gone haywire. After another 30 seconds of hardconcentrating, Uri succeeded in making it operate normally. Understandably, vonBraun was convinced that Geller’s powers were genuine.[../Images/main-65.jpg] Sketches by BOAC pilot Captain J. R. Howard in 1954 of aformation of UFOs that flew parallel to his Stratocruiser for more than 80 mileson a trans-atlantic flight. The sketches formed part of his voyage report. Hesaid that there were six small black objects and a larger “flying jellyfish”that appeared to change shape constantly. Many of the 51 passengers aboard lateradmitted they had also seen the formation in the sky on the flight. Uri’sexperience of seeing UFOs from a plane was not the first.During all this time, according to his book Uri, Puharich was still in contactwith his “extraterrestrial intelligences.” Two days before the von Braundemonstration, the tape recorder held a conversation with Puharich, in Uri’spresence, in which it explained that the Space Beings were planning to land onthe earth within the next year or two—they declined to specify exactly when—andtold Puharich to write a comprehensive book on “the UFO experience.” They alsoexplained that a sudden petulant outburst from Uri the day before, on thesubject of a documentary film script, had been inspired by them. Shortly afterthis, the tape recorder again talked to Puharich, explaining that he would soonbe “on his own,” and implying that they would shortly cease to communicate. Afew days later, the same voice told Puharich that Uri was not to go toCalifornia for the Stanford research. Understandably, Puharich was bewilderedand furious, and decided to ignore the voice. Uri himself became furious whenPuharich told him that, whatever happened, the Stanford project had to go ahead,and he threw a sugar bowl at Puharich. Puharich, in his own words, “cursed thegods,” which apparently provoked an instant storm that rocked the house. Duringthe storm a grandfather clock in the hall shot across the floor and virtuallyexploded.This preposterous incident may seem to have no place in an account of thelaboratory investigations of Uri’s powers. In fact, it could well offer a vitalclue. To begin with, the disembodied voice sounds highly knowledgeable aboutscience and mathematics, although most of its communications seem to be sheergobbledegook. For example:THE VOICE: “Don’t you see an ashtray and a key appeared right now?”PUHARICH: “Yes, I did.”THE VOICE: “To your own timeless situation, that means to you there is time. Itlooks like it happened right now, spontaneously, immediately, straightforward.But that is wrong. For us, that was planned hundreds, hundreds of light-yearsago, Andrija ... ”Now, as anyone with even the most amateurish interest in astronomy knows, alight-year is not a measurement of time; it is the amount of space a beam oflight could travel in a year. Interestingly, this is a mistake that Uri himselftends to make.Again, the English of the voice is oddly colloquial and ungrammatical: “rightnow,” “spontaneously, immediately, straightforward,” as they are used in thatfragment, suggest Uri’s own idiosyncratic English. And the comment “To your owntimeless situation, that means to you there is time” also sounds curiously likeUri.[../Images/main-67.jpg] Geller with John Lennon, of Beatles fame, talking abouttheir mutual interest in UFOs. [../Images/main-68.jpg] Russell Targ, a laserphysicist with a continuing interest in psychic phenomena. He joined theStanford Research Institute (which does research on a vast range of subjects,both military and commercial) in 1972, when the Geller tests began there.[../Images/main-69.jpg] Dr. Hal Puthoff, also a laser physicist, who came to SRIin 1971, primarily to do psychic research. He holds various patents on laser andother optical devices.Finally, there is the extraordinary nature of the communication itself: thesuggestion that the whole Stanford project should be dropped. If the SpaceBeings really were eager to establish Uri as a messenger, they would surely wanthim to be tested by scientists. This sudden objection is a little too abrupt tomake sense.Yet we know, from what Puharich says, that Uri was doubtful about the scientificexperiments from the beginning. Ed Mitchell noticed the same thing about him.And Uri’s reaction when Puharich said they ought to go ahead anyway—hurling asugar bowl at him—was uncharacteristically violent.The obvious conclusion would seem to be that Uri planted the messages on thetape recorder, taking advantage of Puharich’s belief in beings from outer space.But if that is so, how did the tape recorder reply to Puharich’s questions? Forit seems clear from Puharich’s book that the conversation was reasonablyspontaneous. And how did Uri raise a storm and cause a grandfather clock tosmash?This last question is one that must be explored at length later on. All thatneed be said here is that if the freak storm and the smashing of the clock werenot due to natural causes, they may have been engineered by Uri himself—perhapsunconsciously. In the field of psychical research, such manifestations arelumped together under the term “poltergeist activity.” The word poltergeist,meaning “noisy ghost,” covers a multitude of peculiar phenomena, seeminglycaused by some mischievous spirit. It will throw things, move heavy objects,even cause fires. Most parapsychologists now agree that a poltergeist is not areal ghost, but some kind of unconscious manifestation of a living person,usually a disturbed child or adolescent. The person at the center of thedisturbance is seldom consciously aware that he or she is responsible.Puharich’s book makes it clear that all kinds of poltergeist activities tookplace in Uri’s presence; objects would fall from the air or suddenly“dematerialize” and appear in another place. So when we learn that Geller wasextremely reluctant to go to Stanford, it becomes clear why the voice suddenlyordered Puharich to cancel the trip—and why Uri was so furious when Puharichdeclined.As it happened, Uri’s apprehension was groundless. During the next few months,he took part in two series of experiments at Stanford, under the supervision oftwo physicists, Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ. The results seemed to proveconclusively that whatever the nature of Geller’s powers, they were undoubtedlygenuine.What Puthoff and Targ thought about Uri is another matter. The first thing hetold them, when they met at San Francisco Airport on November 11, 1972, was thathis powers came from beings in outer space. Puharich was shocked and alarmed,because the voice had sworn them both to silence. Later, as they sat around atable, Uri asked for silence, explaining that he was waiting for a sign. Thebell of an automatic test machine suddenly rang, although there was no reasonfor it to do so. A copper ring was compressed into the shape of a dumbbell, andthen apparently fell through the table and onto the floor underneath. Thisconvinced Puharich that the Space Beings had no objection to Uri’s revelationsabout them. Uri asked for one more sign. He asked to look at a chain-braceletworn by Hal Puthoff, then asked Puthoff to hold it in his own hand. Heconcentrated for a moment; when Puthoff looked at the bracelet again, it wasbroken, and one link was missing.[../Images/main-70.jpg] TARGET [../Images/main-71.jpg] RESPONSETwo of the most successful from the second series of SRI informationtransmission tests. For this series Geller was shielded from the experimentermaking the drawing, in a special room in which he was wholly isolated. Onlyafter Geller was in this room was the target chosen and drawn. Note that Gellerduplicated exactly the right number of grapes. [NOT PICTURED] Geller during oneof the SRI tests. The envelope he holds contains the target drawing.On Monday November 13, the series of laboratory experiments began. First of all,Targ and Puthoff tried an experiment with which another psychic, Ingo Swann, hadbeen successful a few months earlier. A magnetometer—specifically a Bellgauss-meter—was protected by a superconducting shield, and Uri then attempted todeflect the needle by moving his hands near it. The shield’s function was toeliminate the possibility of Uri moving the needle by concealing magnets in hissleeve. As Geller concentrated, there was a clear deflection of the needle. Theeffort obviously exhausted him.The next day’s work was altogether less successful from the scientific point ofview, but included some interesting effects. Uri concentrated on trying to benda brass ring out of shape. Meanwhile he was being filmed, and an x-ray of hishand was visible on a television monitor. When he concentrated, there was adistortion of the picture on the monitor. Moreover, a computer on the floorbelow began to go wrong, and continued to malfunction as long as Uri was beingtested. On the other hand, the brass ring showed only a slight change of shape.When Ed Mitchell, who was present, later reported on this first series ofexperiments, he omitted all mention of this one, suggesting that neither he northe others were convinced by the metal bending, or at least regarded it asscientifically unproved.Tests in ESP, however, were spectacularly successful. A die was placed in aclosed box, which was then vigorously shaken by Targ or Puthoff. The box wasplaced on a table, and Geller had to call out which side of the die he thoughtuppermost. The box was then opened to check his guess. Geller scored eight outof eight.Eight aluminum film cans were placed in a row, and an assistant placed somesmall object inside one of them, choosing the container at random. Then Gellerwas allowed to enter the room, together with the scientists. He was not allowedto touch the cans, but had to guess which were empty. As he pointed to thepresumably empty cans these were removed, until finally he would indicate thecan he believed to contain the hidden object. The experiment was tried 14 times,and Geller was correct 12 times. On the other two occasions, he declined toanswer; in these trials the hidden objects were a paper-wrapped ball bearing anda sugar cube. In the successful experiments, the hidden objects were unwrappedball bearings, magnets, and cups containing water. (Geller claims that his powercomes from metal and that it is easier for him to bend a spoon or fork if he canplace it against a metal plate or radiator.)In another experiment, a laboratory balance was placed under a bell jar, with atiny weight—one gram—on one of its pans. Uri then concentrated on trying todepress the empty pan. The recording needle of the balance showed that someforce had been applied to the empty pan—many times greater than could have beencaused naturally by rocking the table or vibrating the bell jar.[../Images/main-72.jpg] Geller with Targ, who looks on as Uri draws the face ofthe die concealed in the metal box.But the experiments that impressed the scientists most were those demonstratingUri’s feats of mind reading. Some drawings had been made on cards before Uriarrived at Stanford. The scientists did not see the drawings—which were done byassistants—so it would be impossible for Uri to learn anything from them. Thecards were sealed in double envelopes. Immediately before the experiment, thescientists would take an envelope from the safe, open it, then take the drawinginto the next room, where Uri was waiting. The drawings Uri made were almostexact reproductions of the “target” pictures.The question that intrigued Targ and Puthoff was how far Geller was usingtelepathy (mind-to-mind communication), as opposed to clairvoyance (extrasensoryperception of objects or events). Obviously, telepathy was out of the questionin the die experiments, because nobody knew which way the die had fallen. But adrawing, though in itself an object, has been done by a person, who conceivablycould transmit it telepathically to the subject. In the second series of tests,conducted a few weeks later, the scientists deliberately made conditions moredifficult. After Geller had successfully reproduced a number of drawings underthe same conditions as before, the experimenters devised a method that wouldalmost eliminate the possibility of telepathy. One hundred drawings were made byvarious people in the building and placed in sealed envelopes. Twenty of thesewere selected at random, and Geller was asked to try to draw them, one after theother. This time he failed, saying that the pool of 100 target drawings was toolarge and confusing. On each of three days he made a dozen drawings that he feltto be associated with the pool; only two out of the 12 looked at all like any ofthe day’s 20 targets. He achieved moderate success only on the third day, whentwo of his drawings were close replicas of two of that day’s targets. All thisseems to suggest that, where the duplication of drawings is concerned, Gellerrelies on mind reading.On the other hand, when drawings were made on the face of a cathode ray tube, orstored in a computer’s memory, Geller’s response was more accurate. This doesnot prove, of course, that he could read a computer’s memory; but it suggeststhat he could read the minds of the scientists involved.[../Images/main-73.jpg] Electrodes being attached to Geller’s head to monitorhis brain waves during the second series of SRI tests. This was a procedure thatGeller found he disliked. [NOT PICTURED] Puthoff watches Geller try to influencea weight under a bell jar. Geller wrote that he had been frightened by the ideaof the experiments, but was put at ease and reassured by the informal atmosphereof the lab. [../Images/main-74.jpg] Dr. David Davies, editor of the Britishmagazine Nature, which published the report of Targ and Puthoff on their manyexperiments with Geller in 1974.Two years later, on October 18, 1974, the results of this second set ofexperiments were finally published in Nature, the highly regarded scientificjournal. Targ and Puthoff were determined to bring their research to theattention of the scientific community. The newspaper publicity that followedpublication had a distinctly negative tone—the anti-Geller reaction had beengaining force since his English triumph in 1973. The skeptics pointed out thatTarg and Puthoff were significantly silent about Geller’s metal-bendingactivities. Few of them acknowledged the truly remarkable nature of the evidencefor ESP, particularly telepathy. And as usual, the magicians alleged that thewhole thing had been done by trickery.Yet, by the time the Nature report appeared, a number of English scientists hadbecome totally convinced of the reality of Geller’s powers and had no hesitationabout publishing their findings.Ever since he had appeared on the Dimbleby TV program with Geller, ProfessorJohn Taylor of London University had been eager to test Uri in his laboratory.The first tests were conducted on February 2, 1974. Taylor knew enough about theStanford research to know that Puthoff and Targ had been unable to validateGeller’s ability to bend metal. This was not because they had not tried. Thetrouble was that Uri could bend spoons only by stroking them with his finger,and Puthoff and Targ realized that this was far from scientifically foolproof.Taylor decided that this problem could be overcome. Among the objects hegathered for testing was an aluminum strip sealed into a glass tube—by meltingthe glass—so that there was no way of getting at the metal without breaking thetube. He also worked out a simple device that would actually measure thepressure Uri was applying to anything he stroked. Some pieces of metal were alsosealed into tubes made of wire mesh—perhaps in deference to Geller’s belief thatmetal increases his power. Of course, a wire mesh tube can be bent by hand; butin that case it would show the marks of manual pressure.The first test was a failure; Geller tried to bend a strip of metal withouttouching it, and failed completely. Another strip of metal lying on a nearbytray was found to be bent after the experiment; but that, of course, couldhardly be admitted as evidence, because Geller could have bent it when he wasnot being observed.[../Images/main-76.jpg] More of the target pictures and Geller’s responsesduring the SRI tests. The results suggested that Geller relies more on mindreading than on perception of the object itself to duplicate the drawings: hisresults were much better when there was a possibility of mind-to-mindcommunication.Next, Taylor held a spoon by its bowl, while Geller stroked the stem. After onlya few seconds, the thin part of the stem seemed to become soft; then it broke intwo. The metal seemed to harden instantly. Taylor had been able to observethroughout that almost no pressure was being applied to the spoon by Uri.After two or three more inconclusive experiments, it was observed that one ofthe strips of metal in a wire mesh tube had been bent. The tube itself showed nosign of having been tampered with, and Taylor was convinced that Geller wouldhave had no opportunity anyway.The most impressive experiment in that session was with a Geiger counter, adevice for measuring atomic radiation. By intense concentration, holding it inhis hands, Uri succeeded in deflecting the needle. The characteristic “chatter”of the Geiger counter, amplified by a loudspeaker, rose to a kind of wail,suggesting the presence of dangerous radioactive material. As soon as Urirelaxed, the wail stopped. He did this three times, on one occasion causing the“chatter” to rise to a high-pitched scream as a machine registered 1000 countsper second. The background radiation of an ordinary room is about two counts persecond.[../Images/25.jpg] John Taylor, a professor of mathematics at London University,who tested Geller in London. 9 [../Images/9.jpg] The wire mesh tubes used inJohn Taylor’s experiments to shield some metal bars, which Geller stillsucceeded in bending. 10 [../Images/10.jpg] Metal rods encased within sealedplastic tubes, which nonetheless were bent by Geller, although he could nottouch them. [../Images/main-79.jpg] Uri trying to influence a Geiger counter atthe Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Livermore, California, not far from SRI.In a second series of experiments, in June 1974, Taylor measured exactly howmuch pressure was applied to a strip of metal to bend it. A brass strip wastaped across a fine balance, so that any pressure on the strip was measured onthe dial. Geller gently rubbed the strip, the pointer revealing that he neverapplied more than half an ounce of pressure; nevertheless, the strip was soonbent by 10 degrees. What was rather more astonishing was that the pointer itselfbent at an angle of 70 degrees, although Geller had not touched this at all.The piece de resistance of Taylor’s apparatus was a small metal cylinder thatgenerated an electric current when its end was pressed, measuring the exactdegree of pressure. This was embedded in an aluminum strip, and Uri was asked tobend the strip by rubbing it. After a few moments, the strip began to bend; butthe especially constructed cylinder suddenly ceased to register. Taylor took itin his hand and peered at it. As he looked, a tiny hole appeared in the centerof the sensitive end, and then suddenly the end crumbled away. As Taylorremarked: “The Geller effect had been validated, but at the cost of £200-worthof apparatus.” The metal strip continued to bend for the next three minutes.A crystal inside a plastic container was broken as Geller held his hands overit; Taylor could see the gap between the hands and the container. An aluminumdisk inside another plastic container was bent the same way, this time withTaylor holding his hands between Geller’s hands and the container.An attempt to bend a copper strip without touching it was apparentlyunsuccessful, although the strip was found to be bent some minutes later, whenthey were engaged in another experiment. And at this point, poltergeistphenomena began to occur. A piece of brass on the other side of the laboratorybent of its own accord, then flew the length of the laboratory, falling near thedoor. A piece of copper followed it. Then a plastic tube containing an iron rodjumped off a nearby table and struck Taylor’s legs; when they examined it, theydiscovered that the iron rod had been bent so that it touched both sides of thetube.Finally, Geller influenced a compass, making its needle move by moving his handsover it, a trick that most magicians accomplish by concealing a magnet in thesleeve. But Geller allayed this suspicion by turning the force on and off atwill while his hands continued to move over the compass.It is hardly surprising, then, that John Taylor allowed himself to be totallyconvinced of Geller’s powers. But he was not the first British scientist to beconvinced; that distinction should probably go to Cambridge mathematician Dr.Ted Bastin, who traveled to America early in 1973, before the Dimbleby show, toobserve Geller in Philadelphia. Bastin had then observed most of the “Gellereffects” at first hand—although not under test conditions. But what impressedhim most was the disappearance of a plastic box of screwdrivers from a table,and its reappearance in another room, with all the screwdrivers broken. Bastinsent the screwdrivers for testing to a metallurgist colleague, Dr. Chilton, atCambridge. What he wanted to know, presumably, was whether the fractures hadoccurred through ordinary bending—for example, by pressing the screwdriversagainst a table. Dr. Chilton examined the fractures under a microscope, and hadto admit that he was puzzled; they were not of any type he had seen before, andwere certainly not due to ordinary bending with fingers and thumbs. There were,in fact, several different types of fracture—including an area that looked as ifit had been subjected to intense heat.On June 21, 1974, soon after the second series of experiments in John Taylor’slaboratory, Geller went along to the laboratory of the physics department atBirkbeck College, London, to confront a distinguished gathering that includedthe writer Arthur Koestler, Professor John Hasted (professor of experimentalphysics at Birkbeck), Professor David Bohm (theoretical physics), Ted Bastin,Keith Birkinshaw, theoretical physicist Jack Sarfatt, and psychical researcherBrendan O’Regan. At this session Geller repeated feats he had already performedfor John Taylor: he bent metal (in this case, door keys), caused a Geigercounter to chatter furiously, and bent an aluminum disk in a plastic container.In this experiment Sarfatt’s hand was between Geller’s and the container asGeller concentrated.The following day, those present included Koestler, Arthur C. Clarke (thescience fiction writer), A. V. Cleaver (former Rockets director of Rolls Royce),and the pianist Byron Janis. Geller duplicated a drawing made by Koestler, andagain influenced the Geiger counter. This time, Koestler had an electricalsensation as Geller influenced the sounds from the Geiger counter.One of the most impressive experiments, from a scientific point of view, tookplace with Hasted, Bohm, and Bastin on September 10 of the same year. A numberof small objects, including two pieces of vanadium foil from an electronmicroscope, were sealed in plastic tubes about one centimeter long. One of thescientists covered the various objects loosely with his hand; Geller placed hisown hand on top of this. One of the small capsules was seen to leap like ajumping bean. When this capsule was examined, they could see that part of thevanadium foil was missing. Subsequent examination indicated that Geller haddematerialized a part of the foil while it was still sealed in the capsule.It was also at this session that one of the scientists—the report does notspecify which one—took the two halves of a broken spoon from Geller’s hand, anddiscovered that the broken metal was still plastic and soft—a phenomenon thatJohn Taylor had also observed. This seems to suggest that Geller’s spoon bendinginvolves some kind of temporary softening of the metal, yet without the heatthat would accompany melting. Hostile magicians had frequently suggested thatGeller used some kind of chemical to cause the effect. But laboratoryexamination of the broken metal has proved conclusively on several occasionsthat no chemical change had taken place in the metal.All these tests had taken place before the publication of the Stanford report inNature so it might have seemed that Geller—and his defenders—were fighting onfairly secure ground. But in the field of research into the paranormal, thingsare never as simple as that. To begin with, Professor Taylor had complicated theissue by investigating in his laboratory a number of children who werereportedly able to bend metal by rubbing it. It was a reasonable thing forTaylor to do, because all Geller’s demonstrations on radio or TV were followedby dozens of telephone calls from people who claimed that their spoons had bentor that broken watches had started to work. Taylor dismissed the idea thatGeller might be indirectly responsible for these effects (assuming that theywere genuine). It seemed an altogether more reasonable assumption that hesomehow “triggered” the power in other people, giving them confidence that theycould do it too.[NOT PICTURED] Photograph of the fractured surface of a spoon broken by Geller’sgentle stroking during his tests with Taylor.

[../Images/main-82.jpg] Taylor’s ingenious aluminum strip witha pressure sensor set into it so that it could measure the extent of pressureexerted on it. When Geller took it, he did make it bend, but thepressure-sensitive diaphragm crumbled and disintegrated in 10 seconds.[../Images/main-83.jpg] In other Taylor experiments, Geller shattered thesecrystals without touching them, and distorted the aluminum disks—originallyperfectly circular—by holding his hands over them.Taylor therefore invited a number of young children to his laboratory, and askedthem to bend strips of metal and plastic. The results, although not asspectacular as in Geller’s case, were fairly startling. Taylor’s book Superminds(1975) has an interesting assortment of photographs of spoons, forks, andplastic strips bent by children.But bent spoons and forks are, by their very nature, unconvincing, because eventhe least skeptical person is likely to suspect that only manual force wasinvolved. This aspect of Taylor’s work came in for strong criticism fromscientists, particularly when Taylor admitted that some of the bending occurredwhile he was in the next room. Taylor defended himself by speaking of what hecalled “the shyness effect”—the fact that bending often occurs when skepticalobservers are looking the other way—which provoked the inevitable sarcasticguffaws from his critics. It cannot be denied that Professor Taylor did his casemore harm than good by trying to extend it to include other metal benders.[../Images/main-84.jpg] Taylor watches as Geller attempts to bend a metal stripattached to a scale that measures the pressure applied. At no time did Geller’sfingers apply more than half an ounce of pressure. [NOT PICTURED] the scaleafter the experiment. The metal strip bent, but upward, against the pressure ofhis fingers. Note that the needle of the scale itself also bent.Immediately after Geller’s original appearance on the Dimbleby TV show, The NewScientist, the best of Britain’s popular scientific journals, carried aneditorial recommending that Geller should be studied by scientists. The sameopinion was repeated periodically in its pages during the next six months or so.But on October 17, 1974, the day before Nature published the Stanford report, itbecame clear that the editor had experienced a change of heart, or at least asensible desire to hedge his bets. No less than 16 pages were devoted to aninvestigation entitled “Uri Geller and Science,” most of it written by Dr.Joseph Hanlon, a physicist selected by The New Scientist to investigate Geller.Uri had originally agreed to be examined by a New Scientist panel that wouldhave included Dr. Hanlon and Dr. Christopher Evans, both of whom were inclinedto accept the word of British magicians that Geller was basically a cleverconjurer and no more. Warned beforehand to expect skepticism, Geller withdrewhis offer. And so, understandably, most of the material used by the NewScientist was secondhand. It was also totally damning.[../Images/main-85.jpg] Alison Lloyd, one of Taylor’s young metal benders, whowas only 11 years old. She holds her distorted metalware.Hanlon began his report with both fists swinging: “The whole phenomenon isdominated by Geller’s own personality. He exudes sincerity and a childlikeinnocence and desire to please which makes people really want to like andbelieve in him. This is reinforced by a high failure rate, which seems to be aconstant fear that he will not be able to do what he is trying, and genuinepleasure when he does succeed. And he is a consummate showman, having been amale model and a stage performer in Israel. On the other hand, even supporterssuch as Puharich admit that his main goals in life are fame, money, and women,and that he can be childish, petulant, and extremely difficult to work with. Itis these latter characteristics that caused ex-astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell ...to fall out with Geller last year. Nevertheless, Mitchell and others who haveexperienced his whims believe he is one of the most important psychics of ourtime.”[../Images/main-86.jpg] A miscellany of bent and broken utensils, produced byseveral metal benders—most of them children, according to Taylor.[../Images/main-89.jpg] Electrodes positioned on the head of a 15-year-old metalbender, to record his brain waves.

[../Images/main-93.jpg] Gellerduring the experiments in Birkbeck College with David Bohm, one of theexperimenters. At Uri’s right is the Geiger counter that clicked loudly when heconcentrated on it.And after this skillful piece of character assassination, Dr. Hanlon proceedswith an analysis of “the magic of Uri Geller” that reads like an abbreviatedversion of Randi’s book (which appeared the following year). In fact, his basicapproach is identical to Randi’s. Is it more likely that a paranormal event is afraud or a miracle? Obviously the former. Therefore let us proceed to examinehow Geller could have cheated his way through various tests. The argument soundsconvincing, but as logic it is abysmal. It is merely saying that the chances area million to one against a paranormal event happening, which is somewhat liketrying to prove that there is no life on earth by arguing that the chances are amillion to one against it.Hanlon cites a number of people who claim to have seen Geller cheating,including a television camera technician who saw him bend a spoon by hand whenno one was looking. He even quotes Russell Targ as saying: “I feel confidentthat Geller will cheat if given a chance.” The Stanford experiments wereconducted in an atmosphere of chaos—engineered by Geller. But how could Gellerhave cheated when he got eight out of eight “hits” with a die shaken in a box?How did he locate the film cans that contained ball bearings and similarobjects? How did he get such a high score in duplicating drawings? Here Dr.Hanlon comes up with an ingenious hypothesis. It could have been done with thehelp of Puharich. How? Puharich is an expert in medical electronics, observesHanlon. It would have been well within his competence to make a radio receiverthat would have fitted into one of Uri’s teeth, like a filling.When the New Scientist attack appeared, the results of the experiments atBirkbeck College had still not been published. However, Hanlon had succeeded ingetting hold of a copy of the Hasted and Bohm report, and although he wasviolating scientific ethics, he offered a half-page summary of the report.Predictably, the key bending is dismissed very quickly. Hanlon reports that hisown tests have shown that anybody can bend a key by holding it in both hands andpressing it against the edge of a chair; he also reports on a session in whichUri succeeded in bending a key, and also in tearing his own overtight jeans,presumably as he tried to lean forward very quickly to bend the key against somesolid object. The bent aluminum disk was probably a case of sleight of hand, andas to the Geiger counter’s extraordinary behavior, “to me, this is moreconsistent with Uri or one of his supporters bumping the chart recorder orfiddling with a knob on the amplifier ... ”Understandably, Hasted, Bohm, and Bastin were incensed. It is one thing tocriticize a paper when it has been published—quite another to offer a highlyinaccurate summary and then criticize that. Hasted and Bohm both wrote lettersto The New Scientist, pointing out that Geller could not have cheated in the wayHanlon suggested. A physicist would have to be particularly stupid not to knowthe difference between the “chattering” of a Geiger counter and the staticnoises made by bumping it or fiddling with the controls. And it would be verydifficult to perform sleight of hand on a crystal in a sealed container.[../Images/main-94.jpg] Among the objects used in the Birkbeck tests was thissingle crystal molybdenum disk, which Geller was asked to bend without actuallytouching the disk himself. It did bend, as shown here. Hasted remarks that thisseems to have been the first example of “bending without touching” observedunder laboratory conditions.And so the controversy dragged on, as it continues to drag on today, and as itno doubt will for the rest of Geller’s life. One of the most sensible and usefulcomments on paranormal phenomena has come from the psychologist Stan Gooch.Gooch pointed out that the cerebrum—the thinking and willing part of thebrain—is relatively new; the cerebellum is far older, and seems to be the sourceof instincts. Man has a double personality, according to Gooch: a conscious Egoand a darker side, associated with the cerebellum, that Gooch calls the Self. Hesuggests that all so-called psychical phenomena are expressions of the Selfrather than the Ego, and that if scientists want to try to investigate the Self,they must first recognize the possibility of its existence, and stop behaving asif man were entirely Ego.Gooch’s theory is hardly new; his Self sounds very much like the unconscious,and the Jungian psychologist John Layard had suggested years before thatpoltergeist phenomena were some form of unconscious activity, taking the form ofpsychokinesis. But at least Gooch was trying to suggest a fruitful and positiveapproach to the subject, instead of the drearily negative and barren approach ofthe skeptics. And his view underlines the basic problem associated with theGeller phenomena. No amount of scientific investigation can prove anythingunless the scientist has a positive theory into which to fit his observations.Otherwise they are merely unexplained quirks of nature, and nobody can be blamedfor ignoring them.Geller has been investigated by many other scientists besides those inCalifornia and London. In 1974, he was investigated in Paris by a commission ofscientists led by cybernetician Albert Ducrocq. Geller bent a key, erased theprogram of a pocket computer, forecast correctly the fall of a die, anddemonstrated telepathy; the commission concluded that he was genuine. So didanother group of scientists at the Inserm telemetry laboratories at the FochHospital, Suresnes, France, the following April. In February 1974, the journalof the American Psychological Association Monitor produced a positive report onGeller’s telepathy by Dr. Edward Kelty. In July 1974, physicists at WesternKentucky University observed Geller deflecting a compass, although he was unableon this occasion to influence a magnetometer. After Geller had left, spoonscontinued to bend in the house where he had eaten lunch. At Kent StateUniversity, in Ohio, Geller was successful in deflecting a magnetometer, and healso scored high in experiments involving a die and film cans, similar to thoseconducted at the Stanford Institute. In front of television cameras in Toronto,Geller was subjected to various tests by scientists Dr. A. R. G. Owen and hiswife Iris Owen; in an article in New Horizons Journal Dr. Owen described theconditions as being rigorous as in a laboratory. Both the Owens and the audiencewere totally convinced by the demonstrations.But perhaps the most interesting and impressive of the scientific investigationswas the one conducted on November 6, 1973 at the US Navy Ordnance Laboratories.This experiment used a strange alloy called Nitinol. Rather like those paperflowers that unfold in water, Nitinol can be squashed completely out of shape,then made to resume its former shape by subjecting it to heat or cold. It has akind of “molecular memory.” Dr. E. Byrd held a piece of Nitinol wire stretchedtight between both hands, while Geller stroked the wire. When Geller removed hishand, the wire had a kink in it. Byrd now dropped the wire into boiling water,which should have had the effect of making it snap back into its former shape(the shape in which it was manufactured). In fact, the wire bent into a rightangle. Geller had somehow affected its molecular memory. Even melting the wirein a furnace failed to remove the kink.[../Images/main-95.jpg] The two Birkbeck College experimenters, Bohm (on theleft) and Hasted, with Geller.

Some warmthwas apparently generated, and when they checked the foil, half of it haddisappeared. [../Images/main-97.jpg] Above: Geller in more laboratory tests,this time with Dr. Albert Ducrocq and his team in France. Below: testing duringa telepathy experiment, in which Geller tries to receive a thought from asubject selected by the French research team. Both Uri and the girl are wiredwith electrodes to record the pattern of brain waves.No one who reads straight through the various scientific reports on Uri Gellerthat have been gathered into a book called The Geller Papers can doubt that heis more than a mere conjurer with a new gimmick. Critical investigations such asthose by Hanlon and Randi carry great weight, partly because most people todayfind it easier to believe in fraud than in miracles. Also, the things Gellerdoes seem to contradict our everyday experience of the world. But then, ascybernetician Ducrocq has pointed out, the properties of x-rays andradioactivity also contradict our experience of the everyday world, yet theyhave become the basis of a new type of physics—quantum mechanics.Let us admit that in a way Geller’s powers are thoroughly boring, even ifgenuine. Bending spoons, repairing watches, and predicting the fall of dice arehardly world-shaking accomplishments. They become important only if they pointto something far bigger, to some unknown secret of the universe or of the humanmind. Scientists such as Puharich, Mitchell, Bastin, Taylor, Hasted, and Bohmshould be given full credit for recognizing this, and risking the inevitablecharges of credulousness and naivete. But so far, none of them has produced eventhe most tentative outline of some new positive theory that will give us aglimpse of the real significance of the Geller phenomena.Yet there are already many clues scattered throughout the history of psychicalresearch. Geller is by no means a solitary phenomenon. Let us see whether thesescattered clues can be made to yield a fleeting glimpse of the secret that stilleludes skeptics and believers alike.[../Images/main-98.jpg] Photomicrograph of part of the fracture surface of aring broken by Geller in the Canadian testing with Dr. A.

But the idea that the subconscious mind iscapable of acting directly upon matter in the real world still seems incredible,although numerous authenticated cases exist in which that seems to be the mostlikely hypothesis to explain the facts.Rosenheim is a pleasant little manufacturing town on the edge of the BavarianAlps, some 30 miles southwest of Munich. With its atmosphere of order andtranquillity, it is as unlike modern, frenetic Tel Aviv as one could imagine.Yet it is here, in Rosenheim, that we may find a vital clue to the enigma of theIsraeli psychic. In November 1967, strange events began to take place at theoffice of the lawyer Sigmund Adam, in the Konigstrasse. Strip lights exploded sooften that a firm of electrical engineers was called in to investigate. Theycould find nothing wrong, but they replaced the strip lighting with large bulbs.And the explosions continued. Adam called in the municipal electrical suppliers,who could find nothing wrong. But they placed a special generator in the yard,and ran a cable into the lawyer’s office. Still the electrical supply behavederratically. A voltmeter revealed strange surges of current that wereresponsible for burning out the bulbs, but no one could explain them.[../Images/main-100.jpg] One of the few photographs of a poltergeist in action.A stick “jumps” over 14-year-old Yorkshire schoolboy Michael Collindridge, in aBarnsley hotel in 1965.At this point, Adam began to receive huge telephone bills. A request fordetailed accounts revealed that someone had been making hundreds of calls to theservice that gives the time, sometimes as many as six a minute. Yet this initself was absurd, because it took at least 17 seconds to dial the number andget a connection. Even the most determined practical joker could not make morethan three calls a minute. Someone—or something—had been getting through directto the relays.A reporter came to interview Adam about the odd occurrence. As he was leavingthe office after the interview, a neon tube exploded and fell on his head. Thereporter’s story, entitled “The Rosenheim Spook,” was quickly syndicated allover Germany. It was seen by the noted parapsychologist Dr. Hans Bender, whodecided to investigate. As one of Bender’s assistants was standing in a corridorof the office, he solved the mystery. A young girl was walking down thecorridor, and as she passed under the lamps, they began to swing.Her name was Anne-Marie; she was 19 years old and came from the country. Closerinvestigation revealed that the surges in the electricity supply occurred onlywhen she was in the office. It was obviously a classic case of poltergeistactivity.Bender’s presence seemed to trigger a more normal type of activity. Plates flewthrough the air, pictures turned on the walls, and a filing cabinet—so heavythat it took two men to shift it—moved several feet away from the wall when noone was near it.Herr Adam gave Anne-Marie leave of absence to go and be examined at Bender’slaboratory in Freiburg. While she was away from the office, everything returnedto normal. The moment she came back the disturbances started again.Understandably, Adam fired her. She moved to another office, and the same thinghappened there; again she was fired. She took a job in a mill, but herreputation had preceded her. When someone was killed in an accident the whispersbegan, and Anne-Marie decided to leave.She was engaged to be married, but this soon came to an end. Her fiance was fondof bowling at a Roman Catholic youth club. The alley was proud of its electronicequipment: scoring, pinsetting, and return of the balls were all automatic. Assoon as Anne-Marie walked in, everything went crazy: the scoreboard registeredrandom scores, and the pins stood up or fell down for no apparent reason.Anne-Marie’s fiance broke the engagement.There could be no doubt whatever that Anne-Marie was “causing” all these strangeoccurrences. Yet when Bender first broke the news to her, she was bewildered andincredulous. Even at this point, however, Bender noted a certain ambivalence inher feelings. She was by no means displeased by all the attention.[../Images/main-101.jpg] Top: Anne-Marie Schaberl with her employer, lawyerSigmund Adam. Below: After Anne-Marie’s marriage, the poltergeist activityended. Many unusual gifts and manifestations cease when adolescence is over, butGeller’s powers seem to increase with the years. [../Images/main-102.jpg] TheRosenheim poltergeist at work in Adam’s office.In his laboratory, he discovered that, like many other Bavarian girls, she hadbeen brought up in a strict Roman Catholic environment, and her father was astern disciplinarian. Anne-Marie was not a pretty girl; in fact, although shehad a certain quiet charm, she was rather plain and ungainly. She had had anumber of painful illnesses. And she hated working in a town, especially in anoffice. Bender concluded that her intense dislike of the office was expressingitself in the form of unconscious psychokinesis. Consciously, she was a mild,kind girl, but her unconscious had all the characteristics of the vandals whowreck telephone booths and slash train seats.One well-documented case of poltergeist activity was investigated by the notedEnglish psychical researcher Harry Price around the end of World War II. Theactivity all appeared to center on an 11-year-old boy, Alan, who lived with hisgrandmother just outside London. Most of the poltergeist’s work was done whileAlan was in bed. [../Images/main-103.jpg] At midnight on December 22, 1945,during one series of Price’s observations, a toy key was found flung to thefloor. [../Images/11.jpg] At 12:10 a m. this wrench, which had been kept in thekitchen, dropped on the bedroom floor near the boy’s bed. [../Images/12.jpg] At12:15 a.m. a candle snuffer kept on a chest of drawers appeared on the bed.[../Images/13.jpg] At 1:00 a m. the clock from the dressing table fell on thefoot of the bed. During these observations the boy had his hands tied to the bedrails with tapes that allowed him to move his hands only about 18 inches. Hisbed was near the door so that he could summon the investigators as soon asthings began happening. [../Images/14.jpg] At 1:15 a.m. a trinket case from adressing table appeared on the bed. The case was not locked, and it seemsimpossible that Alan could have moved it with his feet—assuming he could havereached it—without spilling everything.Anne-Marie eventually married another man and had children, and the poltergeistactivity stopped. When a BBC team filmed her in 1975, it was clear she was notparticularly happy. She felt she had been victimized. But by what? Her ownsubconscious?Poltergeists seem completely unpredictable. Records of them date back more than1000 years, and the general outline of their activities seems vaguelyconsistent: rappings, bangings, throwing stones, breaking crockery, startingfires. But they also seem to have a bizarre, almost surrealistic, inventiveness.In England in 1662, a poltergeist in the town of Tedworth played a drum all overa house. In the Phelps case, in the United States in 1860, the poltergeistconstructed elaborate dummies from clothing. A Barbados poltergeist scatteredcoffins in a sealed family vault. A poltergeist in Devonshire enjoyed slappingwomen until they were black and blue. The poltergeist of Barnack Rectory,Northampton, England, specialized in rolling barrels. A Baden-Baden poltergeistdrew pictures on windows. And in another case investigated by Bender thepoltergeist flooded a certain room with water from sealed pipes. This last prankillustrates another fairly familiar aspect of poltergeist behavior: the apparentability to violate the law of nature that says that two things cannot occupy thesame place at the same time. Poltergeists seem to be able to make solid objectspass through brick walls, locked doors, sealed windows, and other barriers. In acase in Croydon, South London, pictures allegedly fell out of their frameswithout breaking the glass or the sealing at the back of the frame.The notorious case of the phantom drummer of Tedworth clearly illustrates thelink between a poltergeist and a living human being. In 1661, a magistrate namedJohn Mompesson had a vagabond, William Drury, thrown into jail, and confiscatedhis drum. Violent poltergeist phenomena immediately commenced in Mompesson’shouse: bangs, thumps, rattlings, and loud tattoos on the drum. The poltergeistalso attacked a blacksmith with his own pincers, wrested a sword from a guestand threatened him with it, and pulled a stick out of the hand of a servantwoman who was trying to prevent the attack. When William Drury was transportedfor pig stealing, the disturbances stopped. It seems clear that Drury’s violentresentment of the magistrate was somehow able to act at a distance, causing theuproar. This suggests that Drury was able, to some extent, to control hispoltergeist. It is also worth noting that the vagabond behind the disturbanceswas no adolescent, but a full-grown man who had fought under Cromwell.[../Images/main-104.jpg] Poltergeist in the kitchen, a 1515 woodcut showing acook being pushed into his cauldron. As early as this, poltergeist phenomena hadbeen recognized and described by baffled observers. [../Images/main-105.jpg] Thephantom drummer of Tedworth, a vigorous expression of the bitter resentment ofthe vagabond William Drury against the magistrate who confiscated his drum andjailed him. The poltergeist activity stopped only when Drury was transported.This 1662 poltergeist is the most reliable early example in England.Despite its apparently human source, a poltergeist often behaves exactly like ademon or mischievous spirit. One of the best-documented is the strange hauntingof Esther Cox in the town of Amherst, Nova Scotia in 1878. The disturbancesbegan in the house of Daniel Teed, a shoemaker, who lived with his wife Oliveand her two unmarried sisters, Jane and Esther. Jane was pretty and had manysuitors; Esther was, by comparison, dull and plain. Esther had one boyfriend, agood-looking but violent young man named Bob McNeal. One evening, Bob tookEsther for a drive, then tried to persuade her to go with him into the woods.When she refused, he pointed a gun at her and ordered her to accompany him. Anapproaching rumble of wheels made him change his mind, and he drove her backhome at breakneck speed. He left town that night. For the next four days Estherwas silent and red-eyed—perhaps regretting her refusal. Then the poltergeistbegan its disturbances. Esther screamed that a mouse was in bed with her. A boxjumped into the air. Then Esther began to flush and to swell up like a balloon.There was a loud explosion, like thunder, followed by three crashes like thereport of a gun. Esther returned to her normal size and fell asleep.The following night, the bedclothes flew around the room and Esther swelled uponce more. Again, two loud reports seemed to end the manifestations. A doctorwas called in. While he was there, the bedclothes and a pillow again flew aroundthe room, while an invisible hand scratched on the wall the sentence: “EstherCox, you are mine to kill.” This happened with everybody watching it.Esther complained of a sensation like an electric current in her body. Then newmanifestations began. After Esther heard a voice warning her that the housewould be set on fire by a ghost, lighted matches began falling from the air. Abarrel of wood shavings in the cellar burst into flames and was extinguishedwith some difficulty.A kindly neighbor who ran a restaurant offered to take Esther in as a servant.The phenomena now began in his restaurant; there were loud knockings, andobjects flew through the air. The poltergeist seemed to prefer metal objects; aclasp knife flew through the air and stabbed Esther in the back, drawing blood,and some heavy iron spokes she was holding suddenly became red-hot. Esther wassacked.She spent part of the summer in the home of friendly neighbors, and nothing morehappened. But when she returned to the Teed cottage, a professional magician hadmoved in to observe her, and the disturbances began again. Presumably he hopedto catch her cheating, but he was soon convinced that the phenomena weregenuine. He persuaded Esther to appear in a public hall to demonstrate herpowers. The audience filled the place to capacity, but to their disappointmentnothing occurred.Esther moved back in with the friendly neighbors and the manifestations ceased.She also found a job on a nearby farm. Various articles of clothing vanishedfrom the house where she was staying and reappeared in a barn on the farm; shewas accused of theft. Before the case could be pursued, the barn caught fire andburned down. She was sent to jail for four months, accused of arson. Thepoltergeist now disappeared for good. If it was her unconscious mind that wascausing the disturbances, trying to compensate for the loss of her lover bydemanding attention, it was now apparently cowed by imprisonment, and gave upits pranks.[../Images/main-106.jpg] The “haunted house” in Nova Scotia where troubled youngEsther Cox lived in 1878 when the peculiar happenings began. By the time Esthermoved away, the house was almost wrecked.On the other hand, the open-minded investigator has to admit that perhaps theeffects were not produced by Esther’s unconscious mind, but rather by some kindof mysterious spirit that was able to make use of her energy—and herresentment—to cause havoc. (The Teed cottage was virtually wrecked by the timeEsther left.) When we are confronting manifestations as strange as this, nohypothesis can be ruled out. But common sense suggests that for the moment wewould do better to accept the simpler and more plausible explanation: that onlyEsther’s subconscious mind, the dark side of her being, was responsible.Many more cases could be cited, but these three—Anne-Marie, William Drury, andEsther—provide the basic parallels to the Geller phenomena.The Anne-Marie case is of interest because it demonstrates that her poltergeist(or “Self,” as psychologist Stan Gooch calls it) could affect electronicequipment and cause violent surges in an electric current, as well as move heavyobjects. Anne-Marie seems to have had no control over the manifestations; inBender’s laboratory, she showed no ability to produce them at will. On the otherhand, when Bender began asking her about some painful experience connected withher illness, his equipment immediately began to register surges of power fromAnne-Marie. This suggests that, if she had wanted to control the effects, shemight easily have learned the trick of recalling some unpleasant event andmaking herself angry or upset.[../Images/main-107.jpg] A meteorite that was teleported out of a glasscontainer while Geller was in the house during a visit to Texas in 1973. Oddly,the meteorite showed a 10% weight loss after the episode.From Geller’s own book—and from Puharich’s—it is clear that he is only partlyable to control his own powers. When I first went to meet Uri in London, in June1974, a Spanish coin jumped out of the ashtray on the desk and fell on the otherside of the room; Geller and a secretary were both on the opposite side of theroom when it happened. And Jesse Lasky, a Hollywood film writer, tells of anoccasion when Geller came to dinner in his apartment in October 1975. The frontdoor of the apartment building he lives in has an iron grill decorated with twowinged dragons. Uri arrived at 8:00 in the evening. At 9:00, another guestobserved the dragons as she came in. When she left, later on, the wings of bothdragons had been bent outward.Uri had been in the apartment all the time, and was suitably apologetic aboutthe damage. The caretaker tried to hammer the wings back but gave up when theybegan to crack.[../Images/main-108.jpg] Geller with the meteorite. He had asked to touch it,but it had been resealed into its container afterward. Much later that evening,the meteorite came crashing down in the entrance hall, rooms away from theoffice-bedroom in which it was kept. [../Images/main-109.jpg] The meteorite asit had been in its case. When it was found in the entrance hall, the ownerdiscovered that the floss on which it had been cushioned had mysteriouslyfluffed out, completely filling the container. This is another example of thepoltergeist phenomena that seem to pursue Geller all the time.In the Tedworth case it seems quite likely that William Drury deliberatelycaused the manifestations: he admitted as much to someone who visited him inprison. On his way to transportation to Barbados, he somehow succeeded inescaping: the manifestations immediately began again in the Mompesson household.Here we have a case of a man apparently able to use the “monsters” from his ownsubconscious to cause damage.The Esther Cox case also suggests some kind of control—if only minimal—over thephenomena. When she was staying with the friendly neighbors, the manifestationsceased. It was highly convenient for her that the barn burned down before theftcould be proved against her. The writing on the wall demonstrates that apoltergeist can “speak.” (There have also been many cases that have involved avoice speaking from the air, the first recorded being that of Sir Osborne deBradaewelle, at Dagworth, in Suffolk, in 1190.) It is a pity that its utterancewas confined to that one short sentence: it would have been interesting to know,for example, whether it would have made the same spelling mistakes as Esther.Anyone who turns to Puharich’s book on Uri after reading about poltergeist caseswill immediately be struck by the similar “feel” of the Geller manifestations.Objects are always appearing and disappearing in an erratic manner. There issomething oddly trivial about most of the phenomena—car engines stopping andstarting, a briefcase “teleported” from America to Israel, a dog mysteriously“dematerialized” and transferred to the other end of the garden. (The same doglater bit Geller, suggesting that it recognized he was the guilty party.) Thevoice seems to promise important events, but nothing happens. The Space Beingsexplain that they have come to warn about an Arab attack on Israel, which couldbecome a world war. Puharich did nothing about the warning, and when the nextArab attack occurred, there was, of course, no world war. The Beings explainthat they intend to land on earth in the next year or so (this was four yearsago), then change their minds and declare that the landing will be “invisible.”Yet in another communication they intimate that they are the UFOs that have beenreported so frequently, and that have—if we are to believe Ufologists—landedmany times. So why make such a fuss about another landing? They explain thattheir spaceship Spectra is “53,069 light ages away,” but do not explain why itis necessary to be so far away to help the inhabitants of the earth. After all,the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is a mere 4.5 light years away. Nor do theyexplain how they communicate with a spaceship at such a distance, unless theyhave some form of energy that can travel millions of times faster than light.The contradictions are endless, but are strikingly typical of the “spiritcommunications” that have occurred so frequently in the history of psychicalresearch. Communicators have often promised—both through automatic writing andthrough mediums—tremendous philosophical revelations. It would probably be fairto say that most of these revelations never rise above the level of semiliteratedouble-talk.Randi, Hanlon, and the rest have no doubt that Geller is cheating, and thatPuharich is probably an accomplice. This is simply not consistent with thefacts. Before Puharich published Uri, no one had cast the slightest doubt on hishonesty or his credentials as a scientific investigator of the paranormal. Itmight be argued that Puharich became insane when he met Geller; but again, noneof the many people who have interviewed him and talked with him subsequently hasexpressed any doubts about his sanity. (Since mid-1975, the former closerelationship between Geller and Puharich seems to have been subjected to severestrains; but this would appear to be due to Geller’s desire to go his own wayrather than to any change of attitude on the part of Puharich.)On the other hand, it is clear that when Puharich met Geller he was already inthe frame of mind of a believer—not so much in Geller but in the mysterious“Nine.” He went to Israel expecting and hoping for miracles. We have alreadynoted that Uri performs badly in the presence of skeptics. So it would hardly besurprising if Puharich’s frame of mind helped to produce some of theextraordinary results of those first weeks in Tel Aviv. In fact, if Uri’s powersare derived from his own subconscious mind, is it not perfectly conceivable thatthese results were due to some kind of collusion between the subconscious mindsof the two men? Puharich expected incredible results; he was eagerly awaitingfurther communication from the Nine. (It would be interesting to know how muchhe told Geller about the Nine before the metallic voice sounded from the air.)He was a well-known scientist, capable of launching Uri on a world-wide career.What would be more natural than that Uri’s subconscious should have gone intotop gear to produce spectacular results?[../Images/main-110.jpg] In another example of poltergeist-like activity on thesame evening that the meteorite was teleported, this Imperial Harpa shellemerged from the space in front of a door and whizzed across the room to strikeGeller in the back. It normally lay on a tabletop as part of the host’s seashellcollection. Although it is a very fragile shell, the violent journey did notdamage it in any way. [../Images/main-111.jpg] Psychic Ray Stanford’s car, whichhe reports was teleported 37 miles when he and his wife were hurrying back tomeet Uri at the airport in Austin in 1973. Stanford reports that as they weredriving, the scene instantly changed, and they were 37 miles closer to Austin,with no time elapsed and—judging by the gas gauge—no gas consumed, either.[../Images/main-112.jpg] The screened porch at the Puharich home in Ossining,New York, about an hour out of Manhattan into which Geller reports he wasteleported himself on November 9, 1973. He had been on the sidewalk betweenFirst and Second Avenue in Manhattan, when he suddenly felt himself propelledthrough a screen window, crashed through it at a height of eight to 10 feet, andlanded inside Puharich’s screened porch. [../Images/main-113.jpg] Nandor Fodor,who died in 1964. He was a psychologist and psychic researcher particularlyinterested in the relationship between psychoanalysis and the paranormal, as(for example) in the case of Mrs. Forbes and the poltergeist of Thornton Heath.All this suggests that Randi and Hanlon were right and that Uri was indeedcheating, if only on a subconscious level. This is my own opinion, and it is, tosome extent, backed by Uri himself, who tells me (on a tape recorded on December12, 1975): “First of all you must know that I have never agreed to Dr.Puharich’s theory, the book that he wrote called Uri, where he says that mypowers come from outer space and UFOs and Beings and so on. To be quite honest Idon’t know where this power is coming from ... ” Yet he has also told me, andmany others, that everything Puharich describes in his book really happened.When he first met Mitchell, Targ, and Puthoff in 1972, Geller told them that hebelieved his powers came from Space Beings. It seems incomprehensible thatanyone who lived through that year with Puharich, hearing voices speaking fromtape recorders and seeing mysterious objects such as UFOs, should completelydismiss the theory that these beings are responsible for his powers. YetGeller’s present attitude is consistent with someone who is aware that Puharichhimself was putting much of the “space men” theory into his head, and that hisown subconscious powers were acting up to it. It is interesting to comparevarious accounts of the incident in the Tel Aviv garden when Uri was zapped bythe “space man.” In Puharich’s account, “suddenly between himself and the bowlin the sky there was the shadow of a huge figure like the shadow of a man with along cape ... A blinding ray of light came from its head and struck Uri soforcibly that he fell over backward and into a deep sleep.” In Uri’s own accountin My Story, there is only “a silvery mass of light” (not a “bowl-like object”)in the sky. “Then it came down lower ... I felt as if I had been knocked overbackward ... ”No space man emitting a blinding flash of light. In an interview with Psychicmagazine in 1973, Geller’s account is even simpler: “This was the afternoon whenI can remember experiencing this flash inside my head as well as outside ofit—which was very vivid to me and which seemed to come from up above. I ran totell my mother about it but she said it was nothing ... ” This time, apart fromthe lightning-like flash, the experience sounds much more subjective. It isindeed possible that something happened that afternoon that awakened Uri’spowers. But it could well have been something that happened inside his head,some brain discharge, possibly resembling an epileptic attack.This is, perhaps, the point at which we should discuss the question of theallegations of cheating. Geller himself insists, understandably, that he hasnever cheated. And his claim is supported by the fact that no one has ever beenable to produce evidence that he has cheated, although he has now demonstratedhis spoon bending and mind reading many thousands of times. Randi tries hard toimply that Geller was caught cheating, yet fails to produce a shred of evidencein his book. There is, admittedly, the evidence of people who claim to have seenhim bending spoons manually—such as the TV technician and Randi. However, Hanlonhimself admits in his New Scientist article that hearsay evidence of cheating isas doubtful as hearsay evidence of miracles. If the technician had filmed Gellerbending the spoon by hand, that would have been a different matter. If Randi andCharles Reynolds had instantly challenged Geller when—as they allege—they sawhim press the key against the tabletop, this, too, would have been worth takingseriously. But even allowing that Randi and Reynolds were totally honest, westill have to acknowledge that they were hoping to catch Geller cheating, andthat their perception could have been influenced by wishful thinking.So there is no hard evidence that Geller has ever cheated; and if his powers areas unusual as they seem to be, it is difficult to see why he should endanger hisreputation by cheating. His supporters have occasionally pointed out that manygenuine mediums have been known to cheat, in order to provide “value for money”when their powers are weak—an admission that has drawn predictable boos andcatcalls from the opposition. If Targ’s remark that he believes Uri would cheatif he got the chance is authentic, then he clearly takes the view that Uri isboth genuine and capable of trickery. This possibility has to be franklyacknowledged—while still bearing in mind that there is no real evidence that Urihas even helped out his powers by sleight of hand.This is not to suggest that the skeptics are wrong to look for trickery—onlythat their skepticism is based on a naive and simple-minded attitude. Theirbasic belief is that such powers cannot exist, according to their preconceivedideas about the universe. They are committed to the view that all mediums andpsychics are frauds; consequently, if one of them is caught cheating, this is aclear and logical proof of their contention. It is never as simple as that. Thisemerges very clearly in one of the classic books of psychical research, NandorFodor’s On the Trail of the Poltergeist. Fodor was a Freudian psychologist whowas inclined to the view that psychic manifestations are often explosions ofsubconscious energy. In 1938, Fodor was called in to investigate a case atThornton Heath, in south London. The woman at the center of the disturbance wasa housewife; Fodor calls her “Mrs. Forbes.” On the day Fodor first called onher, accompanied by another doctor, objects sailed through the air, a glass flewfrom her hand and exploded in mid-air as if struck by a hammer, and thingsvanished from in front of their eyes and appeared elsewhere. A saucer apparentlypassed through a closed door. At investigations in the laboratory, all kinds ofobjects fell from the air: pottery, coins, lamps, even white mice and a bird. Inthe car, as they drove home afterward, the lid of a box opened and closed of itsown accord as Fodor stared at it. Mrs. Forbes sometimes claimed that a tiger wasclawing at her. Those around her smelled a fetid odor like that of a zoo, andclaw marks were found on her body. At this point, an x-ray examination revealedthat she had concealed some small objects in her vagina. It looked, then, as ifshe was a fraud. Yet the evidence was strongly against this. Once, in her house,she asked Fodor what object he would like her to “materialize.” He replied: aRoman lamp, this time of terra cotta. (She had materialized a Roman lampbefore.) A few minutes later, he went into her bathroom and found a fragile lampof terra cotta.[../Images/main-114.jpg] Victorian medium Daniel Dunglas Home. The most famousphysical medium, Home produced a wide range of phenomena that includedlevitation and partial materialization. He worked in full light, and was nevercaught in any kind of trickery or fraud. [../Images/main-115.jpg] One of Home’slevitations.In some of her convulsions, Mrs. Forbes swelled up as if her stomach were aballoon. (Esther Cox had done the same thing.) She experienced hystericalblindness, and produced stigmata such as “tiger scratches” while witnesses werewatching her. One day, when Fodor was walking with her, she opened her handbag,took out a stone, and threw it over her shoulder; when Fodor asked why she haddone this, she indignantly denied it. She had apparently done it without evenbeing aware of it.Fodor concluded that Mrs. Forbes’s various problems and ailments (she hadsuffered much illness, physical and mental, before the manifestations began)were due to some sexual trauma. He was not allowed to complete his investigation(psychical researchers at this time felt that the Freudian suggestions wereindecent), but was fairly convinced that the origin of her problems may havebeen an attempted rape, possibly by her father.Was Mrs. Forbes genuine or a fraud? Both. It is impossible to draw some clearline and state exactly where the real manifestations ended and fraud began. Itis doubtful if Mrs. Forbes herself knew. Fodor observed: “As a woman whoproduced miracles, she felt she had a position to maintain. This position hadliberated her from the dull life of a suburban housewife ... ” Yet to dismissher as a fraud would be a crude oversimplification. More than that: it wouldamount to scientific dishonesty. For Mrs. Forbes’s frustration produced effectsthat were apparently against the normal laws of nature. And until they can beexplained, they remain a challenge to science.There is one obvious basic difference between Mrs. Forbes and Uri Geller, and italso happens to be a difference between two kinds of psychic. Mrs. Forbes’spowers were the result of mental strains; so were Anne-Marie’s and Esther Cox’s.In the mid-19th century, certain investigators of the paranormal liked to talkabout “sick sensitives,” and the description certainly fits this type ofpsychic. On the other hand, Geller obviously belongs to a different group ofpsychics who are basically healthy and in most ways normal. Their powers seem tobe some kind of freak, in the way that some people are born double-jointed, orwith the ability to hear sounds beyond the normal human range.As we have seen, the subconscious mind can, and often does, produce violentparanormal phenomena. In the case of most healthy psychics, the phenomena areusually less violent, yet just as inexplicable in normal terms. Few psychics cancontrol them completely, although some have more control than others.It is important to realize that Uri Geller is a far from unique phenomenon. Fromthe phantom drummer of Tedworth to the present, there have been literally dozenswho have produced effects just as strange and baffling as Geller’s. Let us lookmore closely at this second type of psychic.Perhaps the most famous of all was the Victorian medium Daniel Dunglas Home, whocould cause chairs and tables to float up to the ceiling, wash his face inred-hot coals, and float in and out of second-story windows. Home was so certainof his powers that he usually insisted on demonstrating them in well-lightedrooms. Dozens of respectable scientists, clergymen, and eminent people observedhis performances under these conditions and signed affidavits as to theirgenuineness.[../Images/main-116.jpg] Katie King,” a spirit materialization of the mediumFlorence Cook, with whom Crookes worked in a lengthy series of experiments. Hewas trained as a physicist, but became the best-known investigator of the seanceroom. His work with Home convinced him of the reality of spirit phenomena, butpublication of his findings exposed him to scientific attack.[../Images/main-117.jpg] Charles Richet, a physiologist who became president ofthe Society for Psychical Research. In the 1870s he strongly criticized Crookesfor his acceptance of paranormal phenomena, hut he went on to undertake studiesof his own that led him to his anti-spiritualistic interpretation of genuineparanormal events.The foremost Victorian scientific investigator of the paranormal, Sir WilliamCrookes, conducted a series of sittings with Home under what he regarded as testconditions, and published the results in several classic papers. On April 11,1871, Crookes prevailed on Home to collaborate with a medium called Herne in aseance in the dark. At first, he says, the manifestations were “rough”; thetable floated into the air and crashed down noisily, and they were surrounded bycoarse, bawling voices. After Home began to sing a hymn, “Mr. Herne was carriedright up, floated across the table and dropped with a crash of pictures andornaments at the other end of the room. My brother Walter, who was holding onehand, stuck to him as long as he could, but says Herne was dragged out of hishand as he went across the table.” Voices—pleasant ones this time—spoke aroundthem. One sitter observed a hand removing a book from the table, and he grabbedit; it proved to be a disembodied hand, which carried the book across the table.Hands picked up an accordion and played it in mid-air. (On another occasion,Crookes watched the accordion being played by invisible hands while it wascompletely enclosed in a cage.)Home himself had no doubt that these phenomena were caused by spirits of thedead. (This, of course, applies to most mediums.) But investigators such asCrookes and Professor Charles Richet, although totally convinced of thegenuineness of the phenomena, were not necessarily convinced that the dead wereresponsible. They already suspected that some hidden part of the mind can playextraordinary tricks. Richet, a distinguished chemist, concluded sensibly: “Themore I reflect and weigh in my mind these materializations, hauntings, marvelouslucidity [ESP and “second sight”], apports [objects that fall out of the air],xenoglossia [speaking in strange tongues], apparitions and, above all,premonitions, the more I am persuaded that we know absolutely nothing of theuniverse that surrounds us.”For the ability to reproduce drawings sealed in envelopes, Richet invented theword “cryptesthesia.” His Thirty Years of Psychical Research contains many pagesdescribing his investigations into cryptesthesia with various amateur psychics,and shows sketches and target drawings that are as striking as Geller’s. Hewrote: “In certain persons, at certain times, there exists a faculty ofcognition which has no relation to our normal means of knowledge.” He latercalled this faculty “the sixth sense.”Apart from Home, there have been many remarkable mediums whose claims have beeninvestigated by scientists, including Mrs. Leonore Piper, Eusapia Paladino, RudiSchneider, Eileen Garrett, and Ena Twigg. Mrs. Piper, like Uri Geller, receivedher first intimation of strange powers when she was playing in a garden as achild. Something struck her on the ear, and a voice said: “Aunt Sara is notdead, but with you still.” It later turned out that Aunt Sara had died at thatexact moment. Shortly after this incident, the child’s bed rocked violently fromside to side one night, and the room was full of a strange light that preventedher from sleeping. As an adult she became a medium, and was noted for theremarkable accuracy of the information she was able to give about dead relativesof her sitters. Scientists arranged all kinds of rigorous test conditions tomake sure she was not cheating. One had her followed by a private detective fordays before a sitting; another tried the experiment of sending her to a foreigncountry—England—of which she knew little, engaging a completely new staff ofservants to look after her, and forbidding her to read newspapers; still, herinformation during seances remained copious and accurate.In view of the impressive testimony of men of science and philosophy—includingSir Oliver Lodge and William James—there seems to be no doubt of the genuinenessof her powers. There remains the possibility that she may have possessed veryunusual powers of telepathy, enabling her to pick up her information from otherminds. She herself said, “Spirits of the departed may have controlled me and mayhave not. I confess that I do not know.” Whatever the origin of her powers, theysurvived several decades of the most rigorous testing that scientists coulddevise.A medium whose powers are considerably closer to Uri Geller’s is the famousLajos Pap, a woodcutter from Budapest, who was in his late 30s when he firstaccidentally attended a seance. The sitters held a heavy table to the ground bypressing their feet on the bottom of its legs; yet the force being exerted wasso great that it loosened the massive tabletop and made it rise into the air. Aprocess of elimination revealed Pap to be the one who was responsible. Fiveyears later, Pap produced his first apports—an ability for which he becamefamous. A wild flower and a tobacco pouch fell onto the table in a locked room.Obviously, the first question to be asked in such a case is whether the mediumhas concealed them in his pockets. Lajos Pap convinced one scientist when across weighing 20 pounds fell from the air. In seances, with his hands and feetheld and even his mouth sealed, Lajos was able to apport flowers, stones,insects, a dead squirrel, birds, fish, mice, bottles, and showers of wine, beer,black coffee, cream, and liqueur—what kind is not specified.[../Images/main-118.jpg] The remarkable Bostonian medium Mrs. Leonore Piper, whowas discovered by William James. She was investigated for 30 years by Britishand American workers. 15 [../Images/15.jpg] (1) The document apport.

Sixphotographs taken in the course of the Lajos Pap seances at the InternationalInstitute for Psychical Research. During these seances Lajos purported toproduce (from left to right, top row) documents, an ectoplasmic cigarette, agold coin—the medium being naked at the time—and (bottom row) a 28-inch snake,elongation of his own body, and an ectoplasmic handkerchief. Nandor Fodorconcluded that the handkerchief was certainly fraudulent, and there were groundsfor suspicion of fraud with all the other apports produced in London. But he didfeel that the results Lajos had earlier obtained in Budapest were worthy offurther intensive scientific investigation. Right: the garment that Lajos woreduring the tests, with phosphorescent bands to reveal any of the medium’smovements.Nandor Fodor tested Lajos in Budapest. In a locked laboratory, Pap wasthoroughly searched, then made to don a garment that covered him from neck tofeet (presumably so he could not, like Mrs. Forbes, use natural orifices toconceal things). Pap’s hands and feet were held, but he was still able to makeslight scooping motions in the air with his hands. In this way he collected 30beetles—all alive and protesting—and twigs of acacia, wild rosebuds, and afour-inch cactus plant. On another occasion, Fodor watched Pap cause a basketpainted with luminous paint to float around the room, at the height of hishands, and obey his orders. Typically, Fodor dismissed this demonstrationbecause Pap could have been somehow controlling it with an invisible thread. Yethe was totally convinced by the living apports. Fodor had been a collector ofinsects, and knew the immense difficulty of catching dragonflies and of handlingstag beetles without getting bitten. Pap produced many dragonflies, and on oneoccasion 15 stag beetles. If these had been somehow concealed on him (he wasalmost naked under the robe), his chances of getting bitten were considerable.When Pap came to London in 1935, he produced much the same kind of sensation asUri Geller, and might have produced even more if television had existed then. Onthis occasion, Fodor came to the conclusion that many of the apports—including adead poisonous snake—could have been fraudulent, simply because he judged thatPap had the opportunity to conceal various objects on his person. Yet heconcludes: “Nor would I be willing to declare him a fraud and nothing but afraud. Too long has psychical research been the victim of the fatal delusionthat a medium is either genuine or fraudulent.” He goes on to add a fascinatingcomment that may throw a new light on the problem of the poltergeist. “It is aminimal assumption that mediumship means a dissociation of personality. Therewas plenty of evidence that Lajos Pap was suffering from such dissociation.” Hebelieved that Pap was a kind of Jekyll-and-Hyde personality. Many famous casesof dual personality have been studied by psychologists. Perhaps the most widelyknown is the “three faces of Eve” case written about by Thigpen and Cleckley.The subject was a suburban housewife who was periodically taken over by acompletely different personality that led her into many embarrassing situations.Geller himself shows no obvious signs of a dual personality; yet it may besignificant that the voices from the air began to sound as soon as he was underhypnosis, just as many mediums are taken over by their “spirit guide” as soon asthey go into a trance.[../Images/main-124.jpg][../Images/main-125.jpg][../Images/main-126.jpg] Thearrangement of the seance room for the Lajos tests. The medium’s chair isindicated by the circle marked with an M. The room was liberally furnished withcameras, thermometers, and luminous slates on the walls.Since World War II, a number of highly gifted psychics have been tested byscientists and pronounced genuine. Two of the most widely publicized are GerardCroiset, a Dutch clairvoyant, and Peter Hurkos, another Dutchman, who lives inthe United States. Both these men possess the same kind of second sight thatMrs. Piper displayed, and both have used them to help the police solve murdercases. Hurkos’s powers developed during the war, when he fell off a ladder andsuffered concussion. When he recovered, he found himself unable to concentrateon the normal tasks involved in making a living; by way of compensation, he hadacquired an ability to know about events that had taken place elsewhere or atother times. His “psychic radar” seems to operate when he handles variousobjects associated with these events. In a typical case, Hurkos was asked by thepolice to sit in the taxicab of a murdered driver. Hurkos gave a carefuldescription of a man whose name, he said, was “Smitty,” and who had also, saidHurkos, been responsible for another death—of a naval man shot in his apartment.The police were astonished; there had been such a murder recently, but they hadnot connected it with the cabdriver’s death. A waitress reported a conversationwith a drunken sailor who boasted of killing two men; at the police station, shepicked out a photograph of a sailor named Charles Smith. A “wanted” notice wentout for him, and he was arrested in New Orleans. Smith confessed to thecabdriver’s murder and was sentenced in 1958. Hurkos had described “Smitty”accurately even to a tattoo on his arm.I had occasion, in 1975, to interview Gerard Croiset, a clairvoyant of Utrecht,for BBC television. The subject of the interview was a girl named Pat Macadam,who had vanished while hitchhiking from Glasgow. When the driver who had givenher a lift was located, he claimed that he had dropped her off near her home. Hehad a police record for sexual assaults, and was shortly afterward sent toprison for another. Finally, the driver admitted that he had turned off the mainroad when driving Pat home and said that he and Pat had had sexual relationsbefore they drove on. His story could not be disproved, and he was released.However, a local journalist went to visit Croiset in Utrecht and took Pat’sBible. Croiset held it, and unhesitatingly declared that Pat was dead. She hadbeen killed in the course of an attempted sexual assault, and her body thrownfrom a nearby bridge. He described the bridge, and also an adjacent house withadvertisement signs on it, and a disused car in the garden, with a wheelbarrowpropped against it. Police discovered the bridge, and the house with the disusedcar and the wheelbarrow propped against it, exactly as Croiset had described. IfPat’s body had indeed been thrown from the bridge, her killer was lucky; theriver was subject to sudden violent flooding, and the body had almost certainlybeen carried out to sea. The case remains unsolved. Yet no one who has seenCroiset’s drawings of the places associated with Pat’s death and then visitedthe sites themselves could have the slightest doubt that Croiset possessesastonishing powers of second sight.[../Images/main-127.jpg] Left: Gerard Croiset, the Dutch sensitive, who hasbecome famous through his successful work in tracing lost people and objects.Right: Peter Hurkos, the Dutch psychic who first developed his powers after anaccident in which he suffered a concussion. He now lives in the United States,and has worked with many police departments to trace missing persons.[../Images/main-128.jpg] Ingo Swann, an American artist and psychic, who hasworked with several researchers studying the nature of his powers. Perhaps themost fascinating results have been from tests of “out-of-body experiences,” inwhich Swann, observably sitting in one place, has produced information hidden incompletely inaccessible spots.Equally remarkable, although less widely known, is the Swedish psychic OlofJonsson, who has also been extensively tested by scientists. The mostspectacular story about Jonsson concerns a particularly horrifying series ofmurders that took place in Sweden in 1952; in all, 13 people were murdered,mostly shot and their houses set on fire. A journalist friend asked Jonsson tohelp. The police obligingly took the psychic from one scene of crime to another,and he correctly described what had happened. Then, as a police officer namedHedin handed him a burned rifle, Jonsson suddenly knew with certainty that thisman was the murderer, and that the crimes were committed for robbery to buygifts for a demanding mistress. Before Jonsson could convince the police ofHedin’s guilt, the policeman had committed suicide, leaving a note confessing tothe murders.In America in 1966, Jonsson agreed to help in another case that looked like sexmurder; three young girls had disappeared after a trip to the India dunes regionnear Chicago; the car of one of them was found abandoned in the dunes park.Jonsson handled cigarettes belonging to the girls, and declared that they werestill alive; they had bleached their hair, he said, and were living in the townof Saugatuck, in Michigan. On the urgings of the parents of one of the girls,Jonsson went to Saugatuck and located a waitress and doorman who could identifyphotographs of the girls. All three were found alive.Jonsson’s remarkable ESP powers have been extensively tested by scientists; hisscore in card and dice guessing tests is as consistently high as Geller’s. Hehas often revealed a gift for foretelling the future; he accurately predictedthe time and place of the deaths of de Gaulle and Nasser.A few months before Geller was tested at Stanford, a New York artist and psychicnamed Ingo Swann was also able to deflect the needle of a shielded magnetometerunder strict test conditions. But this is one of the least of Swann’s abilities.Swann belongs to a group of psychics who claim to possess the power known as“traveling clairvoyance”—the ability to leave the physical body and project thespirit (or “astral body”) elsewhere. This, too, was tested by Hal Puthoff andRussell Targ. Swann was locked in a room at the Institute; then theexperimenters threw dice, and looked up the number corresponding to the resultin a locked filing cabinet, which contained a set of numbered cards. The cardthus selected by chance bore instructions to drive to Palo Alto Town Hall. Oncethere, Targ and Puthoff tried to transmit their impressions of the place, whichincluded a crossroads, two trees, and a dry fountain. When they returned, Swannhad done an accurate drawing showing the crossroads, and the trees, and a noteabout the fountain.Before the Mariner 10 spacecraft set out for Jupiter and Mercury, Swann andanother psychic, Harold Sherman, decided that this would be an ideal opportunityto test their powers of long-distance projection. Accordingly, they attempted toproject themselves to these planets. Their impressions were written down, thenexamined by a lawyer and notarized. When the spacecraft sent back its reports onthe planet, Swann and Sherman eagerly compared these with their own impressions.Their description of Jupiter, they admit, was only partly accurate; but theirimpressions of Mercury were phenomenally accurate. Swann had not only mentionedMercury’s magnetic field, but also described the precise shape of the field, asreported by Mariner 10.Swann claims that it took him only eight minutes to locate Mercury, from whichwe may deduce that astral travel is almost as fast as light. This may explainhow Puharich’s “Nine” can project themselves over 50-odd light years of space.All this, of course, sounds absurd—except that Swann and Sherman have the dated,notarized documents to prove the accuracy of their description of Mercury.Ingo Swann prefers to call his peculiar faculty “remote viewing” rather thanastral travel, which has overtones of nuttiness. The same is true of Pat Price,the subject who shares Targ and Puthoff s report with Uri Geller. Price is aformer California police commissioner and city councilman. Understandably, mostof the attention received by the article was directed at Uri, because hehappened to be by far the more controversial of the two. Yet if we accept thefindings of Targ and Puthoff, Price scored as consistently as Geller. The methodwas basically the same as in the tests with Ingo Swann: a location was chosen(from a pool of 12) by some random method, and one experimenter remained withPrice, asking him for his impressions, while the others drove to the spot chosenas the target. This was done nine times, and six of Price’s descriptions were soaccurate that an independent team of judges was able to “match up” the actualplace against the transcript of Price’s words.This ability, whether called “remote viewing” or “astral travel,” is by no meansrare. Many books have been devoted to it, and in recent years scientificallycontrolled tests like the ones at Stanford have begun to produce an impressivebody of documentation. The point it underlines is that Geller, far from being aunique figure, is only one of hundreds of gifted psychics, whose facultiesmerely happen to be less newsworthy than his own. One of them is a young Britishpsychic, Matthew Manning, whose powers seem to be quite as extraordinary asGeller’s.In February 1967, Matthew’s father, a Cambridge architect, came down tobreakfast and found his favorite silver tankard on the living room floor. No onein the family could explain how it got there. A few days later, the tankardagain fell off the shelf in the night. Suspecting a joke, Matthew’s fathersurrounded the tankard with talcum powder; the next morning, the powder wasundisturbed, but the tankard was again on the floor. Dr. George Owen, aCambridge expert on poltergeists, was called in to investigate, and he quicklyconcluded that they were dealing with a genuine member of this mischievousfraternity. A wooden chair was overturned, an armchair moved six feet, acandlestick was thrust into a vase of flowers. Dr. Owen concluded thatMatthew—then aged 11 and the only Manning child near puberty—was the unconsciousforce behind the poltergeist.[../Images/main-129.jpg] Matthew Manning, a young English psychic. Now in his20s, Manning first became aware of his powers when his family was plagued by arash of poltergeist activity, and Oxford researcher Dr. George Owen concludedthat it was probably Manning supplying the unconscious force behind themanifestations. The poltergeist activity stopped as he developed powers ofautomatic writing and drawing, and—inspired by a TV program showing Geller atwork—he immediately discovered that he had the power to bend metals.After three months, the manifestations stopped—as poltergeist manifestationsusually do. Four years later, they began again, in a manner that recalls thefamous Douglass Deen case, on which the book The Exorcist was based. Matthew’sbed rose into the air and shook. A heavy settee was moved across his bedroomdoor. From then on, the Mannings came down each morning to new scenes of chaos:furniture would be strewn around the rooms or piled up in a heap. At one point abroom balanced itself on the banister. The house was filled with thuds andpinging noises.Matthew became a boarder at Oakham School. There the manifestations continued,to such an extent that the headmaster twice requested Matthew’s removal,although he relented on both occasions. Then the poltergeist phenomena suddenlyceased, as Matthew developed another aspect of his psychic abilities. Since theage of 15, he had occasionally practiced “automatic writing”; now his handshowed a talent for automatic drawings—not the usual childish scrawls producedby amateur psychics, but talented carefully executed drawings in such diversestyles as those of Picasso, Dürer, Beardsley, and Beatrix Potter. Sometimesthere were inscriptions on these drawings in languages Matthew could notunderstand. Messages in Latin, French, and Arabic appeared mysteriously on thedrawings. Like Arigo, Matthew was sometimes taken over by the spirit of a deaddoctor, who was able to make startlingly accurate medical diagnoses of visitorsat a single glance, as well as prescribing remedies. In January 1974, whenMatthew watched Uri Geller bending spoons on television, he tried it himself andinstantly succeeded. The scientist Dr. Joel Whitton testified to seeing a spoonbend when Matthew was not even touching it.Like Uri, Matthew has told his own story, in a book called The Link. Like Uri,he has been extensively investigated by scientists, who have testified to thegenuineness of the phenomena. He differs from Geller in one basic respect; hehas no desire to make money from his gifts or to demonstrate them in front oflarge audiences, although he did appear once on television, on the David Frostprogram. “Uri Geller did a lot of good, but also a lot of damage,” he once tolda reporter, and added: “I don’t want to be looked at. Psychics cannot perform atthe drop of a hat. Basically, it’s like running a battery. You use it up, andhave to wait ... Besides, it’s exhausting.” And so the quiet, introspectiveManning continues to live in Cambridge, shunning publicity, and collaboratingwith scientists who wish to investigate his powers.[../Images/main-130.jpg] Three Kirlian photos of Manning’s fingertips.

[../Images/18.jpg] A splendidly prickly Dürer porcupine, signedwith the artist’s distinctive monogram.Here we have a well-documented case of poltergeist phenomena developing intomore diverse and sophisticated psychic powers. Yet we still lack an explanationfor the phenomena. How do we account for the drawings in so many styles, for thewriting in Latin and Arabic? Yet we can make at least one statement withreasonable confidence: if poltergeists are manifestations of the unconscious,then Matthew’s powers emanate from the depths of his own mind. He has said asmuch in a letter to me: “I feel that these powers are basically of a poltergeistnature albeit on a more controlled level. I believe that the mind or braingenerates what we term a ‘psychic energy,’ and that this can be applied toproducing physical phenomena ...” As to the possible source of his powers, hehas also mentioned, in a letter to me, that his mother sustained a violentelectric shock when she was carrying him. This is an interesting parallel withGeller, who received a shock as a boy, while his mother was sewing.Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the recent publicity given to UriGeller’s psychic abilities is that so many people have become aware that theytoo possess such powers. John Taylor’s spoon-bending children have made him thetarget of a great deal of skepticism and even derision. It is possible, andindeed probable, that some of them bent spoons in the normal way by hand whenTaylor’s back was turned. Yet no one who has read with an open mind Taylor’saccount of some of the test conditions can doubt that some of the phenomena musthave been genuine. Moreover, the “Geller effect” has been observed in almostevery country where his abilities have been demonstrated on television.Following his visit to Japan in 1973, so many Japanese children showed abilityto bend spoons, start watches, recharge dead batteries, and predict the futurethat many scientists started to study them. Shigemi Sasaki, professor ofpsychology at Denki Tsuchin University in Tokyo, formed a team of 15investigators and set out to explore the PK (psychokinetic) abilities ofchildren. He enclosed a piece of wire horizontally in a glass dome, with a smallweight on it to give it a certain downward tension, and then asked a successionof children to hold their hands near it and attempt to bend it. Kenji Hashimoto,former professor of engineering at Tokyo University, was astounded as he watchedthe wire bend steadily downward, and he declared afterward that it wasimpossible for it to have been done by trickery. One unusually talented12-year-old, Jun Sekiguchi, not only bent three spoons, one after another,merely by holding them in full view of the scientists, but was apparently ableto de-materialize part of the metal; 0.03 of a gram had been lost when one spoonwas reweighed. Dr. Sasaki has also described the abilities of a 15-year-oldcalled Satoshi (his parents wanted his identity kept secret). Besides bendingmetal, Satoshi also showed extraordinarily accurate powers of prediction. Hecorrectly foretold two earthquakes and their location, and also predicted thefinancial scandals that caused the resignation of the then Prime Minister,Kakuei Tanaka.[../Images/main-136.jpg] One of the metal-bending children cited by ProfessorJohn Taylor—Mark Shelley, then seven years old—exhibits the bent cutlery heproduced imitating Geller. [../Images/main-137.jpg] Russell Jennings, then 12years old, who was one of Taylor’s best metal-bending subjects, with hisautographed picture of Geller.Geller seems to possess remarkable ability to induce psychic powers in otherpeople; but this may be due to the fact that more people have seen him ontelevision than have seen, for example, Ted Serios or Ingo Swann. Most dowsers(water diviners) will tell you that they can teach people to dowse; but theywill also admit that the faculty is latent in all of us, and that it is simply amatter of “tuning in.” Felicia Parise, an attractive 37-year-old New Yorker whoworks as a leukemia researcher in a New York hospital, was so intrigued by filmsof the Soviet psychic Nina Kulagina, who can move objects on a tabletop bystaring at them, that she decided to try it herself. Soon she found that she wasable to make small objects slide around on a smooth tabletop simply by staringand concentrating. Her abilities were examined under test conditions at DukeUniversity by Dr. Graham Watkins, who confirmed her ability to move a compassneedle by concentrating on it. Dr. Charles Honorton, at New York’s MaimonidesInstitute, observed her moving a small bottle on a tabletop by PK. Dr.Christopher Evans included shots of her moving a glass on a tabletop in atelevision film he made about paranormal research. Other scientists haveconfirmed her ability to move pieces of tinfoil enclosed in a bell jar, createan energy field that can influence electrical instruments, cause unexposed filmto fog over by concentrating on it, and achieve billion-to-one scores inreceiving mental images transmitted to her by researchers. But she admits “Afteronly five or ten minutes of concentrating, I’m exhausted. I perspire freely;sometimes my nose and eyes run. I tremble. It takes a tremendous physicaleffort—such an effort that I can hardly speak afterwards. I lost about 15 poundsin the first few weeks of doing this.”Interestingly enough, though, her powers increase when she is emotionally upset.She discovered her abilities one day after receiving a phone call saying thather grandmother was seriously ill. As she reached out for a small plasticbottle, it skidded away.[../Images/19.jpg] Another young metal bender, June Charlton, bends her father’spipe while he is trying to smoke.After her grandmother’s funeral, she tried it again, and was able to make thebottle move at will. She had been trying to move tiny objects before thisincident—after seeing the Kulagina films—but without success. Yet her attemptshad somehow awakened her latent powers, which were suddenly increased by theshock of her grandmother’s illness.How many other people would spend 15 minutes concentrating so hard that theylose weight and leave themselves too exhausted to speak? The answer is, almostno one. Could this be why so few of us have any idea of our hidden psychicpotential?[../Images/main-138.jpg] Another of Taylor’s metalbending children, a girl of13, was able to bend metal objects at a distance and also showed considerableability at telepathy, producing the drawings at the right in response to thetargets shown at the left. All three were drawn outside the room where the childsat, but transmitted by a person sitting in the same room."},{"pageContent":"5—GETTING TO KNOW GELLER“He bent a spoon, broke one of my keys, made my watch go back several hours ...”“How do you feel about the idea of doing a biography of Uri Geller?”[../Images/20.jpg] The author and the enigma: Colin Wilson and Uri Geller in thecourse of their conversations during a visit to Barcelona, Spain.The question was put to me by my literary agent in the spring of 1974. I said Ithought it was a lousy idea. I had just read Puharich’s book, and found itbaffling and infuriating. But he seemed to have picked the bones pretty clean.Anyway, how much of a biography can you write of someone in his mid-20s?Geller, it seemed, was under some kind of contract to the business tycoon RobertStigwood, who was responsible for such shows as Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar.And Stigwood, it seemed, had decided to produce a film based on Uri’sautobiography. Since I had written novels, biographies, and a book on theoccult, I was apparently high on the list of possible biographers.The film business is like a game of tennis, in which the original idea is battedback and forth 100 times or so, and the rules are changed every five minutes.While I was still brooding on the question of whether I could afford to turndown so much money, somebody else was asked to write the biography, and I wasasked to turn in my own ideas for the film script. As a preliminary step, I wasto meet Uri Geller for lunch.I had no fixed ideas about Geller. I had seen him on television and thought hima personable young man, although hampered by a kind of exuberant immodesty. Ialso felt a certain sympathy for his struggles against the anti-successmechanism, which was already gathering force. I had been through the same kindof thing myself in the mid-1950s, when my first book earned me the misleadinglabel “Angry Young Man,” and all the zany publicity that went with it. Withinweeks, the same journalists who had launched myself and other “AYMs” (such asplaywrights John Osborne and Brendan Behan) were tearing us to pieces. Now, as Iheard Geller described as a materialist, a publicity-hound, and a downrightfraud, my sympathies naturally tended to be on his side. As to whether hecheated or not, that was a matter on which I kept an open mind. But I had nodoubt whatsoever that such powers as he had demonstrated on TV could be genuine;researching a massive book on the occult had convinced me of that.That first lunch with Uri was an oddly disappointing and inconclusive affair.Mark Twain has a story about an inventor who asks a millionaire to finance aninvention. Within five minutes, the millionaire is convinced, and takes out hischeckbook. The inventor goes on to describe the benefits his invention willbring to society, and the millionaire begins to wilt and puts away hischeckbook. And when the inventor goes on to detail the blessings his inventionwill bring to the whole world, the millionaire kicks him out. Uri has the sametendency to oversell himself. His steadily mounting enthusiasm seems an attemptto pressure you into belief, although his feats speak quite eloquently enoughfor themselves. On that first occasion he bent a spoon, broke one of my keys,made my watch go back several hours by clenching his fist above it, and read mymind. Only this last feat seemed 100 percent free of any suspicion of cheating.I sat with my back to a blank wall, and Mrs. Rae Knight, one of Stigwood’sassistants, sat next to me. Uri, alone, sat opposite us, his back to the room.While I did my drawing—of a kind of spook—he turned his chair around and satwith his back to me. I cannot swear that he did not glance back over hisshoulder, but Rae Knight, sitting next to me, could watch him all the time. ThenI covered the drawing with my hand and Uri turned around. It took him severalminutes to get it, and I had to concentrate hard.I may have made involuntary movements of my head as I tried to transmit thedrawing, but hardly enough to tell him it was a face. The only possibility ofcheating was that Rae Knight was some kind of accomplice; subsequentacquaintance with her has convinced me that nothing is less likely.Randi could—and did—duplicate the spoon bending and watch altering, but not themind reading (at least, not over the dinner table with me).When I left Uri that day, I was puzzled and disturbed. I was more than halfinclined to believe in his total genuineness. Yet he had placed a coin over theface of my watch before clenching his fist over it; Randi could quite easilyhave changed the hands in the split second before he placed the coin over it.Uri had taken my key across the room to a radiator, explaining that he gainspower from metals; he could have bent it somehow as he crossed the room. (I didnot go with him.) Added to these purely practical misgivings was my instinctivewariness of someone so prone to overselling his powers. So I was not reallydisappointed when, after a few months of silence, Rae Knight phoned me to saythat the film seemed to be off.I had reckoned without Uri. The next development in the story came to me via RaeKnight. She told me that Robert Stigwood had invited Uri to dinner at his house,to explain that the film idea was impracticable for the moment. Uri, who likesto get his own way, was incensed. As the butler served drinks from a largepewter tray, the tray suddenly snapped in two. A large poker in the fireplaceproceeded to bend. Stigwood went down to the kitchen, to inquire about the delayin serving dinner, and learned that forks and spoons were bending. Stigwood wassufficiently impressed to reverse his decision on the film.My next encounter with Uri was on “Start the Week,” the BBC radio program I havealready mentioned. Although the program is run by the gentle and courteousRichard Baker, I again had the feeling that Uri had been handed the wet end ofthe stick. He was introduced by Esther Rantzen, who read aloud a passage aboutbending keys and making watches change their time. A long dialogue followed, inwhich Uri clearly felt on the defensive. He took hold of a key belonging toFlora Rita Schreiber—author of Sybil, a book about multiple personality—andcaused it to bend 10 degrees by rubbing it gently, allowing others to rest theirhands on it at the same time. Someone suggested that he had borrowed the keybefore the program and bent it then; Miss Schreiber flatly denied that. At thispoint, Esther Rantzen explained that the earlier extract she had read was not adescription of Uri, but of the Amazing Randi, bending a key by professionalexpertise; she went on to quote Randi: “I am proud of my profession. In my viewUri Geller brings disgrace to the art I practice. Worse than that, he warps thethinking of the young generation of forming minds—that is unforgivable.” “Inother words,” added Miss Rantzen, hurling the final brick, “the effect we sawachieved on the table this morning could have been sleight of hand.”Of course, there is no law—or even convention—that says an interviewer has to bekind to an interviewee. Still, in my own experience, it always produces a senseof betrayal to find you have been lured into an ambush. Whether you play itcool, fight back, or lose your temper, you can’t win. Fortunately, at this pointUri was spared the necessity of reacting by having to leave to catch a train; Iwas left with a feeling that he had just about held his own.[../Images/main-140.jpg] Robert Stigwood, who began as a pop star manager, wassufficiently impressed by Uri Geller’s feats to plan a film about him.For the next few months I wrestled with the movie outline. Screen tests showedthat Uri tended to underact rather than overact, which is unusual for abeginner, and good news for his director; it is the overactors who areimpossible to coach. My own problems were less easily solved. From thebeginning, I had felt that a straight film biography of Uri was a nonstarter;the idea of a film biography of someone who bends spoons is absurd. What isinteresting about Uri is the implications of what he is doing. Where do hispowers come from? Do we all have them? Are they just an accident, likedouble-jointedness, or are they connected to some inner development? It was thislast question that interested me, and I played with the idea of a kind of “2001of inner space.”At the same time, I did my best to arrive at some more definite conclusionsabout Uri. Here, I was slightly more successful. I questioned a number of peoplewho had seen him in action, and whose honesty I could trust. These included anumber of publishers of my acquaintance, who had met Uri at the Frankfurt BookFair in the previous year. In my own experience, publishers tend to be among themost hard-headed and skeptical members of the population. All were predisposedto regard him as a clever conjurer. One described handing Uri a key, and thendeliberately walking backward as Uri made his way across to a radiator (to “gainpower”), refusing to take his eyes off the key. At the radiator, Uri rubbed itgently and bent it within seconds.The most interesting story I heard was of the dinner at which Uri causedcoffeepots and sugar bowls to crumple inward, merely by pointing his finger atthem. One publisher remained unconvinced, or at least defiant. Uri held his handabove the man’s gold cuff link, without touching it. The link parted, and fellon the tablecloth. When the publisher picked it up to put it on again, the barholding the two halves together was missing. A thorough search of the table andfloor failed to reveal it.A similar session has been described in Esquire by a contributing editor, DotsonRader. Geller touched a gold link bracelet he was wearing, and told Rader thathe had received it from an older woman, which was correct. He pointed to Rader’swatch: “That has an engraving under the watch. But not written to you.” Heremoved the bracelet from Rader’s wrist, apparently without touching the clasp;as he continued to detail accurate information about its donor, Rader realizedthat the saltcellar was moving of its own accord across the top of the table.Rader describes it graphically as looking like “a tiny bishop wearing a silvermiter shuffling across a snowy field.”Such incidents, along with other testimony, convinced me that Uri undoubtedlypossesses some weird power.When I began to plan this book, there were a number of questions that I neededto ask him. Because Uri spends most of the time in Mexico and traveling aroundthe world, and I live in Cornwall, England, it was not easy to arrange ameeting. Finally, in February 1976, I heard that he was due to visit Spain; Iarranged to fly to Barcelona to talk with him.With Uri, things seldom go as expected. The day before I left, he telephoned toexplain that he could not come to Barcelona. In Madrid, the police had had toeject a man from the hotel after he tried to attack Uri; then he received deaththreats from Palestinian guerrillas. A performer on stage is highly vulnerable,and the Spanish police could hardly be expected to keep him permanentlysurrounded by a bodyguard. So Uri decided to cancel his performances inBarcelona. Instead, he would meet me the following weekend in San Sebastian. Idecided not to tell him that two Spanish monarchs have been assassinated in SanSebastian.[../Images/main-141.jpg] Uri Geller—shots taken during a lengthy Esquireinterview session. Geller’s good looks, which made him a successful model inIsrael at the beginning of his post-army career, have appeared in countlessnewspapers and glossy magazines as the editorial writers try to say somethingsensible about the nature of his obviously remarkable powers. [NOT PICTURED] Theauthor with his tape recorder and Uri with pencil and paper discussing thenature of Geller’s paranormal abilities [../Images/main-142.jpg] Geller with theauthor in a Barcelona hotel suite, trying a simple ESP experiment. It was notparticularly successful, possibly because Geller was tense.I went to Barcelona anyway—by this time I had other appointments. The day aftermy arrival, Uri phoned again from Valencia. He had decided to leave Spainwithout further performances, but would come to Barcelona to see me after all. Ihastened out to buy a tape recorder—having left my own at home—and went to meethim at the airport.Legend has it that Uri travels with a vast retinue of people. In fact, he wasaccompanied only by Shipi, and by his secretary Trina, a quiet American girl.Meeting Uri again, I was struck once more by his good looks and his athleticcondition. He has not allowed the luxurious life to increase his weight. He doesnot drink, smokes only an occasional cigar, and eats sparingly and simply.Morning and evening, he lies on his back on the floor and raises his legs abovehis head 80 times. He explained that if he ceases to feel in the peak of health,his powers deteriorate.As we make our way toward the taxis, Uri speaks about the death threats. “It isabsurd. I have nothing against the Palestinians. All I want to see is peace inthe Middle East.” And he mentions his ambition to be invited to lecture inEgypt. I am again struck by the seriousness and enthusiasm with which he sayseverything; it may be a habit he has picked up from being interviewed so manytimes. He makes an impact of great sincerity, as well as charm. When you aretalking with him, it is difficult to doubt him. And when he assures me, withgreat emphasis, “I have never cheated, never once in my life,” I decide that heis probably speaking the truth.As we speed along the road to Barcelona, there is a thud, and Uri looks around,alarmed, in case a suitcase has fallen off the roof. The driver pulls over tothe side of the road and gets out. The luggage rack has become loose. As hetightens it, Uri asks him in passable Spanish, “Has this ever happened before?”The man says “No.” Uri turns to me: “You see, these strange things are alwayshappening around me. Of course, sometimes it is just coincidence ... ” Fiveminutes later, the other side of the rack comes loose and we have to tightenthat; Uri shakes his head but doesn’t press his point.Because I am here to ask him straight questions, I start off with the one thatbothers me most. He seems to me altogether too preoccupied by the doubters andcritics; and this, in turn, seems to be part of his over-preoccupation withmaterial success. He was once reported as saying that his immediate ambition wasto have a million dollars in the bank.With his usual emphasis and sincerity, he says: “Let me explain. I think of mylife as having three stages. In the first stage, I simply wanted to get known—Iperformed anywhere, all over Israel, sometimes for no fees. But my family needsmoney. So does Shipi’s family. So the second stage is to make enough money to beable to live comfortably. In a short time—perhaps a year, perhaps more—I beginthe third stage: to develop myself, to learn about my powers.”I ask him again what he thinks about the nature of these powers, but he shakeshis head. “I just don’t know. I don’t know where they come from or what theymean, or why it should be me and not somebody else.”[../Images/main-145.jpg] Geller with two of his closest friends, the pianistByron Janis and his wife Maria.

He reports that often when he is most eager to bendmetal he has no success, and then when he relaxes and puts it down, the spoonwill “spontaneously” bend.I present my own view: that they come from his own subconscious mind, and are ofthe same nature as poltergeist manifestations. He is clearly unconvinced. “Ifind that hard to believe because whatever lies behind these powers seems to beintelligent. Sometimes it plays jokes. In my book I say that maybe it’s a CosmicClown.”He has a point. Poltergeists do sometimes behave intelligently—such as the onethat wrote: “Esther Cox, you are mine to kill.” And it would be absurd to ruleout the possibility that there are intelligent forces, quite apart from man’sown mind, that cause many so-called “psychic manifestations.” Yet until we havesome proof—or at least, some definite indication or clue—it is surely better tostick to the more plausible hypothesis.[../Images/main-148.jpg]In Uri’s room, we switch on the tape recorder, and I continue down my list ofquestions. It strikes me that in one way Uri is unique among psychics. Everyother one I can think of has had some kind of contact with the “dead” or the“other world.” I want to know if Uri has ever felt that he was in contact withthe dead. Uri slightly misunderstands my question, and proceeds to tell me ananecdote about when he came out of the army. He brought a small plastic bombhome with him. Unable to resist the temptation, he went up to the roof of hismother’s house at midnight, and hurled it into the graveyard opposite. There wasa loud crash, and he went back downstairs, and to bed. Some time later he wasawakened by a knock at the door. He hurried to the door—and found no one there.Five minutes later, the knocking recurred. Again, there was no one there. Whenit happened a third time, Uri jumped onto his bed, and stared out of the window,which had a view of the door. There was no one. The next morning, he went intothe cemetery, searching for signs of the explosion, but could find none. Heconcluded that the rappings had been made by a spirit, perhaps reproaching himfor tossing explosives.At Puharich’s house in New York, Uri heard three loud bangs coming from theceiling overhead. Puharich’s late father, who had been bedridden before hisdeath, used to summon Puharich by banging his cane three times on the floor.Uri had two other experiences suggesting the presence of a spirit—in both cases,the composer Chopin. While he was visiting the pianist Byron Janis, a death maskof Chopin over the piano had begun to shed tears. And when he and Janis stood byChopin’s grave in Paris, a stone flew past their heads. (Uri has suggested thatJanis may be a reincarnation of the composer.) Both of these occurrences may beexamples of the poltergeist phenomena that Uri seems to produce, and so also, Isuspect, was the knocking at his door after he threw the bomb into thegraveyard. There have been many well-authenticated cases of pictures andstatues—usually religious ones—shedding tears; like the stigmata of some saints,these effects seem to be due to some activity of the unconscious mind.The knockings in Puharich’s house may be a different kind of phenomenonaltogether. Many investigators now hold the view that haunting ghosts—as opposedto single-appearance phantoms—are not evidence of some intelligence present butare a kind of “recording” imprinted on a place by strong emotions. The hauntingmay be purely electrical in nature. When someone who is sensitive to thevibrations enters the electrical field, he will see—or hear—the ghost. Aninsensitive person would not even notice it. When Uri heard the knockings,Puharich himself was in the room. Could it have been he whose mind was sensitiveto the “field,” and whose unconscious mind projected the knockings so that Uricould hear them too? It may be that Puharich’s subconscious is quite as active,in its way, as Uri’s, and was partly responsible for the strange phenomena wehave been examining.[../Images/main-149.jpg] Three photographs of Nina Kulagina causing a card andcigar holder to move inside a closed box.

[../Images/main-150.jpg] Geller with one of his many girl friends, inIsrael. He agreed with the author that there may be some connection in his casebetween his paranormal powers and sexual energy, as has been shown previouslywith other psychicsPeople who are able to see ghosts are often—perhaps always—able to dowse forwater with a divining rod; the powers seem to be related. This led me to ask Uriabout his own dowsing abilities. He has been employed by a large mineralcorporation to try to locate mineral deposits from an airplane. “I can locatemetals—tin, zinc, copper, gold, silver,” he said, “but not oil or water. I triedit with them and it didn’t work.” Like Hurkos and Croiset, he has been able toapply his second sight to criminal cases. In one case, he entered the apartmentof a kidnapped man, and then looked at a map of the city and indicated the areawhere he thought the man was being held. When the police flew him over the areain a helicopter, he was able to pinpoint the area even more accurately. “I justget a feeling when I’m close to what I’m looking for,” he said. As it happened,the missing man was found, in the area specified by Uri, before the police hadtime to make use of his information.When I asked Uri about this case, he seemed surprised, and a little alarmed,that I had heard about it, and asked me not to go into detail about it, or aboutother similar cases. I got the impression that this was not because he wasafraid of criminal reprisal, but because he is not entirely happy about thesepowers. He seemed to have the same attitude when I asked about healing—for mostdowsers also seem to be able to heal. In his autobiography he says that his fewattempts at healing have been only minimally successful. I am inclined towonder, again, whether he is afraid of being side-tracked into an area that atpresent holds no appeal for him. He seems to have decided that his abilities liein certain directions; these are now well-tried and have brought him success.For the moment, that is enough.Yet Uri himself—and this is perhaps the most interesting thing about him—iscertain that psychic powers can be developed by anyone and are simply anextension of our normal powers. When he was a child, his own powers wererestricted to reading his mother’s mind, and causing watches to go forward orbackward. In the period after he came out of the army he deliberately set out toextend them. “If you lift weights for a day or two, nothing happens. But if youlift weights every day for one or two years, then you will see the change.” Mostpeople, in his opinion, reveal no psychic powers because they fail to make anycontinuous effort to develop them.He began to describe a simple exercise for developing such powers. “When youwalk in the street, look at the next corner and try to see the color of the nextcar that will appear. Keep practicing this.” We all possess powers of telepathy,he believes. For example, the deja vu feeling—“I have been here before”—is due,he thinks to a kind of telepathy; your “thought waves” reach the place beforeyou do, so you feel you have been there before.These observations about effort seem to be confirmed by the experiences ofFelicia Parise. Mrs. Parise’s experiences raise another significant point, whichUri confirms. Her first experience of psychokinesis occurred spontaneously, whenshe was not making an effort. Uri mentions that this frequently happens to him.He tries hard to make a spoon bend; nothing happens. He relaxes and puts itdown, and the spoon proceeds to bend. It may be that our violent efforts of willsomehow frustrate themselves. When we relax, some deeper will takes over, anddoes the work effortlessly.This applies also to his thought reading. In the three days we were inBarcelona, we made several attempts at thought reading, but none wasparticularly successful. I could believe him when he said this was because hewas tense. There are so many stories of his telepathic feats from unbiasedwitnesses that there can be no reasonable doubt that he possesses this abilityto a remarkable degree. A woman friend told me that on two occasions he hadsuddenly told her things that startled her. On the first occasion, he spoke ofher husband, who was dead, and described their marriage and relationship withastonishing accuracy. Skeptics will object that he might have learned about thisby questioning her friends. But on the second occasion he surprised her bytelling her that she was about to go to dinner with a man she liked, and thendescribed the man in some detail. In a spirit of perversity, she deliberatelycontradicted everything Uri said. “He is several years older than you.” “No,he’s younger.” “He is English.” “No, he’s African.” But she admitted to me thathe had been right on every count—even to giving the correct first letters of theman’s two names. Uri had looked increasingly baffled as she continued tocontradict him; he was certain that the mental clues he was picking up from herwere correct.This woman’s reaction to Uri is worth mentioning because it is not untypical.The Geller charm is potent—particularly when he is talking; but, as with mostcharismatic people, there is a certain aggressiveness in his magnetism. Peopletend to express their reservations—and irritations—when they are away from him.There is something very childlike and open about Uri, and like many exuberantchildren he sometimes displays signs of spoiltness, particularly when he getstired or when life becomes too complicated. To be sure, the pressures he livesunder are intense, and it would take a saint to remain permanently patient andcalm in this glaring light of nonstop publicity. A strong element of basic“niceness” has seen him through so far.An incident in Spain illustrated the Geller magnetism in action. While I wasbeing interviewed on the local television in Barcelona, Uri was taken to meetthe Spanish publisher Noguer, who publish The New Library of the Supernatural inSpanish.I had certain misgivings about his visit. The only book that has been publishedin Spanish about Uri is as negative and hostile as Randi’s—its author, likeRandi, is a professional magician. As a result, many intelligent Spaniards takeit for granted that Uri is a fake whose only interest is making money. A fewpeople in the publisher’s office had read the book and were inclined to beskeptical about the Geller “phenomenon,” if not downright hostile.[../Images/main-151.jpg][../Images/main-153.jpg][../Images/21.jpg] Geller hasbeen frank about the importance he places on achieving fame and fortune, and nowas a celebrity he has the opportunity to meet and spend time with other worldcelebrities as diverse as Omar Sharif, Salvador Dali, Elton John, and MuhammadAli.Seemingly oblivious of the negative vibrations, Uri talked for five minutesabout promotion and advertising. Then, perhaps sensing lack of enthusiasm, heasked for a watch. One of the chief editorial advisers removed one from hiswrist and handed it to him. Uri placed it, face down, in the hand of the firm’sdirector, then clenched his fist over it several times, so that his knucklescracked. (He has explained that the cracking noise is essential; when it isabsent, nothing happens.) A few seconds later, the watch had gone back an hour.Those I questioned later insisted that Uri had no time to alter the handsmanually before placing it in the director’s hand. Uri was then offered anotherwatch, but he rejected it because it was gold. He is never quite certain whetherthe “powers” might overdo it and ruin the watch. Instead, he asked for a spoon.Everyone was watching keenly, recalling suggestions that he bends the spoon byhand, then holds it in such a way that the bend cannot be seen as he rubs it.But Uri held the spoon by its end, so that almost all of it was visible. Heplaced one foot against a metal radiator to “gain power.” Then he gentlymassaged the handle. Within a few seconds, it began to bend as if the metal hadturned to rubber. He handed it back to the director and pointed out that it wascontinuing to bend in his hand. In fact, it went on bending until the handle wasalmost U-shaped.Skepticism vanished; and so did much of the latent hostility. Such ademonstration has the effect of clearing the air like a thunderstorm. Uri’ssupremely confident manner ceased to jar. A few hours later, I met most of thosewho had been present, over a late-night dinner. The curled spoon was handedaround and examined with astonishment; the general feeling now seemed to be thatUri Geller was really an extraordinary young man.The following morning, Uri and I were due for a lengthy photographic session.Before the photographer arrived, I took the opportunity to ask a few questionsthat had occurred to me in the night. I was still trying to get some clue aboutthe source of his powers. I set the tape recorder going and asked:“This is an indiscreet question but ... you are a fairly highly sexed person.There’s an occult tradition called Tantrism that makes deliberate use of sexualenergy. Do you think there could be any connection between your powers and yoursexual energies?”Uri was unoffended. “Strangely enough ... I never asked people how they respondsexually ... But I think, according to the women I am with, or the girls I’mwith, that I am more sensual than the ordinary person ... Yes, so maybe that hassomething to do with it.”The question was, I think, worth raising, even though Uri holds no definiteviews on it. Many investigators have observed the connection between sex andpsychic force; Harry Price once interviewed the husband of a young Austrianmedium, who told him that in the early days of their married life, ornamentswould jump off the shelf when his wife had an orgasm. The young German officeworker Anne-Marie ceased to cause poltergeist phenomena when she married. EstherCox’s manifestations were connected with a sexual trauma. So, according toNandor Fodor, were those of “Mrs. Forbes.” It is worth bearing in mind at leastthe possibility that Uri’s powers may be, to some extent, sexual in origin.There was one more question that I wanted to ask. Ever since I discovered, to myown astonishment, that I appear to be able to dowse, I have been brooding on thestrange implications of the force that causes a forked whalebone rod to twistupward or downward in my hands. For me, the rod dips for water, and twistsupward in the vicinity of ancient stones—of which we have hundreds in Cornwall,where I live. It seems to me that some electrical force from under the earthsomehow affects the rod, through the medium of my brain. There is nothing verystrange in this; we know the earth is an enormous magnet. If I hold the rod verytight, keeping the ends rigid, it still bends upward. Is it not conceivable,therefore, that the power that enables Uri to bend a spoon may be the power thattwists the divining rod? And that his powers may come from the earth itself?The idea excited Uri: “Isn’t that strange?” he exclaimed. “I can use my powersmuch more strongly in Mexico. And in Israel. My body changes when I’m in theseplaces. For some reason, I feel more fit, my skin gets tighter, my powers arestronger ... America is more difficult. My powers are low on the East Coast, andget stronger as I go west. In Africa my powers were stronger. Most of myfailures were in Europe, and my biggest successes were in Australia, NewZealand, Africa, Mexico ... I was so powerful in Mexico. I could feel it. Istayed in the pyramids for four days, just walking around. In one moment, Iseemed to see the whole scene that happened thousands of years ago, right therein front of me.” The subject of Mexico deflected him from this theme. He went onto describe how when he arrived at the airport, there were five limousineswaiting to meet him—one for each of his party, and two for the baggage. Onceagain, Uri was the delighted small boy, hobnobbing with presidents, loving everyminute of his fame.The photographer and his assistants arrived, and we went up to Uri’s suite. Ientered first. As I did so, there was a pinging noise, and Uri turned, saying“What was that?” An electric light bulb lay on the floor behind him. He snatchedit up. “What’s this?” He looked up at the light overhead; its bulb was still in.“It’s an apport!” At that moment, the assistants came in; they included anAmerican girl who was living in Spain. Uri showed them the bulb. “Look, it justfell from the ceiling.” The girl volunteered the information that a bulb hadfallen out of its socket in her apartment a week before. Uri became very excitedand turned to me. “You see, things like this often happen to people just beforethey meet me. Didn’t I tell you that? It happened to the Marquess of Bath ... ”He told the girl he believed the bulb he had just found came from her house, andasked her if she could phone her home and find out if there was a bulb missing.She said the place was empty at that time, but that she could phone her husbandduring the lunch hour. It seemed to me that Uri was making a great deal of fussover nothing, and I again had the feeling that he was pushing things a littletoo hard. Yet the sequel seemed to justify his excitement. The girl called herhusband, who verified that a bulb was missing—from the same socket that had beeninvolved in the earlier incident.For the next half-hour or so, we submitted to being photographed. Uri wanted todemonstrate the “lifting experiment” on me. I had seen it done before; sometimesit had worked, sometimes not. This time, under Uri’s direction, it workedbeautifully. I sat down, and Uri, Shipi, Trina, and another woman tried to liftme by placing their index fingers under my armpits and knees. Naturally, it wasimpossible. Next, under Uri’s instructions, they stacked their hands above myhead, in such a way that no person’s two hands were next to one another. Then,on a command from Uri, all removed their hands, replaced the index fingers undermy arms and knees, and I sailed up easily into the air. It is a not uncommonfeat, which can be performed by five people in any place. Yet I have never seenit work quite so well as it did on the occasion when I tried it with Uri.[../Images/main-159.jpg] [../Images/main-160.jpg] The author as the subject ofone of the “thought-pressure” experiments with Uri and his friends in aBarcelona hotel. [../Images/main-161.jpg] Another try at the ESP game. Theperson in the center shuts her eyes and the four in the circle place theirfingers very lightly on her shoulders, and (having decided together in advanceon a single direction) all concentrate on influencing her to move in thatdirection.Next, at my suggestion, we tried an experiment in “thought pressure”—anotherparty trick. One person stands in the center of a group of four, his eyesclosed. The four place their fingertips very lightly on his chest and shoulders.Then, having decided tacitly which direction he should move in, they concentrateon making him sway in that direction. This, too, is an experiment that sometimesworks and sometimes does not. In this case, we had a 75 percent success rate.Trina instantly swayed in the direction we wanted; so did Uri. So did I, when Itook my place in the middle. Shipi swayed forward instead of sideways, as we hadmentally directed him, although he said he felt a force impelling him in bothdirections.There may be natural explanations for both of these feats. After all, it shouldtheoretically be possible for four people to lift one person, even with theirindex fingers. It is possible that, after placing their hands in a pile(according to Uri, the hands should not be touching), they simply make a suddenconcerted effort, which, perhaps for psychological reasons, they may not havemade the first time. I find the thought pressure experiment harder to explain,simply because in my own experience there is definitely a sensation of beingpulled or pushed in the required direction.I myself am inclined to take the view, which Uri shares, that when several mindsact in concert strange things can happen. He believes that this explains theremarkable success of his public experiments in spoon bending and watchrepairing. The most recent had taken place only a couple of weeks before I sawhim in Spain; a women’s magazine asked its readers to concentrate at a certaintime on a certain afternoon, and to get out any watches that needed repairing.There had been the usual overwhelming response from readers who claimed thatlong-inactive watches had started and that cutlery had bent. (A Swedish womantried suing Uri because she claimed that one such experiment had bent herinternal contraceptive coil and caused her to become pregnant.) The wife ofscreen writer Jesse Lasky later told me that she had taken part in theexperiment, and that a clock that had been rejected by a local watchmaker asunrepairable started up and ran for 40 minutes.It was nearly time for me to catch my plane back to London. I went up to my roomto collect my bags; Uri volunteered to come with me. On the stairs, there was aloud pinging noise, and we turned to see a broken spoon on the stair carpet.“Another apport!” Uri shouted, in wild excitement, and yelled downstairs for theothers to come and see. It was the lower half of a spoon. Yet again, I waspuzzled and not entirely happy. If it had fallen out of the air in front of me,that would have been convincing. But its falling behind Uri was a differentmatter. He could quite easily have tossed it there, as he could have tossed thebulb earlier. He was walking behind me on both occasions. Yet why should he? Ididn’t need convincing. If anything, these ambiguous demonstrations tend toincrease one’s skepticism.Half an hour earlier, Uri had said something that struck me as highly relevantto this whole problem. He emphasized how often his powers refuse to work infront of cameras, and how frustrating he finds it that some of his mostconvincing demonstrations happen when the camera is pointing in anotherdirection. He said gloomily: “The things that always seem to work are the thingsthat any magician can duplicate. Randi’s quite right to point that out. Butthat’s not because I’m doing a conjuring trick. You’d think—” He looked upsuddenly. “You’d think that whatever causes these things to happen doesn’t wantthem to be proved.”This is an observation that struck me years ago, when I was conducting my firstlengthy investigation into the whole field of the occult. I began with a strongbias toward skepticism. Besides, to tell the truth, I still find occultphenomena a little preposterous and irrelevant. What do they really matter ifyou place them in the balance against the truly great human achievements—againstthe creative genius of a Michelangelo, a Beethoven, an Einstein? In that contextthey seem almost trivial. Yet unbiased investigation led me to conclude thatparanormal phenomena are not pure wishful thinking; some of the evidence fortelepathy, psychokinesis, out-of-the-body experiences, and reincarnation ishighly convincing. So why do we not take it for granted, as we take for grantedcosmic rays and neutron stars and subatomic particles, and many other thingsthat we can never test with our own eyes? And the answer seems to be that theparanormal is oddly shy. Like a modest girl, it will show just so much ofitself, and no more.There is certainly enough evidence to convince those who are predisposed tobelieve, and also those who are genuinely open-minded. There is far from enoughto change the mind of a determined skeptic. It tempts one to believe that someintelligent power is determined to keep us uncertain. The Daniel Dunglas Homesand Uri Gellers and Matthew Mannings are enough to make everybody reexaminetheir preconceptions about the universe and to undermine their complacencies.But no amount of investigation of their phenomena seems to provide us with thecertainty we crave. The great breakthrough that science has accustomed us toexpect never seems to come. And when an unusually gifted psychic such as Uriturns up and demonstrates his powers in the laboratory, he also has to be a bornshowman, with the personal mannerisms of a pop star, so that the skeptics cangrimace and say: “What, him ... ?”These were the thoughts that occupied my mind as I wandered around a Barcelonapark with Uri and observed his temper fraying as the cameraman demanded newposes, and the children trotted up to him with their autograph books. In mypocket, I had the half of a spoon that had fallen on the stairs behind us. Hadhe thrown it? On the whole, I thought not. Then who—or what—had? And why had itdone so in such a manner as to leave room for doubt in my mind? As I stared intoUri’s eyes—at the request of the cameraman—my instinct told me he was honest. Sowhy were the “powers”—whether from starship Spectra or from his ownsubconscious—revealing themselves so enigmatically?I find myself envying the total skeptics. They have such an easy way out.[../Images/main-162.jpg] Geller and his friends try to lift the author into theair, using only their fingertips. They begin by trying to lift him that way, andof course fail. Then they stack their hands above his head, so that no personhas his own two hands placed together.

Suddenly he asked, “What hour was I born?”“Four o’clock in the morning.”“What time is it now?”“Seven fifty.”A few minutes later, the child said, “In that case, I’m now 188,352,000 secondsold.” His father noted down the number. When they got home, he did thecalculation on a sheet of paper, and told his son, “I’m afraid you were 172,800seconds wrong.” “No,” said the boy, “You’ve left out two days for the two leapyears 1820 and 1824.”Was the child some great, universally acclaimed genius, like Newton or Einstein?No, he was Benjamin Blyth, son of an engineer, and his name is otherwiseunknown. Children with this peculiar power to calculate immense numbers are byno means a rare phenomenon. Most of them lose this power when they enter theirteens.The baffling thing about such prodigies is that there is no good reason why thehuman brain should possess such extraordinary potential. Scientists tell us thatwe developed from primitive fishes, which turned into reptiles, then intomammals. Man’s remote ancestors came down from trees, survived the era ofupheaval and drought known as the Pleistocene Age, and learned to live togetherin communities for their own protection. Man’s brain developed as an instrumentof survival, like his hands and his teeth. Why, then, should it be capable ofsuch incredible feats of calculation, beyond anything he can ever have needed?It is as extraordinary as if, like some super-flea, he could leap 500 feet intothe air.This kind of puzzle is not confined to the human species. BiruteGaldikas-Brindamour, a naturalist who has closely observed orang-utans in theirnatural environment, and who has brought up baby orangs, observes that they seemto possess an intelligence far in excess of the needs of their forestenvironment. Recent observation has revealed that even the shark is moreintelligent than—according to the theory of evolution—it ought to be. For 300million years this creature has remained unchanged, perfectly adapted to itsenvironment, with senses that automatically guide it to food. With no choices tomake, and no natural enemies, the shark does not need intelligence. Yet whentested for intelligence in laboratory mazes, the shark proves to haveintelligence equal to that of a rabbit—a far more highly evolved form of life,which has plenty of natural enemies and therefore a greater need forintelligence.Obviously the key to this mystery lies in the brain itself. Textbooks on thebrain admit that there are vast areas within it about which we know nothing.Some physiologists have suggested that man uses only about one tenth of hisbrain. What is the purpose of the other nine tenths? No one seems to know.Presumably these other parts must have a purpose, or they would not haveevolved. Is it conceivable that they govern faculties for which we no longerhave any use? Most animal lovers can tell some story about the “second sight” oftheir pets, of a dog bristling and whining when forced to enter a room in whichsome tragedy has taken place, of a cat that knows when its owner has died, eventhough he or she is in a foreign country. The archaeologist and dowser T. C.Lethbridge observed that his cat would respond to other animals, such as miceand voles, which it could not see or hear because they were on the other side ofa thick wall. And it is now widely believed that the mysterious homing instinctof animals and birds may be some kind of sensitivity to the magnetic forces ofthe earth—those same forces to which the dowser’s rod responds. Animals seem tobe more telepathic than human beings. So it is a reasonable assumption thatthese faculties may also be connected with the unknown nine tenths of the brain.Human beings no longer need for survival a “homing instinct” or a “second sight”to warn them of the approach of enemies. Therefore, in most of us thesefaculties lie dormant.[NOT PICTURED] A cross section of the human brain. Although certain areas of thebrain have been identified as to the function controlled, it is still true thatscience knows nothing about vast areas of the brain, and any explanation oftheir function is still hypothesis.

The photos were takenin the Neuropsychiatric Institute at the University of California in LosAngeles, part of an experiment supervised by psychologist Dr. Thelma Moss. Eachtime Geller concentrated on “sending energy” to the key.[../Images/main-172.jpg] Geller drawing his forces together in intenseconcentration. Casual observers, dazzled by his superb showmanship, oftenoverlook the effort involved, which—as Uri admits—sometimes interferes withachieving the desired result.All of which should certainly help us to understand Uri Geller’s ability to readminds. Something has awakened his dormant faculty. But what about his power overmetals?Here we have to consider another possibility. In an important essay called “TheEnergies of Man,” the psychologist William James talked about the phenomenon of“second wind”—how we can apparently be exhausted, and then quite suddenly seemto switch over to a “reserve energy tank” and feel completely refreshed. Hespeaks of the case of a colonel during the Indian Mutiny who was in charge of abesieged garrison with many women and children under his care, and who went foran entire week without sleep, living on brandy. He never became drunk, and itdid him no harm; the emergency called upon his vital reserves. James concludesthat we all possess immense “vital reserves” that we seldom use because we arehabit bound and allow ourselves to become easily fatigued.In speaking about Uri Geller and other similar cases, Professor John Taylor hasalso discussed these vital reserves—for example, how a frantic mother has beenknown to lift a heavy vehicle from her child, who was trapped under it. Heconcludes that the muscles themselves probably store up the immense energiesrequired for such feats. This, he thinks, might explain the energies involved inpoltergeist activity, and possibly in Uri Geller’s metal bending.[../Images/main-174.jpg] Thelma Moss, who has taken more Kirlian photographs anddone more experimental work with them than anyone outside Russia. She reportedthat her informal experiments with Geller appeared to have been very successful,but were not tightly enough controlled for her to exclude the possibility ofdeliberate fraud by Geller. [../Images/main-175.jpg] A close-up showing Uri’sfingerpad, with the energy spurt. [../Images/main-176.jpg] Right:Experiments—using the Kirlian technique on color film—in which Geller wasattempting to send a shape telepathically. Below: in this photo, Geller wastrying to form the shape of the number 5, which he felt he was then receivingtelepathically.This is an interesting and plausible idea, but it contains one pitfall. When wethink of the human body or brain as a kind of battery that stores energy, we arethinking in exclusively physical terms. But when the colonel lived for a week onbrandy, he was creating energy, burning up surplus fat, converting the alcoholto “fuel.” When Felicia Parise tries to move a glass by the power of her mind,she perspires heavily and loses weight—she is creating energy out of mass. Yet,oddly enough, she first succeeded in moving an object by mind power when she wasnot trying. Uri Geller has frequently made the same observation: that a spoonmay remain unbent while he tries hard to bend it, then start bending when heputs it down and thinks of something else. The logical inference is that theenergy used in these poltergeist-type activities is not ordinary muscularenergy, but some other kind, that we are less able to control. It is analogousto the situation in which you try hard to remember something—for example, aname—but fail totally while you keep trying; then, as soon as you think ofsomething else, the name comes to you. Your brain was doing its best to obeyyour command, but you were somehow blocking its proper activity by summoningcrude will power.The picture that begins to emerge is a complex one. It begins to look as if boththe brain and the body have great untapped resources, including the ability tocreate vital energies at short notice. But the energies involved in psychicactivities are not the energies we normally use, so most of us have somedifficulty in calling on them. Certain people, like Uri, are able to do so—justas some children can calculate enormous numbers.Uri’s powers may have originated in the sewing machine incident, when hereceived an electric shock. At least, it seems significant that he “draws power”from both metal and water, the two substances that conduct electricity.The expression “draws power” suggests another possibility. The earth is anenormous magnet. The ancient Chinese believed that lines of force run across thelandscape. They called them “dragon paths” and built their temples on them. InEngland, students of the countryside have observed how many ancient stonecircles and monuments seemed to be built on similar alignments, and how certainreligious centers, such as Salisbury and Glastonbury, seem to be the meetingplace of several such lines. There is some evidence that these “ley lines”correspond to natural lines of force in the earth. They certainly respond verypowerfully to the divining rod, which suggests that there is some form ofinteraction between the dowser’s brain—whose activity the divining rod“meters”—and the force he is tuning in to. Some dowsers, such as T. C.Lethbridge, are so sensitive that they experience a kind of electric shock, likemild static, when they place their hand on ancient stone monuments.If Uri derives power from a metal radiator—which is presumably earthed, orgrounded—there is at least a reasonable possibility that the power he is usingcomes from the earth. It may seem to be a contradiction that his powers arestronger in airplanes; but then, as everyone knows, the lines of force in amagnet run around it from one pole to the other; in an airplane Uri could havebeen in the center of the force field. (It would be interesting to see how hispowers would operate if he actually stood on the north or south magnetic pole.)[../Images/main-177.jpg] Two of the first Kirlian photographs taken of Geller.In the top picture, his finger is at rest.

[../Images/main-179.jpg]An illustration from Baron Karl von Reichenback’s Le Fluide des Magnetiseurs,summarizing his work in the 1840s Here a mysterious light appears at themagnetic points of the fingers and the magnet, which Reichenback called the“odic force.”It is also worth bearing in mind that occultists have always held the view thatmagnets possess peculiar properties. This seemed to be given scientific backingin the 1770s, when Franz Anton Mesmer, the discoverer of “mesmerism” (now calledhypnotism), declared that he had been able to cure sick people by stroking themwith magnets. Within 10 years, scientists had decided that Mesmer was acharlatan, and he died an embittered old man. In the 1840s another scientist,Baron Karl von Reichenbach, discovered that his patients were not only sensitiveto magnets but also able to see colors streaming from the two poles. In oneexperiment an assistant in the next room uncovered the poles of a huge magnet,and a patient lying in bed—and observed by Reichenbach—instantly detected themagnetism as a tingling sensation. When the patient was unconscious, her handwould stick to a magnet as if it were metal. Reichenbach believed he haddiscovered some unknown energy, which he called “odic force”; he said that iscould also be detected streaming from the ends of the fingers. Again, it tookonly a few years for scientists to decide that he was a crank, and that humanbeings cannot be influenced by magnets. Yet now, in the second half of the 20thcentury, investigators believe they have discovered a method of photographingthis “aura” that streams from the ends of the fingers. The technique is known asKirlian photography, and it is under systematic investigation in variouslaboratories. Could Reichenbach also have been correct about magnets? Is itpossible that certain human beings may be sensitive to magnetic forces of theearth? If so, then we have one more vital clue to the mystery of Geller’spowers.The real problem, as we try to explain the feats of a Daniel Dunglas Home or UriGeller or Matthew Manning, is that we lack a firm theoretical foundation. Thephilosophers of ancient Greece were highly intelligent men, but all theirattempts to explain lightning were a waste of time, because they had never heardof electricity. In fact, no one was in a position to understand lightning untilBenjamin Franklin literally brought it down to earth in 1752 by flying a kitewith a wire cord in a thunderstorm. Poltergeist activities can leave us in nopossible doubt that we are dealing with some unknown force that does not obeythe known laws of physics. If 100 years of psychical research have taught usanything, it is that the mind is able to ignore some of the laws of nature. Forexample, in our natural world, time flows onward, in the words of the hymn,“like an ever-rolling stream,” and the future is hidden from us. Yet there arethousands of well-authenticated cases of people who have been able to glimpsethe future, in dreams, in visions, or in waking consciousness.22 [../Images/22.jpg] A caricature of Mesmer’s healing salon, with the tub thatcontained water and magnetized iron filings, which was believed to serve as thefocus for cures. [../Images/main-182.jpg] Mozart at the age of six, thearchetypal example of the young prodigy—he composed a symphony when he was onlyeight years old—whose extraordinary powers did not fade as he grew up, butcontinued and developed in his adult years.If you were a worm, and were made to crawl across an enormous chessboard, youwould soon begin to believe that one of the laws of nature is that black alwaysfollows white, and white follows black. If someone explained to you that blackdoes not follow white, or vice versa, and that they were both present at thesame time, you would find it incomprehensible.We human beings are accustomed to day following night, in a predictable order;and because, like the worm, we cannot see ahead, we believe this to be a law ofnature. Yet the evidence of hundreds of prophets and seers seems to demonstrateotherwise; yesterday and today and tomorrow somehow exist simultaneously.Another tale of mathematical genius may help us to understand this. In 1837, a10-year-old Sicilian peasant boy was brought to Paris to be examined by greatmathematicians; his name was Vito Mangiamele. The mathematician Arago asked him,“What satisfies the condition that its cube plus five times its square is equalto 42 times itself increased by 40?” It took Vito less than a minute to producethe correct answer: five.Arago complained that the teachers of Vito Mangiamele had kept secret themethods he used to work out these problems. But if we think about it for amoment, we can see that this is absurd. Vito was not applying some simpleformula to solve his problem. What he did was somehow to envisage the wholesystem, to see it whole in his mind’s eye. If you or I try to work it out in ourheads, we quickly realize that this is the trouble. We can’t envisage it. As westruggle with one aspect of the problem, we forget all the others. Vito couldsee the whole problem as if it were a kind of drawing traced in the air, inthree dimensions.[../Images/main-185.jpg] Above: George Parker Bidder, a stonemason’s son born in1806, who became famous as a calculating prodigy, answering (in about a minute)such queries as “Suppose a city to be illuminated with 9999 lamps, each lamp toconsume 1 pint of oil every 4 hours, how many gallons of oil would they consumein 40 years?” The correct answer was 109,489,050 gallons.Imagine, for example, that someone drew a donkey’s tail on a blackboard, thenits head, then its back, its belly and two front legs, and then asked: “Whathave I left out?” Any child could say: “Its hind legs.” Yet if the same persononly described the parts of the donkey verbally, it would be rather moredifficult to pinpoint the missing part of its anatomy—particularly if you were apoor visualizer. For most of us, a mathematical problem is something to be dealtwith in sequence; we relate the numbers to each other as we are directed bycertain words such as “equals” and “times itself,” using a linear process. ButVito was somehow able mentally to draw the problem in the air and see its parts,so that the unknown quantity, the missing part, was immediately obvious.When we try to solve a problem of this kind we realize that the mind itselfseems to be weighed down by a kind of gravity. We are like the worm on thechessboard. We may try to make our thought take wing; but except in rare momentsit can only crawl on its belly. By some odd freak, Vito was free of thislimitation—at least where mathematics was concerned.The same thing seems to be true for people with powers of prophecy, offoreseeing the future. The gravitational force that holds most of us in thepresent moment seems to permit them to escape. They float up into the air like aballoon, and can see what lies ahead.Most human beings cannot even begin to imagine a universe in which all eventshave already taken place. Yet the evidence of seers and prophets suggests thatthis is what the universe is really like. Time is a kind of illusion, producedby our worm’s-eye view.[../Images/23.jpg] Viola Olerich, born in Iowa in 1897. As her “examinationcertificate” points out, before she was two she knew 2500 nouns.The same may be true of other laws of nature. If Ingo Swann really visitedMercury in eight minutes, then space, like time, is also a kind of illusion. Ifpoltergeists can make solid objects pass through walls, then the laws of matterare less rigid than we assumed.Yet these suggestions still leave a great deal unexplained. Puharich’s book, inparticular, seems to defy all attempts at rationalization. But let us look at ita little more closely.Most of the strange happenings described by Puharich conform to the pattern ofpoltergeist activity. Objects appear and disappear or fly through the air,metals crack or bend, items of furniture move of their own accord. But metallicvoices speaking from a tape recorder, and sightings of flying saucers, are adifferent matter.It is worth comparing Puharich’s experiences with those of Jesse Lasky, theHollywood screen writer. In October 1975, Jesse Lasky and his wife Pat went to aLondon bookshop where Uri was signing copies of My Story. Jesse introducedhimself; Uri looked at him sharply and asked them to wait until after he hadfinished the book-signing session. After bending a woman’s car key, Uri said,“Look at your keys, everybody.” Pat opened her handbag and discovered that herdoor key was bent. Afterward, Uri returned with them to their apartment. Hedeclined to bend a key, saying he was too tired, but when the Laskys’ attractivedaughter Lisa arrived, he seemed to be revitalized, and instantly bent a thickmetal spoon, placing himself against a refrigerator door to draw power. On thesecond occasion when he visited their home, there was a pinging noise like abullet, and an American Indian-style silver button bounced on the kitchencounter in front of Trina, Uri’s secretary. It came from a card in Pat Lasky’sbedroom drawer, three rooms away; Uri knew nothing of its existence and had notbeen into the room. At the time the button flew across the kitchen, he wasstanding with a bottle of milk in one hand and a tin of cocoa in the other. Thedrawer in the bedroom was found closed, and inside it was the card, with onebutton missing. They calculated the path of the button, and concluded that ithad traveled through three walls.(When I saw him in Barcelona, Uri told me that a television camera had actuallyfilmed an apport—a watch—under laboratory conditions, and that when the film wasprojected in slow motion, it revealed that the watch appeared and disappearedseveral times as it fell through the air.)A week before the Laskys met Uri, a lever in their fuse box disconnected itselfseven times in quick succession; an electrician could find nothing wrong. Animportant book disappeared, then reappeared—after a search—under a chair thatthey had searched several times. One evening some months later, the lights of ahouse where they were staying continually turned on and off in an unaccountablemanner. On the following morning they received a transatlantic phone call fromUri; and they suspected that these events might be related.There would be no point in detailing the many other events that occurred duringUri’s visits to the Laskys; they conform to the same pattern. There were nometallic voices, no messages from space.It is interesting to speculate on why Uri “took” to the Laskys so quickly—infact, on first meeting them. He took to Puharich in much the same way. TheLaskys radiate an air of warmth and sympathy. Jesse, like Puharich, is a man inhis 60s, something of a father figure. The Laskys had no doubt whatsoever aboutUri’s powers before they went to his book signing. Significantly, Jesse’saccount of their friendship begins: “In October of 1975, we felt a compulsion tosee Uri in person ... ” The word “compulsion” suggests that they felt literallydrawn toward him. Moreover, Uri’s powers seem to have been unusually activewhenever he was in their company. We have already noted that his powers tend to“dry up” in front of a hostile audience; even my sympathetic but unpsychicpresence seems to affect them adversely—as in the case of our unsuccessfultelepathy attempts in Barcelona. On the other hand, certain people seem tostimulate his powers, as if their subconscious minds provide some kind of energyor support. Could this explain that immediate intimacy that sprang up betweenUri and the Laskys?[../Images/24.jpg] Geller with Jesse Lasky and his wife Pat, shown here wearingon a chain one of the keys bent by Geller—although in this particular case itwas in her handbag at the time, and Uri had not actually touched it.Pat Lasky made an observation that may be relevant to Uri’s powers. She normallydiets fairly carefully, but while the Laskys were seeing Uri, this proved to beunnecessary. She ate what she liked and still lost weight. She commented thatother people who have spent time with Uri have had the same experience. It is asif Uri is drawing energy from people with whom he establishes a certain rapport.Assuming that a similar close rapport existed from the start between Uri andPuharich, and assuming that Puharich was already predisposed to regard Uri as apossible messenger from “the Nine,” it hardly seems surprising that theincidents of their early acquaintance included messages from space and sightingsof UFOs.Of course, it is possible that a real, objective UFO did appear, as Puharichrelated in Uri. There are far too many sightings reported around the world todismiss them all as illusion. Yet Puharich admits: “I recognize the possibilitythat there may not have been a spaceship there at all. I am aware that the threemen in the command car saw nothing because there was nothing to see; I recognizethat the three of us certainly had the image of a spaceship in our minds ...That is to say, the spaceship could have been some kind of collective telepathicimage.The psychologist Carl Gustav Jung had an interesting suggestion about UFOs. Hebelieved that they were neither real nor imaginary, but some kind of psychicprojection of the human subconscious. In our materialistic age, he suggested,many people experience a longing for messianic visions. But UFOs may not be an“hallucination” in the ordinary sense; they might be seen by many people at thesame time, some of them wholly skeptical or uninterested. A symbol from the“collective unconscious” would somehow, in such a case, find its way into theobjective world. It would be real in somewhat the same sense as a pictureprojected onto a movie screen is real.It seems clear that Puharich—if not Geller—has a tendency toward “messianicexpectations.” This reinforces the suspicion that he may have been asresponsible as Uri for the curious events described in this book.The word “magic” is frequently used in connection with Uri Geller, though neverby respectable scientists. In some ways, it is not wholly inappropriate. Magicis basically a belief that the known laws of nature—of physics, inparticular—are not the only laws of our universe, and that man can make use of acompletely different set of laws. The concept of the “true will” is particularlyimportant. In our everyday dealings with the physical world, we use a clumsy,physical kind of will. A scientist would say that wishful thinking could have nopossible effect on the real world. Yet many people have had the experience ofwanting something intensely, of directing the whole will toward it, and ofeventually getting it, as if by the operation of some unknown law of attraction.The poet Robert Graves, for example, asserts that many young men use a kind ofunconscious sorcery in seducing young women. This, say occultists, is theoperation of the “true will,” a deeper will than our ordinary state of volition.Sometimes this true will operates on a purely physical level. William Jamescites the example of a football player who plays the game with technicalexpertise, but who one day seems to be carried away and achieves a strangeperfection so that everything he does turns out right. Again, this is the truewill in action.Human beings are, on the whole, passive creatures: a little discouragementupsets us; a dull Monday morning depresses us; a few setbacks destroy our willto win. Yet the right kind of stimulus can call forth remarkablepotentialities—as in the case of the colonel who lived on brandy during thesiege, or that of a mother lifting a heavy vehicle off her child.Great artists, great performers, great sportsmen, may spend years of disciplinelearning how to tap the power of true will, and so raise a technically brilliantperformance to the level of genius. By contrast, some people seem to be bornwith the ability to contact the true will. Hitler struck people as ratherordinary in personal conversation; yet in front of an audience someextraordinary power seemed to emanate from him. Many religious leaders havepossessed this power in a different form. If such men have not achieved theirpower by long and painful discipline, they may sometimes be dangerous—as in thecase of Hitler.Gifted psychics seem to form a subgroup within this category. They create animpression of freakishness. Reading of telepaths and mediums, one sometimesfeels as if two lines in a telephone exchange have been accidentally crossed sothat normal conversations get interrupted by unwelcome voices—or as if theinsulation has worn away from an electric wire, so that unexpected shortcircuits occur. People under stress may become telepathic for a short period,Rudolf Steiner, the founder of the Anthroposophical Society, told a story of aGerman pilot in World War I who began to know in advance which of his companionswould be killed on missions. This knowledge thoroughly unnerved him. Steineradvised him to drink wine; when he followed this prescription, the insightsvanished. Significantly, Uri does not drink, because he feels this would damagehis powers. Peter Hurkos, as we have seen, gained his powers of second sightafter serious concussion. Uri’s powers may originate in the electric shock hereceived as a child.It may be significant that most normal human beings feel either bored orrepelled by the thought of paranormal powers. If we examine the matterobjectively, we have to admit that the powers of Daniel Dunglas Home or EusapiaPaladino are as undeniable as those of Mozart or Einstein. Yet we instinctivelyfeel that the powers of Mozart and Einstein are important and relevant to us ashuman beings; those of Home and Paladino are unimportant and irrelevant.[../Images/main-186.jpg] Robert Leftwich, a noted English dowser, who believeshe has simply developed latent powers that many people might possess if theywished to try.If this is true, it suggests that humans may be intended, or programed bynature, to evolve along certain lines, and that such powers as communicationwith the dead, or thought reading, or metal bending, do not lie along the directpath of evolution. The occultist Aleister Crowley, sometimes called the “GreatBeast,” once said that the aim of the magician is to become a god. But if youasked most people to name a godlike human being, Crowley is the last name thatwould occur to them; they would be more likely to mention Michelangelo, Leonardoda Vinci, or Beethoven. True greatness, in the eyes of most thoughtful people,is the spirit’s attempt to transcend human triviality and self-absorption.This is one of the reasons why the majority of people are still indifferent topsychic matters in general and to extraordinary individuals such as Uri Gellerin particular. But there is also a less creditable reason. If you ask a roomfulof people how many believe in ghosts, most of them will say they do not; speakto them individually, and most will admit the possibility. There is a fear ofbeing thought credulous, a desire to maintain a reputation for sturdy commonsense.Yet if the powers of a Peter Hurkos or Matthew Manning or Uri Geller aregenuine, they may be of considerable importance to the development of the humanrace. Only a fool would reject the assistance of something that could make hiseveryday life easier and more agreeable. And there are many ways in which we canmake practical use of psychic powers. Uri Geller’s ability to dowse for metalsfrom an airplane and Croiset’s ability to find missing people are ratherspectacular examples of the use of psychic powers. But there are hundreds ofdowsers who, when they lose something, do not spend hours searching for it, butsimply allow their dowsing rods or pendulums to guide them to the missingobject. There are hundreds of sensitives who can diagnose an illness by layingtheir hands on the patient, or simply looking at a sample of his handwriting.Andrija Puharich cites a well-documented story of a workman who was buried whena trench collapsed, and succeeded in sending a telepathic message of his plightto a workmate at another site. I myself once used telepathy to locate my family,when we had become separated in a large park—by making my mind a blank andsimply allowing my feet to take me to them. All these are examples of powersthat most human beings could develop and utilize.[../Images/main-187.jpg] The “sleeping prophet” Edgar Cayce, who over a longperiod was apparently able to diagnose the illnesses of people not present, andclairvoyantly prescribe treatment, which—according to his patients—was oftencompletely successful. [../Images/main-188.jpg] American psychic Jeane Dixon,who foretold the crash that killed Dag Hammerskjold, then United NationsSecretary General, and predicted the assassination of President Kennedy.In most rural areas such powers are generally accepted; country doctors, forexample, know that a wart charmer can remove warts more quickly and efficientlythan they can with their scalpels and caustic soda. Whether this is due tosuggestion or hypnosis is beside the point; it works. It would work equally wellin cities, but the mental attitude of city-dwellers is somehow hostile to theidea. Accustomed to the use of all kinds of mechanical aids, they find the ideaof “magic” disturbing and somehow irrelevant.The problem is that humans have become machine-minded. Surrounded by complextechnology, we have become passive in the face of our artificial existence. Thepassivity, the sense of helplessness, breeds neurosis that expresses itself in avariety of disturbing symptoms: urban guerrilla warfare, a soaring crime rate,and a worldwide drug problem. This collective neurosis is one reason for theoccult revival and the current interest in all kinds of messiahs and gurus: manypeople feel that man ought to return to the task of finding himself.In this sense, Geller may be a more relevant figure than most contemporary cultleaders. In insisting that anyone could develop the power to read minds and bendmetal, he represents a healthy and sane individualism. His power over metalcould be regarded as a symbol of the power of mind over the material from whichall machines are made, just as his power over clocks seems to be a symbolicdefiance of time. The skepticism he arouses is partly an emotional resistance tothe challenge of developing one’s own spiritual powers. Geller represents thebelief that man is an altogether less passive and helpless creature than most ofus assume. And he represents a flat denial of the current nightmare—dramatizedso effectively in the film 2001, A Space Odyssey—that man will one day besuperseded by computers. For Geller, the computer remains the servant, one thatcan be immobilized or regalvanized by the curious powers of the subconsciousmind. A civilization that accepted the powers and ideas of Uri Geller would be agreat deal healthier than a civilization that accepts the gloomy predictions ofevery “scientific” futurologist.The question of Uri’s own future is an interesting one. When he left Israel forGermany in 1972, it must have seemed that his possibilities were endless. Yetthe trajectory of his career continued to rise only for another 18 months; thenthe anti-success mechanism began to operate. The problem was that he had becomea household word. No psychic had ever achieved so much internationalpublicity—not even Daniel Dunglas Home. The only “magician” of comparablecelebrity was Houdini; and he made the sad discovery that he had to devise moreand more sensational effects to hold public interest. This, unfortunately, isthe law that governs notoriety. Uri’s problem, therefore, has been to try toescape this vicious circle, and to find a new direction for development. Butwhich direction?[../Images/main-189.jpg] Where does Uri Geller go from here? On the cover of hisrecord is an artist’s expressive interpretation of Geller’s powers, the birth ofa vigorous new force.There are obviously a number of possibilities. The most straightforward would beclose cooperation with scientists in an attempt to understand the source of hispowers. Are they electrical or magnetic, or (as Professor John Taylor believes)in some way muscular? If they spring from his unconscious mind, could they beexplored by modern techniques of depth psychology?There is also the possibility of deliberately developing these powers. In hischildhood, they were limited to reading his mother’s mind and influencingwatches. Later, he discovered that he could read other minds, and bend metals.More recently, he has developed powers of dowsing and psychometry, and evenexplored the possibility of healing. The episode of the moving saltcellar,witnessed by the Esquire reporter, also suggests that he may possess unusuallystrong powers of telekinesis of the type practiced by Felicia Parise, amongothers.There is another possibility—one that holds great promise of self-fulfillmentnot only for Uri himself, but also for others. All major religious teachers havetaught that man’s powers, both physical and psychical, can be developed andcontrolled by discipline, and that the most effective disciplines are those thataim at control of his inner being. The philosopher Gurdjieff, who himselfpossessed remarkable psychic powers, taught that man consists of “personality”(the “outer man”) and “essence” (the “inner man”). Psychic powers, he declared,are a mere byproduct of the development of essence.Geller recognizes the seriousness and importance of the challenge. He alsorecognizes that the development of his powers has so far proceeded in a ratherhaphazard way. In a life of constant travel and performances, he has had noopportunity to try to explore that inner space in which his powers probablyoriginate. The next stage of his career, the stage of self-exploration, willprovide him with that opportunity. When I spoke to him about it, he seemed bothattracted and alarmed by the prospect.What is clear is that Uri Geller is in an ideal position to test the truth ofthe assertion that psychic powers can be increased by inner discipline. In anage that has become obsessed with questions of the psyche and expansion ofconsciousness, he could help to provide the answers to some fundamentalquestions—and also, perhaps, become an important symbol of the search forself-knowledge and self-meaning."},{"pageContent":"PICTURE CREDITSKey to picture positions: (T) top (C) center (B) bottom; and in combinations,e.g. (TR) top right (BL) bottom left2 UPI Photo, New York4 © Aldus Books7 Ben Martin/Colorific9 UPI Photo, New York10 Psychic News11 © Yale Joel, 197412-17 Kadima Productions Inc.18-19 Ralph Crane/Camera Press20 (L) Bernhard Rudolph/Axel Springer Verlag AG20 (R) Joachim Voigt/Axel Springer Verlag AG21 (R) Kadima Productions Inc.23 © Yale Joel, 197424 BBC Photo Library25 John L.
