The book sets out to explain nothing less than why human beingsbehave the way they do, and, astonishingly, Malcolm Gladwell has the smarts andpanache to pull it off.”— Jeffrey Toobin, author of A Vast Conspiracy“With passion and eloquence, Gladwell argues for the proposition that minoralterations, carefully conceived and adeptly enacted, can produce majorconsequences for individuals, organizations, and communities.”— Barry Glassner, Los Angeles Times Book Review“Gladwell is intelligent, articulate, well-informed, and thought-provoking. . .. The Tipping Point is full of interesting stuff.”— Observer (UK)“It’s hard not to be persuaded by Gladwell’s thesis. Not only does he assemble afascinating mix of facts to support his theory — from the impact of Paul Revereto a rash of suicides in Micronesia — but he also manages to weave everythinginto a cohesive explanation of human behavior. What’s more, we appreciate theoptimism of a theory that supports, as another pundit once called it, the powerof one.”— Diane Brady, Business Week“Having read this book I have thought deeply about my own business and can nowsee much more value in small-scale below-the-line activity.

While The Tipping Point is largely a popularization ofearlier scientific work in epidemiology, psychology, sociology, and groupdynamics, it is valuable because it synthesizes this knowledge, bringinginsights gleaned from these disparate fields together and applying them to animpressive array of contemporary social behaviors and cultural trends.

Sales were down to 30,000pairs a year, mostly to backwoods outlets and small town family stores.Wolverine, the company that makes Hush Puppies, was thinking of phasing out theshoes that made them famous. But then something strange happened. At a fashionshoot, two Hush Puppies executives—Owen Baxter and Geoffrey Lewis—ran into astylist from New York who told them that the classic Hush Puppies had suddenlybecome hip in the clubs and bars of downtown Manhattan. “We were being told,”Baxter recalls, “that there were resale shops in the Village, in Soho, where theshoes were being sold. People were going to the Ma and Pa stores, the littlestores that still carried them, and buying them up.” Baxter and Lewis werebaffled at first. It made no sense to them that shoes that were so obviously outof fashion could make a comeback. “We were told that Isaac Mizrahi was wearingthe shoes himself,” Lewis says. “I think it’s fair to say that at the time wehad no idea who Isaac Mizrahi was.”By the fall of 1995, things began to happen in a rush. First the designer JohnBartlett called. He wanted to use Hush Puppies in his spring collection. Thenanother Manhattan designer, Anna Sui, called, wanting shoes for her show aswell. In Los Angeles, the designer Joel Fitzgerald put a twenty five footinflatable basset hound—the symbol of the Hush Puppies brand—on the roof of hisHollywood store and gutted an adjoining art gallery to turn it into a HushPuppies boutique. While he was still painting and putting up shelves, the actorPee wee Herman walked in and asked for a couple of pairs. “It was total word ofmouth,” Fitzgerald remembers.In 1995, the company sold 430,000 pairs of the classic Hush Puppies, and thenext year it sold four times that, and the year after that still more, untilHush Puppies were once again a staple of the wardrobe of the young Americanmale. In 1996, Hush Puppies won the prize for best accessory at the Council ofFashion Designers awards dinner at Lincoln Center, and the president of the firmstood up on the stage with Calvin Klein and Donna Karan and accepted an awardfor an achievement that—as he would be the first to admit—his company had almostnothing to do with. Hush Puppies had suddenly exploded, and it all started witha handful of kids in the East Village and Soho.How did that happen? Those first few kids, whoever they were, weren’tdeliberately trying to promote Hush Puppies. They were wearing them preciselybecause no one else would wear them. Then the fad spread to two fashiondesigners who used the shoes to peddle something else—haute couture. The shoeswere an incidental touch. No one was trying to make Hush Puppies a trend. Yet,somehow, that’s exactly what happened. The shoes passed a certain point inpopularity and they tipped. How does a thirty dollar pair of shoes go from ahandful of downtown Manhattan hipsters and designers to every mall in America inthe space of two years?1.There was a time, not very long ago, in the desperately poor New York Cityneighborhoods of Brownsville and East New York, when the streets would turn intoghost towns at dusk. Ordinary working people wouldn’t walk on the sidewalks.Children wouldn’t ride their bicycles on the streets. Old folks wouldn’t sit onstoops and park benches. The drug trade ran so rampant and gang warfare was soubiquitous in that part of Brooklyn that most people would take to the safety oftheir apartment at nightfall. Police officers who served in Brownsville in the1980s and early 1990s say that, in those years, as soon as the sun went downtheir radios exploded with chatter between beat officers and their dispatchersover every conceivable kind of violent and dangerous crime. In 1992, there were2,154 murders in New York City and 626,182 serious crimes, with the weight ofthose crimes falling hardest in places like Brownsville and East New York. Butthen something strange happened. At some mysterious and critical point, thecrime rate began to turn. It tipped. Within five years, murders had dropped 64.3percent to 770 and total crimes had fallen by almost half to 355,893. InBrownsville and East New York, the sidewalks filled up again, the bicycles cameback, and old folks reappeared on the stoops. “There was a time when it wasn’tuncommon to hear rapid fire, like you would hear somewhere in the jungle inVietnam,” says Inspector Edward Messadri, who commands the police precinct inBrownsville. “I don’t hear the gunfire anymore.”The New York City police will tell you that what happened in New York was thatthe city’s policing strate gies dramatically improved. Criminologists point tothe decline of the crack trade and the aging of the population. Economists,meanwhile, say that the gradual improvement in the city’s economy over thecourse of the 1990s had the effect of employing those who might otherwise havebecome criminals. These are the conventional explanations for the rise and fallof social problems, but in the end none is any more satisfying than thestatement that kids in the East Village caused the Hush Puppies revival. Thechanges in the drug trade, the population, and the economy are all long termtrends, happening all over the country. They don’t explain why crime plunged inNew York City so much more than in other cities around the country, and theydon’t explain why it all happened in such an extraordinarily short time. As forthe improvements made by the police, they are important too. But there is apuzzling gap between the scale of the changes in policing and the size of theeffect on places like Brownsville and East New York. After all, crime didn’tjust slowly ebb in New York as conditions gradually improved. It plummeted. Howcan a change in a handful of economic and social indices cause murder rates tofall by two thirds in five years?2.The Tipping Point is the biography of an idea, and the idea is very simple. Itis that the best way to understand the emergence of fashion trends, the ebb andflow of crime waves, or, for that matter, the transformation of unknown booksinto bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or the phenomena of word ofmouth, or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life isto think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviorsspread just like viruses do.The rise of Hush Puppies and the fall of New York’s crime rate are textbookexamples of epidemics in action. Although they may sound as if they don’t havevery much in common, they share a basic, underlying pattern. First of all, theyare clear examples of contagious behavior. No one took out an advertisement andtold people that the traditional Hush Puppies were cool and they should startwearing them. Those kids simply wore the shoes when they went to clubs or cafesor walked the streets of downtown New York, and in so doing exposed other peopleto their fashion sense. They infected them with the Hush Puppies “virus.”The crime decline in New York surely happened the same way. It wasn’t that somehuge percentage of would be murderers suddenly sat up in 1993 and decided not tocommit any more crimes. Nor was it that the police managed magically tointervene in a huge percentage of situations that would otherwise have turneddeadly. What happened is that the small number of people in the small number ofsituations in which the police or the new social forces had some impact startedbehaving very differently, and that behavior somehow spread to other would becriminals in similar situations. Somehow a large number of people in New Yorkgot “infected” with an anti crime virus in a short time.The second distinguishing characteristic of these two examples is that in bothcases little changes had big effects. All of the possible reasons for why NewYork’s crime rate dropped are changes that happened at the margin; they wereincremental changes. The crack trade leveled off. The population got a littleolder. The police force got a little better. Yet the effect was dramatic. So toowith Hush Puppies. How many kids are we talking about who began wearing theshoes in downtown Manhattan? Twenty? Fifty? One hundred—at the most? Yet theiractions seem to have single handedly started an international fashion trend.Finally, both changes happened in a hurry. They didn’t build steadily andslowly. It is instructive to look at a chart of the crime rate in New York Cityfrom, say, the mid 1960s to the late 1990s. It looks like a giant arch. In 1965,there were 200,000 crimes in the city and from that point on the number begins asharp rise, doubling in two years and continuing almost unbroken until it hits650,000 crimes a year in the mid 1970s. It stays steady at that level for thenext two decades, before plunging downward in 1992 as sharply as it rose thirtyyears earlier. Crime did not taper off. It didn’t gently decelerate. It hit acertain point and jammed on the brakes.These three characteristics—one, contagiousness; two, the fact that littlecauses can have big effects; and three, that change happens not gradually but atone dramatic moment —are the same three principles that define how measles movesthrough a grade school classroom or the flu attacks every winter. Of the three,the third trait—the idea that epidemics can rise or fall in one dramaticmoment—is the most important, because it is the principle that makes sense ofthe first two and that permits the greatest insight into why modern changehappens the way it does. The name given to that one dramatic moment in anepidemic when everything can change all at once is the Tipping Point.3.A world that follows the rules of epidemics is a very different place from theworld we think we live in now. Think, for a moment, about the concept ofcontagiousness. If I say that word to you, you think of colds and the flu orperhaps something very dangerous like HIV or Ebola. We have, in our minds, avery specific, biological notion of what contagiousness means. But if there canbe epidemics of crime or epidemics of fashion, there must be all kinds of thingsjust as contagious as viruses. Have you ever thought about yawning, forinstance? Yawning is a surprisingly powerful act. Just because you read the word“yawning” in the previous two sentences—and the two additional “yawns” in thissentence—a good number of you will probably yawn within the next few minutes.Even as I’m writing this, I’ve yawned twice. If you’re reading this in a publicplace, and you’ve just yawned, chances are that a good proportion of everyonewho saw you yawn is now yawning too, and a good proportion of the peoplewatching the people who watched you yawn are now yawning as well, and on and on,in an ever widening, yawning circle.Yawning is incredibly contagious. I made some of you reading this yawn simply bywriting the word “yawn.” The people who yawned when they saw you yawn,meanwhile, were infected by the sight of you yawning—which is a second kind ofcontagion. They might even have yawned if they only heard you yawn, becauseyawning is also aurally contagious: if you play an audiotape of a yawn to blindpeople, they’ll yawn too. And finally, if you yawned as you read this, did thethought cross your mind—however unconsciously and fleetingly—that you might betired? I suspect that for some of you it did, which means that yawns can also beemotionally contagious. Simply by writing the word, I can plant a feeling inyour mind. Can the flu virus do that? Contagiousness, in other words, is anunexpected property of all kinds of things, and we have to remember that, if weare to recognize and diagnose epidemic change.The second of the principles of epidemics—that little changes can somehow havebig effects—is also a fairly radical notion. We are, as humans, heavilysocialized to make a kind of rough approximation between cause and effect. If wewant to communicate a strong emotion, if we want to convince someone that, say,we love them, we realize that we need to speak passionately and forthrightly. Ifwe want to break bad news to someone, we lower our voices and choose our wordscarefully. We are trained to think that what goes into any transaction orrelationship or system must be directly related, in intensity and dimension, towhat comes out. Consider, for example, the following puzzle. I give you a largepiece of paper, and I ask you to fold it over once, and then take that foldedpaper and fold it over again, and then again, and again, until you have refoldedthe original paper 50 times. How tall do you think the final stack is going tobe? In answer to that question, most people will fold the sheet in their mind’seye, and guess that the pile would be as thick as a phone book or, if they’rereally courageous, they’ll say that it would be as tall as a refrigerator. Butthe real answer is that the height of the stack would approximate the distanceto the sun. And if you folded it over one more time, the stack would be as highas the distance to the sun and back. This is an example of what in mathematicsis called a geometric progression. Epidemics are another example of geometricprogression: when a virus spreads through a population, it doubles and doublesagain, until it has (figuratively) grown from a single sheet of paper all theway to the sun in fifty steps. As human beings we have a hard time with thiskind of progression, because the end result—the effect—seems far out ofproportion to the cause. To appreciate the power of epidemics, we have toabandon this expectation about proportionality. We need to prepare ourselves forthe possibility that sometimes big changes follow from small events, and thatsometimes these changes can happen very quickly.This possibility of sudden change is at the center of the idea of the TippingPoint and might well be the hardest of all to accept. The expression first cameinto popular use in the 1970s to describe the flight to the suburbs of whitesliving in the older cities of the American Northeast. When the number ofincoming African Americans in a particular neighborhood reached a certainpoint—20 percent, say—sociologists observed that the community would “tip”: mostof the remaining whites would leave almost immediately. The Tipping Point is themoment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point. There was a TippingPoint for violent crime in New York in the early 1990s, and a Tipping Point forthe reemergence of Hush Puppies, just as there is a Tipping Point for theintroduction of any new technology. Sharp introduced the first low priced faxmachine in 1984, and sold about 80,000 of those machines in the United States inthat first year. For the next three years, businesses slowly and steadily boughtmore and more faxes, until, in 1987, enough people had faxes that it made sensefor everyone to get a fax. Nineteen eighty seven was the fax machine TippingPoint. A million machines were sold that year, and by 1989 two million newmachines had gone into operation. Cellular phones have followed the sametrajectory. Through the 1990s, they got smaller and cheaper, and service gotbetter until 1998, when the technology hit a Tipping Point and suddenly everyonehad a cell phone. (For an explanation of the mathematics of Tipping Points, seethe Endnotes.)All epidemics have Tipping Points. Jonathan Crane, a sociologist at theUniversity of Illinois, has looked at the effect the number of role models in acommunity—the professionals, managers, teachers whom the Census Bureau hasdefined as “high status”—has on the lives of teenagers in the same neighborhood.He found little difference in pregnancy rates or school drop out rates inneighborhoods of between 40 and 5 percent of high status workers. But when thenumber of profes sionals dropped below 5 percent, the problems exploded. Forblack schoolchildren, for example, as the percentage of high status workersfalls just 2.2 percentage points—from 5.6 percent to 3.4 percent—drop out ratesmore than double. At the same Tipping Point, the rates of childbearing forteenaged girls—which barely move at all up to that point—nearly double. Weassume, intuitively, that neighborhoods and social problems decline in some kindof steady progression. But sometimes they may not decline steadily at all; atthe Tipping Point, schools can lose control of their students, and family lifecan disintegrate all at once.I remember once as a child seeing our family’s puppy encounter snow for thefirst time. He was shocked and delighted and overwhelmed, wagging his tailnervously, sniffing about in this strange, fluffy substance, whimpering with themystery of it all. It wasn’t much colder on the morning of his first snowfallthan it had been the evening before. It might have been 34 degrees the previousevening, and now it was 31 degrees. Almost nothing had changed, in other words,yet—and this was the amazing thing—everything had changed. Rain had becomesomething entirely different. Snow! We are all, at heart, gradualists, ourexpectations set by the steady passage of time. But the world of the TippingPoint is a place where the unexpected becomes expected,where radical change ismore than possibility. It is—contrary to all our expectations—a certainty.In pursuit of this radical idea, I’m going to take you to Baltimore, to learnfrom the epidemic of syphilis in that city. I’m going to introduce threefascinating kinds of people I call Mavens, Connectors, and Salesmen, who play acritical role in the word of mouth epidemics that dictate our tastes and trendsand fashions. I’ll take you to the set of the children’s shows Sesame Street andBlue’s Clues and into the fascinating world of the man who helped to create theColumbia Record Club to look at how messages can be structured to have themaximum possible impact on all their audience. I’ll take you to a high techcompany in Delaware to talk about the Tipping Points that govern group life andto the subways of New York City to understand how the crime epidemic was broughtto an end there. The point of all of this is to answer two simple questions thatlie at the heart of what we would all like to accomplish as educators, parents,marketers, business people, and policymakers. Why is it that some ideas orbehaviors or products start epidemics and others don’t? And what can we do todeliberately start and control positive epidemics of our own?"},{"pageContent":"ONE [TippingPoint_toc.html#chap_1]The Three Rules of EpidemicsIn the mid 1990s, the city of Baltimore was attacked by an epidemic of syphilis.In the space of a year, from 1995 to 1996, the number of children born with thedisease increased by 500 percent. If you look at Baltimore’s syphilis rates on agraph, the line runs straight for years and then, when it hits 1995, risesalmost at a right angle.What caused Baltimore’s syphilis problem to tip? According to the Centers forDisease Control, the problem was crack cocaine. Crack is known to cause adramatic increase in the kind of risky sexual behavior that leads to the spreadof things like HIV and syphilis. It brings far more people into poor areas tobuy drugs, which then increases the likelihood that they will take an infectionhome with them to their own neighborhood. It changes the patterns of socialconnections between neighborhoods. Crack, the CDC said, was the little push thatthe syphilis problem needed to turn into a raging epidemic.John Zenilman of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, an expert on sexuallytransmitted diseases, has another explanation: the breakdown of medical servicesin the city’s poorest neighborhoods. “In 1990–91, we had thirty six thousandpatient visits at the city’s sexually transmitted disease clinics,” Zenilmansays. “Then the city decided to gradually cut back because of budgetaryproblems. The number of clinicians [medical personnel] went from seventeen toten. The number of physicians went from three to essentially nobody. Patientvisits dropped to twenty one thousand. There also was a similar drop in theamount of field outreach staff. There was a lot of politics—things that used tohappen, like computer upgrades, didn’t happen. It was a worst case scenario ofcity bureaucracy not functioning. They would run out of drugs.”When there were 36,000 patient visits a year in the STD clinics of Baltimore’sinner city, in other words, the disease was kept in equilibrium. At some pointbetween 36,000 and 21,000 patient visits a year, according to Zenilman, thedisease erupted. It began spilling out of the inner city, up the streets andhighways that connect those neighborhoods to the rest of the city. Suddenly,people who might have been infectious for a week before getting treated were nowgoing around infecting others for two or three or four weeks before they gotcured. The breakdown in treatment made syphilis a much bigger issue than it hadbeen before.There is a third theory, which belongs to John Potterat, one of the country’sleading epidemiologists. His culprits are the physical changes in those yearsaffecting East and West Baltimore, the heavily depressed neighborhoods on eitherside of Baltimore’s downtown, where the syphilis problem was centered. In themid 1990s, he points out, the city of Baltimore embarked on a highly publicizedpolicy of dynamiting the old 1960s style public housing high rises in East andWest Baltimore. Two of the most publicized demolitions—Lexington Terrace in WestBaltimore and Lafayette Courts in East Baltimore—were huge projects, housinghundreds of families, that served as centers for crime and infectious disease.At the same time, people began to move out of the old row houses in East andWest Baltimore, as those began to deteriorate as well.“It was absolutely striking,” Potterat says, of the first time he toured Eastand West Baltimore. “Fifty percent of the row houses were boarded up, and therewas also a process where they destroyed the projects. What happened was a kindof hollowing out. This fueled the diaspora. For years syphilis had been confinedto a specific region of Baltimore, within highly confined sociosexual networks.The housing dislocation process served to move these people to other parts ofBaltimore, and they took their syphilis and other behaviors with them.”What is interesting about these three explanations is that none of them is atall dramatic. The CDC thought that crack was the problem. But it wasn’t as ifcrack came to Baltimore for the first time in 1995. It had been there for years.What they were saying is that there was a subtle increase in the severity of thecrack problem in the mid 1990s, and that change was enough to set off thesyphilis epidemic. Zenilman, likewise, wasn’t saying that the STD clinics inBaltimore were shut down. They were simply scaled back, the number of clinicianscut from seventeen to ten. Nor was Potterat saying that all Baltimore washollowed out. All it took, he said, was the demolition of a handful of housingprojects and the abandonment of homes in key downtown neighborhoods to sendsyphilis over the top. It takes only the smallest of changes to shatter anepidemic’s equilibrium.The second, and perhaps more interesting, fact about these explanations is thatall of them are describing a very different way of tipping an epidemic. The CDCis talking about the overall context for the disease—how the introduction andgrowth of an addictive drug can so change the environment of a city that it cancause a disease to tip. Zenilman is talking about the disease itself. When theclinics were cut back, syphilis was given a second life. It had been an acuteinfection. It was now a chronic infection. It had become a lingering problemthat stayed around for weeks. Potterat, for his part, was focused on the peoplewho were carrying syphilis. Syphilis, he was saying, was a disease carried by acertain kind of person in Baltimore—a very poor, probably drug using, sexuallyactive individual. If that kind of person was suddenly transported from his orher old neighborhood to a new one—to a new part of town, where syphilis hadnever been a problem before—the disease would have an opportunity to tip.There is more than one way to tip an epidemic, in other words. Epidemics are afunction of the people who transmit infectious agents, the infectious agentitself, and the environment in which the infectious agent is operating. And whenan epidemic tips, when it is jolted out of equilibrium, it tips becausesomething has happened, some change has occurred in one (or two or three) ofthose areas. These three agents of change I call the Law of the Few, theStickiness Factor, and the Power of Context.1.When we say that a handful of East Village kids started the Hush Puppiesepidemic, or that the scattering of the residents of a few housing projects wassufficient to start Baltimore’s syphilis epidemic, what we are really saying isthat in a given process or system some people matter more than others. This isnot, on the face of it, a particularly radical notion. Economists often talkabout the 80/20 Principle, which is the idea that in any situation roughly 80percent of the “work” will be done by 20 percent of the participants. In mostsocieties, 20 percent of criminals commit 80 percent of crimes. Twenty percentof motorists cause 80 percent of all accidents. Twenty percent of beer drinkersdrink 80 percent of all beer. When it comes to epidemics, though, thisdisproportionality becomes even more extreme: a tiny percentage of people do themajority of the work.Potterat, for example, once did an analysis of a gonorrhea epidemic in ColoradoSprings, Colorado, looking at everyone who came to a public health clinic fortreatment of the disease over the space of six months. He found that about halfof all the cases came, essentially, from four neighborhoods representing about 6percent of the geographic area of the city. Half of those in that 6 percent, inturn, were socializing in the same six bars. Potterat then interviewed 768people in that tiny subgroup and found that 600 of them either didn’t givegonorrhea to anyone else or gave it to only one other person. These people hecalled nontransmitters. The ones causing the epidemic to grow—the ones who wereinfecting two and three and four and five others with their disease—were theremaining 168. In other words, in all of the city of Colorado Springs—a town ofwell in excess of 100,000 people—the epidemic of gonorrhea tipped because of theactivities of 168 people living in four small neighborhoods and basicallyfrequenting the same six bars.Who were those 168 people? They aren’t like you or me. They are people who goout every night, people who have vastly more sexual partners than the norm,people whose lives and behavior are well outside of the ordinary. In the mid1990s, for example, in the pool halls and roller skating rinks of East St.Louis, Missouri, there was a man named Darnell “Boss Man” McGee. He was big—oversix feet—and charming, a talented skater, who wowed young girls with hisexploits on the rink. His specialty was thirteen and fourteen year olds. Hebought them jewelry, took them for rides in his Cadillac, got them high oncrack, and had sex with them. Between 1995 and 1997, when he was shot dead by anunknown assailant, he slept with at least 100 women and—it turned outlater—infected at least 30 of them with HIV.In the same two year period, fifteen hundred miles away, near Buffalo, New York,another man—a kind of Boss Man clone—worked the distressed downtown streets ofJamestown. His name was Nushawn Williams, although he also went by the names“Face,” “Sly,” and “Shyteek.” Williams juggled dozens of girls, maintainingthree or four different apartments around the city, and all the while supportinghimself by smuggling drugs up from the Bronx. (As one epidemiologist familiarwith the case told me flatly, “The man was a genius. If I could get away withwhat Williams did, I’d never have to work a day again in my life.”) Williams,like Boss Man, was a charmer. He would buy his girlfriends roses, let them braidhis long hair, and host all night marijuana and malt liquor–fueled orgies at hisapartments. “I slept with him three or four times in one night,” one of hispartners remembered. “Me and him, we used to party together all thetime....After Face had sex, his friends would do it too. One would walk out, theother would walk in.” Williams is now in jail. He is known to have infected atleast sixteen of his former girlfriends with the AIDS virus. And most famously,in the book And the Band Played On Randy Shilts discusses at length the socalled Patient Zero of AIDS, the French Canadian flight attendant Gaetan Dugas,who claimed to have 2,500 sexual partners all over North America, and who waslinked to at least 40 of the earliest cases of AIDS in California and New York.These are the kinds of people who make epidemics of disease tip.Social epidemics work in exactly the same way. They are also driven by theefforts of a handful of exceptional people. In this case, it’s not sexualappetites that set them apart. It’s things like how sociable they are, or howenergetic or knowledgeable or influential among their peers. In the case of HushPuppies, the great mystery is how those shoes went from something worn by a fewfashion forward downtown Manhattan hipsters to being sold in malls across thecountry. What was the connection between the East Village and Middle America?The Law of the Few says the answer is that one of these exceptional people foundout about the trend, and through social connections and energy and enthusiasmand personality spread the word about Hush Puppies just as people like GaetanDugas and Nushawn Williams were able to spread HIV.2.In Baltimore, when the city’s public clinics suffered cutbacks, the nature ofthe syphilis affecting the city’s poor neighborhoods changed. It used to be anacute infection, something that most people could get treated fairly quicklybefore they had a chance to infect many others. But with the cutbacks, syphilisincreasingly became a chronic disease, and the disease’s carriers had three orfour or five times longer to pass on their infection. Epidemics tip because ofthe extraordinary efforts of a few select carriers. But they also sometimes tipwhen something happens to transform the epidemic agent itself.This is a well known principle in virology. The strains of flu that circulate atthe beginning of each winter’s flu epidemic are quite different from the strainsof flu that circulate at the end. The most famous flu epidemic of all—thepandemic of 1918—was first spotted in the spring of that year and was,relatively speaking, quite tame. But over the summer the virus underwent somestrange transformation and over the next six months ended up killing between 20and 40 million people worldwide. Nothing had changed in the way in which thevirus was being spread. But the virus had suddenly become much more deadly.The Dutch AIDS researcher Jaap Goudsmit argues that this same kind of dramatictransformation happened with HIV. Goudsmit’s work focuses on what is known asPneumocystis carinii pneumonia, or PCP. All of us carry the bacterium in ourbodies, probably since birth or immediately thereafter. In most of us it isharmless. Our immune systems keep it in check easily. But if something, such asHIV, wipes out our immune system, it becomes so uncontrollable that it can causea deadly form of pneumonia. PCP is so common among AIDS patients, in fact, thatit has come to be seen as an almost certain indication of the presence of thevirus. What Goudsmit did was go back in the medical literature and look forcases of PCP, and what he found is quite chilling. Just after World War II,beginning in the Baltic port city of Danzig and spreading through centralEurope, there was an epidemic of PCP that claimed the lives of thousands ofsmall children.Goudsmit has analyzed one of the towns hit hardest by the PCP epidemic, themining town of Heerlen in the Dutch province of Limburg. Heerlen had a traininghospital for midwives called the Kweekschool voor Vroedvrouwen, a single unit ofwhich—the so called Swedish barrack—was used in the 1950s as a special ward forunderweight or premature infants. Between June 1955 and July 1958, 81 infants inthe Swedish barrack came down with PCP and 24 died. Goudsmit thinks that thiswas an early HIV epidemic, and that somehow the virus got into the hospital, andwas spread from child to child by the then, apparently common, practice of usingthe same needles over and over again for blood transfusions or injections ofantibiotics. He writes:Most likely at least one adult—probably a coal miner from Poland,Czechoslovakia, or Italy—brought the virus to Limburg. This one adult could havedied from AIDS with little notice....He could have transmitted the virus to hiswife and offspring. His infected wife (or girlfriend) could have given birth ina Swedish barrack to a child who was HIV infected but seemingly healthy.Unsterilized needles and syringes could have spread the virus from child tochild.The truly strange thing about this story, of course, is that not all of thechildren died. Only a third did. The others did what today would seem almostimpossible. They defeated HIV, purged it from their bodies, and went on to livehealthy lives. In other words, the strains of HIV that were circulating back inthe 1950s were a lot different from the strains of HIV that circulate today.They were every bit as contagious. But they were weak enough that mostpeople—even small children—were able to fight them off and survive them. The HIVepidemic tipped in the early 1980s, in short, not just because of the enormouschanges in sexual behavior in the gay communities that made it possible for thevirus to spread rapidly. It also tipped because HIV itself changed. For onereason or another, the virus became a lot deadlier. Once it infected you, youstayed infected. It stuck.This idea of the importance of stickiness in tipping has enormous implicationsfor the way we regard social epidemics as well. We tend to spend a lot of timethinking about how to make messages more contagious—how to reach as many peopleas possible with our products or ideas. But the hard part of communication isoften figuring out how to make sure a message doesn’t go in one ear and out theother. Stickiness means that a message makes an impact. You can’t get it out ofyour head. It sticks in your memory. When Winston filter tip cigarettes wereintroduced in the spring of 1954, for example, the company came up with theslogan “Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.” At the time, theungrammatical and somehow provocative use of “like” instead of “as” created aminor sensation. It was the kind of phrase that people talked about, like thefamous Wendy’s tag line from 1984 “Where’s the beef?” In his history of thecigarette industry, Richard Kluger writes that the marketers at R. J. Reynolds,which sells Winston, were “delighted with the attention” and “made the offendingslogan the lyric of a bouncy little jingle on television and radio, and wrylydefended their syntax as a colloquialism rather than bad grammar.” Within monthsof its introduction, on the strength of that catchy phrase, Winston tipped,racing past Parliament, Kent, and L&M into second place, behind Viceroy, in theAmerican cigarette market. Within a few years, it was the bestselling brand inthe country. To this day, if you say to most Americans “Winston tastes good,”they can finish the phrase, “like a cigarette should.” That’s a classicallysticky advertising line, and stickiness is a critical component in tipping.Unless you remember what I tell you, why would you ever change your behavior orbuy my product or go to see my movie?The Stickiness Factor says that there are specific ways of making a contagiousmessage memorable; there are relatively simple changes in the presentation andstructuring of information that can make a big difference in how much of animpact it makes.3.Every time someone in Baltimore comes to a public clinic for treatment ofsyphilis or gonorrhea, John Zenilman plugs his or her address into his computer,so that the case shows up as a little black star on a map of the city. It’srather like a medical version of the maps police departments put up on theirwalls, with pins marking where crimes have occurred. On Zenilman’s map theneighborhoods of East and West Baltimore, on either side of the downtown core,tend to be thick with black stars. From those two spots, the cases radiateoutward along the two central roadways that happen to cut through bothneighborhoods. In the summer, when the incidence of sexually transmitted diseaseis highest, the clusters of black stars on the roads leading out of East andWest Baltimore become thick with cases. The disease is on the move. But in thewinter months, the map changes. When the weather turns cold, and the people ofEast and West Baltimore are much more likely to stay at home, away from the barsand clubs and street corners where sexual transactions are made, the stars ineach neighborhood fade away.The seasonal effect on the number of cases is so strong that it is not hard toimagine that a long, hard winter in Baltimore could be enough to slow or lessensubstantially—at least for the season—the growth of the syphilis epidemic.Epidemics, Zenilman’s map demonstrates, are strongly influenced by theirsituation—by the circumstances and conditions and particulars of theenvironments in which they operate. This much is obvious. What is interesting,though, is how far this principle can be extended. It isn’t just prosaic factorslike the weather that influence behavior. Even the smallest and subtlest andmost unexpected of factors can affect the way we act. One of the most infamousincidents in New York City history, for example, was the 1964 stabbing death ofa young Queens woman by the name of Kitty Genovese. Genovese was chased by herassailant and attacked three times on the street, over the course of half anhour, as thirty eight of her neighbors watched from their windows. During thattime, however, none of the thirty eight witnesses called the police. The caseprovoked rounds of self recrimination. It became symbolic of the cold anddehumanizing effects of urban life. Abe Rosenthal, who would later become editorof the New York Times, wrote in a book about the case:Nobody can say why the thirty eight did not lift the phone while Miss Genovesewas being attacked, since they cannot say themselves. It can be assumed,however, that their apathy was indeed one of the big city variety. It is almosta matter of psychological survival, if one is surrounded and pressed by millionsof people, to prevent them from constantly impinging on you, and the only way todo this is to ignore them as often as possible. Indifference to one’s neighborand his troubles is a conditioned reflex in life in New York as it is in otherbig cities.This is the kind of environmental explanation that makes intuitive sense to us.The anonymity and alienation of big city life makes people hard and unfeeling.The truth about Genovese, however, turns out to be a little more complicated—andmore interesting. Two New York City psychologists—Bibb Latane of ColumbiaUniversity and John Darley of New York University—subsequently conducted aseries of studies to try to understand what they dubbed the “bystander problem.”They staged emergencies of one kind or another in different situations in orderto see who would come and help. What they found, surprisingly, was that the onefactor above all else that predicted helping behavior was how many witnessesthere were to the event.In one experiment, for example, Latane and Darley had a student alone in a roomstage an epileptic fit. When there was just one person next door, listening,that person rushed to the student’s aid 85 percent of the time. But whensubjects thought that there were four others also overhearing the seizure, theycame to the student’s aid only 31 percent of the time. In another experiment,people who saw smoke seeping out from under a doorway would report it 75 percentof the time when they were on their own, but the incident would be reported only38 percent of the time when they were in a group. When people are in a group, inother words, responsibility for acting is diffused. They assume that someoneelse will make the call, or they assume that because no one else is acting, theapparent problem—the seizure like sounds from the other room, the smoke from thedoor—isn’t really a problem. In the case of Kitty Genovese, then, socialpsychologists like Latane and Darley argue, the lesson is not that no one calleddespite the fact that thirty eight people heard her scream; it’s that no onecalled because thirty eight people heard her scream. Ironically, had she beenattacked on a lonely street with just one witness, she might have lived.The key to getting people to change their behavior, in other words, to careabout their neighbor in distress, sometimes lies with the smallest details oftheir immediate situation. The Power of Context says that human beings are a lotmore sensitive to their environment than they may seem.4.The three rules of the Tipping Point—the Law of the Few, the Stickiness Factor,the Power of Context—offer a way of making sense of epidemics. They provide uswith direction for how to go about reaching a Tipping Point. The balance of thisbook will take these ideas and apply them to other puzzling situations andepidemics from the world around us. How do these three rules help us understandteenage smoking, for example, or the phenomenon of word of mouth, or crime, orthe rise of a bestseller? The answers may surprise you."},{"pageContent":"TWO [TippingPoint_toc.html#chap_2]The Law of the FewCONNECTORS, MAVENS,AND SALESMENOn the afternoon of April 18, 1775, a young boy who worked at a livery stable inBoston overheard one British army officer say to another something about “hellto pay tomorrow.” The stable boy ran with the news to Boston’s North End, to thehome of a silversmith named Paul Revere. Revere listened gravely; this was notthe first rumor to come his way that day. Earlier, he had been told of anunusual number of British officers gathered on Boston’s Long Wharf, talking inlow tones. British crewmen had been spotted scurrying about in the boatstethered beneath the HMS Somerset and the HMS Boyne in Boston Harbor. Severalother sailors were seen on shore that morning, running what appeared to be lastminute errands. As the afternoon wore on, Revere and his close friend JosephWarren became more and more convinced that the British were about to make themajor move that had long been rumored—to march to the town of Lexington,northwest of Boston, to arrest the colonial leaders John Hancock and SamuelAdams, and then on to the town of Concord to seize the stores of guns andammunition that some of the local colonial militia had stored there.What happened next has become part of historical legend, a tale told to everyAmerican schoolchild. At ten o’clock that night, Warren and Revere met. Theydecided they had to warn the communities surrounding Boston that the Britishwere on their way, so that local militia could be roused to meet them. Reverewas spirited across Boston Harbor to the ferry landing at Charlestown. He jumpedon a horse and began his “midnight ride” to Lexington. In two hours, he coveredthirteen miles. In every town he passed through along the way—Charlestown,Medford, North Cambridge, Menotomy—he knocked on doors and spread the word,telling local colonial leaders of the oncoming British, and telling them tospread the word to others. Church bells started ringing. Drums started beating.The news spread like a virus as those informed by Paul Revere sent out riders oftheir own, until alarms were going off throughout the entire region. The wordwas in Lincoln, Massachusetts, by one a.m., in Sudbury by three, in Andover,forty miles northwest of Boston, by five a.m., and by nine in the morning hadreached as far west as Ashby, near Worcester. When the British finally begantheir march toward Lexington on the morning of the nineteenth, their foray intothe countryside was met—to their utter astonishment—with organized and fierceresistance. In Concord that day, the British were confronted and soundly beatenby the colonial militia, and from that exchange came the war known as theAmerican Revolution.Paul Revere’s ride is perhaps the most famous historical example of a word ofmouth epidemic. A piece of extraordinary news traveled a long distance in a veryshort time, mobilizing an entire region to arms. Not all word of mouth epidemicsare this sensational, of course. But it is safe to say that word of mouthis—even in this age of mass communications and multimillion dollar advertisingcampaigns—still the most important form of human communication. Think, for amoment, about the last expensive restaurant you went to, the last expensivepiece of clothing you bought, and the last movie you saw. In how many of thosecases was your decision about where to spend your money heavily influenced bythe recommendation of a friend? There are plenty of advertising executives whothink that precisely because of the sheer ubiquity of marketing efforts thesedays, word of mouth appeals have become the only kind of persuasion that most ofus respond to anymore.But for all that, word of mouth remains very mysterious. People pass on allkinds of information to each other all the time. But it’s only in the rareinstance that such an exchange ignites a word of mouth epidemic. There is asmall restaurant in my neighborhood that I love and that I’ve been telling myfriends about for six months. But it’s still half empty. My endorsement clearlyisn’t enough to start a word of mouth epidemic, yet there are restaurants thatto my mind aren’t any better than the one in my neighborhood that open andwithin a matter of weeks are turning customers away. Why is it that some ideasand trends and messages “tip” and others don’t?In the case of Paul Revere’s ride, the answer to this seems easy. Revere wascarrying a sensational piece of news: the British were coming. But if you lookclosely at the events of that evening, that explanation doesn’t solve the riddleeither. At the same time that Revere began his ride north and west of Boston, afellow revolutionary—a tanner by the name of William Dawes—set out on the sameurgent errand, working his way to Lexington via the towns west of Boston. He wascarrying the identical message, through just as many towns over just as manymiles as Paul Revere. But Dawes’s ride didn’t set the countryside afire. Thelocal militia leaders weren’t alerted. In fact, so few men from one of the maintowns he rode through—Waltham—fought the following day that some subsequenthistorians concluded that it must have been a strongly pro British community. Itwasn’t. The people of Waltham just didn’t find out the British were coming untilit was too late. If it were only the news itself that mattered in a word ofmouth epidemic, Dawes would now be as famous as Paul Revere. He isn’t. So whydid Revere succeed where Dawes failed?The answer is that the success of any kind of social epidemic is heavilydependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of socialgifts. Revere’s news tipped and Dawes’s didn’t because of the differencesbetween the two men. This is the Law of the Few, which I briefly outlined in theprevious chapter. But there I only gave examples of the kinds of people—highlypromiscuous, sexually predatory—who are critical to epidemics of sexuallytransmitted disease. This chapter is about the people critical to socialepidemics and what makes someone like Paul Revere different from someone likeWilliam Dawes. These kinds of people are all around us. Yet we often fail togive them proper credit for the role they play in our lives. I call themConnectors, Mavens, and Salesmen.1.In the late 1960s, the psychologist Stanley Milgram conducted an experiment tofind an answer to what is known as the small world problem. The problem is this:how are human beings connected? Do we all belong to separate worlds, operatingsimultaneously but autonomously, so that the links between any two people,anywhere in the world, are few and distant? Or are we all bound up together in agrand, interlocking web? In a way, Milgram was asking the very same kind ofquestion that began this chapter, namely, how does an idea or a trend or a pieceof news—the British are coming!—travel through a population?Milgram’s idea was to test this question with a chain letter. He got the namesof 160 people who lived in Omaha, Nebraska, and mailed each of them a packet. Inthe packet was the name and address of a stockbroker who worked in Boston andlived in Sharon, Massachusetts. Each person was instructed to write his or hername on the packet and send it on to a friend or acquaintance who he or shethought would get the packet closer to the stockbroker. If you lived in Omahaand had a cousin outside of Boston, for example, you might send it to him, onthe grounds that—even if your cousin did not himself know the stockbroker—hewould be a lot more likely to be able to get to the stockbroker in two or threeor four steps. The idea was that when the packet finally arrived at thestockbroker’s house, Milgram could look at the list of all those whose hands itwent through to get there and establish how closely connected someone chosen atrandom from one part of the country was to another person in another part of thecountry. Milgram found that most of the letters reached the stockbroker in fiveor six steps. This experiment is where we get the concept of six degrees ofseparation.That phrase is now so familiar that it is easy to lose sight of how surprisingMilgram’s findings were. Most of us don’t have particularly broad and diversegroups of friends. In one well known study, a group of psychologists askedpeople living in the Dyckman public housing project in northern Manhattan toname their closest friend in the project; 88 percent of the friends lived in thesame building, and half lived on the same floor. In general, people chosefriends of similar age and race. But if the friend lived down the hall, then ageand race became a lot less important. Proximity overpowered similarity. Anotherstudy, done on students at the University of Utah, found that if you ask someonewhy he is friendly with someone else, he’ll say it is because he and his friendshare similar attitudes. But if you actually quiz the two of them on theirattitudes, you’ll find out that what they actually share is similar activities.We’re friends with the people we do things with, as much as we are with thepeople we resemble. We don’t seek out friends, in other words. We associate withthe people who occupy the same small, physical spaces that we do. People inOmaha are not, as a rule, friends with people who live halfway across thecountry in Sharon, Massachusetts. “When I asked an intelligent friend of minehow many steps he thought it would take, he estimated that it would require 100intermediate persons or more to move from Nebraska to Sharon,” Milgram wrote, atthe time. “Many people make somewhat similar estimates, and are surprised tolearn that only five intermediaries will—on average—suffice. Somehow it does notaccord with intuition.” How did the packet get to Sharon in just five steps?The answer is that in the six degrees of separation, not all degrees are equal.When Milgram analyzed his experiment, for example, he found that many of thechains from Omaha to Sharon followed the same asymmetrical pattern. Twenty fourletters reached the stockbroker at his home in Sharon, and of those, sixteenwere given to him by the same person, a clothing merchant Milgram calls Mr.Jacobs. The balance of letters came to the stockbroker at his office, and ofthose the majority came through two other men, whom Milgram calls Mr. Brown andMr. Jones. In all, half of the responses that came back to the stockbroker weredelivered to him by these same three people. Think of it. Dozens of people,chosen at random from a large Midwestern city, send out letters independently.Some go through college acquaintances. Some send their letters to relatives.Some send them to old workmates. Everyone has a different strategy. Yet in theend, when all of those separate and idiosyncratic chains were completed, half ofthose letters ended up in the hands of Jacobs, Jones, and Brown. Six degrees ofseparation doesn’t mean that everyone is linked to everyone else in just sixsteps. It means that a very small number of people are linked to everyone elsein a few steps, and the rest of us are linked to the world through those specialfew.There is an easy way to explore this idea. Suppose that you made a list of theforty people whom you would call your circle of friends (not including familyand co workers) and in each case worked backward until you could identify theperson who is ultimately responsible for setting in motion the series ofconnections that led to that friendship. My oldest friend, Bruce, for example, Imet in first grade, so I’m the responsible party. That’s easy. I met my friendNigel because he lived down the hall in college from my friend Tom, whom I metbecause in freshman year he invited me to play touch football. Tom isresponsible for Nigel. Once you’ve made all of the connections, the strangething is that you will find the same names coming up again and again. I have afriend named Amy, whom I met when her friend Katie brought her to a restaurantwhere I was having dinner one night. I know Katie because she is the best friendof my friend Larissa, whom I know because I was told to look her up by a mutualfriend of both of ours—Mike A.—whom I know because he went to school withanother friend of mine—Mike H.—who used to work at a political weekly with myfriend Jacob. No Jacob, no Amy. Similarly, I met my friend Sarah S. at mybirthday party a year ago, because she was there with a writer named David whowas there at the invitation of his agent, Tina, whom I met through my friendLeslie, whom I know because her sister, Nina, is a friend of my friend Ann’s,whom I met through my old roommate Maura, who was my roommate because she workedwith a writer named Sarah L., who was a college friend of my friend Jacob’s. NoJacob, no Sarah S. In fact, when I go down my list of forty friends, thirty ofthem, in one way or another, lead back to Jacob. My social circle is, inreality, not a circle. It is a pyramid. And at the top of the pyramid is asingle person—Jacob—who is responsible for an overwhelming majority of therelationships that constitute my life. Not only is my social circle not acircle, but it’s not “mine” either. It belongs to Jacob. It’s more like a clubthat he invited me to join. These people who link us up with the world, whobridge Omaha and Sharon, who introduce us to our social circles—these people onwhom we rely more heavily than we realize—are Connectors, people with a specialgift for bringing the world together.2.What makes someone a Connector? The first—and most obvious—criterion is thatConnectors know lots of people. They are the kinds of people who know everyone.All of us know someone like this. But I don’t think that we spend a lot of timethinking about the importance of these kinds of people. I’m not even sure thatmost of us really believe that the kind of person who knows everyone reallyknows everyone. But they do. There is a simple way to show this. In theparagraph below is a list of around 250 surnames, all taken at random from theManhattan phone book. Go down the list and give yourself a point every time yousee a surname that is shared by someone you know. (The definition of “know” hereis very broad. For example, if you sat down next to that person on a train, youwould know their name if they introduced themselves to you and they would knowyour name.) Multiple names count. If the name is Johnson, in other words, andyou know three Johnsons, you get three points. The idea is that your score onthis test should roughly represent how social you are. It’s a simple way ofestimating how many friends and acquaintances you have.Algazi, Alvarez, Alpern, Ametrano, Andrews, Aran, Arnstein, Ashford, Bailey,Ballout, Bamberger, Baptista, Barr, Barrows, Baskerville, Bassiri, Bell,Bokgese, Brandao, Bravo, Brooke, Brightman, Billy, Blau, Bohen, Bohn, Borsuk,Brendle, Butler, Calle, Cantwell, Carrell, Chinlund, Cirker, Cohen, Collas,Couch, Callegher, Calcaterra, Cook, Carey, Cassell, Chen, Chung, Clarke, Cohn,Carton, Crowley, Curbelo, Dellamanna, Diaz, Dirar, Duncan, Dagostino, Delakas,Dillon, Donaghey, Daly, Dawson, Edery, Ellis, Elliott, Eastman, Easton, Famous,Fermin, Fialco, Finklestein, Farber, Falkin, Feinman, Friedman, Gardner, Gelpi,Glascock, Grandfield, Greenbaum, Greenwood, Gruber, Garil, Goff, Gladwell,Greenup, Gannon, Ganshaw, Garcia, Gennis, Gerard, Gericke, Gilbert, Glassman,Glazer, Gomendio, Gonzalez, Greenstein, Guglielmo, Gurman, Haberkorn, Hoskins,Hussein, Hamm, Hardwick, Harrell, Hauptman, Hawkins, Henderson, Hayman, Hibara,Hehmann, Herbst, Hedges, Hogan, Hoffman, Horowitz, Hsu, Huber, Ikiz, Jaroschy,Johann, Jacobs, Jara, Johnson, Kassel, Keegan, Kuroda, Kavanau, Keller, Kevill,Kiew, Kimbrough, Kline, Kossoff, Kotzitzky, Kahn, Kiesler, Kosser, Korte,Leibowitz, Lin, Liu, Lowrance, Lundh, Laux, Leifer, Leung, Levine, Leiw,Lockwood, Logrono, Lohnes, Lowet, Laber, Leonardi, Marten, McLean, Michaels,Miranda, Moy, Marin, Muir, Murphy, Marodon, Matos, Mendoza, Muraki, Neck,Needham, Noboa, Null, O’Flynn, O’Neill, Orlowski, Perkins, Pieper, Pierre, Pons,Pruska, Paulino, Popper, Potter, Purpura, Palma, Perez, Portocarrero, Punwasi,Rader, Rankin, Ray, Reyes, Richardson, Ritter, Roos, Rose, Rosenfeld, Roth,Rutherford, Rustin, Ramos, Regan, Reisman, Renkert, Roberts, Rowan, Rene,Rosario, Rothbart, Saperstein, Schoenbrod, Schwed, Sears, Statosky, Sutphen,Sheehy, Silverton, Silverman, Silverstein, Sklar, Slotkin, Speros, Stollman,Sadowski, Schles, Shapiro, Sigdel, Snow, Spencer, Steinkol, Stewart, Stires,Stopnik, Stonehill, Tayss, Tilney, Temple, Torfield, Townsend, Trimpin, Turchin,Villa, Vasillov, Voda, Waring, Weber, Weinstein, Wang, Wegimont, Weed, Weishaus.I have given this test to at least a dozen groups of people. One was a freshmanWorld Civilizations class at City College in Manhattan. The students were all intheir late teens or early twenties, many of them recent immigrants to America,and of middle and lower income. The average score in that class was 20.96,meaning that the average person in the class knew 21 people with the same lastnames as the people on my list. I also gave the test to a group of healtheducators and academics at a conference in Princeton, New Jersey. This groupwere mostly in their forties and fifties, largely white, highly educated—manyhad Ph.D.’s—and wealthy. Their average score was 39. Then I gave the test to arelatively random sample of my friends and acquaintances, mostly journalists andprofessionals in their late twenties and thirties. The average score was 41.These results shouldn’t be all that surprising. College students don’t have aswide a circle of acquaintances as people in their forties. It makes sense thatbetween the ages of twenty and forty the number of people you know shouldroughly double, and that upper income professionals should know more people thanlower income immigrants. In every group there was also quite a range between thehighest and the lowest scorers. That makes sense too, I think. Real estatesalesmen know more people than computer hackers. What was surprising, though,was how enormous that range was. In the college class, the low score was 2 andthe high score was 95. In my random sample, the low score was 9 and the highscore was 118. Even at the conference in Princeton, which was a highlyhomogenous group of people of similar age, education, and income—who were all,with a few exceptions, in the same profession—the range was enormous. The lowestscore was 16. The highest score was 108. All told, I have given the test toabout 400 people. Of those, there were two dozen or so scores under 20, eightover 90, and four more over 100. The other surprising thing is that I found highscorers in every social group I looked at. The scores of the students at CityCollege were less, on average, than adult scores. But even in that group thereare people whose social circle is four or five times the size of other people’s.Sprinkled among every walk of life, in other words, are a handful of people witha truly extraordinary knack of making friends and acquaintances. They areConnectors.One of the highest scorers on my acquaintance survey was a man named RogerHorchow, who is a successful businessman from Dallas. Horchow founded theHorchow Collection, a high end mail order merchandise company. He has alsoenjoyed considerable success on Broadway, backing such hits as Les Miserablesand Phantom of the Opera and producing the award winning Gershwin musical Crazyfor You. I was introduced to Horchow through his daughter, who is a friend ofmine, and I went to see him in his Manhattan pied-à-terre, an elegant apartmenthigh above Fifth Avenue. Horchow is slender and composed. He talks slowly, witha slight Texas drawl. He has a kind of wry, ironic charm that is utterlywinning. If you sat next to Roger Horchow on a plane ride across the Atlantic,he would start talking as the plane taxied to the runway, you would be laughingby the time the seatbelt sign was turned off, and when you landed at the otherend you’d wonder where the time went. When I gave Horchow the list of names fromthe Manhattan directory, he went through the list very quickly, muttering namesunder his breath as his pencil skimmed the page. He scored 98. I suspect thathad I given him another 10 minutes to think, he would have scored even higher.Why did Horchow do so well? When I met him, I became convinced that knowing lotsof people was a kind of skill, something that someone might set out to dodeliberately and that could be perfected, and that those techniques were centralto the fact that he knew everyone. I kept asking Horchow how all of theconnections in his life had helped him in the business world, because I thoughtthat the two things had to be linked, but the questions seemed to puzzle him. Itwasn’t that his connections hadn’t helped him. It was that he didn’t think ofhis people collection as a business strategy. He just thought of it as somethinghe did. It was who he was. Horchow has an instinctive and natural gift formaking social connections. He’s not aggressive about it. He’s not one of thoseoverly social, back slapping types for whom the process of acquiringacquaintances is obvious and self serving. He’s more an observer, with the dry,knowing manner of someone who likes to remain a little bit on the outside. Hesimply likes people, in a genuine and powerful way, and he finds the patterns ofacquaintanceship and interaction in which people arrange themselves to beendlessly fascinating. When I met with Horchow, he explained to me how he wonthe rights to revive the Gershwin musical Girl Crazy as Crazy for You. The fullstory took twenty minutes. This is just a portion. If it seems at allcalculating, it shouldn’t. Horchow told this story with a gentle, self mockingair. He was, I think, deliberately playing up the idiosyncrasies of hispersonality. But as a portrait of how his mind works—and of what makes someone aConnector—I think it’s perfectly accurate:I have a friend named Mickey Schaenen, who lives in New York. He said, I knowyou love Gershwin. I have met George Gershwin’s old girlfriend. Her name isEmily Paley. She was also the sister of Ira Gershwin’s wife, Lenore. She livesin the Village and she has invited us to dinner. So anyway, I met Emily Paley,and I saw a picture Gershwin had painted of her. Her husband, Lou Paley, wrotewith Ira Gershwin and George Gershwin early on, when Ira Gershwin still calledhimself Arthur Francis. That was one link....I had lunch with a fellow called Leopold Godowsky, who is the son of FrancesGershwin, George Gershwin’s sister. She married a composer named Godowsky.Arthur Gershwin’s son was also there. His name is Mark Gershwin. So theysaid—well, why should we let you have the rights to Girl Crazy? Who are you?You’ve never been in the theater. So then I started pulling out my coincidences.Your aunt, Emily Paley. I went to her house. The picture with her in the redshawl—you’ve seen that picture? I pulled out all the little links. Then we allwent to Hollywood and we went over to Mrs. Gershwin’s house and I said, I’m sohappy to meet you. I knew your sister. I loved your husband’s work. Oh, and thenI pulled out my Los Angeles friend. When I was at Neiman Marcus, a lady wrote acookbook. Her name was Mildred Knopf. Her husband was Edwin Knopf, the movieproducer. He did Audrey Hepburn’s stuff. His brother was the publisher. Weintroduced her cookbook in Dallas, and Mildred became a good friend. We justloved her, and when I was in L.A. I would call on her. I always keep up withpeople. Well, it turns out Edwin Knopf was George Gershwin’s closest friend.They had Gershwin’s pictures all over their house. He was with Gershwin when hewrote “Rhapsody in Blue” in Asheville, North Carolina. Mr. Knopf died. ButMildred’s still living. She’s ninety eight now. So when I went to see LeeGershwin, we mentioned that we had just been to see Mildred Knopf. She said—Youknow her? Oh, why haven’t we met before? She gave us the rights immediately.In the course of our conversation, Horchow did this over and again, delightingin tying together the loose ends of a lifetime. For his seventieth birthday, heattempted to track down a friend from elementary school named Bobby Hunsicker,whom he hadn’t seen in sixty years. He sent letters to every Bobby Hunsicker hecould find, asking them if they were the Hunsicker who lived at 4501 Perth Lanein Cincinnati.This is not normal social behavior. It’s a little unusual. Horchow collectspeople the same way others collect stamps. He remembers the boys he played withsixty years ago, the address of his best friend growing up, the name of the manhis college girlfriend had a crush on when she spent her junior year overseas.These details are critical to Horchow. He keeps on his computer a roster of1,600 names and addresses, and on each entry is a note describing thecircumstances under which he met the person. When we were talking, he took out alittle red pocket diary. “If I met you and like you and you happen to mentionyour birthday, I write it in and you’ll get a birthday card from Roger Horchow.See here—Monday was Ginger Vroom’s birthday, and the Whittenburgs’ firstanniversary. And Alan Schwartz’s birthday is Friday and our yard man’s isSaturday.”Most of us, I think, shy away from this kind of cultivation of acquaintances. Wehave our circle of friends, to whom we are devoted. Acquaintances we keep atarm’s length. The reason we don’t send birthday cards to people we don’t reallycare a great deal about is that we don’t want to feel obliged to have dinnerwith them or see a movie with them or visit them when they’re sick. The purposeof making an acquaintance, for most of us, is to evaluate whether we want toturn that person into a friend; we don’t feel we have the time or the energy tomaintain meaningful contact with everyone. Horchow is quite different. Thepeople he puts in his diary or on his computer are acquaintances—people he mightrun into only once a year or once every few years—and he doesn’t shy away fromthe obligation that that connection requires. He has mastered what sociologistscall the “weak tie,” a friendly yet casual social connection. More than that,he’s happy with the weak tie. After I met Horchow, I felt slightly frustrated. Iwanted to know him better, but I wondered whether I would ever have the chance.I don’t think he shared the same frustration with me. I think he’s someone whosees value and pleasure in a casual meeting.Why is Horchow so different from the rest of us? He doesn’t know. He thinks ithas something to do with being an only child whose father was often away. Butthat doesn’t really explain it. Perhaps it is best to call the Connector impulsesimply that—an impulse, just one of the many personality traits that distinguishone human being from another.3.Connectors are important for more than simply the number of people they know.Their importance is also a function of the kinds of people they know. Perhapsthe best way to understand this point is through the popular parlor game “SixDegrees of Kevin Bacon.” The idea behind the game is to try to link any actor oractress, through the movies they’ve been in, to the actor Kevin Bacon in lessthan six steps. So, for example, O.J. Simpson was in Naked Gun with PriscillaPresley, who was in Ford Fairlane with Gilbert Gottfried, who was in BeverlyHills Cop II with Paul Reiser, who was in Diner with Kevin Bacon. That’s foursteps. Mary Pickford was in Screen Snapshots with Clark Gable, who was in CombatAmerica with Tony Romano, who, thirty five years later, was in Starting Overwith Bacon. That’s three steps. Recently, a computer scientist at the Universityof Virginia by the name of Brett Tjaden actually sat down and figured out whatthe average Bacon number is for the quarter million or so actors and actresseswho have played in television films or major motion pictures and came up with2.8312 steps. Anyone who has ever acted, in other words, can be linked to Baconin an average of under three steps. That sounds impressive, except that Tjadenthen went back and performed an even more heroic calculation, figuring out whatthe average degree of connectedness was for everyone who had ever acted inHollywood. For example, how many steps on average does it take to link everyonein Hollywood to Robert DeNiro or Shirley Temple or Adam Sandler? Tjaden foundthat when he listed all Hollywood actors in order of their “connectedness,”Bacon ranked only 669th. Martin Sheen, by contrast, can be connected to everyother actor in 2.63681 steps, which puts him almost 650 places higher thanBacon. Elliot Gould can be connected even more quickly, in 2.63601. Among thetop fifteen are people like Robert Mitchum and Gene Hackman and DonaldSutherland and Shelley Winters and Burgess Meredith. The best connected actor ofall time? Rod Steiger.Why is Kevin Bacon so far behind these actors? One big factor is that Bacon is alot younger than most of them and as a result has made fewer movies. But thatexplains only some of the difference. There are lots of people, for example, whohave made lots of movies and aren’t particularly well connected. John Wayne, forexample, made an extraordinary 179 movies in his sixty year career and stillranks only 116th, at 2.7173. The problem is that more than half of John Wayne’smovies were Westerns, meaning that he made the same kind of movie with the samekind of actors over and over again.But take someone like Steiger: he has made great movies like the Oscar winningOn the Waterfront and dreadful movies like Car Pool. He won an Oscar for hisrole in In the Heat of the Night and also made “B” movies so bad they wentstraight to video. He’s played Mussolini, Napol on, Pontius Pilate, and AlCapone. He’s been in thirty eight dramas, twelve crime pictures and comedies,eleven thrillers, eight action films, seven Westerns, six war movies, fourdocumentaries, three horror flicks, two sci fi films, and a musical, amongothers. Rod Steiger is the best connected actor in history because he hasmanaged to move up and down and back and forth among all the different worldsand subcultures and niches and levels that the acting profession has to offer.This is what Connectors are like. They are the Rod Steigers of everyday life.They are people whom all of us can reach in only a few steps because, for onereason or another, they manage to occupy many different worlds and subculturesand niches. In Steiger’s case, of course, his high connectedness is a functionof his versatility as an actor and, in all likelihood, some degree of good luck.But in the case of Connectors, their ability to span many different worlds is afunction of something intrinsic to their personality, some combination ofcuriosity, self confidence, sociability, and energy.I once met a classic Connector in Chicago by the name of Lois Weisberg. Weisbergserves as the Commissioner of Cultural Affairs for the City of Chicago. But thatis only the latest in what has been an extraordinary string of experiences andcareers. In the early 1950s, for example, Weisberg ran a drama troupe inChicago. In 1956, she decided to stage a festival to mark the centenary ofGeorge Bernard Shaw’s birth, and then began putting out a newspaper devoted toShaw, which mutated into an underground, alternative weekly called The Paper. OnFriday nights people from all over the city would gather there for editorialmeetings. William Friedkin, who would go on to direct The French Connection andThe Exorcist, was a regular, as was the attorney Elmer Gertz (who was one ofNathan Leopold’s attorneys) and some of the editors from Playboy, which was justup the street. People like Art Farmer and Thelonius Monk and John Coltrane andLenny Bruce would stop by when they were in town. (Bruce actually lived withWeisberg for a while. “My mother was hysterical about it, especially one daywhen she rang the doorbell and he answered in a bath towel,” Weisberg says. “Wehad a window on the porch, and he didn’t have a key, so the window was alwaysleft open for him. There were a lot of rooms in that house, and a lot of peoplestayed there and I didn’t know they were there. I never could stand his jokes. Ididn’t really like his act. I couldn’t stand all the words he was using.”) AfterThe Paper folded, Lois took a job doing public relations for an injuryrehabilitation institute. From there, she went to work for a public interest lawfirm called BPI, and while at BPI she became obsessed with the fact thatChicago’s parks were crumbling and neglected, so she gathered together a motleycollection of nature lovers, historians, civic activists, and housewives andfounded a lobbying group called Friends of the Parks. Then she became alarmedbecause a commuter railroad that ran along the south shore of Lake Michigan—fromSouth Bend to Chicago—was about to shut down, so she gathered together a motleycollection of railway enthusiasts, environmentalists, and commuters and foundedSouth Shore Recreation, and saved the railroad. Then she became executivedirector of the Chicago Council of Lawyers, a progressive legal group. Then sheran a local congressman’s campaign. Then she got the position of director ofspecial events for the first black mayor of Chicago, Harold Washington. Then shequit government and opened a small stand in a flea market. Then she went to workfor Mayor Richard Daley—where she is to this day—as Chicago’s Commissioner ofCultural Affairs.If you go through that history and keep count, the number of worlds that Loishas belonged to comes to eight: the actors, the writers, the doctors, thelawyers, the park lovers, the politicians, the railroad buffs, and the fleamarket aficionados. When I asked Weisberg to make her own list, she came up withten, because she added the architects and the hospitality industry people sheworks with in her current job. But she was probably being modest, because if youlooked harder at Weisberg’s life you could probably subdivide her experiencesinto fifteen or twenty worlds. They aren’t separate worlds, though. The pointabout Connectors is that by having a foot in so many different worlds, they havethe effect of bringing them all together.Once—and this would have been in the mid 1950s—Weisberg took the train to NewYork to attend, on a whim, the Science Fiction Writers Convention, where she meta young writer by the name of Arthur C. Clarke. Clarke took a shine to Weisberg,and next time he was in Chicago he called her up. “He was at a pay phone,”Weisberg recalls. “He said, is there anyone in Chicago I should meet. I told himto come over to my house.” Weisberg has a low, raspy voice, baked hard by half acentury of nicotine, and she pauses between sentences to give herself theopportunity for a quick puff. Even when she’s not smoking, she pauses anyway, asif to keep in practice for those moments when she is. “I called Bob Hughes. BobHughes was one of the people who wrote for my paper.” Pause. “I said, do youknow anyone in Chicago interested in talking to Arthur Clarke. He said, yeah,Isaac Asimov is in town. And this guy Robert, Robert—Robert Heinlein. So theyall came over and sat in my study.” Pause. “Then they called over to me and theysaid, Lois...I can’t remember the word they used. They had some word for me. Itwas something about how I was the kind of person who brings people together.”This is in some ways the archetypal Lois Weisberg story. First she reaches outto somebody, to someone outside her world. She was in drama at the time. ArthurClarke wrote science fiction. Then, equally important, that person responds toher. Lots of us reach out to those different from ourselves, or to those morefamous or successful than we are, but that gesture isn’t always reciprocated.Then there’s the fact that when Arthur Clarke comes to Chicago and wants to beconnected, to be linked up with someone else, Weisberg comes up with IsaacAsimov. She says it was a fluke that Asimov was in town. But if it wasn’tAsimov, it would have been someone else.One of the things that people remember about Weisberg’s Friday night salons backin the 1950s was that they were always, effortlessly, racially integrated. Thepoint is not that without that salon blacks wouldn’t have socialized with whiteson the North Side. It was rare back then, but it happened. The point is thatwhen blacks socialized with whites in the 1950s in Chicago, it didn’t happen byaccident; it happened because a certain kind of person made it happen. That’swhat Asimov and Clarke meant when they said that Weisberg has thisthing—whatever it is—that brings people together.“She doesn’t have any kind of snobbery,” says Wendy Willrich, who used to workfor Weisberg. “I once went with her on a trip to someone’s professionalphotography studio. People write her letters and she looks at all of her mail,and the guy who owned the studio invited her out and she said yes. He wasbasically a wedding photographer. She decided to check it out. I was thinking,ohmigod, do we have to hike out forty five minutes to this studio? It was out bythe airport. This is the Commissioner of Cultural Affairs for the City ofChicago we’re talking about. But she thought he was incredibly interesting.” Washe actually interesting? Who knows? The point is that Lois found himinteresting, because, in some way, she finds everyone interesting. Weisberg, oneof her friends told me, “always says—‘Oh, I’ve met the most wonderful person.You are going to love her,’ and she is as enthused about this person as she wasabout the first person she has met and you know what, she’s usually right.”Helen Doria, another of her friends, told me that “Lois sees things in you thatyou don’t even see in yourself,” which is another way of saying the same thing,that by some marvelous quirk of nature, Lois and the other people like her havesome instinct that helps them relate to the people they meet. When Weisberglooks out at the world or when Roger Horchow sits next to you on an airplane,they don’t see the same world that the rest of us see. They see possibility, andwhile most of us are busily choosing whom we would like to know, and rejectingthe people who don’t look right or who live out near the airport, or whom wehaven’t seen in sixty five years, Lois and Roger like them all.4.There is a very good example of the way Connectors function in the work of thesociologist Mark Granovetter. In his classic 1974 study Getting a Job,Granovetter looked at several hundred professional and technical workers fromthe Boston suburb of Newton, interviewing them in some detail on theiremployment history. He found that 56 percent of those he talked to found theirjob through a personal connection. Another 18.8 percent used formalmeans—advertisements, headhunters—and roughly 20 percent applied directly. Thismuch is not surprising; the best way to get in the door is through a personalcontact. But, curiously, Granovetter found that of those personal connections,the majority were “weak ties.” Of those who used a contact to find a job, only16.7 percent saw that contact “often”—as they would if the contact were a goodfriend—and 55.6 percent saw their contact only “occasionally.” Twenty eightpercent saw the contact “rarely.” People weren’t getting their jobs throughtheir friends. They were getting them through their acquaintances.Why is this? Granovetter argues that it is because when it comes to finding outabout new jobs—or, for that matter, new information, or new ideas—“weak ties”are always more important than strong ties. Your friends, after all, occupy thesame world that you do. They might work with you, or live near you, and go tothe same churches, schools, or parties. How much, then, would they know that youwouldn’t know? Your acquaintances, on the other hand, by definition occupy avery different world than you. They are much more likely to know something thatyou don’t. To capture this apparent paradox, Granovetter coined a marvelousphrase: the strength of weak ties. Acquaintances, in short, represent a sourceof social power, and the more acquaintances you have the more power ful you are.Connectors like Lois Weisberg and Roger Horchow—who are masters of the weaktie—are extraordinarily powerful. We rely on them to give us access toopportunities and worlds to which we don’t belong.This principle holds for more than just jobs, of course. It also holds forrestaurants, movies, fashion trends, or anything else that moves by word ofmouth. It isn’t just the case that the closer someone is to a Connector, themore powerful or the wealthier or the more opportunities he or she gets. It’salso the case that the closer an idea or a product comes to a Connector, themore power and opportunity it has as well. Could this be one of the reasons HushPuppies suddenly became a major fashion trend? Along the way from the EastVillage to Middle America, a Connector or a series of Connectors must havesuddenly become enamored of them, and through their enormous social connections,their long lists of weak ties, their role in multiple worlds and subcultures,they must have been able to take those shoes and send them in a thousanddirections at once—to make them really tip. Hush Puppies, in a sense then, gotlucky. And perhaps one of the reasons why so many fashion trends don’t make itinto mainstream America is that simply, by sheerest bad fortune, they neverhappen to meet the approval of a Connector along the way.Horchow’s daughter, Sally, told me a story of how she once took her father to anew Japanese restaurant where a friend of hers was a chef. Horchow liked thefood, and so when he went home he turned on his computer, pulled up the names ofacquaintances who lived nearby, and faxed them notes telling them of a wonderfulnew restaurant he had discovered and that they should try it. This is, in anutshell, what word of mouth is. It’s not me telling you about a new restaurantwith great food, and you telling a friend and that friend telling a friend. Wordof mouth begins when somewhere along that chain, someone tells a person likeRoger Horchow.5.Here, then, is the explanation for why Paul Revere’s midnight ride started aword of mouth epidemic and William Dawes’s ride did not. Paul Revere was theRoger Horchow or the Lois Weisberg of his day. He was a Connector. He was, forexample, gregarious and intensely social. When he died, his funeral wasattended, in the words of one contemporary newspaper account, by “troops ofpeople.” He was a fisherman and a hunter, a cardplayer and a theater lover, afrequenter of pubs and a successful businessman. He was active in the localMasonic Lodge and was a member of several select social clubs. He was also adoer, a man blessed—as David Hackett Fischer recounts in his brilliant book PaulRevere’s Ride—with an “uncanny genius for being at the center of events.”Fischer writes:When Boston imported its first streetlights in 1774, Paul Revere was asked toserve on the committee that made the arrangement. When the Boston marketrequired regulation, Paul Revere was appointed its clerk. After the Revolution,in a time of epidemics, he was chosen health officer of Boston, and coroner ofSuffolk County. When a major fire ravaged the old wooden town, he helped tofound the Massachusetts Mutual Fire Insurance Company, and his name was first toappear on its charter of incorporation. As poverty became a growing problem inthe new republic, he called the meeting that organized the MassachusettsCharitable Mechanic Association, and was elected its first president. When thecommunity of Boston was shattered by the most sensational murder trial of hisgeneration, Paul Revere was chosen foreman of the jury.Had Revere been given a list of 250 surnames drawn at random from the Bostoncensus of 1775, there is no question he would have scored well over 100.After the Boston Tea Party, in 1773, when the anger of the American colonistsagainst their British rulers began to spill over, dozens of committees andcongresses of angry colonists sprang up around New England. They had no formalorganization or established means of community. But Paul Revere quickly emergedas a link between all those far flung revolutionary dots. He would routinelyride down to Philadelphia or New York or up to New Hampshire, carrying messagesfrom one group to another. Within Boston as well, he played a special role.There were, in the revolutionary years, seven groups of “Whigs”(revolutionaries) in Boston, comprising some 255 men. Most of the men—over 80percent—belonged to just one group. No one was a member of all seven. Only twomen were members of as many as five of the groups: Paul Revere was one of thosetwo.It is not surprising, then, that when the British army began its secret campaignin 1774 to root out and destroy the stores of arms and ammunition held by thefledgling revolutionary movement, Revere became a kind of unofficial clearinghouse for the anti British forces. He knew everybody. He was the logical one togo to if you were a stable boy on the afternoon of April 18th, 1775, andoverheard two British officers talking about how there would be hell to pay onthe following afternoon. Nor is it surprising that when Revere set out forLexington that night, he would have known just how to spread the news as far andwide as possible. When he saw people on the roads, he was so naturally andirrepressibly social he would have stopped and told them. When he came upon atown, he would have known exactly whose door to knock on, who the local militialeader was, who the key players in town were. He had met most of them before.And they knew and respected him as well.But William Dawes? Fischer finds it inconceivable that Dawes could have riddenall seventeen miles to Lexington and not spoken to anyone along the way. But heclearly had none of the social gifts of Revere, because there is almost norecord of anyone who remembers him that night. “Along Paul Revere’s northernroute, the town leaders and company captains instantly triggered the alarm,”Fischer writes. “On the southerly circuit of William Dawes, that did not happenuntil later. In at least one town it did not happen at all. Dawes did not awakenthe town fathers or militia commanders in the towns of Roxbury, Brookline,Watertown, or Waltham.” Why? Because Roxbury, Brookline, Watertown, and Walthamwere not Boston. And Dawes was in all likelihood a man with a normal socialcircle, which means that—like most of us—once he left his hometown he probablywouldn’t have known whose door to knock on. Only one small community alongDawes’s ride appeared to get the message, a few farmers in a neighborhood calledWaltham Farms. But alerting just those few houses wasn’t enough to tip thealarm. Word of mouth epidemics are the work of Connectors. William Dawes wasjust an ordinary man.6.It would be a mistake, however, to think that Connectors are the only people whomatter in a social epidemic. Roger Horchow sent out a dozen faxes promoting hisdaughter’s friend’s new restaurant. But he didn’t discover that restaurant.Someone else did and told him about it. At some point in the rise of HushPuppies, the shoes were discovered by Connectors, who broadcast the return ofHush Puppies far and wide. But who told the Connectors about Hush Puppies? It’spossible that Connectors learn about new information by an entirely randomprocess, that because they know so many people they get access to new thingswherever they pop up. If you look closely at social epidemics, however, itbecomes clear that just as there are people we rely upon to connect us to otherpeople, there are also people we rely upon to connect us with new information.There are people specialists, and there are information specialists.Sometimes, of course, these two specialties are one and the same. Part of theparticular power of Paul Revere, for example, was that he wasn’t just anetworker; he wasn’t just the man with the biggest Rolodex in colonial Boston.He was also actively engaged in gathering information about the British. In thefall of 1774, he set up a secret group that met regularly at the Green DragonTavern with the express purpose of monitoring British troop movements. InDecember of that year, the group learned that the British intended to seize acache of ammunition being stored by a colonial militia near the entrance toPortsmouth Harbor, fifty miles north of Boston. On the icy morning of December13th, Revere rode north through deep snow to warn the local militia that theBritish were on their way. He helped find out the intelligence, and he passed iton. Paul Revere was a Connector. But he was also—and this is the second of thethree kinds of people who control word of mouth epidemics—a Maven.The word Maven comes from the Yiddish, and it means one who accumulatesknowledge. In recent years, economists have spent a great deal of time studyingMavens, for the obvious reason that if marketplaces depend on information, thepeople with the most information must be the most important. For example,sometimes when a supermarket wants to increase sales of a given product, they’llput a promotion sticker in front of it, saying something like “Everyday LowPrice!” The price will stay the same. The product will just be featured moreprominently. When they do that, supermarkets find that invariably the sales ofthe product will go through the roof, the same way they would if the product hadactually been put on sale.This is, when you think about it, a potentially disturbing piece of information.The whole premise behind sales, or supermarket specials, is that we, asconsumers, are very aware of the prices of things and will react accordingly: webuy more in response to lower prices and less in response to higher prices. Butif we’ll buy more of something even if the price hasn’t been lowered, thenwhat’s to stop supermarkets from never lowering their prices? What’s to stopthem from cheating us with meaningless “everyday low price” signs every time wewalk in? The answer is that although most of us don’t look at prices, everyretailer knows that a very small number of people do, and if they find somethingamiss—a promotion that’s not really a promotion—they’ll do something about it.If a store tried to pull the sales stunt too often, these are the people whowould figure it out and complain to management and tell their friends andacquaintances to avoid the store. These are the people who keep the marketplacehonest. In the ten years or so since this group was first identified, economistshave gone to great lengths to understand them. They have found them in everywalk of life and in every socioeconomic group. One name for them is “pricevigilantes.” The other, more common, name for them is “Market Mavens.”Linda Price, a marketing professor at the University of Nebraska and a pioneerin Maven research, has made videotapes of interviews she’s done with a number ofMavens. In one, a very well dressed man talks with great animation about how hegoes about shopping. Here is the segment, in full:Because I follow the financial pages closely, I start to see trends. A classicexample is with coffee. When the first coffee crunch came ten years ago, I hadbeen following the thing about Brazilian frost and what it would do to the longterm price of coffee, and so I said I’m going to stockpile coffee.At this point in the interview, an enormous smile breaks across the man’s face.I ended up with probably somewhere between thirty five and forty cans of coffee.And I got them at these ridiculous prices, when the three pound cans were $2.79and $2.89....Today it’s about $6 for a three pound can. I had fun doing that.Do you see the level of obsession here? He can remember prices, to the cents, ofcans of coffee he bought ten years ago.The critical thing about Mavens, though, is that they aren’t passive collectorsof information. It isn’t just that they are obsessed with how to get the bestdeal on a can of coffee. What sets them apart is that once they figure out howto get that deal, they want to tell you about it too. “A Maven is a person whohas information on a lot of different products or prices or places. This personlikes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests,” Pricesays. “They like to be helpers in the marketplace. They distribute coupons. Theytake you shopping. They go shopping for you....They distribute about four timesas many coupons as other people. This is the person who connects people to themarketplace and has the inside scoop on the marketplace. They know where thebathroom is in retail stores. That’s the kind of knowledge they have.” They aremore than experts. An expert, says Price, will “talk about, say, cars becausethey love cars. But they don’t talk about cars because they love you, and wantto help you with your decision. The Market Maven will. They are more sociallymotivated.”Price says that well over half of Americans know a Maven, or someone close tothe Maven’s description. She herself, in fact, based the concept around someoneshe met when she was in graduate school, a man so memorable that his personalityserves as the basis for what is now an entire field of research in the marketingworld.“I was doing my Ph.D. at the University of Texas,” Price said. “At the time Ididn’t realize it, but I met the perfect Maven. He’s Jewish and it was Easterand I was looking for a ham and I asked him. And he said, well, you know I amJewish, but here’s the deli you should go to and here’s the price you shouldpay.” Price started laughing at the memory. “You should look him up. His name isMark Alpert.”7.Mark Alpert is a slender, energetic man in his fifties. He has dark hair and aprominent nose and two small, burning, intelligent eyes. He talks quickly andprecisely and with absolute authority. He’s the kind of person who doesn’t saythat it was hot yesterday. He would say that we had a high of 87 degreesyesterday. He doesn’t walk up stairs. He runs up them, like a small boy. Hegives the sense that he is interested in and curious about everything, that,even at his age, if you gave him a children’s chemistry set he would happily sitdown right then and there and create some strange new concoction.Alpert grew up in the Midwest, the son of a man who ran the first discount storein northern Minnesota. He got his doctorate from the University of SouthernCalifornia and now teaches at the University of Texas School of BusinessAdministration. But there is really no connection between his status as aneconomist and his Mavenism. Were Alpert a plumber, he would be just as exactingand thorough and knowledgeable about the ways of the marketplace.We met over lunch at a restaurant on the lakefront in Austin. I got there firstand chose a table. He got there second and persuaded me to move to anothertable, which he said was better. It was. I asked him about how he buys whateverhe buys, and he began to talk. He explained why he has cable TV, as opposed to adish. He gave me the inside scoop on Leonard Maltin’s new movie guide. He gaveme the name of a contact at the Park Central Hotel in Manhattan who is veryhelpful in getting a great deal. (“Malcolm, the hotel is ninety nine dollars.And the rack rate is a hundred and eighty nine dollars!”) He explained what arack rate is. (The initial, but soft, retail asking price for a hotel room.) Hepointed at my tape recorder. “I think your tape is finished,” he said. It was.He explained why I should not buy an Audi. (“They’re Germans, so it’s a paindealing with them. For a while they would give you an under the counterwarranty, but they don’t anymore. The dealer network is small, so it’s hard toget service. I love driving them. I don’t like owning them.” What I shoulddrive, he told me, is a Mercury Mystique because they drive like a much moreexpensive European sedan. “They aren’t selling well, so you can get a good deal.You go to a fleet buyer. You go in on the twenty fifth of the month. You knowthis...”) Then he launched into an impossibly long, sometimes hilarious,description of the several months he took to buy a new TV. If you or I had gonethrough the same experience—which involved sending televisions back, andlaborious comparison of the tiniest electronic details and warranty fine print—Isuspect we would have found it hellish. Alpert, apparently, found itexhilarating. Mavens, according to Price, are the kinds of people who are avidreaders of Consumer Reports. Alpert is the kind of Maven who writes to ConsumerReports to correct them. “One time they said that the Audi 4000 was based on theVolkswagen Dasher. This was the late 1970s. But the Audi 4000 is a bigger car. Iwrote them a letter. Then there was the Audi 5000 fiasco. Consumer Reports putthem on their list of thou shalt not buy because of this sudden accelerationproblem. But I read up on the problem in the literature and came to believe itwas bogus....So I wrote them and I said, you really ought to look into this. Igave them some information to consider. But I didn’t hear back from them. Itannoyed the hell out of me. They are supposed to be beyond that.” He shook hishead in disgust. He had out Mavened the Maven bible.Alpert is not, it should be said, an obnoxious know it all. It’s easy to see howhe could be, of course. Even Alpert is aware of that. “I was standing next to akid in the supermarket who had to show his I.D. to buy cigarettes,” Alpert toldme. “I was very tempted to tell him I was diagnosed with lung cancer. In a way,that desire to be of service and influence—whatever it is—can be taken too far.You can become nosy. I try to be a very passive Maven....You have to rememberthat it’s their decision. It’s their life.” What saves him is that you never getthe sense that he’s showing off. There’s something automatic, reflexive, abouthis level of involvement in the marketplace. It’s not an act. It’s very similarto the social instinct of Horchow and Weisberg. At one point Alpert launchedinto a complicated story of how to make the best use of coupons in rentingvideos at Blockbuster. Then he stopped himself, as if he realized what he wassaying, and burst out laughing. “Look, you can save a whole dollar! In a year’stime I could probably save enough for a whole bottle of wine.” Alpert is almostpathologically helpful. He can’t help himself. “A Maven is someone who wants tosolve other people’s problems, generally by solving his own,” Alpert said, whichis true, although what I suspect is that the opposite is also true, that a Mavenis someone who solves his own problems—his own emotional needs—by solving otherpeople’s problems. Something in Alpert was fulfilled in knowing that I wouldthereafter buy a television or a car or rent a hotel room in New York armed withthe knowledge he had given me.“Mark Alpert is a wonderfully unselfish man,” Leigh MacAllister, a colleague ofhis at the University of Texas, told me. “I would say he saved me fifteenthousand dollars when I first came to Austin. He helped me negotiate thepurchase of a house, because he understands the real estate game. I needed toget a washer and dryer. He got me a deal. I needed to get a car. I wanted to geta Volvo because I wanted to be just like Mark. Then he showed me an on lineservice that had the prices of Volvos all over the State of Texas and went withme to buy the car. He helped me through the maze of all the retirement plans atthe University of Texas. He simplified everything. He has everything processed.That’s Mark Alpert. That’s a Market Maven. God bless him. He’s what makes theAmerican system great.”8.What makes people like Mark Alpert so important in starting epidemics? Obviouslythey know things that the rest of us don’t. They read more magazines than therest of us, more newspapers, and they may be the only people who read junk mail.Mark Alpert happens to be a connoisseur of electronic equipment. If there was abreakthrough new television or videocamera, and you were a friend of his, youcan bet you would hear all about it quickly. Mavens have the knowledge and thesocial skills to start word of mouth epidemics. What sets Mavens apart, though,is not so much what they know but how they pass it along. The fact that Mavenswant to help, for no other reason than because they like to help, turns out tobe an awfully effective way of getting someone’s attention.This is surely part of the explanation for why Paul Revere’s message was sopowerful on the night of his midnight ride. News of the British march did notcome by fax, or by means of a group e-mail. It wasn’t broadcast on the nightlynews, surrounded by commercials. It was carried by a man, a volunteer, riding ona cold night with no personal agenda other than a concern for the liberty of hispeers. With Hush Puppies as well, perhaps the shoes caught the attention ofConnectors precisely because they weren’t part of any self conscious, commercialfashion trend. Maybe a fashion Maven went to the East Village, looking for newideas, and found out that you could get these really cool old Hush Puppies at acertain thrift store, for a very good price, and told his friends, who boughtthe shoes for themselves because there is something about the personal,disinterested, expert opinion of a Maven that makes us all sit up and listen.And why are the Zagat restaurant guides so popular? Partly it is because theyare a convenient guide to all the restaurants in a given town. But their realpower derives from the fact that the reviews are the reports of volunteers—ofdiners who want to share their opinions with others. Somehow that represents amore compelling recommendation than the opinion of an expert whose job it is torate restaurants.When I was talking to Alpert, I happened to mention that I was going to be inLos Angeles in a few weeks. “There is a place I really like, in Westwood,” hesaid, without hesitation. “The Century Wilshire. It’s a European bed andbreakfast. They have very nice rooms. A heated pool. Underground parking. Lasttime I was there, five, six years ago, rooms started in the seventies and juniorsuites were a hundred and ten. They’ll give you a rate for a week. They’ve gotan 800 number.” Since he was, after all, the Ur Maven, I stayed at the CenturyWilshire when I was in L.A., and it was everything he said it was and more.Within a few weeks of coming home, I had—completely out of character, I mightadd—recommended the Century Wilshire to two friends of mine, and within themonth two more, and as I began to imagine how many people of those I told aboutthe hotel had told about the hotel, and how many people like me Mark Alpert hadhimself told about the hotel, I realized that I had stepped into the middle of alittle Mark Alpert–generated, word of mouth epidemic. Alpert, of course,probably doesn’t know as many people as a Connector like Roger Horchow, so hedoesn’t quite have the same raw transmission power. But then again, if RogerHorchow talked to you on the eve of a trip to Los Angeles, he might not give youadvice on where to stay. Alpert always would. And if Horchow did make arecommendation, you might take him up on it or you might not. You would take theadvice as seriously as you take advice from any friend. But if Mark Alpert gaveyou advice, you would always take it. A Connector might tell ten friends whereto stay in Los Angeles, and half of them might take his advice. A Maven mighttell five people where to stay in Los Angeles but make the case for the hotel soemphatically that all of them would take his advice. These are differentpersonalities at work, acting for different reasons. But they both have thepower to spark word of mouth epidemics.9.The one thing that a Maven is not is a persuader. Alpert’s motivation is toeducate and to help. He’s not the kind of person who wants to twist your arm. Aswe talked, in fact, there were several key moments when he seemed to probe mefor information, to find out what I knew, so he could add it to his ownformidable database. To be a Maven is to be a teacher. But it is also, even moreemphatically, to be a student. Mavens are really information brokers, sharingand trading what they know. For a social epidemic to start, though, some peopleare actually going to have to be persuaded to do something. A good number of theyoung people who bought Hush Puppies, for instance, were people who once upon atime wouldn’t have been caught dead in them. Similarly, after Paul Revere hadpassed on his news, you can imagine that all of the men in the militia movementgathered around and made plans to confront the British the following morning.But it can’t have been an automatic process. Some people were probably gung ho.Some may have doubted the wisdom of confronting a trained, professional armywith a homegrown militia. Others—who may not have known Revere personally—mighthave been skeptical about the accuracy of his information. That almost everyone,in the end, fell in line is something that we would normally credit to peerpressure. But peer pressure is not always an automatic or an unconsciousprocess. It means, as often as not, that someone actually went up to one of hispeers and pressured him. In a social epidemic, Mavens are data banks. Theyprovide the message. Connectors are social glue: they spread it. But there isalso a select group of people—Salesmen—with the skills to persuade us when weare unconvinced of what we are hearing, and they are as critical to the tippingof word of mouth epidemics as the other two groups. Who are these Salesmen? Andwhat makes them so good at what they do?Tom Gau is a financial planner in Torrance, California, just south of LosAngeles. His firm—Kavesh and Gau—is the biggest in its field in southernCalifornia and one of the top financial planning firms in the country. He makesmillions of dollars a year. Donald Moine, a behavioral psychologist who haswritten widely on the subject of persuasion, told me to look up Gau because Gauis “mesmerizing.” And so he is. Tom Gau happens to sell financial planningservices. But he could, if he wanted to, sell absolutely anything. If we want tounderstand the persuasive personality type, Gau seems a good place to start.Gau is in his forties. He is good looking, without being pretty at all. He is ofmedium height, lean, with slightly shaggy dark hair, a mustache, and a littlebit of a hangdog expression. Give him a horse and a hat and he’d make anexcellent cowboy. He looks like the actor Sam Elliot. When we met, Gau shook myhand. But as he told me later, usually when he meets someone he gives him a hugor—if it is a woman—a big kiss. As you would expect from a great salesman, hehas a kind of natural exuberance.“I love my clients, okay? I’ll bend over backwards for them,” Gau said. “I callmy clients my family. I tell my clients, I’ve got two families. I’ve got my wifeand my kids and I’ve got you.” Gau talks quickly, but in fits and starts. He’salways revving up and gearing down. Sometimes when he is making an aside he willrev up even further, as if to put in his own verbal parentheses. He asks lots ofrhetorical questions. “I love my job. I love my job. I’m a workaholic. I gethere at six and seven in the morning. I get out at nine at night. I manage a lotof money. I’m one of the top producers in the nation. But I don’t tell myclients that. I’m not here because of that. I’m here to help people. I lovehelping people. I don’t have to work anymore. I’m financially independent. Sowhy am I here working these long hours? Because I love helping people. I lovepeople. It’s called a relationship.”Gau’s pitch is that his firm offers clients a level of service and expertisethey’ll have difficulty getting anywhere else. Across the hall from his officeis a law firm, affiliated with Kavesh and Gau, that handles wills and livingtrusts and all other legal matters related to financial planning. Gau hasinsurance specialists to handle insurance needs and stockbrokers to handleinvestments and retirement specialists for older clients. His arguments arerational and coherent. Moine has put together, in cooperation with Gau, what hecalls a financial planner’s script book. Moine’s argument is that what separatesa great salesman from an average one is the number and quality of answers theyhave to the objections commonly raised by potential clients. He sat down withGau, then, and tape recorded all of Gau’s answers and wrote them up in a book.Moine and Gau calculate that there are about twenty questions or statements thata planner needs to be prepared for. For example: “I can do it myself” is one,and for that the script book lists fifty potential answers. “Aren’t youconcerned about making the wrong moves and having no one there to help you?” forinstance. Or “I’m sure you do a good job at money management. However, did youknow most wives outlive their husbands? If something should happen to you, wouldshe be able to handle everything by herself?”I can imagine someone buying this script book and memorizing each of thesepotential responses. I can also imagine that same person, over time, gettingfamiliar enough with the material that he begins to judge, very well, what kindsof responses work best with what kinds of people. If you transcribed thatperson’s interactions with his clients, he would sound just like Tom Gau becausehe would be using all of Tom Gau’s words. According to the standard ways bywhich we measure persuasiveness—by the logic and appropriateness of thepersuader’s arguments—that should make the people using the script book everybit as persuasive as Tom Gau. But is that really true? What was interestingabout Gau is the extent to which he seemed to be persuasive in a way quitedifferent from the content of his words. He seems to have some kind ofindefinable trait, something powerful and contagious and irresistible that goesbeyond what comes out of his mouth, that makes people who meet him want to agreewith him. It’s energy. It’s enthusiasm. It’s charm. It’s likability. It’s allthose things and yet something more. At one point I asked him whether he washappy, and he fairly bounced off his chair.“Very. I’m probably the most optimistic person you could ever imagine. You takethe most optimistic person you know and take it to the hundredth power, that’sme. Because you know what, the power of positive thinking will overcome so manythings. There are so many people who are negative. Someone will say, you can’tdo that. And I’ll say, what do you mean I can’t do that? We moved up to Ashland,Oregon, a little over five years ago. We found a house we really liked. It hadbeen on the market for some time and it was a bit expensive. So I said to mywife, you know what, I’m going to make a ridiculously low offer. And she said,they’re never going to take that. I said, maybe not. What have we got to lose?The worst thing they can say is no. I’m not going to insult them. I’m going togive them my little pitch of here’s why I’m doing this. I’m going to make itclear what I’m suggesting. And you know what? They accepted the offer.” As Gautold me this story, I had no difficulty at all seeing him back in Ashland,somehow convincing the seller to part with his beautiful home for a ridiculousprice. “Gosh darn it,” Gau said, “if you don’t try, you’ll never succeed.”10.The question of what makes someone—or something—persuasive is a lot lessstraightforward than it seems. We know it when we see it. But just what “it” isis not always obvious. Consider the following two examples, both drawn from thepsychological literature. The first is an experiment that took place during the1984 presidential campaign between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale. For eightdays before the election, a group of psychologists led by Brian Mullen ofSyracuse University videotaped the three national nightly news programs, whichthen, as now, were anchored by Peter Jennings at ABC, Tom Brokaw at NBC, and DanRather at CBS. Mullen examined the tapes and excerpted all references to thecandidates, until he had 37 separate segments, each roughly two and a halfseconds long. Those segments were then shown, with the sound turned off, to agroup of randomly chosen people, who were asked to rate the facial expressionsof each newscaster in each segment. The subjects had no idea what kind ofexperiment they were involved with, or what the newscasters were talking about.They were simply asked to score the emotional content of the expressions ofthese three men on a 21 point scale, with the lowest being “extremely negative”and the highest point on the scale “extremely positive.”The results were fascinating. Dan Rather scored 10.46—which translates to analmost perfectly neutral expression—when he talked about Mondale, and 10.37 whenhe talked about Reagan. He looked the same when he talked about the Republicanas he did when he talked about the Democrat. The same was true for Brokaw, whoscored 11.21 for Mondale and 11.50 for Reagan. But Peter Jennings of ABC wasmuch different. For Mondale, he scored 13.38. But when he talked about Reagan,his face lit up so much he scored 17.44. Mullen and his colleagues went out oftheir way to try to come up with an innocent explanation for this. Could it be,for example, that Jennings is just more expressive in general than hiscolleagues? The answer seemed to be no. The subjects were also shown controlsegments of the three newscasters, as they talked about unequivocally happy orsad subjects (the funeral of Indira Gandhi; a breakthrough in treating acongenital disease). But Jennings didn’t score any higher on the happy subjectsor lower on the sad subjects than his counterparts. In fact, if anything, heseemed to be the least expressive of the three. It also isn’t the case thatJennings is simply someone who has a happy expression on his face all the time.Again, the opposite seemed to be true. On the “happy” segments inserted forcomparison purposes, he scored 14.13, which was substantially lower than bothRather and Brokaw. The only possible conclusion, according to the study, is thatJennings exhibited a “significant and noticeable bias in facial expression”toward Reagan.Now here is where the study gets interesting. Mullen and his colleagues thencalled up people in a number of cities around the country who regularly watchthe evening network news and asked them who they voted for. In every case, thosewho watched ABC voted for Reagan in far greater numbers than those who watchedCBS or NBC. In Cleveland, for example, 75 percent of ABC watchers votedRepublican, versus 61.9 percent of CBS or NBC viewers. In Williamstown,Massachusetts, ABC viewers were 71.4 percent for Reagan versus 50 percent forthe other two networks; in Erie, Pennsylvania, the difference was 73.7 percentto 50 percent. The subtle pro Reagan bias in Jennings’s face seems to haveinfluenced the voting behavior of ABC viewers.As you can imagine, ABC News disputes this study vigorously. (“It’s myunderstanding that I’m the only social scientist to have the dubious distinctionof being called a ‘jackass’ by Peter Jennings,” says Mullen.) It is hard tobelieve. Instinctively, I think, most of us would probably assume that thecausation runs in the opposite direction, that Reagan supporters are drawn toABC because of Jennings’s bias, not the other way around. But Mullen arguesfairly convincingly that this isn’t plausible. For example, on other, moreobvious levels—like, for example, story selection—ABC was shown to be thenetwork most hostile to Reagan, so it’s just as easy to imagine hard coreRepublicans deserting ABC news for the rival networks. And to answer thequestion of whether his results were simply a fluke, four years later, in theMichael Dukakis–George Bush campaign, Mullen repeated his experiment, with theexact same results. “Jennings showed more smiles when referring to theRepublican candidate than the Democrat,” Mullen said, “and again in a phonesurvey, viewers who watch ABC were more likely to have voted for Bush.”Here is another example of the subtleties of persuasion. A large group ofstudents were recruited for what they were told was a market research study by acompany making high tech headphones. They were each given a headset and toldthat the company wanted to test to see how well they worked when the listenerwas in motion—dancing up and down, say, or moving his or her head. All of thestudents listened to songs by Linda Ronstadt and the Eagles, and then heard aradio editorial arguing that tuition at their university should be raised fromits present level of $587 to $750. A third were told that while they listened tothe taped radio editorial they should nod their heads vigorously up and down.The next third were told to shake their heads from side to side. The final thirdwere the control group. They were told to keep their heads still. When they werefinished, all the students were given a short questionnaire, asking themquestions about the quality of the songs and the effect of the shaking. Slippedin at the end was the question the experimenters really wanted an answer to:“What do you feel would be an appropriate dollar amount for undergraduatetuition per year?”The answers to that question are just as difficult to believe as the answers tothe newscasters poll. The students who kept their heads still were unmoved bythe editorial. The tuition amount that they guessed was appropriate was $582—orjust about where tuition was already. Those who shook their heads from side toside as they listened to the editorial—even though they thought they were simplytesting headset quality—disagreed strongly with the proposed increase. Theywanted tuition to fall on average to $467 a year. Those who were told to nodtheir heads up and down, meanwhile, found the editorial very persuasive. Theywanted tuition to rise, on average, to $646. The simple act of moving theirheads up and down, ostensibly for another reason entirely—was sufficient tocause them to recommend a policy that would take money out of their own pockets.Somehow nodding, in the end, mattered as much as Peter Jennings’s smiles did inthe 1984 election.There are in these two studies, I think, very important clues as to what makessomeone like Tom Gau—or, for that matter, any of the Salesmen in our lives—soeffective. The first is that little things can, apparently, make as much of adifference as big things. In the headphone study, the editorial had no impact onthose whose heads were still. It wasn’t particularly persuasive. But as soon aslisteners started nodding, it became very persuasive. In the case of Jennings,Mullen says that someone’s subtle signals in favor of one politician or anotherusually don’t matter at all. But in the particular, unguarded way that peoplewatch the news, a little bias can suddenly go a long way. “When people watch thenews, they don’t intentionally filter biases out, or feel they have to argueagainst the expression of the newscaster,” Mullen explains. “It’s not likesomeone saying: this is a very good candidate who deserves your vote. This isn’tan obvious verbal message that we automatically dig in our heels against. It’smuch more subtle and for that reason much more insidious, and that much harderto insulate ourselves against.”The second implication of these studies is that nonverbal cues are as or moreimportant than verbal cues. The subtle circumstances surrounding how we saythings may matter more than what we say. Jennings, after all, wasn’t injectingall kinds of pro Reagan comments in his newscasts. In fact, as I mentioned, ABCwas independently observed to have been the most hostile to Reagan. One of theconclusions of the authors of the headphones study—Gary Wells of the Universityof Alberta and Richard Petty of the University of Missouri—was that “televisionadvertisements would be most effective if the visual display created repetitivevertical movement of the television viewers’ heads (e.g., bouncing ball).”Simple physical movements and observations can have a profound effect on how wefeel and think.The third—and perhaps most important—implication of these studies is thatpersuasion often works in ways that we do not appreciate. It’s not that smilesand nods are subliminal messages. They are straightforward and on the surface.It’s just that they are incredibly subtle. If you asked the head nodders whythey wanted tuition to increase so dramatically—tuition that would come out oftheir own pockets—none of them would say, because I was nodding my head while Ilistened to that editorial. They’d probably say that it was because they foundthe editorial particularly insightful or intelligent. They would attribute theirattitudes to some more obvious, logical cause. Similarly the ABC viewers whovoted for Reagan would never, in a thousand years, tell you that they voted thatway because Peter Jennings smiled every time he mentioned the President. They’dsay that it was because they liked Reagan’s policies, or they thought he wasdoing a good job. It would never have occurred to them that they could bepersuaded to reach a conclusion by something so arbitrary and seeminglyinsignificant as a smile or a nod from a newscaster. If we want to understandwhat makes someone like Tom Gau so persuasive, in other words, we have to lookat much more than his obvious eloquence. We need to look at the subtle, thehidden, and the unspoken.11.What happens when two people talk? That is really the basic question here,because that’s the basic context in which all persuasion takes place. We knowthat people talk back and forth. They listen. They interrupt. They move theirhands. In the case of my meeting with Tom Gau, we were sitting in a modest sizeoffice. I was in a chair pulled up in front of his desk. I had my legs crossedand a pad and pen on my lap. I was wearing a blue shirt and black pants and ablack jacket. He was sitting behind the desk in a high backed chair. He waswearing a pair of blue suit pants and a crisply pressed white shirt and a redtie. Some of the time he leaned forward and planted his elbows in front of him.Other times he sat back in his chair and waved his hands in the air. Between us,on the blank surface of the desk, I placed my tape recorder. That’s what youwould have seen, if I showed you a videotape of our meeting. But if you hadtaken that videotape and slowed it down, until you were looking at ourinteraction in slices of a fraction of a second, you would have seen somethingquite different. You would have seen the two of us engaging in what can only bedescribed as an elaborate and precise dance.The pioneer of this kind of analysis—of what is called the study of culturalmicrorhythms—is a man named William Condon. In one of his most famous researchprojects in the 1960s he attempted to decode a four and a half second segment offilm, in which a woman says to a man and a child, over dinner: “You all shouldcome around every night. We never have had a dinnertime like this in months.”Condon broke the film into individual frames, each representing about 1/45th ofa second. Then he watched—and watched. As he describes it:To carefully study the organization and sequence of this, the approach must benaturalistic or ethological. You just sit and look and look and look forthousands of hours until the order in the material begins to emerge. It’s likesculpturing....Continued study reveals further order. When I was looking at thisfilm over and over again, I had an erroneous view of the universe thatcommunication takes place between people. Somehow this was the model. You sendthe message, somebody sends the message back. The messages go here and there andeverywhere. But something was funny about this.Condon spent a year and a half on that short segment of film, until, finally, inhis peripheral vision, he saw what he had always sensed was there: “the wifeturning her head exactly as the husband’s hands came up.” From there he pickedup other micromovements, other patterns that occurred over and over again, untilhe realized that in addition to talking and listening, the three people aroundthe table were also engaging in what he termed “interactional synchrony.” Theirconversation had a rhythmic physical dimension. Each person would, within thespace of one or two or three 1/45th of a second frames, move a shoulder or cheekor an eyebrow or a hand, sustain that movement, stop it, change direction, andstart again. And what’s more, those movements were perfectly in time to eachperson’s own words—emphasizing and underlining and elaborating on the process ofarticulation—so that the speaker was, in effect, dancing to his or her ownspeech. At the same time the other people around the table were dancing along aswell, moving their faces and shoulders and hands and bodies to the same rhythm.It’s not that everyone was moving the same way, any more than people dancing toa song all dance the same way. It’s that the timing of stops and starts of eachperson’s micromovements—the jump and shifts of body and face—were perfectly inharmony.Subsequent research has revealed that it isn’t just gesture that is harmonized,but also conversational rhythm. When two people talk, their volume and pitchfall into balance. What linguists call speech rate—the number of speech soundsper second—equalizes. So does what is known as latency, the period of time thatlapses between the moment one speaker stops talking and the moment the otherspeaker begins. Two people may arrive at a conversation with very differentconversational patterns. But almost instantly they reach a common ground. We alldo it, all the time. Babies as young as one or two days old synchronize theirhead, elbow, shoulder, hip, and foot movements with the speech patterns ofadults. Synchrony has even been found in the interactions of humans and apes.It’s part of the way we are hardwired.When Tom Gau and I sat across from each other in his office, then, we almostimmediately fell into physical and conversational harmony. We were dancing. Evenbefore he attempted to persuade me with his words, he had forged a bond with mewith his movements and his speech. So what made my encounter with him different,so much more compelling than the conversational encounters I have every day? Itisn’t that Gau was deliberately trying to harmonize himself with me. Some bookson salesmanship recommend that persuaders try to mirror the posture or talkingstyles of their clients in order to establish rapport. But that’s been shown notto work. It makes people more uncomfortable, not less. It’s too obviously phony.What we are talking about is a kind of super reflex, a fundamental physiologicalability of which we are barely aware. And like all specialized human traits,some people have much more mastery over this reflex than others. Part of what itmeans to have a powerful or persuasive personality, then, is that you can drawothers into your own rhythms and dictate the terms of the interaction. In somestudies, students who have a high degree of synchrony with their teachers arehappier, more enthused, interested, and easygoing. What I felt with Gau was thatI was being seduced, not in the sexual sense, of course, but in a global way,that our conversation was being conducted on his terms, not mine. I felt I wasbecoming synchronized with him. “Skilled musicians know this, and goodspeakers,” says Joseph Cappella, who teaches at the Annenberg School ofCommunication at the University of Pennsylvania. “They know when the crowds arewith them, literally in synchrony with them, in movements and nods and stillnessin moments of attention.” It is a strange thing to admit, because I didn’t wantto be drawn in. I was on guard against it. But the essence of Salesmen is that,on some level, they cannot be resisted. “Tom can build a level of trust andrapport in five to ten minutes that most people will take half an hour to do,”Moine says of Gau.There is another, more specific dimension to this. When two people talk, theydon’t just fall into physical and aural harmony. They also engage in what iscalled motor mimicry. If you show people pictures of a smiling face or afrowning face, they’ll smile or frown back, although perhaps only in muscularchanges so fleeting that they can only be captured with electronic sensors. If Ihit my thumb with a hammer, most people watching will grimace: they’ll mimic myemotional state. This is what is meant, in the technical sense, by empathy. Weimitate each other’s emotions as a way of expressing support and caring and,even more basically, as a way of communicating with each other.In their brilliant 1994 book Emotional Contagion, the psychologists ElaineHatfield and John Cacioppo and the historian Richard Rapson go one step further.Mimicry, they argue, is also one of the means by which we infect each other withour emotions. In other words, if I smile and you see me and smile inresponse—even a microsmile that takes no more than several milliseconds—it’s notjust you imitating or empathizing with me. It may also be a way that I can passon my happiness to you. Emotion is contagious. In a way, this is perfectlyintuitive. All of us have had our spirits picked up by being around somebody ina good mood. If you think about this closely, though, it’s quite a radicalnotion. We normally think of the expressions on our face as the reflection of aninner state. I feel happy, so I smile. I feel sad, so I frown. Emotion goesinside out. Emotional contagion, though, suggests that the opposite is alsotrue. If I can make you smile, I can make you happy. If I can make you frown, Ican make you sad. Emotion, in this sense, goes outside in.If we think about emotion this way—as outside in, not inside out—it is possibleto understand how some people can have an enormous amount of influence overothers. Some of us, after all, are very good at expressing emotions andfeelings, which means that we are far more emotionally contagious than the restof us. Psychologists call these people “senders.” Senders have specialpersonalities. They are also physiologically different. Scientists who havestudied faces, for example, report that there are huge differences among peoplein the location of facial muscles, in their form, and also—surprisingly—even intheir prevalence. “It is a situation not unlike in medicine,” says Cacioppo.“There are carriers, people who are very expressive, and there are people whoare especially susceptible. It’s not that emotional contagion is a disease. Butthe mechanism is the same.”Howard Friedman, a psychologist at the University of California at Riverside,has developed what he calls the Affective Communication Test to measure thisability to send emotion, to be contagious. The test is a self administeredsurvey, with thirteen questions relating to things like whether you can keepstill when you hear good dance music, how loud your laugh is, whether you touchfriends when you talk to them, how good you are at sending seductive glances,whether you like to be the center of attention. The highest possible score onthe test is 117 points, with the average score, according to Friedman, somewherearound 71.What does it mean to be a high scorer? To answer that, Friedman conducted afascinating experiment. He picked a few dozen people who had scored very high onhis test—above 90—and a few dozen who scored very low—below 60—and asked themall to fill out a questionnaire measuring how they felt “at this instant.” Hethen put all of the high scorers in separate rooms, and paired each of them withtwo low scorers. They were told to sit in the room together for two minutes.They could look at each other, but not talk. Then, once the session was over,they were asked again to fill out a detailed questionnaire on how they werefeeling. Friedman found that in just two minutes, without a word being spoken,the low scorers ended up picking up the moods of the high scorers. If thecharismatic person started out depressed, and the inexpressive person startedout happy, by the end of the two minutes the inexpressive person was depressedas well. But it didn’t work the other way. Only the charismatic person couldinfect the other people in the room with his or her emotions.Is this what Tom Gau did to me? The thing that strikes me most about myencounter with him was his voice. He had the range of an opera singer. At times,he would sound stern. (His favorite expression in that state: “Excuse me?”) Attimes, he would drawl, lazily and easily. At other times, he would chuckle as hespoke, making his words sing with laughter. In each of those modes his facewould light up accordingly, moving, easily and deftly, from one state toanother. There was no ambiguity in his presentation. Everything was written onhis face. I could not see my own face, of course, but my guess is that it was aclose mirror of his. It is interesting, in this context, to think back on theexperiment with the nodding and the headphones. There was an example of someonepersuaded from the outside in, of an external gesture affecting an internaldecision. Was I nodding when Tom Gau nodded? And shaking my head when Gau shookhis head? Later, I called Gau up and asked him to take Howard Friedman’scharisma test. As we went through the list, question by question, he startedchuckling. By question 11—“I am terrible at pantomime, as in games likecharades”—he was laughing out loud. “I’m great at that! I always win atcharades!” Out of a possible 117 points, he scored 116.12.In the early hours of April 19, 1775, the men of Lexington, Massachusetts, beganto gather on the town common. They ranged in age from sixteen to sixty and werecarrying a motley collection of muskets and swords and pistols. As the alarmspread that morning, their numbers were steadily swelled by groups of militiafrom the surrounding towns. Dedham sent four companies. In Lynn, men left ontheir own for Lexington. In towns further west that did not get the news untilmorning, farmers were in such haste to join the battle in Lexington that theyliterally left their plows in the fields. In many towns, virtually the wholemale population was mustered for the fight. The men had no uniforms, so theywore ordinary clothes: coats to ward off the early morning chill and largebrimmed hats.As the colonists rushed toward Lexington, the British Regulars (as they wereknown) were marching in formation toward the town as well. By dawn, theadvancing soldiers could see figures all around them in the half light, armedmen running through the surrounding fields, outpacing the British in their rushto get to Lexington. As the Regulars neared the town center, they could heardrums beating in the distance. Finally the British came upon Lexington Commonand the two sides met face to face: several hundred British soldiers confrontingless than a hundred militia. In that first exchange, the British got the best ofthe colonists, gunning down seven militiamen in a brief flurry of gunshots onthe common. But that was only the first of what would be several battles thatday. When the British moved on to Concord, to systematically search for thecache of guns and ammunition they had been told was stored there, they wouldclash with the militia again, and this time they would be soundly defeated. Thiswas the beginning of the American Revolution, a war that before it was overwould claim many lives and consume the entire American colony. When the Americancolonists declared independence the following year, it would be hailed as avictory for an entire nation. But that is not the way it began. It began on acold spring morning, with a word of mouth epidemic that spread from a littlestable boy to all of New England, relying along the way on a small number ofvery special people: a few Salesmen and a man with the particular genius of botha Maven and a Connector."},{"pageContent":"THREE [TippingPoint_toc.html#chap_3]The Stickiness FactorSESAME STREET, BLUE’S CLUES,AND THE EDUCATIONAL VIRUSIn the late 1960s, a television producer named Joan Ganz Cooney set out to startan epidemic. Her target was three , four , and five year olds. Her agent ofinfection was television, and the “virus” she wanted to spread was literacy. Theshow would last an hour and run five days a week, and the hope was that if thathour was contagious enough it could serve as an educational Tipping Point:giving children from disadvantaged homes a leg up once they began elementaryschool, spreading prolearning values from watchers to nonwatchers, infectingchildren and their parents, and lingering long enough to have an impact wellafter the children stopped watching the show. Cooney probably wouldn’t have usedthese concepts or described her goals in precisely this way. But what she wantedto do, in essence, was create a learning epidemic to counter the prevailingepidemics of poverty and illiteracy. She called her idea Sesame Street.By any measure, this was an audacious idea. Television is a great way to reachlots of people, very easily and cheaply. It entertains and dazzles. But it isn’ta particularly educational medium. Gerald Lesser, a Harvard Universitypsychologist who joined with Cooney in founding Sesame Street, says that when hewas first asked to join the project, back in the late 1960s, he was skeptical.“I had always been very much into fitting how you teach to what you know aboutthe child,” he says. “You try to find the kid’s strengths, so you can play tothem. You try to understand the kid’s weaknesses, so you can avoid them. Thenyou try and teach that individual kid’s profile....Television has no potential,no power to do that.” Good teaching is interactive. It engages the childindividually. It uses all the senses. It responds to the child. But a televisionis just a talking box. In experiments, children who are asked to read a passageand are then tested on it will invariably score higher than children asked towatch a video of the same subject matter. Educational experts describetelevision as “low involvement.” Television is like a strain of the common coldthat can spread like lightning through a population, but only causes a fewsniffles and is gone in a day.But Cooney and Lesser and a third partner—Lloyd Morrisett of the MarkleFoundation in New York—set out to try anyway. They enlisted some of the topcreative minds of the period. They borrowed techniques from televisioncommercials to teach children about numbers. They used the live animation ofSaturday morning cartoons to teach lessons about learning the alphabet. Theybrought in celebrities to sing and dance and star in comedy sketches that taughtchildren about the virtues of cooperation or about their own emotions. SesameStreet aimed higher and tried harder than any other children’s show had, and theextraordinary thing was that it worked. Virtually every time the show’seducational value has been tested—and Sesame Street has been subject to moreacademic scrutiny than any television show in history—it has been proved toincrease the reading and learning skills of its viewers. There are few educatorsand child psychologists who don’t believe that the show managed to spread itsinfectious message well beyond the homes of those who watched the showregularly. The creators of Sesame Street accomplished something extraordinary,and the story of how they did that is a marvelous illustration of the second ofthe rules of the Tipping Point, the Stickiness Factor. They discovered that bymaking small but critical adjustments in how they presented ideas topreschoolers, they could overcome television’s weakness as a teaching tool andmake what they had to say memorable. Sesame Street succeeded because it learnedhow to make television sticky.1.The Law of the Few, which I talked about in the previous chapter, says that onecritical factor in epidemics is the nature of the messenger. A pair of shoes ora warning or an infection or a new movie can become highly contagious and tipsimply by being associated with a particular kind of person. But in all thoseexamples, I took it as given that the message itself was something that could bepassed on. Paul Revere started a word of mouth epidemic with the phrase “TheBritish are coming.” If he had instead gone on that midnight ride to tell peoplehe was having a sale on the pewter mugs at his silversmith shop, even he, withall his enormous personal gifts, could not have galvanized the Massachusettscountryside.Roger Horchow, likewise, faxed all his friends about the restaurant his daughtertook him to, performing the first step in creating a word of mouth epidemic. Butobviously, for that epidemic to take off, the restaurant itself had to remain agood restaurant. It had to be the kind of restaurant that made an impact on thepeople who ate there. In epidemics, the messenger matters: messengers are whatmake something spread. But the content of the message matters too. And thespecific quality that a message needs to be successful is the quality of“stickiness.” Is the message—or the food, or the movie, or theproduct—memorable? Is it so memorable, in fact, that it can create change, thatit can spur someone to action?Stickiness sounds as if it should be straightforward. When most of us want tomake sure what we say is remembered, we speak with emphasis. We talk loudly, andwe repeat what we have to say over and over again. Marketers feel the same way.There is a maxim in the advertising business that an advertisement has to beseen at least six times before anyone will remember it. That’s a useful lessonfor Coca Cola or Nike, who have hundreds of millions of dollars to spend onmarketing and can afford to saturate all forms of media with their message. Butit’s not all that useful for, say, a group of people trying to spark a literacyepidemic with a small budget and one hour of programming on public television.Are there smaller, subtler, easier ways to make something stick?Consider the field of direct marketing. A company buys an ad in a magazine orsends out a direct mailing with a coupon attached that they want the reader toclip and mail back to them with a check for their product. Reaching the consumerwith the message is not the hard part of direct marketing. What is difficult isgetting consumers to stop, read the advertisement, remember it, and then act onit. To figure out which ads work the best, direct marketers do extensivetesting. They might create a dozen different versions of the same ad and runthem simultaneously in a dozen different cities and compare the response ratesto each. Conventional advertisers have preconceived ideas about what makes anadvertisement work: humor, splashy graphics, a celebrity endorser. Directmarketers, by contrast, have few such preconceptions, because the number ofcoupons that are mailed back or the number of people who call in on an 800number in response to a television commercial gives them an objective, iron cladmeasure of effectiveness. In the advertising world, direct marketers are thereal students of stickiness, and some of the most intriguing conclusions abouthow to reach consumers have come from their work.In the 1970s, for example, the legendary direct marketer Lester Wunderman had ashowdown with the Madison Avenue firm McCann Erickson over the Columbia RecordClub account. Columbia was then—as it is now—one of the largest mail order clubsin the world, and Wunderman had handled the company’s advertising since it wasformed in the 1950s. Columbia decided, however, to hire McCann to come up with aseries of television commercials to support the direct marketing print ads thatWunderman was creating. These were not late night commercials with a toll free800 number. They were standard television spots designed simply to raiseawareness. Understandably, Wunderman was upset. He had handled the Columbiaaccount for twenty years and didn’t like the idea of losing even a small part ofthe business to a competitor. Nor was he convinced that McCann’s advertisingwould actually do Columbia any good. To settle the issue, he proposed a test.Columbia, he said, should run a full complement of the advertising created byhis firm in the local editions of TV Guide and Parade magazine in twenty sixmedia markets around the United States. In thirteen of those markets, McCannshould be allowed to air its “awareness” television commercials. In the otherthirteen, Wunderman would air his own set of television commercials. Whoever’scommercials created the greatest increase in response to the local TV Guide andParade advertising would win the whole account. Columbia agreed, and after amonth they tabulated the results. Responses in Wunderman’s markets were up 80percent, compared to 19.5 percent for McCann. Wunderman had won in a rout.The key to Wunderman’s success was something he called the “treasure hunt.” Inevery TV Guide and Parade ad, he had his art director put a little gold box inthe corner of the order coupon. Then his firm wrote a series of TV commercialsthat told the “secret of the Gold Box.” Viewers were told that if they couldfind the gold box in their issues of Parade and TV Guide, they could write inthe name of any record on the Columbia list and get that record free. The goldbox, Wunderman theorized, was a kind of trigger. It gave viewers a reason tolook for the ads in TV Guide and Parade. It created a connection between theColumbia message viewers saw on television and the message they read in amagazine. The gold box, Wunderman writes, “made the reader/viewer part of aninteractive advertising system. Viewers were not just an audience but had becomeparticipants. It was like playing a game....The effectiveness of the campaignwas startling. In 1977, none of Columbia’s ads in its extensive magazineschedule had been profitable. In 1978, with Gold Box television support, everymagazine on the schedule made a profit, an unprecedented turnaround.”What’s interesting about this story is that by every normal expectation McCannshould have won the test. The gold box idea sounds like a really cheesy idea.Columbia was so skeptical of it that it took Wunderman several years to persuadethem to let him try it. McCann, meanwhile, was one of the darlings of MadisonAvenue, a firm renowned for its creativity and sophistication. Furthermore,McCann spent four times as much as Wunderman on media time. They bought primetime slots for their space. Wunderman’s ads were on in the wee hours of themorning. In the last chapter, I talked about how epidemics are, in part, afunction of how many people a message reaches, and by that standard McCann wasway ahead. McCann did all the big things right. But they didn’t have that littlefinal touch, that gold box, that would make their message stick.If you look closely at epidemic ideas or messages, as often as not the elementsthat make them sticky turn out to be as small and as seemingly trivial asWunderman’s gold box. Consider, for example, the so called fear experimentsconducted by the social psychologist Howard Levanthal in the 1960s. Levanthalwanted to see if he could persuade a group of college seniors at Yale Universityto get a tetanus shot. He divided them up into several groups, and gave all ofthem a seven page booklet explaining the dangers of tetanus, the importance ofinoculation, and the fact that the university was offering free tetanus shots atthe campus health center to all interested students. The booklets came inseveral versions. Some of the students were given a “high fear” version, whichdescribed tetanus in dramatic terms and included color photographs of a childhaving a tetanus seizure and other tetanus victims with urinary catheters,tracheotomy wounds, and nasal tubes. In the “low fear” version, the languagedescribing the risks of tetanus was toned down, and the photographs wereomitted. Levanthal wanted to see what impact the different booklets had on thestudents’ attitudes toward tetanus and their likelihood of getting a shot.The results were, in part, quite predictable. When they were given aquestionnaire later, all the students appeared to be well educated about thedangers of tetanus. But those who were given the high fear booklet were moreconvinced of the dangers of tetanus, more convinced of the importance of shots,and were more likely to say that they intended to get inoculated. All of thosedifferences evaporated, however, when Levanthal looked at how many of thestudents actually went and got a shot. One month after the experiments, almostnone of the subjects—a mere 3 percent—had actually gone to the health center toget inoculated. For some reason, the students had forgotten everything they hadlearned about tetanus, and the lessons they had been told weren’t translatinginto action. The experiment didn’t stick. Why not?If we didn’t know about the Stickiness Factor, we probably would conclude thatsomething was wrong with the way the booklet explained tetanus to the students.We might wonder whether trying to scare them was the appropriate direction totake, whether there was a social stigma surrounding tetanus that inhibitedstudents from admitting that they were at risk, or perhaps that medical careitself was intimidating to students. In any case, that only 3 percent ofstudents responded suggested that there was a long way to go to reach the goal.But the Stickiness Factor suggests something quite different. It suggests thatthe problem probably wasn’t with the overall conception of the message at all,and that maybe all the campaign needed was a little gold box. Sure enough, whenLevanthal redid the experiment, one small change was sufficient to tip thevaccination rate up to 28 percent. It was simply including a map of the campus,with the university health building circled and the times that shots wereavailable clearly listed.There are two interesting results of this study. The first is that of the 28percent who got inoculated, an equal number were from the high fear and the lowfear group. Whatever extra persuasive muscle was found in the high fear bookletwas clearly irrelevant. The students knew, without seeing gory pictures, whatthe dangers of tetanus were, and what they ought to be doing. The secondinteresting thing is that, of course, as seniors they must have already knownwhere the health center was, and doubtless had visited it several times already.It is doubtful that any of them would ever actually have used the map. In otherwords, what the tetanus intervention needed in order to tip was not an avalancheof new or additional information. What it needed was a subtle but significantchange in presentation. The students needed to know how to fit the tetanus stuffinto their lives; the addition of the map and the times when the shots wereavailable shifted the booklet from an abstract lesson in medical risk—a lessonno different from the countless other academic lessons they had received overtheir academic career—to a practical and personal piece of medical advice. Andonce the advice became practical and personal, it became memorable.There are enormous implications in Levanthal’s fear experiments and Wunderman’swork for Columbia Records for the question of how to start and tip socialepidemics. We have become, in our society, overwhelmed by people clamoring forour attention. In just the past decade, the time devoted to advertisements in atypical hour of network television has grown from six minutes to nine minutes,and it continues to climb every year. The New York–based firm Media Dynamicsestimates that the average American is now exposed to 254 different commercialmessages in a day, up nearly 25 percent since the mid 1970s. There are nowmillions of web sites on the Internet, cable systems routinely carry over 50channels of programming, and a glance inside the magazine section of anybookstore will tell you that there are thousands of magazines coming out eachweek and month, chock full of advertising and information. In the advertisingbusiness, this surfeit of information is called the “clutter” problem, andclutter has made it harder and harder to get any one message to stick. Coca Colapaid $33 million for the rights to sponsor the 1992 Olympics, but despite a hugeadvertising push, only about 12 percent of TV viewers realized that they werethe official Olympic soft drink, and another 5 percent thought that Pepsi wasthe real sponsor. According to a study done by one advertising research firm,whenever there are at least four different 15 second commercials in a two and ahalf minute commercial time out, the effectiveness of any one 15 second ad sinksto almost zero. Much of what we are told or read or watch, we simply don’tremember. The information age has created a stickiness problem. But Levanthaland Wunderman’s examples suggest that there may be simple ways to enhancestickiness and systematically engineer stickiness into a message. This is a factof obvious importance to marketers, teachers, and managers. Perhaps no one hasdone more to illustrate the potential of this kind of stickiness engineering,however, than children’s educational television, in particular the creators ofSesame Street and, later, the show it inspired, Blue’s Clues.2.Sesame Street is best known for the creative geniuses it attracted, people likeJim Henson and Joe Raposo and Frank Oz, who intuitively grasped what it takes toget through to children. They were television’s answer to Beatrix Potter or L.Frank Baum or Dr. Seuss. But it is a mistake to think of Sesame Street as aproject conceived in a flash of insight. What made the show unusual, in fact,was the extent to which it was exactly the opposite of that—the extent to whichthe final product was deliberately and painstakingly engineered. Sesame Streetwas built about a single, breakthrough insight: that if you can hold theattention of children, you can educate them.This may seem obvious, but it isn’t. Many critics of television, to this day,argue that what’s dangerous about TV is that it is addictive, that children andeven adults watch it like zombies. According to this view, it is the formalfeatures of television—violence, bright lights, loud and funny noises, quickediting cuts, zooming in and out, exaggerated action, and all the other thingswe associate with commercial TV—that hold our attention. In other words, wedon’t have to understand what we are looking at, or absorb what we are seeing,in order to keep watching. That’s what many people mean when they say thattelevision is passive. We watch when we are stimulated by all the whizzes andbangs of the medium. And we look away, or turn the channel, when we are bored.What the pioneering television researchers of the 1960s and 1970s—in particular,Daniel Anderson at the University of Massachusetts—began to realize, however, isthat this isn’t how preschoolers watch TV at all. “The idea was that kids wouldsit, stare at the screen, and zone out,” said Elizabeth Lorch, a psychologist atAmherst College. “But once we began to look carefully at what children weredoing, we found out that short looks were actually more common. There was muchmore variation. Children didn’t just sit and stare. They could divide theirattention between a couple of different activities. And they weren’t beingrandom. There were predictable influences on what made them look back at thescreen, and these were not trivial things, not just flash and dash.” Lorch, forinstance, once reedited an episode of Sesame Street so that certain key scenesof some of the sketches were out of order. If kids were only interested in flashand dash, that shouldn’t have made a difference. The show, after all, still hadsongs and Muppets and bright colors and action and all the things that makeSesame Street so wonderful. But it did make a difference. The kids stoppedwatching. If they couldn’t make sense of what they were looking at, they weren’tgoing to look at it.In another experiment, Lorch and Dan Anderson showed two groups of five yearolds an episode of Sesame Street. The kids in the second group, however, wereput in a room with lots of very attractive toys on the floor. As you wouldexpect, the kids in the room without the toys watched the show about 87 percentof the time, while the kids with the toys watched only about 47 percent of theshow. Kids are distracted by toys. But when they tested the two groups to seehow much of the show the children remembered and understood, the scores wereexactly the same. This result stunned the two researchers. Kids, they realized,were a great deal more sophisticated in the way they watched than had beenimagined. “We were led to the conclusion,” they wrote, “that the five year oldsin the toys group were attending quite strategically, distributing theirattention between toy play and viewing so that they looked at what for them werethe most informative parts of the program. This strategy was so effective thatthe children could gain no more from increased attention.”If you take these two studies together—the toys study and the editing study—youreach quite a radical conclusion about children and television. Kids don’t watchwhen they are stimulated and look away when they are bored. They watch when theyunderstand and look away when they are confused. If you are in the business ofeducational television, this is a critical difference. It means if you want toknow whether—and what—kids are learning from a TV show, all you have to do is tonotice what they are watching. And if you want to know what kids aren’tlearning, all you have to do is notice what they aren’t watching. Preschoolersare so sophisticated in their viewing behavior that you can determine thestickiness of children’s programming by simple observation.The head of research for Sesame Street in the early years was a psychologistfrom Oregon, Ed Palmer, whose specialty was the use of television as a teachingtool. When the Children’s Television Workshop was founded in the late 1960s,Palmer was a natural recruit. “I was the only academic they could find doingresearch on children’s TV,” he says, with a laugh. Palmer was given the task offinding out whether the elaborate educational curriculum that had been devisedfor Sesame Street by its academic advisers was actually reaching the show’sviewers. It was a critical task. There are those involved with Sesame Street whosay, in fact, that without Ed Palmer the show would never have lasted throughthe first season.Palmer’s innovation was something he called the Distracter. He would play anepisode of Sesame Street on a television monitor, and then run a slide show on ascreen next to it, showing a new slide every seven and a half seconds. “We hadthe most varied set of slides we could imagine,” said Palmer. “We would have abody riding down the street with his arms out, a picture of a tall building, aleaf floating through ripples of water, a rainbow, a picture taken through amicroscope, an Escher drawing. Anything to be novel, that was the idea.”Preschoolers would then be brought into the room, two at a time, and told towatch the television show. Palmer and his assistants would sit slightly to theside, with a pencil and paper, quietly noting when the children were watchingSesame Street and when they lost interest and looked, instead, at the slideshow. Every time the slide changed, Palmer and his assistants would make a newnotation, so that by the end of the show they had an almost second by secondaccount of what parts of the episode being tested managed to hold the viewers’attention and what parts did not. The Distracter was a stickiness machine.“We’d take that big sized chart paper, two by three feet, and tape several ofthose sheets together,” Palmer says. “We had data points, remember, for everyseven and a half seconds, which comes to close to four hundred data points for asingle program, and we’d connect all those points with a red line so it wouldlook like a stock market report from Wall Street. It might plummet or graduallydecline, and we’d say whoa, what’s going on here. At other times it might hugthe very top of the chart and we’d say, wow, that segment’s really grabbing theattention of the kids. We tabulated those Distracter scores in percentages. We’dhave up to 100 percent sometimes. The average attention for most shows wasaround 85 to 90 percent. If the producers got that, they were happy. If they gotaround fifty, they’d go back to the drawing board.”Palmer tested other children’s shows, like the Tom and Jerry cartoons, orCaptain Kangaroo, and compared what sections of those shows worked with whatsections of Sesame Street worked. Whatever Palmer learned, he fed back to theshow’s producers and writers, so they could fine tune the material accordingly.One of the standard myths about children’s television, for example, had alwaysbeen that kids love to watch animals. “The producers would bring in a cat or ananteater or an otter and show it and let it cavort around,” Palmer says. “Theythought that would be interesting. But our Distracter showed that it was a bombevery time.” A huge effort went into a Sesame Street character called the Manfrom Alphabet, whose specialty was puns. Palmer showed that kids hated him. Hewas canned. The Distracter showed that no single segment of the Sesame Streetformat should go beyond four minutes, and that three minutes was probablyoptimal. He forced the producers to simplify dialogue and abandon certaintechniques they had taken from adult television. “We found to our surprise thatour preschool audience didn’t like it when the adult cast got into a contentiousdiscussion,” he remembers. “They didn’t like it when two or three people wouldbe talking at once. That’s the producers’ natural instinct, to hype a scene bycreating confusion. It’s supposed to tell you that this is exciting. The fact isthat our kids turned away from that kind of situation. Instead of picking up onthe signal that something exciting is going on, they picked up on the signalthat something confusing is going on. And they’d lose interest.“After the third or fourth season, I’d say it was rare that we ever had asegment below eighty five percent. We would almost never see something in thefifty to sixty percent range, and if we did, we’d fix it. You know Darwin’sterms about the survival of the fittest? We had a mechanism to identify thefittest and decide what should survive.”The most important thing that Palmer ever found out with the Distracter, though,came at the very beginning, before Sesame Street was even on the air. “It wasthe summer of 1969 and we were a month and a half from air date,” Lesserremembers. “We decided, let’s go for broke. Let’s produce five full shows—onehour each—before we go to air and we’ll see what we’ve got.” To test the shows,Palmer took them to Philadelphia and over the third week of July showed them togroups of preschoolers in sixty different homes throughout the city. It was adifficult period. Philadelphia was in the midst of a heat wave, which made thechildren who were supposed to watch the show restless and inattentive. In thesame week, as well, Apollo 11 landed on the moon, and somechildren—understandably—seemed to prefer that historic moment to Sesame Street.Worst of all were the conclusions from Palmer’s Distracter. “What we found,”Lesser says, “almost destroyed us.”The problem was that when the show was originally conceived, the decision wasmade that all fantasy elements of the show be separated from the real elements.This was done at the insistence of many child psychologists, who felt that tomix fantasy and reality would be misleading to children. The Muppets, then, wereonly seen with other Muppets, and the scenes filmed on Sesame Street itselfinvolved only real adults and children. What Palmer found out in Philadelphia,though, was that as soon as they switched to the street scenes, the kids lostall interest. “The street was supposed to be the glue,” Lesser said. “We wouldalways come back to the street. It pulled the show together. But it was justadults doing things and talking about stuff and the kids weren’t interested. Wewere getting incredibly low attention levels. The kids were leaving the show.Levels would pop back up if the Muppets came back, but we couldn’t afford tokeep losing them like that.” Lesser calls Palmer’s results a “turning point inthe history of Sesame Street. We knew that if we kept the street that way, theshow was going to die. Everything was happening so fast. We had the testing inthe summer, and we were going on the air in the fall. We had to figure out whatto do.”Lesser decided to defy the opinion of his scientific advisers. “We decided towrite a letter to all the other developmental psychologists and say, we know howyou guys think about mixing fantasy and reality. But we’re going to do itanyway. If we don’t, we’ll be dead in the water.” So the producers went back andreshot all of the street scenes. Henson and his coworkers created puppets whocould walk and talk with the adults of the show and could live alongside them onthe street. “That’s when Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch and Snuffleupagus wereborn,” said Palmer. What we now think of as the essence of Sesame Street—theartful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults—grew out of a desperatedesire to be sticky.The Distracter, however, for all its strengths, is a fairly crude instrument. Ittells you that a child understands what is happening on the screen and as aresult is paying attention. But it doesn’t tell you what the child understandsor, more precisely, it doesn’t tell you whether the child is paying attention towhat he or she ought to be paying attention to.Consider the following two Sesame Street segments, both of which are calledvisual blending exercises—segments that teach children that reading consists ofblending together distinct sounds. In one, “Hug,” a female Muppet, approachesthe word HUG in the center of the screen. She stands behind the H, sounding itout carefully, then moves to the U, and then the G. She does it again, movingfrom left to right, pronouncing each letter separately, before putting thesounds together to say “hug.” As she does, the Muppet Herry Monster enters andrepeats the word as well. The segment ends with the Herry Monster hugging thedelighted little girl Muppet.In another segment, called “Oscar’s Blending,” Oscar the Grouch and the MuppetCrummy play a game called “Breakable Words,” in which words are assembled andthen taken apart. Oscar starts by calling for C, which pops up on the lower leftcorner of the screen. The letter C, Oscar tells Crummy, is pronounced “cuh.”Then the letters at pop up in the lower right hand corner and Crummy sounds theletters out—“at.” The two go back and forth—Oscar saying “cuh” and Crummy“at”—each time faster and faster, until the sounds blend together to make cat.As this happens, the letters at the bottom of the screen move together as wellto make “cat.” The two Muppets repeat “cat” a few times and then the word dropsfrom sight, accompanied by a crashing sound. Then the process begins again withthe word bat.Both of these segments are entertaining. They hold children’s attention. On theDistracter, they score brilliantly. But do they actually teach the fundamentalsof reading? That’s a much harder question. To answer it, the producers of SesameStreet in the mid 1970s called in a group of researchers at Harvard Universityled by a psychologist named Barbara Flagg who were expert in something calledeye movement photography. Eye movement research is based on the idea that thehuman eye is capable of focusing on only a very small area at one time—what iscalled a perceptual span. When we read, we are capable of taking in only aboutone key word and then four characters to the left and fifteen characters to theright at any one time. We jump from one of these chunks to another, pausing—orfixating—on them long enough to make sense of each letter. The reason we canfocus clearly on only that much text is that most of the sensors in our eyes—thereceptors that process what we see—are clustered in a small region in the verymiddle of the retina called the fovea. That’s why we move our eyes when we read:we can’t pick up much information about the shape, or the color, or thestructure of words unless we focus our fovea directly on them. Just try, forexample, to reread this paragraph by staring straight ahead at the center of thepage. It’s impossible.If you can track where someone’s fovea is moving and what they are fixating on,in other words, you can tell with extraordinary precision what they are actuallylooking at and what kind of information they are actually receiving. The peoplewho make television commercials, not surprisingly, are obsessed with eyetracking. If you make a beer commercial with a beautiful model, it would bereally important to know whether the average twenty two year old male in yourtarget audience fixates only on the model or eventually moves to your can ofbeer. Sesame Street went to Harvard in 1975 for the same reason. When kidswatched “Oscar’s Blending” or “Hug,” were they watching and learning about thewords, or were they simply watching the Muppets?The experiment was conducted with twenty one four and five year olds, who werebrought to the Harvard School of Education over the course of a week by theirparents. One by one they were seated in an antique barber’s chair with a paddedheadrest about three feet away from a 17 inch color television monitor. A Gulf &Western infrared Eye View Monitor was set up just off to the left, carefullycalibrated to track the fovea movements of each subject. What they found wasthat “Hug” was a resounding success. Seventy six percent of all fixations wereon the letters. Better still, 83 percent of all preschoolers fixated on theletters in a left to right sequence—mimicking, in other words, the actualreading process. “Oscar’s Blending,” on the other hand, was a disaster. Only 35percent of total fixations fell on the letters. And exactly zero percent of thepreschoolers read the letters from left to right. What was the problem? First,the letter shouldn’t have been on the bottom of the screen because, as almostall eye movement research demonstrates, when it comes to television people tendto fixate on the center of the screen. That issue, though, is really secondaryto the simple fact that the kids weren’t watching the letters because they werewatching Oscar. They were watching the model and not the beer can. “I remember‘Oscar’s Blending,’” Flagg says. “Oscar was very active. He was really making afuss in the background, and the word is not close to him at all. He’s moving hismouth a lot, moving his hands. He has things in his hands. There is a great dealof distraction. The kids don’t focus on the letters at all because Oscar is sointeresting.” Oscar was sticky. The lesson wasn’t.3.This was the legacy of Sesame Street: If you paid careful attention to thestructure and format of your material, you could dramatically enhancestickiness. But is it possible to make a show even stickier than Sesame Street?This was what three young television producers at the Nickelodeon Network inManhattan asked themselves in the mid 1990s. It was a reasonable question.Sesame Street, after all, was a product of the 1960s, and in the interveningthree decades major strides had been made in understanding how children’s mindswork. One of the Nickelodeon producers, Todd Kessler, had actually worked onSesame Street and left the show dissatisfied. He didn’t like the fast paced“magazine” format of the show. “I love Sesame Street,” he says. “But I alwaysbelieved that kids didn’t have short attention spans, that they could easily sitstill for a half an hour.” He found traditional children’s television toostatic. “Because the audience is not all that verbal or even preverbal, it isimportant to tell the story visually,” he went on. “It’s a visual medium, and tomake it sink in, to make it powerful, you’ve got to make use of that. There isso much children’s television that is all talk. The audience has a hard timekeeping up with that.” Kessler’s colleague, Angela Santomero, grew up on SesameStreet and had similar misgivings. “We wanted to learn from Sesame Street andtake it one step further,” Santomero said. “TV is a great medium for education.But people up until now haven’t explored the potential of it. They’ve been usingit in a rote way. I believed we could turn that around.”What they came up with is a show called Blue’s Clues. It is half an hour, not anhour. It doesn’t have an ensemble cast. It has just one live actor, Steve, afresh faced man in his early twenties in khakis and a rugby shirt who acts asthe show’s host. Instead of a varied, magazine format, each episode follows asingle story line—the exploits of an animated dog by the name of Blue. It has aflat, two dimensional feel, more like a video version of a picture book than atelevision show. The pace is deliberate. The script is punctuated withexcruciatingly long pauses. There is none of the humor or wordplay or clevernessthat characterizes Sesame Street. One of the animated characters on the show, amailbox, is called Mailbox. Two other regular characters, a shovel and a pail,are called Shovel and Pail. And Blue, of course, the show’s star, is Bluebecause she’s the color blue. It is difficult, as an adult, to watch Blue’sClues and not wonder how this show could ever represent an improvement overSesame Street. And yet it does. Within months of its debut in 1996, Blue’s Clueswas trouncing Sesame Street in the ratings. On the Distracter test, it scoreshigher than its rival in capturing children’s attention. Jennings Bryant, aneducational researcher at the University of Alabama, conducted a study of 120children, comparing the performance of regular Blue’s Clues watchers to watchersof other educational shows on a series of cognitive tests.“After six months we began to get very big differences,” Bryant said. “By almostall of our measures of flexible thinking and problem solving, we hadstatistically significant differences. If there were sixty items on the test,you might find that the Blue’s Clues watchers were correctly identifying fiftyof them, and the control group was identifying thirty five.” Blue’s Clues may beone of the stickiest television shows ever made.How is it that such an unprepossessing show is even stickier than Sesame Street?The answer is that Sesame Street, as good as it is, has a number of subtle butnot insignificant limitations. Consider, for example, the problem created by theshow’s insistence on being clever. From the beginning Sesame Street was intendedto appeal to both children and adults. The idea was that one of the bigobstacles facing children—particularly children from lower income families—wasthat their parents didn’t encourage or participate in their education. SesameStreet’s creators wanted a show that mothers would watch along with theirchildren. That’s why the show is loaded with so many “adult” elements, theconstant punning and pop culture references like Monsterpiece Theater or theSamuel Beckett parody “Waiting for Elmo.” (The show’s head writer, Lou Berger,says that the reason he applied for a job at Sesame Street was because of aKermit sketch he saw while watching the show with his son in 1979. “It was oneof those crazy fairy tales. They were looking for a princess in distress. Kermitran out to this female Muppet princess and said”—and here Berger did a pitchperfect Kermit—“‘Excuse me, are you a female princess in distress?’ And shesaid, ‘What does this look like? A pant suit?’ I remember thinking, ‘That’s sogreat. I have to work there.’”)The problem is, preschoolers don’t get these kinds of jokes, and the presence ofthe humor—like the elaborate pun on “distress”—can serve as a distraction. Thereis a good example of this in an episode of Sesame Street called “Roy” that ranon Christmas Eve in 1997. The episode opens with Big Bird running into a mailcarrier, who has never been on Sesame Street before. The mail carrier hands BigBird a package, and Big Bird is immediately puzzled: “If this is the first timeyou have ever been here,” he asks, “how did you know I was Big Bird?”MAIL CARRIER: Well, you have to admit, it’s easy to figure out! [Gesturesbroadly at Big Bird]BB: It is? [Looks at himself]. Oh, I see. The package is for Big Bird, and I’m abig bird. I forget sometimes. I’m just what my name says. Big Bird is a bigbird.Big Bird becomes sad. He realizes that everyone else has a name—like Oscar, orSnuffy—but he has only a description. He asks the mail carrier what her name is.She says Imogene.BB: Gee, that’s a nice name. [Looking to the camera, wistfully] I wish I had areal name like that, instead of one that just says what I am, as if I were anapple or a chair or something.”Thereupon begins a search by Big Bird for a new name. With the help of Snuffy,he canvases Sesame Street for suggestions—Zackledackle, Butch, Bill, Omar,Larry, Sammy, Ebenezer, Jim, Napoleon, Lancelot, Rocky—before settling on Roy.But then, once everyone starts calling him by his new name, Big Bird realizesthat he doesn’t like it after all. “Somehow it doesn’t seem right,” he says. “Ithink I made a big mistake.” He switches back. “Even if Big Bird isn’t a regularname,” he concludes, “it’s my name, and I like the way all my friends say it.”This was, at least on the surface, an excellent episode. The premise ischallenging and conceptual, but fascinating. It deals candidly with emotion,and, unlike other children’s shows, tells children that it’s okay not to behappy all of the time. Most of all, it’s funny.It sounds like it should be a winner, right?Wrong. The Roy show was tested by the Sesame Street research staff and thenumbers were very disappointing. The first segment involving Snuffy and Big Birddid well. As you would expect, the viewers were curious. Then things began tofall apart. By the second of the street scenes, attention dropped to 80 percent.By the third, 78 percent. By the fourth 40 percent, then 50, then 20. Afterviewing the show, the kids were quizzed on what they had seen. “We asked veryspecific questions and were looking for clear answers,” Rosemary Truglio, SesameStreet’s research head said. “What was the show about? Sixty percent knew. Whatdid Big Bird want to do? Fifty three percent knew. What was Big Bird’s new name?Twenty percent knew. How did Big Bird feel at the end? Fifty percent knew.” Bycomparison, another of the shows tested by Sesame Street at the very same timerecorded 90 percent plus correct answers on the postshow quiz. The show simplywasn’t making any impression. It wasn’t sticking.Why did the show fail? The problem, at root, is with the premise of the show—theessential joke that Big Bird doesn’t want to be known as a big bird. That’s thekind of wordplay that a preschooler simply doesn’t understand. Preschoolers makea number of assumptions about words and their meaning as they acquire language,one of the most important of which is what the psychologist Ellen Markman callsthe principle of mutual exclusivity. Simply put, this means that small childrenhave difficulty believing that any one object can have two different names. Thenatural assumption of children, Markman argues, is that if an object or personis given a second label, then that label must refer to some secondary propertyor attribute of that object. You can see how useful this assumption is to achild faced with the extraordinary task of assigning a word to everything in theworld. A child who learns the word elephant knows, with absolute certainty, thatit is something different from a dog. Each new word makes the child’s knowledgeof the world more precise. Without mutual exclusivity, by contrast, if a childthought that elephant could simply be another label for dog, then each new wordwould make the world seem more complicated. Mutual exclusivity also helps thechild think clearly. “Suppose,” Markman writes, “a child who already knows‘apple’ and ‘red’ hears someone refer to an apple as ‘round.’ By mutualexclusivity, the child can eliminate the object (apple) and its color (red) asthe meaning of ‘round’ and can try to analyze the object for some other propertyto label.”What this means, though, is that children are going to have trouble with objectsthat have two names, or objects that change names. A child has difficulty with,say, the idea that an oak is both an oak and a tree; he or she may well assumethat in that case “tree” is a word for a collection of oaks.The idea, then, that Big Bird no longer wants to be called Big Bird but insteadwants to be called Roy is almost guaranteed to befuddle a preschooler. How cansomeone with one name decide to have another name? Big Bird is saying that BigBird is merely a descriptive name of the type of animal he is, and that he wantsa particular name. He doesn’t want to be a tree. He wants to be an oak. Butthree and four year olds don’t understand that a tree can also be an oak. To theextent that they understand what is going on at all, they probably think thatBig Bird is trying to change into something else—into some other kind of animal,or some other collection of animals. And how could he do that?There’s a deeper problem. Sesame Street is a magazine show. A typical showconsists of at least forty distinct segments, none more than about threeminutes—street scenes with the actors and Muppets, animation, and short filmsfrom outside the studio. With shows like “Roy,” in the late 1990s, the writersof the show attempted, for the first time, to link some of these pieces togetherwith a common theme. For most of the show’s history, though, the segments wereentirely autonomous; in fact new Sesame shows were constructed, for the mostpart, by mixing together fresh street scenes with animated bits and filmedsequences from the show’s archives.The show’s creators had a reason for wanting to construct Sesame Street thisway. They thought preschoolers did not have the attention span to handleanything other than very short, tightly focused segments. “We looked at theviewing patterns of young children, and we found that they were watching LaughIn,” says Lloyd Morrisett, who was one of the show’s founders. “That had a verystrong effect on the early Sesame Street. Zany, relatively quick one liners. Thekids seemed to love it.” Sesame Street’ s creators were impressed even more bythe power of television commercials. The sixties were the golden age of MadisonAvenue, and at the time it seemed to make perfect sense that if a 60 secondtelevision spot could sell breakfast cereal to a four year old, then it couldalso sell that child the alphabet. Part of the appeal of Jim Henson and theMuppets to the show’s creators, in fact, was that in the 1960s Henson had beenrunning a highly successful advertising shop. Many of the most famous Muppetswere created for ad campaigns: Big Bird is really a variation of a seven footdragon created by Henson for La Choy commercials; Cookie Monster was a pitchmanfor Frito Lay; Grover was used in promotional films for IBM. (Henson’s Muppetcommercials from the 50s and 60s are hysterically funny but have a dark and edgyquality that understandably was absent from his Sesame Street work.)“I think the most significant format feature in a commercial is that it’s aboutone thing,” said Sam Gibbon, one of the earliest Sesame Street producers. “It’sabout selling one idea. The notion of breaking down the production of SesameStreet into units small enough so they could address a single educational goallike an individual letter owed a lot to that technique of commercials.”But is the commercial theory of learning true? Daniel Anderson says that newresearch suggests that children actually don’t like commercials as much as wethought they did because commercials “don’t tell stories, and stories have aparticular salience and importance to young people.” The original Sesame Streetwas anti narrative: it was, by design, an unconnected collection of sketches.“It wasn’t just the ads that influenced the early Sesame Street,” Anderson says.“There was also a theoretical perspective at the time, based in part on [theinfluential child psychologist] Piaget, that a preschool child couldn’t followan extended narrative.” Since the late 1960s, however, this idea has been turnedon its head. At three and four and five, children may not be able to followcomplicated plots and subplots. But the narrative form, psychologists nowbelieve, is absolutely central to them. “It’s the only way they have oforganizing the world, of organizing experience,” Jerome Bruner, a psychologistat New York University, says. “They are not able to bring theories that organizethings in terms of cause and effect and relationships, so they turn things intostories, and when they try to make sense of their life they use the storiedversion of their experience as the basis for further reflection. If they don’tcatch something in a narrative structure, it doesn’t get remembered very well,and it doesn’t seem to be accessible for further kinds of mulling over.”Bruner was involved, in the early 1980s, in a fascinating project—called“Narratives from the Crib”—that was critical in changing the views of many childexperts. The project centered on a two year old girl from New Haven calledEmily, whose parents—both university professors—began to notice that beforetheir daughter went to sleep at night she talked to herself. Curious, they put asmall microcassette recorder in her crib and, several nights a week, for thenext fifteen months, recorded both the conversations they had with Emily as theyput her to bed and the conversations she had with herself before she fellasleep. The transcripts—122 in all—were then analyzed by a group of linguistsand psychologists led by Katherine Nelson of Harvard University. What they foundwas that Emily’s conversations with herself were more advanced than herconversations with her parents. In fact, they were significantly more advanced.One member of the team that met to discuss the Emily tapes, Carol FleisherFeldman, later wrote:In general, her speech to herself is so much richer and more complex [than herspeech to adults] that it has made all of us, as students of languagedevelopment, begin to wonder whether the picture of language acquisition offeredin the literature to date does not underrepresent the actual patterns of thelinguistic knowledge of the young child. For once the lights are out and herparents leave the room, Emily reveals a stunning mastery of language forms wewould never have suspected from her [everyday] speech.Feldman was referring to things like vocabulary and grammar and—mostimportant—the structure of Emily’s monologues. She was making up stories,narratives, that explained and organized the things that happened to her.Sometimes these stories were what linguists call temporal narratives. She wouldcreate a story to try to integrate events, actions, and feelings into onestructure—a process that is a critical part of a child’s mental development.Here is a story Emily told herself at 32 months, which I will quote at length toemphasize just how sophisticated children’s speech is when they are bythemselves:Tomorrow when we wake up from bed, first me and Daddy and Mommy, you, eatbreakfast eat breakfast like we usually do, and then we’re going to play andthen soon as Daddy comes, Carl’s going to come over, and then we’re going toplay a little while. And then Carl and Emily are both going down the car withsomebody, and we’re going to ride to nursery school [whispered], and then whenwe get there, we’re all going to get out of the car, go into nursery school, andDaddy’s going to give us kisses, then go, and then say, and then we will saygoodbye, then he’s going to work and we’re going to play at nursery school.Won’t that be funny? Because sometimes I go to nursery school cause it’s anursery school day. Sometimes I stay with Tanta all week. And sometimes we playmom and dad. But usually, sometimes, I, um, oh go to nursery school. But todayI’m going to nursery school in the morning. In the morning, Daddy in the, whenand usual, we’re going to eat breakfast like we usually do, and then we’re goingto...and then we’re going to...play. And then we’re, then the doorbell’s goingto ring, and here comes Carl in here, and then Carl, and then we are all goingto play, and then...Emily is describing her Friday routine. But it’s not a particular Friday. It’swhat she considers an ideal Friday, a hypothetical Friday in which everythingshe wants to happen happens. It is, as Bruner and Joan Lucariello write in theircommentary on the segment,a remarkable act of world making...she uses tonal emphasis, prolongation of keywords, and a kind of “re enactment” reminiscent of the we are there cinemaverité (with her friend Carl practically narrated through the door as heenters). As if to emphasize that she has everything “down pat” she delivers themonologue in a rhythmic, almost singsong way. And in the course of thesoliloquy, she even feels free to comment on the drollness of the course thatevents are taking (“Won’t that be funny”).It is hard to look at this evidence of the importance of narrative and notmarvel at the success of Sesame Street. Here was a show that eschewed what turnsout to be the most important of all ways of reaching young children. It alsodiluted its appeal to preschoolers with jokes aimed only at adults. Yet itsucceeded anyway. That was the genius of Sesame Street, that through thebrilliance of its writing and the warmth and charisma of the Muppets it managedto overcome what might otherwise have been overwhelming obstacles. But itbecomes easy to understand how you would make a children’s show even stickierthan Sesame Street. You’d make it perfectly literal, without any wordplay orcomedy that would confuse preschoolers. And you’d teach kids how to think in thesame way that kids teach themselves how to think—in the form of the story. Youwould make, in other words, Blue’s Clues.4.Every episode of Blue’s Clues is constructed the same way. Steve, the host,presents the audience with a puzzle involving Blue, the animated dog. In oneshow the challenge is to figure out Blue’s favorite story. In another, it is tofigure out Blue’s favorite food. To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blueleaves behind a series of clues, which are objects tattooed with one of her pawprints. In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series ofgames—mini puzzles—with the audience that are thematically related to theoverall puzzle. In the show about Blue’s favorite story, for example, one of themini puzzles involves Steve and Blue sitting down with the Three Bears, whosebowls of porridge have been mixed up, and enlisting the audience’s help inmatching the small, middle, and large bowls with Mama, Papa, and Baby Bear. Asthe show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, from aliving room to a garden to fantastical places, jumping through magical doorways,leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, at the end of the story, Stevereturns to the living room. There, at the climax of every show, he sits down ina comfortable chair to think—a chair known, of course, in the literal world ofBlue’s Clues, as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue’s three clues andattempts to come up with the answer.This much is, obviously, a radical departure from Sesame Street. But havingturned their back on that part of the Sesame Street legacy, the creators ofBlue’s Clues then went back and borrowed those parts of Sesame Street that theythought did work. In fact, they did more than borrow. They took those stickyelements and tried to make them even stickier. The first was the idea that themore kids are engaged in watching something—intellectually and physically—themore memorable and meaningful it becomes. “I’d noticed that some segments onSesame Street elicited a lot of interaction from kids, where the segments askedfor it,” says Daniel Anderson, who worked with Nickelodeon in designing Blue’sClues. “Something that stuck in my mind was when Kermit would hold his finger tothe screen and draw an animated letter, you’d see kids holding their fingers upand drawing a letter along with him. Or occasionally, when a Sesame Streetcharacter would ask a question, you’d hear kids answer out loud. But SesameStreet just somehow never took that idea and ran with it. They knew that kidsdid this some of the time, but they never tried to build a show around thatidea. Nickelodeon did some pilot shows before Blue’s Clues where kids would beexplicitly asked to participate, and lo and behold, there was a lot of evidencethat they would. So putting these ideas together, that kids are interested inbeing intellectually active when they watch TV, and given the opportunitythey’ll be behaviorally active, that created the philosophy for Blue’s Clues.”Steve, as a result, spends almost all his time on screen talking directly at thecamera. When he enlists the audience’s help, he actually enlists the audience’shelp. Often, there are close ups of his face, so it is as if he is almost in theroom with his audience. Whenever he asks a question, he pauses. But it’s not anormal pause. It’s a preschooler’s pause, several beats longer than any adultwould ever wait for an answer. Eventually an unseen studio audience yells out aresponse. But the child at home is given the opportunity to shout out an answerof his own. Sometimes Steve will play dumb. He won’t be able to find a certainclue that might be obvious to the audience at home and he’ll look beseechinglyat the camera. The idea is the same: to get the children watching to verballyparticipate, to become actively involved. If you watch Blue’s Clues with a groupof children, the success of this strategy is obvious. It’s as if they’re a groupof diehard Yankees fans at a baseball game.The second thing that Blue’s Clues took from Sesame Street was the idea ofrepetition. This was something that had fascinated the CTW pioneers. In the fivepilot shows that Palmer and Lesser took to Philadelphia in 1969, there was a oneminute bit called Wanda the Witch that used the w sound over and over: Wanda theWitch wore a wig in the windy winter in Washington, etc., etc. “We didn’t knowhow much we could repeat elements,” Lesser says. “We put it in three times onthe Monday, three times on the Tuesday, three times on the Wednesday, left itout on Thursday, then put it in right at the end of the Friday show. Some of thekids toward the end of the day Wednesday were saying, not Wanda the Witch again.When Wanda the Witch came back Friday, they jumped and clapped. Kids reach asaturation point. But then nostalgia sets in.”Not long afterward (and quite by accident), the Sesame Street writers figuredout why kids like repetition so much. The segment in question this time featuredthe actor James Earl Jones reciting the alphabet. As originally taped, Jonestook long pauses between letters, because the idea was to insert other elementsbetween the letters. But Jones, as you can imagine, cut such a compelling figurethat the Sesame Street producers left the film as it was and played it over andover again for years: the letter A or B, etc., would appear on the screen, therewould be a long pause, and then Jones would boom out the name and the letterwould disappear. “What we noticed was that the first time through, kids wouldshout out the name of the letter after Jones did,” Sam Gibbon says. “After acouple of repetitions, they would respond to the appearance of the letter beforehe did, in the long pause. Then, with enough repetitions, they would anticipatethe letter before it appeared. They were sequencing themselves through thepiece; first they learned the name of the letter, then they learned to associatethe name of the letter with its appearance, then they learned the sequence ofletters.” An adult considers constant repetition boring, because it requiresreliving the same experience over and again. But to preschoolers repetitionisn’t boring, because each time they watch something they are experiencing it ina completely different way. At CTW, the idea of learning through repetition wascalled the James Earl Jones effect.Blue’s Clues is essentially a show built around the James Earl Jones effect.Instead of running new episodes one after another, and then repeating them asreruns later in the seasons—like every other television show—Nickelodeon runsthe same Blue’s Clues episode for five straight days, Monday through Friday,before going on to the next one. As you can imagine, this wasn’t an idea thatcame easily to Nickelodeon. Santomero and Anderson had to convince them. (Italso helped that Nickelodeon didn’t have the money to produce a full season ofBlue’s Clues shows.) “I had the pilot in my house, and at the time my daughterwas three and a half and she kept watching it over and over again,” Andersonsays. “I kept track. She watched it fourteen times without any lagging ofenthusiasm.” When the pilot was taken out into the field for testing, the samething happened. They showed it five days in a row to a large group ofpreschoolers, and attention and comprehension actually increased over the courseof the week—with the exception of the oldest children, the five year olds, whoseattention fell off at the very end. Like the kids watching James Earl Jones, thechildren responded to the show in a different way with each repeat viewing,becoming more animated and answering more of Steve’s questions earlier andearlier. “If you think about the world of a preschooler, they are surrounded bystuff they don’t understand—things that are novel. So the driving force for apreschooler is not a search for novelty, like it is with older kids, it’s asearch for understanding and predictability,” says Anderson. “For younger kids,repetition is really valuable. They demand it. When they see a show over andover again, they not only are understanding it better, which is a form of power,but just by predicting what is going to happen, I think they feel a real senseof affirmation and self worth. And Blue’s Clues doubles that feeling, becausethey also feel like they are participating in something. They feel like they arehelping Steve.”Of course, kids don’t always like repetition. Whatever they are watching has tobe complex enough to allow, upon repeated exposure, for deeper and deeper levelsof comprehension. At the same time, it can’t be so complex that the first timearound it baffles the children and turns them off. In order to strike thisbalance, Blue’s Clues engages in much of the same kind of research as SesameStreet—but at a far more intense level. Where Sesame Street tests a given showonly once—and after it’s completed—Blue’s Clues tests shows three times beforethey go on the air. And while Sesame Street will typically only test a third ofits episodes, Blue’s Clues tests them all.I accompanied the Blue’s Clues research team on one of their weekly excursionsto talk to preschoolers. They were led by Alice Wilder, director of research forthe show, a lively dark haired woman who had just finished her doctorate ineducation at Columbia University. With her were two others, both women in theirearly twenties—Alison Gilman and Allison Sherman. On the morning that I joinedthem they were testing a proposed script at a preschool in Greenwich Village.The script being tested was about animal behavior. It was, essentially, a firstdraft, laid out in a picture book that roughly corresponded to the way theactual episode would unfold, scene by scene, on television. The Blue’s Cluestester played the part of Steve, and walked the kids through the script, makinga careful note of all the questions they answered correctly and those thatseemed to baffle them. At one point, for example, Sherman sat down with atowheaded five year old named Walker and a four and a half year old named Annain a purple and white checked skirt. She began reading from the script. Blue hada favorite animal. Would they help us find out what it was? The kids werewatching her closely. She began going through some of the subsidiary puzzles,one by one. She showed them a picture of an anteater.“What does an anteater eat?” she asked.Walker said, “Ants.”Sherman turned the page to a picture of an elephant. She pointed at its trunk.“What’s that?”Walker peered in. “A trunk.”She pointed at the tusks. “Do you know what the white things are?”Walker looked again. “Nostrils.”She showed them a picture of a bear, then came the first Blue’s clue, a littlesplotch of white and black tattooed with one of Blue’s paw prints.“That’s black and white,” Anna said.Sherman looked at the two of them. “What animal could Blue want to learn about?”She paused. Anna and Walker looked puzzled. Finally Walker broke the silence:“We had better go to the next clue.”The second round of puzzles was a little harder. There was a picture of a bird.The kids were asked what the bird was doing—the answer was singing—and then whyit was doing that. They talked about beavers and worms and then came to thesecond Blue’s clue—an iceberg. Anna and Walker were still stumped. On they wentto the third round, a long discussion of fish. Sherman showed them a picture ofa little fish lying camouflaged at the bottom of the sea, eying a big fish.“Why is the fish hiding?” Sherman asked.WALKER: “Because of the giant fish.”ANNA: “Because he will eat him.”They came to the third Blue’s clue. It was a cardboard cutout of one of Blue’spaw prints. Sherman took the paw print and moved it toward Walker and Anna,wiggling it as she did.“What’s this doing?” she asked.Walker screwed up his face in concentration. “It’s walking like a human,” hesaid.“Is it wriggling like a human?” Sherman asked.“It’s waddling,” Anna said.Sherman went over the clues in order: black and white, ice, waddling.There was a pause. Suddenly Walker’s face lit up. “It’s a penguin!” He wasshouting with the joy of discovery. “A penguin’s black and white. It lives onthe ice and it waddles!”Blue’s Clues succeeds as a story of discovery only if the clues are in properorder. The show has to start out easy—to give the viewers confidence—and thenget progressively harder and harder, challenging the preschoolers more and more,drawing them into the narrative. The first set of puzzles about anteaters andelephants had to be easier than the set of puzzles about beavers and worms,which in turn had to be easier than the final set about fish. The layering ofthe show is what makes it possible for a child to watch the show four and fivetimes: on each successive watching they master more and more, guessing correctlydeeper into the program, until, by the end, they can anticipate every answer.After the morning of testing, the Blue’s Clues team sat down and went throughthe results of the puzzles, one by one. Thirteen out of the 26 children guessedcorrectly that anteaters ate ants, which wasn’t a good response rate for thefirst clue. “We like to open strong,” Wilder said. They continued on, rustlingthrough their papers. The results of a puzzle about beavers drew a frown fromWilder. When shown a picture of a beaver dam, the kids did badly on answeringthe first question—what is the beaver doing?—but very well (19 out of 26) on thesecond question, why is he doing it? “The layers are switched,” Wilder said. Shewanted the easier question first. On to the fish questions: Why was the littlefish hiding from the big fish? Sherman looked up from her notes. “I had a greatanswer. ‘The little fish didn’t want to scare the big fish.’ That’s why he washiding.” They all laughed.Finally, came the most important question. Was the order of Blue’s cluescorrect? Wilder and Gilman had presented the clues in the order that the scripthad stipulated: ice, waddle, then black and white. Four of the 17 kids theytalked to guessed penguin after the first clue, six more guessed it after thesecond clue and four after all three clues. Wilder then turned to Sherman, whohad given her clues in a different order: black and white, ice, waddle.“I had no correct answers out of nine kids after one clue,” she reported. “Afterice, I was one of nine, and after waddle I was six of nine.”“Your clincher clue was waddle? That seems to work,” Wilder responded. “Butalong the way were they guessing lots of different things?”“Oh yes,” Sherman said. “After one clue, I had guesses of dogs, cows, pandabears, and tigers. After ice, I got polar bears and cougars.”Wilder nodded. Sherman’s clue order got the kids thinking as broadly as possibleearly in the show, but still preserved the suspense of penguin until the end.The clue order they had—the clue order that seemed the best back when they werewriting the script—gave the answer away far too soon. Sherman’s clue order hadsuspense. The original order did not. They had spent a morning with a group ofkids and come away with just what they wanted. It was only a small change. But asmall change is often all that it takes.There is something profoundly counterintuitive in the definition of stickinessthat emerges from all these examples. Wunderman stayed away from prime timeslots for his commercials and bought fringe time, which goes against everyprinciple of advertising. He eschewed slick “creative” messages for a seeminglycheesy “Gold Box” treasure hunt. Levanthal found that the hard sell—that tryingto scare students into getting tetanus shots—didn’t work, and what really workedwas giving them a map they didn’t need directing them to a clinic that theyalready knew existed. Blue’s Clues got rid of the cleverness and originalitythat made Sesame Street the most beloved television program of its generation,created a plodding, literal show, and repeated each episode five times in a row.We all want to believe that the key to making an impact on someone lies with theinherent quality of the ideas we present. But in none of these cases did anyonesubstantially alter the content of what they were saying. Instead, they tippedthe message by tinkering, on the margin, with the presentation of their ideas,by putting the Muppet behind the H U G, by mixing Big Bird with the adults, byrepeating episodes and skits more than once, by having Steve pause just a secondlonger than normal after he asks a question, by putting a tiny gold box in thecorner of the ad. The line between hostility and acceptance, in other words,between an epidemic that tips and one that does not, is sometimes a lot narrowerthan it seems. The creators of Sesame Street did not junk their entire showafter the Philadelphia disaster. They just added Big Bird, and he made all thedifference in the world. Howard Levanthal didn’t redouble his efforts to terrifyhis students into getting a tetanus shot. He just threw in a map and a set ofappointment times. The Law of the Few says that there are exceptional people outthere who are capable of starting epidemics. All you have to do is find them.The lesson of stickiness is the same. There is a simple way to packageinformation that, under the right circumstances, can make it irresistible. Allyou have to do is find it."},{"pageContent":"FOUR [TippingPoint_toc.html#chap_4]The Power of Context(Part One)BERNIE GOETZ ANDTHE RISE AND FALLOF NEW YORK CITY CRIMEOn December 22, 1984, the Saturday before Christmas, Bernhard Goetz left hisapartment in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village and walked to the IRT subway stationat Fourteenth Street and Seventh Avenue. He was a slender man in his latethirties, with sandy colored hair and glasses, dressed that day in jeans and awindbreaker. At the station, he boarded the number two downtown express trainand sat down next to four young black men. There were about twenty people in thecar, but most sat at the other end, avoiding the four teenagers, because theywere, as eyewitnesses would say later, “horsing around” and “acting rowdy.”Goetz seemed oblivious. “How are ya?” one of the four, Troy Canty, said toGoetz, as he walked in. Canty was lying almost prone on one of the subwaybenches. Canty and another of the teenagers, Barry Allen, walked up to Goetz andasked him for five dollars. A third youth, James Ramseur, gestured toward asuspicious looking bulge in his pocket, as if he had a gun in there.“What do you want?” Goetz asked.“Give me five dollars,” Canty repeated.Goetz looked up and, as he would say later, saw that Canty’s “eyes were shiny,and he was enjoying himself....He had a big smile on his face,” and somehow thatsmile and those eyes set him off. Goetz reached into his pocket and pulled out achrome plated five shot Smith and Wesson .38, firing at each of the four youthsin turn. As the fourth member of the group, Darrell Cabey, lay screaming on theground, Goetz walked over to him and said, “You seem all right. Here’s another,”before firing a fifth bullet into Cabey’s spinal cord and paralyzing him forlife.In the tumult, someone pulled the emergency brake. The other passengers ran intothe next car, except for two women who remained riveted in panic. “Are you allright?” Goetz asked the first, politely. Yes, she said. The second woman waslying on the floor. She wanted Goetz to think she was dead. “Are you all right?”Goetz asked her, twice. She nodded yes. The conductor, now on the scene, askedGoetz if he was a police officer.“No,” said Goetz. “I don’t know why I did it.” Pause. “They tried to rip meoff.”The conductor asked Goetz for his gun. Goetz declined. He walked through thedoorway at the front of the car, unhooked the safety chain, and jumped down ontothe tracks, disappearing into the dark of the tunnel.In the days that followed, the shooting on the IRT caused a national sensation.The four youths all turned out to have criminal records. Cabey had been arrestedpreviously for armed robbery, Canty for theft. Three of them had screwdrivers intheir pockets. They seemed the embodiment of the kind of young thug feared bynearly all urban dwellers, and the mysterious gunman who shot them down seemedlike an avenging angel. The tabloids dubbed Goetz the “Subway Vigilante” and the“Death Wish Shooter.” On radio call in shows and in the streets, he was treatedas a hero, a man who had fulfilled the secret fantasy of every New Yorker whohad ever been mugged or intimidated or assaulted on the subway. On New Year’sEve, a week after the shooting, Goetz turned himself in to a police station inNew Hampshire. Upon his extradition to New York City, the New York Post ran twopictures on its front page: one of Goetz, handcuffed and head bowed, being ledinto custody, and one of Troy Canty—black, defiant, eyes hooded, armsfolded—being released from the hospital. The headline read, “Led Away in CuffsWhile Wounded Mugger Walks to Freedom.” When the case came to trial, Goetz waseasily acquitted on charges of assault and attempted murder. Outside Goetz’sapartment building, on the evening of the verdict, there was a raucous,impromptu street party.1.The Goetz case has become a symbol of a particular, dark moment in New York Cityhistory, the moment when the city’s crime problem reached epidemic proportions.During the 1980s, New York City averaged well over 2,000 murders and 600,000serious felonies a year. Underground, on the subways, conditions could only bedescribed as chaotic. Before Bernie Goetz boarded the number two train that day,he would have waited on a dimly lit platform,surrounded on all sides by dark, damp, graffiti covered walls. Chances are histrain was late, because in 1984 there was a fire somewhere on the New Yorksystem every day and a derailment every other week. Pictures of the crime scene,taken by police, show that the car Goetz sat in was filthy, its floor litteredwith trash and the walls and ceiling thick with graffiti, but that wasn’tunusual because in 1984 every one of the 6,000 cars in the Transit Authorityfleet, with the exception of the midtown shuttle, was covered with graffiti—topto bottom, inside and out. In the winter, the cars were cold because few wereadequately heated. In the summer, the cars were stiflingly hot because none wereair conditioned. Today, the number two train accelerates to over 40 miles anhour as it rumbles toward the Chambers Street express stop. But it’s doubtfulGoetz’s train went that fast. In 1984, there were 500 “red tape” areas on thesystem—places where track damage had made it unsafe for trains to go more than15 miles per hour. Fare beating was so commonplace that it was costing theTransit Authority as much as $150 million in lost revenue annually. There wereabout 15,000 felonies on the system a year—a number that would hit 20,000 a yearby the end of the decade—and harassment of riders by panhandlers and pettycriminals was so pervasive that ridership of the trains had sunk to its lowestlevel in the history of the subway system. William Bratton, who was later to bea key figure in New York’s successful fight against violent crime, writes in hisautobiography of riding the New York subways in the 1980s after living in Bostonfor years, and being stunned at what he saw:After waiting in a seemingly endless line to buy a token, I tried to put a coininto a turnstile and found it had been purposely jammed. Unable to pay the fareto get into the system, we had to enter through a slam gate being held open by ascruffy looking character with his hand out; having disabled the turnstiles, hewas now demanding that riders give him their tokens. Meanwhile, one of hiscohorts had his mouth on the coin slots, sucking out the jammed coins andleaving his slobber. Most people were too intimidated to take these guys on:Here, take the damned token, what do I care? Other citizens were going over,under, around, or through the stiles for free. It was like going into thetransit version of Dante’s Inferno.This was New York City in the 1980s, a city in the grip of one of the worstcrime epidemics in its history. But then, suddenly and without warning, theepidemic tipped. From a high in 1990, the crime rate went into precipitousdecline. Murders dropped by two thirds. Felonies were cut in half. Other citiessaw their crime drop in the same period. But in no place did the level ofviolence fall farther or faster. On the subways, by the end of the decade, therewere 75 percent fewer felonies than there had been at the decade’s start. In1996, when Goetz went to trial a second time, as the defendant in a civil suitbrought by Darrell Cabey, the case was all but ignored by the press, and Goetzhimself seemed almost an anachronism. At a time when New York had become thesafest big city in the country, it seemed hard to remember precisely what it wasthat Goetz had once symbolized. It was simply inconceivable that someone couldpull a gun on someone else on the subway and be called a hero for it.2.This idea of crime as an epidemic, it must be said, is a little strange. We talkabout “epidemics of violence” or crime waves, but it’s not clear that we reallybelieve that crime follows the same rules of epidemics as, say, Hush Puppiesdid, or Paul Revere’s ride. Those epidemics involved relatively straightforwardand simple things—a product and a message. Crime, on the other hand, isn’t asingle discrete thing, but a word used to describe an almost impossibly variedand complicated set of behaviors. Criminal acts have serious consequences. Theyrequire the criminal to do something that puts himself at great personal peril.To say someone is a criminal is to say that he or she is evil or violent ordangerous or dishonest or unstable or any combination of any of thosethings—none of which is a psychological state that would seem to be transmitted,casually, from one person to another. Criminals do not, in other words, soundlike the kind of people who could be swept up by the infectious winds of anepidemic. Yet somehow, in New York City, this is exactly what occurred. In theyears between the beginning and the middle of the 1990s, New York City did notget a population transplant. Nobody went out into the streets and successfullytaught every would be delinquent the distinction between right and wrong. Therewere just as many psychologically damaged people, criminally inclined people,living in the city at the peak of the crime wave as in the trough. But for somereason tens of thousands of those people suddenly stopped committing crimes. In1984, an encounter between an angry subway rider and four young black youths ledto bloodshed. Today, in New York’s subways, that same encounter doesn’t lead toviolence anymore. How did that happen?The answer lies in the third of the principles of epidemic transmission, thePower of Context. The Law of the Few looked at the kinds of people who arecritical in spreading information. The chapter on Sesame Street and Blue’s Clueslooked at the question of Stickiness, suggesting that in order to be capable ofsparking epidemics, ideas have to be memorable and move us to action. We’velooked at the people who spread ideas, and we’ve looked at the characteristicsof successful ideas. But the subject of this chapter—the Power of Context—is noless important than the first two. Epidemics are sensitive to the conditions andcircumstances of the times and places in which they occur. In Baltimore,syphilis spreads far more in the summer than in the winter. Hush Puppies tookoff because they were being worn by kids in the cutting edge precincts of theEast Village—an environment that helped others to look at the shoes in a newlight. It could even be argued that the success of Paul Revere’s ride—in someway—owed itself to the fact that it was made at night. At night, people are homein bed, which makes them an awful lot easier to reach than if they are off onerrands or working in the fields. And if someone wakes us up to tell ussomething, we automatically assume the news is going to be urgent. One can onlyimagine how “Paul Revere’s afternoon ride” might have compared.This much, I think, is relatively straightforward. But the lesson of the Powerof Context is that we are more than just sensitive to changes in context. We’reexquisitely sensitive to them. And the kinds of contextual changes that arecapable of tipping an epidemic are very different than we might ordinarilysuspect.3.During the 1990s violent crime declined across the United States for a number offairly straightforward reasons. The illegal trade in crack cocaine, which hadspawned a great deal of violence among gangs and drug dealers, began to decline.The economy’s dramatic recovery meant that many people who might have been luredinto crime got legitimate jobs instead, and the general aging of the populationmeant that there were fewer people in the age range—males between eighteen andtwenty four—that is responsible for the majority of all violence. The questionof why crime declined in New York City, however, is a little more complicated.In the period when the New York epidemic tipped down, the city’s economy hadn’timproved. It was still stagnant. In fact, the city’s poorest neighborhoods hadjust been hit hard by the welfare cuts of the early 1990s. The waning of thecrack cocaine epidemic in New York was clearly a factor, but then again, it hadbeen in steady decline well before crime dipped. As for the aging of thepopulation, because of heavy immigration to New York in the 1980s, the city wasgetting younger in the 1990s, not older. In any case, all of these trends arelong term changes that one would expect to have gradual effects. In New York thedecline was anything but gradual. Something else clearly played a role inreversing New York’s crime epidemic.The most intriguing candidate for that “something else” is called the BrokenWindows theory. Broken Windows was the brainchild of the criminologists James Q.Wilson and George Kelling. Wilson and Kelling argued that crime is theinevitable result of disorder. If a window is broken and left unrepaired, peoplewalking by will conclude that no one cares and no one is in charge. Soon, morewindows will be broken, and the sense of anarchy will spread from the buildingto the street on which it faces, sending a signal that anything goes. In a city,relatively minor problems like graffiti, public disorder, and aggressivepanhandling, they write, are all the equivalent of broken windows, invitationsto more serious crimes:Muggers and robbers, whether opportunistic or professional, believe they reducetheir chances of being caught or even identified if they operate on streetswhere potential victims are already intimidated by prevailing conditions. If theneighborhood cannot keep a bothersome panhandler from annoying passersby, thethief may reason, it is even less likely to call the police to identify apotential mugger or to interfere if the mugging actually takes place.This is an epidemic theory of crime. It says that crime is contagious—just as afashion trend is contagious—that it can start with a broken window and spread toan entire community. The Tipping Point in this epidemic, though, isn’t aparticular kind of person—a Connector like Lois Weisberg or a Maven like MarkAlpert. It’s something physical like graffiti. The impetus to engage in acertain kind of behavior is not coming from a certain kind of person but from afeature of the environment.In the mid 1980s Kelling was hired by the New York Transit Authority as aconsultant, and he urged them to put the Broken Windows theory into practice.They obliged, bringing in a new subway director by the name of David Gunn tooversee a multibillion dollar rebuilding of the subway system. Many subwayadvocates, at the time, told Gunn not to worry about graffiti, to focus on thelarger questions of crime and subway reliability, and it seemed like reasonableadvice. Worrying about graffiti at a time when the entire system was close tocollapse seems as pointless as scrubbing the decks of the Titanic as it headedtoward the icebergs. But Gunn insisted. “The graffiti was symbolic of thecollapse of the system,” he says. “When you looked at the process of rebuildingthe organization and morale, you had to win the battle against graffiti. Withoutwinning that battle, all the management reforms and physical changes justweren’t going to happen. We were about to put out new trains that were worthabout ten million bucks apiece, and unless we did something to protect them, weknew just what would happen. They would last one day and then they would bevandalized.”Gunn drew up a new management structure and a precise set of goals andtimetables aimed at cleaning the system line by line, train by train. He startedwith the number seven train that connects Queens to midtown Manhattan, and beganexperimenting with new techniques to clean off the paint. On stainless steelcars, solvents were used. On the painted cars, the graffiti were simply paintedover. Gunn made it a rule that there should be no retreat, that once a car was“reclaimed” it should never be allowed to be vandalized again. “We werereligious about it,” Gunn said. At the end of the number one line in the Bronx,where the trains stop before turning around and going back to Manhattan, Gunnset up a cleaning station. If a car came in with graffiti, the graffiti had tobe removed during the changeover, or the car was removed from service. “Dirty”cars, which hadn’t yet been cleansed of graffiti, were never to be mixed with“clean” cars. The idea was to send an unambiguous message to the vandalsthemselves.“We had a yard up in Harlem on one hundred thirty fifth Street where the trainswould lay up over night,” Gunn said. “The kids would come the first night andpaint the side of the train white. Then they would come the next night, after itwas dry, and draw the outline. Then they would come the third night and color itin. It was a three day job. We knew the kids would be working on one of thedirty trains, and what we would do is wait for them to finish their mural. Thenwe’d walk over with rollers and paint it over. The kids would be in tears, butwe’d just be going up and down, up and down. It was a message to them. If youwant to spend three nights of your time vandalizing a train, fine. But it’snever going to see the light of day.”Gunn’s graffiti cleanup took from 1984 to 1990. At that point, the TransitAuthority hired William Bratton to head the transit police, and the second stageof the reclamation of the subway system began. Bratton was, like Gunn, adisciple of Broken Windows. He describes Kelling, in fact, as his intellectualmentor, and so his first step as police chief was as seemingly quixotic asGunn’s. With felonies—serious crimes—on the subway system at an all time high,Bratton decided to crack down on fare beating. Why? Because he believed that,like graffiti, fare beating could be a signal, a small expression of disorderthat invited much more serious crimes. An estimated 170,000 people a day wereentering the system, by one route or another, without paying a token. Some werekids, who simply jumped over the turnstiles. Others would lean backward on theturnstiles and force their way through. And once one or two or three peoplebegan cheating the system, other people—who might never otherwise haveconsidered evading the law—would join in, reasoning that if some people weren’tgoing to pay, they shouldn’t either, and the problem would snowball. The problemwas exacerbated by the fact fare beating was not easy to fight. Because therewas only $1.25 at stake, the transit police didn’t feel it was worth their timeto pursue it, particularly when there were plenty of more serious crimeshappening down on the platform and in the trains.Bratton is a colorful, charismatic man, a born leader, and he quickly made hispresence felt. His wife stayed behind in Boston, so he was free to work longhours, and he would roam the city on the subway at night, getting a sense ofwhat the problems were and how best to fight them. First, he picked stationswhere fare beating was the biggest problem, and put as many as ten policemen inplainclothes at the turnstiles. The team would nab fare beaters one by one,handcuff them, and leave them standing, in a daisy chain, on the platform untilthey had a “full catch.” The idea was to signal, as publicly as possible, thatthe transit police were now serious about cracking down on fare beaters.Previously, police officers had been wary of pursuing fare beaters because thearrest, the trip to the station house, the filling out of necessary forms, andthe waiting for those forms to be processed took an entire day—all for a crimethat usually merited no more than a slap on the wrist. Bratton retrofitted acity bus and turned it into a rolling station house, with its own fax machines,phones, holding pen, and fingerprinting facilities. Soon the turnaround time onan arrest was down to an hour. Bratton also insisted that a check be run on allthose arrested. Sure enough, one out of seven arrestees had an outstandingwarrant for a previous crime, and one out of twenty was carrying a weapon ofsome sort. Suddenly it wasn’t hard to convince police officers that tacklingfare beating made sense. “For the cops it was a bonanza,” Bratton writes. “Everyarrest was like opening a box of Cracker Jack. What kind of toy am I going toget? Got a gun? Got a knife? Got a warrant? Do we have a murderer here?...Aftera while the bad guys wised up and began to leave their weapons home and paytheir fares.” Under Bratton, the number of ejections from subway stations—fordrunkenness, or improper behavior—tripled within his first few months in office.Arrests for misdemeanors, for the kind of minor offenses that had gone unnoticedin the past, went up fivefold between 1990 and 1994. Bratton turned the transitpolice into an organization focused on the smallest infractions, on the detailsof life underground.After the election of Rudolph Giuliani as mayor of New York in 1994, Bratton wasappointed head of the New York City Police Department, and he applied the samestrategies to the city at large. He instructed his officers to crack down onquality of life crimes: on the “squeegee men” who came up to drivers at New YorkCity intersections and demanded money for washing car windows, for example, andon all the other above ground equivalents of turnstile jumping and graffiti.“Previous police administration had been handcuffed by restrictions,” Brattonsays. “We took the handcuffs off. We stepped up enforcement of the laws againstpublic drunkenness and public urination and arrested repeat violators, includingthose who threw empty bottles on the street or were involved in even relativelyminor damage to property....If you peed in the street, you were going to jail.”When crime began to fall in the city—as quickly and dramatically as it had inthe subways—Bratton and Giuliani pointed to the same cause. Minor, seeminglyinsignificant quality of life crimes, they said, were Tipping Points for violentcrime.Broken Windows theory and the Power of Context are one and the same. They areboth based on the premise that an epidemic can be reversed, can be tipped, bytinkering with the smallest details of the immediate environment. This is, ifyou think about it, quite a radical idea. Think back, for instance, to theencounter between Bernie Goetz and those four youths on the subway: Allen,Ramseur, Cabey, and Canty. At least two of them, according to some reports,appear to have been on drugs at the time of the incident. They all came from theClaremont Village housing project in one of the worst parts of the South Bronx.Cabey was, at the time, under indictment for armed robbery. Canty had a priorfelony arrest for possession of stolen property. Allen had been previouslyarrested for attempted assault. Allen, Canty, and Ramseur also all hadmisdemeanor convictions, ranging from criminal mischief to petty larceny. Twoyears after the Goetz shooting, Ramseur was sentenced to twenty five years inprison for rape, robbery, sodomy, sexual abuse, assault, criminal use of afirearm, and possession of stolen property. It’s hard to be surprised whenpeople like this wind up in the middle of a violent incident.Then there’s Goetz. He did something that is completely anomalous. Whiteprofessionals do not, as a rule, shoot young black men on the subway. But if youlook closely at who he was, he fits the stereotype of the kind of person whoends up in violent situations. His father was a strict disciplinarian with aharsh temper, and Goetz was often the focus of his father’s rage. At school, hewas the one teased by classmates, the last one picked for school games, a lonelychild who would often leave school in tears. He worked, after graduating fromcollege, for Westinghouse, building nuclear submarines. But he didn’t last long.He was constantly clashing with his superiors over what he saw as shoddypractices and corner cutting, and sometimes broke company and union rules bydoing work that he was contractually forbidden to do. He took an apartment onFourteenth Street in Manhattan, near Sixth Avenue, on a stretch of city blockthat was then heavy with homelessness and drug dealing. One of the doormen inthe building, with whom Goetz was close, was beaten badly by muggers. Goetzbecame obsessed with cleaning up the neighborhood. He complained endlessly abouta vacant newsstand near his building, which was used by vagrants as a trash binand stank of urine. One night, mysteriously, it burned down, and the next dayGoetz was out on the street sweeping away the debris. Once at a communitymeeting, he said, to the shock of others in the room, “The only way we’re goingto clean up this street is to get rid of the spics and niggers.” In 1981, Goetzwas mugged by three black youths as he entered the Canal Street station oneafternoon. He ran out of the station with the three of them in pursuit. Theygrabbed the electronics equipment he was carrying, beat him, and threw him upagainst a plate glass door, leaving him with permanent damage to his chest. Withthe help of an off duty sanitation worker, Goetz managed to subdue one of histhree attackers. But the experience left him embittered. He had to spend sixhours in the station house, talking to police, while his assailant was releasedafter two hours and charged, in the end, with only a misdemeanor. He applied tothe city for a gun permit. He was turned down. In September 1984, his fatherdied. Three months later, he sat down next to four black youths on the subwayand started shooting.Here, in short, was a man with an authority problem, with a strong sense thatthe system wasn’t working, who had been the recent target of humiliation.Lillian Rubin, Goetz’s biographer, writes that his choice to live on FourteenthStreet could hardly have been an accident. “For Bernie,” she writes, “thereseems to be something seductive about the setting. Precisely because of itsdeficits and discomforts, it provided him with a comprehensible target for therage that lives inside him. By focusing it on the external world, he need notdeal with his internal one. He rails about the dirt, the noise, the drunks, thecrime, the pushers, the junkies. And all with good reason.” Goetz’s bullets,Rubin concludes, were “aimed at targets that existed as much in his past as inthe present.”If you think of what happened on the number two train this way, the shootingbegins to feel inevitable. Four hoodlums confront a man with apparentpsychological problems. That the shooting took place on the subway seemsincidental. Goetz would have shot those four kids if he had been sitting in aBurger King. Most of the formal explanations we use for criminal behavior followalong the same logic. Psychiatrists talk about criminals as people with stuntedpsychological development, people who have had pathological relationships withtheir parents, who lack adequate role models. There is a relatively newliterature that talks about genes that may or may not dispose certainindividuals to crime. On the popular side, there are endless numbers of books byconservatives talking about crime as a consequence of moral failure—ofcommunities and schools and parents who no longer raise children with a respectfor right and wrong. All of those theories are essentially ways of saying thatthe criminal is a personality type—a personality type distinguished by aninsensitivity to the norms of normal society. People with stunted psychologicaldevelopment don’t understand how to conduct healthy relationships. People withgenetic predispositions to violence fly off the handle when normal people keeptheir cool. People who aren’t taught right from wrong are oblivious to what isand what is not appropriate behavior. People who grow up poor, fatherless, andbuffeted by racism don’t have the same commitment to social norms as those fromhealthy middle class homes. Bernie Goetz and those four thugs on the subwaywere, in this sense, prisoners of their own, dysfunctional, world.But what do Broken Windows and the Power of Context suggest? Exactly theopposite. They say that the criminal—far from being someone who acts forfundamental, intrinsic reasons and who lives in his own world—is actuallysomeone acutely sensitive to his environment, who is alert to all kinds of cues,and who is prompted to commit crimes based on his perception of the world aroundhim. That is an incredibly radical—and in some sense unbelievable—idea. There isan even more radical dimension here. The Power of Context is an environmentalargument. It says that behavior is a function of social context. But it is avery strange kind of environmentalism. In the 1960s, liberals made a similarkind of argument, but when they talked about the importance of environment theywere talking about the importance of fundamental social factors: crime, theysaid, was the result of social injustice, of structural economic inequities, ofunemployment, of racism, of decades of institutional and social neglect, so thatif you wanted to stop crime you had to undertake some fairly heroic steps. Butthe Power of Context says that what really matters is little things. The Powerof Context says that the showdown on the subway between Bernie Goetz and thosefour youths had very little to do, in the end, with the tangled psychologicalpathology of Goetz, and very little as well to do with the background andpoverty of the four youths who accosted him, and everything to do with themessage sent by the graffiti on the walls and the disorder at the turnstiles.The Power of Context says you don’t have to solve the big problems to solvecrime. You can prevent crimes just by scrubbing off graffiti and arresting farebeaters: crime epidemics have Tipping Points every bit as simple andstraightforward as syphilis in Baltimore or a fashion trend like Hush Puppies.This is what I meant when I called the Power of Context a radical theory.Giuliani and Bratton—far from being conservatives, as they are commonlyidentified—actually represent on the question of crime the most extreme liberalposition imaginable, a position so extreme that it is almost impossible toaccept. How can it be that what was going on in Bernie Goetz’s head doesn’tmatter? And if it is really true that it doesn’t matter, why is that fact sohard to believe?4.In chapter 2, when I was discussing what made someone like Mark Alpert soimportant in word of mouth epidemics, I talked about two seeminglycounterintuitive aspects of persuasion. One was the study that showed how peoplewho watched Peter Jennings on ABC were more likely to vote Republican thanpeople who watched either Tom Brokaw or Dan Rather because, in some unconsciousway, Jennings was able to signal his affection for Republican candidates. Thesecond study showed how people who were charismatic could—without sayinganything and with the briefest of exposures—infect others with their emotions.The implications of those two studies go to the heart of the Law of the Few,because they suggest that what we think of as inner states—preferences andemotions—are actually powerfully and imperceptibly influenced by seeminglyinconsequential personal influences, by a newscaster we watch for a few minutesa day or by someone we sit next to, in silence, in a two minute experiment. Theessence of the Power of Context is that the same thing is true for certain kindsof environments—that in ways that we don’t necessarily appreciate, our innerstates are the result of our outer circumstances. The field of psychology isrich with experiments that demonstrate this fact. Let me give you just a fewexamples.In the early 1970s, a group of social scientists at Stanford University, led byPhilip Zimbardo, decided to create a mock prison in the basement of theuniversity’s psychology building. They took a thirty five foot section ofcorridor and created a cell block with a prefabricated wall. Three small, six bynine foot cells were created from laboratory rooms and given steel barred, blackpainted doors. A closet was turned into a solitary confinement cell. The groupthen advertised in the local papers for volunteers, men who would agree toparticipate in the experiment. Seventy five people applied, and from thoseZimbardo and his colleagues picked the 21 who appeared the most normal andhealthy on psychological tests. Half of the group were chosen, at random, to beguards, and were given uniforms and dark glasses and told that theirresponsibility was to keep order in the prison. The other half were told thatthey were to be prisoners. Zimbardo got the Palo Alto Police Department to“arrest” the prisoners in their homes, cuff them, bring them to the stationhouse, charge them with a fictitious crime, fingerprint them, then blindfoldthem and bring them to the prison in the Psychology Department basement. Thenthey were stripped and given a prison uniform to wear, with a number on thefront and back that was to serve as their only means of identification for theduration of their incarceration.The purpose of the experiment was to try to find out why prisons are such nastyplaces. Was it because prisons are full of nasty people, or was it becauseprisons are such nasty environments that they make people nasty? In the answerto that question is obviously the answer to the question posed by Bernie Goetzand the subway cleanup, which is how much influence does immediate environmenthave on the way people behave? What Zimbardo found out shocked him. The guards,some of whom had previously identified themselves as pacifists, fell quicklyinto the role of hard bitten disciplinarians. The first night they woke up theprisoners at two in the morning and made them do pushups, line up against thewall, and perform other arbitrary tasks. On the morning of the second day, theprisoners rebelled. They ripped off their numbers and barricaded themselves intheir cells. The guards responded by stripping them, spraying them with fireextinguishers, and throwing the leader of the rebellion into solitaryconfinement. “There were times when we were pretty abusive, getting right intheir faces and yelling at them,” one guard remembers. “It was part of the wholeatmosphere of terror.” As the experiment progressed, the guards gotsystematically crueler and more sadistic. “What we were unprepared for was theintensity of the change and the speed at which it happened,” Zimbardo says. Theguards were making the prisoners say to one another they loved each other, andmaking them march down the hallway, in handcuffs, with paper bags over theirheads. “It was completely the opposite from the way I conduct myself now,”another guard remembers. “I think I was positively creative in terms of mymental cruelty.” After 36 hours, one prisoner began to get hysterical, and hadto be released. Four more then had to be released because of “extreme emotionaldepression, crying, rage, and acute anxiety.” Zimbardo had originally intendedto have the experiment run for two weeks. He called it off after six days. “Irealize now,” one prisoner said after the experiment was over, “that no matterhow together I thought I was inside my head, my prisoner behavior was often lessunder my control than I realized.” Another said: “I began to feel that I waslosing my identity, that the person I call ———, the person who volunteered toget me into this prison (because it was a prison to me, it still is a prison tome, I don’t regard it as an experiment or a simulation...) was distant from me,was remote, until finally I wasn’t that person. I was 416. I was really mynumber and 416 was really going to have to decide what to do.”Zimbardo’s conclusion was that there are specific situations so powerful thatthey can overwhelm our inherent predispositions. The key word here is situation.Zimbardo isn’t talking about environment, about the major external influences onall of our lives. He’s not denying that how we are raised by our parents affectswho we are, or that the kind of schools we went to, the friends we have, or theneighborhoods we live in affect our behavior. All of these things areundoubtedly important. Nor is he denying that our genes play a role indetermining who we are. Most psychologists believe that nature—genetics—accountsfor about half of the reason why we tend to act the way we do. His point issimply that there are certain times and places and conditions when much of thatcan be swept away, that there are instances where you can take normal peoplefrom good schools and happy families and good neighborhoods and powerfullyaffect their behavior merely by changing the immediate details of theirsituation.This same argument was made, perhaps more explicitly, in the 1920s in a landmarkset of experiments by two New York–based researchers, Hugh Hartshorne and M. A.May. Hartshorne and May took as their subjects about eleven thousandschoolchildren between the ages of eight and sixteen, and over the course ofseveral months they gave them literally dozens of tests, all designed to measurehonesty. The types of tests that Hartshorne and May used are quite central totheir conclusion, so I’ll identify a number of them in some detail.One set, for example, was simple aptitude tests developed by the Institute forEducational Research, a precursor to the group that now develops the SATs. Inthe sentence completion test, children were asked to fill in words that had beenleft blank. For example: “The poor little———has———nothing to———; he is hungry.”In the arithmetic test, children were given math questions like “When sugarcosts 10 cents a pound, how much will five pounds cost” and asked to write theiranswers in the margin. The tests were given in only a fraction of the timeusually needed for completion, so most children had lots of unansweredquestions, and when the time was up the tests were collected and graded. Thefollowing day the students were given the same kinds of tests again, withquestions that were different but of equal difficulty. This time, though, thestudents were given an answer key and, under minimal supervision, told to gradetheir own papers. Hartshorne and May, in other words, had set up a stingoperation. With the answers in hand and lots of unanswered questions, thestudents had ample opportunity to cheat. And with the previous day’s tests inhand, Hartshorne and May could compare the first day’s answers to the second,and get a good sense of how much each student was cheating.Another set of tests was what are called speed tests, much simpler measures ofability. Students were given 56 pairs of numbers and told to add them. Or theywere shown a sequence of several hundred randomly arranged letters of thealphabet and asked to read through them and underline all the A’s. Students wereallowed a minute to complete each of these tests. Then they were given anotherset of equivalent tests, only this time the time limit wasn’t enforced at all,allowing the students to keep on working if they wanted to. In all, the twopsychologists administered countless different tests in countless differentsituations. They had children undertake tests of physical ability, like chin upsor broad jumps, and secretly observed them to see whether they cheated inreporting how well they did. They gave students tests to do at home, where theyhad ample opportunity to use dictionaries or ask for help, and compared thoseresults to how they did on similar tests administered at school, where cheatingwas impossible. In the end, their results fill three thick volumes and, alongthe way, challenge a lot of preconceptions of what character is.Their first conclusion is, unsurprisingly, that lots of cheating goes on. In onecase, the scores on tests where cheating was possible were 50 percent higher, onaverage, than the “honest” scores. When Hartshorne and May began to look forpatterns in the cheating, some of their findings were equally obvious. Smartchildren cheat a little less than less intelligent children. Girls cheat aboutas much as boys. Older children cheat more than younger children, and those fromstable and happy homes cheat a bit less than those from unstable and unhappyhomes. If you analyze the data you can find general patterns of behavioralconsistency from test to test.But the consistency isn’t nearly as high as you might expect. There isn’t onetight little circle of cheaters and one tight little circle of honest students.Some kids cheat at home but not at school; some kids cheat at school but not athome. Whether or not a child cheated on, say, the word completion test was notan iron clad predictor of whether he or she would cheat on, say, the underliningA’s part of the speed test. If you gave the same group of kids the same test,under the same circumstances six months apart, Hartshorne and May found, thesame kids would cheat in the same ways in both cases. But once you changed anyof those variables—the material on the test, or the situation in which it wasadministered—the kinds of cheating would change as well.What Hartshorne and May concluded, then, is that something like honesty isn’t afundamental trait, or what they called a “unified” trait. A trait like honesty,they concluded, is considerably influenced by the situation. “Most children,”they wrote,will deceive in certain situations and not in others. Lying, cheating, andstealing as measured by the test situations used in these studies are only veryloosely related. Even cheating in the classroom is rather highly specific, for achild may cheat on an arithmetic test and not on a spelling test, etc. Whether achild will practice deceit in any given situation depends in part on hisintelligence, age, home background, and the like and in part on the nature ofthe situation itself and his particular relation to it.This, I realize, seems wildly counterintuitive. If I asked you to describe thepersonality of your best friends, you could do so easily, and you wouldn’t saythings like “My friend Howard is incredibly generous, but only when I ask himfor things, not when his family asks him for things,” or “My friend Alice iswonderfully honest when it comes to her personal life, but at work she can bevery slippery.” You would say, instead, that your friend Howard is generous andyour friend Alice is honest. All of us, when it comes to personality, naturallythink in terms of absolutes: that a person is a certain way or is not a certainway. But what Zimbardo and Hartshorne and May are suggesting is that this is amistake, that when we think only in terms of inherent traits and forget the roleof situations, we’re deceiving ourselves about the real causes of humanbehavior.Why do we make this mistake? It’s probably the result of the way evolution hasstructured our brain. For instance, anthropologists who study vervets find thatthese kinds of monkeys are really bad at picking up the significance of thingslike an antelope carcass hanging in a tree (which is a sure sign that a leopardis in the vicinity) or the presence of python tracks. Vervets have been known towaltz into a thicket, ignoring a fresh trail of python tracks, and then actstunned when they actually come across the snake itself. This doesn’t mean thatvervets are stupid: they are very sophisticated when it comes to questions thathave to do with other vervets. They can hear the call of a male vervet andrecognize whether it comes from their own group or a neighboring group. Ifvervets hear a baby vervet’s cry of distress, they will look immediately not inthe direction of the baby, but at its mother—they know instantly whose baby itis. A vervet, in other words, is very good at processing certain kinds ofvervetish information, but not so good at processing other kinds of information.The same is true of humans.Consider the following brain teaser. Suppose I give you four cards labeled withthe letters A and D and the numerals 3 and 6. The rule of the game is that acard with a vowel on it always has an even number on the other side. Which ofthe cards would you have to turn over to prove this rule to be true? The answeris two: the A card and the three card. The overwhelming majority of people giventhis test, though, don’t get it right. They tend to answer just the A card, orthe A and the six. It’s a hard question. But now let me pose another question.Suppose four people are drinking in a bar. One is drinking Coke. One is sixteen.One is drinking beer and one is twenty five. Given the rule that no one undertwenty one is allowed to drink beer, which of those people’s IDs do we have tocheck to make sure the law is being observed? Now the answer is easy. In fact,I’m sure that almost everyone will get it right: the beer drinker and thesixteen year old. But, as the psychologist Leda Cosmides (who dreamt up thisexample) points out, it is exactly the same puzzle as the A, D, 3, and 6 puzzle.The difference is that it is framed in a way that makes it about people, insteadof about numbers, and as human beings we are a lot more sophisticated about eachother than we are about the abstract world.The mistake we make in thinking of character as something unified and allencompassing is very similar to a kind of blind spot in the way we processinformation. Psychologists call this tendency the Fundamental Attribution Error(FAE), which is a fancy way of saying that when it comes to interpreting otherpeople’s behavior, human beings invariably make the mistake of overestimatingthe importance of fundamental character traits and underestimating theimportance of the situation and context. We will always reach for a“dispositional” explanation for events, as opposed to a contextual explanation.In one experiment, for instance, a group of people are told to watch two sets ofsimilarly talented basketball players, the first of whom are shooting baskets ina well lighted gym and the second of whom are shooting baskets in a badlylighted gym (and obviously missing a lot of shots). Then they are asked to judgehow good the players were. The players in the well lighted gym were consideredsuperior. In another example, a group of people are brought in for an experimentand told they are going to play a quiz game. They are paired off and they drawlots. One person gets a card that says he or she is going to be the“Contestant.” The other is told he or she is going to be the “Questioner.” TheQuestioner is then asked to draw up a list of ten “challenging but notimpossible” questions based on areas of particular interest or expertise, sosomeone who is into Ukrainian folk music might come up with a series ofquestions based on Ukrainian folk music. The questions are posed to theContestant, and after the quiz is over, both parties are asked to estimate thelevel of general knowledge of the other. Invariably, the Contestants rate theQuestioners as being a lot smarter than they themselves are.You can do these kinds of experiments a thousand different ways and the answeralmost always comes out the same way. This happens even when you give people aclear and immediate environmental explanation of the behavior they are beingasked to evaluate: that the gym, in the first case, has few lights on; that theContestant is being asked to answer the most impossibly biased and rigged set ofquestions. In the end, this doesn’t make much difference. There is something inall of us that makes us instinctively want to explain the world around us interms of people’s essential attributes: he’s a better basketball player, thatperson is smarter than I am.We do this because, like vervets, we are a lot more attuned to personal cuesthan contextual cues. The FAE also makes the world a much simpler and moreunderstandable place. In recent years, for example, there has been much interestin the idea that one of the most fundamental factors in explaining personalityis birth order: older siblings are domineering and conservative, youngersiblings more creative and rebellious. When psychologists actually try to verifythis claim, however, their answers sound like the Hartshorne and Mayconclusions. We do reflect the influences of birth order but, as thepsychologist Judith Harris points out in The Nurture Assumption, only around ourfamilies. When they are away from their families—in different contexts—oldersiblings are no more likely to be domineering and younger siblings no morelikely to be rebellious than anyone else. The birth order myth is an example ofthe FAE in action. But you can see why we are so drawn to it. It is much easierto define people just in terms of their family personality. It’s a kind ofshorthand. If we constantly had to qualify every assessment of those around us,how would we make sense of the world? How much harder would it be to make thethousands of decisions we are required to make about whether we like someone orlove someone or trust someone or want to give someone advice? The psychologistWalter Mischel argues that the human mind has a kind of “reducing valve” that“creates and maintains the perception of continuity even in the face ofperpetual observed changes in actual behavior.” He writes:When we observe a woman who seems hostile and fiercely independent some of thetime but passive, dependent and feminine on other occasions, our reducing valveusually makes us choose between the two syndromes. We decide that one pattern isin the service of the other, or that both are in the service of a third motive.She must be a really castrating lady with a fa,ade of passivity—or perhaps sheis a warm, passive dependent woman with a surface defense of aggressiveness. Butperhaps nature is bigger than our concepts and it is possible for the lady to bea hostile, fiercely independent, passive, dependent, feminine, aggressive, warm,castrating person all in one. Of course which of these she is at any particularmoment would not be random or capricious—it would depend on who she is with,when, how, and much, much more. But each of these aspects of her self may be aquite genuine and real aspect of her total being.Character, then, isn’t what we think it is or, rather, what we want it to be. Itisn’t a stable, easily identifiable set of closely related traits, and it onlyseems that way because of a glitch in the way our brains are organized.Character is more like a bundle of habits and tendencies and interests, looselybound together and dependent, at certain times, on circumstance and context. Thereason that most of us seem to have a consistent character is that most of usare really good at controlling our environment. I have a lot of fun at dinnerparties. As I result, I throw a lot of dinner parties and my friends see methere and think that I’m fun. But if I couldn’t have lots of dinner parties, ifmy friends instead tended to see me in lots of different situations over which Ihad little or no control—like, say, faced with four hostile youths in a filthy,broken down subway—they probably wouldn’t think of me as fun anymore.5.Some years ago two Princeton University psychologists, John Darley and DanielBatson, decided to conduct a study inspired by the biblical story of the GoodSamaritan. As you may recall, that story, from the New Testament Gospel of Luke,tells of a traveler who has been beaten and robbed and left for dead by the sideof the road from Jerusalem to Jericho. Both a priest and a Levite—worthy, piousmen—came upon the man but did not stop, “passing by on the other side.” The onlyman to help was a Samaritan—the member of a despised minority—who “went up tohim and bound up his wounds” and took him to an inn. Darley and Batson decidedto replicate that study at the Princeton Theological Seminary. This was anexperiment very much in the tradition of the FAE, and it is an importantdemonstration of how the Power of Context has implications for the way we thinkabout social epidemics of all kinds, not just violent crime.Darley and Batson met with a group of seminarians, individually, and asked eachone to prepare a short, extemporaneous talk on a given biblical theme, then walkover to a nearby building to present it. Along the way to the presentation, eachstudent ran into a man slumped in an alley, head down, eyes closed, coughing andgroaning. The question was, who would stop and help? Darley and Batsonintroduced three variables into the experiment, to make its results moremeaningful. First, before the experiment even started, they gave the students aquestionnaire about why they had chosen to study theology. Did they see religionas a means for personal and spiritual fulfillment? Or were they looking for apractical tool for finding meaning in everyday life? Then they varied thesubject of the theme the students were asked to talk about. Some were asked tospeak on the relevance of the professional clergy to the religious vocation.Others were given the parable of the Good Samaritan. Finally, the instructionsgiven by the experimenters to each student varied as well. In some of the cases,as he sent the students on their way, the experimenter would look at his watchand say, “Oh, you’re late. They were expecting you a few minutes ago. We’dbetter get moving.” In other cases, he would say, “It will be a few minutesbefore they’re ready for you, but you might as well head over now.”If you ask people to predict which seminarians played the Good Samaritan (andsubsequent studies have done just this) their answers are highly consistent.They almost all say that the students who entered the ministry to help peopleand those reminded of the importance of compassion by having just read theparable of the Good Samaritan will be the most likely to stop. Most of us, Ithink, would agree with those conclusions. In fact, neither of those factorsmade any difference. “It is hard to think of a context in which norms concerninghelping those in distress are more salient than for a person thinking about theGood Samaritan, and yet it did not significantly increase helping behavior,”Darley and Batson concluded. “Indeed, on several occasions, a seminary studentgoing to give his talk on the parable of the Good Samaritan literally steppedover the victim as he hurried on his way.” The only thing that really matteredwas whether the student was in a rush. Of the group that was, 10 percent stoppedto help. Of the group who knew they had a few minutes to spare, 63 percentstopped.What this study is suggesting, in other words, is that the convictions of yourheart and the actual contents of your thoughts are less important, in the end,in guiding your actions than the immediate context of your behavior. The words“Oh, you’re late” had the effect of making someone who was ordinarilycompassionate into someone who was indifferent to suffering—of turning someone,in that particular moment, into a different person. Epidemics are, at theirroot, about this very process of transformation. When we are trying to make anidea or attitude or product tip, we’re trying to change our audience in somesmall yet critical respect: we’re trying to infect them, sweep them up in ourepidemic, convert them from hostility to acceptance. That can be done throughthe influence of special kinds of people, people of extraordinary personalconnection. That’s the Law of the Few. It can be done by changing the content ofcommunication, by making a message so memorable that it sticks in someone’s mindand compels them to action. That is the Stickiness Factor. I think that both ofthose laws make intuitive sense. But we need to remember that small changes incontext can be just as important in tipping epidemics, even though that factappears to violate some of our most deeply held assumptions about human nature.This does not mean that our inner psychological states and personal historiesare not important in explaining our behavior. An enormous percentage of thosewho engage in violent acts, for example, have some kind of psychiatric disorderor come from deeply disturbed backgrounds. But there is a world of differencebetween being inclined toward violence and actually committing a violent act. Acrime is a relatively rare and aberrant event. For a crime to be committed,something extra, something additional, has to happen to tip a troubled persontoward violence, and what the Power of Context is saying is that those TippingPoints may be as simple and trivial as everyday signs of disorder like graffitiand fare beating. The implications of this idea are enormous. The previousnotion that disposition is everything—that the cause of violent behavior isalways “sociopathic personality” or “deficient superego” or the inability todelay gratification or some evil in the genes—is, in the end, the most passiveand reactive of ideas about crime. It says that once you catch a criminal youcan try to help him get better—give him Prozac, put him in therapy, try torehabilitate him—but there is very little you can do to prevent crime fromhappening in the first place. The old understanding of handling crime epidemicsleads inevitably to a preoccupation with defensive measures against crime. Putan extra lock on the door, to slow the burglar down and maybe encourage him togo next door. Lock up criminals for longer, so that they have less opportunityto do the rest of us harm. Move to the suburbs, to put as much distance aspossible between yourself and the majority of criminals.Once you understand that context matters, however, that specific and relativelysmall elements in the environment can serve as Tipping Points, that defeatism isturned upside down. Environmental Tipping Points are things that we can change:we can fix broken windows and clean up graffiti and change the signals thatinvite crime in the first place. Crime can be more than understood. It can beprevented. There is a broader dimension to this. Judith Harris has convincinglyargued that peer influence and community influence are more important thanfamily influence in determining how children turn out. Studies of juveniledelinquency and high school drop out rates, for example, demonstrate that achild is better off in a good neighborhood and a troubled family than he or sheis in a troubled neighborhood and a good family. We spend so much timecelebrating the importance and power of family influence that it may seem, atfirst blush, that this can’t be true. But in reality it is no more than anobvious and commonsensical extension of the Power of Context, because it sayssimply that children are powerfully shaped by their external environment, thatthe features of our immediate social and physical world—the streets we walkdown, the people we encounter—play a huge role in shaping who we are and how weact. It isn’t just serious criminal behavior, in the end, that is sensitive toenvironmental cues, it is all behavior. Weird as it sounds, if you add up themeaning of the Stanford prison experiment and the New York subway experiment,they suggest that it is possible to be a better person on a clean street or in aclean subway than in one littered with trash and graffiti.“In a situation like this, you’re in a combat situation,” Goetz told hisneighbor Myra Friedman, in an anguished telephone call just days after theshooting. “You’re not thinking in a normal way. Your memory isn’t even workingnormally. You are so hyped up. Your vision actually changes. Your field of viewchanges. Your capabilities change. What you are capable of changes.” He acted,Goetz went on, “viciously and savagely....If you corner a rat and you are aboutto butcher it, okay? The way I responded was viciously and savagely, just likethat, like a rat.”Of course he did. He was in a rat hole."},{"pageContent":"FIVE [TippingPoint_toc.html#chap_5]The Power of Context(Part Two)THE MAGIC NUMBERONE HUNDRED AND FIFTYIn 1996, a sometime actress and playwright by the name of Rebecca Wellspublished a book entitled Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood. Its arrival inthe bookstores was not a major literary event. Wells had written one previousbook—Little Altars Everywhere—which had been a minor cult hit in and around herhometown of Seattle. But she was not Danielle Steel or Mary Higgins Clark. WhenWells gave a reading soon after her book was published in Greenwich,Connecticut, there were seven people in the audience. She had a smattering ofreviews here and there, mostly positive, and in the end her book sold a veryrespectable 15,000 copies in hardcover.A year later, Ya Ya Sisterhood came out in paperback. The first edition of18,000 copies sold out in the first few months, exceeding expectations. By earlysummer, total paperback sales had reached 30,000, and both Wells and her editorbegan to get the sense that something strange and wonderful was about to happen.“I’d be signing books and there would be groups of women who would cometogether—six or seven women—and they would have me sign anywhere between threeand ten books,” Wells remembered later. Wells’s editor, Diane Reverand, went toher marketing people and said it was time for an advertising campaign. Theybought one ad, opposite the contents page of the New Yorker magazine, and in thespace of a month sales doubled to 60,000. Going from one reading to the next,across the country, Wells began to see changes in the composition of heraudience. “I started noticing mothers and daughters coming. The daughters wouldbe in their late thirties, early forties. The mothers were of the generation whowent to high school during World War Two. Then I noticed that there started tobe three generations coming, twentysomethings as well. And then, to my totaldelight—and this didn’t happen until later—there would be teenagers and fifthgraders.”Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood was not yet on the bestseller lists. Thatwouldn’t happen until February 1998, when it would hit the charts and staythere, through 48 printings and 2.5 million copies. The national mediaattention—the articles in the big women’s magazines and the appearance ontelevision shows that would turn Wells into a celebrity—hadn’t started yeteither. But through the power of word of mouth, her book had tipped. “Theturning point for me was probably in northern California, the winter after thepaperback came out,” Wells said. “I walked into a situation where all of asudden there were seven hundred and eight hundred people at my readings.”Why did Ya Ya Sisterhood turn into an epidemic? In retrospect, the answer seemsfairly straightforward. The book itself is heartwarming and beautifully written,a compelling story of friendship and mother daughter relationships. It spoke topeople. It’s sticky. Then there’s the fact that Wells herself is an actress. Shedidn’t read from her novel as she traveled across the country so much as sheacted it out, playing each character with such skill that she turned herreadings into performances. Wells is a classic Salesman. But there is a third,less obvious, factor here, which has to do with the last of the principles ofepidemics. The success of Ya Ya is a tribute to the Power of Context. Morespecifically, it is testimony to the power of one specific aspect of context,which is the critical role that groups play in social epidemics.1.In a way, this is an obvious observation. Anyone who has ever been to the moviesknows that the size of the crowd in the theater has a big effect on how good themovie seems: comedies are never funnier and thrillers never more thrilling thanin a packed movie house. Psychologists tell us much the same thing: that whenpeople are asked to consider evidence or make decisions in a group, they come tovery different conclusions than when they are asked the same questions bythemselves. Once we’re part of a group, we’re all susceptible to peer pressureand social norms and any number of other kinds of influence that can play acritical role in sweeping us up in the beginnings of an epidemic.Have you ever wondered, for example, how religious movements get started?Usually, we think of them as a product of highly charismatic evangelists, peoplelike the Apostle Paul or Billy Graham or Brigham Young. But the spread of anynew and contagious ideology also has a lot to do with the skillful use of grouppower. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, for example, theMethodist movement became epidemic in England and North America, tipping from20,000 to 90,000 followers in the U.S. in the space of five or six years in the1780s. But Methodism’s founder, John Wesley, was by no means the mostcharismatic preacher of his era. That honor belonged to George Whitfield, anorator of such power and charisma that, it was said, he once charmed a fivepound contribution out of Benjamin Franklin—who was, of course, the furthestthing from a churchgoer. Nor was Wesley a great theologian, in the tradition of,say, John Calvin or Martin Luther. His genius was organizational. Wesley wouldtravel around England and North America delivering open air sermons to thousandsof people. But he didn’t just preach. He also stayed long enough in each town toform the most enthusiastic of his converts into religious societies, which inturn he subdivided into smaller classes of a dozen or so people. Converts wererequired to attend weekly meetings and to adhere to a strict code of conduct. Ifthey failed to live up to Methodist standards, they were expelled from thegroup. This was a group, in other words, that stood for something. Over thecourse of his life, Wesley traveled ceaselessly among these groups, covering asmuch as four thousand miles a year by horseback, reinforcing the tenets ofMethodist belief. He was a classic Connector. He was a super Paul Revere. Thedifference is, though, that he wasn’t one person with ties to many other people.He was one person with ties to many groups, which is a small but criticaldistinction. Wesley realized that if you wanted to bring about a fundamentalchange in people’s belief and behavior, a change that would persist and serve asan example to others, you needed to create a community around them, where thosenew beliefs could be practiced and expressed and nurtured.This, I think, helps to explain why the Ya Ya Sisterhood tipped as well. Thefirst bestseller list on which Ya Ya Sisterhood appeared was the NorthernCalifornia Independent Bookseller’s list. Northern California, as Wells said,was where 700 and 800 people first began showing up at her readings. It waswhere the Ya Ya epidemic began. Why? Because, according to Reverand, the SanFrancisco area is home to one of the country’s strongest book group cultures,and from the beginning Ya Ya was what publishers refer to as a “book groupbook.” It was the kind of emotionally sophisticated, character driven, multilayered novel that invites reflection and discussion, and book groups wereflocking to it. The groups of women who were coming to Wells’s readings weremembers of reading groups, and they were buying extra copies not just for familyand friends but for other members of their group. And because Ya Ya was beingtalked about and read in groups, the book itself became that much stickier. It’seasier to remember and appreciate something, after all, if you discuss it fortwo hours with your best friends. It becomes a social experience, an object ofconversation. Ya Ya’s roots in book group culture tipped it into a larger wordof mouth epidemic.Wells says that at the end of readings, during the question and answer session,women in the audience would tell her, “We’ve been in a book group for two years,and then we read your book and something else happened. It started to drop downto a level of sharing that was more like friendship. They told me that they hadstarted going to the beach together, or having parties at each other’s houses.”Women began forming Ya Ya Sisterhood groups of their own, in imitation of thegroup described in the book, and bringing Wells pictures of their group for herto sign. Wesley’s Methodism spread like wildfire through England and Americabecause Wesley was shuttling back and forth among hundreds and hundreds ofgroups, and each group was then taking his message and making it even stickier.The word about Ya Ya was spreading in the same way, from reading group toreading group, from Ya Ya group to Ya Ya group and from one of Wells’s readingsto another, because for over a year she stopped everything else and toured thecountry nonstop.The lesson of Ya Ya and John Wesley is that small, close knit groups have thepower to magnify the epidemic potential of a message or idea. That conclusion,however, still leaves a number of critical questions unanswered. The word group,for instance, is a term used to describe everything from a basketball team tothe Teamsters Union, from two couples on a holiday to the Republican Party. Ifwe are interested in starting an epidemic—in reaching a Tipping Point—what arethe most effective kinds of groups? Is there a simple rule of thumb thatdistinguishes a group with real social authority from a group with little powerat all? As it turns out, there is. It’s called the Rule of 150, and it is afascinating example of the strange and unexpected ways in which context affectsthe course of social epidemics.2.There is a concept in cognitive psychology called the channel capacity, whichrefers to the amount of space in our brain for certain kinds of information.Suppose, for example, that I played you a number of different musical tones, atrandom, and asked you to identify each one with a number. If I played you areally low tone, you would call it one, and if I played you a medium tone youwould call it two, and a high tone you would call three. The purpose of the testis to find out how long you can continue to distinguish among different tones.People with perfect pitch, of course, can play this game forever. You can playthem dozens of tones, and they’ll be able to distinguish between all of them.But for the majority of us, this game is much harder. Most people can dividetones into only about six different categories before they begin to makemistakes and start lumping different tones in the same category. This is aremarkably consistent finding. If, for example, I played you five very highpitched tones, you’d be able to tell them apart. And if I played you five verylow pitched tones, you’d be able to tell them apart. You’d think, then, that ifI combined those high and low tones and played them for you all at once, you’dbe able to divide them into ten categories. But you won’t be able to. Chancesare you’ll still be stuck at about six categories.This natural limit shows up again and again in simple tests. If I make you drinktwenty glasses of iced tea, each with a different amount of sugar in it, and askyou to sort them into categories according to sweetness, you’ll only be able todivide them into six or seven different categories before you begin to makemistakes. Or if I flash dots on a screen in front of you very quickly and askyou to count how many you see, you’d get the number right up to about sevendots, and then you’d need to guess. “There seems to be some limitation builtinto us either by learning or by the design of our nervous systems, a limit thatkeeps our channel capacities in this general range,” the psychologist GeorgeMiller concluded in his famous essay “The Magical Number Seven.” This is thereason that telephone numbers have seven digits. “Bell wanted a number to be aslong as possible so they could have as large a capacity as possible, but not solong that people couldn’t remember it,” says Jonathan Cohen, a memory researcherat Princeton University. At eight or nine digits, the local telephone numberwould exceed the human channel capacity: there would be many more wrong numbers.As human beings, in other words, we can only handle so much information at once.Once we pass a certain boundary, we become overwhelmed. What I’m describing hereis an intellectual capacity—our ability to process raw information. But if youthink about it, we clearly have a channel capacity for feelings as well.Take a minute, for example, to make a list of all the people you know whosedeath would leave you truly devastated. Chances are you will come up with around12 names. That, at least, is the average answer that most people give to thatquestion. Those names make up what psychologists call our sympathy group. Whyaren’t groups any larger? Partly it’s a question of time. If you look at thenames on your sympathy list, they are probably the people whom you devote themost attention to—either on the telephone, in person, or thinking and worryingabout. If your list was twice as long, if it had 30 names on it, and, as aresult, you spent only half as much time with everyone on it, would you still beas close to everyone? Probably not. To be someone’s best friend requires aminimum investment of time. More than that, though, it takes emotional energy.Caring about someone deeply is exhausting. At a certain point, at somewherebetween 10 and 15 people, we begin to overload, just as we begin to overloadwhen we have to distinguish between too many tones. It’s a function of the wayhumans are constructed. As the evolutionary biologist S. L. Washburn writes:Most of human evolution took place before the advent of agriculture when menlived in small groups, on a face to face basis. As a result human biology hasevolved as an adaptive mechanism to conditions that have largely ceased toexist. Man evolved to feel strongly about few people, short distances, andrelatively brief intervals of time; and these are still the dimensions of lifethat are important to him.Perhaps the most interesting natural limit, however, is what might be called oursocial channel capacity. The case for a social capacity has been made, mostpersuasively, by the British anthropologist Robin Dunbar. Dunbar begins with asimple observation. Primates—monkeys, chimps, baboons, humans—have the biggestbrains of all mammals. More important, a specific part of the brain of humansand other primates—the region known as the neocortex, which deals with complexthought and reasoning—is huge by mammal standards. For years, scientists haveargued back and forth about why this is the case. One theory is that our brainsevolved because our primate ancestors began to engage in more sophisticated foodgathering: instead of just eating grasses and leaves they began eating fruit,which takes more thinking power. You travel much farther to find fruit thanleaves, so you need to be able to create mental maps. You have to worry aboutripeness. You have to peel parts away in order to eat the flesh of a fruit, andso on. The problem with that theory is that if you try to match up brain sizewith eating patterns among primates, it doesn’t work. There are primate leafeaters with big brains and fruit eaters with smaller brains, just as there areprimates with small cortexes who travel great distances for their food andprimates with big brains who stay at home to eat, so the food argument is a deadend. So what does correlate with brain size? The answer, Dunbar argues, is groupsize. If you look at any species of primate—at every variety of monkey andape—the larger their neocortex is, the larger the average size of the groupsthey live with.Dunbar’s argument is that brains evolve, they get bigger, in order to handle thecomplexities of larger social groups. If you belong to a group of five people,Dunbar points out, you have to keep track of ten separate relationships: yourrelationships with the four others in your circle and the six other two wayrelationships between the others. That’s what it means to know everyone in thecircle. You have to understand the personal dynamics of the group, juggledifferent personalities, keep people happy, manage the demands on your own timeand attention, and so on. If you belong to a group of twenty people, however,there are now 190 two way relationships to keep track of: 19 involving yourselfand 171 involving the rest of the group. That’s a fivefold increase in the sizeof the group, but a twentyfold increase in the amount of information processingneeded to “know” the other members of the group. Even a relatively smallincrease in the size of a group, in other words, creates a significantadditional social and intellectual burden.Humans socialize in the largest groups of all primates because we are the onlyanimals with brains large enough to handle the complexities of that socialarrangement. Dunbar has actually developed an equation, which works for mostprimates, in which he plugs in what he calls the neocortex ratio of a particularspecies—the size of the neocortex relative to the size of the brain—and theequation spits out the expected maximum group size of the animal. If you plug inthe neocortex ratio for Homo sapiens, you get a group estimate of 147.8—orroughly 150. “The figure of 150 seems to represent the maximum number ofindividuals with whom we can have a genuinely social relationship, the kind ofrelationship that goes with knowing who they are and how they relate to us.Putting it another way, it’s the number of people you would not feel embarrassedabout joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar.”Dunbar has combed through the anthropological literature and found that thenumber 150 pops up again and again. For example, he looks at 21 different huntergatherer societies for which we have solid historical evidence, from the Walbiriof Australia to the Tauade of New Guinea to the Ammassalik of Greenland to theOna of Tierra del Fuego and found that the average number of people in theirvillages was 148.4. The same pattern holds true for military organization. “Overthe years military planners have arrived at a rule of thumb which dictates thatfunctional fighting units cannot be substantially larger than 200 men,” Dunbarwrites. “This, I suspect, is not simply a matter of how the generals in the rearexercise control and coordination, because companies have remained obduratelystuck at this size despite all the advances in communications technology sincethe first world war. Rather, it is as though the planners have discovered, bytrial and error over the centuries, that it is hard to get more than this numberof men sufficiently familiar with each other so that they can work together as afunctional unit.” It is still possible, of course, to run an army with largergroups. But at a bigger size you have to impose complicated hierarchies andrules and regulations and formal measures to try to command loyalty andcohesion. But below 150, Dunbar argues, it is possible to achieve these samegoals informally: “At this size, orders can be implemented and unruly behaviorcontrolled on the basis of personal loyalties and direct man to man contacts.With larger groups, this becomes impossible.”Then there is the example of the religious group known as the Hutterites, whofor hundreds of years have lived in self sufficient agricultural colonies inEurope and, since the early twentieth century, in North America. The Hutterites(who came out of the same tradition as the Amish and the Mennonites) have astrict policy that every time a colony approaches 150, they split it in two andstart a new one. “Keeping things under 150 just seems to be the best and mostefficient way to manage a group of people,” Bill Gross, one of the leaders of aHutterite colony outside Spokane told me. “When things get larger than that,people become strangers to one another.” The Hutterites, obviously, didn’t getthis idea from contemporary evolutionary psychology. They’ve been following the150 rule for centuries. But their rationale fits perfectly with Dunbar’stheories. At 150, the Hutterites believe, something happens—somethingindefinable but very real—that somehow changes the nature of communityovernight. “In smaller groups people are a lot closer. They’re knit together,which is very important if you want to be effective and successful at communitylife,” Gross said. “If you get too large, you don’t have enough work in common.You don’t have enough things in common, and then you start to become strangersand that close knit fellowship starts to get lost.” Gross spoke from experience.He had been in Hutterite colonies that had come near to that magic number andseen firsthand how things had changed. “What happens when you get that big isthat the group starts, just on its own, to form a sort of clan.” He made agesture with his hands, as if to demonstrate division. “You get two or threegroups within the larger group. That is something you really try to prevent, andwhen it happens it is a good time to branch out.”3.We have seen, in this book, how a number of relatively minor changes in ourexternal environment can have a dramatic effect on how we behave and who we are.Clean up graffiti and all of a sudden people who would otherwise commit crimessuddenly don’t. Tell a seminarian that he has to hurry and all of a sudden hestarts to ignore bystanders in obvious distress. The Rule of 150 suggests thatthe size of a group is another one of those subtle contextual factors that canmake a big difference. In the case of the Hutterites, people who are willing togo along with the group, who can be easily infected with the community ethosbelow the level of 150, somehow, suddenly—with just the smallest change in thesize of the community—become divided and alienated. Once that line, that TippingPoint, is crossed, they begin to behave very differently.If we want groups to serve as incubators for contagious messages, then, as theydid in the case of Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood or the early Methodistchurch, we have to keep groups below the 150 Tipping Point. Above that point,there begin to be structural impediments to the ability of the group to agreeand act with one voice. If we want to, say, develop schools in disadvantagedcommunities that can successfully counteract the poisonous atmosphere of theirsurrounding neighborhoods, this tells us that we’re probably better off buildinglots of little schools than one or two big ones. The Rule of 150 says thatcongregants of a rapidly expanding church, or the members of a social club, oranyone in a group activity banking on the epidemic spread of shared ideals needsto be particularly cognizant of the perils of bigness. Crossing the 150 line isa small change that can make a big difference.Perhaps the best example of an organization that has successfully navigated thisproblem is Gore Associates, a privately held, multimillion dollar high tech firmbased in Newark, Delaware. Gore is the company that makes the water resistantGore Tex fabric, as well as Glide dental floss, special insulating coatings forcomputer cables, and a variety of sophisticated specialty cartridges, filterbags, and tubes for the automobile, semiconductor, pharmaceutical, and medicalindustries. At Gore there are no titles. If you ask people who work there fortheir card, it will just say their name and underneath it the word “Associate,”regardless of how much money they make or how much responsibility they have orhow long they have been at the company. People don’t have bosses, they havesponsors—mentors—who watch out for their interests. There are no organizationcharts, no budgets, no elaborate strategic plans. Salaries are determinedcollectively. Headquarters for the company is a low slung, unpretentious redbrick building. The “executive” offices are small, plainly furnished rooms,along a narrow corridor. The corners of Gore buildings tend to be conferencerooms or free space, so that no one can be said to have a more prestigiousoffice. When I visited a Gore associate named Bob Hen, at one of the company’splants in Delaware, I tried, unsuccessfully, to get him to tell me what hisposition was. I suspected, from the fact that he had been recommended to me,that he was one of the top executives. But his office wasn’t any bigger thananyone else’s. His card just called him an “associate.” He didn’t seem to have asecretary, one that I could see anyway. He wasn’t dressed any differently fromanyone else, and when I kept asking the question again and again, all he finallysaid, with a big grin, was, “I’m a meddler.”Gore is, in short, a very unusual company with a clear and well articulatedphilosophy. It is a big established company attempting to behave like a smallentrepreneurial start up. By all accounts, that attempt has been wildlysuccessful. Whenever business experts make lists of the best American companiesto work for, or whenever consultants give speeches on the best managed Americancompanies, Gore is on the list. It has a rate of employee turnover that is abouta third the industry average. It has been profitable for thirty five consecutiveyears and has growth rates and an innovative, high profit product line that isthe envy of the industry. Gore has managed to create a small company ethos soinfectious and sticky that it has survived their growth into a billion dollarcompany with thousands of employees. And how did they do that? By (among otherthings) adhering to the Rule of 150.Wilbert “Bill” Gore—the late founder of the company—was no more influenced, ofcourse, by the ideas of Robin Dunbar than the Hutterites were. Like them, heseems to have stumbled on the principle by trial and error. “We found again andagain that things get clumsy at a hundred and fifty,” he told an interviewersome years ago, so 150 employees per plant became the company goal. In theelectronics division of the company, that means that no plant was built largerthan 50,000 square feet, since there was almost no way to put many more than 150people in a building that size. “People used to ask me, how do you do your longterm planning,” Hen said. “And I’d say, that’s easy, we put a hundred and fiftyparking spaces in the lot, and when people start parking on the grass, we knowit’s time to build a new plant.” That new plant doesn’t have to be far away. InGore’s home state of Delaware, for instance, the company has three plants withinsight of each other. In fact, the company has fifteen plants within a twelvemile radius in Delaware and Maryland. The buildings only have to be distinctenough to allow for an individual culture in each. “We’ve found that a parkinglot is a big gap between buildings,” one longtime associate, Burt Chase, toldme. “You’ve got to pick yourself up and walk across the lot, and that’s a bigeffort. That’s almost as much effort as it takes to get in your car and drivefive miles. There’s a lot of independence in just having a separate building.”As Gore has grown in recent years, the company has undergone an almost constantprocess of division and redivision. Other companies would just keep addingadditions to the main plant, or extend a production line, or double shifts. Goretries to split up groups into smaller and smaller pieces. When I visited Gore,for example, they had just divided their Gore Tex apparel business into twogroups, in order to get under the 150 limit. The more fashion oriented consumerbusiness of boots and backpacks and hiking gear was going off on its own,leaving behind the institutional business that makes Gore Tex uniforms forfirefighters and soldiers.It’s not hard to see the connection between this kind of organizationalstructure and the unusual, free form management style of Gore. The kind of bondthat Dunbar describes in small groups is essentially a kind of peer pressure:it’s knowing people well enough that what they think of you matters. He said,remember, that the company is the basic unit of military organization because,in a group under 150, “orders can be implemented and unruly behavior controlledon the basis of personal loyalties and direct man to man contacts.” That’s whatBill Gross was saying about his Hutterite community as well. The fissures theysee in Hutterite colonies that grow too big are the fissures that result whenthe bonds among some commune members begin to weaken. Gore doesn’t need formalmanagement structures in its small plants—it doesn’t need the usual layers ofmiddle and upper management—because in groups that small, informal personalrelationships are more effective. “The pressure that comes to bear if we are notefficient at a plant, if we are not creating good earnings for the company, thepeer pressure is unbelievable,” Jim Buckley, a longtime associate of the firm,told me. “This is what you get when you have small teams, where everybody knowseverybody. Peer pressure is much more powerful than a concept of a boss. Many,many times more powerful. People want to live up to what is expected of them.”In a larger, conventional sized manufacturing plant, Buckley said, you might getthe same kind of pressures. But they would work only within certain parts of theplant. The advantage of a Gore plant is that every part of the process fordesigning and making and marketing a given product is subject to the same groupscrutiny. “I just came back from Lucent Technologies up in New Jersey,” Buckleytold me. “It’s the plant where they make cells that operate our cellularphones—the pods, the boxes up and down I 95 that carry the signals. I spent aday in their plant. They have six hundred and fifty people. At best, theirmanufacturing people know some of their design people. But that’s it. They don’tknow any of the salespeople. They don’t know the sales support people. Theydon’t know the R and D people. They don’t know any of these people, nor do theyknow what is going on in those other aspects of the business. The pressure I’mtalking about is the kind you get when salespeople are in the same world as themanufacturing people, and the salesperson who wants to get a customer ordertaken care of can go directly and talk to someone they know on the manufacturingteam and say, I need that order. Here’s two people. One is trying to make theproduct, one is trying to get the product out. They go head to head and talkabout it. That’s peer pressure. You don’t see that at Lucent. They are removed.In the manufacturing realm, they had a hundred and fifty people, and they workedclosely together and there was peer pressure about how to be the best and how tobe the most innovative. But it just didn’t go outside the group. They don’t knoweach other. You go into the cafeteria and there are little groups of people.It’s a different kind of experience.”What Buckley is referring to here is the benefit of unity, of having everyone ina complex enterprise share a common relationship. There is a useful concept inpsychology that, I think, makes it much clearer what he’s speaking about. Thisis what University of Virginia psychologist Daniel Wegner calls “transactivememory.” When we talk about memory, we aren’t just talking about ideas andimpressions and facts stored inside our heads. An awful lot of what we rememberis actually stored outside our brains. Most of us deliberately don’t memorizemost of the phone numbers we need. But we do memorize where to find them—in aphone book, or in our personal Rolodex. Or we memorize the number 411, so we cancall directory assistance. Nor do most of us know, say, the capital of Paraguayor some other obscure country. Why bother? It’s an awful lot easier to buy anatlas and store that kind of information there. Perhaps most important, though,we store information with other people. Couples do this automatically. A fewyears ago, for example, Wegner set up a memory test with 59 couples, all of whomhad been dating for at least three months. Half of the couples were allowed tostay together, and half were split up, and given a new partner whom they didn’tknow. Wegner then asked all the pairs to read 64 statements, each with anunderlined word, like “Midori is a Japanese melon liqueur.” Five minutes afterlooking at all the statements, the pairs were asked to write down as many asthey could remember. Sure enough, the pairs who knew each other rememberedsubstantially more items than those who didn’t know each other. Wegner arguesthat when people know each other well, they create an implicit joint memorysystem—a transactive memory system—which is based on an understanding about whois best suited to remember what kinds of things. “Relationship development isoften understood as a process of mutual self disclosure,” he writes. “Althoughit is probably more romantic to cast this process as one of interpersonalrevelation and acceptance, it can also be appreciated as a necessary precursorto transactive memory.” Transactive memory is part of what intimacy means. Infact, Wegner argues, it is the loss of this kind of joint memory that helps tomake divorce so painful. “Divorced people who suffer depression and complain ofcognitive dysfunction may be expressing the loss of their external memorysystems,” he writes. “They once were able to discuss their experiences to reacha shared understanding....They once could count on access to a wide range ofstorage in their partner, and this, too, is gone....The loss of transactivememory feels like losing a part of one’s own mind.”In a family, this process of memory sharing is even more pronounced. Most of usremember, at one time, only a fraction of the day to day details and historiesof our family life. But we know, implicitly, where to go to find the answers toour questions—whether it is up to our spouse to remember where we put our keysor our thirteen year old to find out how to work the computer or our mother tofind out details of our childhood. Perhaps more important, when new informationarises, we know who should have responsibility for storing it. This is how, in afamily, expertise emerges. The thirteen year old is the family expert on thecomputer not just because he has the greatest aptitude for electronic equipmentor because he uses computers the most, but also because when new informationabout the family computer arises, he is the one assigned, automatically, toremember it. Expertise leads to more expertise. Why bother remembering how toinstall software if your son, close at hand, can do it for you? Since mentalenergy is limited, we concentrate on what we do best. Women tend to be the“experts” in child care, even in modern, dual career families, because theirinitial greater involvement in raising a baby leads them to be relied on morethan the man in storing child care information, and then that initial expertiseleads them to be relied on even more for child care matters, until—oftenunintentionally—the woman shoulders the bulk of the intellectual responsibilityfor the child. “When each person has group acknowledged responsibility forparticular tasks and facts, greater efficiency is inevitable,” Wegner says.“Each domain is handled by the fewest capable of doing so, and responsibilityfor the domains is continuous over time rather than intermittently assigned bycircumstance.”When Jim Buckley says, then, that working at Gore is a “different kind ofexperience,” what he is talking about, in part, is that Gore has a highlyeffective institutional transactive memory. Here, for example, is how one Goreassociate describes the kind of “knowing” that emerges in a small plant: “It’snot just do you know somebody. It’s do you really know them well enough that youknow their skills and abilities and passions. That’s what you like, what you do,what you want to do, what you are truly good at. Not, are you a nice person.”What that associate is talking about is the psychological preconditions fortransactive memory: it’s knowing someone well enough to know what they know, andknowing them well enough so that you can trust them to know things in theirspecialty. It’s the re creation, on an organization wide level, of the kind ofintimacy and trust that exists in a family.Now, of course, if you have a company that is making paper towels or stampingout nuts and bolts, you might not care. Not every company needs this degree ofconnectedness. But in a high technology company like Gore, which relies for itsmarket edge on its ability to innovate and react quickly to demanding andsophisticated customers, this kind of global memory system is critical. It makesthe company incredibly efficient. It means that cooperation is easier. It meansthat you move much faster to get things done or create teams of workers or findout an answer to a problem. It means that people in one part of the company canget access to the impressions and expertise of people in a completely differentpart of the company. At Lucent, the 150 people in manufacturing may have theirown memory network. But how much more effective would the company be if, likeGore, everyone in the plant was part of the same transactive system—if R&D washooked into design and design into manufacturing and manufacturing into sales?“One of the immediate reactions we get when we talk to people is ‘Man, yoursystem sounds chaotic. How in the devil can you do anything with no obviousauthority?’ But it’s not chaos. It isn’t a problem,” Burt Chase said. “It’s hardto appreciate that unless you are working in it. It’s the advantage ofunderstanding people’s strengths. It’s knowing—where can I get my best advice?And if you have some knowledge about people, you can do that.”What Gore has created, in short, is an organized mechanism that makes it fareasier for new ideas and information moving around the organization to tip—to gofrom one person or one part of the group to the entire group all at once. That’sthe advantage of adhering to the Rule of 150. You can exploit the bonds ofmemory and peer pressure. Were Gore to try to reach each employee singly, theirtask would have been much harder, just as Rebecca Wells’s task would have beenmuch harder if her readers came to her readings not in groups of six and sevenbut by themselves. And had Gore tried to put everyone in one big room, itwouldn’t have worked either. In order to be unified—in order to spread aspecific, company ideology to all of its employees—Gore had to break itself upinto semi autonomous small pieces. That is the paradox of the epidemic: that inorder to create one contagious movement, you often have to create many smallmovements first. Rebecca Wells says that what she began to realize as the Ya Yaepidemic grew was that it wasn’t really about her or even about her book: itwasn’t one epidemic focused on one thing. It was thousands of differentepidemics, all focused on the groups that had grown up around Ya Ya. “I began torealize,” she said, “that these women had built their own Ya Ya relationships,not so much to the book but to each other.”"},{"pageContent":"SIX [TippingPoint_toc.html#chap_6]Case StudyRUMORS, SNEAKERS, ANDTHE POWER OF TRANSLATIONAirwalking is the name given to the skateboarding move in which the skater takesoff from a ramp, slips his board out from under his feet, and then takes one ortwo long, exaggerated strides in the air before landing. It is a classic stunt,a staple of traditional skateboarding, which is why when two entrepreneursdecided in the mid 1980s to start manufacturing athletic shoes aimed at hardcore skateboarders, they called the company Airwalk. Airwalk was based outsideSan Diego and rooted in the teenage beach and skate culture of the region. Inthe beginning, the firm made a canvas shoe in wild colors and prints that becamea kind of alternative fashion statement. They also made a technical skate shoein suede, with a thick sole and a heavily cushioned upper that—at least atfirst—was almost as stiff as the skateboard itself. But the skaters became sodevoted to the product that they would wash the shoes over and again, then driveover them in cars to break them in. Airwalk was cool. It sponsored professionalskateboarders, and developed a cult following at the skate events, and after afew years had built up a comfortable $13 million a year business.Companies can continue at that level indefinitely, in a state of low levelequilibrium, serving a small but loyal audience. But the owners of Airwalkwanted more. They wanted to build themselves into an international brand, and inthe early 1990s they changed course. They reorganized their business operations.They redesigned their shoes. They expanded their focus to include not justskateboarding but also surfing, snowboarding, mountain biking, and bicycleracing, sponsoring riders in all of those sports and making Airwalk synonymouswith the active, alternative lifestyle. They embarked on an aggressivegrassroots campaign to meet the buyers for youth oriented shoe stores. Theypersuaded Foot Locker to try them out on an experimental basis. They worked toget alternative rock bands to wear their shoes on stage and, perhaps mostimportant, they decided to hire a small advertising agency named Lambesis torethink their marketing campaign. Under Lambesis’s direction, Airwalk exploded.In 1993, it had been a $16 million company. In 1994, it had sales of $44million. In 1995, sales jumped to $150 million, and the year after that they hit$175 million. At its peak, Airwalk was ranked by one major marketing researchcompany as the thirteenth “coolest” brand among teenagers in the world, and thenumber three footwear brand, behind Nike and Adidas. Somehow, within the spaceof a year or two, Airwalk was jolted out of its quiet equilibrium on the beachesof southern California. In the mid 1990s, Airwalk tipped.The Tipping Point has been concerned so far with defining epidemics andexplaining the principles of epidemic transmission. The experiences of PaulRevere and Sesame Street and crime in New York City and Gore Associates eachillustrate one of the rules of Tipping Points. In everyday life, however, theproblems and situations we face don’t always embody the principles of epidemicsso neatly. In this section of the book, I’d like to look at less straightforwardproblems, and see how the idea of Mavens and Connectors and Stickiness andContext—either singly or in combination—helps to explain them.Why, for example, did Airwalk tip? The short answer is that Lambesis came upwith an inspired advertising campaign. At the start, working with only a smallbudget, the creative director of Lambesis, Chad Farmer, came up with a series ofdramatic images—single photographs showing the Airwalk user relating to hisshoes in some weird way. In one, a young man is wearing an Airwalk shoe on hishead, with the laces hanging down like braids, as his laces are being cut by abarber. In another, a leather clad girl is holding up a shiny vinyl Airwalk shoelike a mirror and using it to apply lipstick. The ads were put on billboards andin “wild postings” on construction site walls and in alternative magazines. AsAirwalk grew, Lambesis went into television. In one of the early Airwalkcommercials, the camera pans across a bedroom floor littered with discardedclothing. It then settles under the bed, as the air is filled with grunting andpuffing and noise of the bedsprings going up and down. Finally the camera comesout from under the bed and we see a young, slightly dazed looking youth, holdingan Airwalk shoe in his hand, jumping up and down on his bed as he triesunsuccessfully to kill a spider on the ceiling. The ads were entirely visual,designed to appeal to youth all over the world. They were rich in detail andvisually arresting. They all featured a truculent, slightly geeky anti hero. Andthey were funny, in a sophisticated way. This was great advertising; in theyears since the first Airwalk ads appeared, the look and feel of that campaignhas been copied again and again by other companies trying to be “cool.” Thestrength of the Lambesis campaign was in more than the look of their work,though. Airwalk tipped because its advertising was founded very explicitly onthe principles of epidemic transmission.1.Perhaps the best way to understand what Lambesis did is to go back to whatsociologists call the diffusion model, which is a detailed, academic way oflooking at how a contagious idea or product or innovation moves through apopulation. One of the most famous diffusion studies is Bruce Ryan and NealGross’s analysis of the spread of hybrid seed corn in Greene County, Iowa, inthe 1930s. The new corn seed was introduced in Iowa in 1928, and it was superiorin every respect to the seed that had been used by farmers for decades before.But it wasn’t adopted all at once. Of the 259 farmers studied by Ryan and Gross,only a handful had started planting the new seed by 1932 and 1933. In 1934, 16took the plunge. In 1935, 21 followed, then 36, and the year after that awhopping 61 and then 46, 36, 14, and 3, until by 1941, all but two of the 259farmers studied were using the new seeds. In the language of diffusion research,the handful of farmers who started trying hybrid seed at the very beginning ofthe 1930s were the Innovators, the adventurous ones. The slightly larger groupwho were infected by them were the Early Adopters. They were the opinion leadersin the community, the respected, thoughtful people who watched and analyzed whatthose wild Innovators were doing and then followed suit. Then came the big bulgeof farmers in 1936, 1937, and 1938, the Early Majority and the Late Majority,the deliberate and the skeptical mass, who would never try anything until themost respected of farmers had tried it first. They caught the seed virus andpassed it on, finally, to the Laggards, the most traditional of all, who see nourgent reason to change. If you plot that progression on a graph, it forms aperfect epidemic curve— starting slowly, tipping just as the Early Adoptersstart using the seed, then rising sharply as the Majority catches on, andfalling away at the end when the Laggards come straggling in.The message here—new seeds—was highly contagious and powerfully sticky. Afarmer, after all, could see with his own eyes, from spring planting to fallharvest, how much better the new seeds were than the old. It’s hard to imaginehow that particular innovation couldn’t have tipped. But in many cases thecontagious spread of a new idea is actually quite tricky.The business consultant Geoffrey Moore, for example, uses the example of hightechnology to argue that there is a substantial difference between the peoplewho originate trends and ideas and the people in the Majority who eventuallytake them up. These two groups may be next to each other on the word of mouthcontinuum. But they don’t communicate particularly well. The first twogroups—the Innovators and Early Adopters—are visionaries. They wantrevolutionary change, something that sets them apart qualitatively from theircompetitors. They are the people who buy brand new technology, before it’s beenperfected or proved or before the price has come down. They have smallcompanies. They are just starting out. They are willing to take enormous risks.The Early Majority, by contrast, are big companies. They have to worry about anychange fitting into their complex arrangement of suppliers and distributors. “Ifthe goal of visionaries is to make a quantum leap forward, the goal ofpragmatists is to make a percentage improvement—incremental, measurable,predictable progress,” Moore writes. “If they are installing a new product, theywant to know how other people have fared with it. The word risk is a negativeword in their vocabulary—it does not connote opportunity or excitement butrather the chance to waste money and time. They will undertake risks whenrequired, but they first will put in place safety nets and manage the risks veryclosely.”Moore’s argument is that the attitude of the Early Adopters and the attitude ofthe Early Majority are fundamentally incompatible. Innovations don’t just slideeffortlessly from one group to the next. There is a chasm between them. Allkinds of high tech products fail, never making it beyond the Early Adopters,because the companies that make them can’t find a way to transform an idea thatmakes perfect sense to an Early Adopter into one that makes perfect sense to amember of the Early Majority.Moore’s book is entirely concerned with high technology. But there’s no questionthat his arguments apply to other kinds of social epidemics as well. In the caseof Hush Puppies, the downtown Manhattan kids who rediscovered the brand werewearing the shoes because Hush Puppies were identified with a dated, kitschy,fifties image. They were wearing them precisely because no one else would wearthem. What they were looking for in fashion was a revolutionary statement. Theywere willing to take risks in order to set themselves apart. But most of us inthe Early and Late Majority don’t want to make a revolutionary statement or takerisks with fashion at all. How did Hush Puppies cross the chasm from one groupto the next? Lambesis was given a shoe that had a very specific appeal to thesouthern California skateboarding subculture. Their task was to make it hip andattractive to teenagers all over the world—even teens who had never skateboardedin their life, who didn’t think skateboarding was particularly cool, and who hadno functional need for wide outsoles that could easily grip the board and paddeduppers to cushion the shocks of doing aerial stunts. That’s clearly not an easytask either. How did they do it? How is it that all the weird, idiosyncraticthings that really cool kids do end up in the mainstream?This is where, I think, Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen play their mostimportant role. In the chapter on the Law of the Few, I talked about how theirspecial social gifts can cause epidemics to tip. Here, though, it is possible tobe much more specific about what they do. They are the ones who make it possiblefor innovations to overcome this problem of the chasm. They are translators:they take ideas and information from a highly specialized world and translatethem into a language the rest of us can understand. Mark Alpert, the Universityof Texas professor whom I described as the Ur Maven, is the kind of person whowould come over to your house and show you how to install or fix or manipulate avery complicated piece of software. Tom Gau, the quintessential Salesman, takesthe very arcane field of tax law and retirement planning and repackages it interms that make emotional sense to his clients. Lois Weisberg, the Connector,belongs to many different worlds—politics, drama, environmentalism, music, law,medicine, and on and on—and one of the key things she does is to play theintermediary between different social worlds. One of the key figures at Lambesiswas DeeDee Gordon, the firm’s former head of market research, and she says thatthe same process occurs in the case of the fashion trends that periodicallysweep through youth culture. The Innovators try something new. Then someone— theteen equivalent of a Maven or a Connector or a Salesman—sees it and adopts it.“Those kids make things more palatable for mainstream people. They see what thereally wired kids are doing and they tweak it. They start doing it themselves,but they change it a bit. They make it more usable. Maybe there’s a kid whorolls up his jeans and puts duct tape around the bottom because he’s the onebike messenger in the school. Well, the translators like that look. But theywon’t use tape. They’ll buy something with Velcro. Or then there was the wholebaby doll T shirt thing. One girl starts wearing a shrunken down T shirt. Shegoes to Toys R Us and buys the Barbie T shirt. And the others say, that’s socool. But they might not get it so small, and they might not get it with Barbieon it. They look at it and say, it’s a little off. But there’s a way I canchange it and make it okay. Then it takes off.”Perhaps the most sophisticated analysis of this process of translation comesfrom the study of rumors, which are—obviously—the most contagious of all socialmessages. In his book The Psychology of Rumor, the sociologist Gordon Allportwrites of a rumor involving a Chinese teacher who was traveling through Maine onvacation in the summer of 1945, shortly before Japan’s surrender to the Alliesat the end of World War II. The teacher was carrying a guidebook, which saidthat a splendid view of the surrounding countryside could be seen from a certainlocal hilltop, and he stopped in a small town to ask directions. From thatinnocent request, a rumor quickly spread: a Japanese spy had gone up the hill totake pictures of the region. “The simple, unadorned facts that constitute the‘kernel of truth’ in this rumor,” Allport writes, “were from the outsetdistorted in...three directions.” First of all the story was leveled. All kindsof details that are essential for understanding the true meaning of the incidentwere left out. There was no mention, Allport points out, of “the courteous andtimid approach of the visitor to the native of whom he inquired his way; thefact that the visitor’s precise nationality was unknown,...the fact that thevisitor had allowed himself to be readily identified by people along the way.”Then the story was sharpened. The details that remained were made more specific.A man became a spy. Someone who looked Asian became Japanese. Sightseeing becameespionage. The guidebook in the teacher’s hand became a camera. Finally, aprocess of assimilation took place: the story was changed so it made more senseto those spreading the rumor. “A Chinese teacher on a holiday was a concept thatcould not arise in the minds of most farmers, for they did not know that someAmerican universities employ Chinese scholars on their staffs and that thesescholars, like other teachers, are entitled to summer holidays,” Allport writes.“The novel situation was perforce assimilated in terms of the most availableframes of reference.” And what were those frames of reference? In 1945, in ruralMaine, at a time when virtually every family had a son or relative involved inthe war effort, the only way to make sense of a story like that was to fit itinto the context of the war. Thus did Asian become Japanese, guidebook becomecamera, and sightseeing become espionage.Psychologists have found that this process of distortion is nearly universal inthe spread of rumors. Memory experiments have been done in which subjects aregiven a story to read or a picture to look at and then asked to return, atintervals of several months, and reproduce what they had been shown. Invariably,significant leveling occurs. All but a few details are dropped. But certaindetails are also, simultaneously, sharpened. In one classic example, subjectswere given a drawing of a hexagon bisected by three lines with seven equal sizecircles superimposed on top of it. What one typical subject remembered, severalmonths later, was a square bisected by two lines with 38 small circles arrayedaround the fringes of the diagram. “There was a marked tendency for any pictureor story to gravitate in memory toward what was familiar to the subject in hisown life, consonant with his own culture, and above all, to what had somespecial emotional significance for him,” Allport writes. “In their effort aftermeaning, the subjects would condense or fill in so as to achieve a better‘Gestalt,’ a better closure—a simpler, more significant configuration.”This is what is meant by translation. What Mavens and Connectors and Salesmen doto an idea in order to make it contagious is to alter it in such a way thatextraneous details are dropped and others are exaggerated so that the messageitself comes to acquire a deeper meaning. If anyone wants to start an epidemic,then—whether it is of shoes or behavior or a piece of software—he or she has tosomehow employ Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen in this very way: he or she hasto find some person or some means to translate the message of the Innovatorsinto something the rest of us can understand.2.There is a wonderful example of this strategy in action in Baltimore, the citywhose problems with drugs and disease I talked about earlier in the book. InBaltimore, as in many communities with a lot of drug addicts, the city sends outa van stocked with thousands of clean syringes to certain street corners in itsinner city neighborhoods at certain times in the week. The idea is that forevery dirty, used needle that addicts hand over, they can get a free cleanneedle in return. In principle, needle exchange sounds like a good way to fightAIDS, since the reuse of old HIV infected needles is responsible for so much ofthe virus’s spread. But, at least on first examination, it seems to have someobvious limitations. Addicts, for one, aren’t the most organized and reliable ofpeople. So what guarantee is there that they are going to be able to regularlymeet up with the needle van? Second, most heroin addicts go through about oneneedle a day, shooting up at least five or six times—if not more—until the tipof the syringe becomes so blunt that it is useless. That’s a lot of needles. Howcan a van, coming by once a week, serve the needs of addicts who are shooting uparound the clock? What if the van comes by on Tuesday, and by Saturday night anaddict has run out?To analyze how well the needle program was working, researchers at Johns HopkinsUniversity began, in the mid 1990s, to ride along with the vans in order to talkto the people handing in needles. What they found surprised them. They hadassumed that addicts brought in their own dirty needles for exchange, that IVdrug users got new needles the way that you or I buy milk: going to the storewhen it is open and picking up enough for the week. But what they found was thata handful of addicts were coming by each week with knapsacks bulging with 300 or400 dirty needles at a time, which is obviously far more than they were usingthemselves. These men were then going back to the street and selling the cleanneedles for one dollar each. The van, in other words, was a kind of syringewholesaler. The real retailers were these handfuls of men—these superexchangers—who were prowling around the streets and shooting galleries, pickingup dirty needles, and then making a modest living on the clean needles theyreceived in exchange. At first, some of the program’s coordinators had secondthoughts. Did they really want taxpayer funded needles financing the habits ofaddicts? But then they realized that they had stumbled inadvertently into asolution to the limitations of needle exchange programs. “It’s a much, muchbetter system,” says Tom Valente, who teaches in the Johns Hopkins School ofPublic Health. “A lot of people shoot on Friday and Saturday night, and theydon’t necessarily think in a rational way that they need to have clean toolsbefore they go out. The needle exchange program isn’t going to be available atthat time—and certainly not in the shooting galleries. But these [superexchangers] can be there at times when people are doing drugs and when they needclean syringes. They provide twenty four seven service, and it doesn’t cost usanything.”One of the researchers who rode with the needle vans was an epidemiologist bythe name of Tom Junge. He would flag down the super exchangers and interviewthem. His conclusion is that they represent a very distinct and special group.“They are all very well connected people,” Junge says. “They know Baltimoreinside and out. They know where to go to get any kind of drug and any kind ofneedle. They have street savvy. I would say that they are unusually sociallyconnected. They have a lot of contacts.... I would have to say the underlyingmotive is financial or economic. But there is definitely an interest in helpingpeople out.”Does this sound familiar? The super exchangers are the Connectors of Baltimore’sdrug world. What people at Johns Hopkins would like to do is use the superexchangers to start a counter–drug epidemic. What if they took those same savvy,socially connected, altruistic people and gave them condoms to hand out, oreducated them in the kinds of health information that drug addicts desperatelyneed to know? Those super exchangers sound as though they have the skills tobridge the chasm between the medical community and the majority of drug users,who are hopelessly isolated from the information and institutions that couldsave their lives. They sound as if they have the ability to translate thelanguage and ideas of health promotion into a form that other addicts couldunderstand.3.Lambesis’s intention was to perform this very same service for Airwalk.Obviously, they couldn’t directly identify the equivalent of Mavens andConnectors and Salesmen to spread the word about Airwalk. They were a tiny adagency trying to put together an international campaign. What they could do,though, was start an epidemic in which their own ad campaign played the role oftranslator, serving as an intermediary between the Innovators and everyone else.If they did their homework right, they realized, they could be the ones to leveland sharpen and assimilate the cutting edge ideas of youth culture and make themacceptable for the Majority. They could play the role of Connector, Maven, andSalesman.The first thing Lambesis did was to develop an in house market research program,aimed at the youth market that Airwalk wanted to conquer. If they were going totranslate Innovator ideas for the mainstream, they first had to find out whatthose Innovator ideas were. To run their research division, Lambesis hiredDeeDee Gordon, who had previously worked for the Converse athletic shoe company.Gordon is a striking woman, with a languid wit, who lives in a right angled,shag rugged, white stuccoed modernist masterpiece in the Hollywood Hills, midwaybetween Madonna’s old house and Aldous Huxley’s old house. Her tastes are almostimpossibly eclectic: depending on the day of the week, she might be obsessedwith an obscure hip hop band, or an old Peter Sellers movie, or a new Japaneseelectronic gadget, or a certain shade of white that she has suddenly,mysteriously, decided is very cool. While she was at Converse Gordon noticedwhite teenage girls in Los Angeles dressing up like Mexican gangsters with thelook they called “the wife beater”—a tight white tank top with the bra strapsshowing—and long shorts and tube socks and shower sandals. “I told them, this isgoing to hit,” Gordon remembers. “There are just too many people wearing it. Wehave to make a shower sandal.” So they cut the back off a Converse sneaker, puta sandal outsole on it, and Converse sold half a million pairs. Gordon has asixth sense of what neighborhoods or bars or clubs to go to in London or Tokyoor Berlin to find out what the latest looks and fashion are. She sometimes comesto New York and sits watching the sidewalks of Soho and the East Village forhours, photographing anything unusual. Gordon is a Maven—a Maven for theelusive, indefinable quality known as cool.At Lambesis, Gordon developed a network of young, savvy correspondents in NewYork and Los Angeles and Chicago and Dallas and Seattle and around the world inplaces like Tokyo and London. These were the kind of people who would have beenwearing Hush Puppies in the East Village in the early 1990s. They all fit aparticular personality type: they were Innovators.“These are kids who are outcasts in some way,” Gordon says. “It doesn’t matterwhether it’s actually true. They feel that way. They always felt like they weredifferent. If you ask kids what worries them, the trendsetter kids pick up onthings like germ warfare, or terrorism. They pick up on bigger picture things,whereas the mainstream kids think about being overweight, or their grandparentsdying, or how well they are doing in school. You see more activists intrendsetters. People with more passion. I’m looking for somebody who is anindividual, who has definitely set herself apart from everybody else, whodoesn’t look like their peers.”Gordon has a kind of relentless curiosity about the world. “I’ve run intotrendsetters who look completely Joe Regular Guy,” she went on. “I can see JoeRegular Guy at a club listening to some totally hard core band playing, and Isay to myself, omigod, what’s that guy doing here, and that totally intriguesme, and I have to walk up to him and say, hey, you’re really into this band.What’s up? You know what I mean? I look at everything. If I see Joe Regular Guysitting in a coffee shop and everyone around him has blue hair, I’m going togravitate toward him because, hey, what’s Joe Regular Guy doing in a coffee shopwith people with blue hair?”With her stable of Innovator correspondents in place, Gordon would then go backto them two or three or four times a year, asking them what music they werelistening to, what television shows they were watching, what clothes they werebuying, or what their goals and aspirations were. The data were not alwayscoherent. They required interpretation. Different ideas would pop up indifferent parts of the country, then sometimes move east to west or sometimeswest to east. But by looking at the big picture, by comparing the data fromAustin to Seattle and Seattle to Los Angeles and Los Angeles to New York, andwatching it change from one month to the next, Gordon was able to develop apicture of the rise and movement of new trends across the country. And bycomparing what her Innovators were saying and doing with what mainstream kidswere saying and doing three months or six months or a year later, she was ableto track what sorts of ideas were able to make the jump from the coolsubcultures to the Majority.“Take the whole men wearing makeup, the Kurt Cobain, androgynous thing,” Gordonsaid. “You know how he used to paint his fingernails with Magic Marker? We sawthat in the Northwest first, then trickling through Los Angeles and New York andAustin because they have a hip music scene. Then it trickled into other parts ofthe country. That took a long time to go mainstream.”Gordon’s findings became the template for the Airwalk campaign. If she found newtrends or ideas or concepts that were catching fire among Innovators around thecountry, the firm would plant those same concepts in the Airwalk ads they werecreating. Once, for example, Gordon picked up on the fact that trendsetters weredeveloping a sudden interest in Tibet and the Dalai Lama. The influential rapband Beastie Boys were very publicly putting money into the Free Tibet campaign,and were bringing monks on stage at their concerts to give testimonials. “TheBeastie Boys pushed that through and made it okay,” Gordon remembers. SoLambesis made a very funny Airwalk ad with a young Airwalk wearing monk sittingat a desk in a classroom writing a test. He’s looking down at his feet becausehe’s written cheat notes on the side of his shoes. (When a billboard version ofthe ad was put up in San Francisco, Lambesis was forced to take it down, afterTibetan monks protested that monks don’t touch their feet, let alone cheat ontests.) When James Bond started popping up on the trendsetter radar, Lambesishired the director of the James Bond movies to film a series of commercials, allof which featured Airwalk clad characters making wild escapes from facelessvillains. When trendsetters started to show an ironic interest in country clubculture, and began wearing old Fred Perry and Izod golf shirts, Airwalk made ashoe out of tennis ball material and Lambesis made a print ad of the shoe beingthrown up in the air and hit with a tennis racket. “One time we noticed that thefuture technology thing was really big,” Gordon says. “You’d ask some kid whatthey would invent, if they could invent anything they wanted, and it was alwaysabout effortless living. You know, put your head in a bubble, push a button, andit comes out perfect. So we got Airwalk to do these rounded, bubbly outsoles forthe shoes. We started mixing materials—meshes and breathable materials andspecial types of Gore Tex and laying them on top of each other.” To look throughthe inventory of Airwalk ads in that critical period, in fact, is to get acomplete guide to the fads and infatuations and interests of the youth cultureof the era: there are 30 second spoofs of kung fu movies, a TV spot on Beatpoetry, an X-files–style commercial in which a young man driving into Roswell,New Mexico, has his Airwalks confiscated by aliens.There are two explanations for why this strategy was so successful. The first isobvious. Lambesis was picking on various, very contagious, trends while theywere still in their infancy. By the time their new ad campaign and the shoes togo along with it were ready, that trend (with luck) would just be hitting themainstream. Lambesis, in other words, was piggy backing on social epidemics,associating Airwalk with each new trend wave that swept through youth culture.“It’s all about timing,” Gordon says. “You follow the trendsetters. You see whatthey are doing. It takes a year to produce those shoes. By the time the yeargoes, if your trend is the right trend, it’s going to hit those mainstreampeople at the right time. So if you see future technology as a trend—if you seeenough trendsetters in enough cities buying things that are ergonomic in design,or shoes that are jacked up, or little Palm Pilots, and when you ask them toinvent something, they’re all talking about flying cars of the future—that’sgoing to lead you to believe that within six months to a year everyone and hisgrandmother will be into the same thing.”Lambesis wasn’t just a passive observer in this process, however. It is also thecase that their ads helped to tip the ideas they were discovering amongInnovators. Gordon says, for example, that when something fails to make it outof the trendsetter community into the mainstream, it’s usually because the ideadoesn’t root itself broadly enough in the culture: “There aren’t enough cues.You didn’t see it in music and film and art and fashion. Usually, if something’sgoing to make it, you’ll see that thread running throughout everything—throughwhat they like on TV, what they want to invent, what they want to listen to,even the materials they want to wear. It’s everywhere. But if something doesn’tmake it, you’ll only see it in one of those areas.” Lambesis was taking certainideas, and planting them everywhere. And as they planted them, they providedthat critical translation. Gordon’s research showed that Innovator kids wereheavily into the Dalai Lama and all of the very serious issues raised by theoccupation of Tibet. So Lambesis took one very simple reference to that—aTibetan monk—and put him in a funny, slightly cheeky situation. They tweaked it.The Innovators had a heavily ironic interest in country club culture. Lambesislightened that. They made the shoe into a tennis ball, and that made thereference less arch and more funny. Innovators were into kung fu movies. SoLambesis made a kung fu parody ad in which the Airwalk hero fights off martialarts villains with his skateboard. Lambesis took the kung fu motif and merged itwith youth culture. In the case of the Chinese scholar’s vacation, according toAllport, the facts of the situation didn’t make sense to the people of thetown;so they came up with an interpretation that did make sense—that the scholarwas a spy—and, to make that new interpretation work, “discordant details wereleveled out, incidents were sharpened to fit the chosen theme, and the episodeas a whole was assimilated to the preexisting structure of feeling and thoughtcharacteristic of the members of the group among whom the rumor spread.” That’sjust what Lambesis did. They took the cultural cues from the Innovators—cuesthat the mainstream kids may have seen but not been able to make sense of—andleveled, sharpened, and assimilated them into a more coherent form. They gavethose cues a specific meaning that they did not have previously and packagedthat new sensibility in the form of a pair of shoes. It can hardly be a surprisethat the Airwalk rumor spread so quickly in 1995 and 1996.4.The Airwalk epidemic did not last. In 1997, the company’s sales began to falter.The firm had production problems and difficulty filling their orders. Incritical locations, Airwalk failed to supply enough product for the back toschool season, and its once loyal distributors began to turn against it. At thesame time, the company began to lose that cutting edge sensibility that it hadtraded on for so long. “When Airwalk started, the product was directional andinventive. The shoes were very forward,” said Chad Farmer. “We maintained thetrendsetter focus on the marketing. But the product began to slip. The companybegan to listen more and more to the sales staff and the product started to getthat homogenized, mainstream look. Everybody loved the marketing. In focusgroups that we do, they still talk about how they miss it. But the number onecomplaint is, what happened to the cool product?” Lambesis’s strategy was basedon translating Innovator shoes for the Majority. But suddenly Airwalk wasn’t anInnovator shoe anymore. “We made another, critical mistake,” Lee Smith, theformer president of Airwalk says. “We had a segmentation strategy, where thesmall, independent core skate shops—the three hundred boutiques around thecountry who really created us—had a certain product line that was exclusive tothem. They didn’t want us to be in the mall. So what we did was, we segmentedour product. We said to the core shops, you don’t have to compete with themalls. It worked out very well.” The boutiques were given the technical shoes:different designs, better materials, more padding, different cushioning systems,different rubber compounds, more expensive uppers. “We had a special signaturemodel—the Tony Hawk—for skateboarding, which was a lot beefier and more durable.It would retail for about eighty dollars.” The shoes Airwalk distributed toKinney’s or Champ’s or Foot Locker, meanwhile, were less elaborate and wouldretail for about $60. The Innovators always got to wear a different, moreexclusive shoe than everyone else. The mainstream customer had the satisfactionof wearing the same brand as the cool kids.But then, at the height of its success, Airwalk switched strategies. The companystopped giving the specialty shops their own shoes. “That’s when thetrendsetters started to get a disregard for the brand,” says Farmer. “Theystarted to go to their boutiques where they got their cool stuff, and theyrealized that everyone else could get the very same shoes at J C Penney.” Now,all of a sudden, Lambesis was translating the language of mainstream productsfor the mainstream. The epidemic was over.“My category manager once asked me what happened,” Smith says, “and I told him,you ever see Forrest Gump? Stupid is as stupid does. Well, cool is as cool does.Cool brands treat people well, and we didn’t. I had personally promised some ofthose little shops that we would give them special product, then we changed ourminds. That was the beginning. In that world, it all works on word of mouth.When we became bigger, that’s when we should have paid more attention to thedetails and kept a good buzz going, so when people said you guys are sellouts,you guys went mainstream, you suck, we could have said, you know what, we don’t.We had this little jewel of a brand, and little by little we sold that off intothe mainstream, and once we had sold it all”—he paused—“so what? You buy a pairof our shoes. Why would you ever buy another?”"},{"pageContent":"SEVEN [TippingPoint_toc.html#chap_7]Case StudySUICIDE, SMOKING,AND THE SEARCH FORTHE UNSTICKY CIGARETTENot long ago, on the South Pacific islands of Micronesia, a seventeen year oldboy named Sima got into an argument with his father. He was staying with hisfamily at his grandfather’s house when his father—a stern and demandingman—ordered him out of bed early one morning and told him to find a bamboo poleknife to harvest breadfruit. Sima spent hours in the village, looking withoutsuccess for a pole knife, and when he returned empty handed, his father wasfurious. The family would now go hungry, he told his son, waving a machete inrage. “Get out of here and go find somewhere else to live.”Sima left his grandfather’s house and walked back to his home village. Along theway he ran into his fourteen year old brother and borrowed a pen. Two hourslater, curious about where Sima had gone, his brother went looking for him. Hereturned to the now empty family house and peered in the window. In the middleof a dark room, hanging slack and still from a noose, was Sima. He was dead. Hissuicide note read:My life is coming to an end at this time. Now today is a day of sorrow formyself, also a day of suffering for me. But it is a day of celebration for Papa.Today Papa sent me away. Thank you for loving me so little. Sima.Give my farewell to Mama. Mama you won’t have any more frustration or troublefrom your boy. Much love from Sima.In the early 1960s, suicide on the islands of Micronesia was almost unknown. Butfor reasons no one quite understands, it then began to rise, steeply anddramatically, by leaps and bounds every year, until by the end of the 1980sthere were more suicides per capita in Micronesia than anywhere else in theworld. For males between fifteen and twenty four, the suicide rate in the UnitedStates is about 22 per 100,000. In the islands of Micronesia the rate is about160 per 100,000—more than seven times higher. At that level, suicide is almostcommonplace, triggered by the smallest of incidents. Sima took his own lifebecause his father yelled at him. In the midst of the Micronesian epidemic, thatwas hardly unusual. Teens committed suicide on the islands because they sawtheir girlfriends with another boy, or because their parents refused to givethem a few extra dollars for beer. One nineteen year old hanged himself becausehis parents didn’t buy him a graduation gown. One seventeen year old hangedhimself because he had been rebuked by his older brother for making too muchnoise. What, in Western cultures, is something rare, random, and deeplypathological, has become in Micronesia a ritual of adolescence, with its ownparticular rules and symbols. Virtually all suicides on the islands, in fact,are identical variations on Sima’s story. The victim is almost always male. Heis in his late teens, unmarried, and living at home. The precipitating event isinvariably domestic: a dispute with girlfriends or parents. In three quarters ofthe cases, the victim had never tried—or even threatened—suicide before. Thesuicide notes tend to express not depression but a kind of wounded pride andself pity, a protest against mistreatment. The act itself typically occurs on aweekend night, usually after a bout of drinking with friends. In all but a fewcases, the victim observes the same procedure, as if there were a strict,unwritten protocol about the correct way to take one’s own life. He finds aremote spot or empty house. He takes a rope and makes a noose, but he does notsuspend himself, as in a typical Western hanging. He ties the noose to a lowbranch or a window or a doorknob and leans forward, so that the weight of hisbody draws the noose tightly around his neck, cutting off the flow of blood tothe brain. Unconsciousness follows. Death results from anoxia—the shortage ofblood to the brain.In Micronesia, the anthropologist Donald Rubinstein writes, these rituals havebecome embedded in the local culture. As the number of suicides have grown, theidea has fed upon itself, infecting younger and younger boys, and transformingthe act itself so that the unthinkable has somehow been rendered thinkable.According to Rubinstein, who has documented the Micronesian epidemic in a seriesof brilliant papers,Suicide ideation among adolescents appears widespread in certain Micronesiancommunities and is popularly expressed in recent songs composed locally andaired on Micronesian radio stations, and in graffiti adorning T shirts and highschool walls. A number of young boys who attempted suicide reported that theyfirst saw or heard about it when they were 8 or 10 years old. Their suicideattempts appear in the spirit of imitative or experimental play. One 11 year oldboy, for example, hanged himself inside his house and when found he was alreadyunconscious and his tongue protruding. He later explained that he wanted to“try” out hanging. He said that he did not want to die, although he knew he wasrisking death. Such cases of imitative suicide attempts by boys as young as fiveand six have been reported recently from Truk. Several cases of young adolescentsuicide deaths recently in Micronesia were evidently the outcome of suchexperiments. Thus as suicide grows more frequent in these communities the ideaitself acquires a certain familiarity if not fascination to young men, and thelethality of the act seems to be trivialized. Especially among some youngerboys, the suicide acts appear to have acquired an experimental almostrecreational element.There is something very chilling about this passage. Suicide isn’t supposed tobe trivialized like this. But the truly chilling thing about it is how familiarit all seems. Here we have a contagious epidemic of self destruction, engaged inby youth in the spirit of experimentation, imitation, and rebellion. Here wehave a mindless action that somehow, among teenagers, has become an importantform of self expression. In a strange way, the Micronesian teen suicide epidemicsounds an awful lot like the epidemic of teenage smoking in the West.1.Teenage smoking is one of the great, baffling phenomena of modern life. No onereally knows how to fight it, or even, for that matter, what it is. Theprincipal assumption of the anti smoking movement has been that tobaccocompanies persuade teens to smoke by lying to them, by making smoking sound alot more desirable and a lot less harmful than it really is. To address thatproblem, then, we’ve restricted and policed cigarette advertising, so it’s a lotharder for tobacco companies to lie. We’ve raised the price of cigarettes andenforced the law against selling tobacco to minors, to try to make it muchharder for teens to buy cigarettes. And we’ve run extensive public healthcampaigns on television and radio and in magazines to try to educate teens aboutthe dangers of smoking.It has become fairly obvious, however, that this approach isn’t very effective.Why do we think, for example, that the key to fighting smoking is educatingpeople about the risks of cigarettes? Harvard University economist W. KipViscusi recently asked a group of smokers to guess how many years of life, onaverage, smoking from the age of twenty one onward would cost them. They guessednine years. The real answer is somewhere around six or seven. Smokers aren’tsmokers because they underestimate the risks of smoking. They smoke even thoughthey overestimate the risk of smoking. At the same time, it is not clear howeffective it is to have adults tell teenagers that they shouldn’t smoke. As anyparent of a teenage child will tell you, the essential contrariness ofadolescents suggests that the more adults inveigh against smoking and lectureteenagers about its dangers, the more teens, paradoxically, will want to try it.Sure enough, if you look at smoking trends over the past decade or so, that isexactly what has happened. The anti smoking movement has never been louder ormore prominent. Yet all signs suggest that among the young the anti smokingmessage is backfiring. Between 1993 and 1997, the number of college students whosmoke jumped from 22.3 percent to 28.5 percent. Between 1991 and 1997, thenumber of high school students who smoke jumped 32 percent. Since 1988, in fact,the total number of teen smokers in the United States has risen an extraordinary73 percent. There are few public health programs in recent years that havefallen as short of their mission as the war on smoking.The lesson here is not that we should give up trying to fight cigarettes. Thepoint is simply that the way we have tended to think about the causes of smokingdoesn’t make a lot of sense. That’s why the epidemic of suicide in Micronesia isso interesting and potentially relevant to the smoking problem. It gives usanother way of trying to come to terms with youth smoking. What if smoking,instead of following the rational principles of the marketplace, follows thesame kind of mysterious and complex social rules and rituals that govern teensuicide? If smoking really is an epidemic like Micronesian suicide, how doesthat change the way we ought to fight the problem?2.The central observation of those who study suicide is that, in some places andunder some circumstances, the act of one person taking his or her own life canbe contagious. Suicides lead to suicides. The pioneer in this field is DavidPhillips, a sociologist at the University of California at San Diego, who hasconducted a number of studies on suicide, each more fascinating and seeminglyimprobable than the last. He began by making a list of all the stories aboutsuicide that ran on the front page of the country’s most prominent newspapers inthe twenty year stretch between the end of the 1940s and the end of the 1960s.Then he matched them up with suicide statistics from the same period. He wantedto know whether there was any relationship between the two. Sure enough, therewas. Immediately after stories about suicides appeared, suicides in the areaserved by the newspaper jumped. In the case of national stories, the rate jumpednationally. (Marilyn Monroe’s death was followed by a temporary 12 percentincrease in the national suicide rate.) Then Phillips repeated his experimentwith traffic accidents. He took front page suicide stories from the Los AngelesTimes and the San Francisco Chronicle and matched them up with trafficfatalities from the state of California. He found the same pattern. On the dayafter a highly publicized suicide, the number of fatalities from trafficaccidents was, on average, 5.9 percent higher than expected. Two days after asuicide story, traffic deaths rose 4.1 percent. Three days after, they rose 3.1percent, and four days after, they rose 8.1 percent. (After ten days, thetraffic fatality rate was back to normal.) Phillips concluded that one of theways in which people commit suicide is by deliberately crashing their cars, andthat these people were just as susceptible to the contagious effects of a highlypublicized suicide as were people killing themselves by more conventional means.The kind of contagion Phillips is talking about isn’t something rational or evennecessarily conscious. It’s not like a persuasive argument. It’s something muchmore subtle than that. “When I’m waiting at a traffic light and the light isred, sometimes I wonder whether I should cross and jaywalk,” he says. “Thensomebody else does it and so I do too. It’s a kind of imitation. I’m gettingpermission to act from someone else who is engaging in a deviant act. Is that aconscious decision? I can’t tell. Maybe afterwards I could brood on thedifference. But at the time I don’t know whether any of us knows how much of ourdecision is conscious and how much is unconscious. Human decisions are subtleand complicated and not very well understood.” In the case of suicide, Phillipsargues, the decision by someone famous to take his or her own life has the sameeffect: it gives other people, particularly those vulnerable to suggestionbecause of immaturity or mental illness, permission to engage in a deviant actas well. “Suicide stories are a kind of natural advertisement for a particularresponse to your problems,” Phillips continues. “You’ve got all these people whoare unhappy and have difficulty making up their minds because they aredepressed. They are living with this pain. There are lots of stories advertisingdifferent kinds of responses to that. It could be that Billy Graham has acrusade going on that weekend—that’s a religious response. Or it could be thatsomebody is advertising an escapist movie—that’s another response. Suicidestories offer another kind of alternative.” Phillips’s permission givers are thefunctional equivalent of the Salesmen I talked about in chapter 2. Just as TomGau could, through the persuasive force of his personality, serve as a TippingPoint in a word of mouth epidemic, the people who die in highly publicizedsuicides—whose deaths give others “permission” to die—serve as the TippingPoints in suicide epidemics.The fascinating thing about this permission giving, though, is howextraordinarily specific it is. In his study of motor fatalities, Phillips founda clear pattern. Stories about suicides resulted in an increase in single carcrashes where the victim was the driver. Stories about suicide murders resultedin an increase in multiple car crashes in which the victims included bothdrivers and passengers. Stories about young people committing suicide resultedin more traffic fatalities involving young people. Stories about older peoplecommitting suicide resulted in more traffic fatalities involving older people.These patterns have been demonstrated on many occasions. News coverage of anumber of suicides by self immolation in England in the late 1970s, for example,prompted 82 suicides by self immolation over the next year. The “permission”given by an initial act of suicide, in other words, isn’t a general invitationto the vulnerable. It is really a highly detailed set of instructions, specificto certain people in certain situations who choose to die in certain ways. It’snot a gesture. It’s speech. In another study, a group of researchers in Englandin the 1960s analyzed 135 people who had been admitted to a central psychiatrichospital after attempting suicide. They found that the group was strongly linkedsocially—that many of them belonged to the same social circles. This, theyconcluded, was not coincidence. It testified to the very essence of what suicideis, a private language between members of a common subculture. The author’sconclusion is worth quoting in full:Many patients who attempt suicide are drawn from a section of the community inwhich self aggression is generally recognized as a means of conveying a certainkind of information. Among this group the act is viewed as comprehensible andconsistent with the rest of the cultural pattern.... If this is true, it followsthat the individual who in particular situations, usually of distress, wishes toconvey information about his difficulties to others, does not have to invent acommunicational medium de novo.... The individual within the “attempted suicidesubculture” can perform an act which carries a preformed meaning; all he isrequired to do is invoke it. The process is essentially similar to that wherebya person uses a word in a spoken language.This is what is going on in Micronesia, only at a much more profound level. Ifsuicide in the West is a kind of crude language, in Micronesia it has become anincredibly expressive form of communication, rich with meaning and nuance, andexpressed by the most persuasive of permission givers. Rubinstein writes of thestrange pattern of suicides on the Micronesian island of Ebeye, a community ofabout 6,000. Between 1955 and 1965, there wasn’t a single case of suicide on theentire island. In May 1966, an eighteen year old boy hanged himself in his jailcell after being arrested for stealing a bicycle, but his case seemed to havelittle impact. Then, in November of 1966, came the death of R., the charismaticscion of one of the island’s wealthiest families. R. had been seeing two womenand had fathered a one month old child with each of them. Unable to make up hismind between them, he hanged himself in romantic despair. At his funeral, histwo lovers, learning of the existence of the other for the first time, faintedon his grave.Three days after R.’s death, there was another suicide, a twenty two year oldmale suffering from marital difficulties, bringing the suicide toll to two overa week in a community that had seen one suicide in the previous twelve years.The island’s medic wrote: “After R. died, many boys dreamed about him and saidthat he was calling them to kill themselves.” Twenty five more suicides followedover the next twelve years, mostly in clusters of three or four over the courseof a few weeks. “Several suicide victims and several who have recently attemptedsuicide reported having a vision in which a boat containing all the past victimscircles the island with the deceased inviting the potential victims to jointhem,” a visiting anthropologist wrote in 1975. Over and over again, the themesoutlined by R. resurfaced. Here is the suicide note of M., a high school studentwho had one girlfriend at boarding school and one girlfriend on Ebeye, and whenthe first girlfriend returned home from school, two girlfriends at once—acomplication defined, in the youth subculture of Ebeye, as grounds for takingone’s own life: “Best wishes to M. and C. [the two girlfriends]. It’s been niceto be with both of you.” That’s all he had to say, because the context for hisact had already been created by R. In the Ebeye epidemic, R. was the TippingPerson, the Salesman, the one whose experience “overwrote” the experience ofthose who followed him. The power of his personality and the circumstances ofhis death combined to make the force of his example endure years beyond hisdeath.3.Does teen smoking follow this same logic? In order to find out more about thereasons teenagers smoke, I gave several hundred people a questionnaire, askingthem to describe their earliest experiences with cigarettes. This was not ascientific study. The sample wasn’t representative of the United States. It wasmostly people in their late twenties and early thirties, living in big cities.Nonetheless the answers were striking, principally because of how similar theyall seemed. Smoking seemed to evoke a particular kind of childhood memory—vivid,precise, emotionally charged. One person remembers how she loved to open hergrandmother’s purse, where she would encounter “the soft smell of cheap Winstonsand leather mixed with drug store lipstick and cinnamon gum.” Another remembers“sitting in the back seat of a Chrysler sedan, smelling the wonderful mixture ofsulfur and tobacco waft out the driver’s window and into my nostrils.” Smoking,overwhelmingly, was associated with the same thing to nearly everyone:sophistication. This was true even of people who now hate smoking, who now thinkof it as a dirty and dangerous habit. The language of smoking, like the languageof suicide, seems incredibly consistent. Here are two responses, both describingchildhood memories:My mother smoked, and even though I hated it—hated the smell—she had these longtapered fingers and full, sort of crinkly lips, always with lipstick on, andwhen she smoked she looked so elegant and devil may care that there was noquestion that I’d smoke someday. She thought people who didn’t smoke were kindof gutless. Makes you stink, makes you think, she would say, reveling in howugly that sounded.My best friend Susan was Irish English. Her parents were, in contrast to mine,youthful, indulgent, liberal. They had cocktails before dinner. Mr. O’Sullivanhad a beard and wore turtlenecks. Mrs. O’Sullivan tottered around in mules,dressed slimly in black to match her jet black hair. She wore heavy eye makeupand was a little too tan and always, virtually always, had a dangerously longcigarette holder dangling from her manicured hands.This is the shared language of smoking, and it is as rich and expressive as theshared language of suicide. In this epidemic, as well, there are also TippingPeople, Salesmen, permission givers. Time and time again, the respondents to mysurvey described the particular individual who initiated them into smoking inprecisely the same way.When I was around nine or ten my parents got an English au pair girl, Maggie,who came and stayed with us one summer. She was maybe twenty. She was very sexyand wore a bikini at the Campbells’ pool. She was famous with the grownup menfor doing handstands in her bikini. Also it was said her bikini top fell offwhen she dove—Mr. Carpenter would submerge whenever she jumped in. Maggiesmoked, and I used to beg her to let me smoke too.The first kid I knew who smoked was Billy G. We became friends in fifth grade,when the major distinctions in our suburban N.J. town—jocks, heads, brains—werebeginning to form. Billy was incredibly cool. He was the first kid to dategirls, smoke cigarettes and pot, drink hard alcohol and listen to druggy music.I even remember sitting upstairs in his sister’s bedroom—his parents weredivorced (another first), and his mom was never home—separating the seeds out ofsome pot on the cover of a Grateful Dead album.... The draw for me was thebadness of it, and the adult ness, and the way it proved the idea that you couldbe more than one thing at once.The first person who I remember smoking was a girl named Pam P. I met her whenwe were both in the 10th grade. We rode the school bus together in Great Neck,L.I., and I remember thinking she was the coolest because she lived in anapartment. (Great Neck didn’t have many apartments.) Pam seemed so much olderthan her 15 years. We used to sit in the back of the bus and blow smoke out thewindow. She taught me how to inhale, how to tie a man tailored shirt at thewaist to look cool, and how to wear lipstick. She had a leather jacket. Herfather was rarely home.There is actually considerable support for this idea that there is a commonpersonality to hard core smokers. Hans Eysenck, the influential Britishpsychologist, has argued that serious smokers can be separated from nonsmokersalong very simple personality lines. The quin tessential hard core smoker,according to Eysenck, is an extrovert, the kind of person whois sociable, likes parties, has many friends, needs to have people to talkto.... He craves excitement, takes chances, acts on the spur of the moment andis generally an impulsive individual.... He prefers to keep moving and doingthings, tends to be aggressive and loses his temper quickly; his feelings arenot kept under tight control and he is not always a reliable person.In countless studies since Eysenck’s groundbreaking work, this picture of thesmoking “type” has been filled out. Heavy smokers have been shown to have a muchgreater sex drive than nonsmokers. They are more sexually precocious; they havea greater “need” for sex, and greater attraction to the opposite sex. At agenineteen, for example, 15 percent of nonsmoking white women attending collegehave had sex. The same number for white female college students who do smoke is55 percent. The statistics for men are about the same according to Eysenck. Theyrank much higher on what psychologists call “anti social” indexes: they tend tohave greater levels of misconduct, and be more rebellious and defiant. They makesnap judgments. They take more risks. The average smoking household spends 73percent more on coffee and two to three times as much on beer as the averagenonsmoking household. Interestingly, smokers also seem to be more honest aboutthemselves than nonsmokers. As David Krogh describes it in his treatise Smoking:The Artificial Passion, psychologists have what they call “lie” tests in whichthey insert inarguable statements—“I do not always tell the truth” or “I amsometimes cold to my spouse”—and if test takers consistently deny thesestatements, it is taken as evidence that they are not generally truthful.Smokers are much more truthful on these tests. “One theory,” Krogh writes, “hasit that their lack of deference and their surfeit of defiance combine to makethem relatively indifferent to what people think of them.”These measures don’t apply to all smokers, of course. But as general predictorsof smoking behavior they are quite accurate, and the more someone smokes, thehigher the likelihood that he or she fits this profile. “In the scientificspirit,” Krogh writes, “I would invite readers to demonstrate [the smokingpersonality connection] to themselves by performing the following experiment.Arrange to go to a relaxed gathering of actors, rock musicians, or hairdresserson the one hand, or civil engineers, electricians, or computer programmers onthe other, and observe how much smoking is going on. If your experience isanything like mine, the differences should be dramatic.”Here is another of the responses to my questionnaire. Can the extrovertedpersonality be any clearer?My grandfather was the only person around me when I was very little who smoked.He was a great Runyonesque figure, a trickster hero, who immigrated from Polandwhen he was a boy and who worked most of his life as a glazier. My mother usedto like to say that when she was first brought to dinner with him she thought hemight at any moment whisk the tablecloth off the table, leaving the settingsthere, just to amuse the crowd.The significance of the smoking personality, I think, cannot be overstated. Ifyou bundle all of these extroverts’ traits together—defiance, sexual precocity,honesty, impulsiveness, indifference to the opinion of others, sensationseeking—you come up with an almost perfect definition of the kind of person manyadolescents are drawn to. Maggie the au pair, and Pam P. on the school bus andBilly G. with his Grateful Dead records were all deeply cool people. But theyweren’t cool because they smoked. They smoked because they were cool. The verysame character traits of rebelliousness and impulsivity and risk taking andindifference to the opinion of others and precocity that made them so compellingto their adolescent peers also make it almost inevitable that they would also bedrawn to the ultimate expression of adolescent rebellion, risk taking,impulsivity, indifference to others, and precocity: the cigarette. This may seemlike a simple point. But it is absolutely essential in understanding why the waron smoking has stumbled so badly. Over the past decade, the anti smokingmovement has railed against the tobacco companies for making smoking cool andhas spent untold millions of dollars of public money trying to convinceteenagers that smoking isn’t cool. But that’s not the point. Smoking was nevercool. Smokers are cool. Smoking epidemics begin in precisely the same way thatthe suicide epidemic in Micronesia began or word of mouth epidemics begin or theAIDS epidemic began, because of the extraordinary influence of Pam P. and BillyG. and Maggie and their equivalents—the smoking versions of R. and Tom Gau and Gaetan Dugas. In thisepidemic, as in all others, a very small group—a select few—are responsible fordriving the epidemic forward.4.The teen smoking epidemic does not simply illustrate the Law of the Few,however. It is also a very good illustration of the Stickiness Factor. Afterall, the fact that overwhelming numbers of teenagers experiment with cigarettesas a result of their contacts with other teenagers is not, in and of itself, allthat scary. The problem—the fact that has turned smoking into public healthenemy number one—is that many of those teenagers end up continuing theircigarette experiment until they get hooked. The smoking experience is somemorable and powerful for some people that they cannot stop smoking. The habitsticks.It is important to keep these two concepts—contagiousness andstickiness—separate, because they follow very different patterns and suggestvery different strategies. Lois Weisberg is a contagious person. She knows somany people and belongs to so many worlds that she is able to spread a piece ofinformation or an idea a thousand different ways, all at once. Lester Wundermanand the creators of Blue’s Clues, on the other hand, are specialists instickiness: they have a genius for creating messages that are memorable and thatchange people’s behavior. Contagiousness is in larger part a function of themessenger. Stickiness is primarily a property of the message.Smoking is no different. Whether a teenager picks up the habit depends onwhether he or she has contact with one of those Salesmen who give teenagers“permission” to engage in deviant acts. But whether a teenager likes cigarettesenough to keep using them depends on a very different set of criteria. In arecent University of Michigan study, for example, a large group of people werepolled about how they felt when they smoked their first cigarette. “What wefound is that for almost everyone their initial experience with tobacco wassomewhat aversive,” said Ovide Pomerleau, one of the researchers on the project.“But what sorted out the smokers to be from the never again smokers is that thesmokers to be derived some overall pleasure from the experience—like the feelingof a buzz or a heady pleasurable feeling.” The numbers are striking. Of thepeople who experimented with cigarettes a few times and then never smoked again,only about a quarter got any sort of pleasant “high” from their first cigarette.Of the ex smokers—people who smoked for a while but later managed to quit—abouta third got a pleasurable buzz. Of people who were light smokers, about halfremembered their first cigarette well. Of the heavy smokers, though, 78 percentremembered getting a good buzz from their first few puffs. The questions of howsticky smoking ends up being to any single person, in other words, depends agreat deal on his or her own particular initial reaction to nicotine.This is a critical point, and one that is often lost in the heated rhetoric ofthe war on smoking. The tobacco industry, for instance, has been pilloried foryears for denying that nicotine is addictive. That position, of course, isridiculous. But the opposite notion often put forth by anti smokingadvocates—that nicotine is a deadly taskmaster that enslaves all who come incontact with it—is equally ridiculous. Of all the teenagers who experiment withcigarettes, only about a third ever go on to smoke regularly. Nicotine may behighly addictive, but it is only addictive in some people, some of the time.More important, it turns out that even among those who smoke regularly, thereare enormous differences in the stickiness of their habit. Smoking experts usedto think that 90 to 95 percent of all those who smoked were regular smokers. Butseveral years ago, the smoking questions on the federal government’s nationalhealth survey were made more specific, and researchers discovered, to theirastonishment, that a fifth of all smokers don’t smoke every day. There aremillions of Americans, in other words, who manage to smoke regularly and not behooked—people for whom smoking is contagious but not sticky. In the past fewyears, these “chippers”—as they have been dubbed—have been exhaustively studied,with the bulk of the work being done by University of Pittsburgh psychologistSaul Shiffman. Shiffman’s definition of a chipper is someone who smokes no morethan five cigarettes a day but who smokes at least four days a week. As Shiffmanwrites:Chippers’ smoking varies considerably from day to day, and their smokingpatterns often include days of complete abstinence. Chippers reported littledifficulty maintaining such casual abstinence and reportedly experienced almostno withdrawal symptoms when abstaining from smoking.... Unlike regular smokerswho smoke soon on waking to replenish the nicotine that has cleared overnight,chippers go several hours before smoking their first cigarette of the day. Inshort, every indicator examined suggests that chippers are not addicted tonicotine and that their smoking is not driven by withdrawal relief or withdrawalavoidance.Shiffman calls chippers the equivalent of social drinkers. They are people incontrol of their habit. He says:Most of these people had never been heavy smokers. I think of them asdevelopmentally retarded. Every smoker starts out as a chipper, in the earlyperiod, but then graduates more heavily into more dependent smoking. When wecollected data about the early period of smoking, the chippers look likeeveryone else when they start out. The difference is that over time, the heavysmokers escalated whereas the chippers stayed where they were.What distinguishes chippers from hard core smokers? Probably genetic factors.Allan Collins of the University of Colorado, for example, recently took severalgroups of different strains of mice and injected each with steadily increasingamounts of nicotine. When nicotine reaches toxic levels in a mouse (nicotine is,after all, a poison) it has a seizure—its tail goes rigid; it begins runningwildly around its cage; its head starts to jerk and snap; and eventually itflips over on its back. Collins wanted to see whether different strains of micecould handle different amounts of nicotine. Sure enough, they could. The strainof mice most tolerant of nicotine could handle about two to three times as muchof the drug as the strain that had seizures at the lowest dose. “That’s about inthe same range as alcohol,” Collins says. Then he put all the mice into cagesand gave them two bottles to drink from: one filled with a simple saccharinsolution, one filled with a saccharin solution laced with nicotine. This time hewanted to see whether there was any relationship between each strain’s genetictolerance to nicotine and the amount of nicotine they would voluntarily consume.Once again, there was. In fact, the correlation was almost perfect. The greatera mouse’s genetic tolerance for nicotine, the more of the nicotine bottle itwould drink. Collins thinks that there are genes in the brains of mice thatgovern how nicotine is processed—how quickly it causes toxicity, how muchpleasure it gives, what kind of buzz it leaves—and that some strains of micehave genes that handle nicotine really well and extract the most pleasure fromit and some have genes that treat nicotine like a poison.Humans, obviously, aren’t mice, and drinking nicotine from a bottle in a cageisn’t the same as lighting up a Marlboro. But even if there is only a modestcorrelation between what goes on in mice brains and ours, these findings do seemto square with Pomerleau’s study. The people who didn’t get a buzz from theirfirst cigarette and who found the whole experience so awful that they neversmoked again are probably people whose bodies are acutely sensitive to nicotine,incapable of handling it in even the smallest doses. Chippers may be people whohave the genes to derive pleasure from nicotine, but not the genes to handle itin large doses. Heavy smokers, meanwhile, may be people with the genes to doboth. This is not to say that genes provide a total explanation for how muchpeople smoke. Since nicotine is known to relieve boredom and stress, forexample, people who are in boring or stressful situations are always going tosmoke more than people who are not. It is simply to say that what makes smokingsticky is completely different from the kinds of things that make it contagious.If we are looking for Tipping Points in the war on smoking, then, we need todecide which of those sides of the epidemic we will have the most successattacking. Should we try to make smoking less contagious, to stop the Salesmenwho spread the smoking virus? Or are we better off trying to make it lesssticky, to look for ways to turn all smokers into chippers?5.Let’s deal with the issue of contagion first. There are two possible strategiesfor stopping the spread of smoking. The first is to prevent the permissiongivers—the Maggies and Billy G.’s—from smoking in the first place. This isclearly the most difficult path of all: the most independent, precocious,rebellious teens are hardly likely to be the most susceptible to rational healthadvice. The second possibility is to convince all those who look to people likeMaggie and Billy G. for permission that they should look elsewhere, to get theircues as to what is cool, in this instance, from adults.But this too is not easy. In fact, it may well be an even more difficultstrategy than the first, for the simple reason that parents simply don’t wieldthat kind of influence over children.This is a hard fact to believe, of course. Parents are powerfully invested inthe idea that they can shape their children’s personalities and behavior. But,as Judith Harris brilliantly argued in her 1998 book The Nurture Assumption, theevidence for this belief is sorely lacking. Consider, for example, the resultsof efforts undertaken by psychologists over the years to try and measure thisvery question—the effect parents have on their children. Obviously, they pass ongenes to their offspring, and genes play a big role in who we are. Parentsprovide love and affection in the early years of childhood; deprived of earlyemotional sustenance, children will be irreparably harmed. Parents provide foodand a home and protection and the basics of everyday life that children need tobe safe and healthy and happy. This much is easy. But does it make a lastingdifference to the personality of your child if you are an anxious andinexperienced parent, as opposed to being authoritative and competent? Are youmore likely to create intellectually curious children by filling your house withbooks? Does it affect your child’s personality if you see him or her two hours aday, as opposed to eight hours a day? In other words, does the specific socialenvironment that we create in our homes make a real difference in the way ourchildren end up as adults? In a series of large and well designed studies oftwins—particularly twins separated at birth and reared apart—geneticists haveshown that most of the character traits that make us who we are—friendliness,extroversion, nervousness, openness, and so on—are about half determined by ourgenes and half determined by our environment, and the assumption has always beenthat this environment that makes such a big difference in our lives is theenvironment of the home. The problem is, however, that whenever psychologistshave set out to look for this nurture effect, they can’t find it.One of the largest and most rigorous studies of this kind, for example, is knownas the Colorado Adoption Project. In the mid 1970s, a group of researchers atthe University of Colorado led by Robert Plomin, one of the world’s leadingbehavioral geneticists, recruited 245 pregnant women from the Denver area whowere about to give up their children for adoption. They then followed thechildren into their new homes, giving them a battery of personality andintelligence tests at regular intervals throughout their childhood and givingthe same sets of tests to their adoptive parents. For the sake of comparison,the group also ran the same set of tests on a similar group of 245 parents andtheir biological children. For this comparison group, the results came outpretty much as one might expect. On things like measures of intellectual abilityand certain aspects of personality, the biological children are fairly similarto their parents. For the adopted kids, however, the results are downrightstrange. Their scores have nothing whatsoever in common with their adoptiveparents: these children are no more similar in their personality or intellectualskills to the people who raised them, fed them, clothed them, read to them,taught them, and loved them for sixteen years than they are to any two adultstaken at random off the street.This is, if you think about it, a rather extraordinary finding. Most of usbelieve that we are like our parents because of some combination of genes and,more important, of nurture—that parents, to a large extent, raise us in theirown image. But if that is the case, if nurture matters so much, then why did theadopted kids not resemble their adoptive parents at all? The Colorado studyisn’t saying that genes explain everything and that environment doesn’t matter.On the contrary, all of the results strongly suggest that our environment playsas big—if not bigger—a role as heredity in shaping personality and intelligence.What it is saying is that whatever that environmental influence is, it doesn’thave a lot to do with parents. It’s something else, and what Judith Harrisargues is that that something else is the influence of peers.Why, Harris asks, do the children of recent immigrants almost never retain theaccent of their parents? How is it the children of deaf parents manage to learnhow to speak as well and as quickly as children whose parents speak to them fromthe day they were born? The answer has always been that language is a skillacquired laterally—that what children pick up from other children is as, ormore, important in the acquisition of language as what they pick up at home.What Harris argues is that this is also true more generally, that theenvironmental influence that helps children become who they are—that shapestheir character and personality—is their peer group.This argument has, understandably, sparked a great deal of controversy in thepopular press. There are legitimate arguments about where—and how far—it can beapplied. But there’s no question that it has a great deal of relevance to theteenage smoking issue. The children of smokers are more than twice as likely tosmoke as the children of nonsmokers. That’s a well known fact. But—to followHarris’s logic—that does not mean that parents who smoke around their childrenset an example that their kids follow. It simply means that smokers’ childrenhave inherited genes from their parents that predispose them toward nicotineaddiction. Indeed studies of adopted children have shown that those raised bysmokers are no more likely to end up as smokers themselves than those raised bynonsmokers. “In other words, effects of rearing variation (e.g. parents’lighting up or not, or having cigarettes in the home or not) were essentiallynil by the time the children reached adulthood,” the psychologist David Rowewrites in his 1994 book summarizing research on the question, The Limits ofFamily Influence. “The role of parents is a passive one—providing a set of genesat loci relevant to smoking risk, but not socially influencing their offspring.”To Rowe and Harris, the process by which teens get infected with the smokinghabit is entirely bound up in the peer group. It’s not about mimicking adultbehavior, which is why teenage smoking is rising at a time when adult smoking isfalling. Teenage smoking is about being a teenager, about sharing in theemotional experience and expressive language and rituals of adolescence, whichare as impenetrable and irrational to outsiders as the rituals of adolescentsuicide in Micronesia. How, under the circumstances, can we expect any adultintervention to make an impact?“Telling teenagers about the health risks of smoking—It will make you wrinkled!It will make you impotent! It will make you dead!—is useless,” Harris concludes.“This is adult propaganda; these are adult arguments. It is because adults don’tapprove of smoking—because there is something dangerous and disreputable aboutit—that teenagers want to do it.”6.If trying to thwart the efforts of Salesmen—if trying to intervene in theinternal world of adolescents—doesn’t seem like a particularly effectivestrategy against smoking, then what of stickiness? Here the search for TippingPoints is very different. We suspect, as I wrote previously, that one of thereasons some experimenters never smoke again and some turn into lifelong addictsis that human beings may have very different innate tolerances for nicotine. Ina perfect world we would give heavy smokers a pill that lowered their toleranceto the level of, say, a chipper. That would be a wonderful way of strippingsmoking of its stickiness. Unfortunately we don’t know how to do that. What wedo have is the nicotine patch, which delivers a slow and steady dose of nicotineso that smokers don’t have to turn to the dangers of cigarettes to get theirfix. That’s an anti sticky strategy that has helped millions of smokers. But itis fairly clear that the patch is far from perfect. The most exhilarating wayfor an addict to get his fix is in the form of a “hit”—a high dose deliveredquickly, that overwhelms the senses. Heroin users don’t put themselves on aheroin intravenous drip: they shoot up two or three or four times a day,injecting a huge dose all at once. Smokers, on a lesser scale, do the same. Theyget a jolt from a cigarette, then pause, then get another jolt. The patch,though, gives you a steady dose of the drug over the course of the day, which isa pretty boring way to ingest nicotine. The patch seems no more a Tipping Pointin the fight against the smoking epidemic than SlimFast milkshakes are a TippingPoint in the fight against obesity. Is there a better candidate?I think there are two possibilities. The first can be found in the correlationbetween smoking and depression, a link discovered only recently. In 1986, astudy of psychiatric outpatients in Minnesota found that half of them smoked, afigure well above the national average. Two years later, Columbia Universitypsychologist Alexander Glassman discovered that 60 percent of the heavy smokershe was studying as part of an entirely different research project had a historyof major depression. He followed that up with a major study published in theJournal of the American Medical Association in 1990 of 3,200 randomly selectedadults. Of those who had at some time in their lives been diagnosed with a majorpsychiatric disorder, 74 percent had smoked at some point, and 14 percent hadquit smoking. Of those who had never been diagnosed with a psychiatric problem,53 percent had smoked at some point in their life and 31 percent had managed toquit smoking. As psychiatric problems increase, the correlation with smokinggrows stronger. About 80 percent of alcoholics smoke. Close to 90 percent ofschizophrenics smoke. In one particularly chilling study, a group of Britishpsychiatrists compared the smoking behavior of a group of twelve to fifteen yearolds with emotional and behavioral problems with a group of children of the sameage in mainstream schools. Half of the troubled kids were already smoking morethan 21 cigarettes a week, even at that young age, versus 10 percent of the kidsin the mainstream schools. As overall smoking rates decline, in other words, thehabit is becoming concentrated among the most troubled and marginal members ofsociety.There are a number of theories as to why smoking matches up so strongly withemotional problems. The first is that the same kinds of things that would makesomeone susceptible to the contagious effects of smoking—low self esteem, say,or an unhealthy and unhappy home life—are also the kinds of things thatcontribute to depression. More tantalizing, though, is some preliminary evidencethat the two problems might have the same genetic root. For example, depressionis believed to be the result, at least in part, of a problem in the productionof certain key brain chemicals, in particular the neurotransmitters known asserotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. These are the chemicals that regulatemood, that contribute to feelings of confidence and mastery and pleasure. Drugslike Zoloft and Prozac work because they prompt the brain to produce moreserotonin: they compensate, in other words, for the deficit of serotonin thatsome depressed people suffer from. Nicotine appears to do exactly the same thingwith the other two key neurotransmitters—dopamine and norepinephrine. Thosesmokers who are depressed, in short, are essentially using tobacco as a cheapway of treating their own depression, of boosting the level of brain chemicalsthey need to function normally. This effect is strong enough that when smokerswith a history of psychiatric problems give up cigarettes, they run a sizablerisk of relapsing into depression. Here is stickiness with a vengeance: not onlydo some smokers find it hard to quit because they are addicted to nicotine, butalso because without nicotine they run the risk of a debilitating psychiatricillness.This is a sobering fact. But it also suggests that tobacco may have a criticalvulnerability: if you can treat smokers for depression, you may be able to maketheir habit an awful lot easier to break. Sure enough, this turns out to be thecase. In the mid 1980s, researchers at what is now the Glaxo Wellcomepharmaceutical firm were doing a big national trial of a new antidepressantcalled bupropion when, much to their surprise, they began getting reports aboutsmoking from the field. “I started hearing that patients were saying thingslike, ‘I no longer have the desire to smoke,’ or ‘I’ve cut down on the number ofcigarettes I’m smoking,’ or ‘Cigarettes don’t taste as good anymore,’” saidAndrew Johnston, who heads the psychiatry division for the company. “You canimagine that someone in my position gets reports about everything, so I didn’tput much stock in them. But I kept getting them. It was very unusual.” This wasin 1986, before the depression smoking link was well understood, so the companywas initially puzzled. But what they soon realized was that bupropion wasfunctioning as a kind of nicotine substitute. “The dopamine that nicotinereleases goes to the prefrontal cortex of the brain,” explains Johnston. “That’sthe pleasure center of the brain. It’s what people believe is responsible forthe pleasure, the sense of well being, associated with smoking, and that’s oneof the reasons it’s so hard to quit. Nicotine also increases norepinephrine, andthat’s the reason that when you try to quit smoking and you no longer get somuch norepinephrine, you get agitation and irritability. Bupropion does twothings. It increases your dopamine, so smokers don’t have the desire to smoke,then it replaces some of the norepinephrine, so they don’t have the agitation,the withdrawal symptoms.”Glaxo Wellcome has tested the drug—now marketed under the name Zyban—in heavilyaddicted smokers (more than 15 cigarettes a day) and found remarkable effects.In the study, 23 percent of smokers given a course of anti smoking counselingand a placebo quit after four weeks. Of those given counseling and the nicotinepatch, 36 percent had quit after four weeks. The same figure for Zyban, though,was 49 percent, and of those heavily addicted smokers given both Zyban and thepatch, 58 percent had quit after a month. Interestingly, Zoloft and Prozac—theserotonin drugs—don’t seem to help smokers to quit. It’s not enough to liftmood, in other words; you have to lift mood in precisely the same way thatnicotine does, and only Zyban does that. This is not to say that it is a perfectdrug. As with all smoking cessation aids, it has the least success with theheaviest smokers. But what the drug’s initial success has proven is that it ispossible to find a sticky Tipping Point with smoking: that by zeroing in ondepression, you can exploit a critical vulnerability in the addiction process.There is a second potential Tipping Point on the stickiness question thatbecomes apparent if you go back and look again at what happens to teens whenthey start smoking. In the beginning, when teens first experiment withcigarettes, they are all chippers. They smoke only occasionally. Most of thoseteens soon quit and never smoke again. A few continue to chip for many yearsafterward, without becoming addicted. About a third end up as regular smokers.What’s interesting about this period, however, is that it takes about threeyears for the teens in that last group to go from casual to regularsmoking—roughly from fifteen to eighteen years of age—and then for the next fiveto seven years there is a gradual escalation of their habit. “When someone inhigh school is smoking on a regular basis, he or she isn’t smoking a pack aday,” Neal Benowitz, an addiction expert at the University of California at SanFrancisco, says. “It takes until their twenties to get to that level.”Nicotine addiction, then, is far from an instant development. It takes time formost people to get hooked on cigarettes, and just because teens are smoking atfifteen doesn’t mean that they will inevitably become addicted. You’ve got aboutthree years to stop them. The second, even more intriguing implication of this,is that nicotine addiction isn’t a linear phenomenon. It’s not that if you needone cigarette a day you are a little bit addicted, and if you need twocigarettes a day you are a little bit more addicted, and if you need tencigarettes you are ten times as addicted as when you needed one cigarette. Itsuggests, instead, that there is an addiction Tipping Point, a threshold—that ifyou smoke below a certain number of cigarettes you aren’t addicted at all, butonce you go above that magic number you suddenly are. This is another, morecomplete way of making sense of chippers: they are people who simply never smokeenough to hit that addiction threshold. A hardened smoker, on the other hand, issomeone who, at some point, crosses that line.What is the addiction threshold? Well, no one believes that it is exactly thesame for all people. But Benowitz and Jack Henningfield—who are probably theleading nicotine experts in the world—have made some educated guesses. Chippers,they point out, are people who are capable of smoking up to five cigarettes aday without getting addicted. That suggests that the amount of nicotine found infive cigarettes—which works out to somewhere between four and six milligrams ofnicotine—is probably somewhere close to the addiction threshold. WhatHenningfield and Benowitz suggest, then, is that tobacco companies be requiredto lower the level of nicotine so that even the heaviest smokers—those smoking,say, 30 cigarettes a day—could not get anything more than five milligrams ofnicotine within a 24 hour period. That level, the two argued in an editorial inthe prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, “should be adequate to preventor limit the development of addiction in most young people. At the same time itmay provide enough nicotine for taste and sensory stimulation.” Teens, in otherwords, would continue to experiment with cigarettes for all the reasons thatthey have ever experimented with cigarettes—because the habit is contagious,because cool kids are smoking, because they want to fit in. But, because of thereduction of nicotine levels below the addiction threshold, the habit would nolonger be sticky. Cigarette smoking would be less like the flu and more like thecommon cold: easily caught but easily defeated.It is important to put these two stickiness factors in perspective. The antismoking movement has focused, so far, on raising cigarette prices, curtailingcigarette advertising, running public health messages on radio and television,limiting access of cigarettes to minors, and drilling anti tobacco messages intoschoolchildren, and in the period that this broad, seemingly comprehensive,ambitious campaign has been waged, teenage smoking has skyrocketed. We’ve beenobsessed with changing attitudes toward tobacco on a mass scale, but we haven’tmanaged to reach the groups whose attitude needs to change the most. We’ve beenobsessed with foiling the influence of smoking Salesmen. But the influence ofthose Salesmen increasingly looks like something we cannot break. We have, inshort, somehow become convinced that we need to tackle the whole problem, all atonce. But the truth is that we don’t. We only need to find the stickinessTipping Points, and those are the links to depression and the nicotinethreshold.The second lesson of the stickiness strategy is that it permits a morereasonable approach to teenage experimentation. The absolutist approach tofighting drugs proceeds on the premise that experimentation equals addiction. Wedon’t want our children ever to be exposed to heroin or pot or cocaine becausewe think that the lure of these substances is so strong that even the smallestexposure will be all it takes. But do you know what the experimentationstatistics are for illegal drugs? In the 1996 Household Survey on Drug Abuse,1.1 percent of those polled said that they had used heroin at least once. Butonly 18 percent of that 1.1 percent had used it in the past year, and only 9percent had used it in the past month. That is not the profile of a particularlysticky drug. The figures for cocaine are even more striking. Of those who haveever tried cocaine, less than one percent—0.9 percent—are regular users. Whatthese figures tell us is that experimentation and actual hard core use are twoentirely separate things—that for a drug to be contagious does not automaticallymean that it is also sticky. In fact, the sheer number of people who appear tohave tried cocaine at least once should tell us that the urge among teens to trysomething dangerous is pretty nearly universal. This is what teens do. This ishow they learn about the world, and most of the time—in 99.1 percent of thecases with cocaine—that experimentation doesn’t result in anything badhappening. We have to stop fighting this kind of experimentation. We have toaccept it and even to embrace it. Teens are always going to be fascinated bypeople like Maggie the au pair and Billy G. and Pam P., and they should befascinated by people like that, if only to get past the adolescent fantasy thatto be rebellious and truculent and irresponsible is a good way to spend yourlife. What we should be doing instead of fighting experimentation is making surethat experimentation doesn’t have serious consequences.I think it is worth repeating something from the beginning of this chapter, aquote from Donald Rubinstein describing just how deeply embedded suicide hadbecome in the teen culture of Micronesia.A number of young boys who attempted suicide reported that they first saw orheard about it when they were 8 or 10 years old. Their suicide attempts appearin the spirit of imitative or experimental play. One 11 year old boy, forexample, hanged himself inside his house and when found he was alreadyunconscious and his tongue protruding. He later explained that he wanted to“try” out hanging. He said that he did not want to die.What is tragic about this is not that these little boys were experimenting.Experimenting is what little boys do. What is tragic is that they have chosen toexperiment with something that you cannot experiment with. Unfortunately, thereisn’t ever going to be a safer form of suicide, to help save the teenagers ofMicronesia. But there can be a safer form of smoking, and by paying attention tothe Tipping Points of the addiction process we can make that safer, less stickyform of smoking possible."},{"pageContent":"EIGHT [TippingPoint_toc.html#chap_8]ConclusionFOCUS, TEST, AND BELIEVENot long ago a nurse by the name of Georgia Sadler began a campaign to increaseknowledge and awareness of diabetes and breast cancer in the black community ofSan Diego. She wanted to create a grassroots movement toward prevention, and soshe began setting up seminars in black churches around the city. The results,however, were disappointing. “There’d be maybe two hundred people in church, butwe’d get only twenty or so to stay, and the people who were staying were peoplewho already knew a lot about those diseases and just wanted to know more. It wasvery discouraging.” Sadler couldn’t get her message to tip outside of that smallgroup.She realized she needed a new context. “I guess people were tired and hungryafter the service,” she says. “We all have a busy life. People wanted to gethome.” She needed a place where women were relaxed, receptive to new ideas, andhad the time and opportunity to hear something new. She also needed a newmessenger, someone who was a little bit Connector, a little bit Salesman, and alittle bit Maven. She needed a new, stickier way of presenting the information.And she needed to make all those changes in such a way that she didn’t exceedthe very small amount of money she’d cobbled together from various foundationsand funding groups. Her solution? Move the campaign from black churches tobeauty salons.“It’s a captive audience,” Sadler says. “These women may be at a salon foranywhere from two hours to eight hours, if they’re having their hair braided.”The stylist also enjoys a special relationship with her client. “Once you findsomeone who can manage your hair, you’ll drive a hundred miles to see her. Thestylist is your friend. She takes you through your high school graduation, yourwedding, your first baby. It’s a long term relationship. It’s a trustingrelationship. You literally and figuratively let your hair down in a salon.”There is something about the profession of stylist, as well, that seems toattract a certain kind of person—someone who communicates easily and well withothers, someone with a wide variety of acquaintances. “They’re naturalconversationalists,” Sadler says. “They love talking to you. They tend to bevery intuitive, because they have to keep an eye on you and see how you’redoing.”She gathered together a group of stylists from the city for a series of trainingsessions. She brought in a folklorist to help coach the stylists in how topresent their information about breast cancer in a compelling manner. “We wantedto rely on traditional methods of communication,” Sadler says. “This isn’t aclassroom setting. We wanted this to be something that women wanted to share,that they wanted to pass on. And how much easier is it to hang the hooks ofknowledge on a story?” Sadler kept a constant cycle of new information andgossipy tidbits and conversational starters about breast cancer flowing into thesalons, so that each time a client came back, the stylist could seize on somenew cue to start a conversation. She wrote the material up in large print, andput it on laminated sheets that would survive the rough and tumble of a busyhair salon. She set up an evaluation program to find out what was working and tosee how successful she was in changing attitudes and getting women to havemammograms and diabetes tests, and what she found out was that her programworked. It is possible to do a lot with a little.Over the course of The Tipping Point we’ve looked at a number of stories likethis—from the battle against crime in New York to Lester Wunderman’s ColumbiaRecord Club treasure hunt—and what they all have in common is their modesty.Sadler didn’t go to the National Cancer Institute or the California StateDepartment of Health and ask for millions of dollars to run some elaborate,multimedia public awareness campaign. She didn’t go door to door through theneighborhoods of San Diego, signing women up for free mammograms. She didn’tbombard the airwaves with a persistent call for prevention and testing. Insteadshe took the small budget that she had and thought about how to use it moreintelligently. She changed the context of her message. She changed themessenger, and she changed the message itself. She focused her efforts.This is the first lesson of the Tipping Point. Starting epidemics requiresconcentrating resources on a few key areas. The Law of the Few says thatConnectors, Mavens, and Salesmen are responsible for starting word of mouthepidemics, which means that if you are interested in starting a word of mouthepidemic, your resources ought to be solely concentrated on those three groups.No one else matters. Telling William Dawes that the British were coming didnothing for the colonists of New England. But telling Paul Revere ultimatelymeant the difference between defeat and victory. The creators of Blue’s Cluesdeveloped a sophisticated, half hour television show that children loved. Butthey realized that there was no way that children could remember and learneverything they needed to remember and learn from a single viewing. So they didwhat no one had ever done in television before. They ran the same show fivetimes in a row. Sadler didn’t try to reach every woman in San Diego all at once.She took what resources she had and put them all into one critical place—thebeauty salon.A critic looking at these tightly focused, targeted interventions might dismissthem as Band Aid solutions. But that phrase should not be considered a term ofdisparagement. The Band Aid is an inexpensive, convenient, and remarkablyversatile solution to an astonishing array of problems. In their history, BandAids have probably allowed millions of people to keep working or playing tennisor cooking or walking when they would otherwise have had to stop. The Band Aidsolution is actually the best kind of solution because it involves solving aproblem with the minimum amount of effort and time and cost. We have, of course,an instinctive disdain for this kind of solution because there is something inall of us that feels that true answers to problems have to be comprehensive,that there is virtue in the dogged and indiscriminate application of effort,that slow and steady should win the race. The problem, of course, is that theindiscriminate application of effort is something that is not always possible.There are times when we need a convenient shortcut, a way to make a lot out of alittle, and that is what Tipping Points, in the end, are all about.The theory of Tipping Points requires, however, that we reframe the way we thinkabout the world. I have spent a lot of time, in this book, talking about theidiosyncrasies of the way we relate to new information and to each other. Wehave trouble estimating dramatic, exponential change. We cannot conceive that apiece of paper folded over 50 times could reach the sun. There are abrupt limitsto the number of cognitive categories we can make and the number of people wecan truly love and the number of acquaintances we can truly know. We throw upour hands at a problem phrased in an abstract way, but have no difficulty at allsolving the same problem rephrased as a social dilemma. All of these things areexpressions of the peculiarities of the human mind and heart, a refutation ofthe notion that the way we function and communicate and process information isstraightforward and transparent. It is not. It is messy and opaque. SesameStreet and Blue’s Clues succeed, in large part, because of things they do thatare not obvious. Who would have known, beforehand, that Big Bird had to be onthe same set as the adult characters? Or who could have predicted that goingfrom 100 to 150 workers in a plant isn’t a problem, but going from 150 to 200 isa huge problem? In the phone book names test that I gave, I’m not sure anyonewould have predicted that the high scores would have been over 100 and the lowscores under 10. We think people are different, but not that different.The world—much as we want it to—does not accord with our intuition. This is thesecond lesson of the Tipping Point. Those who are successful at creating socialepidemics do not just do what they think is right. They deliberately test theirintuitions. Without the evidence of the Distracter, which told them that theirintuition about fantasy and reality was wrong, Sesame Street would today be aforgotten footnote in television history. Lester Wunderman’s gold box soundedlike a silly idea until he proved how much more effective it was thanconventional advertising. That no one responded to Kitty Genovese’s screamssounded like an open and shut case of human indifference, until carefulpsychological testing demonstrated the powerful influence of context. To makesense of social epidemics, we must first understand that human communication hasits own set of very unusual and counterintuitive rules.What must underlie successful epidemics, in the end, is a bedrock belief thatchange is possible, that people can radically transform their behavior orbeliefs in the face of the right kind of impetus. This, too, contradicts some ofthe most ingrained assumptions we hold about ourselves and each other. We liketo think of ourselves as autonomous and inner directed, that who we are and howwe act is something permanently set by our genes and our temperament. But if youadd up the examples of Salesmen and Connectors, of Paul Revere’s ride and Blue’sClues, and the Rule of 150 and the New York subway cleanup and the FundamentalAttribution Error, they amount to a very different conclusion about what itmeans to be human. We are actually powerfully influenced by our surroundings,our immediate context, and the personalities of those around us. Taking thegraffiti off the walls of New York’s subways turned New Yorkers into bettercitizens. Telling seminarians to hurry turned them into bad citizens. Thesuicide of a charismatic young Micronesian set off an epidemic of suicides thatlasted for a decade. Putting a little gold box in the corner of a ColumbiaRecord Club advertisement suddenly made record buying by mail seem irresistible.To look closely at complex behaviors like smoking or suicide or crime is toappreciate how suggestible we are in the face of what we see and hear, and howacutely sensitive we are to even the smallest details of everyday life. That’swhy social change is so volatile and so often inexplicable, because it is thenature of all of us to be volatile and inexplicable.But if there is difficulty and volatility in the world of the Tipping Point,there is a large measure of hopefulness as well. Merely by manipulating the sizeof a group, we can dramatically improve its receptivity to new ideas. Bytinkering with the presentation of information, we can significantly improve itsstickiness. Simply by finding and reaching those few special people who hold somuch social power, we can shape the course of social epidemics. In the end,Tipping Points are a reaffirmation of the potential for change and the power ofintelligent action. Look at the world around you. It may seem like an immovable,implacable place. It is not. With the slightest push—in just the right place—itcan be tipped."},{"pageContent":"AFTERWORD [TippingPoint_toc.html#afte_1]Tipping Point Lessonsfrom the Real WorldNot long after The Tipping Point came out, I happened to talk to anepidemiologist, a man who had spent the better part of his professional lifebattling the AIDS epidemic. He was a thoughtful fellow, and frustrated in theway that you can imagine someone would be who has had to deal, on a daily basis,with such a terrible disease. We were sitting in a café talking about my book,which he had read, and then he said something startling. “I wonder if we wouldhave been better off if we had never discovered the AIDS virus at all?” I don’tthink he meant that literally, or that he regretted the countless lives thathave been saved or prolonged by anti HIV drugs and the AIDS test. What he meantwas this: that the AIDS epidemic is fundamentally a social phenomenon. Itspreads because of the beliefs and social structures and poverty and prejudicesand personalities of a community, and sometimes getting caught up in the precisebiological characteristics of a virus merely serves as a distraction; we mighthave halted the spread of AIDS far more effectively just by focusing on thosebeliefs and social structures and poverty and prejudices and personalities. Andwhen he said that, a lightbulb went on inside my head: that’s what I was tryingto say in The Tipping Point!A book, I was taught long ago in English class, is a living and breathingdocument that grows richer with each new reading. But I never quite believedthat until I wrote The Tipping Point. I wrote my book without any clearexpectation of who would read it, or what, if anything, it would be useful for.It seemed presumptuous to think otherwise. But in the year since itspublication, I have been inundated with the comments of readers. I have receivedthousands of e-mails through my Web site (www.gladwell.com). I have spoken atconferences and retreats and sales meetings and chatted with Internetentrepreneurs and shoe designers and community activists and movie executivesand countless others — and each time I have learned something new about my book,and about why it seems to have touched such a chord.In New Jersey, the philanthropist Sharon Karmazin bought three hundred copies ofThe Tipping Point and sent one to every public library in the state, promisingto fund any ideas they could come up with that were inspired by my book. “Usethe thinking in the book to create something new,” Karmazin told librarians.“Don’t just give us something you wanted to do anyway.” Within a few months,“Tipping Point” grants totaling close to $100,000 had been given out to twentyone different libraries. In Roselle, the public library is on a side street,hidden away behind shrubbery, and so the library got a grant to put up signsaround town to direct people to the library. Another library used its grant toteach the Connectors among the group of seniors who use the library to surf theNet — betting they will draw in other patrons. Still another library boughtSpanish language books and materials, hoping to create a draw for an underservedcommunity in their town. None of the grants was more than a few thousanddollars, nor were the ideas themselves more than modest — but that was thepoint.In California, Ken Futernick, a professor of education at California StateUniversity at Sacramento, says he was inspired by The Tipping Point to come upwith an idea for attracting teachers to troubled schools. “There is aninteresting stalemate,” Futernick told me. “Good principals say, ‘I can’t go offto a hard school unless I have good teachers,’ and good teachers say, ‘I won’tgo off to a hard school unless there is a good principal.’ There have been a lotof efforts, like forgivable loans, that thrash around and don’t ever goanywhere.” In some schools in low income parts of Oakland where Futernick hasbeen focusing his efforts, he says that 40 percent of the teachers may lackcredentials, working only on an “emergency” two year basis. “I ask teachers,‘What would it take for you to go to one of these schools, in a very low incomearea, lots of single parents, not a safe part of town?’” He went on. “Salaryincentives? They say maybe. Lower class size? They say yeah, maybe. All thethings I listed were sort of attractive, but I didn’t get the sense that any oneof them would be enough to get people to take the assignment.” It would be easyto conclude, from all of that, that teachers are undedicated and selfish, notwilling to work in those places where they are most needed. But what wouldhappen, Futernick wondered, if he changed the context of the request? His newidea, which he hopes to put in place over the next year in Oakland, is forprincipals to be recruited for difficult schools and then given a year to puttogether a team of qualified teachers drawn from good schools for their newassignment — a team that would go into the new school together. On playingfields and battlegrounds, challenges that would be daunting and impossible iffaced alone are suddenly possible when tackled in a close knit group. The peoplehaven’t changed, but the way in which the task appears to them has. Futernickthinks the same principle ought to hold true in the classroom, that teacherswould be willing to take on a daunting assignment if they felt they weresurrounded by other experienced, high quality teachers. That’s a lesson from TheTipping Point that I never thought could have application in the inner city ofOakland.One of the things that motivated me to write The Tipping Point was the mysteryof word of mouth — a phenomenon that everyone seemed to agree was important butno one seemed to know how to define. It is on this subject that readers havetalked to me the most over the last year, and on which I have thought the mostas well. What is now obvious to me — but was not at the time I wrote The TippingPoint — is that we are about to enter the age of word of mouth, and that,paradoxically, all of the sophistication and wizardry and limitless access toinformation of the New Economy is going to lead us to rely more and more on veryprimitive kinds of social contacts. Relying on the Connectors, Mavens, andSalesmen in our life is the way we deal with the complexity of the modern world.This is a function of many different factors and changes in our society, ofwhich I’d like to talk about three: the rise of isolation, particularly amongadolescents; the rise of immunity in communication; and the particularlycritical role of the Maven in the modern economy.Understanding the Age of IsolationAt 9:20 A.M., on March 5, 2001, fifteen year old Andy Williams opened fire witha .22 caliber long barrel revolver from the bathroom of his high school inSantee, California. He fired thirty rounds over six minutes, first into thebathroom itself, and then into an adjoining courtyard, killing two students andhitting thirteen other people. He was a skinny, jug eared freshman, new to town,with a silver necklace reading MOUSE, and afterward, as always seems to happenin these cases, his friends and teachers said they could not believe thatsomeone so quiet and mild mannered could have committed such an act of violence.I wrote, in The Tipping Point, about adolescent epidemics, and I used as a casestudy the epidemic of teenage suicide that raged for many years on the islandsof Micronesia. I could not find a more dramatic example of the proclivity ofteenagers to get caught up in mindless and highly contagious rituals of selfdestruction. The Micronesian epidemic started with a single high profile suicide— a love triangle involving a charismatic high born youth and a dramatic sceneat a funeral — and soon other boys were committing suicide in precisely the sameway, and for reasons that seemed preposterously trivial. I thought that therecent rise in teen smoking, in the West, was our form of this kind of epidemic.But in truth the analogy was inexact. In Micronesia, teens were doing somethingentirely unique to their own culture. They were not mimicking an adult practiceor reacting to something the adult world was imposing on them. They were simplyfollowing the internal rules of their culture, as if they were entirely blind towhat adults said and did. Teen smoking, by contrast, is quite different. It’s anadult practice that is cool among teens precisely because of its adult roots.And teens smoke, in part, in reaction to what adults preach to them about theevils of smoking. The first is an epidemic in isolation. The second is anepidemic in reaction. I thought we couldn’t have the first kind of epidemicamong western teens. I was wrong. We now have the school shooting epidemic.The school massacre at Columbine High in Littleton, Colorado, happened on April20, 1999. In the twenty two months that followed, there were nineteen separateincidents of school violence across the United States — ten of them foiled,fortunately, before anyone got hurt — each patterned, almost eerily, on theColumbine shootings. Seth Trickey, a seventh grader in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma,who pulled out a 9mm semiautomatic handgun and fired fifteen rounds into a groupof classmates in December of 1999, was so obsessed with the Columbine shootingsthat before the incident he was receiving psychological counseling. A seventeenyear old in Millbrae, California, was arrested after threatening to “do aColumbine” at his school. Police found an arsenal of fifteen guns and rifles inhis home. Joseph DeGuzman, in Cupertino, California, planned an attack on hisschool in January of 2001, and later told police that the Columbine gunmen were“the only thing that’s real.” Three boys were arrested in Kansas the followingmonth, and police found bomb making materials, rifles, and ammunition in theirhomes, including three black trench coats just like the coats worn by theColumbine gunmen. Two days later, in Fort Collins, Colorado, police foundanother cache of ammunition and guns. The boys involved had been overheardplotting to “redo Columbine.”In the press, this wave of shootings and would be shootings has sometimes beenportrayed as part of a larger wave of violence. But that’s not true: In 1992–93,there were fifty four violent deaths on public school campuses around the UnitedStates. In 2000, there were sixteen. The Columbine wave happened in a periodwhen violence among students was down, not up. Much attention has also been paidto the social circumstances of the children involved in these incidents. AndyWilliams was a lonely and often bullied boy, the product of divorce and neglect.Time magazine summed up his world as a place where “getting stoned on superstrong weed like ‘bubblegum chronic’ is for some a daily deed and where ditchingschool to rub shoulders with the Aryan Brothers gang in the skate park is anunexceptional life choice.” But to have kids growing up in disaffection andloneliness is hardly a new development. Millions of kids who grow up just asemotionally impoverished as Andy Williams don’t walk into their school onemorning and start shooting. The difference is Columbine. Andy Williams wasinfected by the example of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, just as the suicidesof Micronesia were infected by the example of that first dramatic love triangle.It is a mistake to try to make sense of these kinds of actions by blaminginfluences of the outside world — in terms of broader trends of violence andsocial breakdown. These are epidemics in isolation: they follow a mysterious,internal script that makes sense only in the closed world that teenagersinhabit.The best analogy to this kind of epidemic is the outbreak of food poisoning thatswept through several public schools in Belgium in the summer of 1999. Itstarted when forty two children in the Belgian town of Bornem becamemysteriously ill after drinking Coca Cola and had to be hospitalized. Two dayslater, eight more schoolchildren fell sick in Brugge, followed by thirteen inHarelbeke the next day and forty two in Lochristi three days after that — and onand on in a widening spiral that, in the end, sent more than one hundredchildren to the hospital complaining of nausea, dizziness, and headaches, andforced Coca Cola into the biggest product recall in its 113 year history. Uponinvestigation, an apparent culprit was found. In the Coca Cola plant in Antwerp,contaminated carbon dioxide had been used to carbonate a batch of the soda’sfamous syrup. But then the case got tricky: upon examination, the contaminantsin the carbon dioxide were found to be sulfur compounds present at between fiveand seventeen parts per billion. These sulfides can cause illness, however, onlyat levels about a thousand times greater than that. At seventeen parts perbillion, they simply impart a bad smell — like rotten eggs — which means thatBelgium should have experienced nothing more than a minor epidemic of nosewrinkling. More puzzling is the fact that, in four of the five schools where thebad Coke allegedly caused illness, half the kids who got sick hadn’t actuallydrunk any Coke that day. Whatever went on in Belgium, in other words, probablywasn’t Coca Cola poisoning. So what was it? It was a kind of mass hysteria, aphenomenon that is not at all uncommon among schoolchildren. Simon Wessely, apsychiatrist at King’s College of Medicine in London, has been collectingreports of this kind of hysteria for about ten years and now has hundreds ofexamples, dating back as far as 1787, when millworkers in Lancashire suddenlytook ill after they became persuaded that they were being poisoned by taintedcotton. According to Wessely, almost all cases fit a pattern. Someone sees aneighbor fall ill and becomes convinced that he is being contaminated by someunseen evil — in the past it was demons and spirits; nowadays it tends to betoxins and gases — and his fear makes him anxious. His anxiety makes him dizzyand nauseated. He begins to hyperventilate. He collapses. Other people hear thesame allegation, see the “victim” faint, and they begin to get anxiousthemselves. They feel nauseated. They hyperventilate. They collapse, and beforeyou know it everyone in the room is hyperventilating and collapsing. Thesesymptoms, Wessely stresses, are perfectly genuine. It’s just that they aremanifestations of a threat that is wholly imagined. “This kind of thing isextremely common,” he says, “and it’s almost normal. It doesn’t mean that youare mentally ill or crazy.” What happened in Belgium was a fairly typicalexample of a more standard form of contagious anxiety, possibly heightened bythe recent Belgian scare over dioxin contaminated animal feed. The students’alarm over the rotten egg odor of their Cokes, for example, is straight out ofthe hysteria textbooks. “The vast majority of these events are triggered by someabnormal but benign smell,” Wessely said. “Something strange, like a weird odorcoming from the air conditioning.” The fact that the outbreaks occurred inschools is also typical of hysteria cases. “The classic ones always involveschoolchildren,” Wessely continued. “There is a famous British case involvinghundreds of schoolgirls who collapsed during a 1980 Nottinghamshire jazzfestival. They blamed it on a local farmer spraying pesticides.” There have beenmore than a hundred and fifteen documented hysteria cases in schools over thepast three hundred years.”Is it a mistake to take the hysterical outbreaks like the Belgian Coke scare tooseriously? Not at all. It was, in part, a symptom of deeper underlyinganxieties. What’s more, the children who felt sick were not faking theirsymptoms: they were sick. It’s just that it’s important to realize thatsometimes epidemic behavior among children does not have an identifiable andrational cause: the kids get sick because other kids got sick. The postColumbine outbreak of school shootings is, in this sense, no different. It ishappening because Columbine happened, and because ritualized, dramatic, selfdestructive behavior among teenagers — whether it involves suicide, smoking,taking a gun to school, or fainting after drinking a harmless can of Coke — hasextraordinary contagious power.My sense is that the way adolescent society has evolved in recent years hasincreased the potential for this kind of isolation. We have given teens moremoney, so they can construct their own social and material worlds more easily.We have given them more time to spend among themselves — and less time in thecompany of adults. We have given them e-mail and beepers and, most of all,cellular phones, so that they can fill in all the dead spots in their day — deadspots that might once have been filled with the voices of adults — with thevoices of their peers. That is a world ruled by the logic of word of mouth, bythe contagious messages that teens pass among themselves. Columbine is now themost prominent epidemic of isolation among teenagers. It will not be the last.Beware the Rise of ImmunityOne of the things I didn’t talk about much in The Tipping Point, but which Ihave been asked about over and over again, is the effect of the Internet — inparticular, e-mail — on my ideas about word of mouth. Surely, after all, e-mailseems to make the role of the Connector obsolete, or at least changes itdramatically. E-mail makes it possible for almost anyone to keep up with lotsand lots of people. In fact, e-mail does make it possible to cheaply andeffectively reach people — or customers — whom you might not know at all.Kevin Kelly, one of the gurus of the New Economy, has written, for example, ofwhat he calls the “fax effect,” which is a version of this argument. The firstfax machine ever made was the result of millions of dollars of research anddevelopment and cost about $2,000 at retail. But it was worth nothing becausethere was no other fax machine for it to communicate with. The second faxmachine made the first fax more valuable, and the third fax made the first twomore valuable, and so on. “Because fax machines are linked into a network, eachadditional fax machine that is shipped increases the value of all the faxmachines operating before it,” Kelly writes. When you buy a fax machine, then,what you are really buying is access to the entire fax network — which isinfinitely more valuable than the machine itself.Kelly calls this the “fax effect” or the law of plentitude, and he considers itan extraordinarily radical notion. In the traditional economy, after all, valuecomes from scarcity. The conventional “icons of wealth” — diamonds, gold — areprecious because they are rare. And when something scarce becomes plentiful — asoil did in the 1980s and 1990s — it loses value. But the logic of the network isexactly the opposite. Power and value now come from abundance. The more copiesyou make of your software, the more people you add to your network, the morepowerful it becomes. This is why e-mail is supposed to be so powerful: it’s theultimate tool for easily creating these kinds of personal networks.But is this true? Epidemics create networks as well: a virus moves from oneperson to another, spreading through a community, and the more people a virusinfects, the more “powerful” the epidemic is. But this is also why epidemics sooften come to a crashing halt. Once you’ve had a particular strain of the flu,or the measles, you develop an immunity to it, and when too many people getimmunity to a particular virus, the epidemic comes to an end. I think that whenwe talk about social epidemics, we give far too little attention to the problemof immunity.In the late 1970s, for instance, businesses began to realize that the phone wasa really cheap and efficient way of reaching potential customers, and since thenthe number of telemarketing calls to target households has increased tenfold.This sounds like a very good example of what Kelly is talking about — theextraordinary economic potential of a communications network that we all belongto — except that in certain key respects the explosion in phone use doesn’tsound like the law of plentitude at all. The fact that everyone has a phonemakes the phone network very powerful, in theory. But the truth is that over thepast twenty five years or so, the effectiveness of telemarketing has dropped byabout 50 percent. Certain low ticket items — things that cost in the range oftwenty five to thirty dollars, such as magazine subscriptions — are simply nolonger economical to market over the phone. Belonging to a large network may bea wonderful thing, and the larger networks are, theoretically, the more powerfulthey are. As a network grows in size, however, it is also the case that the timeand nuisance costs borne by each member of the network grow as well. That’s whypeople don’t talk to telemarketers anymore, and why most of us have answeringmachines and caller I.D. that lets us screen calls. The phone network is solarge and unwieldy that we are increasingly only interested in using itselectively. We are getting immune to the telephone.Is e-mail any different? I remember when I first got e-mail, back in the mid1990s. I would rush home with great anticipation and dial in on my 4800 baudmodem and I would have . . .four messages from four very good friends. And what would I do? I wouldimmediately compose long, elegant responses. Now, of course, I get up in themorning and go to my computer and I have sixty four messages, and theanticipation I once felt has been replaced by dread. I receive unwanted spame-mail and forwarded stories and jokes that I have no interest in, and people Idon’t particularly care about e-mail me to ask me to do things I don’t want todo. So how do I respond? I compose very, very short e-mails — seldom more thantwo lines long — and I often take two or three days to get back to people; andlots of e-mail I don’t answer at all. I suspect that the same thing is happeningwith other e-mail users around the world: the more e-mail we get, the shorterand more selective and more delayed our responses become. These are the symptomsof immunity.What makes e-mail so susceptible to immunity is the very thing that initiallymade it seem so attractive to people like Kevin Kelly: how easy and inexpensiveit was to reach people. In one recent study, for instance, psychologists foundthat groups who communicate electronically deal with dissenting opinions verydifferently than groups who meet face to face. People holding dissentingopinions expressed their arguments most “frequently and persistently” when theycommunicated online, the researchers concluded. “At the same time, minoritiesreceived the highest level of positive attention and had the greatest influenceon the private opinions of members in the majority and on the final groupdecision when they communicated face to face.” The fact that expressing adissenting view in person is much harder socially, in other words, gives thatopinion much more credence in the group’s deliberations. It’s the same way inother kinds of communications. The fact that anyone can e-mail us for free, ifthey have our address, means that people frequently and persistently e-mail us.But that quickly creates immunity, and simply makes us value face to facecommunications — and the communications of those we already know and trust — allthe more.I think that the “fax effect” error is being repeated by marketers andcommunicators over and over again. Advertising agencies often decide whichmagazines and television shows they want to place their ads in on the basis ofcost: they buy whatever time is the cheapest as a means of reaching the widestpossible audience. But what about immunity? The agencies’ logic has resulted inso many companies buying ads on television that it now runs more hours ofcommercial time than ever before. Therefore, it’s hard to believe that peopleare really watching commercials as closely as they did before. The same is truefor a magazine with hundreds of advertisements or a roadside with billboardsevery hundred feet. When people are overwhelmed with information and developimmunity to traditional forms of communication, they turn instead for advice andinformation to the people in their lives whom they respect, admire, and trust.The cure for immunity is finding Mavens, Connectors, and Salesmen.Finding the MavensWhenever I look at an unopened bar of Ivory bath soap, I flip it over and burstout laughing. In the midst of all the product information, there is a line thatsays: “Questions? Comments? Call 1 800 395 9960.” Who on earth could ever have aquestion about Ivory soap? In fact, who on earth would ever have a questionabout Ivory soap so important that they felt compelled to call the company rightaway? The answer, of course, is that while most of us would never dial thatnumber, a very small percentage of profoundly weird people may well feelcompelled from time to time to call in with a question. These are people whofeel passionate about soap. They are the soap Mavens, and if you are in the soapbusiness you had better treat those soap Mavens well because they are the oneswhom all their friends turn to for advice about soap.The Ivory soap 800 number is what I call a Maven trap — a way of efficientlyfiguring out who the Mavens are in a particular world — and how to set Maventraps is one of the central problems facing the modern marketplace. For thebetter part of a century, we defined influence in this country in the form ofstatus. The most important influence in making up our minds, we were told, wasthe people who made the most money and who had the most education and who livedin the choicest neighborhoods. The virtue of this notion was that these kinds ofpeople were easy to find: in fact, an entire industry in the marketing world wascreated around the convenient delivery of long lists of people who had graduatedegrees, made lots of money, and lived in nice neighborhoods. But Connectors,Mavens, and Salesmen are a little different. They are distinguished not byworldly status and achievement, but by the particular standing they have amongtheir friends. People look up to them not out of envy, but out of love, which iswhy these kinds of personalities have the power to break through the rising tideof isolation and immunity. But love is a very difficult thing to track. How onearth do you find these kinds of people?This is a question that I’ve been asked again and again over the last year, andthere is no easy answer. Connectors, I think, are the sorts of people who don’tneed to be found. They make it their business to find you. But Mavens are alittle harder, which is why it is so important, I think, to come up withstrategies for finding Mavens — Maven traps. Consider the experience of Lexus.In 1990, just after Lexus first introduced its line of luxury cars in the UnitedStates, the company realized that it had two minor problems with its LS400 linethat required a recall. The situation was, by any measure, an awkward one. Lexushad decided, from the beginning, to build its reputation around qualityworkmanship and reliability. And now, within little more than a year of thebrand’s launch, the company was being forced to admit to problems with itsflagship. So Lexus decided to make a special effort. Most recalls are handled bymaking an announcement to the press and mailing a notification letter to owners.Lexus, instead, called each owner individually on the telephone the day therecall was announced. When the owners picked up their cars at the dealershipafter the work was completed, each car had been washed and the tank filled withgas. If an owner lived more than a hundred miles from a dealership, the dealersent a mechanic to his or her home. In one instance, a technician flew from LosAngeles to Anchorage to make the necessary repairs.Was it necessary to go to such lengths? You could argue that Lexus overreacted.The problems with the car were relatively minor. And the number of cars involvedin the recall — so soon after Lexus had entered the marketplace — was small.Lexus would seem to have had many opportunities to correct the damage. The keyfact, though, was not the number of people affected by the recall but the kindof people affected by the recall. Who, after all, are the people willing to takea chance and buy a brand new luxury model? Car Mavens. There may have been onlya few thousand Lexus owners at that point, but they were car experts, people whotake cars seriously, people who talk about cars, people whose friends ask themfor advice about cars. Lexus realized that it had a captive audience of Mavensand that if they went the extra mile they could kick start a word of mouthepidemic about the quality of their customer service — and that’s just whathappened. The company emerged from what could have been a disaster with areputation for customer service that continues to this day. One automotivepublication later called it “the perfect recall.”This is the perfect Maven trap — using the recognition that sometimes a specifictime or place or situation happens to bring together a perfect Maven audience.Here’s another example, one that a reader of The Tipping Point, Bill Hartigan,told me about in an e-mail. Hartigan was working for ITT Financial Services inthe early 1970s, right at the moment when the entire industry was first beingallowed to market the then unknown IRA (Individual Retirement Account). It was amarket ITT ended up dominating. Why? Because they were the first to find a groupof Mavens. As Hartigan writes:The concept of giving your money to an institution until you were at least 59½years old then seemed strange, and scary. But one interesting thing about thoseIRAs. Even until the mid 70s, tax ‘breaks’ were only for the wealthy. This wasthe exception. Knowing that was our key to success.Target the wealthy? Nope. There are never many of them, they are too hard tosee, and the benefits of IRAs probably would be of muted appeal. One potentialtarget group stood out like a sore thumb, though. Teachers.At the time (and to this day, unfortunately) this vital group of professionalswas overworked and severely underpaid. No one ever sought the advice of ateacher when the topic was tax breaks and investing. But IRAs allowed teachersmany similar benefits that heretofore had only been for the wealthy. Itbenefited them today and tomorrow.As the great sportswriter Red Smith once wrote, “Fighters fight.”And teachers? They teach.They quickly caught on to the benefits of what IRAs had to offer them. Just asquickly, human nature took over. For the first time ever, they were able to talkto Johnny’s parents about how they handled their money.Talk about grooming an entire market. Still the most brilliant marketingstrategy that I have ever been involved with.Is there a way of finding the Mavens in every market? I don’t know, although Iam quite sure that there are readers who will use The Tipping Point as theinspiration to come up with a way. In a world dominated by isolation andimmunity, understanding these principles of word of mouth is more important thanever."},{"pageContent":"Endnotes [TippingPoint_toc.html#note_2]INTRODUCTIONPage 5 [TippingPoint_intr_1.html#page_5].For a good summary of New York City crime statistics, see: Michael Massing, “TheBlue Revolution,” in the New York Review of Books, November 19, 1998, pp. 32–34.There is another good discussion of the anomalous nature of the New York crimedrop in William Bratton and William Andrews, “What We’ve Learned AboutPolicing,” in City Journal, Spring 1999, p. 25.Page 10 [TippingPoint_intr_1.html#page_10].The leader in research on yawning is Robert Provine, a psychologist at theUniversity of Maryland. Among his papers on the subject are:Robert Provine, “Yawning as a Stereotyped Action Pattern and ReleasingStimulus,” Ethology (1983), vol. 72, pp. 109–122.Robert Provine, “Contagious Yawning and Infant Imitation,” Bulletin of thePsychonomic Society (1989), vol. 27, no. 2, pp. 125–126.Page 12 [TippingPoint_intr_1.html#page_12].The best way to understand the Tipping Point is to imagine a hypotheticaloutbreak of the flu. Suppose, for example, that one summer 1,000 tourists cometo Manhattan from Canada carrying an untreatable strain of twenty four hourvirus. This strain of flu has a 2 percent infection rate, which is to say thatone out of every 50 people who come into close contact with someone carrying itcatches the bug himself. Let’s say that 50 is also exactly the number of peoplethe average Manhattanite—in the course of riding the subways and mingling withcolleagues at work—comes into contact with every day. What we have, then, is adisease in equilibrium. Those 1,000 Canadian tourists pass on the virus to 1,000new people on the day they arrive. And the next day those 1,000 newly infectedpeople pass on the virus to another 1,000 people, just as the original 1,000tourists who started the epidemic are returning to health. With those gettingsick and those getting well so perfectly in balance, the flu chugs along at asteady but unspectacular clip through the rest of the summer and the fall.But then comes the Christmas season. The subways and buses get more crowded withtourists and shoppers, and instead of running into an even 50 people a day, theaverage Manhattanite now has close contact with, say, 55 people a day. All of asudden, the equilibrium is disrupted. The 1,000 flu carriers now run into 55,000people a day, and at a 2 percent infection rate, that translates into 1,100cases the following day. Those 1,100, in turn, are now passing on their virus to55,000 people as well, so that by day three there are 1,210 Manhattanites withthe flu and by day four 1,331 and by the end of the week there are nearly 2,000,and so on up, in an exponential spiral, until Manhattan has a full blown fluepidemic on its hands by Christmas Day. That moment when the average flu carrierwent from running into 50 people a day to running into 55 people was the TippingPoint. It was the point at which an ordinary and stable phenomenon—a low levelflu outbreak—turned into a public health crisis. If you were to draw a graph ofthe progress of the Canadian flu epidemic, the Tipping Point would be the pointon the graph where the line suddenly turned upward.Tipping Points are moments of great sensitivity. Changes made right at theTipping Point can have enormous consequences. Our Canadian flu became anepidemic when the number of New Yorkers running into a flu carrier jumped from50 to 55 a day. But had that same small change happened in the oppositedirection, if the number had dropped from 50 to 45, that change would havepushed the number of flu victims down to 478 within a week, and within a fewweeks more at that rate, the Canadian flu would have vanished from Manhattanentirely. Cutting the number exposed from 70 to 65, or 65 to 60 or 60 to 55would not have been sufficient to end the epidemic. But a change right at theTipping Point, from 50 to 45, would.The Tipping Point model has been described in several classic works ofsociology.

Most recently, a group of researchers at the University ofMassachusetts and the University of Kansas went back and recontacted close to600 children whose television watching as preschoolers they had tracked back inthe 1980s. The kids were now all in high school, and the researchers found—totheir astonishment—that the kids who had watched Sesame Street the most as fourand five year olds were still doing better in school than those who didn’t. Evenafter controlling for things like parent’s education, family size, and preschoolvocabulary level, the Sesame Street watchers did better in high school inEnglish, math, and science and they were also much more likely to read books forleisure than those who didn’t watch the show, or who watched the show less.According to the study, for every hour per week of Sesame Street viewing, highschool grade point averages increased by .052, which means that a child whowatched five hours of Sesame Street a week at age five was earning, on average,about one quarter of a grade level higher than a child of similar background whonever watched the show. Somehow a single television show an hour long, watchedover the course of no more than two or three years, was still making adifference twelve and fifteen years later.This research is summarized in “Effects of Early Childhood Media Use onAdolescent Achievement” by the “Recontact” Project of the University ofMassachusetts at Amherst and the University of Kansas, Lawrence (1995).See also: John C.

According to a Centersfor Disease Control study released in October of 1998, for example, the numberof American youths—people under the age of 18—taking up smoking as a daily habitincreased from 708,000 in 1988 to 1.2 million in 1996, an increase of 73percent. The rate at which teens became smokers also increased. In 1996, 77 outof every 1,000 nonsmoking teens picked up the habit. In 1988, the rate was 51per 1,000. The highest rate ever recorded was 67 per 1,000 in 1977, and thelowest was 44 per 1,000 in 1983. (“New teen smokers up 73 percent”: AssociatedPress, October 9, 1998.) It is also the case that smoking among collegestudents—a slightly older cohort—is also on the rise. In this study by theHarvard School of Public Health—published in the Journal of the American MedicalAssociation, November 18, 1998—the statistic used was percentage of collegestudents who had smoked at least one cigarette in the past 30 days. In 1993, thenumber was 22.3 percent. By 1997, it had increased to 28.5 percent.Page 222 [TippingPoint_chap_7.html#page_222].David Phillips’s first paper on suicide rates after news stories of celebritysuicides was: D. P.

Thank you, Tina. She and her successor, David Remnick, graciously allowed meto spend many months away from the magazine to work on this book. The earliestdraft of my manuscript was brilliantly critiqued by Terry Martin, now of HarvardUniversity and formerly of our hometown of Elmira, who has been a source ofintellectual inspiration to me since tenth grade biology. I also owe specialthanks to the extraordinary contributions of Judith Rich Harris, author of TheNurture Assumption, which changed the way I thought about the world, and mymother, Joyce Gladwell, who is and always will be my favorite writer. JudithShulevitz, Robert McCrum, Zoe Rosenfeld, Jacob Weisberg, and Deborah Needlemantook the time to read my manuscript and share their thoughts. DeeDee Gordon (andSage) and Sally Horchow graciously lent me their homes for the long weeks ofwriting. I hope someday to return the favor. At Little, Brown, I had thepleasure of working with a team of talented and dedicated and wonderfulprofessionals: Katie Long, Betty Power, Ryan Harbage, Sarah Crichton, and, mostof all, my editor, Bill Phillips. Bill read this book so many times he canprobably recite it by memory, and every time he read it his insight andintelligence made it a better book. Thank you. Two people, finally, have mydeepest gratitude. First my agent and friend Tina Bennett, who conceived of thisproject and saw it through—protecting, guiding, helping, and inspiring me everystep of the way. And second, my editor at the New Yorker, the incomparable HenryFinder, to whom I owe more than I can say.
