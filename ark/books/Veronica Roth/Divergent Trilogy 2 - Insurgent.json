Dead.My doing.Tobias crouches in front of me, his hand on my left shoulder. The train carbumps over the rails, and Marcus, Peter, and Caleb stand by the doorway. I takea deep breath and hold it in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure that isbuilding in my chest.An hour ago, nothing that happened felt real to me. Now it does.I breathe out, and the pressure is still there.“Tris, come on,” Tobias says, his eyes searching mine. “We have to jump.”It is too dark to see where we are, but if we are getting off, we are probablyclose to the fence. Tobias helps me to my feet and guides me toward the doorway.The others jump off one by one: Peter first, then Marcus, then Caleb. I takeTobias’s hand. The wind picks up as we stand at the edge of the car opening,like a hand pushing me back, toward safety.But we launch ourselves into darkness and land hard on the ground. The impacthurts the bullet wound in my shoulder. I bite my lip to keep from crying out,and search for my brother.“Okay?” I say when I see him sitting in the grass a few feet away, rubbing hisknee.He nods. I hear him sniff like he’s fending off tears, and I have to turn away.We landed in the grass near the fence, several yards away from the worn paththat the Amity trucks travel to deliver food to the city, and the gate that letsthem out—the gate that is currently shut, locking us in. The fence towers overus, too high and flexible to climb over, too sturdy to knock down.“There are supposed to be Dauntless guards here,” says Marcus. “Where are they?”“They were probably under the simulation,” Tobias says, “and are now …” Hepauses. “Who knows where, doing who knows what.”We stopped the simulation—the weight of the hard drive in my back pocket remindsme—but we didn’t pause to see the aftermath. What happened to our friends, ourpeers, our leaders, our factions? There is no way to know.Tobias approaches a small metal box on the right side of the gate and opens it,revealing a keypad.“Let’s hope the Erudite didn’t think to change this combination,” he says as hetypes in a series of numbers. He stops at the eighth one, and the gate clicksopen.“How did you know that?” says Caleb. His voice sounds thick with emotion, sothick I am surprised it does not choke him on the way out.“I worked in the Dauntless control room, monitoring the security system. We onlychange the codes twice a year,” Tobias says.“How lucky,” says Caleb. He gives Tobias a wary look.“Luck has nothing to do with it,” Tobias says. “I only worked there because Iwanted to make sure I could get out.”I shiver. The way he talks about getting out—it’s like he thinks we’re trapped.I never thought about it that way before, and now that seems foolish.We walk in a small pack, Peter cradling his bloody arm to his chest—the arm thatI shot—and Marcus with his hand on Peter’s shoulder, keeping him stable. Calebwipes his cheeks every few seconds, and I know he’s crying but I don’t know howto comfort him, or why I am not crying myself.Instead I take the lead, Tobias silent at my side, and though he does not touchme, he steadies me. Pinpricks of light are the first sign that we are nearing Amity headquarters.Then squares of light that turn into glowing windows. A cluster of wooden andglass buildings.Before we can reach them, we have to walk through an orchard. My feet sink intothe ground, and above me, the branches grow into one another, forming a kind oftunnel. Dark fruit hangs among the leaves, ready to drop. The sharp, sweet smellof rotting apples mixes with the scent of wet earth in my nose.When we get close, Marcus leaves Peter’s side and walks in front. “I know whereto go,” he says.He leads us past the first building to the second one on the left. All thebuildings except the greenhouses are made of the same dark wood, unpainted,rough. I hear laughter through an open window. The contrast between the laughterand the stone stillness within me is jarring.Marcus opens one of the doors. I would be shocked by the lack of security if wewere not at Amity headquarters. They often straddle the line between trust andstupidity.In this building the only sound is of our squeaking shoes. I don’t hear Calebcrying anymore, but then, he was quiet about it before.Marcus stops before an open room, where Johanna Reyes, representative of Amity,sits, staring out the window. I recognize her because it is hard to forgetJohanna’s face, whether you’ve seen her once or a thousand times. A scarstretches in a thick line from just above her right eyebrow to her lip,rendering her blind in one eye and giving her a lisp when she talks. I have onlyheard her speak once, but I remember. She would have been a beautiful woman ifnot for that scar.“Oh, thank God,” she says when she sees Marcus. She walks toward him with herarms open. Instead of embracing him, she just touches his shoulders, like sheremembers the Abnegation’s distaste for casual physical contact.“The other members of your party got here a few hours ago, but they weren’t sureif you had made it,” she says. She is referring to the group of Abnegation whowere with my father and Marcus in the safe house. I didn’t even think to worryabout them.She looks over Marcus’s shoulder, first at Tobias and Caleb, then at me, then atPeter.“Oh my,” she says, her eyes lingering on the blood soaking Peter’s shirt. “I’llsend for a doctor. I can grant you all permission to stay the night, buttomorrow, our community must decide together. And”—she eyes Tobias and me—“theywill likely not be enthusiastic about a Dauntless presence in our compound. I ofcourse ask you to turn over any weapons you might have.”I wonder, suddenly, how she knows that I am Dauntless. I am still wearing a grayshirt. My father’s shirt.At that moment, his smell, which is an even mixture of soap and sweat, waftsupward, and it fills my nose, fills my entire head with him. I clench my handsso hard into fists that my fingernails cut into my skin. Not here. Not here.Tobias hands over his gun, but when I reach behind me to take out my ownconcealed weapon, he grabs my hand, guiding it away from my back. Then he laceshis fingers with mine to cover up what he just did.I know it’s smart to keep one of our guns. But it would have been a relief tohand it over.“My name is Johanna Reyes,” she says, extending her hand to me, and then Tobias.A Dauntless greeting. I am impressed by her awareness of the customs of otherfactions. I always forget how considerate the Amity are until I see it formyself.“This is T—” Marcus starts, but Tobias interrupts him.“My name is Four,” he says. “This is Tris, Caleb, and Peter.”A few days ago, “Tobias” was a name only I knew, among the Dauntless; it was thepiece of himself that he gave me. Outside Dauntless headquarters, I remember whyhe hid that name from the world. It binds him to Marcus.“Welcome to the Amity compound.” Johanna’s eyes fix on my face, and she smilescrookedly. “Let us take care of you.” We do let them. An Amity nurse gives me a salve—developed by Erudite to speedhealing—to put on my shoulder, and then escorts Peter to the hospital ward tomend his arm. Johanna takes us to the cafeteria, where we find some of theAbnegation who were in the safe house with Caleb and my father. Susan is there,and some of our old neighbors, and rows of wooden tables as long as the roomitself. They greet us—especially Marcus—with held-in tears and suppressedsmiles.I cling to Tobias’s arm. I sag under the weight of the members of my parents’faction, their lives, their tears.One of the Abnegation puts a cup of steaming liquid under my nose and says,“Drink this. It will help you sleep as it helped some of the others sleep. Nodreams.”The liquid is pink-red, like strawberries. I grab the cup and drink it fast. Fora few seconds the heat from the liquid makes me feel like I am full of somethingagain. And as I drain the last drops from the cup, I feel myself relaxing.Someone leads me down the hallway, to a room with a bed in it. That is all."},{"pageContent":"[images/00043.jpg]I OPEN MY eyes, terrified, my hands clutching at the sheets. But I am notrunning through the streets of the city or the corridors of Dauntlessheadquarters. I am in a bed in Amity headquarters, and the smell of sawdust isin the air.I shift, and wince as something digs into my back. I reach behind me, and myfingers wrap around the gun.For a moment I see Will standing before me, both our guns between us—his hand, Icould have shot his hand, why didn’t I, why?—and I almost scream his name.Then he’s gone.I get out of bed and lift the mattress with one hand, propping it up on my knee.Then I shove the gun beneath it and let the mattress bury it. Once it is out ofsight and no longer pressed to my skin, my head feels clearer.Now that the adrenaline rush of yesterday is gone, and whatever made me sleephas worn off, the deep ache and shooting pains of my shoulder are intense. I amwearing the same clothes I wore last night. The corner of the hard drive peeksout from under my pillow, where I shoved it right before I fell asleep. On it isthe simulation data that controlled the Dauntless, and the record of what theErudite did. It feels too important for me to even touch, but I can’t leave ithere, so I grab it and wedge it between the dresser and the wall. Part of methinks it would be a good idea to destroy it, but I know it contains the onlyrecord of my parents’ deaths, so I’ll settle for keeping it hidden.Someone knocks on my door. I sit on the edge of the bed and try to smooth myhair down.“Come in,” I say.The door opens, and Tobias steps halfway in, the door dividing his body in half.He wears the same jeans as yesterday, but a dark red T-shirt instead of hisblack one, probably borrowed from one of the Amity. It’s a strange color on him,too bright, but when he leans his head back against the doorframe, I see that itmakes the blue in his eyes lighter.“The Amity are meeting in a half hour.” He quirks his eyebrows and adds, with atouch of melodrama, “To decide our fate.”I shake my head. “Never thought my fate would be in the hands of a bunch ofAmity.”“Me either. Oh, I brought you something.” He unscrews the cap of a small bottleand holds out a dropper filled with clear liquid. “Pain medicine. Take adropperful every six hours.”“Thanks.” I squeeze the dropper into the back of my throat. The medicine tasteslike old lemon.He hooks a thumb in one of his belt loops and says, “How are you, Beatrice?”“Did you just call me Beatrice?”“Thought I would give it a try.” He smiles. “Not good?”“Maybe on special occasions only. Initiation days, Choosing Days …” I pause. Iwas about to rattle off a few more holidays, but only the Abnegation celebratethem. The Dauntless have holidays of their own, I assume, but I don’t know whatthey are. And anyway, the idea that we would celebrate anything right now is soludicrous I don’t continue.“It’s a deal.” His smile fades. “How are you, Tris?”It’s not a strange question, after what we’ve been through, but I tense up whenhe asks it, worried that he’ll somehow see into my mind. I haven’t told himabout Will yet. I want to, but I don’t know how. Just the thought of saying thewords out loud makes me feel so heavy I could break through the floorboards.“I’m …” I shake my head a few times. “I don’t know, Four. I’m awake. I …” I amstill shaking my head. He slides his hand over my cheek, one finger anchoredbehind my ear. Then he tilts his head down and kisses me, sending a warm achethrough my body. I wrap my hands around his arm, holding him there as long as Ican. When he touches me, the hollowed-out feeling in my chest and stomach is notas noticeable.I don’t have to tell him. I can just try to forget—he can help me forget.“I know,” he says. “Sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.”For a moment all I can think is, How could you possibly know? But somethingabout his expression reminds me that he does know something about loss. He losthis mother when he was young. I don’t remember how she died, just that weattended her funeral.Suddenly I remember him clutching the curtains in his living room, about nineyears old, wearing gray, his dark eyes shut. The image is fleeting, and it couldbe my imagination, not a memory.He releases me. “I’ll let you get ready.” The women’s bathroom is two doors down. The floor is dark brown tile, and eachshower stall has wooden walls and a plastic curtain separating it from thecentral aisle. A sign on the back wall says REMEMBER: TO CONSERVE RESOURCES,SHOWERS RUN FOR ONLY FIVE MINUTES.The stream of water is cold, so I wouldn’t want the extra minutes even if Icould have them. I wash quickly with my left hand, leaving my right hand hangingat my side. The pain medicine Tobias gave me worked fast—the pain in my shoulderhas already faded to a dull throb.When I get out of the shower, a stack of clothes waits on my bed. It containssome yellow and red, from the Amity, and some gray, from the Abnegation, colorsI rarely see side by side. If I had to guess, I would say that one of theAbnegation put the stack there for me. It’s something they would think to do.I pull on a pair of dark red pants made of denim—so long I have to roll them upthree times—and a gray Abnegation shirt that is too big for me. The sleeves comedown to my fingertips, and I roll them up too. It hurts to move my right hand,so I keep the movements small and slow.Someone knocks on the door. “Beatrice?” The soft voice is Susan’s.I open the door for her. She carries a tray of food, which she sets down on thebed. I search her face for a sign of what she has lost—her father, an Abnegationleader, didn’t survive the attack—but I see only the placid determinationcharacteristic of my old faction.“I’m sorry the clothes don’t fit,” she says. “I’m sure we can find some betterones for you if the Amity allow us to stay.”“They’re fine,” I say. “Thank you.”“I heard you were shot. Do you need my help with your hair? Or your shoes?”I am about to refuse, but I really do need help.“Yes, thank you.”I sit down on a stool in front of the mirror, and she stands behind me, her eyesdutifully trained on the task at hand rather than her reflection. They do notlift, not even for an instant, as she runs a comb through my hair. And shedoesn’t ask about my shoulder, how I was shot, what happened when I left theAbnegation safe house to stop the simulation. I get the sense that if I were towhittle her down to her core, she would be Abnegation all the way through.“Have you seen Robert yet?” I say. Her brother, Robert, chose Amity when I choseDauntless, so he is somewhere in this compound. I wonder if their reunion willbe anything like Caleb’s and mine.“Briefly, last night,” she says. “I left him to grieve with his faction as Igrieve with mine. It is nice to see him again, though.”I hear a finality in her tone that tells me the subject is closed.“It’s a shame this happened when it did,” Susan says. “Our leaders were about todo something wonderful.”“Really? What?”“I don’t know.” Susan blushes. “I just knew that something was happening. Ididn’t mean to be curious; I just noticed things.”“I wouldn’t blame you for being curious even if you had been.”She nods and keeps combing. I wonder what the Abnegation leaders—including myfather—were doing. And I can’t help but marvel at Susan’s assumption thatwhatever they were doing was wonderful. I wish I could believe that of peopleagain.If I ever did.“The Dauntless wear their hair down, right?” she says.“Sometimes,” I say. “Do you know how to braid?”So her deft fingers tuck pieces of my hair into one braid that tickles themiddle of my spine. I stare hard at my reflection until she finishes. I thankher when she’s done, and she leaves with a small smile, closing the door behindher.I keep staring, but I don’t see myself. I can still feel her fingers brushingthe back of my neck, so much like my mother’s fingers, the last morning I spentwith her. My eyes wet with tears, I rock back and forth on the stool, trying topush the memory from my mind. I am afraid that if I start to sob, I will neverstop until I shrivel up like a raisin.I see a sewing kit on the dresser. In it are two colors of thread, red andyellow, and a pair of scissors.I feel calm as I undo the braid in my hair and comb it again. I part my hairdown the middle and make sure that it is straight and flat. I close the scissorsover the hair by my chin.How can I look the same, when she’s gone and everything is different? I can’t.I cut in as straight a line as I can, using my jaw as a guide. The tricky partis the back, which I can’t see very well, so I do the best I can by touchinstead of sight. Locks of blond hair surround me on the floor in a semicircle.I leave the room without looking at my reflection again. When Tobias and Caleb come to get me later, they stare at me like I am not theperson they knew yesterday.“You cut your hair,” says Caleb, his eyebrows high. Grabbing hold of facts inthe midst of shock is very Erudite of him. His hair sticks up on one side fromwhere he slept on it, and his eyes are bloodshot.“Yeah,” I say. “It’s … too hot for long hair.”“Fair enough.”We walk down the hallway together. The floorboards creak beneath our feet. Imiss the way my footsteps echoed in the Dauntless compound; I miss the coolunderground air. But mostly I miss the fears of the past few weeks, renderedsmall by my fears now.We exit the building. The outside air presses around me like a pillow meant tosuffocate me. It smells green, the way a leaf does when you tear it in half.“Does everyone know you’re Marcus’s son?” Caleb says. “The Abnegation, I mean?”“Not to my knowledge,” says Tobias, glancing at Caleb. “And I would appreciateit if you didn’t mention it.”“I don’t need to mention it. Anyone with eyes can see it for themselves.” Calebfrowns at him. “How old are you, anyway?”“Eighteen.”“And you don’t think you’re too old to be with my little sister?”Tobias lets out a short laugh. “She isn’t your little anything.”“Stop it. Both of you,” I say. A crowd of people in yellow walks ahead of us,toward a wide, squat building made entirely of glass. The sunlight reflectingoff the panes feels like a pinch to my eyes. I shield my face with my hand andkeep walking.The doors to the building are wide open. Around the edge of the circulargreenhouse, plants and trees grow in troughs of water or small pools. Dozens offans positioned around the room serve only to blow the hot air around, so I amalready sweating. But that fades from my mind when the crowd before me thins andI see the rest of the room.In its center grows a huge tree. Its branches are spread over most of thegreenhouse, and its roots bubble up from the ground, forming a dense web ofbark. In the spaces between the roots, I see not dirt but water, and metal rodsholding the roots in place. I should not be surprised—the Amity spend theirlives accomplishing feats of agriculture like this one, with the help of Eruditetechnology.Standing on a cluster of roots is Johanna Reyes, her hair falling over thescarred half of her face. I learned in Faction History that the Amity recognizeno official leader—they vote on everything, and the result is usually close tounanimous. They are like many parts of a single mind, and Johanna is theirmouthpiece.The Amity sit on the floor, most with their legs crossed, in knots and clustersthat vaguely resemble the tree roots to me. The Abnegation sit in tight rows afew yards to my left. My eyes search the crowd for a few seconds before Irealize what I’m looking for: my parents.I swallow hard, and try to forget. Tobias touches the small of my back, guidingme to the edge of the meeting space, behind the Abnegation. Before we sit down,he puts his mouth next to my ear and says, “I like your hair that way.”I find a small smile to give him, and lean into him when I sit down, my armagainst his.Johanna lifts her hands and bows her head. All conversation in the room ceasesbefore I can draw my next breath. All around me the Amity sit in silence, somewith their eyes closed, some with their lips mouthing words I can’t hear, somestaring at a point far away.Every second chafes. By the time Johanna lifts her head I am worn to the bone.“We have before us today an urgent question,” she says, “which is: How will weconduct ourselves in this time of conflict as people who pursue peace?”Every Amity in the room turns to the person next to him or her and startstalking.“How do they get anything done?” I say, as the minutes of chatter wear on.“They don’t care about efficiency,” Tobias says. “They care about agreement.Watch.”Two women in yellow dresses a few feet away rise and join a trio of men. A youngman shifts so that his small circle becomes a large one with the group next tohim. All around the room, the smaller crowds grow and expand, and fewer andfewer voices fill the room, until there are only three or four. I can only hearpieces of what they say: “Peace—Dauntless—Erudite—safe house—involvement—”“This is bizarre,” I say.“I think it’s beautiful,” he says.I give him a look.“What?” He laughs a little. “They each have an equal role in government; theyeach feel equally responsible. And it makes them care; it makes them kind. Ithink that’s beautiful.”“I think it’s unsustainable,” I say. “Sure, it works for the Amity. But whathappens when not everyone wants to strum banjos and grow crops? What happenswhen someone does something terrible and talking about it can’t solve theproblem?”He shrugs. “I guess we’ll find out.”Eventually someone from each of the big groups stands and approaches Johanna,picking their way carefully over the roots of the big tree. I expect them toaddress the rest of us, but instead they stand in a circle with Johanna and theother spokespeople and talk quietly. I begin to get the feeling that I willnever know what they’re saying.“They’re not going to let us argue with them, are they,” I say.“I doubt it,” he says.We are done for.When everyone has said his or her piece, they sit down again, leaving Johannaalone in the center of the room. She angles her body toward us and folds herhands in front of her. Where will we go when they tell us to leave? Back intothe city, where nothing is safe?“Our faction has had a close relationship with Erudite for as long as any of uscan remember. We need each other to survive, and we have always cooperated witheach other,” says Johanna. “But we have also had a strong relationship withAbnegation in the past, and we do not think it is right to revoke the hand offriendship when it has for so long been extended.”Her voice is honey-sweet, and moves like honey too, slow and careful. I wipe thesweat from my hairline with the back of my hand.“We feel that the only way to preserve our relationships with both factions isto remain impartial and uninvolved,” she continues. “Your presence here, thoughwelcome, complicates that.”Here it comes, I think.“We have arrived at the conclusion that we will establish our factionheadquarters as a safe house for members of all factions,” she says, “under aset of conditions. The first is that no weaponry of any kind is allowed on thecompound. The second is that if any serious conflict arises, whether verbal orphysical, all involved parties will be asked to leave. The third is that theconflict may not be discussed, even privately, within the confines of thiscompound. And the fourth is that everyone who stays here must contribute to thewelfare of this environment by working. We will report this to Erudite, Candor,and Dauntless as soon as we can.”Her stare drifts to Tobias and me, and stays there.“You are welcome to stay here if and only if you can abide by our rules,” shesays. “That is our decision.”I think of the gun I hid under my mattress, and the tension between me andPeter, and Tobias and Marcus, and my mouth feels dry. I am not good at avoidingconflict.“We won’t be able to stay long,” I say to Tobias under my breath.A moment ago, he was still faintly smiling. Now the corners of his mouth havedisappeared into a frown. “No, we won’t.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00044.jpg]THAT EVENING I return to my room and slide my hand beneath my mattress to makesure the gun is still there. My fingers brush over the trigger, and my throattightens like I am having an allergic reaction. I withdraw my hand and kneel onthe edge of the bed, taking hard swallows of air until the feeling subsides.What is wrong with you? I shake my head. Pull it together.And that is what it feels like: pulling the different parts of me up and in likea shoelace. I feel suffocated, but at least I feel strong.I see a flicker of movement in my periphery, and look out the window that facesthe apple orchard. Johanna Reyes and Marcus Eaton walk side by side, pausing atthe herb garden to pluck mint leaves from their stems. I am out of my roombefore I can evaluate why I want to follow them.I sprint through the building so that I don’t lose them. Once I am outside, Ihave to be more careful. I walk around the far side of the greenhouse and, afterI see Johanna and Marcus disappear into one row of trees, I creep down the nextrow, hoping the branches will hide me if either of them looks back.“… been confused about is the timing of the attack,” says Johanna. “Is it justthat Jeanine finally finished planning it, and acted, or was there an incitingincident of some kind?”I see Marcus’s face through a divided tree trunk. He presses his lips togetherand says, “Hmm.”“I suppose we’ll never know.” Johanna raises her good eyebrow. “Will we?”“No, perhaps not.”Johanna places her hand on his arm and turns toward him. I stiffen, afraid for amoment that she will see me, but she looks only at Marcus. I sink into a crouchand crawl toward one of the trees so that the trunk will hide me. The barkitches my spine, but I don’t move.“But you do know,” she says. “You know why she attacked when she did. I may notbe Candor anymore, but I can still tell when someone is keeping the truth fromme.”“Inquisitiveness is self-serving, Johanna.”If I were Johanna, I would snap at him for a comment like that, but she sayskindly, “My faction depends on me to advise them, and if you know informationthis crucial, it is important that I know it also so that I can share it withthem. I’m sure you can understand that, Marcus.”“There is a reason you don’t know all the things I know. A long time ago, theAbnegation were entrusted with some sensitive information,” says Marcus.“Jeanine attacked us to steal it. And if I am not careful, she will destroy it,so that is all I can tell you.”“But surely—”“No,” Marcus cuts her off. “This information is far more important than you canimagine. Most of the leaders of this city risked their lives to protect it fromJeanine and died, and I will not jeopardize it now for the sake of sating yourselfish curiosity.”Johanna is quiet for a few seconds. It’s so dark now I can barely see my ownhands. The air smells like dirt and apples, and I try not to breathe it tooloudly.“I’m sorry,” says Johanna. “I must have done something to make you believe I amnot trustworthy.”“The last time I trusted a faction representative with this information, all myfriends were murdered,” he replies. “I don’t trust anyone anymore.”I can’t help it—I lean forward so that I can see around the trunk of the tree.Both Marcus and Johanna are too preoccupied to notice the movement. They areclose together, but not touching, and I’ve never seen Marcus look so tired orJohanna so angry. But her face softens, and she touches Marcus’s arm again, thistime with a light caress.“In order to have peace, we must first have trust,” says Johanna. “So I hope youchange your mind. Remember that I have always been your friend, Marcus, evenwhen you did not have many to speak of.”She leans in and kisses his cheek, then walks to the end of the orchard. Marcusstands for a few seconds, apparently stunned, and starts toward the compound.The revelations of the past half hour buzz in my mind. I thought Jeanineattacked the Abnegation to seize power, but she attacked them to stealinformation—information only they knew.Then the buzzing stops as I remember something else Marcus said: Most of theleaders of this city risked their lives for it. Was one of those leaders myfather?I have to know. I have to find out what could possibly be important enough forthe Abnegation to die for—and the Erudite to kill for. I pause before knocking on Tobias’s door, and listen to what’s going on inside.“No, not like that,” Tobias says through laughter.“What do you mean, ‘not like that’? I imitated you perfectly.” The second voicebelongs to Caleb.“You did not.”“Well, do it again, then.”I push open the door just as Tobias, who is sitting on the floor with one legstretched out, hurls a butter knife at the opposite wall. It sticks, handle out,from a large hunk of cheese they positioned on top of the dresser. Caleb,standing beside him, stares in disbelief, first at the cheese and then at me.“Tell me he’s some kind of Dauntless prodigy,” says Caleb. “Can you do thistoo?”He looks better than he did earlier—his eyes aren’t red anymore and some of theold spark of curiosity is in them, like he is interested in the world again. Hisbrown hair is tousled, his shirt buttons in the wrong buttonholes. He ishandsome in a careless way, my brother, like he has no idea what he looks likemost of the time.“With my right hand, maybe,” I say. “But yes, Four is some kind of Dauntlessprodigy. Can I ask why you’re throwing knives at cheese?”Tobias’s eyes catch mine on the word “Four.” Caleb doesn’t know that Tobiaswears his excellence all the time in his own nickname.“Caleb came by to discuss something,” Tobias says, leaning his head against thewall as he looks at me. “And knife-throwing just came up somehow.”“As it so often does,” I say, a small smile inching its way across my face.He looks so relaxed, his head back, his arm slung over his knee. We stare ateach other for a few more seconds than is socially acceptable. Caleb clears histhroat.“Anyway, I should be getting back to my room,” Caleb says, looking from Tobiasto me and back again. “I’m reading this book about the water-filtration systems.The kid who gave it to me looked at me like I was crazy for wanting to read it.I think it’s supposed to be a repair manual, but it’s fascinating.” He pauses.“Sorry. You probably think I’m crazy too.”“Not at all,” Tobias says with mock sincerity. “Maybe you should read thatrepair manual too, Tris. It sounds like something you might like.”“I can loan it to you,” Caleb says.“Maybe later,” I say. When Caleb closes the door behind him, I give Tobias adirty look.“Thanks for that,” I say. “Now he’s going to talk my ear off about waterfiltration and how it works. Though I guess I might prefer that to what he wantsto talk to me about.”“Oh? And what’s that?” Tobias quirks his eyebrows. “Aquaponics?”“Aqua-what?”“It’s one of the ways they grow food here. You don’t want to know.”“You’re right, I don’t,” I say. “What did he come to talk to you about?”“You,” he says. “I think it was the big-brother talk. ‘Don’t mess around with mysister’ and all that.”He gets up.“What did you tell him?”He comes toward me.“I told him how we got together—that’s how knife-throwing came up,” he says,“and I told him I wasn’t messing around.”I feel warm everywhere. He wraps his hands around my hips and presses me gentlyagainst the door. His lips find mine.I don’t remember why I came here in the first place.And I don’t care.I wrap my uninjured arm around him, pulling him against me. My fingers find thehem of his T-shirt, and slide beneath it, spreading wide over the small of hisback. He feels so strong.He kisses me again, more insistent this time, his hands squeezing my waist. Hisbreaths, my breaths, his body, my body, we are so close there is no difference.He pulls back, just a few centimeters. I almost don’t let him get that far.“This isn’t what you came here for,” he says.“No.”“What did you come for, then?”“Who cares?”I push my fingers through his hair, and draw his mouth to mine again. He doesn’tresist, but after a few seconds, he mumbles, “Tris,” against my cheek.“Okay, okay.” I close my eyes. I did come here for something important: to tellhim the conversation I overheard.We sit side by side on Tobias’s bed, and I start from the beginning. I tell himhow I followed Marcus and Johanna into the orchard. I tell him Johanna’squestion about the timing of the simulation attack, and Marcus’s response, andthe argument that followed. As I do, I watch his expression. He does not lookshocked or curious. Instead, his mouth works its way into the bitter pucker thataccompanies any mention of Marcus.“Well, what do you think?” I say once I finish.“I think,” he says carefully, “that it’s Marcus trying to feel more importantthan he is.”That was not the response I was expecting.“So … what? You think he’s just talking nonsense?”“I think there probably is some information the Abnegation knew that Jeaninewanted to know, but I think he’s exaggerating its importance. Trying to build uphis own ego by making Johanna think he’s got something she wants and he won’tgive it to her.”“I don’t …” I frown. “I don’t think you’re right. He didn’t sound like he waslying.”“You don’t know him like I do. He is an excellent liar.”He is right—I don’t know Marcus, and certainly not as well as he does. But myinstinct was to believe Marcus, and I usually trust my instincts.“Maybe you’re right,” I say, “but shouldn’t we find out what’s going on? Just tobe sure?”“I think it’s more important that we deal with the situation at hand,” saysTobias. “Go back to the city. Find out what’s going on there. Find a way to takeErudite down. Then maybe we can find out what Marcus was talking about, afterthis is all resolved. Okay?”I nod. It sounds like a good plan—a smart plan. But I don’t believe him—I don’tbelieve it’s more important to move forward than to find out the truth. When Ifound out that I was Divergent … when I found out that Erudite would attackAbnegation … those revelations changed everything. The truth has a way ofchanging a person’s plans.But it is difficult to persuade Tobias to do something he doesn’t want to do,and even more difficult to justify my feelings with no evidence except myintuition.So I agree. But I do not change my mind."},{"pageContent":"[images/00045.jpg]“BIOTECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN around for a long time, but it wasn’t always veryeffective,” Caleb says. He starts on the crust of his toast—he ate the middlefirst, just like he used to when we were little.He sits across from me in the cafeteria, at the table closest to the windows.Carved into the wood along the table’s edge are the letters “D” and “T” linkedtogether by a heart, so small I almost didn’t see them. I run my fingers overthe carving as Caleb speaks.“But Erudite scientists developed this highly effective mineral solution a whileback. It was better for the plants than dirt,” he says. “It’s an earlier versionof that salve they put on your shoulder—it accelerates the growth of new cells.”His eyes are wild with new information. Not all the Erudite are power hungry anddevoid of conscience, like their leader, Jeanine Matthews. Some of them are likeCaleb: fascinated by everything, dissatisfied until they find out how it works.I rest my chin on my hand and smile a little at him. He seems upbeat thismorning. I am glad he has found something to distract him from his grief.“So Erudite and Amity work together, then?” I say.“More closely than Erudite and any other faction,” he says. “Don’t you rememberfrom our Faction History book? It called them the ‘essential factions’—withoutthem, we would be incapable of survival. Some of the Erudite texts called themthe ‘enriching factions.’ And one of Erudite’s missions as a faction was tobecome both—essential and enriching.”It doesn’t sit well with me, how much our society needs Erudite to function. Butthey are essential—without them, there would be inefficient farming,insufficient medical treatments, and no technological advance.I bite my apple.“You aren’t going to eat your toast?” he says.“The bread tastes strange,” I say. “You can have it if you want.”“I’m amazed by how they live here,” he says as he takes the toast from my plate.“They’re completely self-sustaining. They have their own source of power, theirown water pumps, their own water filtration, their own food sources…. They’reindependent.”“Independent,” I say, “and uninvolved. Must be nice.”It is nice, from what I can tell. The large windows beside our table let in somuch sunlight I feel like I’m sitting outside. Clusters of Amity sit at theother tables, their clothes bright against their tanned skin. On me the yellowlooks dull.“So I take it Amity wasn’t one of the factions you had an aptitude for,” hesays, grinning.“No.” The group of Amity a few seats away from us bursts into laughter. Theyhaven’t even glanced in our direction since we sat down to eat. “Keep it down,all right? It’s not something I want to broadcast.”“Sorry,” he says, leaning over the table so that he can talk quieter. “So whatwere they?”I feel myself tensing, straightening. “Why do you want to know?”“Tris,” he says, “I’m your brother. You can tell me anything.”His green eyes never waver. He’s abandoned the useless spectacles he wore as amember of Erudite in favor of an Abnegation gray shirt and their trademark shorthaircut. He looks just as he did a few months ago, when we were living acrossthe hall from each other, both of us considering switching factions but notbrave enough to tell one another. Not trusting him enough to tell him was amistake I do not want to make again.“Abnegation, Dauntless,” I say, “and Erudite.”“Three factions?” His eyebrows lift.“Yes. Why?”“It just seems like a lot,” he says. “We each had to choose a research focus inErudite initiation, and mine was the aptitude test simulation, so I know a lotabout the way it’s designed. It’s really difficult for a person to get tworesults—the program actually doesn’t allow it. But to get three … I’m not evensure how that’s possible.”“Well, the test administrator had to alter the test,” I say. “She forced it togo to that situation on the bus so that she could rule out Erudite—exceptErudite wasn’t ruled out.”Caleb props his chin on a fist. “A program override,” he says. “I wonder howyour test administrator knew how to do that. It’s not something they’re taught.”I frown. Tori was a tattoo artist and an aptitude test volunteer—how did sheknow how to alter the aptitude test program? If she was good with computers, itwas only as a hobby, and I doubt that a computer hobby would enable someone tofiddle with an Erudite simulation.Then something from one of my conversations with her surfaces. My brother and Iboth transferred from Erudite.“She was Erudite,” I say. “A faction transfer. Maybe that’s how.”“Maybe,” he says, tapping his fingers—from left to right—against his cheek. Ourbreakfasts sit, almost forgotten, between us. “What does this mean about yourbrain chemistry? Or anatomy?”I laugh a little. “I don’t know. All I know is that I’m always aware duringsimulations, and sometimes I can wake myself up from them. Sometimes they don’teven work. Like the attack simulation.”“How do you wake yourself up from them? What do you do?”“I …” I try to remember. I feel like it has been a long time since I was in one,though it was only a few weeks. “It’s hard to say, because the Dauntlesssimulations were supposed to end when we had calmed down. But in one of mine …the one where Tobias figured out what I was … I just did something impossible. Ibroke glass just by putting my hand on it.”Caleb’s expression becomes distant, like he is looking into faraway places.Nothing like what I just described ever happened to him in the aptitude testsimulation, I know. So maybe he is wondering what it felt like, or how it’spossible. My cheeks grow warmer—he is analyzing my brain like he would analyze acomputer or a machine.“Hey,” I say. “Come back.”“Sorry,” he says, focusing on me again. “It’s just …”“Fascinating. Yeah, I know. You always look like someone’s sucked the life rightout of you when something fascinates you.”He laughs.“Can we talk about something else, though?” I say. “There may not be any Eruditeor Dauntless traitors around, but it still feels weird, talking about it inpublic like this.”“All right.”Before he can go on, the cafeteria doors open, and a group of Abnegation comein. They wear Amity clothes, like me, but also like me, it’s obvious whatfaction they are really in. They are silent, but not somber—they smile at theAmity they pass, inclining their heads, a few of them stopping to exchangepleasantries.Susan sits down next to Caleb with a small smile. Her hair is pulled back in itsusual knot, but her blond hair shines like gold. She and Caleb sit just slightlycloser than friends would, though they do not touch. She bobs her head to greetme.“I’m sorry,” she says. “Did I interrupt?”“No,” says Caleb. “How are you?”“I’m well. How are you?”I am just about to flee the dining hall rather than participate in careful,polite Abnegation conversation when Tobias comes in, looking harassed. He musthave been working in the kitchen this morning, as part of our agreement with theAmity. I have to work in the laundry rooms tomorrow.“What happened?” I say as he sits down next to me.“In their enthusiasm for conflict resolution, the Amity have apparentlyforgotten that meddling creates more conflict,” says Tobias. “If we stay heremuch longer, I am going to punch someone, and it’s not going to be pretty.”Caleb and Susan both raise their eyebrows at him. A few of the Amity at thetable next to ours stop talking to stare.“You heard me,” Tobias says to them. They all look away.“As I said,” I say, covering my mouth to hide my smile, “what happened?”“I’ll tell you later.”It must have to do with Marcus. Tobias doesn’t like the dubious looks theAbnegation give him when he refers to Marcus’s cruelty, and Susan is sittingright across from him. I clasp my hands in my lap.The Abnegation sit at our table, but not right next to us—a respectful distanceof two seats away, though most of them still nod at us. They were my family’sfriends and neighbors and coworkers, and before, their presence would haveencouraged me to be quiet and self-effacing. Now it makes me want to talklouder, to be as far from that old identity and the pain that accompanies it aspossible.Tobias goes completely still when a hand falls on my right shoulder, sendingprickles of pain down my right arm. I clench my teeth to keep from groaning.“She got shot in that shoulder,” Tobias says without looking at the man behindme.“My apologies.” Marcus lifts his hand and sits down on my left. “Hello.”“What do you want?” I say.“Beatrice,” Susan says quietly. “There’s no need to—”“Susan, please,” says Caleb quietly. She presses her lips into a line and looksaway.I frown at Marcus. “I asked you a question.”“I would like to discuss something with you,” says Marcus. His expression iscalm, but he’s angry—the terseness in his voice betrays him. “The otherAbnegation and myself have discussed it and decided that we should not stayhere. We believe that, given the inevitability of further conflict in our city,it would be selfish of us to stay here while what remains of our faction isinside that fence. We would like to request that you escort us.”I did not expect that. Why does Marcus want to return to the city? Is it reallyjust an Abnegation decision, or does he intend to do something there—somethingthat has to do with whatever information the Abnegation have?I stare at him for a few seconds and then look at Tobias. He has relaxed alittle, but he keeps his eyes focused on the table. I don’t know why he actsthis way around his father. No one, not even Jeanine, makes Tobias cower.“What do you think?” I say.“I think we should leave the day after tomorrow,” Tobias says.“Okay. Thank you,” says Marcus. He gets up and sits at the other end of thetable with the rest of the Abnegation.I inch closer to Tobias, not sure how to comfort him without making thingsworse. I pick up my apple with my left hand, and grab his hand under the tablewith my right.But I can’t keep my eyes away from Marcus. I want to know more about what hesaid to Johanna. And sometimes, if you want the truth, you have to demand it."},{"pageContent":"[images/00046.jpg]AFTER BREAKFAST, I tell Tobias I’m going for a walk, but instead I followMarcus. I expect him to walk to the guests’ dormitory, but he crosses the fieldbehind the dining hall and walks into the water-filtration building. I hesitateon the bottom step. Do I really want to do this?I walk up the steps and through the door that Marcus just closed behind him.The filtration building is small, just one room with a few huge machines in it.As far as I can tell, some of the machines take in dirty water from the rest ofthe compound, a few of them purify it, others test it, and the last set pumpsclean water back out to the compound. The piping systems are all buried exceptone, which runs along the ground to send water to the power plant, near thefence. The plant provides power to the entire city, using a combination of wind,water, and solar energy.Marcus stands near the machines that filter the water. There the pipes aretransparent. I can see brown-tinged water rushing through one pipe, disappearinginto the machine, and emerging clear. Both of us watch the purification happen,and I wonder if he is thinking what I am: that it would be nice if life workedthis way, stripping the dirt from our lives and sending us out into the worldclean. But some dirt is destined to linger.I stare at the back of Marcus’s head. I have to do this now.Now.“I heard you, the other day,” I blurt out.Marcus whips his head around. “What are you doing, Beatrice?”“I followed you here.” I fold my arms over my chest. “I heard you talking toJohanna about what motivated Jeanine’s attack on Abnegation.”“Did the Dauntless teach you that it’s all right to invade another person’sprivacy, or did you teach yourself?”“I’m a naturally curious person. Don’t change the subject.”Marcus’s forehead is creased, especially between the eyebrows, and there aredeep lines next to his mouth. He looks like a man who has spent most of his lifefrowning. He might have been handsome when he was younger—perhaps he still is,to women his age, like Johanna—but all I see when I look at him are theblack-pit eyes from Tobias’s fear landscape.“If you heard me talking to Johanna, then you know that I didn’t even tell herabout this. So what makes you think that I would share the information withyou?”I don’t have an answer at first. But then it comes to me.“My father,” I say. “My father is dead.” It’s the first time I’ve said it sinceI told Tobias, on the train ride over, that my parents died for me. “Died” wasjust a fact to me then, detached from emotion. But “dead,” mingling with thechurning and bubbling noises in this room, strikes a blow like a hammer to mychest, and the monster of grief awakens, clawing at my eyes and throat.I force myself to continue.“He may not have actually died for whatever information you were referring to,”I say. “But I want to know if it was something he risked his life for.”Marcus’s mouth twitches.“Yes,” he says. “It was.”My eyes fill with tears. I blink them away.“Well,” I say, almost choking, “then what on earth was it? Was it something youwere trying to protect? Or steal? Or what?”“It was …” Marcus shakes his head. “I’m not going to tell you that.”I step toward him. “But you want it back. And Jeanine has it.”Marcus is a good liar—or at least, someone who is skilled at hiding secrets. Hedoes not react. I wish I could see like Johanna sees, like the Candor see—I wishI could read his expression. He could be close to telling me the truth. If Ipress just hard enough, maybe he’ll crack.“I could help you,” I say.Marcus’s upper lip curls. “You have no idea how ridiculous that sounds.” Hespits the words at me. “You may have succeeded in shutting down the attacksimulation, girl, but it was by luck alone, not skill. I would die of shock ifyou managed to do anything useful again for a long time.”This is the Marcus that Tobias knows. The one who knows right where to hit tocause the most damage.My body shudders with anger. “Tobias is right about you,” I say. “You’re nothingbut an arrogant, lying piece of garbage.”“He said that, did he?” Marcus raises his eyebrows.“No,” I say. “He doesn’t mention you enough to say anything like that. I figuredit out all on my own.” I clench my teeth. “You’re almost nothing to him, youknow. And as time goes on, you become less and less.”Marcus doesn’t answer me. He turns back to the water purifier. I stand for amoment in my triumph, the sound of rushing water combining with the heartbeat inmy ears. Then I leave the building, and it isn’t until I’m halfway across thefield that I realize I didn’t win. Marcus did.Whatever the truth is, I’ll have to get it from somewhere else, because I won’tbe asking him again. That night I dream that I am in a field, and I encounter a flock of crowsclustered on the ground. When I swat a few of them away, I realize that they areperched on top of a man, pecking at his clothes, which are Abnegation gray.Without warning, they take flight, and I realize that the man is Will.Then I wake up.I turn my face into the pillow and release, instead of his name, a sob thatthrows my body against the mattress. I feel the monster of grief again, writhingin the empty space where my heart and stomach used to be.I gasp, pressing both palms to my chest. Now the monstrous thing has its clawsaround my throat, squeezing my airway. I twist and put my head between my knees,breathing until the strangled feeling leaves me.Even though the air is warm, I shiver. I get out of bed and creep down thehallway toward Tobias’s room. My bare legs almost glow in the dark. His doorcreaks when I pull it open, loud enough to wake him. He stares at me for asecond.“C’mere,” he says, sluggish from sleep. He shifts back on the bed to leave spacefor me.I should have thought this through. I sleep in a long T-shirt one of the Amitylent me. It comes down just past my butt, and I didn’t think to put on a pair ofshorts before I came here. Tobias’s eyes skim my bare legs, making my face warm.I lie down, facing him.“Bad dream?” he says.I nod.“What happened?”I shake my head. I can’t tell him that I’m having nightmares about Will, or Iwould have to explain why. What would he think of me, if he knew what I haddone? How would he look at me?He keeps his hand on my cheek, moving his thumb over my cheekbone idly.“We’re all right, you know,” he says. “You and me. Okay?”My chest aches, and I nod.“Nothing else is all right.” His whisper tickles my cheek. “But we are.”“Tobias,” I say. But whatever I was about to say gets lost in my head, and Ipress my mouth to his, because I know that kissing him will distract me fromeverything.He kisses me back. His hand starts on my cheek, and then brushes over my side,fitting to the bend in my waist, curving over my hip, sliding to my bare leg,making me shiver. I press closer to him and wrap my leg around him. My headbuzzes with nervousness, but the rest of me seems to know exactly what it’sdoing, because it all pulses to the same rhythm, all wants the same thing: toescape itself and become a part of him instead.His mouth moves against mine, and his hand slips under the hem of the T-shirt,and I don’t stop him, though I know I should. Instead a faint sigh escapes me,and heat rushes into my cheeks, embarrassment. Either he didn’t hear me or hedidn’t care, because he presses his palm to my lower back, presses me closer.His fingers move slowly up my back, tracing my spine. My shirt creeps up mybody, and I don’t pull it down, even when I feel cool air on my stomach.He kisses my neck, and I grab his shoulder to steady myself, gathering his shirtinto my fist. His hand reaches the top of my back and curls around my neck. Myshirt is twisted around his arm, and our kisses become desperate. I know myhands are shaking from all the nervous energy inside me, so I tighten my grip onhis shoulder so he won’t notice.Then his fingers brush the bandage on my shoulder, and a dart of pain goesthrough me. It didn’t hurt much, but it brings me back to reality. I can’t bewith him in that way if one of my reasons for wanting it is to distract myselffrom grief.I lean back and carefully pull the hem of my shirt down so it covers me again.For a second we just lie there, our heavy breaths mixing. I don’t mean tocry—now is not a good time to cry; no, it has to stop—but I can’t get the tearsout of my eyes, no matter how many times I blink.“Sorry,” I say.He says almost sternly, “Don’t apologize.” He brushes the tears from my cheeks.I know that I am birdlike, made narrow and small as if for taking flight, builtstraight-waisted and fragile. But when he touches me like he can’t bear to takehis hand away, I don’t wish I was any different.“I don’t mean to be such a mess,” I say, my voice cracking. “I just feel so …” Ishake my head.“It’s wrong,” he says. “It doesn’t matter if your parents are in a betterplace—they aren’t here with you, and that’s wrong, Tris. It shouldn’t havehappened. It shouldn’t have happened to you. And anyone who tells you it’s okayis a liar.”A sob racks my body again, and he wraps his arms around me so tightly I find itdifficult to breathe, but it doesn’t matter. My dignified weeping gives way tofull-on ugliness, my mouth open and my face contorted and sounds like a dyinganimal coming from my throat. If this continues I will break apart, and maybethat would be better, maybe it would be better to shatter and bear nothing.He doesn’t speak for a long time, until I am quiet again.“Sleep,” he says. “I’ll fight the bad dreams off if they come to get you.”“With what?”“My bare hands, obviously.”I wrap my arm around his waist and take a deep breath of his shoulder. He smellslike sweat and fresh air and mint, from the salve he sometimes uses to relax hissore muscles. He smells safe, too, like sunlit walks in the orchard and silentbreakfasts in the dining hall. And in the moments before I drift off to sleep, Ialmost forget about our war-torn city and all the conflict that will come tofind us soon, if we don’t find it first.In the moments before I drift off to sleep, I hear him whisper, “I love you,Tris.”And maybe I would say it back, but I am too far gone."},{"pageContent":"[images/00017.jpg]THAT MORNING I wake up to the buzz of an electric razor. Tobias stands in frontof the mirror, his head tilted so he can see the corner of his jaw.I hug my knees, covered by the sheet, and watch him.“Good morning,” he says. “How did you sleep?”“Okay.” I get up, and as he tilts his head back to address his chin with therazor, I wrap my arms around him, pressing my forehead to his back where theDauntless tattoo peeks out from beneath his shirt.He sets the razor down and folds his hands over mine. Neither of us breaks thesilence. I listen to him breathe, and he strokes my fingers idly, the task athand forgotten.“I should go get ready,” I say after a while. I am reluctant to leave, but I amsupposed to work in the laundry rooms, and I don’t want the Amity to say I’m notfulfilling my part of the deal they offered us.“I’ll get you something to wear,” he says.I walk barefoot down the hallway a few minutes later, wearing the shirt I sleptin and a pair of shorts Tobias borrowed from the Amity. When I get back to mybedroom, Peter is standing next to my bed.Instinct makes me straighten up and search the room for a blunt object.“Get out,” I say as steadily as I can. But it’s hard to keep my voice fromshaking. I can’t help but remember the look in his eyes as he held me over thechasm by my throat or slammed me against the wall in the Dauntless compound.He turns to look at me. Lately when he looks at me it’s without his usualmalice—instead he just seems exhausted, his posture slouched, his wounded arm ina sling. But I am not fooled.“What are you doing in my room?”He walks closer to me. “What are you doing stalking Marcus? I saw you afterbreakfast yesterday.”I match his stare with my own. “That’s none of your business. Get out.”“I’m here because I don’t know why you get to keep track of that hard drive,” hesays. “It’s not like you’re particularly stable these days.”“I’m unstable?” I laugh. “I find that a little funny, coming from you.”Peter pinches his lips together and says nothing.I narrow my eyes. “Why are you so interested in the hard drive anyway?”“I’m not stupid,” he says. “I know it contains more than the simulation data.”“No, you aren’t stupid, are you?” I say. “You think if you deliver it to theErudite, they’ll forgive your indiscretion and let you back in their goodgraces.”“I don’t want to be back in their good graces,” he says, stepping forward again.“If I had, I wouldn’t have helped you in the Dauntless compound.”I jab his sternum with my index finger, digging in my fingernail. “You helped mebecause you didn’t want me to shoot you again.”“I may not be an Abnegation-loving faction traitor.” He seizes my finger. “Butno one gets to control me, especially not the Erudite.”I yank my hand back, twisting so that he won’t be able to hold on. My hands aresweaty.“I don’t expect you to understand.” I wipe my hands on the hem of my shirt as Iinch toward the dresser. “I’m sure if it had been Candor and not Abnegation thatgot attacked, you would have just let your family get shot between the eyeswithout protest. But I’m not like that.”“Careful what you say about my family, Stiff.” He moves with me, toward thedresser, but I carefully shift so that I stand between him and the drawers. I’mnot going to reveal the hard drive’s location by getting it out while he’s inhere, but I don’t want to leave the path to it clear, either.His eyes shift to the dresser behind me, to the left side, where the hard driveis hidden. I frown at him, and then notice something I didn’t before: arectangular bulge in one of his pockets.“Give it to me,” I say. “Now.”“No.”“Give it to me, or so help me, I will kill you in your sleep.”He smirks. “If only you could see how ridiculous you look when you threatenpeople. Like a little girl telling me she’s going to strangle me with her jumprope.”I start toward him, and he shifts back, into the hallway.“Don’t call me ‘little girl.’”“I’ll call you whatever I want.”I jerk into action, aiming my left fist where I know it will hurt the worst: atthe bullet wound in his arm. He dodges the punch, but instead of trying again, Iseize his arm as hard as I can and wrench it to the side. Peter screams at thetop of his lungs, and while he’s distracted by the pain, I kick him hard in theknee, and he falls to the ground.People rush into the hallway, wearing gray and black and yellow and red. Petersurges toward me in a half crouch, and punches me in the stomach. I hunch over,but the pain doesn’t stop me—I let out something between a groan and a scream,and launch myself at him, my left elbow pulled back near my mouth so that I canslam it into his face.One of the Amity grabs me by the arms and half lifts, half pulls me away fromPeter. The wound in my shoulder throbs, but I hardly feel it through the pulseof adrenaline. I strain toward him and try to ignore the stunned faces of theAmity and the Abnegation—and Tobias—around me, and the woman kneels next toPeter, whispering words in a soothing tone of voice. I try to ignore his groansof pain and the guilt stabbing at my stomach. I hate him. I don’t care. I hatehim.“Tris, calm down!” Tobias says.“He has the hard drive!” I yell. “He stole it from me! He has it!”Tobias walks over to Peter, ignoring the woman crouched beside him, and presseshis foot into Peter’s rib cage to keep him in place. He then reaches intoPeter’s pocket and takes out the hard drive.Tobias says to him—very quietly—“We won’t be in a safe house forever, and thiswasn’t very smart of you.” Then he turns toward me and adds, “Not very smart ofyou, either. Do you want to get us kicked out?”I scowl. The Amity man with his hand on my arm starts to pull me down thehallway. I try to wrench my body out of his grasp.“What do you think you’re doing? Let go of me!”“You violated the terms of our peace agreement,” he says gently. “We must followprotocol.”“Just go,” says Tobias. “You need to cool down.”I search the faces of the crowd that has gathered. No one argues with Tobias.Their eyes skirt mine. So I allow two Amity men to escort me down the hallway.“Watch your step,” one of them says. “The floorboards are uneven here.”My head pounds, a sign that I am calming down. The graying Amity man opens adoor on the left. A label on the door says CONFLICT ROOM.“Are you putting me in time-out or something?” I scowl. That is something theAmity would do: put me in time-out, and then teach me to do cleansing breaths orthink positive thoughts.The room is so bright I have to squint to see. The opposite wall has largewindows that look out over the orchard. Despite this, the room feels small,probably because the ceiling, like the walls and floor, is also covered withwooden boards.“Please sit,” the older man says, gesturing toward the stool in the middle ofthe room. It, like all other furniture in the Amity compound, is made ofunpolished wood, and looks sturdy, like it is still attached to the earth. I donot sit.“The fight is over,” I say. “I won’t do it again. Not here.”“We have to follow protocol,” the younger man says. “Please sit, and we’lldiscuss what happened, and then we’ll let you go.”All their voices are so soft. Not hushed, like the Abnegation speak, alwaystreading holy ground and trying not to disturb. Soft, soothing, low—I wonder,then, if that is something they teach their initiates here. How best to speak,move, smile, to encourage peace.I don’t want to sit down, but I do, perched on the edge of the chair so I canget up fast, if necessary. The younger man stands in front of me. Hinges creakbehind me. I look over my shoulder—the older man is fumbling with something on acounter behind me.“What are you doing?”“I am making tea,” he says.“I don’t think tea is really the solution to this.”“Then tell us,” the younger man says, drawing my attention back to the windows.He smiles at me. “What do you believe is the solution?”“Throwing Peter out of this compound.”“It seems to me,” the man says gently, “that you are the one who attackedhim—indeed, that you are the one who shot him in the arm.”“You have no idea what he did to deserve those things.” My cheeks get hot againand mimic my heartbeat. “He tried to kill me. And someone else—he stabbedsomeone else in the eye … with a butter knife. He is evil. I had every rightto—”I feel a sharp pain in my neck. Dark spots cover the man in front of me,obscuring my view of his face.“I’m sorry, dear,” he says. “We are just following protocol.”The older man is holding a syringe. A few drops of whatever he injected me withare still in it. They are bright green, the color of grass. I blink rapidly, andthe dark spots disappear, but the world still swims before me, like I am tiltingforward and back in a rocking chair.“How do you feel?” the younger man says.“I feel …” Angry, I was about to say. Angry with Peter, angry with the Amity.But that’s not true, is it? I smile. “I feel good. I feel a little like … likeI’m floating. Or swaying. How do you feel?”“Dizziness is a side effect of the serum. You may want to rest this afternoon.And I’m feeling well. Thank you for asking,” he says. “You may leave now, if youwould like.”“Can you tell me where to find Tobias?” I say. When I imagine his face,affection for him bubbles up inside me, and all I want to do is kiss him. “Four,I mean. He’s handsome, isn’t he? I don’t really know why he likes me so much.I’m not very nice, am I?”“Not most of the time, no,” the man says. “But I think you could be, if youtried.”“Thank you,” I say. “That’s nice of you to say.”“I think you’ll find him in the orchard,” he says. “I saw him go outside afterthe fight.”I laugh a little. “The fight. What a silly thing …”And it does seem like a silly thing, slamming your fist into someone else’sbody. Like a caress, but too hard. A caress is much nicer. Maybe I should haverun my hand along Peter’s arm instead. That would have felt better to both ofus. My knuckles wouldn’t ache right now.I get up and steer myself toward the door. I have to lean against the wall forbalance, but it’s sturdy, so I don’t mind. I stumble down the hallway, gigglingat my inability to balance. I’m clumsy again, just like I was when I wasyounger. My mother used to smile at me and say, “Be careful where you put yourfeet, Beatrice. I don’t want you to hurt yourself.”I walk outside and the green on the trees seems greener, so potent I can almosttaste it. Maybe I can taste it, and it is like the grass I decided to chew whenI was a child just to see what it was like. I almost fall down the stairsbecause of the swaying and burst into laughter when the grass tickles my barefeet. I wander toward the orchard.“Four!” I call out. Why am I calling out a number? Oh yes. Because that’s hisname. I call out again, “Four! Where are you?”“Tris?” says a voice from the trees on my right. It almost sounds like the treeis talking to me. I giggle, but of course it’s just Tobias, ducking under abranch.I run toward him, and the ground lurches to the side, so I almost fall. His handtouches my waist, steadies me. The touch sends a shock through my body, and allmy insides burn like his fingers ignited them. I pull closer to him, pressing mybody against his, and lift my head to kiss him.“What did they—” he starts, but I stop him with my lips. He kisses me back, buttoo quickly, so I sigh heavily.“That was lame,” I say. “Okay, no it wasn’t, but …”I stand on my tiptoes to kiss him again, and he presses his finger to my lips tostop me.“Tris,” he says. “What did they do to you? You’re acting like a lunatic.”“That’s not very nice of you to say,” I say. “They put me in a good mood, that’sall. And now I really want to kiss you, so if you could just relax—”“I’m not going to kiss you. I’m going to figure out what’s going on,” he says.I pout my lower lip for a second, but then I grin as the pieces come together inmy mind.“That’s why you like me!” I exclaim. “Because you’re not very nice either! Itmakes so much more sense now.”“Come on,” he says. “We’re going to see Johanna.”“I like you, too.”“That’s encouraging,” he replies flatly. “Come on. Oh, for God’s sake. I’ll justcarry you.”He swings me into his arms, one arm under my knees and the other around my back.I wrap my arms around his neck and plant a kiss on his cheek. Then I discoverthat the air feels nice on my feet when I kick them, so I move my feet up anddown as he walks us toward the building where Johanna works.When we reach her office, she is sitting behind a desk with a stack of paper infront of her, chewing on a pencil eraser. She looks up at us, and her mouthdrifts open slightly. A hunk of dark hair covers the left side of her face.“You really shouldn’t cover up your scar,” I say. “You look prettier with yourhair out of your face.”Tobias sets me down too heavily. The impact is jarring and hurts my shoulder alittle, but I like the sound my feet made when they hit the floor. I laugh, butneither Johanna nor Tobias laughs with me. Strange.“What did you do to her?” Tobias says, terse. “What in God’s name did you do?”“I …” Johanna frowns at me. “They must have given her too much. She’s verysmall; they probably didn’t take her height and weight into account.”“They must have given her too much of what?” he says.“You have a nice voice,” I say.“Tris,” he says, “please be quiet.”“The peace serum,” Johanna says. “In small doses, it has a mild, calming effectand improves the mood. The only side effect is some slight dizziness. Weadminister it to members of our community who have trouble keeping the peace.”Tobias snorts. “I’m not an idiot. Every member of your community has troublekeeping the peace, because they’re all human. You probably dump it into thewater supply.”Johanna does not respond for a few seconds. She folds her hands in front of her.“Clearly you know that is not the case, or this conflict would not haveoccurred,” she says. “But whatever we agree to do here, we do together, as afaction. If I could give the serum to everyone in this city, I would. You wouldcertainly not be in the situation you are in now if I had.”“Oh, definitely,” he says. “Drugging the entire population is the best solutionto our problem. Great plan.”“Sarcasm is not kind, Four,” she says gently. “Now, I am sorry about the mistakein giving too much to Tris, I really am. But she violated the terms of ouragreement, and I’m afraid that you might not be able to stay here much longer asa result. The conflict between her and the boy—Peter—is not something we canforget.”“Don’t worry,” says Tobias. “We intend to leave as soon as humanly possible.”“Good,” she says with a small smile. “Peace between Amity and Dauntless can onlyhappen when we maintain our distance from each other.”“That explains a lot.”“Excuse me?” she says. “What are you insinuating?”“It explains,” he says, gritting his teeth, “why, under a pretense ofneutrality—as if such a thing is possible!—you have left us to die at the handsof the Erudite.”Johanna sighs quietly and looks out the window. Beyond it is a small courtyardwith vines growing in it. The vines creep onto the window’s corners, like theyare trying to come in and join the conversation.“The Amity wouldn’t do something like that,” I say. “That’s mean.”“It is for the sake of peace that we remain uninvolved—” Johanna begins.“Peace.” Tobias almost spits the word. “Yes, I’m sure it will be very peacefulwhen we are all either dead or cowering in submission under the threat of mindcontrol or stuck in an endless simulation.”Johanna’s face contorts, and I mimic her, to see what it feels like to have myface that way. It doesn’t feel very good. I’m not sure why she did it to beginwith.She says slowly, “The decision was not mine to make. If it was, perhaps we wouldbe having a different conversation right now.”“Are you saying you disagree with them?”“I am saying,” she says, “that it isn’t my place to disagree with my factionpublicly, but I might, in the privacy of my own heart.”“Tris and I will be gone in two days,” says Tobias. “I hope your faction doesn’tchange their decision to make this compound a safe house.”“Our decisions are not easily unmade. What about Peter?”“You’ll have to deal with him separately,” he says. “Because he won’t be comingwith us.”Tobias takes my hand, and his skin feels nice against mine, though it’s notsmooth or soft. I smile apologetically at Johanna, and her expression remainsunchanged.“Four,” she says. “If you and your friends would like to remain … untouched byour serum, you may want to avoid the bread.”Tobias says thank you over his shoulder as we make our way down the hallwaytogether, me skipping every other step."},{"pageContent":"[images/00047.jpg]THE SERUM WEARS off five hours later, when the sun is just beginning to set.Tobias shut me in my room for the rest of the day, checking on me every hour.This time when he comes in, I am sitting on the bed, glaring at the wall.“Thank God,” he says, pressing his forehead to the door. “I was beginning tothink it would never wear off and I would have to leave you here to … smellflowers, or whatever you wanted to do while you were on that stuff.”“I’ll kill them,” I say. “I will kill them.”“Don’t bother. We’re leaving soon anyway,” he says, closing the door behind him.He takes the hard drive from his back pocket. “I thought we could hide thisbehind your dresser.”“That’s where it was before.”“Yeah, and that’s why Peter won’t look for it here again.” Tobias pulls thedresser away from the wall with one hand and wedges the hard drive behind itwith the other.“Why couldn’t I fight the peace serum?” I say. “If my brain is weird enough toresist the simulation serum, why not this one?”“I don’t know, really,” he says. He drops down next to me on the bed, jostlingthe mattress. “Maybe in order to fight off a serum, you have to want to.”“Well, obviously I wanted to,” I say, frustrated, but without conviction. Did Iwant to? Or was it nice to forget about anger, forget about pain, forget abouteverything for a few hours?“Sometimes,” he says, sliding his arm across my shoulders, “people just want tobe happy, even if it’s not real.”He’s right. Even now, this peace between us comes from not talking aboutthings—about Will, or my parents, or me almost shooting him in the head, orMarcus. But I do not dare to disturb it with the truth, because I am too busyclinging to it for support.“You might be right,” I say quietly.“Are you conceding?” he says, his mouth falling open with mock surprise. “Seemslike that serum did you some good after all….”I shove him as hard as I can. “Take that back. Take it back now.”“Okay, okay!” He puts up his hands. “It’s just … I’m not very nice either, youknow. That’s why I like you so—”“Out!” I shout, pointing at the door.Laughing to himself, Tobias kisses my cheek and leaves the room. That evening, I am too embarrassed by what happened to go to dinner, so I spendthe time in the branches of an apple tree at the far end of the orchard, pickingripe apples. I climb as high as I dare to get them, muscles burning. I havediscovered that sitting still leaves little spaces for the grief to get in, so Istay busy.I am wiping my forehead with the hem of my shirt, standing on a branch, when Ihear the sound. It is faint, at first, joining the buzz of cicadas. I standstill to listen, and after a moment, I realize what it is: cars.The Amity own about a dozen trucks that they use for transporting goods, butthey only do that on weekends. The back of my neck tingles. If it isn’t theAmity, it’s probably the Erudite. But I have to be sure.I grab the branch above me with both hands, but pull myself up with only my leftarm. I’m surprised I’m still able to do that. I stand hunched, twigs and leavestangled in my hair. A few apples fall to the ground when I shift my weight.Apple trees aren’t very tall; I may not be able to see far enough.I use the nearby branches as steps, with my hands to steady me, twisting andleaning around the tree’s maze. I remember climbing the Ferris wheel on thepier, my muscles shaking, my hands throbbing. I am wounded now, but stronger,and the climbing feels easier.The branches get thinner, weaker. I lick my lips and look at the next one. Ineed to climb as high as possible, but the branch I’m aiming for is short andlooks pliable. I put my foot on it, testing its strength. It bends, but holds. Istart to lift myself up, to put the other foot down, and the branch snaps.I gasp as I fall back, seizing the tree trunk at the last second. This will haveto be high enough. I stand on my tiptoes and squint in the direction of thesound.At first I see nothing but a stretch of farmland, a strip of empty ground, thefence, and the fields and beginnings of buildings that lie beyond it. Butapproaching the gate are a few moving specks—silver, when the light catchesthem. Cars with black roofs—solar panels, which means only one thing. Erudite.A breath hisses between my teeth. I don’t allow myself to think; I just put onefoot down, then the other, so fast that bark peels off the branches and driftstoward the ground. As soon as my feet touch the earth, I run.I count the rows of trees as I pass them. Seven, eight. The branches dip low,and I pass just beneath them. Nine, ten. I hold my right arm against my chest asI sprint faster, the bullet wound in my shoulder throbbing with each footstep.Eleven, twelve.When I reach the thirteenth row, I throw my body to the right, down one of theaisles. The trees are close together in the thirteenth row. Their branches growinto one another, creating a maze of leaves and twigs and apples.My lungs sting from a lack of oxygen, but I am not far from the end of theorchard. Sweat runs into my eyebrows. I reach the dining hall and throw open thedoor, shoving my way through a group of Amity men, and he is there; Tobias sitsat one end of the cafeteria with Peter and Caleb and Susan. I can barely seethem between the spots on my vision, but Tobias touches my shoulder.“Erudite,” is all I manage to say.“Coming here?” he says.I nod.“Do we have time to run?”I am not sure about that.By now, the Abnegation at the other end of the table are paying attention. Theygather around us.“Why do we need to run?” says Susan. “The Amity established this place as a safehouse. No conflict allowed.”“The Amity will have trouble enforcing that policy,” says Marcus. “How do youstop conflict without conflict?”Susan nods.“But we can’t leave,” Peter says. “We don’t have time. They’ll see us.”“Tris has a gun,” Tobias says. “We can try to fight our way out.”He starts toward the dormitory.“Wait,” I say. “I have an idea.” I scan the crowd of Abnegation. “Disguises. TheErudite don’t know for sure that we’re still here. We can pretend to be Amity.”“Those of us who aren’t dressed like the Amity should go to the dormitories,then,” Marcus says. “The rest of you, put your hair down; try to mimic theirbehavior.”The Abnegation who are dressed in gray leave the dining hall in a pack and crossthe courtyard to the guests’ dormitory. Once inside, I run to my bedroom, get onmy hands and knees, and reach under the mattress for the gun.I feel around for a few seconds before I find it, and when I do, my throatpinches, and I can’t swallow. I don’t want to touch the gun. I don’t want totouch it again.Come on, Tris. I shove the gun under the waistband of my red pants. It is luckythey are so baggy. I notice the vials of healing salve and pain medicine on thebedside table and shove them in my pocket, just in case we do manage to escape.Then I reach behind the dresser for the hard drive.If the Erudite catch us—which is likely—they will search us, and I don’t want tojust hand over the attack simulation again. But this hard drive also containsthe surveillance footage from the attack. The record of our losses. Of myparents’ deaths. The only piece of them I have left. And because the Abnegationdon’t take photographs, the only documentation I have of how they looked.Years from now, when my memories begin to fade, what will I have to remind me ofwhat they looked like? Their faces will change in my mind. I will never see themagain.Don’t be stupid. It’s not important.I squeeze the hard drive so tightly it hurts.Then why does it feel so important?“Don’t be stupid,” I say aloud. I grit my teeth and grab the lamp from mybedside table. I yank the plug from the socket, throw the lampshade onto thebed, and crouch over the hard drive. Blinking tears from my eyes, I slam thebase of the lamp into it, creating a dent.I bring the lamp down again, and again, and again, until the hard drive cracksand pieces of it spread across the floor. Then I kick the shards under thedresser, put the lamp back, and walk into the hallway, wiping my eyes with theback of my hand.A few minutes later, a small crowd of gray-clad men and women—and Peter—stand inthe hallway, sorting through stacks of clothes.“Tris,” says Caleb. “You’re still wearing gray.”I pinch my father’s shirt, and hesitate.“It’s Dad’s,” I say. If I change out of it, I will have to leave it behind. Ibite my lip so that the pain will steady me. I have to get rid of it. It’s justa shirt. That’s all it is.“I’ll put it on under mine,” Caleb says. “They’ll never see it.”I nod and grab a red shirt from the dwindling pile of clothes. It is largeenough to conceal the bulge of the gun. I duck into a nearby room to change, andhand off the gray shirt to Caleb when I get to the hallway. The door is open,and through it I see Tobias stuffing Abnegation clothes into the trash bin.“Do you think the Amity will lie for us?” I ask him, leaning out the opendoorway.“To prevent conflict?” Tobias nods. “Absolutely.”He wears a red collared shirt and a pair of jeans that are fraying at the knee.The combination looks ridiculous on him.“Nice shirt,” I say.He wrinkles his nose at me. “It was the only thing that covered up the necktattoo, okay?”I smile nervously. I forgot about my tattoos, but the shirt hides them wellenough.The Erudite cars pull up to the compound. There are five of them, all silverwith black roofs. Their engines seem to purr as the wheels bump over unevenground. I slip just inside the building, leaving the door open behind me, andTobias busies himself with the latch on the trash bin.The cars all pull to a stop, and the doors pop open, revealing at least five menand women in Erudite blue.And about fifteen in Dauntless black.When the Dauntless come closer, I see strips of blue fabric wrapped around theirarms that can only signify their allegiance to Erudite. The faction thatenslaved their minds.Tobias takes my hand and leads me into the dormitory.“I didn’t think our faction would be that stupid,” he says. “You have the gun,right?”“Yes,” I say. “But there’s no guarantee I can fire it with any accuracy with myleft hand.”“You should work on that,” he says. Always an instructor.“I will,” I say. I shake a little as I add, “If we live.”His hands skim my bare arms. “Just bounce a little when you walk,” he says,kissing my forehead, “and pretend you’re afraid of their guns”—another kissbetween my eyebrows—“and act like the shrinking violet you could never be”—akiss on my cheek—“and you’ll be fine.”“Okay,” I say. My hands tremble as I grip his shirt collar. I pull his mouthdown to mine.A bell sounds, once, twice, three times. It is a summons to the dining hall,where the Amity gather for less formal occasions than the meeting we attended.We join the crowd of Abnegation-turned-Amity.I pull pins from Susan’s hair—the hairstyle is too severe for Amity. She givesme a small, grateful smile as her hair falls on her shoulders, the first time Ihave ever seen it that way. It softens her square jaw.I am supposed to be braver than the Abnegation, but they don’t seem as worriedas I am. They offer each other smiles and walk in silence—in too much silence. Iwedge my way between them and jab one of the older women in the shoulder.“Tell the kids to play tag,” I say to her.“Tag?” she says.“They’re acting respectful and … Stiff,” I say, cringing as I say the word thatwas my nickname in Dauntless. “And Amity kids would be causing a ruckus. Just doit, okay?”The woman touches one Abnegation child on the shoulder and whispers something tohim, and a few seconds later a small group of children run down the hallway,dodging Amity feet and yelling, “I touched you! You’re it!” “No, that was mysleeve!”Caleb catches on, jabbing Susan in the ribs so she shrieks with laughter. I tryto relax, injecting a bounce into my step as Tobias suggested, letting my armsswing as I turn corners. It is amazing how pretending to be in a differentfaction changes everything—even the way I walk. That must be why it’s so strangethat I could easily belong in three of them.We catch up to the Amity in front of us as we cross the courtyard to the dininghall and disperse among them. I keep Tobias in my peripheral vision, not wantingto stray too far from him. The Amity don’t ask questions; they just let usdissolve into their faction.A pair of Dauntless traitors stand by the door to the dining hall, their guns inhand, and I stiffen. It feels real to me, suddenly, that I am unarmed and beingherded into a building surrounded by Erudite and Dauntless, and if they discoverme, there will be nowhere to run. They will shoot me on the spot.I consider making a break for it. But where would I go that they could not catchme? I try to breathe normally. I am almost past them—don’t look, don’t look. Afew steps away—eyes away, away.Susan loops her arm through mine.“I’m telling you a joke,” she says, “that you find very funny.”I cover my hand with my mouth and force a giggle that sounds high-pitched andforeign, but judging by the smile she gives me, it was believable. We hang oneach other the way Amity girls do, glancing at the Dauntless and then gigglingagain. I am amazed by how I manage to do it, with the leaden feeling inside me.“Thank you,” I mutter once we’re inside.“You’re welcome,” she replies.Tobias sits across from me at one of the long tables, and Susan sits next to me.The rest of the Abnegation spread throughout the room, and Caleb and Peter are afew seats down from me.I tap my fingers on my knees as we wait for something to happen. For a long timewe just sit there, and I pretend to be listening to an Amity girl telling astory on my left. But every so often I look at Tobias, and he looks back at me,like we’re passing fear back and forth between us.Finally Johanna walks in with an Erudite woman. Her bright blue shirt seems toglow against her skin, which is dark brown. She searches the room as she speaksto Johanna. I hold my breath as her eyes find me—and then let it out when shemoves on without a moment’s hesitation. She did not recognize me.At least, not yet.Someone bangs on a tabletop, and the room goes quiet. This is it. This is themoment she either hands us over, or doesn’t.“Our Erudite and Dauntless friends are looking for some people,” Johanna says.“Several members of Abnegation, three members of Dauntless, and a former Eruditeinitiate.” She smiles. “In the interest of full cooperation, I told them thatthe people they were looking for were, in fact, here, but have since moved on.They would like permission to search the premises, which means we have to vote.Does anyone object to a search?”The tension in her voice suggests that if anyone does object, they should keeptheir mouth shut. I don’t know if the Amity pick up on that kind of thing, butno one says anything. Johanna nods to the Erudite woman.“Three of you stick around,” the woman says to the Dauntless guards clustered bythe entrance. “The rest of you, search all the buildings and report back if youfind anything. Go.”There is so much they could find. The pieces of the hard drive. Clothes I forgotto throw out. A suspicious lack of trinkets and decorations in our livingspaces. I feel my pulse behind my eyes as the three Dauntless soldiers whostayed behind pace up and down the rows of tables.The back of my neck tingles as one of them walks behind me, his footsteps loudand heavy. Not for the first time in my life, I’m glad that I’m small and plain.I don’t draw people’s eyes to me.But Tobias does. He wears his pride in his posture, in the way his eyes claimeverything they land on. That is not an Amity trait. It can only be a Dauntlessone.The Dauntless woman walking toward him looks at him right away. Her eyes narrowas she walks closer, and then stops directly behind him.I wish the collar of his shirt were higher. I wish he didn’t have so manytattoos. I wish …“Your hair is pretty short for an Amity,” she says.… he did not cut his hair like the Abnegation.“It’s hot,” he says.The excuse might work if he knew how to deliver it, but he says it with a snap.She stretches out her hand and, with her index finger, pulls back the collar ofhis shirt to see his tattoo.And Tobias moves.He grabs the woman’s wrist, yanking her forward so she loses her balance. Shehits her head against the edge of the table and falls. Across the room, a gungoes off, someone screams, and everyone dives under the tables or crouches nextto the benches.Everyone except me. I sit where I was before the gunshot sounded, clutching theedge of the table. I know that’s where I am, but I don’t see the cafeteriaanymore. I see the alley I escaped down after my mother died. I stare at the gunin my hands, at the smooth skin between Will’s eyebrows.A small sound gurgles in my throat. It would have been a scream if my teeth hadnot been clamped shut. The flash of memory fades, but I still can’t move.Tobias grabs the Dauntless woman by the back of her neck and wrenches her to herfeet. He has her gun in his hand. He uses her to shield him as he fires over herright shoulder at the Dauntless soldier across the room.“Tris!” he shouts. “A little help here?”I pull my shirt up just far enough to reach the handle of the gun, and myfingers meet metal. It feels so cold that it hurts my fingertips, but that can’tbe; it’s so hot in here. A Dauntless man at the end of the aisle aims his ownrevolver at me. The black spot at the end of the barrel grows around me, and Ican hear my heart but nothing else.Caleb lunges forward and grabs my gun. He holds it in both hands and fires atthe knees of the Dauntless man who stands just feet away from him.The Dauntless man screams and collapses, his hands clutching his leg, whichgives Tobias the opportunity to shoot him in the head. His pain is momentary.My entire body is trembling and I can’t stop it. Tobias still has the Dauntlesswoman by the throat, but this time, he aims his gun at the Erudite woman.“Say another word,” says Tobias, “and I’ll shoot.”The Erudite woman’s mouth is open, but she doesn’t speak.“Whoever’s with us should start running,” Tobias says, his voice filling theroom.All at once, the Abnegation rise from their places under tables and benches, andstart toward the door. Caleb pulls me up from the bench. I start toward thedoor.Then I see something. A twitch, a flicker of movement. The Erudite woman lifts asmall gun, points it at a man in a yellow shirt in front of me. Instinct, notpresence of mind, pushes me into a dive. My hands collide with the man, and thebullet hits the wall instead of him, instead of me.“Put the gun down,” says Tobias, pointing his revolver at the Erudite woman. “Ihave very good aim, and I’m betting that you don’t.”I blink a few times to get the blurriness out of my eyes. Peter stares back atme. I just saved his life. He does not thank me, and I don’t acknowledge him.The Erudite woman drops her gun. Together Peter and I walk toward the door.Tobias follows us, walking backward so he can keep his gun on the Erudite woman.At the last second before he passes through the threshold, he slams the doorbetween him and her.And we all run.We sprint down the center aisle of the orchard in a breathless pack. The nightair is heavy as a blanket and smells like rain. Shouts follow us. Car doorsslam. I run faster than I can possibly run, like I’m breathing adrenalineinstead of air. The purr of engines chases me into the trees. Tobias’s handcloses around mine.We run through a cornfield in a long line. By then, the cars have caught up tous. The headlights creep through the tall stalks, illuminating a leaf here, anear of corn there.“Split up!” someone yells, and it sounds like Marcus.We divide and spread through the field like spilling water. I grab Caleb’s arm.I hear Susan gasping behind Caleb.We crash over cornstalks. The heavy leaves cut my cheeks and arms. I starebetween Tobias’s shoulder blades as we run. I hear a heavy thump and a scream.There are screams everywhere, to my left, to my right. Gunshots. The Abnegationare dying again, dying like they were when I pretended to be under thesimulation. And all I’m doing is running.Finally we reach the fence. Tobias runs along it, pushing it until he finds ahole. He holds the chain links back so Caleb, Susan, and I can crawl through.Before we start running again, I stop and look back at the cornfield we justleft. I see headlights distantly glowing. But I don’t hear anything.“Where are the others?” whispers Susan.I say, “Gone.”Susan sobs. Tobias pulls me to his side roughly, and starts forward. My faceburns with shallow cuts from the corn leaves, but my eyes are dry. TheAbnegation deaths are just another weight I am unable to set down.We stay away from the dirt road the Erudite and Dauntless took to get to theAmity compound, following the train tracks toward the city. There is nowhere tohide out here, no trees or buildings that can shield us, but it doesn’t matter.The Erudite can’t drive through the fence anyway, and it will take them a whileto reach the gate.“I have to … stop …” says Susan from somewhere in the darkness behind me.We stop. Susan collapses to the ground, crying, and Caleb crouches next to her.Tobias and I look toward the city, which is still illuminated, because it’s notmidnight yet. I want to feel something. Fear, anger, grief. But I don’t. All Ifeel is the need to keep moving.Tobias turns toward me.“What was that, Tris?” he says.“What?” I say, and I am ashamed of how weak my voice sounds. I don’t knowwhether he’s talking about Peter or what came before or something else.“You froze! Someone was about to kill you and you just sat there!” He is yellingnow. “I thought I could rely on you at least to save your own life!”“Hey!” says Caleb. “Give her a break, all right?”“No,” says Tobias, staring at me. “She doesn’t need a break.” His voice softens.“What happened?”He still believes that I am strong. Strong enough that I don’t need hissympathy. I used to think he was right, but now I am not sure. I clear mythroat.“I panicked,” I say. “It won’t happen again.”He raises an eyebrow.“It won’t,” I say again, louder this time.“Okay.” He looks unconvinced. “We have to get somewhere safe. They’ll regroupand start looking for us.”“You think they care that much about us?” I say.“Us, yes,” he says. “We were probably the only ones they were really after,apart from Marcus, who is most likely dead.”I don’t know how I expected him to say it—with relief, maybe, because Marcus,his father and the menace of his life, is finally gone. Or with pain andsadness, because his father might have been killed, and sometimes grief doesn’tmake much sense. But he says it like it’s just a fact, like the direction we’removing or the time of day.“Tobias …” I start to say, but then I realize I don’t know what comes after it.“Time to go,” Tobias says over his shoulder.Caleb coaxes Susan to her feet. She moves only with the help of his arm acrossher back, pressing her forward.I didn’t realize until that moment that Dauntless initiation had taught me animportant lesson: how to keep going."},{"pageContent":"[images/00048.jpg]WE DECIDE TO follow the railroad tracks to the city, because none of us is goodat navigation. I walk from tie to tie, Tobias balances on the rail, wobblingonly occasionally, and Caleb and Susan shuffle behind us. I twitch at everyunidentified noise, tensing until I realize it is just the wind, or the squeakof Tobias’s shoes on the rail. I wish we could keep running, but it’s a featthat my legs are even moving at this point.Then I hear a low groan from the rails.I bend down and press my palms to the rail, closing my eyes to focus on thefeeling of the metal beneath my hands. The vibration feels like a sigh goingthrough my body. I stare between Susan’s knees down the tracks and see no trainlight, but that doesn’t mean anything. The train could be running with no hornsand no lamps to announce its arrival.I see the gleam of a small train car, far away now but approaching fast.“It’s coming,” I say. It is an effort to get to my feet when all I want to do issit down, but I do, brushing my hands on my jeans. “I think we should get on.”“Even if it’s run by the Erudite?” says Caleb.“If the Erudite were running the train, they would have taken it to the Amitycompound to look for us,” Tobias says. “I think it’s worth the risk. We’ll beable to hide in the city. Here we’re just waiting for them to find us.”We all get off the tracks. Caleb gives Susan step-by-step instructions forgetting on a moving train, the way only a former Erudite can. I watch the firstcar approach; listen to the rhythmic bump of the car over the ties, the whisperof metal wheel against metal rail.As the first car passes me, I start to run. I ignore the burning in my legs.Caleb helps Susan into a middle car first, then jumps in himself. I take a quickbreath and throw my body to the right, slamming into the floor of the car withmy legs dangling over the edge. Caleb grabs my left arm and pulls me in the restof the way. Tobias uses the handle to swing himself in after me.I look up, and stop breathing.Eyes glitter in the darkness. Dark shapes sit in the car, more numerous than weare.The factionless. The wind whistles through the car. Everyone is on their feet and armed—exceptSusan and me, who have no weapons. A factionless man with an eye patch has a gunpointed at Tobias. I wonder how he got it.Next to him, an older factionless woman holds a knife—the kind I used to cutbread with. Behind him, someone else holds a large plank of wood with a nailsticking out of it.“I’ve never seen the Amity armed before,” the factionless woman with the knifesays.The factionless man with the gun looks familiar. He wears tattered clothes indifferent colors—a black T-shirt with a torn Abnegation jacket over it, bluejeans mended with red thread, brown boots. All faction clothing is representedin the group before me: black Candor pants paired with black Dauntless shirts,yellow dresses with blue sweatshirts over them. Most items are torn or smudgedin some way, but some are not. Freshly stolen, I imagine.“They aren’t Amity,” the man with the gun says. “They’re Dauntless.”Then I recognize him: he is Edward, a fellow initiate who left Dauntless afterPeter attacked him with a butter knife. That is why he wears an eye patch.I remember steadying his head as he lay screaming on the floor, and cleaning theblood he left behind.“Hello, Edward,” I say.He inclines his head to me, but doesn’t lower his gun. “Tris.”“Whatever you are,” the woman says, “you’ll have to get off this train if youwant to stay alive.”“Please,” says Susan, her lip wobbling. Her eyes fill with tears. “We’ve beenrunning … and the rest of them are dead and I don’t …” She starts to sob again.“I don’t think I can keep going, I …”I get the strange urge to hit my head against the wall. Other people’s sobs makeme uncomfortable. It’s selfish of me, maybe.“We’re running from the Erudite,” says Caleb. “If we get off, it will be easierfor them to find us. So we would appreciate it if you let us ride into the citywith you.”“Yeah?” Edward tilts his head. “What have you ever done for us?”“I helped you when no one else would,” I say. “Remember?”“You, maybe. But the others?” says Edward. “Not so much.”Tobias steps forward, so Edward’s gun is almost against his throat.“My name is Tobias Eaton,” Tobias says. “I don’t think you want to push me offthis train.”The effect of the name on the people in the car is immediate and bewildering:they lower their weapons. They exchange meaningful looks.“Eaton? Really?” Edward says, eyebrows raised. “I have to admit, I did not seethat coming.” He clears his throat. “Fine, you can come. But when we get to thecity, you’ve got to come with us.”Then he smiles a little. “We know someone who’s been looking for you, TobiasEaton.” Tobias and I sit on the edge of the car with our legs dangling over the edge.“Do you know who it is?”Tobias nods.“Who, then?”“It’s hard to explain,” he says. “I have a lot to tell you.”I lean against him.“Yeah,” I say. “So do I.” I don’t know how much time passes before they tell us to get off. But when theydo, we are in the part of the city where the factionless live, about a mile fromwhere I grew up. I recognize each building we pass as one I walked by every timeI missed the bus home from school. The one with the broken bricks. The one witha fallen streetlight leaning against it.We stand in the doorway of the train car, all four of us in a line. Susanwhimpers.“What if we get hurt?” she says.I grab her hand. “We’ll jump together. You and me. I’ve done this a dozen timesand never got hurt.”She nods and squeezes my fingers so hard they hurt.“On three. One,” I say, “Two. Three.”I jump, and pull her with me. My feet slam into the ground and continue forward,but Susan just falls to the pavement and rolls onto her side. Aside from ascraped knee, though, she seems to be all right. The others jump off withoutdifficulty—even Caleb, who has only jumped from a train once before, as far as Iknow.I’m not sure who could know Tobias among the factionless. It could be Drew orMolly, who failed Dauntless initiation—but they didn’t even know Tobias’s realname, and besides, Edward probably would have killed them by now, judging by howready he was to shoot us. It must be someone from Abnegation, or from school.Susan seems to have calmed down. She walks on her own now, next to Caleb, andher cheeks are drying with no new tears to wet them.Tobias walks beside me, touching my shoulder lightly.“It’s been a while since I checked that shoulder,” he says. “How is it?”“Okay. I brought the pain medicine, luckily,” I say. I’m glad to talk aboutsomething light—as light as a wound can be, anyway. “I don’t think I’m lettingit heal very well. I keep using my arm or landing on it.”“There will be plenty of time for healing once all this is over.”“Yeah.” Or it won’t matter if I heal, I add silently, because I’ll be dead.“Here,” he says, taking a small knife from his back pocket and handing it to me.“Just in case.”I put it in my own pocket. I feel even more nervous now.The factionless lead us down the street and left into a grimy alleyway thatstinks of garbage. Rats scatter in front of us with squeaks of terror, and I seeonly their tails, slipping between mounds of waste, empty trash cans, soggycardboard boxes. I breathe through my mouth so I don’t throw up.Edward stops next to one of the crumbling brick buildings and forces a steeldoor open. I wince, half expecting the entire building to fall down if he pullstoo hard. The windows are so thick with grime that almost no light penetratesthem. We follow Edward into a dank room. In the flickering glow of a lantern, Isee … people.People sitting next to rolls of bedding. People prying open cans of food. Peoplesipping bottles of water. And children, weaving between the groups of adults,not confined to a particular color of clothing—factionless children.We are in a factionless storehouse, and the factionless, who are supposed to bescattered, isolated, and without community … are together inside it. Aretogether, like a faction.I don’t know what I expected of them, but I am surprised by how normal theyseem. They don’t fight one another or avoid one another. Some of them telljokes, others speak to each other quietly. Gradually, though, they all seem torealize that we aren’t supposed to be there.“Come on,” Edward says, bending his finger to beckon us toward him. “She’s backhere.”Stares and silence greet us as we follow Edward deeper into the building that issupposed to be abandoned. Finally I can’t contain my questions any longer.“What’s going on here? Why are you all together like this?”“You thought they—we—were all split up,” Edward says over his shoulder. “Well,they were, for a while. Too hungry to do much of anything except look for food.But then the Stiffs started giving them food, clothes, tools, everything. Andthey got stronger, and waited. They were like that when I found them, and theywelcomed me.”We walk into a dark hallway. I feel at home, in the dark and the quiet that arelike the tunnels in Dauntless headquarters. Tobias, however, winds a loosethread from his shirt around his finger, backward and forward, over and over. Heknows who we’re meeting, but I still have no idea. How is it I know this littleabout the boy who says he loves me—the boy whose real name is powerful enough tokeep us alive in a train car full of enemies?Edward stops at a metal door and pounds on it with his fist.“Wait, you said they were waiting?” says Caleb. “What were they waiting for,exactly?”“For the world to fall apart,” Edward says. “And now it has.”The door opens, and a severe-looking woman with a lazy eye stands in thedoorway. Her steady eye scans the four of us.“Strays?” she says.“Not hardly, Therese.” He jabs his thumb over his shoulder, at Tobias. “Thisone’s Tobias Eaton.”Therese stares at Tobias for a few seconds, then nods. “He certainly is. Holdon.”She shuts the door again. Tobias swallows hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing.“You know who she’s going to get, don’t you,” says Caleb to Tobias.“Caleb,” Tobias says. “Please shut up.”To my surprise, my brother suppresses his Erudite curiosity.The door opens again, and Therese steps back to let us in. We walk into an oldboiler room with machinery that emerges from the darkness so suddenly I hit itwith my knees and elbows. Therese leads us through the maze of metal to the backof the room, where several bulbs dangle from the ceiling over a table.A middle-aged woman stands behind the table. She has curly black hair and oliveskin. Her features are stern, so angular they almost make her unattractive, butnot quite.Tobias clutches my hand. At that moment I realize that he and the woman have thesame nose—hooked, a little too big on her face but the right size on his. Theyalso have the same strong jaw, distinct chin, spare upper lip, stick-out ears.Only her eyes are different—instead of blue, they are so dark they look black.“Evelyn,” he says, his voice shaking a little.Evelyn was the name of Marcus’s wife and Tobias’s mother. My grip on Tobias’shand loosens. Just days ago I was remembering her funeral. Her funeral. And nowshe stands in front of me, her eyes colder than the eyes of any Abnegation womanI’ve ever seen.“Hello.” She walks around the table, surveying him. “You look older.”“Yes, well. The passage of time tends to do that to a person.”He already knew she was alive. How long ago did he find out?She smiles. “So you’ve finally come—”“Not for the reason you think,” he interrupts her. “We were running fromErudite, and the only chance of escape we had required me to tell your poorlyarmed lackeys my name.”She must have made him angry somehow. But I can’t help but think that if Idiscovered my mother was alive after thinking she was dead for so long, I wouldnever speak to her the way Tobias speaks to his mother now, no matter what shehad done.The truth of that thought makes me ache. I push it aside and focus instead onwhat’s in front of me. On the table behind Evelyn is a large map with markersall over it. A map of the city, obviously, but I’m not sure what the markersmean. On the wall behind her is a chalkboard with a chart on it. I can’tdecipher the information in the chart; it’s written in shorthand I don’t know.“I see.” Evelyn’s smile remains, but without its former touch of amusement.“Introduce me to your fellow refugees, then.”Her eyes drift down to our joined hands. Tobias’s fingers spring apart. Hegestures to me first. “This is Tris Prior. Her brother, Caleb. And their friendSusan Black.”“Prior,” she says. “I know of several Priors, but none of them are named Tris.Beatrice, however …”“Well,” I say, “I know of several living Eatons, but none of them are namedEvelyn.”“Evelyn Johnson is the name I prefer. Particularly among a pack of Abnegation.”“Tris is the name I prefer,” I reply. “And we’re not Abnegation. Not all of us,anyway.”Evelyn gives Tobias a look. “Interesting friends you’ve made.”“Those are population counts?” says Caleb from behind me. He walks forward, hismouth open. “And … what? Factionless safe houses?” He points to the first lineon the chart, which reads 7………. Grn Hse. “I mean, these places, on the map?They’re safe houses, like this one, right?”“That’s a lot of questions,” says Evelyn, arching an eyebrow. I recognize theexpression. It belongs to Tobias—as does her distaste for questions. “Forsecurity purposes, I will not answer any of them. Anyway, it is time fordinner.”She gestures toward the door. Susan and Caleb start toward it, followed by me,and Tobias and his mother are last. We work our way through the maze ofmachinery again.“I’m not stupid,” she says in a low voice. “I know you want nothing to do withme—though I still don’t quite understand why—”Tobias snorts.“But,” she says, “I will extend my invitation again. We could use your helphere, and I know you are like-minded about the faction system—”“Evelyn,” Tobias says. “I chose Dauntless.”“Choices can be made again.”“What makes you think I’m interested in spending time anywhere near you?” hedemands. I hear his footsteps stop, and slow down so I can hear how sheresponds.“Because I’m your mother,” she says, and her voice almost breaks over the words,uncharacteristically vulnerable. “Because you’re my son.”“You really don’t get it,” he says. “You don’t have the vaguest conception ofwhat you’ve done to me.” He sounds breathless. “I don’t want to join up withyour little band of factionless. I want to get out of here as quickly aspossible.”“My little band of factionless is twice the size of Dauntless,” says Evelyn.“You would do well to take it seriously. Its actions may determine the future ofthis city.”With that, she walks ahead of him, and ahead of me. Her words echo in my mind:Twice the size of Dauntless. When did they become so large?Tobias looks at me, eyebrows lowered.“How long have you known?” I say.“About a year.” He slumps against the wall and closes his eyes. “She sent acoded message to me in Dauntless, telling me to meet her at the train yard. Idid, because I was curious, and there she was. Alive. It wasn’t a happy reunion,as you can probably guess.”“Why did she leave Abnegation?”“She had an affair.” He shakes his head. “And no wonder, since my father …” Heshakes his head again. “Well, let’s just say Marcus wasn’t any nicer to her thanhe was to me.”“Is … that why you’re angry with her? Because she was unfaithful to him?”“No,” he says too sternly, his eyes opening. “No, that’s not why I’m angry.”I walk toward him as if approaching a wild animal, each footstep careful on thecement floor. “Then why?”“She had to leave my father, I get that,” he says. “But did she think of takingme with her?”I purse my lips. “Oh. She left you with him.”She left him alone with his worst nightmare. No wonder he hates her.“Yeah.” He kicks at the floor. “She did.”My fingers find his, fumbling, and he guides them into the spaces between hisown. I know that’s enough questions, for now, so I let the silence lingerbetween us until he decides to break it.“It seems to me,” he says, “that the factionless are better friends thanenemies.”“Maybe. But what would the cost of that friendship be?” I say.He shakes his head. “I don’t know. But we may not have any other option.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00049.jpg]ONE OF THE factionless started a fire so we could heat up our food. Those whowant to eat sit in a circle around the large metal bowl that contains the fire,first heating the cans, then passing out spoons and forks, then passing cansaround so everyone can have a bite of everything. I try not to think about howmany diseases could spread this way as I dip my spoon into a can of soup.Edward drops to the ground next to me and takes the can of soup from my hands.“So you were all Abnegation, huh?” He shovels several noodles and a piece ofcarrot into his mouth, and passes the can to the woman on his left.“We were,” I say. “But obviously Tobias and I transferred, and …” Suddenly itoccurs to me that I shouldn’t tell anyone Caleb joined Erudite. “Caleb and Susanare still Abnegation.”“And he’s your brother. Caleb,” he says. “You ditched your family to becomeDauntless?”“You sound like the Candor,” I say irritably. “Mind keeping your judgments toyourself?”Therese leans over. “He was Erudite first, actually. Not Candor.”“Yeah, I know,” I say, “I—”She interrupts me. “So was I. Had to leave, though.”“What happened?”“I wasn’t smart enough.” She shrugs and takes a can of beans from Edward,plunging her spoon into it. “I didn’t get a high enough score on my initiationintelligence test. So they said, ‘Spend your entire life cleaning up theresearch labs, or leave.’ And I left.”She looks down and licks her spoon clean. I take the beans from her and passthem along to Tobias, who is staring at the fire.“Are many of you from Erudite?” I say.Therese shakes her head. “Most are from Dauntless, actually.” She jerks her headtoward Edward, who scowls. “Then Erudite, then Candor, then a handful of Amity.No one fails Abnegation initiation, though, so we have very few of those, exceptfor a bunch who survived the simulation attack and came to us for refuge.”“I guess I shouldn’t be surprised about Dauntless,” I say.“Well, yeah. You’ve got one of the worst initiations, and there’s that wholeold-age thing.”“Old-age thing?” I say. I glance at Tobias. He is listening now, and he looksalmost normal again, his eyes thoughtful and dark in the firelight.“Once the Dauntless reach a certain level of physical deterioration,” he says,“they are asked to leave. In one way or another.”“What’s the other way?” My heart pounds, like it already knows an answer I can’tface without prompting.“Let’s just say,” says Tobias, “that for some, death is preferable tofactionlessness.”“Those people are idiots,” says Edward. “I’d rather be factionless thanDauntless.”“How fortunate that you ended up where you did, then,” says Tobias coldly.“Fortunate?” Edward snorts. “Yeah. I’m so fortunate, with my one eye and all.”“I seem to recall hearing rumors that you provoked that attack,” says Tobias.“What are you talking about?” I say. “He was winning, that’s all, and Peter wasjealous, so he just …”I see the smirk on Edward’s face and stop talking. Maybe I don’t know everythingabout what happened during initiation.“There was an inciting incident,” says Edward. “In which Peter did not come outthe victor. But it certainly didn’t warrant a butter knife to the eye.”“No arguments here,” says Tobias. “If it makes you feel any better, he got shotin the arm from a foot away during the simulation attack.”And it does seem to make Edward feel better, because his smirk carves a deeperline into his face.“Who did that?” he says. “You?”Tobias shakes his head. “Tris did.”“Well done,” Edward says.I nod, but I feel a little sick to be congratulated for that.Well, not that sick. It was Peter, after all.I stare at the flames wrapping around the fragments of wood that fuel them. Theymove and shift, like my thoughts. I remember the first time I realized I hadnever seen an elderly Dauntless. And when I realized my father was too old toclimb the paths of the Pit. Now I understand more about that than I’d like to.“Do you know much about how things are right now?” Tobias asks Edward. “Did allthe Dauntless side with Erudite? Has Candor done anything?”“Dauntless is split in half,” Edward says, talking around the food in his mouth.“Half at Erudite headquarters, half at Candor headquarters. What’s left ofAbnegation is with us. Nothing much has happened yet. Except for whateverhappened to you, I guess.”Tobias nods. I feel a little relieved to know that half of the Dauntless, atleast, are not traitors.I eat spoonful after spoonful until my stomach is full. Then Tobias gets ussleeping pallets and blankets, and I find an empty corner for us to lie down in.When he bends over to untie his shoes, I see the symbol of Amity on the small ofhis back, the branches curling over his spine. When he straightens, I stepacross the blankets and put my arms around him, brushing the tattoo with myfingers.Tobias closes his eyes. I trust the dwindling fire to disguise us as I run myhand up his back, touching each tattoo without seeing it. I imagine Erudite’sstaring eye, Candor’s unbalanced scales, Abnegation’s clasped hands, and theDauntless flames. With my other hand I find the patch of fire tattooed over hisrib cage. I feel his heavy breaths against my cheek.“I wish we were alone,” he says.“I almost always wish that,” I say. I drift off to sleep, carried by the sound of distant conversations. These daysit’s easier for me to fall asleep when there is noise around me. I can focus onthe sound instead of whatever thoughts would crawl into my head in silence.Noise and activity are the refuges of the bereaved and the guilty.I wake when the fire is just a glow, and only a few of the factionless are stillup. It takes me a few seconds to figure out why I woke up: I heard Evelyn’s andTobias’s voices, a few feet away from me. I stay still and hope they don’tdiscover that I’m awake.“You’ll have to tell me what’s going on here if you expect me to considerhelping you,” he says. “Though I’m still not sure why you need me at all.”I see Evelyn’s shadow on the wall, flickering with the fire. She is lean andstrong, just like Tobias. Her fingers twist into her hair as she speaks.“What would you like to know, exactly?”“Tell me about the chart. And the map.”“Your friend was correct in thinking that the map and the chart listed all ofour safe houses,” she says. “He was wrong about the population counts … sort of.The numbers don’t document all the factionless—only certain ones. And I’ll betyou can guess which ones those are.”“I’m not in the mood for guessing.”She sighs. “The Divergent. We’re documenting the Divergent.”“How do you know who they are?”“Before the simulation attack, part of the Abnegation aid effort involvedtesting the factionless for a certain genetic anomaly,” she says. “Sometimesthat testing involved re-administering the aptitude test. Sometimes it was morecomplicated than that. But they explained to us that they suspected we mighthave the highest Divergent population of any group in the city.”“I don’t understand. Why—”“Why would the factionless have a high Divergent population?” It sounds likeshe’s smirking. “Obviously those who can’t confine themselves to a particularway of thinking would be most likely to leave a faction or fail its initiation,right?”“That’s not what I was going to ask,” he says. “I want to know why you care howmany Divergent there are.”“The Erudite are looking for manpower. They found it temporarily in Dauntless.Now they’ll be looking for more, and we’re the obvious place, unless they figureout that we’ve got more Divergent than any other group. Just in case they don’t,I want to know how many people we’ve got who are resistant to simulations.”“Fair enough,” he says, “but why were the Abnegation so concerned with findingthe Divergent? It wasn’t to help Jeanine, was it?”“Of course not,” she says. “But I’m afraid I don’t know. The Abnegation werereluctant to provide information that only serves to relieve curiosity. Theytold us as much as they believed we should know.”“Strange,” he mumbles.“Perhaps you should ask your father about it,” she says. “He was the one whotold me about you.”“About me,” says Tobias. “What about me?”“That he suspected you were Divergent,” she says. “He was always watching you.Noting your behavior. He was very attentive to you. That’s why … that’s why Ithought you would be safe with him. Safer with him than with me.”Tobias says nothing.“I see now that I must have been wrong.”He still says nothing.“I wish—” she starts.“Don’t you dare try to apologize.” His voice shakes. “This is not something youcan bandage with a word or two and some hugging, or something.”“Okay,” she says. “Okay. I won’t.”“For what purpose are the factionless uniting?” he says. “What do you intend todo?”“We want to usurp Erudite,” she says. “Once we get rid of them, there’s not muchstopping us from controlling the government ourselves.”“That’s what you expect me to help you with. Overthrowing one corrupt governmentand instating some kind of factionless tyranny.” He snorts. “Not a chance.”“We don’t want to be tyrants,” she says. “We want to establish a new society.One without factions.”My mouth goes dry. No factions? A world in which no one knows who they are orwhere they fit? I can’t even fathom it. I imagine only chaos and isolation.Tobias lets out a laugh. “Right. So how are you going to usurp Erudite?”“Sometimes drastic change requires drastic measures.” Evelyn’s shadow lifts ashoulder. “I imagine it will involve a high level of destruction.”I shiver at the word “destruction.” Somewhere in the darker parts of me, I cravedestruction, as long as it is Erudite being destroyed. But the word carries newmeaning for me, now that I have seen what it can look like: gray-clothed bodiesslung across curbs and over sidewalks, Abnegation leaders shot on their frontlawns, next to their mailboxes. I press my face into the pallet I’m sleeping on,so hard it hurts my forehead, just to force the memory out, out, out.“As for why we need you,” Evelyn says. “In order to do this, we will needDauntless’s help. They have the weapons and the combat experience. You couldbridge the gap between us and them.”“Do you think I’m important to the Dauntless? Because I’m not. I’m just someonewho isn’t afraid of much.”“What I am suggesting,” she says, “is that you become important.” She stands,her shadow stretching from ceiling to floor. “I am sure you can find a way, ifyou want to. Think about it.”She pulls back her curly hair and ties it in a knot. “The door is always open.”A few minutes later he lies next to me again. I don’t want to admit that I waseavesdropping, but I want to tell him I don’t trust Evelyn, or the factionless,or anyone who speaks so casually about demolishing an entire faction.Before I can muster the courage to speak, his breaths become even, and he fallsasleep."},{"pageContent":"[images/00050.jpg]I RUN MY hand over the back of my neck to lift the hair that sticks there. Myentire body aches, especially my legs, which burn with lactic acid even when Iam not moving. And I don’t smell very good. I need to shower.I wander down the hall and into the bathroom. I am not the only person withbathing in mind—a group of women stand at the sinks, half of them naked, theother half completely unfazed by it. I find a free sink in the corner and stickmy head under the faucet, letting cold water spill over my ears.“Hello,” Susan says. I turn my head to the side. Water courses down my cheek andinto my nose. She is carrying two towels: one white, one gray, both frayed atthe edges.“Hi,” I say.“I have an idea,” she says. She turns her back to me and holds up a towel,blocking my view of the rest of the bathroom. I sigh with relief. Privacy. Or asmuch of it as possible.I strip quickly and grab the bar of soap next to the sink.“How are you?” she says.“I’m fine.” I know she’s only asking because faction rules dictate that shedoes. I wish she would just speak to me freely. “How are you, Susan?”“Better. Therese told me there is a large group of Abnegation refugees in one ofthe factionless safe houses,” says Susan as I lather soap into my hair.“Oh?” I say. I shove my head under the faucet again, this time massaging myscalp with my left hand to get the soap out. “Are you going to go?”“Yes,” says Susan. “Unless you need my help.”“Thanks for the offer, but I think your faction needs you more,” I say, turningoff the faucet. I wish I didn’t have to get dressed. It’s too hot for denimpants. But I grab the other towel from the floor and dry myself in a hurry.I put on the red shirt I was wearing before. I don’t want to put on somethingthat dirty again, but I have no other choice.“I suspect some of the factionless women have spare clothes,” says Susan.“You’re probably right. Okay, your turn.”I stand with the towel as Susan washes up. My arms start to ache after a while,but she ignored the pain for me, so I’ll do the same for her. Water splashes onmy ankles when she washes her hair.“This is a situation I never thought we would be in together,” I say after awhile. “Bathing from the sink of an abandoned building, on the run from theErudite.”“I thought we would live near each other,” says Susan. “Go to social eventstogether. Have our kids walk to the bus stop together.”I bite my lip at that. It is my fault, of course, that that was never apossibility, because I chose another faction.“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to bring it up,” she says. “I just regret that Ididn’t pay more attention. If I had, maybe I would have known what you weregoing through. I acted selfishly.”I laugh a little. “Susan, there’s nothing wrong with the way you acted.”“I’m done,” she says. “Can you hand me that towel?”I close my eyes and turn so she can grab the towel from my hands. When Theresewalks into the bathroom, smoothing her hair into a braid, Susan asks her forspare clothes.By the time we leave the bathroom, I wear jeans and a black shirt that is soloose up top that it slips off my shoulders, and Susan wears baggy jeans and awhite Candor shirt with a collar. She buttons it up to her throat. TheAbnegation are modest to the point of discomfort.When I enter the large room again, some of the factionless are walking out withbuckets of paint and paintbrushes. I watch them until the door closes behindthem.“They’re going to write a message to the other safe houses,” says Evelyn frombehind me. “On one of the billboards. Codes formed out of personalinformation—so-and-so’s favorite color, someone else’s childhood pet.”I am not sure why she would choose to tell me something about the factionlesscodes until I turn around. I see a familiar look in her eyes—it is the same asthe one Jeanine wore when she told Tobias she had developed a serum that couldcontrol him: pride.“Clever,” I say. “Your idea?”“It was, actually.” She shrugs, but I am not fooled. She is anything butnonchalant. “I was Erudite before I was Abnegation.”“Oh,” I say. “Guess you couldn’t keep up with a life of academia, then?”She doesn’t take the bait. “Something like that, yes.” She pauses. “I imagineyour father left for the same reason.”I almost turn away to end the conversation, but her words create a kind ofpressure inside my mind, like she is squeezing my brain between her hands. Istare.“You didn’t know?” She frowns. “I’m sorry; I forgot that faction members rarelydiscuss their old factions.”“What?” I say, my voice cracking.“Your father was born in Erudite,” she says. “His parents were friends withJeanine Matthews’s parents, before they died. Your father and Jeanine used toplay together as children. I used to watch them pass books back and forth atschool.”I imagine my father, a grown man, sitting next to Jeanine, a grown woman, at alunch table in my old cafeteria, a book between them. The idea is so ridiculousto me that I half snort, half laugh. It can’t be true.Except.Except: He never talked about his family or his childhood.Except: He did not have the quiet demeanor of someone who grew up in Abnegation.Except: His hatred of Erudite was so vehement it must have been personal.“I’m sorry, Beatrice,” Evelyn says. “I didn’t mean to reopen closing wounds.”I frown. “Yes, you did.”“What do you mean—”“Listen carefully,” I say, lowering my voice. I check over her shoulder forTobias, to make sure he isn’t listening in. All I see is Caleb and Susan on theground in the corner, passing a jar of peanut butter back and forth. No Tobias.“I’m not stupid,” I say. “I can see that you’re trying to use him. And I’ll tellhim so, if he hasn’t figured it out already.”“My dear girl,” she says. “I am his family. I am permanent. You are onlytemporary.”“Yeah,” I say. “His mom abandoned him, and his dad beat him up. How could hisloyalty not be with his blood, with a family like that?”I walk away, my hands shaking, and sit down next to Caleb on the floor. Susan isnow across the room, helping one of the factionless clean up. He passes me thejar of peanut butter. I remember the rows of peanut plants in the Amitygreenhouses. They grow peanuts because they are high in protein and fat, whichis important for the factionless in particular. I scoop some of the peanutbutter out with my fingers and eat it.Should I tell him what Evelyn just told me? I don’t want to make him think thathe has Erudite in his blood. I don’t want to give him any reason to return tothem.I decide to keep it to myself for now.“I wanted to talk to you about something,” says Caleb.I nod, still working the peanut butter off the roof of my mouth.“Susan wants to go see the Abnegation,” he says. “And so do I. I also want tomake sure she’s all right. But I don’t want to leave you.”“It’s okay,” I say.“Why don’t you come with us?” he asks. “Abnegation would welcome you back; I’msure of it.”So am I—the Abnegation don’t hold grudges. But I am teetering on the edge ofgrief’s mouth, and if I returned to my parents’ old faction, it would swallowme.I shake my head. “I have to go to Candor headquarters and find out what’s goingon,” I say. “I’m going crazy, not knowing.” I force a smile. “But you should go.Susan needs you. She seems better, but she still needs you.”“Okay.” Caleb nods. “Well, I’ll try to join you soon. Be careful, though.”“Aren’t I always?”“No, I think the word for how you usually are is ‘reckless.’”Caleb squeezes my good shoulder lightly. I eat another fingertip’s worth ofpeanut butter.Tobias emerges from the men’s bathroom a few minutes later, his red Amity shirtreplaced by a black T-shirt, and his short hair glistening with water. Our eyesmeet across the room, and I know it’s time to leave. Candor headquarters is large enough to contain an entire world. Or so it seemsto me.It is a wide cement building that overlooks what was once the river. The signsays MERC IS MART—it used to read “Merchandise Mart,” but most people refer toit as the Merciless Mart, because the Candor are merciless, but honest. Theyseem to have embraced the nickname.I don’t know what to expect, because I have never been inside. Tobias and Ipause outside the doors and look at each other.“Here we go,” he says.I can’t see anything beyond my reflection in the glass doors. I look tired anddirty. For the first time, it occurs to me that we don’t have to do anything. Wecould hole up with the factionless and let the rest of them sort through thismess. We could be nobodies, safe, together.He still hasn’t told me about the conversation he had with his mother lastnight, and I don’t think he’s going to. He seemed so determined to get to Candorheadquarters that I wonder if he’s planning something without me.I don’t know why I walk through the doors. Maybe I decide that we’ve come thisfar, we might as well see what’s going on. But I suspect it’s more that I knowwhat’s true and what’s not. I am Divergent, so I am not nobody, there’s no suchthing as “safe,” and I have other things on my mind than playing house withTobias. And so, apparently, does he.The lobby is large and well-lit, with black marble floors that stretch back toan elevator bank. A ring of white marble tiles in the center of the room formthe symbol of Candor: a set of unbalanced scales, meant to symbolize theweighing of truth against lies. The room is crawling with armed Dauntless.A Dauntless soldier with an arm in a sling approaches us, gun held ready, barrelfixed on Tobias.“Identify yourselves,” she says. She is young, but not young enough to knowTobias.The others gather behind her. Some of them eye us with suspicion, the rest withcuriosity, but far stranger than both is the light I see in some of their eyes.Recognition. They might know Tobias, but how could they possibly recognize me?“Four,” he says. He nods toward me. “And this is Tris. Both Dauntless.”The Dauntless soldier’s eyes widen, but she does not lower her gun.“Some help here?” she asks. Some of the Dauntless step forward, but they do itcautiously, like we’re dangerous.“Is there a problem?” Tobias says.“Are you armed?”“Of course I’m armed. I’m Dauntless, aren’t I?”“Stand with your hands behind your head.” She says it wildly, like she expectsus to refuse. I glance at Tobias. Why is everyone acting like we’re about toattack them?“We walked through the front door,” I say slowly. “You think we would have donethat if we were here to hurt you?”Tobias doesn’t look back at me. He just touches his fingertips to the back ofhis head. After a moment, I do the same. Dauntless soldiers crowd around us. Oneof them pats down Tobias’s legs while the other takes the gun tucked under hiswaistband. Another one, a round-faced boy with pink cheeks, looks at meapologetically.“I have a knife in my back pocket.” I say. “Put your hands on me, and I willmake you regret it.”He mumbles some kind of apology. His fingers pinch the knife handle, careful notto touch me.“What’s going on?” asks Tobias.The first soldier exchanges looks with some of the others.“I’m sorry,” she says. “But we were instructed to arrest you upon your arrival.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00051.jpg]THEY SURROUND US, but don’t handcuff us, and walk us to the elevator bank. Nomatter how many times I ask why we are under arrest, no one says anything oreven looks in my direction. Eventually I give up and stay silent, like Tobias.We go to the third level, where they take us to a small room with a white marblefloor instead of a black one. There’s no furniture except for a bench along theback wall. Every faction is supposed to have holding rooms for those who maketrouble, but I’ve never been in one before.The door closes behind us, and locks, and we’re alone again.Tobias sits down on the bench, his brow furrowed. I pace back and forth in frontof him. If he had any idea why we were in here, he would tell me, so I don’task. I walk five steps forward and five steps back, five steps forward and fivesteps back, at the same rhythm, hoping it will help me figure something out.If Erudite didn’t take over Candor—and Edward told us they didn’t—why would theCandor arrest us? What could we have done to them?If Erudite didn’t take over, the only real crime left is siding with them. Did Ido anything that could have been interpreted as siding with Erudite? My teethdig into my lower lip so hard I wince. Yes, I did. I shot Will. I shot a numberof other Dauntless. They were under the simulation, but maybe Candor doesn’tknow that or doesn’t think it’s a good enough reason.“Can you please calm down?” Tobias says. “You’re making me nervous.”“This is me calming down.”He leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, and stares between hissneakers. “The wound in your lip begs to differ.”I sit next to him and hug my knees to my chest with one arm, my right armhanging at my side. For a long time, he says nothing, and my arm wraps tighterand tighter around my legs. I feel like, the smaller I become, the safer I am.“Sometimes,” he says, “I worry that you don’t trust me.”“I trust you,” I say. “Of course I trust you. Why would you think otherwise?”“Just seems like there’s something you’re not telling me. I told you things ….”He shakes his head. “I would never have told anyone else. Something’s been goingon with you, though, and you haven’t told me yet.”“There’s been a lot going on. You know that,” I say. “And anyway, what aboutyou? I could say the same thing to you.”He touches my cheek, his fingers pushing into my hair. Ignoring my question justlike I ignored his.“If it’s just about your parents,” he says softly, “tell me and I’ll believeyou.”His eyes should be wild with apprehension, given where we are, but they arestill and dark. They transport me to familiar places. Safe places, whereconfessing that I shot one of my best friends would be easy, where I would notbe afraid of the way that Tobias will look at me when he finds out what I did.I cover his hand with mine. “That’s all it is,” I say weakly.“Okay,” he says. He touches his mouth to mine. Guilt clutches at my stomach.The door opens. A few people file in—two Candor with guns; a dark-skinned, olderCandor man; a Dauntless woman I don’t recognize. And then: Jack Kang,representative of Candor.By most faction standards, he is a young leader—only thirty-nine years old. Butby Dauntless standards, that’s nothing. Eric became a Dauntless leader atseventeen. But that’s probably one of the reasons the other factions don’t takeour opinions or decisions seriously.Jack is handsome, too, with short black hair and warm, slanted eyes, likeTori’s, and high cheekbones. Despite his good looks, he isn’t known for beingcharming, probably because he’s Candor, and they see charm as deceptive. I dotrust him to tell us what’s going on without wasting time on pleasantries. Thatis something.“They told me you seemed confused about why you were arrested,” he says. Hisvoice is deep, but strangely flat, like it could not create an echo even at thebottom of an empty cavern. “To me that means either you’re falsely accused orgood at pretending. The only—”“What are we accused of?” I interrupt him.“He is accused of crimes against humanity. You are accused of being hisaccomplice.”“Crimes against humanity?” Tobias finally sounds angry. He gives Jack adisgusted look. “What?”“We saw video footage of the attack. You were running the attack simulation,”says Jack.“How could you have seen footage? We took the data,” says Tobias.“You took one copy of the data. All the footage of the Dauntless compoundrecorded during the attack was also sent to other computers throughout thecity,” says Jack. “All we saw was you running the simulation and her nearlygetting punched to death before she gave up. Then you stopped, had a ratherabrupt lovers’ reconciliation, and stole the hard drive together. One possiblereason is because the simulation was over and you didn’t want us to get ourhands on it.”I almost laugh. My great act of heroism, the only important thing I have everdone, and they think I was working for the Erudite when I did it.“The simulation didn’t end,” I say. “We stopped it, you—”Jack holds up his hand. “I am not interested in what you have to say right now.The truth will come out when you are both interrogated under the influence oftruth serum.”Christina told me about truth serum once. She said the most difficult part ofCandor initiation was being given truth serum and answering personal questionsin front of everyone in the faction. I don’t need to search myself for mydeepest, darkest secrets to know that truth serum is the last thing I want in mybody.“Truth serum?” I shake my head. “No. No way.”“There’s something you have to hide?” Jack says, lifting both eyebrows.I want to tell him that anyone with an ounce of dignity wants to keep somethings to herself, but I don’t want to arouse his suspicions. So I shake myhead.“All right, then.” He checks his watch. “It is now noon. The interrogation willbe at seven. Don’t bother preparing for it. You can’t withhold information whileunder the influence of truth serum.”He turns on his heel and walks out of the room.“What a pleasant man,” says Tobias. A group of armed Dauntless escort me to the bathroom in the early afternoon. Itake my time, letting my hands turn red in the hot-faucet water and staring atmy reflection. When I was in Abnegation and wasn’t allowed to look into mirrors,I used to think that a lot could change in a person’s appearance in threemonths. But it only took a few days to change me this time.I look older. Maybe it’s the short hair or maybe it’s just that I wear all thathas happened like a mask. Either way, I always thought I would be happy when Istopped looking like a child. But all I feel is a lump in my throat. I am nolonger the daughter my parents knew. They will never know me as I am now.I turn away from the mirror and shove the door to the hallway open with theheels of my hands.When the Dauntless drop me off at the holding room, I linger by the door. Tobiaslooks like he did when I first met him—black T-shirt, short hair, sternexpression. The sight of him used to fill me with nervous excitement. I rememberwhen I grabbed his hand outside the training room, just for a few seconds, andwhen we sat together on the rocks next to the chasm, and I feel a pang oflonging for how things used to be.“Hungry?” he says. He offers me a sandwich from the plate next to him.I take it and sit down, leaning my head on his shoulder. All that’s left for usto do is wait, so that’s what we do. We eat until the food is gone. We sit untilwe get uncomfortable. Then we lie down next to each other on the floor,shoulders touching, staring at the same patch of white ceiling.“What are you afraid of saying?” he says.“Any of it. All of it. I don’t want to relive anything.”He nods. I close my eyes and pretend to sleep. There’s no clock in the room, soI can’t count down the minutes until the interrogation. Time might as well notexist in this place, except I feel it pressing against me as seven o’clockinevitably draws closer, pushing me into the floor tiles.Maybe time would not feel as heavy if I didn’t have this guilt—the guilt ofknowing the truth and stuffing it down where no one can see it, not even Tobias.Maybe I should not be so afraid of saying anything, because honesty will make mefeel lighter.I must fall asleep eventually, because I jerk awake at the sound of the dooropening. A few Dauntless walk in as we get to our feet, and one of them says myname. Christina shoves her way past the others and throws her arms around me.Her fingers dig into the wound in my shoulder, and I cry out.“Got shot,” I say. “Shoulder. Ow.”“Oh God!” She releases me. “Sorry, Tris.”She doesn’t look like the Christina I remember. Her hair is shorter, like aboy’s, and her skin is grayish instead of a warm brown. She smiles at me, butthe smile doesn’t travel to her eyes, which still look tired. I try to smileback, but I’m too nervous. Christina will be there at my interrogation. She willhear what I did to Will. She will never forgive me.Unless I fight the serum, swallow the truth—if I can.But is that really what I want? To let it fester inside me forever?“You okay? I heard you were here so I asked to escort you,” she says as we leavethe holding room. “I know you didn’t do it. You’re not a traitor.”“I’m fine,” I say. “And thank you. How are you?”“Oh, I’m …” Her voice trails off, and she bites her lip. “Did anyone tell you …I mean, maybe now isn’t the time, but …”“What? What is it?”“Um … Will died in the attack,” she says.She gives me a worried look, and an expectant one. Expecting what?Oh. I am not supposed to know that Will is dead. I could pretend to beemotional, but I probably wouldn’t do it convincingly. It’s best to admit that Ialready knew. But I don’t know how to explain that without telling hereverything.I feel suddenly sick. Am I really evaluating how best to deceive my friend?“I know,” I say. “I saw him on the monitors when I was in the control room. I’msorry, Christina.”“Oh.” She nods. “Well, I’m … glad you already knew. I really didn’t want tobreak the news to you in a hallway.”A short laugh. A flash of a smile. Neither of them like they used to be.We file into an elevator. I can feel Tobias staring at me—he knows I didn’t seeWill in the monitors, and he didn’t know that Will was dead. I stare straightahead and pretend his eyes aren’t setting me on fire.“Don’t worry about the truth serum,” she says. “It’s easy. You barely knowwhat’s happening when you’re under. It’s only when you resurface that you evenknow what you said. I went under when I was a kid. It’s pretty commonplace inCandor.”The other Dauntless in the elevator give each other looks. In normalcircumstances, someone would probably reprimand her for discussing her oldfaction, but these are not normal circumstances. At no other time in Christina’slife will she escort her best friend, now a suspected traitor, to a publicinterrogation.“Is everyone else all right?” I say. “Uriah, Lynn, Marlene?”“All here,” she says. “Except Uriah’s brother, Zeke, who is with the otherDauntless.”“What?” Zeke, who secured my straps on the zip line, a traitor?The elevator stops on the top floor, and the others file out.“I know,” she says. “No one saw it coming.”She takes my arm and tugs me toward the doors. We walk down a black-marblehallway—it must be easy to get lost in Candor headquarters, since everythinglooks the same. We walk down another hallway and through a set of double doors.From the outside, the Merciless Mart is a squat block with a narrow raisedportion in its center. From the inside, that raised portion is a hollowthree-story room with empty spaces in the walls instead of windows. I see thedarkening sky above me, starless.Here the marble floors are white, with a black Candor symbol in the center ofthe room, and the walls are lit with rows of dim yellow lights, so the wholeroom glows. Every voice echoes.Most of Candor and the remnants of Dauntless are already gathered. Some of themsit on the tiered benches that wrap around the edge of the room, but there isn’tenough space for everyone, so the rest are crowded around the Candor symbol. Inthe center of the symbol, between the unbalanced scales, are two empty chairs.Tobias reaches for my hand. I lace my fingers in his.Our Dauntless guards lead us to the center of the room, where we are greetedwith, at best, murmurs, and at worst, jeers. I spot Jack Kang in the front rowof the tiered benches.An old, dark-skinned man steps forward, a black box in his hands.“My name is Niles,” he says. “I will be your questioner. You—” He points atTobias. “You will be going first. So if you will please step forward …”Tobias squeezes my hand, and then releases it, and I stand with Christina at theedge of the Candor symbol. The air in the room is warm—moist, summer air, sunsetair—but I feel cold.Niles opens the black box. It contains two needles, one for Tobias and one forme. He also takes an antiseptic wipe from his pocket and offers it to Tobias. Wedidn’t bother with that kind of thing in Dauntless.“The injection site is in your neck,” Niles says.All I hear, as Tobias applies antiseptic to his skin, is the wind. Niles stepsforward and plunges the needle into Tobias’s neck, squeezing the cloudy, bluishliquid into his veins. The last time I saw someone inject Tobias with something,it was Jeanine, putting him under a new simulation, one that was effective evenon the Divergent—or so she believed. I thought, then, that he was lost to meforever.I shudder."},{"pageContent":"[images/00052.jpg]“I WILL ASK you a series of simple questions so that you can grow accustomed tothe serum as it takes full effect,” says Niles. “Now. What is your name?”Tobias sits with slouched shoulders and a lowered head, like his body is tooheavy for him. He scowls and squirms in the chair, and through gritted teethsays, “Four.”Maybe it isn’t possible to lie under the truth serum, but to select whichversion of the truth to tell: Four is his name, but it is not his name.“That is a nickname,” Niles says. “What is your real name?”“Tobias,” he says.Christina elbows me. “Did you know that?”I nod.“What are the names of your parents, Tobias?”Tobias opens his mouth to answer, and then clenches his jaw as if to stop thewords from spilling out.“Why is this relevant?” Tobias asks.The Candor around me mutter to each other, some of them scowling. I raise myeyebrow at Christina.“It’s extremely difficult not to immediately answer questions while under thetruth serum,” she says. “It means he has a seriously strong will. And somethingto hide.”“Maybe it wasn’t relevant before, Tobias,” Niles says, “but it is now thatyou’ve resisted answering the question. The names of your parents, please.”Tobias closes his eyes. “Evelyn and Marcus Eaton.”Surnames are just an additional means of identification, useful only to preventconfusion in official records. When we marry, one spouse has to take the other’ssurname, or both have to take a new one. Still, while we may carry our namesfrom family to faction, we rarely mention them.But everyone recognizes Marcus’s surname. I can tell by the clamor that rises inthe room after Tobias speaks. The Candor all know Marcus is the most influentialgovernment official, and some of them must have read the article Jeaninereleased about his cruelty toward his son. It was one of the only things shesaid that was true. And now everyone knows that Tobias is that son.Tobias Eaton is a powerful name.Niles waits for silence, then continues. “So you are a faction transfer, are younot?”“Yes.”“You transferred from Abnegation to Dauntless?”“Yes,” snaps Tobias. “Isn’t that obvious?”I bite my lip. He should calm down; he is giving away too much. The morereluctant he is to answer a question, the more determined Niles will be to hearthe answer.“One of the purposes of this interrogation is to determine your loyalties,” saysNiles, “so I must ask: Why did you transfer?”Tobias glares at Niles, and keeps his mouth shut. Seconds pass in completesilence. The longer he tries to resist the serum, the harder it seems to be forhim: color fills his cheeks, and he breathes faster, heavier. My chest aches forhim. The details of his childhood should stay inside him, if that’s where hewants them to be. Candor is cruel for forcing them from him, for taking away hisfreedom.“This is horrible,” I say hotly to Christina. “Wrong.”“What?” she says. “It’s a simple question.”I shake my head. “You don’t understand.”Christina smiles a little at me. “You really care about him.”I am too busy watching Tobias to respond.Niles says, “I’ll ask again. It is important that we understand the extent ofyour loyalty to your chosen faction. So why did you transfer to Dauntless,Tobias?”“To protect myself,” says Tobias. “I transferred to protect myself.”“Protect yourself from what?”“From my father.”All the conversations in the room stop, and the silence they leave in their wakeis worse than the muttering was. I expect Niles to keep probing, but he doesn’t.“Thank you for your honesty,” Niles says. The Candor repeat the phrase undertheir breath. All around me are the words “Thank you for your honesty” atdifferent volumes and pitches, and my anger begins to dissolve. The whisperedwords seem to welcome Tobias, to embrace and then discard his darkest secret.It’s not cruelty, maybe, but a desire to understand, that motivates them. Thatdoesn’t make me any less afraid of going under truth serum.“Is your allegiance with your current faction, Tobias?” Niles says.“My allegiance lies with anyone who does not support the attack on Abnegation,”he says.“Speaking of which,” Niles says, “I think we should focus on what happened thatday. What do you remember about being under the simulation?”“I was not under the simulation, at first,” says Tobias. “It didn’t work.”Niles laughs a little. “What do you mean, it didn’t work?”“One of the defining characteristics of the Divergent is that their minds areresistant to simulations,” says Tobias. “And I am Divergent. So no, it didn’twork.”More mutters. Christina nudges me with her elbow.“Are you too?” she says, close to my ear so she can stay quiet. “Is that why youwere awake?”I look at her. I have spent the past few months afraid of the word “Divergent,”terrified that anyone would discover what I am. But I won’t be able to hide itanymore. I nod.It’s like her eyes swell to fill their sockets; that’s how big they get. I havetrouble identifying her expression. Is it shock? Fear?Awe?“Do you know what it means?” I say.“I heard about it when I was young,” she says in a reverent whisper.Definitely awe.“Like it was a fantasy story,” she says. “‘There are people with special powersamong us!’ Like that.”“Well, it’s not a fantasy, and it’s not that big a deal,” I say. “It’s like thefear landscape simulation—you were aware while you were in it, and you couldmanipulate it. Except for me, it’s like that in every simulation.”“But Tris,” she says, setting her hand on my elbow. “That’s impossible.”In the center of the room, Niles has his hands up and is trying to silence thecrowd, but there are too many whispers—some hostile, some terrified, and someawed, like Christina’s. Finally Niles stands and yells, “If you don’t quietdown, you will be asked to leave!”At last everyone quiets down. Niles sits.“Now,” he says. “When you say ‘resistant to simulations,’ what do you mean?”“Usually, it means we’re aware during simulations,” says Tobias. He seems tohave an easier time with the truth serum when he answers factual questionsinstead of emotional ones. He doesn’t sound like he’s under the truth serum atall now, though his slumped posture and wandering eyes indicate otherwise. “Butthe attack simulation was different, using a different kind of simulation serum,one with long-range transmitters. Evidently the long-range transmitters didn’twork on the Divergent at all, because I awoke in my own mind that morning.”“You say you weren’t under the simulation at first. Can you explain what youmean by that?”“I mean that I was discovered and brought to Jeanine, and she injected a versionof the simulation serum that specifically targeted the Divergent. I was awareduring that simulation, but it didn’t do much good.”“The video footage from the Dauntless headquarters shows you running thesimulation,” Niles says darkly. “How, exactly, do you explain that?”“When a simulation is running, your eyes still see and process the actual world,but your brain no longer comprehends them. On some level, though, your brainstill knows what you’re seeing and where you are. The nature of this newsimulation was that it recorded my emotional responses to outside stimuli,”Tobias says, closing his eyes for a few seconds, “and responded by altering theappearance of that stimuli. The simulation made my enemies into friends, myfriends into enemies. I thought I was shutting the simulation down. Really I wasreceiving instructions about how to keep it running.”Christina nods along to his words. I feel calmer when I see that most of thecrowd is doing the same thing. This is the benefit of the truth serum, Irealize. Tobias’s testimony is irrefutable this way.“We have seen footage of what ultimately happened to you in the control room,”says Niles, “but it is confusing. Please describe it to us.”“Someone entered the room, and I thought it was a Dauntless soldier, trying tostop me from destroying the simulation. I was fighting her, and …” Tobiasscowls, struggling. “… and then she stopped, and I got confused. Even if I hadbeen awake, I would have been confused. Why would she surrender? Why didn’t shejust kill me?”His eyes search the crowd until they find my face. My heartbeat lives in mythroat; lives in my cheeks.“I still don’t understand,” he says softly, “how she knew that it would work.”Lives in my fingertips.“I think my conflicted emotions confused the simulation,” he says. “And then Iheard her voice. Somehow, that enabled me to fight the simulation.”My eyes burn. I have tried not to think of that moment, when I thought he waslost to me and that I would soon be dead, when all I wanted was to feel hisheartbeat. I try not to think of it now; I blink the tears from my eyes.“I recognized her, finally,” he says. “We went back into the control room andstopped the simulation.”“What is the name of this person?”“Tris,” he says. “Beatrice Prior, I mean.”“Did you know her before this happened?”“Yes.”“How did you know her?”“I was her instructor,” he says. “Now we’re together.”“I have a final question,” Niles says. “Among the Candor, before a person isaccepted into our community, they have to completely expose themselves. Giventhe dire circumstances we are in, we require the same of you. So, Tobias Eaton:what are your deepest regrets?”I look him over, from his beat-up sneakers to his long fingers to his straighteyebrows.“I regret …” Tobias tilts his head, and sighs. “I regret my choice.”“What choice?”“Dauntless,” he says. “I was born for Abnegation. I was planning on leavingDauntless, and becoming factionless. But then I met her, and … I felt like maybeI could make something more of my decision.”Her.For a moment, it’s like I’m looking at a different person, sitting in Tobias’sskin, one whose life is not as simple as I thought. He wanted to leaveDauntless, but he stayed because of me. He never told me that.“Choosing Dauntless in order to escape my father was an act of cowardice,” hesays. “I regret that cowardice. It means I am not worthy of my faction. I willalways regret it.”I expect the Dauntless to let out indignant shouts, maybe to charge the chairand beat him to a pulp. They are capable of far more erratic things than that.But they don’t. They stand in stony silence, with stony faces, staring at theyoung man who did not betray them, but never truly felt that he belonged tothem.For a moment we are all silent. I don’t know who starts the whisper; it seems tooriginate from nothing, to come from no one. But someone whispers, “Thank youfor your honesty,” and the rest of the room repeats it.“Thank you for your honesty,” they whisper.I don’t join in.I am the only thing that kept him in the faction he wanted to leave. I am notworth that.Maybe he deserves to know. Niles stands in the center of the room with a needle in hand. The lights abovehim make it shine. All around me, the Dauntless and the Candor wait for me tostep forward and spill my entire life before them.The thought occurs to me again: Maybe I can fight the serum. But I don’t know ifI should try. It might be better for the people I love if I come clean.I walk stiffly to the center of the room as Tobias leaves it. As we pass eachother, he takes my hand and squeezes my fingers. Then he’s gone, and it’s justme and Niles and the needle. I wipe the side of my neck with the antiseptic, butwhen he reaches out with the needle, I pull back.“I would rather do it myself,” I say, holding out my hand. I will never letsomeone else inject me again, not after letting Eric inject me with attacksimulation serum after my final test. I can’t change the contents of the syringejust by doing it myself, but at least this way, I am the instrument of my owndestruction.“Do you know how?” he says, raising a bushy eyebrow.“Yes.”Niles offers me the syringe. I position it over the vein in my neck, insert theneedle, and press the plunger. I barely feel the pinch. I am too charged withadrenaline.Someone comes forward with a trash can, and I toss the needle in. I feel theeffects of the serum immediately afterward. It makes my blood feel like lead inmy veins. I almost collapse on my way to the chair—Niles has to grab my arm andguide me toward it.Seconds later my brain goes silent. What was I thinking about? It doesn’t seemto matter. Nothing matters except the chair beneath me and the man sittingacross from me.“What is your name?” he says.The second he asks the question, the answer pops out of my mouth. “BeatricePrior.”“But you go by Tris?”“I do.”“What are the names of your parents, Tris?”“Andrew and Natalie Prior.”“You are also a faction transfer, are you not?”“Yes,” I say, but a new thought whispers at the back of my mind. Also? Alsorefers to someone else, and in this case, someone else is Tobias. I frown as Itry to picture Tobias, but it is difficult to force the image of him into mymind. Not so difficult that I can’t do it, though. I see him, and then I see aflash of him sitting in the same chair I’m sitting in.“You came from Abnegation? And chose Dauntless?”“Yes,” I say again, but this time, the word sounds terse. I don’t know why,exactly.“Why did you transfer?”That question is more complicated, but I still know the answer. I was not goodenough for Abnegation is on the tip of my tongue, but another phrase replacesit: I wanted to be free. They are both true. I want to say them both. I squeezethe armrests as I try to remember where I am, what I’m doing. I see people allaround me, but I don’t know why they’re there.I strain, the way I used to strain when I could almost remember the answer to atest question but couldn’t call it to mind. I used to close my eyes and picturethe textbook page the answer was on. I struggle for a few seconds, but I can’tdo it; I can’t remember.“I wasn’t good enough for Abnegation,” I say, “and I wanted to be free. So Ichose Dauntless.”“Why weren’t you good enough?”“Because I was selfish,” I say.“You were selfish? You aren’t anymore?”“Of course I am. My mother said that everyone is selfish,” I say, “but I becameless selfish in Dauntless. I discovered there were people I would fight for. Diefor, even.”The answer surprises me—but why? I pinch my lips together for a moment. Becauseit’s true. If I say it here, it must be true.That thought gives me the missing link in the chain of thought I was trying tofind. I am here for a lie-detector test. Everything I say is true. I feel a beadof sweat roll down the back of my neck.Lie-detector test. Truth serum. I have to remind myself. It is too easy to getlost in honesty.“Tris, would you please tell us what happened the day of the attack?”“I woke up,” I say, “and everyone was under the simulation. So I played alonguntil I found Tobias.”“What happened after you and Tobias were separated?”“Jeanine tried to have me killed, but my mother saved me. She used to beDauntless, so she knew how to use a gun.” My body feels even heavier now, but nolonger cold. I feel something stir in my chest, something worse than sadness,worse than regret.I know what comes next. My mother died and then I killed Will; I shot him; Ikilled him.“She distracted the Dauntless soldiers so I could get away, and they killedher,” I say.Some of them ran after me, and I killed them. But there are Dauntless in thecrowd around me, Dauntless, I killed some of the Dauntless, I shouldn’t talkabout it here.“I kept running,” I say, “And …” And Will ran after me. And I killed him. No,no. I feel sweat near my hairline.“And I found my brother and father,” I say, my voice strained. “We formed a planto destroy the simulation.”The edge of the armrest digs into my palm. I withheld some of the truth. Surelythat counts as deception.I fought the serum. And in that short moment, I won.I should feel triumphant. Instead I feel the weight of what I did crush meagain.“We infiltrated the Dauntless compound, and my father and I went up to thecontrol room. He fought off Dauntless soldiers at the expense of his life,” Isay. “I made it to the control room, and Tobias was there.”“Tobias said you fought him, but then stopped. Why did you do that?”“Because I realized that one of us would have to kill the other,” I say, “and Ididn’t want to kill him.”“You gave up?”“No!” I snap. I shake my head. “No, not exactly. I remembered something I haddone in my fear landscape in Dauntless initiation … in a simulation, a womandemanded that I kill my family, and I let her shoot me instead. It worked then.I thought …” I pinch the bridge of my nose. My head is starting to ache and mycontrol is gone and my thoughts run into words. “I was so frantic, but all Icould think was that there was something to it; there was a strength in it. AndI couldn’t kill him, so I had to try.”I blink tears from my eyes.“So you were never under the simulation?”“No.” I press the heel of my hands to my eyes, pushing the tears out of them sothey don’t fall on my cheeks where everyone can see them.“No,” I say again. “No, I am Divergent.”“Just to clarify,” says Niles. “Are you telling me that you were almost murderedby the Erudite … and then fought your way into the Dauntless compound … anddestroyed the simulation?”“Yes,” I say.“I think I speak for everyone,” he says, “when I say that you have earned thetitle of Dauntless.”Shouts rise up from the left side of the room, and I see blurs of fists pressinginto the dark air. My faction, calling to me.But no, they’re wrong, I’m not brave, I’m not brave, I shot Will and I can’tadmit it, I can’t even admit it….“Beatrice Prior,” says Niles, “what are your deepest regrets?”What do I regret? I do not regret choosing Dauntless or leaving Abnegation. I donot even regret shooting the guards outside the control room, because it was soimportant that I get past them.“I regret …”My eyes leave Niles’s face and drift over the room, and land on Tobias. He isexpressionless, his mouth in a firm line, his stare blank. His hands, crossedover his chest, clasp his arms so hard his knuckles are white. Next to himstands Christina. My chest squeezes, and I can’t breathe.I have to tell them. I have to tell the truth.“Will,” I say. It sounds like a gasp, like it was pulled straight from mystomach. Now there is no turning back.“I shot Will,” I say, “while he was under the simulation. I killed him. He wasgoing to kill me, but I killed him. My friend.”Will, with the crease between his eyebrows, with green eyes like celery and theability to quote the Dauntless manifesto from memory. I feel pain in my stomachso intense that I almost groan. It hurts to remember him. It hurts every part ofme.And there is something else, something worse that I didn’t realize before. I waswilling to die rather than kill Tobias, but the thought never occurred to mewhen it came to Will. I decided to kill Will in a fraction of a second.I feel bare. I didn’t realize that I wore my secrets as armor until they weregone, and now everyone sees me as I really am.“Thank you for your honesty,” they say.But Christina and Tobias say nothing."},{"pageContent":"[images/00054.jpg]I RISE FROM the chair. I don’t feel as dizzy as I did a moment ago; the serum isalready wearing off. The crowd tilts, and I search for a door. I don’t usuallyrun away from things, but I would run from this.Everyone starts to file out of the room except for Christina. She stands where Ileft her, her hands in fists that are in the process of uncurling. Her eyes meetmine and yet they do not. Tears swim in her eyes and yet she is not crying.“Christina,” I say, but the only words I can think of—I’m sorry—sound more likean insult than an apology. Sorry is what you are when you bump someone with yourelbow, what you are when you interrupt someone. I am more than sorry.“He had a gun,” I say. “He was about to shoot me. He was under the simulation.”“You killed him,” she says. Her words sound bigger than words usually do, likethey expanded in her mouth before she spoke them. She looks at me as if shedoesn’t recognize me for a few seconds, then turns away.A younger girl with the same skin color and the same height takes herhand—Christina’s younger sister. I saw her on Visiting Day, a thousand yearsago. The truth serum makes the sight of them swim before me, or that could bethe tears gathering in my eyes.“You okay?” says Uriah, emerging from the crowd to touch my shoulder. I haven’tseen him since before the simulation attack, but I can’t find it in me to greethim.“Yeah.”“Hey.” He squeezes my shoulder. “You did what you had to do, right? To save usfrom being Erudite slaves. She’ll see that eventually. When the grief fades.”I can’t even find it in me to nod. Uriah smiles at me and walks away. SomeDauntless brush against me and they murmur words that sound like gratitude, orcompliments, or reassurance. Others give me a wide berth, look at me withnarrowed, suspicious eyes.The black-clothed bodies smear together in front of me. I am empty. Everythinghas spilled out of me.Tobias stands next to me. I brace myself for his reaction.“I got our weapons back,” he says, offering me my knife.I shove it in my back pocket without meeting his eyes.“We can talk about it tomorrow,” he says. Quietly. Quiet is dangerous, withTobias.“Okay.”He slides his arm across my shoulders. My hand finds his hip, and I pull himagainst me.I hold on tight as we walk toward the elevators together. He finds us two cots at the end of a hallway somewhere. We lie with our headsinches apart, not speaking.When I’m sure he’s asleep, I slip out from beneath the blankets and walk downthe hallway, past a dozen sleeping Dauntless. I find the door that leads to thestairs.As I climb step after step, and my muscles begin to burn, and my lungs fight forair, I feel the first moments of relief I’ve experienced in days.I may be good at running on flat ground, but walking up stairs is anothermatter. I massage a spasm from my hamstring as I march past the twelfth floor,and try to recover some of my lost air. I grin at the fierce burn in my legs, inmy chest. Using pain to relieve pain. It doesn’t make much sense.By the time I reach the eighteenth floor, my legs feel like they have turned toliquid. I shuffle toward the room where I was interrogated. It’s empty now, butthe amphitheater benches are still there, as is the chair I sat in. The moonglows behind a haze of clouds.I set my hands on the back of the chair. It’s plain: wooden, a little creaky.How strange that something so simple could have been instrumental in my decisionto ruin one of my most important relationships, and damage another.It’s bad enough that I killed Will, that I didn’t think fast enough to come upwith another solution. Now I have to live with everyone else’s judgment as wellas my own, and the fact that nothing—not even me—will ever be the same again.The Candor sing the praises of the truth, but they never tell you how much itcosts.The edge of the chair bites into my palms. I was squeezing it harder than Ithought. I stare down at it for a second and then lift it, balancing it legs-upon my good shoulder. I search the edge of the room for a ladder or a staircasethat will help me climb. All I see are the amphitheater benches, rising highabove the floor.I walk up to the highest bench, and lift the chair above my head. It just barelytouches the ledge beneath one of the window spaces. I jump, shoving the chairforward, and it slides onto the ledge. My shoulder aches—I shouldn’t really beusing my arm—but I have other things on my mind.I jump, grab the ledge, and pull myself up, my arms shaking. I swing my leg upand drag the rest of my body onto the ledge. When I’m up, I lie there for amoment, sucking in air and heaving it back out again.I stand on the ledge, under the arch of what used to be a window, and stare outat the city. The dead river curls around the building and disappears. Thebridge, its red paint peeling, stretches over the muck. Across it are buildings,most of them empty. It is hard to believe there were ever enough people in thecity to fill them.For a second, I allow myself to reenter the memory of the interrogation.Tobias’s lack of expression; his anger afterward, suppressed for the sake of mysanity. Christina’s empty look. The whispers, “Thank you for your honesty.” Easyto say that when what I did doesn’t affect them.I grab the chair and hurl it over the ledge. A faint cry escapes me. It growsinto a yell, which transforms into a scream, and then I’m standing on the ledgeof the Merciless Mart, screaming as the chair sails toward the ground, screaminguntil my throat burns. Then the chair hits the ground, shattering like a brittleskeleton. I sit down on the ledge, leaning into the side of the window frame,and close my eyes.And then I think of Al.I wonder how long Al stood at the ledge before he pitched himself over it, intothe Dauntless Pit.He must have stood there for a long time, making a list of all the terriblethings he had done—almost killing me was one of those things—and another list ofall the good, heroic, brave things he had not done, and then decided that he wastired. Tired, not just of living, but of existing. Tired of being Al.I open my eyes, and stare at the pieces of chair I can faintly see on thepavement below. For the first time I feel like I understand Al. I am tired ofbeing Tris. I have done bad things. I can’t take them back, and they are part ofwho I am. Most of the time, they seem like the only thing I am.I lean forward, into the air, holding on to the side of the window with onehand. Another few inches and my weight would pull me to the ground. I would notbe able to stop it.But I can’t do it. My parents lost their lives out of love for me. Losing minefor no good reason would be a terrible way to repay them for that sacrifice, nomatter what I’ve done.“Let the guilt teach you how to behave next time,” my father would say.“I love you. No matter what,” my mother would say.Part of me wishes I could burn them from my mind, so I would never have to mournfor them. But the rest of me is afraid of who I would be without them.My eyes blurry with tears, I lower myself back into the interrogation room. I return to my cot early that morning, and Tobias is already awake. He turns andwalks toward the elevators, and I follow him, because I know that’s what hewants. We stand in the elevator, side by side. I hear ringing in my ears.The elevator sinks to the second floor, and I start to shake. It starts with myhands, but travels to my arms and my chest, until little shudders go through myentire body and I have no way to stop them. We stand between the elevators,right above another Candor symbol, the uneven scales. The symbol that is alsodrawn on the middle of his spine.He doesn’t look at me for a long time. He stands with his arms crossed and hishead down until I can’t stand it anymore, until I feel like I might scream. Ishould say something, but I don’t know what to say. I can’t apologize, because Ionly told the truth, and I can’t change the truth into a lie. I can’t giveexcuses.“You didn’t tell me,” he says. “Why not?”“Because I didn’t …” I shake my head. “I didn’t know how to.”He scowls. “It’s pretty easy, Tris—”“Oh yeah,” I say, nodding. “It’s so easy. All I have to do is go up to you andsay, ‘By the way, I shot Will, and now guilt is ripping me to shreds, but what’sfor breakfast?’ Right? Right?” Suddenly it is too much, too much to contain.Tears fill my eyes, and I yell, “Why don’t you try killing one of your bestfriends and then dealing with the consequences?”I cover my face with my hands. I don’t want him to see me sobbing again. Hetouches my shoulder.“Tris,” he says, gently this time. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t pretend that Iunderstand. I just meant that …” He struggles for a moment. “I wish you trustedme enough to tell me things like that.”I do trust you, is what I want to say. But it isn’t true—I didn’t trust him tolove me despite the terrible things I had done. I don’t trust anyone to do that,but that isn’t his problem; it’s mine.“I mean,” he says, “I had to find out that you almost drowned in a water tankfrom Caleb. Doesn’t that seem a little strange to you?”Just when I was about to apologize.I wipe my cheeks hard with my fingertips and stare at him.“Other things seem stranger,” I say, trying to make my voice light. “Likefinding out that your boyfriend’s supposedly dead mother is still alive byseeing her in person. Or overhearing his plans to ally with the factionless, buthe never tells you about it. That seems a little strange to me.”He takes his hand from my shoulder.“Don’t pretend this is only my problem,” I say. “If I don’t trust you, you don’ttrust me either.”“I thought we would get to those things eventually,” he says. “Do I have to tellyou everything right away?”I feel so frustrated I can’t even speak for a few seconds. Heat fills my cheeks.“God, Four!” I snap. “You don’t want to have to tell me everything right away,but I have to tell you everything right away? Can’t you see how stupid that is?”“First of all, don’t use that name like a weapon against me,” he says, pointingat me. “Second, I was not making plans to ally with the factionless; I was justthinking it over. If I had made a decision, I would have said something to you.And third, it would be different if you had actually intended to tell me aboutWill at some point, but it’s obvious that you didn’t.”“I did tell you about Will!” I say. “That wasn’t truth serum; it was me. I saidit because I chose to.”“What are you talking about?”“I was aware. Under the serum. I could have lied; I could have kept it from you.But I didn’t, because I thought you deserved to know the truth.”“What a way to tell me!” he says, scowling. “In front of over a hundred people!How intimate!”“Oh, so it’s not enough that I told you; it has to be in the right setting?” Iraise my eyebrows. “Next time should I brew some tea and make sure the lightingis right, too?”Tobias lets out a frustrated sound and turns away from me, pacing a few steps.When he turns back, his cheeks are splotchy. I can’t remember ever seeing hisface change color before.“Sometimes,” he says quietly, “it isn’t easy to be with you, Tris.” He looksaway.I want to tell him that I know it’s not easy, but I wouldn’t have made itthrough the past week without him. But I just stare at him, my heart pounding inmy ears.I can’t tell him I need him. I can’t need him, period—or really, we can’t needeach other, because who knows how long either of us will last in this war?“I’m sorry,” I say, all my anger gone. “I should have been honest with you.”“That’s it? That’s all you have to say?” He frowns.“What else do you want me to say?”He just shakes his head. “Nothing, Tris. Nothing.”I watch him walk away. I feel like a space has opened up within me, expanding sorapidly it will break me apart."},{"pageContent":"[images/00055.jpg]“OKAY, WHAT THE hell are you doing here?” a voice demands.I sit on a mattress in one of the hallways. I came here to do something, but Ilost my train of thought when I arrived, so I just sat down instead. I look up.Lynn—who I first met when she stomped on my toes in a Hancock buildingelevator—stands over me with raised eyebrows. Her hair is growing out—it’s stillshort, but I can’t see her skull anymore.“I’m sitting,” I say. “Why?”“You’re ridiculous, is what you are.” She sighs. “Get your stuff together.You’re Dauntless, and it’s time you acted like it. You’re giving us a badreputation among the Candor.”“How exactly am I doing that?”“By acting like you don’t know us.”“I’m just doing Christina a favor.”“Christina.” Lynn snorts. “She’s a lovesick puppy. People die. That’s whathappens in war. She’ll figure it out eventually.”“Yeah, people die, but it’s not always your good friend who kills them.”“Whatever.” Lynn sighs impatiently. “Come on.”I don’t see a reason to refuse. I get up and follow her down a series ofhallways. She moves at a brisk pace, and it’s difficult to keep up with her.“Where’s your scary boyfriend?” she says.My lips pucker like I just tasted something sour. “He’s not scary.”“Sure he’s not.” She smirks.“I don’t know where he is.”She shrugs. “Well, you can grab him a bunk, too. We’re trying to forget thoseDauntless-Erudite bastard children. Pull together again.”I laugh. “Dauntless-Erudite bastard children, huh.”She pushes a door open, and we stand in a large, open room that reminds me ofthe building’s lobby. Unsurprisingly, the floors are black with a huge whitesymbol in the center of the room, but most of it has been covered up with bunkbeds. Dauntless men, women, and children are everywhere, and there isn’t asingle Candor in sight.Lynn leads me to the left side of the room and between the rows of bunks. Shelooks at the boy sitting on one of the bottom bunks—he is a few years youngerthan we are, and he’s trying to undo a knot in his shoelaces.“Hec,” she says, “you’re going to have to find another bunk.”“What? No way,” he says without looking up. “I’m not relocating again justbecause you want to have late-night pillow chats with one of your stupidfriends.”“She is not my friend,” snaps Lynn. I almost laugh. She’s right—the first thingshe did when she met me was stomp on my toes. “Hec, this is Tris. Tris, this ismy little brother, Hector.”At the sound of my name, his head jerks up, and he stares at me, openmouthed.“Nice to meet you,” I say.“You’re Divergent,” he says. “My mom said to stay away from you because youmight be dangerous.”“Yeah. She’s a big scary Divergent, and she’s going to make your head explodewith only the power of her brain,” says Lynn, jabbing him between the eyes withher index finger. “Don’t tell me you actually believe all that kid stuff aboutthe Divergent.”He turns bright red and snatches some of his things from a pile next to the bed.I feel bad for making him move until I see him toss his things down a few bunksover. He doesn’t have to go far.“I could have done that,” I say. “Slept over there, I mean.”“Yeah, I know.” Lynn grins. “He deserves it. He called Zeke a traitor right toUriah’s face. It’s not like it’s not true, but that’s no reason to be a jerkabout it. I think Candor is rubbing off on him. He feels like he can just saywhatever he wants. Hey, Mar!”Marlene pokes her head around one of the bunks and smiles toothily at me.“Hey, Tris!” says Marlene. “Welcome. What’s up, Lynn?”“Can you get some of the smaller girls to give up a few pieces of clothingeach?” Lynn says, “Not all shirts, though. Jeans, underwear, maybe a spare pairof shoes?”“Sure,” says Marlene.I put my knife down next to the bottom bunk.“What ‘kid stuff’ were you referring to?” I say.“The Divergent. People with special brainpowers? Come on.” She shrugs. “I knowyou believe in it, but I don’t.”“So how do you explain me being awake during simulations?” I say. “Or resistingone entirely?”“I think the leaders choose people at random and change the simulations forthem.”“Why would they do that?”She waves her hand in my face. “Distraction. You’re so busy worrying about theDivergent—like my mom—that you forget to worry about what the leaders are doing.It’s just a different kind of mind control.”Her eyes skirt mine, and she kicks at the marble floor with the toe of her shoe.I wonder if she’s remembering the last time she was on mind control. During theattack simulation.I have been so focused on what happened to Abnegation that I almost forgot whathappened to Dauntless. Hundreds of Dauntless woke to discover the black mark ofmurder on them, and they didn’t even choose it for themselves.I decide not to argue with her. If she wants to believe in a governmentconspiracy, I don’t think I can dissuade her. She would have to experience itfor herself.“I come bearing clothes,” says Marlene, stepping in front of our bunk. She holdsa stack of black clothes the size of her torso, which she offers to me with aproud look on her face. “I even guilt-tripped your sister into handing over adress, Lynn. She brought three.”“You have a sister?” I ask Lynn.“Yeah,” she says, “she’s eighteen. She was in Four’s initiate class.”“What’s her name?”“Shauna,” she says. She looks at Marlene. “I told her none of us would needdresses anytime soon, but she didn’t listen, as usual.”I remember Shauna. She was one of the people who caught me after zip lining.“I think it would be easier to fight in a dress,” says Marlene, tapping herchin. “It would give your legs freer movement. And who really cares if you flashpeople your underwear, as long as you’re kicking the crap out of them?”Lynn goes silent, like she recognizes that as a spark of brilliance but can’tbring herself to admit it.“What’s this about flashing underwear?” says Uriah, sidestepping a bunk.“Whatever it is, I’m in.”Marlene punches him in the arm.“Some of us are going to the Hancock building tonight,” says Uriah. “You shouldall come. We’re leaving at ten.”“Zip lining?” says Lynn.“No. Surveillance. We’ve heard the Erudite keep their lights on all night, whichwill make it easier to look through their windows. See what they’re doing.”“I’ll go,” I say.“Me too,” says Lynn.“What? Oh. Me too,” Marlene says, smiling at Uriah. “I’m going to get food. Wantto come?”“Sure,” he says.Marlene waves as they walk away. She used to walk with a lift in her step, likeshe was skipping. Now her steps are smoother—more elegant, maybe, but lackingthe childish joy I associate with her. I wonder what she did when she was underthe simulation.Lynn’s mouth puckers.“What?” I say.“Nothing,” she snaps. She shakes her head. “They’ve just been hanging out aloneall the time lately.”“He needs all the friends he can get, it sounds like,” I say. “What with Zekeand all.”“Yeah. What a nightmare that was. One day he was here, and the next …” Shesighs. “No matter how long you train someone to be brave, you never know if theyare or not until something real happens.”Her eyes fix on mine. I never noticed before how strange they are, a goldenbrown. And now that her hair has grown in somewhat, and her baldness isn’t thefirst thing I see, I also notice her delicate nose, her full lips—she isstriking without trying to be. I am envious of her for a moment, and then Ithink she must hate it, and that’s why she shaved her head.“You are brave,” she says. “You don’t need me to say it, because you alreadyknow it. But I want you to know that I know.”She is complimenting me, but I still feel like she smacked me with something.Then she adds, “Don’t mess it up.” A few hours later, after I’ve eaten lunch and taken a nap, I sit down on theedge of my bed to change the bandage on my shoulder. I take off my T-shirt,leaving my tank top on—there are a lot of Dauntless around, gathering betweenthe bunks, laughing at one another’s jokes. I have just finished applying morehealing salve when I hear a shriek of laughter. Uriah charges down the aislebetween the bunks with Marlene thrown over his shoulder. She waves at me as theypass, her face red.Lynn, who is sitting on the next bunk, snorts. “I don’t see how he can beflirty, with everything that’s going on.”“He’s supposed to shuffle around, scowling all the time?” I say, reaching overmy shoulder to press the bandage to my skin. “Maybe you can learn something fromhim.”“You’re one to talk,” she says. “You’re always moping. We should start callingyou Beatrice Prior, Queen of Tragedy.”I stand and punch her arm, harder than if I was kidding, softer than if I wasserious. “Shut up.”Without looking at me, she shoves my shoulder into the bunk. “I don’t takeorders from Stiffs.”I notice a slight curl in her lip and suppress a grin myself.“Ready to go?” Lynn says.“Where are you going?” Tobias says, slipping between his bunk and mine to standin the aisle with us. My mouth feels dry. I haven’t spoken to him all day, andI’m not sure what to expect. Will it be awkward, or will we go back to normal?“Top of the Hancock building to spy on Erudite,” Lynn says. “Want to come?”Tobias gives me a look. “No, I’ve got a few things to take care of here. But becareful.”I nod. I know why he doesn’t want to come—Tobias tries to avoid heights, if atall possible. He touches my arm, holding me back for just a moment. I tenseup—he hasn’t touched me since before our fight—and he releases me.“I’ll see you later,” he mutters. “Don’t do anything stupid.”“Thanks for that vote of confidence,” I say, frowning.“I didn’t mean that,” he says. “I meant don’t let anyone else do anythingstupid. They’ll listen to you.”He leans toward me like he’s going to kiss me, then seems to think better of itand leans back, biting his lip. It’s a small act, but it still feels likerejection. I avoid his eyes and run after Lynn.Lynn and I walk down the hallway toward the elevator bank. Some of the Dauntlesshave started to mark the walls with colored squares. Candor headquarters is likea maze to them, and they want to learn to navigate it. I know only how to get tothe most basic places: the sleeping area, the cafeteria, the lobby, theinterrogation room.“Why did everyone leave Dauntless headquarters?” I say. “The traitors aren’tthere, are they?”“No, they’re at Erudite headquarters. We left because Dauntless headquarters hasthe most surveillance cameras of any area in the city,” Lynn says. “We knew theErudite could probably access all the footage, and that it would take forever tofind all the cameras, so we thought it was best to just leave.”“Smart.”“We have our moments.”Lynn jabs her finger into the button for the first floor. I stare at ourreflections in the doors. She’s taller than I am by just a few inches, andthough her baggy shirt and pants try to obscure it, I can tell that her bodybends and curves like it’s supposed to.“What?” she says, scowling at me.“Why did you shave your head?”“Initiation,” she says. “I love Dauntless, but Dauntless guys don’t seeDauntless girls as a threat during initiation. I got sick of it. So I figured,if I don’t look so much like a girl, maybe they won’t look at me that way.”“I think you could have used being underestimated to your advantage.”“Yeah, and what? Acted all faint every time something scary came around?” Lynnrolls her eyes. “Do you think I have zero dignity or something?”“I think a mistake the Dauntless make is refusing to be cunning,” I say. “Youdon’t always have to smack people in the face with how strong you are.”“Maybe you should dress in blue from now on,” she says, “if you’re going to actlike such an Erudite. Plus, you do the same thing, but without the headshaving.”I slip out of the elevator before I say something I’ll regret. Lynn is quick toforgive, but quick to ignite, like most Dauntless. Like me, except for the“quick to forgive” part.As usual, a few Dauntless with large guns cross back and forth in front of thedoors, watching for intruders. Just in front of them stands a small group ofyounger Dauntless, including Uriah; Marlene; Lynn’s sister, Shauna; and Lauren,who taught the Dauntless-born initiates as Four taught the faction transfersduring initiation. Her ear gleams when she moves her head—it is pierced from topto bottom.Lynn stops short, and I step on her heel. She swears.“What a charmer you are,” says Shauna, smiling at Lynn. They don’t look muchalike, except for their hair color, which is a medium brown, but Shauna’s ischin length, like mine.“Yes, that’s my goal. To be charming,” Lynn replies.Shauna drapes an arm across Lynn’s shoulders. It’s strange to see Lynn with asister—to see Lynn with a connection to someone at all. Shauna glances at me,her smile disappearing. She looks wary.“Hi,” I say, because there’s nothing else to say.“Hello,” she says.“Oh God, Mom’s gotten to you, too, hasn’t she.” Lynn covers her face with onehand. “Shauna—”“Lynn. Keep your mouth shut for once,” says Shauna, her eyes still on me. Sheseems tense, like she thinks I might attack her at any moment. With my specialbrainpowers.“Oh!” says Uriah, rescuing me. “Tris, do you know Lauren?”“Yeah,” Lauren says, before I can answer. Her voice is sharp and clear, likeshe’s scolding him, except it seems to be the way she naturally sounds. “Shewent through my fear landscape for practice during initiation. So she knows mebetter than she should, probably.”“Really? I thought the transfers would go through Four’s landscape,” says Uriah.“Like he would let anyone do that,” she says, snorting.Something inside me gets warm and soft. He let me go through it.I see a flicker of blue over Lauren’s shoulder, and peer around her to get abetter look.Then the guns go off.The glass doors explode into fragments. Dauntless soldiers with blue armbandsstand on the sidewalk outside, carrying guns I’ve never seen before, guns withnarrow, blue beams of light streaming from above their barrels.“Traitors!” someone screams.The Dauntless draw their guns, almost in unison. I do not have one to draw, so Iduck behind the wall of loyal Dauntless in front of me, my shoes crunchingpieces of glass beneath their soles, and pull my knife out of my back pocket.All around me, people drop to the ground. My fellow faction members. My closestfriends. All of them falling—they must be dead, or dying—as the earsplittingbang of bullets filling my ears.Then I freeze. One of the blue beams is fixed on my chest. I dive sideways toget out of the line of fire, but I don’t move fast enough.The gun goes off. I fall."},{"pageContent":"[images/00007.jpg]THE PAIN SUBSIDES to a dull ache. I slide my hand under my jacket and feel forthe wound.I’m not bleeding. But the force of the gunshot knocked me down, so I had to havebeen hit with something. I run my fingers over my shoulder, and feel a hard bumpwhere the skin used to be smooth.I hear a crack against the floor next to my face, and a metal cylinder about thesize of my hand rolls to a stop against my head. Before I can move it, whitesmoke sprays out of both ends. I cough, and throw it away from me, deeper intothe lobby. It isn’t the only cylinder, though—they are everywhere, filling theroom with smoke that does not burn or sting. In fact, it only obscures my viewfor a few seconds before evaporating completely.What was the point of that?Lying on the floor all around me are Dauntless soldiers with their eyes closed.I frown as I look Uriah up and down—he doesn’t seem to be bleeding. I see nowound near his vital organs, which means he isn’t dead. So what knocked himunconscious? I look over my left shoulder, where Lynn fell in a strange,half-curled position. She’s also unconscious.The Dauntless traitors walk into the lobby, their guns held up. I decide to dowhat I always do when I’m not sure what’s going on: I act like everyone else. Ilet my head drop and close my eyes. My heart pounds as the Dauntless’s footstepscome closer, and closer, squeaking on the marble floors. I bite my tongue tosuppress a cry of pain as one of them steps on my hand.“Not sure why we can’t just shoot them all in the head,” one of them says. “Ifthere’s no army, we win.”“Now, Bob, we can’t just kill everyone,” a cold voice says.The hair on the back of my neck stands up. I would know that voice anywhere. Itbelongs to Eric, leader of the Dauntless.“No people means no one left to create prosperous conditions,” Eric continues.“Anyway, it’s not your job to ask questions.” He raises his voice. “Half in theelevators, half in the stairwells, left and right! Go!”There’s a gun a few feet to my left. If I opened my eyes, I could grab it andfire at him before he knew what hit him. But there’s no guarantee I would beable to touch it without panicking again.I wait until I hear the last footstep disappear behind an elevator door or intoa stairwell before opening my eyes. Everyone in the lobby appears to beunconscious. Whatever they gassed us with, it had to be simulation-inducing or Iwouldn’t be the only one awake. It doesn’t make any sense—it doesn’t follow thesimulation rules I’m familiar with—but I don’t have time to think it through.I grab my knife and get up, trying to ignore the ache in my shoulder. I run overto one of the dead Dauntless traitors near the doorway. She was middle-aged;there are hints of gray in her dark hair. I try not to look at the bullet woundin her head, but the dim light glows on what looks like bone, and I gag.Think. I don’t care who she was, or what her name was, or how old she was. Icare only about the blue armband she wears. I have to focus on that. I try tohook my finger around the fabric, but it doesn’t come loose. It appears to beattached to her black jacket. I will have to take that, too.I unzip my jacket and toss it over her face so I don’t have to look at her. ThenI unzip her jacket and pull it, first from her left arm, and then from her rightarm, gritting my teeth as I slide it from beneath her heavy body.“Tris!” someone says. I turn around, jacket in one hand, knife in the other. Iput the knife away—the invading Dauntless weren’t carrying them, and I don’twant to be conspicuous.Uriah stands behind me.“Divergent?” I ask him. There is no time to be shocked.“Yeah,” he says.“Get a jacket,” I say.He crouches next to one of the other Dauntless traitors, this one young, noteven old enough to be a Dauntless member. I flinch at the sight of hisdeath-pale face. Someone so young shouldn’t be dead; shouldn’t even have beenhere in the first place.My face hot with anger, I shrug the woman’s jacket on. Uriah pulls his ownjacket on, his mouth pinched.“They’re the only ones who are dead,” he says quietly. “Something about thatseem wrong to you?”“They must have known we would shoot at them, but they came anyway,” I say.“Questions later. We have to get up there.”“Up there? Why?” he says. “We should get out of here.”“You want to run away before you know what’s going on?” I scowl at him. “Beforethe Dauntless upstairs know what hit them?”“What if someone recognizes us?”I shrug. “We just have to hope they won’t.”I sprint toward the stairwell, and he follows me. As soon as my foot touches thefirst stair, I wonder what on earth I intend to do. There are bound to be moreof the Divergent in this building, but will they know what they are? Will theyknow to hide? And what do I expect to gain from submerging myself in an army ofDauntless traitors?Deep inside me I know the answer: I am being reckless. I will probably gainnothing. I will probably die.And more disturbing still: I don’t really care.“They’ll work their way upward,” I say between breaths. “So you should … go tothe third floor. Tell them to … evacuate. Quietly.”“Where are you going, then?”“Floor two,” I say. I shove my shoulder into the second-floor door. I know whatto do on the second floor: look for the Divergent. As I walk down the hallway, stepping over unconscious people dressed in blackand white, I think of a verse of the song Candor children used to sing when theythought no one could hear them:Dauntless is the cruelest of the fiveThey tear each other to pieces….It has never seemed truer to me than now, watching Dauntless traitors induce asleeping simulation that is not so different from the one that forced them tokill members of Abnegation not a month ago.We are the only faction that could divide like this. Amity would not allow aschism; no one in Abnegation would be so selfish; Candor would argue until theyfound a common solution; and even Erudite would never do something so illogical.We really are the cruelest faction.I step over a draped arm and a woman with her mouth hanging open, and hum thebeginning of the next verse of the song under my breath.Erudite is the coldest of the fiveKnowledge is a costly thing….I wonder when Jeanine realized that Erudite and Dauntless would make a deadlycombination. Ruthlessness and cold logic, it seems, can accomplish almostanything, including putting one and a half factions to sleep.I scan faces and bodies as I walk, searching for irregular breaths, flickeringeyelids, anything to suggest that the people lying on the ground are justpretending to be unconscious. So far, all the breathing is even and all theeyelids are still. Maybe none of the Candor are Divergent.“Eric!” I hear someone shout from down the hall. I hold my breath as he walksright toward me. I try not to move. If I move, he’ll look at me, and he’llrecognize me, I know it. I look down, and tense so hard I tremble. Don’t look atme don’t look at me don’t look at me …Eric strides past me and down the hallway to my left. I should continue mysearch as quickly as possible, but curiosity urges me forward, toward whoevercalled for Eric. The shout sounded urgent.When I lift my eyes, I see a Dauntless soldier standing over a kneeling woman.She wears a white blouse and a black skirt, and has her hands behind her head.Eric’s smile looks greedy even in profile.“Divergent,” he says. “Well done. Bring her to the elevator bank. We’ll decidewhich ones to kill and which ones to bring back later.”The Dauntless soldier grabs the woman by the ponytail and starts toward theelevator bank, dragging her behind him. She shrieks, and then scrambles to herfeet, bent over. I try to swallow but it feels like I have a wad of cotton ballsin my throat.Eric continues down the hallway, away from me, and I try not to stare as theCandor woman stumbles past me, her hair still trapped in the fist of theDauntless soldier. By now I know how terror works: I let it control me for a fewseconds, and then force myself to act.One … two … three …I start forward with a new sense of purpose. Watching each person to see ifthey’re awake is taking too much time. The next unconscious person I comeacross, I step hard on their pinkie finger. No response, not even a twitch. Istep over them and find the next person’s finger, pressing hard with the toe ofmy shoe. No response there either.I hear someone else shout, “Got one!” from a distant hallway and start to feelfrantic. I hop over fallen man after fallen woman, over children and teenagersand the elderly, stepping on fingers or stomachs or ankles, searching for signsof pain. I barely see their faces after a while, but still I get no response. Iam playing hide-and-seek with the Divergent, but I’m not the only person who’s“it.”And then it happens. I step on a Candor girl’s pinkie, and her face twitches.Just a little—an impressive attempt at concealing the pain—but enough to catchmy attention.I look over my shoulder to see if anyone is near me, but they’ve all moved onfrom this central hallway. I check for the nearest stairwell—there’s one justten feet away, down a side hallway to my right. I crouch next to the girl’shead.“Hey, kid,” I say as quietly as I can. “It’s okay. I’m not one of them.”Her eyes open, just a little.“There’s a staircase about three yards away,” I say. “I’ll tell you when no oneis watching, and then you have to run, understand?”She nods.I stand and turn in a slow circle. A Dauntless traitor to my left is lookingaway, nudging a limp Dauntless with her foot. Two Dauntless traitors behind meare laughing about something. One in front of me is spacing out in my direction,but then he lifts his head and starts down the hallway again, away from me.“Now,” I say.The girl gets up and sprints toward the door to the stairwell. I watch her untilthe door clicks shut, and see my reflection in one of the windows. But I’m notstanding alone in a hallway of sleeping people, like I thought. Eric is standingright behind me. I look at his reflection, and he looks back at me. I could make a break for it.If I move fast enough, he might not have the presence of mind to grab me. But Iknow, even as the idea occurs to me, that I won’t be able to outrun him. And Iwon’t be able to shoot him, because I didn’t take a gun.I spin around, bringing my elbow up as I do, and thrust it toward Eric’s face.It catches the end of his chin, but not hard enough to do any damage. He grabsmy left arm with one hand and presses a gun barrel to my forehead with theother, smiling down at me.“I don’t understand,” he says, “how you could possibly be stupid enough to comeup here with no gun.”“Well, I’m smart enough to do this,” I say. I stomp hard on his foot, which Ifired a bullet into less than a month ago. He screams, his face contorting, anddrives the heel of the gun into my jaw. I clench my teeth to suppress a groan.Blood trickles down my neck—he broke the skin.Through all that, his grip on my arm does not loosen once. But the fact that hedidn’t just shoot me in the head tells me something: He’s not allowed to kill meyet.“I was surprised to discover you were still alive,” he says. “Considering I’mthe one who told Jeanine to construct that water tank just for you.”I try to figure out what I can do that will be painful enough for him to releaseme. I’ve just decided on a hard kick to the groin when he slips behind me andgrabs me by both arms, pressing against me so I can barely move my feet. Hisfingernails dig into my skin, and I grit my teeth, both from the pain and fromthe sickening feeling of his chest on my back.“She thought studying one of the Divergent’s reaction to a real-life version ofa simulation would be fascinating,” he says, and he presses me forward so I haveto walk. His breath tickles my hair. “And I agreed. You see, ingenuity—one ofthe qualities we most value in Erudite—requires creativity.”He twists his hands so the calluses scrape against my arms. I shift my bodyslightly to the left as I walk, trying to position one of my feet between hisadvancing feet. I notice with fierce pleasure that he’s limping.“Sometimes creativity seems wasteful, illogical … unless it’s done for a greaterpurpose. In this case, the accumulation of knowledge.”I stop walking just long enough to bring my heel up, hard, between his legs. Ahigh-pitched cry hitches in his throat, stopped before it really began, and hishands go limp for just a moment. In that moment, I twist my body as hard as Ican and break free. I don’t know where I will run, but I have to run, I have to—He grabs my elbow, yanking me back, and pushes his thumb into the wound in myshoulder, twisting until pain makes my vision go black at the edges, and Iscream at the top of my lungs.“I thought I recalled from the footage of you in that water tank that you gotshot in that shoulder,” he says. “It seems I was right.”My knees crumple beneath me, and he grabs my collar almost carelessly, draggingme toward the elevator bank. The fabric digs into my throat, choking me, and Istumble after him. My body throbs with lingering pain.When we reach the elevator bank, he forces me to my knees next to the Candorwoman I saw earlier. She and four others sit between the two rows of elevators,kept in place by Dauntless with guns.“I want one gun on her at all times,” says Eric. “Not just aimed at her. Onher.”A Dauntless man pushes a gun barrel into the back of my neck. It forms a coldcircle on my skin. I lift my eyes to Eric. His face is red, his eyes watering.“What’s the matter, Eric?” I say, raising my eyebrows. “Afraid of a littlegirl?”“I’m not stupid,” he says, pushing his hands through his hair. “That little-girlact may have worked on me before, but it won’t work again. You’re the bestattack dog they’ve got.” He leans closer to me. “Which is why I’m sure you’ll beput down soon enough.”One of the elevator doors opens, and a Dauntless soldier shoves Uriah—whose lipsare stained with blood—toward the short row of the Divergent. Uriah glances atme, but I can’t read his expression well enough to know if he succeeded orfailed. If he’s here, he probably failed. Now they’ll find all the Divergent inthe building, and most of us will die.I should probably be afraid. But instead a hysterical laugh bubbles inside me,because I just remembered something:Maybe I can’t hold a gun. But I have a knife in my back pocket."},{"pageContent":"[images/00003.jpg]I SHIFT MY hand back, centimeter by centimeter, so the soldier pointing a gun atme doesn’t notice. The elevator doors open again, bringing more of the Divergentwith more Dauntless traitors. The Candor woman on my right whimpers. Strands ofher hair are stuck to her lips, which are wet with spit, or tears, I can’t tell.My hand reaches the corner of my back pocket. I keep it steady, my fingersshaking with anticipation. I have to wait for the right moment, when Eric isclose.I focus on the mechanics of my breathing, imagining air filling every part of mylungs as I inhale, then remembering as I exhale how all my blood, oxygenated andunoxygenated, travels to and from the same heart.It’s easier to think of biology than the line of the Divergent sitting betweenthe elevators. A Candor boy who can’t be older than eleven sits to my left. He’sbraver than the woman to my right—he stares at the Dauntless soldier in front ofhim, unflinching.Air in, air out. Blood pushed all the way to my extremities—the heart is apowerful muscle, the strongest muscle in the body in terms of longevity. MoreDauntless arrive, reporting successful sweeps of specific floors of theMerciless Mart. Hundreds of people unconscious on the floor, shot with somethingother than bullets, and I have no idea why.But I am thinking of the heart. Not of my heart anymore, but of Eric’s, and howempty his chest will sound when his heart is no longer beating. Despite how muchI hate him, I don’t really want to kill him, at least not with a knife, up closewhere I can see the life leave him. But I have one chance left to do somethinguseful, and if I want to hit the Erudite where it hurts, I have to take one oftheir leaders from them.I notice that no one ever brought the Candor girl I warned to the elevator bank,which means she must have gotten away. Good.Eric clasps his hands behind his back and begins to pace, back and forth, beforethe line of Divergent.“My orders are to take only two of you back to Erudite headquarters fortesting,” says Eric. “The rest of you are to be executed. There are several waysto determine who among you will be least useful to us.”His footsteps slow when he approaches me. I tense my fingers, about to grab theknife handle, but he doesn’t come close enough. He keeps walking and stops infront of the boy to my left.“The brain finishes developing at age twenty-five,” says Eric. “Therefore yourDivergence is not completely developed.”He lifts his gun and fires.A strangled scream leaps out of my body as the boy slumps to the ground, and Isqueeze my eyes shut. Every muscle in my body strains toward him, but I holdmyself back. Wait, wait, wait. I can’t think of the boy. Wait. I force my eyesopen and blink tears from them.My scream accomplished one thing: now Eric stands in front of me, smiling. Icaught his attention.“You are also rather young,” he says. “Nowhere near finished developing.”He steps toward me. My fingertips inch closer to the knife handle.“Most of the Divergent get two results in the aptitude test. Some only get one.No one has ever gotten three, not because of aptitude, but simply because inorder to get that result, you have to refuse to choose something,” he says,moving closer still. I tilt my head back to look at him, at all the metalgleaming in his face, at his empty eyes.“My superiors suspect that you got two, Tris,” he says. “They don’t think you’rethat complex—just an even blend of Abnegation and Dauntless—selfless to thepoint of idiocy. Or is that brave to the point of idiocy?”I close my hand around the knife handle and squeeze. He leans closer.“Just between you and me … I think you might have gotten three, because you’rethe kind of bullheaded person who would refuse to make a simple choice justbecause she was told to,” he says. “Care to enlighten me?”I lurch forward, pulling my hand out of my pocket. I close my eyes as I thrustthe blade up and toward him. I don’t want to see his blood.I feel the knife go in and then pull it out again. My entire body throbs to therhythm of my heart. The back of my neck is sticky with sweat. I open my eyes asEric slumps to the ground, and then—chaos.The Dauntless traitors aren’t holding lethal guns, only ones that shoot whateverit is they shot at us before, so they all scramble for their real guns. As theydo, Uriah launches himself at one of them and punches him hard in the jaw. Thelife goes out of the soldier’s eyes and he falls, knocked out. Uriah takes thesoldier’s gun and starts shooting at the Dauntless closest to us.I reach for Eric’s gun, so panicked I can barely see, and when I look up, Iswear the amount of Dauntless in the room has doubled. Gunshots fill my ears,and I drop to the ground as everyone starts running. My fingers brush the gunbarrel, and I shudder. My hands are too weak to grasp it.A heavy arm wraps around my shoulders and shoves me toward the wall. My rightshoulder burns, and I see the Dauntless symbol tattooed on the back of a neck.Tobias turns, crouched around me to shield me from the gunfire, and shoots.“Tell me if anyone’s behind me!” he says.I peer over his shoulder, curling my hands into fists around his shirt.There are more Dauntless in the room, Dauntless without blue armbands—loyalDauntless. My faction. My faction has come to save us. How are they awake?The Dauntless traitors sprint away from the elevator bank. They were notprepared for an attack, not from all sides. Some of them fight back, but mostrun for the stairs. Tobias fires over and over again, until his gun runs out ofbullets, and the trigger makes a clicking sound instead. My vision is too blurrywith tears and my hands too useless to fire a gun. I scream into gritted teeth,frustrated. I can’t help. I am worthless.On the floor, Eric moans. Still alive, for now.The gunshots gradually stop. My hand is wet. One glimpse of red tells me it’scovered in blood—Eric’s. I wipe it off on my pants and try to blink the tearsaway. My ears ring.“Tris,” Tobias says. “You can put the knife down now.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00012.jpg]TOBIAS TELLS ME this story:When the Erudite reached the lobby stairwell, one of them didn’t go up to thesecond floor. Instead, she ran up to one of the highest levels of the building.There she evacuated a group of loyal Dauntless—including Tobias—to a fire escapethe Dauntless traitors had not sealed off. Those loyal Dauntless gathered in thelobby and split into four groups that stormed the stairwells simultaneously,surrounding the Dauntless traitors, who had clustered around the elevator banks.The Dauntless traitors were not prepared for that much resistance. They thoughteveryone but the Divergent was unconscious, so they ran.The Erudite woman was Cara. Will’s older sister. Heaving a sigh, I let the jacket slide from my arms and examine my shoulder. Ametal disc about the size of my pinkie fingernail is pressed against my skin.Surrounding it is a patch of blue strands, like someone injected blue dye intothe tiny veins just beneath the surface of my skin. Frowning, I try to peel themetal disc away from my arm, and feel a sharp pain.Gritting my teeth, I wedge the flat of my knife blade under the disc and forceit up. I scream into my teeth as the pain races through me, making everything goblack for a moment. But I keep pushing, as hard as I can, until the disc liftsfrom my skin enough for me to get my fingers around it. Attached to the bottomof the disc is a needle.I gag, grasp the disc in my fingertips, and pull one last time. This time, theneedle comes free. It’s as long as my littlest finger and smeared with my blood.I ignore the blood running down my arm and hold the disc and the needle up tothe light above the sink.Judging by the blue dye in my arm and the needle, they must have injected uswith something. But what? Poison? An explosive?I shake my head. If they had wanted to kill us, most of us were unconsciousalready, so they could have just shot us all. Whatever they injected us withisn’t meant to kill us.Someone knocks on the door. I don’t know why—I’m in a public restroom, afterall.“Tris, you in there?” Uriah’s muffled voice asks.“Yeah,” I call back.Uriah looks better than he did an hour ago—he washed the blood from his mouth,and some of the color has returned to his face. I’m struck, suddenly, by howhandsome he is—all his features are proportionate, his eyes dark and lively, hisskin bronze-brown. And he has probably always been that handsome. Only boys whohave been handsome from a young age have that arrogance in their smile.Not like Tobias, who is almost shy when he smiles, like he is surprised youbothered to look at him in the first place.My throat aches. I put the needle and disc on the edge of the sink.Uriah looks from me to the needle in my hand to the line of blood running frommy shoulder to my wrist.“Gross,” he says.“Wasn’t paying attention,” I say. I set the needle down and grab a paper towel,mopping up the blood on my arm. “How are the others?”“Marlene’s cracking jokes, as usual.” Uriah’s smile grows, putting a dimple inhis cheek. “Lynn’s grumbling. Wait, you yanked that out of your own arm?” Hepoints to the needle. “God, Tris. Do you have no nerve endings or something?”“I think I need a bandage.”“You think?” Uriah shakes his head. “You should get some ice for your face, too.So, everyone’s waking up now. It’s a madhouse out there.”I touch my jaw. It is tender where Eric’s gun struck me—I will have to puthealing salve on it so it doesn’t bruise.“Is Eric dead?” I don’t know which answer I’m hoping for, yes or no.“No. Some of the Candor decided to give him medical treatment.” Uriah scowls atthe sink. “Something about honorable treatment of prisoners. Kang’sinterrogating him in private right now. Doesn’t want us there, disturbing thepeace or whatever.”I snort.“Yeah. Anyway, no one gets it,” he says, perching on the edge of the sink nextto mine. “Why storm in here and fire those things at us and then knock us allout? Why not just kill us?”“No idea,” I say. “The only use I see for it is that it helped them figure outwho’s Divergent and who’s not. But that can’t be the only reason they did it.”“I don’t get why they have it out for us. I mean, when they were trying to mindcontrol themselves an army, sure, but now? Seems useless.”I frown as I press a clean paper towel to my shoulder, to stop the bleeding.He’s right. Jeanine already has an army. So why kill the Divergent now?“Jeanine doesn’t want to kill everyone,” I say slowly. “She knows that would beillogical. Without each faction, society doesn’t function, because each factiontrains its members for particular jobs. What she wants is control.”I glance up at my reflection. My jaw is swollen, and fingernail marks are stillon my arms. Disgusting.“She must be planning another simulation,” I say. “Same thing as before, butthis time, she wants to make sure that everyone is either under its influence ordead.”“But the simulation only lasts for a certain period of time,” he says. “It’s notuseful unless you’re trying to accomplish something specific.”“Right.” I sigh. “I don’t know. I don’t get it.” I pick up the needle. “I don’tget what this thing is either. If it was like the other simulation-inducinginjections, it was just meant for one use. So why shoot these things at us justto put us unconscious? It doesn’t make any sense.”“I dunno, Tris, but right now we’ve got a huge building full of panicked peopleto deal with. Let’s go get you a bandage.” He pauses and then says, “Can you dome a favor?”“What is it?”“Don’t tell anyone I’m Divergent.” He bites his lip. “Shauna’s my friend, and Idon’t want her to suddenly become afraid of me.”“Sure,” I say, forcing a smile. “I’ll keep it to myself.” I am awake all night removing needles from people’s arms. After a few hours Istop trying to be gentle. I just pull as hard as I can.I find out that the Candor boy Eric shot in the head was named Bobby, and thatEric is in stable condition, and that of the hundreds of people in the MercilessMart, only eighty don’t have needles buried in their flesh, seventy of whom areDauntless, one of whom is Christina. All night I puzzle over needles and serumsand simulations, trying to inhabit the minds of my enemies.In the morning, I run out of needles to remove and go to the cafeteria, rubbingmy eyes. Jack Kang announced that we would have a meeting at noon, so maybe Ican fit in a long nap after I eat.When I walk into the cafeteria, though, I see Caleb.Caleb runs up to me and folds me carefully into his arms. I breathe a sigh ofrelief. I thought I had gotten to the point where I didn’t need my brotheranymore, but I don’t think such a point actually exists. I relax against him fora moment, and catch Tobias’s eye over Caleb’s shoulder.“Are you all right?” Caleb says, pulling back. “Your jaw …”“It’s nothing,” I say. “Just swollen.”“I heard they got a bunch of the Divergent and started shooting them. Thank Godthey didn’t find you.”“Actually, they did. But they only killed one,” I say. I pinch the bridge of mynose to relieve some of the pressure in my head. “But I’m all right. When didyou get here?”“About ten minutes ago. I came with Marcus,” he says. “As our only legalpolitical leader, he felt it was his duty to be here—we didn’t hear about theattack until an hour ago. One of the factionless saw the Dauntless storming intothe building, and news takes a while to travel among the factionless.”“Marcus is alive?” I say. We never actually saw him die when we escaped theAmity compound, but I just assumed he had—I’m not sure how I feel. Disappointed,maybe, because I hate him for how he treated Tobias? Or relieved, because thelast Abnegation leader is still alive? Is it possible to feel both?“He and Peter escaped, and walked back to the city,” says Caleb.I am not at all relieved to find out that Peter is still alive. “Where’s Peter,then?”“He is where you would expect him to be,” Caleb replies.“Erudite,” I say. I shake my head. “What a—”I can’t even think of a word strong enough to describe him. Apparently I need toexpand my vocabulary.Caleb’s face twists for a moment, then he nods and touches my shoulder. “Are youhungry? Want me to get you something?”“Yes, please,” I say. “I’ll be back in a little while, okay? I have to talk toTobias.”“All right.” Caleb squeezes my arm and walks off, probably to get in themiles-long cafeteria line. Tobias and I stand yards away from each other for afew seconds.He approaches me slowly.“You okay?” he says.“I might throw up if I have to answer that one more time,” I say. “I don’t havea bullet in my head, do I? So I’m good.”“Your jaw is so swollen you look like you have a wad of food in your cheek, andyou just stabbed Eric,” he says, frowning. “I’m not allowed to ask if you’reokay?”I sigh. I should tell him about Marcus, but I don’t want to do it here, with somany people around. “Yeah. I’m okay.”His arm jerks like he was thinking of touching me but decided against it. Thenhe reconsiders and slides his arm around me, pulling me to him.Suddenly I think maybe I’ll let someone else take all the risks, maybe I’ll juststart acting selfishly so that I can stay close to Tobias without hurting him.All I want is to bury my face in his neck and forget anything else exists.“I’m sorry it took me so long to come get you,” he whispers into my hair.I sigh and touch his back with just my fingertips. I could stand here until I gounconscious from exhaustion, but I shouldn’t; I can’t. I pull back and say, “Ineed to talk to you. Can we go somewhere quiet?”He nods, and we leave the cafeteria. One of the Dauntless we pass yells, “Oh,look! It’s Tobias Eaton!”I had almost forgotten about the interrogation, and the name it revealed to allof Dauntless.Another one yells, “I saw your daddy here earlier, Eaton! Are you gonna gohide?”Tobias straightens and stiffens, like someone is training a gun at his chestinstead of jeering at him.“Yeah, are you gonna hide, coward?”A few people around us laugh. I grab Tobias’s arm and steer him toward theelevators before he can react. He looked like he was about to punch someone. Orworse.“I was going to tell you—he came with Caleb,” I say. “He and Peter escapedAmity—”“What were you waiting for, then?” he says, but not harshly. His voice soundssomehow detached from him, like it is floating between us.“It’s not the kind of news you deliver in a cafeteria,” I say.“Fair enough,” he says.We wait in silence for the elevator, Tobias chewing on his lip and staring intospace. He does that all the way to the eighteenth floor, which is empty. There,the silence wraps around me like Caleb’s embrace did, calming me. I sit down onone of the benches on the edge of the interrogation room, and Tobias pullsNiles’s chair over to sit in front of me.“Didn’t there used to be two of these?” he says, frowning at the chair.“Yeah,” I say. “I, uh … it got thrown out the window.”“Strange,” he says. He sits. “So what did you want to talk about? Or was thatabout Marcus?”“No, that wasn’t it. Are you … all right?” I say cautiously.“I don’t have a bullet in my head, do I?” he says, staring at his hands. “So I’mfine. I’d like to talk about something else.”“I want to talk about simulations,” I say. “But first, something else—yourmother thought Jeanine would go after the factionless next. Obviously she waswrong—and I’m not sure why. It’s not like the Candor are battle ready oranything—”“Well, think about it,” he says. “Think it through, like the Erudite.”I give him a look.“What?” he says. “If you can’t, the rest of us have no hope.”“Fine,” I say. “Um … it had to be because Dauntless and Candor were the mostlogical targets. Because … the factionless are in multiple places, whereas we’reall in the same place.”“Right,” he says. “Also, when Jeanine attacked Abnegation, she got all theAbnegation data. My mother told me that the Abnegation had documented thefactionless Divergent populations, which means that after the attack, Jeaninemust have found out that the proportion of Divergent among the factionless ishigher than among the Candor. That makes them an illogical target.”“All right. Then tell me about the serum again,” I say. “It has a few parts,right?”“Two,” he says, nodding. “The transmitter and the liquid that induces thesimulation. The transmitter communicates information to the brain from thecomputer, and vice versa, and the liquid alters the brain to put it in asimulation state.”I nod. “And the transmitter only works for one simulation, right? What happensto it after that?”“It dissolves,” he says. “As far as I know, the Erudite haven’t been able todevelop a transmitter that lasts for more than one simulation, although theattack simulation lasted far longer than any simulation I’ve seen before.”The words “as far as I know” stick in my mind. Jeanine has spent most of heradult life developing the serums. If she’s still hunting down the Divergent,she’s probably still obsessed with creating more advanced versions of thetechnology.“What’s this about, Tris?” he says.“Have you seen this yet?” I say, pointing at the bandage covering my shoulder.“Not up close,” he says. “Zeke and I were hauling wounded Erudite up to thefourth floor all morning.”I peel away the edge of the bandage, revealing the puncture wound—no longerbleeding, thankfully—and the patch of blue dye that doesn’t seem to be fading.Then I reach into my pocket and take out the needle that was buried in my arm.“When they attacked, they weren’t trying to kill us. They were shooting us withthese,” I say.His hand touches the dyed skin around the puncture wound. I didn’t notice itbefore because it was happening right in front of me, but he looks differentthan he used to, during initiation. He’s let his facial hair grow in a little,and his hair is longer than I’ve ever seen it—dense enough to show me that it isbrown, not black.He takes the needle from me and taps the metal disc at the end of it. “This isprobably hollow. It must have contained whatever that blue stuff in your arm is.What happened after you were shot?”“They tossed these gas-spewing cylinders into the room, and everyone wentunconscious. That is, everyone but Uriah and me and the other Divergent.”Tobias doesn’t seem surprised. I narrow my eyes.“Did you know that Uriah was Divergent?”He shrugs. “Of course. I ran his simulations, too.”“And you never told me?”“Privileged information,” he says. “Dangerous information.”I feel a flare of anger—how many things is he going to keep from me?—and try tostifle it. Of course he couldn’t tell me Uriah was Divergent. He was justrespecting Uriah’s privacy. It makes sense.I clear my throat. “You saved our lives, you know,” I say. “Eric was trying tohunt us down.”“I think we’re past keeping track of who has saved whose life.” He looks at mefor a few long seconds.“Anyway,” I say to break the silence. “After we figured out that everyone wasasleep, Uriah ran upstairs to warn the people who were up there, and I went tothe second floor to figure out what was going on. Eric had all the Divergent bythe elevators, and he was trying to figure out which of us he was going to takeback with him. He said he was allowed to take two. I don’t know why he was goingto take any.”“Odd,” he says.“Any ideas?”“My guess is that the needle injected you with a transmitter,” he says, “and thegas was an aerosol version of the liquid that alters the brain. But why …” Acrease appears between his eyebrows. “Oh. She put everyone to sleep to find outwho the Divergent were.”“You think that’s the only reason for shooting us with transmitters?”He shakes his head, and his eyes lock on mine. Their blue is so dark andfamiliar that I feel like it could swallow me whole. For a moment I wish itwould, so that I could escape this place and all that has happened.“I think you’ve already figured it out,” he says, “but you want me to contradictyou. And I’m not going to.”“They’ve developed a long-lasting transmitter,” I say.He nods.“So now we’re all wired for multiple simulations,” I add. “As many as Jeaninewants, maybe.”He nods again.My next breath shakes on the way out of my mouth. “This is really bad, Tobias.” In the hallway outside the interrogation room, he stops, leaning against thewall.“So you attacked Eric,” he says. “Was that during the invasion? Or when you wereby the elevators?”“By the elevators,” I say.“One thing I don’t understand,” he says. “You were downstairs. You could havejust run away. But instead, you decided to dive into a crowd of armed Dauntlessall by yourself. And I’m willing to bet you weren’t carrying a gun.”I press my lips together.“Is that true?” he demands.“What makes you think I didn’t have a gun?” I scowl.“You haven’t been able to touch a gun since the attack,” he says. “I understandwhy, with the whole Will thing, but—”“That has nothing to do with it.”“No?” He lifts his eyebrows.“I did what I had to do.”“Yeah. But now you should be done,” he says, pulling away from the wall to faceme. Candor hallways are wide, wide enough for all the space I want to keepbetween us. “You should have stayed with the Amity. You should have stayed faraway from all of this.”“No, I shouldn’t have,” I say. “You think you know what’s best for me? You haveno idea. I was going crazy with the Amity. Here I finally feel … sane again.”“Which is odd, considering you are acting like a psychopath,” he says. “It’s notbrave, choosing the position you were in yesterday. It’s beyond stupid—it’ssuicidal. Don’t you have any regard for your own life?”“Of course I do!” I retort. “I was trying to do something useful!”For a few seconds he just stares at me.“You’re more than Dauntless,” he says in a low voice. “But if you want to bejust like them, hurling yourself into ridiculous situations for no reason andretaliating against your enemies without any regard for what’s ethical, go rightahead. I thought you were better than that, but maybe I was wrong!”I clench my hands, my jaw.“You shouldn’t insult the Dauntless,” I say. “They took you in when you hadnowhere else to go. Trusted you with a good job. Gave you all your friends.”I lean against the wall, my eyes on the floor. The tiles in the Merciless Martare always black and white, and here they are in a checkered pattern. If Iunfocus my eyes, I see exactly what the Candor don’t believe in—gray. MaybeTobias and I don’t believe in it either. Not really.I weigh too much, more than my frame can support, so much I should fall rightthrough the floor.“Tris.”I keep staring.“Tris.”I finally look at him.“I just don’t want to lose you.”We stand there for a few minutes. I don’t say what I’m thinking, which is thathe might be right. There is a part of me that wants to be lost, that strugglesto join my parents and Will so that I don’t have to ache for them anymore. Apart of me that wants to see whatever comes next. “So you’re her brother?” says Lynn. “I guess we know who got the good genes.”I laugh at the expression on Caleb’s face, his mouth drawn into a slight puckerand his eyes wide.“When do you have to get back?” I say, nudging him with my elbow.I bite into the sandwich Caleb got me from the cafeteria line. I am nervous tohave him here, mixing the sad remains of my family life with the sad remains ofmy Dauntless life. What will he think of my friends, my faction? What will myfaction think of him?“Soon,” he says. “I don’t want anyone to worry.”“I didn’t realize Susan had changed her name to ‘Anyone,’” I say, raising aneyebrow.“Ha-ha,” he says, making a face at me.Teasing between siblings should feel familiar, but it doesn’t for us. Abnegationdiscouraged anything that might make someone feel uncomfortable, and teasing wasincluded.I can feel how cautious we are with each other, now that we’re discovering adifferent way to relate in light of our new factions and our parents’ deaths.Every time I look at him, I realize that he’s the only family I have left and Ifeel desperate, desperate to keep him around, desperate to narrow the gapbetween us.“Is Susan another Erudite defector?” says Lynn, stabbing a string bean with herfork. Uriah and Tobias are still in the lunch line, waiting behind two dozenCandor who are too busy bickering to get their food.“No, she was our neighbor when we were kids. She’s Abnegation,” I say.“And you’re involved with her?” she asks Caleb. “Don’t you think that’s kind ofa stupid move? I mean, when all this is over, you’ll be in different factions,living in completely different places….”“Lynn,” Marlene says, touching her shoulder, “shut up, will you?”Across the room, something blue catches my attention. Cara just walked in. I putdown my sandwich, my appetite gone, and look up at her with my head lowered. Shewalks to the far corner of the cafeteria, where a few tables of Erudite refugeessit. Most of them have abandoned their blue clothes in favor of black-and-whiteones, but they still wear their glasses. I try to focus on Caleb instead—butCaleb is watching the Erudite, too.“I can’t go back to Erudite any more than they can,” says Caleb. “When this isover, I won’t have a faction.”For the first time I notice how sad he looks when he talks about the Erudite. Ididn’t realize how difficult the decision to leave them must have been for him.“You could go sit with them,” I say, nodding toward the Erudite refugees.“I don’t know them.” He shrugs. “I was only there for a month, remember?”Uriah drops his tray on the table, scowling. “I overheard someone talking aboutEric’s interrogation in the lunch line. Apparently he knew almost nothing aboutJeanine’s plan.”“What?” Lynn slaps her fork on the table. “How is that even possible?”Uriah shrugs, and sits.“I’m not surprised,” Caleb says.Everyone stares at him.“What?” He flushes. “It would be stupid to confide your entire plan to oneperson. It’s infinitely smarter to give little pieces of it to each personworking with you. That way, if someone betrays you, the loss isn’t too great.”“Oh,” says Uriah.Lynn picks up her fork and starts eating again.“I heard the Candor made ice cream,” says Marlene, twisting her head around tosee the lunch line. “You know, as a kind of ‘it sucks we got attacked, but atleast there are desserts’ thing.”“I feel better already,” says Lynn dryly.“It probably won’t be as good as Dauntless cake,” says Marlene mournfully. Shesighs, and a strand of mousy brown hair falls in her eyes.“We had good cake,” I tell Caleb.“We had fizzy drinks,” he says.“Ah, but did you have a ledge overlooking an underground river?” says Marlene,waggling her eyebrows. “Or a room where you faced all your nightmares at once?”“No,” says Caleb, “and to be honest, I’m kind of okay with that.”“Si-ssy,” sings Marlene.“All your nightmares?” says Caleb, his eyes lighting up. “How does that work? Imean, are the nightmares produced by the computer or by your brain?”“Oh God.” Lynn drops her head into her hands. “Here we go.”Marlene launches into a description of the simulations, and I let her voice, andCaleb’s voice, wash over me as I finish my sandwich. Then, despite the clatterof forks and the roar of hundreds of conversations all around me, I rest my headon the table and fall asleep."},{"pageContent":"[images/00005.jpg]“QUIET DOWN, EVERYONE!”Jack Kang lifts his hands, and the crowd goes silent. That is a talent.I stand among the crowd of Dauntless who got here late, when there were no seatsleft. A flash of light catches my eye—lightning. It’s not the best time to bemeeting in a room with holes in the walls instead of windows, but this is thebiggest room they have.“I know many of you are confused and shaken by what happened yesterday,” Jacksays. “I have heard many reports from a variety of perspectives, and have gottena sense for what is straightforward and what requires more investigation.”I tuck my wet hair behind my ears. I woke up ten minutes before the meeting wassupposed to start and ran to the showers. Though I’m still exhausted, I feelmore alert now.“What seems to me to require more investigation,” Jack says, “is the Divergent.”He looks tired—he has dark circles under his eyes, and his short hair sticks outat random, like he’s been pulling it all night. Despite the stifling heat of theroom, he wears a long-sleeved shirt that buttons at the wrists—he must have beendistracted when he dressed this morning.“If you are one of the Divergent, please step forward so that we can hear fromyou.”I look sideways at Uriah. This feels dangerous. My Divergence is something I amsupposed to hide. Admitting it is supposed to mean death. But there is no sensein hiding it now—they already know about me.Tobias is the first to move. He starts into the crowd, at first turning his bodyto wedge his way between people, and then, when they step back for him, movingstraight toward Jack Kang with his shoulders back.I move, too, muttering “Excuse me” to the people in front of me. They draw backlike I just threatened to spit poison at them. A few others step forward, inCandor black and white, but not many. One of them is the girl I helped.Despite the notoriety Tobias now has among the Dauntless, and my new title asThat Girl Who Stabbed Eric, we are not the real focus of everyone’s attention.Marcus is.“You, Marcus?” says Jack when Marcus reaches the middle of the room and standson top of the lower scale in the floor.“Yes,” Marcus says. “I understand that you are concerned—that you all areconcerned. You had never heard of the Divergent a week ago, and now all that youknow is that they are immune to something to which you are susceptible, and thatis a frightening thing. But I can assure you that there is nothing to be afraidof, as far as we are concerned.”As he speaks, his head tilts and his eyebrows lift in sympathy, and I understandat once why some people like him. He makes you feel that if you just placedeverything in his hands, he would take care of it.“It seems clear to me,” says Jack, “that we were attacked so that the Eruditecould find the Divergent. Do you know why that is?”“No, I do not,” says Marcus. “Perhaps their intention was merely to identify us.It seems like useful information to have, if they intend to use theirsimulations again.”“That was not their intention.” The words are past my lips before I decide tospeak them. My voice sounds high and weak compared to Marcus’s and Jack’s, butit’s too late to stop. “They wanted to kill us. They’ve been killing us sincebefore any of this happened.”Jack’s eyebrows draw together. I hear hundreds of tiny sounds, raindrops hittingthe roof. The room darkens, as if under the gloom of what I just said.“That sounds very much like a conspiracy theory,” Jack says. “What reason wouldthe Erudite have to kill you?”My mother said people feared the Divergent because we couldn’t be controlled.That may be true, but fear of the uncontrollable is not a concrete enough reasonto give Jack Kang for the Erudite wanting us dead. My heart races as I realizethat I can’t answer his question.“I …” I start. Tobias interrupts me.“Obviously we don’t know,” he says, “but there are nearly a dozen mysteriousdeaths recorded among the Dauntless from the past six years, and there is acorrelation between those people and irregular aptitude test results orinitiation simulation results.”Lightning strikes, making the room glow. Jack shakes his head. “While that isintriguing, correlation does not constitute evidence.”“A Dauntless leader shot a Candor child in the head,” I snap. “Did you get areport of that? Did it seem ‘worthy of investigation’?”“In fact I did,” he says. “And shooting a child in cold blood is a terriblecrime that cannot go unpunished. Fortunately, we have the perpetrator in custodyand will be able to put him on trial. However, we must keep in mind that theDauntless soldiers did not give any evidence of wanting to harm the majority ofus, or they would have killed us while we were unconscious.”I hear irritated murmurs all around me.“Their peaceful invasion suggests to me that it may be possible to negotiate apeace treaty with the Erudite and the other Dauntless,” he continues. “So I willarrange a meeting with Jeanine Matthews to discuss that possibility as soon aspossible.”“Their invasion wasn’t peaceful,” I say. I can see the corner of Tobias’s mouthfrom where I stand, and he is smiling. I take a deep breath and begin again.“Just because they didn’t shoot you all in the head doesn’t mean theirintentions were somehow honorable. Why do you think they came here? Just to runthrough your hallways, knock you unconscious, and leave?”“I assume they came here for people like you,” says Jack. “And while I amconcerned for your safety, I don’t think we can attack them just because theywanted to kill a fraction of our population.”“Killing you is not the worst thing they can do to you,” I say. “Controlling youis.”Jack’s lips curl with amusement. Amusement. “Oh? And how will they manage that?”“They shot you with needles,” Tobias says. “Needles full of simulationtransmitters. Simulations control you. That’s how.”“We know how simulations work,” says Jack. “The transmitter is not a permanentimplant. If they intended to control us, they would have done it right away.”“But—” I begin.He interrupts me. “I know you have been under a lot of stress, Tris,” he saysquietly, “and that you have done a great service to your faction and toAbnegation. But I think your traumatic experience may have compromised yourability to be completely objective. I can’t launch an attack based on a littlegirl’s speculations.”I stand statue-still, unable to believe that he could be so stupid. My faceburning. Little girl, he called me. A little girl who is stressed out to thepoint of paranoia. That is not me, but now, it’s who the Candor think I am.“You don’t make our decisions for us, Kang,” says Tobias.All around me, the Dauntless shout their assent. Someone else yells, “You arenot the leader of our faction!”Jack waits for their shouts to die down and then says, “That is true. If youwant to, you can feel free to storm the Erudite compound by yourselves. But youwill do so without our support, and may I remind you, you are greatlyoutnumbered and unprepared.”He’s right. We can’t attack Dauntless traitors and Erudite without Candor’snumbers. It would be a bloodbath if we tried. Jack Kang has all the power. Andnow we all know it.“I thought so,” he says smugly. “Very well. I will contact Jeanine Matthews, andsee if we can negotiate a peace. Any objections?”We can’t attack without Candor, I think, unless we have the factionless."},{"pageContent":"[images/00015.jpg]THAT AFTERNOON I join a group of Candor and Dauntless cleaning up the brokenwindows in the lobby. I focus on the path of the broom, keeping my eyes on thedust that collects between glass fragments. My muscles remember the movementbefore the rest of me does, but when I look down, instead of dark marble I seeplain white tile and the bottom of a light gray wall; I see strands of blondhair that my mother trimmed, and the mirror safely tucked behind its wall panel.My body goes weak, and I lean into the broom handle for support.A hand touches my shoulder, and I twitch away from it. But it’s just a Candorgirl—a child. She looks up at me, wide-eyed.“Are you all right?” she says, her voice high and indistinct.“I’m fine,” I say. Too sharply. I hurry to amend it. “Just tired. Thank you.”“I think you’re lying,” she says.I notice a bandage peeking out from the end of her sleeve, probably covering theneedle puncture. The idea of this little girl under a simulation nauseates me. Ican’t even look at her. I turn away.And I see them: outside, a traitor Dauntless man, propping up a woman with ableeding leg. I see the gray streaks in the woman’s hair and the end of theman’s hooked nose and the blue armband of a Dauntless traitor just beneath theirshoulders, and recognize them both. Tori and Zeke.Tori is trying to walk, but one of her legs drags behind her, useless. A wet,dark patch covers most of her thigh.The Candor stop sweeping and stare at them. The Dauntless guards standing nearthe elevators rush toward the entrance with their guns lifted. My fellowsweepers back up to get out of the way, but I stay where I am, heat rushingthrough me as Zeke and Tori approach.“Are they even armed?” someone says.Tori and Zeke reach what used to be the doors, and he puts up one of his handswhen he sees the row of Dauntless with guns. The other he keeps wrapped aroundTori’s waist.“She needs medical attention,” says Zeke. “Right now.”“Why should we give a traitor medical attention?” a Dauntless man with wispyblond hair and a double-pierced lip asks over his gun. A patch of blue dye markshis forearm.Tori moans, and I slip between two Dauntless to reach for her. She puts herhand, which is sticky with blood, in mine. Zeke lowers her to the ground with agrunt.“Tris,” she says, sounding dazed.“Better step back, girl,” the blond Dauntless man says.“No,” I say. “Put your gun down.”“Told you the Divergent were crazy,” one of the other armed Dauntless mutters tothe woman next to him.“I don’t care if you bring her upstairs and tie her to a bed to keep her fromgoing on a shooting spree!” says Zeke, scowling. “Don’t let her bleed to deathin the lobby of Candor headquarters!”Finally, a few Dauntless come forward and lift Tori up.“Where should we … take her?” one of them asks.“Find Helena,” Zeke says. “Dauntless nurse.”The men nod and carry her toward the elevators. Zeke and I meet eyes.“What happened?” I ask him.“The traitor Dauntless found out we were collecting information from them,” hesays. “Tori tried to get away, but they shot her as she was running. I helpedher get here.”“That’s a nice story,” says the blond Dauntless man. “Want to tell it againunder truth serum?”Zeke shrugs. “All right.” He puts his wrists together in front of himdramatically. “Haul me away, if you’re so desperate to.”Then his eyes focus on something over my shoulder, and he starts walking. I turnto see Uriah jogging from the elevator bank. He is grinning.“Heard a rumor you were a dirty traitor,” Uriah says.“Yeah, whatever,” says Zeke.They collide in an embrace that looks almost painful to me, slapping eachother’s backs and laughing with their fists clasped between them. “I can’t believe you didn’t tell us,” says Lynn, shaking her head. She sitsacross from me at the table, her arms crossed and one of her legs propped up.“Oh, don’t get all huffy about it,” says Zeke. “I wasn’t even supposed to tellShauna and Uriah. And it sort of defeats the purpose of being a spy if you telleveryone that’s what you are.”We sit in a room in Candor headquarters called the Gathering Place, which theDauntless have taken to saying in a mocking way whenever they can. It is largeand open, with black-and-white cloth draped on every wall, and a circle ofpodiums in the center of the room. Large round tables surround the podiums. Lynntold me they host monthly debates here, for entertainment, and also holdreligious services here once a week. But even when no events are scheduled, theroom is usually full.Zeke was cleared by the Candor an hour ago, in a short interrogation on theeighteenth floor. It was not as somber an occasion as Tobias’s and myinterrogation, partly because there was no suspicious video footage implicatingZeke, and partly because Zeke is funny even when under truth serum. Maybeespecially so. In any case, we came to the Gathering Place “for a ‘Hey, you’renot a dirty traitor!’ celebration,” as Uriah put it.“Yeah, but we’ve been insulting you since the simulation attack,” Lynn says.“And now I feel like a jerk about it.”Zeke puts his arm around Shauna. “You are a jerk, Lynn. It’s part of yourcharm.”Lynn launches a plastic cup at him, which he deflects. Water sprays over thetable, hitting him in the eye.“Anyway, as I was saying,” says Zeke, rubbing his eye, “I was mostly working ongetting Erudite defectors out safely. That’s why there’s a big group of themhere, and a small group at Amity headquarters. But Tori … I have no idea whatshe was doing. She kept sneaking away for hours at a time, and whenever she wasaround, it was like she was about to explode. It’s no wonder she gave us away.”“How’d you get the job?” says Lynn. “You’re not that special.”“It was more because of where I was after the simulation attack. Smack-dab in apack of Dauntless traitors. I decided to go with it,” he says. “Not sure aboutTori, though.”“She transferred from Erudite,” I say.What I don’t say, because I’m sure she wouldn’t want everyone to know, is thatTori probably seemed explosive in Erudite headquarters because they murdered herbrother for being Divergent.She told me once that she was waiting for an opportunity to get revenge.“Oh,” says Zeke. “How do you know that?”“Well, all the faction transfers have a secret club,” I say, leaning back in mychair. “We meet every third Thursday.”Zeke snorts.“Where’s Four?” says Uriah, checking his watch. “Should we start without him?”“We can’t,” says Zeke. “He’s getting The Info.”Uriah nods like that means something. Then he pauses and says, “What info,again?”“The info about Kang’s little peacemaking meeting with Jeanine,” says Zeke.“Obviously.”Across the room, I see Christina sitting at a table with her sister. They areboth reading something.My entire body tenses. Cara, Will’s older sister, is walking across the roomtoward Christina’s table. I duck my head.“What?” Uriah says, looking over his shoulder. I want to punch him.“Stop it!” I say. “Could you be any more obvious?” I lean forward, folding myarms on the table. “Will’s sister is over there.”“Yeah, I talked to her about getting out of Erudite once, while I was there,”says Zeke. “Said she saw an Abnegation woman get killed while she was on amission for Jeanine and couldn’t stomach it anymore.”“Are we sure she’s not just an Erudite spy?” Lynn says.“Lynn, she saved half our faction from this stuff,” says Marlene, tapping thebandage on her arm from where the Dauntless traitors shot her. “Well, half ofhalf of our faction.”“In some circles they call that a quarter, Mar,” Lynn says.“Anyway, who cares if she is a traitor?” Zeke says. “We’re not planning anythingthat she can inform them about. And we certainly wouldn’t include her if wewere.”“There is plenty of information for her to gather here,” Lynn says. “How many ofus there are, for example, or how many of us aren’t wired for simulations.”“You didn’t see her when she was telling me why she left,” says Zeke. “I believeher.”Cara and Christina have gotten up, and are walking out of the room.“I’ll be right back,” I say. “I have to go to the bathroom.”I wait until Cara and Christina have gone through the doors, then half walk,half jog in that direction. I open one of the doors slowly, so it doesn’t makeany noise, and then close it slowly behind me. I am in a dim hallway that smellslike garbage—this must be where the Candor trash chute is.I hear two female voices around the corner and creep toward the end of thehallway to hear better.“… just can’t handle her being here,” one of them sobs. Christina. “I can’t stoppicturing it … what she did…. I don’t understand how she could have done that!”Christina’s sobs make me feel like I am about to crack open.Cara takes her time responding.“Well, I do,” she says.“What?” Christina says with a hiccup.“You have to understand; we’re trained to see things as logically as possible,”says Cara. “So don’t think that I’m callous. But that girl was probably scaredout of her mind, certainly not capable of assessing situations cleverly at thetime, if she was ever able to do so.”My eyes fly open. What a—I run through a short list of insults in my mind beforelistening to her continue.“And the simulation made her incapable of reasoning with him, so when hethreatened her life, she reacted as she had been trained by the Dauntless toreact: Shoot to kill.”“So what are you saying?” says Christina bitterly. “We should just forget aboutit, because it makes perfect sense?”“Of course not,” says Cara. Her voice wobbles, just a little, and she repeatsherself, quietly this time. “Of course not.”She clears her throat. “It’s just that you have to be around her, and I want tomake it easier for you. You don’t have to forgive her. Actually, I’m not surewhy you were friends with her in the first place; she always seemed a biterratic to me.”I tense up as I wait for Christina to agree with her, but to my surprise—andrelief—she doesn’t.Cara continues. “Anyway. You don’t have to forgive her, but you should try tounderstand that what she did was not out of malice; it was out of panic. Thatway, you can look at her without wanting to punch her in her exceptionally longnose.”My hand moves automatically to my nose. Christina laughs a little, which feelslike a hard poke to the stomach. I back up through the door to the GatheringPlace.Even though Cara was rude—and the nose comment was a low blow—I am grateful forwhat she said. Tobias emerges from a door hidden behind a length of white cloth. He flicks thecloth out of the way irritably before coming toward us and sitting beside me atthe table in the Gathering Place.“Kang is going to meet with a representative of Jeanine Matthews at seven in themorning,” he says.“A representative?” Zeke says. “She’s not going herself?”“Yeah, and stand out in the open where a bunch of angry people with guns cantake aim?” Uriah smirks a little. “I’d like to see her try. No, really, Iwould.”“Is Kang the Brilliant taking a Dauntless escort, at least?” Lynn says.“Yes,” Tobias says. “Some of the older members volunteered. Bud said he wouldkeep his ears open and report back.”I frown at him. How does he know all this information? And why, after two yearsof avoiding becoming a Dauntless leader at all costs, is he suddenly acting likeone?“So I guess the real question is,” says Zeke, folding his hands on the table,“if you were Erudite, what would you say at this meeting?”They all look at me. Expectantly.“What?” I say.“You’re Divergent,” Zeke replies.“So is Tobias.”“Yeah, but he doesn’t have aptitude for Erudite.”“And how do you know I do?”Zeke lifts his shoulder. “Seems likely. Doesn’t it seem likely?”Uriah and Lynn nod. Tobias’s mouth twitches, as if in a smile, but if that’swhat it was, he suppresses it. I feel like a stone just dropped into my stomach.“You all have functional brains, last time I checked,” I say. “You can thinklike the Erudite, too.”“But we don’t have special Divergent brains!” says Marlene. She touches herfingertips to my scalp and squeezes lightly. “Come on, do your magic.”“There’s no such thing as Divergent magic, Mar,” says Lynn.“And if there is, we shouldn’t be consulting it,” says Shauna. It’s the firstthing she’s said since we sat down. She doesn’t even look at me when she saysit; she just scowls at her younger sister.“Shauna—” Zeke starts.“Don’t ‘Shauna’ me!” she says, focusing her scowl on him instead. “Don’t youthink someone with the aptitude for multiple factions might have a loyaltyproblem? If she’s got aptitude for Erudite, how can we be sure she’s not workingfor Erudite?”“Don’t be ridiculous,” says Tobias, his voice low.“I am not being ridiculous.” She smacks the table. “I know I belong in Dauntlessbecause everything I did in that aptitude test told me so. I’m loyal to myfaction for that reason—because there’s nowhere else I could possibly be. Buther? And you?” She shakes her head. “I have no idea who you’re loyal to. And I’mnot going to pretend like everything’s okay.”She gets up, and when Zeke reaches for her, she throws his hand aside, marchingtoward one of the doors. I watch her until the door closes behind her and theblack fabric that hangs in front of it settles.I feel wound up, like I might scream, only Shauna isn’t here for me to screamat.“It’s not magic,” I say hotly. “You just have to ask yourself what the mostlogical response to a particular situation is.”I am greeted with blank stares.“Seriously,” I say. “If I were in this situation, staring at a group ofDauntless guards and Jack Kang, I probably wouldn’t resort to violence, right?”“Well, you might, if you had your own Dauntless guards. And then all it takes isone shot—bam, he’s dead, and Erudite’s better off,” says Zeke.“Whoever they send to talk to Jack Kang isn’t going to be some random Eruditekid; it’s going to be someone important,” I say. “It would be a stupid move tofire on Jack Kang and risk losing whoever they send as Jeanine’srepresentative.”“See? This is why we need you to analyze the situation,” Zeke says. “If it wasme, I would kill him; it would be worth the risk.”I pinch the bridge of my nose. I already have a headache. “Fine.”I try to put myself in Jeanine Matthews’s place. I already know she won’tnegotiate with Jack Kang. Why would she need to? He has nothing to offer her.She will use the situation to her advantage.“I think,” I say, “that Jeanine Matthews will manipulate him. And that he willdo anything to protect his faction, even if it means sacrificing the Divergent.”I pause for a moment, remembering how he held his faction’s influence over ourheads at the meeting. “Or sacrificing the Dauntless. So we need to hear whatthey say in that meeting.”Uriah and Zeke exchange a look. Lynn smiles, but it isn’t her usual smile. Itdoesn’t spread to her eyes, which look more like gold than ever, with thatcoldness in them.“So let’s listen in,” she says."},{"pageContent":"[images/00010.jpg]I CHECK MY watch. It is seven o’clock in the evening. Just twelve hours until wecan hear what Jeanine has to say to Jack Kang. I have checked my watch at leasta dozen times in the past hour, as if that will make the time go faster. I amitching to do something—anything except sit in the cafeteria with Lynn, Tobias,and Lauren, picking at my dinner and sneaking looks at Christina, who sits withher Candor family at one of the other tables.“I wonder if we’ll be able to return to the old way after all this is over,”says Lauren. She and Tobias have been talking about Dauntless initiate trainingmethods for at least five minutes already. It’s probably the only thing theyhave in common.“If there’s a faction left after all this is over,” Lynn says, piling her mashedpotatoes onto a roll.“Don’t tell me you’re going to eat a mashed-potato sandwich,” I say to her.“So what if I am?”A group of Dauntless walk between our table and the one next to us. They areolder than Tobias, but not by much. One of the girls has five different colorsin her hair, and her arms are covered with tattoos so that I can’t see even aninch of bare skin. One of the boys leans close to Tobias, whose back is to them,and whispers, “Coward,” as he passes.A few of the others do the same thing, hissing “coward” into Tobias’s ears andthen continuing on their way. He pauses with his knife against a piece of bread,a glob of butter waiting to be spread, and stares at the table.I wait, tense, for him to explode.“What idiots,” says Lauren. “And the Candor, for making you spill your lifestory for everyone to see … they’re idiots too.”Tobias doesn’t answer. He puts down his knife and the piece of bread, and pushesback from the table. His eyes lift and focus on something across the room.“This needs to stop,” he says distantly, and starts toward whatever it is he’slooking at before I figure out what it is. This can’t be good.He slips between the tables and the people like he’s more liquid than solid, andI stumble after him, muttering apologies as I push people aside.And then I see exactly who Tobias is headed toward. Marcus. He is sitting with afew of the older Candor.Tobias reaches him and grabs him by the back of the neck, wrestling him from hisseat. Marcus opens his mouth to say something, and that is a mistake, becauseTobias punches him hard in the teeth. Someone shouts, but no one rushes toMarcus’s aid. We are in a room full of Dauntless, after all.Tobias shoves Marcus toward the middle of the room, where there is a spacebetween the tables to reveal the symbol of Candor. Marcus stumbles over one ofthe scales, his hands covering his face so I can’t see the damage Tobias did.Tobias shoves Marcus to the ground and presses the heel of his shoe to hisfather’s throat. Marcus smacks at Tobias’s leg, blood streaming past his lips,but even if he was at his strongest, he still wouldn’t be as strong as his son.Tobias undoes his belt buckle and slides it from its loops.He lifts his foot from Marcus’s throat and draws the belt back.“This is for your own good,” he says.That, I remember, is what Marcus, and his many manifestations, always says toTobias in his fear landscape.Then the belt flies through the air and hits Marcus in the arm. Marcus’s face isbright red, and he covers his head as the next blow falls, this one hitting hisback. All around me is laughter, coming from the Dauntless tables, but I am notlaughing, I cannot possibly laugh at this.Finally I come to my senses. I run forward and grab Tobias’s shoulder.“Stop!” I say. “Tobias, stop right now!”I expect to see a wild look in his eyes, but when he looks at me, I do not. Hisface is not flushed and his breaths are steady. This was not an act performed inthe heat of passion.It was a calculated act.He drops the belt and reaches into his pocket. From it he takes a silver chainwith a ring dangling from it. Marcus is on his side, gasping. Tobias drops thering onto the ground next to his father’s face. It is made of tarnished, dullmetal, an Abnegation wedding band.“My mother,” says Tobias, “says hello.”Tobias walks away, and it takes a few seconds for me to breathe again. When Ido, I leave Marcus cringing on the floor and run after him. It takes me until Ireach the hallway to catch up to him.“What was that?” I demand.Tobias presses the DOWN button for the elevator and doesn’t look at me.“It was necessary,” he says.“Necessary for what?” I say.“What, you’re feeling sorry for him now?” Tobias says, turning toward me with ascowl. “Do you know how many times he did that to me? How do you think I learnedthe moves?”I feel brittle, like I might break. It did seem rehearsed, like Tobias had goneover the steps in his mind, recited the words in front of a mirror. He knew itby heart; he was just playing the other part this time.“No,” I say quietly. “No, I don’t feel sorry for him, not at all.”“Then what, Tris?” His voice is rough; it could be the thing that breaks me.“You haven’t cared about what I do or say for the past week; what’s so differentabout this?”I am almost afraid of him. I don’t know what to say or do around the erraticpart of him, and it is here, bubbling just beneath the surface of what he does,just like the cruel part of me. We both have war inside of us. Sometimes itkeeps us alive. Sometimes it threatens to destroy us.“Nothing,” I say.The elevator beeps as it arrives. He gets on, and presses the CLOSE button sothe doors shut between us. I stare at the brushed metal and try to think throughthe last ten minutes.“This needs to stop,” he said. “This” was the ridicule, which was a result ofthe interrogation, where he admitted that he joined Dauntless to escape hisfather. And then he beat up Marcus—publicly, where all the Dauntless could seeit.Why? To salvage his pride? It can’t be. It was far too intentional for that. On my way back to the cafeteria, I see a Candor man walk Marcus toward thebathroom. He walks slowly, but he isn’t hunched over, which makes me thinkTobias didn’t do him any serious damage. I watch the door close behind him.I had all but forgotten about what I heard in the Amity compound, about theinformation my father risked his life for. Supposedly, I remind myself. It maynot be wise to trust Marcus. And I promised myself I wouldn’t ask him about thisagain.I dawdle outside the bathroom until the Candor man walks out, and then walk inbefore the door has a chance to shut properly. Marcus is sitting on the floor bythe sink with a wad of paper towel pressed to his mouth. He doesn’t look happyto see me.“What, here to gloat?” he says. “Get out.”“No,” I say.Why am I here, exactly?He looks at me expectantly. “Well?”“I thought you could use a reminder,” I say. “Whatever it is you want to getfrom Jeanine, you won’t be able to do it alone, and you won’t be able to do itwith only the Abnegation to help you.”“I thought we went over this.” His voice is muffled by the paper towels. “Theidea that you could help—”“I don’t know where you get this delusion that I’m useless, but that’s what itis,” I snap. “And I’m not interested in hearing about it. All I want to say isthat when you stop being delusional and start feeling desperate because you’retoo inept to figure this out on your own, you know who to come to.”I leave the bathroom just as the Candor man comes back with an ice pack."},{"pageContent":"[images/00019.jpg]I STAND BEFORE the sinks in the women’s bathroom on the newly claimed Dauntlessfloor, a gun resting on my palm. Lynn put it there a few minutes ago; she seemedconfused that I did not wrap my hand around it and put it somewhere, in aholster or under the waistband of my jeans. I just let it stay there, and walkedto the bathroom before I started to panic.Don’t be an idiot. I can’t set out to do what I’m doing without a gun. It wouldbe crazy. So I will have to solve this problem I’ve been having in the next fiveminutes.I curl my pinkie around the handle first, then my second finger, then theothers. The weight is familiar. My index finger slips around the trigger. Irelease a breath.I start to lift it, bringing my left hand to meet my right to steady it. I holdthe gun out from my body, my arms straight, just as Four taught me, when thatwas his only name. I used a gun like this to defend my father and brother fromsimulation-bound Dauntless. I used it to stop Eric from shooting Tobias in thehead. It is not inherently evil. It is just a tool.I see a flicker of movement in the mirror, and before I can stop myself, I stareat my reflection. This is how I looked to him, I think. This is how I lookedwhen I shot him.Moaning like a wounded animal, I let the gun fall from my hands and wrap my armsaround my stomach. I want to sob because I know it will make me feel better, butI can’t force the tears to come. I just crouch in the bathroom, staring at thewhite tiles. I can’t do it. I can’t take the gun with me.I shouldn’t even go; I am still going to.“Tris?” Someone knocks. I stand and uncross my arms as the door squeaks open afew inches. Tobias steps into the room.“Zeke and Uriah told me you were going to eavesdrop on Jack,” he says.“Oh.”“Are you?”“Why should I tell you? You don’t tell me about your plans.”His straight eyebrows furrow. “What are you talking about?”“I’m talking about beating Marcus to a pulp in front of all the Dauntless for noapparent reason.” I step toward him. “But there is a reason, isn’t there?Because it’s not like you lost control; it’s not like he did something toprovoke you, so there has to be a reason!”“I needed to prove to the Dauntless that I am not a coward,” he says. “That’sall. That’s all it was.”“Why would you need to …” I start.Why would Tobias need to prove himself to the Dauntless? Only if he wanted themto hold him in high regard. Only if he wants to become a Dauntless leader. Iremember Evelyn’s voice, speaking in the shadows in the factionless safe house:“What I am suggesting is that you become important.”He wants the Dauntless to ally with the factionless, and he knows the only wayhe can make that happen is to do it himself.Why he didn’t feel the need to share this plan with me is another mysteryentirely. Before I can ask, he says, “So are you going to eavesdrop or not?”“What does it matter?”“You’re throwing yourself into danger for no reason again,” he says. “Just likewhen you stormed up to fight the Erudite with only a … a pocket knife to protectyourself.”“There is a reason. A good one. We won’t know what’s going on unless weeavesdrop, and we need to know what’s going on.”He crosses his arms. He is not bulky, the way some Dauntless boys are. And somegirls might focus on the way his ears stick out, or the way his nose hooks atthe end, but to me …I swallow the rest of that thought. He’s here to yell at me. He’s been keepingthings from me. Whatever we are now, I can’t indulge thoughts about howattractive he is. It will just make it harder for me to do what needs to bedone. And right now, that is going to listen to what Jack Kang has to say to theErudite.“You’re not cutting your hair like the Abnegation anymore,” I say. “That becauseyou want to look more Dauntless?”“Don’t change the subject,” he says. “There are four people going to eavesdropalready. You don’t need to be there.”“Why are you so insistent on me staying home?” My voice gets louder. “I am notthe kind of person who just sits back and lets other people take all the risks!”“As long as you are someone who doesn’t seem to value her own life … someone whocan’t even pick up and fire a gun …” He leans toward me. “You should sit backand let other people take the risks.”His quiet voice pulses around me like a second heartbeat. I hear the words“doesn’t seem to value her own life” again and again.“What are you going to do?” I say. “Lock me in the bathroom? Because that’s theonly way you’ll be able to keep me from going.”He touches his forehead and lets his hand drag down the side of his face. I havenever seen his face sag that way before.“I don’t want to stop you. I want you to stop yourself,” he says. “But if you’regoing to be reckless, you can’t prevent me from coming along.” It is still dark, but just barely, when we reach the bridge, which istwo-tiered, with stone pillars at each corner. We descend the stairs next to oneof the stone pillars and creep with silent feet at river level. Large puddles ofstanding water gleam as the light of day hits them. The sun is rising; we haveto get into position.Uriah and Zeke are in the buildings on either side of the bridge so they can geta better view and cover us from a distance. They have better aim than Lynn orShauna, who came because Lynn asked her to, despite her outburst in theGathering Place.Lynn goes first, her back pressed to the stone as she inches along the lower lipof the bridge supports. I follow her, with Shauna and Tobias behind me. Thebridge is supported by four curved metal structures that secure it to the stonewall, and by a maze of narrow girders beneath its lower tier. Lynn wedgesherself under one of the metal structures and climbs quickly, keeping the narrowgirders beneath her as she works her way to the middle of the bridge.I let Shauna go in front of me because I can’t climb as well. My left arm shakesas I try to balance on top of the metal structure. I feel Tobias’s cool hand onmy waist, steadying me.I crouch low to fit in the space between the bottom of the bridge and thegirders beneath me. I don’t make it very far before I have to stop, my feet onone girder and my left arm on another. And I will have to stay that way for along time.Tobias slides along one of the girders and puts his leg under me. It is longenough to stretch beneath me and onto a second girder. I breathe out and smileat him as a kind of thank-you. It’s the first time we have acknowledged eachother since we left the Merciless Mart.He smiles back, but grimly.We bide our time in silence. I breathe through my mouth and try to control theshaking of my arms and legs. Shauna and Lynn seem to communicate withoutspeaking. They make faces at each other that I can’t read, and nod and smile ateach other when they reach an understanding. I have never thought about what itwould be like to have a sister. Would Caleb and I be closer if he were a girl?The city is so quiet in the morning that the footsteps echo as they approach thebridge. The sound comes from behind me, which must mean it’s Jack and hisDauntless escort, not the Erudite, who have arrived. The Dauntless know that weare here, though Jack Kang himself does not. If he stares down for more than afew seconds, he might see us through the metal mesh beneath his feet. I try tobreathe as quietly as possible.Tobias checks his watch, and then holds his arm out to me to show me the time.Seven o’clock exactly.I glance up and peer through the steel web above me. Feet pass over my head. Andthen I hear him.“Hello, Jack,” he says.It’s Max, who appointed Eric to Dauntless leadership at Jeanine’s demand, whoimplemented policies of cruelty and brutality in Dauntless initiation. I havenever spoken to him directly, but the sound of his voice makes me shiver.“Max,” Jack says. “Where’s Jeanine? I thought she would at least have thecourtesy to show up herself.”“Jeanine and I divide our responsibilities according to our strengths,” he says.“That means I make all military decisions. I believe that includes what we aredoing today.”I frown. I haven’t heard Max speak much, but something about the words he’susing, and their rhythm, sounds … off.“Fine,” says Jack. “I came to—”“I should inform you that this will not be a negotiation,” Max says. “In orderto negotiate, you have to be on even footing, and you, Jack, are not.”“What do you mean?”“I mean that you are the only disposable faction. Candor does not provide uswith protection, sustenance, or technological innovation. Therefore you areexpendable to us. And you have not done much to win the favor of your Dauntlessguests,” says Max, “so you are completely vulnerable and completely useless. Irecommend, therefore, that you do exactly as I say.”“You piece of scum,” says Jack through gritted teeth. “How dare—”“Now let’s not get testy,” Max says.I chew on my lip. I should trust my instincts, and my instincts tell me thatsomething is wrong here. No self-respecting Dauntless man would say the word“testy.” Nor would he react so calmly to an insult. He’s speaking like someoneelse. He’s speaking like Jeanine.The back of my neck prickles. It makes perfect sense. Jeanine would not trustanyone, particularly not a volatile Dauntless, to speak on her behalf. The bestsolution to that problem is to give Max an earpiece. And the signal from anearpiece can stretch only a quarter of a mile at most.I catch Tobias’s eye, and slowly move my hand to point at my ear. Then I pointabove me, at my best approximation of where Max stands.Tobias frowns for a moment, then nods, but I’m not sure he understands me.“I have three requirements,” says Max. “First, that you return the Dauntlessleader you currently hold in captivity unharmed. Second, that you allow yourcompound to be searched by our soldiers so that we can extract the Divergent;and third, that you provide us with the names of those who were not injectedwith the simulation serum.”“Why?” Jack says bitterly. “What are you searching for? And why do you needthose names? What do you intend to do with them?”“The purpose of our search would be to locate and remove any of the Divergentfrom the premises. And as for the names, that is none of your concern.”“None of my concern!” I hear footsteps squeak above me and stare up through themesh. From what I can see, Jack has the collar of Max’s shirt wrapped around hisfist.“Release me,” says Max. “Or I will order my guards to fire.”I frown. If Jeanine is speaking through Max, she had to be able to see him inorder to know that he was grabbed. I lean forward to look at the buildings onthe other side of the bridge. On my left, the river bends, and a squat glassbuilding stands at the edge. That must be where she is.I start to climb backward, toward the metal structure that supports the bridge,toward the staircase that will lead me to Wacker Drive. Tobias follows meimmediately, and Shauna taps Lynn on the shoulder. But Lynn is doing somethingelse.I was too busy thinking about Jeanine. I failed to notice that Lynn took out hergun and started to climb toward the edge of the bridge. Shauna’s mouth opens andher eyes go wide as Lynn swings herself forward, grabbing the lip of the bridge,and shoves her arm over it. Her finger squeezes the trigger.Max gasps, his hand clapping over his chest, and stumbles back. When he pullshis hand away, it is dark with blood.I don’t bother to climb anymore. I drop into the mud, closely followed byTobias, Lynn, and Shauna. My legs sink into the mire, and my feet make suckingnoises as I pull them free. My shoes slip off but I keep going until I reach theconcrete. Guns fire and bullets stick in the mud next to me. I throw myselfagainst the wall under the bridge so they can’t aim at me.Tobias presses into the wall behind me, so close to me that his chin floats overmy head and I can feel his chest against my shoulders. Shielding me.I can run back to Candor headquarters, and to temporary safety. Or I can findJeanine in what is probably the most vulnerable state she will ever be in.It’s not even a choice.“Come on!” I say. I sprint up the stairs, the others on my heels. On the lowertier of the bridge, our Dauntless shoot at the Dauntless traitors. Jack is safe,bent over with a Dauntless arm slung across his back. I run faster. I run acrossthe bridge and don’t look behind me. I can already hear Tobias’s footsteps. Heis the only one who can keep up with me.The glass building is in my sights. And then I hear more footsteps, moregunshots. I weave as I run, to make it more difficult for the Dauntless traitorsto hit me.I am close to the glass building. I am yards away. I grit my teeth and pushmyself harder. My legs are numb; I barely feel the ground beneath me. But beforeI reach the doors, I see movement in the alley to my right. I swerve and followit with my feet.Three figures run down the alley. One is blond. One is tall. And one is Peter.I stumble, and almost fall.“Peter!” I shout. He lifts his gun, and behind me, Tobias lifts his own, and westand just yards away from each other, at a standstill. Behind him, the blondwoman—Jeanine, probably—and the tall Dauntless traitor turn the corner. Though Idon’t have a weapon, and I don’t have a plan, I want to run after them, andmaybe I would if Tobias did not clamp his hand over my shoulder and hold me inplace.“You traitor,” I say to Peter. “I knew it. I knew it.”A scream pierces the air. It is anguished and female.“Sounds like your friends need you,” Peter says with the flash of a smile—orbared teeth, I can’t tell. He keeps his gun steady. “So you have a choice. Youcan let us go, and help them, or you can die trying to follow us.”I almost scream. We both know what I’m going to do.“I hope you die,” I say.I back up into Tobias, who backs up with me, until we reach the end of thealley, and then turn and run."},{"pageContent":"[images/00022.jpg]SHAUNA LIES ON the ground, facedown, blood pooling on her shirt. Lynn crouchesat her side. Staring. Doing nothing.“It’s my fault,” Lynn mumbles. “I shouldn’t have shot him. I shouldn’t have …”I stare at the patch of blood. A bullet hit her in the back. I can’t tell ifshe’s breathing or not. Tobias places two fingers on the side of her neck, andnods.“We’ve got to get out of here,” he says. “Lynn. Look at me. I’m going to carryher, and it’s going to hurt her a lot, but it’s our only option.”Lynn nods. Tobias crouches next to Shauna and puts his hands under her arms. Helifts her, and she moans. I rush forward to help him pull her limp body over hisshoulder. My throat tightens, and I cough to relieve the pressure.Tobias stands with a grunt of effort, and together we walk toward the MercilessMart—Lynn in front, with her gun, and me in the back. I walk backward to watchbehind us, but I don’t see anyone. I think the Dauntless traitors retreated. ButI have to make sure.“Hey!” someone shouts. It’s Uriah, jogging toward us. “Zeke had to help them getJack … oh no.” He stops. “Oh no. Shauna?”“Now’s not the time,” says Tobias sharply. “Run back to the Merciless Mart andget a doctor.”But Uriah just stares.“Uriah! Go, now!” The shout rings with nothing on the street to soften the soundof it. Uriah finally turns and sprints in the direction of the Merciless Mart.It’s only half a mile back, but with Tobias’s grunts and Lynn’s uneven breathingand the knowledge that Shauna is bleeding to death, it feels endless. I watchthe muscles in Tobias’s back expanding and contracting with each labored breath,and I don’t hear our footsteps; I hear only my heartbeat. When we finally reachthe doors, I feel like I might throw up, or faint, or scream at the top of mylungs.Uriah, an Erudite man with a comb-over, and Cara meet us just inside theentrance. They set up a sheet for Shauna to lie on. Tobias lowers her onto it,and the doctor gets to work immediately, cutting the shirt away from Shauna’sback. I turn away. I don’t want to see the bullet wound.Tobias stands in front of me, his face red with exertion. I want him to fold meinto his arms again, like he did after the last attack, but he doesn’t, and Iknow better than to initiate it.“I’m not going to pretend to know what’s going on with you,” he says. “But ifyou senselessly risk your life again—”“I am not senselessly risking my life. I am trying to make sacrifices, like myparents would have, like—”“You are not your parents. You are a sixteen-year-old girl—”I grit my teeth. “How dare you—”“—who doesn’t understand that the value of a sacrifice lies in its necessity,not in throwing your life away! And if you do that again, you and I are done.”I wasn’t expecting him to say that.“You’re giving me an ultimatum?” I try to keep my voice down so the others can’thear.He shakes his head. “No, I’m telling you a fact.” His lips are just a line. “Ifyou throw yourself into danger for no reason again, you will have become nothingmore than a Dauntless adrenaline junkie looking for a hit, and I’m not going tohelp you do it.” He spits the words out bitterly. “I love Tris the Divergent,who makes decisions apart from faction loyalty, who isn’t some factionarchetype. But the Tris who’s trying as hard as she can to destroy herself … Ican’t love her.”I want to scream. But not because I’m angry, because I’m afraid he’s right. Myhands shake and I grab the hem of my shirt to steady them.He touches his forehead to mine and closes his eyes. “I believe you’re still inthere,” he says against my mouth. “Come back.”He kisses me lightly, and I am too shocked to stop him.He walks back to Shauna’s side, and I stand over one of the Candor scales in thelobby, at a loss. “It’s been a while.”I sink down on the bed across from Tori. She is sitting up, her leg propped on astack of pillows.“Yes, it has,” I say. “How are you feeling?”“Like I got shot.” A smile plays over her lips. “I hear you’re familiar with thefeeling.”“Yeah. It’s great, right?” All I can think of is the bullet in Shauna’s back. Atleast Tori and I will recover from our wounds.“Did you discover anything interesting at Jack’s meeting?” she says.“A few things. Do you know how we might go about calling a Dauntless meeting?”“I can make it happen. One thing about being a tattoo artist in Dauntless is …you know pretty much everyone.”“Right,” I say. “You also have the prestige of being a former spy.”Tori’s mouth twists. “I had almost forgotten.”“Did you discover anything interesting? As a spy, I mean.”“My mission was primarily focused on Jeanine Matthews.” She glares at her hands.“How she spends her days. And, more importantly, where she spends them.”“Not in her office, then?”Tori doesn’t answer at first.“I guess I can trust you, Divergent.” She looks at me from the corner of hereye. “She has a private laboratory on the top level. Insane security measuresprotecting it. I was trying to get up there when they figured out what I was.”“You were trying to get up there,” I say. Her eyes flit away from mine. “Not tospy, I take it.”“I thought it would be more … expedient if Jeanine Matthews didn’t survive muchlonger.”I see a kind of thirst in her expression, the same one I saw when she told meabout her brother in the back room of the tattoo parlor. Before the attacksimulation I might have called it a thirst for justice, or even revenge, but nowI am able to identify it as a thirst for blood. And even as it frightens me, Iunderstand it.Which should probably frighten me even more.Tori says, “I’ll work on calling that meeting.” The Dauntless are gathered in the space between the rows of bunk beds and thedoors, which are held shut by a tightly wrapped bedsheet, the best lock theDauntless could muster. I have no doubt that Jack Kang will agree to Jeanine’sdemands. We aren’t safe here anymore.“What were the terms?” Tori says. She sits in a chair between a few of thebunks, her wounded leg stuck out in front of her. She asks Tobias, but hedoesn’t seem to be paying attention. He is leaning against one of the bunks, hisarms crossed, staring at the floor.I clear my throat. “There were three. Return Eric to the Erudite. Report thenames of all people who did not get shot with needles last time. And deliver theDivergent to Erudite headquarters.”I look at Marlene. She smiles back at me a little sadly. She is probably worriedabout Shauna, who is still with the Erudite doctor. Lynn, Hector, their parents,and Zeke are with her.“If Jack Kang is making deals with the Erudite, we can’t stay here,” says Tori.“So where can we go?”I think of the blood on Shauna’s shirt, and long for the Amity orchards, thesound of the wind in the leaves, the feeling of bark beneath my hands. I neverthought I would crave that place. I didn’t think it was in me.I close my eyes briefly, and when I open them I am in reality, and Amity is adream.“Home,” Tobias says, lifting his head at last. Everyone is listening. “We shouldtake back what’s ours. We can break the security cameras in Dauntlessheadquarters so the Erudite can’t see us. We should go home.”Someone assents with a shout, and someone else joins in. That is how things inDauntless are decided: with nods and yells. In these moments we don’t seem likeindividuals anymore. We are all a part of the same mind.“But before we do that,” says Bud, who once worked with Tori in the tattooparlor and who now stands with his hand on the back of Tori’s chair, “we need todecide what to do about Eric. To let him stay here with the Erudite, or toexecute him.”“Eric is Dauntless,” Lauren says, turning the ring in her lip with herfingertips. “That means we decide what happens to him. Not Candor.”This time a yell tears from my body of its own volition, joining with the othersin agreement.“According to Dauntless law, only Dauntless leaders can perform an execution.All five of our former leaders are Dauntless traitors,” says Tori. “So I thinkit’s time we pick new ones. The law says we need more than one, and we need anodd number. If you’ve got suggestions, you should shout them out now, and we’llvote if we need to.”“You!” someone calls out.“Okay,” says Tori. “Anyone else?”Marlene cups her hands around her mouth and calls out, “Tris!”My heart pounds. But to my surprise, no one mutters in dissent and no onelaughs. Instead, a few people nod, just like they did when Tori’s name wasmentioned. I scan the crowd and find Christina. She stands with her armscrossed, and does not seem to react at all to my nomination.I wonder how I seem to them. They must see someone I don’t see. Someone capableand strong. Someone I can’t be; someone I can be.Tori acknowledges Marlene with a nod and scans the crowd for anotherrecommendation.“Harrison,” someone says. I don’t know who Harrison is until someone slaps amiddle-aged man with a blond ponytail on the shoulder, and he grins. I recognizehim—he’s the Dauntless man who called me “girl” when Zeke and Tori came backfrom Erudite headquarters.The Dauntless are quiet for a moment.“I’m going to nominate Four,” says Tori.Apart from a few angry murmurs in the back of the room, no one disagrees. No oneis calling him a coward anymore, not after he beat up Marcus in the cafeteria. Iwonder how they would react if they knew how calculated that move was.Now he could get exactly what he intended to get. Unless I stand in his way.“We only need three leaders,” Tori says. “We’ll have to vote.”They would never have considered me if I had not stopped the attack simulation.And maybe they wouldn’t have considered me if I hadn’t stabbed Eric by thoseelevators, or put myself under that bridge. The more reckless I get, the morepopular I am with the Dauntless.Tobias looks at me. I can’t be popular with the Dauntless, because Tobias isright—I’m not Dauntless; I’m Divergent. I am whatever I choose to be. And Ican’t choose to be this. I have to stay separate from them.“No,” I say. I clear my throat and say it louder. “No, you don’t have to vote. Irefuse my nomination.”Tori raises her eyebrows at me. “Are you sure, Tris?”“Yes,” I say. “I don’t want it. I’m sure.”And then, without argument and without ceremony, Tobias is elected to be aleader of Dauntless. And I am not."},{"pageContent":"[images/00024.jpg]NOT TEN SECONDS after we choose our new leaders, something rings—one long pulse,two short ones. I move toward the sound, my right ear toward the wall, and finda speaker suspended from the ceiling. There is another one across the room.Then Jack Kang’s voice speaks all around us.“Attention all occupants of Candor headquarters. A few hours ago I met with arepresentative of Jeanine Matthews. He reminded me that we Candor are in a weakposition, dependent on Erudite for our survival, and told me that if I intend tokeep my faction free, I will have to meet a few demands.”I stare up at the speaker, stunned. I shouldn’t be surprised that the leader ofCandor is this forthright, but I wasn’t expecting a public announcement.“In order to comply with these demands, I ask that everyone make their way tothe Gathering Place to report whether you have an implant or not,” he says. “TheErudite have also ordered all Divergent to be turned over to Erudite. I do notknow for what purpose.”He sounds listless. Defeated. Well, he is defeated, I think. Because he was tooweak to fight back.One thing Dauntless knows that Candor does not is how to fight even whenfighting seems useless.Sometimes I feel like I am collecting the lessons each faction has to teach me,and storing them in my mind like a guidebook for moving through the world. Thereis always something to learn, always something that is important to understand.Jack Kang’s announcement ends with the same three rings it started with. TheDauntless rush through the room, throwing their things into bags. A few youngDauntless men cut the sheet away from the door, screaming something about Eric.Someone’s elbow presses me to a wall, and I just stand and watch the pandemoniumintensify.On the other hand, one thing Candor knows that Dauntless does not is how not toget carried away. The Dauntless stand in a semicircle around the interrogation chair, where Ericnow sits. He looks more dead than alive. He is slumped in the chair, sweatshining on his pale forehead. He stares at Tobias with his head tilted down, sohis eyelashes blend into his eyebrows. I try to keep my eyes on him, but hissmile—how the piercings pull wide when his lips spread—is almost too awful totake.“Would you like me to tell you your crimes?” says Tori. “Or would you like tolist them yourself?”Rain sprays against the side of the building and streams down the walls. Westand in the interrogation room, on the top floor of the Merciless Mart. Theafternoon storm is louder here. Every crack of thunder and flash of lightningmakes the back of my neck prickle, as if electricity is dancing over my skin.I like the smell of wet pavement. It is faint here, but once this is done, allthe Dauntless will storm down the stairs and leave the Merciless Mart behind,and wet pavement will be the only thing I smell.We have our bags with us. Mine is a sack made of a sheet and some rope. Itcontains my clothes and a spare pair of shoes. I wear the jacket I stole fromthe Dauntless traitor—I want Eric to see it if he looks at me.Eric scans the crowd for a few seconds, and then his eyes settle on me. He laceshis fingers and sets them—gingerly—on his stomach. “I’d like her to list them.Since she’s the one who stabbed me, clearly she is familiar with them.”I don’t know what game he’s playing, or what the point of rattling me is,especially now, before his execution. He seems arrogant, but I notice that hisfingers tremble when he moves them. Even Eric must be afraid of death.“Leave her out of this,” says Tobias.“Why? Because you’re doing her?” Eric smirks. “Oh wait, I forgot. Stiffs don’tdo that sort of thing. They just tie each other’s shoes and cut each other’shair.”Tobias’s expression does not change. I think I understand: Eric doesn’t reallycare about me. But he knows exactly where to hit Tobias, and how hard. And oneof the places to hit Tobias the hardest is to hit me.This is what I wanted most to avoid: for my rises and falls to become Tobias’srises and falls. That’s why I can’t let him step in to defend me now.“I want her to list them,” repeats Eric.I say, as evenly as possible:“You conspired with Erudite. You are responsible for the deaths of hundreds ofAbnegation.” As I go on, I can’t keep my voice steady anymore; I start to spitout the words like venom. “You betrayed Dauntless. You shot a child in the head.You are a ridiculous plaything of Jeanine Matthews.”His smile fades.“Do I deserve to die?” he says.Tobias opens his mouth to interrupt. But I respond before he can.“Yes.”“Fair enough.” His dark eyes are empty, like pits, like starless nights. “But doyou have the right to decide that, Beatrice Prior? Like you decided the fate ofthat other boy—what was his name? Will?”I don’t answer. I hear my father asking me, “What makes you think you have theright to shoot someone?” as we fought our way to the control room in Dauntlessheadquarters. He told me there is a right way to do something, and I needed tofigure it out. I feel something in my throat, like a ball of wax, so thick I canbarely swallow, barely breathe.“You have committed every crime that warrants execution among the Dauntless,”says Tobias. “We have the right to execute you, under the laws of Dauntless.”He crouches by the three guns on the floor near Eric’s feet. One by one, heempties the chambers of bullets. They almost jingle as they hit the floor, andthen roll, coming to rest against the toes of Tobias’s shoes. He picks up themiddle gun and puts a bullet into the first slot.Then he moves the three guns on the floor, around and around, until my eyescan’t follow the middle gun anymore. I lose track of which one holds the bullet.He picks up the guns and offers one to Tori, and another one to Harrison.I try to think of the attack simulation, and what it did to the Abnegation. Allthe gray-clothed innocents lying dead on the street. There weren’t even enoughAbnegation left to take care of the bodies, so most of them are probably stillthere. And that would not have been possible without Eric.I think of the Candor boy, shot without a second’s hesitation, how stiff he wasas he hit the ground next to me.Maybe we are not the ones deciding if Eric lives or dies. Maybe he is the onewho decided that, when he did all those terrible things.But it’s still hard to breathe.I look at him without malice, without hatred, and without fear. The rings in hisface shine, and a lock of dirty hair falls into his eyes.“Wait,” he says. “I have a request.”“We don’t take requests from criminals,” says Tori. She’s standing on one leg,and has been for the past few minutes. She sounds tired—she probably wants toget this over with so she can sit down again. To her this execution is just aninconvenience.“I am a leader of Dauntless,” he says. “And all I want is for Four to be the onewho fires that bullet.”“Why?” Tobias says.“So you can live with the guilt,” Eric replies. “Of knowing that you usurped meand then shot me in the head.”I think I understand. He wants to see people break—has always wanted to, eversince he set up the camera in my execution room when I nearly drowned, andprobably long before then. And he believes that if Tobias has to kill him, hewill see that before he dies.Sick.“There won’t be any guilt,” says Tobias.“Then you’ll have no problem doing it.” Eric smiles again.Tobias picks up one of the bullets.“Tell me,” says Eric quietly, “because I’ve always wondered. Is it your daddywho shows up in every fear landscape you’ve ever gone through?”Tobias puts the bullet into an empty chamber without looking up.“You didn’t like that question?” Eric says. “What, afraid the Dauntless aregoing to change their minds about you? Realize that even though you’ve only gotfour fears, you’re still a coward?”He straightens in the chair and puts his hands on the armrests.Tobias holds his gun out from his left shoulder.“Eric,” he says, “be brave.”He squeezes the trigger.I shut my eyes."},{"pageContent":"[images/00026.jpg]BLOOD IS A strange color. It’s darker than you expect it to be.I stare down at Marlene’s hand, which is wrapped around my arm. Her fingernailsare short and jagged—she bites them. She pushes me forward, and I must bewalking, because I can feel myself moving, but in my mind I stand before Ericand he is still alive.He died just like Will did. Slumped just like Will did.I thought the swollen feeling in my throat would go away once he was dead, butit didn’t. I have to take deep, hard breaths to get enough air. Good thing thecrowd around me is so loud that no one can hear me. We march toward the doors.At the front of the pack is Harrison, carrying Tori on his back like a child.She laughs, her arms wrapped around his neck.Tobias sets his hand on my back. I know because I see him come up behind me anddo it, not because I feel it. I don’t feel anything at all.The doors open from the outside. We stop short of stampeding Jack Kang and thegroup of Candor that followed him here.“What have you done?” he says. “I was just told that Eric is missing from hisholding cell.”“He was under our jurisdiction,” says Tori. “We gave him a trial and executedhim. You should be thanking us.”“Why …” Jack’s face turns red. Blood is darker than blush, even though oneconsists of the other. “Why should I be thanking you?”“Because you wanted him to be executed, too, right? Since he murdered one ofyour children?” Tori tilts her head, her eyes wide, innocent. “Well, we tookcare of it for you. And now, if you’ll excuse us, we’re leaving.”“Wha—Leaving?” Jack splutters.If we leave, he will be incapable of fulfilling two of the three demands Max hadof him. The thought terrifies him, and it is all over his face.“I can’t let you do that,” he says.“You don’t let us do anything,” says Tobias. “If you don’t step aside, we willbe forced to walk over you instead of past you.”“Didn’t you come here to find allies?” Jack scowls. “If you do this, we willside with Erudite, I promise you, and you will never find an ally in us again,you—”“We don’t need you as an ally,” says Tori. “We’re Dauntless.”Everyone shouts, and somehow their screams pierce the haze in my mind. Theentire crowd presses forward at once. The Candor in the corridor yelp and diveout of the way as we spill into the hallway like a burst pipe, Dauntless waterspreading to fill the empty space.Marlene’s grip on my arm breaks. I run down the stairs, chasing the heels of theDauntless in front of me, ignoring the jostle of elbows and all the shoutsaround me. I feel like I am an initiate again, storming the stairs of the Hubright after the Choosing Ceremony. My legs burn, but that is all right.We reach the lobby. A group of Candor and Erudite are waiting there, includingthe blond Divergent woman who got dragged to the elevators by her hair, the girlI helped escape, and Cara. They watch the Dauntless stream past them withhelpless looks on their faces.Cara spots me and grabs my arm, wrenching me back. “Where are you all going?”“Dauntless headquarters.” I try to pull my arm free, but she won’t let go. Idon’t look at her face. I can’t look at her right now.“Go to Amity,” I say. “They promised safety to anyone who wants it. You won’t besafe here.”She releases me, almost pushing me away from her in the process.Outside, the ground feels slick beneath my sneakers, and my sack of clothesthumps against my back as I slow to a jog. Rain sprinkles my head and my back.My feet splash through puddles, soaking my pant legs.I smell wet pavement, and pretend that this is all there is. I stand at the railing overlooking the chasm. Water hits the wall beneath me,but it doesn’t come high enough to splash my shoes.A hundred yards away, Bud passes out paintball guns. Someone else passes outpaintballs. Soon the hidden corners of Dauntless headquarters will be coated inmulticolored paint, blocking the lenses of the surveillance cameras.“Hey, Tris,” Zeke says, joining me at the railing. His eyes are red and swollen,but his mouth is curled into a small smile.“Hey. You made it.”“Yeah. We waited until Shauna was stable and then took her here.” He rubs one ofhis eyes with his thumb. “I didn’t want to move her, but … wasn’t safe withCandor anymore. Obviously.”“How is she?”“Dunno. She’s gonna survive it, but the nurse thinks she might be paralyzed fromthe waist down. And that wouldn’t bother me, but …” He lifts a shoulder. “Howcan she be Dauntless if she can’t walk?”I stare across the Pit, where some Dauntless children chase each other up thepath, hurling paintballs at the walls. One of them breaks and splatters thestone with yellow.I think of what Tobias told me when we spent the night with the factionless,about the older Dauntless leaving the faction because they were no longerphysically capable of staying in it. I think of Candor’s rhyming song, whichcalls us the cruelest faction.“She can,” I say.“Tris. She won’t even be able to move around.”“Sure she will.” I look up at him. “She can get a wheelchair, and someone canpush her up the paths in the Pit, and there’s an elevator in the building upthere.” I point above our heads. “She doesn’t need to be able to walk to slidedown the zip line or fire a gun.”“She won’t want me to push her.” His voice cracks a little. “She won’t want meto lift her, or carry her.”“She’ll have to get over it, then. Are you going to let her drop out ofDauntless for a stupid reason like not being able to walk?”Zeke is quiet for a few seconds. His eyes shift over my face, and he squints, asif weighing and measuring me.Then he turns and bends and wraps his arms around me. It’s been so long sincesomeone hugged me that I stiffen. Then I relax, and let the gesture force warmthinto my body, which is chilled by damp clothing.“I’m gonna go shoot things,” he says as he pulls away. “Want to come?”I shrug and chase him across the Pit floor. Bud hands each of us a paintballgun, and I load mine. Its weight, shape, and material are so different from arevolver that I have no trouble holding it.“We’ve mostly got the Pit and the underground covered,” Bud says. “But youshould tackle the Pire.”“The Pire?”Bud points up at the glass building above us. The sight pierces me like aneedle. The last time I stood in this spot and stared up at this ceiling, I wason a mission to destroy the simulation. I was with my father.Zeke is already on his way up the path. I force myself to follow him, one footand then the other. It’s difficult to walk because it’s difficult to breathe,but somehow I manage. By the time I reach the stairs, the pressure on my chestis almost gone.Once we’re in the Pire, Zeke lifts up his gun and aims at one of the camerasnear the ceiling. He fires, and green paint sprays across one of the windows,missing the camera lens.“Ooh,” I say, wincing. “Ouch.”“Yeah? I’d like to see you do it perfectly the first time.”“Would you?” I lift my own gun, propping it up on my left shoulder instead of myright. The gun feels unfamiliar in my left hand, but I can’t bear its weightwith my right yet. Through the scope I find the camera, and then squint to stareat the lens. A voice whispers in my head. Inhale. Aim. Exhale. Fire. It takes mea few seconds to realize it’s Tobias’s voice, because he’s the one who taught meto shoot. I squeeze the trigger and the paintball hits the camera, spraying bluepaint across the lens. “There. Now you have. With the wrong hand, too.”Zeke mutters something under his breath that doesn’t sound pleasant.“Hey!” shouts a cheerful voice. Marlene pokes her head above the glass floor.Paint is smeared across her forehead, giving her a purple eyebrow. With a wickedsmile, she aims at Zeke, hitting his leg, and then at me. The paintball hits myarm, stinging.Marlene laughs and ducks under the glass. Zeke and I look at each other, andthen run after Marlene. She laughs as she sprints down the path, weaving througha crowd of kids. I shoot at her, and hit the wall instead. Marlene fires at aboy near the railing—Hector, Lynn’s little brother. He looks shocked at first,but then fires back, hitting the person next to Marlene.Popping sounds fill the air as everyone in the Pit starts to fire at oneanother, young and old, the cameras momentarily forgotten. I charge down thepath, surrounded by laughter and shouting. We cluster together to form teams,and then turn against one another.By the time the fight dies down, my clothes are more paint-colored than black. Idecide to keep the shirt to remind me why I chose Dauntless in the first place:not because they are perfect, but because they are alive. Because they are free."},{"pageContent":"[images/00028.jpg]SOMEONE RAIDS THE Dauntless kitchens and heats up the imperishables kept there,so we have a warm dinner that night. I sit at the same table I used to claimwith Christina, Al, and Will. From the moment I sit down, I feel a lump in mythroat. How is it that only half of us are left?I feel responsible for that. My forgiveness could have saved Al, but I withheldit. My clearheadedness could have spared Will, but I could not summon it.Before I can sink too far into my guilt, Uriah drops his tray next to me. It isloaded with beef stew and chocolate cake. I stare at the cake pile.“There was cake?” I say, looking at my own plate, which is more sensibly stockedthan Uriah’s.“Yeah, someone just brought it out. Found a couple boxes of the mix in the backand baked it,” he says. “You can have a few bites of mine.”“A few bites? So you’re planning on eating that mountain of cake by yourself?”“Yes.” He looks confused. “Why?”“Never mind.”Christina sits across the table, as far away from me as she can get. Zeke putshis tray down next to her. We are soon joined by Lynn, Hector, and Marlene. Isee a flash of movement under the table, and see Marlene’s hand meet Uriah’sover his knee. Their fingers twist together. They are both clearly trying tolook casual, but they sneak looks at each other.To Marlene’s left, Lynn looks like she just tasted something sour. She shovelsfood into her mouth.“Where’s the fire?” Uriah asks her. “You’re going to hurl if you keep eatingthat fast.”Lynn scowls at him. “I’m going to hurl anyway, with you two making eyes at eachother all the time.”Uriah’s ears turn red. “What are you talking about?”“I am not an idiot, and neither is anyone else. So why don’t you just make outwith her and get it over with?”Uriah looks stunned. Marlene, however, glares at Lynn, leans over, and kissesUriah firmly on the mouth, her fingers sliding around his neck, under the collarof his shirt. I notice that all the peas have fallen off my fork, which was onits way to my mouth.Lynn grabs her tray and storms away from the table.“What was that all about?” says Zeke.“Don’t ask me,” says Hector. “She’s always angry about something. I’ve stoppedtrying to keep track.”Uriah’s and Marlene’s faces are still close together. And they are stillsmiling.I force myself to stare at my plate. It is so strange to see two people you haveknown separately join together, though I have watched it happen before. I hear asqueak as Christina scratches her plate with her fork idly.“Four!” Zeke calls out, beckoning. He looks relieved. “C’mere, there’s room.”Tobias rests his hand on my good shoulder. A few of his knuckles are split, andthe blood looks fresh. “Sorry, I can’t stay.”He leans down and says, “Can I borrow you for a while?”I get up, waving a good-bye to everyone at the table who is payingattention—which is just Zeke, really, because Christina and Hector are staringat their plates, and Uriah and Marlene are talking quietly. Tobias and I walkout of the cafeteria.“Where are we going?”“The train,” he says. “I have a meeting, and I want you there to help me readthe situation.”We walk up one of the paths that lines the Pit walls, toward the stairs thatlead us to the Pire.“Why do you need me to—”“Because you’re better at it than I am.”I don’t have a response to that. We ascend the stairs and cross the glass floor.On our way out, we walk through the dank room in which I faced my fearlandscape. Judging by the syringe on the floor, someone has been there recently.“Did you go through your fear landscape today?” I say.“What makes you say that?” His dark eyes skirt mine. He pushes the front dooropen, and the summer air swims around me. There is no wind.“Your knuckles are cut up and someone’s been using that room.”“This is exactly what I mean. You’re far more perceptive than most.” He checkshis watch. “They told me to catch the one leaving at 8:05. Come on.”I feel a surge of hope. Maybe we won’t argue this time. Maybe things willfinally get better between us.We walk to the tracks. The last time we did this, he wanted to show me that thelights were on in the Erudite compound, wanted to tell me that Erudite wasplanning an attack on Abnegation. Now I get the sense we are about to meet withthe factionless.“Perceptive enough to know you’re evading the question,” I say.He sighs. “Yes, I went through my fear landscape. I wanted to see if it hadchanged.”“And it has. Hasn’t it?”He brushes a stray hair away from his face and avoids my eyes. I didn’t know hishair was so thick—it was hard to tell when it was buzzed short, Abnegation hair,but now it’s two inches long and almost hangs over his forehead. It makes himlook less threatening, more like the person I’ve come to know in private.“Yes,” he says. “But the number is still the same.”I hear the train horn blasting to my left, but the light fixed to the first caris not on. Instead it slides over the rails like some hidden, creeping thing.“Fifth car back!” he shouts.We both break into a sprint. I find the fifth car and grab the handle on theside with my left hand, pulling as hard as I can. I try to swing my legs inside,but they don’t quite make it; they are dangerously close to the wheels—I shriek,and scrape my knee against the floor as I yank myself inside.Tobias gets in after me and crouches by my side. I clutch my knee and grit myteeth.“Here, let me see,” he says. He pushes my jeans up my leg and over my knee. Hisfingers leave streaks of cold on my skin, invisible to the eye, and I thinkabout wrapping his shirt around my fist and pulling him in to kiss me; I thinkabout pressing myself against him, but I can’t, because all our secrets wouldkeep a space between us.My knee is red with blood. “It’s shallow. It’ll heal quickly,” he says.I nod. The pain is already subsiding. He rolls my jeans so they will stay up. Ilie back, staring at the ceiling.“So is he still in your fear landscape?” I say.It looks like someone lit a match behind his eyes. “Yes. But not in the sameway.”He told me, once, that his fear landscape hadn’t changed since he first wentthrough it, during his initiation. So if it has, even in a small way, that’ssomething.“You’re in it, though.” He frowns at his hands. “Instead of having to shoot thatwoman, like I used to, I have to watch you die. And there’s nothing I can do tostop it.”His hands shake. I try to think of something helpful to say. I’m not going todie—but I don’t know that. We live in a dangerous world, and I am not soattached to life that I will do anything to survive. I can’t reassure him.He checks his watch. “They’ll be here any minute.”I get up, and see Evelyn and Edward standing next to the tracks. They run beforethe train passes them, and jump in with almost as little trouble as Tobias. Theymust have been practicing.Edward smirks at me. Today his eye patch has a big blue “X” stitched over it.“Hello,” Evelyn says. She looks only at Tobias as she says it, like I’m not eventhere.“Nice meeting location,” says Tobias. It is almost dark now, so I see onlyshadows of buildings against a dark blue sky, and a few glowing lights near thelake that must belong to Erudite headquarters.The train takes a turn it doesn’t usually take—left, away from the glow ofErudite and into the abandoned part of the city. I can tell by the growing quietin the car that it is slowing down.“It seemed safest,” says Evelyn. “So you wanted to meet.”“Yes. I’d like to discuss an alliance.”“An alliance,” repeats Edward. “And who gave you the authority to do that?”“He’s a Dauntless leader,” I say. “He has the authority.”Edward raises his eyebrows, looking impressed. Evelyn’s eyes finally shift tome, but only for a second before she smiles at Tobias again.“Interesting,” she says. “And is she also a Dauntless leader?”“No,” he says. “She’s here to help me decide whether or not to trust you.”Evelyn purses her lips. Part of me wants to thumb my nose at her and say, “Ha!”But I settle for a small smile.“We will, of course, agree to an alliance … under a certain set of conditions,”Evelyn says. “A guaranteed—and equal—place in whatever government forms afterErudite is destroyed, and full control over Erudite data after the attack.Clearly—”“What are you going to do with the Erudite data?” I interrupt her.“Obviously we will destroy it. The only way to deprive the Erudite of power isto deprive them of knowledge.”My first instinct is to tell her she’s a fool. But something stops me. Withoutthe simulation technology, without the data they had about all the otherfactions, without their focus on technological advancement, the attack onAbnegation would not have happened. My parents would be alive.Even if we manage to kill Jeanine, could the Erudite be trusted not to attackand control us again? I am not sure.“What would we receive in return, under those terms?” Tobias says.“Our much-needed manpower, in order to take Erudite headquarters, and an equalplace in government, with us.”“I am sure that Tori would also request the right to rid the world of JeanineMatthews,” he says in a low voice.I raise my eyebrows. I didn’t know that Tori’s hatred of Jeanine was commonknowledge—or maybe it isn’t. He must know things about her that others don’t,now that he and Tori are leaders.“I’m sure that could be arranged,” Evelyn replies. “I don’t care who kills her;I just want her dead.”Tobias glances at me. I wish I could tell him why I feel so conflicted … explainto him why I, of all people, have reservations about burning Erudite to theground, so to speak. But I would not know how to say it even if I had the timeto. He turns toward Evelyn.“Then we are agreed,” he says.He extends his hand, and she shakes it.“We should convene in a week’s time,” she says. “In neutral territory. Most ofthe Abnegation have graciously agreed to let us stay in their sector of the cityto plan as they clean up the aftermath of the attack.”“Most of them,” he says.Evelyn’s expression turns flat. “I’m afraid your father still commands theloyalty of many of them, and he advised them to avoid us when he came to visit afew days ago.” She smiles bitterly. “And they agreed, just as they did when hepersuaded them to exile me.”“They exiled you?” says Tobias. “I thought you left.”“No, the Abnegation were inclined toward forgiveness and reconciliation, as youmight expect. But your father has a lot of influence over the Abnegation, and healways has. I decided to leave rather than face the indignity of public exile.”Tobias looks stunned.Edward, who has been leaning out the side of the car for a few seconds, says,“It’s time!”“See you in a week,” Evelyn says.As the train dips down to street level, Edward leaps. A few seconds later,Evelyn follows. Tobias and I remain on the train, listening to it hiss againstthe rails, without speaking.“Why did you even bring me along, if you were just going to make an allianceanyway?” I say flatly.“You didn’t stop me.”“What was I supposed to do, wave my hands in the air?” I scowl at him. “I don’tlike it.”“It has to be done.”“I don’t think it does,” I say. “There has to be another way—”“What other way?” he says, folding his arms. “You just don’t like her. Youhaven’t since you first met her.”“Obviously I don’t like her! She abandoned you!”“They exiled her. And if I decide to forgive her, you had better try to do ittoo! I’m the one who got left behind, not you.”“This is about more than that. I don’t trust her. I think she’s trying to useyou.”“Well, it isn’t for you to decide.”“Why did you bring me, again?” I say, mirroring him by folding my arms. “Ohyeah—so that I could read the situation for you. Well, I read it, and justbecause you don’t like what I decided doesn’t mean—”“I forgot about how your biases cloud your judgment. If I had remembered, Imight not have brought you.”“My biases. What about your biases? What about thinking everyone who hates yourfather as much as you do is an ally?”“This is not about him!”“Of course it is! He knows things, Tobias. And we should be trying to find outwhat they are.”“This again? I thought we resolved this. He is a liar, Tris.”“Yeah?” I raise my eyebrows. “Well, so is your mother. You think the Abnegationwould really exile someone? Because I don’t.”“Don’t talk about my mother that way.”I see light up ahead. It belongs to the Pire.“Fine.” I walk to the edge of the car door. “I won’t.”I jump out, running a few steps to keep my balance. Tobias jumps out after me,but I don’t give him a chance to catch up—I walk straight into the building,down the stairs, and back into the Pit to find a place to sleep."},{"pageContent":"[images/00030.jpg]SOMETHING SHAKES ME awake.“Tris! Get up!”A shout. I don’t question it. I throw my legs over the edge of the bed and let ahand pull me toward the door. My feet are bare, and the ground is uneven here.It scrapes at my toes and the edges of my heels. I squint ahead of me to figureout who’s dragging me. Christina. She’s almost pulling my left arm from itssocket.“What happened?” I say. “What’s going on?”“Shut up and run!”We run to the Pit, and the roar of the river follows me up the paths. The lasttime Christina pulled me out of bed, it was to see Al’s body lifted out of thechasm. I grit my teeth and try not to think about that. It can’t have happenedagain. It can’t.I gasp—she runs faster than I do—as we sprint across the glass floor of thePire. Christina slams her palm into an elevator button and slips inside beforethe doors are fully open, dragging me behind her. She jabs the DOOR CLOSEbutton, and then the button for the top floor.“Simulation,” she says. “There’s a simulation. It’s not everyone, it’s just …just a few.”She puts her hands on her knees and takes deep breaths.“One of them said something about the Divergent,” she says.“Said that?” I say. “While under a simulation?”She nods. “Marlene. Didn’t sound like her, though. Too … monotone.”The doors open, and I follow her down the hallway to the door marked ROOFACCESS.“Christina,” I say, “why are we going to the roof?”She doesn’t answer me. The stairs to the roof smell like old paint. Dauntlessgraffiti is scrawled on the cement-block walls in black paint. The symbol ofDauntless. Initials paired together with plus signs: RG + NT, BR + FH. Coupleswho are probably old now, maybe broken up. I touch my chest to feel myheartbeat. It’s so fast, it’s a wonder I’m still breathing at all.The night air is cool; it gives me goose bumps on my arms. My eyes have adjustedto the darkness by now, and across the roof I see three figures standing on theledge, facing me. One is Marlene. One is Hector. One is someone I don’trecognize—a young Dauntless, barely eight years old, with a green streak in herhair.They stand still on the ledge, though the wind is blowing hard, tossing theirhair over their foreheads, into their eyes, into their mouths. Their clothessnap in the wind, but still they stand motionless.“Just come down off the ledge now,” Christina says. “Don’t do anything stupid.Come on, now …”“They can’t hear you,” I say quietly as I walk toward them. “Or see you.”“We should all jump at them at once. I’ll take Hec, you—”“We’ll risk shoving them off the roof if we do that. Stand by the girl, just incase.”She is too young for this, I think, but I don’t have the heart to say it,because it means Marlene is old enough.I stare at Marlene, whose eyes are blank like painted stones, like spheres ofglass. I feel as if those stones are slipping down my throat and settling in mystomach, pulling me toward the ground. There is no way to get her off thatledge.Finally she opens her mouth and speaks.“I have a message for the Divergent.” Her voice sounds flat. The simulation isusing her vocal cords, but robs them of the natural fluctuations of humanemotion.I look from Marlene to Hector. Hector, who was so afraid of what I am becausehis mother told him to be. Lynn is probably still at Shauna’s bedside, hopingShauna can move her legs when she wakes up again. Lynn can’t lose Hector.I step forward to receive the message.“This is not a negotiation. It is a warning,” says the simulation throughMarlene, moving her lips and vibrating in her throat. “Every two days until oneof you delivers yourself to Erudite headquarters, this will happen again.”This.Marlene steps back, and I throw myself forward, but not at her. Not at Marlene,who once let Uriah shoot a muffin off her head on a dare. Who gathered a stackof clothing for me to wear. Who always, always greeted me with a smile. No, notat Marlene.As Marlene and the other Dauntless girl step off the edge of the roof, I dive atHector.I grab whatever my hands can find. An arm. A fistful of shirt. The rough rooftopscrapes my knees as his weight drags me forward. I am not strong enough to lifthim. I whisper, “Help,” because I can’t speak any louder than that.Christina is already at my shoulder. She helps me haul Hector’s limp body ontothe roof. His arm flops to the side, lifeless. A few feet away, the little girllies on her back on the rooftop.Then the simulation ends. Hector opens his eyes, and they are no longer empty.“Ow,” he says. “What’s going on?”The little girl whimpers, and Christina walks over to her, mumbling something ina reassuring voice.I stand, my entire body shaking. I inch toward the edge of the roof and stare atthe ground. The street below isn’t lit very well, but I can see Marlene’s faintoutline on the pavement.Breathing—who cares about breathing?I turn from the sight, listening to my heart beat in my ears. Christina’s mouthmoves. I ignore her, and walk to the door and down the stairs and down thehallway and into the elevator.The doors close and as I drop to the earth, just as Marlene did after I decidednot to save her, I scream, my hands tearing at my clothes. My throat is rawafter just a few seconds, and there are scratches on my arms where I missed thefabric, but I keep screaming.The elevator stops with a ding. The doors open.I straighten my shirt, smooth my hair down, and walk out. I have a message for the Divergent.I am Divergent.This is not a negotiation.No, it is not.It is a warning.I understand.Every two days until one of you delivers yourself to Erudite headquarters …I will.… this will happen again.It will never happen again."},{"pageContent":"[images/00032.jpg]I WEAVE THROUGH the crowd next to the chasm. It’s loud in the Pit, and not justbecause of the river’s roar. I want to find some silence, so I escape into thehallway that leads to the dormitories. I don’t want to hear the speech Tori willmake on Marlene’s behalf or be around for the toasting and the shouting as theDauntless celebrate her life and her bravery.This morning Lauren reported that we missed some of the cameras in the initiatedormitories, where Christina, Zeke, Lauren, Marlene, Hector, and Kee, the girlwith the green hair, were sleeping. That’s how Jeanine figured out who thesimulation was controlling. I do not doubt that Jeanine chose young Dauntlessbecause she knew their deaths would affect us more.I stop in an unfamiliar hallway and press my forehead to the wall. The stonefeels rough and cool on my skin. I can hear the Dauntless shouting behind me,their voices muffled by layers of rock.I hear someone approaching, and look to the side. Christina, still wearing thesame clothes she wore last night, stands a few feet away.“Hey,” she says.“I’m not really in the mood to feel more guilt right now. So go away, please.”“I just want to say one thing, and then I will.”Her eyes are puffy and her voice sounds a little sleepy, which is either due toexhaustion or a little alcohol, or both. But her stare is direct enough that shemust know what she’s saying. I pull away from the wall.“I’d never seen that kind of simulation before. You know, from the outside. Butyesterday …” She shakes her head. “You were right. They couldn’t hear you,couldn’t see you. Just like Will …”She chokes on his name. Stops, takes a breath, swallows hard. Blinks a fewtimes. Then looks at me again.“You told me you had to do it, or he would have shot you, and I didn’t believeyou. I believe you now, and … I’m going to try to forgive you. That’s … all Iwanted to say.”There’s a part of me that feels relief. She believes me, she’s trying to forgiveme, even though it won’t be easy.But a larger part of me feels anger. What did she think, before now? That Iwanted to shoot Will, one of my best friends? She should have trusted me fromthe beginning, should have known that I wouldn’t have done it if I had been ableto see another option at the time.“How fortunate for me that you finally got proof that I’m not a cold-bloodedmurderer. You know, other than my word. I mean, what reason would you have totrust that?” I force a laugh, trying to stay nonchalant. She opens her mouth,but I keep talking, unable to stop myself. “You’d better hurry on thatforgiving-me thing, because there isn’t much time—”My voice cracks, and I can’t hold myself together anymore. I start sobbing. Ilean against the wall for support and feel myself sliding down as my legs getweak.My eyes are too blurry to see her, but I feel her when she wraps her arms aroundme and squeezes so hard it hurts. She smells like coconut oil and she feelsstrong, exactly like she was during initiation into Dauntless, when she hungover the chasm by her fingertips. Back then—which was not so long ago—she mademe feel weak, but now her strength makes me feel like I could be stronger too.We kneel together on the stone floor, and I clutch her as tightly as sheclutches me.“It’s already done,” she says. “That’s what I meant to say. That the forgivingwas already done.” All the Dauntless go quiet when I walk into the cafeteria that night. I don’tblame them. As one of the Divergent, I have the power to let Jeanine kill one ofthem. Most of them probably want me to sacrifice myself. Or they are terrifiedthat I won’t.If this were Abnegation, no Divergent would be sitting here right now.For a moment I don’t know where to go or how to get there. But then Zeke wavesme over to his table, looking grim, and I guide my feet in that direction. Butbefore I make it there, Lynn approaches me.She is a different Lynn from the one I have always known. She doesn’t have afierce look in her eyes. Instead she is pale and biting her lip to hide itswobble.“Um …” she says. She looks to the left, to the right, anywhere but at my face.“I really … I miss Marlene. I’ve known her for a long time, and I …” She shakesher head. “The point is, don’t think that my saying this means anything aboutMarlene,” she says, like she’s scolding me, “but … thank you for saving Hec.”Lynn shifts her weight from one foot to the other, her eyes flicking around theroom. Then she hugs me with one arm, her hand gripping my shirt. Pain shootsthrough my shoulder. I don’t say anything about it.She lets go, sniffs, and walks back to her table like nothing happened. I stareat her retreating back for a few seconds, and then sit down.Zeke and Uriah sit side by side at the otherwise empty table. Uriah’s face isslack, like he’s not completely awake. He has a dark brown bottle in front ofhim that he sips from every few seconds.I feel cautious around him. I saved Hec—which means I failed to save Marlene.But Uriah doesn’t look at me. I pull out the chair across from him and sit onthe edge of it.“Where’s Shauna?” I say. “Still in the hospital?”“No, she’s over there,” says Zeke, nodding to the table Lynn walked back to. Isee her there, so pale she might as well be translucent, sitting in awheelchair. “Shauna shouldn’t be up, but Lynn’s pretty messed up, so she’skeeping her company.”“But if you’re wondering why they’re all the way over there … Shauna found outI’m Divergent,” says Uriah sluggishly. “And she doesn’t want to catch it.”“Oh.”“She got all weird with me, too,” says Zeke, sighing. “‘How do you know yourbrother isn’t working against us? Have you been watching him?’ What I wouldn’tgive to punch whoever poisoned her mind.”“You don’t have to give anything,” says Uriah. “Her mother’s sitting rightthere. Go ahead and hit her.”I follow his gaze to a middle-aged woman with blue streaks in her hair andearrings all the way down her earlobe. She is pretty, just like Lynn.Tobias enters the room a moment later, followed by Tori and Harrison. I havebeen avoiding him. I haven’t spoken to him since that fight we had, beforeMarlene …“Hello, Tris,” Tobias says when I’m close enough to hear him. His voice is low,rough. It transports me to quiet places.“Hi,” I say in a tight little voice that does not belong to me.He sits next to me and puts his arm on the back of my chair, leaning close. Idon’t stare back—I refuse to stare back.I stare back.Dark eyes—a peculiar shade of blue, somehow capable of shutting the rest of thecafeteria out, of comforting me and also of reminding me that we are fartheraway from each other than I want us to be.“Aren’t you going to ask me if I’m all right?” I say.“No, I’m pretty sure you’re not all right.” He shakes his head. “I’m going toask you not to make any decisions until we’ve talked about it.”It’s too late, I think. The decision’s made.“Until we’ve all talked about it, you mean, since it involves all of us,” saysUriah. “I don’t think anyone should turn themselves in.”“No one?” I say.“No!” Uriah scowls. “I think we should attack back.”“Yeah,” I say hollowly, “let’s provoke the woman who can force half of thiscompound to kill themselves. That sounds like a great idea.”I was too harsh. Uriah tips the contents of his bottle down his throat. Hebrings the bottle down on the table so hard I’m afraid it will shatter.“Don’t talk about it like that,” he says in a growl.“I’m sorry,” I say. “But you know I’m right. The best way to ensure that halfour faction doesn’t die is to sacrifice one life.”I don’t know what I expected. Maybe that Uriah, who knows too well what willhappen if one of us does not go, would volunteer himself. But he looks down.Unwilling.“Tori and Harrison and I decided to increase security. Hopefully if everyone ismore aware of these attacks, we will be able to stop them,” Tobias says. “If itdoesn’t work, then we will think of another solution. End of discussion. But noone is going to do anything yet. Okay?”He looks at me when he asks and raises his eyebrows.“Okay,” I say, not quite meeting his eyes. After dinner, I try to go back to the dormitory where I’ve been sleeping, but Ican’t quite walk through the door. Instead I walk through the corridors,brushing the stone walls with my fingers, listening to the echoes of myfootsteps.Without meaning to, I pass the water fountain where Peter, Drew, and Al attackedme. I knew it was Al by the way he smelled—I can still call the scent oflemongrass to mind. Now I associate it not with my friend but with thepowerlessness I felt as they dragged me to the chasm.I walk faster, keeping my eyes wide open so it will be harder to picture theattack in my mind. I have to get away from here, far from the places where myfriend attacked me, where Peter stabbed Edward, where a sightless army of myfriends began its march toward the Abnegation sector and all this insanitybegan.I go straight toward the last place where I felt safe: Tobias’s small apartment.The second I reach the door, I feel calmer.The door is not completely closed. I nudge it open with my foot. He isn’t there,but I don’t leave. I sit on his bed and gather the quilt in my arms, burying myface in the fabric and taking deep breaths of it through my nose. The smell itused to have is almost gone, it’s been so long since he slept on it.The door opens and Tobias slips in. My arms go limp, and the quilt falls into mylap. How will I explain my presence here? I’m supposed to be angry with him.He doesn’t scowl, but his mouth is so tense that I know he’s angry with me.“Don’t be an idiot,” he says.“An idiot?”“You were lying. You said you wouldn’t go to Erudite, and you were lying, andgoing to Erudite would make you an idiot. So don’t.”I set the blanket down and get up.“Don’t try to make this simple,” I say. “It’s not. You know as well as I do thatthis is the right thing to do.”“You choose this moment to act like the Abnegation?” His voice fills the roomand makes fear prickle in my chest. His anger seems too sudden. Too strange.“All that time you spent insisting that you were too selfish for them, and now,when your life is on the line, you’ve got to be a hero? What’s wrong with you?”“What’s wrong with you? People died. They walked right off the edge of abuilding! And I can stop it from happening again!”“You’re too important to just … die.” He shakes his head. He won’t even look atme—his eyes keep shifting across my face, to the wall behind me or the ceilingabove me, to everything but me. I am too stunned to be angry.“I’m not important. Everyone will do just fine without me,” I say.“Who cares about everyone? What about me?”He lowers his head into his hand, covering his eyes. His fingers are trembling.Then he crosses the room in two long strides and touches his lips to mine. Theirgentle pressure erases the past few months, and I am the girl who sat on therocks next to the chasm, with river spray on her ankles, and kissed him for thefirst time. I am the girl who grabbed his hand in the hallway just because Iwanted to.I pull back, my hand on his chest to keep him away. The problem is, I am alsothe girl who shot Will and lied about it, and chose between Hector and Marlene,and now a thousand other things besides. And I can’t erase those things.“You would be fine.” I don’t look at him. I stare at his T-shirt between myfingers and the black ink curling around his neck, but I don’t look at his face.“Not at first. But you would move on, and do what you have to.”He wraps an arm around my waist and pulls me against him. “That’s a lie,” hesays, before he kisses me again.This is wrong. It’s wrong to forget who I have become, and to let him kiss mewhen I know what I’m about to do.But I want to. Oh, I want to.I stand on my tiptoes and wrap my arms around him. I press one hand between hisshoulder blades and curl the other one around the back of his neck. I can feelhis breaths against my palm, his body expanding and contracting, and I know he’sstrong, steady, unstoppable. All things I need to be, but I am not, I am not.He walks backward, pulling me with him so I stumble. I stumble right out of myshoes. He sits on the edge of the bed and I stand in front of him, and we’refinally eye to eye.He touches my face, covering my cheeks with his hands, sliding his fingertipsdown my neck, fitting his fingers to the slight curve of my hips.I can’t stop.I fit my mouth to his, and he tastes like water and smells like fresh air. Idrag my hand from his neck to the small of his back, and put it under his shirt.He kisses me harder.I knew he was strong; I didn’t know how strong until I felt it myself, themuscles in his back tightening beneath my fingers.Stop, I tell myself.Suddenly it’s as if we’re in a hurry, his fingertips brushing my side under myshirt, my hands clutching at him, struggling closer but there is no closer. Ihave never longed for someone this way, or this much.He pulls back just enough to look into my eyes, his eyelids lowered.“Promise me,” he whispers, “that you won’t go. For me. Do this one thing forme.”Could I do that? Could I stay here, fix things with him, let someone else die inmy place? Looking up at him, I believe for a moment that I could. And then I seeWill. The crease between his eyebrows. The empty, simulation-bound eyes. Theslumped body.Do this one thing for me. Tobias’s dark eyes plead with me.But if I don’t go to Erudite, who will? Tobias? It’s the kind of thing he woulddo.I feel a stab of pain in my chest as I lie to him. “Okay.”“Promise,” he says, frowning.The pain becomes an ache, spreads everywhere—all mixed together, guilt andterror and longing. “I promise.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00001.jpg]WHEN HE STARTS to fall asleep, he keeps his arms around me fiercely, alife-preserving prison. But I wait, kept awake by the thought of bodies hittingpavement, until his grip loosens and his breathing steadies.I will not let Tobias go to Erudite when it happens again, when someone elsedies. I will not.I slip out of his arms. I shrug on one of his sweatshirts so I can carry thesmell of him with me. I slip my feet into my shoes. I don’t take any weapons orkeepsakes.I pause by the doorway and look at him, half buried under the quilt, peacefuland strong.“I love you,” I say quietly, trying out the words. I let the door close behindme.It’s time to put everything in order.I walk to the dormitory where the Dauntless-born initiates once slept. The roomlooks just like the one I slept in when I was an initiate: it is long andnarrow, with bunk beds on either side and a chalkboard on one wall. I see by ablue light in the corner that no one bothered to erase the rankings that arewritten there—Uriah’s name is still at the top.Christina sleeps in the bottom bunk, beneath Lynn. I don’t want to startle her,but there’s no way to wake her otherwise, so I cover her mouth with my hand. Shewakes with a start, her eyes wide until they find me. I touch my finger to mylips and beckon for her to follow me.I walk to the end of the hallway and turn a corner. The corridor is lit by apaint-spattered emergency lamp that hangs over one of the exits. Christina isn’twearing shoes; she curls her toes under to protect them from the cold.“What is it?” she says. “Are you going somewhere?”“Yeah, I’m …” I have to lie, or she’ll try to stop me. “I’m going to see mybrother. He’s with the Abnegation, remember?”She narrows her eyes.“I’m sorry to wake you,” I say. “But there’s something I need you to do. It’sreally important.”“Okay. Tris, you’re acting really strange. Are you sure you’re not—”“I’m not. Listen to me. The timing of the simulation attack wasn’t random. Thereason it happened when it did is because the Abnegation were about to dosomething—I don’t know what it was, but it had to do with some importantinformation, and now Jeanine has that information….”“What?” She frowns. “You don’t know what they were about to do? Do you know whatthe information is?”“No.” I must sound crazy. “The thing is, I haven’t been able to find out verymuch about this, because Marcus Eaton is the only person who knows everything,and he won’t tell me. I just … it’s the reason for the attack. It’s the reason.And we need to know it.”I don’t know what else to say. But Christina is already nodding.“The reason Jeanine forced us to attack innocent people,” she says bitterly.“Yeah. We need to know it.”I had almost forgotten—she was under the simulation. How many Abnegation did shekill, guided by the simulation? How did she feel when she awoke from that dreama murderer? I have never asked, and I never will.“I want your help, and soon. I need someone to persuade Marcus to cooperate, andI think you can do it.”She tilts her head and stares at me for a few seconds.“Tris. Don’t do anything stupid.”I force a smile. “Why do people keep saying that to me?”She grabs my arm. “I’m not kidding around.”“I told you, I’m going to visit Caleb. I’ll be back in a few days, and we canmake a strategy then. I just thought it would be better if someone else knewabout all this before I left. Just in case. Okay?”She holds my arm for a few seconds, and then releases me. “Okay,” she says.I walk toward the exit. I hold myself together until I’m through the door, andthen I feel the tears come.The last conversation I’ll ever have with her, and it was full of lies. Once I’m outside, I put up the hood of Tobias’s sweatshirt. When I reach the endof the street, I glance up and down, searching for signs of life. There isnothing.The cool air prickles in my lungs on the way in, and on the way out unfurls in acloud of vapor. Winter will be here soon. I wonder if Erudite and Dauntless willstill be at a standstill then, waiting for one group to obliterate the other.I’m glad I won’t have to see it.Before I chose Dauntless, thoughts like that never occurred to me. I feltassured of my long lifespan, if nothing else. Now there are no reassurances,except that where I go, I go because I choose to.I walk in the shadows of buildings, hoping my footsteps won’t attract anyattention. None of the city lights are on in this area, but the moon is brightenough that I can walk by it without too much trouble.I walk beneath the elevated tracks. They shudder with the movement of anoncoming train. I have to walk fast if I want to get there before anyone noticesthat I’m gone. I sidestep a large crack in the street, and jump over a fallenstreetlight.I didn’t think about how far I would have to walk when I set out. It isn’t longbefore my body warms with the exertion of walking and checking over my shoulderand dodging hazards in the road. I pick up the pace, half walking and halfjogging.Soon I reach a part of the city that I recognize. The streets are better kepthere, swept clean, with few holes. Far away I see the glow of Eruditeheadquarters, their lights violating our energy conservation laws. I don’t knowwhat I will do when I get there. Demand to see Jeanine? Or just stand thereuntil someone notices me?My fingertips skim a window in the building beside me. Not long now. Tremors gothrough my body now that I am close, making it difficult to walk. Breathing istricky too; I stop trying to be quiet, and let air wheeze in and out of mylungs. What will they do with me when I get there? What plans do they have forme before I outlive my usefulness, and they kill me? I don’t doubt that theywill kill me eventually. I concentrate on forward motion, on moving my legs eventhough they seem to be unwilling to support my weight.And then I’m standing in front of Erudite headquarters.Inside, crowds of blue-shirted people sit around tables, typing on computers orbent over books or passing sheets of paper back and forth. Some of them aredecent people who do not understand what their faction has done, but if theirentire building collapsed in on them before my eyes, I might not find it inmyself to care.This is the last moment I will be able to turn back. The cold air stings mycheeks and my hands as I hesitate. I can walk away now. Take refuge in theDauntless compound. Hope and pray and wish that no one else dies because of myselfishness.But I can’t walk away, or the guilt, the weight of Will’s life, and my parents’lives, and now Marlene’s life, will break my bones, will make it impossible tobreathe.I slowly walk toward the building and push open the doors.This is the only way to keep from suffocating. For a second after my feet touch the wood floors, and I stand before the giantportrait of Jeanine Matthews hung on the opposite wall, no one notices me, noteven the two Dauntless traitor guards milling around near the entry-way. I walkup to the front desk, where a middle-aged man with a bald patch on the crown ofhis head sits, sorting through a stack of paper. I set my hands on the desk.“Excuse me,” I say.“Give me a moment,” he says without looking up.“No.”At that he looks up, his glasses askew, scowling like he’s about to chastise me.Whatever words he was about to use seem to stick in his throat. He stares at mewith an open mouth, his eyes skipping from my face to the black sweatshirt Iwear.In my terror, his expression seems amusing. I smile a little and conceal myhands, which are trembling.“I believe Jeanine Matthews wanted to see me,” I say. “So I would appreciate itif you would contact her.”He signals to the Dauntless traitors by the door, but there is no need. Theguards have finally caught on. Dauntless soldiers from the other parts of theroom have also started forward, and they all surround me, but don’t touch me,and don’t speak to me. I scan their faces, trying to look as placid as possible.“Divergent?” one of them finally asks as the man behind the desk picks up thereceiver of the building’s communication system.If I close my hands into fists, I can stop them from shaking. I nod.My eyes shift to the Dauntless coming out of the elevator on the left side ofthe room, and the muscles in my face go slack. Peter is coming toward us.A thousand potential reactions, ranging from launching myself at Peter’s throatto crying to making some kind of joke, rush through my mind at once. I can’tdecide on one. So I stand still and watch him. Jeanine must have known that Iwould come, she must have chosen Peter on purpose to collect me, she must have.“We’ve been instructed to take you upstairs,” says Peter.I mean to say something sharp, or nonchalant, but the only sound that escapes meis an assenting noise, squeezed tight by my swollen throat. Peter starts towardthe elevators, and I follow him.We walk down a series of sleek corridors. Despite the fact that we climb a fewflights of stairs, I still feel like I am plunging into the earth.I expect them to take me to Jeanine, but they don’t. They stop walking in ashort hallway with a series of metal doors on each side. Peter types in a codeto open one of the doors, and the traitor Dauntless surround me, shoulder toshoulder, forming a narrow tunnel for me to pass through on my way into theroom.The room is small, maybe six feet long by six feet wide. The floor, the walls,and the ceiling are all made of the same light panels, dim now, that glowed inthe aptitude test room. In each corner is a tiny black camera.I finally let myself panic.I look from corner to corner, at the cameras, and fight the scream building inmy stomach, chest, and throat, the scream that fills every part of me. Again Ifeel guilt and grief clawing inside me, warring with each other for dominance,but terror is stronger than both. I breathe in, and don’t breathe out. My fatheronce told me it was a cure for hiccups. I asked him if I could die from holdingmy breath.“No,” he said. “Your body’s instincts will take over, and force you to breathe.”A shame, really. I could use a way out. The thought makes me want to laugh. Andthen scream.I curl up so I can press my face to my knees. I have to make a plan. If I canmake a plan, I won’t be so afraid.But there is no plan. No escape from deep in Erudite headquarters, no escapefrom Jeanine, and no other escape from what I’ve done."},{"pageContent":"[images/00009.jpg]I FORGOT MY watch.Minutes or hours later, when the panic subsides, that is what I most regret. Notcoming here in the first place—that seemed like an obvious choice—but my barewrist, which makes it impossible for me to know how long I have been sitting inthis room. My back aches, which is some indication, but it is not definiteenough.After a while I get up and pace, stretching my arms above my head. I hesitate todo anything while the cameras are there, but they can’t learn anything bywatching me touch my toes.The thought makes my hands tremble, but I don’t try to push it from my mind.Instead I tell myself that I am Dauntless and I am no stranger to fear. I willdie in this place. Perhaps soon. Those are the facts.But there are other ways to think of it. Soon I will honor my parents by dyingas they died. And if all they believed about death was true, soon I will jointhem in whatever comes next.I shake my hands as I pace. They’re still trembling. I want to know what time itis. I arrived a little after midnight. It must be early in the morning by now,maybe 4:00, or 5:00. Or maybe it hasn’t been that long, and only seems that waybecause I haven’t been doing anything.The door opens, and at last I stand face-to-face with my enemy and her Dauntlessguards.“Hello, Beatrice,” Jeanine says. She wears Erudite blue and Erudite spectaclesand an Erudite look of superiority that I was taught by my father to hate. “Ithought you might be the one who came.”But I don’t feel hate when I look at her. I don’t feel anything at all, eventhough I know she’s responsible for countless deaths, including Marlene’s. Thedeaths exist in my mind as a string of meaningless equations, and I standfrozen, unable to solve them.“Hello, Jeanine,” I say, because it is the only thing that comes to mind.I look from Jeanine’s watery gray eyes to the Dauntless who flank her. Peterstands at her right shoulder, and a woman with lines on either side of her mouthstands at her left. Behind her is a bald man with sharp planes in his skull. Ifrown.How does Peter find himself in such a prestigious position, as JeanineMatthews’s bodyguard? Where is the logic in that?“I’d like to know what time it is,” I say.“Would you,” she says. “That’s interesting.”I should have known she wouldn’t tell me. Every piece of information shereceives factors into her strategy, and she won’t tell me what time it is unlessshe decides that providing the information is more useful than withholding it.“I’m sure my Dauntless companions are disappointed,” she says, “that you havenot tried to claw my eyes out yet.”“That would be stupid.”“True. But in keeping with your ‘act first, think second’ behavioral trend.”“I’m sixteen.” I purse my lips. “I change.”“How refreshing.” She has a way of flattening even those phrases that shouldhave inflection built into them. “Let’s go on a little tour, shall we?”She steps back and gestures toward the doorway. The last thing I want to do iswalk out of this room and toward an uncertain destination, but I don’t hesitate.I walk out, the severe-looking Dauntless woman in front of me. Peter follows mesoon afterward.The hallway is long and pale. We turn a corner and walk down a second oneexactly like the first.Two more hallways follow. I am so disoriented I could never find my way back.But then my surroundings change—the white tunnel opens to a large room whereErudite men and women in long blue jackets stand behind tables, some holdingtools, some mixing multicolored liquids, some staring at computer screens. If Ihad to guess, I would say they are mixing simulation serum, but I hesitate toconfine Erudite’s work to simulations alone.Most of them stop to watch us as we walk down the center aisle. Or rather, theywatch me. Some of them whisper, but most remain silent. It is so quiet here.I follow the Dauntless traitor woman through a doorway, and stop so abruptlyPeter runs into me.This room is just as large as the last one, but there is only one thing in it: alarge metal table with a machine next to it. A machine I vaguely recognize as aheart monitor. And dangling above it, a camera. I shudder without meaning to.Because I know what this is.“I am very pleased that you, in particular, are here,” says Jeanine. She walkspast me and perches on the table, her fingers curled around the edge.“I am pleased, of course, because of your aptitude test results.” Her blondhair, pulled tight to her skull, reflects the light, catches my attention.“Even among the Divergent, you are somewhat of an oddity, because you haveaptitude for three factions. Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite.”“How …” My voice croaks. I push the question out. “How do you know that?”“All in good time,” she says. “From your results I have determined that you areone of the strongest Divergent, which I say not to compliment you but to explainmy purpose. If I am to develop a simulation that cannot be thwarted by theDivergent mind, I must study the strongest Divergent mind in order to shore upall weaknesses in the technology. Understand?”I don’t respond. I am still staring at the heart monitor next to the table.“Therefore, for as long as possible, my fellow scientists and I will be studyingyou.” She smiles a little. “And then, at the conclusion of my study, you will beexecuted.”I knew that. I knew it, so why do my knees feel weak, why is my stomachwrithing, why?“That execution will take place here.” She runs her fingertips over the tablebeneath her. “On this table. I thought it would be interesting to show it toyou.”She wants to study my response. I barely breathe. I used to think that crueltyrequired malice, but that is not true. Jeanine has no reason to act out ofmalice. But she is cruel because she doesn’t care what she does, as long as itfascinates her. I may as well be a puzzle or a broken machine she wants to fix.She will break open my skull just to see the inner workings of my brain; I willdie here, and that will be the merciful thing.“I knew what would happen when I came here,” I say. “It’s just a table. And I’dlike to go back to my room now.” I don’t really comprehend time’s passing, at least not in the way that I usedto, when time was available to me. So when the door opens again and Peter walksinto my cell, I don’t know how much time has gone by, only that I am exhausted.“Let’s go, Stiff,” he says.“I’m not Abnegation.” I stretch my arms above my head so they brush against thewall. “And now that you’re an Erudite lackey, you can’t call me ‘Stiff.’ It’sinaccurate.”“I said, let’s go.”“What, no snide comments?” I look up at him with mock surprise. “No ‘You’re anidiot for coming here; your brain must be deficient as well as Divergent’?”“That really goes without saying, doesn’t it?” he says. “You can either get upor I can drag you down the hallway. Your choice.”I feel calmer. Peter is always mean to me; this is familiar.I stand and walk out of the room. I notice as I walk that Peter’s arm, the one Ishot, is no longer in a sling.“Did they fix up your bullet wound?”“Yeah,” he says. “Now you’ll need to find a different weakness to exploit. Toobad I’m fresh out of them.” He grabs my good arm and walks faster, pulling mealong beside him. “We’re late.”Despite the length and emptiness of the hallway, our footsteps don’t echo much.I feel like someone put their hands over my ears and I only just noticed it. Itry to keep track of the hallways we walk down, but I lose count after a while.We reach the end of one and turn left, into a dim room that reminds me of anaquarium. One of the walls is made of one-way glass—reflective on my side, butI’m sure it’s transparent on the other side.A large machine stands on the other side, with a man-sized tray coming out ofit. I recognize it from my Faction History textbook, the unit on Erudite andmedicine. An MRI machine. It will take pictures of my brain.Something sparks inside me. It’s been so long since I felt it that I barelyrecognize it at first. Curiosity.A voice—Jeanine’s voice—speaks over an intercom.“Lie down, Beatrice.”I look at the man-sized tray that will slide me into the machine.“No.”She sighs. “If you don’t do it yourself, we have ways of making you.”Peter is standing behind me. Even with an injured arm, he was stronger than me.I imagine his hands on me, wrestling me toward the tray, shoving me against themetal, pulling the straps that dangle from the tray across my body, too tightly.“Let’s make a deal,” I say. “If I cooperate, I get to see the scan.”“You will cooperate whether you want to or not.”I hold up a finger. “That’s not true.”I look at the mirror. It’s not so difficult to pretend that I’m speaking toJeanine when I speak to my own reflection. My hair is blond like hers; we areboth pale and stern-looking. The thought is so disturbing to me that I lose mytrain of thought for a few seconds, and instead stand with my finger in the airin silence.I am pale-skinned, pale-haired, and cold. I am curious about the pictures of mybrain. I am like Jeanine. And I can either despise it, attack it, eradicate it …or I can use it.“That’s not true,” I repeat. “No matter how many restraints you use, you can’tkeep me as still as I need to be for the pictures to be clear.” I clear mythroat. “I want to see the scans. You’re going to kill me anyway, so does itreally matter how much I know about my own brain before you do?”Silence.“Why do you want to see them so badly?” she says.“Surely you, of all people, understand. I have equal aptitude for Erudite as Ido for Dauntless and Abnegation, after all.”“All right. You can see them. Lie down.”I walk over to the tray and lie down. The metal feels like ice. The tray slidesback, and I am inside the machine. I stare up at whiteness. When I was young, Ithought that was what heaven would be like, all white light and nothing else.Now I know that can’t be true, because white light is menacing.I hear thumping, and I close my eyes as I remember one of the obstacles in myfear landscape, the fists pounding against my windows and the sightless mentrying to kidnap me. I pretend the pounding is a heartbeat, a drumbeat. Theriver crashing against the walls of the chasm in the Dauntless compound. Feetstamping at the end-of-initiation ceremony. Feet pounding on the staircase afterthe Choosing Ceremony.I don’t know how much time has passed when the thumping stops and the trayslides back. I sit up and rub my neck with my fingertips.The door opens, revealing Peter in the hallway. He beckons to me. “Come on. Youcan go see the scans now.”I hop down from the tray and walk toward him. When we’re in the hallway, heshakes his head at me.“What?”“I don’t know how you manage to always get what you want.”“Yeah, because I wanted to get myself into a cell in Erudite headquarters. Iwanted to be executed.”I sound cavalier, like executions are something I face on a regular basis. Butforming my lips around the word “executed” makes me shudder. I pretend I’m cold,squeezing my arms with my hands.“Didn’t you, though?” he says. “I mean, you did come here of your own free will.That’s not what I call a good survival instinct.”He types in a series of numbers on a keypad outside the next door, and it opens.I enter the room on the other side of the mirror. It’s full of screens andlight, reflecting off the glass in the Erudites’ spectacles. Across the room,another door clicks shut. There is an empty chair behind one of the screens,still turning. Someone just left.Peter stands too close behind me—ready to grab me if I decide to attack anyone.But I won’t attack anyone. How far could I get if I did? Down one hallway, ortwo? And then I would be lost. I couldn’t get out of here even if there weren’tguards stopping me from leaving.“Put them up there,” says Jeanine, pointing toward the large screen on the leftwall. One of the Erudite scientists taps his own computer screen, and an imageappears on the left wall. An image of my brain.I don’t know what I’m looking at, exactly. I know what a brain looks like, andgenerally what each region of it does, but I don’t know how mine compares toothers. Jeanine taps her chin and stares for what feels like a long time.Finally she says, “Someone instruct Ms. Prior as to what the prefrontal cortexdoes.”“It’s the region of the brain behind the forehead, so to speak,” one of thescientists says. She doesn’t look much older than I am, and wears large roundglasses that make her eyes look bigger. “It’s responsible for organizing yourthoughts and actions to attain your goals.”“Correct,” Jeanine says. “Now someone tell me what they observe about Ms.Prior’s lateral prefrontal cortex.”“It’s large,” another scientist—this one a man with thinning hair—says.“Specificity,” says Jeanine. Like she’s chastising him.I am in a classroom, I realize, because every room with more than one Erudite init is a classroom. And among them, Jeanine is their most valued teacher. Theyall stare at her with wide eyes and eager, open mouths, waiting to impress her.“It’s much larger than average,” the man with thinning hair corrects himself.“Better.” Jeanine tilts her head. “In fact, it is one of the largest lateralprefrontal cortexes I’ve ever seen. Yet the orbitofrontal cortex is remarkablysmall. What do these two facts indicate?”“The orbitofrontal cortex is the reward center of the brain. Those who exhibitreward-seeking behavior have a large orbitofrontal cortex,” someone says. “Thatmeans that Ms. Prior engages in very little reward-seeking behavior.”“Not just that.” Jeanine smiles a little. Blue light from the screens makes hercheekbones and forehead brighter but casts shadows in her eye sockets. “It doesnot merely indicate something about her behavior, but about her desires. She isnot reward motivated. Yet she is extremely good at directing her thoughts andactions toward her goals. This explains both her tendency towardharmful-but-selfless behavior and, perhaps, her ability to wriggle out ofsimulations. How does this change our approach to the new simulation serum?”“It should suppress some, but not all, of the activity in the prefrontalcortex,” the scientist with the round glasses says.“Precisely,” says Jeanine. She finally looks at me, her eyes gleaming withdelight. “Then that is how we will proceed. Did this satisfy my end of ouragreement, Ms. Prior?”My mouth is dry, so it’s difficult to swallow.And what happens if they suppress the activity in my prefrontal cortex—if theydamage my ability to make decisions? What if this serum works, and I become aslave to the simulations like everyone else? What if I forget reality entirely?I did not know that my entire personality, my entire being, could be discardedas the byproduct of my anatomy. What if I really am just someone with a largeprefrontal cortex … and nothing more?“Yes,” I say. “It did.” In silence Peter and I make our way back to my room. We turn left, and a groupof people stands at the other end of the hallway. It is the longest of thecorridors we will travel through, but that distance shrinks when I see him.Held at either arm by a Dauntless traitor, a gun aimed at the back of his skull.Tobias, blood trailing down the side of his face and marking his white shirtwith red; Tobias, fellow Divergent, standing in the mouth of this furnace inwhich I will burn.Peter’s hands clamp around my shoulders, holding me in place.“Tobias,” I say, and it sounds like a gasp.The Dauntless traitor with the gun presses Tobias toward me. Peter tries to pushme forward too, but my feet remain planted. I came here so that no one elsewould die. I came here to protect as many people as I could. And I care moreabout Tobias’s safety than anyone else’s. So why am I here, if he’s here? What’sthe point?“What did you do?” I mumble. He is just a few feet away from me now, but notclose enough to hear me. As he passes me he stretches out his hand. He wraps itaround my palm and squeezes. Squeezes, then lets go. His eyes are bloodshot; heis pale.“What did you do?” This time the question tears from my throat like a growl.I throw myself toward him, struggling against Peter’s grip, though his handschafe.“What did you do?” I scream.“You die, I die too.” Tobias looks over his shoulder at me. “I asked you not todo this. You made your decision. These are the repercussions.”He disappears around the corner. The last I see of him and the Dauntlesstraitors leading him is the gleam of the gun barrel and blood on the back of hisearlobe from an injury I didn’t see before.All the life goes out of me as soon as he’s gone. I stop struggling and letPeter’s hands push me toward my cell. I slump to the ground as soon as I walkin, waiting for the door to slide shut to signify Peter’s departure, but itdoesn’t.“Why did he come here?” Peter says.I glance at him.“Because he’s an idiot.”“Well, yeah.”I rest my head against the wall.“Did he think he could rescue you?” Peter snorts a little. “Sounds like aStiff-born thing to do.”“I don’t think so,” I say. If Tobias intended to rescue me, he would havethought it through; he would have brought others. He would not have burst intoErudite headquarters alone.Tears well up in my eyes, and I don’t try to blink them away. Instead I starethrough them and watch my surroundings smear together. A few days ago I wouldnever have cried in front of Peter, but I don’t care anymore. He is the least ofall my enemies.“I think he came to die with me,” I say. I clamp my hand over my mouth to stiflea sob. If I can keep breathing, I can stop crying. I didn’t need or want him todie with me. I wanted to keep him safe. What an idiot, I think, but my heartisn’t in it.“That’s ridiculous,” he says. “That doesn’t make any sense. He’s eighteen; he’llfind another girlfriend once you’re dead. And he’s stupid if he doesn’t knowthat.”Tears run down my cheeks, hot at first and then cold. I close my eyes. “If youthink that’s what it’s about …” I swallow another sob. “… you’re the stupidone.”“Yeah. Whatever.”His shoes squeak as he turns away. About to leave.“Wait!” I look up at his blurry silhouette, unable to make out his face. “Whatwill they do to him? The same thing they’re doing to me?”“I don’t know.”“Can you find out?” I wipe my cheeks with the heels of my hands, frustrated.“Can you at least find out if he’s all right?”He says, “Why would I do that? Why would I do anything for you?”A moment later I hear the door slide shut."},{"pageContent":"[images/00035.jpg]I READ SOMEWHERE, once, that crying defies scientific explanation. Tears areonly meant to lubricate the eyes. There is no real reason for tear glands tooverproduce tears at the behest of emotion.I think we cry to release the animal parts of us without losing our humanity.Because inside me is a beast that snarls, and growls, and strains towardfreedom, toward Tobias, and, above all, toward life. And as hard as I try, Icannot kill it.So I sob into my hands instead. Left, right, right. Left, right, left. Right, right. Our turns, in order, fromour point of origin—my cell—to our destination.It is a new room. In it is a partially reclined chair, like a dentist’s chair.In one corner is a screen and a desk. Jeanine sits at the desk.“Where is he?” I say.I have been waiting for hours to ask that question. I fell asleep and dreamedthat I was chasing Tobias through Dauntless headquarters. No matter how fast Iran he was always just far enough ahead of me that I watched him disappeararound corners, catching sight of a sleeve or the heel of a shoe.Jeanine gives me a puzzled look. But she is not puzzled. She is playing with me.“Tobias,” I say anyway. My hands shake, but not from fear this time—from anger.“Where is he? What are you doing to him?”“I see no reason to provide that information,” says Jeanine. “And since you areall out of leverage, I see no way for you to give me a reason, unless you wouldlike to change the terms of our agreement.”I want to scream at her that of course, of course I would rather know aboutTobias than about my Divergence, but I don’t. I can’t make hasty decisions. Shewill do what she intends to do to Tobias whether I know about it or not. It ismore important that I fully understand what is happening to me.I breathe in through my nose, and out through my nose. I shake my hands. I sitdown in the chair.“Interesting,” she says.“Aren’t you supposed to be running a faction and planning a war?” I say. “Whatare you doing here, running tests on a sixteen-year-old girl?”“You choose different ways of referring to yourself depending on what isconvenient,” she says, leaning back in her chair. “Sometimes you insist that youare not a little girl, and sometimes you insist that you are. What I am curiousto know is: How do you really view yourself? As one or the other? As both? Asneither?”I make my voice flat and factual, like hers. “I see no reason to provide thatinformation.”I hear a faint snort. Peter is covering his mouth. Jeanine glares at him, andhis laughter effortlessly transforms into a coughing fit.“Mockery is childish, Beatrice,” she says. “It does not become you.”“Mockery is childish, Beatrice,” I repeat in my best imitation of her voice. “Itdoes not become you.”“The serum,” Jeanine says, eyeing Peter. He steps forward and fumbles with ablack box on the desk, taking out a syringe with a needle already attached toit.Peter starts toward me, and I hold out my hand.“Allow me,” I say.He looks at Jeanine for permission, and she says, “All right, then.” He hands methe syringe and I shove the needle into the side of my neck, pressing down onthe plunger. Jeanine jabs one of the buttons with her finger, and everythinggoes dark. My mother stands in the aisle with her arm stretched above her head so she canhold the bar. Her face is turned, not toward the people sitting around me, buttoward the city we pass as the bus lurches forward. I see wrinkles in herforehead and around her mouth when she frowns.“What is it?” I ask her.“There is so much to be done,” she says with a small gesture toward the buswindows. “And so few of us left to do it.”It is clear what she’s referring to. Beyond the bus is rubble as far as I cansee. Across the street, a building lies in ruins. Fragments of glass litter thealleyways. I wonder what caused so much destruction.“Where are we going?” I say.She smiles at me, and I see different wrinkles than before, at the corners ofher eyes. “We’re going to Erudite headquarters.”I frown. Most of my life has been spent avoiding Erudite headquarters. My fatherused to say that he didn’t even like to breathe the air in there. “Why are wegoing there?”“They’re going to help us.”Why do I feel a pang in my stomach when I think of my father? I picture hisface, weathered by a lifetime of frustration with the world around him, and hishair, kept short by Abnegation standard practice, and feel the same kind of painin my stomach that I get when I have not eaten in too long—a hollow pain.“Did something happen to Dad?” I say.She shakes her head. “Why would you ask that?”“I don’t know.”I don’t feel the pain when I look at my mother. But I do feel like every secondwe spend standing these inches apart is one that I must impress upon my minduntil my entire memory conforms to its shape. But if she is not permanent, whatis she?The bus stops, and the doors creak open. My mother starts down the aisle, and Ifollow her. She is taller than I am, so I stare between her shoulders, at thetop of her spine. She looks fragile, but she is not.I step down onto the pavement. Pieces of glass crinkle beneath my feet. They areblue and, judging by the holes in the building to my right, used to be windows.“What happened?”“War,” my mother says. “This is what we’ve been trying so hard to avoid.”“And the Erudite will help us … by doing what?”“I worry that all your father’s blustering about Erudite has been to yourdetriment,” she says gently. “They’ve made mistakes, of course, but they, likeeveryone else, are a blend of good and bad, not one or the other. What would wedo without our doctors, our scientists, our teachers?”She smooths down my hair.“Take care to remember that, Beatrice.”“I will,” I promise.We keep walking. But something about what she said bothers me. Is it what shesaid about my father? No—my father is always complaining about Erudite. Is itwhat she said about Erudite? I hop over a large shard of glass. No, that can’tbe it. She was right about Erudite. All my teachers were Erudite, and so was thedoctor who set my mother’s arm when she broke it several years ago.It’s the last part. “Take care to remember.” As if she won’t have theopportunity to remind me later.I feel something shift in my mind, like something that was closed has justopened.“Mom?” I say.She looks back at me. A lock of blond hair falls from its knot and touches hercheek.“I love you.”I point at a window to my left, and it explodes. Particles of glass rain overus.I don’t want to wake up in a room in Erudite headquarters, so I don’t open myeyes right away, not even when the simulation fades. I try to preserve the imageof my mother and the hair sticking to her cheekbone for as long as I can. Butwhen all I see is the redness of my own eyelids, I open them.“You’ll have to do better than that,” I say to Jeanine.She says, “That was only the beginning.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00011.jpg]THAT NIGHT I dream, not of Tobias, and not of Will, but of my mother. We standin the Amity orchards, where the apples are ripe and dangle just inches aboveour heads. Leaf shadows pattern her face, and she wears black, though I neversaw her in black when she was alive. She is teaching me to braid hair,demonstrating on a lock of her own, laughing when my fingers fumble.I wake wondering how I did not notice, every day I sat across from her at thebreakfast table, that she was full to bursting with Dauntless energy. Was itbecause she hid it well? Or was it because I wasn’t looking?I bury my face in the thin mattress I slept on. I will never know her. But atleast she will never know what I did to Will, either. At this point I don’tthink I could bear it if she did.I am still blinking the haze of sleep from my eyes when I follow Peter down thecorridor, seconds or minutes later, I can’t tell.“Peter.” My throat aches; I must have screamed while I slept. “What time is it?”He wears a watch, but the face is covered, so I can’t see it. He doesn’t evenbother to look at it.“Why are you constantly escorting me places?” I say. “Isn’t there a depravedactivity you’re supposed to be taking part in? Kicking puppies or spying ongirls while they change, or something?”“I know what you did to Will, you know. Don’t pretend that you’re better than Iam, because you and I, we’re exactly the same.”The only thing that distinguishes one hallway from another, here, is theirlength. I decide to label them according to how many steps I take before I turn.Ten. Forty-seven. Twenty-nine.“You’re wrong,” I say. “We may both be bad, but there’s a huge differencebetween us—I’m not content with being this way.”Peter snorts a little, and we walk between the Erudite lab tables. That’s when Irealize where I am, and where we’re going: back to the room Jeanine showed me.The room where I will be executed. I shudder so hard my teeth chatter, and it’sdifficult to keep walking, hard to keep my thoughts straight. It’s just a room,I tell myself. Just a room like any other room.I am such a liar.This time the execution chamber is not empty. Four Dauntless traitors millaround in one corner, and two of the Erudite, one a dark-skinned woman, one anolder man, both wearing lab coats, stand with Jeanine near the metal table inthe center. Several machines are set up around it, and there are wireseverywhere.I don’t know what most of those machines do, but among them is a heart monitor.What does Jeanine plan to do that requires a heart monitor?“Get her on the table,” says Jeanine, sounding bored. I stare for a second atthe sheet of steel that awaits me. What if she changed her mind about waiting toexecute me? What if this is when I die? Peter’s hands clamp around my arms and Iwrithe, throwing all my strength into the struggle.But he just lifts me up, dodging my kicking feet, and slams me down on the metalslab, knocking the wind out of me. I gasp, and fling a fist out at whatever Ican hit, which just happens to be Peter’s wrist. He winces, but by now the otherDauntless traitors have come forward to help.One of them holds down my ankles, and the other holds down my shoulders as Peterpulls black straps across my body to keep me pinned. I flinch at the pain in mywounded shoulder and stop struggling.“What the hell is going on?” I demand, craning my neck to look at Jeanine. “Weagreed—cooperation in exchange for results! We agreed—”“This is entirely separate from our agreement,” says Jeanine, glancing at herwatch. “This is not about you, Beatrice.”The door opens again.Tobias walks in—limps in—flanked by Dauntless traitors. His face is bruised andthere’s a cut above his eyebrow. He does not move with his usual care; he’sholding himself perfectly straight. He must be injured. I try not to think abouthow he got that way.“What is this?” he says, his voice rough and creaky.From screaming, probably.My throat feels swollen.“Tris,” he says, and he lurches toward me, but the Dauntless traitors are tooquick. They grab him before he can move more than a few steps. “Tris, are youokay?”“Yeah,” I say. “Are you?”He nods. I don’t believe him.“Rather than waste any more time, Mr. Eaton, I thought I would take the mostlogical approach. Truth serum would be preferable, of course, but it would takedays to coerce Jack Kang into handing some over, as it is jealously guarded bythe Candor, and I’d rather not waste a few days.” She steps forward, a syringein hand. This serum is tinted gray. It could be a new version of the simulationserum, but I doubt it.I wonder what it does. It can’t be good, if she looks this pleased with herself.“In a few seconds, I will inject Tris with this liquid. At that point, I trust,your selfless instincts will take over and you will tell me exactly what I needto know.”“What does she need to know?” I say, interrupting her.“Information about the factionless safe houses,” he replies without looking atme.My eyes widen. The factionless are the last hope any of us has, now that halfthe loyal Dauntless and all the Candor are simulation-ready, and half theAbnegation are dead.“Don’t give it to her. I’m going to die anyway. Don’t give her anything.”“Remind me, Mr. Eaton,” says Jeanine. “What do Dauntless simulations do?”“This isn’t a classroom,” he replies through gritted teeth. “Tell me what you’regoing to do.”“I will if you answer my very simple question.”“Fine.” Tobias’s eyes shift to me. “The simulations stimulate the amygdala,which is responsible for processing fear, induce a hallucination based on thatfear, and then transmit the data to a computer to be processed and observed.”It sounds like he’s had that memorized for a long time. Maybe he has—he didspend a lot of time running simulations.“Very good,” she says. “When I was developing the Dauntless simulations, yearsago, we discovered that certain levels of potency overwhelmed the brain and madeit too insensible with terror to invent new surroundings, which was when wediluted the solution so that the simulations would be more instructive. But Istill remember how to make it.”She taps the syringe with her fingernail.“Fear,” she says, “is more powerful than pain. So is there anything you’d liketo say, before I inject Ms. Prior?”Tobias presses his lips together.And Jeanine inserts the needle. It begins quietly, with the pounding of a heart. I am not sure, at first, whoseheartbeat I’m hearing, because it’s far too loud to be my own. But then Irealize that it is my own, and it’s getting faster and faster.Sweat collects in my palms and behind my knees.And then I have to gasp in order to breathe.That’s when the screaming startsAnd ICan’tThink. Tobias is fighting the Dauntless traitors by the door.I hear what sounds like a child’s scream beside me, and wrench my head around tosee where it’s coming from, but there is only a heart monitor. Above me thelines between the ceiling tiles warp and twist into monstrous creatures. Thescent of rotting flesh fills the air and I gag. The monstrous creatures take ona more definite shape—they are birds, crows, with beaks as long as my forearmand wings so dark they seem to swallow all the light.“Tris,” says Tobias. I look away from the crows.He stands by the door, where he was before I was injected, but now he has aknife. He holds it out from his body and turns it so the blade points in, at hisstomach. Then he brings it toward himself, touching the tip of the blade to hisstomach.“What are you doing? Stop!”He smiles a little and says, “I’m doing this for you.”He pushes the knife in farther, slow, and blood stains the hem of his shirt. Igag, and throw myself against the bonds holding me to the table. “No, stop!” Ithrash and in a simulation I would have pulled free by now so this must meanthat this is real, it’s real. I scream and he sticks the knife in to the handle.He collapses to the floor and his blood spills fast and surrounds him. Theshadow-birds turn their beady eyes on him and swarm in a tornado of wings andtalons, pecking at his skin. I see his eyes through the whirling feathers and heis still awake.A bird lands on the fingers that hold the knife. He draws it out again and itclatters to the ground and I should hope that he is dead but I’m selfish so Ican’t. My back lifts from the table and all my muscles clench and my throataches from this scream that no longer shapes itself into words and will notstop. “Sedative,” a stern voice commands.Another needle in my neck, and my heart begins to slow down. I sob with relief.For seconds all I can do is sob with relief.That was not fear. That was something else; an emotion that should not exist.“Let me go,” Tobias says, and he sounds scratchier than before. I blink fast soI can see him through my tears. There are red marks on his arms from where theDauntless traitors held him back, but he is not dying; he is all right. “That’sthe only way I’ll tell you, is if you let me go.”Jeanine nods, and he runs to me. He wraps one hand around mine and touches myhair with the other. His fingertips come away wet with tears. He doesn’t wipethem off. He leans over and presses his forehead to mine.“The factionless safe houses,” he says dully, right against my cheek. “Get me amap and I’ll mark them for you.”His forehead feels cool and dry against mine. My muscles ache, probably frombeing clenched for however long Jeanine left me with that serum pulsing throughme.He pulls back, his fingers wrapped around my fingers for as long as they can beuntil the Dauntless traitors pull him from my grasp to escort him elsewhere. Myhand falls heavy on the table. I don’t want to struggle against the restraintsanymore. All I want to do is sleep.“While you’re here …” Jeanine says once Tobias and his escorts are gone. Shelooks up and focuses her watery eyes on one of the Erudite. “Get him and bringhim in here. It’s time.”She looks back down at me.“While you sleep, we will be performing a short procedure to observe a fewthings about your brain. It will not be invasive. But before that … I promisedyou full transparency with these procedures. So I feel it’s only fair that youknow exactly who has been assisting me in my endeavors.” She smiles a little.“Who told me what three factions you had an aptitude for, and what our bestchance was to get you to come here, and to put your mother in the lastsimulation to make it more effective.”She looks toward the doorway as the sedative sets in, making everything blur atthe edges. I look over my shoulder, and through the haze of drugs I see him.Caleb."},{"pageContent":"[images/00013.jpg]I WAKE TO a headache. I try to go back to sleep—at least when I’m asleep, I’mcalm—but the image of Caleb standing in the doorway runs through my mind overand over again, accompanied by the sound of squawking crows.Why did I never wonder how Eric and Jeanine knew that I had aptitude for threefactions?Why did it never occur to me that only three people in the world knew thatparticular fact: Tori, Caleb, and Tobias?My head pounds. I can’t make sense of it. I don’t know why Caleb would betrayme. I wonder when it happened—after the attack simulation? After the escape fromAmity? Or was it earlier than that—was it back when my father was still alive?Caleb told us he left Erudite when he found out what they were planning—was helying?He must have been. I press the heel of my hand to my forehead. My brother chosefaction over blood. There has to be a reason. She must have threatened him. Orcoerced him in some way.The door opens. I don’t lift my head or open my eyes.“Stiff.” It’s Peter. Of course.“Yes.” When I let my hand fall from my face, a lock of hair falls with it. Ilook at it from the corner of my eye. My hair has never been this greasy before.Peter sets a bottle of water next to the bed, and a sandwich. The thought ofeating it nauseates me.“You brain-dead?” he asks.“Don’t think so.”“Don’t be so sure.”“Ha-ha,” I say. “How long have I been asleep?”“About a day. I’m supposed to escort you to the showers.”“If you say something about how badly I need one,” I say tiredly, “I will pokeyou in the eye.”The room spins when I lift my head, but I manage to put my legs over the edge ofthe bed and stand. Peter and I start down the hallway. When we turn the cornerto get to the bathroom, though, there are people at the end of the hallway.One of them is Tobias. I can see where our paths will intersect, between where Istand now and my cell door. I stare, not at him but at where he will be when hereaches for my hand, as he did the last time we passed each other. My skintingles with anticipation. For just a moment, I will touch him again.Six steps until we pass each other. Five steps.At four steps, though, Tobias stops. His entire body goes limp, catching hisDauntless traitor escort off guard. The guard loses his grip on him for just asecond, and Tobias crumples to the floor.Then he twists around. Lurches forward. And grabs a gun from the shorterDauntless traitor’s holster.The gun goes off. Peter dives to the right, dragging me with him. My head skimsthe wall. The Dauntless guard’s mouth is open—he must be screaming. I can’t hearhim.Tobias kicks him hard in the stomach. The Dauntless in me admires hisform—perfect—and his speed—incredible. Then he turns, training the gun on Peter.But Peter has already released me.Tobias reaches for my left arm, helps me to my feet, and starts running. Istumble after him. Each time my foot hits the ground, pain slices into my head,but I can’t stop. I blink tears from my eyes. Run, I tell myself, as if thatwill make it easier. Tobias’s hand is rough and strong. I let it guide me arounda corner.“Tobias,” I wheeze.He stops, and looks back at me. “Oh no,” he says, brushing my cheek with hisfingers. “Come on. On my back.”He bends, and I put my arms around his neck, burying my face between hisshoulder blades. He lifts me without difficulty and holds on to my leg with hisleft hand. His right hand still holds the gun.He runs, and even with my weight, he is fast. Idly I think, How could he everhave been Abnegation? He seems designed specifically for speed and deadlyaccuracy. But not strength, not particularly—he is smart, but not strong. Onlystrong enough to carry me.The hallways are empty now, but not for long. Soon every Dauntless in thebuilding will rush toward us from every angle, and we will be trapped in thispale maze. I wonder how Tobias plans to get past them.I lift my head long enough to see that he just ran past an exit.“Tobias, you missed it.”“Missed … what?” he says between breaths.“An exit.”“Not trying to escape. We’d get shot if we did,” he says. “Trying to … findsomething.”I would suspect that I’m dreaming if the pain in my head wasn’t so intense.Usually only my dreams make this little sense. Why, if he was not trying toescape, did he take me with him? And what is he doing, if not escaping?He stops abruptly, almost dropping me, as he reaches a wide hallway with panesof glass on either side, revealing offices. The Erudite sit frozen at theirdesks, staring at us. Tobias pays no attention to them; his eyes, as far as Ican tell, are fixed on the door at the end of the corridor. A sign outside thedoor says CONTROL-A.Tobias searches every corner of the room, and then shoots at the camera attachedto the ceiling on our right. The camera drops. He shoots at the camera attachedto the ceiling on our left. Its lens shatters.“Time to get down,” he says. “No more running, I promise.”I slide off his back and take his hand instead. He walks toward a closed doorthat we passed already, and into a supply closet. He shuts the door and wedges abusted chair under the doorknob. I face him, a shelf stacked with paper at myback. Above us, the blue light flickers. His eyes roam over my face almosthungrily.“I don’t have much time, so I’m going to be direct,” he says.I nod.“I didn’t come here on some suicide mission,” he says. “I came for two reasons.The first was to find Erudite’s two central control rooms so that when weinvade, we’ll know what to destroy first to get rid of all the simulation data,so she can’t activate the Dauntless’s transmitters.”That explains the running without escaping. And we found a control room, at theend of that hallway.I stare at him, still dazed from the past few minutes.“The second,” he says, clearing his throat, “is to make sure you hold on,because we have a plan.”“What plan?”“According to one of our insiders, your execution is tentatively scheduled fortwo weeks from today,” he says. “At least, that’s Jeanine’s target date for thenew, Divergent-proof simulation. So fourteen days from now, the factionless, theloyal Dauntless, and the Abnegation who are willing to fight will storm theErudite compound and take out their best weapon—their computer system. Thatmeans we’ll outnumber the traitor Dauntless, and therefore the Erudite.”“But you told Jeanine where the factionless safe houses were.”“Yeah.” He frowns a little. “That is problematic. But as you and I know, a lotof the factionless are Divergent, and many of them were already moving towardthe Abnegation sector when I left, so only some of the safe houses will beaffected. So they will still have a huge population to contribute to theinvasion.”Two weeks. Will I be able to make it through two weeks of this? I am already sotired I’m finding it difficult to stand on my own. Even the rescue that Tobiasis proposing barely appeals to me. I don’t want freedom. I want sleep. I wantthis to end.“I don’t …” I choke on the words and start to cry. “I can’t … make it … thatlong.”“Tris,” he says sternly. He never coddles me. I wish that, just this once, hewould coddle me. “You have to. You have to survive this.”“Why?” The question forms in my stomach and launches from my throat like a moan.I feel like thumping my fists against his chest, like a child throwing atantrum. Tears cover my cheeks, and I know I’m acting ridiculous but I can’tstop. “Why do I have to? Why can’t someone else do something for once? What if Idon’t want to do this anymore?”And what this is, I realize, is life. I don’t want it. I want my parents and Ihave for weeks. I’ve been trying to claw my way back to them, and now I am soclose and he is telling me not to.“I know.” I have never heard his voice sound so soft. “I know it’s hard. Thehardest thing you’ve had to do.”I shake my head.“I can’t force you. I can’t make you want to survive this.” He pulls me againsthim and runs his hand over my hair, tucking it behind my ear. His fingers traildown my neck and over my shoulder, and he says, “But you will do it. It doesn’tmatter if you believe you can or not. You will, because that’s who you are.”I pull back and fit my mouth to his, not gently, not hesitantly. I kiss him likeI used to, when I felt sure of us, and run my hands over his back, down hisarms, like I used to.I don’t want to tell him the truth: that he is wrong, and I do not want tosurvive this.The door opens. Dauntless traitors crowd into the supply closet. Tobias stepsback, turns the gun in his hand, and offers it, handle first, to the nearestDauntless traitor."},{"pageContent":"[images/00014.jpg]“BEATRICE.”I jerk awake. The room I am in now—for whatever experiment they want to run onme—is large, with screens along the back wall and blue lights glowing just abovethe floor and rows of padded benches across the middle. I’m sitting on thefarthest bench back with Peter at my left shoulder, my head leaning against thewall. I still can’t seem to get enough sleep.Now I wish I hadn’t woken up. Caleb stands a few feet away, his weight on onefoot, an uncertain posture.“Did you ever leave Erudite?” I say.“It’s not that simple,” he starts. “I—”“It is that simple.” I want to yell, but instead my voice comes out flat. “Atwhat point did you betray our family? Before our parents died, or after?”“I did what I had to do. You think you understand this, Beatrice, but you don’t.This whole situation … it’s much bigger than you think it is.” His eyes pleadwith me to understand, but I recognize his tone—it’s the one he employed when wewere younger, to scold me. It is condescending.Arrogance is one of the flaws in the Erudite heart—I know. It is often in mine.But greed is the other. And I do not have that. So I am halfway in and halfwayout, as always.I push myself to my feet. “You still haven’t answered my question.”Caleb steps back.“This isn’t about Erudite; it’s about everyone. All the factions,” he says, “andthe city. And what’s outside the fence.”“I don’t care,” I say, but that isn’t true. The phrase “outside the fence”prickles in my brain. Outside? How could any of this have to do with what’soutside?Something itches at the back of my mind. Marcus said that information theAbnegation possessed motivated Jeanine’s attack on Abnegation. Does thatinformation have to do with what’s outside, too?I push the thought away for the time being.“I thought you were all about facts. About freedom of information? Well, howabout this fact, Caleb? When—” My voice quakes. “When did you betray ourparents?”“I have always been Erudite,” he says softly. “Even when I was supposed to beAbnegation.”“If you’re with Jeanine, then I hate you. Just like our father would have.”“Our father.” Caleb snorts a little. “Our father was Erudite, Beatrice. Jeaninetold me—he was in her year at school.”“He wasn’t Erudite,” I say after a few seconds. “He chose to leave them. Hechose a different identity, just like you, and became something else. Only youchose this … this evil.”“Spoken like a true Dauntless,” says Caleb sharply. “It’s either one way or theother way. No nuances. The world doesn’t work like that, Beatrice. Evil dependson where you’re standing.”“No matter where I stand, I’ll still think mind controlling an entire city ofpeople is evil.” I feel my lip wobble. “I’ll still think delivering your sisterto be prodded and executed is evil!”He is my brother, but I want to tear him to pieces.Instead of trying to, though, I find myself sitting down again. I could neverhurt him enough to make his betrayal stop hurting. And it hurts, in every partof my body. I press my fingers to my chest to massage some of the smartingtension away.Jeanine and her army of Erudite scientists and Dauntless traitors walk in justas I wipe tears from my cheeks. I blink rapidly so she won’t see. She barelyeven gives me a glance.“Let us view the results, shall we?” she announces. Caleb, now standing by thescreens, presses something at the front of the room, and the screens turn on.Words and numbers I don’t understand fill them.“We discovered something extremely interesting, Ms. Prior.” I have never seenher so cheerful before. She almost smiles—but not quite. “You have an abundanceof a particular kind of neuron, called, quite simply, a mirror neuron. Wouldsomeone like to explain to Ms. Prior exactly what mirror neurons do?”The Erudite scientists raise their hands in unison. She points to an older womanin the front.“Mirror neurons fire both when one performs an action and when one sees anotherperson performing that action. They allow us to imitate behavior.”“What else are they responsible for?” Jeanine scans her “class” the same way myteachers did in Upper Levels. Another Erudite raises his hand.“Learning language, understanding other people’s intentions based on theirbehavior, um …” He frowns. “And empathy.”“More specifically,” Jeanine says, and this time she does smile at me, broadly,forcing creases into her cheeks, “someone with many, strong mirror neurons couldhave a flexible personality—capable of mimicking others as the situation callsfor it rather than remaining constant.”I understand why she smiles. I feel like my mind is cracked open, its secretsspilling over the floor for me to finally see.“A flexible personality,” she says, “would probably have aptitude for more thanone faction, don’t you agree, Ms. Prior?”“Probably,” I say. “Now if only you could get a simulation to suppress thatparticular ability, we could be done with this.”“One thing at a time.” She pauses. “I must admit, it confuses me that you are soeager for your own execution.”“No, it doesn’t.” I close my eyes. “It doesn’t confuse you at all.” I sigh. “CanI go back to my cell now?”I must seem nonchalant, but I’m not. I want to go back to my room so that I cancry in peace. But I don’t want her to know that.“Don’t get too comfortable,” she chirps. “We’ll have a simulation serum to tryout soon.”“Yeah,” I say. “Whatever.” Someone shakes my shoulder. I jerk awake, my eyes wide and searching, and I seeTobias kneeling over me. He wears a Dauntless traitor jacket, and one side ofhis head is coated with blood. The blood streams from a wound on his ear—the topof his ear is gone. I wince.“What happened?” I say.“Get up. We have to run.”“It’s too soon. It hasn’t been two weeks.”“I don’t have time to explain. Come on.”“Oh God. Tobias.”I sit up and wrap my arms around him, pressing my face into his neck. His armstighten around me and squeeze. Warmth courses through me, and comfort. If he ishere, that means I’m safe. My tears make his skin slippery.He stands and pulls me to my feet, which makes my wounded shoulder throb.“Reinforcements will be here soon. Come on.”I let him lead me out of the room. We make it down the first hallway withoutdifficulty, but in the second hallway, we encounter two Dauntless guards, one ayoung man and one a middle-aged woman. Tobias fires twice in a matter ofseconds, both hits, one in the head and one in the chest. The woman, who was hitin the chest, slumps against the wall but doesn’t die.We keep moving. One hallway, then another, all of them look the same. Tobias’sgrip on my hand never falters. I know that if he can throw a knife so that ithits just the tip of my ear, he can fire accurately at the Dauntless soldierswho ambush us. We step over fallen bodies—the people Tobias killed on the wayin, probably—and finally reach a fire exit.Tobias lets go of my hand to open the door, and the fire alarm screeches in myears, but we keep running. I am gasping for air but I don’t care, not when I’mfinally escaping, not when this nightmare is finally over. My vision starts togo black at the edges, so I grab Tobias’s arm and hold on tight, trusting him tolead me safely to the bottom of the stairs.I run out of steps to run down, and I open my eyes. Tobias is about to open theexit door, but I hold him back. “Got to … catch my breath….”He pauses, and I put my hands on my knees, leaning over. My shoulder stillthrobs. I frown, and look up at him.“Come on, let’s get out of here,” he says insistently.My stomach sinks. I stare into his eyes. They are dark blue, with a patch oflight blue on his right iris.I take his chin in hand and pull his lips down to mine, kissing him slowly,sighing as I pull back.“We can’t get out of here,” I say. “Because this is a simulation.”He pulled me to my feet with my right hand. The real Tobias would haveremembered the wound in my shoulder.“What?” He scowls at me. “Don’t you think I would know if I was under asimulation?”“You aren’t under a simulation. You are the simulation.” I look up and say in aloud voice, “You’ll have to do better than that, Jeanine.”All I have to do now is wake up, and I know how—I have done it before, in myfear landscape, when I broke a glass tank just by touching my palm to it, orwhen I made a gun appear in the grass to shoot descending birds. I take a knifefrom my pocket—a knife that wasn’t there a moment ago—and will my leg to be hardas diamond.I thrust the knife toward my thigh, and the blade bends. I wake with tears in my eyes. I wake to Jeanine’s scream of frustration.“What is it?” She grabs Peter’s gun out of his hand and stalks across the room,pressing the barrel to my forehead. My body stiffens, goes cold. She won’t shootme. I am a problem she can’t solve. She won’t shoot me.“What is it that clues you in? Tell me. Tell me or I will kill you.”I slowly push myself up from the chair, coming to my feet, pushing my skinharder into the cold barrel.“You think I’m going to tell you?” I say. “You think I believe that you wouldkill me without figuring out the answer to this question?”“You stupid girl,” she says. “You think this is about you, and your abnormalbrain? This is not about you. It is not about me. It is about keeping this citysafe from the people who intend to plunge it into hell!”I summon the last of my strength and launch myself at her, clawing at whateverskin my fingernails find, digging in as hard as I can. She screams at the top ofher lungs, a sound that turns my blood into fire. I punch her hard in the face.A pair of arms wrap around me, pulling me off her, and a fist meets my side. Igroan, and lunge toward her, held at bay by Peter.“Pain can’t make me tell you. Truth serum can’t make me tell you. Simulationscan’t make me tell you. I’m immune to all three.”Her nose is bleeding, and I see lines of fingernail scrapes in her cheeks, onthe side of her throat, turning red with blossoming blood. She glares at me,pinching her nose closed, her hair disheveled, her free hand trembling.“You have failed. You can’t control me!” I scream, so loud it hurts my throat. Istop struggling and sag against Peter’s chest. “You will never be able tocontrol me.”I laugh, mirthless, a mad laugh. I savor the scowl on her face, the hate in hereyes. She was like a machine; she was cold and emotionless, bound by logicalone. And I broke her.I broke her."},{"pageContent":"[images/00016.jpg]ONCE I’M IN the hallway, I stop struggling toward Jeanine. My side throbs fromwhere Peter punched me, but it’s nothing compared to the pulse of triumph in mycheeks.Peter walks me back to my cell without a word. I stand in the middle of the roomfor a long time, staring at the camera in the back-left corner. Who is watchingme all the time? Is it Dauntless traitors, guarding me, or the Erudite,observing me?Once the heat leaves my face and my side stops hurting, I lie down.A picture of my parents floats into my head the moment I close my eyes. Once,when I was about eleven, I stopped at the doorway to my parents’ bedroom towatch them make the bed together. My father smiled at my mother as they pulledthe sheets back and smoothed them down in perfect synchronicity. I knew by theway he looked at her that he held her in a higher regard than he held evenhimself.No selfishness or insecurity kept him from seeing the full extent of hergoodness, as it so often does with the rest of us. That kind of love may only bepossible in Abnegation. I do not know.My father: Erudite-born, Abnegation-grown. He often found it difficult to liveup to the demands of his chosen faction, just as I did. But he tried, and heknew true selflessness when he saw it.I clutch my pillow to my chest and bury my face in it. I don’t cry. I just ache.Grief is not as heavy as guilt, but it takes more away from you. “Stiff.”I wake with a start, my hands still clutching the pillow. There is a wet patchon the mattress under my face. I sit up, wiping my eyes with my fingertips.Peter’s eyebrows, which usually turn up in the middle, are furrowed.“What happened?” Whatever it is, it can’t be good.“Your execution has been scheduled for tomorrow morning at eight o’clock.”“My execution? But she … she hasn’t developed the right simulation yet; shecouldn’t possibly …”“She said that she will continue the experiments on Tobias instead of you,” hesays.All I can say is: “Oh.”I clutch the mattress and rock forward and back, forward and back. Tomorrow mylife will be over. Tobias may survive long enough to escape in the factionlessinvasion. The Dauntless will elect a new leader. All the loose ends I will leavewill be easily tied up.I nod. No family left, no loose ends, no great loss.“I could have forgiven you, you know,” I say. “For trying to kill me duringinitiation. I probably could have.”We are both quiet for a while. I don’t know why I told him that. Maybe justbecause it’s true, and tonight, of all nights, is the time for honesty. TonightI will be honest, and selfless, and brave. Divergent.“I never asked you to,” he says, and turns to leave. But then he stops at thedoor frame and says, “It’s 9:24.”Telling me the time is a small act of betrayal—and therefore an ordinary act ofbravery. It is maybe the first time I’ve seen Peter be truly Dauntless. I’m going to die tomorrow. It has been a long time since I felt certainty aboutanything, so this feels like a gift. Tonight, nothing. Tomorrow, whatever comesafter life. And Jeanine still doesn’t know how to control the Divergent.When I start to cry, I clutch the pillow to my chest and let it happen. I cryhard, like a child cries, until my face is hot and I feel like I might be sick.I can pretend to be brave, but I’m not.I suppose that now would be the time to ask for forgiveness for all the thingsI’ve done, but I’m sure my list would never be complete. I also don’t believethat whatever comes after life depends on my correctly reciting a list of mytransgressions—that sounds too much like an Erudite afterlife to me, allaccuracy and no feeling. I don’t believe that what comes after depends onanything I do at all.I am better off doing as Abnegation taught me: turning away from myself,projecting always outward, and hoping that in whatever is next, I will be betterthan I am now.I smile a little. I wish I could tell my parents that I will die like theAbnegation. They would be proud, I think."},{"pageContent":"[images/00018.jpg]THIS MORNING I put on the clean clothes I am given: black pants—too loose, butwho cares?—and a long-sleeved black shirt. No shoes.It is not time yet. I find myself lacing my fingers together and bowing my head.Sometimes my father did this in the morning before sitting down at the breakfasttable, but I never asked him what he was doing. Still, I would like to feel likeI belong to my father again before I … well, before it’s over.A few silent moments later, Peter tells me it’s time to go. He barely looks atme, scowls at the back wall instead. I suppose it would have been too much toask, to see a friendly face this morning. I stand, and together we walk down thehallway.My toes are cold. My feet stick to the tiles. We turn a corner, and I hearmuffled shouts. At first I can’t tell what the voice is saying, but as we drawcloser, it takes shape.“I want to … her!” Tobias. “I … see her!”I glance at Peter. “I can’t speak to him one last time, can I?”Peter shakes his head. “There’s a window, though. Maybe if he sees you he’llfinally shut up.”He takes me down a dead-end corridor that’s only six feet long. At the end is adoor, and Peter is right, there’s a small window near the top, about a footabove my head.“Tris!” Tobias’s voice is even clearer here. “I want to see her!”I reach up and press my palm to the glass. The shouts stop, and his face appearsbehind the glass. His eyes are red; his face, blotchy. Handsome. He stares downat me for a few seconds and then presses his hand to the glass so it lines upwith mine. I pretend I can feel the warmth of it through the window.He leans his forehead against the door and squeezes his eyes shut.I take my hand down and turn away before he can open his eyes. I feel pain in mychest, worse than when I got shot in the shoulder. I clutch the front of myshirt, blink away tears, and rejoin Peter in the main hallway.“Thank you,” I say quietly. I meant to say it louder.“Whatever.” Peter scowls again. “Let’s just go.”I hear rumbling somewhere ahead of us—the sound of a crowd. The next hallway ispacked with Dauntless traitors, tall and short, young and old, armed andunarmed. They all wear the blue armband of betrayal.“Hey!” Peter shouts. “Clear a path!”The Dauntless traitors closest to us hear him, and press against the walls tomake way for us. The other Dauntless traitors follow suit soon after, andeveryone is quiet. Peter steps back to let me go ahead of him. I know the wayfrom here.I don’t know where the pounding starts, but someone drums their fists againstthe wall, and someone else joins in, and I walk down the aisle betweensolemn-but-raucous Dauntless traitors, their hands in motion at their sides. Thepounding is so fast my heart races to keep up with it.Some of the Dauntless traitors incline their heads to me—I’m not sure why. Itdoesn’t matter.I reach the end of the hallway and open the door to my execution chamber.I open it.Dauntless traitors crowded the hallway; the Erudite crowd the execution room,but there, they have made a path for me already. Silently they study me as Iwalk to the metal table in the center of the room. Jeanine stands a few stepsaway. The scratches on her face show through hastily applied makeup. She doesn’tlook at me.Four cameras dangle from the ceiling, one at each corner of the table. I sitdown first, wipe my hands off on my pants, and then lie down.The table is cold. Frigid, seeping into my skin, into my bones. Appropriate,perhaps, because that is what will happen to my body when all the life leavesit; it will become cold and heavy, heavier than I have ever been. As for therest of me, I am not sure. Some people believe that I will go nowhere, and maybethey’re right, but maybe they’re not. Such speculations are no longer useful tome anyway.Peter slips an electrode beneath the collar of my shirt and presses it to mychest, right over my heart. He then attaches a wire to the electrode andswitches on the heart monitor. I hear my heartbeat, fast and strong. Soon, wherethat steady rhythm was, there will be nothing.And then rising from within me is a single thought:I don’t want to die.All those times Tobias scolded me for risking my life, I never took himseriously. I believed that I wanted to be with my parents and for all of this tobe over. I was sure I wanted to emulate their self-sacrifice. But no. No, no.Burning and boiling inside me is the desire to live.I don’t want to die I don’t want to die I don’t want to!Jeanine steps forward with a syringe full of purple serum. Her glasses reflectthe fluorescent light above us, so I can barely see her eyes.Every part of my body chants it in unison. Live, live, live. I thought that inorder to give my life in exchange for Will’s, in exchange for my parents’, thatI needed to die, but I was wrong; I need to live my life in the light of theirdeaths. I need to live.Jeanine holds my head steady with one hand and inserts the needle into my neckwith the other.I’m not done! I shout in my head, and not at Jeanine. I am not done here!She presses the plunger down. Peter leans forward and looks into my eyes.“The serum will go into effect in one minute,” he says. “Be brave, Tris.”The words startle me, because that is exactly what Tobias said when he put meunder my first simulation.My heart begins to race.Why would Peter tell me to be brave? Why would he offer any kind words at all?All the muscles in my body relax at once. A heavy, liquid feeling fills mylimbs. If this is death, it isn’t so bad. My eyes stay open, but my head dropsto the side. I try to close my eyes, but I can’t—I can’t move.Then the heart monitor stops beeping."},{"pageContent":"[images/00021.jpg]BUT I’M STILL breathing. Not deeply; not enough to satisfy, but breathing. Peterpushes my eyelids over my eyes. Does he know I’m not dead? Does Jeanine? Can shesee me breathing?“Take the body to the lab,” Jeanine says. “The autopsy is scheduled for thisafternoon.”“All right,” Peter replies.Peter pushes the table forward. I hear mutters all around me as we pass thegroup of Erudite bystanders. My hand falls off the edge of the table as we turna corner, and smacks into the wall. I feel a prickle of pain in my fingertips,but I can’t move my hand, as hard as I try.This time, when we go down the hallway of Dauntless traitors, it is silent.Peter walks slowly at first, then turns another corner and picks up the pace. Healmost sprints down the next corridor, and stops abruptly. Where am I? I can’tbe in the lab already. Why did he stop?Peter’s arms slide under my knees and shoulders, and he lifts me. My head fallsagainst his shoulder.“For someone so small, you’re heavy, Stiff,” he mutters.He knows I’m awake. He knows.I hear a series of beeps, and a slide—a locked door, opening.“What do—” Tobias’s voice. Tobias! “Oh my God. Oh—”“Spare me your blubbering, okay?” Peter says. “She’s not dead; she’s justparalyzed. It’ll only last for about a minute. Now get ready to run.”I don’t understand.How does Peter know?“Let me carry her,” Tobias says.“No. You’re a better shot than I am. Take my gun. I’ll carry her.”I hear the gun slide out of its holster. Tobias brushes a hand over my forehead.They both start running.At first all I hear is the pounding of their feet, and my head snaps backpainfully. I feel tingling in my hands and feet. Peter shouts, “Left!” atTobias.Then a shout from down the hallway. “Hey, what—!”A bang. And nothing.More running. Peter shouts, “Right!” I hear another bang, and another. “Whoa,”he mumbles. “Wait, stop here!”Tingling down my spine. I open my eyes as Peter opens another door. He chargesthrough it, and just before I smack my head against the door frame, I stick myarm out and stop us.“Careful!” I say, my voice strained. My throat still feels as tight as it didwhen he first injected me and I found it difficult to breathe. Peter turnssideways to bring me through the door, then nudges it shut with his heel anddrops me on the floor.The room is almost empty, except for a row of empty trash cans along one walland a square metal door large enough for one of the cans to fit through it alongthe other wall.“Tris,” Tobias says, crouching next to me. His face is pale, almost yellow.There is too much I want to say. The first thing that comes out is, “Beatrice.”He laughs weakly.“Beatrice,” he amends, and touches his lips to mine. I curl my fingers into hisshirt.“Unless you want me to throw up all over you guys, you might want to save it forlater.”“Where are we?” I ask.“This is the trash incinerator,” says Peter, slapping the square door. “I turnedit off. It’ll take us to the alley. And then your aim had better be perfect,Four, if you want to get out of the Erudite sector alive.”“Don’t concern yourself with my aim,” Tobias retorts. He, like me, is barefoot.Peter opens the door to the incinerator. “Tris, you first.”The trash chute is about three feet wide and four feet high. I slide one legdown the chute and, with Tobias’s help, swing the other leg in. My stomach dropsas I slide down a short metal tube. Then a series of rollers pound against myback as I slip over them.I smell fire and ash, but I am not burned. Then I drop, and my arm smacks into ametal wall, making me groan. I land on a cement floor, hard, and pain from theimpact prickles up my shins.“Ow.” I limp away from the opening and shout, “Go ahead!”My legs have recovered by the time Peter lands, on his side instead of his feet.He groans, and drags himself away from the opening to recover.I look around. We are inside the incinerator, which would be completely dark ifnot for the lines of light glowing in the shape of a small door on the otherside. The floor is solid metal in some places and metal grating in others.Everything smells like rotting garbage and fire.“Don’t say I never took you anywhere nice,” Peter says.“Wouldn’t dream of it,” I say.Tobias drops to the floor, landing first on his feet and then tilting forward tohis knees, wincing. I pull him to his feet and then draw close to his side. Allthe smells and sights and feelings of the world feel magnified. I was almostdead, but instead I am alive. Because of Peter.Of all people.Peter walks across the grate and opens the small door. Light streams into theincinerator. Tobias walks with me away from the fire smell, away from the metalfurnace, into the cement-walled room that contains it.“Got that gun?” Peter says to Tobias.“No,” says Tobias, “I figured I would shoot the bullets out of my nostrils, so Ileft it upstairs.”“Oh, shut up.”Peter holds another gun in front of him and leaves the incinerator room. A dankhallway with exposed pipes in the ceiling greets us, but it’s only ten feetlong. The sign next to the door at the end says EXIT. I am alive, and I amleaving. The stretch of land between Dauntless headquarters and Erudite headquarters doesnot look the same in reverse. I suppose everything is bound to look differentwhen you aren’t on your way to die.When we reach the end of the alley, Tobias presses his shoulder to one wall andleans forward just enough to see around the corner. His face blank, he puts onearm around the corner, steadying it with the building wall, and fires twice. Ishove my fingers in my ears and try not to pay attention to the gunshots andwhat they make me remember.“Hurry,” Tobias says.We sprint, Peter first, me second, and Tobias last, down Wabash Avenue. I lookover my shoulder to see what Tobias shot at, and see two men on the groundbehind Erudite headquarters. One isn’t moving, and the other is clutching hisarm and running toward the door. They will send others after us.My head feels muddled, probably from exhaustion, but the adrenaline keeps merunning.“Take the least logical route!” shouts Tobias.“What?” Peter says.“The least logical route,” Tobias says. “So they won’t find us!”Peter swerves to the left, down another alley, this one full of cardboard boxesthat contain frayed blankets and stained pillows—old factionless dwellings, Iassume. He jumps over a box that I go crashing through, kicking it behind me.At the end of the alley he turns left, toward the marsh. We are back on MichiganAvenue. In plain sight of Erudite headquarters, if anyone cares to glance downthe street.“Bad idea!” I shout.Peter takes the next right. At least all the streets here are clear—no fallenstreet signs to dodge or holes to jump over. My lungs burn like I inhaledpoison. My legs, which ached at first, are now numb, which is better. Somewherefar away, I hear shouts.Then it occurs to me: The least logical thing to do is stop running.I grab Peter’s sleeve and drag him toward the nearest building. It is sixstories high, with wide windows arranged into a grid, divided by pillars ofbrick. The first door I try is locked, but Tobias fires at the window next to ituntil it breaks, and unlocks the door from the inside.The building is completely empty. Not a single chair or table. And there are toomany windows. We walk toward the emergency stairwell, and I crawl beneath thefirst flight so that we are hidden by the staircase. Tobias sits next to me, andPeter across from us both, his knees drawn to his chest.I try to catch my breath and calm myself down, but it isn’t easy. I was dead. Iwas dead, and then I wasn’t, and why? Because of Peter? Peter?I stare at him. He still looks so innocent, despite all that he has done toprove that he is not. His hair lies smooth against his head, shiny and dark,like we didn’t just run for a mile at full speed. His round eyes scan thestairwell and then rest on my face.“What?” he says. “Why are you looking at me like that?”“How did you do it?” I say.“It wasn’t that hard,” he says. “I dyed a paralytic serum purple and switched itout with the death serum. Replaced the wire that was supposed to read yourheartbeat with a dead one. The bit with the heart monitor was harder; I had toget some Erudite help with a remote and stuff—you wouldn’t understand it if Iexplained it to you.”“Why did you do it?” I say. “You want me dead. You were willing to do ityourself! What changed?”He presses his lips together and doesn’t look away, not for a long time. Then heopens his mouth, hesitates, and finally says, “I can’t be in anyone’s debt.Okay? The idea that I owed you something made me sick. I would wake up in themiddle of the night feeling like I was going to vomit. Indebted to a Stiff? It’sridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. And I couldn’t have it.”“What are you talking about? You owed me something?”He rolls his eyes. “The Amity compound. Someone shot me—the bullet was at headlevel; it would have hit me right between the eyes. And you shoved me out of theway. We were even before that—I almost killed you during initiation, you almostkilled me during the attack simulation; we’re square, right? But after that …”“You’re insane,” says Tobias. “That’s not the way the world works … witheveryone keeping score.”“It’s not?” Peter raises his eyebrows. “I don’t know what world you live in, butin mine, people only do things for you for one of two reasons. The first is ifthey want something in return. And the second is if they feel like they owe yousomething.”“Those aren’t the only reasons people do things for you,” I say. “Sometimes theydo them because they love you. Well, maybe not you, but …”Peter snorts. “That’s exactly the kind of garbage I expect a delusional Stiff tosay.”“I guess we just have to make sure you owe us,” says Tobias. “Or you’ll gorunning to whoever offers you the best deal.”“Yeah,” Peter says. “That’s pretty much how it is.”I shake my head. I can’t imagine living the way he does—always keeping track ofwho gave me what and what I should give them in return, incapable of love orloyalty or forgiveness, a one-eyed man with a knife in hand, looking for someoneelse’s eye to poke out. That isn’t life. It’s some paler version of life. Iwonder where he learned it from.“So when can we get out of here, you think?” Peter says.“Couple hours,” says Tobias. “We should go to the Abnegation sector. That’swhere the factionless and the Dauntless who aren’t wired for simulations will beby now.”“Fantastic,” says Peter.Tobias puts his arm around me. I press my cheek into his shoulder, and close myeyes so I don’t have to look at Peter. I know there is a lot to say, though I’mnot sure exactly what it is, but we can’t say it here, or now. As we walk the streets I once called home, conversations sputter and die, andeyes cling to my face and body. As far as they knew—and I’m sure they knew,because Jeanine knows how to spread news—I died less than six hours ago. Inotice that some of the factionless I pass are marked with patches of blue dye.They are simulation-ready.Now that we’re here, and safe, I realize that there are cuts all over thebottoms of my feet from running over rough pavement and bits of glass frombroken windows. Every step stings. I focus on that instead of all the stares.“Tris?” someone calls out ahead of us. I lift my head, and see Uriah andChristina on the sidewalk, comparing revolvers. Uriah drops his gun in the grassand sprints toward me. Christina follows him, but at a slower pace.Uriah reaches for me, but Tobias sets a hand on his shoulder to stop him. I feela surge of gratitude. I don’t think I can handle Uriah’s embrace, or hisquestions, or his surprise, right now.“She’s been through a lot,” Tobias says. “She just needs to sleep. She’ll bedown the street—number thirty-seven. Come visit tomorrow.”Uriah frowns at me. The Dauntless don’t usually understand restraint, and Uriahhas only ever known the Dauntless. But he must respect Tobias’s assessment ofme, because he nods and says, “Okay. Tomorrow.”Christina reaches out as I pass her and squeezes my shoulder lightly. I try tostand up straighter, but my muscles feel like a cage, holding my shouldershunched. The eyes follow me down the street, pinching the back of my neck. I amrelieved when Tobias leads us up the front walk of the gray house that belongedto Marcus Eaton.I don’t know by what strength Tobias marches through the doorway. For him thishouse must contain echoes of screaming parents and belt snaps and hours spent insmall, dark closets, yet he doesn’t look troubled as he leads Peter and me intothe kitchen. If anything he stands taller. But maybe that is Tobias—when he’ssupposed to be weak, he’s strong.Tori, Harrison, and Evelyn stand in the kitchen. The sight overwhelms me. I leanmy shoulder into the wall and squeeze my eyes shut. The outline of the executiontable is printed on my eyelids. I open my eyes. I try to breathe. They aretalking but I can’t hear what they’re saying. Why is Evelyn here, in Marcus’shouse? Where is Marcus?Evelyn puts one arm around Tobias and touches his face with the other, pressingher cheek to his. She says something to him. He smiles at her when he pullsaway. Mother and son, reconciled. I am not sure it’s wise.Tobias turns me around and, keeping one hand on my arm and one on my waist, toavoid my shoulder wound, presses me toward the staircase. We climb the stepstogether.Upstairs are his parents’ old bedroom and his old bedroom, with a bathroombetween them, and that’s it. He takes me into his bedroom, and I stand for amoment, looking around at the room where he spent most of his life.He keeps his hand on my arm. He has been touching me in some way since we leftthe stairwell of that building, like he thinks I might break apart if he doesn’thold me together.“Marcus didn’t go into this room after I left, I’m pretty sure,” says Tobias.“Because nothing was moved when I came back here.”Members of Abnegation don’t own many decorations, since they are viewed asself-indulgent, but what few things we were allowed, he has. A stack of schoolpapers. A small bookshelf. And, strangely, a sculpture made of blue glass on hisdresser.“My mother smuggled that to me when I was young. Told me to hide it,” he says.“The day of the ceremony, I put it on my dresser before I left. So he would seeit. A small act of defiance.”I nod. It is strange to be in a place that carries one single memory socompletely. This room is sixteen-year-old Tobias, about to choose Dauntless toescape his father.“Let’s take care of your feet,” he says. But he doesn’t move, just shifts hisfingers to the inside of my elbow.“Okay,” I say.We walk into the adjoined bathroom, and I sit on the edge of the tub. He sitsnext to me, a hand on my knee as he turns on the faucet and plugs the drain.Water spills into the tub, covering my toenails. My blood turns the water pink.He crouches in the tub and puts my foot in his lap, dabbing at the deeper cutswith a washcloth. I don’t feel it. Even when he smears soap lather over them, Idon’t feel anything. The bathwater turns gray.I pick up the bar of soap and turn it in my hands until my skin is coated withwhite lather. I reach for him and run my fingers over his hands, careful to getthe lines in his palms and the spaces between his fingers. It feels good to dosomething, to clean something, and to have my hands on him again.We get water all over the bathroom floor as we both splash it on ourselves toget the soap off. The water makes me cold, but I shiver and I don’t care. Hegets a towel and starts to dry my hands.“I don’t …” I sound like I am being strangled. “My family is all dead, ortraitors; how can I …”I am not making any sense. The sobs take over my body, my mind, everything. Hegathers me to him, and bathwater soaks my legs. His hold is tight. I listen tohis heartbeat and, after a while, find a way to let the rhythm calm me.“I’ll be your family now,” he says.“I love you,” I say.I said that once, before I went to Erudite headquarters, but he was asleep then.I don’t know why I didn’t say it when he could hear it. Maybe I was afraid totrust him with something so personal as my devotion. Or afraid that I did notknow what it was to love someone. But now I think the scary thing was not sayingit before it was almost too late. Not saying it before it was almost too latefor me.I am his, and he is mine, and it has been that way all along.He stares at me. I wait with my hands clutching his arms for stability as heconsiders his response.He frowns at me. “Say it again.”“Tobias,” I say, “I love you.”His skin is slippery with water and he smells like sweat and my shirt sticks tohis arms when he slides them around me. He presses his face to my neck andkisses me right above the collarbone, kisses my cheek, kisses my lips.“I love you, too,” he says."},{"pageContent":"[images/00023.jpg]HE LIES NEXT to me as I fall sleep. I expect to have nightmares, but I must betoo tired, because my mind stays empty. When I open my eyes next, he’s gone, butthere’s a stack of clothes on the bed beside me.I get up and walk into the bathroom and I feel raw, like my skin was scrapedclean and every breath of air stings it a little, but stable. I don’t turn onthe lights in the bathroom because I know they will be pale and bright, justlike the lights in the Erudite compound. I shower in the dark, barely able totell soap from conditioner, and tell myself that I will emerge new and strong,that the water will heal me.Before I leave the bathroom, I pinch my cheeks hard to bring blood to thesurface of my skin. It’s stupid, but I don’t want to look weak and exhausted infront of everyone.When I walk back into Tobias’s room, Uriah is sprawled across the bed facedown;Christina is holding the blue sculpture above Tobias’s desk, examining it; andLynn is poised above Uriah with a pillow, a wicked grin creeping across herface.Lynn smacks Uriah hard in the back of the head, Christina says, “Hey Tris!” andUriah cries, “Ow! How on earth do you make a pillow hurt, Lynn?”“My exceptional strength,” she says. “Did you get smacked, Tris? One of yourcheeks is bright red.”I must not have pinched the other one hard enough. “No, it’s just … my morningglow.”I try the joke out on my tongue like it’s a new language. Christina laughs,maybe a little harder than my comment warrants, but I appreciate the effort.Uriah bounces on the bed a few times when he moves to the edge.“So, the thing we’re all not talking about,” he says. He gestures to me. “Youalmost died, a sadistic pansycake saved you, and now we’re all waging someserious war with the factionless as allies.”“Pansycake?” says Christina.“Dauntless slang.” Lynn smirks. “Supposed to be a huge insult, only no one usesit anymore.”“Because it’s so offensive,” says Uriah, nodding.“No. Because it’s so stupid no Dauntless with any sense would speak it, letalone think it. Pansycake. What are you, twelve?”“And a half,” he says.I get the feeling their banter is for my benefit, so that I don’t have to sayanything; I can just laugh. And I do, enough to warm the stone that has formedin my stomach.“There’s food downstairs,” says Christina. “Tobias made scrambled eggs, which,as it turns out, is a disgusting food.”“Hey,” I say. “I like scrambled eggs.”“Must be a Stiff breakfast, then.” She grabs my arm. “C’mon.”Together we go down the stairs, our footsteps thundering as they never wouldhave been allowed to in my parents’ house. My father used to scold me forrunning down the stairs. “Do not call attention to yourself,” he said. “It isnot courteous to the people around you.”I hear voices in the living room—a chorus of them, in fact, joined by occasionalbursts of laughter and a faint melody plucked on an instrument, a banjo or aguitar. It is not what I expect in an Abnegation house, where everything isalways quiet, no matter how many people are gathered within. The voices and thelaughter and the music breathe life into the sullen walls. I feel even warmer.I stand in the doorway to the living room. Five people are crowded onto thethree-person couch, playing a card game I recognize from Candor headquarters. Aman sits in the armchair with a woman balanced on his lap, and someone elseperches on the arm, a can of soup in hand. Tobias sits on the floor, his backagainst the coffee table. Every part of his posture suggests ease—one leg bent,the other straight, an arm slung across his knee, his head tilted to listen. Ihave never seen him look so comfortable without a gun. I didn’t think it waspossible.I get the same sinking feeling in my stomach that I always get when I know I’vebeen lied to, but I don’t know who it was that lied to me this time, or aboutwhat, exactly. But this is not what I was taught to expect of factionlessness. Iwas taught that it was worse than death.I stand there for just a few seconds before people realize that I’m there. Theirconversation peters out. I wipe my palms off on the hem of my shirt. Too manyeyes, and too much silence.Evelyn clears her throat. “Everyone, this is Tris Prior. I believe you may haveheard a lot about her yesterday.”“And Christina, Uriah, and Lynn,” supplies Tobias. I’m grateful for his attemptto divert everyone’s attention from me, but it doesn’t work.I stand glued to the door frame for a few seconds, and then one of thefactionless men—older, his wrinkled skin patterned with tattoos—speaks up.“Aren’t you supposed to be dead?”Some of the others laugh, and I try a smile. It emerges crooked and small.“Supposed to be,” I say.“We don’t like to give Jeanine Matthews what she wants, though,” Tobias says. Hegets up and hands me a can of peas—but it isn’t full of peas; it’s full ofscrambled eggs. The aluminum warms my fingers.He sits, so I sit next to him, and scoop some of the eggs into my mouth. I amnot hungry, but I know I need to eat, so I chew and swallow anyway. I amfamiliar with the way the factionless eat, so I pass the eggs to Christina, andtake a can of peaches from Tobias.“Why is everyone camped out in Marcus’s house?” I ask him.“Evelyn kicked him out. Said it was her house, too, and he’d gotten to use itfor years, and it was her turn.” Tobias grins. “It caused a huge blowup on thefront lawn, but eventually Evelyn won.”I glance at Tobias’s mother. She is in the far corner of the room, talking toPeter and eating more eggs from another can. My stomach churns. Tobias talksabout her almost reverently. But I still remember what she said to me about mytransience in Tobias’s life.“There’s bread somewhere.” He picks up a basket from the coffee table and handsit to me. “Take two pieces. You need it.”As I chew on the bread crust, I look at Peter and Evelyn again.“I think she’s trying to recruit him,” Tobias says. “She has a way of making thefactionless life sound extraordinarily appealing.”“Anything to get him out of Dauntless. I don’t care if he saved my life, I stilldon’t like him.”“Hopefully we won’t have to worry about faction distinctions anymore by the timethis is over. It’ll be nice, I think.”I don’t say anything. I don’t feel like picking a fight with him here. Orreminding him that it won’t be so easy to persuade Dauntless and Candor to jointhe factionless in their crusade against the faction system. It may take anotherwar.The front door opens, and Edward enters. Today he wears a patch with a blue eyepainted on it, complete with a half-lowered eyelid. The effect of the overlargeeye against his otherwise handsome face is both grotesque and amusing.“Eddie!” someone calls out in greeting. But Edward’s good eye has already fallenon Peter. He starts across the room, nearly kicking a can of food out ofsomeone’s hand. Peter presses into the shadow of the door frame like he istrying to disappear into it.Edward stops inches from Peter’s feet, and then jerks toward him like he isabout to throw a punch. Peter jolts back so hard he slams his head into thewall. Edward grins, and all around us, the factionless laugh.“Not so brave in broad daylight,” Edward says. And then, to Evelyn, “Make sureyou don’t give him any utensils. Never know what he might do with them.”As he speaks, he plucks the fork from Peter’s hand.“Give that back,” says Peter.Edward slams his free hand into Peter’s throat, and presses the tines of thefork between his fingers, right against Peter’s Adam’s apple. Peter stiffens,blood rushing into his face.“Keep your mouth shut around me,” he says, his voice low, “or I will do thisagain, only next time, I’ll shove it right through your esophagus.”“That’s enough,” Evelyn says. Edward drops the fork and releases Peter. Then hewalks across the room and sits next to the person who called him “Eddie” amoment before.“I don’t know if you know this,” Tobias says, “but Edward is a little unstable.”“I’m getting that,” I say.“That Drew guy, who helped Peter perform that butter-knife maneuver,” Tobiassays. “Apparently when he got kicked out of Dauntless, he tried to join the samegroup of factionless Edward was a part of. Notice that you haven’t seen Drewanywhere.”“Did Edward kill him?” I say.“Nearly,” Tobias says. “Evidently that’s why that other transfer—Myra, I thinkher name was?—left Edward. Too gentle to bear it.”I feel hollow at the thought of Drew, almost dead at the hands of Edward. Drewattacked me, too.“I don’t want to talk about this,” I say.“Okay,” Tobias says. He touches my shoulder. “Is it hard for you to be in anAbnegation house again? I meant to ask before. We can go somewhere else, if itis.”I finish my second piece of bread. All Abnegation houses are the same, so thisliving room is exactly the same as my own, and it does bring back memories, if Ilook at it carefully. Light glowing through the blinds every morning, enough formy father to read by. The click of my mother’s knitting needles every evening.But I don’t feel like I’m choking. It’s a start.“Yes,” I say. “But not as hard as you might think.”He raises an eyebrow.“Really. The simulations in Erudite headquarters … helped me, somehow. To holdon, maybe.” I frown. “Or maybe not. Maybe they helped me to stop holding on sotightly.” That sounds right. “Someday I’ll tell you about it.” My voice soundsfar away.He touches my cheek and, even though we’re in a room full of people, crowded bylaughter and conversation, slowly kisses me.“Whoa there, Tobias,” says the man to my left. “Weren’t you raised a Stiff? Ithought the most you people did was … graze hands or something.”“Then how do you explain all the Abnegation children?” Tobias raises hiseyebrows.“They’re brought into being by sheer force of will,” the woman on the arm of thechair interjects. “Didn’t you know that, Tobias?”“No, I wasn’t aware.” He grins. “My apologies.”They all laugh. We all laugh. And it occurs to me that I might be meetingTobias’s true faction. They are not characterized by a particular virtue. Theyclaim all colors, all activities, all virtues, and all flaws as their own.I don’t know what binds them together. The only common ground they have, as faras I know, is failure. Whatever it is, it seems to be enough.I feel, as I look at him, that I am finally seeing him as he is, instead of howhe is in relation to me. So how well do I really know him, if I have not seenthis before? The sun is beginning to set. The Abnegation sector is far from quiet. TheDauntless and factionless wander the streets, some with bottles in their hands,some with guns in their other hands.Ahead of me, Zeke pushes Shauna in her wheelchair past the house of AliceBrewster, former Abnegation leader. They don’t see me.“Do it again!” she says.“Are you sure?”“Yes!”“Okay …” Zeke starts to jog behind the wheelchair. Then, when he’s almost toofar away for me to see, he pushes himself up with the handles so that his feetaren’t touching the ground, and together they fly down the middle of the street,Shauna shrieking, Zeke laughing.I turn left at the next intersection and start down the cracked sidewalk towardthe building where Abnegation had its monthly faction-wide meetings. Though itfeels like it has been a long time since I last went there, I still rememberwhere it is. One block south, two blocks west.The sun inches toward the horizon as I walk. The color drains from thesurrounding buildings in the evening light, so that they all appear to be gray.The face of Abnegation headquarters is just a cement rectangle, like all theother buildings in the Abnegation sector. But when I shove the front door open,familiar wood floors and rows of wooden benches arranged in a square greet me.In the center of the room is a skylight that lets in a square of orangesunlight. It is the room’s only adornment.I sit on my family’s old bench. I used to sit next to my father, and Caleb, nextto my mother. Now I feel like the only one left. The last Prior.“It’s nice, isn’t it?” Marcus walks in and sits down across from me, his handsfolded in his lap. The sunlight is between us.He has a large bruise on his jaw from where Tobias hit him, and his hair isfreshly buzzed.“It’s fine,” I say, straightening. “What are you doing here?”“I saw you come in.” He examines his fingernails carefully. “And I want to havea word with you about the information Jeanine Matthews stole.”“What if you’re too late? What if I already know what it is?”Marcus looks up from his fingernails, and his dark eyes narrow. The look is farmore poisonous than any Tobias could muster, though he has his father’s eyes.“You can’t possibly.”“You don’t know that.”“I do, actually. Because I have seen what happens to people when they hear thetruth. They look like they have forgotten what they were searching for, and arejust wandering around trying to remember.”A chill makes its way up my spine and spreads down my arms, giving me goosebumps.“I know that Jeanine decided to murder half a faction to steal it, so it must beincredibly important,” I say. I pause. I know something else, too, but I onlyjust realized it.Right before I attacked Jeanine, she said, “This is not about you! It’s notabout me!”And this meant what she was doing to me—trying to find a simulation that workedon me. On the Divergent.“I know it has something to do with the Divergent,” I blurt out. “I know theinformation is about what’s outside the fence.”“That is not the same thing as knowing what’s outside the fence.”“Well, are you going to tell me or are you going to dangle it over my head andmake me jump for it?”“I did not come here for self-indulgent arguing. And no, I am not going to tellyou, but not because I don’t want to. It’s because I have no idea how todescribe it to you. You have to see it for yourself.”As he speaks, I notice the sunlight turning more orange than yellow, and castingdarker shadows over his face.“I think Tobias might be right,” I say. “You like to be the only one who knows.You like that I don’t know. It makes you feel important. That’s why you won’ttell me, not because it’s indescribable.”“That’s not true.”“How am I supposed to know that?”Marcus stares, and I stare back.“A week before the simulation attack, the Abnegation leaders decided it was timeto reveal the information in the file to everyone. Everyone, in the entire city.The day we intended to reveal it was approximately seven days after thesimulation attack. Obviously we were unable to do so.”“She didn’t want you to reveal what was outside the fence? Why not? How did sheeven know about it in the first place? I thought you said only the Abnegationleaders knew.”“We are not from here, Beatrice. We were all placed here, for a specificpurpose. A while ago, the Abnegation were forced to enlist the help of Eruditein order to achieve that purpose, but eventually everything went awry because ofJeanine. Because she doesn’t want to do what we are supposed to do. She wouldrather resort to murder.”Placed here.My brain feels like it is buzzing with information. I clutch the edge of thebench beneath me.“What are we supposed to do?” I say, my voice barely more than a whisper.“I have told you enough to convince you that I am not a liar. As for the rest, Itruly find myself unequal to the task of explaining it to you. I only told youas much as I did because the situation has become dire.”Dire. Suddenly I understand the problem. The factionless plan to destroy, notonly the important figures in Erudite, but all the data they have. They willlevel everything.I have never thought that plan was a good idea, but I knew that we could comeback from it, because the Erudite still know the relevant information, even ifthey don’t have their data. But this is something even the most intelligentErudite do not know; something that, if everything is destroyed, we cannotreplicate.“If I help you, I betray Tobias. I will lose him.” I swallow hard. “So you haveto give me a good reason.”“Aside from the good of everyone in our society?” Marcus wrinkles his nose indisgust. “That isn’t enough for you?”“Our society is in pieces. So no, it’s not.”Marcus sighs.“Your parents died for you, it’s true. But the reason your mother was inAbnegation headquarters the night you were almost executed was not to save you.She didn’t know you were there. She was trying to rescue the file from Jeanine.And when she heard that you were about to die, she rushed to save you, and leftthe file in Jeanine’s hands.”“That’s not what she told me,” I say hotly.“She was lying. Because she had to. But Beatrice, the point is … the point is,your mother knew she probably would not get out of Abnegation headquartersalive, but she had to try. This file, it was something she was willing to diefor. Understand?”The Abnegation are willing to die for any person, friend or enemy, if thesituation calls for it. That is, perhaps, why they find it difficult to survivein life-threatening situations. But there are few things they are willing to diefor. They don’t value many things in the physical world.So if he’s telling me the truth, and my mother really was willing to die forthis information to become public … I would do just about anything to accomplishthe goal she failed to achieve.“You’re trying to manipulate me. Aren’t you.”“I suppose,” he says as shadows slip into his eye sockets like dark water, “thatis something you must decide for yourself.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00025.jpg]I TAKE MY time on my walk back to the Eaton house, and try to remember what mymother told me when she saved me from the tank during the simulation attack.Something about having watched the trains since the attack started. I didn’tknow what I would do when I found you. But it was always my intention to saveyou.But when I go over the memory of her voice in my mind, it sounds different. Ididn’t know what I would do, when I found you. Meaning: I didn’t know how tosave both you and the file. But it was always my intention to save you.I shake my head. Is that how she said it, or am I manipulating my own memorybecause of what Marcus told me? There is no way to know. All I can do is decideif I trust Marcus or not.And while he has done cruel, evil things, our society is not divided into “good”and “bad.” Cruelty does not make a person dishonest, the same way bravery doesnot make a person kind. Marcus is not good or bad, but both.Well, he is probably more bad than good.But that doesn’t mean he’s lying.On the street ahead of me, I see the orange glow of fire. Alarmed, I walkfaster, and see that the fire rises from large, man-sized metal bowls set up onthe sidewalks. The Dauntless and the factionless have gathered between them, anarrow divide separating one group from the other. And before them stand Evelyn,Harrison, Tori, and Tobias.I spot Christina, Uriah, Lynn, Zeke, and Shauna on the right side of the clusterof Dauntless, and stand with them.“Where’ve you been?” Christina says. “We looked all over for you.”“I went for a walk. What’s going on?”“They’re finally going to tell us the attack plan,” says Uriah, looking eager.“Oh,” I say.Evelyn lifts her hands, palms out, and the factionless fall silent. They arebetter trained than the Dauntless, whose voices take thirty seconds to peterout.“The past few weeks, we have been developing a plan to fight the Erudite,”Evelyn says, her low voice carrying easily. “And now that we have finished, wewould like to share it with you.”Evelyn nods at Tori, who takes over. “Our strategy is not pointed, but broad.There is no way to know who among the Erudite supports Jeanine and who does not.It is therefore safer to assume that all those who do not support her havealready vacated Erudite headquarters.”“We all know that Erudite’s power lies not in its people but in itsinformation,” says Evelyn. “As long as they still possess that information, wewill never be free of them, especially while large numbers of us are wired forsimulations. They have used information to control us and keep us under theirthumb for far too long.”A shout, beginning among the factionless and spreading to the Dauntless, risesup from the crowd like we are all parts of one organism, following the commandsof a single brain. But I am not sure what I think, or how I feel. There is apart of me that is shouting, too—clamoring for the destruction of every singleErudite and all that they hold dear.I look at Tobias. His expression is neutral, and he stands behind the glow offirelight, where he is difficult to see. I wonder what he thinks of this.“I am sorry to tell you that those of you who were shot with simulationtransmitters will have to remain here,” says Tori, “or you can be activated as aweapon of Erudite at any time.”There are a few cries of protest, but no one seems all that surprised. They knowtoo well what Jeanine can do with simulations, maybe.Lynn groans and looks at Uriah. “We have to stay?”“You have to stay,” he says.“You got shot too,” she says. “I saw it.”“Divergent, remember?” he says. Lynn rolls her eyes, and he hurries on, probablyto avoid hearing Lynn’s Divergent conspiracy theory again. “Anyway, I bet you noone checks, and what are the odds she’ll activate you, specifically, if sheknows everyone else with simulation transmitters is staying behind?”Lynn frowns, considering this. But she looks more cheerful—as cheerful as Lynngets, anyway—as Tori begins speaking again.“The rest of us will divide into groups of mixed factionless and Dauntless,”says Tori. “A single, large group will attempt to penetrate Erudite headquartersand work its way up through the building, cleansing it of Erudite’s influence.Several other, smaller groups will proceed immediately to the higher levels ofthe building to dispense with certain key Erudite officials. You will receiveyour group assignments later this evening.”“The attack will occur in three days’ time,” says Evelyn. “Prepare yourselves.This will be dangerous and difficult. But the factionless are familiar withdifficulty—”At this the factionless cheer, and I am reminded that we, the Dauntless, are thesame people who, just a few weeks ago, were criticizing Abnegation for givingthe factionless food and other necessary items. How was that so easy to forget?“And the Dauntless are familiar with danger—”Everyone around me punches the air with their fists and screams. I feel theirvoices inside my head, and the burn of triumph in my chest that makes me want tojoin them.Evelyn’s expression is too empty for someone giving an impassioned speech. Herface looks like a mask.“Down with Erudite!” Tori yells, and everyone repeats her, all voices joiningtogether, regardless of faction. We share a common enemy, but does that make usfriends?I notice that Tobias does not join in the chant, and neither does Christina.“This doesn’t feel right,” she says.“What do you mean?” Lynn says as the voices rise around us. “Don’t you rememberwhat they did to us? Put our minds under a simulation and forced us to shootpeople without even knowing it? Murdered every single Abnegation leader?”“Yeah,” says Christina. “It’s just … Invading a faction’s headquarters andkilling everyone, isn’t that what the Erudite just did to Abnegation?”“This is different. This is not an attack out of nowhere, unprovoked,” saysLynn, scowling at her.“Yeah,” Christina says. “Yeah, I know.”She looks at me. I don’t say anything. She has a point—it doesn’t feel right.I walk toward the Eaton house in search of silence.I open the front door and climb the stairs. When I reach Tobias’s old room, Isit on the bed and look out the window, where factionless and Dauntless aregathered around the fires, laughing and talking. But they aren’t mixed together;there is still an uneasy divide between them, factionless on one side andDauntless on the other.I watch Lynn, Uriah, and Christina by one of the fires. Uriah snatches at theflames, too quickly to be burned. His smile looks more like a grimace, twistedas it is by grief.After a few minutes I hear footsteps on the stairs, and Tobias comes into theroom, slipping off his shoes by the doorway.“What’s wrong?” he says.“Nothing, really,” I say. “I was just thinking, I’m surprised the factionlessagreed to work with Dauntless so easily. It’s not like the Dauntless were everkind to them.”He stands beside me at the window and leans into the frame.“It’s not a natural alliance, is it,” he says. “But we have the same goal.”“Right now. But what happens when the goals change? The factionless want to getrid of factions, and the Dauntless don’t.”Tobias presses his mouth into a line. I suddenly remember Marcus and Johanna,walking together through the orchard—Marcus wore the same expression when he waskeeping something from her.Did Tobias get that expression from his father? Or does it mean somethingdifferent?“You’re in my group,” he says. “During the attack. I hope you don’t mind. We’resupposed to lead the way to the control rooms.”The attack. If I participate in the attack, I can’t go after the informationJeanine stole from Abnegation. I have to choose one or the other.Tobias said that dealing with Erudite was more important than finding out thetruth. And if he had not promised the factionless control over all of Erudite’sdata, he might have been right. But he left me no choice. I have to help Marcus,if there is even a chance that he is telling the truth. I have to work againstthe people I love best.And right now, I have to lie.I twist my fingers together.“What is it?” he says.“I still can’t fire a gun.” I look up at him. “And after what happened inErudite headquarters …” I clear my throat. “Risking my life doesn’t seem soappealing anymore.”“Tris.” He brushes my cheek with his fingertips. “You don’t have to go.”“I don’t want to seem like a coward.”“Hey.” His fingers fit beneath my jaw. They are cool against my skin. He lookssternly at me. “You have done more for this faction than any other person. You…”He sighs, and touches his forehead to mine.“You’re the bravest person I’ve ever met. Stay here. Let yourself mend.”He kisses me, and I feel like I am crumbling again, beginning with the deepestparts of me. He thinks I will be here, but I will be working against him,working with the father he despises. This lie—this lie is the worst I have evertold. I will never be able to take it back.When we part, I am afraid he will hear my breaths shake, so I turn toward thewindow."},{"pageContent":"[images/00027.jpg]“OH YEAH. YOU totally look like a banjo-strumming softie,” says Christina.“Really?”“No. Not at all, actually. Just … let me fix it, okay?”She rummages in her bag for a few seconds and pulls out a small box. In it aredifferent-sized tubes and containers that I recognize as makeup, but wouldn’tknow what to do with.We are in my parents’ house. It was the only place I could think of to go to getready. Christina has no reservations about poking around—she already discoveredtwo textbooks wedged between the dresser and the wall, evidence of Caleb’sErudite leanings.“Let me get this straight. So you left the Dauntless compound to get ready forwar … and took your makeup bag with you?”“Yep. Figured it would be harder for anyone to shoot me if they saw howdevastatingly attractive I was,” she says, arching an eyebrow. “Hold still.”She takes the cap off a black tube about the size of one of my fingers,revealing a red stick. Lipstick, obviously. She touches it to my mouth and dabsit until my lips are covered in color. I can see it when I purse them.“Has anyone ever talked to you about the miracle of eyebrow tweezing?” she says,holding up a pair of tweezers.“Get those away from me.”“Fine.” She sighs. “I would take out the blush, but I’m pretty sure it’s not theright color for you.”“Shocking, considering we’re so similar in skin tone.”“Ha-ha,” she says.By the time we leave, I have red lips and curled eyelashes, and I’m wearing abright red dress. And there’s a knife strapped to the inside of my knee. Thisall makes perfect sense.“Where’s Marcus, Destroyer of Lives, going to meet us?” Christina says. Shewears Amity yellow instead of red, and it glows against her skin.I laugh. “Behind Abnegation headquarters.”We walk down the sidewalk in the dark. All the others should be eating dinnernow—I made sure of that—but in case we run into someone, we wear black jacketsto conceal most of our Amity clothing. I hop over a crack in the cement out ofhabit.“Where are you two going?” Peter’s voice says. I look over my shoulder. He’sstanding on the sidewalk behind us. I wonder how long he’s been there.“Why aren’t you with your attack group, eating dinner?” I say.“I don’t have one.” He taps the arm I shot. “I’m injured.”“Yeah right, you are!” says Christina.“Well, I don’t want to go to battle with a bunch of factionless,” he says, hisgreen eyes glinting. “So I’m going to stay here.”“Like a coward,” says Christina, her lip curled in disgust. “Let everyone elseclean up the mess for you.”“Yep!” he says with a kind of malicious cheer. He claps his hands. “Have fundying.”He crosses the street, whistling, and walks in the other direction.“Well, we distracted him,” she says. “He didn’t ask where we were going again.”“Yeah. Good.” I clear my throat. “So, this plan. It’s kind of stupid, right?”“It’s not … stupid.”“Oh, come on. Trusting Marcus is stupid. Trying to get past the Dauntless at thefence is stupid. Going against the Dauntless and factionless is stupid. Allthree combined is … a different kind of stupid formerly unheard of byhumankind.”“Unfortunately it’s also the best plan we have,” she points out. “If we wanteveryone to know the truth.”I trusted Christina to take up this mission when I thought I would die, so itseemed stupid not to trust her now. I was worried she wouldn’t want to come withme, but I forgot where Christina came from: Candor, where the pursuit of truthis more important than anything else. She may be Dauntless now, but if there’sone thing I’ve learned through all this, it’s that we never leave our oldfactions behind.“So this is where you grew up. Did you like it here?” She frowns. “I guess youcouldn’t have, if you wanted to leave.”The sun inches toward the horizon as we walk. I never used to like evening lightbecause it made everything in the Abnegation sector look more monochromatic thanit already is, but now I find the unchanging gray comforting.“I liked some things and hated some things,” I say. “And there were some thingsI didn’t know I had until I lost them.”We reach Abnegation headquarters, and its face is just a cement square likeeverything else in the Abnegation sector. I would love to walk into the meetingroom and breathe the smell of old wood, but we don’t have time. We slip into thealley next to the building and walk to the back, where Marcus told me he wouldbe waiting.A powder-blue pickup truck waits there, its engine running. Marcus is behind thewheel. I let Christina walk ahead of me so that she can be the one to slide intothe middle. I don’t want to sit close to him if I can help it. I feel likehating him while I work with him lessens my betrayal of Tobias somehow.You have no other choice, I tell myself. There is no other way.With that in mind, I pull the door shut and look for a seat belt to buckle. Ifind only the frayed end of a seat belt and a broken buckle.“Where did you find this piece of junk?” says Christina.“I stole it from the factionless. They fix them up. It wasn’t easy to get it tostart. Better ditch those jackets, girls.”I ball up our jackets and toss them out the half-open window. Marcus shifts thetruck into drive, and it groans. I half expect it to stay still when he pressesthe gas pedal, but it moves.From what I remember, it takes about an hour to drive from the Abnegation sectorto Amity headquarters, and the trip requires a skilled driver. Marcus pulls ontoone of the main thoroughfares and pushes his foot into the gas pedal. We lurchforward, narrowly avoiding a gaping hole in the road. I grab the dashboard tosteady myself.“Relax, Beatrice,” says Marcus. “I’ve driven a car before.”“I’ve done a lot of things before, but that doesn’t mean I’m any good at them!”Marcus smiles and jerks the truck to the left so that we don’t hit a fallenstoplight. Christina whoops as we bump over another piece of debris, like she’shaving the time of her life.“A different kind of stupid, right?” she says, her voice loud enough to be heardover the rush of wind through the cab.I clutch the seat beneath me and try not to think of what I ate for dinner. When we reach the fence, we see the Dauntless standing in our headlight beams,blocking the gate. Their blue armbands stand out against the rest of theirclothing. I try to keep my expression pleasant. I will not be able to fool theminto thinking I’m Amity with a scowl on my face.A dark-skinned man with a gun in hand approaches Marcus’s window. He shines aflashlight at Marcus first, then Christina, then me. I squint into the beam, andforce a smile at the man like I don’t mind bright lights in the eyes and gunspointed at my head in the slightest.The Amity must be deranged if this is how they really think. Or they’ve beeneating too much of that bread.“So tell me,” the man says. “What’s an Abnegation member doing in a truck withtwo Amity?”“These two girls volunteered to bring provisions to the city,” Marcus says, “andI volunteered to escort them so that they would be safe.”“Also, we don’t know how to drive,” says Christina, grinning. “My dad tried toteach me years ago but I kept confusing the gas pedal for the brake pedal, andyou can imagine what a disaster that was! Anyway, it was really nice of Joshuato volunteer to take us, because it would have taken us forever otherwise, andthe boxes were so heavy—”The Dauntless man holds up his hand. “Okay, I get it.”“Oh, of course. Sorry.” Christina giggles. “I just thought I would explain,because you seemed so confused, and no wonder, because how many times do youencounter this—”“Right,” the man says. “And do you intend to return to the city?”“Not anytime soon,” Marcus says.“All right. Go ahead, then.” He nods to the other Dauntless by the gate. One ofthem types a series of numbers on the keypad, and the gate slides open to admitus. Marcus nods to the guard who let us through and drives over the worn path toAmity headquarters. The truck’s headlights catch tire tracks and prairie grassand insects weaving back and forth. In the darkness to my right I see fireflieslighting up to a rhythm that is like a heartbeat.After a few seconds, Marcus glances at Christina. “What on earth was that?”“There’s nothing the Dauntless hate more than cheerful Amity babble,” saysChristina, lifting a shoulder. “I figured if he got annoyed it would distracthim and he would let us through.”I smile with all my teeth. “You are a genius.”“I know.” She tosses her head like she’s throwing her hair over one shoulder,only she doesn’t have enough to throw.“Except,” says Marcus, “Joshua is not an Abnegation name.”“Whatever. As if anyone knows the difference.”I see the glow of Amity headquarters ahead, the familiar cluster of woodenbuildings with the greenhouse in their center. We drive through the appleorchard. The air smells like warm earth.Again I remember my mother stretching to pick an apple in this orchard, yearsago when we came to help the Amity with the harvest. A pang hurts my chest, butthe memory doesn’t overwhelm me as it did a few weeks ago. Maybe it’s because Iam on a mission to honor her. Or maybe I am too apprehensive about what’s comingto grieve properly. But something has changed.Marcus parks the truck behind one of the sleeping cabins. For the first time Inotice that there are no keys in the ignition.“How did you get it to start?” I ask him.“My father taught me a lot about mechanics and computers,” he says. “Knowledgethat I passed to my own son. You didn’t think he figured it all out on his own,did you?”“Actually yes, I did.” I push the door open and climb out of the truck. Grassbrushes my toes and the back of my calves. Christina stands at my right shoulderand tilts her head back.“It’s so different out here,” she says. “You could almost forget what’s going onin there.” She points her thumb toward the city.“And they often do,” I say.“They know what’s beyond the city, though, right?” she asks.“They know about as much as the Dauntless patrols,” says Marcus. “Which is thatthe outside world is unknown and potentially dangerous.”“How do you know what they know?” I say.“Because that’s what we told them,” he says, and he walks toward the greenhouse.I exchange a look with Christina. Then we jog to catch up to him.“What does that mean?”“When you are entrusted with all the information, you have to decide how muchother people should know,” says Marcus. “The Abnegation leaders told them whatwe had to tell them. Now, let’s hope Johanna is keeping up her normal habits.She is usually in the greenhouse this early in the evening.”He opens the greenhouse door. The air is just as dense as the last time I was inhere, but now it is misty, too. The moisture cools my cheeks.“Wow,” Christina says.The room is lit by moonlight, so it is hard to distinguish plant from tree fromman-made structure. Leaves brush my face as I make my way around the outer edgeof the room. And then I see Johanna, crouched beside a bush with a bowl in herhands, picking what appear to be raspberries. Her hair is pulled back, so I cansee her scar.“I didn’t think I would see you here again, Ms. Prior,” she says.“Is that because I’m supposed to be dead?” I say.“I always expect those who live by the gun to die by it. I am often pleasantlysurprised.” She balances the bowl on her knees and looks up at me. “Although Ialso know better than to think you came back because you like it here.”“No,” I say. “We came for something else.”“All right,” she says, standing. “Let’s go talk about it, then.”She carries the bowl toward the middle of the room, where the Amity meetings areheld. We follow her onto the tree roots, where she sits and offers me the bowlof raspberries. I take a small handful of berries and pass the bowl toChristina.“Johanna, this is Christina,” Marcus says. “Candor-born Dauntless.”“Welcome to Amity headquarters, Christina.” Johanna smiles knowingly. It seemsso strange, that two people born in Candor could end up in such differentplaces: Dauntless, and Amity.“Tell me, Marcus,” says Johanna. “Why have you come to visit?”“I think Beatrice should handle that,” he says. “I am merely thetransportation.”She shifts her focus to me without question, but I can tell by the wary look inher eyes that she would rather talk to Marcus. She would deny it if I asked her,but I am almost certain Johanna Reyes hates me.“Um …” I say. Not my most brilliant opening. I wipe my palms on my skirt.“Things have gotten bad.”The words start to spill out, without finesse or sophistication. I explain thatthe Dauntless have allied with the factionless, and they plan to destroy all ofErudite, leaving us without one of the two essential factions. I tell her thatthere is important information in the Erudite compound, in addition to all theknowledge they possess, that especially needs to be recovered. When I finish, Irealize I haven’t told her why that has anything to do with her or her faction,but I don’t know how to say it.“I’m confused, Beatrice,” she says. “What exactly do you want us to do?”“I didn’t come here to ask you for help,” I say. “I thought you should know thata lot of people are going to die, very soon. And I know you don’t want to stayhere doing nothing while that happens, even if some of your faction does.”She looks down, her crooked mouth betraying just how right I am.“I also wanted to ask you if we can talk to the Erudite you’re keeping safehere,” I say. “I know they’re hidden, but I need access to them.”“And what do you intend to do?” she says.“Shoot them,” I say, rolling my eyes.“That isn’t funny.”I sigh. “Sorry. I need information. That’s all.”“Well, you’ll have to wait until tomorrow,” Johanna says. “You can sleep here.” I sleep as soon as my head touches the pillow, but wake earlier than I planned.I can tell by the glow near the horizon that the sun is about to rise.Across the narrow aisle between two beds is Christina, her face pressed to themattress with her pillow over her head. A dresser with a lamp on top of itstands between us. The wooden floorboards creak no matter where you step onthem. And on the left wall is a mirror, casually placed. Everyone but theAbnegation takes mirrors for granted. I still feel a prickle of shock whenever Isee one in the open.I get dressed, not bothering to be quiet—five hundred stomping Dauntless can’twake Christina when she’s deeply asleep, though an Erudite whisper might be ableto. She is odd that way.I walk outside as the sun peeks through the tree branches, and see a small groupof Amity gathered near the orchard. I move closer to see what they are doing.They stand in a circle, hands clasped. Half of them are in their early teens,and the other half are adults. The oldest one, a woman with braided gray hair,speaks.“We believe in a God who gives peace and cherishes it,” she says. “So we givepeace to each other, and cherish it.”I would not hear that as a cue, but the Amity seem to. They all begin to move atonce, finding someone across the circle and clasping hands with them. Wheneveryone is paired off, they stand for several seconds, looking at each other.Some of them mutter a phrase, some smile, some remain silent and still. Thenthey break apart and move to someone else, performing the same series of actionsagain.I have never seen an Amity religious ceremony before. I am only familiar withthe religion of my parents’ faction, which part of me still holds to and theother rejects as foolishness—the prayers before dinner, the weekly meetings, theacts of service, the poems about a selfless God. This is something different,something mysterious.“Come and join us,” the gray-haired woman says. It takes me a few seconds torealize she’s talking to me. She beckons to me, smiling.“Oh no,” I say. “I’m just—”“Come,” she says again, and I feel like I have no choice but to walk forward andstand among them.She approaches me first, clasping my hand. Her fingers are dry and rough and hereyes seek mine, persistent, though I feel strange meeting her gaze.Once I do, the effect is immediate and peculiar. I stand still, and every partof me is still, like it weighs more than it used to, only the weight is notunpleasant. Her eyes are brown, the same shade throughout, and unmoving.“May the peace of God be with you,” she says, her voice low, “even in the midstof trouble.”“Why would it?” I say softly, so no one else can hear. “After all I’ve done …”“It isn’t about you,” she says. “It is a gift. You cannot earn it, or it ceasesto be a gift.”She releases me and moves to someone else, but I stand with my handoutstretched, alone. Someone moves to take my hand, but I withdraw from thegroup, first at a walk, and then at a run.I sprint into the trees as fast as I can, and only when my lungs feel like theyare on fire do I stop.I press my forehead to the nearest tree trunk, though it scrapes my skin, andfight off tears. Later that morning I walk through light rain to the main greenhouse. Johanna hascalled an emergency meeting.I stay as hidden as possible at the edge of the room, between two large plantsthat are suspended in mineral solution. It takes me a few minutes to findChristina, dressed in Amity yellow on the right side of the room, but it is easyto spot Marcus, who stands on the roots of the giant tree with Johanna.Johanna has her hands clasped in front of her and her hair pulled back. Theinjury that gave her the scar also damaged her eye—her pupil is so dilated itoverwhelms her iris, and her left eye doesn’t move with the right one as shescans the Amity in front of her.But there are not just Amity. There are people with close-cropped hair andtightly twisted buns who must belong to Abnegation, and a few rows of people inglasses who must be Erudite. Cara is among them.“I have received a message from the city,” says Johanna when everyone quietsdown. “And I would like to communicate it to you.”She tugs at the hem of her shirt, then clasps her hands in front of her. Sheseems nervous.“The Dauntless have allied with the factionless,” she says. “They intend toattack Erudite in two days’ time. Their battle will be waged not against theErudite-Dauntless army but against Erudite innocents and the knowledge they haveworked so hard to acquire.”She looks down, breathes deeply, and continues: “I know that we recognize noleader, so I have no right to address you as if that is what I am,” she says.“But I am hoping that you will forgive me, just this once, for asking if we canreconsider our previous decision to remain uninvolved.”There are murmurs. They are nothing like Dauntless murmurs—they are gentler,like birds launching from branches.“Our relationship with Erudite notwithstanding, we know better than any factionhow essential their role in this society is,” she says. “They must be protectedfrom needless slaughter, if not because they are human beings, then because wecannot survive without them. I propose that we enter the city as nonviolent,impartial peacekeepers in order to curb in whatever way possible the extremeviolence that will undoubtedly occur. Please discuss this.”Rain dusts the glass panels above our heads. Johanna sits on a tree root towait, but the Amity do not burst into conversation as they did the last time Iwas here. Whispers, almost indistinguishable from the rain, turn to normalspeech, and I hear some voices lift above others, almost yelling, but not quite.Every lifted voice sends a jolt through me. I’ve sat through plenty of argumentsin my life, mostly in the last two months, but none of them ever scared me likethis. The Amity aren’t supposed to argue.I decide not to wait any longer. I walk along the edge of the meeting area,squeezing past the Amity who are on their feet and hopping over hands andoutstretched legs. Some of them stare at me—I may be wearing a red shirt, butthe tattoos along my collarbone are clear as ever, even from a distance.I pause near the row of Erudite. Cara stands when I get close, her arms folded.“What are you doing here?” she says.“I came to tell Johanna what was going on,” I say. “And to ask you for help.”“Me?” she says. “Why—”“Not you,” I say. I try to forget what she said about my nose, but it’s hard.“All of you. I have a plan to save some of your faction’s data, but I need yourhelp.”“Actually,” Christina says, appearing at my left shoulder, “we have a plan.”Cara looks from me to Christina and back to me again.“You want to help Erudite?” she says. “I’m confused.”“You wanted to help Dauntless,” I say. “You think you’re the only one whodoesn’t just blindly do what your faction tells you to?”“It is in keeping with your pattern of behavior,” says Cara. “Shooting peoplewho get in your way is a Dauntless trait, after all.”I feel a pinch at the back of my throat. She looks so much like her brother,down to the crease between her eyebrows and the dark streaks in her otherwiseblond hair.“Cara,” says Christina. “Will you help us, or not?”Cara sighs. “Obviously I will. I’m sure the others will, too. Meet us in theErudite dormitory at the end of the meeting, and tell us the plan.” The meeting lasts for another hour. By then the rain has stopped, though waterstill sprinkles the wall and ceiling panels. Christina and I have been sittingagainst one of the walls, playing a game in which each of us tries to pin downthe other’s thumb. She always wins.Finally Johanna and the others who emerged as discussion leaders stand in a lineon the tree roots. Johanna’s hair now hangs over her lowered face. She issupposed to tell us the outcome of the conversation, but she just stands withher arms folded, her fingers tapping against her elbow.“What’s going on?” Christina says.Finally Johanna looks up.“Obviously it was difficult to find agreement,” she says. “But the majority ofyou wish to uphold our policy of uninvolvement.”It does not matter to me whether the Amity decide to go into the city or not.But I had begun to hope they were not all cowards, and to me, this decisionsounds very much like cowardice. I sink back against the window.“It is not my wish to encourage division in this community, which has given somuch to me,” says Johanna. “But my conscience forces me to go against thisdecision. Anyone else whose conscience drives them toward the city is welcome tocome with me.”At first I, like everyone else, am not sure what she’s saying. Johanna tilts herhead so that her scar is again visible, and adds, “I understand if this means Ican’t be a part of Amity anymore.” She sniffs. “But please know that if I haveto leave you, I leave you with love, rather than malice.”Johanna bows in the general direction of the crowd, tucks her hair behind herears, and walks toward the exit. A few of the Amity scramble to their feet, thena few more, and soon the entire crowd is on their feet, and some of them—notmany, but some—are walking out behind her.“That,” says Christina, “is not what I was expecting.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00029.jpg]THE ERUDITE DORMITORY is one of the larger sleeping rooms in Amity headquarters.There are twelve beds total: a row of eight crammed together along the far wall,and two pressed together on each side, leaving a huge space in the middle of theroom. A large table occupies that space, covered with tools and scraps of metaland gears and old computer parts and wires.Christina and I just finished explaining our plan, which sounded a lot dumberwith more than a dozen Erudite staring us down as we talked.“Your plan is flawed,” Cara says. She is the first to respond.“That’s why we came to you,” I say. “So you could tell us how to fix it.”“Well, first of all, this important data you want to rescue,” she says. “Puttingit on a disc is a ridiculous idea. Discs just end up breaking or in the wrongperson’s hands, like all other physical objects. I suggest you make use of thedata network.”“The … what?”She glances at the other Erudite. One of the others—a brown-skinned young man inglasses—says, “Go on. Tell them. There’s no reason to keep secrets anymore.”Cara looks back at me. “Many of the computers in the Erudite compound are set upto access data from the computers in other factions. That’s how it was so easyfor Jeanine to run the attack simulation from a Dauntless computer instead of anErudite one.”“What?” says Christina. “You mean you can just take a stroll through everyfaction’s data whenever you want?”“You can’t ‘take a stroll’ through data,” the young man says. “That’sillogical.”“It’s a metaphor,” says Christina. She frowns. “Right?”“A metaphor, or simply a figure of speech?” he says, also frowning. “Or is ametaphor a definite category beneath the heading of ‘figure of speech’?”“Fernando,” says Cara. “Focus.”He nods.“The fact is,” Cara continues, “the data network exists, and that is ethicallyquestionable, but I believe it can work to our advantage here. Just as thecomputers can access data from other factions, they can send data to otherfactions. If we sent the data you wished to rescue to every other faction,destroying it all would be impossible.”“When you say ‘we,’” I say, “are you implying that—”“That we would be going with you?” she says. “Obviously not all of us would go,but some of us must. How do you expect to navigate Erudite headquarters on yourown?”“You do realize that if you come with us, you might get shot,” says Christina.She smiles. “And no hiding behind us because you don’t want to break yourglasses, or whatever.”Cara removes her glasses and snaps them in half at the bridge.“We risked our lives by defecting from our faction,” says Cara, “and we willrisk them again to save our faction from itself.”“Also,” pipes up a small voice behind Cara. A girl no older than ten or elevenpeers around Cara’s elbow. Her black hair is short, like mine, and a halo offrizz surrounds her head. “We have useful gadgets.”Christina and I exchange a look.I say, “What kinds of gadgets?”“They’re just prototypes,” Fernando says, “so there’s no need to scrutinizethem.”“Scrutiny’s not really our thing,” says Christina.“Then how do you make things better?” the little girl asks.“We don’t, really,” Christina says, sighing. “They kind of just keep gettingworse.”The little girl nods. “Entropy.”“What?”“Entropy,” she chirps. “It’s the theory that all matter in the universe isgradually moving toward the same temperature. Also known as ‘heat death.’”“Elia,” Cara says, “that is a gross oversimplification.”Elia sticks out her tongue at Cara. I can’t help but laugh. I have never seenone of the Erudite stick out her tongue before. But then again, I haven’tinteracted with many young Erudite. Only Jeanine and the people who work forher. Including my brother.Fernando crouches next to one of the beds and takes out a box. He digs inside itfor a few seconds, then picks up a small, round disc. It is made of a pale metalthat I saw often in Erudite headquarters but have never seen anywhere else. Hecarries it toward me on his palm. When I reach for it, he jerks it away from me.“Careful!” he says. “I brought this from headquarters. It’s not something weinvented here. Were you there when they attacked Candor?”“Yes,” I say. “Right there.”“Remember when the glass shattered?”“Were you there?” I say, narrowing my eyes.“No. They recorded it and showed the footage at Erudite headquarters,” he says.“Well, it looked like the glass shattered because they shot at it, but that’snot really true. One of the Dauntless soldiers tossed one of these near thewindows. It emits a signal that you can’t hear, but that will cause glass toshatter.”“Okay,” I say. “And how will that be useful to us?”“You may find that it’s rather distracting for people when all their windowsshatter at once,” he says with a small smile. “Especially in Eruditeheadquarters, where there are a lot of windows.”“Right,” I say.“What else have you got?” says Christina.“The Amity will like this,” Cara says. “Where is it? Ah. Here.”She picks up a black box made of plastic, small enough for her to wrap herfingers around it. At the top of the box are two pieces of metal that look liketeeth. She flips a switch at the bottom of the box, and a thread of blue lightstretches across the gap between the teeth.“Fernando,” says Cara. “Want to demonstrate?”“Are you joking?” he says, his eyes wide. “I’m never doing that again. You’redangerous with that thing.”Cara grins at him, and explains, “If I touched you with this stunner right now,it would be extremely painful, and then it would disable you. Fernando foundthat out the hard way yesterday. I made it so that the Amity would have a way ofdefending themselves without shooting anyone.”“That’s …” I frown. “Understanding of you.”“Well, technology is supposed to make life better,” she says. “No matter whatyou believe, there’s a technology out there for you.”What did my mother say, in that simulation? “I worry that your father’sblustering about Erudite has been to your detriment.” What if she was right,even if she was just a part of a simulation? My father taught me to see Eruditea particular way. He never taught me that they made no judgments about whatpeople believed, but designed things for them within the confines of thosebeliefs. He never told me that they could be funny, or that they could critiquetheir own faction from the inside.Cara lunges toward Fernando with the stunner, laughing when he jumps back.He never told me that an Erudite could offer to help me even after I killed herbrother. The attack will begin in the afternoon, before it is too dark to see the bluearmbands that mark some of the Dauntless as traitors. As soon as our plans arefinalized, we walk through the orchard to the clearing where the trucks arekept. When I emerge from the trees, I see that Johanna Reyes is perched on thehood of one of the trucks, the keys dangling from her fingers.Behind her waits a small convoy of vehicles packed with Amity—but not justAmity, because Abnegation, with their severe hairstyles and still mouths, areamong them. Robert, Susan’s older brother, is with them.Johanna hops down from the hood. In the back of the truck she was just sittingon is a stack of crates marked APPLES and FLOUR and CORN. It’s a good thing weonly have to fit two people in the back.“Hello, Johanna,” says Marcus.“Marcus,” she says. “I hope you don’t mind if we accompany you to the city.”“Of course not,” he says. “Lead the way.”Johanna gives Marcus the keys and climbs into the bed of one of the othertrucks. Christina starts toward the truck cab, and I go for the truck bed, withFernando behind me.“You don’t want to sit up front?” says Christina. “And you call yourself aDauntless….”“I went for the part of the truck in which I was least likely to vomit,” I say.“Puking is a part of life.”I am about to ask her exactly how often she intends to throw up in the futurewhen the truck surges forward. I grab the side with both hands so that I don’tfall out, but after a few minutes, when I get used to the bumping and jostling,I let go. The other trucks trundle along in front of us, behind Johanna’s, whichleads the way.I feel calm until we reach the fence. I expect to encounter the same guards whotried to stop us on the way in, but the gate is abandoned, left open. A tremorstarts in my chest and spreads to my hands. In the midst of meeting new peopleand making plans, I forgot that my plan is to walk straight into a battle thatcould claim my life. Right after I realized that my life was worth living.The convoy slows down as we pass through the fence, like they expect someone tojump out and stop us. Everything is silent apart from the cicadas in the distanttrees and the truck engines.“Do you think it’s already started?” I say to Fernando.“Perhaps. Perhaps not,” he says. “Jeanine has many informants. Someone probablytold her that something was going to happen, so she called all the Dauntlessforces back to Erudite headquarters.”I nod, but I am really thinking of Caleb. He was one of those informants. Iwonder why he believed so strongly that the outside world should be hidden fromus that he would betray everyone he supposedly cared about for Jeanine, whocares about no one.“Did you ever meet someone named Caleb?” I say.“Caleb,” Fernando says. “Yes, there was a Caleb in my initiate class. Brilliant,but he was … what’s the colloquial term for it? A suck-up.” He smirks. “Therewas a bit of a division between initiates. Those who embraced everything Jeaninesaid and those who didn’t. Obviously I was a member of the latter group. Calebwas a member of the former. Why do you ask?”“I met him while I was imprisoned,” I say, and my voice sounds far away even tome. “I was just curious.”“I wouldn’t judge him too harshly,” says Fernando. “Jeanine can beextraordinarily persuasive to those who aren’t naturally suspicious. I havealways been naturally suspicious.”I stare over his left shoulder, at the skyline that gets clearer the closer weget to the city. I search for the two prongs at the top of the Hub, and when Ifind them, I feel better and worse at the same time—better, because the buildingis so familiar, and worse, because seeing the prongs means that we are gettingcloser.“Yeah,” I say. “So have I.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00031.jpg]BY THE TIME we reach the city, all conversation has halted in the truck,replaced by pressed lips and pale faces. Marcus steers around potholes the sizeof a person and parts from broken-down buses. The ride is smoother when we getout of factionless territory and into the clean parts of the city.Then I hear gunshots. From this distance they sound like popping.For a moment I am disoriented, and all I can see are the leaders of Abnegationon their knees on the pavement and the slack-faced Dauntless with guns in hand;all I can see is my mother turning to embrace the bullets, and Will dropping tothe ground. I bite my fist to keep from crying out, and the pain brings me backto the present.My mother told me to be brave. But if she had known that her death would make meso afraid, would she have sacrificed herself so willingly?Breaking away from the convoy of trucks, Marcus turns on Madison Avenue and,when we are just two blocks away from Michigan Avenue, where the fighting is, hepulls the truck into an alley and turns off the engine.Fernando hops out of the truck bed and offers me his arm.“Come on, Insurgent,” he says with a wink.“What?” I say. I take his arm and slide down the side of the truck.He opens the bag he was sitting with. It is full of blue clothes. He sortsthrough them, tossing garments to Christina and me. I get a bright blue T-shirtand a pair of blue jeans.“Insurgent,” he says. “Noun. A person who acts in opposition to the establishedauthority, who is not necessarily regarded as a belligerent.”“Do you need to give everything a name?” says Cara, running her hands over herdull blond hair to tuck the stray pieces back. “We’re just doing something andit happens to be in a group. No need for a new title.”“I happen to enjoy categorization,” Fernando replies, arching a dark eyebrow.I look at Fernando. The last time I broke into a faction’s headquarters, I didit with a gun in my hand, and I left bodies behind me. I want this time to bedifferent. I need this time to be different. “I like it,” I say. “Insurgent.It’s perfect.”“See?” Fernando says to Cara. “I’m not the only one.”“Congratulations,” she says wryly.I stare at my Erudite clothes while the others strip off their outer layers ofclothing.“No time for modesty, Stiff!” Christina says, giving me a pointed look.I know she’s right, so I pull off the red shirt I was wearing and put on theblue one instead. I glance at Fernando and Marcus to make sure they aren’twatching, and change out of my pants too. I have to roll up the jeans fourtimes, and when I belt them, they bunch at the top like the neck of a crushedpaper bag.“Did she just call you ‘Stiff’?” Fernando says.“Yeah,” I say. “I transferred into Dauntless from Abnegation.”“Huh.” He frowns. “That’s quite a shift. That kind of leap in personalitybetween generations is almost genetically impossible these days.”“Sometimes personality has nothing to do with a person’s choice of faction,” Isay, thinking of my mother. She left Dauntless not because she was ill-suitedfor it but because it was safer to be Divergent in Abnegation. And then there’sTobias, who switched to Dauntless to escape his father. “There are many factorsto consider.”To escape the man I have made my ally. I feel a twinge of guilt.“Keep talking like that and they’ll never discover you’re not really Erudite,”Fernando says.I run a comb through my hair to smooth it down and then tuck it behind my ears.“Here,” says Cara. She lifts a piece of hair from my face and pins it back witha silver hair clip, the way Erudite girls do.Christina takes out the guns we brought with us and looks at me.“Do you want one?” she says. “Or would you rather carry the stunner?”I stare at the gun in her hand. If I don’t take the stunner, I leave myselfcompletely undefended against people who will gladly shoot me. If I do, I admitto weakness in front of Fernando, Cara, and Marcus.“You know what Will would say?” says Christina.“What?” I say, my voice breaking.“He would tell you to get over it,” she says. “To stop being so irrational andtake the stupid gun.”Will had little patience for the irrational. Christina must be right; she knewhim better than I did.And she—who lost someone dear to her that day, just as I did—was able to forgiveme, an act that must have been nearly impossible. It would have been impossiblefor me, if the situation were reversed. So why is it so difficult for me toforgive myself?I close my hand around the gun Christina offered me. The metal is warm fromwhere she touched it. I feel the memory of shooting him poking at the back of mymind, and try to stifle it. But it won’t be stifled. I let go of the gun.“The stunner is a perfectly good option,” Cara says as she plucks a hair fromher shirtsleeve. “If you ask me, the Dauntless are too gun-happy anyway.”Fernando offers me the stunner. I wish I could communicate my gratitude to Cara,but she isn’t looking at me.“How am I going to conceal this thing?” I say.“Don’t bother,” Fernando says.“Right.”“We’d better go,” says Marcus, glancing at his watch.My heart beats so hard it marks each second for me, but the rest of me is numb.I can barely feel the ground. I have never been this afraid before, andconsidering all that I have seen in simulations, and all that I did during theattack simulation, that doesn’t make any sense.Or maybe it does. Whatever the Abnegation were about to show everyone before theattack, it was enough to make Jeanine take drastic and terrible measures to stopthem. And now I am about to finish their work, the work my old faction died for.So much more than my life is at stake now.Christina and I lead the way. We run down the clean, even sidewalks on MadisonAvenue, passing State Street, toward Michigan Avenue.Half a block from Erudite headquarters, I come to a sudden stop.Standing in four rows in front of us are a group of people, mostly dressed inblack and white, spaced two feet apart, guns held up and ready. I blink and theybecome simulation-controlled Dauntless in the Abnegation sector, during thesimulation attack. Get a grip! Get a grip get a grip get a grip…. I blink againand they are the Candor again—though some of them, dressed all in black, do looklike Dauntless. If I’m not careful I’ll lose touch with where, and when, I am.“Oh my God,” Christina says. “My sister, my parents … what if they …”She looks at me, and I think I know her thoughts, because I have experiencedthem before. Where are my parents? I have to find them. But if her parents arelike these Candor, simulation controlled and armed, there is nothing she can dofor them.I wonder if Lynn stands in one of these rows, somewhere else.“What do we do?” Fernando asks.I step toward the Candor. Maybe they aren’t programmed to shoot. I stare intothe glazed eyes of a woman in a white blouse and black slacks. She looks likeshe just came from work. I take another step.Bang. By instinct I drop to the ground, covering my head with my arms, andscramble backward, toward Fernando’s shoes. He helps me to my feet.“How about let’s not do that?” he says.I lean forward—not too far—and peer into the alley between the building next tous and Erudite headquarters. The Candor are in the alley too. I wouldn’t besurprised if there was a dense layer of Candor surrounding the entire complex ofErudite buildings.“Is there any other way to Erudite headquarters?” I say.“Not that I know of,” says Cara. “Unless you want to jump from one roof toanother.”She laughs a little as she says it, like it’s a joke. I raise my eyebrows ather.“Wait,” she says. “You aren’t considering—”“The roof?” I say. “No. Windows.”I walk to the left, careful not to advance even an inch toward the Candor. Thebuilding on my left overlaps with Erudite headquarters on its far left side.There have to be a few windows that face each other.Cara mutters something about crazy Dauntless stunts, but runs after me, andFernando, Marcus, and Christina follow. I try to open the back door of thebuilding, but it’s locked.Christina steps forward and says, “Stand back.” She points her gun at the lock.I shield my face with an arm as she fires. We hear a loud bang, and then a highringing, the aftereffects of firing a gun in such a close space. The lock isbroken.I pull the door open and walk inside. A long hallway with a tile floor greetsme, doors on either side, some open, some closed. When I look into the openrooms, I see rows of old desks, and chalkboards on the walls like the ones inDauntless headquarters. The air smells musty, like the pages of a library bookmixed with cleaning solution.“This used to be a commercial building,” says Fernando, “but Erudite convertedit into a school, for post-Choosing education. After the major renovations inErudite headquarters about a decade ago—you know, when all the buildings acrossfrom Millennium were connected?—they stopped teaching there. Too old, hard toupdate.”“Thanks for the history lesson,” says Christina.When I reach the end of the hallway, I walk into one of the classrooms to seewhere I am. I see the back of Erudite headquarters, but there are no windowsacross the alley at street level.Right outside the window, so close I could touch her if I stretched my handthrough the window, is a Candor child, a girl, holding a gun that is as long asher forearm. She stands so still I wonder if she is even breathing.I crane my neck to see the windows above street level. Over my head in theschool building there are plenty of windows. At the back of Eruditeheadquarters, there is only one that lines up. And it’s on the third story.“Good news,” I say. “I found a way across.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00004.jpg]EVERYONE SPREADS THROUGHOUT the building in search of janitor’s closets, per myinstruction to find a ladder. I hear sneakers squeaking on the tile and shoutsof “I found one—no, wait, it’s just got buckets in it, never mind” and “How longdoes the ladder have to be? A stepladder won’t work, right?”While they search, I find the third-floor classroom that looks into the Eruditewindow. It takes me three tries to open the right window.I lean out, over the alley, and shout, “Hey!” Then I duck as fast as I can. ButI don’t hear gunshots—Good, I think. They don’t respond to noise.Christina marches into the classroom with a ladder under her arm, the othersbehind her. “Got one! I think it’ll be long enough once we stretch it out.”She tries to turn too soon, and the ladder smacks into Fernando’s shoulder.“Oh! Sorry, Nando.”The jolt knocked his glasses askew. He smiles at Christina and takes the glassesoff, shoving them into his pocket.“Nando?” I say to him. “I thought the Erudite didn’t like nicknames?”“When a pretty girl calls you by a nickname,” he says, “it is only logical torespond to it.”Christina looks away, and at first I think she is bashful, but then I see herface contort like he slapped her instead of complimented her. It is too soonafter Will’s death for her to be flirted with.I help her guide the end of the ladder through the classroom window and acrossthe gap between buildings. Marcus helps us steady it. Fernando whoops when theladder hits the Erudite window across the alley.“Time to break the glass,” I say.Fernando takes the glass-breaking device from his pocket and offers it to me.“You probably have the best aim.”“I wouldn’t count on it,” I say. “My right arm is out of commission. I’d have tothrow with my left.”“I’ll do it,” says Christina.She presses the button on the side of the device and tosses it across the alley,underhand. I clench my hands as I wait for it to land. It bounces onto thewindowsill and rolls into the glass. An orange light flashes, and all at oncethe window—and the windows above, below, and next to it—shatters into hundredsof tiny pebbles that shower over the Candor below.At the same time, the Candor twist and fire up into the sky. Everyone else dropsto the ground, but I stay on my feet, part of me marveling at the perfectsynchronicity of it, and the other part disgusted at how Jeanine Matthews hasturned yet another faction from human beings into parts of a machine. None ofthe bullets even hit the classroom windows, let alone penetrate the room.When the Candor do not fire another round, I peer down at them. They havereturned to their original position, half facing Madison Avenue and half facingWashington Street.“They respond to movement only, so … don’t fall off the ladder,” I say. “Whoevergoes first will secure the ladder on the other side.”I notice that Marcus, who is supposed to selflessly offer himself up for everytask, does not volunteer.“Not feeling very Stiff today, Marcus?” says Christina.“If I were you, I would be careful who you insult,” he says. “I am still theonly person here who can find what we’re looking for.”“Is that a threat?”“I’ll go,” I say, before Marcus can answer. “I’m part Stiff too, right?”I shove the stunner under the waistband of my jeans and climb onto a desk to geta better angle on the window. Christina holds the ladder from the side as Iclamber on top of it and start forward.Once I’m through the window, I position my feet on the narrow edges of theladder and my hands on the rungs. The ladder feels about as solid and stable asan aluminum can. It creaks and sags beneath my weight. I try not to look down atthe Candor; try not to think about their guns lifting and firing at me.Taking quick breaths, I stare at my destination, the Erudite window. Just a fewrungs left.A breeze blows through the alley, pushing me to one side, and I think of scalingthe Ferris wheel with Tobias. He kept me steady then. There is no one left tokeep me steady now.I catch a glimpse of the ground, three stories down, the bricks smaller thanthey should be, the lines of Candor Jeanine enslaved. My arms—especially myright arm—ache as I inch my way across the gap.The ladder shifts, moving closer to the edge of the window frame on the otherside. Christina is holding one side steady, but she can’t keep the ladder fromslipping off the other windowsill. I grit my teeth and try not to move it toomuch, but I can’t move both legs at the same time. I have to let the ladder swaya little. Just four more rungs to go.The ladder jerks to the left, and then, as I move my right foot forward, I missthe edge of the rung.I yell as my body shifts to the side, my arms wrapping around the ladder and myleg dangling in space.“Are you okay?” Christina calls from behind me.I don’t answer. I bring my leg up and wedge it beneath my body. My fall made theladder slip even farther off the windowsill. It is now supported by just amillimeter of concrete.I decide to move fast. I lurch toward the opposite windowsill just as the ladderslips off. My hands catch the sill and concrete scrapes my fingertips as theybear my body weight. Several voices behind me scream.I grit my teeth as I pull myself up, my right shoulder shrieking with pain. Ikick at the brick building, hoping it will give me traction, but it doesn’thelp. I scream into my teeth as I pull myself up and over the windowsill, halfmy body in the building and the other half still dangling. Thankfully Christinadidn’t let the ladder drop too far. None of the Candor shoot me.I pull myself into the Erudite room across the alley. It is a bathroom. Icollapse to the floor on my left shoulder, and try to breathe through the pain.Sweat trickles down my forehead.An Erudite woman comes out of a stall, and I scramble to my feet, draw thestunner, and point it at her, all without thinking.She freezes, her arms up, toilet paper stuck to her shoe.“Don’t shoot!” Her eyes bulge from her head.I remember, then, that I am dressed like the Erudite. I set the stunner on theedge of a sink.“My apologies,” I say. I try to adopt the formal speech common to the Erudite.“I am slightly edgy, with everything that’s occurring. We are reentering inorder to retrieve some of our test results from … Laboratory 4-A.”“Oh,” the woman says. “That seems rather unwise.”“The data is of the utmost importance,” I say, trying to sound as arrogant assome of the Erudite I’ve met. “I would rather not leave it to get riddled withbullets.”“It’s hardly my place to prevent you from trying to recover it,” she says. “Nowif you’ll excuse me, I’m going to wash my hands and take cover.”“Sounds good,” I say. I decide not to tell her she has toilet paper on her shoe.I turn back to the window. Across the alley, Christina and Fernando are tryingto lift the ladder back onto the windowsill. Though my arms and hands ache, Ilean out the window and grab the other end of the ladder, lifting it back ontothe windowsill. Then I hold it in place as Christina crawls across.This time the ladder is more stable, and Christina makes it across the gapwithout trouble. She takes my place holding it as I shove the trash can in frontof the door so no one else can come in. I then run my fingers under cool waterto soothe them.“This is pretty smart, Tris,” she says.“You don’t have to sound so surprised.”“It’s just …” She pauses. “You had aptitude for Erudite, didn’t you?”“Does it matter?” I say too sharply. “The factions are destroyed, and it was allstupid to begin with.”I have never said anything like that before. I have never even thought it. ButI’m surprised to find that I believe it—surprised to find that I agree withTobias.“I wasn’t trying to insult you,” says Christina. “Having aptitude for Eruditeisn’t a bad thing. Especially right now.”“Sorry. I’m just … tense. That’s all.”Marcus comes through the window and drops to the tile floor. Cara issurprisingly nimble—she moves over the rungs like she’s plucking banjo strings,touching each one only briefly before she moves to the next one.Fernando will be last, and he will be in the same position I was in, with theladder secured from only one side. I move closer to the window so I can tell himto stop if I see the ladder slip.Fernando, who I didn’t think would have trouble, moves more awkwardly thananyone else. He has probably spent his entire life behind a computer or a book.He shuffles forward, his face bright red, and holds the rungs so tightly thathis hands turn blotchy and purple.Halfway across the alley, I see something slip out of his pocket. It is hisspectacles.I scream, “Fernan—”But I am too late.The spectacles fall, hit the edge of the ladder, and topple to the pavement.In a wave, the Candor below twist and fire upward. Fernando yells, and collapsesagainst the ladder. One bullet hit his leg. I didn’t see where the others went,but I know when I see blood drip between the rungs of the ladder that it was nota good place.Fernando stares at Christina, his face ashen. Christina surges forward, throughthe window, about to reach for him.“Don’t be an idiot!” he says, his voice weak. “Leave me.”It is the last thing he says."},{"pageContent":"[images/00034.jpg]CHRISTINA STEPS BACK into the room. We are all still.“I don’t mean to be insensitive,” says Marcus, “but we have to go before theDauntless and factionless enter this building. If they haven’t already.”I hear tapping against the window and jerk my head to the side, for a splitsecond believing that it is Fernando, trying to get in. But it’s just rain.We follow Cara out of the bathroom. She is our leader now. She knows Eruditeheadquarters best. Christina follows, then Marcus, then me. We leave thebathroom, and we are in an Erudite hallway like every other Erudite hallway:pale, bright, sterile.But this hallway is more active than I have ever seen it. People in Erudite bluesprint back and forth, in groups and alone, shouting things at each other like,“They’re at the front doors! Go as high as you can!” and “They’ve disabled theelevators! Run for the stairs!” It’s only there, in the midst of chaos, that Irealize I forgot the stunner in the bathroom. I am unarmed again.Dauntless traitors also run past us, though they are less frantic than theErudite. I wonder what Johanna, the Amity, and the Abnegation are doing in thischaos. Are they tending to the wounded? Or are they standing between Dauntlessguns and Erudite innocents, taking bullets for the sake of peace?I shudder. Cara leads us to a back staircase, and we join a group of terrifiedErudite as we run up one, two, three flights of stairs. Then Cara shoves hershoulder into a door next to the landing, holding her gun close to her chest.I recognize this floor.It is my floor.My thoughts become sluggish. I almost died here. I craved death here.I slow down and fall behind. I can’t break out of the daze, though people keeprushing past me, and Marcus shouts something at me, but his voice is muffled.Christina doubles back and grabs me, dragging me toward Control-A.Inside the control room, I see rows of computers but I don’t really see them;there is a film covering my eyes. I try to blink it away. Marcus sits at one ofthe computers, and Cara sits at another. They will send all the data from theErudite computers to the other faction computers.Behind me, the door opens.And I hear Caleb say, “What are you doing here?” His voice wakes me. I turn and stare right at his gun.His eyes are my mother’s eyes—a dull green, almost gray, though his blue shirtmakes their color appear more potent.“Caleb,” I say. “What do you think you’re doing?”“I’m here to stop whatever you’re doing!” His voice trembles. The gun wavers inhis hands.“We’re here to save the Erudite data that the factionless want to destroy,” Isay. “I don’t think you want to stop us.”“That’s not true,” he says. He jerks his head toward Marcus. “Why would youbring him if you weren’t trying to find something else? Something more importantto him than all the Erudite data combined?”“She told you about it?” Marcus says. “You, a child?”“She didn’t tell me at first,” Caleb says. “But she didn’t want me to choose aside without knowing the facts!”“The facts,” says Marcus, “are that she is terrified of reality, and theAbnegation were not. Are not. And neither is your sister. To her credit.”I scowl. Even when he is complimenting me, I want to smack him.“My sister,” says Caleb gently, looking at me again, “doesn’t know what she’sgetting into. Doesn’t know what it is that you want to show everyone … doesn’tknow it will ruin everything!”“We are here to serve a purpose!” Marcus is almost yelling now. “We havecompleted our mission, and it is time for us to do what we were sent here todo!”I don’t know the purpose or the mission that Marcus is referring to, but Calebdoesn’t look confused.“We were not sent here,” Caleb says. “We have no responsibility to anyone butourselves.”“That kind of self-interested thinking is what I have come to expect from thosewho have spent too much time with Jeanine Matthews. You are so unwilling torelinquish your comfort that your selfishness drains you of humanity!”I don’t care to hear more. While Caleb stares down Marcus, I turn and kick hardat Caleb’s wrist. The impact shocks him, and his gun topples from his hands. Islide it across the floor with my toes.“You need to trust me, Beatrice,” he says, chin wobbling.“After you helped her torture me? After you let her almost kill me?”“I didn’t help her tort—”“You certainly didn’t stop her! You were right there, and you just watched—”“What could I have done? What—”“You could have tried, you coward!” I scream so loud my face gets hot and tearsjump into my eyes. “Tried, and failed, because you love me!”I gasp, just to take in enough air. All I hear is the click of keys as Caraworks on the task at hand. Caleb doesn’t seem to have a response. His pleadinglook slowly disappears, replaced by a blank stare.“You won’t find what you’re looking for here,” he says. “She wouldn’t keep suchimportant files on public computers. That would be illogical.”“So she hasn’t destroyed it?” Marcus says.Caleb shakes his head. “She does not believe in the destruction of information.Only its containment.”“Well, thank God for that,” says Marcus. “Where is she keeping it?”“I’m not going to tell you,” Caleb says.“I think I know,” I say. Caleb said she wouldn’t keep the information on apublic computer. So he must mean she is keeping it on a private one: either theone in her office or the one in the laboratory Tori told me about.Caleb doesn’t look at me.Marcus picks up Caleb’s revolver and turns it in his hand so the butt of the gunprotrudes from his fist. Then he swings, striking Caleb under the jaw. Caleb’seyes roll back, and he falls to the floor.I don’t want to know how Marcus perfected that maneuver.“We can’t have him running off to tell someone what we’re doing,” says Marcus.“Let’s go. Cara can take care of the rest, right?”Cara nods without looking up from her computer. A sick feeling in my stomach, Ifollow Marcus and Christina out of the control room and toward the stairs. The hallway outside is now empty. There are scraps of paper and footprints onthe tile. Marcus, Christina, and I jog in a line to the stairwell. I stare atthe back of his head, where the shape of his skull shows through his buzzedhair.All I can see when I look at him is a belt swinging toward Tobias, and the buttof a gun slamming into Caleb’s jaw. I don’t care that he hurt Caleb—I would havedone it, too—but that he is simultaneously a man who knows how to hurt peopleand a man who parades around as the self-effacing leader of Abnegation, suddenlymakes me so angry I can’t see straight.Especially because I chose him. I chose him over Tobias.“Your brother is a traitor,” says Marcus as we turn a corner. “He deservedworse. There’s no need to look at me that way.”“Shut up!” I shout, shoving him hard into the wall. He is too surprised to pushback. “I hate you, you know that! I hate you for what you did to him, and I amnot talking about Caleb.” I lean close to his face and whisper, “And while I maynot shoot you myself, I will definitely not help you if someone tries to killyou, so you’d better hope to God we don’t get into that situation.”He stares at me, apparently indifferent. I release him and start toward thestairs again, Christina on my heels, Marcus a few steps behind.“Where are we going?” she says.“Caleb said what we’re looking for won’t be on a public computer, so it has tobe on a private one. As far as I know, Jeanine only has two private computers,one in her office, and one in her laboratory,” I say.“So which one do we go to?”“Tori told me there were insane security measures protecting Jeanine’slaboratory,” I say. “And I’ve been to her office; it’s just another room.”“So … laboratory, then.”“Top floor.”We reach the door to the stairwell, and when I throw it open, a group ofErudite, including children, are sprinting down the stairs. I cling to therailing and force my way through them with my elbow, not looking at their faces,like they are not human, just a wall of mass to push aside.I expect the stream to stop, but more come from the next landing, a steady flowof blue-clad people in dim blue light, the whites of their eyes bright as lampsby contrast to everything else. Their terrified sobs echo in the cement chambera hundred times, the shrieks of the demons with glowing eyes.When we reach the seventh-floor landing, the crowd thins, and then disappears. Irun my hands along my arms to get rid of the ghosts of hair, sleeves, and skinthat brushed against me on the way up. I can see the top of the stairs fromwhere we stand.I also see the body of a guard, his arm dangling over the edge of a stair, andstanding over him, a factionless man with an eye patch.Edward. “Look who it is,” Edward says. He stands at the top of a short flight, onlyseven steps long, and I stand at the bottom. The Dauntless traitor guard liesbetween us, his eyes glazed, a dark patch on his chest from wheresomeone—Edward, probably—shot him.“That’s a strange outfit for someone who is supposed to despise Erudite,” hesays. “I thought you were supposed to be at home, waiting for your boyfriend tocome back a hero?”“As you may have gathered,” I say, walking up a step, “that was never going tohappen.”The blue light casts shadows into the faint hollows beneath Edward’s cheekbones.He reaches behind him.If he is here, that means Tori is already up here. Which means that Jeaninemight already be dead.I feel Christina close behind me; I hear her breaths.“We are going to get past you,” I say, walking up another step.“I doubt that,” he replies. He grabs his gun. I launch myself forward, over thefallen guard. He fires, but my hands are wrapped around his wrist, so he doesn’tfire straight.My ears ring, and my feet scramble for stability on the dead guard’s back.Christina punches over my head. Her knuckles connect with Edward’s nose. I can’tbalance on top of the body; I fall to my knees, digging my fingernails into hiswrist. He wrenches me to the side and fires again, hitting Christina in the leg.Gasping, Christina draws her gun and shoots. The bullet hits him in the side.Edward screams and drops the gun, pitching forward. He falls on top of me, and Ismack my head against one of the cement steps. The dead guard’s arm is jammedinto my spine.Marcus picks up Edward’s gun and trains it on both of us.“Get up, Tris,” he says. And to Edward: “You. Don’t move.”My hand searches for the corner of a step, and I squeeze from between Edward andthe dead guard. Edward pushes himself to a sitting position on top of theguard—like he’s some kind of cushion—clutching his side with both hands.“You okay?” I ask Christina.Her face contorts. “Ahh. Yeah. It hit the side, not the bone.”I reach for her, to help her up.“Beatrice,” Marcus says. “We have to leave her.”“What do you mean leave?” I demand. “We can’t leave! Something terrible couldhappen!”Marcus presses his index finger to my sternum, in the gap between mycollarbones, and leans over me.“Listen to me,” he says. “Jeanine Matthews will have retreated to her laboratoryat the first sign of attack, because it is the safest room in this building. Andat any moment, she will decide that Erudite is lost and it is better to deletethe data than risk anyone else finding it, and this mission of ours will beuseless.”And I will have lost everyone: my parents, Caleb, and finally, Tobias, who willnever forgive me for working with his father, especially if I have no way toprove that it was worthwhile.“We are going to leave your friend here.” His breath smells stale. “And move on,unless you would rather me go on alone.”“He’s right,” says Christina. “There’s no time. I’ll stay here and keep Ed fromcoming after you.”I nod. Marcus removes his finger, leaving an aching circle behind. I rub thepain away and open the door at the top of the landing. I look back before I walkthrough it, and Christina gives me a pained smile, her hand pressed to herthigh."},{"pageContent":"[images/00006.jpg]THE NEXT ROOM is more like a hallway: it is wide, but not deep, with blue tile,blue walls, and a blue ceiling, all the same shade. Everything glows, but Ican’t tell where the light is coming from.At first I don’t see any doors, but once my eyes adjust to the shock of color, Isee a rectangle in the wall to my left, and another one in the wall to my right.Just two doors.“We have to split up,” I say. “We don’t have time to try each one together.”“Which one do you want?” Marcus says.“Right,” I say. “Wait, no. Left.”“Fine. I will go right.”“If I’m the one who finds the computer,” I say, “what should I look for?”“If you find the computer, you will find Jeanine. I assume you know a few waysto coerce her into doing what you want. She is not, after all, accustomed topain,” he says.I nod. We walk at the same pace toward our respective doors. A moment ago Iwould have said that separating from Marcus would be a relief. But going onalone is its own burden. What if I can’t get through the security measuresJeanine undoubtedly has in place to keep out intruders? What if, if I somehowmanage to get through them, I can’t find the right file?I put my hand on the door handle. There doesn’t seem to be a lock. When Torisaid there were insane security measures, I thought she meant eye scanners andpasswords and locks, but so far, everything has been open.Why does that worry me?I open my door, and Marcus opens his. We share a look. I walk into the nextroom. The room, like the hallway outside, is blue, though here it is clear where thelight is coming from. It glows from the center of every panel, ceiling, floor,and walls.Once the door closes behind me, I hear a thud like a dead bolt shifting intoplace. I grab the door handle again and push down as hard as I can, but itdoesn’t budge. I am trapped.Small, piercing lights come at me from all angles. My eyelids aren’t enough toblock them, so I have to press my palms over my eye sockets.I hear a calm, feminine voice:“Beatrice Prior, second generation. Faction of origin: Abnegation. Selectedfaction: Dauntless. Confirmed Divergent.”How does this room know who I am?And what does “second generation” mean?“Status: Intruder.”I hear a click, and pull my fingers apart just enough to see if the lights aregone. They aren’t, but fixtures in the ceiling spray tinted vapor. InstinctivelyI clap my hand over my mouth. In seconds I stare through a blue fog. And then Istare at nothing.I now stand in darkness so complete that when I hold my hand in front of mynose, I can’t even see its silhouette. I should walk forward and search for adoor on the other side of the room, but I am afraid to move—who knows what wouldhappen to me here if I did?Then the lights lift, and I stand in the Dauntless training room, in the circlein which we used to spar. I have so many mixed memories of this circle, sometriumphant, like beating Molly, and some haunting—Peter punching me until I fellunconscious. I sniff, and the air smells the same, like sweat and dust.Across the circle is a blue door that doesn’t belong there. I frown at it.“Intruder,” the voice says, and now it sounds like Jeanine, but that could be myimagination. “You have five minutes to reach the blue door before the poisonwill kick in.”“What?”But I know what she said. Poison. Five minutes. I shouldn’t be surprised; thisis Jeanine’s work, just as empty of conscience as she is. My body shudders, andI wonder if that is the poison, if the poison is already shutting down my brain.Focus. I can’t get out; I have to move forward, or …Or nothing. I have to move forward.I start toward the door, and someone appears in my path. She is short, thin, andblond, with dark circles under her eyes. She is me.A reflection? I wave at her to see if she will mirror me. She doesn’t.“Hello,” I say. She doesn’t answer. I didn’t really think she would.What is this? I swallow hard to pop my ears, which feel like they are stuffedwith cotton. If Jeanine designed this, it is probably a test of intelligence orlogic, which means I will have to think clearly, which means I will have to calmdown. I clasp my hands over my chest and press down, hoping the pressure willmake me feel safe, like an embrace.It doesn’t.I step to the right to get a better angle on the door, and my double hops to theside, her shoes scraping the dirt, to block my way again.I think I know what will happen if I start toward the door, but I have to try. Ibreak into a run, intending to swerve around her, but she is ready for me: shegrabs my wounded shoulder and wrenches me to the side. I scream so loud itscrapes my throat; I feel like knives are stabbing deeper and deeper into myright side. As I begin to sink to my knees, she kicks me in the stomach and Isprawl across the floor, inhaling dust.That, I realize as I clutch my stomach, is exactly what I would have done if Ihad been in her position. Which means that in order to defeat her, I have tothink of a way to defeat myself. And how can I be a better fighter than myself,if she knows the same strategies I know, and is exactly as resourceful andclever as I am?She starts toward me again, so I scramble to my feet and try to put aside thepain in my shoulder. My heart beats faster. I want to punch her, but she getsthere first. I duck at the last second, and her fist hits my ear, knocking meoff balance.I back up a few steps, hoping that she won’t pursue me, but she does. She comesat me again, this time seizing my shoulders and pulling me down, toward her bentknee.I put my hands up, between my stomach and her knee, and push as hard as I can.She was not expecting that; she stumbles back, but doesn’t fall.I run at her, and as the desire to kick her slips into my mind, I realize thatit is also her desire. I twist away from her foot.The second I want something, she also wants it. She and I can only be, at best,at a standstill—but I need to beat her to get through the door. To survive.I try to think it through, but she is coming at me again, her forehead tightenedinto a scowl of concentration. She grabs my arm, and I grab hers, so that we areclutched forearm to forearm.At the same time, we yank our elbows back and thrust them forward. I lean in atthe last second, and my elbow smashes into her teeth.Both of us cry out. Blood spills over her lip, and runs down my forearm. Shegrits her teeth and yells, diving at me, stronger than I anticipated.Her weight knocks me down. She pins me to the floor with her knees and tries topunch my face, but I cross my arms in front of me. Her fists hit my armsinstead, each one like a stone striking my skin.With a heavy exhale, I grab at one of her wrists, and I notice that spots aredancing at the corners of my eyes. Poison.Focus.As she struggles to free herself, I bring my knee up to my chest. Then I pushher back, grunting with effort, until I can press my foot to her stomach. I kickher, my face boiling hot.The logical puzzle: In a fight between two perfect equals, how can one win?The answer: One can’t.She pushes herself to her feet and wipes the blood from her lip.Therefore: we must not be perfectly equal. So what is different about us?She walks toward me again, but I need more time to think, so for every step shetakes forward, I take back. The room sways, and then twists, and I lurch to theside, brushing my fingertips on the ground to steady myself.What is different about us? We have the same mass, skill level, patterns ofthinking …I see the door over her shoulder, and I realize: We have different goals. I haveto get through that door. She has to protect it. But even in a simulation, thereis no way she is as desperate as I am.I sprint toward the edge of the circle, where there is a table. A moment ago, itwas empty, but I know the rules of simulations and how to control them. A gunappears on it as soon as I think it.I slam into the table, the spots crowding my view of it. I don’t even feel painwhen I collide with it. I feel my heartbeat in my face, like my heart hasdetached from its moorings in my chest and begun to migrate to my brain.Across the room, a gun appears on the ground before my double. We both reach forour weapons.I feel the weight of the gun, and its smoothness, and I forget about her; Iforget about the poison; I forget about everything.My throat constricts, and I feel like there is a hand around it, tightening. Myhead throbs from the sudden loss of air, and I feel my heartbeat everywhere,everywhere.Across the room, it’s no longer my double who stands between me and my goal;it’s Will. No, no. It can’t be Will. I force myself to breathe in. The poison iscutting off oxygen to my brain. He is just a hallucination within a simulation.I exhale in a sob.For a moment I see my double again, holding the gun but visibly shuddering, theweapon as far out from her body as she can possibly hold it. She is as weak as Iam. No, not as weak, because she is not going blind and losing air, but almostas weak, almost.Then Will is back, his eyes simulation-dead, his hair a yellow halo around hishead. Brick buildings loom from each side, but behind him is the door, the doorthat separates me from my father and brother.No, no, it is the door that separates me from Jeanine and my goal.I have to get through that door. I have to.I lift the gun, though it hurts my shoulder to do it, and wrap one hand aroundthe other to steady it.“I …” I choke, and tears smear my cheeks, run into my mouth. I taste salt. “I’msorry.”And I do the one thing my double is unable to do, because she is not desperateenough:I fire."},{"pageContent":"[images/00008.jpg]I DON’T SEE him die again.I close my eyes at the moment the trigger presses back, and when I open them, itis the other Tris who lies on the ground between the dark patches in my vision;it is me.I drop the gun and sprint toward the door, almost tripping over her. I throw mybody against the door, twist the handle, and fall through. My hands numb, Ipress it closed behind me, and shake them to regain feeling.The next room is twice as big as the first one, and it, too, is blue-lit, butpaler. A large table stands in the middle, and taped to the walls arephotographs, diagrams, and lists.I take deep breaths, and my vision begins to clear, my heart rate returning tonormal. Among the photographs on the walls, I recognize my own face, andTobias’s, and Marcus’s, and Uriah’s. A long list of what appear to be chemicalsis posted on the wall beside our pictures. Each one is crossed out with redmarker. This must be where Jeanine develops the simulation serums.I hear voices somewhere ahead of me, and scold myself. What are you doing?Hurry!“My brother’s name,” I hear. “I want to hear you say it.”Tori’s voice.How did she get through that simulation? Is she Divergent too?“I didn’t kill him.” Jeanine’s voice.“Do you think that exonerates you? Do you think that means you don’t deserve todie?”Tori is not screaming, but wailing, the whole of her grief escaping through hermouth. I start toward the door. Too quickly, though, because my hip slams intothe corner of the table in the middle of the room, and I have to stop, wincing.“The reasons for my actions are beyond your understanding,” Jeanine says. “I waswilling to make a sacrifice for the greater good, something you have neverunderstood, not even when we were classmates!”I limp toward the door, which is a pane of frosted glass. It slides back toadmit me, and I see Jeanine, pressed against a wall, with Tori standing a fewfeet away, her gun high.Behind them is a glass table with a silver box on it—a computer—and a keyboard.The entire far wall is covered with a computer screen.Jeanine stares at me, but Tori doesn’t move an inch; doesn’t seem to hear me.Her face is red and tear-streaked, her hand shaking.I have no confidence that I can find the video file on my own. If Jeanine ishere, I can get her to find it for me, but if she’s dead …“No!” I scream. “Tori, don’t!”But her finger is already over the trigger. I launch myself at her as hard as Ican, my arms slamming into her side. The gun goes off, and I hear a scream.My head hits the tile. I ignore the stars in my eyes and throw myself acrossTori. I shove the gun forward and it slides away from us.Why didn’t you grab it, you idiot?!Tori’s fist connects with the side of my throat. I choke, and she uses theopportunity to throw me off, to crawl toward the gun.Jeanine is slumped against the wall, blood soaking her leg. Leg! I remember, andpunch Tori hard near the bullet wound in her thigh. She yells, and I find myfeet.I step toward the fallen weapon, but Tori is too quick. She wraps her armsaround my legs and pulls them out from under me. My knees slam into the ground,but I am still above her; I punch down, at her rib cage.She groans, but it doesn’t stop her; as I drag myself toward the gun, she sinksher teeth into my hand. It is a different pain than any blow I’ve ever received,different even from a bullet wound. I scream louder than I thought possible,tears blurring my vision.I have not come this far to let Tori shoot Jeanine before I’ve gotten what Ineed.I yank my hand from between her teeth, my vision going black at the edges, andwith a lurch, smack my hand around the handle of the gun. I twist, and point itat Tori.My hand. My hand is covered in blood, and so is Tori’s chin. I hide my hand fromview so that it’s easier to ignore the pain and get up, still pointing the gunat her.“I didn’t take you for a traitor, Tris,” she says, and it sounds like a snarl,not a sound any human can make.“I’m not,” I say. I blink the tears down my cheeks so that I can see her better.“I can’t explain it right now, but … all I’m asking is for you to trust me,please. There’s something important, something only she knows the location of—”“That’s right!” says Jeanine. “It is on that computer, Beatrice, and only I canlocate it. If you don’t help me survive this, it will die with me.”“She is a liar,” says Tori. “A liar, and if you believe her, you are both anidiot and a traitor, Tris!”“I do believe her,” I say. “I believe her because it makes perfect sense! Themost sensitive information that exists and it’s hidden on that computer, Tori!”I take a deep breath, and lower my voice. “Please listen to me. I hate her asmuch as you do. I have no reason to defend her. I’m telling you the truth. Thisis important.”Tori is silent. I think, for a moment, that I’ve won, that I’ve persuaded her.But then she says, “Nothing is more important than her death.”“If that’s what you insist upon believing,” I say, “I can’t help you. But I’malso not going to let you kill her.”Tori pushes herself to her knees, and wipes my blood from her chin. She looks upinto my eyes.“I am a Dauntless leader,” she says. “You don’t get to decide what I do.”And before I can think—Before I can even think about firing the gun I’m holding—She draws a long knife from the side of her boot, lunges, and stabs Jeanine inthe stomach.I yell. Jeanine releases a horrible sound—a gurgling, screaming, dying sound. Isee Tori’s gritted teeth, I hear her murmur her brother’s name—“Jonathan Wu”—andthen I watch the knife go in again.And Jeanine’s eyes turn into glass."},{"pageContent":"[images/00020.jpg]TORI STANDS, A wild look in her eyes, and turns toward me.I feel numb.All the risks I took to get here—conspiring with Marcus, asking the Erudite forhelp, crawling across a ladder three stories up, shooting myself in asimulation—and all the sacrifices I made—my relationship with Tobias, Fernando’slife, my standing among the Dauntless—were for nothing.Nothing.A moment later, the glass door opens again. Tobias and Uriah storm in as if tofight a battle—Uriah coughing, probably from the poison—but the battle is done.Jeanine is dead, Tori is triumphant, and I am a Dauntless traitor.Tobias stops in the middle of a step, almost stumbling over his feet, when hesees me. His eyes open wider.“She is a traitor,” says Tori. “She just almost shot me to defend Jeanine.”“What?” says Uriah. “Tris, what’s going on? Is she right? Why are you evenhere?”But I look only at Tobias. A sliver of hope pierces me, strangely painful, whencombined with the guilt I feel for how I deceived him. Tobias is stubborn andproud, but he is mine—maybe he will listen, maybe there’s a chance that all Idid was not in vain—“You know why I’m here,” I say quietly. “Don’t you?”I hold out Tori’s gun. He walks forward, a little unsteady on his feet, andtakes it.“We found Marcus in the next room, caught in a simulation,” Tobias says. “Youcame up here with him.”“Yes, I did,” I say, blood from Tori’s bite trickling down my arm.“I trusted you,” he says, his body shaking with rage. “I trusted you and youabandoned me to work with him?”“No.” I shake my head. “He told me something, and everything my brother said,everything Jeanine said while I was in Erudite headquarters, fit perfectly withwhat he told me. And I wanted—I needed to know the truth.”“The truth.” He snorts. “You think you learned the truth from a liar, a traitor,and a sociopath?”“The truth?” says Tori. “What are you talking about?”Tobias and I stare at each other. His blue eyes, usually so thoughtful, are nowhard and critical, like they are peeling back layer after layer of me andsearching each one.“I think,” I say. I have to pause and take a breath, because I have notconvinced him; I have failed, and this is probably the last thing they will letme say before they arrest me.“I think that you are the liar!” I say, my voice quaking. “You tell me you loveme, you trust me, you think I’m more perceptive than the average person. And thefirst second that belief in my perceptiveness, that trust, that love is put tothe test, it all falls apart.” I am crying now, but I am not ashamed of thetears shining on my cheeks or the thickness of my voice. “So you must have liedwhen you told me all those things … you must have, because I can’t believe yourlove is really that feeble.”I step closer to him, so that there are only inches between us, and none of theothers can hear me.“I am still the person who would have died rather than kill you,” I say,remembering the attack simulation and the feel of his heartbeat under my hand.“I am exactly who you think I am. And right now, I’m telling you that I know … Iknow this information will change everything. Everything we have done, andeverything we are about to do.”I stare at him like I can communicate the truth with my eyes, but that isimpossible. He looks away, and I’m not sure he even heard what I said.“Enough of this,” says Tori. “Take her downstairs. She will be tried along withall the other war criminals.”Tobias doesn’t move. Uriah takes my arm and leads me away from him, through thelaboratory, through the room of light, through the blue hallway. Therese of thefactionless joins us there, eyeing me curiously.Once we’re in the stairwell, I feel something nudge my side. When I look back, Isee a wad of gauze in Uriah’s hand. I take it, trying to give him a gratefulsmile and failing.As we descend the stairs, I wrap the gauze tightly around my hand, sidesteppingbodies without looking at their faces. Uriah takes my elbow to keep me fromfalling. The gauze wrapping doesn’t help with the pain of the bite, but it makesme feel a little better, and so does the fact that Uriah, at least, doesn’t seemto hate me.For the first time the Dauntless’s disregard for age does not seem like anopportunity. It seems like the thing that will condemn me. They will not say,But she’s young; she must have been confused. They will say, She is an adult,and she made her choice.Of course, I agree with them. I did make my choice. I chose my mother andfather, and what they fought for. Walking down the stairs is easier than going up. We reach the fifth level beforeI realize that we’re going down to the lobby.“Give me your gun, Uriah,” says Therese. “Someone needs to be able to shootpotential belligerents, and you can’t do it if you’re keeping her from fallingdown the stairs.”Uriah surrenders his gun without question. I frown—Therese already has a gun, sowhy did it matter for him to give his? But I don’t ask. I am in enough troubleas it is.We reach the bottom floor and walk past a large meeting room full of peopledressed in black and white. I pause for a moment to watch them. Some of them arehuddled in small groups, leaning on one another, tears streaking their faces.Others are alone, leaning against walls or sitting in corners, their eyes hollowor staring at something that is far away.“We had to shoot so many,” Uriah mutters, squeezing my arm. “Just to get intothe building, we had to.”“I know,” I say.I see Christina’s sister and mother clutched together on the right side of theroom. And on the left side, a young man with dark hair that gleams in thefluorescent light—Peter. His hand is on the shoulder of a middle-aged woman Irecognize as his mother.“What is he doing here?” I say.“Little coward came in the aftermath, after all the work was done,” Uriah says.“I heard his dad’s dead. Looks like his mother’s okay, though.”Peter looks over his shoulder, and his gaze meets mine, just for a second. Inthat second I try to summon some pity for the person who saved my life. Butwhile the hatred I once had for him is gone, I still feel nothing.“What’s the holdup?” demands Therese. “Let’s get going.”We walk past the meeting room to the main lobby, where I once embraced Caleb.The giant portrait of Jeanine is in pieces on the floor. The smoke that hoversin the air is condensed around the bookshelves, which are burned to cinders. Allthe computers are in pieces, strewn across the floor.Sitting in rows in the center of the room are some of the Erudite who didn’t getaway, and the Dauntless traitors who survived. I search the faces for anythingfamiliar. I find Caleb near the back, looking dazed. I look away.“Tris!” I hear. Christina sits near the front, next to Cara, her leg wrappedtightly with fabric. She beckons to me, and I sit down next to her.“No success?” she says quietly.I shake my head.She sighs, and puts her arm around me. The gesture is so comforting I almoststart to cry. But Christina and I are not people who cry together; we’re peoplewho fight together. So I hold my tears in.“I saw your mom and your sister in the next room,” I say.“Yeah, me too,” she says. “My family is okay.”“Good,” I say. “How’s your leg?”“Fine. Cara said it’ll be fine; it’s not bleeding too much. One of the Eruditenurses stuffed some pain meds and antiseptic and gauze into her pockets beforethey took her down here, so it doesn’t hurt too bad either,” she says. Besideher, Cara is examining another Erudite’s arm. “Where’s Marcus?”“Dunno,” I say. “We had to split up. He should be down here. Unless they killedhim or something.”“I wouldn’t be that surprised, honestly,” she says.The room is chaotic for a while—people rushing in and rushing out again, ourfactionless guards trading places, new people in Erudite blue brought to sitamong us—but gradually everything gets quieter, and then I see him: Tobias,walking through the stairwell door.I bite my lip, hard, and try not to think, try not to dwell on the cold feelingthat surrounds my chest and the weight that hangs over my head. He hates me. Hedoes not believe me.Christina clutches me tighter as he walks past us, without even looking at me. Iwatch him over my shoulder. He stops next to Caleb, grabs his arm, and wrencheshim to his feet. Caleb wriggles for a second, but he is not half as strong asTobias and can’t break away.“What?” Caleb says, panicking. “What do you want?”“I want you to disarm the security system for Jeanine’s laboratory,” says Tobiaswithout looking back. “So that the factionless can access her computer.”And destroy it, I think, and if possible, my heart becomes even heavier. Tobiasand Caleb disappear into the stairwell again.Christina slumps against me, and I slump against her, so we hold each other up.“Jeanine activated all the Dauntless transmitters, you know,” Christina says.“One of the factionless groups got ambushed by simulation-controlled Dauntless,coming late from the Abnegation sector about ten minutes ago. I guess thefactionless won, though I don’t know how you call shooting a bunch of brain-deadpeople winning.”“Yeah.” There isn’t much more to say. She seems to realize that.“What happened after I got shot?” she says.I describe the blue hallway with two doors, and the simulation that followed,from the moment I recognized the Dauntless training room to the moment I shotmyself. I do not tell her about hallucinating Will.“Wait,” she says. “It was a simulation? Without a transmitter?”I frown. I hadn’t bothered to wonder about that. Especially not at the time. “Ifthe laboratory recognizes people, maybe it also knows data about everyone, andcan present a corresponding simulated environment depending on your faction.”It doesn’t matter, now, to figure out how Jeanine set up the security on herlaboratory, of all things. But it feels good to put myself to some use, to thinkof a new problem to solve now that I have failed to solve the most importantone.Christina sits up straighter. Maybe she feels the same way.“Or the poison somehow contains a transmitter.”I hadn’t thought of that.“But how did Tori get past it? She’s not Divergent.”I tilt my head. “I don’t know.”Maybe she is, I think. Her brother was, and after what happened to him, shemight never admit it, no matter how accepted it becomes.People, I have discovered, are layers and layers of secrets. You believe youknow them, that you understand them, but their motives are always hidden fromyou, buried in their own hearts. You will never know them, but sometimes youdecide to trust them.“What do you think they’re going to do to us when they find us guilty?” she saysafter a few minutes of silence have passed.“Honestly?”“Does now seem like the time for honesty?”I look at her from the corner of my eye. “I think they’re going to force us toeat lots of cake and then take an unreasonably long nap.”She laughs. I try not to—if I let myself laugh, I’ll start to cry, too. I hear a yell, and peer around the crowd to see where it came from.“Lynn!” The yell came from Uriah. He runs toward the door, where two Dauntlessare carrying Lynn in on a makeshift stretcher, made of what looks like a shelffrom a bookcase. She is pale—too pale—and her hands are folded over her stomach.I jump to my feet and start toward her, but a few factionless guns stop me fromgoing much farther. I put up my hands and stand still, watching.Uriah walks around the crowd of war criminals and points to a severe-lookingErudite woman with gray hair. “You. Come here.”The woman gets to her feet and brushes off her pants. She walks, light-footed,to the edge of the seated crowd and looks expectantly at Uriah.“You’re a doctor, right?” he says.“I am, yes,” she says.“Then fix her!” He scowls. “She’s hurt.”The doctor approaches Lynn and asks the two Dauntless to set her down. They do,and she crouches over the stretcher.“My dear,” she says. “Please remove your hands from your wound.”“I can’t,” moans Lynn. “It hurts.”“I am aware that it hurts,” the doctor says. “But I won’t be able to assess yourwound if you do not reveal it to me.”Uriah kneels across from the doctor and helps her shift Lynn’s hands away fromher stomach. The doctor peels Lynn’s shirt back from her stomach. The bulletwound itself is just a round, red circle in Lynn’s skin, but surrounding it iswhat looks like a bruise. I have never seen a bruise that dark.The doctor purses her lips, and I know that Lynn is as good as dead.“Fix her!” says Uriah. “You can fix her, so do it!”“On the contrary,” the doctor says, looking up at him. “Because you set thehospital floors of this building on fire, I cannot fix her.”“There are other hospitals!” he says, almost shouting. “You can get stuff fromthere and heal her!”“Her condition is far too advanced,” the doctor says, her voice quiet. “If youhad not insisted upon burning everything that came into your path, I could havetried, but as the situation stands, trying would be worthless.”“You shut up!” he says, pointing his gun at the doctor’s chest. “I’m not the onewho burned your hospital! She’s my friend, and I … I just …”“Uri,” says Lynn. “Shut up. It’s too late.”Uriah lets his gun clatter to the ground and grabs Lynn’s hand, his lipquivering.“I’m her friend too,” I say to the factionless pointing guns at me. “Can you atleast point guns at me from over there?”They let me pass, and I run to Lynn’s side, holding her free hand, which issticky with blood. I ignore the gun barrels pointed at my head and focus onLynn’s face, which is now yellowish instead of white.She doesn’t seem to notice me. She focuses on Uriah.“I’m just glad I didn’t die while under the simulation,” she says weakly.“You’re not gonna die now,” he says.“Don’t be stupid,” she says. “Uri, listen. I loved her too. I did.”“You loved who?” he says, his voice breaking.“Marlene,” says Lynn.“Yeah, we all loved Marlene,” he says.“No, that’s not what I mean.” She shakes her head. She closes her eyes.Still, it takes a few minutes before her hand goes limp in mine. I guide itacross her stomach, and then take her other hand from Uriah and do the same toit. He wipes his eyes before his tears can fall. Our eyes meet across her body.“You should tell Shauna,” I say. “And Hector.”“Right.” He sniffs and presses his palm to Lynn’s face. I wonder if her cheek isstill warm. I don’t want to touch her and find that it’s not.I rise and walk back to Christina."},{"pageContent":"[images/00033.jpg]MY MIND KEEPS tugging me toward my memories of Lynn, in an attempt to persuademe that she is actually gone, but I push away the short flashes as they come.Someday I will stop doing that, if I’m not executed as a traitor, or whateverour new leaders have planned. But right now I fight to keep my mind blank, topretend that this room is all that has ever existed and all that will everexist. It should not be easy, but it is. I have learned how to fend off grief.Tori and Harrison come to the lobby after a while, Tori limping toward a chair—Ialmost forgot about her bullet wound again; she was so nimble when she killedJeanine—and Harrison following her.Behind both of them is one of the Dauntless with Jeanine’s body slung over hisshoulder. He heaves it like a stone on a table in front of the rows of Eruditeand Dauntless traitors.Behind me I hear gasps and mutters, but no sobs. Jeanine was not the kind ofleader people cry for.I stare up at her body, which seems so much smaller in death than it did inlife. She is only a few inches taller than I am, her hair only a few shadesdarker. She looks calm now, almost peaceful. I have trouble connecting this bodywith the woman I knew, the woman without a conscience.And even she was more complicated than I thought, keeping a secret that shethought was too terrible to reveal, out of a heinously twisted protectiveinstinct.Johanna Reyes steps into the lobby, soaked to the bone from all the rain, herred clothes smeared with a darker red. The factionless flank her, but shedoesn’t appear to notice them or the guns they carry.“Hello,” she says to Harrison and Tori. “What is it that you want?”“I didn’t know the leader of Amity would be so curt,” says Tori with a wrysmile. “Isn’t that against your manifesto?”“If you were actually familiar with Amity’s customs, you would know that theydon’t have a formal leader,” says Johanna, her voice simultaneously gentle andfirm. “But I’m not the representative of Amity anymore. I stepped down in orderto come here.”“Yeah, I saw you and your little band of peacekeepers, getting in everyone’sway,” says Tori.“Yes, that was intentional,” Johanna replies. “Since getting in the way meantstanding between guns and innocents, and saved a great number of lives.”Color fills her cheeks, and I think it again: that Johanna Reyes might still bebeautiful. Except now I think that she isn’t just beautiful in spite of thescar, she’s somehow beautiful with it, like Lynn with her buzzed hair, likeTobias with the memories of his father’s cruelty that he wears like armor, likemy mother in her plain gray clothing.“Since you are still so very generous,” says Tori, “I wonder if you might carrya message back to the Amity.”“I don’t feel comfortable leaving you and your army to dole out justice as yousee fit,” says Johanna, “but I will certainly send someone else to Amity with amessage.”“Fine,” says Tori. “Tell them that a new political system will soon be formedthat will exclude them from representation. This, we believe, is their justpunishment for failing to choose a side in this conflict. They will, of course,be obligated to continue to produce and deliver food to the city, but they willbe under supervision by one of the leading factions.”For a second, I think that Johanna might launch herself at Tori and strangleher. But she draws herself up taller and says, “Is that all?”“Yes.”“Fine,” she says. “I’m going to go do something useful. I don’t suppose youwould allow some of us to come in here and tend to these wounded?”Tori gives her a look.“I didn’t think so,” says Johanna. “Do remember, though, that sometimes thepeople you oppress become mightier than you would like.”She turns and walks out of the lobby.Something about her words hits me. I am sure she meant them as a threat, and afeeble one, but it rings in my head like it was something more—like she couldeasily have been talking not about the Amity, but about another oppressed group.The factionless.And as I look around the room, at every Dauntless soldier and every factionlesssoldier, I begin to see a pattern.“Christina,” I say. “The factionless have all the guns.”She looks around, and then back at me, frowning.In my mind I see Therese, taking Uriah’s gun when she already had one herself. Isee Tobias’s mouth pressed into a line when I asked him about the uneasyDauntless-factionless alliance, holding something back.Then Evelyn emerges into the lobby, her posture regal, like a queen returning toher kingdom. Tobias does not follow her. Where is he?Evelyn stands behind the table where Jeanine Matthews’s body lies. Edward limpsinto the lobby behind her. Evelyn takes out a gun, points it at the fallenportrait of Jeanine, and fires.A hush falls over the room. Evelyn drops the gun on the table, next to Jeanine’shead.“Thank you,” she says. “I know that you are all wondering what will happen next,so I am here to tell you.”Tori sits up straighter in her chair and leans toward Evelyn, like she wants tosay something. But Evelyn pays no attention.“The faction system that has long supported itself on the backs of discardedhuman beings will be disbanded at once,” says Evelyn. “We know this transitionwill be difficult for you, but—”“We?” Tori breaks in, looking scandalized. “What are you talking about,disbanded?”“What I am talking about,” says Evelyn, looking at Tori for the first time, “isthat your faction, which up until a few weeks ago was clamoring along with theErudite for the restriction of food and goods to the factionless, a clamor thatresulted in the destruction of the Abnegation, will no longer exist.”Evelyn smiles a little.“And if you decide to take up arms against us,” she says, “you will be hardpressed to find any arms to take up.”I watch, then, as each factionless soldier holds up a gun. Factionless areevenly spaced around the edge of the room, and they disappear into one of thestairwells. They have us all surrounded.It is so elegant, so clever, that I almost laugh.“I instructed my half of the army to relieve your half of the army of theirweapons as soon as their missions were completed,” says Evelyn. “I see now thatthey were successful. I regret the duplicity, but we knew that you have beenconditioned to cling to the faction system like it is your own mother, and thatwe would have to help ease you into this new era.”“Ease us?” Tori demands. She pushes herself to her feet and limps toward Evelyn,who calmly takes her gun in hand and points it at Tori.“I have not been starving for more than a decade just to give in to a Dauntlesswoman with a leg injury,” Evelyn says. “So unless you want me to shoot you, takea seat with your fellow ex-faction members.”I see all the muscles in Evelyn’s arm standing at attention, her eyes not cold,not quite like Jeanine’s, but calculating, assessing, planning. I don’t know howthis woman could have ever bent to Marcus’s will. She must not have been thiswoman then, all steel, tested in fire.Tori stands before Evelyn for a few seconds. She then limps backward, away fromthe gun and toward the edge of the room.“Those of you who assisted us in the effort to take down Erudite will berewarded,” says Evelyn. “Those of you who resisted us will be tried and punishedaccording to your crimes.” She raises her voice for the last sentence, and I amsurprised by how well it carries over the space.Behind her, the door to the stairwell opens, and Tobias steps out with Marcusand Caleb behind him, almost unnoticed. Almost, except I notice him, because Ihave trained myself to notice him. I watch his shoes as he comes closer. Theyare black sneakers with chrome eyelets for the laces. They stop right next tome, and he crouches by my shoulder.I look at him, expecting to find his eyes cold and unyielding.But I don’t.Evelyn is still talking, but her voice fades for me.“You were right,” Tobias says quietly, balancing on the balls of his feet. Hesmiles a little. “I do know who you are. I just needed to be reminded.”I open my mouth, but I don’t have anything to say.Then all the screens in the Erudite lobby—at least those that weren’t destroyedin the attack—flicker on, including a projector positioned over the wall whereJeanine’s portrait used to be.Evelyn stops in the middle of whatever sentence she was speaking. Tobias takesmy hand and helps me to my feet.“What is this?” Evelyn demands.“This,” he says, only to me, “is the information that will change everything.”My legs shake with relief and apprehension.“You did it?” I say.“You did it,” he says. “All I did was force Caleb to cooperate.”I throw my arm around his neck, and press my lips to his. He holds my face inboth hands and kisses me back. I press into the distance between us until it isgone, crushing the secrets we have kept and the suspicions we have harbored—forgood, I hope.And then I hear a voice.We pull apart and turn toward the wall, where a woman with short brown hair isprojected. She sits at a metal desk with her hands folded, in a location I don’trecognize. The background is too dim.“Hello,” she says. “My name is Amanda Ritter. In this file I will tell you onlywhat you need to know. I am the leader of an organization fighting for justiceand peace. This fight has become increasingly more important—and consequently,nearly impossible—in the past few decades. That is because of this.”Images flash across the wall, almost too fast for me to see. A man on his kneeswith a gun pressed to his forehead. The woman pointing it at him, her faceemotionless.From a distance, a small person hanging by the neck from a telephone pole.A hole in the ground the size of a house, full of bodies.And there are other images too, but they move faster, so I get only impressionsof blood and bone and death and cruelty, empty faces, soulless eyes, terrifiedeyes.Just when I have had enough, when I feel like I am going to scream if I see anymore, the woman reappears on the screen, behind her desk.“You do not remember any of that,” she says. “But if you are thinking these arethe actions of a terrorist group or a tyrannical government regime, you are onlypartially correct. Half of the people in those pictures, committing thoseterrible acts, were your neighbors. Your relatives. Your coworkers. The battlewe are fighting is not against a particular group. It is against human natureitself—or at least what it has become.”This is what Jeanine was willing to enslave minds and murder people for—to keepus all from knowing. To keep us all ignorant and safe and inside the fence.There is a part of me that understands.“That is why you are so important,” Amanda says. “Our struggle against violenceand cruelty is only treating the symptoms of a disease, not curing it. You arethe cure.“In order to keep you safe, we devised a way for you to be separated from us.From our water supply. From our technology. From our societal structure. We haveformed your society in a particular way in the hope that you will rediscover themoral sense most of us have lost. Over time, we hope that you will begin tochange as most of us cannot.“The reason I am leaving this footage for you is so that you will know when it’stime to help us. You will know that it is time when there are many among youwhose minds appear to be more flexible than the others. The name you should givethose people is Divergent. Once they become abundant among you, your leadersshould give the command for Amity to unlock the gate forever, so that you mayemerge from your isolation.”And that is what my parents wanted to do: to take what we had learned and use itto help others. Abnegation to the end.“The information in this video is to be restricted to those in government only,”Amanda says. “You are to be a clean slate. But do not forget us.”She smiles a little.“I am about to join your number,” she says. “Like the rest of you, I willvoluntarily forget my name, my family, and my home. I will take on a newidentity, with false memories and a false history. But so that you know theinformation I have provided you with is accurate, I will tell you the name I amabout to take as my own.”Her smile broadens, and for a moment, I feel that I recognize her.“My name will be Edith Prior,” she says. “And there is much I am happy toforget.”Prior.The video stops. The projector glows blue against the wall. I clutch Tobias’shand, and there is a moment of silence like a withheld breath.Then the shouting begins."},{"pageContent":"[images/00038.jpg]Thank you, God, for keeping your promises.Thank you:Nelson, beta reader, tireless supporter, photographer, best friend, and mostimportantly, husband….

It will be a long time before I quit thinkingabout this haunting vision of the future.”—James Dashner, New York Times Bestselling Author of The Maze Runner “A taut and shiveringly exciting read! Tris is exactly the sort of unflinchingand fierce heroine I love. I couldn’t turn the pages fast enough.”—Melissa Marr, New York Times Bestselling Author of Wicked Lovely “Promising author Roth tells the riveting and complex story of a teenage girlforced to choose between her routinized, selfless family and the adventurous,unrestrained future she longs for. A memorable, unpredictable journey from whichit is nearly impossible to turn away.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review) “This is one fast-paced read that sticks in your head for days after you put itdown, both because of its video-game-like scenes and its thought-provokingpremise.”—Hollywoodcrush.mtv.com “This gritty, paranoid world is built with careful details and intriguing scope.The plot clips along at an addictive pace, with steady jolts of brutal violenceand swoony romance. Fans snared by the ratcheting suspense will be unable toresist speculating on their own factional allegiance. Guaranteed to fly off theshelves.”—Kirkus Reviews “With brisk pacing and lavish flights of imagination, DIVERGENT clearly hasthrills, but it also movingly explores a more common adolescent anxiety—thepainful realization that coming into one’s own sometimes means leaving familybehind, both ideologically and physically.”—New York Times Book Review “I was most definitely hooked by this superb work of fiction. It had everythinga dystopian novel needs: a feisty heroine, an unyielding government, loveinterests, survival in a harsh world, and shocks and twists galore. In short, itwas fantastic! Roth maintains a gripping pace throughout the book, with suspenseand plot twists around every corner.”—Guardian.co.uk “Roth paints her canvas with the same brush as Suzanne Collins. The plot,scenes, and characters are different but the colors are the same and just asrich. Fans of Collins, dystopias, and strong female characters will love thisnovel.”—SLJ "},{"pageContent":"Other Books by Veronica Roth[Insurgent_%28Divergent%29_split_002.html#filepos8891] DIVERGENT "},{"pageContent":"Copyright [Insurgent_%28Divergent%29_split_002.html#filepos9057] First published in hardback in the USA by HarperCollins Publishers, Inc. in 2012First published in paperback in Great Britain by HarperCollins Children’s Booksin 2012HarperCollins Children’s Books is a division of HarperCollinsPublishers Ltd,77-85 Fulham Palace Road, Hammersmith, London, W6 8JB. www.harpercollins.co.uk [http://www.harpercollins.co.uk] InsurgentCopyright © 2012 by Veronica Roth SOURCE ISBN: 978-0-00-744292-8 EPub Edition © APRIL 2012 ISBN: 978-0-00-747990-0 Veronica Roth asserts the moral right to be identified as the author of thework.
