Due to the foreignne ss of the conc epts and practices don Juan wanted me to unde rstand and internalize, I have had no other choi ce but to rende r his teachings in the form of a narrative, a narrative of what happe ned, as it happe ned. The organization of don Juan’s instruction was predicated on the idea that man has two type s of awareness. He lab eled them the right side and the left side. He described the first as the state of nor mal awareness necessary for everyda y life. The second, he said, was the mysterious side of man, the state of awareness needed to func tion as sorcerer and seer. Don Juan divided his instruction, accordingl y, into teachings for the right side and teachings for the left side. He conduc ted his teachings for the right side when I was in my state of nor mal awareness, and I have described thos e teachings in all my account s. In m y state of nor mal awareness don Juan told me that he was a sorcerer. He even introduc ed me to anot her sorcerer, don Genaro Flores, and because of the nature of our association, I logi cally conc lude d that they had taken me as their appr entice. That appr enti ceship ende d with an incom prehensible act that bot h don Juan and don Genaro led me to perform. They made me jum p from the top of a flat mount ain into an abys s. I have described in one of my account s what took place on that mount aintop. The last drama of do n Juan’s teachings for the right side was played there by don"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 Juan himself; don Genaro; two appr entices, Pablito and Nestor; and me. Pablito, Nestor, and I jum ped from that mount aintop into an abys s. For years afterward I thought that just my total trust i n don Juan and don Genaro had been sufficient to obl iterate all my rationa l fears on facing actual anni hilation. I know now that it wasn’t so; I know that the secret was in don Juan’s teachings for the left side, and that it took tremendous discipline and perseverance for don Juan, don Genaro, and their com panions to conduc t thos e teachings . It has taken me nearly ten years to recollect what exactly took place in his teachings for the left side that led me to be so willing to perform such an incom prehensibl e act: jum ping into an abys s. It was in his teachings for the left side that don Juan let on what he, don Genaro, and their com panions were really doing to me. and who they were. They were not teaching me sorcery, but how to master three aspects of an anci ent know ledge they pos sessed: awareness, stalking, and intent. And they were not sorcerers; they were seers. And don Juan was not onl y a seer, but also a nagua l. Don Juan had already expl ained to me, in his teachings for the right side, a great deal about the nagua l and about seeing. I had unde rstood seeing to be the capacity of hum an beings to enlarge their perceptual field unt il they are capable of assessing not onl y the out er appe arances but the essence of everything. He had also expl ained that seers see man as a field of energy, which looks like a lum inous egg. The majority of peopl e, he said, have their fields of energy divided into two parts. A few men and wom en have four or som etimes three parts. Because these peopl e are more resilient than the averag e man, they can becom e nagua ls after learning to see."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 In his teachings for the left side, don Juan expl ained to me the intricacies of seeing and of being a nagua l. To be a nagual, he said, is som ething more com plex and farreaching than being merely a more resilient man who has learned to see. To be a nagua l entails being a leader, being a teacher and a gui de. As a nagua l, don Juan was the leader of a group of seers know n as the nagua l’s party, which was com pos ed of eight female seers, Cecilia, Delia, Herme linda , Carmela. Nelida, Florinda, Zuleica, and Zoila; three male seers, Vicente, Silvio Manue l, and Genaro; and four cour iers or messenge rs, Emilito, John Tum a, Marta, and Teresa. In addi tion to leading the nagua l’s party, don Juan also taught and gui ded a group of appr entice seers know n as the new nagua l’s party. It cons isted of four young men, Pablito, Nestor, Eligio, and Benigno, along with five wom en, Soledad, la Gorda, Lidia, Josefina, and Rosa. I was the nom inal leader of the new nagua l’s party toge th er with the nagua l wom an Carol. In order for don Juan to impart to me his teachings for the left side it was necessary for me to enter into a uni que state of perceptual clarity know n as height ened awareness. Throughou t the years of my association with him, he had me repeatedly shift into such a state by means of a blow that he delivered with the palm of his hand on my uppe r back. Don Juan expl ained that in a state of height ened awareness appr entices can behave almost as naturally as in everyda y life, but ca n bring their minds to focus on anyt hing with unc ommon force and clarity. Yet, an inhe rent qua lity of height ened awareness is that it is not susceptible to nor mal recall. What transpires in such a state becom es part of the appr entice’s everyda y awareness o nly through a stagge ring effort of recove ry."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 My interaction with the nagua l’s party was an example of this difficulty of recall. With the exception of don Genaro, I had cont act with them onl y when I was in a state of height ened awareness; hence in my nor ma l everyda y life I coul d not remember them, not even as vague characters in dreams. The manne r in which I met with them every time was almost a ritual. I woul d drive to don Genaro’s hous e in a small tow n in the sout hern part of Mexico. Don Juan woul d join us immediately and the three of us woul d then get bus y with don Juan’s teachings for the right side. After that, don Juan woul d make me change levels of awareness and then we woul d drive to a larger, nearby tow n where he and the other fifteen seers were li ving. Every time I entered into height ened awareness I coul d not cease marveling at the difference between my two sides. I always felt as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes, as if I had been partially blind before and now I coul d see. The freedom , the sheer joy that used to pos sess me on thos e occasions cannot be com pared with anyt hing else I have ever experienced. Yet at the same time, there was a fright ening feeling of sadne ss and longi ng that went hand in hand with that freedom and joy. Don Juan had told me that there is no com pleteness without sadne ss and longi ng, for without them there is no sobr iety, no kindne ss. Wisdom without kind ness, he said, and know ledge without sobr iety are useless. The organization of his teachings for the left side also re qui red that don Juan, toge ther with som e of his fellow seers, expl ain to me the three facets of their know ledge : the mastery of awareness, the mastery of stalking, and the mastery of intent. This work deals with the mastery of awareness, which is part of h is total set of teachings for the left side; the set he used in order to prepare me for performing the astoni shing act of jum ping into an abys s."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Due to the fact that the expe riences I narrate here took place in height ened awareness, they cannot have the te xture of daily life. They are lacking in worldly cont ext, although I have tried my best to suppl y it without fictiona lizing it. In height ened awareness one is minimally con scious of the surroundi ngs , because one ’s total conc entration is taken by the detail s of the action at hand. In this case the action at hand was, naturally, the elucidation of the mastery of awareness. Don Juan unde rstood the mastery of awareness as being the mode rnda y version of an extremely old tradition, which he called the tradition o f the ancient Toltec seers. Although he felt that he was inextricably linke d to that old tradition, he cons idered himself to be one of the seers of a new cycle. When I asked him onc e what was the essential character of the seers of the new cycle, he said t hat they are the warriors of total freedo m, that they are such masters of awareness, stalking, and intent that they are not caught by death, like the rest of mortal men, but choos e the mom ent and the way of their departure from this world. At that mom ent t hey are cons um ed by a fire from within and vanish from the face of the earth, free, as if they had never existed. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 1 The New Seers I had arrived in the city of Oaxaca in sout hern Mexico on my way to the mount ains to look for don Juan. On my way out of tow n in the early morning, I had the good sense to drive by the main squa re, and there I found him sitting on his favor ite bench, as if waiting for me to go by. I joined him. He told me that he was in the city on bus iness, that he was staying at a local b oardinghous e, and that I was welcom e to stay with him because he had to remain in tow n for two more days. We talked for a while about my activities and probl ems in the academic world. As was custom ary with him, he sudde nly hit me on my back when I least ex pected it, and the blow shifted me into a state of height ened awareness. We sat in silence for a very long time. I anxi ous ly waited for him to begin talking, yet when he did, he caught me by surprise. “Ages before the Spaniards came to Mexico,” he said, “t here were extraordinary Toltec seers, men capable of inconc eivable deeds. They were the last link in a chain of know ledge that extende d ove r thous ands of years. “The Toltec seers were extraordinary men?pow erful sorcerers, som ber, driven men who unr aveled m ysteries and pos sessed secret know ledge that they used to influence and victimize peopl e by fixating the awareness of their victims on whatever they chos e.”"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 He stoppe d talking and looke d at me intently. I felt that he was waiting for me to ask a que stion, but I did not know what to ask. “I have to empha size an impor tant fact,” he cont inue d, “the fact that thos e sorcerers kne w how to fixate the awareness of their victims. You didn’ t pick up on that. When I mentione d it, it didn’ t mean anyt hing to you. That’s not surprising. One of the hardest things to acknow ledge is that awareness can be manipul ated.” I felt conf used. I kne w that he was leading me tow ard som ething. I felt a familiar appr ehension? the same feeling I had whenever he began a new round of his tea chings . I told him how I felt. He smiled vague ly. Usually when he smiled he exude d happi ness; this time he was definitely preoccupi ed. He seemed to cons ider for a mom ent whether or not to go on talking. He stared at me intently again, slow ly movi ng his gaz e ove r the entire lengt h of my body. Then, appa rently satisfied, he nodde d and said that I was ready for my final exercise, som ething that all warriors go through before cons idering themselves fit to be on their ow n. I was more mystified than ever. “We are goi ng to be talking about awareness,” he cont inue d. “The Toltec seers kne w the art of handl ing awareness. As a matter of fact, they were the supr eme masters of that art. When I say that they kne w how to fixate the awareness of their victims, I mean that t heir secret know ledge and secret practices allow ed them to pry ope n the mystery of being aware. Enough of their practices have survived to this day, but fortuna tely in a modi fied form. I say fortuna tely because thos e activities, as I will expl ain, did not lead the ancient Toltec seers to freedom , but to their doom .” “Do you know thos e practices your self?” I asked. “Why, certainly,” he replied. “There is no way for us not to know thos e techni que s, but"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 that doe sn’t mean that we practice them our selves. We ha ve other views. We belong to a new cycle.” “But you don’ t cons ider you rself a sorcerer, don Juan, do you? ” I asked. “No, I don’ t,” he said. “I am a warrior who sees. In fact, all of us are los nue vos videntes?the new seers. The old seers were the sorcerer s. “For the average man,” he cont inue d, “sorcery is a negative bus iness, but it is fascinating all the same. That’s why I encour aged you, in your nor mal awareness, to think of us as sorcerers. It’s advi sable to do so. It serves to attract interest. But fo r us to be sorcerers woul d be like entering a deadend street.” I wanted to know what he meant by that, but he refused to talk about it. He said that he woul d elabor ate on the subj ect as he proceeded with his expl anation of awareness. I asked him then about the origin of the Toltecs’ know ledge . “The way the Toltecs first started on the path of know ledge was by eating pow er plants,” he replied. “Whether prom pted by curiosity, or hunge r, or error, they ate them. Once the pow er plants had produc ed their effect s on them, it was onl y a matter of time before som e of them began to analyze their expe riences. In my opi nion, the first men on the path of kn ow ledge were very daring, but very mistaken.” “Isn’t all this a conj ecture on your part, don Juan?” “No, this is n o conj ecture of mine. I am a seer, and when I focus my seeing on that time I know everything that took place.” “Can you see the details of things of the past?” I asked."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 “Seeing is a peculiar feeling of know ing, ” he replied, “of know ing som ething witho ut a shadow of doubt . In this case, I know what thos e men did, not onl y because of my seeing, but because we are so closely bound toge ther.” Don Juan expl ained then that his use of the term “Toltec” did not correspond to what I unde rstood it to mean. To me it m eant a culture, the Toltec Empire. To him, the term “Toltec” meant “man of kno wledge .” He said that in the time he was referring to, centuries or perhaps even millenni a before the Spanish Conque st, all such men of know ledge lived within a vast geogr aphi ca l area, nor th and sout h of the valley of Mexico, and were employe d in specific lines of work: curing, bewitching, storytelling, dancing, being an oracle, preparing food and drink. Thos e lines of work fostered specific wisdom , wisdom that distingui shed them from average men. These Toltecs, moreove r, were also peopl e who fitted into the structure of everyda y life, very much as doc tors, artists, teachers, priests, and merchants in our ow n time do. They practiced their professions unde r the strict cont rol of or ganized brotherho ods and became proficient and influential, to such an extent that they even dom inated grou ps of peopl e who lived out side the Toltecs’ geog raphi cal regions . Don Juan said that after som e of these men had finally learned to see?after centuri es of dealing with pow er plants?the most enterprising of them then began to teach other men of know ledge how to see. And that was the beginni ng of their end. As time passed, the num ber of seers increased, but their obs ession with what they saw, which fill ed them with reverence and fear, became so intense that they ceased to be men of know ledge . They became extraordinarily proficient in seeing and coul d exert great cont rol ove r the strange worlds they were witnessing. But it"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 was to no avail. Seeing had unde rmined their strengt h and forced them to be obs essed with what they saw. “There were seers, how ever, who escaped that fate,” don Juan cont inue d, “great men who, in spite of their seeing, never ceased to be men of know ledge . Som e of them ende avo red to use seeing pos itively and to teach it to their fellow men. I’m convi nced that unde r their direction, the popul ations of entire cities went into other worlds and never came back. “But the seers who coul d onl y see were fiascos, and when the land where they lived was inva ded by a conque ring peopl e they were as defenseless as everyone else. “Thos e conque rors,” he went on, “took ove r the Toltec world?they appr opr iated everything? but they never learned to see.”’ “Why do you think they never learned to see?” I asked. “Because they copi ed the procedur es of the Toltec seers without having the Toltecs’ inne r know ledge . To this day there are scores of sorcerers all ove r Mexico, descenda nts of thos e conque rors, who follow the Toltec ways but don’ t know what they’re doi ng, o r what they’re talking about , because they’re not seers.” “Who were thos e conque rors, don Juan?” “Other Indi ans,” he said. “When the Spaniards came, the old seers had been gone for centuries, but there was a new breed of seers who were starting to secure t heir place in a new cycle.” “What do you mean. a new breed of seers?” “After the world of the first Toltecs was destroye d, the surviving seers retreated and began a serious examination of their practices. The first thing they did was to establish stalking, dreaming, and intent as the key procedur es and to"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 deempha size the use of pow er plants; perhaps that gives us a hint as to what really happe ned to them with pow er plants. “The new cycle was just beginni ng to take hol d when the Spanish conque rors swept the land. Fortuna tely, by that time the new seers were thor oughl y prepared to face that dange r. They were already cons um mate practitioners of the art of stalking. ” Don Juan said that the subs eque nt centuries of subj uga tion prov ided for these new seers the idea l circum stances in which to perfect their skills. Oddl y enough, it was the extreme rigor and coercion of that period that gave them the impetus to refine their new principles. And, ow ing to the fact that they never divul ged their activities, they were left alone to map their findi ngs . “Were there a great many new seers dur ing the Conque st?” I asked. “At the beginni ng there were. Near the end there were onl y a handf ul. The rest had been exterminated.” “What about in our day, don Juan?” I asked. “There are a few. They are scattered all ove r, you unde rstand. ” “Do you know them?” I asked. “Such a simple que stion is the hardest one to answer,” he replied. “There are som e we know very well. But they are not exactly like us because they have conc entrated on other s pecific aspects of know ledge , such as dancing, curing, bewitching, talking, instead of what the new seers recom mend, stalking, dreaming, and intent. Thos e who are exactly like us woul d not cross our path. The seers who lived dur ing the Conque st set it up t hat way so as to avoi d being exterminated in the conf ront ation with the Spaniards. Each of thos e seers founde d a lineage. And not all of them had descenda nts, so the lines are few.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 “Do you know any who are exactly like us?” I asked. “A few,” he replied l aconi cally. I asked him then to give me all the information he coul d, for I was vitally interested in the topi c; to me it was of crucial impor tance to know names and addr esses for pur pos es of validation and corrobo ration. Don Juan did not seem inclined to obl ige me. “The new seers went through that bit of corrobor ation, ” he said. “Half of them left their bone s in the corrobo rating room . So now they are solitary birds. Let’s leave it that way. All we can talk about is our line. About that, you and I can say as much as we please.” He expl ained that all the lines of seers were started at the same time and in the same fashion. Around the end of the sixteenth century every nagua l deliberately isolated himself and his group of seers from any ove rt cont act with oth er seers. The cons eque nce of that drastic segregation, he said, was the formation of the indi vidua l lineages. Our lineage cons isted of four teen nagua ls and one hundr ed and twentysix seers, he said. Som e of thos e four teen nagua ls had as few as seven seers w ith them. others had eleven, and som e up to fifteen. He told me that his teacher?or his benefactor, as he called him?was the nagua l Julian, and the one who came before Julian was the nagua l Ellas. I asked him if he kne w the names of all four teen nagua ls. H e named and enum erated them for me, so I coul d learn who they were. He also said that he had persona lly know n the fifteen seers who formed his benefactor’s group and that he had also know n his benefactor’s teacher, the nagua l Ellas, and the eleven seers of his party. Don Juan assured me that our line was qui te exceptiona l, because it unde rwent a drastic change in the year 1723 as a result of an out side influence that came to bear on us and inexor ably altered our cour se. He did not want to discuss"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 the event itself at the mom ent, but he said that a new beginni ng is count ed from that time; and that the eight nagua ls who have ruled the line since then are cons idered intrinsically different from the six who preceded them. Don Juan must have had bus iness to take care of the next day, for I did not see him unt il around noon. in the meantime, three of his appr entices had com e to tow n, Pablito, Nestor, and la Gorda. They were shoppi ng for too ls and materials for Pablito’s carpentry bus iness. I accom panied them and h elped them to com plete all their errands . Then all of us went back to the boa rdinghous e. All four of us were sitting around talking when don Juan came into my room . He announc ed that we were leaving after lunc h, but that before we went to eat he still had som ething to discuss with me, in private. He wanted the two of us to take a stroll around the main squa re and then all of us woul d meet at a restaurant. Pablito and Nestor stood up and said that they had som e errands to run before meeting us. La Gorda seem ed very displeased. “What are you goi ng to talk about ?” she blurted out , but qui ckly realized her mistake and giggl ed. Don Juan gave her a strange look but did not say anyt hing. Encour aged by his silence, la Gorda propos ed that we take her along. She assur ed us that she woul d not bot her us in the least. “I’m sure you won’ t bot her us,” don Juan said to her, “but I really don’ t want you to hear anyt hing of what I have to say to him.”"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 La Gorda’s ange r was very obvi ous . She blushed and, as don Juan and I walked out of the room , her entire face clou ded with anxi ety and tension, becom ing instantly distorted. Her mout h was ope n and her lips were dry. La Gorda’s mood made me very app rehensive. I felt an actual discom fort. I didn’ t say anyt hing, but don Juan seemed t o not ice my feelings . “You shoul d thank la Gorda day and night ,” he said all of a sudde n. “She’s helping you destroy you r self - impor tance. She’s the petty tyrant in you r life, but you still haven’t caught on to that.” We strolled around the plaza unt il all my nervous ness had vanished. Then we sat dow n on his favor ite bench again. “The ancient seers were very fortuna te inde ed,” don Juan began, “because they had plenty of time to learn marvelous things . Let me tell you, they kne w wonde rs that we can’t even im agine toda y.” “Who taught them all that?” I asked. “They learned everything by themselves through seeing, ”’ he replied. “Most of the things we know in our lineage were figur ed out by (hem. The new seers corrected the mistakes of the old seers, but the basi s of what we know and do is lost in Toltec time.” He expl ained. One of the simplest and yet most impor tant find ings , from the poi nt of view of instruction, he said, is the know ledge that man has two type s of awareness. The old seers called them the right a nd the left side of man. “The old seers figur ed out ,” he went on, “that the best way to teach their know ledge was to make their appr entices shift to their left side, to a state of height ened awareness. Real learning takes place there."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 “Very young children were given to the old seers as appr entices,” don Juan cont inue d, “so that they woul dn’ t know any other way of life. Thos e children, in turn, when they came of age took other children as appr entices. Imagine the things they must have unc ove red in their shif ts to the left and to the right , after centuries of that kind of conc entration. ” I remarked how disconc erting thos e shifts were to me. He said that my expe rience was similar to his ow n. His benefactor, the nagua l Julian, had created a profound schism in hi m, by making him shift back and forth from one type of awareness to the other. He said that the clarity and freedom he expe rienced in height ened awareness were in total cont rast to the rationa lizations , the defenses, the ange r, and the fear of his nor mal s tate of awareness. The old seers used to create this pol arity to suit their ow n particular pur pos es; with it, they forced their app rentices to achieve the conc entration needed to learn sorcery techni que s. But the new seers, he said, use it to lead their ap prentices to the convi ction that there are unr ealized pos sibilities in man. “The best effort of the new seers,” don Juan cont inue d, “is their expl anation of the mystery of awareness. They conde nsed it all into som e conc epts and actions which are taught whi le the appr entices are in height ened awareness.” He said that the value of the new seers’ method of teaching is that it takes adva ntage of the fact that no one can remember anyt hing that happe ns while being in a state of height ened awareness. This inabilit y to remember sets up an almost insurmou ntable barrier for warriors, who have to recollect all the instruction given to them if they are to go on. Only after years of struggl e and discipline can warriors recollect their instruction. By then the conc epts an d the procedur es that were taught to them have been internalized and have thus acqui red the force the new seers meant them to have."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 2 Petty Tyran ts Don Juan did not discuss the mastery of awareness with me unt il mont hs later. We were at that time in the hous e where the nagua l’s party lived. “Let’s go for a walk,” don Juan said to me, placing his hand on my shoul der. “Or better yet, let’s go to the tow n’s squa re, where there are a lot of peopl e, and sit dow n and talk.” I was surprised when he spoke to me, as I had been in the hous e for a coupl e of days then and he had not said so much as hello. As don Juan and I were leaving the hous e, la Gorda intercepted us and demande d that we take her along. She seemed determined not to take no for an answer. Don Jua n in a very stern voi ce told her that he had to discuss som ething in private with me. “You’ re goi ng to talk about me,” la Gorda said, her tone and gestures betraying bot h suspicion and annoya nce. “You’ re right,” don Juan replied dryly. He move d past her wi thout turning to look at her. I follow ed him, and we walked in silence to the tow n’s squa re. When we sat dow n I asked him what on earth we woul d find to discuss about la Gorda. I was still smarting from her loo k of menace when we left the hous e. “We have n othing to discuss about la Gorda or anybody else,” he said. “I told her that just to provoke her eno rmous self - impor tance. And it worked. She is"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 furious with us. If I know her, by now she will have talked to herself long enough to have bui lt up her conf ide nce and her righ teous indi gna tion at having been refused and made to look like a fool .

While we are invol ved in our discussion I w ill demand your total conc entration and patience.” Halfcom plaining, I told him that he had made me feel very unc om fortable by refusing to talk to me for the past two days. He looke d at me and arched his brow s. A smile played on his lips and vanished. I rea lized that he was letting me know I was no better than la Gorda. “I was provoki ng your self - importance,” he said with a frow n. “Self - impor tance is our greatest enemy. Think about it?what weakens us is feeling offende d by the deeds and misdeeds of our fell ow men. Our self - impor tance requi res that we spend most of our lives offende d by som eone . “The new seers recom mende d that every effort shoul d be made to eradicate self - importance from the lives of warriors. I have follow ed that recom menda tion, and much of my ende avor s with you has been geared to show you that without self - importance we are invul nerable.” As I listened his eyes sudde nly became very shiny. I was thinki ng to myself that he seemed to be on the verge of laught er and there was no reason for it w hen I was startled by an abrupt , painful slap on the right side of my face."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 I jum ped up from the bench. La Gorda was standi ng behind me, her hand still raised.

Don Juan was transfixed with inexp ressible glee. I was frozen with sheer fury . La Gorda glared at me and then turned to don Juan and meekly told him that we had no right to criticize her. Don Juan laughe d so hard he doubl ed ove r almost to the ground. He coul dn’ t even speak. He tried two or three times to say som ething to me, then f inally got up and walked away, his body still shaking with spasms of laught er.

La Gorda and I were hor rendo usly alike. Our self - impor tance was monum ental. My surprise and fury at being slappe d were just like la Gorda’s feelings of ange r and suspicion. Don Juan was right . The bur den of self - impo rtance is a terrible enc um brance. I ran after him then, elated, the tears flow ing dow n my cheeks. I caught up with him and told him what I had realized. His eyes were shining with mischievous ness and delight . “What shoul d I do about la Gorda?” I asked. “Nothing, ” he replied. “Rea lizations are always persona l.” He change d the subj ect and said that the omens were telling us to cont inue our discussion back at his hous e, either in a large room with com fortable chairs or in the back patio, which had a roof ed corridor around it. He said that whenever he"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 conduc ted his expl anation inside the hous e thos e two areas woul d be off limits to everyone else. We went back to the hous e. Don Juan told everyone what la Gorda had done . The delight all the seers show ed in taunt ing her made la Gorda’s po sition extremely unc omfortable. “Self - impo rtance can’t be fought with niceties,” don Juan com mented when I expr essed my conc ern about la Gorda. He then asked everyone to leave the room . We sat dow n and don Juan began his expl anations . He said that seers, o ld and new, are divided into two categor ies. The first one is made up of thos e who are willing to exercise selfrestraint and can channe l their activities tow ard pragmatic goa ls, which woul d benefit other seers and man in general. The other categor y cons ist s of thos e who don’ t care about selfrestraint or about any pragm atic goa ls. It is the cons ensus among seers that the latter have failed to resolve the probl em of self - impor tance. “Self - impo rtance is not som ething simple and naive,” he expl ained. “On the on e hand, it is the core of everything that is good in us, and on the other hand, the core of everything that is rotten. To get rid of the self - importance that is rotten requi res a masterpiece of strategy. Seers, through the ages, have given the highe st prai se to thos e who have accom plished it.” I com plained that the idea of eradicating self - impor tance, although very appe aling to me at times, was really incom prehensible; I told him that I found his directives for getting rid of it so vague I coul d not follow them."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 “I’ve said to you many times,” he said, “that in order to follow the path of know ledge one has to be very imaginative. You see, in the path of know ledge not hing is as clear as we’d like it to be.” My discom fort made me argue that his adm oni tions abou t self - impo rtance reminde d me of Cathol ic dieturns. After a lifetime of being told about the evils of sin, I had becom e callous . “Warriors fight self - impo rtance as a matter of strategy, not principle,” he replied. “Your mistake is to unde rstand what I say in terms of morality.” “I see you as a highl y moral man, don Juan,” I insisted. “You’ ve not iced my impeccability, that’s all,” he said. “Impeccability, as well as getting rid of self - impo rtance, is too vague a conc ept to be of any value to me,” I remarked. Don Juan choke d with laught er, and I challenge d him to expl ain impeccability. “Impeccability is not hing else but the prope r use of energy, ” he said. “My statements have no inkl ing of morality. I’ve saved energy and that makes me impeccable. To unde rstand this, you have to save enough energy your self.” We were qui et for a long time. I wanted to think about what he had said. Sudde nly, he started talking again. “Warriors take strategic inve ntories,” he said. “They list everything they do. Then they decide wh ich of thos e things can be change d in order to allow themselves a respite, in terms of expe ndi ng their energy. ”"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 I argue d that their list woul d have to includ e everything unde r the sun. He patiently answered that the strategic inve ntory he was talking about cove red onl y behavioral patterns that were not essential to our survival and wellbeing. I jum ped at the oppor tuni ty to poi nt out that survival and wellbeing were categor ies that coul d be interpreted in endl ess ways, hence, there was no way of agreeing wha t was or was not essential to survival and wellbeing. As I kept on talking I began to lose mom entum . Finally, I stoppe d because I realized the futility of my argu ments. Don Juan said then that in the strategic inve ntories of warriors, self - impor tance figu res as the activity that cons um es the greatest amount of energy, hence, their effort to eradicate it. “One of the first conc erns of warriors is to free that energy in order to face the unknow n with it,” don Juan went on. “The action of rechanne ling that en ergy is impeccability.” He said that the most effective strategy was worked out by the seers of the Conque st, the unque stiona ble masters of stalking. It cons ists of six elements that interplay with one anot her. Five of them are called the attribut es of wa rriorship: cont rol, discipline, forbearance, timing, and will. They pertain to the world of the warrior who is fight ing to lose self - impor tance. The sixth element, which is perhaps the most impor tant of all, pertains to the out side world and is called the petty tyrant. He looke d at me as if silently asking me whether or not I had unde rstood. “I’m really mystified,” I said. “You keep on saying that la Gorda is the petty tyrant of my life. Just what is a petty tyrant?”"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 “A petty tyrant is a tormentor,” he repl ied. “Som eone who either hol ds the pow er of life and death ove r warriors or simply annoys them to distraction.” Don Juan had a beaming smile as he spoke to me. He said that the new seers develope d their ow n classification of petty tyrants; althoug h the co ncept is one of their most serious and impor tant find ings , the new seers had a sense of hum or about it. He assured me that there was a tinge of malicious hum or in every one of their classifications , because hum or was the onl y means of count eracting the com pul sion of hu man awareness to take inve ntories and to make cum bersom e classifications . The new seers, in accordance with their practice, saw fit to head their classification with the primal sour ce of energy, the one and onl y ruler in the uni verse, and they called it simply the tyrant. The rest of the despot s and author itarians were found to be, naturally, infinitely below the categor y of tyrant. Com pared to the sour ce of everything, the most fearsom e, tyranni cal men are buf foons ; cons eque ntly, they were cla ssified as petty tyrants, pinches tiranos . He said that there were two subc lasses of minor petty tyrants. The first subc lass cons isted of the petty tyrants who persecute and inflict misery but without actually causing anybody’ s death. They were called litt le petty tyrants, pinches tiranitos. The second cons isted of the petty tyrants who are onl y exasperating and bot hersom e to no end. They were called smallfry petty tyrants, repinches tiranitos, or teensyw eensy petty tyrants, pinches tiranitos chiqui titos. I thought his classifications were ludi crous . I was sure that he was improv ising the Spanish terms. I asked him if that was so. “Not at all,” he replied with an amused expression."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 “The new seers were great one s for classifications . Genaro is doubt less one of the greatest; if you’ d obs erve him carefully, you’ d realize exactly how the new seers feel about their classifications .” He laughe d upr oariously at my conf usion when I asked him if he was pul ling my leg. “I woul dn’ t dream of doi ng that,” he said, smilin g. “Genaro may do that, but not I, especially when I know how you feel about classifications . It’s just that the new seers were terribly irreverent.” He adde d that the little petty tyrants are further divided into four categor ies. One that torments with b rutality and violence. Anot her that doe s it by creating unbe arable appr ehension through devious ness. Anot her which oppr esses with sadne ss. And the last, which torments by making warriors rage. “La Gorda is in a class of her ow n,” he adde d. “She is an act ing, smallfry petty tyrant. She annoys you to pieces and makes you rage. She even slaps you. With all that she is teaching you detachm ent.” “That’s not pos sible!” I protested. “You haven’t yet put toge ther all the ing redients of the new seers’ strategy, ” he said. “Once you do that, you’ ll know how efficient and clever is the device of using a petty tyrant. I woul d certainly say that the strategy not onl y gets rid of self - impor tance; it also prepares warriors for the final realization that impeccability is the onl y thing that count s in the path of kno wledge .” He said that what the new seers had in mind was a deadly maneuve r in which the petty tyrant is like a mount ain peak and the attribut es of warriorship are like climbers who meet at the sum mit."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 “Usually, onl y four attribut es are played,” he went on. “The fifth, will, is always saved for an ultimate conf ront ation, when warriors are facing the firing squa d, so to speak.” “Why is it done that way?” “Because wilt belongs to anot her sphe re, the unknow n. The oth er fou r belong to the know n, exactly where the petty tyrants are lodge d. In fact, what turns hum an beings into petty tyrants is precisely the obs essive manipul ation of the know n.” Don Juan expl ained that the interplay of all the five attribut es of warriors hip is done onl y by seers who are also impeccable warriors and have mastery ove r will. Such an interplay is a supr eme maneuve r that cannot be performed on the daily hum an stage. “Four attribut es are all that is needed to deal with the worst of petty tyran ts,” he cont inue d. “Provi ded, of cour se, that a petty tyrant has been found. As I said, the petty tyrant is the out side element, the one we cannot cont rol and the element that is perhaps the most impor tant of them all. My benefactor used to say that the wa rrior who stum bles on a petty tyrant is a lucky one . He meant that you’ re fortunate if you com e upon one in your path, because if you don’ t, you have to go out and look for one .” He expl ained that one of the greatest accom plishm ents of the seers of the Con que st was a cons truct he called the threepha se progr ession. By unde rstandi ng the nature of man, they were able to reach the incont estable conc lusion that if seers can hol d their ow n in facing petty tyrants, they can certainly face the unknow n with impun ity , and then they can even stand the presence of the unknow able."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 “The average man’s reaction is to think that the order of that statement shoul d be reversed,” he went on. “A seer who can hol d his ow n in the face of the unknow n can certainly face petty tyrant s. But that’s not so. What destroye d the supe rb seers of ancient times was that assumption. We know better now . We know that not hing can temper the spirit of a warrior as much as the challenge of dealing with impos sible peopl e in pos itions of pow er. Only u nde r thos e condi tions can warriors acqui re the sobr iety and serenity to stand the pressure of the unknow able.” I voc iferously disagreed with him. I told him that in my opi nion tyrants can onl y rende r their victims helpless or make them as brutal as they th emselves are. I poi nted out that count less studi es had been done on the effects of phys ical and psychol ogi cal torture on such victims. “The difference is in som ething you just said,” he retorted. “They are victims, not warriors. Once I felt just as you do. I’ll tell you what made me change , but first let’s go back again to what I said about the Conque st. The seers of that time coul dn’ t have found a better groun d. The Spaniards were the petty tyrants who tested the seers’ skills to the limit; after dealing w ith the conque rors, the seers were capable of facing anyt hing. They were the lucky one s. At that time there were petty tyrants everyw here. “After all thos e marvelous years of abunda nce things change d a great deal. Petty tyrants never again had that scope ; it was onl y dur ing thos e times that their author ity was unl imited. The perfect ing redient for the making of a supe rb seer is a petty tyrant with unl imited preroga tives. “In our times, unf ortuna tely, seers have to go to extremes to find a worthy one . Most o f the time they have to be satisfied with very small fry.” “Did you find a petty tyrant you rself, don Juan?”"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 “I was lucky. A kings ize one found me. At the time, though, I felt like you; I coul dn’ t cons ider myself fortuna te.” Don Juan said that his ordeal b egan a few weeks before he met his benefactor.

One day when he wa s movi ng som e heavy sacks of suga r a wom an came by. She was very well dressed and seemed to be a wom an of means. She was perhaps in her fifties, don Juan said, and very dom ineering. She looke d at don Juan and then spoke to the foreman and left. Don Juan wa s then appr oached by the foreman, who told him that for a fee he woul d recom mend him for a job in the bos s’s hous e. Don Juan told the man that he had no mone y. The foreman smiled and said not to worry because he woul d have plenty on payda y. He patted don J uan’s back and assured him it was a great honor to work for the bos s. Don Juan said that being a low ly ignor ant Indi an living handt om out h, not onl y did he believe every word, he thought a good fairy had touc hed him. He prom ised to pay the foreman anyt hing he wished. The foreman named a large sum , which had to be paid in installments. Immediately thereafter the foreman himself took don Juan to the hous e, which was qui te a distance from the tow n, and left him there with anot her foreman, a huge , som ber, ugl y m an who asked a lot of que stions . He wanted to know about don Juan’s family. Don Juan answered that he didn’ t have any. The man was so pleased that he even smiled through his rotten teeth. He prom ised don Juan that they woul d pay him plenty, and that he wou ld even be in a pos ition to save mone y, because he didn’ t have to spend any, for he was goi ng to live and eat in the hous e."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 The way the man laughe d was terrifying. Don Juan kne w that he had to escape immediately. He ran for the gate, but the man cut in fro nt of him with a revol ver in his hand. He cocked it and rammed it into don Juan’s stom ach. “You’ re here to work your self to the bone ,” he said. “And don’ t you forget it.” He shove d don Juan around with a billy club. Then he took him to the side of the hous e and, after obs erving that he worked his men every day from sunr ise to suns et without a break, he put don Juan to work diggi ng out two enor mous tree stum ps. He also told don Juan that if he ever tried to escape or went to the author ities he woul d shoot hi m dead?and that if don Juan shoul d ever get away, he woul d swear in cour t that don Juan had tried to murder the bos s. “You’ ll work here unt il you die,” he said. “Anot her Ind ian will get your job then, just as you’ re taking a dead Indi an’s place.” Don Juan said that the hous e looke d like a fortress, with armed men with machetes everyw here. So he got bus y working and tried not to think about his predicament. At the end of the day, the man came back and kicked him all the way to the kitchen, because he did not like the defiant look in don Juan’s eyes. He threatened to cut the tendons of don Juan’s arms if he didn’ t obe y him. In the kitchen an old wom an broug ht food, but don Juan was so ups et and afraid that he coul dn’ t eat. The old wom an advi sed him to eat as m uch as he coul d. He had to be strong, she said, because his work woul d never end.

At the beginni ng of every day don Juan thought it woul d be his last one on earth. And surviving meant onl y that he had to go through the same hell again the next day. What pre cipitated the end was don Juan’s reque st to have som e time off. The pretext was that he needed to go to tow n to pay the foreman of the suga r mill the mone y that he ow ed him. The other foreman retorted that don Juan coul d not stop working, not even for a mi nu te, because he was in debt up to his ears just for the privilege of working there. Don Juan kne w that he was done for. He understood the man’s maneuve rs. Both he and the other foreman were in cahoot s to get low ly Indi ans from the mill, work them to death , and divide their salaries. That realization ange red him so intensely that he ran through the kitchen screaming and got inside the main hous e. The foreman and the other workers were caught totally by surprise. He ran out the front doo r and almost got away , but the foreman caught up with him on the road and shot him in the chest. He left him for dead. Don Juan said that it was not his destiny to die; his benefactor found him there and tende d him unt il he got well. “When I told my benefactor the whol e story, ” don Juan said, “he coul d hardly cont ain his excitement. That foreman is really a prize, ‘ my benefactor said. ‘He is too good to be wasted.

My benefactor was right . A petty tyrant like that one was one in a million and coul dn’t be wasted.” “How did you manage to go back?” “My benefactor develope d a strategy using the four attribut es of warriorship: cont rol, discipline, forbearance , and timing. ” Don Juan said that his benefactor, in expl aining to him what he had to do to profit from facing that ogr e of a man, also told him what the new seers cons idered to be the four steps on the path of know ledge . The first step is the decision to becom e appr entices. After the appr entices change their views about themselves and the world they take the second step and becom e warriors, which is to say, beings capable of the utmost discipline and cont rol ove r themselves. The third step, after acqui ring forbearance and timing, is to becom e men of know ledge . When men of know ledge learn to see they have taken the four th step and have becom e seers. His benefactor stressed the fact that don Juan had been on the path of know ledge long enough to have acqui red a minimum of the first two attribu tes: cont rol and discipline. Don Juan empha sized that bot h of these attribut es refer to an inne r state. A warrior is selforiented, not in a selfish way, but in the sense of a total and cont inuous examination of the self. “ At that time, I was barred from the other two attribut es,” don Juan went on. “Forbearance and timing are not qui te an inne r state. They are in the dom ain of the man of know ledge . My benefactor show ed them to me through his strategy. ” “Does this mean that y ou coul dn’ t have faced the petty tyrant by your self?” I asked. “I’m sure that I coul d have done it myself, although I have always doubt ed that I woul d have carried it off with flair and joyf ulness.

By all indi cations tho se seers enjoye d themselves blue dealing with them. They proved that even the worst tyrants can bring delight , provi ded, of cour se, that one is a warrior.” Don Juan expl ained that the mistake average men make in c onf ront ing petty tyrants is not to have a strategy to fall back on; the fatal flaw is that average men take themselves too serious ly; their actions and feelings , as well as thos e of the petty tyrants, are allimpor tant. Warriors, on the other hand, not onl y have a wellthough tout strategy, but are free from self - impor tance. What restrains their self - importance is that they have unde rstoo d that reality is an interpretation we make. That know ledge was the definitive adva ntage that the new seers had ove r the sim pleminde d Spaniards. He said that he became convi nced he coul d defeat the foreman using onl y the singl e realization that petty tyrants take themselves with deadly serious ness while warriors do not . Follow ing his benefactor’s strategic plan, therefore, don Juan got a job in the same suga r mill as before.

His benefactor’s strategy specified that don Juan had to be solicitous of whoe ver c ame to look for anot her victim.

Don Juan kne w that the wom an, who wa s the wife of the ow ner of the mill, did not know what the two foremen were up to.

He had no saving grace. Ac cording to the new seers, a perfect petty tyrant has no redeeming feature.” Don Juan said that the other two attribut es of warriorship, forbearance and timing, which he did not yet have, had been auto matically include d in his benefactor’s strategy. Forbearance is to wait patiently?no rush, no anxi ety?a simple, joyf ul hol ding back of what is due . “I grove led daily,” don Juan cont inue d, “som etimes crying unde r the man’s whip.

You’ ll unde rstand that maneuve r as we keep on discussing the mastery of awareness.” I expl ained to don Juan that what I had wanted to know was whether, in the present, in our times, the petty tyr ants he had called small fry coul d ever defeat a warrior. “All the time,” he replied. “The cons eque nces aren’t as dire as thos e in the remote past. Toda y it goe s without saying that warriors always have a chance to recupe rate or to retrieve and com e back l ater. But there is anot her side to this probl em.

The road was deserted at that hour . It was 2: 00 p. m. As we strolled leisurely, don Juan sudde nly began to talk. He said that our discussion about the petty tyrants had been merely an introd uction to the topi c of aw areness. I remarked that it had ope ned a new view for me. He asked me to expl ain what I meant. I told him that it had to do with an argum ent we had had som e years before about the Yaqui Indi ans. In the cour se of his teachings for the right side, he had tri ed to tell me about the adva ntages that the Yaqui s coul d find in being oppr essed. I had passiona tely argue d that there were no pos sible adva ntages in the wretched condi tions in which they lived. And I had told him that I coul d not unde rstand how , being a Y aqui himself, he did not react against such a flagrant injustice. He had listened attentively. Then, when I was sure he was goi ng to defend his poi nt, he agreed that the condi tions of the Yaqui Indi ans were inde ed wretched. But he poi nted out that it was u seless to single out the Yaqui s when life condi tions of man in general were hor rendous . “Don’ t just feel sorry for the poor Yaqui Indians,” he had said. “Feel sorry for manki nd. In the case of the Yaqui Indi ans, I can even say they’re the lucky one s. They are oppr essed, and because of that, som e of them may com e out"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 trium pha nt in the end. But the oppr essors, the petty tyrants that tread upon them, they don’ t have a chance in hell.” I had immediately answered him with a barrage of pol itical sloga ns. I had no t unde rstood his poi nt at all. He again tried to expl ain to me the conc ept of petty tyrants, but the whol e idea bypa ssed me. It was onl y now that everything fit into place. “Nothing has fit into place yet,” he said, laughi ng at what I had told him. “Tom or row , when you are in your nor mal state of awareness, you won’ t even remember what you ’ve realized now .” I felt utterly depressed, for I kne w he was right . “What’s goi ng to happe n to you is what happe ned to me,” he cont inue d. “My benefactor, the nagua l Juli an, made me realize in height ened awareness what you have realized your self about petty tyrants. And I ende d up, in my daily life, changi ng my opi nions without know ing why. “I had always been oppr essed, so I had real venom tow ard my oppr essors, imagine my surprise when I found myself seeking the com pany of petty tyrants. I thought I had lost my mind. ” We came to a place, on the side of the road, where som e large boul ders were half bur ied by an old lands lide; don Juan headed for them and sat dow n on a flat r ock. He signa led me to sit dow n, facing him. And then without further preliminaries, he started his expl anation of the mastery of awareness. He said that there were a series of truths that seers, old and new, had discove red about awareness, and that such t ruths had been arrange d in a specific seque nce for pur pos es of com prehension."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 He expl ained that the mastery of awareness cons isted in internalizing the total seque nce of such truths. The first truth, he said, was that our familiarity with the world we perc eive com pels us to believe that we are surrounde d by obj ects, existing by themselves and as themselves, just as we perceive them, whereas, in fact, there is no world of obj ects, but a uni verse of the Eagle’s emanations . He told me then that before he coul d expl ain the Eagle’s emanations , he had to talk about the know n, the unknow n, and the unknow able. Most of the truths about awareness were discove red by the old seers, he said. But the order in which they were arrange d had been worked out by the new seers. And without that order thos e truths were nearly incom prehensible. He said that not to seek order was one of the great mistakes that the ancient seers made. A deadly cons eque nce of that mistake was their assum ption that the unknow n and the unknow able are th e same thing. It was up to the new seers to correct that error. They set up bounda ries and defined the unknow n as som ething that is veiled from man, shroude d perhaps by a terrifying cont ext, but which, none theless, is within man’s reach. The unknow n becom es the know n at a given time. The unknow able, on the other hand, is the inde scribable, the unt hinka ble, the unr ealizable. It is som ething that will never be know n to us, and yet it is there, dazzling and at the same time hor rifying in its vastness. “How ca n seers make the distinction between the two?” I asked. “There is a simple rule of thum b,” he said. “In the face of the unknow n, man is adve nturous . It is a qua lity of the unknow n to give us a sense of hope and happi ness. Man feels robus t, exhi larated. Eve n the appr ehension that it arous es is very fulfilling. The new seers saw that man is at his best in the face of the unknow n.”"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 He said that whenever what is taken to be the unknow n turns out to be the unknow able the results are disastrous . Seers feel draine d, conf used. A terrible oppr ession takes pos session of them. Their bodi es lose tone , their reasoni ng and sobr iety wande r away aimlessly, for the un know able has no energizing effects whatsoever. It is not within hum an reach; therefore, it shoul d not be intr uded upon fool ishly or even prude ntly. The new seers realized that they had to be prepared to pay exor bitant prices for the faintest cont act with it. Don Juan expl ained that the new seers had had formidable barriers of tradition to ove rcom e. At the time wh en the new cycle began, none of them kne w for certain which procedur es of their immense tradition were the right one s and which were not . Obvi ous ly, som ething had gone wrong with the ancient seers, but the new seers did not know what. They began by assum in g that everything their predecessors had done was errone ous . Thos e ancient seers had been the masters of conj ecture. They had, for one thing, assum ed that their proficiency in seeing was a safegua rd. They though t that they were unt ouc hable?that is, unt il t he inva ders smashed them, and put most of them to hor rendous deaths. The ancient seers had no protection whatsoever, despite their total certainty that they were invul nerable. The new seers did not waste their time in speculations about what went wrong. In stead, they began to map the unknow n in order to separate it from the unknow able. “How did they map the unknow n, don Juan?” I asked. “Throu gh the cont rolled use of seeing, ” he replied. I said that what I had meant to ask was, what was entailed in mappi ng t he unknow n?"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 He answered that mappi ng the unknow n means making it available to our perception. By steadily practicing seeing, the new seers found that the unknow n and the know n are really on the same foot ing, because bot h are within the reach of hum an perce ption. Seers, in fact, can leave the know n at a given mom ent and enter into the unknow n. Whatever is beyond our capacity to perceive is the unknow able. And the distinction between it and the know able is crucial. Conf using the two woul d put seers in a most precarious pos ition whenever they are conf ront ed with the unknow able. “When this happe ned to the ancient seers,” don Juan went on, “they thought their procedu res had gone hayw ire. It never occurred to them that most of what’s out there is beyond our com pre hension. It was a terrifying error of judg ment on their part, for which they paid dearly.” “What happe ned after the distinction between the unknow n and the unknow able was realized?” I asked. “The new cycle began,” he replied. “That distinction is the front ier between the old and the new. Everything that the new seers have done stems from unde rstandi ng that distinction. ” Don Juan said that seeing was the crucial element in bot h the destruction of the ancient seers’ world and in the recons truction of the new view. It was through seeing that the new seers discove red certain unde niable facts, which they used to arrive at certain conc lusions , revol utiona ry to them, about the nature of man and the world. These conc lusions , which made the new cycle pos sible, were the truths about awareness he was expl aining to me. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 Don Juan asked me to accom pany him to the center of tow n for a stroll around the squa re. On our way, we began to talk about machines and delicate instrum ents. He said that instrum ents are extensions of o ur senses, and I maintained that there are instrum ents that are not in that categor y, because they perform func tions that we are not phys iologically capable of performing. “Our senses are capable of everything, ” he asserted. “I can tell you offhand that th ere are instruments that can detect radio waves that com e from out er space,” I said. “Our senses cannot detect radio waves.” “I have a different idea,” he said. “I think our senses can detect everything we are surrounde d by. ” “What about the case of ultras oni c sounds ?” I insisted. “We don’ t have the organic equi pm ent to hear them.” “It is the seers’ convi ction that we’ve tappe d a very small por tion of our selves,” he replied. He immersed himself in thou ght for a while as if he were trying to decide what to s ay next. Then he smiled. “The first truth about awareness, as I have already told you, ” he began, “is that the world out there is not really as we think it is. We think it is a world of obj ects and it’s not .” He paused as if to measure the effect of his wo rds. I told him that I agreed with his premise, because everything coul d be reduc ed to being a field of energy. He said that I was merely intuiting a truth, and that to reason it out was not to verify it. He was not interested in my agreement or disagree ment, he said, but in my attempt to com prehend what was invol ved in that truth."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 “You cannot witness fields of energy, ” he went on. “Not as an average man, that is. Now , if you were able to see them, you woul d be a seer, in which case you woul d be expl aini ng the truths about awareness. Do you unde rstand what I mean?” He went on to say that conc lusions arrived at through reasoni ng had very little or no influence in altering the cour se of our lives. Hence, the count less examples of peopl e who have the cleare st convi ctions and yet act diametrically against them time and time again; and have as the onl y expl anation for their behavior the idea that to err is hum an. “The first truth is that the world is as it looks and yet it isn’t,” he went on. “It’s not as soli d and real as our perception has been led to believe, but it isn’t a mirage either. The world is not an illusion, as it has been said to be; it’s real on the one hand, and unr eal on the other. Pay close attention to this, for it must be unde rstood, not jus t accepted. We perceive. This is a hard fact. But what we perceive is not a fact of the same kind, because we learn what to perceive. “Som ething out there is affecting ou r senses. This is the part that is real. The unr eal part is what our senses tell us is there. Take a mount ain, for instance. Our senses tell us that it is an obj ect. It has size, color, form. We even have categor ies of mount ains, and they are dow nright accurate. Nothing wrong with that; the flaw is simply that it has never occurred to us t hat our senses play onl y a supe rficial role. Our senses perceive the way they do because a specific feature of our awareness forces them to do so.” I began to agree with him again, but not because I wanted to, for I had not qui te unde rstood his poi nt. Rat her, I was reacting to a threatening situation. He made me stop."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 “I’ve used the term ‘the world, ‘ “ don Juan went on, “to mean everything that surrounds us. I have a better term, of cour se, but it woul d be qui te incom prehensible to you. Seers say that we think there is a world of obj ects out there onl y because of our awareness. But what’s really out there are the Eagle’s emanations , fluid, forever in motion, and yet unc hange d, eternal.” He stoppe d me with a gesture of his hand just as I was about to ask hi m what the Eagle’s emanations were. He expl ained that one of the most dramatic legacies the old seers had left us was their discove ry that the reason for the existence of all sentient beings is to enha nce awareness. Don Juan called it a colossal discove ry. In a halfserious tone he asked me if I kne w of a better answer to the que stion that has always haunt ed man: the reason for our existence. I immediately took a defensive pos ition and began to argue abou t the meaningl essness of the que stion because it canno t be logi cally answered. I told him that in order to discuss that subj ect we woul d have to talk about religious beliefs and turn it all into a matter of faith. “The old seers were not just talking about faith,” he said. “They were not as practical as the n ew seers, but they were practical enough to know what they were seeing. What I was trying to poi nt out to yo u with that que stion, which has rattled you so badly, is that our rationa lity alone cannot com e up with an answer about the reason for our existence . Every time it tries, the answer turns into a matter of beliefs. The old seers took anot her road, and they did find an answer which doe sn’t invol ve faith alone .” He said that the old seers, risking unt old dange rs, actually saw the inde scribable force whic h is the sour ce of all sentient beings . They called it the Eagle, because in the few glimpses that they coul d sustain, they saw it as som ething that resembled a blackandw hite eagle of infinite size."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 They saw that it is the Eagle who bestow s awareness. The Eagle creates sentient beings so that they will live and enrich the awareness it gives them with life. They also saw that it is the Eagle who devour s that same enriched awareness after making sentient beings relinqui sh it at the mom ent of death. “For the o ld seers,” don Juan went on, “to say that the reason for existence is to enha nce awareness is not a matter of faith or deduc tion. They saw it. “They saw that the awareness of sentient beings flies away at the mom ent of death and floats like a lum inous cott on puf f right into the Eagle’s beak to be cons um ed. For the old seers that was the evidence that sentient beings live onl y to enrich the awareness that is the Eagle’s food. ” Don Juan’s elucidation was interrupt ed because he had to leave on a shor t bus ines s trip. Nestor drove him to Oaxaca. As I saw them off, I remembered that at the beginni ng of my association with don Juan, every time he mentione d a bus iness trip I thoug ht he was employi ng a euphe mism for som ething else. I eventually realized that he mean t what he said. Whenever such a trip was about to take place, he woul d put on one of his many immaculately tailored threepiece suits and woul d look like anyt hing bu t the old Indi an I kne w. I had com mented to him about the sophi stication of his metamorphos i s. “A nagua l is som eone flexible enough to be anyt hing, ” he had said. “To be a nagua l, among other things , means to have no poi nts to defend. Remember this?we’ll com e back to it ove r and ove r.” We had com e back to it ove r and ove r, in every pos sible way; h e did inde ed seem to have no poi nts to defend, but dur ing his absence in Oaxaca I was given to just a shadow of doubt .

They told me that I was in qua rantine from that kind of discussion unt il don Juan had finished his expl anation. The mom ent he returned, we sat d ow n to talk and I asked him about it. “Thos e truths are not som ething to defend passiona tely,” he replied. “If you think that I’m trying to defend them, you are mistaken. Thos e truths were put toge ther for the delight and enlight enm ent of warriors, not to enga ge any propr ietary sentiments.

I remarked ove r and ove r about the awesom eness of such an idea. “It is not just an idea,” he said. “It is a fact. And a damn scary one if you ask me. The new seers were not simply playing with ideas.” “But what kind of a force wou ld the Eagle be?” “I woul dn’ t know how to answer that. The Eagle is as real for the seers as gravity and time are for you, and just as abstract and incom prehensible.” “Wait a minut e, don Juan. Thos e are abstract conc epts, but they do refer to real phe nom en a that can be corrobor ated. There are whol e disciplines dedicated to that.” “The Eagle and its emanations are equa lly corrobo ratable,” don Juan retorted. “And the discipline of the new seers is dedicated to doi ng just that.”"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 I asked him to expl ain what the Eagle’s emanations are. He said that the Eagle’s emanations are an immutable thingi nitself, which engul fs everything that exists, the know able and the unknow able. “There is no way to describe in words what the Eagle’s emanations really are,” don Juan cont inue d. “A seer must witness them.” “Have you witnessed them your self, don Juan?” “Of cour se I have, and yet I can’t tell you what they are. They are a presence, almost a mass of sorts, a pressure that creates a dazzling sensation. One can catch onl y a gli mpse of them, as one can catch onl y a glimpse of the Eagle itself.” “Woul d you say, don Juan, that the Eagle is the sour ce of the emanations ?” “It goe s without saying that the Eagle is the sour ce of its emanations .” “I meant to ask if that is so visually.” “There is not hing visual about the Eagle. The entire body of a seer senses the Eagle. There is som ething in all of us that can make us witness with our entire body. Seers expl ain the act of seeing the Eagle in very simple terms: because man is com pos ed of the Eagle’s emanations , man need onl y revert back to his com pone nts. The probl em arises with man’s awareness; it is his awareness that becom es entangl ed and conf used. At the crucial mom ent when it shoul d be a simple case of the emanations acknow ledgi ng t hemselves, man’s awareness is com pelled to interpret. The result is a vision of the Eagle and the Eagle’s emanations . But there is no Eagle and no Eagle’s emanations .

Seers com e in all sizes and shapes.” “Do you mean to say that there are different kinds of seers?” “No. I mean that there are scores of imbeciles who becom e seers. Seers are hum an beings full of foibles, or rather, hum an beings full of foibles are capable of becom ing seers.

A seer must be a paragon in order to ove rride the nearly invincible laxne ss of o ur hum an condi tion. More impor tant than seeing itself is what seers do with what they see.” “What do you mean by that, don Juan?” “Look at what som e seers have done to us. We are stuck with their vision of an Eagle that rules us and devour s us at the mom en t of ou r death.” He said that there is a definite laxne ss in that version, and that persona lly he did not appr eciate the idea of som ething devour ing us. For him, it woul d be more accurate to say that there is a force that attracts our cons cious ness, much a s a magne t attracts iron shavings .

You may resist the temptation to ascribe hum an attribu tes to what is incom prehensible, and actually improvi se a new name for it, a more accurate one .” “Seers who see the Eagle’s emanations often call them com mands ,” don Juan said. “I woul dn’ t mind calling them com mands myself if I hadn ’t got used to calling them emanations . It was a reaction to my benefactor’s preference; for him they were com mands . I thought that term was more in keeping with his forceful persona lity than with mine.

Only a small por tion of thos e emanations is within reach of hum an awareness, and that small por tion is still further reduced, to a minut e fraction, by the cons traints o f our daily lives.

They realized that all living creatures are forced to employ the Eagle’s emanations without ever know ing what they are. They also realized that organisms are cons tructed to grasp a certain range of thos e emanations and that every species has a definite range . The emanations exert great pressure on organisms, and through that pressure organisms cons truct their perceivable world. “In our case, as hum an beings ,” don Juan said, “we employ thos e emanations and interpret them as reality. But what man senses is such a small por tion of the Eagle’s emanations that it’s ridiculous to put much stock in our perceptions , and yet it isn’t pos sible for us to disregard our perceptions .

He thinks that the see rs who called that force the Eagle were either very stupi d or were making a grand joke , because eagles not onl y lay eggs , they also lay turds.” Don Juan laughe d and said that he found Genaro’s com ments so appr opr iate that he coul dn’ t resist laught er. He ad ded that if the new seers had been the one s to describe the Eagle the description woul d certainly have been made half in fun. I told don Juan that on one level I took the Eagle as a poe tic image, and as such it delight ed me, but on anot her level I took it literally, and that terrified me. “One of the greatest forces in the lives of warriors is fear,” he said. “It spur s them to learn.” He reminde d me that the description of the Eagle came from the ancient seers.

They bui lt monum ental edifi ces of abstractions prope r to them and their time. And just like the mode rnda y phi losophe rs, they were not at all in cont rol of their conc atenations . The new seers, on the other hand, imbue d with practicality, were able to see a flux of emanations and to see how man and other living beings utilize them to cons truct their perceivable world. “How are thos e emanations utilized by man, don Juan?” “It’s so simple it sounds idiotic. For a seer, men are lum inous beings . Our lum inos ity is made up of that por tion o f the Eagle’s emanations which is encased in our eggl ike cocoon. That particular por tion, that handf ul of emanations that is encased, is what makes us men. To perceive is to match the emanations cont ained inside our cocoon with thos e that are out side. “See rs can see, for instance, the emanations inside any living creature and can tell which of the out side emanations woul d match them.” “Are the emanations like beams of light ?” I asked. “No. Not at all.

On my left side, he was plain Genaro, or Genarito, with no don attached to his name, a charming and kind seer whos e acts were thor oughl y com prehensible and cohe rent with what I myse lf did or tried to do.

I also said that don Juan, being a true nagua l, transcende d arbi trary standa rds and was respected and adm ired by me in bot h states. “But is he feared?” Genaro asked in a qui vering voi ce."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 “Very feared,” don Juan interjected in a falsetto voi ce. We all laughe d, but don Juan and Genaro laughe d with such abandon that I imm ediately suspected they kne w som ething they were hol ding back. Don Juan was reading me like a book. He expl ained that in the intermediate stage, before one enters fully into the leftside awareness, one is capable of tremendous conc entration, but one is als o susceptible to every conc eivable influence. I was being influenced by suspicion. “La Gorda is always in this stage,” he said. “She learns beautifully, but she’s a roya l pain in the neck. She can’t help being driven by anyt hing that com es her way, includ ing, of corse, very good things , like keen conc entration. ” Don Juan expl ained that the new seers discove red that the transition period is the time when the deepest learning takes place, and that it is also the time when warriors must be supe rvised and expl anations must be given to them so they can evaluate them prope rly. If no expl anations are given to them before they enter into the left side, they will be great sorcerers but poor seers, as the ancient Toltecs were. Female warriors in particular fall prey to the lure of the left side, he said. They are so nimble that they can go into the left side with no effort, often too soon for their ow n good. After a long silence, Genaro fell asleep. Don Juan began to speak. He said that the new seers had had to inve nt a num ber of terms in order to expl ain the second truth about awareness. His benefactor had change d som e of thos e terms to suit himself, and he himself had done the same, gui ded by the seers’ belief that it doe s not make any difference what terms are used as long as the truths have been verified by seeing."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 I was curious to know what terms he had change d, but I didn’ t know qui te how to word my que stion. He took it that I was doubt ing his right or his ability to change them and expl ained that if the terms we propos e originate in our reason they can onl y com muni cate the munda ne agreement of everyda y life. When seers propos e a term, on the other hand, it is never a figur e of speech because it stems from seeing and embraces everything that seers can attain. I ask ed him why he had change d the terms. “It’s a nagua l’s dut y always to look for better ways to expl ain,” he replied. “Time change s everything, and every new nagua l has to incorpor ate new words, new ideas, to describe his seeing. ‘” “Do you mean that a nagua l takes ideas from the world of every day life?” I asked. “No. I mean that a nagua l talks about seeing in ever new ways,” he said. “For instance, as the new nagua l, you’ d have to say that awareness gives rise to perception. You’ d be saying the same thing my benefactor said, but in a different way.” “What do the new seers say perception is, don Juan?” “They say that perception is a condi tion of alignm ent; the emanations inside the cocoon becom e aligne d with thos e out side that fit them. Alignm ent is what allow s awareness to be cultivated by every living creature. Seers make these statements because they see living creatures as they really are: lum inous beings that look like bubbl es of whitish light.” I asked him how the emanations inside the cocoon fit thos e ou tside so as to accom plish perception."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 “The emanations inside and the emanations out side,” he said, “are the same filaments of light. Sentient beings are minu te bubbl es made out of thos e filaments, microscopi c poi nts of light , attached to the infinite emana tions .” He went on to expl ain that the lum inos ity of living beings is made by the particular po rtion of the Eagle’s emanations they happe n to have inside their lum inous cocoons . When seers see perception, they witness that the lum inos ity of the Eagle’s ema nations out side thos e creatures’ cocoons bright ens the lum inos ity of the emanations inside their cocoons . The out side lum inos ity attracts the inside one ; it traps it, so to speak, and fixes it. That fixation is the awareness of every specific being. Seers can also see how the emanations out side the cocoon exert a particular pressure on the por tion of emanations inside. This pressure determines the degree of awareness that every living being has. I asked him to clarify how the Eagle’s emanations out side the cocoon exert pressure on thos e inside. “The Eagle’s emanations are more than filaments of light ,” he replied. “Each one of them is a sour ce of boundl ess energy. Think of it this way: since som e of the emanations out side the cocoon are the same as the emana tions inside, their energies are like a cont inuous pressure. But the cocoon isolates the emanations that are inside its web and thereby directs the pressure. “I’ve mentioned to you that the old seers were masters of the art of handl ing awareness,” he went on. “What I can add now is that they were the masters of that art because they learned to manipul ate the structure of man’s cocoon. I’ve said to you that they unr aveled the mystery of being aware. By that I meant that they saw"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 and realized that awareness is a glow in the cocoon of living beings . They right ly called it the glow of awareness.” He expl ained that the old seers saw that man’s awareness is a glow of amber lum inos ity more intense than the rest of the cocoon. That glow is on a narrow , vertical ban d on the extreme righ t side of the cocoon, runni ng along its entire lengt h. The mastery of the old seers was to move that glow , to make it spread from its original setting on the surface of the cocoon inw ard across its width. He stoppe d talking and looke d at Genaro, who was still sound asleep. “Genaro doe sn’t give a fig about expl anations,” he said. “He’s a doe r. My benefactor pus hed him cons tantly to face insolubl e probl ems. So he entered into the left side prope r and never had a chance to ponde r and wonde r.” “Is it better to be that way, don Juan?” “It depends . For him, it’s perfect. For you and for me, it woul dn’ t be satisfactory, because in one way or anot her we are called upon to expl ain. Genaro or my benefactor are more like the old than the new seers: they can cont rol and do what they want with the glow of awareness.” He stood up from the mat where we were sitting and stretched his arms and legs. I pressed him to cont inue talking. He smiled and said that I needed to rest, that my conc entration was wani ng. There was a knoc k at the door . I woke up. It was dark. For a mom ent I coul d not remember where I was. There was som ething in me that was far away, as if part of me were still asleep, yet I was fully awake. Enough moonl ight came through the ope n wind o w so that I coul d see."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 I saw don Genaro get up and go to the door . I realized then that I was at his hous e. Don Juan was sound asleep on a mat on the floor . I had the distinct impression that the three of us had fallen asleep after returning dead tired fro m a trip to the mount ains. Don Genaro lit his kerosene lantern. I followed him into the kitchen. Som eone had brou ght him a pot of hot stew and a stack of tortillas. “Who brought you food? ” I asked him. “Do you have a wom an around here that cooks for you? ” Don Juan had com e into the kitchen. Both of them looke d at me, smiling. For som e reason their smiles were terrifying to me. I was about to scream in terror, in fact, when don Juan hit me on the back and made me shift into a state of height ened awareness. I realized then that perhaps dur ing my sleep, or as I woke up, I had drifted back to everyda y awareness. The sensation I expe rienced then, onc e I was back in height ened awareness, was a mixture of relief and ange r and the most acute sadne ss. I was relieved that I was myself again, for I had com e to regard thos e incom prehensible states as being my true self. There was one simple reason for that?in thos e states I felt com plete; not hing was missing from me. The ange r and the sadne ss were a reaction to impot ence . I was more aware than ever of the limitations of my being. I asked don Juan to expl ain to me how it was pos sible for me to do what I was doi ng. In states of height ened awareness I coul d look back and remember everything abou t myself; I coul d give an acco unt of everything I had done in either state; I coul d even remember my incapacity to recollect.

Height ened awareness is onl y an intermediate state. There is infinitely more beyond that, and you have been there many, many times. Right now you can’t remember, even if your life d epends on it.” He was right . I had no idea what he was talking about . I pleaded for an expl anation. “The expl anation is com ing, ” he said. “It’s a slow process, but we’ll get to it. It is slow because I am just like you: I like to unde rstand. I am the oppos ite of my benefactor, who was not given to expl aining. For him there was onl y action. He used to put us squa rely against incom prehensible probl ems and let us resolve them for our selves. Som e of us never did resolve anyt hing, and we ende d up very much in th e same boa t with the old seers: all action and no real know ledge .” “Are thos e memories trappe d in my mind?” I asked. “No. That woul d make it too simple,” he replied. “The actions of seers are more com plex than dividing a man into mind and body. You have f orgot ten what you’ ve done , or what you’ ve witnessed, because when you were performing what you’ ve forgot ten you were seeing. ” I asked don Juan to reinterpret what he had just said. Patiently, he expl ained that everything I had forgot ten had taken place in states in which my everyda y awareness had been enha nced, intensified, a condi tion that meant that other areas of my total being were used. “Whatever you’ ve forgot ten is trappe d in thos e areas of your total being, ” he said. “To be using thos e other areas is to see.” “I’m more conf used than ever, don Juan,” I said."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61 “I don’ t blame you, ” he said. “Seeing is to lay bare the core of everything, to witness the unknow n and to glimpse into the unknow able. As such, it doe sn’t bring one solace. Seers ordinarily go to pieces on findi ng out that existence is incom prehensibly com plex and that our no rmal awareness maligns it with its limitations .” He reiterated that my conc entration had to be total, that to unde rstand was of crucial impo rtance, that the new seers placed th e highe st value on deep, une motiona l realizations . “For instance, the other day,” he went on, “when you unde rstood about la Gorda’s and your self - impo rtance, you didn’t unde rstand anyt hing really. You had an emotiona l out bu rst, that was all. I say this bec ause the next day you were back on your high hor se of self - impo rtance as if you never had realized anyt hing. “The same thing happe ned to the old seers. They were given to emotional reactions . But when the time came for them to unde rstand what they had seen , they coul dn’ t do it. To unde rstand one needs sobriety, not emotiona lity. Beware of thos e who weep with realization, for they have realized not hing. “There are unt old dange rs in the path of know ledge for thos e withou t sobe r unde rstandi ng, ” he cont inue d. “I am out lining the order in which the new seers arrange d the truths about awareness, so it will serve you as a map. a map that you have to corrobor ate with your seeing, but not with your eyes.” There was a long pause. He stared at me. He was definitely wa iting for me to ask him a que stion. “Everyb ody falls prey to the mistake that seeing is done with the eyes,” he cont inue d. “But don’ t be surprised that after so many years you haven’t realized yet that seeing is not a matter of the eyes. It’s qui te nor mal to make that mistake.”"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 “What is seeing, then?” I asked. He replied that seeing is alignm ent. And I reminde d him that he had said that perception is alignm ent. He expl ained then that the alignm ent of emanations used rout inely is the perception of the daytod ay world, but the alignm ent of emanations that are never used ordinarily is seeing. When such an alignm ent occurs one sees. Seeing, therefore, being produc ed by align ment out of the ordinary, cannot be som ething one coul d merely look at. He said that in sp ite of the fact that I had seen count less times, it had not occurred to me to disregard my eyes. I had succum bed to the way seeing is labeled and described. “When seers see, som ething expl ains everything as the new alignm ent takes place,” he cont inue d. “It ’s a voi ce that tells them in their ear what’s what. If that voi ce is not present, what the seer is enga ged in isn’t seeing. “ After a mom ent’s pause, he cont inue d expl aining the voi ce of seeing. He said that it was equa lly fallacious to say that seeing wa s hearing, because it was infinitely more than that, but that seers had opt ed for using sound as a gauge of a new alignm ent. He called the voi ce of seeing a most mysterious inexpl icable thing. “My persona l conc lusion is that the voi ce of seeing belongs onl y to man,” he said. “It may happe n because talking is som ething that no one else besides man doe s. The old seers believed it was the voi ce of an ove rpow ering entity intimately related to manki nd, a protector of man. The new seers found out that that entity , which they called the mold of man, doe sn’t have a voi ce. The voi ce of seeing for the new seers is som ething qui te Incom prehensible; they say it’s the glow of awareness playing on the Eagle’s emanations as a harpist plays on a harp.”"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 He refused to expl ain it any further, argui ng that later on, as he proceeded with his expl anation, everything woul d becom e clear to me. My conc entration had been so total while don Juan spoke that I actually did not remember sitting dow n at the table to eat. When don Juan sto ppe d talking, I not iced that his plate of stew was nearly finished. Genaro was staring at me with a beaming smile. My plate was in front of me on the table, and it too was empty. There was onl y a tiny residue of stew left in it, as if I had just finished e ating. I did not remember eating it at all, but neither did I remember walking to the table or sitting do wn. “Did you like the stew?” Genaro asked me and looke d away. I said I did, because I did not want to adm it that I was having probl ems recollecting. “I t had too much chile for my taste,” Genaro said. “You never eat hot food your self, so I’m sort of worried about what it will do to you. You shoul dn’ t have eaten two servings . I suppos e you’ re a little more piggi sh when you’ re in height ened awareness, eh?” I adm itted that he was proba bly righ t.

Genaro sat by me, listening as if he had never heard the expl anation before. Don Juan said that the pressure that the emanations out side the cocoon, which are called emanations at large, exert on the emanations inside the cocoon is the same in all sentient beings . Yet the results of that pressure are vastly different among them, because their cocoons react to that pressure in every conc eivable way. There are. how ever, degrees of uni formity within certain bounda ries. “Now ,” he went on, “when seers see that the pressure of the emanations at large bears dow n on the emanations inside, which are always in motion, and makes them stop movi ng, they know that the lum inous being at that mom ent is fixated by awareness. “To say that the emanations at large bear dow n on thos e inside the cocoon and make them stop movi ng means that seers see som ething inde scribable, the meaning of which they know without a shad ow of doubt . It means that the voi ce of seeing has told them that the emanations inside the cocoon are com pletely at rest and match som e of thos e which are out side.” He said that seers maintain, naturally, that awareness always com es from out side our selves , that the real mystery is not inside us. Since by nature the emanations at large are made to fixate what is inside the cocoon, the trick of awareness is to let the fixating emanations merge with what is inside us. Seers believe that if we let that happe n we becom e what we really are?fluid, forever in motion, eternal. There was a long pause. Don Juan’s eyes had an intense shine. They seemed to be looki ng at me from a great depth. I had the feeling that each of his eyes was"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 an inde pende nt poi nt of brilliance . For an instant he appe ared to be struggl ing against an invi sible force, a fire from within that intende d to cons um e him. It passed and he went on talking. “The degree of awareness of every indi vidu al sentient being, ” he cont inue d, “depends on the degree to which it is capable of letting the pressure of the emanations at large carry it.” After a long interrupt ion, don Juan cont inue d expl aining. He said that seers saw that from the mom ent of conc eption awareness is enha nced, enriched, by the process of bei ng alive. He said that seers saw, for instance, that the awareness of an indi vidua l insect or that of an indi vidua l man grow s from the moment of conc eption in astoundi ng ly different ways, but with equa l cons istency. “Is it from the mom ent of conc eption or from the mom ent of birth that awareness develops ?” I asked. “Awareness develops from the mom ent of conc eption, ” he replied. “I have always told you that sexua l energy is som ething of ultimate impor tance and that it has to be cont rolled and used with great care. But you have always resented what I said, because you thought I was speaking of cont rol in terms of morality; I always meant it in terms of saving and rechanne ling energy. ” Don Juan looke d at Genaro. Genaro nodde d his head in appr ova l. “Genaro is goi ng to tell you what our benefactor, the nagua l Julian, used to say about saving and rechanne ling sexua l energy, ” don Juan said to me. “The nagua l Julian used to say that to have sex is a matter of energy, ” Genaro began. “For instance, he never had any prob lems having sex, because he had bus hels of energy.

The nagua l Julian recom mende d that peopl e like me shoul d never have sex; this way we can store the little energy we have. “He said the sam e thing to Silvio Manue l and to Emilito.

As don Juan was speaking to me, I happe ned to glance at Gen aro. He slow ly shook his head from side to side.

Or rather, the ally ...” Don Juan made a not iceable gesture with his eyebrow s and Genaro stoppe d in midsentence. He smiled at me. “It’s too early in the day for scary stories,” Genaro said. “Let’s wait unt il dark.” He stood up and began creeping all around the rock, tiptoeing with his spine arched backw ard. “What was he saying about your benefactor’s catching an ally here?” I asked don Ju an. He did not answer right away. He was ecstatic, watching Genaro’s antics. “He was referring to som e sophi sticated use of awareness,” he finally replied, still staring at Genaro. Genaro com pleted a circle around the rock and came back and sat dow n by me. He was panting heavily, almost wheezing, out of breath. Don Juan seemed fascinated by what Genaro had done . Again I had the feeling that they were amusing themselves at my expe nse, that bot h of them were up to som ething I kne w not hing about . Sudde nly, don Juan began his expl anation. His voi ce soot hed me. He said that after much toiling, seers arrived at the conc lusion that the cons cious ness of adul t hum an beings , matured by the process of grow th, can no longe r be called"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 awareness, because it has been modi f ied into som ething more intense and com plex, which seers call attention. “How do seers know that man’s awareness is being cultivated and that it grow s?” I asked. He said that at a given time in the grow th of hum an beings a band of the emanations inside the ir cocoons becom es very bright ; as hum an beings accum ulate expe rience, it begins to glow . In som e instances, the glow of this band of emanations increases so dramatically that it fuses with the emanations from the out side. Seers, witnessing an enha ncement of this kind, had to surmise that awareness is the raw material and attention the end produc t of maturation. “How do seers describe attention? ” I asked. “They say that attention is the harnessing and enha ncing of awareness through the process of being aliv e,” he replied. He said that the dange r of definitions is that they simplify matters to make them unde rstanda ble; in this case, in defining attention, one runs the risk of transforming a magical, miraculous accom plishm ent into som ething com monpl ace. Attent ion is man’s greatest singl e accom plishm ent. It develops from raw animal awareness unt il it cove rs the entire gamut of hum an alternatives. Seers perfect it even further un til it cove rs the whol e scope of hum an pos sibilities. I wanted to know if there was a special signi ficance to alternatives and pos sibilities in the seers’ view. Don Juan replied that hum an alternatives are everything we are capable of choos ing as persons .

He said that an example of hum an alternatives is our choi ce to believe that the hu man body is an obj ect among obj ects. An example of hum an pos sibilities is the seers’ achievement in viewing man as an eggl ike lum inous being. With the body as an obj ect one tackles the know n, with the body as a lum inous egg one tackles the unknow n; hum an p ossibilities have, therefore, nearly an inexhaustible scope . “Seers say that there are three type s of attention, ” don Juan went on. “When they say that, they mean it just for hum an beings , not for all the sentient beings in existence. But the three are not just type s of attention, they are rather three levels of attainm ent. They are the first, second, and third attention, each of them an inde pende nt dom ain, com plete in itself.” He expl ained that the first attention in man is animal awareness, which has been develope d, through the process of expe rience, into a com plex, intricate, and extremely fragile faculty that takes care of the daytoda y world in all its innum erable aspects, in other words, everything that one can think about is part of the first attention . “The first attention is everything we are as average men,” he cont inue d. “By virtue of such an absolute rule ove r our lives, the first attention is the most valuable asset that the average man has. Perhaps it is even our onl y asset. “Taking into account its true value, the new seers started a rigor ous examination of the first attention throug h seeing. Their find ings molded their total out look and the out loo k of all their descend ants, even though most of them do not unde rstand what thos e seers really saw.” He empha tically warned me that the conc lusions of the new seers’ rigor ous examination had very little to do with reason or rationa lity, because in order to"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 examine and expl ain the first attention, one must see it. Only seers can do that. But to examine w hat seers see in the first attention is essential. It allow s the first attention the onl y oppo rtun ity it will ever have to realize its ow n workings . “In terms of what seers see, the first attention is the glow of awareness develope d to an ultra shine,” he cont inue d. “But it is a glow fixed on the surface of the cocoon, so to speak. It is a glow that covers the know n. “The second attention, on the other hand, is a more com plex and specialized state of the glow of awareness. It has to do with the unknow n. It com es about when unus ed emanations inside man’s cocoon are utilized. “The reason I called the second attention specialized is that in order to utilize thos e unus ed emanations , one needs unc om mon, elabor ate tactics that requi re supr eme discipline and conc en tration. ” He said that he had told me before, when he was teaching me the art of dreaming, that the conc entration needed to be aware that one is having a dream is the forerunne r of the second attention. That conc entration is a form of cons cious ness that is not in the same category as the cons cious ness needed to deal with the daily world. He said that the second attention is also called the leftside awareness; and it is the vastest field that one can imagine, so vast in fact that it seems limitless. “I woul d n’t stray into it for anyt hing in this world,” he went on. “It is a qua gm ire so com plex and bizarre that sobe r seers go into it onl y unde r the strictest condi tions . “The great difficulty is that the entrance into the second attention is utterly easy and it s lure nearly irresistible.”"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 He said that the old seers, being the masters of awareness, appl ied their expe rtise to their ow n glow s of awareness and made them expa nd to inconc eivable limits. They actually aimed at light ing up all the emanations inside thei r cocoons , one band at a time. They succeeded, but oddly enough the accom plishm ent of light ing up one band at a time was instrum ental in their becom ing imprisone d in the qua gm ire of the second attention. “The new seers corrected that error,” he cont inue d, “and let the mastery of awareness develop to its natural end, which is to extend the glow of awareness beyond the bounds of the lum ino us cocoon in one singl e stroke . “The third attention is attained when the glow of awareness turns into the fire from withi n: a glow that kindl es not on e band at a time but all the Eagle’s emanations inside man’s cocoon. ” Don Juan expr essed his awe for the new seers’ deliberate effort to attain the third attention while they are alive and cons cious of their indi vidua lity. He d id not cons ider it worthw hile to discuss the random cases of men and other sentient beings who enter into the unk now n and the unknow able withou t being aware of it; he referred to this as the Eagle’s gift. He asserted that for the new seers to enter into th e third attention is also a gift, but has a different meaning, it is more like a reward for an attainm ent. He adde d that at the mom ent of dyi ng all hum an beings enter into the unknow able and som e of them do attain the third attention, but altoge ther too br iefly and onl y to pur ify the food for the Eagle. “The supr eme accom plishm ent of hum an beings ,” he said, “is to attain that level of attention while retaining the lifeforce, without becom ing a disembodi ed awareness movi ng like a flicker of light up to the E agle’s beak to be devour ed.”"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 While listening to don Juan’s expl anation I had again com pletely lost sight of everything that surroun ded me.

There was a soft breeze blow ing from the west. “Don’ t fall asleep,” don Juan said. “Not for any reason shoul d you fall asleep on this rock.” I sat up. Don Juan was staring at me. “Just relax,” he went on. “Let the internal dialogue die out .” All my conc entration was invol ved in following what he was saying when I got a jolt of fright.

What I had thought was an hour ’s conve rsation had cons um ed an entire day. I jum ped up, fully aware of the incong ruity, although I co uld not conc eive what had happe ned to me. I felt a strange sensation that made my body want to run. Don Juan jum ped me, restraining me forcefully. We fell to the soft ground, and he held me there with an iron grip. I had had no idea that don Juan was so strong. My body shook violently. My arms flew every which way as they shook. I was having som ething like a seizure.

He answered that as he t alked to me I had pus hed beyond a certain limit and had entered very deeply into the left side. He and Genaro had follow ed me in there. And then I had rushed out in the same fashion I had rushed in. “I caught you right on time,” he said. “Otherwise you wou ld have gone straight out to your no rmal self.” I was totally conf used. He expl ained that the three of us had been playing with awareness. I must have got ten scared and run out on them. “Genaro is the master of awareness,” don Juan went on. “Silvio Manue l is the master of wilt. The two of them were mercilessly pus hed into the unknow n. My benefactor did to them what his benefactor did to him. Genaro and Silvio Manue l are very much like the old seers in som e respects. They know what they can do, but they don ’t care to know how they do it.

You will, how ever, when you rekindl e the emanations that were g low ing when you witnessed the mystery of awareness i’m referring to. In the meantime, let’s go back to our expl anation of awareness.” He reiterated that awareness begins with the permanent pressure that the emanations at large exert on the one s trappe d ins ide the cocoon.

Since they coul d not expl ain it, for there is no ration al way to unde rstand existence, seers realized that their know ledge is com pos ed of cont radictory propos itions . “Why did they develop a system of cont radictions ?” I asked. “They didn’ t develop anyt hing,” he said. “They foun d unque stiona ble truths by means o f their seeing.

The mom ent the pressure from the emanations at large fixates the emanations inside, the first attention begins to watch itself. It not es everything about itself, or at least it tries to , in whatever aberrant ways it can. This is the process seers call taking an inve ntory. “I don’ t mean to say that hum an beings choos e to take an inve ntory, or that they can refuse to take it. To take an inve ntory is the Eagle’s com mand. What is subj ect to vol ition, how ever, is the manne r in which the com mand is obe yed.” He said that although he disliked calling the emanations com mands , that is what they are: com mands that no one can disobe y. Yet the way out of obe ying the com mands is in obe ying them. “In t he case of the inve ntory of the first attention, ” he went on, “seers take it, for they can’t disobe y. But onc e they have taken it they throw it away. The Eagle doe sn’t com mand us to worship our inventory; it com mands us to take it, that’s all.” “How do see rs see that man takes an inve ntory?” I asked. “The emanations inside the cocoon of man are not qui eted dow n for pur pos es of matching them with thos e out side,” he replied. “This is evident after seeing what other creatures do.

Don Juan remarked that reason in the hum an species shoul d be bount iful, but that in actuality it is very rare. The majority of hum an beings turn to selfabsorption. He asserted that the awareness of all living beings has a degree of selfreflection in order for them to interact. But none except ma n’s first attention has such a degree of selfabsorption. Cont rary to men of reason, who ignor e the impul se of the emanations at large, the selfabsorbed indi viduals use every impul se and turn them all into a force to stir the trapped emanations inside their cocoons . Observing all this, seers arrived at a practical conc lusion. They saw that men of reason are bound to live longe r, because by disregarding the impul se of the emanations at large, they qui et dow n the natural agitation inside their cocoons .

When the new seers arrange d the order of the truths about awareness, th ey saw that the first attention cons um es all the glow of awareness that hum an beings have, and not an iota of energy is left free.

I asked him what eradicating unne cessary habits did to the glow of awareness. He replied that it detaches awareness from selfreflection and allow s it the freedom to focus on som ething else. “The unknow n is forever present,” he cont inue d, “but it is out side the pos sibility of ou r nor mal awareness. The unknow n is the sup erfluous part of the average man. And it is supe rfluous because the average man doe sn’t have enough free energy to grasp it. “After all the time you’ ve spent in the warrior’s path, you have enough free energy to grasp the unknow n, but not enou gh energy to unde rstand it or even to remember it.” He expl ained that at the site of the flat rock, I had entered very deeply into the unknow n. But I indul ged in my exagge rated nature and became terrified, which was about the worst thing anyone can do. So I had rushed out of the left side, like a bat out of hell; unf ortuna tely, taking a legion of strange things with me.

He took m e by the arm and cont inue d strolling around with me. “In expl aining awareness,” he said, “I am presum ably fitting everything or nearly everything into place.

We sat dow n there and he began his elucidation. “The new seers were simply terrified by the know ledge that the old seers had accum ulated ove r the years,” don Juan said. “It’s unde rstanda ble. The new seers kne w that that know l edge leads onl y to total destruction. Yet they were also fascinated by it?especially by the practices.” “How did the new seers know about thos e practices?” I asked. “They are the legacy of the old Toltecs,” he said. “The new seers learn about them as they go along. They hardly ever use them, but the practices are there as part of their know ledge .” “What kind of practices are they, don Juan?” “They are very obs cure formulas, incantations , lengt hy procedur es that have to do with the handl ing of a very myster iou s force. At least it was mysterious to the ancient Toltecs, who masked it and made it more hor rifying than it really is.” “What is that mysterious force?” I asked. “It’s a force that is present throughou t everything there is,” he said. “The old seers ne ver attempted to unr avel the mystery of the force that made them create their secret practices; they simply accepted it as som ething sacred. But the new seers took a close look and called it wilt, the will of the Eagle’s emanations , or intent.”’ Don Juan w ent on expl aining that the ancient Toltecs had divided their secret know ledge into five sets of two categor ies each: the earth and the dark regions , fire and water, the above and the below , the loud and the silent, the movi ng and the stationa ry. He specula ted that there must have been thous ands of different techni que s, which became more and more intricate as time passed."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 “The secret know ledge of the earth,” he went on, “had to do with everything that stands on the ground.

And their secret know ledge of the earth was employe d either to groom or to d estroy anyt hing that stands on the ground. “The count erpart of the earth was what they kne w as the dark regions . These practices were by far the most dange rous . They dealt with entities without organic life. Living creatures that are present on the earth a nd popul ate it toge ther with all organic beings . “Doubt lessly, one of the most worthw hile findi ngs of the ancient seers, especially for them, was the discove ry that organic life is not the onl y form of life present on this earth.” I did not qui te com prehen d what he had said. I waited for him to clarify his statements. “Organic beings are not the onl y creatures that have life,” he said and paused again as if to allow me time to think his statements ove r. I count ered with a long argu ment about the definition of life and being alive. I talked about reprod uction, metabol ism, and grow th, the processes that distingui sh live organisms from inanimate things . “You’ re drawing from the organic,” he said. “But that’s onl y one instance.

But there are other creatures whos e receptacles don’ t look like a cocoon to a seer. Yet they have the emanations of awareness i n them and characteristics of life other than reproduc tion and metabol ism.” “Such as what, don Juan?” “Such as emotiona l depende ncy, sadne ss, joy, wrath, and so forth and so on. And I forgo t the best yet, love ; a kind of love man can’t even conc eive.” “Are you serious , don Juan?” I asked in earnest. “Inanimately serious,” he answered with a deadpa n expr ession and then broke into laught er. “If we take as our clue what seers see,” he cont inue d, “life is inde ed extraordinary.” “If thos e beings are alive, why d on’ t they make themselves know n to man?” I asked. “They do, all the time. And not onl y to seers but also to the average man. The probl em is that all the energy available is cons um ed by the first attention. Man’s inve ntory not onl y takes it all, but it als o toughe ns the cocoon to the poi nt of making it inflexible. Unde r thos e circum stances there is no pos sible interaction. ” He reminde d me of the count less times, in the cour se of my appr enticeship with him, when I had had a firsthand view of inor ganic being s. I retorted that I had expl ained away nearly every one of thos e instances. I had even formulated the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 hypot hesis that his teachings , through the use of hallucinoge nic plants, were geared to force an agreement, on the part of the appr entice, about a primit ive interpretation of the world.

I think I like you best when you are way inside the left side, in spite of the fact that you are terribly afraid of everything, as you were yesterday.” Before I had time to say anyt hing at all, he stated that he was pitting what the old seers did against the accom plishm ents of the new seers, as a sort of count erpoi nt, with which he intende d to give me a more inclusive view of the odds I was up against. He cont inue d then with his elucidation of the practices of the old seers. He said that anot her of their great findi ngs had to do with the next categor y of secret know ledge : fire and water. They discove red that flames have a most peculiar qua lity; they can transpor t man bodi ly, just as water doe s. Don Juan called it a brilliant discove ry. I remarked that there are basic laws of phys ics that woul d prove that to be impo ssible. He asked me to wait unt il he had expl ained everything before drawing any conc lusions . He remarked that I had to check my excessive rationa lity, because it cons tantly affected my states of height ened awareness. It was not a case of reacting every which way to extern al influences, but of succum bing to my ow n devices."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 He went on expl aining that the ancient Toltecs, although they obvi ous ly saw, did not unde rstand what they saw. They merely used their findi ngs without bot hering to relate them to a larger picture. In the case of their categor y of fire and water, they divided fire into heat and flame, and water into wetness and fluidity. They correlated heat and wetness and called them lesser prope rties. They cons idered flames and fluidity to be highe r, magical prope rties, and they used them as a means for bodi ly transpo rtation to the realm of nonor ganic life. Between their know ledge of that kind of life and their fire and water practices, the ancient seers became bogge d dow n in a qua gm ire with no way out . Don Juan assured m e that the new seers agreed that the discove ry of nonor ganic living beings was inde ed extraordinary, but not in the way the old seers believed it to be. To find themselves in a one toone relation with anot her kind of life gave the ancient seers a false feel ing of invul nerability, which spelled their doom . I wanted him to expl ain the fire and water techni que s in greater detail. He said that the old seers’ know ledge was as intricate as it was useless and that he was onl y goi ng to out line it. Then he sum marized the practices of the above and the below . The above dealt with secret know ledge about wind, rain, sheets of light ning, clouds , thunde r, daylight , and the sun. The know ledge of the below had to do with fog, water of unde rground springs , swamps, light ning b olts, earthqua kes, the night , moonl ight , and the moon. The loud and the silent were a categor y of secret know ledge that had to do with the manipul ation of sound and qui et. The movi ng and the stationa ry were practices conc erned with mysterious aspects of mo tion and motion lessness."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 I asked him if he coul d give me an example of any of the techni que s he had out lined.

He seemed to be either angr y at me for asking que stions or serious ly invol ved in searching for a goo d example. After a while he smiled and said that he had visualized the prope r example. “The techni que I have in mind has to be put in action in the shallow depths of a stream,” he said. “There is one near Genaro’s hous e.” “What will I have to do? ” “You’ ll have to get a medium size mirror.” I was surprised at his reque st. I remarked that the ancient Toltecs did not know about m irrors. “They didn’ t,” he adm itted, smiling. “This is my benefactor’s addi tion to the techni que . All the ancient seers needed was a reflecting surface.” He expl ained that the techni que cons isted of subm erging a shiny surface into the shallow water of a str eam. The surface coul d be any flat obj ect that had som e capacity to reflect images. “I want you to cons truct a solid frame made of sheet metal for a medium size mirror,” he said. “it has to be waterproof , so you must seal it with tar.

His benefactor, the nagua l Ellas, gave him an example; my benefactor in turn gave the same one to me, and now I am goi ng to give it to you. “ At the time my benefactor gave me the example I didn’ t kno w how he did it. I know now . Som eday you your self will also know how the techni que works; you will unde rstand what’s behind all this.” I thought that don Juan wanted me to go back hom e to Los Ange le s and cons truct the frame for the mirror there. I com mented that it woul d be impos sible for me to remember the task if I did not remain in height ened awareness. “There are two things out of kilter with you r com ment,” he said. “One is that there is no way f or you to remain in height ened awareness, because you won’ t be able to func tion unl ess I or Genaro or any of the warriors in the nagua l’s party nur se you every minut e of the day, as I do now . The other is that Mexico is not the moon. There are hardw are sto res here.

Don Juan told me to put it in the trunk of my car. He did not so much as glance at it. We drove back to Genaro’s hous e in the late afternoon and arrived there in the early morning. I looke d for Genaro. He was not there. The hous e seemed deserted."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 “Why doe s Genaro keep this hous e?” I asked don Juan. “He lives with you, doe sn’t he?” Don Juan did not answer. He gave me a strange look and went to light the kerosene lantern. I was alone in the room in total darkne ss. I felt a great tiredne ss that I attribut ed to the long, tortuous drive up the mount ains. I wanted to li e dow n. In the darkne ss, I coul d not see where Genaro had put the mats. I stum bled ove r a pile of them. And then I kne w why Genaro kept that hous e; he took care of the male appr entices Pablito, Nestor, and Benigno, who lived there when they were in their s tate of nor mal awareness. I felt exhi larated; I was no longe r tired. Don Juan came in with a lantern. I told him about my realization, but he said that it did not matter, that I woul d not remember it for too long. He asked me to show him the mirror. He see med pleased and remarked about its being light yet solid. He not iced that I had used metal screws to affix an alum inu m frame to a piece of sheet metal that I had used as a backing for a mirror eight een inches long by four teen inches wide. “I made a woode n frame for my mirror,” he said. “This looks much better than mine. My frame was too cum bersom e and at the same time frail. “Let me expl ain what we’re goi ng to do, ” he cont inue d after he had finished examining the mirror. “Or perhaps I shoul d say, what we’ re goi ng to attempt to do.

Even more odd was the crispne ss of our reflections , it was as if my face had been magni fied, not in size but in focus. I coul d see the por es in the skin of my forehead. Don Juan gently whispered not to stare at my eyes or his, but to let my gaze wande r around without focusing on any part of our reflections . “Gaze fixedly without staring!” he repeatedly ordered in a forceful whisper. I did what he said without stoppi ng to pond er about the seeming cont radiction.

I felt that I was encased in a force greater than myself. I was not in pain or even angui shed. I felt not hing.

I realized that I was standi ng up. Don Juan was hol ding the mirro r edge wise to let the water drip off. We walked back to the hous e in silence. “The ancient Toltecs were simply mesmerized by their findi ngs ,” don Juan said. “I can unde rstand why, ” I said. “So can I,” don Juan retorted. The force that had enve lope d me had been so pow erful as to incapacitate me for speech, even for thought , for hou rs afterward. It had frozen me with a total lack of vol ition. And I had thawed out onl y by tiny degrees. “Without any deliberate intervention on our part,” don Juan cont inue d, “th is ancient Toltec techni que has been divided into two parts for you. The first was just"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 enough to familiarize you with what takes place. In the second, we will try to accom plish what the old seers pur sued.” “What really took place out there, don Juan?” I asked. “There are two versions . I’ll give you the old seers’ version first. They thought that the reflecting surface of a shiny obj ect subm erged in water enlarges the pow er of the water. What they used to do was gaze into bodi es of water, and the reflectin g surface served them as an aid to accelerate the process. They believed that our eyes are the keys to entering into the unknow n; by gazing into water, they were allow ing the eyes to ope n the way.” Don Juan said that the old seers obs erved that the wetness of water onl y dampens or soaks, but that the fluidity of water move s. It runs , they surmised, in search of other levels unde rneath us. They believed that water had been given to us not onl y for life, but also as a link, a road to the other levels below . “ Are there many levels below ?” I asked. “The ancient seers count ed seven levels,” he replied. “Do you know them your self, don Juan?” “I am a seer of the new cycle, and cons eque ntly I have a different view,” he said. “I am just show ing you what the old seers did and I’m telling you what they believed.” He asserted that just because he had different views did not mean the old seers’ practices were inva lid; their interpretations were wrong, but their truths had practical value for them. In the instance of the w ater practices, they were convi nced that it was hum anly pos sible to be transpor ted bodi ly by the fluidity of water anyw here between this level of our s and the other seven levels below ; or to be transpor ted in essence anyw here on this level, along the water cour se of a river"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 100 in either direction. They used, accordingl y, runni ng water to be transpor ted on this level of our s and the water of deep lakes or that of waterhol es to be transpor ted to the depths. “What they pur sued with the techni que I’m show ing you wa s twofold,” he went on. “On the one hand they used the fluidity of the water to be transpo rted to the first level below . On the other, they used it to have a facetoface meeting with a living being from that first level. The headlike shape in the mirror was one of thos e creatures that came to look us ove r.” “So, they really exist!” I exclaimed. “They certainly do, ” he retorted. He said that ancient seers were damaged by their aberrant insistence on staying glued to their procedu res, but that whatever they fo und was valid. They found out that the surest way to meet one of thos e creatures is through a body of water. The size of the body of water is not relevant; an ocean or a pond serves the same pur pos e. He had chos en a small stream because he hated to get wet . We coul d have got ten the same results in a lake or a large river. “The other life com es to find ou t what’s go ing on when hum an beings call,” he cont inue d. “That Toltec techni que is like a knoc k on their door . The old seers said the shiny surface on the b ottom of the water served as a bait and a window . So hum ans and thos e creatures meet at a window .” “Is that what happe ned to me there?” I asked. “The old seers woul d’ve said that you were being pul led by the pow er of the water and the pow er of the first le vel, plus the magne tic influence of the creature at the window .” “But I heard a voi ce in my ear saying that I was dyi ng, ” I said."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 101 “The voi ce was right . You were dyi ng, and you woul d have if I hadn’ t been there. That is the dange r of practicing the Toltecs’ techni que s.

Seeing that shape in the mirror and having the sensation of an enve lopi ng force aroun d me had prove d too much fo r me the day before. “I don’ t want to alarm you, ” he said, “but nothing has happe ned to you yet. If what happe ned to me is goi ng to be the gui deline of what will happe n to you, you’ d better prepare your self for the shoc k of your life.

It’s just the situation. My benefactor made me go throu gh the same motions , and looki ng at you I can’t help seeing myself.” I told him that I felt sick to my stom ach. He said that that was fine, that it was natural to be scared, and that to cont rol fear was wrong and senseless. The ancient seers got trappe d by suppr essing their terror when they shoul d have been scared out of their wits. Since they did not want to stop their pur suits or abandon their com forting cons tructs they cont rolled their fear instead. “What else are we goi ng to do with the mirror?” I asked. “That mirror is goi ng to be used for a facetoface meeting between you and that creature you onl y gazed at yesterday.”"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 “What happe ns in a facetoface meeting? ” “What happe ns is that one form of life, the hum an form, meets anot her form of life. The old seers said that in this case, it is a c reature from the first level of the fluidity of water.” He expl ained that the ancient seers surmised that the seven levels below our s were levels of the fluidity of water. For them a spring had unt old signi ficance, because they thought that in such a case the fluidity of water is reversed and goe s from the depth to the surface. They took that to be the means whereby creatures from other levels, these other forms of life, com e to our plane to peer at us, to obs erve us. “In this respect thos e old seers were n ot mistaken,” he went on. “They hit the nail right on the head. Entities that the new seers call allies do appe ar around waterhol es.” “Was the creature in the mirror an ally?” I asked. “Of cour se. But not one that can be utilized. The tradition of the alli es, which I have acqua inted you with in the past, com es directly from the ancient seers. They did wonde rs with allies, but not hing they did was worth anyt hing when the real enemy came along: their fellow men.” “Since thos e creatures are allies, they must be very dange rous ,” I said. “As dange rous as we men are, no more, no less.” “Can they kill us?” “Not directly, but they certainly can fright en us to death. They can cross the bounda ries themselves, or they can just come to the window . As you may have reali zed by now , the ancient Toltecs didn’ t stop at the window , either. They found weird ways to go beyond it.”"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 103 The second stage of the techni que proceeded very much as had the first except that it took perhaps twice as long for me to relax and stop my interna l turmoil.

I expe cted the ally to appe ar any mom ent, but not hing happe ned. My neck hur t. My back was stiff and my legs were num b. I wanted to kne el on the rock to relieve the pain in my low er back.

It was a sadne ss that had no precise founda tion; I associated it with the memory of the depths I had seen in the mirror. It was a mixtu re of pur e lon ging for thos e depths plus an absolute fear of their chilling solitude . Don Juan remarked that in the life of warriors it was extremely natural to be sad for no ove rt reason. Seers say that the lum inous egg, as a field of energy, senses its f inal destination whenever the bo unda ries of the know n are broke n. A mere glimpse of the eternity out side the cocoon is enough to disrupt the coziness of our inve ntory. The resulting melanchol y is som etimes so intense that it can bring about death.

He com mented in a mocking tone that my first attention was doi ng everything to restore the order that had been disrupt ed by my cont act with the ally.

The same prevails for man. If seers venture into a level of thos e creatures, chances are they are never heard of again. “My mirror was shattered with the ally’s force,” he said. “There was no more window and the ally coul dn ’t go back, so it came after me. It actually ran after me, rolling on itself. I scrambled on all four s at top speed, screaming with terror. I went up and dow n hills like a pos sessed man.

That day, as the ally chased me in circles, my benefactor stood there and defende d himself from my accusations . I onl y heard bits of his long speech every time I ran by him. When he was through with that, I heard bits of anot her long expl anation: that he had to gather a great deal of wood, that the ally was big, that the fire had to be as big as the ally itself, that the maneuve r might not work. “Only my madde ning fear kept me goi ng. Finally he must h ave realized that I was about to drop dead from exha ustion; he bui lt the fire and with the flames he shielded me from the ally.” Don Juan said that they stayed by the fire for the entire night . The worst time for him was when his benefactor had to go away to look for more dry branches and left him alone . He was so afraid that he prom ised to God that he was goi ng to leave the path of know ledge and becom e a farmer."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 “In the morning, after I had exha usted all my energy, the ally managed to shove me into the fir e, and I was badly bur ned,” don Juan adde d. “What happe ned to the ally?” I asked. “My benefactor never told me what happe ned to it,” he replied. “But I have the feeling that it is still runni ng around aimlessly, trying to find its way back.” “And what happ ened to your prom ise to God? ” “My benefactor said not to worry, that it had been a good prom ise, but that I didn’ t kno w yet that there is no one to hear such prom ises, because there is no God. All there is is the Eagle’s emanations , and there is no way to make prom ises to them.” “What woul d have happe ned if the ally had caught you? ” I asked. “I might have died of fright ,” he said. “If I had know n what was entailed in being caught I woul d’ve let it catch me. At that time I was a reckless man. Once an ally c atches you, you either have a heart attack and die or you wrestle with it. Then after a mom ent of thrashing around in sham ferocity, the ally’s energy wanes. There is not hing that an ally can do to us, or vice versa. We are separated by an abys s. “The anci ent seers believed that at the mom ent the ally’s energy dw indl es the ally surrende rs its pow er to man. Pow er, my eye! The old seers had allies com ing out of their ears and their allies’ pow er didn’ t mean a thing. ” Don Juan expl ained that onc e again it had been up to the new seers to straight en out this conf usion. They had fou nd that the onl y thing that count s is impeccability, that is, freed energy. There were inde ed som e among the ancient seers who were saved by their allies, but that had had not hing to do with the allies’"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 111 pow er to fend off anyt hing; rather, it was the impeccability of the men that had permitted them to use the energy of thos e other forms of life. The new seers also found out the most impor tant thing yet about the allies: what makes them us eless or usable to man. Useless allies, of which there are stagge ring num bers, are thos e that have emanations inside them for which we have no match inside our selves. They are so different from us as to be thor oughl y unus able. Other allies, which are rema rkably few in num ber, are akin to us, meaning that they pos sess occasiona l emanations that match our s. “How is that kind utilized by man?” I asked. “We shoul d use anot her word instead of ‘utilize, ‘ “ he replied. “I’d say that what takes place between seer s and allies of this kind is a fair exchange of energy. ” “How doe s the exchange take place?” I asked. “Throu gh their matching emanations ,” he said. “Thos e emanations are, naturally, on the leftside awareness of man; the side that the average man never use s. For this reason, allies are totally barred from the world of the right side awareness, or the side of rationa lity.” He said that the matching emanations give bot h a com mon groun d. Then, with familiarity, a deeper link is established, which allow s bot h fo rms of life to profit. Seers seek the allies’ ethereal qua lity; they make fabul ous scout s and gua rdians. Allies seek the greater energy field of man, and with it they can even materialize themselves. He assured me that expe rienced seers play thos e shared e manations unt il they bring them into total focus; the exchange lakes place at that time. The ancient seers did not unde rstand this process, and they develope d com plex techni que s of gazing in order to descend into the depths that I had seen in the mirror."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 112 “ The old seers had a very elabor ate tool to help them in their descent,” he went on. “It was a rope of special twine that they tied around their waist. It had a soft but t soaked in resin which fitted into the navel itself, like a plug. The seers had an assi stant or a num ber of them who held them by the rope while they were lost in their gazing. Naturally, to gaze directly into the reflection of a deep, clear pond or lake is infinitely more ove rwhelming and dange rous than what we did with the mirror.” “But di d they actually descend bodi ly?” I asked. “You’ d be surprised what men are capable of, especially if they cont rol awareness,” he replied. “The old seers were aberrant. In their excursions to the depths they found marvels. It was rout ine for them to encount er allies. “Of cour se, by now you realize that to say the depths is a figur e of speech. There are no depths, there is onl y the handl ing of awareness. Yet the old seers never made that realization. ” I told don Juan that from what he had said about his expe r ience with the ally, plus my ow n subj ective impression on feeling the ally’s thrashing force in the water, I had conc lude d that allies are very aggr essive. “Not really,” he said. “It is not that they don’ t have enough energy to be aggr essive, but rather th at they have a different kind of energy. They are more like an electric current. Organic beings are more like heat waves.” “But why did it chase you for such a long time?” I asked. “That’s no mystery,” he said. “They are attracted to emotions . Animal fear is what attracts them the most; it releases the kind of energy that suits them. The emanations inside them are rallied by animal fear. Since my fear was relentless the ally went after it, or rather, my fear hooke d the ally and didn’ t let it go. ”"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 He said that it was the old seers who found out that allies enjoy animal fear more than anyt hing else. They even went to the extreme of pur pos ely feeding it to their allies by actually scaring peopl e to death. The old seers were convi nced that the allies had hum an feelings , but the new seers saw it differently. They saw that allies are attracted to the energy released by emotions ; love is equa lly effective, as well as hatred, or sadne ss. Don Juan adde d that if he had felt love for that ally, the ally woul d have com e after him anyw ay, although the chase woul d have had a different mood. I asked him whether the ally woul d have stoppe d goi ng after him if he had cont rolled his fear. He answered that cont rolling fear was a trick of the old seers. They learned to cont rol i t to the poi nt of being able to parcel it out . They hooke d their allies with their ow n fear and by gradua lly dol ing it out . like food, they actually held the allies in bonda ge. “Thos e old seers were terrifying men,” don Juan cont inue d. “I shoul dn’ t use the past tense -- they are terrifying even tod ay. Their bid is to dom inate, to master everybody and everything. ” “Even toda y, don Juan?” I asked, trying to get him to expl ain further. He change d the subj ect by com menting that I had missed the oppor tuni ty of b eing really scared beyond measure. He said that doubt less the way I had sealed the frame of the mirror with tar had prevented the water from seeping behind the glass. He count ed that as the deciding factor that had kept the ally from smashing the mirror. “ Too bad,” he said. “You might even have liked that ally. By the way, it was not the same one that came the day before. The second one was perfectly akin to you. ”"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 114 “Don’ t you have som e allies your self, don Juan?” I asked. “As you know , I have my benefactor’s allies,” he said. “I can’t say that I have the same feeling for them that my benefactor did. He was a serene but thor oug hly passiona te man, who lavishly gave away everything he pos sessed, includi ng his energy. He love d his allies. To him it was no sweat t o allow the allies to use his energy and materialize themselves. There was one in particular that coul d even take a grotesque hum an form.” Don Juan went on to say that since he was not partial to allies, he had never given me a real taste of them, as his benefactor had done to him while he was still recove ring from the woun d in his chest. It all began with the thought that his benefactor was a strange man. Having barely escaped from the clutches of the petty tyrant, don Juan suspected that he had fallen in to anot her trap. His intention was to wait a few days to get his strengt h back and then run away when the old man was not hom e. But the old man must have read his thought s, because one day, in a conf idential tone , he whispered to don Juan that he ought to get well as qui ckly as pos sible so that the two of them coul d escape from his captor and tormentor. Then, shaking with fear and impot ence, the old man flung the door ope n and a mons trous fishfaced man came into the room , as if he had been listening behind the door .

One day he started it again. A strange event trigge red it. Don Juan was in nor thern Mexico. It was late afternoon. I had just arrived at the hous e he kept there, and he immediately had me shift into height ened awareness. And I had instantly remembered that don Juan a lways came back to Sonor a as means of renewal. He had expl ained that a nagua l, being a leader who has tremendous respons ibilities, has to have a phys ical poi nt of reference, a place where an amenable conf luence of energies occurs. The Sonor an desert was su ch a place for him. On entering into heigh tened awareness, I had not iced that there was anot her person hiding in the semidarkne ss inside the hous e. I asked don Juan if Genaro was with him. He replied that he was alone , that what I had not iced was one of hi s allies, the one that gua rded the hous e. Don Juan then made a strange gesture. He cont orted his face as if he were surprised or terrified. And instantly the frightening shape of a strange man appe ared at the door of the room where we were. The presence of the strange man scared me so much that I actually felt dizzy. And before I coul d recupe rate from my fright, the man lurched at me with a chilling ferocity. As he grabbe d my forearms, I felt ajolt of som ething qui te like a discharge of an electric current."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 117 I was speechless, caught in a terror I coul d not dispel. Don Juan was smiling at me. I mum bled and groaned, trying to vo ice a plea for help, while I felt an even greater jolt. The man tight ened his grip and tried to throw me backw ard on the ground. Don Ju an, with no hur ry in his voi ce, urged me to pul l myself toge ther and not fight my fear, but roll with it. “Be afraid without being terrified,” he said. Don Juan came to my side and, without intervening in my struggl e, whispered in my ear that I shoul d put all my conc entration on the midpoi nt of my bod y. Over the years, he had insisted that I measure my body to the hundr edth of an inch and establish its exact midpoi nt, lengt hw ise as well as in width. He had always said that such a poi nt is a true center of e nergy in all of us. As soon as I had focused my attention on that midpoi nt, the man let go of me. At that instant I became aware that what I had thought was a hum an being was som ething that onl y loo ked like one . The mom ent it lost its hum an shape to me, th e ally became an amorphous blob of opa que light . It move d away. I went after it, move d by a great force that made me follow that opa que light . Don Juan stoppe d me. He gently walked me to the por ch of his hous e and made me sit dow n on a sturdy crate he used as a bench. I was terribly disturbed by the expe rience, but even more disturbed by the fact that my paralyzing fear had disappe ared so fast and so com pletely. I com mented on my abrup t change of mood . Don Juan said that there was not hing strange about my v olatile change , and that fear did not exist as soon as the glow of awareness move d beyond a certain threshol d inside man’s cocoon. He then began his expl anation. He briefly out lined the truths about awareness he had discussed: that there is no obj ective wo rld, but onl y a uni verse of"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118 energy fields which seers call the Eagle’s emanations . That hum an beings are made of the Eagle’s emanations and are in essence bubbl es of lum inescent energy; each of us is wrappe d in a cocoon that encloses a small por tion of th ese emanations . That awareness is achieved by the cons tant pressure that the emanations out side our cocoons , which are called emanations at large, exert on thos e inside our cocoons . That awareness gives rise to perception, which happe ns when the emanations inside our cocoons align themselves with the correspondi ng emanations at large. “The next truth is that perception takes place,” he went on, “because there is in each of us an agent called the assemblage poi nt that selects internal and external emanations for align ment. The particular alignm ent that we perceive as the world is the produc t of the specific spot where our assemblage poi nt is located on our cocoon. ” He repeated this several times, allow ing me time to grasp it. Then he said that in order to cor robor ate the truths about awareness, I needed energy. “I’ve mentioned to you, ” he cont inue d, “that dealing with petty tyrants helps seers accom plish a sophi sticated maneuve r: that maneuve r is to move their assemblage poi nts.” He said that for me to have pe rceived an ally meant that I had move d my assemblage poi nt away from its custom ary pos ition. In other words, my glow of awareness had move d beyond a certain threshol d, also erasing my fear. And all this had happe ned because I had enough surplus energy. Lat er that nigh t, after we had returned from a trip into the surroundi ng mount ains, which had been part of his teachings for the righ t side, don Juan had me shift again into height ened awareness and then cont inue d his expl anation. He told"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 119 me that in order to discuss the nature of the assemblage poi nt, he had to start with a discussion of the first attention. He said that the new seers looke d into the unnot iced ways in which the first attention func tions , and as they tried to explain them to others, they devise d an order for the truths about awareness. He assured me that not every seer is given to expl aining. For instance, his benefactor, the nagua l Julian, coul d not have cared less about expl anations . But the nagua l Julian’s benefactor, the nagua l Elias, whom d on Juan was fortuna te enough to meet, did care. Between the nagua l Elias’s detailed, lengt hy expl anations , the nagua l Julian’s scanty one s, and his ow n persona l seeing, don Juan came to unde rstand and to corrobor ate thos e truths. Don Juan expl ained that in order for ou r first attention to bring into focus the world that we perceive, it has to empha size certain emanations selected from the narrow band of emanations where man’s awareness is located. The discarded emanations are still within our reach but rema in dor mant, unknow n to us for the dur ation of our lives. The new seers call the empha sized emanations the right side, nor mal awareness, the tona l, this world, the know n, the first attention. The average man calls it reality, rationa lity, com mon sense. The empha sized emanations com pos e a large por tion of man’s band of awareness, but a very small piece of the total spectrum of emanations present inside the cocoon of man. The disregarded emanations within man’s band are thought of as a sort of preamble to the unkn ow n, the unknow n prope r cons isting of the bul k of emanations which are not part of the hum an band and which are never empha sized. Seers call them the leftside awareness, the nagua l, the other world, the unknow n, the second attention."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 120 “This process of e mpha sizing certain emanations ,” don Juan went on, “was discove red and practiced by the old seers. They realized that a nagua l man or a nagua l wom an, by the fact that they have extra strengt h, can pus h the empha sis away from the usual emanations and make it shift to neighbo ring one s. That pus h is know n as the nagua l’s blow .” Don Juan said that the shift was utilized by the old seers in practical ways to keep their appr entices in bonda ge. With that blow they made their appr entices enter into a state of heigh tened, keenest, most impressiona ble awareness; while they were helplessly pliable, the old seers taught them aberrant techni que s that made the appr entices into sinister men, just like their teachers. The new seers employ the same techni que , but instead of using it for sordid pur pos es, they use it to gui de their appr entices to learn about man’s pos sibilities. Don Juan expl ained that the nagua l’s blow has to be delivered on a precise spot , on the assemblage poi nt, which varies minut ely from person to person. Also, the blow has to be delivered by a nagua l who sees. He assured me that it is equa lly useless to have the strengt h of a nagua l and not see, as it is to see and not have the strengt h of a nagua l, in either case the results are just blow s. A seer coul d s trike on the precise spot ove r and ove r without the strengt h to move awareness. and a nons eeing nagua l woul d not be able to strike the precise spot . He also said that the old seers discove red that the assemblage poi nt is not in the phys ical body, but in th e lum inous shell, in the cocoon itself. The nagua l identifies that spot by its intense lum inos ity and pus hes it, rather than striking it. The force of the pus h creates a dent in the cocoon and it is felt like a blow to the right shoul der blade, a blow that knoc ks all the air out of the lungs . “Are there different type s of dents?” I asked."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 “There are onl y two type s,” he responde d. “One is a conc avity and the other is a crevice; each has a distinct effect. The conc avity is a tempor ary feature and produc es a t empor ary shift?but the crevice is a profound and permanent feature of the cocoon and produc es a permanent shift.” He expl ained that usually a lum inous cocoon hardened by selfreflection is not affected at all by the nagua l’s blow . Som etimes, how ever, the co coon of man is very pliable and the smallest force creates a bow llike dent rangi ng in size from a small depression to one that is a third the size of the total cocoon; or it creates a crevice that may run across the width of the eggl ike shell, or along its lengt h, making the cocoon look as if it has curled in on itself. Som e lum inous shells, after being dented, go back to their original shape instantly. Others remain dented for hour s or even days at a time, but they revert back by themselves. Still others g et a firm, impervious dent that requi res anot her blow from the nagua l on a bor dering area to restore the original shape of the lum inous cocoon. And a few never lose their inde ntation onc e they get it. No matter how many blow s they get from a nagua l they ne ver revert back to their eggl ike shapes. Don Juan further said that the dent acts on the first attention byd isplacing the glow of awareness. The dent presses the emanations inside the lum inous shell, and the seers witness how the first attention shifts its empha sis unde r the force of that pressure. The dent, by displacing the Eagle’s emanations inside the cocoon, makes the glow of awareness fall on other emanations from areas that are ordinarily inaccessible to the first attention. I asked him if the glow o f awareness is seen onl y on the surface of the lum inous cocoon. He did not answer me right away. He seemed to immerse himself in thoug ht. After perhaps ten minut es he answered my que stion; he said"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 122 that nor mally the glow of awareness is seen on the surface of the cocoon of all sentient beings . After man develops attention, how ever, the glow of awareness acqui res depth. In other words, it is transmitted from the surface of the cocoon to qui te a num ber of emanations inside the cocoon. “The old seers kne w what they were doi ng when they handl ed awareness,” he went on. “They realized that by creating a dent in the cocoon of man, they coul d force the glow of awareness, since it is already glow ing on the emanations inside the cocoon, to spread to other neighbor ing o nes.” ‘You make it all sound as if it’s a phys ical affair,” I said. “How can dents be made in som ething that is just aglow ?” “In som e inexpl icable way, it is a matter of a glow that creates a dent in anot her glow ,” he replied. “Your flaw is to remain glue d to the inve ntory of reason. Reason doe sn’t deal with man as energy. Reason deals with instrum ents that create energy, but it has never serious ly occurred to reason that we are better than instrum ents: we are organisms that create energy. We are a bubbl e of energy. It isn’t farfetched, then, that a bubbl e of energy woul d make a dent in anot her bubbl e of energy. ” He said that the glow of awareness created by the dent shoul d right fully be called tempor ary heightened attention, because it empha sizes emanation s that are so proxi mal to the habitual one s that the change is minimal, yet the shift produc es a greater capacity to unde rstand and to conc entrate and, above all, a greater capacity to forget. Seers kne w exactly how to use this ups hift in the scale of qua l ity. They saw that onl y the emanations surroundi ng thos e we use daily sudde nly becom e bright after the nagua l’s blow . The more distant one s remain unm ove d, which meant to them that while being in a state of height ened attention, hum an beings coul d work as if they were in the world of everyda y life. The need of a nagua l man"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 and a nagua l wom an became paramount to them, because that state lasts onl y for as long as the depression remains, after which the expe riences are immediately forgo tten. “Why doe s one have to forget?” I asked. “Because the emanations that account for greater clarity cease to be empha sized onc e warriors are out of height ened awareness,” he replied. “Without that empha sis whatever they expe rience or witness vanishes.” Don Juan said that one o f the tasks the new seers had devised for their stude nts was to force them to remember, that is, to reempha size by themselves, at a later time, thos e emanations used dur ing states of height ened awareness. He reminde d me that Genaro was always recom mendi ng to me that I learn to write with the tip of my finge r instead of a pencil so as not to accum ulate not es. Don Juan said that what Genaro had actually meant was that while I was in states of height ened awareness I shoul d utilize som e unus ed emanations for st orage of dialogue and expe rience, and som eday recall it all by reempha sizing the emanations that were used. He went on to expl ain that a state of height ened awareness is seen not onl y as a glow that goe s deeper inside the eggl ike shape of hum an beings , but also as a more intense glow on the surface of the cocoon. Yet it is not hing in com parison to the glow produc ed by a state of total awareness, which is seen as a bur st of incande scence in the entire lum inous egg. It is an expl osion of light of such a magni tude that the bounda ries of the shell are diffused and the inside emanations extend themselves beyond anyt hing imaginable. “Are thos e special cases, don Juan?”"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 “Certainly.

And in full awareness they fuse themselves to the emanations at large, and glide into eternity .” After a few days in Sonor a I drove don Juan back to the tow n in the sout hern part of Mexico where he and his party of warriors lived. The next day was hot and hazy. I felt lazy and som ehow annoye d. In midafternoon, there was a most unpl easant qui etude in that tow n.

I kne w then that I was like a buoy floating in space and that the wave was goi ng to ove rtake me and carry me. I accepted it as una voi dable. But just before it hit me som ething thor oughl y une xpe cted happe ned?a wind blew me out of the wave’s path. The force of that win d carried me with tremendous speed. I went through an immense tunne l of intense colored light s. My vision blurred com pletely and then I felt that I was waking up, that I had been having a dream, a hypnot ic dream brought abou t by Genaro, in the next instant I was back in the room with don Juan and Genaro. I slept most of the follow ing day. In the late afternoon, don Juan and I again sat dow n to talk. Genaro had been with me earlier but had refused to com ment on my expe rience. “Genaro again pus hed your assem blage poi nt last night ,” don Juan said. “But perhaps the shove was too forceful.”"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 I eagerly told don Juan the cont ent of my vision. He smiled, obvi ous ly bor ed. “Your assemblage poi nt move d away from its nor mal pos ition, ” he said. “And that made you perceiv e emanations that are not ordinarily perceived. Sounds like not hing, doe sn’t it? And yet it is a supr eme accom plishm ent that the new seers strive to elucidate.” He expl ained that hum an beings repeatedly choos e the same emanations for perceiving because of two reasons . First, and most impor tant, because we have been taught that thos e emanations are perceivable, and second because our assemblage poi nts select and prepare thos e emanations for being used. “Every living being has an assemblage poi nt,” he went on , “which selects emanations for empha sis. Seers can see whether sentient beings share the same view of the world, by seeing if the emanations their assemblage poi nts have selected are the same.” He affirmed that one of the most impor tant breakthroughs for the new seers was to find that the spot where that poi nt is located on the cocoon of all living creatures is not a permanent feature, but is established on that specific spot by habit. Hence the tremendous stress the new seers put on new actions , on new p racticalities. They want desperately to arrive at new usages, new habits. “The nagua l’s blow is of great impo rtance,” he went on, “because it makes that poi nt move . It alters its location. Som etimes it even creates a permanent crevice there. The assemblage poi nt is totally dislodge d, and awareness change s dramatically. But what is a matter of even greater impo rtance is the prope r unde rstandi ng of the truths about awareness in order to realize that that poi nt can"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 129 be move d from within. The unf ortuna te truth i s that hum an beings always lose by default. They simply don ’t know about their pos sibilities.” “How can one accom plish that change from within?” I asked. “The new seers say that realization is the techni que ,” he said. “They say that, first of all, one must becom e aware that the world we perceive is the result of our assemblage poi nts’ being located on a specific spot on the cocoon. Once that is unde rstood, the assemblage poi nt can move almost at will, as a cons eque nce of new habits.” I did not qui te unde rst and what he meant by habits. I asked him to clarify his poi nt. “The assemblage poi nt of man appe ars around a definite area of the cocoon, because the Eagle com mands it,” he said. “But the precise spot is determined by habit, by repetitious acts. First we l earn that it can be placed there and then we our selves com mand it to be there. Our com mand becom es the Eagle’s com mand and that poi nt is fixated at that spot . Cons ider this very carefully; ou r com mand becom es the Eagle’s com mand. The old seers paid dearly for that finding. We’ll com e back to that later on. ” He stated onc e again that the old seers had conc entrated exclusively on developi ng thous ands of the most com plex techni que s of sorcery. He adde d that what they never realized was that their intricate dev ices, as bizarre as they were, had no other value than being the means to break the fixation of their assemblage poi nts and make them move . I asked him to expl ain what he had said. “I’ve mentioned to you that sorcery is som ething like entering a deadend st reet,” he replied. “What I meant was that sorcery practices have no intrinsic"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 value. Their worth is indi rect, for their real func tion is to make the assemblage poi nt shift by making the first attention release its cont rol on that poi nt. “The new seers real ized the true role thos e sorcery practices played and decided to go directly into the process of making their assemblage poi nts shift, avoi ding all the other nons ense of rituals and incantations . Yet rituals and incantations are inde ed necessary at one tim e in every warrior’s life. I persona lly have initiated you in all kinds of sorcery procedur es, but onl y for pur pos es of luring you r first attention away from the pow er of selfabsorption, which keeps your assemblage poi nt rigidly fixed.” He adde d that the o bsessive entangl ement of the first attention in selfabsorption or reason is a pow erful bindi ng force, and that ritual behavior, because it is repetitive, forces the first attention to free som e energy from watching the inve ntory, as a cons eque nce of which the assemblage poi nt loses its rigidity. “What happe ns to the persons whos e assemblage poi nts lose rigidity?” I asked. “If they’re not warriors, they think they’re losing their minds ,” he said, smiling. “Just as you thought you were goi ng crazy at one time . If they’re warriors, they know they’ve gone crazy, but they patiently wait. You see, to be healthy and sane means that the assemblage poi nt is immova ble. When it shifts, it literally means that one is derange d.” He said that two opt ions are ope ned to wa rriors whos e assemblage poi nts have shifted. One is to acknow ledge being ill and to behave in derange d ways, reacting emotionally to the strange worlds that their shifts force them to witness; the other is to remain impassive, unt ouc hed, know ing that the a ssemblage poi nt always returns to its original pos ition."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 “What if the assemblage poi nt doe sn’t return to its original pos ition? ” I asked. “Then thos e peopl e are lost,” he said. “They are either incurably crazy, because their assemblage poi nts coul d never a ssemble the world as we know it, or they are peerless seers who have begun their move ment tow ard the unknow n.” “What determines whether it is one or the other?” “Energy ! Impeccability! Impeccable warriors don’ t lose their marbles. They remain unt ouc hed. I’ ve said to you many times that impeccable warriors may see hor rifying worlds and yet the next mom ent they are telling a joke , laughi ng with their friends or with strange rs.” I said to him then what I had told him many times before, that what made me think I was ill was a series of disrupt ive sensorial expe riences that I had had as aftereffects of inge sting hallucinoge nic plants. I went through states of total space and time discordance, very annoyi ng lapses of mental conc entration, actual visions or halluci nations of places and peopl e I woul d be staring at as if they really existed. I coul d not help thinki ng that I was losing my mind. “By all ordinary measures, you were inde ed losing your mind, ” he said, “but in the seers’ view, if you had lost it, you woul d n’t have lost much. The mind, for a seer, is not hing but the selfreflection of the inve ntory of man. If you lose that selfreflection, but don’ t lose your unde rpinnings , you actually live an infinitely stronge r life than if you had kept it.” He remarked tha t my flaw was my emotion al reaction, which prevented me from realizing that the oddi ty of my sensorial expe riences was determined by the depth to which my assemblage poi nt had move d into man’s band of emanations ."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 I told him that I coul dn ’t unde rstand what he was expl aining because the conf igu ration that he had called man’s band of emanations was som ething incom prehensible to me. I had pictured it to be like a ribbon placed on the surface of a ball. He said that calling it a band was misleading, and that he was goi ng to use an analogy to illustrate what he meant. He expl ained that the lum ino us shape of man is like a ball of jack cheese with a thick disk of darker cheese injected into it. He looke d at me and chuc kled. He kne w that I did not like cheese. He mad e a diagram on a small blackboa rd. He drew an eggl ike shape and divided it in fou r longi tudi nal sections , saying that he woul d immediately erase the division lines because he had drawn them onl y to give me an idea where the band was located in the cocoon o f man. He then drew a thick band at the line between the first and second sections and erased the division lines. He expl ained that the band was like a disk of chedda r cheese that had been inserted into the ball of jack cheese. “Now if that ball of jack ch eese were transparent,” he went on, “you woul d have the perfect replica of man’s cocoon. The chedda r cheese goe s all the way inside the ball of jack cheese. It’s a disk that goe s from the surface on one side to the surface on the other side. “The assemblag e poi nt of man is located high up, threefour ths of the way tow ard the top of the egg on the surface of the cocoon. When a nagua l presses on that poi nt of intense lum inos ity, the poi nt move s into the disk of the chedda r cheese. Height ened awareness com es ab out when the intense glow of the assemblage poi nt light s up dor mant emanations way inside the disk of chedda r cheese. To see the glow of the assemblage poi nt movi ng inside that disk gives the feeling that it is shifting tow ard the left on the surface of th e cocoon. ”"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 He repeated his analogy three or four times, but I did not unde rstand it and he had to expl ain it further. He said that the transparency of the lum inous egg creates the impression of a move ment tow ard the left, when in fact every move ment of th e assemblage poi nt is in depth, into the center of the lum inous egg along the thickne ss of man’s band. I remarked that what he was saying made it sound as if seers woul d be using their eyes when they see the assemblage point move . “Man is not the unknow abl e,” he said. “Man’s lum inos ity can be seen almost as if one were using the eyes alone .” He further expl ained that the old seers had seen the move ment of the assemblage poi nt but it never occurred to them that it was a move ment in depth; instead they follow ed their seeing and coined the phr ase “shift to the left,” which the new seers retained although they kne w that it was errone ous to call it a shift to the left. He also said that in the cour se of my activity with him he had made my assemblage poi nt move co unt less times, as was the case at that very mom ent. Since the shift of the assemblage poi nt was always in depth, I had never lost my sense of identity, in spite of the fact that I was always using emanations I had never used before. “When the nagua l pus hes that poi nt,” he went on, “the poi nt ends up any which way along man’s band, but it absolutely doe sn’t matter where, because wherever it ends up is always virgin ground . “The grand test that the new seers develope d for their warriorappr entices is to retrac e the jour ney that their assemblage poi nts took unde r the influence of the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 nagua l. This retracing, when it is com pleted, is called regaining the totality of one self.” He went on to say that the cont ention of the new seers is that in the cour se of our grow t h, onc e the glow of awareness focuses on man’s band of emanations and selects som e of them for empha sis, it enters into a vicious circle. The more it empha sizes certain emanations , the more stable the assemblage poi nt gets to be. This is equi valent to sayi ng that our com mand becom es the Eagle’s com mand. It goe s without saying that when our awareness develops into first attention the com mand is so strong that to break that circle and make the assemblage poi nt shift is a genui ne trium ph. Don Juan said that th e assemblage poi nt is also respons ible for making the first attention perceive in terms of clusters. An example of a cluster of emanations that receive empha sis toge ther is the hum an body as we perceive it. Anot her part of our total being, our lum inous coc oon, never receives empha sis and is relegated to obl ivion ; for the effect of the assemblage poi nt is not onl y to make us perceive clusters of emanations , but also to make us disregard emanations. When I pressed hard for an expl anation of clustering he repl ied that the assemblage poi nt radiates a glow that groups toge ther bundl es of encased emanations . These bundl es then becom e aligne d, as bundl es, with the emanations at large. Clustering is carried out even when seers deal with the emanations that are neve r used. Whenever they are empha sized, we perceive them just as we perceive the clusters of the first attention. “One of the greatest mom ents the new seers had,” he cont inue d, “was when they found out that the unkno wn is merely the emanations discarded by t he first attention, it’s a huge affair, but an affair, mind you, where clustering can be done ."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135 The unknow able, on the other hand, is an eternity where our assemblage poi nt has no way of clustering anyt hing.” He expl ained that the assemblage poi nt is like a lum inous magne t that picks emanations and groups them toge ther wherever it move s within the bounds of man’s band of emanations . This discove ry was the glory of the new seers, for it put the unknow n in a new light . The new seers not iced that som e of the ob sessive visions of seers, the one s that were almost impos sible to conc eive, coincided with a shift of the assemblage poi nt to the region of man’s band which is diametrically oppos ed to where it is ordinarily located. “Thos e were visions of the dark side of man,” he asserted. “Why do you call it the dark side of man?” I asked. “Because it is som ber and forebodi ng, ” he said. “It’s not onl y the unknow n, but the whoc arestoknow it.” “How about the emanations that are inside the cocoon but out of the bounds of ma n’s band? ” I asked. “Can they be perceived?” “Yes, but in really inde scribable ways,” he said. “They’re not the hum an unknow n, as is the case with the unus ed emanations in the band of man, but the nearly immeasurable unknow n where hum an traits do not fig ure at all. It is really an area of such an ove rpow ering vastness that the best of seers woul d be hard put to describe it.” I insisted onc e more that it seemed to me that the mystery is obvi ous ly within us. “The mystery is out side us,” he said, “Inside us we have onl y emanations trying to break the cocoon.

Not so much what we perceive, but what makes us perceive. “I’ve mentioned to you that the new seers believe that our senses are capable of detecting anyt hing. They believe this because they see that the pos i tion of the assemblage poi nt is what dictates what our senses perceive. “If the assemblage poi nt aligns emanations inside the cocoon in a pos ition different from its nor mal one the hum an senses perceive in inconc eivable ways.”"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137 8 The Position of the Assem blage Point The next time don Juan resum ed his expl anation of the mastery of awareness we were again in his hous e in sout hern Mexico.

Don Juan, Genaro, and I had returned to the hous e from a trip to the mount ains. That day, as we relaxed after t he long drive and ate a late lunc h, I asked don Juan the reason for the curious deception. He assured me that no deception was invol ved, and that to call it Silvio Manue l’s hous e was an exercise in the art of stalking to be performed by all the members of the nagua l’s party unde r any circum stances, even in the privacy of their ow n thought s. For any of them to insist on thinki ng about the hous e in any other terms was tantamount to denyi ng their links to the nagua l’s party. I protested that he had never told me that. I did not want to cause any dissension with my habits. “Don’ t worry about it,” he said, smiling at me and patting my back. “You can call this hous e whatever you want. The nagua l has author ity. The nagua l wom an, for instance, calls it the hous e of shadow s.” Our conve rsation was interrupt ed, and I did not see him unt il he sent for me to com e to the back patio a coupl e of hour s later."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138 He and Genaro were strolling around at the far end of the corrido r; I coul d see them movi ng their hands in what seemed to be an animated conve rsation. It was a clear sunny day. The midafternoo n sun shone directly on som e of the flow er pot s that hung from the eaves of the roof aroun d the corrido r and projected their shadow s on the nor th and east walls of the patio. The com bination of intense yellow sunl ight , the massive black shadow s of the pot s, and the love ly, delicate, bare shadow s of the frail flow ering plants that grew in them was stunni ng. Som eone with a keen eye for balance and order had prune d thos e plants to create such an exqui site effect. “The nagua l wom an has done that,” don Juan said as if reading my thought s. “She gazes at these shadow s in the afternoo ns.” The thought of her gazing at shadow s in the afternoons had a swift and devastating effect on me. The inten se yellow light of that hour , the qui etness of that tow n, and the affection that I felt for the nagua l wom an conj ured up for me in one instant all the solitude of the warriors’ endl ess path. Don Juan had defined the scope of that path when he said to me th at the new seers are the warriors of total freedom , that their onl y search is the ultimate liberation that com es when they attain total awareness.

Genaro know s several gaits of pow er. Watch him fixedly.” Genaro’s move ments were inde ed mesmeric. I found myself follow ing his gait, first with my eyes and then irresistibly with my feet. I imitated his gait. We walked onc e around the patio and stoppe d. While walking, I had not iced the extraordinary lucidity that each step brought to me.

I became enthralled with a feeling of urgency, of impendi ng action. I felt extraordinarily aggr essive, muscular, daring. At that mom ent I saw an enor mous span of flat land in front of me; right behind me I saw a forest. Huge trees were lined up as straight as a wall. The forest was dark and green; the plain was sunny and yellow . My breathing was deep and strange ly accelerated, but not in an abno rmal way. Yet it was the rhyt hm of my breathing that was forcing me to trot on the spot . I wanted to take off runni ng, or rather my body wanted to, but just as I was taking off som ething stoppe d me.

We stoppe d there. Don Juan and Genaro move d a few feet away from me. I was left facing the side of the hous e that was in dark shadow s. I looke d into an empty dark room .

If the shift is cons iderable, the results are called hallucinations .” I asked him to expl ain the act of walking the assemblage poi nt. He said that onc e warriors have attained inne r silence by stoppi ng their internal dialogue , the sound of the gait of pow er, more than the sight of it, is what traps their assemblage poi nts. The rhyt hm of muffled steps instantly catches the alignm ent force of the emanations inside the cocoon, which has been disconne cted by inne r silence. “That force hooks itself immediately to the edge s of the band, ” he went on. “On the right edge we find endl ess visions of phys ical activity, violence, killing, sensuality. On the left edge we find spirituality, religion, God. Genaro and I walked your assemblage poi nt to bot h edge s, so as to give you a com plete view of that hum an junk pile.” Don Juan restated, as if on second thought , that one of the most mysterious aspects of the seers’ know ledge is the incredible effects of inne r silence. He said that onc e inne r silence is attained, the bond s that tie the assemblage poi nt to the particular spot where it is placed begin to break and the assemblage poi nt is free to move . He said that the move ment ordinarily is tow ard the le ft, that such a directiona l preference is a natural reaction of most hum an beings , but that there are seers who can direct that move ment to pos itions below the custom ary spot where the poi nt is located. The new seers call that shift “the shift below .”"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 147 “See rs also suffer accidental shifts below ,” he went on. “The assemblage poi nt doe sn’t remain there long, and that’s fortunate, because that is the place of the beast. To go below is count er to our interest, although the easiest thing to do. ” Don Juan also sai d that among the many errors of judg ment the old seers had com mitted, one of the most grievo us was movi ng their assemblage poi nts to the immeasurable area below , which made them expe rts at adopt ing animal forms. They chos e different animals as their poi nt of reference and called thos e animals their nagua l. They believed that by movi ng their assemblage poi nts to specific spot s they woul d acqui re the characteristics of the animal of their choi ce, its strengt h or wisdom or cunni ng or agility or ferocity. Don J uan assured me that there are many dreadful examples of such practices even among the seers of our day. The relative facility with which the assemblage poi nt of man move s tow ard any low er pos ition pos es a great temptation to seers, especially to thos e whos e inclination leans tow ard that end. It is the dut y of a nagua l, therefore, to test his warriors. He told me then that he had put me to the test by movi ng my assemblage poi nt to a pos ition below , while I was unde r the influence of a pow er plant. He then gu ided my assemblage poi nt unt il I could isolate the crow s’ band of emanations , which resulted in my changi ng into a crow . I again asked don Juan the que stion I had asked him doz ens of times. I wanted to know whether I had phys ically turned into a crow or ha d merely thoug ht and felt like one . He expl ained that a shift of the assemblage poi nt to the area below always results in a total transformation. He adde d that if the assemblage poi nt move s beyond a crucial threshol d, the world vanishes; it ceases to be wh at it is to us at man’s level."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 He conc eded that my transformation was inde ed hor rifying by any standa rds. My reaction to that expe rience prove d to him that I had no leanings tow ard that direction. Had it not been that way, I woul d have had to employ enor mo us energy in order to fight off a tende ncy to remain in that area below , which som e seers find most com fortable. He further said that an unw itting dow nshift occurs periodi cally to every seer, but that such a dow nshift becom es less and less freque nt as thei r assemblage poi nts move farther tow ard the left. Every time it occurs, how ever, the pow er of a seer unde rgoi ng it diminishes cons iderably. It is a drawback that takes time and great effort to correct. “Thos e lapses make seers extremely morose and narrow mi nde d,” he cont inue d, “and in certain cases, extremely rationa l.” “How can seers avoi d thos e dow nshifts?” I asked. “It all depends on the warrior,” he said. “Some of them are naturally inclined to indul ge in their qui rks? your self, for instance. They are t he one s who are hard hit. For thos e like you, I recom mend a twentyfou rhour vigil of everything they do. Disciplined men or wom en are less prone to that kind of shift; for thos e I woul d recom mend a twentythreehou r vigil.” He looke d at me with shiny eyes and laugh ed. “Female seers have dow nshifts more often than males,” he said. “But they are also capable of bounc ing out of that pos ition with no effort at all. while males linge r dange rously in it.” He also said that wom en seers have an extraordinary capacity to make their assemblage poi nts hol d on to any pos ition in the area below . Men cannot . Men have sobr iety and pur pos e, but very little talent; that is the reason why a nagua l"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 149 must have eight wom en seers in his party. Wom en give the impul se to cross the imme asurable vastness of the unknow n. Together with that natural capacity, or as a cons eque nce of it, wom en have a most fierce intensity. They can, therefore, reproduc e an animal form with flare, ease, and a matchless ferocity. “If you think about scary things ,” he cont inue d, “about som ething unna mable lurking in the darkne ss, you’ re thinki ng, withou t know ing it, about a wom an seer hol ding a pos ition in the immeasurable area below . True hor ror lies right there. If you ever find an aberrant woman seer, run for t he hills!” I asked him whether other organisms were capable of shifting their assemblage poi nts. “Their poi nts can shift,” he said, “but the shift is not a vol unt ary thing with them.” “Is the assemblage poi nt of other organisms also trained to appe ar where it doe s?” I asked. “Every newbo rn organism is trained, one way or anot her,” he replied. “We may not unde rstand how their training is do ne?after all, we don’ t even unde rstand how it is done to us?but seers see that the newbor n are coaxed to do what their k ind doe s. That’s exactly what happe ns to hum an infants: seers see their assemblage poi nts shifting every which way and then they see how the presence of adul ts fastens each poi nt to one spot . The same happe ns to every other organism.” Don Juan seemed to re flect for a mom ent and then adde d that there was inde ed one uni que effect that man’s assemblage poi nt has. He poi nted to a tree out side."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 150 “When we, as serious adul t hum an beings , look at a tree,” he said, “our assemblage poi nts align an infinite num ber of e manations and achieve a miracle. Our assemblage poi nts make us perceive a cluster of emanations that we call tree.” He expl ained that the assemblage poi nt not onl y effects the alignm ent needed for perception, but also obl iterates the alignm ent of certain e manations in order to arrive at a greater refinement of perception, a skimming, a tricky hum an cons truct with no parallel. He said that the new seers had obs erved that onl y hum an beings were capable of further clustering the clusters of emanations . He used the Spanish word for skimming, desnate, to describe the act of collecting the most palatable cream off the top of a cont ainer of bo iled milk after it cool s. Likewise, in terms of perception, man’s assemblage poi nt takes som e part of the emanations already selected for alignm ent and makes a more palatable cons truct with it. “The skimmings of men,” don Juan cont inu ed, “are more real than what other creatures perceive. That is our pitfall. They are so real to us that we forget we have cons tructed them by com m andi ng our assemblage poi nts to appe ar where they do. We forget they are real to us onl y because it is our com mand to perceive them as real. We have the pow er to skim the top off the alignm ents, but we don’ t have the pow er to protect our selves from our ow n com mands . That has to be learned. To give our skimmings a free hand, as we do, is an error of judg ment for which we pay as dearly as the old seers paid for theirs.” "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 151 9 The Shift Below Don Juan and Genaro made their yearly trip to the nor thern part of M exico, to the Sonor an desert, to look for medicinal plants. One of the seers of the nagua l’s party, Vicente Medrano, the herbalist among them, used thos e plants to make medicines. I had joined don Juan and Genaro in Sonor a, at the last stage of their jour n ey, just in time to drive them sout h, back to their hom e. The day before we started on our drive, don Juan abrupt ly cont inue d his expl anation of the mastery of awareness. We were resting in the shade of som e tall bus hes in the foot hills of the mount ains. I t was late afternoon, almost dark. Each of us carried a large bur lap sack filled with plants. As soon as we had put them dow n, Genaro lay dow n on the ground and fell asleep, using his folded jacket as a pillow . Don Juan spoke to me in a low voi ce, as if he didn’ t want to wake up Genaro. He said that by now he had expl ained most of the truths about awareness, and that there was onl y one truth left to discuss. The last truth, he assured me, was the best of the old seers’ findi ngs , although they never kne w tha t themselves. Its tremendous value was onl y recogni zed, ages later, by the new seers. “I’ve expl ained to you that man has an assemblage poi nt,” he went on, “and that that assemblage poi nt aligns emanation s for perception. We’ve also discussed that that poi nt move s from its fixed pos ition. Now , the last truth is that onc e that assemblage poi nt move s beyond a certain limit, it can assemble worlds entirely different from the world we know .”"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 152 Still in a whisper, he said that certain geogr aphi cal areas not onl y help that precarious move ment of the assemblage poi nt, but also select specific directions for that move ment. For instance, the Sonor an desert helps the assemblage poi nt move dow nw ard from its custom ary pos ition, to the place of the beast. “That’s why ther e are true sorcerers in Son ora,” he cont inue d. “Especially sorceresses. You already know one , la Catalina. In the past, I have arrange d bout s between the two of you. I wanted to make your assemblage poi nt shift, and la Catalina, with her sorcery antics, jo lted it loos e.” Don Juan expl ained that the chilling expe riences I had had with la Catalina had been part of a prearrange d agreement between the two of them. “What woul d you think if we invi ted her to join us?” Genaro asked me in a loud voi ce, as he sat up . The abrupt ness of his que stion and the strange sound of his voi ce plunge d me into instant terror. Don Juan laughe d and shook me by the arms. He assured me that there was no need for alarm. He said that la Catalina was like a cous in or an aunt to us. She was part of our world, although she did not qui te follow our que sts. She was infinitely closer to the ancient seers. Genaro smiled and winke d at me. “I unde rstand that you’ ve got hot pants for her,” he said to me. “She herself conf essed to me that every ti me you have had a conf ront ation with her, the greater your fright , the hot ter you r pants.” Don Juan and Genaro laughe d to near hys teria."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 153 I had to adm it that som ehow I had always found la Catalina to be a very scary but at the same time an extremely appe ali ng wom an. What impressed me the most about her was her exudi ng energy. “She has so much energy saved,” don Juan com mented, “that you didn’ t have to be in height ened awareness for her to move your assemblage poi nt all the way to the depths of the left side. ” Don Juan said again that la Catalina was very closely related to us, because she belonge d to the nagua l Julian’s party. He expl ained that usually the nagua l and all the members of his party leave the world toge ther, but that there are instances when they leave either in smaller groups or one by one . The nagua l Julian and his party were an example of the latter. Althou gh he had left the world nearly forty years ago, la Catalina was still here. He reminde d me about som ething he mentione d to me before, that the nagua l Julian’s party cons isted of a group of three thor ou ghl y incons eque ntial men and eight supe rb wom en. Don Juan had always maintained that such a disparity was one of the reasons why the members of the nagua l Julian’s party left the world one by o ne. He said that la Catalina had been attached to one of the supe rb wom en seers of the nagua l Julian’s party, who taught her extraordinary maneuve rs to shift her assemblage poi nt to the area below . That seer was one of the last to leave the world. She live d to an extremely old age, and since bot h she and la Catalina were originally from Sono ra, they returned, in her adva nced years, to the desert and lived toge ther unt il the seer left the world. In the years they spent toge ther, la Catalina became her most d edicated helper and disciple, a disciple who was willing to learn the extravagant ways the old seers kne w to make the assemblage poi nt shift."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 154 I asked don Juan if la Catalina’s know ledge was inhe rently different from his ow n. “We are exactly the same,” he r eplied. “She’s more like Silvio Manue l or Genaro; she is really the female version of them, but , of cour se, being a wom an she’s infinitely more aggr essive and dange rous than bot h of them.” Genaro assented with a nod of his head. “Infinitely more,” he said and winke d again. “Is she attached to your party?” I asked don Juan. “I said that she’s like a cous in or an aunt to us,” he replied. “I meant she belongs to the older generation, althoug h she’s younge r than all of us. She is the last of that group. She is rarely in cont act with us. She doe sn’t qui te like us. We are too stiff for her, because she’s used to the nagua l Julian’s touc h. She prefers the high adve nture of the unkn ow n to the que st for freedo m.” “What is the difference between the two?” I asked don Juan. “In the last part of my expl anation of the truths about awareness,” he replied, “we are goi ng to discuss that difference slow ly and thor ough ly. What’s impor tant for you to know . at this mom ent, is that you’ re jealous ly gua rding weird secrets in your leftside awareness; that is why la Catalina and you like each other.” I insisted again that it was not that I liked her, it was rather that I adm ired her great strengt h.

Don Juan spoke and broke the silence. “There are very strange poi nts in com mon between the nagua l Julian and you, ” he said. “Genaro is just trying to figu re out if you’ re aware of it.” I asked bot h of them how on earth I woul d be aware of som ething so farfetched. “La Catalina thinks you are,” Genaro said. “She says so because she kne w the nagua l Julian better than any of us here.” I com mented that I coul dn ’t believe that sh e kne w the nagua l Julian, since he had left the world nearly forty years ago. “La Catalina is no spring chicken,” Genaro said. “She just looks young; that’s part of her know ledge . Just as it was part of the nagua l Julian’s know ledge . You’ ve seen her onl y when she looks young. If you see her when she looks old, she’ll scare the living daylight s out of you. ” “What la Catalina doe s,” don Juan interrupt ed, “can be expl ained onl y in terms of the three masteries: the mastery of awareness, the mastery of stalking , and the mastery of intent. “But toda y, we are goi ng to examine what she doe s onl y in light of the last truth about awareness: the truth that says that the assemblage poi nt can assemble worlds different from our ow n after it move s from its original pos iti on. ”"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 156 Don Juan signa led me to get up.

Finally, Genaro took me by the arm and bot h of us climbed tow ard the top of the hill. When we got there, I realized that don Juan had com e up right behind us. The three of us reached the top at the same time. Don Juan very calmly began to talk to Genaro. He asked him if he remembered the many time s the nagua l Julian was about to choke bot h of them to death, because they indul ged in their fears. Genaro turned to me and assured me that the nagua l Julian had been a ruthless teacher.

You have to have energy to sustain the pressure of alignm ents wh ich never take place unde r ordinary circum stances.” Genaro said that the nagua l Julian was an inspiring teacher. He always found ways to teach and at the same time entertain himself. One of his favor ite teaching devices was to catch them una wares onc e or t wice, in their nor mal awareness, and make their assemblage poi nts shift.

Then, everything came again into hum an focus all at onc e. La Catalina was hol ding my hand. W e were walking on the desert floor amon g the desert shrubs . I had the immediate and painful realization that the desert rocks and hard clum ps of dirt were hor ribly injurious to my bare feet. We came to a spot clear of vegetation. Don Juan and Genaro were t here. I sat dow n and put on my clothes. My expe rience with la Catalina delayed our trip back to the sout h of Mexico. It had unhi nge d me in som e inde scribable way. In my nor mal state of awareness, I became disassociated. It was as if I had lost a poi nt of reference. I had becom e desponde nt. I told don Juan that I had even lost my desire to live. We were sitting around in the ramada of do n Juan’s hous e. My car was loaded with sacks and we were ready to leave, but my feeling of despair got the best of me and I began to weep.

A result of having saved energy had been the disrupt ion of their cozy but utterly limiting and bo ring nest in the world of everyda y life. Their depression, the nagua l Julian told them, was not so much the sadne ss of having lost their nest, but the ann oya nce of having to look for new qua rters. “The new qua rters,” don Juan went on, “are not as cozy. But they are infinitely more room y. “Your eviction not ice came in the form of a great depression, a loss of the desire to live, just as it happe ned to us.

Don Juan and Genaro again entered into a state of great euphor ia. Ev ery one of their statements and remarks made them laugh hys terically. “It’s all very simple,” don Juan said. “Your new level of energy will create a new spot to hous e your assemblage poi nt. And the warriors’ dialogue you carry on with us every time we get toge ther will solidify that new pos ition. ” Genaro adopt ed a serious look and in a boom ing voi ce he asked me, “Did you shit toda y?” He urged me with a move ment of his head to answer. “Did you, did you? ” he demande d. “Let’s get goi ng with our warriors’ dialo gue .”"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 166 When their laught er had subs ided, Genaro said that I had to be aware of a drawback, the fact that from time to time the assemblage poi nt returns to its original pos ition.

To his utter amazement, one day he realized that he had change d. He was cons iderably more daring and had successfully dealt with a situation that woul d have ordinarily throw n him into c haos and fear. “I found myself making love ,” Genaro cont inue d, and he winke d at me. “Usually I was afraid to death of wom en.

That’s why men and wom en lose their minds so easily, especially thos e who se internal dialogue is repetitious, bor ing, and without any depth. “The new seers say that the more resilient hum an beings are thos e whos e internal dialog ue is more fluid and varied.” He said that the pos ition of the warrior’s assemblage poi nt is infinite ly stronge r, because as soon as the assemblage poi nt begins to move in the cocoon, it"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 167 creates a dimple in the lum inos ity, a dimple that hous es the assemblage poi nt from then on. “That’s the reason why we can’t say that warriors lose their minds ,” don Juan went on. “If they lose anyt hing, they lose their dimple.” Don Juan and Genaro found that statement so hilarious that they rolled on the floor laugh ing. I asked don Juan to expl ain my expe rience with la Catalina.

Don Juan’s expr ession when he said that, and Genaro’s expl osion of laught er, took me into sheer mirth. I la ughe d unt il I was nearly sick. Don Juan said that la Catalina’s skill was so extraordinary that she coul d do anyt hing she wanted in the realm of the beast. Her unpa ralleled display had been motivated by her affinity with me. The final result of all that, h e said, was that la Catalina pul led my assemblage poi nt with her. “What did you two do as worms?” Genaro asked and slappe d me on the back.

I believe she learned the worm bit from him. He used to do that to her.” Don Juan jum ped up and dow n, like a child who is trying to keep from wetting his pants. When he had regained a measure of calm, don Juan said that the nagua l Julian had a kna ck for creating and expl oiting the most bizarre situations . He also said that la Catalina h ad given me a supe rb example of the shift below . She had let me see her as the being whos e form she had adopt ed by movi ng her assemblage poi nt, and she had then helped me move mine to the same pos ition that gave her her mons trous appe arance. “The other tea cher that the nagua l Julian had,” don Juan went on, “taught him how to get to specific spot s in that immensity of the area below .

He took me to the big room . It was ea rly evening. The room was in darkne ss. I wanted to light the gasoline lanterns, but don Juan woul d not let me. He said that I had to let the sound of his voi ce move my assemblage poi nt so that it woul d glow on the emanations of total conc entration and tota l recall. He then told me that we were goi ng to talk about the great bands of emanations . He called it anot her key discove ry that the old seers made, but that, in their aberration, they relegated to obl ivion unt il it was rescued by the new seers. “The Eagl e’s emanations are always groupe d in clusters,” he went on. “The old seers called thos e clusters the great bands of emanations . They aren’t really bands , but the name stuck. “For instance, there is an immeasurable cluster that produc es organic beings . The emanations of that organic band have a sort of fluffiness. They are transparent and have a uni que light of their ow n, a peculiar energy. They are aware, they jum p. That’s the reason why all organic beings are filled with a peculiar cons um ing energy. The ot her bands are darker, less fluffy. Som e of them have no light at all, but a qua lity of opa que ness.” “Do you mean, don Juan, that all organic beings have the same kind of emanations inside their cocoons ?” I asked."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" 171 “No. I don’ t mean that. It isn’t really th at simple, although organic beings belong to the same great band. Think of it as an enor mous ly wide band of lum inous filaments, lum inous strings with no end. Organic beings are bubbl es that grow around a grou p of lum inous filaments. Imagine that in this ba nd of organic life som e bubbl es are formed arou nd the luminous filaments in the center of the band, others are formed close to the edge s; the band is wide enough to accom moda te every kind of organic being with room to spare. In such an arrange ment, bubbl es that are close to the edge s of the band miss altoge ther the emanations that are in the center of the band, which are shared onl y by bubbl es that are aligne d with the center. By the same token, bubbl es in the center miss the emanations from the edge s. “As you can unde rstand, organic beings share the emanations of one band; yet seers see that within that organic band beings are as different as they can be.” “Are there many of these great bands ?” I asked. “As many as infinity itself,” he replied. “Seers have found out , how ever, that in the earth there are onl y fortyeight such bands .” “What is the meaning of that, don Juan?” “For seers it means that there are fortyeight type s of organizations on the earth, fortyeight type s of clusters or structures. Organic lif e is one of them.” “Does that mean that there are fortyseven type s of inor ganic life?” “No, not at all. The old seers count ed seven bands that produc ed inor ganic bubbl es of awareness. In other words, there are forty bands that produc e bubbl es without aware ness; thos e are bands that generate onl y organization. “Think of the great bands as being like trees.

Se ven have sour fruit, but edible none theless, and one has the most juicy, luscious fruit there is.” He laughe d and said that in his analogy he had taken the poi nt of view of the Eagle, for whom the most delectable morsels are the organic bubbl es of awarenes s. “What makes thos e eight bands produc e awareness?” I asked. “The Eagle bestow s awareness through its emanations ,” he replied. His answer made me argue with him. I told him that to say that the Eagle bestow s awareness through its emanations is like what a religious man woul d say about God, that God bestow s life through love . It doe s not mean anyt hing. “The two statements are not made from the same poi nt of view,” he patiently said. “And yet I think they mean the same thing. The difference is that seers see how the Eagle bestow s awareness through its emanations and religious men don’ t see how God bestow s life through his love .” He said that the way the Eagle bestow s awareness is by means of three giant bundl es of emanations that run through eight great bands . These bundl es are qui te peculiar, because they make seers feel a hue. One bundl e gives the feeling of being beigepink, som ething like the glow of pink colored street lamps; anot her gives the feeling of being peach, like buf f neon lights; and the third bun dle gives the feeling of being amber, like clear hone y. “So, it is a matter of seeing a hue when seers see that the Eagle bestow s awareness through its emanations ,” he went on. “Religious men don’ t see God’ s love , but if they woul d see it, they woul d know that it is either pink, peach, or amber. “Man, for example, is attached to the amber bundl e, but so are other beings .”"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 173 I wanted to know which beings shared thos e emanations with man. “Details like that you will have to find out for your self through you r ow n seeing, ”’ he said. “There is no poi nt in my telling you which one s; you will onl y be making anot her inventory. Suffice it to say that findi ng that out for you rself will be one of the most exciting things you’ ll ever do. ” “Do the pink and peach bundl es al so show in man?” I asked. “Never. Thos e bundl es belong to other living beings ,” he replied. I was about to ask a que stion, but with a forceful move ment of his hand, he signa led me to stop. He then became immersed in thought . We were enve lope d in com plete s ilence for a long time. “I’ve told you that the glow of awareness in man has different colors.” he finally said. “What I didn’ t tell you then, because we hadn’ t got ten to that poi nt yet, was that they are not colors but casts of amber.” He said that the am ber bundl e of awareness has an infinitude of subt le variants, which always denot e differences in qua lity of awareness. Pink and palegreen amber are the most com mon casts. Blue amber is more unus ual, but pur e amber is by far the most rare. “What determines the particular casts of amber?” “Seers say that the amount of energy that one saves and stores determines the cast. Count less num bers of warriors have begun with an ordinary pink amber cast and have finished with the pur est of all ambers. Genaro and Silvio Manue l are examples of that.” “What forms of life belong to the pink and the peach bundl es of awareness?” I asked."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 174 “The three bundl es with all their casts crisscross the eight bands ,” he replied. “In the organic band, the pink bundl e belon gs mainly to pla nts, the peach band belongs to insects, and the amber band belongs to man and other animals. “The same situation is prevalent in the inor ganic bands . The three bundl es of awareness produc e specific kinds of inor ganic beings in each of the seven great bands .” I asked him to elabor ate on the kinds of inor ganic beings that existed. “That is anot her thing that you must see for your self,” he said. “The seven bands and what they produc e are inde ed inaccessible to hum an reason, but not to hum an seeing. ” I told him that I coul d not qui te grasp his expl anation of the great bands , because his description had forced me to imagine them as inde pende nt bundl es of strings , or even as flat bands , like conve yor belts. He expl ained that the great bands are neither flat nor ro und, but inde scribably clustered toge ther, like a pile of hay, which is held toge ther in midair by the force of the hand that pitched it. Thu s, there is no order to the emanations ; to say that there is a central part or that there are edge s is misleading, but necessary to unde rstandi ng. Cont inui ng, he expl ained that ino rganic beings produc ed by the seven other bands of awareness are characterized by having a cont ainer that has no motion; it is rather a formless receptacle with a low degree of lum inos ity. It doe s not look like the cocoon of organic beings . It lacks the tautness, the inflated qua lity that makes organic beings look like lum inous balls bur sting with energy."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 175 Don Juan said that the onl y similarity between inor ganic and organic beings is that all o f them have the awarenessbestowing pink or peach or amber emanations . “Thos e emanations , unde r certain circum stances,” he cont inue d, “make pos sible the most fascinating com muni cation between the beings of thos e eight great bands .” He said that usually the organic beings , with their greater fields of energy, are the initiators of com muni cation with inorganic beings , but a subt le and sophi sticated follow up is always the provi nce of the inor ganic beings . Once the barrier is broke n, ino rganic beings change and becom e what seers call allies. From that mom ent ino rganic beings can anticipate the seer’s most subt le thought s or moods or fears. “The old seers became mesmerized by such devot ion from their allies,” he went on. “Stories are that the old seers coul d make their allies do anyt hing they wanted. That was one of the reasons they believed in their ow n invul nerability. They got foo led by their self - impor tance. The allies have pow er onl y if the seer who sees them is the paragon of impeccability; and thos e old seer s just weren’t.” “Are there as many inor ganic beings as there are living organisms?” I asked. He said that inor ganic beings are not as plentiful as organic one s, but that this is offset by the greater num ber of band s of inor ganic awareness. Also, the diffe rences among the inor ganic beings themselves are more vast than the differences among organisms, because organisms belong to onl y one band while inor ganic beings belong to seven bands ."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 176 “Besides, inor ganic beings live infinitely longe r than organisms,” he c ont inue d. “This matter is what prom pted the old seers to conc entrate their seeing on the allies, for reasons I will tell you about later on. ” He said that the old seers also came to realize that it is the high energy of organisms and the subs eque nt high de velop ment of their awareness that make them delectable morsels for the Eagle. In the old seers’ view, gluttony was the reason the Eagle produc ed as many organisms as pos sible. He expl ained next that the produc t of the other forty great bands is not awarene ss at all, but a conf igur ation of inanimate energy. The old seers chos e to call whatever is produc ed by thos e bands , vessels. While cocoons and cont ainers are fields of energetic awareness, which account s for their inde pende nt lum inos ity, vessels are rigid receptacles that hol d emanations without being fields of energetic awareness. Their lum inosity com es onl y from the energy of the encased emanations . “You must bear in mind that everything on the earth is encased,” he cont inue d. “Whatever we perceive is m ade up of por tions of cocoons or vessels with emanations . Ordinarily, we don’ t perceive the cont ainers of inor ganic beings at all.” He looke d at me, waiting for a sign of com prehension. When he realized I was not goi ng to obl ige him, he cont inue d expl ainin g. “The total world is made of the fortyeight bands ,” he said. “The world that our assemblage poi nt assembles for our nor mal perception is made up of two bands ; one is the organic band, the other is a band that has onl y structure, but no awareness. The oth er fortysix great bands are not part of the world we nor mally perceive.”"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 177 He paused again for pertinent que stions . I had none . “There are other com plete worlds that our assemblage poi nts can assemble,” he went on. “The old seers count ed seven such worlds, o ne for each band of awareness. I’ll add that two of thos e worlds, besides the world of everyda y life, are easy to assemble; the other five are som ething else.” When we again sat dow n to talk, don Juan immediately began to talk about my expe rience with la Catalina. He said that a shift of the assemblage poi nt to the area below its custom ary pos ition allow s the seer a detailed and narrow view of the world we know . So detailed is that view that it seems to be an entirely different world. It is a mesmerizing v iew that has a tremendous appe al, especially for thos e seers who have an adve nturous but som eho w indol ent and lazy spirit. “The change of perspective is very pleasant,” don Juan went on. “Minimal effort is requi red, and the results are stagge ring. If a see r is driven by qui ck gain, there is no better maneuve r than the shift below . The onl y probl em is that in thos e pos itions of the assemblage poi nt, seers are plague d by death, which happe ns even more brutally and more qui ckly than in man’s pos ition. “The nag ual Julian thought it was a great place for cavor ting, but that’s all.” He said that a true change of worlds happe ns onl y when the assemblage poi nt move s into man’s band, deep enough to reach a crucial threshol d, at which stage the assemblage poi nt can use anot her of the great bands . “How doe s it use it?” I asked. He shrugge d his shoul ders. “It’s a matter of energy, ” he said. “The force of alignm ent hooks anot her band, provi ded that the seer has enough energy. Our nor mal energy allow s our assemblage poi nts to use the force of alignm ent of one"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 178 great band of emanations . And we perceive the world we know . But if we have a surplus of energy, we can use the force of alignm ent of other great bands , and cons eque ntly we perceive other worlds.” Don Juan abrupt ly cha nge d the subj ect and began to talk about plants. “This may seem like an oddi ty to you, ” he said, “but trees, for instance, are closer to man than ants. I’ve told you that trees and man can develop a great relations hip; that’s so because they share emanati ons .” “How big are their cocoons ?” I asked. “The cocoon of a giant tree is not much larger than the tree itself. The interesting part is that som e tiny plants have a cocoon almost as big as a man’s body and three times its width. Thos e are pow er plants. T hey share the largest amount of emanations with man, not the emanations of awareness, but other emanations in general. “Anot her thing uni que about plants is that their lum inosities have different casts. They are pinki sh in general, because their awareness is pink. Poisonous plants are a pale yellow pink and medicinal plants are a bright violet pink. The onl y one s that are white pink are pow er plants; som e are murky white, others are brilliant white. “But the real difference between plants and other organic beings is the location of their assemblage poi nts. Plants have it on the low er part of their cocoon, while other organic beings have it on the uppe r part of their cocoon. ” “What about the inor ganic beings ?” I asked. “Where do they have their assemblage poi nts?”"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" 179 “Som e have it on the low er part of their containers,” he said. “Thos e are thor oug hly alien to man, but akin to plants.

They believed that the low er the assemblage poi nt, the easier for plants to break the barrier of perception; very large trees and very small plants have thei r assemblage poi nts extremely low in their cocoon. Because of this, a great num ber of the old seers’ sorcery techni que s were means to harness the awareness of trees and small plants in order to use them as gui des to descend to what they called the deepest levels of the dark regions . “You unde rstand, of cour se,” don Juan went on, “that when they thought they were descendi ng to the depths, they were, in fact, pus hing their assemblage poi nts to assemble other perceivable worlds with thos e seven great bands . “T hey taxed their awareness to the limit and assembled worlds with five great bands that are accessible to seers onl y if they unde rgo a dange rous transformation. ” “But did the old seers succeed in assembling thos e worlds?” I asked. “They did,” he said. “In t heir aberration they believed it was worth their while to break all the barriers of perception , even if they had to becom e trees to do that.” "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 180 11 Stalking, Intent an d the Dream ing Position The next day, in the early evening again, don Juan came to the r oom where I was talking with Genaro. He took me by the arm and walked me through the hous e to the back patio. It was already fairly dark. We started to walk around in the corrido r that encircled the patio. As we walked, don Juan told me that he wanted to warn me onc e again that it is very easy in the path of know ledge to get lost in intricacies and morbidity. He said that seers are up against great enemies that can destroy their pur pos e, muddl e their aims, and make them weak; enemies created by the warrior s’ path itself toge ther with the sense of indol ence, laziness, and self - impor tance that are integral parts of the daily world. He remarked that the mistakes the ancient seers made as a result of indol ence, laziness, and self - impor tance were so enor mous and so grave that the new seers had no opt ion but to scorn and reject their ow n tradition. “The most impo rtant thing the new seers needed,” don Juan cont inue d, “was practical steps in order to make their assemblage poi nts shift. Since they had none , they bega n by developi ng a keen interest in seeing the glow of awareness, and as a result they worked out three sets of techni que s that became their cornerstone .” Don Juan said that with these three sets, the new seers accom plished a most extraordinary and difficul t feat. They succeeded in systematically making the assemblage poi nt shift away from its customary pos ition. He acknow ledge d that"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" 181 the old seers had also accom plished that feat, but by means of capricious , idiosync ratic maneuve rs. He expl ained that what the new seers saw in the glow of awareness resulted in the seque nce in which they arrange d the old seers’ truths about awareness. This is know n as the mastery of awareness. From that, they develope d the three sets of techni que s. The first is the mastery of s talking, the second is the mastery of intent, and the third is the mastery of dreaming. He maintained that he had taught me these three sets from the very first day we met. He told me that he had taught me the mastery of awareness in two ways, just as the new seers recom mend. In his teachings for the right side, which he had done in nor mal awareness, he accom plished two goa ls: he taught me the warriors’ way, and he loos ened my assemblage poi nt from its original pos ition. In his teachings for the left side, which he had done in height ened awareness, he also accom plished two goa ls: he had made my assemblage poi nt shift to as many pos itions as I was capable of sustaining, and he had given me a long series of expl anations . Don Juan stoppe d talking and stared at me fixedly. There was an awkw ard silence; then he started to talk about stalking. He said that it had very hum ble and fortuitous origins. It started from an obs ervation the new seers made that when warriors steadily behave in ways not customary for them, the unus ed emanations inside their cocoons begin to glow . And their assemblage poi nts shift in a mild, harmoni ous , barely not iceable fashion. Stimulated by this obs ervation, the new seers began to practice the systematic cont rol of their behavior. They c alled this practice the art of stalking. Don Juan remarked that the name, although obj ectiona ble, was appr opr iate, because stalking entailed a specific kind of behavior with peopl e, behavior that coul d be categor ized as surreptitious ."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 182 The new seers, armed with this techni que , tackled the know n in a sobe r and fruitful way. By cont inua l practice, they made their assemblage poi nts move steadily. “Stalking is one of the two greatest accom plishm ents of the new seers.” he said. “The new seers decided that it shou ld be taught to a mode rnda y nagua l when his assemblage poi nt has move d qui te deep into the left side. The reason for this decision is that a nagua l must learn the principles of stalking without the encum brance of the hum an inve ntory. After all, the nagua l is the leader of a group, and to lead them he has to act qui ckly without first having to think about it. “Other warriors can learn stalking in their normal awareness, although it is advi sable that they do it in height ened awareness?not so much because of t he value of height ened awareness, but because it imbue s stalking with a mystery that it doe sn’t really have; stalking is merely behavior with peopl e.” He said that I coul d now unde rstand that shifting the assemblage poi nt was the reason why the new seers p laced such a high value on the interaction with petty tyrants. Petty tyrants forced seers to use the principles of stalking and, in doi ng so, helped seers to move their assemblage poi nts. I asked him if the old seers kne w anyt hing at all about the principl es of stalking. ‘”Stalking belongs exclusively to the new seers,” he said, smiling. “They are the onl y seers who had to deal with peopl e. The old one s were so wrappe d up in their sense of pow er that they didn’ t even know that peopl e existed, unt il peopl e s tarted clobbe ring them on the head. But you already know all this.” Don Juan said next that the mastery of intent toge ther with the mastery of stalking are the new seers’ two masterpieces, which mark the arrival of the"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 183 mode rnda y seers. He expl ained that in their efforts to gain an adva ntage ove r their oppr essors the new seers pur sued every pos sibility. They kne w that <heir predecessors had accom plished extraordinary feats by manipul ating a mysterious and miraculous force, which they coul d onl y describe as p ow er. The new seers had very little information about that force, so they were obl iged to examine it systematically throu gh seeing. Their efforts were amply rewarded when they discove red that the energy of align ment is that force. They began by seeing how the glow of awareness increases in size and intensity as the emanations inside the cocoon are aligne d with the emanations at large. They used that obs ervation as a springboa rd, just as they had done with stalking, and went on to develop a com plex series o f techni que s to handl e that alignm ent of emanations . At first they referred to thos e techni que s as the mastery of alignm ent. Then they realized that what was invol ved was much more than alignm ent; what was invol ved was the energy that com es out of the alig nm ent of emanations. They called that energy will. Will became the second basis. The new seers unde rstood it as a blind, impersona l, ceaseless bur st of energy that makes us behave in the ways we do. Will account s for our perception of the world of ordinary affairs, and indi rectly, through the force of that perception, it account s for the placement of the assemblage poi nt in its custom ary pos ition. Don Juan said that the new seers examined how the perception of the world of everyda y life takes place and saw the effects of will. They saw that alignm ent is ceaselessly renewed in order to imbue perception with cont inuity. To renew alignm ent every time with the freshne ss that it needs to make up a living world, the"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 184 bur st of energy that com es out of thos e very ali gnm ents is autom atically rerout ed to reinforce som e choi ce alignm ents. This new obs ervation served the new seers as anot her springboa rd that helped them reach the third basis of the set. They called it intent, and they described it as the pur pos eful gui din g of will, the energy of alignm ent. “Silvio Manue l, Genaro, and Vicente were pus hed by the nagua l Julian to learn thos e three aspects of the seers’ know ledge ,” he went on. “Genaro is the master of handl ing awareness, Vicente is the master of stalking, and Silvio Manue l is the master of intent. “We are now doi ng a final expl anation of the mastery of awareness; this is why Genaro is helping you. ” Don Juan talked to the female appr entices for a long time. The wom en listened with serious expr essions on their f aces. I felt sure he was giving them detailed instructions about difficult procedu res, judgi ng from the wom en’s fierce conc entration. I had been barred from their meeting, but I had watched them as they talked in the front room of Genaro’s hous e. I sat at the kitchen table, waiting unt il they were through. Then the wom en got up to leave, but before they did, they came to the kitchen with don Juan. He sat dow n facing me while the wom en talked to me with awkw ard formality. They actually embraced me. All of th em were unus ually friendl y, even talkative. They said that they were goi ng to join the male appr entices, who had gone with Genaro hour s earlier. Genaro was goi ng to show all of them his dreaming body."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 185 As soon as the wom en left, don Juan qui te abrupt ly resu med his expl anation. He said that as time passed and the new seers established their practices, they realized that unde r the prevailing condi tion s of life, stalking onl y move d the assemblage poi nts minimally. For maximum effect, stalking needed an ideal s etting; it needed petty tyrants in pos itions of great author ity and pow er. It became increasingl y difficult for the new seers to place themselves in such situations ; the task of improvi sing them or seeking them out became an unbe arable bur den. The new seer s deemed it imperative to see the Eagle’s emanations in order to find a more suitable way to move the assemblage poi nt. As they tried to see the emanations they were faced with a very serious probl em. They found out that there is no way to see them without runni ng a mortal risk, and yet they had to see them. That was the time when they used the old seers’ techni que of dreaming as a shield to protect themselves from the deadly blow of the Eagle’s emanations . And in doi ng so, they realized that dreaming was i n itself the most effective way to move the assemblage poi nt. “One of the strictest com mands of the new seers,” don Juan cont inue d, “was that warriors have to learn dreaming while they are in their nor mal state of awareness. Follow ing that com mand, I began teaching you dreaming almost from the first day we met.” “Why do the new seers com mand that dreaming has to be taught in nor mal awareness?” I asked. “Because dreaming is so dange rous and dreamers so vul nerable,” he said. “It is dange rous because it has in conc eivable pow er; it makes dreamers vul nerable because it leaves them at the mercy of the incom prehensible force of align ment."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 186 “The new seers realized that in our nor mal state of awareness, we have count less defenses that can safegua rd us against the forc e of unus ed emanations that sudde nly becom e aligne d in dreaming.” Don Juan expl ained that dreaming, like stalking, began with a simple obs ervation. The old seers became aware that in dreams the assemblage poi nt shifts slight ly to the left side in a most na tural manne r. That poi nt inde ed relaxes when man sleeps and all kinds of unus ed emanations begin to glow . The old seers became immediately intrigue d with that obs ervation and began to work with that natural shift unt il they were able to cont rol it. They ca lled that cont rol dreaming, or the art of handl ing the dreaming body. He remarked that there is hardly a way of describing the immensity of their know ledge about dreaming. Very little of it, how ever, was of any use to the new seers. So when the time of re cons truction came, the new seers took for themselves onl y the bare essentials of dreaming to aid them in seeing the Eagle’s emanations and to help them move their assemblage poi nts. He said that seers, old and new, unde rstand dreaming as being the cont rol of the natural shift that the assemblage poi nt unde rgoe s in sleep. He stressed that to cont rol that shift doe s not mean in any way to direct it, but to keep the assemblage poi nt fixed at the pos ition where it naturally move s in sleep, a most difficult mane uve r that took the old seers enor mous effort and conc entration to accom plish. Don Juan expl ained that dreamers have to strike a very subt le balance, for dreams cannot be interfered with, nor can they be com mande d by the cons cious effort of the dreamer, and yet the shift of the assemblage poi nt must obe y the dreamer’s com mand? a cont radiction that cannot be rationa lized but must be resolved in practice."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 187 After obs erving dreamers while they slept, the old seers hit upon the solution of letting dreams follow the ir natural cour se. They had seen that in som e dreams, the assemblage poi nt of the dreamer woul d drift cons iderably deeper into the left side than in other dreams. This obs ervation pos ed to them the que stion of whether the cont ent of the dream makes the ass emblage poi nt move , or the move ment of the assemblage poi nt by itself produc es the cont ent of the dream by activating unus ed emanations . They soon realized that the shifting of the assemblage poi nt into the left side is what produc es dreams. The farther t he move ment, the more vivid and bizarre the dream. Inevitably, they attempted to command their dreams, aiming to make their assemblage poi nts move deeply into the left side. Upon trying it, they discove red that when dreams are cons cious ly or semicons cious l y manipul ated, the assemblage poi nt immediately returns to its usual place. Since what they wanted was for that poi nt to move , they reached the una voi dable conc lusion that interfering with dreams was interfering with the natural shift of the assemblage poi nt. Don Juan said that from there the old seers went on to develop their astoundi ng know ledge on the subj ect ?a know ledge which had a tremendous bearing on what the new seers aspired to do with dreaming, but was of little use to them in its original form. He told me that thus far I had unde rstood dreaming as being the cont rol of dreams, and that every one of the exercises he had given me to perform, such as findi ng my hands in my dreams, was not , although it migh t seem to be, aimed at teaching me to com mand my dreams. Thos e exercises were designe d to keep my assemblage poi nt fixed at the place where it had move d in my sleep. It is here that the dreamers have to strike a subt le balance.

Seers are like fishermen equi ppe d with a line that casts itself wherever it may; the onl y thing they can do is keep the line anchor ed at the place where it sinks . “Wherever the assemblage poi nt move s in dreams is called the dreaming pos ition, ”’ he went on. “The old seers became so expe rt at keeping their dreaming pos ition that they were even able to wake up while their assemblage poi nts were anchor ed there. “The old seers called that state the dreaming body, because they cont rolled it to the extreme of creating a te mpor ary new body every time they woke up at a new dreaming pos ition. “I have to make it clear to you that dreaming has a terrible drawback,” he went on. “It belongs to the old seers. It’s tainted with their moo d. I’ve been very careful in gui ding you throu gh it, but still there is no way to make sure.” “What are you warning me about , don Juan?” I asked. “I’m warning you about the pitfalls of dreaming, which are truly stupe ndous ,” he replied. “In dreaming, there is really no way of directing the move ment of the assemblage poi nt; the onl y thing that dictates that shift is the inne r strengt h or weakne ss of dreamers. Right there we have the first pitfall.” He said that at first the new seers were hesitant to use dreaming. It was their belief that dreaming, inste ad of fortifying, made warriors weak, com pul sive, capricious . The old seers were all like that. In order to offset the nefarious effect of dreaming, since they had no other opt ion but to use it, the new seers develope d a com plex and rich system of behavior called the warriors’ way, or the warriors’ path."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 189 With that system, the new seers fortified themselves and acqui red the internal strengt h they needed to gui de the shift of the assemblage poi nt in dreams. Don Juan stressed that the strengt h that he was talk ing about was not convi ction alone . No one coul d have had stronge r con victions than the old seers, and yet they were weak to the core. Internal strengt h meant a sense of equa nimity, almost of indi fference, a feeling of being at ease, but , above all, it mea nt a natural and profound bent for examination, for unde rstandi ng. The new seers called all these traits of character sobr iety. “The convi ction that the new seers have,” he cont inue d, “is that a life of impeccability by itself leads una voi dably to a sense of sobr iety, and this in turn leads to the move ment of the assemblage poi nt. “I’ve said that the new seers believed that the assemblage poi nt can be move d from within. They went one step further and maintained that impeccable men need no one to gui de them , that by themselves, through saving their energy, they can do everything that seers do. All they need is a minimal chance, just to be cogni zant of the pos sibilities that seers have unr aveled.” I told him that we were back in the same position we had been in in my nor mal state of awareness. I was still convi nced that impeccability or saving energy was som ething so vague that it coul d be interpreted by anyone in whatever whimsical way he wanted. I wanted to say more to bui ld my argum ent, but a strange feelin g ove rtook me. It was an actual phys ical sensation that I was rushing through som ething. And then I rebuf fed my ow n argum ent. I kne w without any doubt whatsoever that don Juan was right . All that is requi red is impeccability, energy, and that begins with a singl e act that has to be deliberate, precise, and sustained.

When I told don Juan what I had just realized, he laughe d with appa rent delight and exclaimed that this was inde ed a gods ent example of the strengt h that he was talking about . He expl ained that my assemblage po int had shifted, and that it had been move d by sobr iety to a pos ition that fostered unde rstand ing. It coul d have as well been move d by capricious ness to a pos ition that onl y enha nces self - impor tance, as had been the case many times before. “Let’s talk now about the dreaming body. ”’ he went on. “The old seers conc entrated all their efforts on expl oring and expl oiting the dreaming body. And they succeeded in using it as a more practical body, which is tantamount to saying they recreated themselves in increasi ngl y weird ways.” Don Juan maintained that it is com mon kno wledge among the new seers that flocks of the old sorcerers never came back after waking up at a dreaming pos ition of their liking. He said that chances are they all died in thos e inconc eivable wor lds, or they may still be alive toda y in who know s what kind of cont orted shape or manne r. He stoppe d and looke d at me and broke into a great laugh. “You’ re dyi ng to ask me what the old seers did with the dreaming body, aren’t you? ” he asked, and urged me with a move ment of his chin to ask the que stion. Don Juan stated that Genaro, being the indi sput able master of awareness, had show n me the dreaming body many times while I was in a state of nor mal awareness. The effect that Genaro was after with his demons trations was to make"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 191 my assemblage poi nt move , not from a pos ition of height ened awareness, but from its nor mal setting.

He repeated ove r and ove r that I was now in the perfect state of awareness to see and unde rstand what the dreaming bod y really is. Then he had me get up, and we walked through the front room to reach the door to the out side. As I was a bout to ope n the door , I not iced that som eone was lying on the pile of floo r mats that the appr entices used as beds. I thought that one of the appr entices must have returned to the hous e while don Juan and I were talking in the kitchen. I went up to him, a nd then I realized that it was Genaro. He was sound asleep, snor ing peacefully, lying face dow n. “Wake him up, ” don Juan said to me. “We’ve got to be goi ng. He must be dead tired.” I gently shook Genaro. He slow ly turned around, made the sounds of som eone waking up from a deep slum ber. He stretched his arms, and then he ope ned his eyes. I screamed invol unt arily and jum ped back. Genaro’s eyes were not hum an eyes at all. They were two poi nts of intense amber light . The jolt of my fright had been so intense th at I became dizzy. Don Juan tappe d my back and restored my equi librium. Genaro stood up and smiled at me. His features were rigid. He move d as if he were drunk or phys ically impaired. He walked by me and headed directly for the wall. I winced at the immine nt crash, but he went through the wall as if it were not there at all. He came back into the room through the kitchen do orway. And"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 192 then, as I looke d in true hor ror, Genaro walked on the walls, with his body parallel to the ground, and on the ceiling, with his head ups ide dow n. I fell backw ards as I tried to follow his mov ements. From that pos ition I didn’ t see Genaro anym ore; instead I was looki ng at a blob of light that move d on the ceiling above me and on the walls, circling the room . It was as if som eon e with a giant flashlight was shining the beam on the ceiling and the walls. The beam of light was finally turned off. It disappe ared from view by vanishing against a wall. Don Juan remarked that my animal fright was always out of measure, that I had to st ruggl e to bring it unde r cont rol, but that all in all, I had behaved very well. I had seen Genaro’s dreaming body as it really is, a blob of light . I asked him how he was so sure I had done that. He replied that he had seen my assemblage poi nt first move t ow ard its nor mal setting in order to com pensate for my fright , then move deeper into the left, beyond the poi nt where there are no doubt s. “At that pos ition there is onl y one thing on e can see: blobs of energy, ” he went on. “But from height ened awareness t o that other poi nt deeper into the left side, it is onl y a shor t hop. The real feat is to make the assemblage poi nt shift from its nor mal setting to the poi nt of no dou bt.” He adde d that we still had an appoi ntment with Genaro’s dreaming body in the fields around the hous e, while I was in nor mal awareness. When we were back in Silvio Manue l’s hous e, don Juan said that Genaro’s proficiency with the dreaming body was a very mino r affair com pared with what the old seers did with it. “You’ ll see that very soon ,” he said with an om inous tone , then laughe d."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 193 I que stione d him about it with mount ing fear, and that onl y evoke d more laught er. He finally stoppe d and said that he was goi ng to talk about the way the new seers got to the dreaming body and the way they use d it. “The old seers were after a perfect replica of the body, ” he cont inue d, “and they nearly succeeded in getting one . The onl y thing they never coul d copy was the eyes. Instead of eyes, the dreaming body has just the glow of awareness. You never realize d that before, when Genaro used to show you his dreaming body. “The new seers coul d not care less about a perfect replica of the body ; in fact, they are not even interested in copyi ng the body at all. But they have kept just the name dreaming body to mean a feeling, a surge of energy that is transpor ted by the move ment of the assemblage poi nt to any place in this world, or to any place in the seven worlds available to man.” Don Juan then out lined the procedur e for getting to the dreaming bo dy. He said that it starts with an initial act, which by the fact of being sustained breeds unbe ndi ng intent. Unbe ndi ng intent leads to internal silence, and internal silence to the inne r strengt h needed to make the assemblage poi nt shift in dreams to suitable pos itions . H e called this seque nce the groundw ork. The developm ent of cont rol com es after the groun dw ork has been com pleted; it cons ists of systematically maintaining the dreaming pos ition by dogge dly hol ding on to the vision of the dream. Steady practice results in a great facility to hol d new dreaming pos itions with new dreams, not so much because one gains deliberate cont rol with practice, but because every time this cont rol is exercised the inne r strength gets fortified. Fortified inne r strengt h in turn makes the a ssemblage poi nt shift into dreaming pos itions , which are more and more suitable to fostering sobr iety; in other words, dreams by themselves becom e more and more manageable, even orderly."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 194 “The developm ent of dreamers is indi rect,” he went on. “That’s why th e new seers believed we can do dreaming by our selves, alone . Since dreaming uses a natural, bui ltin shift of the assemblage poi nt, we shoul d need no one to help us. “What we badly need is sobr iety, and no one can give it to us or help us get it except our s elves. Without it, the shift of the assemblage poi nt is chaotic, as our ordinary dreams are chaotic. “So, all in all, the procedur e to get to the dreaming body is impeccability in our daily life.” Don Juan expl ained that onc e sobr iety is acqui red and the d reaming pos itions becom e increasingl y stron ger, the next step is to wake up at any dreaming pos ition. He remarked that the maneuve r, although made to sound simple, was really a very com plex affair?so com plex that it requi res not onl y sobr iety but all the a ttributes of warriorship as well, especially intent. I asked him how intent helps seers wake up at a dreaming pos ition. He replied that intent, being the most sophi sticated cont rol of the force of alignm ent, is what maintains, through the dreamer’s sobr iet y, the alignm ent of whatever emanations have been lit up by the move ment of the assemblage poi nt. Don Juan said that there is one more formidable pitfall of dreaming: the very strengt h of the dreaming body. For example, it is very easy for the dreaming bod y to gaze at the Eagle’s emanations uni nterruptedly for long periods of time, but it is also very easy in the end for the dreaming body to be totally cons um ed by them. Seers who gazed at the Eagle’s emanations without their dreaming bodi es died, and thos e who gazed at them with their dreaming bodi es bur ned with the fire from within. The new seers solved the probl em by seeing in teams. While one seer gazed at the emanations , others stood by ready to end the seeing."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 195 “How did the new seers see in teams?” I ask ed. “They dreamed toge ther, ‘” he replied. “As you your self know , it’s perfectly pos sible for a group of seers to activate the same unus ed emanations .

What happe ns is that our hum an condi tion makes us focus the glow of awareness autom atically on the same emanations that other hum an beings are using; we adjust the pos ition of our assemblage poi nts to fit the others around us. We do that on the right side, in our ordinary perception, and we also do it on the left side, while dreaming toge ther.

All the seers of don Juan’s party seemed to be so elated that they were actually absentminde d, a thing that I had never witnessed before. Their usual high level of energy appe ared to have increased. I became very app rehensive. I asked don Juan about it. He took me to the back patio. We walked in silence for a mom ent. He said that the time was getting closer for all of them to leave. He was pressing his expl anation in order to finish it in time. “How do you know that you are closer to leaving? ” I asked. “It is an internal know ledge ,” he said. “You’ll know it som eday your self. You see, the nagua l Julian made my assemblage poi nt shift count less times, just as I have made your s shift. Then he left me the task of realigni n g all thos e emanations which he had helped me align through these shifts. That is the task that every nagua l is left to do. “At any rate, the job of realigni ng all thos e emanations paves the way for the peculiar maneuve r of light ing up all the emanations i nside the cocoon.

Let your assemblage poi nt move first, then years later have the realization. ” We walked to the big room and sat d ow n to talk. Don Juan hesitated for a mom ent. He looke d out of the window . From my chair I coul d see the patio. It was early afternoo n; a cloudy day. It looke d like rain. Thunde rhead clouds were movi ng in from the west. I liked cloudy days. Don Juan did not . He seemed restless as he tried to find a more com fortable sitting pos ition. Don Juan began his elucidation by com menting that the difficulty in remembering what takes place in height ened awareness is due to the infinitude of pos itions that the assembl age poi nt can adopt after being loos ened from its nor mal setting. Facility in remembering everything that takes place in nor mal awareness, on the other hand, has to do with the fixity of the assemblage poi nt on one spot , the spot where it nor mally sets. He told me that he com miserated with me. He sugge sted that I accept the difficulty of recollecting and acknow ledge that I might fail in my task and never be able to realign all the emanations that he had helped me align. “Think of it this way,” he said, smil ing. “You may never be able to remember this very conve rsation that we are having now , which at this mom ent seems to you so com monpl ace, so taken for granted. “This inde ed is the mystery of awareness.

But don’ t apol ogi ze for either; bot h are needed. “One of the great maneuve rs of stalkers is to pit the mystery against the stupi dity in each of us.” He expl ained that stalking practices are not som ething one can rejoice in; in fact, they are dow nright obj ectiona ble. Kno wing this, the new seers realize that it woul d be against everybody’ s interest to discuss or practice the principles of stalking in nor mal awareness. I poi nted out to him an incong ruity. He had said that there is no way for warriors to act in the world while they are in height ened awareness, and he had also said that stalking is simply behaving with peopl e in specific ways. The two statements cont radicted each other. “By not teaching it in nor mal awareness I was referring onl y to teaching it to a nagua l ,” he said. “The pur pos e of stalking is twofold: first, to move the assemblage poi nt as steadily and safely as possible, and not hing can do the job as well as stalking: second, to imprint its principles at such a deep level that the hum an inve ntory is bypa ssed, as is the natural reaction of refusing and judgi ng som ething that may be offensive to reason. ” I told him that I sincerely doub ted I coul d judge or refuse anyt hing like that. He laughe d and said that I coul d not be an exception, that I woul d react li ke everyone else onc e I heard about the deeds of a master stalker, such as his benefactor, the nagua l Julian. “I am not exagge rating when I tell you that the nagua l Julian was the most extraordinary stalker I have ever met,” don Juan said. “You have alread y heard"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 199 about his stalking skills from everyb ody else. But I’ve never told you what he did to me.” I wanted to make it clear to him that I had not heard anyt hing about the nagua l Julian from anyone , but just before I voi ced my protest a strange feeling of unc ertainty swept ove r me. Don Juan seemed to know instantly what I was feeling. He chuc kled with delight . “You can’t remember, because will is not available to you yet,” he said. “You need a life of impeccability and a great surplus of energy, and then wi ll might release thos e memories. “I am goi ng to tell you the story of how the nagua l Julian behaved with me when I first met him. If you jud ge him and find his behavior obj ectiona ble while you are in height ened awareness, think of how revol ted you migh t be with him in nor mal awareness.” I protested that he was setting me up. He assured me that all he wanted to do with his story was to illustrate the manne r in which stalkers ope rate and the reasons why they do it. “The nagua l Julian was the last of the oldti me stalkers,” he went on. “He was a stalker not so much because of the circum stances of his life but because that was the bent of his character.” Don Juan expl ained that the new seers saw that there are two main groups of hum an beings : thos e who care about others and thos e who do not . In between these two extremes they saw an endl ess mixture of the two. The nagua l Julian belonge d to the categor y of men who do not care; do n Juan classified himself as belongi ng to the oppos ite categor y."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 200 “But didn’ t you tell m e that the nagua l Julian was generous , that he woul d give you the shirt off his back?” I asked. “He certainly was,” don Juan replied. “Not onl y was he generous ; he was also utterly charming, winni ng. He was always deeply and sincerely interested in everybo dy arou nd him. He was kind and open and gave away everything he had to anyone who needed it, or to anyone he happened to like. He was in turn love d by everyone , because being a master stalker, he conve yed to them his true feelings : he didn’ t give a plugge d nickel for any of them.” I did not say anyt hing, but don Juan was aware of my sense of disbelief or even distress at what he was saying. He chuckled and shook his head from side to side. “That’s stalking, ” he said. “You see, I haven’t even begun my story of the nagua l Julian and you are already annoye d.” He expl ode d into a giant laugh as I tried to expl ain what I was feeling. “The nagua l Julian didn’ t care about anyon e,” he cont inue d. “That’s why he coul d help peopl e. And he did; he gave them the shirt off his back, because he didn’ t give a fig about them.” “Do you mean, don Juan, that the onl y one s who help their fellow men are thos e who don’ t give a damn about them?” I asked, truly miffed. “That’s what stalkers say,” he said with a beaming smile. “The nag ual Julian, for instance, was a fabul ous curer. He helped thous ands and thous ands of peopl e, but he never took credit for it. He let peopl e believe that a wom an seer of his party was the curer."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" 201 “Now , if he had been a man who cared for his fellow men, he wo uld’ve demande d acknow ledgm ent.

I wou ldn ’t know what to do. And I woul d always have the naggi ng sense that I was impos ing my will on him with my gifts. “Naturally, I have ove rcom e all these feelings with the warriors’ way.

But that’s not the same.” Don Juan said that when he first became aware of the stalkers’ principles, as I was then doi ng, he wa s as distressed as he coul d be. The nagua l Elias, who was very much like don Juan, expl ained to him that stalkers like the nagua l Julian are natural leaders of peopl e.

There was a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Strange , isn’t it?” he asked. “The way stalkers arrange d what they see about peopl e?” Then don Juan started his story about the nagua l Julian. He said that the nagua l Julian spent many, many years waiting for an appr entice nagua l. He stum bled on don Juan one day while returning hom e after a shor t visit with acqua inta nces in a nearby village. He was, in fact, thinki ng about an appr entice nagua l as he walked on the road when he heard a loud guns hot and saw peopl e scrambling in every direction. He ran with them into the bus hes by the side of the road and onl y came out f rom his hiding place at the sight of a group of peopl e gathered around som eone woun ded, lying on the ground. The wounde d person was, of cour se, don Juan, who had been shot by the tyranni cal foreman. The nagua l Julian saw instantly that don Juan was a speci al man whos e cocoon was divided into four sections instead of two; he also realized that don Juan was badly wounde d. He kne w that he had no time to waste. His wish had been fulfilled, but he had to work fast, before anyone sensed what was goi ng on. He held his head and cried, “They’ve shot my son! ” He was traveling with one of the female seers of his party, a hus ky Indi an wom an, who always officiated publ icly as his mean shrewish wife. They were an excellent team of stalkers. He cued the woman seer, and she also started weeping and wailing for their son, who was unc ons cious and bleeding to death. The nagua l Julian begge d the onl ooke rs not to call the author ities but rather to help him move his son to his hous e in the city, which was som e distance away. He of fered mone y to som e strong young men if they woul d carry his wounde d, dyi ng son."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 203 The men carried don Juan to the nagua l Julian’s hous e. The nagua l was very generous with them and paid them hands omely. The men were so touc hed by the grieving coup le, who had cried all the way to the hous e, that they refused to take the mone y, but the nagua l Julian insisted that they take it to give his son luck. For a few days, don Juan did not know what to think about the kind coupl e who had taken him into their hom e. He sai d that to him, the nagua l Julian appe ared as an almost senile old man. He was not an Indi an, but was married to a young, irascible, fat Indi an wife, who was as phys ically strong as she was illtempered. Don Juan thought that she was definitely a curer, jud ging by the way she treated his wound and by the qua ntities of medicinal plants stashed away in the room where they had put him. The wom an also dom inated the old man and made him tend to don Juan’s wound every day. They had made a bed for don Juan out of a thick floor mat, and the old man had a terrible time kne eling do wn to reach him. Don Juan had to fight not to laugh at the com ical sight of the frail old man trying his best to bend his kne es. Don Juan said that while the old man washed his wound, he woul d mum ble incessantly; he had a vacant look in his eyes; his hands shook, and his body trembled from head to toe.

Once the old man spent half an hour cursing and"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 204 yelling, as he puf fed and crawled like a slug, before he dragge d himself to the door and painfully lifted himself up to a sta ndi ng pos ition. He expl ained to don Juan that his poor health was due to adva nced age, broke n bone s that had not mende d prope rly, and rheum atism. Don Juan said that the old man raised his eyes tow ard heaven and conf essed to don Juan that he was the most wr etched man on earth; he had com e to the curer for help and had ende d up marrying her and becom ing a slave. “I asked the old man why he didn’ t leave,” don Juan cont inue d. “The old man’s eyes widened with fear. He choke d on his ow n saliva trying to hus h me a nd then he went rigid and fell dow n like a log on the floor , next to my bed, trying to make me stop talking. ‘You don’ t know what you’ re saying; you don ’t know what you’ re saying.

I was convi nced that he was more miserable, more wretched than I had ever been myself. And with every day that passed I became more and more unc om fortable in that hous e. The food was great and the wom an wa s always out curing peopl e, so I was left with the old man. We talked a lot about my life. I liked to talk to him.

Sensing that don Juan was planni ng to run away, he seized the oppor tuni ty to scare him with an ally that was som ehow able to look like a mons trous man. “The sight of that ally nearly drove me insane,” don Juan cont inue d. “I coul dn’ t believe my eyes, and yet the mons ter was right in front o f me. And the frail old man was next to me whimpering and beggi ng the mons ter to spare his life. You see, my benefactor was like the old seers; he coul d dol e out his fear, a piece at a time, and the ally was reacting to it. I didn’ t know that. All I coul d see with my very ow n eyes was a hor rendous creature adva ncing on us, ready to tear us apart, limb from limb. “The mom ent the ally lurched ont o us, hissing like a serpent, I passed out cold. When I came to my senses again, the old man told me that he had ma de a deal with the creature.” He expl ained to don Juan that the man had agreed to let bot h of them live, provi ded don Juan enter the man’s service. Don Juan appr ehensively asked what was invol ved in the service. The old man replied that it woul d be slavery , but poi nted out that don Juan’s life had nearly ende d a few days back when he had been shot . Had not he and his wife com e along to stop the bleeding, don Juan woul d surely have died, so there was really very little to bargain with, or to bargain for. The mons trous man kne w that and had him ove r a barrel. The old man told don Juan to stop vacillating and accept the deal, because if he refused, the mons trous man, who was listening behind the door , woul d bur st in and kill them bot h on the spot and be done wi th it. “I had enough nerve to ask the frail old man, who was shaking like a leaf, how the man woul d kill us,” don Juan went on. “He said that the mons ter planne d"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 206 to break all the bone s in our bodi es, starting with our feet, as we screamed in uns peakable ag ony, and that it woul d take at least five days for us to die. “I accepted that man’s condi tions instantly.

We were goi ng to be more prisone rs than slaves o f the mons trous man, but we woul d eat at least twice a day; and since we had life, we coul d work for ou r freedom ; we coul d plot, conni ve, and fight our way out of that hell.” Don Juan smiled and then broke into laught er. He had know n beforehand how I woul d feel about the nagua l Julian. “I told you you’ d be ups et,” he said. “I really don’ t unde rstand, don Juan,” I said. “What was the poi nt of put ting on such an elabor ate masque rade?” “The poi nt is very simple,” he said, still smiling. “This is anot her meth od of teaching, a very good one . it requi res tremendous imagination and tremendous cont rol on the part of the teacher. My method of teaching is closer to what you cons ider teaching. It requi res a tremendous amount of words. I go to the extremes of talking . The nagua l Julian went to the extremes of stalking. ” Don Juan said that there were two methods of teaching among the seers. He was familiar with bot h of them. He preferred the one that called for expl aining everything and letting the other person kno w th e cour se of action beforehand. It was a system that fostered freedom , choi ce, and unde rstandi ng. His benefactor’s method, on the other hand, was more coercive and did not allow for choi ce or unde rstandi ng. Its great adva ntage was that it forced warriors to live the seers’ conc epts directly with no intermediary elucidation."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" 207 Don Juan expl ained that everything his benefactor did to him was a masterpiece of strategy. Every one of the nagua l Julian’s words and actions was deliberately selected to cause a particu lar effect. His art was to provi de his words and actions with the most suitable cont ext, so that they woul d have the necessary impact. “That’s the stalkers’ method, ” don Juan went on. “It fosters not unde rstandi ng bu t total realization. For instance, it t ook me a lifetime to unde rstand what he had done to me by making me face the ally, although I realized all that without any expl anation as I lived that expe rience. “I’ve told you that Genaro, for example, doe sn’t unde rstand what he doe s, but his realizatio n of what he is doi ng is as keen as it can be. That’s because his assemblage poi nt was move d by the stalkers’ method. ” He said that if the assemblage poi nt is forced out of its custom ary setting by the method of expl aining everything, as in my case, there is always the need for som eone else not onl y to help in the actual dislodgi ng of the assemblage poi nt, but in dispensing the expl anations of what is goi ng on. But if the assemblage poi nt is move d by the stalkers’ method, as in his own case, or Genaro’s, th ere is onl y a need for the initial catalytic act that yanks the poi nt from its location. Don Juan said that when the nagua l Julian made him face the mons trous looki ng ally his assemblage poi nt move d unde r the impact of fear. So intense a fright as that caus ed by the conf ront ation, coupl ed with his weak phys ical condi tion, was ideal for dislodgi ng his assemblage poi nt. In order to offset the injurious effects of fright , its impact had to be cushione d, but not minimized. Exp laining what was happe ning woul d hav e minimized fear.

The more elabor ate and dramatic his stories were, the greater their cushioni ng effect. If he, himself, seemed to be in the same boa t with don Juan, the frigh t woul d not be as intense as if don Juan were alone . “With his penchant for drama,” don Juan went on, “my benefactor was able to move my assemblage poi nt enough to imbue me right away with an ove rpow ering feeling for the two basic qua lities of warriors: sustained effort and unbe ndi ng intent. I kne w that in order to be free again som eday, I woul d h ave to work in an orderly and steady fashion and in coope ration with the frail old man, who in my opi nion needed my help as much as I needed his. I kne w beyond a shadow of a doubt that that was what I wanted to do more than anyt hing else in life.” I did n ot get to talk to don Juan again unt il two days later. We were in Oaxaca, strolling in the main squa re, in the early morning. There were children walking to school , peopl e goi ng to chur ch, a few men sitting on the benches, and taxi drivers waiting for tou r ists from the main hot el. “It goe s without saying that the most difficult thing in the warriors’ path is to make the assemblage poi nt move ,” don Juan said. “That move ment is the com pletion of the warriors’ que st. To go on from there is anot her que st; it is the seers’ que st prope r.” He repeated that in the warriors’ way, the shift of the assemblage poi nt is everything. The old seers absolutely failed to realize this truth. They though t the move ment of the poi nt was like a marker that determined their pos itio ns on a scale"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 209 of worth. They never conc eived that it was that very pos ition which determined what they perceived. “The stalkers’ method, ” don Juan went on, “in the hands of a master stalker like the nagua l Julian, account s for stupe ndous shifts of the asse mblage poi nt. These are very solid change s; you see, by buttressing the appr entice, the stalkerteacher gets the appr entice’s full coo peration and full participation. To get anybody’ s full coope ration and full participation is about the most impor tant out c om e of the stalkers’ metho d; and the nagua l Julian was the best at getting bot h of them.” Don Juan said that there was no way for him to describe the turmoil that he went through as he found out , little by little, about the richne ss and the com plexity of t he nagua l Julian’s persona lity and life. As long as don Juan faced a scared, frail old man who seemed helpless, he was fairly at ease, com fortable. But one day, soon after they had made the deal with what don Juan thought of as a mons trous looki ng man, his com fort was shot to pieces when the nagua l Julian gave don Juan anot her unne rving demons tration of his stalking skills. Although don Juan was qui te well by then, the nagua l Julian still slept in the same room with him in order to nur se him. When he woke up that day, he announc ed to don Juan that their captor was gone for a coupl e of days, which meant that he did not have to act like an old man. He conf ided to don Juan that he onl y pretende d to be old in order to fool the mons trous look ing man. Without giving don Juan time to think, he jum ped up from his mat with incredible agility; he bent ove r and dunke d his head in a pot of water and kept it there for a while. When he straight ened up, his hair was jet black, the gray hair had washed away, and don Juan was l ooki ng at a man he had never seen before, a man"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 210 perhaps in his late thirties. He flexed his muscles, breathed deeply, and stretched every part of his body as if he had been too long inside a cons tricting cage. “When I saw the nagua l Julian as a young man, I thought that he was inde ed the devil,” don Juan went on. “I closed my eyes and kne w that my end was near. The nagua l Julian laughe d unt il he was crying. ” Don Juan said that the nagua l Julian then put him at ease by making him shift back and forth betwee n the righ t side and the left side awareness. “For two days the young man pranced arou nd the hous e,” don Juan cont inue d. “He told me stories about his life and joke s that sent me reeling around the room with laugh ter. But what was even more astoundi ng was the way his wife had change d. She was actually thin and beautiful. I thoug ht she was a com pletely different wom an. I raved about how com plete her change was and how beautiful she looke d. The young man said that when their captor was away she was actually anot her wom an.” Don Juan laughe d and said that his devilish benefactor was telling the truth. The wom an was really anot her seer of the nagua l’s party. Don Juan asked the young man why they pretende d to be what they were not . The young man looke d at don Jua n, his eyes filled with tears, and said that the mysteries of the world are inde ed unf athom able. He and his young wife had been caught by inexpl icable forces and had to protect themselves with that pretense. The reason why he carried on the way he did, as a feeble old man, was that their captor was always peeking in through cracks in the door s. He begge d don Juan to forgive him for having fool ed him. Don Juan asked who that mons trous looki ng man was. With a deep sigh, the young man conf essed that he coul d no t even gue ss. He told don Juan that although"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 211 he himself was an educ ated man, a famous actor from the theater in Mexico City, he was at a loss for expl anations . All he kne w was that he had com e to be treated for the cons um ption that he had suffered from for many years. He was near death when his relatives brought him to meet the curer. She helped him to get well, and he fell madly in love with the beautiful you ng Indi an and married her. His plans were to take her to the capital so they coul d get rich with he r curing ability. Before they started on the trip to Mexico City, she warned him that they had to disgui se themselves in order to escape a sorcerer. She expl ained to him that her mother had also been a curer, and had been taught curing by that master sorce rer, who had demande d that she, the daught er, stay with him for life. The young man said that he had refused to ask his wife about that relations hip. He onl y wanted to free her, so he disgui sed himself as an old man and disgui sed her as a fat wom an. Their story did not end happi ly. The hor rible man caught them and kept them as prisone rs. They did not dare to take off their disgui se in front of that night marish man, and in his presence they carried on as if they hated each other; but in reality, they pined f or each other and lived onl y for the shor t times when that man was away. Don Juan said that the young man embraced him and told him that the room where don Juan was sleeping was the onl y safe place in the hous e. Woul d he please go out and be on the lockout while he made love to his wife? “The hous e shook with their passion, ” don Juan went on, “while I sat by the door feeling gu ilty for listening and scared to death that the man woul d com e back any minut e.

My embarrassment and my fear were so great that I passed out .” The story about the nagua l Julian’s doi ngs annoye d me no end. I told don Juan that I had failed to unde rstand the value of the nagua l Julian’s stalking skills. Don Juan listened to me without making a singl e com ment and let me ramble on and on. When we finally sat dow n on a bench, I was very tired. I did not know what to say when he asked me why his account of the nagua l Julian’s method of teaching had ups et me so much. “I can’t shake off the feeling that he was a pranks ter,” I finally said. “Pranks ters don’ t teach anyt hing deliberately with their pranks ,” don Juan retorted. “The nagua l Julian played dramas, magical dramas that requi red a move ment of the assemblage poi nt.” “He seems like a very selfish person to me,” I insisted. “He seems like that to you because you are judgi ng, ” he replied. “You are being a moralist. I went through all that myself. If you feel the way you do on hearing about the nagua l Julian, think of the way I must have felt myself living in his hous e for years. I judge d him, I feared him, and I envi ed him, in that order. “I also love d him, but my envy was greater than my love . I envi ed his ease, his mysterious capacity to be young or old at will; I envi ed his flair and above all his influence on whoe ver happe ned to be around. It woul d drive me up the walls to hear him enga ge peopl e in the most interesting conve rsation. He always had som ething to say; I never did, and I always felt incom petent, left out .” Don Juan’s revelation s made me feel ill at ease. I wished that he woul d change the subj ect, for I did not want to hear that he was like me. In my opi nion,"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" 213 he was inde ed une qua led. He obvi ous ly kne w how I felt. He laughe d and patted my back. “What I am trying to do with the st ory of my envy, ” he went on, “is to poi nt out to you som ething of great impor tance, that the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt dictates how we behave and how we feel. “My great flaw at that time was that I coul d not unde rstand this principle. I was raw. I l ived through self - importance, just as you do, because that was where my assemblage poi nt was lodge d. You see, I hadn’ t learned yet that the way to move that poi nt is to establish new habits, to will it to move . When it did move , it was as if I had just dis cove red that the onl y way to deal with peerless warriors like my benefactor is not to have self - importance, so that one can celebrate them unbi asedly.” He said that realizations are of two kinds . One is just pep talk, great out bur sts of emotion and not hing more. The other is the produc t of a shift of the assemblage poi nt; it is not coupl ed with an emotiona l out bur st but with action. The emotiona l realizations com e years later after warriors have solidified, by usage, the new pos ition of their assemblage poi nts. “The nagua l Julian tirelessly gui ded all of us to that kind of shift,” don Juan went on. “He got from all of us total coope ration and total participation in his bigge rthanlife dramas. For instance, with his drama of the young man and his wife and thei r captor he had my undi vided attention and conc ern. To me the story of the old man who was young was very cons istent.

His dramas include d magical characters sum mone d by the force of intent, like the inor ganic being that coul d adop t a grotesque hum an form. “The nagua l Julian’s pow er was so impeccable,” don Juan went on, “that he coul d force anyone ’s assemblage poi nt to shift and align emanations that woul d make him perceive whatever the nagua l Julian wanted. For example, he coul d loo k very old or very youn g for his age, dependi ng on what he wanted to accom plish. And all anyone who kne w the nagua l coul d say about his age was that it fluctuated. During the thirtytwo years that I kne w him he was at times not much older than you are now , and at other times he was so wretchedly old that he coul d not even walk.” Don Juan said that unde r his benefactor’s gui dance his assemblage poi nt move d unnot iceably and yet profoun dly. For instance, out of now here one day he realized that he had a fear tha t on the one hand made no sense to him at all, and on the other made all the sense in the world. “My fear was that through stupi dity I woul d lose my chance to be free and I woul d repeat my father’s life. “There was not hing wron g with my father’s life, mind you. He lived and died no better and no worse than most men; the impor tant poi nt is that my assemblage poi nt had move d and I realized one day that my father’s life and death hadn’ t amoun ted to a hill of beans, either to others or to himself. “My benefacto r told me that my father and mother had lived and died just to have me, and that their ow n parents had done the same for them.

Sit dow n here for an instant, free of thought s and desires; I will try to com e here from wherever I am and collect you.

The earth is a gigantic sentient being subj ected to the same forces we are.” He expl ained that the old seers, on discove ring this, became immediately interested in the practical uses of that know ledge . The result of their interest was that the most elabor ate categor ies of their sorcery had to do with the earth. They cons idere d the earth to be the ultimate sour ce of everything we are.

Just before we came into the squa re, don Juan said th at Genaro wanted to show me one more thing: that the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt is everything, and that the world it makes us perceive is so real that it doe s not leave room for anyt hing except realness. “Genaro will let his assemblage poi nt assemble anot her world just for you r benefit,” don Juan said to me. “And then you’ ll realize that as he perceives it, the force of his perception will leave room for not hing else.” Genaro walked ahead of us, and don Juan ordered me to roll my eyes in a count ercloc kw ise direction while I looke d at Genaro, to avoi d being dragge d with him.

The aspect of alignm ent that keeps the poi nt stationa ry, he said, is will ; and the aspect that makes it shift is intent. He remarked that one of the most haunt ing mysteries is how will, the impersona l force of align ment, change s into intent, the persona lized force, which is at the service of each indi vidua l. “The strange st part of this mystery is that the change is so easy to accom plish,” he went on. “But what is not so easy is to convi nce our selves that it is pos sible.

After a mom ent’s pause he adde d that for pur pos es of seeing the cocoon of man, one has to gaze at peopl e from behind, as they walk away. It is useless to gaze at peopl e face to face, because the front of t he eggl ike cocoon of man has a protective shield, which seers call the front plate, it is an almost impregna ble, unyi elding shield that protects us througho ut our lives against the ons laught of a peculiar force that stems from the emanations themselves.

It is a permanent move , which results in an unc om mon sense of aloof ness, or cont rol, or even abandon. That drift of the assemblage poi nt entails a new alignm ent of emanations . It is the beginni ng of a series of greater shifts. Seers very ap tly called this initial shift losing the hum an form, because it marks an inexor able move ment of the assemblage poi nt away from its original setting, resulting in the irreversible loss of our affiliation to the force that makes us persons . He asked me then to describe all the details I coul d remember about the balls of fire. I told him that I had seen them so briefly I was not sure I coul d describe them in detail. He poi nted out that seeing is a euphe mism for mov ing the assemblage poi nt, and that if I move d mine a fraction more to the left I woul d have a clear picture of the balls of fire, a picture which I coul d interpret then as having remembered them.

I asked him to clarify what he meant by all the details of life and death. “The rolling force is the means through which the Eagle distribut es life and awareness for safekeeping, ” he said. “ But it also is the force that, let’s say, collects the rent. It makes all living beings die. What you saw toda y was called by the ancient seers the tum bler.” He said that seers describe it as an eternal line of iridescent rings , or balls of fire, that roll ont o living beings ceaselessly. Lum inous organic beings meet the rolling force head on, unt il the day when the force prove s to be too much for them and the creatures finally collapse. The old seers were mesmerized by seeing how the tum bler then tumbles th em into the beak of the Eagle to be devour ed. That was the reason they called it the tum bler. “You said that it is a mesmerizing sight . Have you your self seen it rolling hum an beings ?” I asked. “Certainly I’ve seen it,” he replied, and after a pause he add ed, “You and I saw it onl y a shor t while ago in Mexico City.” His assertion was so farfetched that I felt obliged to tell him that this time he was wrong. He laughe d and reminde d me that on that occasion, while bot h of us were sitting on a bench in the Ala meda Park in Mexico City, we had witnessed the death of a man.

What I ende d up with was a com pos ite of filaments of the most gor geous colors supe rimpos ed on the bui ldings and the traffic. The filaments were actually lines of colored light that came from above . They had inne r life; they were bright and bur sting with energy.

The circles were rolling on peopl e, on don Juan, on me. I felt them in my stom ach and became ill. Don Juan told me to focus my eyes on the dyi ng man. I saw him at one mom ent curling up, just as a sow bug c urls itself up upon being touc hed. The incande scent circles pus hed him away, as if they were casting him aside, out of their majestic, inalterable path. I had not liked the feeling. The circles of fire had not scared me; they were not awesom e, or sinister. I did not feel morbid or som ber. The circles rather had nauseated me. I’d felt them in the pit of my stom ach. It was a revul sion that I’d felt that day. Remembering them conj ured up again the total feeling of discom fort I had expe rienced on that occasion .

The result is stagge ring in its cons eque nces.” He said that a shift of the assemblage poi nt is all that is needed to ope n one self to the rolling force. He adde d that if the force is seen in a deliberate manne r, there is minimal dange r. A situation that is extremely dange rous , how ever, is an invol unt ary shift of the assemblage poi nt ow ing, perhaps, to phys ical fatigue , emotiona l exha ustion, disease, or simply a minor emotiona l or phys ical crisis, such as being fright ened or being drunk. “When the assemblage poi nt shifts invol unt arily, the rolling force cracks the cocoon, ” he went on. “I’ve talked many times about a gap that man has below his navel. It’s not really below the navel itself, but in the cocoon, at the height of the navel. The gap is more like a dent, a natural flaw in the other wise smoot h cocoon. It is there where the tum bler hits us ceaselessly and where the cocoon cracks.” He went on to expl ain that if it is a minor shift of the assemblage poi nt, the crack is very small, the cocoon qui ckly repairs itself, and peopl e expe rience what everybody has at one time or anot her: blotches of color and cont orted shapes, which remain even if the eyes are closed.

As the tum bler hits us ove r and ove r, death com es to us through the gap. Death is the rolling force.

The gaps of other organic creatures are very much like man’s; som e are stronge r than our s and others are weaker. But the gap of inor ganic beings is really different.

He did not answer. He simply chuc kled, shrugge d his shoul ders, and went on to say that the old seers’ obs ession with the tum bler blinde d them to the other side of that force. The new seers, with their usual thor ou ghne ss in refusing tradition, went to the other extreme. They were at first totally averse to focusing their seeing on the tum bler; they argue d that they needed to unde rstand the force of the emanations at large in its aspect of lifegiver and enha ncer of awareness. “They realized that it is infinitely easier to destroy som ething, ” don Juan went on, “than it is to bui ld it and maintain it. To roll life away is not hing com pared to giving it and n our ishing it.

Don Juan said that these new seers realized, after they had readopt ed their tradition, that the old seers’ know ledge of the rolling force had been com plete; at one poi nt the old seers had conc lude d that there were, in effect, two different aspects of the same force. The tum bling aspect relates exclusively to destruction and death. The circular aspect, on the other hand, is what maintains life and awareness, fulfillment and pur pos e. They had chos en, how ever, to deal exclusively with the tum bling aspect. “Gazing in teams, the new seers were able to see the separation between the tum bling and the circular aspects,” he expl ained. “They saw that bot h forces are fused, but are not t he same. The circular force com es to us just before the tum bling force; they are so close to each other that they seem the same. “The reason it’s called the circular force is that it com es in rings , threadlike hoops of iridescence?a very delicate affair in deed. And just like the tum bling force, it strikes all living beings ceaselessly, but for a different pu rpos e. It strikes them to give them strengt h, direction, awareness; to give them life. “What the new seers discove red is that the balance of the two for ces in every living being is a very delicate one ,” he cont inue d, “if at any given time an indi vidua l feels that the tum bling force strikes harder than the circular one , that means the balance is ups et; the tum bling force strikes harder and harder from then on, unt il it cracks the living being’ s gap and makes it die.” He adde d that out of what I had called balls of fire com es an iridescent hoop exactly the size of living beings , whether men, trees, microbe s, or allies."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" 244 “Are there differentsize circles?” I as ked. “Don’ t take me so literally,” he protested. “There are no circles to speak of, just a circular force that gives seers, who are dreaming it, the feeling of rings . And there are no different sizes either. It’s one indi visible force that fits all living beings , organic and inor ganic.” “Why did the old seers focus on the tum bling aspect?” I asked. “Because they believed that their lives depende d on seeing it,” he replied. “They were sure that their seeing was goi ng to give them answers to ageold que stions . You see, they figur ed that if they unr aveled the secrets of the rolling force they woul d be invul nerable and immortal. The sad part is that in one way or anot her, they did unr avel the secrets and yet they were neither invul nerable nor immortal. “The new seers change d it all by realizing that there is no way to aspire to immortality as long as man has a cocoon. ” Don Juan expl ained that the old seers appa rently never realized that the hum an cocoon is a receptacle and cannot sustain the ons laught of the roll ing force forever. In spite of all the know ledge that they had accum ulated, they were in the end certainly no better, and perhaps much worse, off than the average man. “In what way were they left worse off than the average man?” I asked. “Their tremendous know ledge forced them to take it for granted that their choi ces were infallible,” he said. “So they chos e to live at any cost.” Don Juan looke d at me and smiled.

I tried to pul l my foot loos e. I felt then a sting, as if needles were piercing my skin. Don Juan insisted ove r and ove r that I sing. He and Genaro started to sing a popul ar song. Genaro spoke the lyrics as he looke d at me from hardly two inch es away. They sang offkey in raspy voi ces, getting so com pletely out of breath and so high out of the range of their voi ces that I ende d up laughi ng. “Sing, or you’ re goi ng to perish,” don Juan said to me. “Let’s make a trio,” Genaro said, “We’ll sing a bo lero.” I joined them in an offkey trio. We sang for qui te a while at the top of our voi ces, like drunka rds. I felt that the iron grip on my leg was gradua lly letting go of me. I had not dared to look dow n at my ankl e. At one mom ent I did and I realized the n that there was no trap clutching me. A dark, headlike shape was biting me! Only a supr eme effort kept me from fainting. I felt I was getting sick and autom atically tried to bend ove r, but som ebody with supe rhum an strength grabbe d me painlessly by the elb ow s and the nape of my neck and did not let me move . I got sick all ove r my clothes. My revul sion was so com plete that I began to fall in a faint. Don Juan sprinkl ed my face with som e water from the small gour d he always carried when we went into the mount ains. The water slid unde r my collar. The coldne ss restored my phys ical balance, but it did not affect the force that was hol ding me by my elbow s and neck. “I think you are goi ng too far with your fright,” don Juan said loudl y and in such a matteroffact t one that he created an immediate feeling of order."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" 257 “Let’s sing again,” he adde d. “Let’s sing a song with subs tance?I don’ t want any more bol eros.” I silently thanke d him for his sobr iety and for his grand style.

I do know how to die Valentina, Valentina. I throw my self in your way. If I am goi ng to die tom orrow, w hy not , onc e and for all, toda y?” All of my being stagge red unde r the impact of that inconc eivable juxt apos ition of values. Never had a song meant so much to me. As I heard them sing thos e lyrics, which I ordinarily cons idered reeking with cheap sentimen talism, I thought I unde rstood the ethos of the warrior. Don Juan had drilled into me that warriors live with death at their side, and from the know ledge that death is with them they draw the cour age to face anyt hing. Don Juan had said that the worst that coul d happe n to us is that we have to die, and since that is already our una lterable fate, we are free; thos e who have lost everything no longe r have anyt hing to fear."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 258 I walked to don Juan and Genaro and embraced them to expr ess my boundl ess gratitude and adm iration for them.

It’s all ove r your chest.” He looke d at me, and bot h of them began to laugh. “Don’ t sit too close to me,” Genaro said. “I don’ t appr eciate puke rs. But don’ t go too far, either. The old seers are not yet through with their tricks.” I move d as close to them as pol iteness permitted. I was conc erned about my slate for an instant, and then all my qua lms became nons ense, for I not iced that som e peopl e were com ing tow ard us. I coul d not make out their shapes clearly but I distingui shed a mass of hum an figur es moving in the semidarkne ss. They did not carry lanterns or flashlight s with them, which at that hour they woul d still have needed. Som ehow that detail worried me. I did not want to focus on it and I deli berately began to think rationa lly. I figu red that we must have attracted attention with ou r loud singi ng and they were com ing to inve stigate. Don Juan tappe d me on the shoul der. He poi nted with a move ment of his chin to the men in front of the group of ot hers. “Thos e four are the old seers,” he said. “The rest are their allies.” Before I coul d remark that they were just local peasants, I heard a swishing sound right behind me. I qui ckly turned around in a state of total alarm.

As I stood up, don Juan jum ped to my side, at the very same mom ent that a hor de of men, led by thos e don Juan had pointed out , descende d on me like vul tures. They were actually sque aking like bats or rats. I yelled in terror. This time I was able to let out a piercing cry. Don Juan, as nimbly as an athlete in top form, pul led me out of their clutches ont o the rock. He told me in a stern voi ce not to turn around to loo k, no matter how scared I was. He said tha t the allies cannot pus h at all, but that they certainly coul d scare me and make me fall to the ground. On the ground, how ever, the allies coul d hol d anybody dow n. If I were to fall on the ground by the place where the seers were bur ied, I woul d be at thei r mercy. They woul d rip me apart while their allies held me. He adde d that he had not told me all that before because he had hope d I woul d be forced to see and unde rstand it by myself. His decision had nearly cost me my life. The sensation that the grotes que men were just behind me was nearly unbe arable. Don Juan forcefully ordered me to keep calm and focus my attention on four men at the head of a crow d of perhaps ten or twelve. The instant I focused my eyes on them, as if on cue, they all adva nced to the edge of the flat rock. They stoppe d there and began hissing like serpents. They walked back and forth.

It was as if they were follow ing a repetit ive pattern, aimed at mesmerizing me. “Don’ t gaze at them, dear,” Genaro said to me as if he were talking to a child.

I began to jum p up and dow n and to roar like an animal. The man jum ped dow n to the ground. “Don’ t pay any more attention to thos e clow ns,” don Juan said. “Let’s talk as usual.” He said that we had gone there for my enlightenm ent, and that I was failing miserably. I had to reorganize myself. The first thing to do was to realize that my assemblage poi nt had move d and was now mak ing obs cure emanations glow . To carry the feelings from my usual state of awareness into the world I had assembled was inde ed a travesty, for fear is onl y prevalent among the emanations of daily life.

He laughe d at me. He said that soone r or late r I had to cure myself of my madne ss, and that to take the initiative and face up to thos e four seers was infinitely less prepos terous than the idea that I was seeing them at all. He said that to him madne ss was to be conf ront ed by men who had been bur ied for two thous and years and were still alive, and not to think that that was the epitom e of prepos terous ness. I heard everything he said with clarity, but I was not really paying attention to him. I was terrified of the men aroun d the rock. They seemed to b e preparing to jum p us, to jum p me really. They were fixed on me. My right arm began to shake as if I were stricken by som e muscular disorder. Then I became aware that the light in the sky had change d. I had not not iced before that it was already dawn. Th e strange thing was that an unc ont rollable urge made me stand up and run to the group of men. I had at that mom ent two com pletely different feelings about the same event. The mino r one was of sheer terror. The other, the major one , was of total indi fferenc e. I coul d not have cared less. When I reached the group I realized that do n Juan was right ; they were not really men.

I called out their names ove r and ove r again. I thrashed around in darkne ss for a few minut es. Don Juan came to my side and startled me. I did not see Genaro. “Let’s go hom e,” he said. “We have a long walk.” D on Juan com mented on how well I had performed at the site of the bur ied seers, especially dur ing the last part of our encount er with them. He said that a shift of the assemblage poi nt is marked by a change in light . In the daytime, light becom es very dark; at night , darkne ss becom es twilight . He adde d that I had performed two shifts by myself, aided onl y by animal fright. The onl y thing he found obj ectiona ble was my indul ging in fear, especially after I had realized that warriors have not hing to fear. “How do you know I had realized that?” I asked. “Because you were free. When fear disappe ars all the ties that bind us dissolve,” he said. “An ally was grippi ng your foot because it was attracted by your animal terror.” I told him how sorry I was for not being able to uphol d my realizations . “Don’ t conc ern you rself with that.” He laughe d. “You know that such realizations are a dime a doz en; they don’ t amount to anyt hing in the life of warriors, because they are canceled out as the assemblage poi nt shifts. “What Genaro and I wanted to do was to make you shift very deeply.

The four seers have collected twelve allies. “The count ryside in Mexico and also certain cities are dange rous . What happe ned to you can happe n to any man or wom an.

He laughe d and shook his head in disbelief. “It’s time for you to shift that assemblage poi nt of your s just a bit,” he said. “I can’t talk to you when you are in your idiot’s stage.” He smacked me with the palm of his hand on three spot s: right on the crest of my right hipbone , on the center of my back below my shoul der blades, and on the uppe r part of my right pectoral muscle. My ears immediately began to buz z. A trickle of blood ran out of my right nos tril, an d som ething inside me became unpl ugge d.

That woul d be prepos terous .” He went on to expl ain that the ancient seers’ conc ern with death made them look into the most bizarre pos sibilities. The one s who opt ed for the allie s’ pattern had in mind, doubt less, a desire for a haven. And they found it, at a fixed pos ition in one of the seven bands of inor ganic awareness. The seers felt that they were relatively safe there. After all, they were separated from the daily world by a nearly insurmou ntable barrier, the barrier of perception set by the assemblage poi nt. “When the four seers saw that you coul d shift your assemblage poi nt they took off like bats out of hell,” he said and laughe d. “Do you mean that I assembled one of the se ven worlds?” I asked. “No, you didn’ t,” he replied. “But you have done it before, when the seers and their allies chased you.

I felt exha usted and wanted to rest, to s leep, but don Juan was pressed for time. He immediately started his expl anation. He said that the old seers had found out a way to utilize the rolling force and be prope lled by it.

I asked him abo ut the difference between the earth’s boos t and the tum bler’s boos t. He expl ained that the earth’s boos t is the force of alignm ent of on ly the amber emanations , it is a boos t that height ens awareness to unt hinka ble degrees. To the new seers it is a blast o f unl imited cons cious ness, which they call total freedom . He said that the tum bler’s boos t, on the other hand, is the force of death. Unde r the impact of the tum bler, the assemblage poi nt move s to new, unpr edictable pos itions . Thus , the old seers were alwa ys alone in their jour neys, although the enterprise they were invol ved in was always com muna l.

He laughe d upr oarious ly.

Their love for life is truly beyond me.” “How can that be love for life, don Juan? It’s som ething nauseating, ” I said. “What else coul d pus h a man to thos e extremes if it is not love for life?” he asked . “They love d life so intensely that they were not willing to give it up. That’s the way I have seen it. My benefactor saw som ething else. He believed that they were afraid to die, which is not the same as lovi ng life. I say that they were afraid to die b ecause they love d life and because they had seen marvels, and not because they were greedy little mons ters. No. They were aberrant because nobody ever challenge d them and they were spoi led like rotten children, but their daring was impeccable and so was th eir cour age. “Woul d you venture into the unknow n out of greed? No way. Greed works onl y in the world of ordinary affairs. To venture into that terrifying lone liness one must have som ething greater than greed.

Don Juan had said that techni cally, as soon as the assemblage poi nt shifts, we are asleep. I wonde red, for instance, if I was sound asleep from the stand of an onl ooke r, just as Genaro had been asleep to me. I asked don Juan about it as soon as he returned. “You are absolutely asleep without having to be stretched out ,” he replied. “If peopl e in a nor mal state of awareness saw you now , you woul d appe ar to them to be a bit dizzy, even drunk. ” He expl ained that dur ing no rmal sleep, the shift of the assemblage poi nt runs along either edge of man’s band. Such shifts are always coupl ed with slum ber. Shifts that are induc ed by practice occur along the midsection of man’s band and are not coupl ed with slum ber, yet a dreamer is asleep. “Right at this jun cture is where the new and the old seers made their separate bids for pow er,” he went on. “The old seers wanted a replica of the body, but with more phys ical strengt h, so they made their assemblage poi nts slide along the right edge of man’s band. The deepe r they move d along the right edge the more bizarre their dreaming body became. You, your self, witnessed last night the mons trous result of a deep shift along the right edge .” He said that the new seers were com pletely different, that they maintain their as semblage poi nts along the midsection of man’s band.

The intensely hum anized dreaming body of the old seers drove them to look for answers that were equa lly persona l, hum anized. Don Juan sudde nly seemed to be gropi ng for words. “There is anot her death defier,” he said curtly, “so unl ike the four you’ ve seen that he’s indi stingui shable from the average man in the street. He’s accom plished this uni que feat by being able to ope n and close his gap whenever he wants.” He played with his finge rs almost nervous ly. “Th e ancient seer that the nagua l Sebastian found in 1723 is that death defier,” he went on. “We count that day as the beginni ng of our line, the second beginni ng. That death defier, who’ s been on the earth for hundr eds of years, has change d the lives of ever y nagua l he met, som e more profoundl y than others. And he has met every singl e nagua l of our line since that day in 1723. ” Don Juan looke d fixedly at me. I got strange ly embarrassed. I thought my embarrassment was the result of a dilemma. I had very seriou s doubt s about the cont ent of the story, and at the same time I had the most disconc erting trust that everything he had said was true. I expr essed my qua nda ry to him. “The probl em of rationa l disbelief is not your s alone ,” don Juan said. “My benefactor was at first plague d by the same que stion.

My benefactor said that his qua nda ries stemmed from the fact that the shoc k of meeting such a creature had lum ped toge ther a num ber of emanati ons. It takes time for thos e emanations to separate themselves.” Don Juan went on to expl ain that as my assemblage poi nt kept on shifting, a mom ent woul d com e when it woul d hit the prope r com bination of emanations ; at that mom ent the proof of the existence of that man woul d becom e ove rwhelmingl y evident to me. I felt com pelled to talk again about my ambivalence. “We’re deviating from ou r subj ect,” he said. “It may seem that I’m trying to convi nce you of the existence of that man; and what I meant to talk ab out is the fact that the old seer know s how to handl e the rolling force. Whether or not you believe that he exists is not impor tant. Som eday you’ ll know for a fact that he certainly succeeded in closing his gap. The energy that he bor row s from the nagua l e very generation he uses exclusively to close his gap.” “How did he succeed in closing it?” I asked. “There is no way of know ing that,” he replied. “I’ve talked to two other nagua ls who saw that man face to face, the nagua l Julian and the nagua l Elias. Ne ither of them kne w how . The man never revealed how he closes that ope ning, which I suppos e begins to expa nd after a time. The nagua l Sebastian said that when he first saw the old seer, the man was very weak, actually dyi ng. But my benefactor fou nd him pran cing vigor ous ly, like a young man.”"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":" 270 Don Juan said that the nagua l Sebastian nickna med that nameless man “the tenant,” for they struck an arrange ment by which the man was given energy, lodgi ng so to speak, and he paid rent in the form of favor s and know ledg e. “Did anybody ever get hur t in the exchange ?” I asked. “None of the nagua ls who exchange d energy with him was injured,” he replied. “The man’s com mitment was that he’d onl y take a bit of supe rfluous energy from the nagua l in exchange for gifts, for extra ordinary abilities. For instance, the nagua l Julian got the gait of pow er. With it, he coul d activate or make dor mant the emanations inside his cocoon in order to look young or old at will.” Don Juan expl ained that the death defiers in general went as far as rende ring dor mant all the emanations inside their cocoons , except thos e that matched the emanations of the allies. In this fashion they were able to imitate the allies in som e form. Each of the death defiers we had encount ered at the rock, don Juan said , had been able to move his assemblage poi nt to a precise spot on his cocoon in order to empha size the emanations shared with the allies and to interact with them. But they were all una ble to move it back to its usual pos ition and interact with peop le. The tenant, on the other hand, is capable of shifting his assemblage poi nt to assemble the everyda y world as if not hing had ever happe ned. Don Juan also said that his benefactor was convi nced?and he fully agreed with him?that what takes place dur ing the borro wing of energy is that the old sorcerer move s the nagua l’s assemblage poi nt to empha size the ally’s emanations inside the nagua l’s cocoon. He then uses the great jolt of energy prod uced by thos e emanations that sudde nly becom e aligne d after being so deeply dor mant."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" 271 He said that the energy locked within us, in the dor mant emanations , has a tremendous force and an incalculable scope . We can onl y vague ly assess the scope of that tremendo us force, if we cons ider that the energy invol ved in perceiving and acting in the world of everyda y life is a produc t of the alignm ent of hardly one tenth of the emanations encased in man’s cocoon. “What happe ns at the mom ent of death is that all that energy is released at onc e,” he cont inue d. “Living beings at that mom ent becom e floode d by the most inconc eivable force. It is not the rolling force that has cracked their gaps, because that force never enters inside the cocoon; it onl y makes it collapse. What floods them is the force of all the emanations that are sudde nly aligne d a fter being dor mant for a lifetime. There is no out let for such a giant force except to escape through the gap.” He adde d that the old sorcerer has found a way to tap that energy. By aligni ng a limited and very specific spectrum of the dor mant emanations i nside the nagua l’s cocoon, the old seer taps a limited but gigantic jolt. “How do you think he takes that energy into his ow n body? ” I asked. “By cracking the nagua l’s gap,” he replied. “He move s the nagua l’s assemblage poi nt unt il the gap ope ns a little. When the energy of newly aligne d emanations is released through that ope ning, he takes it into his ow n gap.” “Why is that old seer doi ng what he’s doi ng? ” I asked. “My opi nion is that he’s caught in a circle he can’t break,” he replied. “We got into an agr eement with him.

He stressed that I now kne w the order in which the new seers had arrange d them. In the last sessions of his expl anation, he said, he had given me a detailed account of the two forces that aid our assemblage poi nts to move : the earth’s boos t and the rolling force. He had also expl ained the three techni que s worked out by the new seers?stalking, intent, and dreaming ?and their effects on the move ment of the assemblage poi nt. “Now , the onl y thing left for you to do before the expl anation of the mastery of awareness is com pleted,” he went on, “is to break the barrier of perception by your self. You must move your assemblage poi nt, una ided by anyo ne, and align anot her great band of emanations . “Not to do this will turn everything you’ ve learned and done with me into merely talk, just words. And words are fairly cheap.” He expl ained that when the assemblage poi nt is movi ng away from its custom ary po sition and reaches a certain depth, it breaks a barrier that mom entarily disrupt s its capacity to align emanations .

In the cour se of my appr enticeship with do n Juan, he had gui ded me count less times to see the barrier of perception. At first I had liked the idea of a wall of fog. Don Juan had warned me that the old seers had also preferred to see it tha t way. He had said that there is great comfort and ease in seeing it as a wall of fog, but that there is also the grave dange r of turning som ething incomprehensible into som ething som ber and forebod ing; hence, his recom menda tion was to keep incom prehensibl e things incom prehensible rather than making them part of the inve ntory of the first attention. After a shor tlived feeling of com fort in seeing the wall of fog I had to agree with don Juan that it was better to keep the transition period as an incom prehens ible abstraction, but by then it was impos sible for me to break the fixation of my awareness. Every time I was placed in a pos ition to break the barrier of perception I saw the wall of fog. On one occasion, in the past, I had com plained to don Juan and Gen aro that although I wanted to see it as som ething else, I coul dn’ t change it. Don Juan had com mented that that was unde rstanda ble, because I was morbid and som ber, that he and I were very different in this respect. He was light hearted and practical and he did not worship the hum an inve ntory. I, on the other hand, was unw illing to throw my inve ntory out the wind ow and cons eque ntly I was heavy, sinister, and impractical. I had been shoc ked and sadde ned by his harsh criticism and became very gloom y. Don Juan a nd Genaro had laughe d unt il tears rolled dow n their cheeks."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" 275 Genaro had adde d that on top of all that I was vindi ctive and had a tende ncy to get fat. They had laughe d so hard I finally felt obl iged to join them. Don Juan had told me then that exercises of a ssembling other worlds allow ed the assemblage poi nt to gain expe rience in shifting. I had always wonde red, how ever, how to get the initial boos t to dislodge my assemblage poi nt from its usual pos ition. When I’d que stioned him about it in the past he’d poi n ted out that since alignm ent is the force that is invol ved in everything, intent is what makes the assemblage poi nt move . I asked him again about it. “You’ re in a pos ition now to answer that question your self,” he replied. “The mastery of awareness is what gives the assemblage poi nt its boos t. After all, there is really very little to us hum an being s; we are, in essence, an assemblage poi nt fixed at a certain pos ition. Our enemy and at the same time our friend is our internal dialog ue, our inve ntory. Be a w arrior; shut off you r internal dialogue ; make your inve ntory and then throw it away. The new seers make accurate inve ntories and then laugh at them. Without the inve ntory the assemblage poi nt becom es free.” Don Juan reminde d me that he had talked a great d eal about one of the most sturdy aspects of our inve ntory: our idea of God. That aspect, he said, was like a pow erful glue that bound the assemblage poi nt to its original pos ition. If I were goi ng to assemble anot her true world with anot her great band of e manations , I had to take an obl igatory step in order to release all ties from my assemblage poi nt. “That step is to see the mold of man,” he said. “You must do that toda y una ided.” “What’s the mold of man?” I asked."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" 276 “I’ve helped you see it many times,” he replied. “You know what I’m talking about .” I refrained from saying that I did no t know what he was talking about . If he said that I had seen the mold of man, I must have done that, although I did not have the foggi est idea what it was like. He kne w what w as goi ng through my mind . He gave me a know ing smile and slow ly shook his head from side to side. “The mold of man is a huge cluster of emanations in the great band of organic life,” he said. “It is called the mold of man because the cluster appe ars onl y i nside the cocoon of man. “The mold of man is the por tion of the Eagle’s emanations that seers can see directly without any dange r to themselves.” There was a long pause before he spoke again. “To break the barrier of perception is the last task of the mast ery of awareness,” he said. “In order to move you r assemblage poi nt to that pos ition you must gather enough energy. Make a jour ney of recove ry. Remember what you’ ve done !” I tried uns uccessfully to recall what was the mold of man. I felt an excruciating f rustration that soon turned into real ange r. I was furious with myself, with don Juan, with everybody. Don Juan was unt ouc hed by my fury. He said matteroffactly that ange r was a natural reaction to the hesitation of the assemblage poi nt to move on com mand. “It will be a long time before you can appl y the principle that your com mand is the Eagle’s com mand, ” he said. “That’s the essence of the mastery of intent. In"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":" 277 the meantime, make a com mand now not to fret, not even at the worst mom ents of doubt . It will b e a slow process unt il that com mand is heard and obe yed as if it were the Eagle’s com mand. ” He also said that there was an unm easurable area of awareness in between the custom ary pos ition of the assemblage poi nt and the pos ition where there are no more dou bts, which is almost the place where the barrier of perception makes its appe arance. In that unm easurable area, warriors fall prey to every conc eivable misdeed. He warned me to be on the lockout and not lose conf idence, for I woul d una voi dably be struck at one time or anot her by grippi ng feelings of defeat. “The new seers recom mend a very simple act when impatience, or despair, or ange r, or sadne ss com es their way,” he cont inue d. “They recom mend that warriors roll their eyes. Any direction will do; I prefer to roll mine clockw ise. “The move ment of the eyes makes the assemblage poi nt shift mom entarily. In that move ment, you will find relief. This is in lieu of true mastery of intent.”’ I com plained that there was not enough time for him to tell me more about intent. “It will all com e back to you som eday,” he assured me. “One thing will trigge r anot her. One key word and all of it will tum ble out of you as if the door of an ove rstuffed closet had given way.” He went back then to discussing the mold of man. He s aid that to see it on my ow n, una ided by anyone , was an impor tant step, because all of us have certain ideas that must be broke n before we are free; the seer who travels into the unknow n to see the unknow able must be in an impeccable state of being. He win ked at me and said that to be in an impeccable state of being is to be free of rationa l assum ptions and rationa l fears. He adde d that bot h my rationa l"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" 278 assum ptions and my rationa l fears were preventing me at that mom ent from realigni ng the emanations that w oul d make me remember seeing the mold of man. He urged me to relax and move my eyes in order to make my assemblage poi nt shift. He repeated ove r and ove r that it was really impo rtant to remember having seen the mold before I see it again. And since he was pressed for time there was no room for my usual slow ness. I move d my eyes as he sugge sted. Almost immediately I forgot my discom fort and then a sudde n flash of memory came to me and I remembered that I had seen the mold of man. It had happe ned years earli er on an occasion that had been qui te memorable to me, because from the poi nt of view of my Cathol ic upbr ing ing, don Juan had made the most sacrilegious statements I had ever heard. It had all started as a casual conve rsation while we hiked in the foot hill s of the Sonor an desert. He was expl aining to me the implications of what he was doi ng to me with his teachings . We had stoppe d to rest and had sat dow n on som e large boul ders. He had cont inue d expl aining his teaching procedur e, and this had encour aged me to try for the hundr edth time to give him an account of how I felt about it. It was evident that he did not want to hear about it anym ore. He made me change levels of awareness and told me that if I woul d see the mold of man, I might unde rstand everything he was doi ng and thus save us bot h years of toil. He gave me a detailed expl anation of what the mold of man was. He did not talk about it in terms of the Eagle’s emanations , but in terms of a pattern of energy that serves to stamp the qua lities of hum anne s s on an amorphous blob of biologi cal matter. At least, I unde rstood it that way, especially after he further described the mold of man using a mechanical analogy. He said that it was like a gigantic die that stamps out hum an beings endl essly as if they wer e com ing to it on a massproduc tion conve yor belt. He vividly mimed the process by bringi ng the"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" 279 palms of his hands toge ther with great force, as if the die molded a hum an being each time its two halves were clappe d. He also said that every species has a mol d of its ow n, and every indi vidua l of every species molded by the process shows characteristics particular to its ow n kind. He began then an extremely disturbing elucidation about the mold of man. He said that the old seers as well as the mystics of our wo rld have one thing in com mon? they have been able to see the mold of man but not unde rstand what it is. Mystics, throughout the centuries, have given us movi ng account s of their expe riences. But these account s, how ever beautiful, are flawed by the gross and despairing mistake of believing the mold of man to be an om nipot ent, om niscient creator; and so is the interpretation of the old seers, who called the mold of man a friendl y spirit, a protector of man. He said that the new seers are the onl y one s who have the sobr iety to see the mold of man and unde rstand what it is. What they have com e to realize is that the mold of man is not a creator, but the pattern of every hum an attribute we can think of and som e we cannot even conc eive. The mold is our God because we are what it stamps us with and not because it has created us from not hing and made us in its image and likeness. Don Juan said that in his opi nion to fall on our kne es in the presence of the mold of man reeks of arrog ance and hum an selfcenteredne ss. As I heard don Juan’s expl anation I got terribly worried. Even though I had never cons idered my self to be a practicing Cathol ic, I was shoc ked by his blasphe mous implications . I had been pol itely listening to him, yet I had been yearning for a pause in his b arrage of sacrilegious judgm ents in order to change the subj ect. But he went on drum ming his poi nt in a merciless way. I finally interrupted him and told him that I believed that God exists."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" 280 He retorted that my belief was based on faith and, as such, was a secondha nd convi ction that did not amount to anyt hing; my belief in the existence of God was, like everyone else’s, based on hearsay and not on the act of seeing, he said. He assured me that even if I was able to see, I was bound to make the same misjudgm ent that mystics have made. Anyone who sees the mold of man autom atically assum es that it is God. He called the mystical expe rience a chance seeing, a one shot affair that has no signi ficance whatsoever because it is the result of a random move ment of the a ssemblage poi nt. He asserted that the new seers are inde ed the onl y one s who can pass a fair judgm ent on this matter, because they have ruled out chance seeings and are capable of seeing the mold of man as often as they please. They have seen, therefore, t hat what we call God is a static prototype of hum anne ss without any pow er. For the mold of man cannot unde r any circum stances help us by intervening in our behalf, or puni sh our wrongdo ings , or reward us in any way. We are simply the produc t of its stamp; we are its impression. The mold of man is exactly what its name tells us it is, a pattern, a form, a cast that groups toge ther a particular bunc h of fiberlike elements, which we call man. What he had said put me in a state of great distress. But he seemed unc onc erned with my genui ne turmoil. He kept on needling me with what he called the unf orgivable crime of the chance seers, which makes us focus our irreplaceable energy on som ething that has no pow er whatsoever to do anyt hing. The more he talked, the gr eater my annoya nce. When I became so annoye d that I was about to shout at him, he had me change into yet a deeper state of height ened awareness. He hit me on my right side, between my hipbone and my"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" 281 rib cage. That blow sent me soaring into a radiant light , into a diapha nous sour ce of the most peaceful and exqui site beatitude . That light was a haven, an oasis in the blackne ss around me. From my subj ective poi nt of view, I saw that light for an immeasurable lengt h of time. The splendor of the sight was beyond anyt hing I can say, and yet I coul d not figu re out what it was that made it so beautiful. Then the idea came to me that its beauty grew out of a sense of harmony, a sense of peace and rest, of having arrived, of being safe at long last. I felt myself inha ling and exha ling in qui etude and relief. What a gor geous sense of plenitude ! I kne w beyond a shadow of doubt that I had com e face to face with God, the sour ce of everything. And I kne w that God love d me. God was love and forgiveness. The light bathed me, and I felt clean, delivered. I wept unc ont rollably, mainly for myself. The sight of that resplende nt light made me feel unw orthy, villainous . Sudde nly, I heard don Juan’s voi ce in my ear. He said that I had to go beyond the mold, that the mold was merely a stage, a stopove r that brought tempor ary peace and serenity to thos e who jour ney into the unknow n, but that it was sterile, static. It was at the same time a flat reflected image in a mirror and the mirror itself. And the image was man’s image. I passiona tely resented what don Juan was saying; I rebelled against his blasphe mous , sacrilegious words. I wanted to tell him off, but I coul d not break the bindi ng pow er of my seeing. I was caught in it. Don Juan seemed to know exactly how I felt and what I wante d to tell him. “You can’t tell the nagua l off,” he said in my ear. “It is the nagua l who’ s enabling you to see. It is the nagua l’s technique , the nagua l’s pow er. The nagua l is the gui de.”"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":" 282 It was at that poi nt that I realized som ething about the voi ce in m y ear. It was not don Juan’s, although it sounde d very much like his voi ce. Also, the voi ce was right . The instigator of that seeing was the nagua l Juan Matus. It was his techni que and his pow er that was making me see God. He said it was not God, but the m old of man; I kne w that he was right . Yet I coul d not adm it that, not out of annoya nce or stubbor nne ss, but simply out of a sense of ultimate loya lty to and love for the divinity that was in front of me. As I gazed into the light with all the passion I was capable of, the light seemed to conde nse and I saw a man. A shiny man that exude d charisma, love , unde rstandi ng, sincerity, truth. A man that was the sum total of all that is good. The fervo r I felt on seeing that man was well beyond anyt hing I had ever f elt in my life. I did fall on my kne es. I wanted to worship God personi fied, but don Juan intervened and whacked me on my left uppe r chest, close to my clavicle, and I lost sight of God. I was left with a tantalizing feeling, a mixture of remorse, elation, certainties, and doubt s. Don Juan made fun of me. He called me pious and careless and said I woul d make a great priest; now I coul d even pass for a spiritual leader who had had a chance seeing of God. He urged me, in ajocular way, to start preaching and d escribe what I had seen to everyone . In a very casual but seemingl y interested manne r he made a statement that was part que stion, part assertion. “And the man?” he asked. “You can’t forget that God is a male.” The immensity of som ething inde finable began t o dawn on me as I entered into a state of great clarity. “Very cozy, eh?” don Juan adde d, smiling. “God"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":" 283 is a male. What a relief” After recoun ting to don Juan what I had remembered, I asked him about som ething that had just struck me as being terribly odd. To see the mold of man, I had obvi ous ly gone through a shift of my assemblage poi nt. The recollection of the feelings and realizations I had had then was so vivid that it gave me a sense of utter futility. Everything I had done and felt at that time I was feeling now . I asked him how it was pos sible that having had such a clear com prehension, I coul d have forgo tten it so com pletely. It was as if not hing of what had happe ned to me had mattered, for I always had to start from po int one regardless of how much I might have adva nced in the past. “That’s onl y an emotional impression, ” he said. “A total misappr ehension. Whatever you did years ago is solidly enclosed in som e unus ed emanations . That day when I made you see the mold of man, for instance, I had a true misappr ehension myself. I thought that if you saw it, you woul d be able to unde rstand it. It was a true misunde rstandi ng on my part.” Don Juan expl ained that he had always regarded himself as being very slow to unde rstand. He had never had any chance of t esting his belief, because he did not have a poi nt of reference. When I came along and he became a teacher, which was som ething totally new to him, he realized that there is no way to speed up unde rstandi ng and that to dislod ge the assemblage poi nt is not enough. He had thought that it woul d be sufficient. Soon he became aware that since the assemblage poi nt nor mally shifts dur ing dreams, som etimes to extraordinarily distant pos itions , whenever we unde rgo an induc ed shift we are all expe rts at immediately c om pensating for it. We rebalance our selves cons tantly and activity goe s on as if not hing has happe ned to us."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 284 He remarked that the value of the new seers’ conc lusions doe s not becom e evident unt il one tries to move som eone else’s assemblage poi nt. The new s eers said that what count s in this respect is the effort to reinforce the stability of the assemblage poi nt in its new pos ition. They cons idered this to be the onl y teaching procedur e worth discussing. And they kne w that it is a long process that has to be carried out little by little at a snail’s pace. Don Juan said then that he had used pow er plants at the beginni ng of my appr enticeship in accordance with a recom menda tion of the new seers. They kne w by expe rience and by seeing that pow er plants shake the assemblage poi nt way out of its nor mal setting. The effect of pow er plants on the assemblage poi nt is in principle very much like that of dreams: dreams make it move ; but pow er plants manage the shift on a greater and more engul fing scale. A teacher then u ses the disorienting effects of such a shift to reinforce the not ion that the perception of the world is never final. I remembered then that I had seen the mold of man five more times ove r the years. With each new time I had becom e less passiona te about it . I coul d never get ove r the fact, how ever, that I always saw God as a male. At the end it stoppe d being God for me and became the mold of man, not because of what don Juan had said, but because the pos ition of a male God became unt enable. I coul d then und erstand don Juan’s statements about it. They had not been blasphe mous or sacrilegious in the least; he had not made them from within the cont ext of the daily world. He was right in saying that the new seers have an edge in being capable of seeing the mold of man as often as they want. But what was more impor tant to me was that they had sobr iety in order to examine what they saw. I asked him why it was that I always saw the mold of man as a male. He said that it was because my assemblage poi nt did not have the stability then to remain"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":" 285 com pletely glued to its new pos ition and shifted laterally in man’s band. It was the same case as seeing the barrier of perception as a wall of fog. What made the assemblage poi nt move laterally was a nearly una voi dable desire , or necessity, to rende r the incom prehensible in terms of what is most familiar to us: a barrier is a wall and the mold of man cannot be anyt hing else but a man. He thought that if I were a wom an I woul d see the mold as a wom an. Don Juan stood up then and said that it was time for us to take a stroll in tow n, that I shoul d see the mold of man among peopl e. We walked in silence to the squa re, but before we got there I had an unc ont ainable surge of energy and ran dow n the street to the out skirts of tow n. I c ame to a bridge , and right there, as if it had been waiting for me, I saw the mold of man as a resplende nt, warm, amber light . I fell on my kne es, not so much out of piety, but as phys ical reaction to awe. The sight of the mold of man was more astoni shing than ever. I felt, without any arroga nce, that I had gone through an enor mous change since the first time I had seen it. How ever, all the things I had seen and learned had onl y given me a greater, more profound appr eciation for the miracle that I had in fr ont of my eyes. The mold of man was supe rimpos ed on the bridge at first, then I refocused my eyes and saw that the mold of man extende d up and dow n into infinity; the bridge was but a meager shell, a tiny sketch supe rimpos ed on the eternal. And so were the minut e figu res of peopl e who mov ed around me, looki ng at me with una bashed curiosity. But I was beyond their touc h, although at that mom ent I was as vul nerable as I coul d be. The mold of man had no pow er to protect me or spare me, yet I love d it with a pa ssion that kne w no limits.

I was sudde nly kne eling at the bridge while a group of peasants looke d at me and laughe d. Don Juan got to my side and helped me up and walked me back to the hous e. “There are two ways of seeing the mold of man,” don Juan began as soon as we sat dow n. “You can see it as a man or you can see it as a light . That depends on the shift of the assemblage poi nt. If the shift is lateral, the mold is a hum an being; if the shift is in the midsection of man’s band, the mold is a light . The onl y value of what you’ ve done toda y is that your assemblage poi nt shifted in the midsection. ” He said that the pos ition where one sees the mold of man is very close to that where the dreaming body and the barrier of perception appe ar. That was the reason the new seers recom mend that the mold of man be seen and unde rstood. “Are you sure you unde rstand what the mold of man really is?” he asked with a smile. “I assure you, don Juan, that I’m perfectly aware of what the mold of man is,” I said. “I heard you shout ing inanit ies to the mold of man when I got to the bridge ,” he said with a most malicious smile.

He made it very clear that we woul d nev er be there toge ther again. Perhaps his feeling migh t return to the place, he said, but never again the totality of himself. In Oaxaca, don Juan spent hour s looki ng at munda ne, trivial things , the faded color of walls, the shape of distant mount ains, the p attern on cracked cement, the faces of peopl e. Then we went to the squa re and sat on his favor ite bench, which was unoc cupi ed, as it always was when he wanted it. During ou r long walk in the city, I had tried my best to work myself into a mood of sadne ss a nd moroseness, but I just coul d not do it. There was som ething festive about his departure. He expl ained it as the unr estrainable vigor of total freedom . “Freedom is like a cont agious disease,” he said. “It is transmitted; its carrier is an impeccable nagu al. Peopl e might not appr eciate that, and that’s because they don’ t want to be free. Freedom is fright ening. Remember that. But not for us. I’ve groom ed myself nearly all my life for this mom ent.

He said that the dreaming body and the barrier of perception are pos itions of the assemblage poi nt, and that that know ledge is as vital to seers as know ing how to read and write is to mode rn man. Both are accom plishm ents attained after years of practice."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":" 289 “It is very impor tant that you remember, right now , the time when your assemblage poi nt reached that pos ition and it created your dreaming body, ” he said with tremend ous urgency.

That term belongs to the old seers, toge ther with the moo d. I don’ t particularly care for their mood, but I have to adm it that I like their term The oth er. It’s mysterious and forbidde n. Just like the old seers, it gives me the feeling of darkne ss, of shadow s. The old seers said that the other always com es shroude d in wind. ” Over the years don Juan and other members of his party had tried to make me aware that we can be in two places at onc e, that we can expe rience a sort of perceptual dua lism. As don Juan spoke , I began to remember som ething so deeply forgotten that at first it was as if I had onl y heard about it. Then, step by step, I realized that I had lived that expe rience myself. I had been in two places at onc e. It happe ned one night in the mount ains of nor thern Mexico. I had been collecting plants with don Juan all day. We had stoppe d for the night and I had nearly fallen asleep from fatigue when su dde nly there was a gus t of wind and don Genaro sprang up from the darkne ss right in fron t of me and nearly scared me to death."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" 29 0 My first thought was one of suspicion. I believed that don Genaro had been hiding in the bus hes all day, waiting for darkne ss to set in before making his terrifying appe arance. As I looke d at him prancing around, I not iced that there was som ething truly odd about him that night. Som ething palpable, real, and yet som ething I coul d not pinpoi nt. He joke d with me and hor sed around, per forming acts that defied my reason. Don Juan laughe d like an idiot at my dismay. When he judge d that the time was right , he made me shift into height ened awareness and for a mom ent I was able to see don Juan and don Genaro as two blobs of light . Genaro was not the fleshandbl ood do n Genaro that I kne w in my state of nor mal awareness but his dreaming body. I coul d tell, because I saw him as a ball of fire that was above the ground. He was not root ed as don Juan was. It was as if Genaro, the blob of light , wer e on the verge of taking off, already up in the air, a coupl e of feet off the ground, ready to zoom away. Anot her thing I had done that night , which sudde nly became clear to me as I recollected the event, was that I kne w automatically that I had to move my eyes in order to make my assemblage poi nt shift. I coul d, with my intent, align the emanations that made me see Genaro as a blob of light , or I coul d align the emanations that made me see him as merely odd, unknow n, strange . When I saw Genaro as odd, his eyes had a malevol ent glare, like the eyes of a beast in the darkne ss. But they were eyes, none theless. I did not see them as poi nts of amber ligh t. That night don Juan said that Genaro was goi ng to help my assemblage poi nt shift very deeply, that I shoul d imitate him and follow everything he did. Genaro stuck out his rear end and then thrust his pelvis forward with great force. I thought"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":" 291 it was an obs cene gesture. He repeated it over and ove r again, movi ng around as if he were dancing. Don Juan nudge d me o n the arm, urging me to imitate Genaro, and I did. Both of us sort of rom ped aroun d, performing that grotesque move ment. After a while, I had the feeling that my body was executing the move ment on its ow n, without what seemed to be the real me. The separat ion between my body and the real me became even more pronounc ed, and then at a given instant I was looki ng at som e ludi crous scene where two men were making lewd gestures at each other. I watched in fascination and realized that I was one of the two men. T he mom ent I became aware of it I felt som ething pul ling me and I found myself again thrusting my pelvis backw ard and forward in uni son with Genaro. Almost immediately, I not iced that anot her man standi ng next to don Juan was watching us. The wind was blow ing around him. I coul d see his hair being ruffled.

You saw your dreaming body watching yo u. And his dancing did the trick.” I asked him to expl ain to me how Genaro’s lewd move ment coul d have produc ed such a dra stic effect. “You’ re a prude ,” he said. “Genaro used your immediate displeasure and embarrassment at having to perform a lewd gesture. Since he was in his dreaming body, he had the pow er to see the Eagle’s emanations ; from that adva ntage it was a cinch to make your assemblage poi nt move .” He said that whatever Genaro had helped me to do that night was minor , that Genaro had move d my assemblage poi nt and made it produc e a dreaming body many, many times, but that thos e events were not what he wanted me to rem ember. “I want you to realign the prope r emanation s and remember the time when you really woke up in a dreaming pos ition, ”’ he said.

Don Genaro nudge d me to attract my attention, and then I witnessed a most disturbing sight . I actually saw Genaro on the other side of the squa re. He was beckoni ng me t o com e.

He said that he was goi ng to use my state of height ened awareness to show me that there is no end to the mystery of man and to the mystery of the world.

I listened carefully, but I coul d not unde rstand a word of what he was sayi ng; he was either speaking in a langua ge foreign to me or it was mum bo jum bo.

I had the feeling that my mind was different from usual, although I coul d not figu re out what the difference was. I had a hard time thinki ng, reasoni ng out what was taking place.

She had darkbr ow n hair, bur ning brow n eyes that seemed to smile, and a poi nted, finely chiseled nos e. Her com plexion was fair but had been tanne d to a gor geous brow n.

I had got ten terribly irritated at his remarks. I had put on my clothes and stom ped out of the hous e in a fury. Don Juan had caught up with me on the front lawn.

I had to swallow hard and breathe deeply before I regained my calmness. “When we first sat dow n here to talk, I said that no rationa l assum ptions shoul d interfere with the actions of a seer,” he cont inue d in a stern tone . “I kne w that in order to reclaim what you ’ve done , you’ d have to dispense with rationa lity, but you’ d have to do it in .the level of awareness you are in now .” He expl ained that I had to unde rstand that rationa lity is a condi tion of alignm ent, merely the result of the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt. He empha sized that I had to unde rstand this when I was in a state of great vul nerability, as I was at that mom ent. To unde rstand it when my assemblage poi nt had reached the pos ition where ther e are no doubt s was useless, because realizations of that nature are com monpl ace in that pos ition.

They disappe ared from this world because they woke up at a dreaming pos ition beyond the limits of the know n. Your dreaming pos ition that day was in this world, but qui te a distance from the city of Oaxaca.” “How doe s ajour ney like that take pla ce?” I asked. “There is no way of know ing how it is don e,” he said. “Strong emotion, or unbe ndi ng intent, or great interest serves as a gui de; then the assemblage poi nt gets pow erfully fixed at the dreaming pos ition, long enough to drag there all the emana tions that are inside the cocoon. ” Don Juan said then that he had made me see count less times ove r the years of our association, either in states of nor mal awareness or in states of height ened awareness; I had seen count less things that I was now beginni ng to unde rstand in a more cohe rent fashion. This cohe rence was not logi cal or rationa l, but it clarified, none theless, in whatever strange way, everything I had done , everything that was done to me, and everything I had seen in all thos e years with him.

Don Juan stated that a displacement of the assemblage poi nt beyond the midline of the cocoon of man makes the entire world we know vanish from our view in one instant, as if it had been erased?for the stability, the subs tantiality, that seems to belong to our perceivable world is just the force of alignm ent.

When seers shift their assemblage poi nts, they are not conf ront ed with an illusion, they are conf ront ed with a not her world; that new world is as real as the one we are watching now , but the new fixation of their assemblage poi nts, which produc es that new world, is as much of a mirage as the old fixation. “Take your self, for example; you are now in a state of heigh tened awareness.

It exists onl y when your assemblage poi nt move s to the particular spot where you are now .” He adde d that the task warriors are faced with, after they finish their training, is one of integration. In the cour se of training, warriors, especially nagua l men, are made to shift to as many indi vid ual spot s as pos sible.

They were not pleasing figu res. The sensat ion that they were totally alien to me made me feel unc om fortable, impatient. I saw that the three allies were movi ng as if they were jum ping up and dow n; there was a faint glow inside them. The glow grew in intensity unt il, in at least one of the allies, it was qui te brilliant. The instant I saw that, I was facing a black world. I do not mean that it was dark as night is dark. It was rather that everything aroun d me was pitchbl ack. I looke d up at the sky and I coul d not find light anyw here. The sky was als o black and literally cove red with lines and irregul ar circles of various degrees of blackne ss. The sky looke d like a black piece of wood where the grain show ed in relief. I looke d dow n at the ground. It was fluffy. It seemed to be made of flakes of agarag ar; they were not dul l flakes, but they were not shiny either. It was som ething in between, which I had never seen in my life: black agaragar. I heard then the voi ce of seeing. It said that my assemblage poi nt had assembled a total world with other great b ands of emanations : a black world. I wanted to absorb every word I was hearing; in order to do that I had to split my conc entration. The voi ce stoppe d; my eyes became focused again. I was standi ng with don Juan just a few blocks away from the squa re. I ins tantly felt that I had no time to rest, that it woul d be useless to indul ge in being shoc ked. I rallied all my strengt h and asked don Juan if I had done what he had expe cted."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" 310 “You did exactly what you were expe cted to do, ” he said reassuringl y. “Let’s go b ack to the squa re and stroll around it one more time, for the last time in this world.” I refused to think about don Juan’s leaving, so I asked him about the black world. I had vague recollections of having seen it before. “It’s the easiest world to assemb le,” he said. “And of all you’ ve expe rienced, onl y the black world is worth cons idering. It is the onl y true alignm ent of anot her great band you have ever made. Everything else has been a lateral shift along man’s band, but still within the same great band . The wall of fog, the plain with yellow dune s, the world of the appa ritions?all are lateral alignm ents that our assemblage poi nts make as they appr oach a crucial pos ition. ” He expl ained as we walked back to the square that one of the strange qua lities of the black world is that it doe s not have the same emanations that account for time in our world. They are different emanations that produc e a different result. Seers that jour ney into the black world feel that they have been in it for an eternity, but in o ur world that turns out to be an instant. “The black world is a dreadful world because it ages the body, ” he said empha tically. I asked him to clarify his statements. He slowed dow n his pace and looke d at me. He reminde d me that Genaro, in his direct way, had tried to poi nt that out to me onc e, when he told me that we had plodde d in hell for an eternity while not even a minut e had passed in the world we know . Don Juan remarked that in his yout h he had becom e obs essed with the black world. He had wonde red, i n front of his benefactor, about what woul d happe n to him if he went into it and stayed there for a while. But as his benefactor was not"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":" 311 given to expl anations , he had simply plung ed don Juan into the black world to let him find out for himself. “The nagua l Julian’s pow er was so extraordinary,” don Juan cont inue d, “that it took me days to com e back from that black world.” “You mean it took you days to return your assemblage poi nt to its nor mal pos ition, don’ t you? ” I asked. “Yes. I mean that,” he said. He ex plained that in the few days that he was lost in the black world he aged at least ten years, if not more. The emanations inside his cocoon felt the strain of years of solitary struggl e. Silvio Manue l was a totally different case. The nagua l Julian also plu nge d him into the unknow n, but Silvio Manue l assembled anot her world with anot her set of bands , a world also without the emanations of time but one which has the oppos ite effect on seers. He disappe ared for seven years and yet he felt he had been gone onl y a mom ent. “To assemble other worlds is not onl y a matter of practice, but a matter of intent,” he cont inue d. “And it isn’t merely an exercise of bounc ing out of thos e worlds, like being pul led by a rubbe r band. You see, a seer has to be daring. Once you break the barrier of perception, you do n’t have to com e back to the same place in the world. See what I mean?” It slow ly dawned on me what he was saying. I had an almost invi ncible desire to laugh at such a prepos terous idea, but before the idea coalesced into a certainty, don Juan spoke to me and disrupt ed what I was about to remember. He said that for warriors the dange r of assembling other worlds is that thos e worlds are as pos sessive as our world. The force of align ment is such that onc e the"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":" 312 assemblage poi nt breaks away from its nor mal pos ition, it becom es fixed at other pos itions , by other alignm ents. And warriors run the risk of getting strande d in inconc eivable alone ness. The inqui sitive, rationa l part of me com mented that I had seen him in the black world as a ball of lum inos ity. It was pos sible, therefore, to be in that world with peopl e. “Only if peopl e follow you around by moving their ow n assemblage poi nts when you move your s,” he replied. “I shifted mine in order to be with you; otherwise you wou ld have been there alone with the allies.” We stoppe d walking, and don Juan said that it was time for me to go. “I want you to bypa ss all lateral shifts,” he said, “and go directly to the next total world: the black world. In a coupl e of days you’ ll have t o do the same thing by your self. You won’ t have time to pidd le around. You’ ll have to do it in order to escape death.” He said that breaking the barrier of perception is the culmination of everything seers do. From the mom ent that barrier is broke n, man an d his fate take on a different meaning for warriors. Because of the transcende ntal impor tance of breaking that barrier, the new seers use the act of breaking it as a final test. The test cons ists of jum ping from a mount aintop into an abys s while in a state of nor mal awareness. If the warrior jum ping into the abys s doe s not erase the daily world and assemble anot her one before he reaches bot tom , he dies. “What you are goi ng to do is to make this world vanish,” he went on, “but you are goi ng to remain som ewha t you rself. This is the ultimate bastion of awareness, the one the new seers count on. They know that after they bu rn with cons cious ness, they som ewhat retain the sense of being themselves.”"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":" 313 He smiled and poi nted to a street that we could see from where we were standi ng? the street where Genaro had show n me the mysteries of alignm ent. “That street, like any other, leads to eternity,” he said. “All you have to do is follow it in total silence. It’s time. Go now ! Go!” He turned around and walked away from me. Genaro was waiting for him at the corner. Genaro waved at me and then made a gesture of urging me to com e on. Don Juan kept on walking without turning to look. Genaro joined him. I started to follow them, but I kne w that it was wrong. Instead, I went in the oppos ite direction. The street was dark, lone ly, and bleak. I did not indul ge in feelings of failure or inadequa cy. I walked in inne r silence. My assemblage poi nt was movi ng at great speed. I saw the three allies. The line of their middl e made them loo k as if they were smiling sideways. I felt that I was being frivo lous . And then a windl ike force blew the world away. Epilogue A coupl e of days later, all the nagua l’s party and all the appr entices got toge ther on the flat mou ntaintop don Juan had told m e about . Don Juan said that each of the appr entices had already said goodbye to everybody, and that all of us were in a state of awareness that adm itted no sentimentalism. For us, he said, there was only action. We were warriors in a state of total war. Ev eryo ne, with the exception of don Juan, Genaro, Pablito, Nestor, and me, move d a shor t distance away from the flat mount aintop, in order to allow Pablito, Nestor, and me privacy to enter into a state of nor mal awareness."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":" 314 But before we did, don Juan took us by the arms and walked us around the flat top. “In a mom ent, you’ re goi ng to infend the move ment of you r assemblage poi nts,” he said. “And no one will help you. You are now alone . You must remember then that intent begins with a com mand. “The old seers us ed to say that if warriors are goi ng to have an internal dialogue , they shoul d have the prope r dialogue . For the old seers that meant a dialogue about sorcery and the enha ncement of their selfreflection. For the new seers, it doe sn’t mean dialogue , but the detached manipul ation of intent through sobe r com mands .” He said ove r and ove r again that the manipul ation of intent begins with a com mand given to one self; the com mand is then repeated unt il it becom es the Eagle’s com mand, and then the assemblage poi nt s hifts, accordingl y, the mom ent warriors reach inne r silence. The fact that such a maneuve r is pos sible, he said, is som ething of the most singul ar impo rtance to seers, old and new alike, but for reasons diametrically oppos ed. Know ing about it allow ed the o ld seers to move their assemblage poi nt to inconc eivable dreaming pos itions in the incom mensurable unk now n; for the new seers it means refusing to be food, it means escaping the Eagle by movi ng their assemblage poi nts to a particular dreaming pos ition call ed total freedom . He expl ained that the old seers discove red that it is pos sible to move the assemblage poi nt to the limit of the know n and keep it fixed there in a state of prime height ened awareness. From that pos ition, they saw the feasibility of slow ly shifting their assemblage poi nts permanently to other pos itions beyond that limit?a"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" 315 stupe ndous feat fraugh t with daring but lacking sobr iety, for they coul d never retract the move ment of their assemblage poi nts, or perhaps they never wanted to. Don Juan s aid that adve nturous men, faced with the choi ce of dyi ng in the world of ordinary affairs or dyi ng in unkno wn worlds, will una voi dably choos e the latter, and that the new seers, realizing that their predecessors had chos en merely to change the locale of th eir death, came to understand the futility of it all; the futility of struggl ing to cont rol their fellow men, the futility of assembling other worlds, and, above all, the futility of self - importance. One of the most fortuna te decisions that the new seers m ade, he said, was never to allow their assemblage poi nts to move permanently to any pos ition other than height ened awareness. From that pos ition, they actually resolved their dilemma of futility and found out that the solution is not simply to choos e an al ternate world in which to die, but to choo se total cons cious ness, total freedom . Don Juan com mented that by choos ing total freedom , the new seers unw ittingly cont inue d in the tradition of their predecessors and became the qui ntessence of the death defiers. He expl ained that the new seers discove red that if the assemblage poi nt is made to shift cons tantly to the conf ines of the unknow n, but is made to return to a pos ition at the limit of the know n, then when it is sudde nly released it move s like light ning ac ross the entire cocoon of man, aligni ng all the emanations inside the cocoon at onc e. “The new seers bur n with the force of align ment,” don Juan went on, “with the force of will, which they have turned into the force of intent through a life of impeccabili ty. Intent is the alignm ent of all the amber emanations of awareness, so it is correct to say that total freedom means total awareness.”"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":" 316 “Is that what all of you are goi ng to do, don Juan?” I asked. “We most certainly will, if we have sufficient energy, ” h e replied. “Freedom is the Eagle’s gift to man. Unfortuna tely, very few men unde rstand that all we need, in order to accept such a magni ficent gift, is to have sufficient energy. “If that’s all we need, then, by all means, we must becom e misers of energy. ” After that, don Juan made us enter into a state of nor mal awareness. At dus k, Pablito, Nestor, and I jum ped into the abys s. And don Juan and the nagua l’s party bur ned with the fire from within. They entered into total awareness, for they had sufficient en ergy to accept the mind - bogg ling gift of freedom . Pablito, Nestor, and I didn’ t die at the bot tom of that gor ge and neither did the other appr entices who had jum ped at an earlier time because we never reached it; all of us, unde r the impact of such a treme ndous and incom prehensible act as jum ping to ou r deaths, move d our assemblage poi nts and assembled other worlds. We know now that we were left to remember height ened awareness and to regain the totality of our selves. And we also know that the more we remem ber, the more intense our elation, our wonde ring, but also the greater our doubt s, our turmoil. So far, it is as if we were left onl y to be tantalized by the most far - reaching que stions about the nature and the fate of man, unt il the time when we may have sufficient energy not onl y to verify everything don Juan taught us, but also to accept the Eagle’s gift our selves.
