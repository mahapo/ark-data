[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE ART OF DRE AMIN G By Carlos Castaneda AUTHOR’S NOTE: Over the past twenty years, I have written a series of books about my appr enticeship with a Mexican Yaqui Indi an sorcerer, don Juan Matus. I have expl ained in thos e books that he taught me sorcery but not as we unde rstand sorcery in the cont ext of our daily world: the use of supe rnatural pow ers ove r others, or the calling of spirits through charms, spells, or rituals to produc e supe rnatural effects. For don Juan, sorcery was the act of embodyi ng som e s pecialized theoretical and practical premises about the nature and role of perception in molding the uni verse around us. Follow ing don Juan’s sugge stion, I have refrained from using shamanism, a categor y prope r to anthropol ogy , to classify his know ledge . I have called it all along what he himself called it: sorcery. On examination, how ever, I realized that calling it sorcery obs cures even more the already obs cure phe nom ena he presented to me in his teachings . In anthropol ogi cal works, shamanism is described as a belief system of som e native peopl e of nor thern Asia — prevailing also among certain native North American Indi an tribes — which maintains that an uns een world of ancestral spiritual forces, good and evil, is pervasive around us and that these spiritual forces can be sum mone d or cont rolled through the acts of practitione rs, who are the intermediaries between the natural and supe rnatural realms. Don Juan was inde ed an intermediary between the natural world of everyda y life and an uns een world, which he cal led not the supe rnatural but the second attention. His role as a teacher was to make this conf iguration accessible to me. I have described in my previous work his teaching methods to this effect, as well as the sorcery arts he made me practice, the most im por tant of which is called the art of dreaming. Don Juan cont ende d that our world, which we believe to be uni que and absolute, is only one in a cluster of cons ecutive worlds, arrange d like the layers of an oni on. He asserted that even though we have been e nergetically condi tione d to perceive solely our world, we still have the capability of entering into thos e other realms, which are as real, uni que , absolute, and engul fing as our ow n world is. Don Juan expl ained to me that, for us to perceive thos e other r ealms, not onl y do we have to cove t them but we need to have sufficient energy to seize them. Their existence is cons tant and inde pende nt of our awareness, he said, but their inaccessibility is entirely a cons eque nce of our energetic condi tioni ng. In other words, simply and solely because of that condi tioni ng, we are com pelled to assum e that the world of daily life is the one and onl y pos sible world. Believing that our energetic condi tioni ng is correctable, don Juan stated that sorcerers of ancient times de velope d a set of practices designe d to recondi tion our energetic capabilities to perceive. They called this set of practices the art of dreaming."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 With the perspective time gives, I now realize that the most fitting statement don Juan made about dreaming wa s to call it the “gateway to infinity.” I remarked, at the time he said it, that the metaphor had no meaning to me. “Let’s then do away with metaphor s,” he conc eded. “Let’s say that dreaming is the sorcerers’ practical way of put ting ordinary dreams to use .” “But how can ordinary dreams be put to use?” I asked. “We always get tricked by words,” he said. “In my ow n case, my teacher attempted to describe dreaming to me by saying that it is the way sorcerers say good night to the world. He was, of cour se, tail oring his description to fit my mentality. I’m doi ng the same with you. ” On anot her occasion don Juan said to me, “Dreaming can onl y be expe rienced. Dreaming is not just having dreams; neither is it daydr eaming or wishing or imagining. Through dreaming we can perceive other worlds, which we can certainly describe, but we can’t describe what makes us perceive them. Yet we can feel how dreaming ope ns up thos e other realms. Dreaming seems to be a sensation — a process in our bodi es, an awareness in our minds .” I n the cour se of his general teachings , don Juan thoroughl y expl ained to me the principles, rationa les, and practices of the art of dreaming. His instruction was divided into two parts.. One was about dreaming procedur es, the other about the pur ely abstract expl anations of these procedur es. His teaching method was an interplay between enticing my intellectual curiosity with the abstract principles of dreaming and gui ding me to seek an out let in its practices. I have already described all this in as much deta il as I was able to. And I have also described the sorcerers’ milieu in which don Juan placed me in order to teach me his arts. My interaction in this milieu was of special interest to me because it took place exclusively in the second attention. I interac ted there with the ten wom en and five men who were don Juan’s sorcerer com panions and with the four young men and the four young wom en who were his appr entices. Don Juan gathered them immediately after I came into his world. He made it clear to me that the y formed a traditiona l sorcerers’ group — a replica of his ow n party — and that I was suppos ed to lead them. How ever, working with me he realized that I was different than he expe cted. He expl ained that difference in terms of an energy conf iguration seen onl y by sorcerers: instead of having four com partments of energy, as he himself had, I had onl y three. Such a conf igur ation, which he had mistakenly hope d was a correctable flaw, made me so com pletely inadequa te for interacting with or leading thos e eight appr e ntices that it became imperative for don Juan to gather anot her group of peopl e more akin to my energetic structure. I have written extensively about thos e events. Yet I have never mentione d the second group of appr entices; don Juan did not permit me to do so. He argue d that they were exclusively in my field and that the agreement I had with him was to write about his field, not mine."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 The second group of appr entices was extremely compact. It had onl y three members: a dreamer, Florinda Donne r - Grau; a stalker , Taisha Abelar; and a nagua l wom an, Carol Tiggs . We interacted with one anot her solely in the second attention. In the world of everyda y life, we did not have even a vague not ion of one another. In terms of our relations hip with don Juan, how ever, there w as no vague ness; he put enor mous effort into training all of us equa lly. Nevertheless, tow ard the end, when don Juan’s time was about to finish, the psychol ogi cal pressure of his departure started to collapse the rigid bounda ries of the second attention. The result was that our interaction began to lapse into the world of everyda y affairs, and we met, seemingl y for the first time. None of us, cons cious ly, kne w about our deep and arduous interaction in the second attention. Since all of us were invo lved in academic studi es, we ende d up more than shoc ked when we found out we had met before. This was and still is, of cour se, intellectually inadm issible to us, yet we know that it was thor oughl y within our expe rience. We have been left, therefore, with the disqu ieting know ledge that the human psyche is infinitely more com plex than our munda ne or academic reasoni ng had led us to believe. Once we asked don Juan, in unison, to shed light on our predicament. He said that he had two expl anatory opt ions . One was to cat er to our hurt rationa lity and patch it up, saying that the second attention is a state of awareness as illusory as elepha nts flying in the sky and that everything we thought we had expe rienced in that state was simply a produc t of hypnot ic sugge stions . Th e other opt ion was to expl ain it the way sorcerer dreamers unde rstand it: as an energetic conf igur ation of aware ness. During the fulfillment of my dreaming tasks, how ever, the barrier of the second attention remained unc hange d. Every time I entered into d reaming, I also entered into the second attention, and waking up from dreaming did not necessarily mean I had left the second attention. For years I coul d remember onl y bits of my dreaming expe riences. The bul k of what I did was energetically una vailable t o me. It took me fifteen years of uni nterrupt ed work, from 1973 to 1988, to store enough energy to rearrange everything linearly in my mind. I remembered then seque nces upon seque nces of dreaming events, and I was able to fill in, at last, som e seeming lap ses of memory. In this manne r I captured the inhe rent cont inui ty of don Juan’s lessons in the art of dreaming, a cont inuity that had been lost to me because of his making me weave between the awareness of our everyda y life and the awareness of the second a ttention. This work is a result of that rearrange ment. All this brings me to the final part of my statement: the reason for writing this book. Being in pos session of most of the pieces of don Juan’s lessons in the art of dreaming, I woul d like to expl ain, in a future work, the current pos ition and interest of his last four stude nts: Florinda Donne r - Grau, Taisha Abelar, Carol Tiggs , and myself. But before I describe and expl ain the results of don Juan’s gui dance and influence on us, I must review, in light o f what I know now , the parts of don Juan’s lessons in dreaming to which I did not have access before."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 The definitive reason for this work, how ever, was given by Carol Tiggs . Her belief is that expl aining the world that don Juan made us inhe rit is the ultim ate expr ession of our gratitude to him and our com mitment to his que st. CHAPTER 1 SORCERERS OF ANTIQUITY: AN INTRODUCTION on Juan stressed, time and time again, that every thing he was teaching me had been envi sione d and worked out by men he referred to as sorcerers of antiqui ty. He made it very clear that there was a profound distinction between thos e sorcerers and the sorcerers of mode m times. He categor ized sorcerers of antiquity as men who existed in Mexico perhaps thous ands of years before the Spani sh Conque st, men whos e greatest accom plishm ent had been to bui ld the structures of sorcery, empha sizing practicality and conc reteness. He rende red them as men who were brilliant but lacking in wisdom . Mode m sorcerers, by cont rast, don Juan portrayed as men renow ned for their sound minds and their capacity to rectify the cour se of sorcery if they deemed it necessary. Don Juan expl ained to me that the sorcery premises pertinent to dreaming were naturally envi sione d and develope d by sorcerers of antiqui ty Out of necessity — for thos e premises are key in expl aining and unde rstandi ng dreaming — I again have to write about and discuss them. The major part of this book is, therefore, a reintroduc tion and amplification of what I have presented in my previous works. Duri ng one of our conve rsations , don Juan stated that, in order to appr eciate the pos ition of dreamers and dreaming, one has to unde rstand the struggl e of mode rn - day sorcerers to steer sorcery away from conc reteness tow ard the abstract. “What do you call conc r eteness, don Juan?” I asked. “The practical part of sorcery,” he said. “The obs essive fixation of the mind on practices and techni que s, the unw arranted influence ove r peopl e. All of these were in the realm of the sorcerers of the past.” “And what do you ca ll the abstract?” “The search for freedom , freedom to perceive, without obs essions , all that’s hum anly pos sible. I say that present - day sorcerers seek the abstract because they seek freedom ; they have no interest in conc rete gains. There are no social func tions for them, as there were for the sorcerers of the past. So you’ ll never catch them being the official seers or the sorcerers in residence.” “Do you mean, don Juan, that the past has no value to mode rn - day sorcerers?” “It certainly has value. It’s the taste of that past which we don’ t like. I persona lly detest the darkne ss and morbidity of the mind. I like the immensity of thought . How ever,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 regardless of my likes and dislikes, I have to give due credit to the sorcerers of antiqui ty, for they were the fi rst to find out and do every thing we know and do toda y. Don Juan expl ained that their most important attainm ent was to perceive the energetic essence of things . This insight was of such importance that it was turned into the basic premise of sorcery. Nowa days, after lifelong discipline and training, sorcerers do acqui re the capacity to perceive the essence of things , a capacity they call seeing. “What woul d it mean to me to perceive the energetic essence of things ?” I onc e asked don Juan. “It woul d mean th at you perceive energy directly,” he replied. “By separating the social part of perception, you’ ll perceive the essence of everything. Whatever we are perceiving is energy, but since we can’t directly perceive energy we process our perception to fit a mold . This mold is the social part of perception, which you have to separate.” “Why do I have to separate it?” “Because it deliberately reduc es the scope of what can be perceived and makes us believe that the mold into which we fit our perception is all that e xists. I am convi nced that for man to survive now , his perception must change at its social base.” “What is this social base of perception, don Juan?” “The phys ical certainty that the world is made of conc rete obj ects. I call this a social base because a s erious and fierce effort is put out by everybody to gui de us to perceive the world the way we do. ” “How then shoul d we perceive the world?” “Everything is energy. The whol e universe is energy. The social base of our perception shoul d be the phys ical certai nty that energy is all there is. A might y effort shoul d be made to gui de us to perceive energy as energy. Then we woul d have bot h alternatives at our finge rtips.” “Is it pos sible to train peopl e in such a fashion? ” I asked. Don Juan replied that it was pos sible and that this was precisely what he was doi ng with me and his other appr entices. He was teaching us a new way of perceiving, first, by making us realize we process our perception to fit a mold and, second, by fiercely gui ding us to perceive energy di rectly. He assured me that this method was very much like the one used to teach us to perceive the world of daily affairs. Don Juan’s conc eption was that our entrapm ent in process mg our perception to fit a social mold loses its pow er when we realize we ha ve accepted this mold, as an inhe ritance from our ancestors, without bot hering to examine it. “To perceive a world of hard obj ects that had either a pos itive or a negative value must have been utterly necessary for our ancestors’ survival,” don Juan said. “After ages of perceiving in such a manne r, we are now forced to believe that the world is made up of obj ects.”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 “I can’t conc eive the world in any other way, don Juan,” I com plained. “It is unque stiona bly a world of obj ects. To prove it, all we have to do is bum p into them.” “Of cour se it’s a world of obj ects. We are not arguing that.” “What are you saying then?” “I am saying that this is first a world of energy; then it’s a world of obj ects. If we don’ t start with the premise that it is a world of energy, we’ll never be able to perceive energy directly. We’ll always be stoppe d by the phys ical certainty of what you’ ve just poi nted out : the hardne ss of obj ects.” His argum ent was extremely mystifying to me. In thos e days, my mind woul d simply refuse to cons ide r any way to unde rstand the world except the one with which I was familiar. Don Juan’s claims and the poi nts he struggled to raise were out landi sh propos itions that I coul d not accept but coul d not refuse either. “Our way of perceiving is a predator’s way, ” he said to me on one occasion. “A very efficient manne r of appraising and classifying food and dange r. But this is not the onl y way we are able to perceive. There is anot her mode, the one I am familiarizing you with: the act of perceiving the essence of everything, energy itself, directly. “To perceive the essence of everything will make us unde r stand, classify and describe the world in entirely new, more exciting, more sophi sticated terms.” This was don Juan’s claim. And the more sophi sticated terms to which he was alludi ng were thos e he had been taught by his predecessors, terms that correspond to sorcery truths, which have no rationa l founda tion and no relation whatsoever to the facts of our daily world but which are self - evident truths for the sorcere rs who perceive energy directly and see the essence of everything. For such sorcerers, the most signi ficant act of sorcery is to see the essence of the uni verse. Don Juan’s version was that the sorcerers of antiqui ty, the first one s to see the essence of t he uni verse, described it in the best manne r. They said that the essence of the uni verse resembles incande scent threads stretched into infinity in every conc eivable direction, luminous filaments that are cons cious of themselves in ways impos sible for the h um an mind to com prehend. From seeing the essence of the universe, the sorcerers of antiqui ty went on to see the energy essence of hum an beings . Don Juan stated that they depicted hum an beings as bright shapes that resembled giant eggs and called them lum in ous eggs . “When sorcerers see a hum an being, ” don Juan said, “they see a giant, lum inous shape that floats, making, as it move s, a deep furrow in the energy of the earth, just as if the lum inous shape had a taproot that was draggi ng.” Don Juan had the impr ession that our energy shape keeps on changi ng through time. He said that every seer he kne w, him self include d, saw that hum an beings are shaped more like balls or even tom bstone s than eggs . But, onc e in a while, and for no reason know n to them, sorcerers see a person whos e energy is shaped like an egg. Don Juan sugge sted that peopl e who are eggl ike in shape toda y are more akin to peopl e of ancient times."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 In the cour se of his teachings , don Juan repeatedly discussed and expl ained what he cons idered the dec isive findi ng of the sorcerers of antiqui ty. He called it the crucial feature of hum an beings as lum inous balls: a round spot of intense brilliance, the size of a tenni s ball, permanently lodge d inside the lum inou s ball, flush with its surface, about two f eet back from the crest of a person’ s right shoul der blade. Since I had troubl e visualizing this the first time don Juan described it to me, he expl ained that the lum inous ball is much larger than the hum an body , that the spot of intense brilliance is part of this ball of energy and that it is located on a place at the height of the shoul der blades, an arm’s lengt h from a per son’ s back. He said that the old sorcerers named it the assemblage poi nt after seeing what it doe s. “What doe s the assemblage poi nt d o?” I asked. “It makes us perceive,” he replied. “The old sorcerers saw that, in hum an beings , perception is assembled there, on that poi nt. Seeing that all living beings have such a poi nt of brilliance, the old sorcerers surmised that perception in genera l must take place on that spot , in whatever pertinent manne r.” “What did the old sorcerers see that made them conclude that perception takes place on the assemblage poi nt?” I asked. He answered that, first, they saw that out of the millions of the uni verse ’s lum inous energy filaments passing through the entire lum inous ball, onl y a small num ber pass directly through the assemblage poi nt, as shoul d be expe cted since it is small in com parison with the whol e. Next, they saw that a sphe rical extra glow , slight l y bigge r than the assemblage poi nt, always surrounds it, greatly intensifying the lum inosity of the filaments passing directly through that glow . Finally, they saw two things . One, that the assemblage poi nts of hum an beings can dislodge themselves from the spot where they are usually located. And, two, that when the assemblage poi nt is on its habitual pos ition, perception and awareness seem to be nor mal, judg ing by the nor mal behavior of the subj ects being obs erved. But when their assemblage poi nts and surr oundi ng glow ing sphe res are on a different pos ition than the habitual one , their unus ual behavior seems to be the proof that their awareness is different, that they are perceiving in an unf amiliar manne r. The conc lusion the old sorcerers drew from all this was that the greater the displacement of the assemblage poi nt from its custom ary pos ition, the more unus ual the cons eque nt behavior and, evidently, the cons eque nt awareness and perception. “Notice that when I talk about seeing, I always say ‘having the ap pearance of’ or ‘seemed like,” don Juan warned me. “Everything one sees is so uni que that there is no way to talk about it except by com paring it to som ething know n to us.” He said that the most adequa te example of this difficulty was the way sorcerers tal k about the assemblage poi nt and the glow that surrounds it. They describe them as bright ness, yet it can not be bright ness, because seers see them without their eyes. They have to fill out the difference, how ever, and say that the assemblage poi nt is a sp ot of light and that around it there is a halo, a glow . Don Juan poi nted out that we are so visual, so ruled by"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 our predator’s perception, that everything we see must be rende red in terms of what the predator’s eye nor mally sees. After seeing what the asse mblage poi nt and its surroundi ng glow seemed to be doi ng, don Juan said that the old sorcerers adva nced an expl anation. They propos ed that in hum an beings the assemblage poi nt, by focusing its glow ing sphe re on the universe’s filaments of energy that pass directly through it, autom atically and without premeditation assembles thos e filaments into a steady perception of the world. “How are thos e filaments you talk about assembled into a steady perception of the world?” I asked. “No one can pos sibly know that, ” he empha tically replied. “Sorcerers see the move ment of energy, but just seeing the move ment of energy cannot tell them how or why energy move s.” Don Juan stated that, seeing that millions of cons cious energy filaments pass through the assemblage poi nt, the old sorcerers pos tulated that in passing through it they com e toge ther, amassed by the glow that surrounds it. After seeing that the glow is extremely dim in peopl e who have been rende red unc ons cious or are about to die, and that it is totally absent f rom corpses, they were convi nced that this glow is awareness. “How about the assemblage poi nt? Is it absent from a corpse?” I asked. He answered that there is no trace of an assemblage poi nt on a dead being, because the assemblage poi nt and its surroundi ng glow are the mark of life and cons cious ness. The inescapable conc lusion of the sorcerers of antiquity was that awareness and perception go toge ther and are tied to the assemblage poi nt and the glow that surrounds it. “Is there a chance that those sorcerer s might have been mistaken about their seeing? ” I asked. “I can’t expl ain to you why, but there is no way sorcerers can be mistaken about their seeing, ” don Juan said, in a tone that adm itted no argum ent. “Now , the conc lusions they arrive at from their see ing might be wrong, but that woul d be because they are naive, unc ultivated. In order to avoi d this disaster, sorcerers have to cultivate their minds , in whatever form they can.” He softened up then and remarked that it certainly woul d be infinitely safer f or sorcerers to remain solely at the level of describing what they see, but that the temptation to conc lude and expl ain, even if onl y to one self, is far too great to resist. The effect of the assemblage poi nt’s displacement was anot her energy conf igur ation the sorcerers of antiqui ty were able to see and study. Don Juan said that when the assemblage poi nt is displaced to anot her pos ition, a new congl om erate of millions of lum inous energy filaments com e toge ther on that• poi nt. The sorcerers of antiqui ty saw this and conc lude d that since the glow of awareness is always present wherever the assemblage poi nt is, perception is autom atically assembled there. Because of the different pos ition of the assemblage poi nt, the resulting world, how ever, cannot be our worl d of daily affairs. Don Juan expl ained that the old sorcerers were capable of distingui shing two type s of assemblage poi nt displacement. One was a displacement to any pos ition on the surface or in the interior of the lum inous ball; this displacement they c alled a shift of the assemblage"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 poi nt. The other was a displacement to a pos ition outside the lum inous ball; they called this displacement a move ment of the assemblage poi nt. They found out that the difference between a shift and a move ment was the nature of the perception each allow s. Since the shifts of the assemblage poi nt are displacements within the lum inous ball, the worlds enge nde red by them, no matter how bizarre or wond rous or unbe lievable they might be, are still worlds within the hum an dom ain. Th e hum an dom ain is the energy filaments that pass through the entire lum inous ball. By cont rast, move ments of the assemblage poi nt since they are displacements to pos itions out side the lum inous ball, enga ge filaments of energy that are beyond the human real m. Perceiving such filaments enge nde rs worlds that are beyond com prehension, inconc eivable worlds with no trace of hum an antecedents in them. The probl em of validation always played a key role in my mind in thos e days. “Forgive me, don Juan,” I said to him on one occasion, “but this bus iness of the assemblage poi nt is an idea so farfetched, so inadm issible that I don ’t know how to deal with it or what to think of it.” “There is onl y one thing for you to do, ” he retorted. “See the assemblage poi nt! It isn’t that difficult to see. The difficulty is in breaking the retaining wall we all have in our minds that hol ds us in place. To break it, all we need is energy. Once we have energy, seeing happe ns to us by itself. The trick is in abandoni ng our fort of self - co mplacency and false security “It is obvi ous to me, don Juan, that it takes a lot of know ledge to see. It isn’t just a matter of having energy.” “It is just a matter of having energy, believe me. The hard part is convi ncing you rself that it can be done . For this, you need to trust the nagua l. The marvel of sorcery is that every sorcerer has to prove everything with his ow n expe rience. I am telling you about the principles of sorcery not with the hope that you will memorize them but with the hope that you wil l practice them.” Don Juan was certainly right about the need for trusting. In the beginni ng stages of my thirteen - year appr enticeship with him, the hardest thing for me was to affiliate myself with his world and his person. This affiliating meant that I h ad to learn to trust him implicitly and accept him without bias as the nagual. Don Juan’s total role in the sorcerers’ world was synt hesized in the title accorded to him by his peers; he was called the nagua l. It was expl ained to me that this conc ept refer s to any person, male or female, who pos sesses a specific kind of energy conf igur ation, which to a seer appe ars as a doubl e lum inous ball. Seers believe that when one of these peopl e enters into the sorcerers’ world, that extra load of energy is turned int o a measure of strengt h and the capacity for leader ship. Thus , the nagua l is the natural gui de, the leader of a party of sorcerers. At first, to feel such a trust for don Juan was qui te disturbing to me, if not altoge ther odi ous . When I discussed it with him, he assured me that to trust his teacher in such a manne r had been just as difficult for him."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 “I told my teacher the same thing you are saying to me now ,” don Juan said. “He replied that without trusting the nagua l there is no pos sibility of relief and thus no pos sibility of clearing the debris from our lives in order to be free.” Don Juan reiterated how right his teacher had been. And I reiterated my profound disagreement. I told him that being reared in a stifling religious envi ronment had had dreadfu l effects on me, and that his teacher’s statements and his ow n acqui escence to his teacher reminde d me of the obe dience dogm a that I had to learn as a child and that I abhor red. “It sounds like you ’re voi cing a religious belief when you talk about the nagu al,” I said. “You may believe whatever you want,” don Juan replied unda unt ed1y. “The fact remains, there is no game without the nagua l. I know this and I say so. And so did all the nagua ls who preceded me. But they didn’ t say it from the standpoi nt of self - importance, and neither do I. TO say there is no path with out the nagua l is to refer totally to the fact that the man, the nagua l, is a nagua l because he can reflect the abstract, the spirit, better than others. But that’s all. Our link is with the spiri t itself and only incidentally with the man who brings us its message.” I did learn to trust don Juan implicitly as the nagua l, and this, as he had stated it, brought me an immense sense of relief and a greater capacity to accept what he was striving to te ach me. In his teachings , he put a great empha sis on expl aining and discussing the assemblage poi nt. I asked him onc e if the assemblage poi nt had anyt hing to do with the phys ical body. “It has not hing to do with what we nor mally perceive as the body, ” he s aid. “It’s part of the lum inous egg, which is our energy self.” “How is it displaced?” I asked. “Through energy currents. Jolts of energy, originating out side or inside our energy shape. These are usually unpr edictable currents that happen random ly, but wi th sorcerers they are very predictable currents that obe y the sorcerer’s intent.” “Can you your self feel these currents?” “Every sorcerer feels them. Every hum an being does, for that matter, but average hum an beings are too bus y with their ow n pur suits to pay any attention to feelings like that.” “What do thos e currents feel like?” “Like a mild discom fort, a vague sensation of sadne ss follow ed immediately by euphor ia. Since neither the sadne ss nor the euphor ia has an expl ainable cause, we never regard them as veritable ons laught s of the unknow n but as une xpl ainable, ‘ill founde d moodi ness.” “What happe ns when the assemblage poi nt move s out side the energy shape? Does it hang out side? Or is it attached to the lum inous ball?” “It pus hes the cont our s of the ene rgy shape out , without breaking its energy bounda ries.”"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 Don Juan expl ained that the end result of a move ment of the assemblage poi nt is a total change in the energy shape of a hum an being. Instead of a ball or an egg, he becom es som e thing resembling a smo king pipe. The tip of the stem is the assemblage, poi nt, and the bow l of the pipe is what remains of the lum inous ball. If the assemblage poi nt keeps on movi ng, a mom ent com es when the lum inous ball becom es a thin line of energy Don Juan went on to expl ain that the old sorcerers were the onl y one s who accom plished this feat of energy shape transformation. And I asked him whether in their new energetic shape thos e sorcerers were still men. “Of cour se they were still men,” he said. “But I think what you want to know is if they were still men of reason, trustworthy persons . Well, not qui te.” “In what way were they different?” “In their conc erns. Hum an ende avor s and preoccupa tions had no meaning whatsoever to them. They also had a definite new appe arance.” “Do y ou mean that they didn’ t look like men?” “It’s very hard to tell what was what about thos e sorcerers. They certainly looke d like men. What else woul d they look like? But they were not qui te like what you or I woul d expe ct. Yet if you pressed me to tell in what way they were different, I woul d go in circles, like a dog chasing its tail.” “Have you ever met one of thos e men, don Juan?” “Yes, I have met one .” “What did he look like?” “As far as looks , he looke d like a regul ar person. Now , it was his behavior t hat was unus ual.” “In what way was it unus ual?” “All I can tell you is that the behavior of the sorcerer I met is som ething that defies the imagination. But to make it a matter of merely behavior is misleading. It is really som ething ‘you must see to appr e ciate.” “Were all thos e sorcerers like the one you met?” “Certainly not . I don ’t know how the others were, except through sorcerers’ stories hande d dow n from generation to generation. And thos e stories por tray them as being qui te bizarre.” “Do you mean mon strous ?” “Not at all. They say that they were very likable but extremely scary They were more like unknow n creatures. What makes manki nd hom oge neous is the fact that we are all lum inous balls. And thos e sorcerers were no longe r balls of energy but lines of energy that were trying to bend themselves into circles, which they coul dn’ t qui te make.” “What finally happe ned to them, don Juan? Did they die?”"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 “Sorcerers’ stories say that because they had succeeded in stretching their shapes, they had also succeeded in stretching the dur ation of their cons cious ness. So they are alive and cons cious to this day. There are stories about their periodi c appe arances on the earth.” “What do you think of all this you rself, don Juan?” “It is too bizarre for me. I want freedom . Freedom to retain my awareness and yet disappe ar into the vastness. In my persona l opi nion, thos e old sorcerers were extravagant, obs essive, capricious men who got pinne d dow n by their ow n machinations . “But don’ t let my persona l feelings sway you. The ol d sorcerers’ accom plishm ent is unpa ralleled. If not hing else, they prove d to us that man’s pot entials are nothing to sneeze at.” Anot her topi c of don Juan’s expl anations was the indi spensability of energetic uni formity and cohe sion for the pur pos e of perce iving. His contention was that manki nd perceives the world we know , in the terms we do, onl y because we share energetic uni formity and cohe sion. He said that we autom atically attain these two condi tions of energy in the cour se of our rearing and that they are so taken for granted we do not realize their vital impor tance unt il we are faced with the pos sibility of perceiving worlds other than the world we know . At thos e mom ents, it becom es evident that we need a new appr opr iate energetic uni formity and cohe si on to perceive coherently and totally. I asked him what uni formity and cohe sion were, and he expl ained that man’s energetic shape has uni formity in the sense that every human being on earth has the form of a ball or an egg. And the fact that man’s energy h olds itself toge ther as a ball or an egg prove s it has cohe sion. He said that an example of a new uni formity and cohe sion was the old sorcerers’ energetic shape when it became a line: every one of them uni formly became a line and cohe sively remained a line . Uniformity and cohe sion at a line level permitted thos e old sorcerers to perceive a hom oge neous new world. “How are uni formity and cohe sion acqui red?” I asked. “The key is the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt, or rather the fixation of the assemblage poi nt,” he said. He did not want to elabor ate any further at that time, so I asked him if thos e old sorcerers coul d have reverted to being eggl ike. He replied that at one poi nt they coul d have, but that they did not . And then the line cohe sion set in and made it impos sible for them to go back. He believed that what really crystallized that line cohe sion and prevented them from making the journey back was a matter of choi ce and greed. The scope of what thos e sorcerers were able to perceive and do as lines of en ergy was astronom ically greater than what an aver age man or any average sorcerer can do or perceive. He expl ained that the hum an dom ain when one is an energy ball is whatever energy filaments pass through the space within the ball’s bounda ries. Normally, we perceive not all the hum an dom ain but perhaps onl y one thous andt h of it. He was of the opi nion that, if we take this into cons ideration, the enormity of what the old sorcerers did becom es appa rent; they extende d themselves into a line a thous and times t he size of a man as an energy ball and perceived all the energy filaments that passed through that line."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 On his insistence, I made giant efforts to unde rstand the new mode l of energy conf igur ation he was out lining for me. Finally, after much poundi ng, I co uld follow the idea of energy filaments inside the lum inous ball and out side it. But if I thought of a multitude of lum inous balls, the mode l broke dow n in my mind. In a multitude of lum inous balls, I reasone d, the energy filaments that are out side one of them will perforce be inside the adjacent one . So in a multitude there coul d not pos sibly be any energy filaments out side any lum inous ball. “To unde rstand all this certainly isn’t an exercise for your reason, ” he replied after carefully listening to my ar gum ents. “I have no way of expl aining what sorcerers mean by filaments inside and out side the hum an shape. When seers see the hum an energy shape, they see one singl e ball of energy. If there is anot her ball next to it, the other ball is seen again as a sin gle ball of energy. The idea of a multitude of lum inous balls com es from you r know ledge of hum an crow ds. In the universe of energy, there are onl y singl e indi vidua ls, alone , surrounde d by the boundl ess. “You must see that for your self!” I argue d with don J uan then that it was poi ntless to tell me to see it for myself when he kne w I coul d not . And he propos ed that I bor row his energy and use it to see. “How can I do that? Borrow your energy. ” “Very simple. I can make you r assemblage poi nt shift to anot her po sition more suitable to perceiving energy directly.” This was the first time, in my memory, that he deliberately talked about som ething he had been doi ng all along: making me enter into som e incom prehensible state of awareness that defied my idea of the wo rld and of myself, a state he called the second attention. So, to make my assemblage poi nt shift to a pos ition more suitable to perceiving energy directly, don Juan slappe d my back, between my shoul der blades, with such a force that he made me lose my brea th. I thought that I must have fainted or that the blow had made me fall asleep. Sudde nly, I was looki ng or I was dreaming I was looki ng at som e thing literally beyond words. Bright strings of light shot out from everyw here, goi ng everyw here, strings of li ght which were like not hing that had ever entered my thought s. When I recove red my breath, or when I woke up, don Juan expe ctantly asked me, “What did you see?” And when, I answered, truthfully, “Your blow made me see stars,” he doubl ed up laughi ng. He rem arked that I was not ready yet to com prehend any unus ual perception I might have had. “I made your assemblage poi nt shift,” he went on, “and for an instant you were dreaming the filaments of the uni verse. But you don’t yet have the discipline or the energy to rearrange your uni formity and cohe sion. The old sorcerers were the cons um mate masters of that rearrangi ng. That was how they saw everything that can be seen by man.” “What doe s it mean to rearrange uni formity and cohesion? ” “It means to enter into the second attention by retaining the assemblage poi nt on its new pos ition and keeping it from sliding back to its original spot .”"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 Don Juan then gave me a traditiona l definition of the second attention. He said that the old sorcerers called the result of fixin g the assemblage poi nt on new pos itions the second attention and that they treated the second attention as an area 9 all - inclusive activity just as the attention of the daily world is. He pointed out that sorcerers really have two com plete areas for their ende avor s: a small one , called the first attention or the awareness of our daily world or the fixation of the assemblage poi nt on its habitual pos ition; and a much larger area, the second attention or the awareness of other worlds or the fixation of the a ssemblage poi nt on each of an enor mous num ber of new pos itions . Don Juan helped me to expe rience inexpl icable things in the second attention by means of what he called a sorcerer’s maneuve r: tappi ng my back gently or forcefully striking it at the height of my shoul der blades. He expl ained that with his blow s he displaced my assemblage poi nt. From my expe riential pos ition, such displacements meant that my awareness used to enter into a most disturbing state of une qua led clarity, a state of supe rcons cious ness , which I enjoye d for shor t periods of time and in which I coul d unde rstand anyt hing with minimal pre ambles. It was not qui te a pleasing state. Most of the time it was like a strange dream, so intense that nor mal awareness paled by com parison. Don Juan ju stified the indispensability of such a maneuve r, saying that in nor mal awareness a sorcerer teaches his appr entices basic conc epts and procedur es and in the second attention he gives them abstract and detailed expl anations . Ordinarily, appr entices do not r emember these expl anations at all, yet they som ehow store them, faithfully intact, in their memories. Sorcerers have used this seeming peculiarity of memory and have turned remembering everything that hap pens to them in the second attention into one of th e most difficult and com plex traditiona l tasks of sorcery. Sorcerers expl ain this seeming peculiarity of memory, and the task of remembering, saying that every time anyone enters into the second attention, the assemblage poi nt is on a different pos ition. T o remember, then, means to relocate the assemblage poi nt on the exact pos ition it occupi ed at the time thos e entrances into the second attention occurred. Don Juan assured me not onl y that sorcerers have total and absolute recall but that they relive every expe rience they had in the second attention by this act of returning their assemblage poi nt to each of thos e specific pos itions. He also assured me that sorcerers dedicate a lifetime to fulfilling this task of remembering. In the second attention, don Jua n gave me very detailed expl anations of sorcery, know ing that the accuracy and fidelity of such instruction will remain with me, faithfully intact, for the dur ation of my life. About this qua lity of faithfulness he said, “Learning som e thing in the second attention is just like learning when we were children. What we learn remains with us for life. ‘It’s second nature with me,’ we say when it com es to som ething we’ve learned very early in life.” Judgi ng from where I stand toda y, I realize that don Juan made me enter, as many times as he coul d, into the second attention in order to force me to sustain, for long periods of"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 time, new pos itions of my assemblage poi nt and to perceive cohe rently in them, that is to say, he aimed at forcing me to rearrange my uni fo rmity and cohe sion. I succeeded count less times in perceiving everything as precisely as I perceive in the daily world. My probl em was my incapacity to make a bridge between my actions in the second attention and my awareness of the daily world. It took a great deal of effort and time for me to unde rstand what the second attention is. Not so much because of its intricacy and com plexity, which are inde ed extreme, but because, onc e I was back in my nor mal awareness, I found it impos sible to remember not onl y that I had entered into the second attention but that such a state existed at all. Anot her monum ental breakthrough that the old sorcerers claimed, and that don Juan carefully expl ained to me, was to find out that the assemblage poi nt becom es very easily di splaced dur ing sleep. This realization trigge red anot her one : that dreams are totally associated with that displacement. The old sorcerers saw that the greater the displacement, the more unus ual the dream or vice versa: the more unus ual the dream, the grea ter the displacement. Don Juan said that this obs ervation led them to devise extravagant techni que s to force the displacement of the assemblage poi nt, such as inge sting plants that can produc e altered states of cons cious ness; subj ecting themselves to state s of hunge r, fatigue , and stress; and especially cont rolling dreams. In this fashion, and perhaps without even know ing it, they created dreaming. One day, as we strolled around the plaza in the city of Oaxaca, don Juan gave me the most cohe rent definition of dreaming from a sorcerer’s standpoi nt. “Sorcerers view dreaming as an extremely sophi sticated art,” he said, “the art of displacing the assemblage poi nt at will from its habitual pos ition in order to enha nce and enlarge the scope of what can be perceive d.” He said that the old sorcerers anchor ed the art of dreaming on five condi tions they saw in the energy flow of hum an beings . One, they saw that only, the energy filaments that pass directly through the assemblage poi nt can be assembled into cohe rent per ception. Two, they saw that if the assemblage poi nt is displaced to anot her pos ition, no matter how minut e the displacement, different and una ccustom ed energy filaments begin to pass through it, enga ging awareness and forcing the assembling of these una ccu stom ed energy fields into a steady, cohe rent perception. Three, they saw that, in the cour se of ordinary dreams, the assemblage poi nt becom es easily displaced by itself to anot her pos ition on the surface or in the interior of the lum inous egg. Four , they s aw that the assemblage poi nt can be made to move to pos itions out side the lum inous egg, into the energy filaments of the uni verse at large. And, five, they saw that through discipline it is pos sible to cultivate and perform, in the cour se Of sleep and ordi nary dreams, a systematic displacement of the assemblage poi nt. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 CHAPTER 2 THE FIRST GATE OF DREAMING As a preamble to his first lesson in dreaming, don Juan talked about the second attention as a progr ession: beginni ng as an idea that com es to us more l ike a curiosity than an actual pos sibility; turning into som ething that can onl y be felt, as a sensation is felt; and finally evol ving into a state of being, or a realm of practicalities, or a preeminent force that ope ns for us worlds beyond our wildest fa ntasies. When expl aining sorcery; sorcerers have two opt ions. One is to speak in metaphor ical terms and talk about a world of magi cal dimensions . The other is to expl ain their bus iness in abstract terms prope r to sorcery. I have always preferred the latte r, although neither opt ion will ever satisfy the rationa l mind of a Western man. Don Juan told me that what he meant by his metaphor ical description of the second attention as a progr ession was that, being a by - pr9duc t of a displacement of the assemblage p oint, the second attention doe s not happe n naturally but must be intende d, beginni ng with intendi ng it as an idea and endi ng up with intendi ng it as a steady and cont rolled awareness of the assemblage poi nt’s displacement. “I am goi ng to teach you the firs t step to pow er,” don Juan said, beginni ng his instruction in the art of dreaming. “I’m goi ng to teach you how to set up dreaming. ” “What doe s it mean to set up dreaming? ” “To set up dreaming means to have a precise and practical com mand ove r the general s ituation of a dream. For example, you may dream that you are in you r classroom . To set up dreaming means that you don’ t let the dream slip into som e thing else. You don’ t jum p from the classroom to the moun tains, for instance. In other words, you cont rol t he view of the classroom and don’ t let it go until you want to.” “But is it pos sible to do that?” “Of cour se it’s pos sible. This cont rol is no different from the cont rol we have ove r any situation in our daily lives. Sorcerers are used to it and get it eve ry time they want or need to. In order to get used to it you rself, you must start by doi ng som e thing very simple. Toni ght , in you r dreams, you must look at your hands .” Not much more was said about this in the awareness of our daily world. In my recollect ion of my expe riences in the second attention, how ever, I found out that we had a more extensive exchange . For instance, I expr essed my feelings about the absurdity of the task, and don Juan sugge sted that I shoul d face it in terms of a que st that was ente rtaining, instead of solemn and morbid. “Get as heavy as you want when we talk about dreaming, ” he said. “Expl anations always call for deep though t. But when you actually dream, be as light as a feather. Dreaming has to be performed with integrity and seri ous ness, but in the midst of laught er and with the conf idence of som eone who doe sn’t have a worry in the world. Only unde r these condi tions can our dreams actually be turned into dreaming. ”"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 Don Juan assured me that he had selected my hands arbitrarily as s om ething to look for in my dreams and that looki ng for anyt hing else was just as valid. The goa l of the exercise was not findi ng a specific thing but enga ging my dreaming attention. Don Juan described the dreaming attention as the cont rol one acqui res ove r one ’s dreams upon fixating the assemblage poi nt on any new position to which it has been displaced dur ing dreams. In more general terms, he called the dreaming attention an incom prehensible facet of awareness that exists by itself, waiting for a mom ent wh en we woul d entice it, a mom ent when we woul d give it pur pos e; it is a veiled faculty that every one of us has in reserve but never has the oppo rtunity to use in everyda y life. My first attempts at looki ng for my hands in my dreams were a fiasco. After mon ths of uns uccessful efforts, I gave up and com plained to don Juan again about the absurdity of such a task. “There are seven gates,” he said as a way of answering, “and dreamers have to ope n all seven of them, one at the time. You’ re up against the first g ate that must be ope ned if you are to dream.” “Why didn’ t you tell me this before?” “It woul d’ve been useless to tell you about the gates of dreaming before you smacked your head against the first one . Now you know that it is an obs tacle and that you have to ove r com e it.” Don Juan - expl ained that there are entrances and exits in the energy flow of the uni verse and that, in the specific case of dreaming, there are seven entrances, expe rienced as obs tacles, which sorcerers call the seven gates of dreaming. “ The first gate is a threshol d we must cross by becom ing aware of a particular sensation before deep sleep,” he said. “A sensation which is like a pleasant heaviness that doe sn’t let us ope n our eyes. We reach that gate the instant we becom e aware that we’r e falling asleep, suspende d in darkne ss and heaviness.” “How do I becom e aware that I am falling asleep? Are there any steps to follow ?” - “No. There are no steps to follow . One just intends to becom e aware of falling asleep.” “But how doe s one intend to b ecom e aware of it?” “Intent or intendi ng is som ething very difficult to talk about . I or anyone else woul d sound idiotic trying to expl ain it. Bear that in mind when you hear what I have to say next: sorcerers intend anyt hing they set themselves to intend, simply by intendi ng it.” “That doe sn’t mean anyt hing, don Juan.” “Pay close attention. Som eday it’ll be you r turn to expl ain. The statement seems nons ensical because you are not put ting it in the prope r cont ext. Like any rationa l man, you think that unde r standi ng is exclusively the realm of our reason, of our mind. “For sorcerers, because the statement I made pertains to intent and intendi ng, unde rstandi ng it pertains to the realm of energy. Sorcerers believe that if one woul d intend that statement for the energy body , the energy body woul d unde rstand it in terms"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 entirely different from thos e of the mind. The trick is to reach the energy body . For that you need energy. ” “In what terms woul d the energy body unde rstand that statement, don Juan?” “In terms of a bodi ly feeling, which it’s hard to describe. You’ ll have to expe rience it to know what I mean.” I wanted a more precise expl anation, but don Juan slappe d my back and made me enter into the second attention. At that time, what he did was still utterly mys terious to me. I coul d have sworn that his touc h hypnot ized me. I believed he had instantaneous ly put me to sleep, and I dreamt that I found myself walking with him on a wide avenue lined with trees in som e unknow n city It was such a vivid dream, and I was so aware of everything, that I immediately tried to orient myself by reading signs and looki ng at peopl e. It definitely was not an Engl ish - or Spanish - speaking city but it was a Western city. The peopl e seemed to be nor thern Europe ans, perhaps Lithua nians . I became absorbed in trying to read billboa rds and street signs . Don Juan nudge d me gently. “Don’ t bot her with that,” he said. “We are now here identifiable. I’ve just lent you my energy so you woul d reach your energy body , and with it you’ ve just crossed into anot her world. This won’ t last long , so use your time wisely. “Look at everything, but without being obvi ous . Don’ t let anyone not ice you .” We walked in silence. It was a block - long walk, which had a remarkable effect on me. The more we walked, the g reater my sensation of visceral anxi ety My mind was curious , but my body was alarmed. I had the clearest unde rstandi ng that I was not in this world. When we got to an intersection and stoppe d walking, I saw that the trees on the street had been carefully t rimmed. They were shor t trees with hard - looki ng, curled leaves. Each tree had a big squa re space for watering. There were no weeds or trash in thos e spaces, as one woul d find around trees in the city, onl y charcoal black, loos e dirt. The mom ent I focused m y eyes on the curb, before I steppe d off it to cross the street, I not iced that there were no cars. I tried desperately to watch the peopl e who milled around us, to discove r som ething about them that woul d expl ain my anxi ety. As I stared at them, they star ed back at me. In one instant a circle of hard blue and brow n eyes had formed around us. A certainty hit me like a blow : this was not a dream at all; we were in a reality beyond what I know to be real. I turned to face don Juan. I was about to realize what was different about thos e peopl e, but a strange dry wind that went directly to my sinus es hit my face, blurred my view, and made me forget what I wanted to tell don Juan. The next instant, I was back where I had started from: don Juan’s hous e. I was lying on a straw mat, curled up on my side. “I lent you my energy, and you reached you r energy body, ” don Juan said matter - of - factly. I heard him talk, but I was num b. An unus ual itching on my solar plexus kept my breaths shor t and painful. I kne w that I had be en on the verge of findi ng som ething"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 transcende ntal about dreaming and about the peopl e I had seen, yet I coul d not bring whatever I kne w into focus. “Where were we, don Juan?” I asked. “Was it all a dream? A hypnot ic state?” “It wasn’t a dream,” he replie d. “It was dreaming. I helped you reach the second attention so that you woul d unde rstand intendi ng as a subj ect not for you r reason but for your energy body. “At this poi nt, you can’t yet com prehend the import of all this, not onl y because you don’ t have sufficient energy but because you’ re not intendi ng anyt hing. If you were, your energy body woul d com prehend immediately that the onl y way to intend is by focusing your intent on whatever you want to intend. This time I focused it for you on reaching your e nergy body .” “Is the goa l of dreaming to intend the energy body ?” I asked, sudde nly empow ered by som e strange reasoni ng. “One can certainly put it that way,” he said. “In this particular instance, since we’re talking about the first gate of dreaming, the g oal of dreaming is to intend that your energy body becom es aware that you are falling asleep. Don’ t try to force you rself to be aware of falling asleep. Let your energy body do it. To intend is to wish withou t wishing, to do without doi ng. “Accept the chal lenge of intendi ng,” he went on. “Put your silent determination, without a singl e thought , into convi ncing your self that you have reached your energy body and that you are a dreamer. Doing this will autom atically put you in the pos ition to be aware that yo u are falling asleep.” “How can I convi nce myself that I am a dreamer when I am not ?” “When you hear that you have to convi nce your self, you autom atically becom e more rationa l. How can you convi nce you rself you are a dreamer when you know you are not ? Inte ndi ng is bot h: the act of convi ncing your self you are inde ed a dreamer, although you have never dreamt before, and the act of being convinced.” “Do you mean I have to tell myself I am a dreamer and try my best to believe it? Is that it?” “No, it isn’t. Int endi ng is much simpler and, at the same time, infinitely more com plex than that. It requi res imagination, discipline, and purpos e. In this case, to intend means that you get an unque stiona ble bodi ly know ledge that you are a dreamer. You feel you are a drea mer with all the cells of your body. ” Don Juan adde d in a joking tone that he did not have sufficient energy to make me anot her loan for intendi ng and that the thing to do was to reach my energy body on my ow n. He assured me that intendi ng the first gate o f dreaming was one of the means discove red by the sorcerers of antiqui ty for reaching the second attention and the energy body. After telling me this, he practically threw me out of his hous e, com mandi ng me not to com e back unt il I had intende d the first g ate of dreaming."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 I returned hom e, and every night for mont hs I went to sleep intendi ng with all my might to becom e aware that I was falling asleep and to see my hands in my dreams. The other part of the task — to convi nce myself that I was a dreamer and that I had reached my energy body — was totally impos sible for me. Then, one afternoon while taking a nap, I dreamt I was looki ng at my hands . The shoc k was enough to wake me up. It prove d to be a uni que dream that coul d not be repeated. Weeks went by, and I was una ble either to becom e aware that I was falling asleep or to find my hands . I began to not ice, how ever, that I was having in my dreams a vague feeling that there was som ething I shoul d have been doi ng but coul d not remember. This feeling became so strong that it kept on waking me up at all hou rs of the night . When I told don Juan about my futile attempts to cross the first gate of dreaming, he gave me som e gui delines. “To ask a dreamer to find a determined item in his dreams is a subt erfuge ,” he said. “Th e real issue is to becom e aware that one is falling asleep. And, strange as it may seem, that doe sn’t happe n by commandi ng one self to be aware that one is falling asleep but by sustaining the sight of whatever one is looki ng at in a dream.” He told me that dreamers take quick, deliberate glances at everything present in a dream. If they focus their dreaming attention on som ething specific, it is onl y as a poi nt of departure. From there, dreamers move on to look at other items in the dream’s cont ent, returni ng to the poi nt of departure as many times as pos sible. After a great effort, I inde ed found hands in my dreams, but they never were mine. They were hands that onl y seemed to belong to me, hands that change d shape, becom ing qui te night marish at times. The rest of my dreams’ cont ent, none theless, was always pleasantly steady. I coul d almost sustain the view of anyt hing I focused my attention on. It went on like this for mont hs, unt il one day when my capacity to dream change d seemingl y by itself. I had done n othing special besides my cons tant earnest determination to be aware that I was falling asleep and to find my hands . I dreamt I was visiting my hom etow n. Not that the tow n I was dreaming about looke d at all like my hom etow n, but som ehow I had the convictio n that it was the place where I was bor n. It all began as an ordinary, yet very vivid dream. Then the light in the dream change d. Images became sharper. The street where I was walking became not iceably more real than a mom ent before. My feet began to hur t. I coul d feel that things were absurdly hard. For instance, on bum ping into a doo r, not onl y did I expe rience pain on the kne e that hit the door but I also was enraged by my clum siness. I realistically walked in that tow n unt il I was com pletely exha usted. I saw everything I coul d have seen had I been a tour ist walking through the streets of a city. And there was no difference whatsoever between that dream walk and any walk I had actually taken on the streets of a city I visited for the first time. “I think you went a bit too far,” don Juan said after listening to my account . “All that was requi red was your awareness of falling asleep. What you’ ve done is equi valent to bringi ng a wall dow n just to squa sh a mosqui to sitting on it.” “Do you mean, don Juan, that I flubbe d it?”"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 “No. But appa rently you ’re trying to repeat som ething you did before. When I made you r assemblage poi nt shift and you and I ende d up in that mysterious city. you were not asleep. You were dreaming, but not asleep, meaning that your assembla ge poi nt didn’ t reach that pos ition through a nor mal dream. I forced it to shift. “You certainly can reach the same pos ition throug h dreaming, but I woul dn’t advi se you to do that at this time.” “Is it dange rous ?” “And how ! Dreaming has to be a very sobe r affair. No false move ment can be afforded. Dreaming is a process of awakening, of gaining control. Our dreaming attention must be systematically exercised, for it is the doo r to the second attention. ” “What’s the difference between the dreaming attention a nd the second attention? ” “The second attention is like an ocean, and the dreaming attention is like a river feeding into it. The second attention is the condi tion of being aware of total worlds, total like our world is total, while the dreaming attention is the condi tion of being aware of the items of our dreams.” He heavily stressed that the dreaming attention is the key to every move ment in the sorcerers’ world. He said that among the multitude of items in our dreams, there exist real energetic interfere nces, things that have been put in our dreams extraneous ly, by an alien force. To be able to find them and follow them is sorcery. The empha sis he put on thos e statements was so pronounc ed that I had to ask him to expl ain them. He hesitated for a mom ent be fore answering. “Dreams are, if not a door , a hatch into other worlds,” he began. “As such, dreams are a two - way street. Our awareness goe s through that hatch into other realms, and thos e other realms send scout s into our dreams.” “What are thos e scout s?” “Energy charges that get mixed with the items of our nor mal dreams. They are bur sts of foreign energy that com e into our dreams, and we interpret them as items familiar or unf amiliar to us.” “I am sorry, don Juan, but I can’t make heads or tails out of you r expl anation. ” “You can’t because you’ re insisting on thinki ng about dreams in terms know n to you: what occurs to us dur ing sleep. And I am insisting on giving you anot her version: a hatch into other realms of perception. Through that hatch, currents of u nfamiliar energy seep in. Then the mind or the brain or whatever takes thos e currents of energy and turns them into parts of our dreams.” He paused, obvi ous ly to give my mind time to take in what he was telling me. “Sorcerers are aware of thos e currents of foreign energy, ” he cont inue d. “They notice them and strive to isolate them from the normal items of their dreams.” “Why do they isolate them, don Juan?”"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 “Because they com e from other realms. If we follow them to their sour ce, they serve us as gui des into areas of such mystery that sorcerers shiver at the mere mention of such a pos sibility.” “How do sorcerers isolate them from the nor mal items of their dreams?” “By the exercise and cont rol of their dreaming attention. At one mom ent, our dreaming attention discove rs them among the items of a dream and focuses on them, then the total dream collapses, leaving onl y the foreign energy” Don Juan refused to expl ain the topi c any further. He went back to discussing my dreaming expe rience and said that, all in all, he had to take my dream as being my first genui ne attempt at dreaming, and that this meant I had succeeded in reaching the first gate of dreaming. During anot her discussion, at a different time, he abrupt ly brough t up the subj ect again. He said, “I’m goi ng to repeat what you must do in your dreams in order to pass the first gate of dreaming. First you must focus your gaze on anyt hing of your choi ce as the starting poi nt. Then shift you r gaze to other items and look at them in brief glances. Focus your gaze on as many things as you can. Remember that if you glance onl y briefly, the images don’ t shift. Then go back to the item you first looke d at.” “What doe s it mean to pass the first gate of dreaming? ” “We reach the first gate of dreaming by becom ing aware th at we are falling asleep, or by having, like you did, a gigantically real dream. Once we reach the gate, we must cross it by being able to sustain the sight of any item of our dreams.” “I can almost look steadily at the items of my dreams, but they dissipa te too qui ckly.” “This is precisely what I am trying to tell you. In order to off set the evanescent qua lity of dreams, sorcerers have devised the use of the starting poi nt item. Every time you isolate it and look at it, you get a surge of energy, so at th e beginni ng don’ t look at too many things in your dreams. Four items will suffice. Later on, you may enlarge the scope unt il you can cove r all you want, but as soon as the images begin to shift and you feel you are losing cont rol, go back to your starting poi nt item and start all ove r again.” “Do you believe that I really reached the first gate of dreaming, don Juan?” “You did, and that’s a lot. You’ ll find out , as you go along, how easy it’ll be to do dreaming now .” I thought don Juan was either exagge rati ng or giving me incentive. But he assured me he was being on the level. “The most astoundi ng thing that happe ns to dreamers,” he said, “is that, on reaching the first gate, they also reach the energy body .” “What exactly is the energy body? ” “It’s the coun terpart of the phys ical body . A ghos tlike conf igur ation made of pur e energy” “But isn’t the phys ical body also made out of energy? ”"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 “Of cour se it is. The difference is that the energy body has onl y appe arance but no mass. Since it’s pur e energy, it can per form acts that are beyond the pos sibilities of the phys ical body. ” “Such as what for example, don Juan?” “Such as transpor ting itself in one instant to the ends of the uni verse. And dreaming is the art of tempering the energy body , of making it supple and cohe rent by gradua lly exercising it. “Through dreaming we conde nse the energy body unt il it’s a uni t capable of perceiving. Its perception, although affected by our nor mal way of perceiving the daily world, is an inde pende nt perception. It has its ow n sph ere.” “What is that sphe re, don Juan?” “Energy; The energy body deals with energy in terms of energy. There are three ways in which it deals with energy in dreaming: it can perceive energy as it flow s, or it can use energy to boos t itself like a rocket int o une xpe cted areas, or it can perceive as we ordinarily perceive the world.” “What doe s it mean to perceive energy as it flow s?” “It means to see. It means that the energy body sees energy directly as a light or as a vibrating current of sorts or as a dist urbance. Or it feels it directly as a jolt or as a sensation that can even be pain.” “What about the other way you talked about , don Juan? The energy body using energy as a boos t.” “Since energy is its sphe re, it is no problem for the energy body to use cu rrents of energy that exist in the uni verse to prope l itself. All it has to do is isolate them, and off it goe s with them.” He stoppe d talking and seemed to be unde cided, as if he wanted to add som ething but was not sure about it. He smiled at me, and, jus t as I was beginni ng to ask him a que stion, he cont inue d his expl anation. “I’ve mentione d to you before that sorcerers isolate in their dreams scout s from other realms,” he said. “Their energy bodi es do that. They recogni ze energy and go for it. But it isn ’t desirable for dreamers to indul ge in searching for scout s. I was reluctant to tell you about it, because of the facility with which one can get swayed by that search.” Don Juan then qui ckly went on to anot her subj ect. He care fully out lined for me an en tire block of practices. At the time, I found that on one level it was all incom prehensible to me, yet on anot her it was perfectly logi cal and und erstanda ble. He reiterated that reaching, with deliberate cont rol, the first gate of dreaming is a way of arri ving at the energy body. But to maintain that gain is predicated on energy alone . Sorcerers get that energy by redeployi ng, in a more intelligent manner, the energy they have and use for perceiving the daily world. When I urged don Juan to expl ain it more clearly, he adde d that we all have a determined qua ntity of basic energy That qua ntity is all the energy we have, and we use all of it for perceiving and dealing with our engul fing world. He repeated various times, to"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 empha size it, that there is no more en ergy for us anyw here and, since our available energy is already enga ged, there is not a singl e bit left in us for any extraordinary perception, such as dreaming. “Where doe s that leave us?” I asked. “It leaves us to scrounge energy for our selves, wherever we can find it,” he replied. Don Juan expl ained that sorcerers have a scroungi ng method. They intelligently redeploy their energy by cutting dow n any thing they cons ider supe rfluous in their lives. They call this method the sorcerers’ way. In essence, the sorcerers’ way, as don Juan put it, is a chain of behavioral choi ces for dealing with the world, choi ces much more intelligent than thos e our proge nitors taught us. These sorcerers’ choi ces are designe d to revamp our lives by altering our basic reactions a bout being alive. “What are thos e basic reactions ?” I asked. “There are two ways of facing our being alive,” he said. “One is to surrende r to it, either by acqui escing to its demands or by fight ing thos e demands . The other is by molding our particular life situation to fit our ow n conf igurations.” “Can we really mold our life situation, don Juan?” “One’s particular life situation can be molded to fit one ’s specifications ,” don Juan insisted. “Dreamers do that. A wild statement? Not really, if you cons ider h ow little we know about our selves.” He said that his interest, as a teacher, was to get me thor oughl y invol ved with the themes of life and being alive; that is to say, with the difference between life, as a cons eque nce of bio logi cal forces, and the act of being alive, as a matter of cogni tion. “When sorcerers talk about molding one ’s life situation, ” don Juan expl ained, “they mean molding the awareness of being alive. Through molding this awareness, we can get enough energy to reach and sustain the energy bod y, and with it we can certainly mold the total direction and cons eque nces of our lives.” Don Juan ende d our conve rsation about dreaming adm oni shing me not merely to think about what he had told me but to turn his conc epts into a viable way of life by a process of repetition. He claimed that everything new in our lives, such as the sorcerers’ conc epts he was teaching me, must be repeated to us to the poi nt of exha ustion before we ope n our selves to it. He poi nted out that repetition is the way our proge nit ors socialized us to func tion in the daily world. As I cont inue d my dreaming practices, I gained the capability of being thoroughl y aware that I was falling asleep as well as the capability of stoppi ng in a dream to examine at will anyt hing that was part o f that dream’s cont ent. To expe rience this was for me no less than miraculous . Don Juan stated that as we tight en the cont rol ove r our dreams, we tighten the mastery ove r our dreaming attention. He was right in saying that the dreaming attention com es into play when it is called, when it is given a pur pos e. Its com ing into play is not really a process, as one woul d"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 nor mally unde rstand a process: an ongoi ng system of ope rations or a series of actions or func tions that bring about an end result. It is rather an awakening. Something dormant becom es sudde nly func tiona l. CHAPTER 3 THE SECOND GATE OF DREAMING I found out by means of my dream practices that a dreaming teacher must create a didactic synt hesis in order to empha size a given point. In essence, what don Juan wanted with my first task was to exercise my dreaming attention by focusing it on the items of my dreams. To this effect he used as a spearhead the idea of being aware of falling asleep. His subt erfuge was to say that the onl y way to be aware of f alling asleep is to examine the elements of one ’s dreams. I realized, almost as soon as I had begun my dreaming practices, that exercising the dreaming attention is the essential poi nt in dreaming. To the mind, how ever, it seems impos sible that one can tra in one self to be aware at the level of dreams. Don Juan said that the active element of such training is persistence, and that the mind and all its rationa l defenses cannot cope with persistence. Soone r or later, he said, the mind’s barriers fall, unde r it s impact, and the dreaming attention bloom s. As I practiced focusing and hol ding my dreaming attention on the items of my dreams, I began to feel a peculiar self - conf idence so remarkable that I sought a com ment from don Juan. “It’s your entering into the s econd attention that gives you that sense of self - assurance,” he said. “This calls for even more sobr iety on you r part. Go slow ly, but don ’t stop, and above all, don ’t talk about it. Just do it!” I told him that in practice I had corroborated what he had a lready told me, that if one takes shor t glances at everything in a dream, the images do not dissolve. I com mented that the difficult part is to break the initial barrier that prevents us from bringing dreams to our cons cious attention. I asked don Juan to give me his opi nion on this matter, for I earnestly believed that this barrier is a psychol ogi cal one created by our socialization, which put s a premium on disregarding dreams. “The barrier is more than socialization, ” he replied. “It’s the first gate of d reaming. Now that you’ ve ove rcom e it, it seems stupi d to you that we can’t stop at will and pay attention to the items of our dreams. That’s a false certainty. The first gate of dreaming has to do with the flow of energy in the uni verse. It’s a natural obs tacle.” Don Juan made me agree then that we woul d talk about dreaming onl y in the second attention and as he saw fit. He encour aged me to practice in the meantime and promised no interference on his part. As I gained proficiency in setting up dreaming, I r epeatedly expe rienced sensations that I deemed of great impor tance, such as the feeling that I was rolling into a ditch just as I"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 was falling asleep. Don Juan never told me that they were nons ensical sensations but let me record them in my not es. I realize now how absurd I must have appe ared to him. Toda y, if I were teaching dreaming, I woul d definitely discour age such a behavior. Don Juan merely made fun of me, calling me a cove rt egom aniac who professed to be fight ing self - impor tance yet kept a meticulous , supe rpersona l diary called “My Dreams.” Every time he had an oppor tuni ty don Juan poi nted out that the energy needed to release our dreaming attention from its socialization prison com es from redeployi ng our existing energy. Nothing coul d have been truer . The emergence of our dreaming attention is a direct corollary of revamping our lives. Since we have, as don Juan said, no way to plug into any external sour ce for a boos t of energy, we must redeploy our existing energy, by any means available. Don Juan i nsisted that the sorcerers’ way is the best means to oil, so to speak, the wheels of energy redeploym ent, and that of all the items in the sorcerers’ way, the most effective is “losing self - impor tance.” He was thor oughl y convi nced that this is indi spensabl e for everything sorcerers do, and for this reason he put an enor mous empha sis on gui ding all his stude nts to fulfill this requi rement. He was of the opi nion that self - impor tance is not onl y the sorcerers’ supr eme enemy but the nemesis of manki nd. Don Juan ’s argum ent was that most of our energy goe s into uphol ding our importance. This is most obvi ous in our endl ess worry about the presentation of the self, about whether or not we are adm ired or liked or acknow ledge d. He reasone d that if we were capable of l osing som e of that impor tance, two extraordinary things woul d happe n to us. One, we woul d free our energy from trying to maintain the illusory idea of our grande ur; and, two, we woul d provi de ourselves with enough energy to enter into the second attention to catch a glimpse of the actual grande ur of the uni verse. It took me more than two years to be able to focus my unw avering dreaming attention on anyt hing I wanted. And I became SO proficient that I felt as if I had been doing it all my life. The eeriest p art was that I coul d not conc eive of not having had that ability Yet I coul d remember how difficult it had been even to think of this as a pos sibility. It occurred to me that the capability of examining the cont ents of one ’s dreams must be the produc t of a natural conf igur ation of our being, similar per haps to our capability of walking. We are phys ically condi tione d to walk onl y in one manne r, bipedally, yet it takes a monum ental effort for us to learn to walk. This new capacity of looki ng in glances at th e items of my dreams was coupl ed with a most insistent naggi ng to remind myself to look at the elements of my dreams. I kne w about my com pul sive bent of character, but in my dreams my com pul siveness was vastly augm ented. It became so not iceable that not on ly did I resent hearing my naggi ng at myself but I also began to que stion whether it was really my com pul siveness or som ething else. I even thought I was losing my mind. “I talk to myself endl essly in my dreams, remindi ng myself to look at things ,” I said to don Juan. I had all along respected our agreement that we would talk about dreaming onl y when he brought up the subj ect. How ever, I thought that this was an emergency. “Does it sound to you like it’s not you but som eone else?” he asked."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 “Com e to think of it, yes. I don’ t sound like myself at thos e times.” “Then it’s not you. It’s not time yet to expl ain it. But let’s say that we are not alone in this world. Let’s say that there are other worlds available to dreamers, total worlds. From thos e other total worlds, energetic entities som etimes com e to us. The next time you hear your self naggi ng at your self in your dreams, get really angr y and yell a com mand. Say, Stop it!” I entered into anot her challengi ng arena: to remember in my dreams to shout that com ma nd. I believe that, perhaps, out of being so tremendous ly annoye d at hearing myself naggi ng, I did remember to shout , Stop it. The naggi ng ceased instantly and never again was repeated. “Does every dreamer expe rience this?” I asked don Juan when I saw him again. “Som e do, ” he answered, uni nterestedly. I began to rant about how strange it had all been. He cut me off, saying, “You are ready now to get to the second gate of dreaming. ” I seized the oppor tuni ty to seek answers for que stions I had not been able t o ask him. What I had expe rienced the first time he made me dream had been foremost in my mind. I told don Juan that I had obs erved the elements of my ow n dreams to my heart’s cont ent, and never had I felt anyt hing even vague ly similar in terms of clarity and detail. “The more I think about it,” I said, “the more intrigui ng it becom es. Watching thos e peopl e in that dream, I expe rienced a fear and revulsion impos sible to forget. What was that feeling, don Juan?” “In my opi nion, your energy body hooke d ont o t he foreign energy of that place and had the time of its life. Naturally, you felt afraid and revol ted; you were examining alien energy for the first time in you r life. “You have a proclivity for behaving like the sorcerers of antiqui ty. The mom ent you have the chance, you let your assemblage poi nt go. That time you r assemblage poi nt shifted qui te a distance. The result was that you, like the old sorcerers, journeyed beyond the world we know . A most real but dange rous jour ney.” I bypa ssed the meaning of his statements in favor of my ow n interest and asked him, “Was that city perhaps on anot her planet?” “You can’t expl ain dreaming by way of things you know or suspect you know ,” he said. “All I can tell you is that the city you visited was not in this world.” “ Where was it, then?” “Out of this world, of cour se. You’ re not that stupi d. That was the first thing you not iced. What got you goi ng in circles is that you can’t imagine anyt hing being out of this world.” “Where is out of this world, don Juan?” “Believe me , the most extravagant feature of sorcery is that conf igur ation called out of this world. For instance, you assum ed that I was seeing the same things you did. The proof is that you never asked me what I saw. You and onl y you saw a city and peopl e in"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 that c ity. I didn’ t see anyt hing of the sort. I saw energy. So, out of this world was, for you alone , on that occasion, a city.” “But then, don Juan, it wasn’t a real city It existed onl y for me, in my mind.” “No. That’s not the case. Now you want to reduc e som e thing transcende ntal to som ething munda ne. You can’t do that. That journey was real. You saw it as a city. I saw it as energy. Neither of us is right or wrong. ” “My conf usion com es when you talk about things being real. You said before that we reached a re al place. But if it was real, how can we have two versions of it?” “Very simple. We have two versions because we had, at that time, two different rates of uni formity and cohe sion. I have expl ained to you that thos e two attributes are the key to perceiving. ” “Do you think that I can go back to that particular city?” “You got me there. I don ’t know . Or perhaps I do know but can’t expl ain it. Or perhaps I can expl ain it but I don’ t want to. You’ ll have to wait and figure out for your self which is the case.” He refused any further discussion. “Let’s get on with our bus iness,” he said. “You reach the second gate of dreaming when you wake up from a dream into anot her dream. You can have as many dreams as you want or as many as you are capable of, but you must exer cise adequa te cont rol and not wake up in the world we know .” I had a jolt of panic. “Are you saying that I shoul d never wake up in this world?” I asked. “No, I didn’ t mean that. But now that you have poi nted it out , I have to tell you that it is an alterna tive. The sorcerers of antiqui ty used to do that, never wake up in the world we know . Som e of the sorcerers of my line have done it too. It certainly can be done , but I don’ t recom mend it. What I want is for you to wake up naturally when you are through wi th dreaming, but while you are dreaming, I want you to dream that you wake up in anot her dream.” I heard myself asking the same que stion I had asked the first time he told me about setting up dreaming. “But is it pos sible to do that?” Don Juan obvi ous ly ca ught on to my mindl essness and laughi ngl y repeated the answer he had given me before. “Of cour se it’s pos sible. This cont rol is no different from the cont rol we have ove r any situation in our daily lives.” I qui ckly got ove r my embarrassment and was ready to ask more que stions , but don Juan anticipated me and began to expl ain facets of the second gate of dreaming, an expl anation that made me yet more une asy. “There’s one probl em with the second gate,” he said. “It’s a probl em that can be serious , dependi ng on one ’s bent of character. If our tende ncy is to indul ge in clingi ng to things or situations , we are in for a sock in the jaw.” “In what way, don Juan?”"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 “Think for a moment. You’ ve already expe rienced the out landi sh joy of examining your dreams’ cont ents. Imagine your - sell goi ng from dream to dream, watching everything, examining every detail. It’s very easy to realize that one may sink to mortal depths. Especially if one is given to indul ging.” “Woul dn’ t the body or the brain naturally put a stop to it?” “If it’s a natural sleeping situation, meaning nor mal, yes. But this is not a nor mal situation. This is dreaming. A dreamer on crossing the first gate has already reached the energy body. So what is really going through the second gate, hoppi ng from dream to dream, is the energy body .” “What’s the implication of all this, don Juan?” “The implication is that on crossing the second gate you must intend a greater and more sobe r cont rol ove r your dreaming attention: the only safety valve for dreamers.” “What i s this safety valve?” “You will find out for your self that the true goa l of dreaming is to perfect the energy body. A perfect energy body, among other things of cour se, has such a cont rol ove r the dreaming attention that it makes it stop when needed. This is the safety valve dreamers have. No matter how indul ging they might be, at a given time, their dreaming attention must make them surface.” I started all ove r again on anot her dreaming que st. This time the goa l was more elusive and the difficulty even gre ater. Exactly as with my first task, I coul d not begin to figure out what to do. I had the discour aging suspicion that all my practice was not goi ng to be of much help this time. After count less failures, I gave up and settled dow n to simply cont inue my pr actice of fixing my dreaming attention on every item of my dreams. Accepting my shor tcom ings seemed to give me a boos t, and I became even more adept at sustaining the view of any item in my dreams. A year went by without any change . Then one day som e thing change d. As I was watching a window in a dream, trying to. find out if I coul d catch a glimpse of the scenery out side the room , som e windl ike force, which I felt as a buz zing in my ears, pul led me through the window to the out side. Just before that pul l, my dreaming attention had been caught by a strange structure som e distance away. It looke d like a tractor. The next thing I kne w, I was standi ng by it, examining it. I was perfectly aware that I was dreaming. I looke d around to find out if I coul d tell fro m what window I had been looki ng. The scene was that of a farm in the count ryside. No bui ldings were in sight . I wanted to ponde r this. How ever, the qua ntity of farm machinery lying around, as if abandone d, took all my attention. I examined mow ing machines , tractors, grain harvesters, disk plow s, thrashers. There were so many that I forgot my original dream. What I wanted then was to orient myself by watching the immediate scenery. There was som ething in the distance that looke d like a billboa rd and som e te lephone pol es around it. The instant I focused my attention on that billboa rd, I was next to it. The steel structure of the billboa rd gave me a fright . It was menacing. On the billboa rd itself was a picture of a"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 bui lding. I read the text; it was an adve rti sement for a motel. I had a peculiar certainty that I was in Oregon or northern California. I looke d for other features in the envi ronm ent of my dream. I saw mount ains very far away and som e green, round hills not too far. On thos e hills were clum ps of wha t I thought were California oak trees. I wanted to be pulled by the green hills, but what pul led me were the distant mount ains. I was convi nced that they were the Sierras. All my dreaming energy left me on thos e mount ains. But before it did, I was pul led b y every pos sible feature. My dream ceased to be a dream. As far as my capacity to perceive was conc erned, I was veritably in the Sierras, zooming into ravines, boul ders, trees, caves. I went from scarp faces to mount ain peaks unt il I had no more drive and coul d not focus my dreaming attention on anyt hing. I felt myself losing cont rol. Finally, there was no more scenery, just darkne ss. “You have reached the second gate of dreaming, ” don Juan said when I narrated my dream to him. “What you shoul d do next is t o cross it. Crossing the second gate is a very serious affair; it requi res a most disciplined effort.” I was not sure I had fulfilled the task he out lined for me, because I had not really woke n up in anot her dream. I asked don Juan about this irregul arity. “The mistake was mine,” he said. “I told you that one has to wake up in anot her dream, but what I meant is that one has to change dreams in an orderly and precise manne r, the way you have done it. “With the first gate, you wasted a lot of time looki ng exc lusively for your hands . This time, you went directly to the solution without bot hering to follow the given com mand: to wake up in anot her dream.” Don Juan said that there are two ways of prope rly crossing the second gate of dreaming. One is to wake up in anot her dream, that is to say, to dream that one is having a dream and then dream that one wakes up from it. The alternative is to use the items of a dream to trigge r anot her dream, exactly as I had done . Just as he had been doi ng all along , don Juan let m e practice without any interference on his part. And I corrobo rated the two alternatives he described. Either I dreamt that I was having a dream from which I dreamt I woke up or I zoom ed from a definite item accessible to my immediate dreaming attention to anot her one , not qui te accessible. Or I entered into a slight variation of the second: I gazed at any item of a dream, maintaining the gaze unt il the item change d shape and, by changing shape, pul led me into anot her dream through a buz zing vortex. Never w as I capable, how ever, of deciding beforehand which of the three I woul d follow . My dreaming practices always ende d by my runni ng out of dreaming attention and finally waking up or by my falling into dark, deep slum ber. Everything went smoot hly in my pract ices. The only disturbance I had was a peculiar interference, a jolt of fear or discom fort I had begun to expe rience with increasing freque ncy. My way of discarding it was to believe that it was related to my gha stly eating habits or to the fact that, in t hos e days, don Juan was giving me a profusion of hallucinoge nic plants as part of my training. Thos e jolts became so prom inent, how ever, that I had to ask don Juan’s advi ce."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 “You have entered now into the most dange rous facet of the sorcerers’ know ledge ,” he began. “it is sheer dread, a veritable night mare. I coul d joke with you and say that I didn’ t mention this pos sibility to you out of regard for your cherished rationa lity, but I can’t. Every sorcerer has to face it. Here is where, I fear, you might very well think you ’re goi ng off the deep end.” Don Juan very solemnly expl ained that life and conscious ness, being exclusively a matter of energy, are not solely the prope rty of organisms. He said that sorcerers have seen that there are two type s of cons cious beings roaming the earth, the organic and the inorganic, and that in com paring one with the other, they have seen that bot h are lum inous masses crossed from every imaginable angl e by millions of the uni verse’s energy filaments. They are different from eac h other in their shape and in their degree of bright ness. Inor ganic beings are long and candl elike but opa que , whereas organic beings are round and by far the bright er. Anot her not eworthy difference, which don Juan said sorcerers have seen, is that the lif e and cons cious ness of organic beings is shor t - lived, because they are made to hur ry, whereas the life of inor ganic beings is infinitely longe r and their cons cious ness infinitely more calm and deeper. “Sorcerers find no probl em interacting with them,” don Juan went on. “Inorganic beings pos sess the crucial ingr edient for interaction, cons cious ness.” “But do these inor ganic beings really exist? Like you and I exist?” I asked. “Of cour se they do, ” he replied. “Believe me, sorcerers are very intelligent creatu res; unde r no condi tion woul d they toy with aberrations of the mind and then take them for real.” “Why do you say they are alive?” “For sorcerers, having life means having cons cious ness. It means having an assemblage poi nt and its surroundi ng glow of aware ness, a condi tion that points out to sorcerers that the being in front of them, organic or inorganic, is thor oughl y capable of perceiving. Perceiving is unde rstood by sorcerers as the precondi tion of being alive.” “Then the inor ganic beings must also die. Is that true, don Juan?” “Naturally. They lose their awareness just like we do, except that the lengt h of their cons cious ness is stagge ring to the mind. ” “Do these inor ganic beings appe ar to sorcerers?” “It’s very difficult to tell what is what with them. Let’s say that thos e beings are enticed by us or, better yet, com pelled to interact with us.” Don Juan peered at me most intently. “You’ re not taking in any of this at all,” he said with the tone of som eone who has reached a conc lusion. “It’s nearly impos s ible for me to think about this rationa lly,” I said. “I warned you that the subj ect will tax your reason. The prope r thing to do then is to suspend judgm ent and let things take their cour se, meaning that you let the inorganic beings com e to you. ” “Are you serious , don Juan?”"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 “Deadly serious . The difficulty with inorganic beings is that their awareness is very slow in com parison with our s. It will take years for a sorcerer to be acknow ledge d by inor ganic beings . So, it is advi sable to have patience and wait. Soone r or later they show up. But not like you or I woul d show up. Theirs is a most peculiar way to make themselves know n.” “How do sorcerers entice them? Do they have a ritual?” “Well, they certainly don’ t stand in the middl e of the road and call out to them with trembling voi ces at the stroke of midni ght , if that’s what you mean.” “What do they do then?” “They entice them in dreaming. I said that what’s invol ved is more than enticing them; by the act of dreaming, sorcerers com pel thos e beings to interact with them.” “How do sorcerers com pel them by the act of dreaming? ” “Dreaming is sustaining the pos ition where the assemblage poi nt has shifted in dreams. This act creates a distinctive energy charge, which attracts their attention. It’s like bait to fish; they’ll go for it. Sorcerers, by reaching and crossing the first two gates’ of dreaming, set bait for thos e beings and com pel them to appe ar. “By goi ng through the two gates, you have made your biddi ng know n to them. Now , you must wait for a sign from the m.” “What woul d the sign be, don Juan?” “Possibly the appe arance of one of them, although that seems too soon. I am of the opi nion that their sign will be simply som e interference in your dreaming. I believe that the jolts of fear you are expe riencing now a days are not indi gestion but energy jolts sent to you by the inorganic beings .” “What shoul d I do? ” “You must gauge your expe ctations .” I coul d not unde rstand what he meant, and he carefully expl ained that our normal expe ctation when enga ging in inter acti on with our fellow men or with other organic beings is to get an immediate reply to our solicitation. With inor ganic beings , how ever, since they are separated from us by a most formidable barrier — energy that move s at a different speed — sorcerers must gauge their expe ctations and sustain the solicitation for as long as it takes to be acknow ledge d. “Do you mean, don Juan, that the solicitation is the same as the dreaming practices?” “Yes. But for a perfect result, you must add to you r practices the intent of reaching thos e inor ganic beings . Send a feeling of pow er and confidence to them, a feeling of strengt h, of detachm ent. Avoi d at any cost sendi ng a feeling of fear or morbidity They are pretty morbid by themselves; to add your morbidity to them is unne cessa ry, to say the least.” “I’m not clear, don Juan, about the way they appe ar to sorcerers. What is the peculiar way they make themselves know n?”"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 “They do, at times, materialize themselves in the daily world, right in front of us. Most of the time, though, th eir invi sible presence is marked by a bodi ly jolt, a shiver of sorts that com es from the marrow of the bone s.” “What about in dreaming, don Juan?” “In dreaming we have the total oppos ite. At times, we feel them the way you are feeling them, as a jolt of fe ar. Most of the time, they materialize themselves right in front of us. Since at the beginni ng of dreaming we have no experience whatsoever with them, they might imbue us with fear beyond measure. That is a real dange r to us. Through the channe l of fear, t hey can follow us to the daily world, with disastrous results for us.” “In what way, don Juan?” “Fear can settle dow n in our lives, and we woul d have to be mavericks to deal with it. Inor ganic beings can be worse than a pest. Throug h fear they can easily d rive us raving mad.” “What do sorcerers do with inor ganic beings ?” “They mingl e with them. They turn them into allies. They form associations , create extraordinary friends hips. I call them vast enterprises, where perception plays the uppe rmost role. We are social beings . We una voi dably seek the com pany of cons cious ness. “With inor ganic beings , the secret is not to fear them. And this must be done from the beginni ng. The intent one has to send out to them has to be of pow er and abandon. In that intent one mu st encode the message ‘I don’ t fear you. Com e to see me. If you do, I’ll welcom e you. If you don’ t want to com e, I’ll miss you. ’ With a message like this, they’ll get so curious that they’ll com e for sure.” “Why shoul d they com e to seek me, or why on earth shoul d I seek them?” “Dreamers, whether they like it or not , in their dreaming seek associations with other beings . This may com e to you as a shoc k, but dreamers autom atically seek groups of beings , nexus es of inor ganic beings in this case. Dreamers seek them avidly.” “This is very strange to me, don Juan. Why woul d dreamers do that?” “The nove lty for us is the inor ganic beings . And the nove lty for them is one of our kind crossing the bounda ries of their realm. The thing you must bear in mind from now on i s that inor ganic beings with their supe rb cons cious ness exert a tremendous pul l ove r dreamers and can easily transpor t them into worlds beyond description. “The sorcerers of antiqui ty used them, and they are the one s who coined the name allies. Their allie s taught them to move the assemblage poi nt out of the egg’ s bounda ries into the non hum an uni verse. So when they transpor t a sorcerer, they transpor t him to worlds beyond the hum an dom ain.” As I heard him talk, I was plague d by strange fears and misgivings , which he prom ptly realized."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 “You are a religious man to the end. ” He laughe d. “Now , you’ re feeling the devil breathing dow n your neck. Think about dreaming in these terms: dreaming is perceiving more than what we believe it is pos sible to perceive.” In m y waking hour s, I worried about the pos sibility that inorganic cons cious beings really existed. When I was dreaming, how ever, my cons cious worries did not have much effect. The jolts of phys ical fear cont inue d, but whenever they happe ned a strange calmness always trailed behind, a calmness that took cont rol of me and let me proceed as if I had no fear at all. It seemed at that time that every breakthrough in dreaming happe ned to me sudde nly, without warning. The presence of inorganic beings in my dreams was no exception. It happe ned while I was dreaming about a circus I knew in my childhoo d. The setting looke d like a tow n in the mount ains in Arizona . I began to watch peopl e with the vague hope I always had that I woul d see again the peopl e I had seen the fir st time don Juan made me enter into the second attention. As I watched them, I felt a sizable jolt of nervous ness in the pit of my stom ach; it was like a punc h. The jolt distracted me, and I lost sight of the peopl e, the circus, and the mount ain tow n in Ar izona . In their place stood two strange - looki ng figur es. They were thin, less than a foot wide, but long , perhaps seven feet. They were loom ing ove r me like two gigantic earth worms. I kne w that it was a dream, but I also kne w that I was seeing. Don Juan h ad discussed seeing in my nor mal awareness and in the second attention as well. Although I was incapable of expe riencing it myself, I thought I had unde rstood the idea of directly perceiving energy. In that dream, looki ng at thos e two strange appa ritions , I realized that I was seeing the energy essence of som ething unbe lievable. I remained very calm. I did not move . The most remarkable thing to me was that they didn’ t dissolve or change into som e thing else. They were cohe sive beings that retained their can dlelike shape. Som ething in them was forcing som ething in me to hol d the view of their shape. I kne w it because som ething was telling me that if I did not move , they woul d not move either. It all came to an end, at a given mom ent, when I woke up with a fri ght . I was immediately besieged by fears. A deep preoccupa tion took hol d of me. It was not psychol ogi cal worry but rather a bodi ly sense of angui sh, sadne ss with no appa rent founda tion. The two strange shapes appe ared to me from then on in every one of my dreaming sessions . Eventually, it was as if I dreamt only to encount er them. They never attempted to move tow ard me or to interfere with me in any way. They just stood there, immobi le, in front of me, for as long as my dream lasted. Not onl y did I never ma ke any effort to change my dreams but I even forgot the original quest of my dreaming practices. When I finally discussed with don Juan what was happe ning to me, I had spent mont hs solely viewing the two shapes. “You are stuck at a dange rous crossroad,” do n Juan said. “It isn’t right to chase these beings away, but it isn’t right either to let them stay. For the time being, their presence is a hindr ance to you r dreaming. ”"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 “What can I do, don Juan?” “Face them, right now , in the world of daily life, and tell them to com e back later, when you have more dreaming pow er.” “How do I face them?” “It’s not simple, but it can be done . It requi res onl y that you have enough gut s, which of cour se you do. ” Without waiting for me to tell him that I had no guts at all, he took me to the hills. He lived then in nor thern Mexico, and he had given me the total impression he was a solitary sorcerer, an old man forgot ten by everybody and com pletely out side the main current of hum an affairs. I had surmised, how ever, that he was in telligent beyond measure. And because of this I was willing to com ply with what I half - believed were mere eccentricities. The cunni ngne ss of sorcerers, cultivated through the ages, was don Juan’s trademark. He made sure that I unde rstood all I coul d in my normal awareness and, at the same time, he made sure that I entered into the second attention, where I unde r stood or at least passiona tely listened to everything he taught me. In this fashion, he divided me in two. In my nor mal cons cious ness, I coul d not unde rstand why or how I was more than willing to take his eccentricities serious ly. In the second attention, it all made sense to me. His cont ention was that the second attention is available to all of us, but , by willfully hol ding on to our half - cocked ra tiona lity, som e of us more fiercely than others, keep the second attention at arm’s lengt h. His idea was that dreaming brings dow n the bathers that surround and insulate the second attention. The day he took me to the hills of the Sono ran desert to meet th e inorganic beings , I was in my normal state of awareness. Yet som ehow I knew I had to do som ething that was certainly goi ng to be unbe lievable. It had rained light ly in the desert. The red dirt was still wet, and as I walked it got clum ped up in the rubbe r soles of my shoe s. I had to step on rocks to remove the heavy chunks of dirt. We walked in an easterly direction, climbing tow ard the hills. When we got to a narrow gully between two hills, don Juan stoppe d. “This is for sure an ideal place to sum mon you r friends ,” he said. “Why do you call them my friends ?” “They have singl ed you out themselves. When they do that, it means that they seek an association. I’ve mentione d to you that sorcerers form bonds of friends hip with them. Your case seems to be an exam ple. And you don ’t even have to solicit them.” “What doe s such a friends hip cons ist of, don Juan?” “It cons ists of a mutual exchange of energy. The inorganic beings suppl y their high awareness, and sorcerers suppl y their height ened awareness and high energ y. The pos itive result is an even exchange . The negative one is depende ncy on bot h parties. “The old sorcerers used to love their allies. In fact, they love d their allies more than they love d their ow n kind. I can foresee terrible dange rs in that.”"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 “What d o you recom mend I do, don Juan?” “Sum mon them. Size them up, and then decide yourself what to do. ” “What shoul d I do to sum mon them?” “Hold your dream view of them, in your mind. The reason they have saturated you with their presence in you r dreams is that they want to create a memory of their shape in your mind. And this is the time to use that memory” Don Juan forcefully ordered me to close my eyes and keep them closed. Then he gui ded me to sit dow n on som e rocks. I felt the hardne ss and the coldne ss of t he rocks. The rocks were slanted; it was difficult to keep my balance. “Sit here and visualize their shape unt il they are just like they. are in your dreams,” don Juan said in my ear. “Let me know when you have them in focus.” It took me very little time a nd effort to have a com plete mental picture of their shape, just like in my dreams. It did not surprise me at all that I coul d do it. What shoc ked me was that, although I tried desperately to let don Juan know I had pictured them in my mind, I coul d not vo ice my words or ope n my eyes. I was definitely awake. I coul d hear every thing. I heard don Juan say, “You can ope n your ‘eyes now.” I ope ned them with no difficulty I was sitting cross - legge d on som e rocks, which were not the same one s I had felt unde r me when I sat dow n. Don Juan was just behind me to my right . I tried to turn around to face him, but he forced my head to remain straight . And then I saw two dark figur es, like two thin tree trunks , right in front of me. I stared at them ope nm out hed; they we re not as tall as in my dreams. They had shrunk to half their size. Instead of being shapes of opa que lum inos ity, they were now two conde nsed, dark, almost black, menacing sticks. “Get up and grab one of them,” don Juan ordered me, “and don’ t let go, no ma tter how it shakes you. ” I definitely did not want to do anyt hing of the sort, but som e unknow n drive made me stand up against my will. I had at that moment the clear realization that I woul d end up doi ng what he had ordered me to, although I had no cons ci ous intention of doing so. Mechanically, I adva nced tow ard the two figur es, my heart poundi ng nearly out of my chest. I grabbe d the one to my right . What I felt was an electric discharge that almost made me drop the dark figur e. Don Juan’s voi ce came to me as if he had been yelling from a distance away. “You drop it and you’ re done for,” he said. I held on to the figure, which twirled and shook. Not like a massive animal woul d, but like som ething qui te fluffy and light, although strongl y electrical. We roll ed and turned on the sand of the gul ly for qui te som e time. It gave me jolt after jolt of som e sickening electric current. I thought it was sickening because I fancied it to be different from the energy I had always encount ered in our daily world. When it hit my body , it tickled me and made me yell and grow l like an animal, not in angui sh but in a strange ange r."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 It finally became a still, almost solid form unde r me. It lay inert. I asked don Juan if it was dead, but I did not hear my voi ce. “Not a chance,” said som eone laughi ng, som eone who was not don Juan. “You’ ve just depleted its energy charge. But don’ t get up yet. Lie there just a mom ent longe r.” I looke d at don Juan with a que stion in my eyes. He was examining me with great curiosity. Then he helped m e up. The dark figur e remained on the ground . I wanted to ask don Juan if the dark figur e was all right . Again, I coul d not voi ce my que stion. Then I did som ething extravagant. I took it all for real. Up to that mom ent som ething in my mind was preserving m y rationa lity by taking what was happe ning as a dream, a dream induc ed by don Juan’s machinations . I went to the figur e on the ground and tried to lift it up. I coul d not put my arms around it because it had no mass. I became disoriented. The same voi ce, w hich was not don Juan’s, told me to lie dow n on top of the inorganic being. I did it, and bot h of us got up in one motion, the inor ganic being like a dark shadow attached to me. It gently separated from me and disappe ared, leaving me with an extremely plea sant feeling of com pleteness. It took me more than twenty - four hour s to regain total cont rol of my faculties. I slept most of the time. Don Juan checked me from time to time by asking me the same que stion, “Was the inor ganic being’ s energy like fire or lik e water?” My throat seemed scorched. I coul d not tell him that the energy jolts I had felt were like jets of electrified water. I have never felt jets of electrified water in my life. I am not sure if it is pos sible to produc e them or to feel them, but tha t was the image playing in my mind every time don Juan asked his key que stion. Don Juan was asleep when I finally kne w I was com pletely recove red. Know ing that his que stion was of great impor tance, I woke him up and told him what I had felt. “You are not g oing to have helping friends among the inor ganic beings , but relations hips of annoyi ng depende nce,” he stated. “Be extremely careful. Watery inorganic beings are more given to excesses. The old sorcerers believed that they were more lovi ng, more capable of imitating, or perhaps even having feelings. As oppos ed to the fiery one s, who were thought to be more serious , more cont ained than the others, but also more pom pous .” “What’s the meaning of all this for me, don Juan?” “The meaning is too vast to discuss a t this time. My recom menda tion is that you vanqui sh fear from your dreams and from your life, in order to safegua rd your uni ty The inorganic being you depleted of energy and then recharged again was thrilled out of its candl elike shape with it. It’ll com e to you for more.” “Why didn’ t you stop me, don Juan?” “You didn’ t give me time. Besides, you didn’t even hear me shout ing at you to leave the inor ganic being on the ground .” “You shoul d have lectured me, beforehand, the way you always do, about all the pos sibilities.”"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 “I didn’ t know all the pos sibilities. In matters of the inor ganic beings , I am nearly a novi ce. I refused that part of the sorcerers’ know ledge on the ground that it is too cum bersom e and capricious . I don’ t want to be at the mercy of any enti ty. organic or inor ganic.” That was the end of our exchange . I shoul d have been worried because of his definitely negative reaction, but I was not . I som ehow was certain that whatever I had done was all right . I cont inue d my dreaming practices without any interference from the inorganic beings . CHAPTER 4 THE FIXATION OF THE ASSEMBLAGE POINT Since our agreement had been to discuss dreaming onl y when don Juan cons idered it necessary, I rarely asked him about it and never insisted on cont inui ng my que stions beyond a certain poi nt. I was more than eager, therefore, to listen to him whenever he decided to take up the subj ect. His com ments or discussions on dreaming were inva riably cushione d in other topi cs of his teachings , and they were always sudde nly and ab rupt ly brought in. We were enga ged in som e unr elated conve rsation onc e, while I was visiting with him in his hous e, when without any preamble he said that, by means of their dreaming cont acts with inor ganic beings , the old sorcerers became immensely well - v ersed in the manipul ation of the assemblage poi nt, a vast and ominous subj ect. I immediately grabbe d the oppo rtuni ty and asked don Juan for an estimate of the time when the old sorcerers might have lived. At various oppor tuni ties before, I had asked the sa me que stion, but he never gave me a satisfactory answer. I was conf ident, how ever, that at the mom ent, perhaps because he had brought up the subj ect himself, he might be willing to oblige me. “A most trying subj ect,” he said. The way he said it made me bel ieve he was discarding my que stion. I was qui te surprised when he cont inued talking. “It’ll tax you r rationa lity as much as the topi c of inorganic beings . By the way, what do you think about them now ?” “I have let my opi nions rest,” I said. “I can’t afford to think one way or anot her.” My answer delight ed him. He laughe d and com mented on his ow n fears of and aversions to the inorganic beings . “They have never been my cup of tea,” he said. “Of cour se, the main reason was my fear of them. I was una ble to get ove r it when I had to, and then it became fixed.” “Do you fear them now , don Juan?” “It’s not qui te fear I feel but revul sion. I don ’t want any part of them.” “Is there any particular reason for this revul sion? ”"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 “The best reason in the world: we are antith etical. They love slavery, and I love freedom . They love to buy, and I don’ t sell.” I became inexpl icably agitated and brusque ly told him that the subj ect was so farfetched for me that I coul d not take it serious ly. He stared at me, smiling, and said, “The best thing to do with inor ganic beings is what you do: deny their existence but visit with them regul arly and maintain that you are dreaming and in dreaming anyt hing is pos sible. This way you don’ t com mit your self.” I felt strange ly gui lt although I coul d not figur e out why. I felt com pelled to ask, “What are you referring to, don Juan?” “To your visits with the inor ganic beings ,” he replied dryly. “Are you kiddi ng? What visits?” “I didn’ t want to discuss this, but I think it’s time I tell you that the nag ging voi ce you heard, remindi ng you to fix your dreaming attention on the items of you r dreams, was the voi ce of an inor ganic being.” I thought don Juan was com pletely irrationa l. I became so irritated that I even yelled at him. He laughe d at me and asked me to tell him about my irregul ar dreaming sessions . That reque st surprised me. I had never mentione d to anyone that every so often I used to zoom out of a dream, pul led by a given item, but instead of my changi ng dreams, as I shoul d have, the total mood o f the dream change d and I woul d find myself in a dimension unknow n to me. I soared in it, directed by som e invisible gui de, which made me twirl around and around . I always awoke from one of these dreams still twirling, and I cont inue d tossing and turning f or a long time before I fully woke up. “Thos e are bona fide meetings you are having with your inorganic being friends ,” don Juan said. I did not want to argue with him, but neither did I want to agree. I remained silent. I had forgot ten my que stion about t he old sorcerers, but don Juan picked up the subj ect again. “My unde rstandi ng is that the old sorcerers existed perhaps as far back as ten thous and years ago, ” he said, smiling and watching my reaction. Basing my respons e on current archaeologi cal data on the migration of Asiatic nom adic tribes to the Americas, I said that I believed his date was incorrect. Ten thous and years was too far back. “You have your know ledge and I have mine,” he said. “My know ledge is that the old sorcerers ruled for four thous and years, from seven thous and to three thous and years ago. Three thous and years ago, they went to not hing. And from then on, sorcerers have been regroupi ng, restructuring what was left of the old ones.” “How can you be so sure about your dates?” I asked. “Ho w can you be so sure about your s?” he retorted. I told him that archaeologi sts have fool proof methods to establish the date of past cultures. Again he retorted that sorcerers have fool proof methods of their ow n."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 “I’m not trying to be cont rary or argue you dow n,” he cont inue d, “but som eday soon you may be able to ask som eone who know s for sure.” “No one can know this for sure, don Juan.” “This is anot her of thos e impos sible things to believe, but there is som ebody who can verify all this. You’ll meet that pe rson som eday.” “Com e on, don Juan, you’ ve got to be joki ng. Who can verify what happe ned seven thous and years ago? ” “Very simple, one of the old sorcerers we’ve been talking about . The one I met. He’s the one who told me all about the old sorcerers. I hope you remember what I am going to tell you about that particular man. He is the key to many of our ende avor s, and he’s also the one you have to meet.” I told don Juan that I was hangi ng on every word he said, even though I did not unde rstand what he was say ing. He accused me of hum oring him and not believing a word about the old sorcerers. I adm itted that in my state of daily cons cious ness, of cour se, I had not believed thos e farfetched stories. But neither had I in the second attention, although there I sho uld have had a different reaction. “Only when you ponde r what I said doe s it becom e a far fetched story,” he remarked. “If you don’ t invol ve your com mon sense, it remains pur ely a matter of energy. ” “Why did you say, don Juan, that I am goi ng to meet one o f the old sorcerers?” “Because you are. It is vital that the two of you meet, som e day. But, for the mom ent, just let me tell you anot her farfetched story about one of the nagua ls of my line, the nagua l Sebastian.” Don Juan told me then that the nagua l Seb astian had been a sexton in a chur ch in sout hern Mexico around the beginni ng of the eight eenth century. In his account , don Juan stressed how sorcerers, past or present, seek and find refuge in established institutions , such as the Chur ch. It was his idea that because of their supe rior discipline, sorcerers are trustworthy employe es and that they are avidly sought by institutions that are always in dire need of such persons . Don Juan maintained that as long as no one is aware of the sorcerers’ doi ngs , their lack of ideologi cal sym pathies makes them appe ar as mode l workers. Don Juan cont inue d his story and said that one day, while Sebastian was performing his dut ies as a sexton, a strange man came to the chur ch, an old Indi an who seemed to be ill. In a weak v oice he told Sebastian that he needed help. The nagua l thought that the Indi an wanted the parish priest, but the man, making a great effort, addressed the nagua l. In a harsh and direct tone , he told him that he kne w that Sebastian was not onl y a sorcerer b ut a nagua l. Sebastian, qui te alarmed by this sudde n turn of events, pul led the Indi an aside and demande d an apol ogy. The man replied that he was not there to apol ogi ze but to get specialized help. He needed, he said, to receive the nagua l’s energy in orde r to maintain his life, which, he assured Sebastian, had spanne d thous ands of years but at the mom ent was ebbi ng away."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 Sebastian, who was a very intelligent man, unw illing to pay attention to such nons ense, urged the Indian to stop clow ning around . The old man became angr y and threatened Sebastian with expos ing him and his group to the ecclesiastical author ities if he did not com ply with his reque st. Don Juan reminde d me that thos e were the times when the ecclesiastical author ities were brutally and systema tically eradicating heretical practices among the Indi ans of the New World. The man’s threat was not som ething to be taken light ly; the nagua l and his group were inde ed in mortal dange r. Sebastian. asked the Indi an how he coul d give him energy The man expl ained that nagua ls, by means of their discipline, gain a peculiar energy that they store in their bodi es and that he woul d get it painlessly from Sebastian’s energy center on his navel. In return for it, Sebastian woul d get not onl y the oppor tuni ty to cont inue his activities uns cathed but also a gift of pow er. The know ledge that he was being manipul ated by the old Indi an did not sit right with the nagua l, but the man was inflexible and left him no alternative but to com ply with his reque st. Don Juan assured me that the old Indi an was not exagge rating about his claims at all. He turned out to be one of the sorcerers of ancient times, one of thos e know n as the death defiers. He had appa rently survived to the present by manipul ating his assemblage poi nt in ways that onl y he kne w about . Don Juan said that what transpired between Sebastian and that man later became the ground for an agreement that had bound all six naguals who follow ed Sebastian. The death defier kept his word; in exchange for energy from every on e of thos e men, he made a dona tion to the giver, a gift of pow er. Sebastian had to accept such a gift, although reluctantly; he had been cornered and had no other choi ce. All the other nagua ls who follow ed him, how ever, gladly and proudl y accepted their gi fts. Don Juan conc lude d his story, saying that ove r time the death defier came to be know n as the tenant. And for ove r two hundr ed years, the nagua ls of don Juan’s line honor ed that bindi ng agreement, creating a sym biotic relations hip that change d the cour se and final goa l of their lineage. Don Juan did not care to expl ain the story any further, and I was left with a strange sensation of truthfulness, which was more bot hersom e to me than I coul d have imagined. “How did he get to live that long? ” I asked. “N o one know s,” don Juan replied. “All we’ve kno wn about him, for generations , is what he tells us. The death defier is the one I asked about the old sorcerers, and he told me that they were at their peak three thous and years ago. ” “How do you know he was te lling you the truth?” I asked. Don Juan shook his head in amazement, if not revul sion. “When you’ re facing that inconc eivable unknow n out there,” he said, poi nting all around him, “you don ’t fool around with petty lies. Petty lies are onl y for peopl e who h ave never witnessed what’s out there, waiting for them.” “What’s waiting for us out there, don Juan?”"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 His answer, a seemingl y innoc uous phr ase, was more terrifying to me than if he had described the most hor rendous thing. “Som ething utterly impersona l,” he said. He must have not iced that I was com ing apart. He made me change levels of awareness to make my fright vanish. A few mont hs later, my dreaming practices took a strange turn. I began to get, in my dreams, replies to que stions I was planni ng to ask don Juan. The most impressive part of this oddi ty was that it qui ckly lapsed into my waking hour s. And one day, while I was sitting at my desk, I got a reply to an unvo iced que stion about the realness of inor ganic beings . I had seen inor ganic beings in dreams so many times I had begun to think of them as real. I reminde d myself I had even touc hed one , in a state of seminor mal cons cious ness in the Sono ran desert. And my dreams had been periodi cally deviated to views of worlds I serious ly doubt ed coul d have been produc ts of my mentality. I wished to give don Juan my best shot , in terms of a conc ise que ry so I molded a que stion in my mind: if one is to accept that inor ganic beings are as real as peopl e, where, in the phys icality of the uni verse, is the realm in wh ich they exist? After formulating the que stion to myself, I heard a strange laught er, just as I had the day I wrestled with the inorganic being. Then a man’s voice answered me. “That realm exists in a particular pos ition of the assemblage poi nt,” it said. “Just like your world exists in the habitual pos ition of the assemblage poi nt.” The last thing I wanted was to enter into a dialogu e with a disembodi ed voi ce, so I stood up and ran out of my hous e. The thought occurred to me that I was losing my mind. Anot her worry to add to my collection of worries. The voi ce had been so clear and authoritative that it not onl y intrigue d me but terrified me. I waited with great trepidation for onc om ing barrages of that voi ce, but the event was never repeated. At the first oppor tuni ty I had, I consulted with don Juan. He was not impressed in the least. “You must unde rstand, onc e and for all, that things like this are very nor mal in the life of a sorcerer,” he said. “You are not goi ng mad; you are simply hearing the voi ce of the dreaming emissary. Upon crossing the first or second gate of dreaming, dreamers reach a threshol d of energy and begin to see things or to hear voi ces. Not really plural voices, but a singul ar voi ce. Sorcerers call it the voi ce of the dreaming emissary. ” “What is the dreaming emissary?” “Alien energy that has conc ious ness. Alien energy that pur por ts to aid dreamers by telling them things . The problem with the dreaming emissary is that it can tell onl y what the sorcerers already know or shoul d know , were they worth their salt.” “To say that it’s alien energy that has conc iseness doe sn’t help me at all, don Juan. What kind of energy — benign, maligna nt, right , wrong , what?” “It’s just what I said, alien energy An impersona l force that we turn into a very pers ona l one because it has a voi ce. Some sorcerers swear by it. They even see it. Or, as you your self have done , they simply hear it as a man’s or a wom an’s voice. And the voi ce can tell them about the state of things , which most of the time they take as sacr ed advi ce.”"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 “Why do som e of us hear it as a voi ce?” “We see it or hear it. because we maintain our assemblage poi nts fixed on a specific new pos ition; the more intense this fixation, the more intense our expe rience of the emissary Watch out ! You may see it and feel it as a naked wom an.” Don Juan laughe d at his ow n remark, but I was too scared for levity “Is this force capable of materializing itself?” J asked. “Certainly,” he replied. “And it all depends on how fixed the assemblage poi nt is. But, rest assur ed, if you are capable of maintaining a degree of detachm ent, not hing happe ns. The emissary remains what it is: an impersona l force that acts on us because of the fixation of our assemblage poi nts.” “Is its advi ce safe and sound? ” “It cannot be advi ce. It onl y tells us what’s what, and then we draw the inferences our selves.” I told don Juan then about what the voi ce had said to me. “It’s just like I said,” don Juan remarked. “The emissary didn’ t tell you anyt hing new. Its statements were correct, but it onl y seemed to be revealing things to you . What the emissary did was merely repeat what you already kne w.” “I’m afraid I can’t claim that I kne w all that, don Juan.” “Yes, you can. You know now infinitely more about the mystery of the uni verse than what you r ationa lly suspect. But that’s our hum an malady, to know more about the mystery of the uni verse than we suspect.” Having expe rienced this incredible phe nom enon all by myself, without don Juan’s coaching, made me feel elated. I wanted more information about the emissary. I began to ask don Juan whether he also heard the emissary’s voi ce. He interrupt ed me and with a broad smile said, “Yes, yes. The emissary also talks to me. In my you th I used to see it as a friar with a black cow l. A talking friar who used t o scare the daylight s out of me, every time. Then, when my fear was more manageable, it became a disembodi ed voi ce, which tells me things to this day.” “What kinds of things , don Juan?” “Anyt hing I focus my intent on, things I don’ t want to take the troubl e of follow ing up myself. Like, for example, details about the behavior of my appr entices. What they do when I am not around . It tells me things about you, in particular. The emissary tells me everything you do.” At that poi nt, I really did not care for th e direction our conve rsation had taken. I frantically searched my mind for que stions about other topi cs while he roared with laught er. “Is the dreaming emissary an inor ganic being? ” I asked. “Let’s say that the dreaming emissary is a force that com es from the realm of inor ganic beings . This is the reason dreamers always encount er it.”"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 “Do you mean, don Juan, that every dreamer hears or sees the emissary?” “Everyone hears the emissary; very few see it or feel it.” “Do you have any expl anation for this?” “No. Besides, I really don’ t care about the emissary. At one poi nt in my life, I had to make a decision whether to conc entrate on the inor ganic beings and follow in the foot steps of the old sorcerers or to refuse it all. My teacher, the nagua l Julian, helped m e make up my mind to refuse it. I’ve never regretted that decision. ” “Do you think I shoul d refuse the inorganic beings myself, don Juan?” He did not answer me; instead, he expl ained that the whol e realm of inorganic beings is always poi sed to teach. Perha ps because inor ganic beings have a deeper cons cious ness than our s, they feel com pelled to take us unde r their wings . “I didn’ t see any poi nt in becom ing their pupi l,” he adde d. “Their price is too high. ” “What is their price?” “Our lives, our energy, our d evot ion to them. In other words, our freedom .” “But what do they teach?” “Things pertinent to their world. The same way we our selves woul d teach them, if we were capable of teaching them, things pertinent to our world. Their method, how ever, is to take our basic self as a gauge of what we need and then teach us accordingl y. A most dange rous affair!” “I don’ t see why it woul d be dange rous “If som eone was goi ng to take your basic self as a gauge , with all your fears and greed and envy, et cetera, et cetera, a nd teach you what fulfills that horrible state of being, what do you think the result woul d be?” I had no com eback. I thought I unde rstood perfectly well the reasons for his rejection. “The probl em with the old sorcerers was that they learned wonde rful thi ngs , but on the basis of their una dul terated low er selves,” don Juan went on. “The inor ganic beings became their allies, and, by means of deliberate examples, they taught the old sorcerers marvels. Their allies performed the actions , and the old sorcerers were guided step by step to copy thos e actions , withou t changi ng anyt hing about their basic nature.” “Do these relations hips with inor ganic beings exist toda y?” “I can’t answer that truthfully. All I can say is that I can’t conc eive of having a relations hi p like that myself. Invol vements of this nature curtail our search for freedom by cons um ing all our available energy. In order to really follow their allies’ example, the old sorcerers had to spend their lives in the realm of the inorganic beings . The amou nt of energy needed to accom plish such a sustained jour ney is stagge ring. ” “Do you mean, don Juan, that the old sorcerers were able to exist in thos e realms like we exist here?” “Not qui te like we exist here, but certainly they lived: they retained their a wareness, their indi vidua lity. The dreaming emissary became the most vital entity for thos e sorcerers. If"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 a sorcerer wants to live in the realm of the inor ganic beings , the emissary is the perfect bridge ; it speaks, and its bent is to teach, to gui de.” “Ha ve you ever been in that realm, don Juan?” “Count less times. And so have you. But there is no poi nt in talking about it now . You haven’t cleared all the debris from you r dreaming attention yet. We’ll talk about that realm som e day.” “Do I gather, don Juan, that you don’ t appr ove of or like the emissary?” “I neither approve of it nor like it. It belongs to anot her mood, the old sorcerers’ mood. Besides, its teachings and gui dance in our world are nons ense. And for that nons ense the emissary charges us enor mi ties in terms of energy. One day you will agree with me. You’ ll see.” In the tone of don Juan’s words, I caught a veiled implication of his belief that I disagreed with him about the emissary. I was about to conf ront him with it when I heard the emissary’s voi ce in my ears. “He’s right ,” the voice said. “You like me because you find not hing wrong with expl oring all pos sibilities. You want know ledge ; know ledge is pow er. You don ’t want to remain safe in the routines and beliefs of you r daily world.” The emiss ary said all that in Engl ish with a marked Pacific Coast intona tion. Then it shifted into Spanish. I heard a slight Argentine accent. I had never heard the emissary speaking like this before. It fascinated me. The emissary told me about fulfillment, know le dge ; about how far away I was from my birth place; about my craving for adve nture and my near obs ession with new things , new hor izons . The voi ce even talked to me in Portugue se, with a definite inflection from the sout hern pampas. To hear that voi ce pou rin g out all this flattery not onl y scared me but nauseated me. I told don Juan, right on the spot , that I had to stop my dreaming training. He looke d up at me, caught by surprise. But when I repeated what I had heard, he agreed I shoul d stop, although I sens ed he was doi ng it onl y to appe ase me. A few weeks later, I found my reaction a bit hys terical and my decision to withdr aw uns ound. I went back to my dreaming practices. I was sure don Juan was aware that I had canceled out my withdr awal. On one of my visi ts to him, qui te abrupt ly, he spok e about dreams. “Just because we haven’t been taught to empha size dreams as a genuine field for expl oration doe sn’t mean they are not one ,” he began. “Dreams are analyzed for their meaning or are taken as por tents, but nev er are they taken as a realm of real events. “To my know ledge , onl y the old sorcerers did that,” don Juan went on, “but at the end they flubbe d it. They got greedy, and when they came to a crucial crossroads, they took the wrong fork. They put all their eg gs in one basket: the fixation of the assemblage poi nt on the thous ands of pos itions it can adopt .” Don Juan expr essed his bewilderment at the fact that out of all the marvelous things the old sorcerers learned expl oring thos e thous ands of pos itions , onl y the art of dreaming and the art of stalking remain. He reiterated that the art of dreaming is conc erned with the displacement of the assemblage poi nt. Then he defined stalking as the art that deals with the fixation of the assemblage poi nt on any location to which it is displaced."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 “To fixate the assemblage poi nt on any new spot means to acqui re cohe sion, ” he said. “You have been doi ng just that in you r dreaming practices.” “I thought I was perfecting my energy body, ” I said, som e how surprised at his statem ent. “You are doi ng that and much more; you are learning to have cohe sion. Dreaming doe s it by forcing dreamers to fixate the assemblage poi nt. The dreaming attention, the energy body, the second attention, the relations hip with inorganic beings , the dream ing emissary are but by - produc ts of acqui r ing cohe sion; in other words, they are all by - produc ts of fixat ing the assemblage poi nt on a num ber of dreaming pos itions .” “What is a dreaming pos ition, don Juan?” “Any new pos ition to which the assemblage poi nt has been displaced dur ing sleep.” “How do we fixate the assemblage poi nt on a dreaming pos i tion? ” “By sustaining the view of any item in your dreams, or by changi ng dreams at will. Through you r dreaming practices, you are really exercising your capacity to be cohe sive; that is to say, you are exercising your capacity to maintain a new energy shape by hol ding the assemblage poi nt fixed on the pos ition of any particular dream you are having. ” “Do I really maintain a new energy shape?” “Not exactly, and not because you can’t but onl y because you are shifting the assemblage poi nt instead of movi ng it. Shifts of the assemblage poi nt give rise to minut e change s, which are practically unnot iceable. The challenge of shifts is that they are so small and so num erous that to maintain cohe siveness in all of them is a triumph. ” “How do we know we are maintaining cohe sion? ” “We know it by the clarity of our perception. The clearer the view of our dreams, the greater our cohe sion. ” He said then that it was time for me to have a practical appl ication of what I had learned in dreaming. Without giving me a chance to ask anything, he urged me to focus my attention, as if I were in a dream, on the foliage of a desert tree grow ing nearby: a mesqui te tree. “Do you want me to just gaze at it?” I asked. “I don’ t want you to just gaze at it; I want you to do som e thing very special with that foliage,” he said. “Remember that, in you r dreams, onc e you are able to hold the view of any item, you are really hol ding the dreaming pos ition of you r assemblage poi nt. Now , gaze at thos e leaves as if you were in a dream, but with a slight yet most meaningf ul variation: you are goi ng to hol d your dreaming attention on the leaves of the mesqui te tree in the awareness of our daily world.” My nervou sness made it impos sible for me to follow his line of thought . He patiently expl ained that by staring at the foliage, I woul d accom plish a minut e displacement of my assemblage poi nt. Then, by sum moni ng my dreaming attention through staring at indi vidua l le aves, I woul d actually fixate that minute displacement, and my cohe sion woul d make me perceive in terms of the second attention. He adde d, with a chuc kle, that the process was so simple it was ridiculous ."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 Don Juan was right . All I needed was to focus my si ght on the leaves, maintain it, and in one instant I was drawn into a vor tex - like sensation, extremely like the vor texes in my dreams. The foliage of the mesqui te tree became a uni verse of sensory data. It was as if the foliage had swallow ed me, but it was not onl y my sight that was enga ged; if I touc hed the leaves, I actu ally felt them. I coul d also smell them. My dreaming attention was multisensorial instead of solely visual, as in my regul ar dreaming. What had begun as gazing at the foliage of the mesqu ite tree had turned into a dream. I believed I was in a dreamt tree, as I had been in trees of count less dreams. And, naturally, I behaved in this dreamt tree as I had learned to behave in my dreams; I move d from item to item, pul led by the force of a vor tex that took shape on whatever part of the tree I focused my multisensorial dreaming attention. Vortexes were formed not onl y on gazing but also on touc hing anyt hing with any part of my body. In the midst of this vision or dream, I had an attack of ration al doubt s. I began to wonde r if I had really climbed the tree in a daze and was actually huggi ng the leaves, lost in the foliage, without know ing what I was doi ng. Or perhaps I had fallen asleep, pos sibly mesmerized by the fluttering of leaves in the wind, and was having a dream. But just like in dreaming, I didn’ t have enough energy to ponde r for too long. My thought s were fleeting. They lasted an instant; then the force of direct expe rience blanke ted them out com pletely. A sudde n motion around me shook ev erything and virtually made me emerge from a dum p of leaves, as if I had broke n away from the tree’s magne tic pul l. I was facing then, from an elevation, an immense hor izon. Dark mountains and green vegetation surrounde d me. Anot her jolt of energy made me shake from my bone s out ; then I was som ewhere else. Enor mous trees loom ed everyw here. They were bigge r than the Dougl as firs of Oregon and Washingt on State. Never had I seen a forest like that. The scenery was such a cont rast to the aridne ss of the Sono ran desert that it left me with no doubt that I was having a dream. I held on to that extraordinary view, afraid to let go, know ing that it was inde ed a dream and woul d disappe ar onc e I had run out of dreaming attention. But the images lasted, even when I tho ught I shoul d have run out of dreaming attention. A horrifying thought crossed my mind then: what if this was neither a dream nor the daily world? Fright ened, as an animal must expe rience fright , I recoiled into the dum p of leaves I had emerged from . The m om entum of my backw ard motion kept me goi ng through the tree foliage and around the hard branches. It pul led me away from the tree, and in one split second I was standi ng next to don Juan, at the doo r of his hous e, in the desert in Sonor a. I instantly real ized I had entered again into a state in which I coul d think cohe rently, but I coul d not talk. Don Juan told me not to worry He said that our speech faculty is extremely flimsy and attacks of muteness are com mon among sorcerers who venture beyond the limit s of normal perception. My gut feeling was that don Juan had taken pity on me and had decided to give me a pep talk. But the voi ce of the dreaming emissary, which I clearly heard at that instant, said that in a few hour s and after som e rest I was goi ng to be perfectly well."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 Upon awakening I gave don Juan, at his reque st, a com plete description of what I had seen and done . He warned me that it was not pos sible to rely on my rationa lity to unde rstand my expe rience, not because my rationa lity was in any way im paired but because what had taken place was a phe nom enon out side the parameters of reason. I, naturally, argue d that not hing can be out side the limits of reason; things can be obs cure, but soone r or later reason always finds a way to shed light on anyt hing . And I really believed this. Don Juan, with extreme patience, pointed out that reason is onl y a by - produc t of the habitual pos ition of the assemblage poi nt; therefore, know ing what is goi ng on, being of sound mind, having our feet on the ground — sour ces of great pride to us and assum ed to be a natural cons eque nce of our worth — are merely the result of the fixation of the assemblage poi nt on its habitual place. The more rigid and stationa ry it is, the greater our conf idence in our selves, the greater our feeli ng of know ing the world, of being able to predict. He adde d that what dreaming doe s is give us the fluidity to enter into other worlds by destroyi ng our sense of know ing this world. He called dreaming a jour ney of unt hinka ble dimen sions , a journey that, a fter making us perceive everything we can hum anly perceive, makes the assemblage poi nt jum p out side the hum an dom ain and perceive the inconc eivable. “We are back again, harping on the most impor tant topi c of the sorcerers’ world,” he went on, “the pos itio n of the assem blage poi nt. The old sorcerers’ curse, as well as manki nd’ s thor n in the side.” “Why do you say that, don Juan?” “Because bot h, manki nd in general and the old sorcerers, fell prey to the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt: manki nd, because by not know ing that the assemblage poi nt exists we are obl iged to take the by - produc t of its habitual position as som ething final and indi sput able. And the old sorcerers because, althou gh they kne w all about the assemblage poi nt, they fell for its facility to be manipul ated. “You must avoi d falling into thos e traps,” he cont inue d. “It’d be really disgus ting if you sided with manki nd, as if you didn’ t know about the existence of the assemblage poi nt. But it’d be even more insidious if you sided with the old sor cerers and cyni cally manipul ate the assemblage poi nt for gain.” “I still don’ t unde rstand. What is the conne ction of all this with what I expe rienced yesterday?” “Yesterday, you were in a different world. But if you ask me where that world is, and I tell y ou that it is in the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt, my answer won’ t make any sense to you. ” Don Juan’s argum ent was that I had two choi ces. One was to follow manki nd’ s rationa les and be faced with a predicament: my expe rience woul d tell me that other wo rlds exist, but my reason woul d say that such worlds do not and cannot exist. The other choi ce was to follow the old sorcerers’ rationa les, in which case I woul d autom atically accept the existence of other worlds, and my greed alone would make my assemblag e poi nt hol d on"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 to the pos ition that creates thos e worlds. The result woul d he anot her kind of predicament: that of having to move phys ically into visionl ike realms, driven by expe ctations of pow er and gain. I was too num b to follow his argum ent, but then I realized I did not have to follow it because I agreed with him com pletely, despite the fact that I did not have a total picture of what I was agreeing about . Agreeing with him was rather a feeling that came from far away, an ancient certainty I had lost, which was now slow ly findi ng its way back to me. The return to my dreaming practices eliminated these turmoils, but created new one s. For example, after mont hs of hearing it daily, I stoppe d findi ng the dreaming emissary’s voi ce an annoya nce or a wonde r. It became a matter of course for me. And I made so many mistakes influenced by what it said that I almost unde rstood don Juan’s reluctance to take it serious ly. A psychoa nalyst woul d have had a field day interpreting the emissary according to all the pos si ble permutations of my intrapersona l dyna mics. Don Juan maintained a steadfast view on it: it is an impersona l but cons tant force from the realm of inor ganic beings ; thus , every dreamer expe riences it, in more or less the same terms. And if we choos e to ta ke its words as advi ce, we are incurable fool s. I was definitely one of them. There was no way I coul d have remained impassive being in direct cont act with such an extraordinary event: a voi ce that clearly and conc isely told me in three langua ges hidde n th ings about anyt hing or anyone I focused my attention on. Its onl y drawback, which was of no cons eque nce to me, was that we were not sync hroni zed. The emissary used to tell me things about peopl e or events when I had hone stly forgot ten I had been interested in them. I asked don Juan about this oddi ty and he said that it had to do with the rigidity of my assemblage poi nt. He expl ained that I had been reared by old adul ts and that they had imbue d me with old peopl e’s views; therefore, I was dange rous ly right eo us. His urge to give me pot ions of hallucinoge nic plants was but an effort, he said, to shake my assemblage poi nt and allow it to have a minimal margin of fluidity “If you don ’t develop this margin,” he went on, “either you’ ll becom e more right eous or you’ ll becom e a hys terical sorcerer. My interest in telling you about the old sorcerers is not to bad - mout h them but to pit them against you . Soone r or later, you r assemblage poi nt will be more fluid, but not fluid enough to offset your facility to be like the m: right eous and hys terical.” “How can I avoi d all that, don Juan?” “There is onl y one way. Sorcerers call it sheer und erstandi ng. I call it a rom ance with know ledge . It’s the drive sorcerers use to know , to discove r, to be bewildered.” Don Juan change d th e subj ect and cont inue d to explain the fixation of the assemblage poi nt. He said that seeing children’s assemblage poi nts cons tantly fluttering, as if move d by tremors, changi ng their place with ease, the old sorcerers came to - the conc lusion that the ass emblage poi nt’s habitual location is not inna te but brough t about by habituation. Seeing also that onl y in adul ts is it fixed on one spot , they surmised that the specific location of the assemblage poi nt fosters a specific way of perceiving. Through usage, this specific way of perceiving becom es a system of interpreting sensory data."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 Don Juan poi nted out that, since we are drafted into that sys tem by being bor n into it, from the mom ent of our birth we imperatively strive to adjust our perceiving to conf orm to the demands of this system, a system that rules us for life. Cons eque ntly, the old sorcerers were thor oughl y right in believing that the act of count ermandi ng it and perceiving energy directly is what transforms a person into a sorcerer. Don Juan expr e ssed wonde r at what he called the greatest accom plishm ent of our hum an upbr ingi ng: to lock our assemblage poi nt on its habitual pos ition. For, onc e it is immobi lized there, our perception can be coached and gui ded to interpret what we perceive. In other wo rds, we can then be gui ded to perceive more in terms of our system than in terms of our senses. He assured me that human perception is uni versally hom oge neous , because the assemblage poi nts of the whol e hum an race are fixed on the same spot . He went on to say that sorcerers prove all this to themselves when they see that at the mom ent the assemblage poi nt is displaced beyond a certain threshol d, and new uni versal filaments of energy begin to be perceived, there is no sense to what we perceive. The immediate cause is that new sensory data has rendered our system inope rative; it can no longe r be used to interpret what we are perceiving. “Perceiving without our system is, of cour se, chaotic,” don Juan cont inue d. “But strange ly enough, when we think we have trul y lost our bearings , our old system rallies; it com es to our rescue and transforms our new incomprehensible perception into a thor oughl y com prehensible new world. Just like what happe ned to you when you gazed at the leaves of the mesqui te tree.” “What exac tly happe ned to me, don Juan?” “Your perception was chaotic for a while; everything came to you at onc e, and your system for interpreting the world didn’ t func tion. Then, the chaos cleared up, and there you were in front of a new world.” “We are again, don Juan, at the same place we were before. Does that world exist, or is it merely my mind that conc octed it?” “We certainly are back, and the answer is still the same. It exists in the precise pos ition your assemblage poi nt was at that mom ent. In order to pe rceive it, you needed cohe sion, that is, you needed to maintain your assemblage poi nt fixed on that pos ition, which you did. The result was that you totally per ceived a new world for a while.” “But woul d others perceive that same world?” “If they had uni f ormity and cohe sion, they woul d. Uniformity is to hol d, in uni son, the same pos ition of the assemblage poi nt. The old sorcerers called the entire act of acqui ring uni formity and cohe sion out side the normal world stalking perception. “The art of stalking, ” he cont inue d, “as I have already said, deals with the fixation of the assemblage poi nt. The old sorcerers discove red, through practice, that important as it is to dis place the assemblage poi nt, it is even more important to make it stay fixed on its new po sition, wherever that new pos ition might be.” He expl ained that if the assemblage poi nt doe s not becom e stationa ry, there is no way that we can perceive cohe rently. We woul d expe rience then a kaleidos cope of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 disassociated images. This is the reason the old sorcerers put as much empha sis on dreaming as they did on stalking. One art cannot exist without the other, especially for the kinds of activities in which the old sorcerers were invol ved. “What were thos e activities, don Juan?” “The old sorcerers called them the intricacies of the second attention or the grand adve nture of the unknow n.” Don Juan said that these activities stem from the displace ments of the assemblage poi nt. Not onl y had the old sorcerers learned to displace their assemblage poi nts to tho usands of pos itions on the surface or on the inside of their energy masses but they had also learned to fixate their assemblage poi nts on thos e pos itions , and thus retain their cohe siveness, inde finitely. “What was the benefit of that, don Juan?” “We can’t talk about benefits. We can talk onl y about end results.” He expl ained that the cohe siveness of the old sorcerers was such that it allow ed them to becom e perceptually and phys ically everything the specific pos ition of their assemblage poi nts dictated. The y coul d transform themselves into anyt hing for which they had a specific inve ntory. An inve ntory is, he said, all the details of perception invo lved in becom ing, for example, a jagua r, a bird, an insect, et cetera, et cetera. “It’s very hard for me to beli eve that this transformation can be pos sible,” I said. “It is pos sible,” he assured me. “Not so much for you and me, but for them. For them, it was not hing. ” He said that the old sorcerers had supe rb fluidity. All they needed was the slight est shift of the ir assemblage poi nts, the slight est perceptual cue from their dreaming, and they woul d instantaneous ly stalk their perception, rearrange their cohe siveness to fit their new state of awareness, and be an animal, anot her person, a bird, or anyt hing. “But isn ’t that what mentally ill peopl e do? Make up their ow n reality as they go along? ” I said. “No, it isn’t the same. Insane peopl e imagine a reality of their ow n because they don’ t have any preconc eived pur pos e at all. Insane peopl e bring chaos into the chaos . Sorcerers, on the cont rary, bring order to the chaos. Their preconc eived, transcende ntal pur pos e is to free their perception. Sorcerers don ’t make up the world they are perceiving; they perceive energy directly, and then they discove r that what they are perceiving is an unknow n new world, which can swallow them whol e, because it is as real as anyt hing we know to be real.” Don Juan then gave me a new version of what had happe ned to me as I gazed at the mesqui te tree. He said that I began by perceiving the energy of the tree. On the subj ective level, how ever, I believed I was dreaming because I employe d dreaming techni que s to perceive energy, He asserted that to use dreaming techni que s in the world of everyda y life was one of the old sorcerers’ most effecti ve devices. It made perceiving energy directly dreamlike, instead of totally chaotic, unt il a mom ent when som e thing rearrange d"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 perception and the sorcerer found himself facing a new world — the very thing that had happe ned to me. I told him about the though t I’d had, which I had barely dared to think: that the scenery I was viewing was not a dream, nor was it our daily world. “It wasn’t,” he said. “I’ve been saying this to you ove r and ove r, and you think that I am merely repeating myself. I know how difficu lt it is for the mind to allow mindl ess pos sibilities to becom e real. But new worlds exist! They are wrappe d one around the other, like the skins of an oni on. The world we exist in is but one of thos e skins.” “Do you mean, don Juan, that the goa l of your t eaching is to prepare me to go into thos e worlds?” “No. I don’ t mean that. We go into thos e worlds only as an exercise. Thos e jour neys are the antecedents of the sorcerers of toda y. We do the same dreaming that the old sorcerers used to do, but at one mom e nt we deviate into new ground. The old sorcerers preferred the shifts of the assemblage poi nt, so they were always on more or less know n, predictable ground. We prefer the move ments of the assemblage poi nt. The old sorcerers were after the hum an unknow n. W e are after the nonhum an unknow n.” “I haven’t got ten to that yet, have I?” “No. You are onl y beginni ng. And at the beginni ng everyone has to go through the old sorcerers’ steps. After all, they were the one s who inve nted dreaming. ” “At what poi nt will I th en begin to learn the new sorcerers’ brand of dreaming? ” “You have enor mous ground yet to cove r. Years from now perhaps. Besides, in your case, I have to be extraordinarily careful. In character, you are definitely linke d to the old sorcerers. I’ve said th is to you before, but you always manage to avoi d my probe s. Som etimes I even think that som e alien energy is advi sing you, but then I discard the idea. You are not devious .” “What are you talking about , don Juan?” “You’ ve done , unw ittingl y, two things that worry the hell out of me. You traveled with your energy body to a place out side this world the first time you dreamt. And you walked there! And then you traveled with you r energy bod y to anot her place out side this world, but parting from the awareness of the daily world.” “Why woul d that worry you , don Juan?” “Dreaming is too easy for you . And that is a damnation if we don’ t watch it. It leads to the hum an unknow n. As I said to you , mode rn - day sorcerers strive to get to the nonhum an unknow n.” “What can the nonhum an unknow n be?” “Freedom from being hum an. Inconc eivable worlds that are out side the band of man but that we still can perceive. This is where mode rn sorcerers take the side road. Their predilection is what’s out side the hum an dom ain. And what are o utside that dom ain are all - inclusive worlds, not merely the realm of birds or the realm of animals or the realm of"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 man, even if it be the unknow n man. What I am talking about are worlds, like the one where we live; total worlds with endl ess realms.” “Where are thos e worlds, don Juan? In different positions of the assemblage poi nt?” “Right . In different pos itions of the assemblage poi nt, but pos itions sorcerers arrive at with a move ment of the assemblage poi nt, not a shift. Entering into thos e worlds is the type of dreaming onl y sorcerers of toda y do. The old sorcerers stayed away from it, because it requi res a great deal of detachm ent and no self - impor tance whatsoever. A price they coul dn’ t afford to pay. “For the sorcerers who practice dreaming toda y, dream ing is freedom to perceive worlds beyond the imagination. ” “But, what’s the poi nt of perceiving all that?” “You already asked me, toda y, the same que stion. You speak like a true merchant. What’s the risk? you ask, What’s the percentage gain to my inve stmen t? Is it goi ng to better me? “There is no way to answer that. The merchant mind doe s com merce. But freedom cannot be an inve stment. Freedom is an adve nture with no end, in which we risk our lives and much more for a few mom ents of som ething beyond words, b eyond thought s or feelings .” “I didn’ t ask that que stion in that spirit, don Juan. What I want to know is what can be the driving force to do all this for a lazy bum like myself?” “To seek freedom is the onl y driving force I know . Freedom to fly off into t hat infinity out there. Freedom to dissolve; to lift off; to be like the flame of a candl e, which, in spite of being up against the light of a billion stars, remains intact, because it never pretende d to be more than what it is: a mere candl e.” CHAPTER 5 THE WORLD OF INORGANIC BEINGS Faithful to my agreement to wait for don Juan to initiate any com ment on dreaming, onl y in cases of necessity did I ask him for advi ce. Ordinarily, though, he not only seemed reluctant to touc h the subj ect but was som ehow di spleased with me about it. In my estimation, a conf irmation of his disappr ova l was the fact that whenever we talked about my dreaming activities, he always minimized the impor t of anyt hing I had accom plished. For me, at that time, the animate existence of inorganic beings had becom e the most crucial aspect of my dreaming practices. After encount ering them in my dreams, and especially after my bout with them in the desert around don Juan’s, hous e, I shoul d have been more willing to take their existence as a serious affair. But all these events had qui te the oppos ite effect on me. I became adamant and dogge dly denied the pos sibility that they existed."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 Then I had a change of heart and decided to conduc t an obj ective inqui ry about them. The method of this inqui r y requi red that I first com pile a record of everything that transpired in my dreaming sessions , then use that record as a matrix to find out if my dreaming prove d or disprove d anyt hing about the inorganic beings . I actually wrote dow n hundr eds of pages of meticulous but meaningl ess details, when it shoul d have been clear to me that the evidence of their existence had been gathered almost as soon as I had started my inqui ry It took but a few sessions for me to discove r that what I though t to be don Juan’s ca sual recom menda tion — to suspend judgm ent and let the inor ganic beings com e to me — was, in fact, the very procedur e used by the sorcerers of antiqui ty to attract them. By leaving me to find it out for myself, don Juan was simply follow ing his sorcery training . He had remarked time and time again that it is very difficult to make the self give up its stronghol ds except through practice. One of the self’s stronge st lines of defense is inde ed our rationa lity and this is not onl y the most dur able line of defense w hen it com es to sorcery actions and expl anations but also the most threatened. Don Juan believed that the existence of inor ganic beings is a foremost assailant of our rationa lity. In my dreaming practices, I had an established cour se, which I follow ed ever y singl e day without deviation. I aimed first at obs erving every conc eivable item of my dreams, then at changi ng dreams. I can say in sincerity that I observed uni verses of detail in dreams upon dreams. As a matter of cour se, at one given mom ent my dreamin g attention began to wane, and my dreaming sessions ende d either in my falling asleep and having regul ar dreams, in which I had no dreaming attention whatsoever, or in my waking up and not being able to sleep at all. From time to time, how ever, as don Juan had described it, a current of foreign energy, a scout , as he called it, was injected into my dreams. Being forewarned helped me to adjust my dreaming attention and be on the alert. The first time I not iced foreign energy, I was dreaming about shop ping i n a department store.. I was goi ng from count er to count er looki ng for antique s. I finally found one . The incongr uence of looki ng for antique s in a department store was so obvi ous that it made me chuc kle, but since I had found one , I forgot about that inco ngruence. The antique was the handl e of a walking stick. The salesman told me that it was made of iridium , which he called one of the hardest subs tances in the world. It was a carved piece: the head and shoul ders of a monke y. It looke d like jade to me. The salesman was insulted when I insinua ted that it might be jade, and to prove his poi nt he hur led the obj ect, with all his strengt h, against the cement floor . It did not break but bounc ed like a ball and then sailed away, spinni ng like a Frisbee. I follow ed it. It disappe ared behind som e trees. I ran to look for it, and I found it, stuck on the ground. It had been transformed into an extraordinarily beautiful, deep green and black, full - lengt h walking stick. I cove ted it. I grabbe d it and struggl ed to pul l i t out of the ground before anyone else came along. But, hard as I tried, I coul d not make it budge . I was afraid I woul d break it if I attempted to pry it loos e by shaking it back and forth. So I began to dig around it with my bare hands . As I kept on digg ing, it kept on melting, unt il onl y a puddl e of green water was left in its place. I stared at the water; it sudde nly seemed to expl ode . It turned into a white bubb le, and then it was gone . My dream cont inue d into other images and details, which were not o ut standi ng, although they were crystal clear."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 When I told don Juan about this dream, he said, “You isolated a scout . Scout s are more num erous when our dreams are average, nor mal ones. The dreams of dreamers are strange ly free from scout s. When they appe ar , they are identifiable by the strange ness and incongr uity surroundi ng them.” “Incongr uity, in what manne r, don Juan?” “Their presence doe sn’t make any sense.” “Very few things make sense in a dream.” “Only in average dreams are things nons ensical. I woul d say that this is so because more scout s are injected then, because average peopl e are ‘subj ect to a greater barrage from the unknow n.” “Do you know why is that so, don Juan?” “In my opi nion, what takes place is a balance of forces. Aver age peopl e have st upe ndous ly strong barriers to protect them selves against thos e ons laught s. Barriers such as worries about the self. The stronge r the barrier, the greater the attack. “Dreamers, by cont rast, have fewer barriers and fewer scout s in their dreams. It seems th at in dreamers’ dreams nons ensical things disappe ar, perhaps to ensure that dreamers catch the presence of scout s.” Don Juan advi sed me to pay close attention and remember every singl e pos sible detail of the dream I had had. He even made me repeat what I h ad told him. “You baffle me,” I said. “You don ’t want to hear anyt hing about my dreaming, and then you do. Is there any order to you r refusals and acceptances?” “You bet there is order behind all this,” he said. “Chances are, you’ ll do the same som eday to anot her dreamer. Some items are of key impor tance because they are associated with the spirit. Others are entirely uni mpor tant by reason of being associated with our indul ging persona lity “The first scout you isolate will always be present, in any form, ev en iridium . By the way, what’s iridium ?” “I don’ t really know ,” I said in total sincerity “There you are! And what will you say if it turns out to be one of the stronge st subs tances in the world?” Don Juan’s eyes shone with delight , while I nervously laugh ed at that absurd pos sibility, which, I learned later, is true. I began to not ice from then on the presence of incongr uous items in my dreams. Once I had accepted don Juan’s categor ization of foreign energy in dreams, I totally agreed with him that incongr uous items were foreign inva ders of my dreams. Upon isolating them, my dreaming attention always focused on them with an intensity that did not occur unde r any other circum stances. Anot her thing I not iced was that every time foreign energy inva ded my dream s, my dreaming attention had to work hard to turn it into a know n obj ect. The handi cap of my"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 dreaming attention was its inability to accom plish fully such a transformation; the end result was a bastardized item, nearly un know n to me. The foreign energy th en dissipated qui te easily; the bastardized item vanished, turning into a blob of light , which was qui ckly absorbed by other pressing details of my dreams. When I asked don Juan to com ment on what was happe ning to me, he said, “At this poi nt in your dreami ng, scout s are reconnoi terers sent by the inor ganic realm. They are very fast, meaning that they don’ t stay long .” “Why do you say that they are reconnoi terers, don Juan?” “They com e in search of pot ential awareness. They have cons cious ness and pur pos e, al though it is incom prehensible to our minds , com parable perhaps to the cons cious ness and pur pos e of trees. The inne r speed of trees and inor ganic beings is incom prehensible to us because it is infinitely slow er than our s.” “What makes you say that, don Juan ?” “Both trees and inor ganic beings last longe r than we do. They are made to stay put . They are immobi le, yet they make everything move around them.” “Do you mean, don Juan, that inor ganic beings are stationa ry like trees?” “Certainly. What you see in drea ming as bright or dark sticks are their projections . What you hear as the voi ce of the dreaming emissary is equa lly their projection. And so are their scout s.” For som e unf athom able reason, I was ove rwhelmed by these statements. I was sudde nly filled with anxi ety. I asked don Juan if trees also had projections like that. “They do, ” he said. “Their projections are, how ever, even less friendl y to us than thos e of the inor ganic beings . Dreamers never seek them, unless they are in a state of profound amenity wi th trees, which is a very difficult state to attain. We have no friends on this earth, you know .” He chuc kled and adde d, “It’s no mystery why. ” “It may not be a mystery to you, don Juan, but it certainly is to me.” “We are destructive. We have antagoni zed every living being on this earth. That’s why we have no friends .” I felt so ill at ease that I wanted to stop the conve rsation altoge ther. But a com pul sive urge made me return to the subj ect of inorganic beings . “What do you think I shoul d do to follow the scout s?” I asked. “Why in the world woul d you want to follow them?” “I am conduc ting an obj ective inqui ry about inor ganic beings .” “You’ re pul ling my leg, aren’t you? I thought you were unm ova ble on you r stand that inor ganic beings don’ t exist.” His scoff ing tone and cackling laught er told me what his thought s and feelings about my obj ective inqui ry were. “I’ve change d my mind, don Juan. Now I want to expl ore all thos e pos sibilities.”"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 “Remember, the realm of inor ganic beings was the old sorcerers’ field. T o get there, they tenacious ly fixed their dreaming attention on the items of their dreams. In that fashion, they were able to isolate the scout s. And when they had the scout s in focus, they shout ed their intent to follow them. The instant the old sorcerers voi ced that intent, off they went, pul led by that foreign energy” “Is it that simple, don Juan?” 88 • CARLOS CASTANEDA THE ART OF DREAMINQ .89 He did not answer. He just laughe d at me as if daring me to do it. At hom e, I tired of searching for don Juan’s true meanings . I was thor oughl y unw illing to cons ider that he might have described an actual procedur e. After runni ng out of ideas and patience, one day I let my gua rd dow n. In a dream I was having then, I was baffled by a fish that had sudde nly jumped out of a pond I was walking by. The fish twitched by my feet, then flew like a colored bird, perching on a branch, still being a fish. The scene was so out landi sh that my dreaming attention was galvanized. I instantly kne w it was a scout . A second later, when the fish - bird turned into a poi nt of light , I shout ed my intent to follow it, and, just as don Juan had said, off I went into anot her world. I flew through a seemingl y dark tunne l as if I were a weight less flying insect. The sensation of a tunne l ende d ab ruptly. It was exactly as if I had been spewed out of a tube and the impul se had left me smack against an immense phys ical mass; I was almost touc hing it. I coul d not see the end of it in any direction I looke d. The entire thing reminde d me so much of scie nce fiction movi es that I was utterly convi nced I was cons tructing the view of that mass myself, as one cons tructs a dream. Why not ? The thought I had was that, after all, I was asleep, dreaming. I settled dow n to obs erve the details of my dream. What I wa s viewing looke d very much like a gigantic sponge . It was por ous and cavernou s. I coul d not feel its texture, but it looke d rough and fibrous . It was dark brow nish in color. Then I had a mom entary jolt of doubt about that silent mass being just a dream. Wh at I was facing did not change shape. It did not move either. As I looke d at it fixedly, I had the com plete impression of som ething real but stationa ry; it was planted som ewhere, and it had such a pow erful attraction that I was incapable of deviating my dr eaming attention to examine any thing else, includi ng myself. Som e strange force, which I had never before encount ered in my dreaming, had me riveted dow n. Then I clearly felt that the mass released my dreaming attention; all my awareness focused on the sc out that had taken me there. It looked like a firefly in the darkne ss, hove ring ove r me, by my side. In its realm, it was a blob of sheer energy. I was able to see its energetic sizzling. It seemed to be cons cious of me. Sudde nly, it lurched ont o me and tu gge d me or prodde d me. I did not feel its touch, yet I kne w it was touc hing me. That sensation was startling and new; it was as if a part of me that was not there had been electrified by that touc h; rippl es of energy went through it, one after anot her. Fro m that mom ent on, everything in my dreaming became much more real. I had a very difficult time keeping the idea that I was dreaming a dream. To this difficulty. I had to"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 add the certainty I had that with its touc h the scout had made an energetic conne ction with me. I kne w what it wanted me to do the instant it seemed to tug me or shove me. The first thing it did was to pus h me through a hug e cavern or ope ning into the phys ical mass I had been facing. Once I was inside that mass, I realized that the interior was as hom oge neous ly por ous as the out side but much softer looki ng, as if the roughne ss had been sande d dow n. What I was facing was a structure that looke d som ething like the enlarged picture of a beehive. There were count less geom etric - shaped tunne ls goi ng in every direction. Som e went up or dow n, or to my left or my right ; they were at angl es with one anot her, or goi ng up or dow n on steep or mild inclines. The light was very dim, yet everything was perfectly visible. The tunne ls seemed to be alive and co nscious ; they sizzled. I stared at them, and the realization that I was seeing hit me. Thos e were tunne ls of energy. At the instant of this realization, the voi ce of the dreaming emissary roared inside my ears, so loudl y I coul d not unde rstand what it said . “Low er it dow n,” I yelled with unus ual impatience and became aware that if I spoke I blocked my view of the tunne ls and entered into a vacuum where all I coul d do was hear. The emissary modul ated its voi ce and said, “You are inside an inorganic being. Ch oos e a tunne l and you can even live in it.” The voi ce stopped for an instant, then adde d, “That is, if you want to do it.” I coul d not bring myself to say anyt hing. I was afraid that any statement of mine might be cons trued as the oppos ite of what I meant. “There are endl ess adva ntages for you ,” the emissary’s voi ce cont inue d. “You can live in as many tunne ls as you want. And each one of them will teach som ething different. The sorcerers of antiqui ty lived in this manne r and learned marvelous things .” I sen sed without any feeling that the scout was pus hing me from behind. It appe ared to want me to move onw ard. I took the tunne l to my immediate right . As soon as I was in it, som e thing made me aware that I was not walking on the tunne l; I was hove ring in it, flying. I was a blob of energy no different from the scout . The voi ce of the emissary sounde d inside my ears again. “Yes, you are just a blob of energy, ” it said. Its redunda ncy brought me an intense relief. “And you are floating inside one inor ganic being ,” it went on. “This is the way the scout wants you to move in this world. When it touc hed you , it change d you forever. You are practically one of us now . If you want to stay here, just voi ce your intent.” The emissary stoppe d talking, and the view of the tunne l returned to me. But when it spoke again, som ething had been adjusted; I did not lose sight of that world and I still coul d hear the emissary’s voi ce. “The ancient sorcerers learned everything they kne w about dreaming by staying here among us,” it sa id. I was goi ng to ask if they had learned everything they kne w by just living inside thos e tunne ls, but before I voi ced my que stion the emissary answered it. “Yes, they learned everything by just living inside the inor ganic beings ,” it said. “To live insi de them, all the old sorcerers had to do was say they wanted to, just like all it took for you to get here was to voice your intent, loud and clear.”"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 The scout pus hed against me to signa l me to cont inue movi ng. I hesitated, and it did som ething equi valent to shovi ng me with such a force that I shot like a bul let through endl ess tunne ls. I finally stoppe d because the scout stoppe d. We hove red for an instant; then we droppe d into a vertical tunne l. I did not feel the drastic change of direction. As far as my perception was conc erned, I was still moving seemingl y parallel to the ground. We change d directions many times with the same perceptual effect on me. I began to formulate a thought about my incapacity to feel that I was movi ng up or dow n when I heard the emissary’s voi ce. “I think you’ ll be more com fortable if you crawl rather than fly,” it said. “You can also move like a spider or a fly, straight up or dow n or ups ide dow n.” Instantaneous ly, I settled dow n. It was as if I had been fluffy and sudde nly I got som e weight , which grounde d me. I coul d not feel the tunne l’s walls, but the emissary was right about my being more com fortable when crawling. “In this world you don ’t have to be pinne d dow n by gravity it said. Of cour se, I was able to realize that myself . “You don’ t have to breathe either,” the voice went on. “And, for your conve nience alone , you can retain your eyesight and see as you see in you r world.” The emissary seemed to be deciding whether to add more. It coughe d, just like a man clearing his thro at, and said, “The eyesight is never impaired; therefore, a dreamer always speaks about his dreaming in terms of what he sees.” The scout pus hed me into a tunne l to my right . It was som e how darker than the others. To me, at a prepos terous level, it seemed cozier than the others, more friendl y or even know n to me. The thought crossed my mind that I was like that tunne l or that the tunne l was like me. “You two have met before,” the emissary’s voi ce said. “I beg your pardon ,” I said. I had unde rstood what it said, but the statement was incom prehensible. “You two wrestled, and because of that you now carry each other’s energy. ” I though t that the emissary’s voi ce carried a touc h of malice or even sarcasm. “No, it isn’t sarcasm,” the emissary said. “I am glad th at you have relatives here among us.” “What do you mean by relatives?” I asked. “Shared energy makes kinship,” it replied. “Energy is like blood .” I was una ble to say anyt hing else. I clearly felt pangs of fear. “Fear is som ething that is absent in this wo rld,” the emissary said. And that was the onl y statement that was not true. My dreaming ende d there. I was so shoc ked by the vividne ss of everything, and by the impressive clarity and cont inui ty of the emissary’s statements, that I coul d not wait to tell d on Juan. It surprised and disturbed me that he did not want to hear my account . He did not say so, but I had the impression that he believed all of it had been a produc t of my indul ging persona lity."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60 “Why are you behaving like this with me?” I asked. “Are y ou displeased with me?” “No. I am not displeased with you, ” he said. “The probl em is that I can’t talk about this part of your dreaming. You are com pletely by you rself in this case. I have said to you that inor ganic beings are real. You are findi ng out how real they are. But what you do with this findi ng is your bus iness, your s alone . Som eday you’ ll see the reason for my staying away.” “But isn’t there som ething you can tell me about that dream?” I insisted. “What I can say is that it wasn’t a dream. It was a jour ney into the unknow n. A necessary jour ney, I may add, and an ultrapersona l one .” He change d the subj ect then and began to talk about other aspects of his teachings . From that day on, in spite of my fear and don Juan’s reluctance to advi se me, I beca me a regul ar dream traveler to that spongy world. I discove red right away that the greater my capacity to obs erve the details of my dreams, the greater my facility to isolate the scout s. If I chos e to acknow ledge the scout s as foreign energy, they remained within my perceptual field for a while. Now , if I chos e to turn the scout s into qua si know n obj ects, they stayed even longe r, changi ng shapes erratically. But if I follow ed them, by revealing out loud my intent to go with them, the scout s veritably transp orted my dreaming attention to a world beyond what I can nor mally imagine. Don Juan had said that inorganic beings are always poi sed to teach. But he had not told me that dreaming is what they are poi sed to teach. He had stated that the dreaming emissary, since it is a voi ce, is the perfect bridge between that world and our s. I found out that the dreaming emissary was not onl y a teacher’s voi ce but the voi ce of a most subt le salesman. It repeated on and on, at the prope r time and occasion, the adva ntages of its world. Yet it also taught me inva luable things abou t dreaming. Listening to what it said, I unde rstood the old sorcerers’ preference for conc rete practices. “For perfect dreaming, the first thing you have to do is shut off your internal dialogue ,” it said to me one time, “For best results in shut ting it off, put between you r finge rs som e two - or three - inch - long qua rtz crystals or a coupl e of smoot h, thin river pebbl es. Bend your finge rs slight ly, and press the crystals or pebbles with them.” The emissa ry said that metal pins, if they were the size and width of one ’s finge rs, were equa lly effective. The procedur e cons isted of pressing at least three thin items between the finge rs of each hand and creating, an almost painful pressure m the hands . This pre ssure had the strange prope rty of shut ting off the internal dialogue . The emissary’s expr essed preference was for qua rtz crystals; it said that they gave the best results, although with practice anyt hing was suitable. “Falling asleep at a mom ent of total s ilence gua rantees a perfect entrance into dreaming, ” said the emissary’s voi ce, “and it also gua rantees the enha ncing of one ’s dreaming attention. ” “Dreamers shoul d wear a gol d ring, ” said the emissary to me anot her time, “preferably fitted a bit tight .”"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61 T he emissary’s expl anation was that such a ring serves as a bridge for surfacing from dreaming back into the daily world or for sinki ng from our daily awareness into the inor ganic beings ’ realm. “How doe s this bridge work?” I asked. I had not unde rstood wha t was invol ved. “The cont act of the finge rs on the ring lays the bridge dow n,” the emissary said. “If a dreamer com es into my world wearing a ring, that ring attracts the energy of my world and keeps it; and when it’s needed, that energy transpor ts the dre amer back to this world, by the ring releasing it into the dreamer’s finge rs. “The pressure of that ring around a finge r serves equa lly well to ensure a dreamer’s return to his world. It gives him a cons tant, familiar sense on his finge r.” During anot her d reaming session, the emissary said that our skin is the perfect organ for transpos ing energy waves from the mode of the daily world to the mode of the inorganic beings and vice versa. It recom mende d that I keep my skin cool and free from pigm ents or oils. It also recom mende d that dreamers wear a tight belt or headba nd or necklace to create a pressure poi nt that serves as a skin center of energy exchange . The emissary expl ained that the skin autom atically screens energy, and that what we need to do to make t he skin not only screen but exchange energy from one mode to the other is to expr ess our intent out loud, in dreaming. One day the emissary’s voi ce gave me a fabul ous bonus . It said that, in order to ensure the keenne ss and accuracy of our dreaming attenti on, we must bring it from behind the roof of the mout h, where an enormous reservoi r of attention is located in all hum an beings . The emissary’s specific directions were to practice and learn the discipline and cont rol necessary to press the tip of the tong ue on the roof of the mout h while dreaming. This task is as difficult and cons um ing, the emissary said, as findi ng one ’s hands in a dream. But, onc e it is accom plished, this task gives the most astoundi ng results in terms of cont rolling the dreaming attent ion. I received a profusion of instructions on every conceivable subj ect, instructions that I prom ptly forgot if they were not endl essly repeated to me. I sought don Juan’s advi ce on how to resolve this probl em of forgetting. His com ment was as brief as I had expe cted. “Focus onl y on what the emissary tells you about dreaming, ” he said. Whatever the emissary’s voi ce repeated enough times, I grasped with tremendous interest and fervor . Faithful to don Juan’s recom menda tion, I onl y follow ed its gui dance when it referred to dreaming and I persona lly corrobor ated the value of its instruction. The most vital piece of information for me was that the dreaming attention com es from behind the roof of the mout h. It took a great deal of effort on my part to feel in dre aming that I was pressing the roof of my mout h with the tip of my tongue . Once I accom plished this, my dreaming attention took on a life of its ow n and became, I may say, keener than my nor mal attention to the daily world. It did not take much for me to de duc e how deep must have been the invol vement of the old sorcerers with the inor ganic beings . Don Juan’s com mentaries and warnings about the dange r of such an invol vement became more vital than ever. I tried my best to live up to his standa rds of self - exami nation with no indu lgence. Thus , the emissary’s voi ce and"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 what it said became a supe rchallenge for me. I had to avoi d, at all cost, succum bing to the temptation of the emissary’s prom ise of know ledge, and I had to do this all by myself since don Juan cont i nue d to refuse to listen to my account s. “You must give me at least a hint about what I should do, ” I insisted on one occasion when I was bol d enough to ask him. “I can’t,” he said with finality “and don’ t ask again. I’ve told you, in this instance, dreame rs have to be left alone .” “But you don’ t even know what I want to ask you .” “Oh yes I do. You want me to tell you that it is all right to live in one of thos e tunne ls, if for no other reason than just to know what the emissary’s voi ce is talking about .” I adm itted that this was exactly my dilemma. If not hing else, I wanted to know what was implied in the statement that one can live inside those tunne ls. “I went through the same turmoil myself,” don Juan went on, “and no one coul d help me, because this is a supe rpersona l and final decision, a final decision made the instant you voi ce your desire to live in that world. In order to get you to voi ce that desire, the inor ganic beings are goi ng to cater to you r most secret wishes.” “This is really diabol ical, don Juan.” “You can say that again. But not just because of what you are thinki ng. For you, the diabol ical part is the temptation to give in, especially when such great rewards are at stake. For me, the diabol ical nature of the inor ganic beings ’ realm is that it might very well be the onl y sanctuary dreamers have in a hos tile uni verse.” “Is it really a haven for dreamers, don Juan?” “It definitely is for som e dreamers. Not for me. I don’ t need props or railings . I know what I am. I am alone in a hos tile uni ver se, and I have learned to say, So be it!” That was the end of our exchange . He had not said what I wanted to hear, yet I kne w that even the desire to know what it was like to live in a tunne l meant almost to choos e that way of life. I was not interested in such a thing. I made my decision right then to cont inue my dreaming practices without any further implications . I qui ckly told don Juan about it. “Don’ t say anyt hing, ” he advi sed me. “But do und erstand that if you choos e to stay, your decision is final. Y ou’ll stay there forever.” It is impos sible for me to judge obj ectively what took place dur ing the count less times I dreamt of that world. I can say that it appe ared to be a world as real as any dream can be real. Or I can say that it appe ared to be as rea l as our daily world is real. Dreaming of that world, I became aware of what don Juan had said to me many times: that unde r the influence of dreaming, reality suffers a metamorphosis. I found myself then facing the two opt ions which; according to don Juan, are the opt ions faced by all dreamers: either we carefully revamp or we com pletely disregard our system of sensory input interpretation. For don Juan, to revamp our interpretation system meant to intend its recondi tioni ng. It meant that one deliberately a nd carefully attempts to enlarge its capabilities. By living in"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 accordance with the sorcerers’ way, dreamers save and store the necessary energy to suspend judgm ent and thus facilitate that intende d revamping. He expl ained that if we choos e to recondi tion our interpretation system, reality becom es fluid, and the scope of what can be real is enha nced without enda nge ring the integrity of reality. Dreaming, then, inde ed ope ns the door into other aspects of what is real. If we choos e to disregard our system, th e scope of what can be perceived without interpretation grow s inor dinately. The expa nsion of our perception is so gigantic that we are left with very few tool s for sensory interpretation and, thus , a sense of an infinite realness that is unr eal or an infin ite unr ealness that coul d very well be real but is not . For me, the only acceptable opt ion was recons tructing and enlarging my interpretation system. In dreaming the inorganic beings ’ realm, I was faced with the cons istence of that world from dream to drea m, from isolating the scout s through listening to the dreaming emissary’s voi ce to goi ng through tunne ls. I went through them without feeling anyt hing, yet being aware that space and time were cons tant, although not in terms discernible by rationa lity unde r nor mal condi tions . How ever, by not icing the difference or the absence or profusion of detail in each tunne l, or by not icing the sense of distance between tunne ls, or by not icing the appa rent lengt h or width of each tunne l in which I traveled, I arrived a t a sense of obj ective obs ervation. The area where this recons truction of my interpretation system had the most dramatic effect was the know ledge of how I related to the world of the inorganic beings . In that world, which was real to me, I was a blob of en ergy Thus , I coul d whiz in the tunne ls, like a fast - movi ng light , or I coul d crawl on their walls, like an insect. If I flew, a voi ce told me not arbitrary but cons istent information about details on the walls on which I had focused my dreaming attention. Thos e details were intricate protube rances, like the Braille system of writing. When I crawled on the walls, I coul d see the same details with greater accuracy and hear the voi ce giving me more com plex descriptions . The una voi dable cons eque nce for me was t he developm ent of a dua l stand. On the one hand, I kne w I was dreaming a dream; on the other, I kne w I was invol ved in a pragm atic jour ney, as real as any jour ney in the world. This bona fide split was a corrobor ation of what don Juan had said: that the ex istence of inor ganic beings is the foremost assailant of our ration alit Only after I had really suspende d judgm ent did I get any relief. At one mom ent, when the tension of my unt enable pos ition — serious ly believing in the attestable existence of inor ganic beings , while serious ly believing that it was onl y a dream — was about to destroy me, som ething in my attitude change d drastically, but without any solicitation on my part. Don Juan maintained that my energy level, which had been steadily grow ing, one day re ached a threshol d that allow ed me to disregard assum ptions and prejudgm ents about the nature of man, reality, and perception. That day I became enamored with know ledge , regardless of logi c or func tiona l value, and, above all, regardless of persona l conve ni ence."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 When my obj ective inqui ry into the subj ect of inor ganic beings no longe r mattered to me, don Juan himself brought up the subj ect of my dream jour ney into that world. He said, “1 don’ t think you are aware of the regul arity of you r meetings with inor ga nic beings .” He was right . I had never bot hered to think about it. I com mented on the oddi ty of my ove rsight . “It isn’t an ove rsight ,” he said. “It’s the nature of that realm to foster secretiveness. Inor ganic beings veil themselves in mystery, darkness. T hink about their world: stationa ry, fixed to draw us like moths to a light or a fire. “There is som ething the emissary hasn’t dared to tell you so far: that the inorganic beings are after our awareness or the awareness of any being that falls into their ne ts. They’ll give us know ledge , but they’ll extract a paym ent: our total being. ” “Do you mean, don Juan, that the inorganic beings are like fishermen?” “Exactly. At one mom ent, the emissary will show you men who got caught in there or other beings that are not human that also got caugh t in there.” Revul sion and fear shoul d have been my respons e. Don Juan’s revelations affected me deeply, but in the sense of creating unc ont ainable curiosity. I was nearly panting. “Inor ganic beings can’t force anyone to stay w ith them,” don Juan went on. “To live in their world is a vol unt ary affair Yet they are capable of imprisoni ng any one of us by catering to our desires, by pampering and indul ging us. Beware of awareness that is immobi le. Awareness like that has to seek mo vement, and it doe s this, as I’ve told you , by creating projections , pha ntasmagor ical projections at times.” I asked don Juan to expl ain what “pha ntasmagor ical projections ” meant. He said that inor ganic beings hook ont o dreamers’ inne rmost feelings and pla y them mercilessly. They create pha ntom s to please dreamers or fright en them. He reminde d me that I had wrestled with one of thos e pha ntom s. He expl ained that inorganic beings are supe rb projectioni sts, who delight in projecting themselves like pictures on the wall. “The old sorcerers were brought dow n by their inane trust in thos e projections ,” he cont inue d. “The old sorcerers believed their allies had pow er. They ove rlooke d the fact their allies were tenuous energy projected through worlds, like in a cosm ic movie.” “You are cont radicting you rself, don Juan. You yourself said that the inor ganic beings are real. Now you tell me that they are mere pictures.” “I meant to say that the inor ganic beings , in our world, are like movi ng pictures projected on a scree n; and I may even add that they are like movi ng pictures of rarefied energy projected through the bounda ries of two worlds.” “But what about inor ganic beings in their world? Are they also like movi ng pictures?” “Not a chance. That world is as real as our w orld. The old sorcerers portrayed the inor ganic beings ’ world as a blob of caverns and pores floating in som e dark space. And they por trayed the inor ganic beings as hol low canes bound toge ther, like the cells of our bodi es. The old sorcerers called that im mense bun dle the labyr inth of penum bra.” “Then every dreamer sees that world in the same terms, right ?”"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 “Of cour se. Every dreamer sees it as it is. Do you think you are uni que ?” I conf essed that som ething in that world had been giving me all along the sens ation I was uni que . What created this most pleasant and clear feeling of being exclusive was not the voi ce of the dreaming emissary, or anyt hing I coul d cons cious ly think about . “That’s exactly what floor ed the old sorcerers,” don Juan said. “The inor ganic beings did to them what they are doing to you now ; they created for them the sense of being uni que , exclusive; plus a more pernicious sense yet: the sense of having pow er. Pow er and uni que ness are unbe atable as corrupt ing forces. Watch out !” “How did you avoi d that dange r your self, don Juan?” “I went to that world a few times, and then I never went back.” Don Juan expl ained that in the opi nion of sorcerers, the universe is predatorial, and sorcerers more than anyone else have to take this into account in t heir daily sorcery activities. His idea was that cons cious ness is intrinsically com pelled to grow , and the onl y way it can grow is through strife, through life - or - death conf ront ations . “The awareness of sorcerers grow s when they do dreaming, ” he went on. “ And the mom ent it grow s, som ething out there acknow ledge s its grow th, recogni zes it and makes a bid for it. The inorganic beings are the bidde rs for that new, enha nced awareness. Dreamers have to be forever on their toes. They are prey the mom ent they vent ure out in that predatorial uni verse.” “What do you sugge st I do to be safe, don Juan?” “Be on your toes every second! Don’ t let anyt hing or any body decide for you. Go to the inor ganic beings ’ world onl y when you want to go.” “Hone stly, don Juan, I woul dn ’t know how to do that. Once I isolate a scout , a tremendous pul l is exerted on me to go. I don’ t have a chance in hell to change my mind. ” “Com e on! Who do you think you’ re kiddi ng? You can definitely stop it. You haven’t tried to, that’s all.” I earnestl y insisted that it was impos sible for me to stop. He did not pur sue the subj ect any longe r, and I was thankf ul for that. A disturbing feeling of gui lt had begun to gna w at me. For som e unknow n reason, the though t of conscious ly stoppi ng the pul l of the sco uts had never occurred to me. As usual, don Juan was correct. I found out that I coul d change the cour se of my dreaming by intendi ng that course. After all, I did intend for the scout s to transpor t me to their world. It was feasible that if I deliberately intende d the oppos ite, my dreaming woul d follow the oppos ite cour se. With practice, my capacity to intend my jour neys into the inorganic beings ’ realm became extraordinarily keen. An increased capacity to intend brought forth an increased cont rol ove r my d reaming attention. This addi tiona l cont rol made me more daring. I felt that I coul d jour ney with impun ity, because I coul d stop the journey any time I wanted to."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66 “Your conf idence is very scary” was don Juan’s com ment when I told him, at his reque st, about the new aspect of my cont rol ove r my dreaming attention. “Why shoul d it be scary?” I asked. I was truly convinced of the practical value of what I had found out . “Because your s is the conf idence of a fool,” he said. “I am goi ng to tell you a sorcerers’ sto ry that is apropos . I didn’ t witness it myself, but my teacher’s teacher, the nagua l Elias, did.” Don Juan said that the nagua l Elias and the love of his life, a sorceress named Amalia, were lost, in their yout h, in the inor ganic beings ’ world. I had never heard don Juan talk about sorcerers being the love of anybody’ s life. His statement startled me. I asked him about this inconsistency. “It’s not an incons istency. I have simply refrained all along from telling you stories of sorcerers’ affection, ” he said . “You’ ve been so ove rsaturated with love all your life that I wanted to give you a break. “Well, the nagua l Elias and the love of his life, the witch Amalia, got lost in the inorganic beings ’ world,” don Juan went on. “They went there not in dreaming but with their phys ical bodi es.” “How did that happe n, don Juan?” “Their teacher, the nagua l Rosendo, was very close in temperament and practice to the old sorcerers. He intende d to help Elias and Amalia, but instead he pus hed them across som e deadly bounda rie s. The nagua l Rosendo didn’t have that crossing in mind. What he wanted to do was to put his two disciples into the second attention, but what he got as a result was their disappe arance.” Don Juan said that he was not going to go into the details of that l ong and com plicated story. He was onl y goi ng to tell me how they became lost in that world. He stated that the nagua l Rosendo’ s miscalculation was to assum e that the inor ganic beings are not , in the slight est, interested in wom en. His reasoni ng was correct and was gui ded by the sorcerers’ know ledge that the uni verse is markedly female and that maleness, being an offshoot of femaleness, is almost scarce, thus , coveted. Don Juan made a digression and com mented that perhaps that scarcity of males is the reason for men’s unw arranted dom inion on our planet. I wanted to remain on that topic, but he went ahead with his story He said that the nagua l Rosendo’ s plan was to give instruction to Elias and Amalia exclusively in the second attention. And to that effect, he follow ed the old sorcerers’ prescribed techni que . He enga ged a scout , in dreaming, and com mande d it to transpor t his disciples into the second attention by displacing their assemblage poi nts on the prope r pos ition. Theoretically, a pow erful scout coul d di splace their assemblage poi nts on the prope r pos ition with no effort at all. What the nagua l Rosendo did not take into cons ideration was the trickery of the inor ganic beings . The scout did displace the assemblage poi nts of his disciples, but it displaced t hem on a pos ition from which it was easy to transpor t them bodi ly into the realm of the inor ganic beings ."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 “Is this pos sible, to be transpor ted bodi ly?” I asked. “It is pos sible,” he assured me. “We are energy that is kept in a specific shape and pos ition b y the fixation of the assemblage poi nt on one location. If that location is change d, the shape and pos ition of that energy will change accordingl y. All the inor ganic beings have to do is to place our assemblage poi nt on the right location, and off we go, l ike a bul let, shoe s, hat, and all.” “Can this happe n to any one of us, don Juan?” “Most certainly. Especially if our sum total of energy is right . Obvi ous ly, the sum total of the com bined energies of Elias and Amalia was som ething the inorganic beings coul dn’ t ove rlook. It is absurd to trust the inorganic beings . They have their ow n rhyt hm and it isn’t hum an.” I asked don Juan what exactly the nagua l Rosendo did to send his disciples to that world. kne w it was stupi d of me to ask, know ing that he was goi ng to ignor e my que stion. My surprise was genui ne when he began to tell me. “The steps are simplicity itself,” he said. “He put his disciples inside a very small, closed space, som ething like a closet. Then he went into dreaming, called a scout from the inor g anic beings ’ realm by voi cing his intent to get one , then voi ced his intent to offer his disciples to the scout . “The scout , naturally, accepted the gift and took them away, at an ungua rded mom ent, when they were making love inside that closet. When the na gua l ope ned the closet, they were no longe r there.” Don Juan expl ained that making gifts of their disciples to the inor ganic beings was precisely what the old sorcerers used to do. The nagua l Rosendo did not mean to do that, but he got swayed by the absurd belief that the inorganic beings were unde r his cont rol. “Sorcerers’ maneuve rs are deadly,” don Juan went on. “I beseech you to be extraordinarily aware. Don’ t get invol ved in having som e idiotic conf idence in your self.” “What finally happe ned to the nagu al Elias and Amalia?” I asked. “The nagua l Rosendo had to go bodi ly into that world and look for them,” he replied. “Did he find them?” “He did, after unt old struggl es. How ever, he coul d not totally bring them out . So the two young peopl e were always semi prisone rs of that realm.” “Did you know them, don Juan?” “Of cour se I kne w them, and I assure you, they were very strange .” CHAPTER 6 THE SHADOWS’ WORLD "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 You must be extremely careful, for you are about to fall prey to the inorganic beings ,” don Juan sai d to me, qui te une xpe ctedly, after we had been talking about som ething totally unr elated to dreaming. His statement caught me by surprise. As usual, I attempted to defend myself. “You don’ t have to warn me. I’m very careful,” I assured him. “The inor ganic beings are plotting,” he said. “I sense that, and I can’t cons ole myself by saying that they set traps at the beginni ng and, in this manne r, unde sirable dreamers are effectively and permanently screened out .” The tone of his voi ce was so urgent that I imme diately had to reassure him I was not goi ng to fall into any trap. “You must serious ly cons ider that the inor ganic beings have astoundi ng means at their dispos al,” he went on. “Their awareness is supe rb. In com parison, we are children, children with a lot of energy, which the inor ganic beings cove t.” I wanted to tell him that, on an abstract level, I had unde rstood his poi nt and his conc ern, but , on a conc rete plane, I saw no reason for his warning, because I was in cont rol of my dreaming practices. A few m inut es of une asy silence follow ed before don Juan spoke again. He change d the subj ect and said that he had to bring to my attention a very impor tant issue of his dreaming instruction, an issue that had, so far, byp assed my awareness. “You already unde rstan d that the gates of dreaming are specific obs tacles,” he said, “but you haven’t unde rstood yet that whatever is given as the exercise to reach and cross a gate is not really what that gate is all about .” “This is not clear to me at all, don Juan.” “I mean that it’s not true to say, for example, that the second gate is reached and crossed when a dreamer learns to wake up in anot her dream, or when a dreamer learns to change dreams without waking up in the world of daily life.” “Why isn’t it true, don Juan?” “ Because the second gate of dreaming is reached and crossed onl y when a dreamer learns to isolate and follow the foreign energy scout s.” “Why then is the idea of changi ng dreams given at all?” “Waking up in anot her dream or changi ng dreams is the drill devi sed by the old sorcerers to exercise a dreamer’s capacity to isolate and follow a scout .” Don Juan stated that follow ing a scout is a high accom plishm ent and that when dreamers are able to perform it, the second gate is flung ope n and the uni verse that exi sts behind it becom es accessible to them. He stressed that this universe is there all the time but that we cannot go into it because we lack energetic prow ess and that, in essence, the second gate of dreaming is the door into the inorganic beings ’ world, a nd dreaming is the key that ope ns that door . “Can a dreamer isolate a scout directly, without having to go through the drill of changi ng dreams?” I asked."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 “No, not at all,” he said. “The drill is essential. The que stion here is whether this is the onl y dri ll that exists. Or can a dreamer follow anot her drill?” Don Juan looke d at me qui zzically. It seemed that he actually expe cted me to answer the que stion. “It’s too difficult to com e up with a drill as com plete as the one the old sorcerers devised,” I said, without know ing why but with irrefutable author ity. Don Juan adm itted that I was absolutely right and said that the old sorcerers had devised a series of perfect drills to go through the gates of dreaming into the specific worlds that exist behind every g ate. He reiterated that dreaming, being the old sorcerers’ inve ntion, has to be played by their rules. He described the rule of the second gate in terms of a series of three steps: one , through practicing the drill of changi ng dreams, dreamers find out abo ut the scout s; two, by follow ing the scout s, they enter into anot her veritable uni verse; and three, in that uni verse, by means of their actions , dreamers find out, on their ow n, the gove rning laws and regul ations of that universe. Don Juan said that in my dealings with the inor ganic beings , I had follow ed the rule so well that he feared devastating cons eque nces. He thought that the una voi dable reaction on the part of the inor ganic beings was goi ng to be an attempt to keep me in their world. “Don’ t you think that you are exagge rating, don Juan?” I asked. I coul d not believe that the picture was as bleak as he was painting it. “I am not exagge rating at all,” he said, in a dry, serious tone . “You’ ll see. The inor ganic beings don ’t let anyone go, not without a r eal fight .” “But what makes you think they want me?” “They’ve already show n you too many things . Do you really believe that they are goi ng to all this troubl e just to entertain themselves?” Don Juan laughe d at his ow n remark. I did not find him amusing. A strange fear made me ask him whether he thought I shoul d interrupt or even discont inue my dreaming practices. “You have to cont inue you r dreaming unt il you have gone through the uni verse behind the second gate,” he said. “I mean that you alone must either accept or reject the lure of the inor ganic beings . That is why I remain aloof and hardly ever com ment on your dreaming practices.” I conf essed to him that I had been at a loss to expl ain why he was so generous in elucidating other aspects of his know ledge and so miserly with dreaming. “I was forced to teach you dreaming, ” he said, “only because that is the pattern set out by the old sorcerers. The path of dreaming is filled with pitfalls, and to avoi d thos e pitfalls or to fall into them is the persona l and indi vidua l affair of each dreamer, and I may add that it is a final affair.” “Are thos e pitfalls the result of succum bing to adul ation or to prom ises of pow er?” I asked. “Not onl y succum bing to thos e, but succum bing to anyt hing offered by the inorganic bei ngs . There is no way for sorcerers to accept anything offered by them, beyond a certain poi nt.”"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 “And what is that certain poi nt, don Juan?” “That poi nt depends on us as indi vidua ls. The challenge is for each of us to take onl y what is needed from that worl d, not hing more. To know what’s needed is the virtuos ity of sorcerers, but to take onl y what’s needed is their highe st accom plishm ent. To fail to unde rstand this simple rule is the surest way of plummeting into a pitfall.” “What happe ns if you fall, don Ju an?” “If you fall, you pay the price, and the price depends on the circum stances and the depth of the fall. But there is really no way of talking about an eventuality of this sort, because we are not facing a probl em of puni shm ent. Energetic currents are a t stake here, energetic currents which create circum stances that are more dreadful than death. Everything in the sorcerers’ path is a matter of life or death, but in the path of dreaming this matter is enha nced a hundr ed fold.” I reassured don Juan that I always exercised the utmost care in my dreaming practices, and that I was extremely disciplined and cons cientious . “I know that you are,” he said. “But I want you to be even more disciplined and handl e everything related to dreaming with kid glove s. Be, ab ove all, vigilant. I can’t foretell where the attack will com e from .” “Are you seeing, as a seer, imminent dange r for me, don Juan?” “I have seen imminent dange r for you since the day you walked in that mysterious city, the first time I helped you round up your energy body. ” “But do you know specifically what I shoul d do and what I shoul d avoi d?” “No, I don’ t. I onl y know that the uni verse behind the second gate is the closest to our ow n, and our ow n uni verse is pretty crafty and heartless. So the two can’t be that different.” I persisted in asking him to tell me what was in store for me. And he insisted that, as a sorcerer, he sensed a state of general dange r but that he coul d not be more specific. “The uni verse of the inor ganic beings is always ready to st rike,” he went on. “But so is our ow n uni verse. That’s why you have to go into their realm exactly as if you were venturing into a war zone .” “Do you mean, don Juan, that dreamers always have to be afraid of that world?” “No. I don’ t mean that. Once a drea mer goe s through the uni verse behind the second gate, or onc e a dreamer refuses to cons ider it as a viable opt ion, there are no more headaches.” Don Juan stated that onl y then are dreamers free to cont inue . I was not sure what he meant; he expl ained that t he uni verse behind the second gate is so pow erful and aggr essive that it serves as a natural screen or a testing ground where dreamers are probe d for their weakne sses. If they survive the tests, they can proceed to the next gate; if they do not , they remai n forever trappe d in that uni verse. I was left choki ng with anxi ety but , in spite of my coaxing, that was all he said. When I went hom e, I cont inue d my journeys to the inor ganic beings ’ realm, exerting great care."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 My carefulness seemed onl y to increase my sense of enjoyi ng thos e journeys. I got to the poi nt that the mere cont emplation of the inorganic beings ’ world was enough to create an exul tation impos sible to describe. I feared that my delight was goi ng to end soone r or later, but it was not so. Som ethi ng une xpe cted made it even more intense. On one occasion, a scout gui ded me very roughl y through count less tunne ls, as if searching for som ething, or as if it were trying to draw all my energy out and exha ust me. By the time it finally stoppe d, I felt as i f I had run a marathon. I seemed to be at the edge of that world. There were no more tunne ls, onl y blackne ss all around me. Then som ething lit up the area right in front of me; there, light shone from an indirect sour ce. It was a subdue d light that rende re d everything diffusely gray or brow nish. When I became used to the light , I vague ly distingui shed som e dark, movi ng shapes. After a while, it seemed to me that focusing my dreaming attention on thos e movi ng shapes made them subs tantial. I not iced that ther e were three type s: som e of them were round, like balls; others were like bells; and others yet like gigantic, undul ating candl e flames. All of them were basically round and the same size. I judge d that they were three to four feet in diameter. There were hund reds, perhaps even thou sands of them. I kne w that I was having a strange , sophi sticated vision, yet thos e shapes were so real that I found myself reacting with genui ne que asiness. I got the nauseating feeling of being ove r a nest of giant, round , brow n and grayish bug s. I felt som ehow safe, though, hove ring above them. I discarded all these cons iderations , how ever, the mom ent I realized that it was idiotic of me to feel safe or ill at ease, as if my dream were a real - life situation. How ever, as I obs erv ed thos e bugl ike shapes squi rm, I became very disturbed at the idea that they were about to touc h me. “We are the mobi le unit of our world,” the emissary’s voi ce said, all of a sudde n. “Don’ t be afraid. We are energy, and, for sure, we’re not intendi ng to touc h you. It woul d be impos sible anyw ay. We are separated by real boun daries.” After a long pause, the voi ce adde d, “We want you to join us. Com e dow n to where we are. And don ’t be ill at ease. You are not ill at ease with the scout s and certainly not wit h me. The scout s and I are just like the others. I am bell - shaped, and scout s are like candl e flames.” That last statement was definitely a cue of sorts for my energy body. On hearing it, my que asiness and fear vanished. I descende d to their level, and the balls and bells and candl e flames surrounde d me. They came so close to me that they woul d have touc hed me had I had a phys ical body . Instead, we went through one anot her, like encapsulated air puf fs. I had, at that poi nt, an unbe lievable sensation. Althou gh I did not feel anyt hing with or in my energy body , I was feeling and recording the most unus ual tickling som ewhere else; soft, airlike things were definitely goi ng through me, but not right there. The sensation was vague and fast and did not give me tim e to catch it fully. Instead of focusing my dreaming attention on it, I became entirely absorbed in watching thos e ove rsized bugs of energy At the level where we were, it seemed to me that there was a com mona lity between the shadow entities and myself: siz e."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 Perhaps it was because I judge d them to be the same size as my energy body that I felt almost cozy with them. On examining them, I conclude d that I did not mind them at all. They were impersona l, cold, detached, and I liked that immensely. I wonde red fo r an instant whether my disliking them one minut e and liking them the next was a natural cons eque nce of dreaming or a produc t of som e energetic influence thos e entities were exerting on me. “They are most likable,” I said to the emissary, at the very mom en t I was ove rpow ered by a wave of profound friends hip or even affection for them. No soone r had I spoke n my mind than the dark shapes scurried away, like bulky gui nea pigs, leaving me alone in semi darkne ss. “You projected too much feeling and scared them o ff,” the emissary’s voi ce said. “Feeling is too hard for them, and for me for that matter.” The emissary actually laughe d shyl y. My dreaming session ende d there. On awakening, my first reaction was to pack my bag to go to Mexico and see don Juan. How ever, an unexpe cted developm ent in my persona l life made it impos sible for me to travel, in spite of my frantic preparations to leave. The anxi ety resulting from this setback interrupt ed my dreaming practices altoge ther. I did not enga ge my cons cious vol ition to stop them; I had unw ittingl y put so much empha sis on this specific dream that I simply kne w if I coul d not get to don Juan there was no poi nt in cont inui ng dreaming. After an interrupt ion that lasted ove r half a year, I became more and more mystified by w hat had happe ned. I had no idea that my feelings alone were goi ng to stop my practices. I wonde red then if the desire woul d be sufficient to reinstate it. It was! Once I had formulated the thought of reentering dreaming, my practices cont inue d as if they h ad never been interrupt ed. The scout picked up where we had left off and took me directly to the vision I’d had during my last session. “This is the shadow s’ world,” the emissary’s voi ce said as soon as I was there. “But, even though we are shadow s, we she d light. Not onl y are we mobi le but we are the light in the tunne ls. We are anot her kind of inorganic being that exists here. There are three kinds : one is like an immobi le tunne l, the other is like a mobi le shadow . We are the mobi le shadow s. The tunne ls g ive us their energy and we do their biddi ng. ” The emissary stoppe d talking. I felt it was daring me to ask about the third kind of inor ganic being. I also felt that if I did not ask, the emissary woul d not tell me. “What’s the third kind of inor ganic being ?” I said. The emissary coughe d and chuc kled. To me, it sounde d like it relished being asked. “Oh, that’s our most mysterious feature,” it said. “The third kind is revealed to our visitors onl y when they choos e to stay with us.” “Why is that so?” I asked. “Because it takes a great deal of energy to see them,” the emissary answered. “And we woul d have to provi de that energy”"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 I kne w that the emissary was telling me the truth. I also kne w that a hor rendous dange r was lurking. Yet I was driven by a curiosity wi thout limits. I wanted to see that third kind. The emissary seemed to be aware of my mood. “Woul d you like to see them?” it asked casually. “Most certainly,” I said. “All you have to do is to say out loud that you want to stay with us,” the emissary said w ith a nonc halant intona tion. “But if I say that, I have to stay, right ?” I asked. “Naturally,” the emissary said in a tone of ultimate convi ction. “Everything you say out loud in this world is for keeps.” I coul d not help thinki ng that, if the emissary had wanted to trick me into staying, all it had to do was lie to me. I woul d not have know n the difference. “I cannot lie to you , because a lie doe sn’t exist,” the emissary said, intrudi ng into my thought s. “I can tell you onl y about what exists. In my world, onl y intent exists; a lie has no intent behind it; therefore, it has no existence.” I wanted to argue that there is intent even behind lies, but before I coul d voi ce my argum ent, the emissary said that behind lies there is intention but that intention is not intent. I coul d not keep my dreaming attention focused on the argum ent the emissary was pos ing. It went to the shadow beings . Sudde nly, I not iced that they had the appe arance of a herd of strange , childlike animals. The emissary’s voi ce warned me to ho ld my emotions in check, for sudde n bursts of feelings had the capacity to make them disperse, like a flock of birds. “What do you want me to do? ” I asked. “Com e dow n to our side and try to pus h or pul l us,” the emissary’s voi ce urged me. “The qui cker you learn to do that, the qui cker you’ ll be able to move things around in your world by merely looki ng at them.” My merchant’s mind went berserk with anticipation. I was instantly among them, desperately trying to pus h them or pul l them. After a while, I thor o ughl y exha usted my energy I had then the impression that I had been trying to do som ething equi valent to lifting a hous e with the strengt h of my teeth. Anot her impression I had was that the more I exerted myself, the greater the num ber of shadow s. It was a s if they were com ing from every corner to watch me, or to feed on me. The mom ent I had that thought , the shadow s again scurried away. “We are not feeding on you ,” the emissary said. “We all com e to feel your energy, very much like what you do with sunl igh t on a cold day.” The emissary urged me to ope n up to them by canceling out my suspicious thought s. I heard the voi ce, and, as I listened to what it was saying, I realized that I was hearing,"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 feeling, and thinki ng exactly as I do in my daily world. I slow l y turned to see around me. Taking the clarity of my perception as a gauge , I conc lude d that I was in a real world. The emissary’s voi ce sounde d in my ears. It said that for me the only difference between perceiving my world and perceiving theirs was that p erceiving their world started and ende d in the blink of an eye; perceiving mine did not, because my awareness — toge ther with the awareness of an immense num ber of beings like me, who held my world in place with their intent — was fixed on my world. The emissa ry adde d that perceiving my world started and ende d the same way for the inor ganic beings , in the blink of an eye, but perceiving their world did not , because there were immense num bers of them hol ding it in place with their intent. At that instant the sce ne started to dissolve. I was like a diver, and waking up from that world was like swimming up to reach the surface. In the follow ing session, the emissary began its dialogue with me by restating that a totally coor dinated and coactive relations hip existed between mobi le shadow s and stationa ry tunne ls. It finished its statement saying, “We can’t exist without each other.” “I unde rstand what you mean,” I said. There was a touc h of scorn in the emissary’s voi ce when it retorted that I coul d not pos sibly unde r stand what it means to be related in that fashion, which was infinitely more than being depende nt. I intende d to ask the emissary to expl ain what it meant by that, but the next instant I was inside of what I can onl y describe as the very tissue of the tunn el. I saw som e grotesque ly merged, glandl ike protube rances that emitted an opa que light. The thought crossed my mind that thos e were the same protube rances that had given me the impression of being like Braille. Cons idering that they were energy blobs thre e to four feet in diameter, I began to wonde r about the actual size of thos e tunne ls. “Size here is not like size in you r world,” the emissary said. “The energy of this world is a different kind of energy; its features don ’t coincide with the features of t he energy of your world, yet this world is as real as you r ow n.” The emissary went on to say that it had told me everything about the shadow beings when it described and expl ained the protube rances on the tunne ls’ walls. I retorted that I had heard the exp lanations but I had not paid attention to them because I believed that they did not pertain directly to dreaming. “Everything here, in this realm, pertains directly to dreaming, ” the emissary stated. I wanted to think about the reason for my misjudg ment, b ut my mind became blank. My dreaming attention was waning. I was having trouble focusing it on the world around me. I braced myself for waking up. The emissary started to speak again, and the sound of its voi ce proppe d me up. My dreaming attention perked u p cons iderably. “Dreaming is the vehicle that brings dreamers to this world,” the emissary said, “and everything sorcerers know about dreaming was taught to them by us. Our world is conne cted to your s by a door called dreams. We know how to go through that doo r, but men don’ t. They have to learn it.” The emissary’s voi ce went on expl aining what it had already expl ained to me before."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 “The protube rances on the tunne ls’ walls are shadow beings ,” it said. “I am one of them. We move inside the tunne ls, on their walls, charging our selves with the energy of the tunne ls, which is our energy. ” An idle thought crossed my mind: I was really incapable of conc eiving a sym biotic relations hip such as the one I was witnessing. “If you woul d stay among us, you woul d certainl y learn to feel what it is like to be conne cted as we are conne cted,” the emissary said. The emissary seemed to be waiting for my reply. I had the feeling that what it really wanted was for me to say that I had decided to stay. “How many shadow beings are in each tunne l?” I asked to change the mood and immediately regretted it because the emissary began to give me a detailed account of the num bers and func tions of the shadow beings in each tunne l. It said that each tunne l had a specific num ber of depende nt entities, which performed specific func tions having to do with the needs and expe ctations of the suppor ting tunne ls. I did not want the emissary to go into more detail. I reasone d that the less I kne w about the tunne l and shadow beings the better off I was . The instant I formulated that thought , the emissary stoppe d, and my energy body jerked as if it had been pul led by a cable. The next mom ent, I was fully awake, in my bed. From then on, I had no more fears that coul d have interrupt ed my practices. Anot her idea had begun to rule me: the idea that I had found unp aralleled excitation. I coul d hardly wait every day to start dreaming and have the scout take me to the shadow s’ world. The adde d attraction was that my visions of the shadow s’ world became even more true to life than before. Judge d by the subj ective standa rds of orderly thought s, orderly visual and audi tory sensory input , orderly respons es on my part, my expe riences, for as long as they lasted, were as real as any situation in our daily world. Never had I had perceptual expe riences in which the onl y difference between my visions and my everyda y world was the speed with which my visions ende d. One instant I was in a strange , real world, and the next instant I was in my bed. I craved don Juan’s com menta ries and expl anations, but I was still maroone d in Los Ange les. The more I cons idered my situation, the greater my anxi ety; I even began to sense that som ething in the inor ganic beings ’ realm was brewing at tremendous speed. As my anxi ety grew, my body ent ered into a state of profound fright , although my mind was ecstatic in the cont emplation of the shadow s’ world. To make things worse, the dreaming emissary’s voi ce lapsed into my daily conscious ness. One day while I was attendi ng a class at the uni versity, I heard the voi ce say, ove r and ove r, that any attempt on my part to end my dreaming practices woul d be deleterious to my total aims. It argue d that warriors do not shy away from a challenge and that I had no valid rationa le for discont inui ng my practices . I agreed with the emissary. I had no intention of stoppi ng any thing, and the voi ce was merely reaffirming what I felt. Not onl y did the emissary change but a new scout appe ared on the scene. On one occasion, before I had begun to examine the items of my dream, a scout literally jum ped in front of me and aggressively captured my dreaming attention. The notable feature of this scout was that it did not need to go through any energetic metamorphos is; it was a"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 blob of energy from the start. In the blink of a n eye, the scout transpor ted me, without my having to voi ce my intent to go with it, to anot her part of the inorganic beings ’ realm: the world of the saber - toot hed tigers. I have described in my other works glimpses of those visions . I say glimpses because I did not have sufficient energy then to rende r these perceived worlds com prehensible to my linear mind. My night ly visions of the saber - toot hed tigers occurred regul arly for a long time, unt il one night when the aggr essive scout that had taken me for the first time to that realm sudde nly appe ared again. Without waiting for my cons ent, it took me to the tunne ls. I heard the emissary’s voi ce. It immediately went into the longe st and most poi gna nt sales pitch I had heard so far. It told me about the extraord inary adva ntages of the inor ganic beings ’ world. It spoke of acqui ring kno wledge that woul d definitely stagge r the mind and about acqui ring it by the simplest act, of staying in thos e marvelous tunne ls. It spoke of incredible mobility, of endl ess time to f ind things , and, above all, of being pampered by cosmic servants that woul d cater to my slight est whims. “Aware beings from the most unbe lievable corners of the cosmos stay with us,” the emissary said, endi ng its talk. “And they love their stay with us. In fact, no one wants to leave.” The thought that crossed my mind at that mom ent was that servitude was definitely antithetical to me. I had never been at ease with servants or with being served. The scout took ove r and made me glide through many tunne ls. It came to a halt in a tunne l that seemed som ehow larger than the others. My dreaming attention became riveted on the size and conf igur ation of that tunne l, and it woul d have stayed glued there had I not been made to turn around. My dreaming attention focuse d then on a blob of energy a bit bigge r than the shadow entities. It was blue, like the blue in the center of a candl e’s flame. I kne w that this energy conf igur ation was not a shadow entity and that it did not belong there. I became absorbed in sensing it. The scout signa led me to leave, but som ething was making me impervious to its cues. I remained, une asily, where I was. How ever, the scout ’s signa ling broke my conc entration, and I lost sight of the blue shape. Sudde nly, a cons iderable force made me spin a round and put me squa rely in front of the blue shape. As I gazed at it, it turned into the figur e of a person: very small, slende r, delicate, almost transparent. I desperately attempted to determine whether it was a man or a wom an, but , hard as I tried, I coul d not . My attempts to ask the emissary failed. It flew away qui te abrupt ly, leaving me suspende d in that tunne l, facing now an unknow n person. I tried to talk to that person the way I talked to the emissary. I got no respons e. I felt a wave of frustrat ion at not being able to break the barrier that separated us. Then I was besieged by the fear of being alone with som eone who might have been an enemy. I had a variety of reactions trigge red by the presence of that strange r. I even felt elation, because I kne w that the scout had finally show n me anot her hum an being caught in that world. I onl y despaired at the pos sibility that we were not able to com muni cate perhaps"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 because that strange r was one of the sorcerers of antiqui ty and belonge d to a time different from mine. The more intense my elation and curiosity, the heavier I became, unt il a mom ent in which I was so massive that I was back in my body, and back in the world. I found myself in Los Ange les, in a park by the University of California. I was standi n g on the grass, right in the line of peopl e playing gol f. The person in front of me had solidified at the same rate. We stared at each other for a fleeting instant. It was a girl, per haps six or seven years old. I thought I kne w her. On seeing her, my ela tion and curiosity grew so out of propor tion that they triggered a reversal. I lost mass so fast that in anot her instant I was again a blob of energy in the inor ganic beings ’ realm The scout came back for me and hur riedly pul led me away. I woke up with a j olt of fright . In the process of surfacing into the daily world, som ething had let a message slip through . My mind went into a frenzy trying to put toge ther what I kne w or thought I kne w. I spent more than forty - eight cont inuous hour s attempting to get at a hidde n feeling or a hidde n know ledge that had got ten stuck to me. The onl y success I had was to sense a force — I fancied it to be outside my mind or my body — that told me not to trust my dreaming anym ore. After a few days, a dark and mysterious certainty began to get hol d of me, a certainty that grew by degrees unt il I had no doub t about its authenticity: I was sure that the blue blob of energy was a prisone r in the inorganic beings ’ realm. I needed don Juan’s advi ce more desperately than ever. I kne w that I was throw ing years of work out the window , but I coul dn’ t help it; I droppe d everything 1 was doi ng and ran to Mexico. “What do you really want?” don Juan asked me as a way to cont ain my hys terical babbl ing. I coul d not expl ain to him what I wanted beca use I did not know it myself. “Your probl em must be very serious to make you run like this,” don Juan said with a pensive expr ession. “It is, in spite of the fact that I can’t figure out what my probl em really is,” I said. He asked me to describe my dreami ng practices in all the detail that was pertinent. I told him about my vision of the little girl and how it had affected me at an emotiona l level. He instantly advi sed me to igno re the event and regard it as a blatant attempt, on the part of the inor ganic beings , to cater to my fantasies. He remarked that if dreaming is ove rempha sized, it becom es what it was for the old sorcerers: a sour ce of inexha ustible indul ging. For som e inexpl icable reason, I was unw illing to tell don Juan about the realm of the shado w entities. It was onl y when he discarded my vision of the little girl that I felt obl iged to describe to him my visits to that world. He was silent for a long time, as if he were ove rwhelmed."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 When he finally spoke , he said, “You are more alone than I thou ght , because I can’t discuss your dreaming practices at all. You are at the pos ition of the old sorcerers. All I can do is to repeat to you that you must exercise all the care you are able to muster up. ” “Why do you say that I am at the pos ition of the old sorcerers?” “I’ve told you repeatedly that your mood is dange rous ly like the old sorcerers’. They were very capable beings ; their flaw was that they took to the inor ganic beings ’ realm like fish take to the water. You are in the same boa t. You know things about it that none of us can even conc eive. For instance, I never kne w about the shadow s’ world; neither did the nagua l Julian or the nagua l Elias, in spite of the fact that he spent a long time in the world of the inor ganic beings .” “But what difference doe s know ing the shadow s’ world make?” “A great deal of difference. Dreamers are taken there onl y when the inor ganic beings are sure the dreamers are going to stay in that world. We know this through the old sorcerers’ stories.” “I assure you, don Juan, th at I have no intention whatsoever of staying there. You talk as if I am just about to be lured by promises of service or prom ises of pow er. I am not interested in either, and that’s that.” “At this level, it isn’t that easy anym ore. You’ ve gone beyond the poi nt where you coul d simply qui t. Besides, you had the misfortune of being singl ed out by a watery inor ganic being. Remember how you tum bled with it? And how it felt? I told you then that watery inor ganic beings are the most annoyi ng. They are depende nt a nd pos sessive, and onc e they sink their hoo ks, they never give up.” “And what doe s that mean in my case, don Juan?” “It means real troubl e. The specific inorganic being who’ s runni ng the show is the one you grabbe d that fatal day. Over the years, it has gr ow n familiar with you. It know s you intimately.” I sincerely remarked to don Juan that the mere idea that an inorganic being kne w me intimately made me sick to my stom ach. “When dreamers realize that the inor ganic beings have no appe al,” he said, “it is us ually too late for them, because by then the inor ganic beings have them in the bag.” I felt in the depths of me that he was talking abstractly, about dange rs that might exist theoretically but not in practice. I was secretly convinced there was no dange r o f any sort. “I am not goi ng to allow the inor ganic beings to lure me in any way, if that’s what you ’re thinki ng, ” I said. “I am thinki ng that they are goi ng to trick you, ” he said. “Like they tricked the nagua l Rosendo. They are goi ng to set you up, and yo u won’ t see the trap or even suspect it. They are smoot h ope rators. Now they have even invented a little girl.” “But there is no doubt in my mind that the little girl exists,” I insisted."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 “There is no little girl,” he snappe d. “That bluish blob of energy i s a scout . An expl orer caught in the inorganic beings ’ realm. I’ve said to you that the inor ganic beings are like fishermen; they attract and catch awareness.” Don Juan said that he believed, without a doubt , that the bluish blob of energy was from a dimen sion entirely different from our s, a scout that got strande d and caught like a fly in a spider’s web. I did not appr eciate his analogy . It worried me to the poi nt of phys ical discom fort. I did mention this to don Juan, and he told me that my conc ern with t he prisone r scout was making him feel very close to despair. “Why doe s this bot her you? ” I asked. “Som ething is brewing in that conf ounde d world,” he said. “And I can’t figure out what it is.” While I remained with don Juan and his com panions, I did not dr eam at all about the inor ganic beings ’ world. As usual, my practice was to focus my dreaming attention on the items of my dreams and to change dreams. As a way to offset my conc erns, don Juan made me gaze at clouds and at faraway moun tain peaks. The result was an immediate feeling of being level with the clouds , or the feeling that I was actually at the faraway mount ain peaks. “I am very pleased, but very worried,” don Juan said as a com ment on my effort. “You are being taught marvels, and you don’ t even kn ow it. And I don’ t mean that you are being taught by me.” “You are talking about the inorganic beings , true?” “Yes, the inor ganic beings . I recom mend that you don’ t gaze at anyt hing; gazing was the old sorcerers’ techni que . They were able to get to their e nergy bodi es in the blink of an eye, simply by gazing at obj ects of their predilection. A very impressive techni que , but useless to mode rn sorcerers. It doe s not hing to increase our sobr iety or our capacity to seek freedom . All it doe s is pin us dow n to co ncreteness, a most unde sirable state.” Don Juan adde d that, unless I kept myself in check, by the time I had merged the second attention with the attention of my everyda y life, I was goi ng to be an insufferable man. There was, he said, a dange rous gap betw een my mobi lity in the second attention and my insistence on immobi lity in my awareness of the daily world. He remarked that the gap between the two was so great that in my daily state I was nearly an idiot, and in the second attention I was a luna tic. Bef ore I went hom e, I took the liberty of discussing my dreaming visions of the shadow s’ world with Carol Tiggs , although don Juan had advised me not to discuss them with anybody. She was most unde rstandi ng and most interested, since she was my total count erp art. Don Juan was definitely annoye d with me for having revealed my troubl es to her. I felt worse than ever. Self - pity pos sessed me, and I began to com plain about always doi ng the wrong thing. “You haven’t done anyt hing yet,” don Juan snappe d at me. “That much, I know .”"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 Was he right ! On my next dreaming session, at home, all hell broke loos e. I reached the shadow s’ world, as I had done on count less occasions ; the difference was the presence of the blue energy shape. It was among the other shadow beings . I f elt it was pos sible that the blob had been there before and I hadn’ t not iced it. As soon as I spot ted it, my dreaming attention was inescapably attracted to that blob of energy. In a matter of seconds , I was next to it. The other shadow s came to me, as usu al, but I paid no attention to them. All of a sudde n, the blue, round shape turned into the little girl I had seen before. She craned her thin, delicate, long neck to one side and said in a barely audi ble whisper, “Help me!” Either she said that or I fanta sized that she said it. The result was the same: I stood frozen, galvanized by genui ne conc ern. I experienced a chill, but not in my energy mass. I felt a chill in anot her part of me. This was the first time I was com pletely aware that my expe rience was th orough ly separate from my sensorial feelings . I was expe riencing the shadow s’ world, with all the implications of what I nor mally cons ider expe riencing: I was able to think, to assess, to make decisions ; I had psycho logi cal cont inui ty; in other words, I w as myself. The only part of me that was missing was my sensorial self. I had no bodi ly sensations . All my input came through seeing and hearing. My rationa lity then cons idered a strange dilemma: seeing and hearing were not phys ical faculties but qua lities of the visions I was having. “You are really seeing and hearing, ” the emissary’s voi ce said, erupt ing into my thought s. “That is the beauty of this place. You can expe rience everything through seeing and hearing, without having to breathe. Think of it! You don’ t have to breathe! You can go anyw here in the uni verse and not breathe.” A most disqui eting ripple of emotion went through me, and, again, I did not feel it there, in the shadow s’ world. I felt it in anot her place. I became enor mous ly agitated by the obvi ous yet veiled realization that there was a live conne ction between the me that was expe riencing and a sour ce of energy, a sour ce of sensorial feeling located som ewhere else. It occurred to me that this som ewhere else was my actual phys ical body, which was asleep in my bed. At the instant of this thought , the shadow beings scurried away, and the little girl was alone in my field of vision. I watched her and became convi nced that I kne w her. She seemed to falter as if she were about to faint A bou ndl ess wave of affection for her enve lope d me. I tried to speak to her, but I was incapable of uttering sounds . It became clear to me then that all my dialogue s with the emissary had been elicited and accom plished by the emissary’s energy. Left to my ow n devices, I was helpless. I attempted next to direct my thought s to the little girl. It was useless. We were separated by a membrane of energy I coul d not pierce. The little girl seemed to unde rstand my despair and actually com muni cated with me, directly into my th ought s. She told me, essentially, what don Juan had already said: that she was a scout caught in the webs of that world. Then she adde d that she had adopt ed the shape of a little girl because that shape was familiar to me and to her and that she needed my help as much as I needed hers. She said this to me in one clum p of energetic feeling, which was like words that came to me all at onc e.

She even smiled as if to let me know that she had left it up to me to extricate her from her bo nds . When I retorted, in a thought , that I had no abilities whatsoever, she gave me the impression of a hys terical child in the throes of despair. I frantically tried to talk to her. The little girl actually cried, like a child her age woul d cry, out of de speration and fear. I coul dn’ t stand it. I charged at her, but with no effective result. My energy mass went through her. My idea was to lift her up and take her with me. I attempted the same maneuve r ove r and ove r unt il I was exha usted. I stoppe d to cons i der my next move . I was afraid that my dreaming attention was goi ng to wane, and then I woul d lose sight of her. I doubt ed that the inorganic beings woul d bring me back to that specific part of their realm. It seemed to me that this was goi ng to be my last visit to them: the visit that count ed. Then I did som ething unthinka ble. Before my dreaming attention vanished, I yelled loud and clear my intent to merge my energy with the energy of that prisone r scout and set it free. CHAPTER 7 THE BLUE SCOUT I was dreaming an utterly nons ensical dream. Carol Tiggs was by my side. She was speaking to me, although I coul d not unde rstand what she said. Don Juan was also in my dream, as were all the members of his party. They seemed to be trying to drag me out of a fogg y yellow ish world. After a serious effort, dur ing which I lost and regained sight of them various times, they succeeded in extricating me from that place. Since I coul d not conc eive the sense of all that ende avor , I finally figur ed that I was having a nor m al, incohe rent dream. My surprise was stagge ring when I woke up and found myself in bed, in don Juan’s hous e. I was incapable of movi ng. I had no energy at all. I did not know what to think, although I immediately sensed the gravity of my situation. I had the vague feeling that I had lost my energy because of fatigue caused by dreaming. Don Juan’s com panions seemed to be extremely affected by whatever was happe ning to me. They kept on com ing into my room , one at a time. Each stayed for a mom ent, in com plete silence, unt il som eone else show ed up. It appe ared to me that they were taking turns watching ove r me. I was too weak to ask them to expl ain their behavior."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 During the subs eque nt days, I began to feel better, and they started to talk to me about my dreami ng. At first, I did not know what they wanted of me. Then it dawned on me, because of their que stions , that they were obs essed with the shadow beings . Every one of them appe ared to be scared and said to me more or less the same thing. They insisted that th ey had never been in the shadow s’ world. Som e of them even claimed that they did not know it existed. Their claims and reactions increased my sense of bewilderment and my feat The que stions everyone asked were, “Who took you into that world? Or how did you even begin to know how to get there?” When I told them that the scout s had show n me that world, they coul d not believe me. Obvious ly, they had surmised that I had been there, but since it was not pos sible for them to use their persona l expe rience as a ref erence poi nt, they were una ble to fathom what I was saying. Yet they still wanted to know all I coul d tell them about the shadow beings and their realm. I obl iged them. All of them, with the exception of don Juan, sat by my bed, hangi ng on every word I sai d. How ever, every time I asked them about my situation, they scurried away, just like the shadow beings .. Anot her disturbing reaction, which they never had before, was that they frantically avoi ded any phys ical cont act with me. They kept their distance, as if I were carrying the plague . Their reaction worried me so much that I felt obl iged to ask them about it. They denied it. They seemed insulted and even went so far as to insist on provi ng to me that I was wrong. I laughe d heartily at the tense situation that ensued. Their bod ies went rigid every time they tried to embrace me. Florinda Grau, don Juan’s closest cohor t, was the onl y member of his party who lavished phys ical attention on me and tried to expl ain to me what was goi ng on. She told me that I had been discharged of energy in the inor ganic beings ’ world and charged again, but that my new energetic charge was a bit disturbing to the majority of them. Florinda used to put me to bed every night , as if I were an inva lid. She even spoke to me in baby tal k, which all of them celebrated with gales of laught er. But regardless of how she made fun of me, I appr eciated her conc ern, which seemed to be real. I have written about Florinda before in conne ction with my meeting her. She was by far the most beautiful woman I had ever met. Once I said to her, and I really meant it, that she coul d have been a fashion magazine mode l. “Of a magazine of nineteen ten,” she retorted. Florinda , although she was old, was not old at all. She was young and vibrant. When I asked d on Juan about her unus ual yout hfulness, he replied that sorcery kept her in a vital state. Sorcerers’ energy, he remarked, was seen by the eye as yout h and vigor. After satisfying their initial curiosity about the shadow s’ world, don Juan’s com panions stop ped com ing into my room , and their conve rsation remained at the level of casual inqui ries about my health. Every time I tried to get up, how ever, there was som eone around who gently put me back to bed. I did not want their ministrations , yet it seemed that I needed them; I was weak I accepted that. But what really took its toll on me was not having anyone expl ain to me what I was doi ng in Mexico when I had gone to bed to"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 dream in Los Ange les. I asked them repeatedly. Every one of them gave me the same answe r, “Ask the nagua l. He’s the onl y one who can expl ain it.” Finally, Florinda broke the ice. “You were lured into a trap; that’s what happe ned to you, ” she said. “Where was I lured into a trap?” “In the world of the inorganic beings , of cour se. That has bee n the world you’ ve been dealing with for years. Isn’t that so?” “Most definitely, Florinda . But can you tell me about the kind of trap it was?” “Not really. All I can tell you is that you lost all your energy there. But you fought very well.” “Why am I sic k, Florinda ?” “You are not sick with an illness; you were energetically wounde d. You were critical, but now you are only gravely wounde d.” “How did all this happe n?” “You entered into a mortal com bat with the inorganic beings , and you were defeated.” “I do n’t remember fight ing anyone , Florinda .” “Whether you remember or not is immaterial. You fought and were out classed. You didn’ t have a chance against thos e masterful manipulators.” “I fought the inor ganic beings ?” “Yes. You had a mortal encount er with them . I really don’ t know how you have survived their death blow .” She refused to tell me anyt hing else and hinted that the nagua l was com ing to see me any day. The next day don Juan show ed up. He was very jovial and suppor tive. He joki ngl y announc ed that he w as paying me a visit in his capacity of energy doc tor. He examined me by gazing at me from head to toe. “You’ re almost cured,” he conc lude d. “What happe ned to me, don Juan?” I asked. “You fell into a trap the inorganic beings set for you,” he answered. “Ho w did I end up here?” “Right there is the big mystery, for sure,” he said and smiled jovi ally, obvi ous ly frying to make light of a serious matter. “The inor ganic beings snatched you, body and all. First they took your energy body into their realm, when you follow ed one of their scout s, and then they took you r phys ical body .” Don Juan’s com panions seemed to be in a state of shoc k. One of them asked don Juan whether the inor ganic beings coul d abduc t anyone . Don Juan answered that they certainly coul d. He remi nde d them that the nagua l Elias was taken into that uni verse, and he definitely did not intend to go there."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 All of them assented with a nod . Don Juan cont inued speaking to them, referring to me in the third person. He said that the com bined awareness of a group of inorganic beings had first cons um ed my energy body by forcing an emotiona l out burst from me: to free the blue scout . Then the com bined awareness of the same group of inorganic beings had pul led my inert phys ical mass into their world. Don Juan ad ded that without the energy body one is merely a lum p of organic matter that can be easily manipul ated by awareness. “The inor ganic beings are glued toge ther, like the cells of the body ,” don Juan went on. “When they put their awareness toge ther, they are unbe atable. It’s not hing for them to yank us out of our moor ings and plunge us into their world. Especially if we make our selves cons picuous and available, like he did.” Their sighs and gasps echoe d against the walls. All of them seemed to be genui nely fri ght ened and conc erned. I wanted to whine and blame don Juan for not stoppi ng me, but I remembered how he had tried to warn me, to deviate me, time and time again, to no avail. Don Juan was definitely aware of what was goi ng on in my mind. He gave a know ing smile. “The reason you think you’ re sick,” he said, addr essing me, “is that the inor ganic beings discharged your energy and gave you theirs. That shoul d have been enough to kill anyone . As the nagua l, you have extra energy; therefore, you barely survived. ” I mentione d to don Juan that I remembered bits and pieces of qui te an incohe rent dream, in which I was in a yellow - fogge d world. He, Carol Tiggs , and his com panions were pul ling me out . “The inor ganic beings ’ realm looks like a yellow - fog world to the ph ysical eye,” he said. “When you thought you were having an incohe rent dream, you were actually looki ng with your physical eyes, for the first time, at the inorganic beings ’ uni verse. And, strange as it may seem to you , it was also the first time for us. We kne w about the fog onl y through sorcerers’ stories, not through expe rience.” Nothing of what he was saying made sense to me. Don Juan assured me that, because of my lack of energy, a more com plete expl anation was impos sible; I had to be satisfied, he said , with what he was telling me and how I unde rstood it. “1 don’ t unde rstand it at all,” I insisted. “Then you haven’t lost anyt hing,” he said. “When you get stronge r, you your self will answer your que stions .” I conf essed to don Juan that I was having hot fl ashes. My temperature rose sudde nly, and, while I felt hot and sweaty I had extraordinary but disturbing insight s into my situation. Don Juan scanne d my entire body with his penetrating gaze. He said that I was in a state of energetic shoc k. Losing energy had tempor arily affected me, and what I interpreted as hot flashes were, in essence, blasts of energy dur ing which I mom entarily regained cont rol of my energy body and kne w everything that had happe ned to me. “Make an effort, and tell me your self what happ ened to you in the inor ganic beings ’ world,” he ordered me."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 I told him that the clear sensation I got , from time to time, was that he and his com panions had gone into that world with their physical bodi es and had snatched me out of the inorganic beings ’ cl utches. “Right !” he exclaimed. “You’ re doi ng fine. Now , turn that sensation into a view of what happe ned.” I was una ble to do what he wanted, hard as I tried. Failing made me expe rience an unus ual fatigue , which seemed to dry up the inside of my body. Befo re don Juan left the room , I remarked to him that I was suffering from anxi ety “That means not hing, ” he said, unc onc erned. “Gain back your energy, and don’ t worry about nons ense.” More than two weeks went by, dur ing which I slowly gained back my energy How ever, I kept on worrying about every thing. I worried mainly about being unknow n to myself, especially about a streak of coldne ss in me that I had not not iced before, a sort of indi fference, a detachm ent that I had attribut ed to my lack of energy unt il I r egained it. Then I realized that it was a new feature of my being, a feature that had me permanently out of sync hroni zation. To elicit the feelings I was accustom ed to, I had to sum mon them up and actually wait a mom ent unt il they made their appe arance in my mind. Anot her new feature of my being was a strange longing that took hol d of me from time to time. I longe d for som eone I did not know ; it was such an ove rpow ering and cons um ing feeling that, when I expe rienced it, I had to move around the room incessa ntly to alleviate it. The longi ng remained with me unt il I made use of anot her newcom er in my life: a rigid cont rol of myself, so new and pow erful that it onl y adde d more fuel to my worrying. By the end of the four th week, everybody felt that I was finally cured. They cut dow n their visits drastically. I spent much of the time alone, sleeping. The rest and relaxation I was getting was so com plete that my energy began to increase remarkably. I felt like my old self again. I even began to exercise. One day ar ound noon after a light lunc h, I returned to my room to take a nap. Just before I sank into a deep sleep, I was tossing in my bed, trying to find a more com fortable spot , when a strange pressure on my temples made me open my eyes. The little girl of the in organic beings ’ world was standi ng by the foot of my bed, peering at me with her cold, steel blue eyes. I jum ped out of bed and screamed so loud ly that three of don Juan’s com panions were in the room before I had stoppe d my scream. They were agha st. They w atched in hor ror as the little girl came to me and was stoppe d by the bounda ries of my lum inous phys ical being. We looke d at each other for an eternity. She was telling me som ething, which I coul d not com prehend at first but which in the next mom ent became as clear as a bell. She said that for me to unde rstand what she was saying, my awareness had to be transferred from my phys ical body into my energy body. Don Juan came into the room at that mom ent. The little girl and don Juan stared at each other. Withou t a word, don Juan turned around and walked out of the room . The little girl swished past the door after him."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 The com motion this scene created among don Juan’s com panions was inde scribable. They lost all their com pos ure. Appa rently, all of them had seen th e little girl as she left the room with the nagua l. I myself seemed to be on the verge of expl odi ng. I felt faint and had to sit dow n. I had expe rienced the presence of the little girl as a blow on my solar plexus . She bor e an astoni shing likeness to my fa ther. Waves of sentiment hit me. I wonde red about the meaning of this until I was actually sick. When don Juan returned to the room , I had gained minimal cont rol ove r myself. The expe ctation of hearing what he had to say about the little girl was making my breathing very difficult. Everybody was as excited as I was. They all talked to don Juan at onc e and laughe d when they realized what they were doi ng. Their main interest was to find out whether there was any uni formity in the way they had perceived the sc out ’s appe arance. Everybody was in agreement that they had seen a little girl, six to seven years old, very thin, with angul ar, beautiful features. They also agreed that her eyes were steel blue and bur ning with a mute emotion; her eyes, they said, expr ess ed gratitude and loya lty. Every detail they described about the little girl I corrobor ated myself. Her eyes were so bright and ove rpow ering that they had actually caused me som ething like pain. I had felt the weight of her look on my chest. A serious que ry , which don Juan’s com panions had and which I echoe d myself, was about the implications of this event. All agreed that the scout was a por tion of foreign energy that had filtered through the walls separating the second attention and the attention of the da ily world. They asserted that since they were not dreaming and yet all of them had seen the alien energy projected into the figur e of a hum an child; that child had existence. They argue d that there must have been hundr eds, if not thous ands , of cases in whi ch foreign energy slips unnot iced through natural barriers into our hum an world, but that in the history of their lineage there was no mention whatsoever of an event of this nature. What worried them the most was that there were no sorcerers’ stories about it. “Is this the first time in the history of manki nd that this has happe ned?” one of them asked don Juan. “I think it happe ns all the time,” he replied, “but it has never happe ned in such an ove rt, vol itiona l way.” “What doe s it mean to us?” anot her one of them asked don Juan. “Nothing to us, but everything to him,” he said and poi nted at me. All of them then entered into a most disturbing silence. Don Juan paced back and forth for a mom ent. Then he stoppe d in front of me and peered at me, giving all the indications of som eone who cannot find words to expr ess an overwhelming realization. “I can’t even begin to assess the scope of what you ’ve done ,” don Juan finally said to me in a tone of bewilderment. “You fell into a pitfall, but it wasn’t the kind of pi tfall I was worrying about . Your pitfall was designe d for you alone , and it was deadlier than anyt hing I coul d have thought of. I worried about your falling prey to flattery and being"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 served. What I never count ed on was that the shadow beings woul d set a t rap using your inhe rent aversion to chains.” Don Juan had onc e made a com parison of his reaction and mine, in the sorcerers’ world, to the things that pressed us the most. He said, without making it sound like a com plaint, that although he wanted and tried to, he had never been able to inspire the kind of affection his teacher, the nagua l Julian, inspired in peopl e. “My unbi ased reaction, which I am put ting on the table for you to examine, is to be able to say, and mean it: it’s not my fate to evoke blind a nd total affection. So be it!” “Your unbi ased reaction, ” he went on, “is that you can’t stand chains, and you woul d forfeit your life to break them.” I sincerely disagreed with him and told him that he was exagge rating. My views were not that clear. “Don’ t worry,” he said laughi ng, “sorcery is action. When the time com es, you’ ll act your passion the same way I act mine. Mine is to acqui esce to my fate, not passively, like an idiot, but actively, like a warrior. Yours is to jum p without either capricious ness or premeditation to cut som eone else’s chains.” Don Juan expl ained that upon merging my energy with the scout I had truthfully ceased to exist. All my phys icalness had then been transpor ted into the inor ganic beings ’ realm and, had it not been for the sco ut who gui ded don Juan and his com panions to where I was, I woul d have died or remained in that world, inextricably lost. “Why did the scout gui de you to where I was?” I asked. “The scout is a sentient being from anot her dimension, ” he said. “It’s a little girl now , and as such she told me that in order to get the energy to break the barrier that had trappe d her in the inorganic beings ’ world, she had to take all of your s. That’s her hum an part now . Som ething resembling gratitude drove her to me. When I saw her, I kne w instantly that you were done for.” “What did you do then, don Juan?” “I rounde d up everyone I coul d get hol d of, especially Carol Tiggs , and off we went into the inor ganic beings ’ realm.” “Why Carol Tiggs ?” “In the first place, because she has endl ess energy, and, in the second place, because she had to familiarize herself with the scout . All of us got som ething inva luable out of this expe rience. You and Carol Tiggs got the scout . And the rest of us got a reason to round up our phys icality and place it on our energy bod ies; we became energy. ” “How did all of you do that, don Juan?” “We displaced our assemblage poi nts, in uni son. Our impeccable intent to save you did the work. The scout took us, in the blink of an eye, to where you were lying, ha lf dead, and Carol dragge d you out .” His expl anation made no sense to me. Don Juan laughe d when I tried to raise that poi nt."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 “How can you unde rstand this when you don’ t even have enough energy to get out of your bed?” he retorted. I conf ided to him that I was certain I kne w infinitely more than I rationa lly adm itted but that som ething was keeping a tight lid on my memory. “Lack of energy is what has put a tight lid on your memory,” he said. “When you have sufficient energy, your memory will work fine.” “Do you mean that I can remember everything if I want to?” “Not qui te. You may want as much as you like, but if your energy level is not on a par with the importance of what you know , you might as well kiss your know ledge good - bye : it’ll never be available to you. ” “So what’s the thing to do, don Juan?” “Energy tends to be cum ulative; if you follow the warrior’s way impeccably, a mom ent will com e when you r memory ope ns up. ” I conf essed that hearing him talk gave me the absurd sensation that I was indul ging in f eeling sorry for myself, that there was not hing wrong with me. “You are not just indul ging, ” he said. “You were actually energetically dead four weeks ago. Now you are merely stunne d. Being stunne d and lacking energy is what makes you hide your know ledge . You certainly know more than any of us about the inorganic beings ’ world. That world was the exclusive conc ern of the old sorcerers. All of us have told you that onl y through sorcerers’ stories do we know about it. I sincerely say that it is more than stra nge to me that you’ ve becom e, in your ow n right , anot her sour ce of sorcerers’ stories for us.” I reiterated that it was impos sible for me to believe I had done som ething he had not . But I coul d not believe either that he was merely hum oring me. “I am not f lattering or hum oring you, ” he said, visibly annoye d. “I am stating a sorcery fact. Know ing more than any of us about that world shoul dn’ t be a reason for feeling pleased. There’s no adva ntage in that know ledge ; in fact, in spite of all you know , you coul d n’t save your self. We saved you, because we found you. But without the aid of the scout , there was no poi nt in even trying to find you . You were so infinitely lost in that world that I shudde r at the mere thought .” In my state of mind, I did not find it st range in the least that I actually saw a rippl e of emotion goi ng through all of don Juan’s com panions and appr entices. The one who remained una ltered was Carol Tiggs . She seemed to have fully accepted her role. She was one with me. “You did free the scout , ” don Juan cont inue d, “but you gave up your life. Or, worse yet, you gave up you r freedom . The inorganic beings let the scout go, in exchange for you. ” “I can hardly believe that, don Juan. Not that I dou bt you, you unde rstand, but you describe such an und erhande d maneuve r that I am stunne d.” “Don’ t cons ider it unde rhande d and you have the whol e thing in a nut shell. The inor ganic beings are forever in search of awareness and energy; if you suppl y them with the"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 pos sibility of bot h, what do you think they’ll do? Blow you kisses from across the street?” I kne w that don Juan was right . How ever, I coul d not hol d that certainty for too long; clarity kept drifting away from me. Don Juan’s com panions cont inue d asking him que stions . They wanted to know if he had give n any though t to what to do with the scout . “Yes, I have. It is a most serious problem, which the nagua l here has to resolve,” he said, poi nting at me. “He and Carol Tiggs are the only ones who can free the scout . And he know s it too. ” Naturally, I asked h im the onl y pos sible que stion, “How can I free it?” “Instead of my telling you how , there is a much better and more just way of findi ng out ,” don Juan said with big smile. “Ask the emissary. The inorganic beings cannot lie, you know .” CHAPTER 8 THE THIRD GATE OF DREAMING The third gate of dreaming is reached when you find your self in a dream, staring at som eone else who is asleep. And that som eone else turns out to be you ,” don Juan said. My energy level was so keyed up at the time that I went to work on the third task right away, although he did not offer any more information about it. The first thing I not iced, in my dreaming practices, was that a surge of energy immediately rearrange d the focus of my dreaming attention. Its focus was now on waking up i n a dream and seeing myself sleeping; jour neying to the realm of inor ganic beings was no longe r an issue for me. Very soon after, I found myself in a dream looki ng at myself asleep. I immediately repor ted it to don Juan. The dream had happe ned while I was at his hous e. “There are two pha ses to each of the gates of dreaming, ” he said. “The first, as you know , is to arrive at the gate; the second is to cross it. By dreaming what you’ ve dreamt, that you saw your self asleep, you arrived at the third gate. The s econd pha se is to move around onc e you’ ve seen you rself asleep. “At the third gate of dreaming,” he went on, “you begin to deliberately merge you r dreaming reality with the reality of the daily world. This is the drill, and sorcerers call it com pleting the energy body. The merge between the two realities has to be so thor ough that you need to be more fluid than ever. Examine everything at the third gate with great care and curiosity.” I com plained that his recom menda tions were too crypt ic and were not makin g any sense to me. “What do you mean by great care and curiosity?” I asked."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 90 “Our tende ncy at the third gate is to get lost in detail,” he replied. “To view things with great care and curiosity means to resist the nearly irresistible temptation to plunge in to detail. “The given drill, at the third gate, as I said, is to consolidate the energy body. Dreamers begin forging the energy body by fulfilling the drills of the first and second gates. When they reach the third gate, the energy body is ready to com e ou t, or perhaps it woul d be better to say that it is ready to act. Unfortuna tely, this also means that it’s ready to be mesmerized by detail.” “What doe s it mean to be mesmerized by detail?” “The energy body is like a child who’ s been imprisone d all its life . The moment it is free, it soaks up everything it can find, and I mean everything. Every irrelevant, minut e detail totally absorbs the energy body .” An awkw ard silence follow ed. I had no idea what to say. I had unde rstood him perfectly, I just didn’t have anyt hing in my expe rience to give me an idea of exactly what it all meant. “The most asinine detail becom es a world for the energy body, ” don Juan expl ained. “The effort that dreamers have to make to direct the energy body is stagge ring. I know that it so unds awkw ard to tell you to view things with care and curiosity but that is the best way to describe what you shoul d do. At the third gate, dreamers have to avoi d a nearly irresistible impul se to plunge into everything, and they avoi d it by being so curiou s, so desperate to get into everything that they don’ t let any particular thing imprison them.” Don Juan adde d that his recom menda tions , which he kne w sounde d absurd to the mind, were directly aimed at my energy body . He stressed ove r and ove r that my ener gy body had to uni te all its resour ces in order to act. “But hasn’t my energy body been acting all along? ” I asked. “Part of it has, otherwise you woul dn’t have jour neyed to the inorganic beings ’ realm,” he replied. “Now your entire energy body has to be e nga ged to perform the drill of the third gate. Therefore, to make things easier for you r energy body , you must hol d back your rationa lity.” “I am afraid you are barking up the wrong tree,” I said. “There is very little rationa lity left in me after all the expe riences you’ ve brough t into my life.” “Don’ t say anyt hing. At the third gate, rationa lity is respons ible for the insistence of our energy bodi es on being obs essed with supe rfluous detail. At the third gate, then, we need irrationa l fluidity, irrationa l abandon to count eract that insistence.” Don Juan’s statement that each gate is an obs tacle coul d not have been more truthful. I labor ed to fulfill the drill of the third gate of dreaming more intensely than I had on the other two tasks com bined. Don Juan put tremendo us pressure on me. Besides, som ething else had been adde d to my life: a true sense of fear. I had been normally and even excessively afraid of one thing or anot her througho ut my life, but there had been not hing in my expe rience com parable to th e fear I felt after my bout with the inor ganic beings ."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 Yet all this wealth of expe rience was inaccessible to my nor mal memory. Only in the presence of don Juan were thos e memories at my dispos al. I asked him about this strange situation onc e when we were a t the Nationa l Museum of Anthropol ogy and History in Mexico City. What had prom pted my que stion was that, at the mom ent, I had the odd ability to remember everything that had happe ned to me in the cour se of my association with don Juan. And that made me fe el so free, so daring and light - foot ed that I was practically dancing around. “It just happe ns that the presence of the nagua l induces a shift of the assemblage poi nt,” he said. He gui ded me then into one of the display room s of the museum and said that my que stion was apropos to what he had been planni ng to tell me. “My intention was to expl ain to you that the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt is like a vault where sorcerers keep their records,” he said. “I was tickled pink when your energy body felt my int ent and you asked me about it. The energy body know s immensities. Let me show you how much it know s.” He instructed me to enter into total silence. He reminde d me that I was already in a special state of awareness, because my assemblage poi nt had been made to shift by his presence. He assured me that entering into total silence was goi ng to allow the sculptures in that room to make me see and hear inconc eivable things . He adde d, appa rently to increase my conf usion, that som e of the archaeological pieces in that room had the capacity to produc e, by themselves, a shift of the assemblage poi nt, and that if I reached a state of total silence I woul d be actually witnessing scenes pertaining to the lives of the peopl e who made thos e pieces. He then began the stran gest tour of a museum I have ever taken. He went around the room , describing and interpreting astoundi ng details of every one of the large pieces. According to him, every archaeologi cal piece in that room was a purpos eful record left by the peopl e of antiq uity, a record that don Juan as a sorcerer was reading to me as one woul d read a book: “Every piece here is designe d to make the assemblage poi nt shift,” he went on. “Fix your gaze on any of them, silence your mind, and find out whether or not your assembl age poi nt can be made to shift.” “How woul d I know that it has shifted?” “Because you woul d see and feel things that are beyond your normal reach.” I gazed at the sculptures and saw and heard things that I woul d be at a loss to expl ain. In the past, I had examined all thos e pieces with the bias of anthropol ogy , always bearing in mind the descriptions of schol ars in the field. Their descriptions of the func tions of thos e pieces, root ed in mode m man’s cogni tion of the world, appe ared to me, for the first time , to be utterly prejudi ced if not asinine. What don Juan said about thos e pieces and what I heard and saw myself, gazing at them, was the farthest thing from what I had always read about them. My discom fort was so great that I felt obl iged to apol ogi ze to don Juan for what I thought was my sugge stibility. He did not laugh or make fun of me. He patiently expl ained that"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 sorcerers were capable of leaving accurate records of their findi ngs in the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt. He maintained that when it com e s to getting to the essence of a written account , we have to use our sense of sym pathetic or imaginative participation to go beyond the mere page into the expe rience itself. How ever, in the sorcerers’ world, since there are no written pages, total records, which can be relived instead of read, are left in the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt. To illustrate his argum ent, don Juan talked about the sorcerers’ teachings for the second attention. He said that they are given when the apprentice’s assemblage poi nt is on a place other than the nor mal one . The pos ition of the assemblage poi nt becom es, in this manne r, the record of the lesson. In order to play the lesson back, the appr entice has to return his assemblage poi nt to the pos ition it occupied when the lesso n was given. Don Juan conc lude d his remarks by reiterating that to return the assemblage poi nt to all the pos itions it occupi ed when the lessons were given is an accom plishm ent of the highe st magni tude . For nearly a year, don Juan did not ask me anyt hing a bout my third dreaming task. Then one day, qui te abrupt ly, he wanted me to describe to him all the nua nces of my dreaming practices. The first thing I mentione d was a baffling recurrence. For a period of mont hs, I had dreams in which I found myself staring at me, sleeping in my bed. The odd part was the regul arity of thos e dreams; they happe ned every four days, like clockw ork. During the other three days, my dreaming was what it always had been so far: I examined every pos sible item in my dreams, I change d dreams, and occasiona lly, driven by a suicidal curiosity I follow ed the foreign energy scout s, although I felt extremely gui lty doi ng this. I fancied it to be like having a secret drug addi ction. The realness of that world was irresistible to me. Secretly, I felt som ehow exone rated from total respons ibility, because don Juan himself had sugge sted that I ask the dreaming emissary about what to do to free the blue scout trappe d among us. He meant for me to pos e the question in my every day practice, but I con strued his statement to imply that I had to ask the emissary while I was in its world. The que stion I really wanted to ask the emissary was whether the inor ganic beings had set a trap for me. The emissary not onl y told me that everything don Juan had said was true but also gave me instructions on what Carol Tiggs and I had to do to liberate the scout . “The regul arity of your dreams is som ething that I rather expe cted,” don Juan remarked, after listening to me. “Why did you expe ct som ething like that, don Ju an?” “Because of your relations hip with the inor ganic beings .” “That’s ove r and forgot ten, don Juan,” I lied, hopi ng he woul d not pur sue the subj ect any further. “You are saying that for my benefit, aren’t you? You don’ t need to; I know the true story. Bel ieve me, onc e you get to play with them, you are hooke d. They’ll always be after you . Or, what’s worse yet, you’ ll always be after them.”"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 He stared at me, and my gui lt must have been so obvi ous that it made him laugh. “The onl y pos sible expl anation for suc h regul arity is that the inorganic beings are catering to you again,” don Juan said in a serious tone . I hur ried to change the subj ect and told him that another nua nce of my dreaming practices worth mentioni ng was my reaction to the sight of myself lying s ound asleep. That view was always so startling that it either glued me to the spot unt il the dream change d or fright ened me so profoundl y that it made me wake up, screaming at the top of my voi ce. I had got ten to the poi nt where I was afraid to go to sleep on the days I kne w I was goi ng to have that dream. “You are not yet ready for a true merging of you r dreaming reality and your daily reality,” he conc lude d. “You must recapitulate you r life further.” “But I’ve done all the recapitulating pos sible,” I prot ested. “I’ve been recapitulating for years. There is not hing more I can remember about my life.” “There must be much more,” he said adamantly, “otherwise, you woul dn’t wake up screaming. ” I did not like the idea of having to recapitulate again. I had done it, and I believed I had done it so well that I did not need to touc h the subj ect ever again. “The recapitulation of our lives never ends , no matter how well we’ve done it onc e,” don Juan said. “The reason average peopl e lack vol ition in their dreams is th at they have never recapitulated and their lives are filled to capacity with heavily loaded emotions like memories, hope s, fears, et cetera, ct cetera. “Sorcerers, in cont rast, are relatively free from heavy bindi ng emotions , because of their recapitulatio n. And if som ething stops them, as it has stoppe d you at this mom ent, the assum ption is that there still is som ething in them that is not qui te clear.” “To recapitulate is too invol ving, don Juan. Maybe there is som ething else I can do instead.” “No. There isn’t. Recapitulating and dreaming go hand in hand. As we regur gitate our lives, we get more and more airborne.” Don Juan had given me very detailed and expl icit instructions about the recapitulation. It cons isted of reliving the totality of one ’s life ex periences by remembering every pos sible minut e detail of them. He saw the recapitulation as the essential factor in a dreamer’s redefinition and redeploym ent of energy “The recapitulation sets free energy imprisone d within us, and without this liberated en ergy dreaming is not pos sible.” That was his statement. Years before, don Juan had coached me to make a list of all the peopl e I had met in my life, starting at the present. He helped me to arrange my list in an orderly fashion, breaking it dow n into areas of activity, such as jobs I had had, school s I had attende d. Then he gui ded me to go, without deviation, from the first person on my list to the last one , reliving every one of my interactions with them. He expl ained that recapitulating an event starts wi th one ’s mind arrangi ng everything pertinent to what is being recapitulated. Arrangi ng means recons tructing the event, piece"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 by piece, starting by recollecting the phys ical details of the surroundi ngs , then goi ng to the person with whom one shared the inte raction, and then goi ng to one self, to the examination of one ’s feelings . Don Juan taught me that the recapitulation is coupl ed with a natural, rhyt hm ical breathing. Long exha lations are performed as the head move s gently and slow ly from right to left; and long inha lations are taken as the head move s back from left to right. He called this act of movi ng the head from side to side “fanni ng the event.” The mind examines the event from beginni ng to end while the body fans, on and on, everything the mind focuse s on. Don Juan said that the sorcerers of antiqui ty, the inventors of the recapitulation, viewed breathing as a magical, life - giving act and used it, accordingl y, as a magical vehicle; the exha lation, to eject the foreign energy left in them dur ing the int eraction being recapitulated and the inha lation to pul l back the energy that they themselves left behind dur ing the interaction. Because of my academic training, I took the recapitulation to be the process of analyzing one ’s life. But don Juan insisted tha t it was more invol ved than an intellectual psychoa nalysis. He pos tulated the recapitulation as a sorcerer’s ploy to induc e a minut e but steady displacement of the assemblage poi nt. He said that the assemblage poi nt, unde r the impact of reviewing past acti ons and feelings , goe s back and forth between its present site and the site it occupi ed when the event being recapitulated took place. Don Juan stated that the old sorcerers’ rationa le behind the recapitulation was their convi ction that there is an inconc e ivable dissolving force in the uni verse, which makes organisms live by lendi ng them awareness. That force also makes organisms die, in order to extract the same lent awareness, which organisms have enha nced through their life expe riences. Don Juan expl aine d the old sorcerers’ reasoni ng. They believed that since it is our life expe rience this force is after, it is of supr eme impor tance that it can be satisfied with a facsimile of our life expe rience: the recapitulation. Having had what it seeks, the dissolvi ng force then lets sorcerers go, free to expa nd their capacity to perceive and reach with it the conf ines of time and space. When I started again to recapitulate, it was a great surprise to me that my dreaming practices were autom atically suspende d the mom ent my recapitulation began. I asked don Juan about this unw anted recess. “Dreaming requi res every bit of our available energy, ” he replied. “If there is a deep preoccupa tion in our life, there is no pos sibility of dreaming. ” “But I have been deeply preocc upi ed before,” I said, “and my practices were never interrupt ed.” “It must be then that every time you thought you were preoccupi ed, you were onl y egom aniacally disturbed,” he said, laughi ng. “To be preoccupi ed, for sorcerers, means that all your energy so urces are taken on. This is the first time you’ ve enga ged your energy sour ces in their totality The rest of the time, even when you recapitulated before, you were not com pletely absorbed.” Don Juan gave me this time a new recapitulation pattern. I was supp osed to cons truct a jigsaw puz zle by recapitulating, without any appa rent order, different events of my life."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 “But it’s goi ng to be a mess,” I protested. “No, it won’t be,” he assured me. “It’ll be a mess if you let your pettiness choos e the events you are goi ng to recapitulate. Instead, let the spirit decide. Be silent, and then get to the event the spirit points out .” The results of that pattern of recapitulation were shoc king to me on many levels. It was very impressive to find out that, whenever I silen ced my mind, a seemingl y inde pende nt force immediately plunge d me into a most detailed memory of som e event in my life. But it was even more impressive that a very orderly configur ation resulted. What I thought was goi ng to be chaotic turned out to be extr emely effective. I asked don Juan why he had not made me recapitulate in this manne r from the start. He replied that there are two basic rounds to the recapitulation, that the first is called formality and rigidity, and the second fluidity I had no inkl ing about how different my recapitulation was goi ng to be this time. The ability to conc entrate, which I had acqui red by means of my dreaming practices, permitted me to examine my life at a depth I woul d never have imagined pos sible. It took me ove r a year to view and review all I coul d abou t my life expe riences. At the end, I had to agree with don Juan: there had been immensities of loaded emotions hidden so deeply inside me as to be virtually inaccessible. The result of my second recapitulation was a new, mo re relaxed attitude . The very day I returned to my dreaming practices, I dreamt I saw myself asleep. I turned around and daringl y left my room , penur ious ly goi ng dow n a flight of stairs to the street. I was elated with what I had done and repor ted it to do n Juan. My disappoi ntment was enor mous when he did not cons ider this dream part of my dreaming practices. He argue d that I had not gone to the street with my energy body, because if I had I woul d have had a sensation other than walking dow n a flight of sta irs. “What kind of sensation are you talking about , don Juan?” I asked, with genui ne curiosity “You have to establish som e valid gui de to find out whether you are actually seeing you r body asleep in your bed,” he said instead of answering my que stion. “Rem ember, you must be in you r actual room , seeing your actual body. Otherwise, what you are having is merely a dream. If that’s the case, cont rol that dream, either by obs erving its detail or by changi ng it.” I insisted he tell me more about the valid gui de h e had referred to, but he cut me shor t. “Figur e out a way to validate the fact that you are looki ng at your self,” he said. “Do you have any sugge stions as to what can be a valid gui de?” I insisted. “Use your ow n judgm ent. We are com ing to the end of our ti me toge ther. You have to be on your ow n very soon .” He change d the subj ect then, and I was left with a clear taste of my ineptitude . I was una ble to figure out what he wanted or what he meant by a valid gui de."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96 In the next dream in which I saw myself asleep , instead of leaving the room and walking dow n the stairs, or waking up screaming, I remained glued, for a long time, to the spot from which I watched. Without fretting or despairing, I obs erved the details of my dream. I not iced then that I was asleep wea ring a white T - shirt that was rippe d at the shoul der. I tried to com e closer and examine the rip, but movi ng was beyond my capabilities. I felt a heaviness that seemed to be part of my very being. In fact, I was all weight . Not know ing what to do next, I i nstantly entered into a devastating conf usion. I tried to change dreams, but som e una ccustom ed force kept me staring at m sleeping body. In the midst of my turmoil, I heard the dreaming emissary saying that not having cont rol to move around was fright ening me to the poi nt that I might have to do anot her recapitulation. The emissary’s voi ce and what it said did not surprise me at all. I had never felt so vividly and terrifyingl y una ble to move. I did not , how ever, give in to my terror. I examined it and foun d out that it was not a psychol ogi cal terror but a phys ical sensation of helplessness, despair, and annoya nce. It bot hered me beyond words that I was not capable of movi ng my limbs. My annoya nce grew in propor tion to my realization that som e thing out side me had me brutally pinne d dow n. The effort I made to move my arms or legs was so intense and singl e - minde d that at one mom ent I actually saw one leg of my body , sleeping on the bed, flung out as if kicking. My awareness was then pul led into my inert, sleep ing body, and I woke up with such a force that it took more than half an hour to calm myself dow n. My heart was beating almost erratically. I was shivering, and som e of the muscles in my legs twitched unc ont rollably. I had suffered such a radical loss of b ody heat that I needed blanke ts and hot - water bot tles to raise my temperature. Naturally, I went to Mexico to ask don Juan’s advi ce about the sensation of paralysis, and about the fact that I really had been wearing a ripped T - shirt, thus , I had inde ed see n myself asleep. Besides, I was deadly afraid of hyp othermia. He was reluctant to discuss my predicament. All I got out of him was a caustic remark. “You like drama,” he said flatly. “Of cour se you really saw your self asleep. The probl em is that you got ne rvous , because your energy body has never been cons cious ly in one piece before. If you ever get nervous and cold again, hol d on to your dick. That will restore your body temperature in a jiffy and without any fuss.” I felt a bit offende d by his crassness. How ever, the advi ce prove d effective. The next time I became fright ened, I relaxed and returned to normal in a few minut es, doi ng what he had prescribed. In this manne r, I discove red that if I did not fret and kept my annoya nce in check, I did not panic. T o remain cont rolled did not help me move , but it certainly gave me a deep sensation of peace and serenity After mont hs of useless efforts at walking, I sough t don Juan’s com ments onc e again, not so much for his advi ce this time but because I wanted to conc ede defeat. I was up against an impassable barrier, and I kne w with indi sput able certainty that I had failed. “Dreamers have to be imaginative,” don Juan said with a malicious grin. “Imaginative you are not . I didn’ t warn you about having to use your imagi nation to move your energy body because I wanted to find out whether you could resolve the riddl e by your self. You didn’ t, and your friends didn’ t help you either.”"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 97 In the past, I had been driven to defend myself vicious ly whenever he accused me of lacking imagination. I thought I was imaginative, but having don Juan as a teacher had taught me, the hard way, that I am not . Since I was not goi ng to enga ge my energy in futile defenses of myself, I asked him instead, “What is this riddl e you are talking about , don Juan?” “The riddl e of how impos sible and yet how easy it is to move the energy body . You are trying to move it as if you were in the daily world. We spend so much time and effort learning to walk that we believe our dreaming bodi es shoul d also walk. T here is no reason why they shoul d, except that walking is foremost in our minds .” I marveled at the simplicity of the solution. I instantly kne w that don Juan was right . I had got ten stuck again at the level of interpretation. He had told me I had to move around onc e I reached the third gate of dreaming, and to me movi ng around meant walking. I told him that I unde rstood his poi nt. “It isn’t my poi nt,” he curtly answered. “It’s a sorcerers’ poi nt. Sorcerers say that at the third gate the entire energy body can move like energy move s: fast and directly. Your energy body know s exactly how to move . It can move as it move s in the inor ganic beings ’ world. “And this brings us to the other issue here,” don Juan adde d with an air of pensiveness. “Why didn’ t you r ino rganic being friends help you ?” “Why do you call them my friends , don Juan?” “They are like the classic friends who are not really thought ful or kind to us but not mean either. The friends who are just waiting for us to turn our backs so they can stab us t here.” I unde rstood him com pletely and agreed with him one hundr ed percent. “What makes me go there? Is it a suicidal tende ncy?” I asked him, more rhetorically than not . “You don’ t have any suicidal tende ncy” he said. “What you have is a total disbelief th at you were near death. Since you were not in phys ical pain, you can’t quite convi nce your self you were in mortal dange r.” His argum ent was most reasona ble, except that I did believe a deep, unknow n fear had been ruling my life since my bout with the inor g anic beings . Don Juan listened in silence as I described to him my predicament. I coul d not discard or expl ain away my urge to go to the inorganic beings ’ world, in spite of what I knew about it. “I have a streak of insanity,” I said. “What I do doesn’t ma ke sense.” “It doe s make sense. The inorganic beings are still reeling YOU in, like a fish hooke d at the end of a line,” he said. “They throw worthless bait at you from time to time to keep you goi ng. To arrange you r dreams to occur every four days with ou t fail is worthless bait. But they didn’ t teach you how to move your energy body. ” “Why do you think they didn’t?”"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 98 “Because when your energy body learns to move by itself, you’ ll be thor ough ly out of their reach. It was premature of me to believe that you are free from them. You are relatively but not com pletely free. They are still biddi ng for your awareness.” I felt a chill in my back. He had touc hed a sore spot in me. “Tell me what to do, don Juan, and I’ll do it,” I said. “Be impeccable. I have told you this doz ens of times. To be impeccable means to put your life on the line in order to back up your decisions , and then to do quite a lot more than your best to realize thos e decisions . When you are not deciding any thing, you are merely playing roul ette w ith your life in a helter - skelter way.” Don Juan ende d our conve rsation, urging me to ponde r what he had said. At the first oppor tuni ty I had, I put don Juan’s sugge stion about movi ng my energy body to the test. When I found myself looki ng at my bod y aslee p, instead of struggl ing to walk tow ard it I simply willed myself to move closer to the bed. Instantly, I was nearly touc hing my body . I saw my face. In fact, I coul d see every por e in my skin. I cannot say that I liked what I saw. My view of my ow n body w as too detailed to be aesthetically pleasing. Then som ething like a wind came into the room , totally disarrange d everything, and erased my view. During subs eque nt dreams, I entirely corrobor ated that the onl y way the energy body can move is to glide or soa r. I discussed this with don Juan. He seemed unus ually satisfied with what I had done , which certainly surprised me. I was accustom ed to his cold reaction to anyt hing I did in my dreaming practices. “Your energy body is used to movi ng onl y when som ething p ulls it,” he said. “The inor ganic beings have been pul ling your energy body right and left, and unt il now you have never move d it by you rself, with your ow n volition. It doe sn’t seem like you’ ve done much, movi ng the way you did, yet I assure you that I wa s serious ly cons idering endi ng your practices. For a while, I believed you were not goi ng to learn how to move on your ow n.” “Were you cons idering endi ng my dreaming practices because I am slow ?” “You’ re not slow . It takes sorcerers forever to learn to mov e the energy body . I was goi ng to end your dreaming practices because I have no more time. There are other topi cs, more pressing than dreaming, on which you can use you r energy. ” “Now that I’ve learned how to move my energy body by myself, what else shoul d I do, don Juan?” “Cont inue movi ng. Movi ng you r energy body has ope ned up a new area for you, an area of extraordinary expl oration.” He urged me again to com e up with an idea to validate the faithfulness of my dreams; that reque st did not seem as odd as it had the first time he voi ced it. “As you know , to be transpor ted by a scout is the real dreaming task of the second gate,” he expl ained. “It is a very serious matter, but not as serious as forging and movi ng the energy body. Therefore, you have to make su re, by som e means of your ow n, whether you are actually seeing your self asleep or whether you are merely dreaming that you’ re"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 seeing your self asleep. Your new extraordinary exploration hinge s on really seeing your self asleep.” After som e heavy ponde ring an d wonde ring, I believed that I had com e up with the right plan. Having seen my rippe d T - shirt gave me an idea for a valid gui de. I started from the assum ption that, if I were actually obs erving myself asleep, I woul d also be obs erving whether I had the sam e sleeping attire I had gone to bed in, an attire that I had decided to change radically every four days. I was conf ident that I was not goi ng to have any difficulty in remembering, in dreams, what I was wearing when I went to bed; the discipline I had acq uired through my dreaming practices made me think that I had the ability to record things like this in my mind and remember them in dreams. I enga ged my best efforts to follow this gui de, but the results did not pan out as I though t they woul d, I lacked th e necessary cont rol ove r my dreaming attention, and I coul d not qui te remember the details of my sleeping attire. Yet som ething else was definitely at work; som ehow I always kne w whether my dreams were ordinary dreams or not . The out standi ng aspect of the dreams that were not just ordinary dreams was that my body lay asleep in bed while my cons cious ness obs erved it. A not able feature of these dreams was my room . It was never like my room in the daily world but an enor mous empty hall with my bed at one end. I used to soar ove r a cons iderable distance to be at the side of the bed where my body lay. The moment I was next to it, a windl ike force used to make me hove r ove r it, like a hum mingbi rd. At times the room used to vanish; disappe ar piece by piece unt il o nly my body and the bed were left. At other times, I used to expe rience a com plete loss of vol ition. My dreaming attention seemed then to func tion inde pende ntly of me. Either it was com pletely absorbed by the first item it encount ered in the room or it see med una ble to decide what to do. In thos e instances, I had the sensation that I was helplessly floating, goi ng from item to item. The, voi ce of the dreaming emissary expl ained to me onc e that all the elements of the dreams, which were not just com monpl ace dreams, were really energy conf igur ations different from thos e of our normal world. The emissary’s voi ce poi nted out that, for example, the walls were liqui d. It urged me then to plunge into one of them. Without thinki ng twice, I dived into a wall as if I were diving into a huge lake. I did not feel the waterlike wall; what I felt was not a phys ical sensation of plungi ng into a body of water either. It was more like the thought of diving and the visual sensation of goi ng through liqui d matter. I was goi ng, head first, into som ething that ope ned up, like water doe s, as I kept movi ng dow nw ard. The sensation of goi ng dow n, headfirst, was so real that I began to wonde r how long or how deep or how far I was diving. From my point of view, I spent an eternity in th ere. I saw clouds and rocklike masses of matter suspende d in a waterlike subs tance. There were som e glow ing, geom etric obj ects that resembled crystals, and blobs of the deepest primary colors I had ever seen. There were also zones of intense light and othe rs of pitch blackne ss. Everything went by me, either slow ly or at a fast speed. I had the thought that I was viewing the cosmos. At, the instant of that thought , my speed increased so immensely that everything became blurred, and all of a sudde n, I found m yself awake with my nos e smack against the wall of my room."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 100 Som e hidde n fear urged me to cons ult with don Juan. He listened to me, hangi ng on every word. “You need to do som e drastic maneuve ring at this poi nt,” he said. “The dreaming emissary has no bus ine ss interfering with you r dreaming practices. Or rather, you shoul d not , unde r any condi tions , permit it to do so.” “How can I stop it?” “Perform a simple but difficult maneuve r. Upon entering into dreaming, voi ce out loud your desire not to have the dreami ng emissary anym ore.” “Does that mean, don Juan, that I will never hear it again?” “Positively. You’ ll get rid of it forever.” “But is it advi sable to get rid of it forever?” “It most certainly is, at this poi nt.” With thos e words, don Juan invol ved me in a most disturbing dilemma. I did not want to put an end to my relations hip with the emissary, but, at the same time, I wanted to follow don Juan’s advi ce. He not iced my hesitation. “I know it’s a very difficult affair,” he conc eded, “but if you don’ t do i t, the inorganic beings will always have a line on you. If you want to avoi d this, do what I said, and do it now .” During my next dreaming session, as I prepared myself to utter my intent, the emissary’s voi ce interrupt ed me. It said, “If you refrain from stating your reque st, I prom ise you never to interfere with your dreaming practices and talk to you onl y if you ask me direct que stions .” I instantly accepted its propos ition and sincerely felt that it was a good deal. I was even relieved it had turned out this way. I was afraid, however, that don Juan was goi ng to be disappoi nted. “It was a good maneuve r,” he remarked and laughe d. “You were sincere; you really intende d to voi ce you r reque st. To be sincere is all that was requi red. There was, essentially, n o need for you to eliminate the emissary. What you wanted was to corner it into propos ing an alternative way, conve nient to you. I am sure the emissary won’ t interfere anym ore.” He was right . I cont inue d my dreaming practices without any meddl ing from the emissary The remarkable cons eque nce was that I began to have dreams in which my dream room s were my room in the daily world, with one difference: in the dreams, my room was always so slanted, so distorted that it looke d like a giant cubi st painting; obtuse and acute angl es were the rule instead of the nor mal right angl es of walls, ceiling, and floor . In my lops ided room , the very slant, created by the acute or obt use angl es, was a device to display prom inently som e absurd, supe rfluous , but real detail; for example, intricate lines in the hardw ood floor , or weather discolorations in the wall paint, or dus t spot s on the ceiling, or smudge d finge r prints on the edge of a door ."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 101 In thos e dreams, I una voi dably got lost in the waterlike uni verses of the detail poi n ted out by the slant. During my entire dreaming practices, the profusion of detail in my room was so immense and its pul l so intense that it instantly made me dive into it. At the first free mom ent I had, I was at don Juan’s place, cons ulting him about thi s state. “I can’t ove rcom e my room ,” I said to him after I had given him the details of my dreaming practices. “What gives you the idea you have to ove rcom e it?” he; asked with a grin. “I feel that I have to move beyond my room , don Juan.” “But you are mov ing beyond your room . Perhaps you shoul d ask your self whether you are caught again in interpretations . What do you think movi ng means in this case?” I told him walking from my room to the street had been such a haunt ing dream for me that I felt a real need to do it again. “But you are doi ng greater things than that,” he protested. “You are goi ng to unbe lievable regions . What else do you want?” I tried to expl ain to him that I had a phys ical urge to move away from the trap of detail. What ups et me the most w as my incapacity to free myself from whatever caught my attention. To have a modi cum of vol ition was the bottom line for me. A very long silence follow ed. I waited to hear more about the trap of detail. After all, he had warned me about its dange rs. “You a re doi ng fine,” he finally said. “Dreamers take a very long time to perfect their energy bodi es. And this is exactly what’s at stake here: perfecting your energy body .” Don Juan expl ained that the reason my energy bod y was com pelled to examine detail and g et inextricably stuck in it was its inexpe rience, its incom pleteness. He said that sorcerers spend a lifetime cons olidating the energy body by letting it sponge up everything pos sible. “Until the energy body is com plete and mature, it is self - absorbed,” d on Juan went on. “It can’t get free from the com pul sion to be absorbed by everything. But if one takes this into cons ideration, instead of fight ing the energy body, as you’ re doi ng now , one can lend it a hand. ” “How can I do that, don Juan?” “By directing its behavior, that is to say, by stalking it.” He expl ained that since everything related to the energy body depends on the appr opr iate pos ition of the assemblage poi nt, and since dreaming is not hing else but the means to displace it, stalking is, cons eque ntly, the way to make the assemblage poi nt stay put on the perfect pos ition, in this case, the pos ition where the energy body can becom e cons olidated and from which it can finally emerge. Don Juan said that the mom ent the energy body can move on its ow n, s orcerers assum e that the opt imum pos ition of the assemblage poi nt has been reached. The next step is to stalk it, that is, to fixate it on that pos ition in order to com plete the energy body. He remarked that the procedur e is simplicity itself. One intends to stalk it."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 Silence and looks of expe ctation follow ed that statement. I expe cted him to say more, and he expe cted me to have unde r stood what he had said. I had not . “Let your energy body intend to reach the optimum dreaming pos ition,” he expl ained. “Then , let your energy body intend to stay at that position and you will be stalking. ” He paused and, with his eyes, urged me to cons ider his statement. “Intendi ng is the secret, but you already know that,” he said. “Sorcerers displace their assemblage poi nts t hrough intendi ng and fixate them, equa lly, throug h intendi ng. And there is no techni que for intendi ng. One intends through Usage.” To have anot her of my wild assum ptions about my worth as a sorcerer was una voi dable at that poi nt. I had bound less conf idence that som ething was goi ng to put me on the right track to intend the fixation of my assemblage poi nt on the ideal spot . I, had accom plished in the past all kinds of successful maneuve rs without know ing how I performed them. Don Juan himself had marveled at my ability or my luck, and I was sure this was goi ng to be one of thos e instances. I was gravely mistaken. No matter what I did, or how long I waited, I had no success whatsoever in fixing my assemblage poi nt on any spot , much less on the ideal one . After mont hs of serious but uns uccessful struggl ing, I gave up. “I really believed I coul d do it,” I said to don Juan, the moment I was in his hous e. “I am afraid that now adays I am more of an egom aniac than ever.” “Not really,” he said with a smile. “What happ ens is that you are caught in anot her of your rout inary misinterpretations of terms. You want to find the ideal spot , as if you were findi ng your lost car keys. Then you want to tie your assemblage poi nt, as if you were tying your shoe s. The ideal spot and the fixation of the assemblage poi nt are metaphor s. They have not hing to do with the words used to describe them.” He asked me then to tell him the latest events of any dreaming practices. The first thing I mentione d was that my urge to be absorbed by det ail had subs ided not ably. I said that perhaps because I move d in my dreams, com pul sively, and incessantly, the move ment might have been what always managed to stop me before I plunge d into the detail I was obs erving. To be stoppe d in that fashion gave me t he oppor tuni ty to examine the act of being absorbed by detail. I came; to the conc lusion that inanimate matter actually pos sesses an immobi lizing force, which I saw as a beam of dul l light that kept me pinne d dow n. For example, many times som e minute mark on the walls or in the wood lines of the hard wood floor of my room used to send a line of light that trans fixed me; from the mom ent my dreaming attention was focused on that light , the whol e dream rotated around that minute mark. I saw it enlarged perhap s to the size of the cosmos. That view used to last unt il I woke up, usually with my nos e pressed against the wall or the wood floor . My ow n obs ervations were that, in the first place, the detail was real, and, in the second place, I seemed to have been ob serving it while I was asleep. Don Juan smiled and said, “All this is happe ning to you because the forging of your energy body was com pleted the mom ent it move d by itself. I didn’ t tell you that, but I insinua ted it. I wanted to know whether or not you wer e capable of findi ng it out by your self, which, of cour se, you did.”"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 103 I had no idea what he meant. Don Juan scrutinized me in his usual manne r. His penetrating gaze scanne d my body. “What exactly did I find out by myself, don Juan?” I was forced to ask. “Yo u found out that you r energy body had been com pleted,” he answered. “I didn’ t find out anyt hing of the kind, I assure you .” “Yes, you did. It started som e time ago, when you coul dn’ t find a gui de to validate the realness of your dreams, but then som ething went to work for you and let you know whether you were having a regul ar dream. That something was your energy body. Now , you despair that you coul dn’ t find the ideal spot to fix your assemblage poi nt. And I tell you that you did. The proof is that, by movi ng around, your energy body curtailed its obs ession with detail.” I was nonpl ussed. I coul d not even ask one of my feeble que stions . “What com es next for you is a sorcerers’ gem,” don Juan went on. “You are goi ng to practice seeing energy, in your dreaming . You have fulfilled the drill for the third gate of dreaming: movi ng your energy body by itself. Now you are going to perform the real task: seeing energy with your energy body . “You have seen energy before,” he went on, “many times, in fact. But each of thos e times, seeing was a fluke . Now you are goi ng to do it deliberately. “Dreamers have a rule of thum b,” he cont inue d. “If their energy body is com plete, they see energy every time they gaze at an item in the daily world. In dreams, if they see the energ y of an item, they know they are dealing with a real world, no matter how distorted that world may appe ar to their dreaming attention. If they can’t see the energy of an item, they are in an ordinary dream and not in a real world.” “What is a real world, d on Juan?” “A world that generates energy; the oppos ite of a phantom world of projections , where not hing generates energy, like most of our dreams, where not hing has an energetic effect.” Don Juan then gave me anot her definition of dreaming: a process by wh ich dreamers isolate dream condi tions in which they can find energy - generating elements. He must have not iced my bewilderment. He laughe d and gave anot her, even more convol uted definition: dreaming is the process by which we intend to find adequa te pos itio ns of the assemblage poi nt, pos itions that permit us to perceive energy - generating items in dreamlike states. He expl ained that the energy body is also capable of perceiving energy that is qui te different from the energy of our ow n world, as in the case of items of the inorganic beings ’ realm, which the energy body perceives as sizzling energy. He adde d that in our world not hing sizzles; everything here wavers. “From now on,” he said, “the issue of your dreaming is goi ng to be to determine whether the items on which you focus you r dreaming attention are energy generating, mere pha ntom projections , or generators of foreign energy. ”"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104 Don Juan adm itted that he had hope d I was goi ng to com e up with the idea of seeing energy as the gauge to determine whether or no t I was obs erving my real body asleep. He laughe d at my spur ious device of put ting on elabor ate sleeping attire, every four days. He said that I’d had, at my finge r tips, all the information necessary to deduc e what was the real task of the third gate of d reaming and to com e up with the right idea but that my interpretation system had forced me to seek cont rived solutions that lacked the simplicity and directness of sorcery. I CHAPTER 9 THE NEW AREA OF EXPLORATION Don Juan told me that in order to see in dreaming not onl y did I have to intend seeing but I had to put my intent into loud words. For reasons he refused to expl ain, he insisted that I had to speak up. He conc eded that there are other means to accom plish the same result, but he asserted that voi c ing one ’s intent is the simplest and most direct way. The first time I put into words my intent to see, I was dreaming of a chur ch bazaar. There were so many articles that I coul d not make up my mind which one to gaze at. A giant, cons picuous vase in a cor ner made up my mind for me. I gazed at it, voi cing my intent to see. The vase remained in my view for an instant, then it change d into anot her obj ect. I gazed at as many things as I coul d in that dream. After I voi ced my intent to see, every item I had cho sen to gaze at vanished or turned into som ething else, as had happe ned all along in my dreaming practices. My dreaming attention was finally exha usted, and I woke up tremendous ly frustrated, almost angr y. For mont hs on end, I actually gazed at hund reds of items in my dreams and deliberately voi ced my intent to see, but not hing ever happe ned. Tired of waiting, I finally had to ask don Juan about it. “You need to have patience. You are learning to do som e thing extraordinary” he remarked. “You are learning to intend to see in your dreams. Som eday you will not have to voi ce your intent; you ’ll simply will it, silently.” “I think I have not unde rstood the func tion of whatever I am doi ng, ” I said. “Nothing happe ns when I shout my intent to see. What doe s that mea n?” “It means that your dreams, so far, have been ordinary dreams; they have been pha ntom projections ; images that have life onl y in your dreaming attention. ” He wanted to know exactly what had happe ned to the items on which I had focused my gaze. I said t hat they had vanished or change d shape or even produc ed vor texes that eventually change d my dreams. “It has been like that in all my daily dreaming practices,” I said. “The onl y thing out of the ordinary is that I am learning to yell in my dreams, at the t op of my voi ce.”"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 105 My last statement threw don Juan into a genui ne fit of belly laught er, which I found disconc erting. I failed to find the hum or of my statement or the reason for his reaction. “Som eday you’ ll appr eciate how funny all this is,” he said as an answer to my silent protest. “In the meantime, don’ t give up or get discour aged. Keep on trying. Soone r or later, you ’ll hit the right not e.” As usual, he was right . A coupl e of mont hs later, I hit the jackpot . I had a most unus ual dream. It started with the appe arance of a scout from the inorganic beings ’ world. The scout s as well as the dreaming emissary had been strange ly absent from my dreams. I had not missed them or ponde red their disappe arance. In fact, I was so at ease without them I had even forgo tten to ask don Juan about their absence. In that dream, the scout had been, at first, a gigantic yellow topa z, which I had found stuck in the back of a drawer. The moment I voi ced my intent to see, the topa z turned into a blob of sizzling energy. I feared that I woul d be com pelled to follow it, so I move d my gaze away from the scout and focused it on an aqua rium with tropi cal fish. I voi ced my intent to see and got a tremendous surprise. The aquarium emitted a low , greenish glow and change d into a large su rrealist portrait of a bejeweled wom an. The por trait emitted the same greenish glow when I voi ced my intent to see. As I gazed at that glow , the whol e dream change d. I was walking then on a street in a tow n that seemed familiar to me; it might have been Tu cson. I gazed at a display of wom en’s clothes in a store window and spoke out loud my intent to see. Instantly, a black manne qui n, prom inently displayed, began to glow . I gazed next at a saleslady who came at that mom ent to rearrange the window . She looke d at me. After voi cing my intent, I saw her glow . It was so stupe ndous that I was afraid some detail in her splendor ous glow woul d trap me, but the wom an move d inside the store before I had time to focus my total attention on her. I certainly intende d to fo llow her inside; how ever, my dreaming attention was caught by a movi ng glow . It came to me charging, filled with hatred. There was loathing in it and vicious ness. I jum ped backw ard. The glow stoppe d its charge; a black subs tance swallow ed me, and I woke up . These images were so vivid that I firmly believed I had seen energy and my dream had been one of thos e condi tions that don Juan had called dreamlike, energy - generating. The idea that dreams can take place in the cons ensual reality of our daily world intr igue d me, just as the dream images of the inorganic beings ’ realm had intrigue d me. “This time, you not onl y saw energy but crossed a dange rous bounda ry,” don Juan said, after hearing my account . He reiterated that the drill for the third gate of dreaming is to make the energy body move on its ow n. In my last session, he said, I had unw ittingl y supe rseded the effect of that drill and crossed into anot her world. “Your energy body move d,” he said. “It jour neyed, by itself. That kind of jour neying is beyond yo ur abilities at this mom ent, and som ething attacked you. ” “What do you think it was, don Juan?” “This is a predatorial uni verse. It coul d have been one of thous ands of things existing out there.”"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 106 “Why do you think it attacked me?” “For the same reason the inor ganic beings attacked you: because you made you rself available.” “Is it that clear - cut, don Juan?” “Certainly. It’s as clear - cut as what you woul d do if a strange - looki ng spider crept across your desk while you were writing. You’ d squa sh it, out of fri ght , rather than adm ire it or examine it.” I was at a loss and searched for words to ask the prope r que stion. I wanted to ask him where my dream had taken place, or what world I was in in that dream. But thos e que stions did not make any sense; I coul d gath er that myself. Don Juan was very unde rstandi ng. “You want to know where your dreaming attention was focused, don’ t you? ” he asked with a grin. This was exactly how I wanted to word my que stion. I reasone d that in the dream unde r cons ideration, I must have been looki ng at som e real obj ect. Just like what had happe ned when I saw in dreams the minut e details on the floor or the walls or the doo r of my room , details that I later had corrobor ated existed. Don Juan said that in special dreams, like the one I’d h ad, our dreaming attention focuses on the daily world, and that it move s instantly from one real obj ect to anot her in the world. What makes this move ment pos sible is that the assemblage poi nt is on the prope r dreaming pos ition. From that pos ition the assem blage poi nt gives the dreaming attention such fluidity that it can move in a split second ove r incredible distances and in doi ng so it produc es a perception so fast, so fleeting that it resembles an ordinary dream. Don Juan expl ained that in my dream I had seen a real vase and then my dreaming attention had move d ove r distances to see a real surrealist painting of a bejeweled wom an. The result, with the exception of seeing energy, had been very close to ordinary dream, in which items, when gazed at, qui ckly turn into som ething else. “I know how disturbing this is,” he went on, definitely aware of my bewilderment. “For som e reason pertinent to the mind, to see energy in dreaming is more ups etting than anyt hing one can think of.” I remarked that I had seen ene rgy in dreaming before, yet it had never affected me like this. “Now your energy body is com plete and func tioni ng, ” he said. “Therefore, the implication that you see energy in your dream is that you are perceiving a real world, through the veil of a dream. That’s the impor tance of the journey you took. It was real. It invol ved energy - generating items that nearly ende d your life.” “Was it that serious , don Juan?” “You bet! The creature that attacked you was made of pure awareness and was as deadly as anyt hin g can be. You saw its energy. I am sure that you realize by now that unl ess we see in dreaming, we can’t tell a real, energy - generating thing from a pha ntom projection. So, even though you battled the inorganic beings and inde ed saw the scout s and the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 107 tunn els, your energy body doe sn’t know for sure if they were real, meaning energy generating. You are ninety - nine but not one hund red percent sure.” Don Juan insisted on talking about the jour ney I had taken. For inexpl icable reasons , I was reluctant to deal w ith that subj ect. What he was saying produc ed an instantaneous reaction in me. I found myself trying to com e to grips with a deep, strange fear; it was dark and obs essive in a naggi ng, visceral way. “You definitely went into anot her layer of the oni on,” do n Juan said, finishing a statement to which I had not paid attention. “What is this other layer of the oni on, don Juan?” “The world is like an onion, it has many skins. The world we know is but one of them. Som etimes, we cross bounda ries and enter into ano ther skin: anot her world, very much like this one , but not the same. And you entered into one , all by you rself.” “How is this jour ney you ’re talking about pos sible, don Juan?” “That is a meaningl ess que stion, because no one can answer it. In the view of so rcerers, the uni verse is cons tructed in layers, which the energy body can cross. Do you know where the old sorcerers are still existing to this day? In anot her layer, in anot her skin of the oni on. ” “For me, the idea of a real, pragm atic journey, taken in d reams, is very difficult to unde rstand or to accept, don Juan.” “We have discussed this topi c to exha ustion. I was convi nced you unde rstood that the jour ney of the energy body depends exclusively on the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt.” “You’ ve told me th at. And I have been mulling it over and ove r; still, saying that the jour ney is in the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt doe sn’t say anyt hing to me.” “Your probl em is your cyni cism. I was just like you. Cyni cism doe sn’t allow us to make drastic change s in o ur unde r standi ng of the world. It also forces us to feel that we are always right .” I unde rstood his poi nt to perfection, but I reminde d him about my fight against all that. “I propos e that you do one nons ensical thing that might turn the tide,” he said. “Repeat to your self incessantly that the hinge of sorcery is the mystery of the assemblage poi nt. If you repeat this to your self long enough, som e uns een force takes ove r and makes the appr opr iate change s in you. ” Don Juan did not give me any indi cation th at he was being facetious . I kne w he meant every word of it. What bot hered me was his insistence that I repeat the formula ceaselessly to myself. I caught myself thinki ng that all of it was asinine. “Cut your cyni cal attitude ,” he snappe d at me. “Repeat th is in a bona fide manne r. “The mystery of the assemblage poi nt is everything in sorcery,” he cont inue d, without looki ng at me. “Or rather, everything in sorcery rests on the manipul ation of the assemblage poi nt. You know all this, but you have to repeat it .” For an instant, as I heard his remarks, I though t I was goi ng to die of angui sh. An incredible sense of phys ical sadne ss grippe d my chest and made me scream with pain."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 108 My stom ach and diaphr agm seemed to be pus hing up, movi ng into my chest cavity The pus h was so intense that my awareness change d levels, and I entered into my normal state. Whatever we had been talking about became a vague thought about som ething that might have happe ned but actually had not , according to the munda ne reasoni ng of my everyda y - life cons cious ness. The next time don Juan and I talked about dreaming, we discussed the reasons I had been una ble to proceed with my dreaming practices for mont hs on end. Don Juan warned me that to expl ain my situation he had to go in a roundabout way. He poi nted out , first, that there is an enor mous difference between the thoug hts and deeds of the men of antiqui ty and thos e of mode rn men. Then he poi nted out that the men of ancient times had a very realistic view of perception and awareness because thei r view stemmed from their obs ervations of the uni verse around them. Mode rn men, in cont rast, have an absurdly unr ealistic view of perception and awareness because their view stems from their obs ervations of the social order and from their dealings with it. “Why are you telling me this?” I asked. “Because you are a mode rn man invol ved with the views and obs ervations of men of antiqui ty,” he replied. “And none of thos e views and obs ervations are familiar to you. Now more than ever you need sobr iety and aplom b . I am trying to make a solid bridge , a bridge you can walk on, between the views of men of ancient times and thos e of mode rn men.” He remarked that of all the transcende ntal obs ervations of the men of ancient times, the onl y one with which I was familiar, because it had filtered dow n to our day, was the idea of selling our soul s to the devil in exchange for immortality, which he adm itted sounde d to him like som ething com ing straight out of the relations hip of the old sorcerers with the inor ganic beings . He reminde d me how the dreaming emissary had tried to induc e me to stay in its realm by offering me the pos sibility of maintaining my individua lity and self - awareness for nearly an eternity. “As you know , succum bing to the lure of the inorganic beings is not just an idea; it’s real,” don Juan went on. “But you haven’t yet fully realized the implication of that realness. Dreaming, likewise, is real; it is an energy - generating condi tion. You hear my statements and you certainly unde rstand what I mean, but you r awareness hasn’t caught up with the total implication of it yet.” Don Juan said that my rationa lity kne w the import of a realization of this nature, and dur ing our last talk it had forced my awareness to change levels. I ende d up in my nor mal awareness bef ore I coul d deal with the nua nces of my dream. My rationa lity had further protected itself by suspendi ng my dreaming practices. “I assure you that I am fully aware of what an energy - generating condi tion means,” I said. “And I assure you that you are not ,” he retorted. “If you were, you woul d measure dreaming with greater care and deliberation. Since you believe you are just dreaming, you take blind chances. Your faulty reasoni ng tells you that no matter what happe ns, at a given mom ent the dream will be ove r and you will wake up. ”"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 109 He was right . In spite of all the things I had witnessed in my dreaming practices, som ehow I still retained the general sense, that all of it had been a dream. “I am talking to you about the views of men of antiqui ty and the views o f mode rn man,” don Juan went on, “because your awareness, which is the awareness of mode rn man, prefers to deal with an unf amiliar conc ept as if it were an empty ideality. “If I left it up to you, you’ d regard dreaming as an idea. Of course, I’m sure you t ake dreaming serious ly, but you don ’t qui te believe in the reality of dreaming.” “1 unde rstand what you are saying, don Juan, but I don’ t unde rstand why you are saying it.” “I am saying all this because you are now , for the first time, in the prope r pos iti on to unde rstand that dreaming is an energy - generating condi tion. For the first time, you can unde rstand now that ordinary dreams are the honi ng devices used to train the assemblage poi nt to reach the pos ition that creates this energy - generating condi tion we call dreaming. ” He warned me that, since dreamers touc h and enter real worlds of all - inclusive effects, they ought to be in a permanent state of the most intense and sustained alertness; any deviation from total alertness imperils the dreamer in ways mo re than dreadful. I began again, at this point, to expe rience a move ment in my chest cavity, exactly as I had felt the day my awareness change d levels by itself. Don Juan forcibly shook me by the arm. “Regard dreaming as som ething extremely dange rous !” he com mande d me. “And begin that now ! Don’t start any of your weird maneuve rs.” His tone of voi ce was so urgent that I stoppe d whatever I was, unc ons cious ly, doi ng. “What is goi ng on with me, don Juan?” I asked. “What’s goi ng on with you is that you can displ ace your assemblage poi nt qui ckly and easily,” he said. “Yet that ease has the tende ncy to make the displacement erratic. Bring your ease to order. And don’ t allow you rself even a fraction of an inch leeway.” I coul d easily have argue d that I did not know what he was talking about , but I kne w. I also kne w I had onl y a few seconds to round up my energy and change my attitude , and I did. This was the end of our exchange that day. I went hom e, and for nearly a year I faithfully and daily repeated what don Juan had asked me to say. The results of my litany - like invoc ation were incredible. I was firmly convi nced that it had the same effect on my awareness that exercise has on the muscles of the body. My assemblage poi nt became. more agile, which meant that seeing energy in dreaming became the sole goa l of my practices. My skill at intendi ng to see grew in proportion to my efforts. A mom ent came when I was able just to intend seeing, without saying a word, and actually expe rience the same result as when I voi ced ou t loud my intent to see. Don Juan congr atulated me on my accom plishm ent. I, naturally, assum ed he was being facetious . He assured me that he meant it, but beseeched me to cont inue shout ing, at least"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 when ever I was at a loss. His reque st did not seem odd t o me. On my ow n, I had been yelling in my dreams at the top of my voi ce every time I deemed it necessary I discove red that the energy of our world wavers. It scintillates. Not onl y living beings but everything in our world glimmers with an inne r light of i ts ow n. Don Juan expl ained that the energy of our world cons ists of layers of shimmering hue s. The top layer is whitish; anot her, immediately adjacent to it, is chartreuse; and anot her one , more distant yet, is amber. I found all thos e hue s, or rather I sa w glimmers of them whenever items that I encount ered in my dreamlike states change d shapes. How ever, a whitish glow was always the initial impact of seeing anyt hing that generated energy. “Are there onl y three different hue s?” I asked don Juan. “There is a n endl ess num ber of them,” he replied, “but for, the pur pos es of a beginni ng order, you shoul d be conc erned with thos e three. Later on, you can get as sophi sticated as you want and isolate doz ens of hue s, if you are able to do it. “The whitish layer is the hue of the present pos ition of manki nd’s assemblage poi nt,” don Juan cont inue d. “Let’s say that it is a mode rn hue . Sorcerers believe that everything man doe s now adays is tinted with that whitish glow . At anot her time, the pos ition of manki nd’ s assemblage poi nt made the hue of the ruling energy in the world chartreuse; and at anot her time, more distant yet, it made it amber. The color of sorcerers’ energy is amber, which means that they are energetically associated with the men who existed in a distant pas t.” “Do you think, don Juan, that the present whitish hue will change som eday?” “If man is capable of evol ving. The grand task of sorcerers is to bring forth the idea that, in order to evol ve, man must first free his awareness from its bindi ngs to the soci al order. Once aware ness is free, intent will redirect it into a new evol utiona ry path.” “Do you think sorcerers will succeed in that task?” “They have already succeeded. They themselves are the proof . To convi nce others of the value and impor t of evol vin g is anot her matter.” The other kind of energy I found present in our world but alien to it was the scout s’ energy, the energy don Juan had called sizzling. I encount ered scores of items in my dreams that, onc e I saw them, turned into blobs of energy that seemed to be frying, bubbl ing with som e heatlike inne r activity. “Bear in mind that not every scout you are goi ng to find belongs to the realm of inor ganic beings ,” don Juan remarked. “Every scout you have found so far, except for the blue scout , has been from that realm, but that was because the inor ganic beings were catering to you. They were directing the show . Now you are on your ow n. Som e of the scout s you will encount er are goi ng to be not from the inor ganic beings ’ realm but from other, even more dis tant levels of awareness.” “Are the scout s aware of themselves?” I asked. “Most certainly,” he replied."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 111 “Then why don’ t they make cont act with us when we are awake?” “They do. But our great misfortune is to have our cons cious ness so fully enga ged that we d on’ t have time to pay attention. In our sleep, how ever, the two - way - traffic trapdoor ope ns: we dream. And in our dreams, we make contact” “Is there any way to tell whether the scout s are from a level besides the inorganic beings ’ world?” “The greater their sizzling, the farther they com e from . It sounds simplistic, but you have to let you r energy body tell you what is what. I assure you, it’ll make very fine distinctions and une rring judgm ents when faced with alien energy. ” He was right again. Without much ado, my energy body distingui shed two general type s of alien energy. The first was the scout s from the inor ganic beings ’ realm. Their energy fizzled mildly. There was no sound to it, but it had all the ove rt appe arance of effervescence, or of water that is starting to boi l. The energy of the second general type of scout s gave me the impression of cons iderably more pow er. Thos e scout s seemed to be just about to bur n. They vibrated from within as if they were filled with pressurized gas. My encount ers with th e alien energy were always fleeting because I paid total attention to what don Juan recom mende d. He said, “Unless you know exactly what you are doing and what you want out of alien energy, you have to be cont ent with a brief glance. Anyt hing beyond a glanc e is as dange rous and as stupi d as petting a rattlesnake.” “Why is it dange rous , don Juan?” I asked. “Scout s are always very aggr essive and extremely daring, ” he said. “They have to be that way in order to prevail in their expl orations . Sustaining our drea ming attention on them is tantamount to soliciting their awareness to focus on us. Once they focus their attention on us, we are com pelled to go with them. And that, of cour se, is the dange r. We may end up in worlds beyond our energetic pos sibilities.” Don Juan expl ained that there are many more type s of scout s than the two I had classified, but that at my present level of energy I coul d onl y focus on three. He described the first two type s as the easiest to spot . Their disguises in our dreams are so out lan dish, he said, that they immediately attract our dreaming attention. He depicted the scout s of the third type as the most dange rous , in terms of aggressiveness and pow er, and because they hide behind subt le disgui ses. “One of the strange st things dreamers find, which you your self will find presently,” don Juan cont inue d, “is this third type of scout . So far, you have found samples of onl y the first two type s, but that’s because you haven’t look ed in the right place.” “And what is the right place, don Juan?” “You have again fallen prey to words; this time the culprit word is ‘items,’ which you have taken to mean onl y things , obj ects. Well, the most ferocious scout hides behind peopl e in our dreams. A formidable surprise was in store for me, in my dreaming, wh en I focused my gaze on the dream image of my mother. After I voi ced my intent to see, she turned into a ferocious , fright ening bubbl e of sizzling energy. ”"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 112 Don Juan paused to let his statements sink in. I felt stupi d for being disturbed at the pos sibility of finding a scout behind the dream image of my mother. “It’s annoyi ng that they are always associated with the dream images of our parents or close friends ,” he went on. ‘Perhaps that’s why we often feel ill at ease when we dream of them.” His grin gave m e the impression that he was enjoyi ng my turmoil. “A rule of thum b for dreamers is to assum e that the third type of scout is present whenever they feel perturbed by their parents or friends in a dream. Sound advi ce is to avoi d thos e dream images. They are sheer poi son. ” “Where doe s the blue scout stand in relation to the other scout s?” I asked. “Blue energy doe sn’t sizzle,” he replied. “It is like our s; it wavers, but it is blue instead of white. Blue energy doe sn’t exist in a natural state in our world. “A nd this brings us to som ething we’ve never talked about . What color were the scout s you’ ve seen so far?” Until the mom ent he mentione d it, I had never thought about this. I told don Juan that the scout s I had seen were either pink or reddi sh. And he said t hat the deadly scout s of the third type were bright orange . I found out myself that the third type of scout is outright scary. Every time I found one of them, it was behind the dream images of my parents, especially of my mother. Seeing it always reminde d me of the blob of energy that had attacked me in my first deliberate seeing dream. Every time I found it, the alien expl oring energy actually seemed about to jum p on me. My energy body used to react with horror even before I saw it. During our next discuss ion of dreaming, I que ried don Juan about the total absence of inor ganic beings in my dreaming practices. “Why don’ t they show up anym ore?” I asked. “They onl y show themselves at the beginni ng,” he expl ained. “After their scout s take us to their world, the re is no necessity for the inor ganic beings ’ projections . If we want to see the inor ganic beings , a scout takes us there. For no one , and I mean no one , can jour ney by himself to their realm.” “Why is that so, don Juan?” “Their world is sealed. No one can enter or leave without the cons ent of the inorganic beings . The onl y thing you can do by you rself onc e you are inside is, of cour se, voice your intent to stay. To say it out loud means to set in motion currents of energy that are irreversible. In olden tim es, words were incredibly pow erful. Now they are not . In the inor ganic beings ’ realm, they haven’t lost their power.” Don Juan laughe d and said that he had no bus iness saying anyt hing about the inor ganic beings ’ world because I really kne w more about it th an he and all his com panions com bined. “There is one last issue related to that world that we haven’t discussed,” he said. He paused for a long while, as if searching for the appropr iate words. “In the final analysis,” he began, “my aversion to the old sor cerers’ activities is very persona l. As a nagua l, I detest what they did. They cow ardly sought refuge in the inor ganic beings ’ world. They"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 argue d that in a predatorial uni verse, poi sed to rip us apart, the onl y pos sible haven for us is in that realm.” “Why did they believe that?” I asked. “Because it’s true,” he said. “Since the inor ganic beings can’t lie, the sales pitch of the dreaming emissary is all true. That world can give us shelter and prolong our awareness for nearly an eternity.” “The emissary’s s ales pitch, even if it’s the truth, has no appe al to me,” I said. “Do you mean you will chance a road that might rip you apart?” he asked with a not e of bewilderment in his voice. I assured don Juan that I did not want the inorganic beings ’ world no matter what adva ntages it offered. My statement seemed to please him to no end. “You are ready then for one final statement about that world. The most dreadful statement I can make,” he said, and tried to smile but did not qui te make it. Don Juan searched in my eyes, I suppos e for a glimmer of agreement or com prehension. He was silent for a mom ent. “The energy necessary to move the assemblage poi nts of sorcerers com es from the realm of inor ganic beings ,” he said, as if he were hur rying to get it ove r with. My hea rt nearly stoppe d. I felt a vertigo and had to stom p my feet on the ground not to faint. “This is the truth,” don Juan went on, “and the legacy of the old sorcerers to us. They have us pinne d dow n to this day. This is the reason I don ’t like them. I resent having to dip into one sour ce alone . Persona lly, I refuse to do it. And I have tried to steer you away from it. But with no success, because som ething pul ls you to that world, like a magne t.” I unde rstood don Juan better than I coul d have thought . Jour ney ing to that world had always meant to me, at an energetic level, a boos t of dark energy. I had even thought of it in thos e terms, long before don Juan voi ced his statement. “What can we do about it?” I asked. “We can’t have dealings with them,” he answered , “and yet we can’t stay away from them. My solution has been to take their energy but not give in to their influence. This is know n as the ultimate stalking. It is done by sustaining the unbe ndi ng intent of freedom , even though no sorcerer know s what free dom really is.” “Can you expl ain to me, don Juan, why sorcerers have to take energy from the realm of inor ganic beings ?” “There is no other viable energy for sorcerers. In order to maneuve r the assemblage poi nt in the manne r they do, sorcerers need an inor dinate amount of energy. ” I reminde d him of his ow n statement: that a redeploym ent of energy is necessary in order to do dreaming. “That is correct,” he replied. “To start dreaming sorcerers need to redefine their premises and save their energy, but that r edefining is valid only to have the necessary energy to set"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 114 up dreaming. To fly into other realms, to see energy, to forge the energy body, et cetera, et cetera, is anot her matter. For thos e maneuve rs, sorcerers need loads of dark, alien energy. ” “But how do they take it from the inorganic beings ’ world?” “By the mere act of goi ng to that world. All the sorcerers our line have to do this. How ever, none of us is idiotic enough to do what you’ ve done . But this is because none of us has your proclivities.” Don Juan sent me hom e to ponde r what he had revealed to me. I had endl ess que stions , but he did not want to hear any of them. “All the que stions you have, you can answer you rself,” He said as he waved good - bye to me. CHAPTER 10 STALKING THE STALKERS At hom e, I soon realized that it was impos sible for me to answer any of my que stions . In fact, I coul d not even formulate them. Perhaps that was because the bounda ry of the second attention had begun to collapse on me; this was when I met Florinda Grau and Carol Tiggs in the world of everyda y life. The confusion of not know ing them at all yet know ing them so intimately that I woul d have died for them at the drop of a hat was most deleterious to me. I had met Taisha Abelar a few years before, and I was just beginn ing to get used to the conf ounde d feeling of know ing her without having the vague st idea of how . To add two more peopl e to my ove rloaded system prove d too much for me. I got ill out of fatigue and had to seek don Juan’s aid. I went to the tow n in sout hern Mexico where he and his com panions lived. Don Juan and his fellow sorcerers laughe d upr oarious ly at the mere mention of my turmoils. Don Juan expl ained to me that they were not really laughi ng at me but at themselves. My cogni tive probl ems reminde d them of the one s they had had, when the bounda ry of the second attention had collapsed on them, just as it had on me. Their awareness, like mine, had not been prepared for it, he said. “Every sorcerer goe s through the same agony, ” don Juan went on. “Awareness is an endl ess area of expl oration for sorcerers and man in general. In order to enha nce awareness, there is no risk we shoul d not run, no means we shoul d refuse. Bear in mind, how ever, that only in soundne ss of mind can awareness be enha nced.” Don Juan reiter ated, then, that his time was com ing to an end and that I had to use my resour ces wisely to cove r as much. ground as I could before he left. Talk like that used to throw me into states of profound depression. But as the time of his departure appr oached; I had begun to react with more resigna tion. I no longe r felt depressed, but I still panicked."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 115 Nothing else was said after that. The next day, at his reque st, I drove don Juan to Mexico City. We arrived around noon and went directly to the hot el del Prado, in the Paseo Alameda, the place he usually lodge d when he was in the city. Don Juan had an appoi ntment with a lawyer that day, at four in the after noon . Since we had plenty of time, we went to have lunc h in the famous Café Tacuba , a restaurant in the heart of dow ntow n where it was pur por ted that real meals were served. Don Juan was not hungr y. He ordered onl y two sweet tamales, while I gor ged myself on a sum ptuous feast. He laughe d at me and made signs of silent despair at my healthy appe tite. “I’m goi ng to propos e a line of action for you, ” he said in a curt tone when we had finished our lunc h. “It’s the last task of the third gate of dreaming, and it cons ists of stalking the stalkers, a most mysterious maneuve r. To stalk the stalkers means to deliberately d raw energy from the inorganic beings’ realm in order to perform a sorcery feat.’ “What kind of sorcery feat, don Juan?” “A jour ney, a jour ney that uses awareness as an element of the envi ronm ent,” he expl ained. “In the world of daily life, water is an elem ent of the envi ronm ent that we use for traveling. Imagine awareness being a similar element that can be used for traveling. Through the medium of awareness, scout s from all ove r the uni verse com e to us, and vice versa; via awareness, sorcerers go to the en ds of the uni verse.” There had been certain conc epts, among the hos ts of conc epts don Juan had made me aware of in the cour se of his teachings , that attracted my full interest withou t any coaxing. This was one . “The idea that awareness is a phys ical elemen t is revol utiona ry,” I said in awe. “I didn’ t say it’s a phys ical element,” he corrected me. “It’s an energetic element. You have to make that distinction. For sorcerers who see, awareness is a glow . They can hitch their energy body to that glow and go wit h it.” “What’s the difference between a physical and an energetic element?” I asked. “The difference is that phys ical elements are part of our interpretation system, but energetic elements are not . Energetic elements, like awareness, exist in our universe. But we, as average peopl e, perceive onl y the phys ical elements because we were taught to do so. Sorcerers perceive the energetic elements for the same reason: they were taught to do so.” Don Juan expl ained that the use of awareness as an energetic element of our envi ronm ent is the essence of sorcery, that in terms of practicalities, the trajectory of sorcery is, first, to free the existing energy in us by impeccably follow ing the sorcerers’ path; second, to use that energy to develop the energy body by mea ns of dreaming; and, third, to use awareness as an element of the envi ronm ent in order to enter with the energy body and all our phys icality into other worlds. “There are two kinds of energy journeys into other worlds,” he went on. “One is when awareness p icks up the sorcerer’s energy body and takes it wherever it may, and the other is when the sorcerer decides, in full cons cious ness, to use the avenue of awareness to"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 116 make a jour ney. You’ ve done the first kind of jour neying. It takes an enor mous discipline to do the second. After a long silence, don Juan stated that in the life of sorcerers there are issues that requi re masterful handl ing, and that dealing with awareness, as an energetic element ope n to the energy body, is the most impor tant, vital, and dang erous of thos e issues. I had no com ment. I was sudde nly on pins and needles, hangi ng on every one of his words. “By your self, you don’ t have enough energy to perform the last task of the third gate of dreaming, ” he went on, “but you and Carol Tiggs toge the r can certainly do what I have in mind. ” He paused, deliberately eggi ng me on with his silence to ask what he had in mind. I did. His laught er onl y increased the om inous mood. “I want you two to break the bounda ries of the nor mal world and, using awareness as an energetic element, enter into anot her,” he said. “This breaking and entering amount s to stalking the stalkers. Using awareness as an element of the envi ronm ent bypa sses the influence of the inor ganic beings , but it still uses their energy. ” He did n ot want to give me any more information, in order not to influence me, he said. His belief was that the less I kne w beforehand the better off I woul d be. I disagreed, but he assured me that, in a pinch, my energy body was perfectly capable of taking care o f itself. We went from the restaurant to the lawyer’s office. Don Juan qui ckly conc lude d his bus iness, and we were, in no time at all, in a taxi on our way to the airpor t. Don Juan informed me that Carol Tiggs was arriving on a flight from Los Ange les, and that she was com ing to Mexico City exclusively to fulfill this last dreaming task with me. “The valley of Mexico is a supe rb place to perform the kind of sorcery feat you are after,” he com mented. “You haven’t told me yet what the exact steps to follow ar e,” I said. He didn’ t answer me. We did not speak any more, but while we waited for the plane to land, he expl ained the procedur e I had to follow . I had to go to Carol’s room at the Regis Hotel, across the street from our hot el, and, after getting into a s tate of total inne r silence, with her I had to slip gently into dreaming, voi cing our intent to go to the realm of the inor ganic beings . I interrupt ed to remind him that I always had to wait for a scout to show up before I coul d manifest out loud my intent to go to the inor ganic beings ’ world. Don Juan chuc kled and said, “You haven’t dreamt with Carol Tiggs yet. You’ ll find out that it’s a treat. Sorceresses don’ t need any props . They just go to that world whenever they want to; for them, there is a scout o n permanent call.” I coul d not bring myself to believe that a sorceress woul d be able to do what he was asserting. I thought I had a degree of expe rtise in handl ing the inor ganic beings ’ world. When I mentione d to him what was goi ng through my mind, he ret orted that I had no expe rtise whatsoever when it came to what sorceresses are capable of."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 117 “Why do you think I had Carol Tiggs with me to pull you bodi ly out of that world?” he asked. “Do you think it was because she’s beautiful?” “Why was it, don Juan?” “B ecause I coul dn’ t do it myself; and for her, it was not hing. She has a kna ck for that world.” “Is she an exceptiona l case, don Juan?” “Wom en in general have a natural bent for that realm; sorceresses are, of cour se, the champions , but Carol Tiggs is better than anyone I know because she, as the nagua l wom an, has supe rb energy. ” I thought I had caught don Juan in a serious cont radiction. He had told me that the inor ganic beings were not interested at all in wom en. Now he was asserting the oppos ite. “No. I’m not asserting the oppos ite,” he remarked when I conf ront ed him. “I’ve said to you that the inor ganic beings don ’t pursue females; they onl y go after males. But I’ve also said to you that the inorganic beings are female, and that the entire uni verse is fema le to a large degree. So draw your ow n conc lusions .” Since I had no way to draw any conc lusions , Don Juan expl ained to me that sorceresses, in theory, com e and go as they please in that world because of their enha nced awareness and their femaleness. “Do yo u know this for a fact?” I asked. “The wom en of my party have never done that,” he conf essed, “not because they can’t but because I dissuaded them. The wom en of your party, on the other hand, do it like changi ng skirts.” I felt a vacuum in my stom ach. I re ally did not kno w any thing about the wom en of my party. Don Juan cons oled me, saying that my circumstances were different from his, as was my role as a nagua l. He assured me that I did not have it in me to dissuade any of the wom en of my party even if I s tood on my head. As the taxi drove us to her hot el, Carol delighted don Juan and me with her impersona tions of peopl e we kne w. I tried to be serious and que stione d her about our task. She mum bled som e apol ogi es for not being able to answer me with the seri ous ness I deserved. Don Juan laughe d upr oarious ly when she mimicked my solemn tone of voi ce. After registering Carol at the hot el, the three of us meande red around dow ntow n, looki ng for secondha nd books tores. We ate a light dinne r at the Sanbor n’s restaura nt in the Hous e of Tiles. About ten o’clock, we walked to the Regis Hotel. We went directly to the elevator. My fear had sharpened my capacity to perceive details. The hot el bui lding was old and massive. The furniture in the lobby had obvious ly seen better days. Yet there was still, all around us, som ething left of an old glory that had a definite appe al. I coul d easily unde rstand why Carol liked that hot el so much. Before we got into the elevator, my anxi ety mount ed to such height s that I had to ask don Ju an for last - minut e instructions . “Tell me again how we are goi ng to proceed,” I begge d."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118 Don Juan pul led us to the huge , ancient stuffed chairs in the lobby and patiently expl ained to us that, onc e we were in the world of the inor ganic beings , we had to voi ce our intent to transfer our nor mal awareness to our energy bodi es. He sugge sted that Carol and I voi ce our intent toge ther, although that part was not really important What was impor tant, he said, was that each of us intend the transfer of the total awar eness of our daily world to our energy body . “How do we do this transference of awareness?” I asked. “Transferring awareness is pur ely a matter of voicing our intent and having the necessary amount of energy he said. “Carol know s all this. She’s done it be fore. She entered phys ically into the inorganic beings ’ world when she pul led you out of it, remember? Her energy will do the trick. It’ll tip the scales.” “What doe s it mean to tip the scales? I am in limbo, don Juan.” Don Juan expl ained that to tip the s cales meant to add one ’s total phys ical mass to the energy body. He said that using awareness as a medium to make the jour ney into anot her world is not the result of appl ying any techni que s but the corollary of intendi ng and having enough energy. The bul k of energy from Carol Tiggs adde d to mine, or the bulk of my energy adde d to Carol’s, was goi ng to make us into one singl e entity energetically capable of pul ling our phys icality and placing it on the energy body in order to make that jour ney. “What exactly do we have to do in order to enter into that other world?” Carol asked. Her que stion scared me half to death; I thought she kne w what was goi ng on. “Your total phys ical mass has to be adde d to you r energy body, ” don Juan replied, looki ng into her eyes. “T he great difficulty of this maneuve r is to discipline the energy body, a thing the two of you have already done . Lack of discipline is the onl y reason the two of you may fail in performing this feat of ultimate stalking. Som etimes, as a fluke , an average p erson ends up performing it and entering into anot her world. But this is immediately expl ained away as insanity or hallucination. ” I woul d have given anyt hing in the world for don Juan to cont inue talking. But he put us in the elevator, and we went up to t he second floor , to Carol’s room , despite my protests and my rationa l need to know . Deep dow n, how ever, my turmoil was not so much that I needed to know ; the bot tom line was my fear. Som ehow , this sorcerers’ maneuve r was more fright ening to me than anyt hin g I had done so far. Don Juan’s parting words to us were “Forget the self and you will fear not hing.” His grin and the noddi ng of his head were invi tations to ponde r the statement. Carol laughe d and began to clow n,, imitating don Juan’s voi ce as he gave us his crypt ic instructions . Her lisping adde d qui te a bit of color to what don Juan had said. Som etimes I found her lisping ador able. Most of the time, I detested it. Fortuna tely, that night her lisping was hardly not iceable. We went to her room and sat dow n on the edge of the bed. My last cons cious thought was that the bed was a relic from the beginni ng of the century Before I had time to utter a singl e word, I found myself in a strange - looki ng bed. Carol was with me. She half sat up at the same time I did. We were naked, each cove red with a thin blanke t.."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 119 “What’s goi ng on? ” she asked in a feeble voi ce. “Are you awake?” I asked inanely. “Of cour se I am awake,” she said in an impatient tone . “Do you remember where we were?” I asked. There was a long silence, as she obvi ous ly tried to put her though ts in order. “I think I am real, but you are not ,” she finally said. “I know where I was before this. And you want to trick me.” I thought she was doi ng the same thing herself. She kne w what was goi ng on and was test ing me or pulling my leg. Don Juan had told me that her demons and mine were caginess and distrust. I was having a grand sample of that. “I refuse to be part of any shit where you are in control,” she said. She looke d at me with venom in her eyes. “I am ta lking to you , whoe ver you are.” She took one of the blanke ts we had been cove red with and wrappe d herself with it. “I am goi ng to lie here and go back to where I came from ,” she said, with an air of finality. “You and the nagua l go and play with each other .” “You have to stop this nons ense,” I said forcefully. “We are in anot her world.” She didn’ t pay any attention and turned her back to me like an annoye d, pampered child. I did not want to waste my dreaming attention in futile discussions of realness. I be gan to examine my surroundi ngs . The onl y light in the room was moonl ight shining through the window directly in front of us. We were in a small room , on a high bed. I not iced that the bed was primitively cons tructed. Four thick pos ts had been planted in th e ground , and the bed frame was a lattice, made of long pol es attached to the pos ts. The bed had a thick mattress, or rather a com pact mattress. There were no sheets or pillow s. Filled burlap sacks were stacked up against the walls. Two sacks by the foot o f the bed, stagge red one on top of the other, served as a stepladde r to climb ont o it. Looki ng for a light switch, I became aware that the high bed was in a corner, against the wall. Our heads were to the wall; I was on the out side of the bed and Carol on the inside. When I sat on the edge of the bed, I realized that it was perhaps ove r three feet above the ground. Carol sat up sudde nly and said with a heavy lisp, “This is disgus ting! The nagua l certainly didn’ t tell me I was goi ng to end up like this.” “I didn’ t know it either,” I said. I wanted to say more and start a conve rsation, but my anxi ety had grow n to extravagant propor tions . “You shut up, ” she snappe d at me, her voi ce cracking with ange r. “You don ’t exist. You’ re a ghos t. Disappe ar! Disappe ar!” He r lisping was actually cute and distracted me from my obs essive fear. I shook her by the shoul ders. She yelled, not so much in pain as in surprise or annoya nce. “I’m not a ghos t,” I said. “We made the jour ney because we joined our energy.” Carol Tiggs was famous among us for her speed in adapting to any situation. In no time at all she was convi nced of the real ness of our predicament and began to look for her"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 120 clothes in the semidarkne ss. I marveled at the fact that she was not afraid. She became bus y, reas oni ng out loud where she might have put her clothes had she gone to bed in that room . “Do you see any chair?” she asked. I faintly saw a stack of three sacks that might have served as a table or high bench. She got out of the bed, went to it, and found her clothes and mine, neatly folded, the way she always handl ed garments. She hande d my clothes to me; they were my clothes, but not the one s I had been wearing a few minut es before, in Carol’s room at the Regis Hotel. “These are not my clothes,” she lisped. “And yet they are mine. How strange !” We dressed in silence. I wanted to tell her that I was about to bur st with anxi ety. I also wanted to com ment on the speed of our jour ney, but, in the time I had taken to dress, the thought of our jour ney had becom e ver y vague . I coul d hardly remember where we had been before waking up in that room . It was as if I had dreamt the hotel room . I made a supr eme effort to recollect, to pus h away the vague ness that had begun to enve lop me. I succeeded in dispelling the fog, bu t that act exha usted all my energy. I ende d up panting and sweating. “Som ething nearly, nearly got me,” Carol said. I looke d at her. She, like me, was cove red with perspiration. “It nearly got you too. What do you think it is?” “The pos ition of the assembl age poi nt,” I said with absolute certainty She did not agree with me. “It’s the inor ganic beings collecting their due s,” she said shivering. “The nagua l told me it was goi ng to be hor rible, but I never imagined anyt hing this hor rible.” I was in total agree ment with her; we were in a hor rifying mess, yet I coul d not conc eive what the hor ror of that situation was. Carol and I were not novi ces; we had seen and done endl ess things , som e of them outright terrifying. But there was som ething in that dream room tha t chilled me beyond belief. “We are dreaming, aren’t we?” Carol asked. Without hesitation, I reassured her that we were, although I would have given anyt hing to have don Juan there to reassure me of the same thing. “Why am I so fright ened?” she asked me, a s if I were capable of rationa lly expl aining it. Before I coul d formulate a thought about it, she answered her que stion herself. She said that what fright ened her was to realize, at a body level, that perceiving is an all - inclusive act when the assemblage poi nt has been immobi lized on one pos ition. She reminde d me that don Juan had told us that the pow er our daily world has ove r us is a result of the fact that our assemblage poi nt is immobi le on its habitual pos ition. This immobi lity is what makes our perce ption of the world so inclusive and ove rpow ering that we cannot escape from it. Carol also reminde d me about anot her thing the nagua l had said: that if we want to break this totally inclusive force, all we have to do is dispel the fog, that is to say, disp lace the assemblage poi nt by intendi ng its displacement."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 I had never really unde rstood what don Juan meant unt il the mom ent I had to bring my assemblage poi nt to anot her pos ition, in order to dispel that world’s fog, which had begun to swallow me. Carol an d I, without saying anot her word, went to the window and looke d out. We were in the count ry. The moonl ight revealed som e low , dark shapes of dw elling structures. By all indi cations , we were in the utility or suppl y room of a farm or a big count ry hous e. “D o you remember goi ng to bed here?” Carol asked. “I almost do, ” I said and meant it. I told her I had to fight to keep the image of her hot el room in my mind, as a poi nt of reference. “I have to do the same,” she said in a fright ened whisper. “I know that i f we let go of that memory, we are gone rs.” Then she asked me if I wanted us to leave that shack and venture out side. I did not . My appr ehension was so acute that I was una ble to voi ce my words. I coul d onl y give her a signa l with my head. “You are so very right not to want to go out ,” she said. “I have the feeling that if we leave this shack, we’ll never make it back.” I was goi ng to ope n the door and just look out side, but she stoppe d me. “Don’ t do that,” she said. “You might let the out side in.” The thou ght that crossed my mind at that instant was that we had been placed inside a frail cage. Anyt hing, such as ope ning the doo r, might ups et the precarious balance of that cage. At the moment I had that thought , bot h of us had the same urge. We took off our c lothes as if our lives depende d on that. We then jumped into the high bed without using the two sack steps, onl y to jum p dow n from it in the next instant. It was evident that Carol and I had the same realization at the same time. She conf irmed my assum ptio n when she said, “Anyt hing that we use belongi ng to this world can onl y weaken us. If I stand here naked and away from the bed and away from the window , I don’ t have any probl em remembering where I came from . But if I lie in that bed or wear thos e clothes or look out the window , I am done for.” We stood in the center of the room for a long time, huddl ed toge ther. A weird suspicion began to fester in my mind. “How are we going to return to our world?” I asked, expe cting her to know . “The reentry into our wor ld is autom atic if we don ’t let the fog set in,” she said with the air of a foremost author ity which was her trademark. And she was right . Carol and I woke up, at the same time, in the bed of her room in the Regis Hotel. It was so obvi ous we were back in t he world of daily life that we didn’t ask que stions or make com ments about it. The sunl ight was nearly blindi ng. “How did we get back?” Carol asked. “Or rather, when did we get back?” I had no idea what to say or what to think. I was too num b to speculate, which was all I coul d have done ."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 122 “Do you think that we just returned?” Carol insisted. “Or maybe we’ve been asleep here all night . Look ! We’re naked. When did we take our clothes off?” “We took them off in that other world,” I said and surprised myself wi th the sound of my voi ce. My answer seemed to stum p Carol. She looke d uncom prehendi ngl y at me and then at her ow n naked body. We sat there without movi ng for an endl ess time. Both of us seemed to be deprived of vol ition. But then, qui te abrupt ly, we had th e same thought at exactly the same time. We got dressed in record time, ran out of the room , went dow n two flight s of stairs, crossed the street, and rushed into don Juan’s hot el. Inexpl icably and excessively out of breath, since we had not really exerted ourselves phys ically, we took turns expl aining to him what we had done . He conf irmed our conj ectures. “What you two did was about the most dange rous thing one can imagine,” he said. He addr essed Carol and told her that our attempt had been bot h a total suc cess and a fiasco. We had succeeded in transferring our awareness of the daily world to our energy bodi es, thus making the jour ney with all our phys icality but we had failed in avoi ding the influence of the inor ganic beings . He said that ordinarily dreamer s expe rience the whol e maneuve r as a series of slow transitions , and that they have to voi ce their intent to use awareness as an element. In our case, all thos e steps were dispensed with. Because of the intervention of the inorganic beings , the two of us h ad actually been hur led into a deadly world with a most terrifying speed. “It wasn’t your com bined energy that made you r jour ney pos sible,” he cont inue d. “Som ething else did that. It even selected adequa te clothes for you. ” “Do you mean, nagua l, that the c lothes and the bed and the room happe ned onl y because we were being run by the inor ganic beings ?” Carol asked. “You bet your life,” he replied. “Ordinarily, dreamers are merely voye urs. The way your jour ney turned out , you two got a rings ide seat and lived the old sorcerers’ damnation. What happe ned to them was precisely what happe ned to you. The inor ganic beings took them to worlds from which they coul d not return. I shoul d have know n, but it didn’t even enter my mind, that the inor ganic beings woul d take ove r and try to set up the same trap for you two.” “Do you mean they wanted to keep us there?” Carol asked. “If you had got ten out side that shack, you ’d now be meande ring hope lessly in that world,” don Juan said. He expl ained that since we entered into tha t world with all our phys icality, the fixation of our assemblage poi nts on the pos ition preselected by the inor ganic beings was so ove rpow ering that it created a sort of fog that obl iterated any memory of the world we came from . He adde d that the natural c ons eque nce of such an immobi lity, as in the case of the sorcerers of antiqui ty, is that the dreamer’s assemblage poi nt cannot return to its habitual pos ition."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 “Think about this,” he urged us. “Perhaps this is exactly what is happe ning to all of us in the w orld of daily life. We are here, and the fixation of our assemblage poi nt is so ove rpow ering that it has made us forget where we came from , and what our purpos e was for com ing here.” Don Juan did not want to say any more about our jour ney. I felt that he w as sparing us further discom fort and fear. He took us to eat a late lunc h. By the time we reached the restaurant, a coupl e of blocks dow n Francisco Madero Avenue , it was six o’clock in the afternoon. Carol and I had slept, if that is what we did, about eig hteen hour s. Only don Juan was hungr y. Carol remarked with a touc h of ange r that he was eating like a pig. Quite a few heads turned in our direction on hearing don Juan’s laught er. It was a warm night . The sky was clear. There was a soft, caressing breeze as we sat dow n on a bench in the Paseo Alameda. “There is a que stion that’s bur ning me,” Carol said to don Juan. “We didn’ t use awareness as a medium for traveling, right ?” “That’s true,” don Juan said and sighe d deeply. “The task was to sneak by the inorg anic beings , not be run by them.” “What’s goi ng to happe n now ?” she asked. “You are goi ng to pos tpone stalking the stalkers unt il you two are stronge r,” he said. “Or perhaps you’ ll never accom plish it. It doe sn’t really matter; if one thing doe sn’t work, a not her will. Sorcery is an endl ess challenge .” He expl ained to us again, as if he were trying to fix his expl anation in our minds , that in order to use awareness as an element of the envi ronm ent, dreamers first have to make a jour ney to the inor ganic being s’ realm. Then they have to use the jour ney as a springboa rd, and, while they are in pos session of the necessary dark energy they have to intend to be hurled through the medium of awareness into anot her world. “The failure of you r trip was that you didn’t have time to use awareness as an element for traveling, ” he went on. “Before you even got to the inor ganic beings ’ world, you two, were already in anot her world.” “What do you recom mend we do? ” Carol asked. “I recom mend that you see as little of each other as pos sible,” he said. “I’m sure the inor ganic beings will not pass the oppor tuni ty to get you two, especially if you join forces.” So Carol Tiggs and I deliberately stayed away from each other from then on. The prospect that we might inadve rtently elicit a similar jour ney was too great a risk for us. Don Juan encour aged our decision by repeating over and ove r that we had enough com bined energy to tempt the inor ganic beings to lure us again. Don Juan brought my dreaming practices back to seeing energy in e nergy - generating dreamlike states. In the cour se of time, I saw everything that presented itself to me. I entered in this manne r into a most peculiar state: I became incapable of rende ring intelligently what I saw. My sensation was always that I had reache d states of perception for which I had no lexicon."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 Don Juan expl ained my incom prehensible and indescribable visions as my energy body using awareness as an element not for jour neying, because I never had enough energy, but for entering into the energy fiel ds of inanimate matter or of living beings . CHAPTER 11 THE TENANT There were no more dreaming practices for me, as I was accustom ed to having them. The next time I saw don Juan, he put me unde r the gui dance of two wom en of his party: Florinda and Zuleic a, his two closest cohor ts. Their instruction was not at all about the gates of dreaming but about different ways to use the energy body, and it did not last long enough to be influential. They gave me the impression that they were more interested in check ing me out than in teaching me any thing. “There is not hing else I can teach you about dreaming, ” don Juan said when I que stione d him about this state of affairs. “My time on this earth is up. But Florinda will stay. She’s the one who will direct, not onl y you but all my other appr entices.” “Will she cont inue my dreaming practices?” “I don’ t know that, and neither doe s she. It’s all up to the spirit. The real player. We are not players our selves. We are mere pawns in its hands . Follow ing the com mands of the spirit, I have to tell you what the four th gate of dreaming is, although I can’t gui de you anym ore.” “What’s the poi nt of whetting my appe tite? I’d rather not know .” “The spirit is not leaving that up to me or to you . I have to out line the fourth gate of dreaming for you, whether I like it or not .” Don Juan expl ained that, at the four th gate of dreaming, the energy body travels to specific, conc rete places and that there are three ways of using the four th gate: one , to travel to conc rete places in this wor ld; two, to travel to conc rete places out of this world; and, three, to travel to places that exist onl y in the intent of others. He stated that the last one is the most difficult and dange rous of the three and was, by far, the old sorcerers’ predilection. “What do you want me to do with this know ledge ?” I asked. “Nothing for the mom ent. File it away unt il you need it.” “Do you mean that I can cross the four th gate by myself, without help?” “Whether or not you can do that is up to the spirit.” He abrupt ly d roppe d the subj ect, but he did not leave me with the sensation that I shoul d try to reach and cross the four th gate by myself."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 125 Don Juan then made one last appoi ntment with me to give me, he said, a sorcerers’ send - off: the conc ludi ng touc h of my dreaming p ractices. He told me to meet him in the small tow n in sout hern Mexico where he and his sorcerer com panions lived. I arrived there in the late afternoon . Don Juan and I sat in the patio of his hous e on som e unc om fortable wicker chairs fitted with thick, ove rsize pillow s. Don Juan laughe d and winke d at me. The chairs were a gift from one of the wom en members of his party and we simply had to sit as if not hing was bot hering us, especially him. The chairs had been bought for him in Phoe nix, Arizona , and with gr eat difficulty brough t into Mexico. Don Juan asked me to read to him a poe m by Dylan Thom as, which he said had the most pertinent meaning for me at that poi nt in time. I have longe d to move away From the hissing of the spent lie And the old terrors’ cont i nua l cry Grow ing more terrible as the day Goes ove r the hill into the deep sea. I have longe d to move away but am afraid; Som e life, yet uns pent, might expl ode Out of the old lie bur ning on the ground , And, crackling into the air, leave me half - blind. Don Juan stood up and said that he was goi ng for a walk in the plaza, in the center of tow n. He asked me to com e along . I immediately assum ed that the poe m had evoke d a negative respons e in him and he needed to dispel it. We reached the squa re plaza without h aving said a word. We walked around it a coupl e of times, still not talking. There were qui te a num ber of peopl e, milling around the stores on the streets facing the east and nor th sides of the park. All the streets around the plaza were une venly paved. Th e hous es were massive, one - story adobe bui ldings , with tiled roof s, whitewashed wails, and blue or brow n painted door s. On a side street, a block away from the plaza, the high walls of the enor mous coloni al chur ch, which looke d like a Moor ish mosque , loom e d om inous ly ove r the roof of the onl y hot el in tow n. On the sout h side, there were two restaurants, which inexpl icably coexisted side by side, doi ng good bus iness, serving practically the same menu at the same prices. I broke the silence and asked don Juan whether he also found it odd that bot h restaurants were just about the same. “Everything is pos sible in this tow n,” he replied. The way he said it made me feel une asy."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 126 “Why are you so nervous ?” he asked, with a serious expr ession. “Do you know som ething y ou’ re not telling me?” “Why am I nervous ? That’s a laugh. I am always nervous around you, don Juan. Som etimes more so than others.” He seemed to be making a serious effort not to laugh. “Nagua ls are not really the most friendl y beings on earth,” he said in a tone of apol ogy. “I learned this the hard way, being pitted against my teacher, the terrible nagua l Julian. His mere presence used to scare the daylight s out of me. And when he used to zero in on me, I always thought my life wasn’t worth a plug nickel.” “Unque stiona bly, don Juan, you have the same effect on me.” He laughe d ope nly. “No, no. You are definitely exagge rating. I’m an ange l in com parison. ” “You may be an ange l in com parison, except that I don’ t have the nagua l Julian to com pare you with.” He l aughe d for a mom ent, then became serious again. “I don’ t know why, but I definitely feel scared,” I expl ained. “Do you feel you have reason to be scared?” he asked and stoppe d walking to peer at me. His tone of voi ce and his raised eyebrow s gave me the imp ression he suspected that I kne w som ething I was not revealing to him. He was clearly expe cting a disclosure on my part. “Your insistence makes me wonde r,” I said. “Are you sure you are not the one who has som ething up his sleeve?” “I do have som ething up my sleeve,” he adm itted and grinne d. “But that’s not the issue. The issue is that there is som ething in this tow n awaiting you. And you don’ t qui te know what it is or you do know what it is but don ’t dare to tell me, or you don’ t know anyt hing about it at all.” “What’s waiting for me here?” Instead of answering me, don Juan briskly resum ed his walking, and we kept goi ng around the plaza in com plete silence. We circled it qui te a few times, looki ng for a place to sit. Then, a group of young wom en got up from a bench and left. “For years now , I have been describing to you the aberrant practices of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico,” don Juan said as he sat dow n on the bench and gestured for me to sit by him. With the fervor of som eone who has never said it befor e, he began to tell me again what he had told me many times, that thos e sorcerers, guided by extremely selfish interests, put all their efforts into perfecting practices that pus hed them further and further away from sobr iety or mental balance, and that th ey were finally exterminated when their com plex edifices of beliefs and practices became so cum bersom e that they coul d no longe r suppor t them."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 127 “The sorcerers of antiqui ty, of cour se, lived and proliferated in this area,” he said, watching my reaction. “Her e in this tow n. This town was bui lt on the actual founda tions of one of their tow ns. Here in this area, the sorcerers of antiqui ty carried on all their dealings .” “Do you know this for a fact, don Juan?” “I do, and so will you, very soon .” My mount ing anxi ety was forcing me to do som ething I detested: to focus on myself. Don Juan, sensing my frustration, egge d me on. “Very soon, we’ll know whether or not you’ re really like the old sorcerers or like the new one s,” he said. “You are driving me nut s with all t his strange and om inous talk,” I protested. Being with don Juan for thirteen years had condi tione d me, above everything else, to conc eive of panic as som ething that was just aroun d the corner at all times, ready to be released. Don Juan seemed to vacillate . I not iced his furtive glances in the direction of the chur ch. He was even distracted. When I talked to him, he was not listening. I had to repeat my que stion. “Are you waiting for som eone ?” “Yes, I am,” he said. “Most certainly I am. I was just sensing t he surroundi ngs . You caught me in the act of scanni ng the area with my energy body. ” “What did you sense, don Juan?” “My energy body senses that everything is in place. The play is on toni ght . You are the main protagoni st. I am a character actor with a sma ll but meaningf ul role. I exit in the first act.” “What in the world are you talking about ?” He did not answer me. He smiled know ingl y. “I’m preparing the ground ,” he said. “Warming you up, so to speak, harping on the idea that mode rn - day sorcerers have le arned a hard lesson. They have realized that onl y if they remain totally detached can they have the energy to be free. Theirs is a peculiar type of detachm ent, which is bor n not out of fear or indol ence but out of convi ction.” Don Juan paused and stood up, stretched his arms in front of him, to his sides, and then behind him. “Do the same,” he advi sed me. “It relaxes the body, and you have to be very relaxed to face what’s com ing to you toni ght.” He smiled broadly. “Either total detachm ent or utter indul gin g is com ing to you tonight . It is a choi ce that every nagua l in my line has to make.” He sat dow n again and took a deep breath. What he had said seemed to have taken all his energy. “I think I can unde rstand detachm ent and indul ging,” he went on, “because I had the privilege of know ing two nagua ls: my benefactor, the nagua l Julian, and his benefactor, the nagua l Elias. I witnessed the difference between the two. The nagua l Elias was detached to the poi nt that he coul d put aside a gift of pow er. The nagua l J ulian was also detached, but not enough to put aside such a gift.”"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 “Judgi ng by the way you’ re talking,” I said, “I would say that you are goi ng to spring som e sort of test on me tonight . Is that true?” “I don’ t have the pow er to spring tests of any sort on you, but the spirit doe s.” He said this with a grin, then adde d, “I am merely its agent.” “What is the spirit goi ng to do to me, don Juan?” “All I can say is that toni ght you’ re goi ng to get a lesson in dreaming, the way lessons in dreaming used to be, bu t you are not goi ng to get that lesson from me. Som eone else is goi ng to be your teacher and gui de you toni ght .” “Who is goi ng to be my teacher and gui de?” “A visitor, who might be a horrendous surprise to you or no surprise at all.” “And what’s the lesson in dreaming I am goi ng to get?” “It’s a lesson about the four th gate of dreaming. And it is in two parts. The first part I’ll expl ain to you presently. The second part nobo dy can expl ain to you , because it is som ething that pertains onl y to you . All the n agua ls of my line got this two - part lesson, but no two of thos e lessons were alike; they were tailored to fit thos e nagua ls’ persona l bents of character.” “Your expl anation doe sn’t help me at all, don Juan. I am getting more and more nervous .” We remained qui et for a long moment. I was shaken up and fidge ty and did not know what else to say without actually naggi ng. “As you already know , for mode m - day sorcerers to perceive energy directly is a matter of persona l attainm ent,” don Juan said. “We maneuve r the assemblage poi nt through self - discipline. For the old sorcerers, the displacement of the assemblage poi nt was a cons eque nce of their subj uga tion to others, their teachers, who accom plished thos e displacements through dark ope rations and gave them to their disciples as gifts of pow er. “It’s pos sible for som eone with greater energy than our s to do anyt hing to us,” he went on. “For example, the nagua l Julian coul d have turned me into anyt hing he wanted, a fiend or a saint. But he was an impeccable nagua l and l et me be myself. The old sorcerers were not that impeccable, and, by means of their ceaseless efforts to gain cont rol ove r others, they created a situation of darkne ss and terror that was passed on from teacher to disciple.” He stood up and swept his gaze all around us. “As you can see, this tow n isn’t much,” he cont inue d, “but it has a uni que fascination for the warriors of my line. Here lies the sour ce of what we are and the sour ce of what we don’ t want to be. “Since I am at the end of my time, I must pas s on to you certain ideas, recount to you certain stories, put you in touc h with certain beings , right here in this tow n, exactly as my benefactor did with me.” Don Juan said that he was reiterating som ething I already was familiar with, that whatever he w as and everything he kne w were a legacy from his teacher, the nagua l Julian. He in turn inhe rited everything from his teacher, the nagua l Elias. The nagua l"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 129 Elias from the nagua l Rosendo; he from the nagua l Lujan; the nagua l Lujan from the nagua l Santisteba n; and the nagua l Santisteban from the nagua l Sebastian. He told me again, in a very formal tone , som ething he had expl ained to me many times before, that there were eight nagua ls before the nagua l Sebastian, but that they were qui te different. They had a different attitude tow ard sorcery, a different conc ept of it, although they were still directly related to his sorcery lineage. “You must recollect now , and repeat to me, everything I’ve told you about the nagua l Sebastian,” he demande d. His reque st seemed odd to me, but I repeated everything I had been told by him or by any of his com panions about the nagua l Sebastian and the mythical old sorcerer, the death defier, know n to them as the tenant. “You know that the death defier makes us gifts of pow er every generation,” don Juan said. “And the specific nature of thos e gifts of pow er is what change d the cour se of our lineage.” He expl ained that the tenant, being a sorcerer from the old school , had learned from his teachers all the intricacies of shifting his a ssemblage poi nt. Since he had perhaps thous ands of years of strange life and awareness — ample time to perfect anyt hing — he kne w now how to reach and hol d hundr eds, if not thous ands , of pos itions of the assemblage poi nt. His gifts were like bot h maps for shif ting the assemblage poi nt to specific spot s and manua ls on how to immobi lize it on any of thos e pos itions and thus acqui re cohe sion. Don Juan was at the peak of his racont eur’s form. I had never seen him more dramatic. If! had not know n him better, I woul d have sworn that his voi ce had the deep and worried inflection of som eone grippe d by fear or preoccupa tion. His gestures gave me the impression of a good actor portraying nervous ness and conc ern to perfection. Don Juan peered at me, and, in the tone and ma nne r of som e one making a painful revelation, he said that, for instance, the nagua l Lujan received from the tenant a gift of fifty pos itions . He shook his head rhyt hm ically, as if he were silently asking me to cons ider what he had just said. I kept qui et. “Fifty pos itions !” he exclaimed in wonde r. “For a gift, one or, at the most, two pos itions of the assemblage poi nt shoul d be more than adequa te.” He shrugge d his shoul ders, gesturing bewilderment. “I was told that the tenant liked the nagua l Lujan immense ly,” he cont inue d. “They struck up such a close friends hip that they were practically inseparable. I was told that the nagua l Lujan and the tenant used to stroll into the chur ch ove r there every morning for early mass.” “Right here, in this tow n?” I asked, in total surprise. “Right here,” he replied. “Possibly they sat dow n on this very spot , on anot her bench, ove r a hundr ed years ago. ” “The nagua l Lujan and the tenant really walked in this plaza?” I asked again, una ble to ove rcom e my surprise."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 “You bet!” h e exclaimed. “I brought you here tonight because the poe m you were reading to me cued me that it was time for you to meet the tenant.”. Panic ove rtook me with the speed of wildfire. I had to breathe through my mout h for a mom ent. “We have been discussing t he strange accom plishments of the sorcerers of ancient times,” don Juan cont inue d. “But it’s always hard when one has to talk exclusively in idealities, without any firsthand know ledge . I can repeat to you from now unt il doom sday som ething that is crystal clear to me but impos sible for you to unde rstand or believe, because you don’ t have any practical know ledge of it.” He stood up and gazed at me from head to toe. “Let’s go to chur ch,” he said. “The tenant likes the chur ch and its surroundi ngs . I’m pos itive this is the mom ent to go there.” Very few times in the course of my association with don Juan had I felt such appr ehension. I was num b. My entire body trembled when I stood up. My stom ach was tied in knot s, yet I follow ed him without a word when he headed for the chur ch, my kne es wobbl ing and saggi ng invol unt arily every time I took a step. By the time we had walked the shor t block from the plaza to the limestone steps of the chur ch por tico, I was about to faint. Don Juan put his arm around my shoul ders to prop me up. “There’s the tenant,” he said as casually as if he had just spot ted an old friend. I looke d in the direction he was poi nting and saw a group of five wom en and three men at the far end of the por tico. My fast and panicked glance did not register anyt hing unus ual about thos e peopl e. I coul dn’ t even tell whether they were goi ng into the church or com ing out of it. I not iced, though , that they seemed to be cong regated there accidentally. They were not toge ther. By the time don Juan and I reached the small door , cut out in the chur ch’s massive woode n por tals, three wom en had entered the chur ch. The three men and the other two wom en were walking away. I expe rienced a mom ent of confusion and looke d at don Juan for directions . He poi nted with a move ment of his chin to the holy water font . “We must obs erve the rules and cross our selves,” he whispered. “Where’s the tenant?” I asked, also in a whisper. Don Juan dippe d the tips of his finge rs in the basin and made the sign of the cross. With an imperative ges ture of the chin, he urged me to do the same. “Was the tenant one of the three men who left?” I whispered nearly in his ear. “No,” he whispered back. “The tenant is one of the three wom en who stayed. The one in the back row .” At that mom ent, a wom an in the back row turned her head tow ard me, smiled, and nodde d at me. I reached the doo r in one jum p and ran out . Don Juan ran after me. With incredible agility, he ove rtook me and held me by the arm. “Where are you goi ng? ” he asked, his face and body cont orting with laught er."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 He held me firmly by the arm as I took big gul ps of air. I was veritably choki ng. Peals of laught er came out of him, like ocean waves. I forcefully pul led away and walked tow ard the plaza. He follow ed me. “I never imagined you were going to get so ups et,” he said, as new waves of laught er shook his body. “Why didn’ t you tell me that the tenant is a wom an?” “That sorcerer in there is the death defier,” he said solemnly. “For such a sorcerer, so versed in the shifts of the assemblage poi nt, to be a man or a wom an is a matter of choi ce or conve nience. This is the first part of the lesson in dreaming I said you were goi ng to get. And the death defier is the mysterious visitor who’ s goi ng to gui de you through it.” He held his sides as laught er made him cough. I was speechless. Then a sudde n fury pos sessed me. I was not mad at don Juan or myself or anyone in particular. It was a cold fury, which made me feel as if my chest and all my neck muscles were goi ng to expl ode . “Let’s go back to the chur ch,” I shout ed, and I didn’t recogni ze my ow n voi ce. “Now , now ,” he said softly. “You don’ t have to jump into the fire just like that. Think. Deliberate. Measure things up. Cool that mind of your s. Never in your life have you been put to such a test. You need c almness now . “I can’t tell you what to do,” he cont inue d. “I can onl y, like any other nagua l, put you in front of your challenge , after telling you , in qui te oblique terms, everything that is pertinent. This is anot her of the nagua l’s maneuve rs: to say eve rything withou t saying it or to ask withou t asking. ” I wanted to get it ove r with qui ckly. But don Juan said that a mom ent’s pause woul d restore whatever was left of my self - assurance. My kne es were about to give in. Solicitous ly, don Juan made me sit dow n on the curb. He sat next to me. “The first part of the dreaming lesson in que stion is that maleness and femaleness are not final states but are the result of a specific act of positioni ng the assemblage poi nt,” he said. “And this act is, naturally, a mat ter of vol ition and training. Since it was a subj ect close to the old sorcerers’ hearts, they are the onl y one s who can shed light on it.” Perhaps because it was the onl y rationa l thing to do, I began to argue with don Juan. “I can’t accept or believe what you are saying, ” I said. I felt heat rising to my face. “But you saw the wom an,” don Juan retorted. “Do you think that all of this is a trick?” “I don’ t know what to think.” “That being in the chur ch is a real wom an,” he said forcefully. “Why shoul d that be so disturbing to you? The fact that she was bor n a man attests onl y to the pow er of the old sorcerers’ machinations . This shoul dn’ t surprise you. You have already embodi ed all the principles of sorcery.” My insides were about to bur st with tension. In a n accusing tone , don Juan said that I was just being argum entative. With forced patience but real pom pos ity, I expl ained to him the biologi cal founda tion of maleness and femaleness."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 “I unde rstand all that,” he said. “And you ’re right in what you’ re saying. Your flaw is to try to make your assessments uni versal.” “What we’re talking about are basic principles,” I shout ed. “They’ll be pertinent to man here or in any other place in the uni verse.” “True. True,” he said in a qui et voi ce. “Everything you say is t rue as long as our assemblage poi nt remains on its habitual pos ition. But the mom ent it is displaced beyond certain bounda ries and our daily world is no longe r in func tion, none of the principles you cherish has the total value you ’re talking about . “Your mistake is to forget that the death defier has transcende d thos e bounda ries thous ands upon thous ands of times. It doe sn’t take a genius to realize that the tenant is no longe r bound by the same forces that bind you now.” I told him that my qua rrel, if it c oul d be called a quarrel, was not with him but with accepting the practical side of sorcery, which, up to that mom ent, had been so farfetched that it had never pos ed a real probl em to me. I reiterated that, as a dreamer, it was within my expe rience to atte st that in dreaming anyt hing is pos sible. I reminde d him that he himself had spons ored and cultivated this convi ction, toge ther with the ultimate necessity for soundne ss of mind. What he was propos ing as the tenant’s case was not sane. It was a subj ect onl y for dreaming, certainly not for the daily world. I let him know that to me it was an abhor rent and unt enable propos ition. “Why this violent reaction? ” he asked with a smile. His que stion caught me off gua rd. I felt embarrassed. “I think it threatens me a t the core,” I adm itted. And I meant it. To think that the wom an in the chur ch was a man was som ehow nauseating to me. A thought played in my mind: perhaps the tenant is a transvestite. I que ried don Juan, in earnest, about this pos sibility. He laughe d so hard he seemed about to get ill. “That’s too munda ne a pos sibility.” he said. “Maybe your old friends woul d do such a thing. Your new one s are more resour ceful and less masturbatory. I repeat. That being in the chur ch is a wom an. It is a she. And she has a ll the organs and attribut es of a female.” He smiled malicious ly. “You’ ve always been attracted to wom en, haven’t you? It seems that this situation has been tailored just for you .” His mirth was so intense and childlike that it was cont agious . We bot h laug hed. He, with total abandon. I, with total appr ehension. I came to a decision then. I stood up and said out loud that I had no desire to deal with the tenant in any form or shape. My choi ce was to byp ass all this bus iness and go back to don Juan’s hous e an d then hom e. Don Juan said that my decision was perfectly all right with him, and we started back to his hous e. My thought s raced wildly. Am I doi ng the right thing? Am I runni ng away out of fear? Of cour se, I immediately rationa lized my decision as the ri ght and una voi dable one . After all, I assured myself, I was not interested in acqui sitions , and the tenant’s gifts were like acqui ring prope rty. Then doubt and curiosity hit me. There were so many que stions I coul d have asked the death defier."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 My heart beg an to pound so intensely I felt it beating against my stom ach. The poundi ng sudde nly change d into the emissary’s voi ce. It broke its prom ise not to interfere and said that an incredible force was accelerating my heart beat in order to drive me back to the chur ch; to walk tow ard don Juan’s hous e was to walk tow ard my death. I stoppe d walking and hur riedly conf ront ed don Juan with the emissary’s words. “Is this true?” I asked. “I am afraid it is,” he adm itted sheepishly. “Why didn’ t you tell me your self, don Juan? Were you goi ng to let me die because you think I am a cow ard?” I asked in a furious mood. “You were not goi ng to die just like that. Your energy body has endl ess resour ces. And it had never occurred to me to think you’ re a cow ard. I respect your deci sions , and I don’ t give a damn about what motivates them.” “You are at the end of the road, just like me. So be a true nagua l. Don’t be ashamed of what you are. If you were a cow ard, I think you woul d have died of fright years ago. But if you’ re too afraid to meet the death defier, then die rather than face him. There is no shame in that.” “Let’s go back to the chur ch,” I said, as calmly as I coul d. “Now we’re getting to the crux of the matter!” don Juan exclaimed. “But first, let’s go back to the park and sit dow n on a bench and carefully cons ider your opt ions . We can spare the time; besides, it’s too early for the bus iness at hand. ” We walked back to the park and immediately foun d an unoc cupi ed bench and sat dow n. “You have to unde rstand that onl y you , you rself, can make the decision to meet or not to meet the tenant or to accept or reject his gifts of power,” don Juan said. “But your decision has to be voi ced to the wom an in the church, face to face and alone ; otherwise it won’ t be valid.” Don Juan said th at the tenant’s gifts were extraordinary but that the price for them was tremendous . And that he himself did not appr ove of either, the gifts or the price. “Before you make your real decision, ” don Juan continue d, “you have to know all the details of our t ransactions with that sorcerer.” “I’d rather not hear about this anym ore, don Juan,” I pleaded. “It’s your dut y to know ,” he said. “How else are you goi ng to make up your mind? ” “Don’ t you think that the less I know about the tenant the better off I’ll be? ” “No. This is not a matter of hiding unt il the dange r is ove r. This is the mom ent of truth. Everything you ’ve done and expe rienced in the sorcerers’ world has channe led you to this spot . I didn’ t want to say it, because I kne w your energy body was goi ng t o tell you, but there is no way to get out of this appoi ntment. Not even by dyi ng. Do you unde rstand? ” He shook me by the shoul ders. “Do you unde rstand? ” he repeated. I unde rstood so well that I asked him if it woul d be pos sible for him to make me change l evels of awareness in order to alleviate my fear and discom fort. He nearly made me jum p with the expl osion of his no."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 “You must face the death defier in coldne ss and with ultimate premeditation, ” he went on. “And you can’t do this by proxy. ” Don Juan calml y began to repeat everything he had already told me about the death defier. As he talked, I realized that part of my confusion was the result of his use of words. He rende red “death defier” in Spanish as el desafiante de la muerte, and “tenant” as el inqui lino, bot h of which autom atically denot e a male. But in describing the relations hip between the tenant and the nagua ls of his line, don Juan kept on mixing the Spanish - langua ge male and female gende r denot ation, creating a great confusion in me. He said th at the tenant was suppos ed to pay for the energy he took from the nagua ls of our lineage, but that whatever he paid has bound those sorcerers for generations . As paym ent for the energy taken from all thos e nagua ls, the wom an in the church taught them exact ly what to do to displace their assemblage poi nt to som e specific pos itions , which she herself had chos en. In other words, she bound every one of thos e men with a gift of pow er cons isting of a preselected, specific position of the assemblage poi nt and all its implications . “What do you mean by ‘all its implications ,’ don Juan?” “1 mean the negative results of thos e gifts. The woman in the church know s onl y of indul ging. There is no fruga lity, no temperance in that wom an. For instance, she taught the nagua l Julian how to arrange his assemblage poi nt to be, just like her, a wom an. Teaching this to my benefactor, who was an incurable vol upt uary, was like giving booz e to a drunka rd.” “But isn’t it up to each one of us to be respons ible for what we do? ” “Yes, ind eed. How ever, som e of us have more difficulty than others in being respons ible. To augm ent that difficulty deliberately, as that woman doe s, is to put too much unne cessary pressure on us.” “How do you know the wom an in the chur ch doe s this deliberately?” “ She has done it to every one of the nagua ls of my line. If we look at ourselves fairly and squa rely, we have to adm it that the death defier has made us, with his gifts, into a line of very indul ging, depende nt sorcerers.” I coul d not ove rlook his incons ist ency of langua ge usage any longe r, and I com plained to him. “You have to speak about that sorcerer as either a male or a female, but not as bot h,” I said harshly. “I’m too stiff, and your arbitrary use of gende r makes me all the more une asy.” “I am very un easy myself,” he confessed. “But the truth is that the death defier is bot h: male and female. I’ve never been able to take that sorcerer’s change with grace. I was sure you woul d feel the same way, having seen him as a man first.” Don Juan reminde d me of a time, years before, when he took me to meet the death defier and I met a man, a strange Indi an who was not old but not young either and was very slight ly bui lt. I remember mostly his strange accent and his use of one odd metaphor when describing things he allegedly had seen. He said, mis ojos se pasearon, my eyes walked on. For instance, he said, “My eyes walked on the helmets of the Spanish conque rors.”"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135 The event was so fleeting in my mind that I had always thought the meeting had lasted onl y a few minut e s. Don Juan later told me that I had been gone with the death defier for a whol e day. “The reason I was trying to find out from you earlier whether you kne w what was goi ng on, ” don Juan cont inue d, “was because I thought that years ago you had made an appoi ntment with the death defier your self.” “You were giving me undue credit, don Juan. In this instance, I really don’ t know whether I am com ing or goi ng. But what gave you the idea that I kne w?” “The death defier seemed to have taken a liking to you. And tha t meant to me that he might have already given you a gift of pow er, although you didn’t remember it. Or he might have set up you r appoi ntment with him, as a wom an. I even suspected she had given you precise directions .” Don Juan remarked that the death def ier, being definitely a creature of ritual habits, always met the nagua ls of his line first as a man, as it had happe ned with the nagua l Sebastian, and subs eque ntly as a wom an. “Why do you call the death defier’s gifts, gifts of pow er? And why the mystery? ” I asked. “You your self can displace your assemblage poi nt to whatever spot you want, isn’t that so?” “They are called gifts of pow er because they are produc ts of the specialized know ledge of the sorcerers of antiquity,” he said. “The mystery about the gi fts is that no one on this earth, with the exception of the death defier, can give us a sample of that know ledge . And, of cour se, I can displace my assemblage poi nt to whatever spot I want, inside or out side man’s energy shape. But what I can’t do, and onl y the death defier can, is to know what to do with my energy body in each one of thos e spot s in order to get total perception, total cohe sion. ” He expl ained, then, that mode rn - day sorcerers do not know the details of the thous ands upon thous ands of pos sibl e pos itions of the assemblage poi nt. “What do you mean by details?” I asked. “Particular ways of treating the energy body in order to maintain the assemblage poi nt fixed on specific pos itions ,” he replied. He took himself as an example. He said that the de ath defier’s gift of pow er to him had been the pos ition of the assemblage poi nt of a crow and the procedur es to manipul ate his energy body to get the total perception of a crow . Don Juan expl ained that total perception, total cohe sion was what the old sorc erers sought at any cost, and that, in the case of his ow n gift of pow er, total perception came to him by means of a deliberate process he had to learn, step by step, as one learns to work a very com plex machine. Don Juan further expl ained that most of the shifts mode rn - day sorcerers expe rience are mild shifts within a thin bundl e of energetic luminous filaments inside the lum inous egg, a bundl e called the band of man, or the pur ely hum an aspect of the uni verse’s energy. Beyond that band, but still within t he lum inous egg, lies the realm of the grand shifts. When the assemblage poi nt shifts to any spot on that area, perception is still"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 136 com prehensible to us, but extremely detailed procedur es are requi red for perception to be total. “The inor ganic beings trick ed you and Carol Tiggs in your last journey by helping you two to get total cohe sion on a grand shift,” don Juan said. “They displaced your assemblage poi nts to the farthest pos sible spot , then helped you perceive there as if you were in your daily world. A nearly impos sible thing. To do that type of perceiving a sorcerer needs pragm atic know ledge , or influential friends . “Your friends woul d have betrayed you in the end and left you and Carol to fend for your selves and learn pragm atic measures in order to s urvive in that world. You two woul d have ende d filled to the brim with pragm atic procedur es, just like thos e most know ledge able old sorcerers. “Every grand shift has different inne r workings ,” he cont inue d, “which mode rn sorcerers coul d learn if they kne w how to fixate the assemblage poi nt long enough at any grand shift. Only the sorcerers of ancient times had the specific know ledge requi red to do this.” Don Juan went on to say that the know ledge of specific procedur es invol ved in shifts was not available t o the eight nagua ls who preceded the nagua l Sebastian, and that the tenant show ed the nagua l Sebastian how to achieve total perception on ten new pos itions of the assemblage poi nt. The nagua l Santisteban received seven, the nagua l Lujan fifty, the nagua l R osendo six, the nagua l Elias four , the nagual Julian sixteen, and he was show n two; that made a total of ninety - five specific pos itions of the assemblage poi nt that his lineage kne w about . He said that if I asked him whether he cons idered this an adva ntage to his lineage, he woul d have to say no, because the weight of thos e gifts put them closer to the old sorcerers’ mood . “Now it’s your turn to meet the tenant,” he cont inued. “Perhaps the gifts he will give you will offset our total balance and our lineage will plunge into the darkne ss that finished off the old sorcerers.” “This is so hor ribly serious , it’s sickening, ” I said. “I most sincerely sym pathize with you ,” he retorted with a serious expr ession. “I know it’s no cons olation to you if I say that this is the toughe st trial of a mode rn nagua l. To face som e thing so old and mysterious as the tenant is not awe - inspiring but revol ting. At least it was to me, and still is.” “Why do I have to cont inue with it, don Juan?” “Because, without know ing it, you acc epted the death defier’s challenge . I drew an acceptance from you in the cour se of your appr enticeship, in the same manne r my teacher drew one from me, surreptitious ly. “I went through the same horror, onl y a little more brutally than you .” He began to chu ckle. “The nagua l Julian was given to playing horrendous joke s. He told me that there was a very beautiful and passiona te widow who was madly in love with me. The nagua l used to take me to chur ch often, and I had seen the wom an staring at me. I thought she was a good - looki ng wom an. And I was a horny young man. When the nagua l said that she liked me, I fell for it. My awakening was very rude .”"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137 I had to fight not to laugh at don Juan’s gesture of lost innoc ence. Then the idea of his predicament hit me, as bei ng not funny but gha stly. “Are you sure, don Juan, that that wom an is the tenant?” I asked, hopi ng that perhaps it was a mistake or a bad joke . “I am very, very sure,” he said. “Besides, even if I were so dum b as to forget the tenant, my seeing can’t fail me.” “Do you mean, don Juan, that the tenant has a different type of energy? ” “No, not a different type of energy, but certainly different energy features than a nor mal person. ” “Are you absolutely sure, don Juan, that that wom an is the tenant?” I insisted , driven by a strange revul sion and fear. “That wom an is the tenant!” don Juan exclaimed in a voi ce that adm itted no doubt s. We remained qui et. I waited for the next move in the midst of a panic beyond description. “I have already said to you that to be a natural man or a natural wom an is a matter of pos itioni ng the assemblage poi nt,” don Juan said. “By natural I mean som eone who was bor n either male or female. To a seer, the shiniest part of the assemblage poi nt faces out ward, in the case of females and in ward, in the case of males. The tenant’s assemblage poi nt was originally facing inw ard, but he change d it by twisting it around and making his eggl ike energy shape look like a shell that has curled up on itself.” CHAPTER 12 THE WOMAN IN THE CHURCH Don J uan and I sat in silence. I had run out of que stions , and he seemed to have said to me all that was pertinent. It coul d not have been more than seven o’clock, but the plaza was unus ually deserted. It was a warm night . In the evenings in that tow n, peopl e u sually meande red around the plaza until ten or eleven. I took a mom ent to recons ider what was happe ning to me. My time with don Juan was com ing to an end. He and his party were goi ng to fulfill the sorcerers’ dream of leaving this world and entering into i nconc eivable dimensions . On the basis of my limited success in dreaming, I believed that their claims were not illusory but extremely sobe r, although cont rary to reason. They were seeking to perceive the unknow n, and they had made it. Don Juan was right in saying that, by induc ing a systematic displacement of the assemblage poi nt, dreaming liberates perception, enlarging the scope of what can be perceived. For the sorcerers of his party, dreaming had not onl y ope ned the door s of other perceivable worlds but prepared them for entering into thos e realms in full awareness. Dreaming, for them, had be com e ineffable, unpr ecedented, som ething whos e nature and"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138 scope coul d onl y be allude d to, as when don Juan said that it is the gateway to the light and to the darkn ess of the uni verse. There was onl y one thing pendi ng for them: my encount er with the death defier. I regretted that don Juan had not given me not ice so that I coul d prepare myself better. But he was a nagua l who did everything of importance on the spur of the mom ent, without any warning. For a moment, I seemed to be doi ng fine, sitting with don Juan in that park, waiting for things to develop. But then my emotiona l stability suffered a dow nw ard swing and, in the twinkl ing of an eye, I was in the midst of a dark despair. I was assailed by petty cons iderations about my safety, my goa ls, my hop es in the world, my worries. Upon examination, how ever, I had to adm it that perhaps the onl y true worry I had was about my three cohor ts in don Juan’s world. Yet, if I t hought it out , even that was no real worry to me. Don Juan had taught them to be the kind of sorceresses who always kne w what to do, and, most important, he had prepared them always to know what to do with what they kne w. Having had all the pos sible worldl y reasons for feeling angui sh strippe d off me a long time ago, all I had been left with was conc ern for myself. And I gave myself to it shamelessly. One last indul ging for the road: the fear of dyi ng at the hands of the death defier. I became so afraid tha t I got sick to my stomach. I tried to apol ogi ze, but don Juan laughe d. “You’ re not in any way unique at barfing out of fear,” he said. “When I met the death defier, I wet my pants. Believe me.” I waited in silence for a long , unbe arable moment. “Are you r eady? ” he asked. I said yes. And he adde d, standi ng up, “Let’s go then and find out how you are goi ng to stand up in the firing line.” He led the way back to the church. To the best of my ability, all I remember of that walk, to this day, is that he had to drag me bodi ly the whole way. I do not remember arriving at the chur ch or entering it. The next thing I kne w, I was kne eling on a long , worn - out woode n pew next to the wom an I had seen earlier. She was smiling at me. Desperately, I looke d around, trying t o spot don Juan, but he was now here in sight . I woul d have flow n like a bat out of hell had the wom an not restrained me by grabbi ng my arm. “Why shoul d you be so afraid of poor little me?” the wom an asked me in Engl ish. I stayed glued to the spot where I w as kne eling. What had taken me entirely and instantaneous ly was her voi ce. I cannot describe what it was about its raspy sound that called out the most recondi te memories in me. It was as if I had always know n that voice. I remained there immobi le, mesmeri zed by that sound. She asked me som ething else in Engl ish, but I coul d not make out what she was saying. She smiled at me, know ingl y. “It’s all right ,” she whispered in Spanish. She was kne eling to my right . “I unde rstand real fear. I live with it.” I was about to talk to her when I heard the emissary’s voi ce in my ear. “It’s the voi ce of Hermelinda , your wet nurse,” it said.

I expe rienced a mom entary agoni zing anxi ety “I am your wet nurse!” the wom an exclaimed softly. “How extraordinary! Do you want my breast?” Laught er convul sed her body. I made a supr eme effort to remain calm, yet I kne w that I was qui ckly losing ground and in no time at all was goi ng to take leave of my senses. “Don’ t mind my joki ng,” the wom an said in a low voi ce. “The truth is that I like you very much. You are bus tling with energy. An d we are going to get along fine.” Two older men kne lt dow n right in front of us. One of them turned curious ly to look at us. She paid no attention to him and kept on whispering in my ear. “Let me hol d your hand, ” she pleaded. But her plea was like a com ma nd. I surrende red my hand to her, una ble to say no. “Thank you . Thank you for you r conf idence and your trust in me,” she whispered. The sound of her voi ce was driving me mad. Its raspiness was so exot ic, so utterly feminine. Not unde r any circum stances wou ld I have taken it for a man’s voi ce laboring to sound wom anly. It was a raspy voi ce, but not a throaty or harsh - soundi ng one . It was more like the sound of bare feet softly walking on gravel.

I stood up, ready to leave, and I woul d have had not the wom an also stood up and whispered in my ear, “Don’ t run away. There is so much I have to tell you .” I autom atically sat dow n, stoppe d by cur iosity. Strange ly, my anxi ety was sudde nly gone , and so was my fear. I even had enough presence to ask the wom an, “Are you really a wom an?” She chuc kled softly, like a young girl. Then she voiced a convol uted sentence. “If you dare to think that I woul d tr ansform myself into a fearsom e man and cause you harm, you are gravely mistaken,” she said, accentuating even more that strange , mesmeric voi ce. “You are my benefactor. I am your servant, as I have been the servant of all the nagua ls who preceded you. ” Gat hering all the energy I coul d, I spoke my mind to her. “You are welcom e to my energy” I said. “It’s a gift from me to you , but I don’t want any gifts of pow er from you. And I really mean this.” “I can’t take you r energy for free,” she whispered. “I pay for what I get, that’s the deal. It’s fool ish to give your energy for free.” “I’ve been a fool all my life. Believe me,” I said. “I can surely afford to make you a gift. I have no probl em with it. You need the energy, take it. But I don’ t need to be saddl ed w ith unne cessaries.

Aggr essively, I asked her whether she meant that perhaps she woul d take my energy or that she did not believe I had not hing and love d it."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 140 She giggl ed with delight and said tha t she might take my energy since I was so generous ly offering it but that she had to make a paym ent. She had to give me a thing of similar value. As I heard her speak, I became aware that she spoke Spanish with a most extravagant foreign accent. She adde d an extra phone me to the middl e syllable of every word. Never in my life had I heard anyone speak like that. “Your accent is qui te extraordinary,” I said. “Where is it from ?” “From nearly eternity” she said and sighe d. We had begun to conne ct. I unde rstood why she sighe d. She was the closest thing to permanent, while I was tempor ary That was my advantage. The death defier had worked herself into a corner, and I was free. I examined her closely. She seemed to be between thirty - five and forty years old. She wa s a dark, thoroughl y Indi an wom an, almost hus ky, but not fat or even hefty. I coul d see that the skin of her forearms and hands was smoot h, the muscles, firm and yout hful. I judge d that she was five feet, six or seven inches tall. She wore a long dress, a black shawl, and gua raches. In her kne eling pos ition, I coul d also see her smoot h heels and part of her pow erful calves. Her midsection was lean. She had big breasts that she coul d not or perhaps did not want to hide unde r her shawl. Her hair was jet black and tied in a long braid. She was not beautiful, but she was not hom ely either. Her features were in no way out standi ng. I felt that she coul d not pos sibly have attracted anybody’ s attention, except for her eyes, which she kept low , hidde n beneath dow ncas t eyelids. Her eyes were magni ficent, clear, peaceful. Apart from don Juan’s, I had never seen eyes more brilliant, more alive. Her eyes put me com pletely at ease. Eyes like that coul d not be malevol ent. I had a surge of trust and opt imism and the feeling that I had know n her all my life. But I was also very cons cious of som ething else: my emotiona l instability. It had always plague d me in don Juan’s world, forcing me to be like a yo - yo. I had mom ents of total trust and insight onl y to be follow ed by abject doubt s and distrust. This event was not goi ng to be different. My suspicious mind sudde nly came up with the warning thought that I was falling unde r the wom an’s spell. “You learned Spanish late in life, didn’t you? ” I said, just to get out from unde r my t hought s and to avoi d her reading them. “Only yesterday,” she retorted and broke into a crystalline laught er, her small, strange ly white teeth, shining like a row of pearls. Peopl e turned to look at us. I low ered my forehead as if in deep prayer. The wom an move d closer to me. “Is there a place where we coul d talk?” I asked. “We are talking here,” she said. “I have talked here with all the nagua ls of your line. If you whisper, no one will know we are talking.” I was dyi ng to ask her about her age. But a sobe r ing memory came to my rescue.

She sque ezed my arm in a friendl y gesture, as if to say that we had shared a thought . “Instead of giving me a gift, can you tell me som ethin g that woul d help me in my way?” I asked her. She shook her head. “No,” she whispered. “We are extremely different. More different than I believed pos sible.” She got up and slid sideways out of the pew. She deftly genuf lected as she faced the main altar. S he crossed herself and signa led me to follow her to a large side altar to our left. We kne lt in front of a life - size crucifix. Before I had time to say anyt hing, she spoke . “I’ve been alive for a very, very long time,” she said. “The reason I have had this long life is that I cont rol the shifts and move ments of my assemblage poi nt. Also, I don ’t stay here in your world too long. I have to save the energy I get from the nagua ls of you r line.” “What is it like to exist in other worlds?” I asked. “It’s like in your dreaming, except that I have more mobi lity And I can stay longe r anyw here I want. Just like if you woul d stay as long as you wanted in any of your dreams.” “When you are in this world, are you pinne d dow n to this area alone ?” “No. I go everyw here I w ant.” “Do you always go as a wom an?” 7 “I’ve been a wom an longe r than a man. Definitely, I like it much better. I think I’ve nearly forgot ten how to be a man. I am all female!” She took my hand and made me touc h her crotch. My heart was poundi ng in my thro at. She was inde ed a female. “I can’t just take your energy, ” she said, changi ng the subj ect. “We have to strike anot her kind of agreement.” Anot her wave of munda ne reasoni ng hit me then. I wanted to ask her where she lived when she was in this world. I di d not need to voi ce my que stion to get an answer. “You’ re much, much younge r than I,” she said, “and you already have difficulty telling peopl e where you live. And even if you take them to the hous e you ow n or pay rent on, that’s not where you live.” “Ther e are so many things I want to ask you, but all I do is think stupi d thought s,” I said. “You don’ t need to ask me anyt hing,” she went on. “You already know what I know . All you needed was a jolt in order to claim what you already know . I am giving you that jolt.”"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 142 Not onl y did I think stupi d thought s but I was in a state of such sugge stibility that no soone r had she finished saying that I kne w what she kne w than I felt I kne w everything, and I no longe r needed to ask any more que stions . Laughi ngl y, I told he r about my gul libility. “You’ re not gul lible,” she assured me with author ity “You know everything, because you’ re now totally in the second attention. Look around! ” For a moment, I coul d not focus my sight . It was exactly as if water had got ten into my eye s. When I arrange d my view, I kne w that som ething por tentous had happe ned. The chur ch was different, darker, more om inous , and som ehow harder. I stood up and took a coupl e of steps tow ard the nave. What caught my eye were the pews; they were made not out o f lum ber but out of thin, twisted pol es. These were hom emade pews, set inside a magni ficent stone bui lding. Also, the light in the chur ch was different. It was yellow ish, and its dim glow cast the blackest shadow s I had ever seen. It came from the candl es of the many altars. I had an insight about how well candl elight mixed with the massive stone walls and ornaments of a coloni al chur ch. The wom an was staring at me; the bright ness of her eyes was most remarkable. I kne w then that I was dreaming and she was directing the dream. But I was not afraid of her or of the dream. I move d away from the side altar and looke d again at the nave of the chur ch. There were peopl e kne eling in prayer there. Lots of them, strange ly small, dark, hard peopl e. I coul d see their b ow ed heads all the way to the foot of the main altar. The one s who were close to me stared at me, obvi ous ly, in disappr ova l. I was gaping at them and at everything else. I coul d not hear any noi se, though. Peopl e move d, but there was no sound. “I can’t hea r anyt hing, ” I said to the wom an, and my voi ce boom ed, echoi ng as if the chur ch were a hol low shell. Nearly all the heads turned to look at me. The woman pul led. me back into the darkne ss of the side altar. “You will hear if you don’ t listen with your ears ,” she said. “Listen with you r dreaming attention. ” It appe ared that all I needed was her insinua tion. I was sudde nly floode d by the droni ng sound of a multitude in prayer. I was instantly swept up by it. I found it the most exqui site sound I had ever hear d. I wanted to rave about it to the wom an, but she was not by my side. I looke d for her. She had nearly reached the door . She turned there to signa l me to follow her.. I caught up with her at the portico. The streetlight s were gone . The onl y illum ination w as moonl ight . The facade of the chur ch was also different; it was unf inished Squa re blocks of limestone lay everyw here. There were no hous es or bui ldings around the chur ch. In the moonl ight the scene was eerie. “Where are we goi ng? ” I asked her. “Now here,” she replied. “We simply came out here to have more space, more privacy. Here we can talk our little heads off.”"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 143 She urged me to sit dow n on a qua rried, half - chiseled piece of limestone . “The second attention has endl ess treasures to be discove red,” she be gan. “The initial pos ition in which the dreamer places his body is of key importance. And right there is the secret of the ancient sorcerers, who were already ancient in my time. Think about it.” She sat so close to me that I felt the heat of her bod y. She put an arm around my shoul der and pressed me against her bos om . Her body had a most peculiar fragrance; it reminde d me of trees or sage. It was not that she was wearing perfum e; her whol e being seemed to exude that characteristic odor of pine forests. Als o the heat of her body was not like mine or like that of anyone else I kne w. Hers was a cool , menthol ated heat, even, balanced. The thought that came to my mind was that her heat woul d press on relentlessly but kne w no hur ry. She began then to whisper in m y left ear. She said that the gifts she had given to the nagua ls of my line had to do with what the old sorcerers used to call the twin pos itions . That is to say, the initial pos ition in which a dreamer hol ds his phys ical body to begin dreaming is mirrored by the pos ition in which he holds his energy body, in dreams, to fixate his assemblage poi nt on any spot of his choos ing. The two pos itions make a unit, she said, and it took the old sorcerers thous ands of years to find out the perfect relations hip betwee n any two pos itions . She com mented, with a giggl e, that the sorcerers of toda y will never have the time or the dispos ition to do all that work, and. that the men and wom en of my line were inde ed lucky to have her to give them such gifts. Her laught er had a most remarkable, crystalline sound. I had not qui te unde rstood her expl anation of the twin pos itions . Boldly, I told her that I did not want to practice thos e things but only kno w about them as intellectual pos sibilities. “What exactly do you want to know ?” she asked softly. “Expl ain to me what you mean by the twin pos itions, or the initial pos ition in which a dreamer hol ds his body to start dreaming. ” I said. “How do you lie dow n to start your dreaming? ” she asked. “Any which way. I don’ t have a pattern. Don Juan never stressed this poi nt.” “Well, I do stress it,” she said and stood up. She change d pos itions . She sat dow n to my right and whispered in my other ear that, in accordance with what she kne w, the pos ition in which one places the body is of utmost impor tance. She propos ed a way of testing this by performing an extremely delicate but simple exercise. “Start your dreaming by lying on you r right side, with your kne es a bit bent,” she said. “The discipline is to maintain that pos ition and fall asleep i n it. In dreaming, then, the exercise is to dream that you lie dow n in exactly the same pos ition and fall asleep again.” “What doe s that do? ” I asked. “It makes the assemblage poi nt stay put , and I mean really stay put , in whatever pos ition it is at the in stant of that second falling asleep.” “What are the results of this exercise?”"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 144 “Total perception. I am sure you r teachers have already told you that my gifts are gifts of total perception. ” “Yes. But I think I am not clear about what total perception means ,” I lied. She ignor ed me and went on to tell me that the four variations of the exercise were to fall asleep lying on the right side, the left, the back, and the stom ach. Then in dreaming the exercise was to dream of falling asleep a second time in the sa me pos ition as the dreaming had been started. She prom ised me extraordinary results, which she said were not pos sible to foretell. She abrupt ly change d the subj ect and asked me, “What’s the gift you want for your self?” “No gift for me. I’ve told you that a lready.” “I insist. I must offer you a gift, and you must accept it. That is our agreement.” “Our agreement is that we give you energy. So take it from me. This one is on me. My gift to you. ” The wom an seemed dum bfounde d. And I persisted in telling her it was all right with me that she took my energy. I even told her that I liked her immensely. Naturally, I meant it. There was som ething supr emely sad and, at the same time, supr emely appe aling about her. “Let’s go back inside the chur ch,” she muttered. “If y ou really want to make me a gift,” I said, “take me for a stroll in this tow n, in the moonl ight .” She shook her head affirmatively. “Provi ded that you don’ t say a word,” she said. “Why not ?” I asked, but I already kne w the answer. “Because we are dreaming, ” she said. “I’ll be taking you deeper into my dream.” She expl ained that as long as we stayed in the chur ch, I had enough energy to think and conve rse, but that beyond the bounda ries of that church it was a different situation. “Why is that?” I asked dari ngl y. In a most serious tone , which not onl y increased her eeriness but terrified me, the wom an said, “Because there is no out there. This is a dream. You are at the fourth gate of dreaming, dreaming my dream.” She told me that her art was to be capable of projecting her intent, and that everything I saw around me was her intent. She said in a whisper that the chur ch and the tow n were the results of her intent; they did not exist, yet they did. She adde d, looki ng into my eyes, that this is one of the myster ies of intendi ng in the second attention the twin pos itions of dreaming. It can be done , but it cannot be expl ained or com prehende d. She told me then that she came from a line of sorcerers who kne w how to move about in the second attention by projecting th eir intent. Her story was that the sorcerers of her line practiced the art of projecting their thought s in dreaming in order to accom plish the truthful reproduc tion of any obj ect or structure or landm ark or scenery of their choi ce."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 She said that the sorcer ers of her line used to start by gazing at a simple obj ect and memorizing every detail of it. They woul d then close their eyes and visualize the obj ect and correct their visualization against the true obj ect unt il they coul d see it, in its com pleteness, wi th their eyes shut . The next thing in their developi ng scheme was to dream with the obj ect and create in the dream, from the poi nt of view of their ow n perception, a total materialization of the obj ect. This act, the wom an said, was called the first step t o total perception. From a simple obj ect, thos e sorcerers went on to take more and more com plex items. Their final aim was for all of them toge ther to visualize a total world, then dream that world and thus re - create a totally veritable realm where they co uld exist. “When any of the sorcerers of my line were able to do that,” the wom an went on, “they coul d easily pul l anyone into their intent, into their dream. This is what I am doi ng to you now , and what I did to all the nagua ls of you r line.” The wom an gi ggl ed. “You better believe it,” she said, as if I did not . “Whol e popul ations disappe ared dreaming like that. This is the reason I said to you that this church and this tow n are one of the mysteries of intendi ng in the second attention. ” “You say that whol e popul ations disappe ared that way. How was it possible?” I asked. “They visualized and then re - created in dreaming the same scenery,” she replied. “You’ ve never visualized anyt hing, so it’s very dange rous for you to go into my dream.” She warned me, then, that to cross the fourth gate and travel to places that exist onl y in som eone else’s intent was perilous , since every item in such a dream had to be an ultimately persona l item. “Do you still want to go? ” she asked. I said yes. Then she told me more about the twin positions . The essence of her expl anation was that if I were, for instance, dreaming of my hom etow n and my dream had started when I lay dow n on my right side, I could very easily stay in the tow n of my dream if I woul d lie on my right side, in th e dream, and dream that I had fallen asleep. The second dream not onl y woul d necessarily be a dream of my hom etow n, but woul d be the most conc rete dream one can imagine. She was conf ident that in my dreaming training I had got ten count less dreams of great conc reteness, but she assured me that every one of them had to be a fluke . For the onl y way to have absolute cont rol of dreams was to use the techni que of the twin pos itions . “And don’ t ask me why,” she adde d. “It just happe ns. Like everything else.” She m ade me stand up and adm oni shed me again not to talk or stray from her. She took my hand gently, as if I were a child, and headed toward a clum p of dark silhoue ttes of hous es. We were on a cobbl ed street. Hard river rocks had been pounde d edge wise into the dirt. Uneven pressure had created une ven surfaces. It seemed that the cobbl ers had follow ed the cont our s of the ground without bothering to level it. The hous es were big, whitewashed, one - story dus ty bui ldings with tiled roof s. There were peopl e meande ring qui etly. Dark shadow s inside the hous es gave me the feeling of"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 146 curious but fright ened neighbor s gos siping behind door s. I coul d also see the flat mount ains around the tow n. Cont rary to what had happe ned to me all along in my dreaming, my mental processes were uni mpaired. My thought s were not pus hed away by the force of the events in the dream. And my mental calculations told me I was in the dream version of the tow n where don Juan lived, but at a different time. My curiosity was at its peak. I was actually with the death defier in her dream. But was it a dream? She herself had said it was a dream. I wanted to watch everything, to be supe ralert. I wanted to test everything by seeing energy. I felt embarrassed, but the wom an tightened her grip on my hand as i f to signa l me that she agreed with me. Still feeling absurdly bashful, I autom atically stated out loud my intent to see. In my dreaming practices, I had been using all along the phr ase “I want to see energy Som etimes, I had to say it ove r and ove r unt il I got results. This time, in the wom an’s dream tow n, as I began to repeat it in my usual manne r, the wom an began to laugh. Her laught er was like don Juan’s: a deep, abandone d belly laugh. “What’s so funny? ” I asked, som ehow cont aminated by her mirth. “Juan Matus doe sn’t like the old sorcerers in general and me in particular,” the wom an said between fits of laught er. “All we have to do, in order to see in our dreams, is to poi nt with our little finge r at the item we want to see. To make you yell in my dream i s his way to send me his message. You have to adm it that he’s really clever.” She paused for a mom ent, then said in the tone of a revelation, “Of cour se, to yell like an asshol e works too. ” The sorcerers’ sense of hum or bewildered me beyond measure. She la ughe d so hard she seemed to be una ble to proceed with our walk. I felt stupi d. When she calmed dow n and was perfectly poi sed again, she pol itely told me that I coul d poi nt at anyt hing I wanted in her dream, includi ng herself. I poi nted at a hous e with the little finge r of my left hand. There was no energy in that hous e. The hous e was like any other item of a regul ar dream. I poi nted at everything around me with the same result. “Point at me,” she urged me. “You must corrobo rate that this is the method dream ers follow in order to see.” She was thor oughl y right . That was the method . The instant I poi nted my finge r at her, she was a blob of energy A very peculiar blob of energy, I may add. Her energetic shape was exactly as don Juan had described it; it looke d like an enormous seashell, curled inw ardly along a cleavage that ran its lengt h. “I am the only energy - generating being in this dream,” she said. “So the prope r thing for you to do is just watch everything.” At that mom ent I was struck, for the first time, by the immensity of don Juan’s joke . He had actually cont rived to have me learn to yell in my dreaming so that I coul d yell in the privacy of the death defier’s dream. I found that touch so funny that laught er spilled out of me in suffocating waves. “Let’ s cont inue our walk,” the wom an said softly when I had no more laught er in me."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 147 There were onl y two streets that intersected; each had three blocks of hous es. We walked the lengt h of bot h streets, not onc e but four times. I looke d at everything and listened with my dreaming attention for any noi ses. There were very few, onl y dogs barking in the distance, or peopl e speaking in whispers as we went by. The dogs barking brought me an unknow n and profound longi ng. I had to stop walking. I sought relief by leaning my shoul der against a wall. The cont act with the wall was shoc king to me, not because the wall was unus ual but because what I had leaned on was a solid wall, like any other wall I had ever touc hed. I felt it with my free hand. I ran my finge rs on its roug h surface. It was inde ed a wall! Its stunni ng realness put an immediate end to my longi ng and renewed my interest in watching everything. I was looki ng, specifically, for features that coul d be correlated with the tow n of my day. How ever, no matter how int ently I obs erved, I had no success. There was a plaza in that tow n, but it was in front of the chur ch, facing the portico. In the moon light the mount ains around the tow n were clearly visible and almost recogni zable. I tried to orient myself, obs erving the moon and the stars, as if I were in the cons ensual reality of everyda y life. It was a waning moon, perhaps a day after full. It was high ove r the hor izon. It must have been between eight and nine in the evening. I coul d see Orion to the right of the moon; its two main stars, Betelgeuse and Rigel, were on a hor izont al straight line with the moon . I estimated it to be early December. My time was May. In May, Orion is now here in sight at that time. I gazed at the moon as long as I coul d. Nothing shifted. It wa s the moon as far as I coul d tell. The disparity in time got me very excited. As I reexamined the sout hern hor izon, I thought I coul d distingui sh the bell - like peak visible from don Juan’s patio. I tried next to figur e out where his hous e might have been. For one instant I thought I found it. I became so enthralled that I pul led my hand out of the wom an’s grip. Instantly, a tremendous anxi ety pos sessed me. I kne w that I had to go back to the chur ch, because if I did not I woul d simply drop dead on the spot . I turned around and bol ted for the chur ch. The wom an qui ckly grabbe d my hand and follow ed me. As we appr oached the chur ch at a runni ng pace, I became aware that the tow n in that dreaming was behind the church. Had I taken this into cons ideration, orientat ion might have been pos sible. As it was, I had no more dreaming attention. I focused all of it on the architectural and ornamental details on the back of the chur ch. I had never seen that part of the bui lding in the world of everyda y life, and I thought th at if I coul d record its features in my memory, I coul d check them later against the details of the real church. That was the plan I conc octed on the spur of the mom ent. Som ething inside me, how ever, scorned my efforts at validation. During all my apprenti ceship, I had been plague d by the need for obj ectivity, which had forced me to check and recheck everything about don Juan’s world. Yet it was not validation per se that was always at stake but the need to use this drive for obj ectivity as a crutch to give me protection at the moments of most intense cogni tive disrupt ion; when it was time to check what I had validated, I never went through with it. Inside the chur ch, the wom an and I kne lt in front of the small altar on the left side, where we had been, and the next instant, I woke up in the well - illum inated chur ch of my day."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 The wom an crossed herself and stood up. I did the same autom atically. She took my arm and began to walk tow ard the door . “Wait, wait,” I said and was surprised that I coul d talk. I coul d not think clearly, yet I wanted to ask her a convol uted que stion. What I wanted to know was how anyone coul d have the energy to visualize every detail of a whol e tow n. Smiling, the wom an answered my unvoi ced que stion; she said that she was very good at vi sualizing because after a lifetime of doi ng it, she had many, many lifetimes to perfect it. She adde d that the tow n I had visited and the chur ch where we had talked were examples of her recent visualizations . The chur ch was the same chur ch where Sebastian had been a sexton. She had given herself the task of memorizing every detail of every corner of that chur ch and that tow n, for that matter, out of a need to survive. She ende d her talk with a most disturbing afterthought . “Since you know qui te a bit about this tow n, even though you’ ve never tried to visualize it,” she said, “you are now helping me to intend it. I bet you won’ t believe me if I tell you that this tow n you are looki ng at now doe sn’t really exist, out side your intent and mine.” She peered at me and laughe d at my sense of horror, for I had just fully realized what she was saying. “Are we still dreaming? ” I asked, astoni shed. “We are,” she said. “But this dreaming is more real than the other, because you’ re helping me. It is not pos sible to expl ai n it beyond saying that it is happe ning. Like everything else.” She poi nted all around her. “There is no way to tell how it happe ns, but it doe s. Remember always what I’ve told you: this is the mystery of intendi ng in the second attention. ” She gently pul l ed me closer to her. “Let’s stroll to the plaza of this dream,” she said. “But perhaps I shoul d fix myself a little bit so you ’ll be more at ease.” I looke d at her unc om prehendi ngl y as she expe rtly change d her appe arance. She did this with very simple, mun dane maneuve rs. She undi d her long skirt, revealing the very average midcalf skirt she was wearing unde rneath. She then twisted her long braid into a chignon and change d from her gua raches into inch - heel shoe s she had in a small cloth sack. She turned ove r her reversible black shawl to reveal a beige stole. She looke d like a typi cal middl e - class Mexican wom an from the city, perhaps on a visit to that tow n. She took my arm with a wom an’s aplom b and led the way to the plaza. “What happe ned to your tongue ?” sh e said in English. “Did the cat eat it?” I was totally engrossed in the unt hinka ble pos sibility that I was still in a dream; what is more, I was beginni ng to believe that if it were true, I ran the risk of never waking up. In a nonc halant tone that I coul d not recogni ze as mine, I said, “I didn’ t realize until now that you spoke in Engl ish to me before. Where did you learn it?” “In the world out there. I speak many langua ges.” She paused and scrutinized me. “I’ve had plenty of time to learn them. Since we’r e goi ng to spend a lot of time toge ther, I’ll teach you my ow n langua ge som etime.” She giggl ed, no doubt at my look of despair."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 149 I stoppe d walking. “Are we goi ng to spend a lot of time toge ther?” I asked, betraying my feelings . “Of cour se,” she replied in a joyful tone . “You are, and I shoul d say very generous ly, goi ng to give me your energy for free. You said that your self, didn’ t you? ” I was agha st. “What’s the probl em?” the wom an asked, shifting back into Spanish. “Don’ t tell me that you regret you r decis ion. We are sorcerers. It’s too late to change you r mind. You are not afraid, are you? ” I was again more than terrified, but , if I had been put on the spot to describe what terrified me, I woul d not have know n. I was certainly not afraid of being with the death defier in anot her dream or of losing my mind or even my life. Was I afraid of evil? I asked myself. But the though t of evil coul d not withstand examination. As a result of all thos e years on the sorcerers’ path, I kne w without the shadow of a doubt t hat in the uni verse onl y energy exists; evil is merely a conc atenation of the hum an mind, ove rwhelmed by the fixation of the assemblage poi nt on its habitual pos ition. Logi cally, there was really not hing for me to be afraid of. I knew that, but I also kne w that my real weakne ss was to lack the fluidity to fix my assemblage poi nt instantly on any new pos ition to which it was displaced. The cont act with the death defier was displacing my assemblage poi nt at a tremendous rate, and I did not have the prow ess to keep up with the pus h. The end result was a vague pseudo - sensation of fearing that I might not be able to wake up. “There is no probl em,” I said. “Let’s cont inue our dream walk.” She linke d her arm with mine, and we reached the park in silence. It was not at all a forced silence. But my mind was runni ng in circles. How strange , I thought ; onl y a while ago I had walked with don Juan from the park to the chur ch, in the midst of the most terrifying nor mal fear. Now I was walking back from the chur ch to the pa rk with the obj ect of my fear, and I was more terrified than ever, but in a different, more mature, more deadly manne r. To fend off my worries, I began to look around. If this was a dream, as I believed it was, there was a way to prove or disprove it. I po inted my finge r at the hous es, at the church, at the pavement in the street. I poi nted at peopl e. I poi nted at every thing. Daringl y, I even grabbe d a coupl e of peopl e, whom I seemed to scare cons iderably. I felt their mass. They were as real as anyt hing I cons ider real, except that they did not generate energy. Nothing in that tow n generated energy Everything seemed real and nor mal, yet it was a dream. I turned to the wom an, who was hol ding on to my arm, and que stione d her about it. “We are dreaming, ” she said in her raspy voi ce and giggl ed. “But how can peopl e and things around us to be so real, so three - dimensiona l?” “The mystery of intendi ng in the second attention! ” she exclaimed reverently. “Thos e peopl e out there are so real that they even have though ts.”"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 150 That was the last stroke . I did not want to que stion anyt hing else. I wanted to abandon myself to that dream. A cons iderable jolt on my arm brought me back to the mom ent. We had reached the plaza. The wom an had stoppe d walking and was pul ling me to si t dow n on a bench. I kne w I was in troubl e when I did not feel the bench unde rneath me as I sat dow n. I began to spin. I thought I was ascendi ng. I caught a most fleeting glimpse of the park, as if I were looki ng at it from above . “This is it!” I yelled. I thought I was dyi ng. The spinni ng ascension turned into a twirling descent into blackne ss. CHAPTER 13 FLYING ON THE WINGS OF INTENT Make an effort, nagua l,” a wom an’s voi ce urged me. “Don’ t sink. Surface, surface. Use your dreaming techni que s!” My mind began to work. I thought it was the voi ce of an Engl ish speaker, and I also thought that if I were to use dreaming techni que s, I had to find a poi nt of departure to energize myself. “Open your eyes,” the voi ce said. “Open them now. Use the first thing you see as a poi nt of departure.” I made a supr eme effort and ope ned my eyes. I saw trees and blue sky. It was daytime! A blurry face was peering at me. But I coul d not focus my eyes. I thought that it was the wom an in the church looki ng at me. “Use my face,” the voi ce said. It was a familiar voi ce, but I coul d not identify it. “Make my face your hom e base; then look at everything, ” the voi ce went on. My ears were clearing up, and so were my eyes. I gazed at the wom an’s face, then at the trees in the park, at the wrough t - iron bench, at people walking by, and back again at her face. In spite of the fact that her face change d every time I gazed at her, I began to expe rience a minimum of cont rol. When I was more in pos session of my faculties, I realized that a wom an was sitting on the bench, hol ding my head on her lap. And she was not the wom an in the church; she was Carol Tiggs . “What are you doi ng here?” I gasped. My fright and surprise were so intense that I wanted to jum p up and run, but my body was not ruled a t all by my mental awareness. Angui shing mom ents follow ed, in which I tried desperately but uselessly to get up. The world around me was too clear for me to believe I was still dreaming, yet my impaired motor cont rol made me suspect that this was really a dream. Besides, Carol’s presence was too abrupt ; there were no antecedents to justify it."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 151 Cautious ly, I attempted to will myself to get up, as I had done hundr eds of times in dreaming, but not hing happe ned. If I ever needed to be obj ective, this was the ti me. As carefully as I coul d, I began to look at everything within my field of vision with one eye first. I repeated the process with the other eye. I took the cons istency between the images of my two eyes as an indi cation that I was in the cons ensual reali ty of everyda y life. Next, I examined Carol. I not iced at that mom ent that I coul d move my arms. It was onl y my low er body that was veritably paralyzed. I touc hed Carol’s face and hands ; I embraced her. She was solid and, I believed, the real Carol Tiggs . My relief was enor mous , because for a mom ent I’d had the dark suspicion that she was the death defier masque rading as Carol. With utmost care, Carol helped me to sit up on the bench. I had been sprawled on my back, half on the bench and half on the ground. I noticed then som ething totally out of the nor m. I was wearing faded blue Levi’s and worn brow n leather boot s. I also had on a Levi’s jacket and a denim shirt. “Wait a minut e,” I said to Carol. “Look at me! Are these my clothes? Am I myself?” Carol laugh ed and shook me by the shoul ders, the way she always did to denot e camaraderie, manliness, that she was one of the boys. “I’m looki ng at you r beautiful self,” she said in her funny forced falsetto. “Oh massa, who else coul d it pos sibly be?” “How in the hel l can I be wearing Levi’s and boot s?” I insisted. “I don’ t ow n any.” “Thos e are my clothes you are wearing. I found you naked!” “Where? When?” “Around the chur ch, about an hour ago. I came to the plaza here to look for you . The nagua l sent me to see if I c oul d find you . I brought the clothes, just in case.” I told her that I felt terribly vul nerable and embarrassed to have wande red around without my clothes. “Strange ly enough, there was no one around, ” she assured me, but I felt she was saying it just to ea se my discom fort. Her playful smile told me so. “I must have been with the death defier all last night, maybe even longe r,” I said. “What day is it toda y?” “Don’ t worry about dates,” she said, laughi ng. “When you are more centered, you’ ll count the days yo urself.” “Don’ t hum or me, Carol Tiggs . What day is it toda y?” My voi ce was a gruff, no - nons ense voi ce that did not seem to belong to me. “It’s the day after the big fiesta,” she said and slapped me gently on my shoul der. “We all have been looki ng for you s ince last night .” “But what am I doi ng here?” “I took you to the hot el across the plaza. I coul dn’ t carry you all the way to the nagua l’s hous e; you ran out of the room a few minut es ago, and we ende d up here.”"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 152 “Why didn’ t you ask the nagua l for help?” “Be cause this is an affair that conc erns onl y you and me. We must solve it toge ther.” That shut me up. She made perfect sense to me. I asked her one more naggi ng que stion. “What did I say when you found me?” “You said that you had been so deeply into the seco nd attention and for such a long time that you were not qui te rationa l yet. All you wanted to do was to fall asleep.” “When did I lose my motor cont rol?” “Only a mom ent ago. You’ ll get it back. You you rself know that it is qui te nor mal, when you enter into the second attention and receive a cons iderable energy jolt, to lose cont rol of your speech or of your limbs.” “And when did you lose your lisping, Carol?” I caught her totally by surprise. She peered at me and broke into a hearty laugh. “I’ve been workin g on it for a long time,” she conf essed. “I think that it’s terribly annoyi ng to hear a grow n wom an lisping. Besides, you hate it.” Adm itting that I detested her lisping was not difficult. Don Juan and I had tried to cure her, but we had conc lude d she was not interested in getting cured. Her lisping made her extremely cute to everyone , and don Juan’s feelings were that she love d it and was not goi ng to give it up. Hearing her speak without lisping was tremendous ly rewarding and exciting to me. It prove d to me that she was capable of radical change s on her ow n, a thing neither don Juan nor I was ever sure about . “What else did the nagua l say to you when he sent you to look for me?” I asked. “He said you were having a bout with the death defier.” In a conf iden tial tone , I revealed to Carol that the death defier was a wom an. Nonc halantly, she said that she kne w it. “How can you know it?” I shout ed. “No one has ever know n this, apart from don Juan. Did he tell you that himself?” “Of cour se he did,” she replied, u npe rturbed by my shout ing. “What you have ove rlooke d is that I also met the woman in the chur ch. I met her before you did. We amiably chatted in the chur ch for qui te a while.” I believed Carol was telling me the truth. What she was describing was very much what don Juan woul d do. He woul d in all likelihood send Carol as a scout in order to draw conc lusions . “When did you see the death defier?” I asked. “A coupl e of weeks ago, ” she replied in a matter - of - fact tone . “It was no great event for me. I had no ene rgy to give her, or at least not the energy that wom an wants.” “Why did you see her then? Is dealing with the nagua l wom an also part of the death defier’s and sorcerers’ agreement?” “I saw her because the nagua l said that you and I are interchange able, and for no other reason. Our energy bodi es have merged many times. Don’ t you remember? The wom an"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 153 and I talked about the ease with which we merge. I stayed with her maybe three or four hour s, unt il the nagua l came in and got me out.” “Did you stay in the chur ch all that time?” I asked, because I coul d hardly believe that they had kne lt in there for three or four hou rs onl y talking about the merging of our energy bodi es. “She took me into anot her facet of her intent,” Carol conc eded after a mom ent’s thought . “S he made me see how she actually escaped her captors.” Carol related then a most intrigui ng story. She said that according to what the wom an in the chur ch had made her see, every sorcerer of antiqui ty fell, inescapably, prey to the inor ganic beings . The ino rganic beings , after capturing them, gave them pow er to be the intermediaries between our world and their realm, which peopl e called the netherworld. The death defier was una voi dably caught in the nets of the inorganic beings . Carol estimated that he spent perhaps thous ands of years as a captive, unt il the mom ent he was capable of transforming himself into a wom an. He had clearly seen this as his way out of that world the day he found out that the inor ganic beings regard the female principle as imperishable . They believe that the female principle has such a pliability and its scope is so vast that its members are impervious to traps and setups and can hardly be held captive. The death defier’s transformation was so com plete and so detailed that she was insta ntly spewed out of the inor ganic beings ’ realm. “Did she tell you that the inorganic beings are still after her?” I asked. “Naturally they are after her,” Carol assured me. “The wom an told me she has to fend off her pur suers every moment of her life.” “Wha t can they do to her?” “Realize she was a man and pul l her back to captivity, I suppos e. I think she fears them more than you can think it’s pos sible to fear anyt hing. ” Nonc halantly, Carol told me that the wom an in the chur ch was thor oughl y aware of my run - in with the inorganic beings and that she also knew about the blue scout . “She know s everything about you and me,” Carol cont inue d. “And not because I told her anyt hing, but because she is part of our lives and our lineage. She mentione d that she had alwa ys follow ed all of us, you and me in particular.” Carol related to me the instances that the wom an knew in which Carol and I had acted toge ther. As she spoke , I began to expe rience a uni que nos talgia for the very person who was in front of me: Carol Tiggs . I wished desperately to embrace her. I reached out to her, but I lost my balance and fell off the bench. Carol helped me up from the pavement and anxi ously examined my legs and the pupi ls of my eyes, my neck and my low er back. She said that I was still su ffering from an energetic jolt. She proppe d my head on her bos om and caressed me as if I were a malinge ring child she was hum oring. After a while I did feel better; I even began to regain my motor cont rol."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 154 “How do you like the clothes I am wearing? ” Carol asked me all of a sudde n. “Am I ove rdressed for the occasion? Do I look all right to you? ” Carol was always exqui sitely dressed. If there was anyt hing certain about her, it was her impeccable taste in clothes. In fact, as long as I had know n her, it had be en a runni ng joke between don Juan and the rest of us that her only virtue was her expe rtise at buyi ng beautiful clothes and wearing them with grace and style. I found her que stion very odd and made a com ment. “Why woul d you be insecure about your appe aran ce? It has never bot hered you before. Are you trying to impress som eone ?” “I’m trying to impress you, of cour se,” she said. “But this is not the time,” I protested. “What’s goi ng on with the death defier is the impor tant matter, not your appe arance.” “You’ d be surprised how impor tant my appe arance is.” She laughe d. “My appe arance is a matter of life or death for bot h of us.” “What are you talking about ? You remind me of the nagua l setting up my meeting with the death defier. He nearly drove me nut s with his mysterious talk.” “Was his mysterious talk justified?” Carol asked with a deadly serious expr ession. “It most certainly was,” I adm itted. “So is my appe arance. Hum or me. How do you find me? Appe aling, una ppe aling, attractive, average, disgus ting, ove rpow e ring, bos sy?” I thought for a mom ent and made my assessment. I found Carol very appe aling. This was qui te strange to me. I had never cons cious ly thought about her appe al. “I find you divinely beautiful,” I said. “In fact, you’ re dow nright stunni ng. ” “Then this must be the right appe arance.” She sighe d. I was trying to figur e out her meanings , when she spoke again. She asked, “What was your time with the death defier like?” I succinctly told her about my expe rience, mainly about the first dream. I said that I believed the death defier had made me see that tow n, but at anot her time in the past. “But that’s not pos sible,” she blurted out . “There is no past or future in the uni verse. There is onl y the mom ent.” “I know that it was the past,” I said. “It was the s ame chur ch, but a different tow n.” “Think for a moment,” she insisted. “In the uni verse there is onl y energy, and energy has onl y a here and now , an endl ess and ever - present here and now .” “So what do you think happe ned to me, Carol?” “With the death defie r’s help, you crossed the four th gate of dreaming, ” she said. “The wom an in the church took you into her dream, into her intent. She took you into her visualization of this tow n. Obvi ous ly, she visualized it in the past, and that visualization is still int act in her. As her present visualization of this tow n must be there too.”"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 155 After a long silence she asked me anot her que stion. “What else did the wom an do with you? ” I told Carol about the second dream. The dream of the tow n as it stands toda y. “There you a re,” she said. “Not onl y did the wom an take you into her past intent but she further helped you cross the four th gate by making your energy body journey to anot her place that exists toda y, onl y in her intent.” Carol paused and asked me whether the wom an in the chur ch had expl ained to me what intendi ng in the second attention meant. I did remember her mentioni ng but not really expl aining what it meant to intend in the second attention. Carol was dealing with conc epts don Juan had never spoke n about . “Where d id you get all these nove l ideas?” I asked, truly marveling at how lucid she was. In a nonc om mittal tone , Carol assured me that the wom an in the church had expl ained to her a great deal about thos e intricacies. “We are intendi ng in the second attention now ,” she cont inue d. “The wom an in the chur ch made us fall asleep; you here, and I in Tucson. And then we fell asleep again in our dream. But you don’ t remember that part, while I do. The secret of the twin pos itions . Remember what the wom an told you; the sec ond dream is intendi ng in the second attention: the onl y way to cross the four th gate of dreaming. ” After a long pause, dur ing which I coul d not articulate one word, she said, “I think the wom an in the church really made you a gift, althou gh you didn’ t wan t to receive one . Her gift was to add her energy to our s in order to move backw ard and forward on the here - and - now energy of the uni verse.” I got extremely excited. Carol’s words were precise, apropos . She had defined for me som ething I cons idered unde fina ble, although I did not know what it was that she had defined. If I coul d have move d, I woul d have leapt to hug her. She smiled beatifically as I kept on ranting nervous ly about the sense her words made to me. I com mented rhetorically that don Juan had nev er told me anyt hing similar. “Maybe he doe sn’t know ,” Carol said, not offensively but conc iliatorily. I did not argue with her. I remained qui et for a while, strange ly voi d of thought s. Then my thought s and words erupt ed out of me like a volcano. Peopl e we nt around the plaza, staring at us every so often or stoppi ng in front of us to watch us. And we must have been a sight : Carol Tiggs kissing and caressing my face while I ranted on and on about her lucidity and my encount er with the death defier. When I wa s able to walk, she gui ded me across the plaza to the onl y hot el in tow n. She assured me that I did not yet have the energy to go to don Juan’s hous e but that everybody there kne w our whereabout s. “How woul d they know our whereabout s?” I asked. “The nagua l is a very crafty old sorcerer,” she replied, laughi ng. “He’s the one who told me that if I found you energetically mangl ed, I should put you in the hot el rather than risk crossing the tow n with you in tow .”"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 156 Her words and especially her smile made me feel so relieved that I kept on walking in a state of bliss. We went around the corner to the hotel’s entrance, half a block dow n the street, right in front of the chur ch. We went throug h the bleak lobby , up the cement stairway to the second floor, directly to an unfriendly room I had never seen before. Carol said that I had been there; how ever, I had no recollection of the hot el or the room . I was so tired, though, that I coul d not think about it. I just sank into the bed, face dow n. All I wanted to do was slee p, yet I was too keyed up. There were too many loos e ends , although everything seemed so orderly. I had a sudden surge of nervous excitation and sat up. “I never told you that I hadn’ t accepted the death defier’s gift,” I said, facing Carol. “How did you k now I didn’ t?” “Oh, but you told me that your self,” she protested as she sat dow n next to me. “You were so proud of it. That was the first thing you blurted out when I found you. ” This was the onl y answer, so far, that did not qui te satisfy me. What she wa s repor ting did not sound like my statement. “I think you read me wrong ,” I said. “I just didn’t want to get anyt hing that woul d deviate me from my goa l.” “Do you mean you didn’ t feel proud of refusing? ” “No. I didn’ t feel anyt hing. I am no longe r capable of feeling anyt hing, except fear.” I stretched my legs and put my head on the pillow . I felt that if I closed my eyes or did not keep on talking I woul d be asleep in an instant. I told Carol how I had argue d with don Juan, at the beginni ng of my associatio n with him, about his conf essed motive for staying on the warrior’s path. He had said that fear kept him goi ng in a straight line, and that what he feared the most was to lose the nagua l, the abstract, the spirit. “Com pared with losing the nagua l, death is not hing,” he had said with a not e of true passion in his voi ce. “My fear of losing the nagua l is the onl y real thing I have, because without it I woul d be worse than dead.” I said to Carol that I had immediately cont radicted don Juan and bragge d that sinc e I was impervious to fear, if I had to stay within the confines of one path, the moving force for me had to be love . Don Juan had retorted that when the real pull com es, fear is the onl y worthw hile condi tion for a warrior. I secretly resented him for what I thought was his cove rt narrow - minde dne ss. “The wheel has done a full turn,” I said to Carol, “and look at me now . I can swear to you that the onl y thing that keeps me goi ng is the fear of losing the nagua l.” Carol stared at me with a strange look I had never seen in her. “I dare to disagree,” she said softly. “Fear is not hing com pared with affection. Fear makes you run wildly; love makes you move intelligently.” “What are you saying, Carol Tiggs ? Are sorcerers peopl e in love now ?”"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 157 She did not answer. She lay next to me and put her head on my shoul der. We stayed there, in that strange , unf riendl y room, for a long time, in total silence. “I feel what you feel,” Carol said abruptly. “Now , try to feel what I feel. You can do it. But let’s do it in the dark.” Carol stretched her arm up and turned off the light above the bed. I sat up straight in one singl e motion. A jolt of fright had gone through me like electricity. As soon as Carol turned off the light , it was night time inside that room. In the middl e of gre at agitation, I asked Carol about it. “You’ re not all toge ther yet,” she said reassuringl y. “You had a bout of monu mental propor tions . Going so deeply into the second attention has left you a little mangl ed, so to speak. Of cour se, it’s daytime, but your e yes can’t yet adjust prope rly to the dim light inside this room .” More or less convi nced, I lay dow n again. Carol kept on talking, but I was not listening. I felt the sheets. They were real sheets. I ran my hands on the bed. It was a bed! I leaned ove r and ran the palms of my hands on the cold tiles of the floor . I got out of bed and checked every item in the room and in the bathroom. Everything was perfectly nor mal, perfectly real. I told Carol that when she turned off the light , I had the clear sensation I was dreaming. “Give your self a break,” she said. “Cut this inve stigatory nons ense and com e to bed and rest.” I ope ned the curtains of the window to the street. It was day time out side, but the mom ent I closed them it was night time inside. Carol begge d me to com e back to bed. She feared that I might run away and end up in the street, as I had done before. She made sense. I went back to bed without not icing that not even for a second had it entered my mind to poi nt at things . It was as if that know ledge had been erased from my memory The darkne ss in that hot el room was most extraordinary. It brought me a delicious sense of peace and harmony . It brought me also a profound sadne ss, a longi ng for hum an warmth, for com panions hip. I felt more than bewildered. Nev er had any thing like this happe ned to me. I lay in bed, trying to remember if that longi ng was som ething I kne w. It was not . The longi ngs I kne w were not for hum an com panions hip; they were abstract; they were rather a sort of sadne ss for not reaching som e thing unde fined. “I am com ing apart,” I said to Carol. “I am about to weep for peopl e.” I thought she woul d unde rstand my statement as being funny. I intende d it as a joke . But she did not say anyt hing; she seemed to agree with me. She sighe d. Being in an uns table state of mind, I became instantly swayed tow ard emotiona lity. I faced her in the darkne ss and muttered som ething that in a more lucid mom ent woul d have been quite irrationa l to me. “I absolutely ador e you ,” I said Talk like that among the sorcerer s of don Juan’s line was unt hinka ble. Carol Tiggs was the nagua l wom an. Between the two of us, there was no need for demons trations of affection. In fact, we did not even know what we felt for each other. We had been taught by don Juan that among sorcerers there was no need or time for such feelings ."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 158 Carol smiled at me and embraced me. And I was filled with such a cons um ing affection for her that I began to weep invol unt arily. “Your energy body is movi ng forward on the uni verse’s lum inous filaments of energ y” she whispered in my ear. “We are being carried by the death defier’s gift of intent.” I had enough energy to unde rstand what she was saying. I even que stione d her about whether she, herself, unde rstood what it all meant. She hus hed me and whispered in m y ear. “I do unde rstand; the death defier’s gift to you was the wings of intent. And with them, you and I are dreaming our selves in anot her time. In a time yet to com e.” I pus hed her away and sat up. The way Carol was voi cing thos e com plex sorcerers’ thoug hts was uns ettling to me. She was not given to take conc eptual thinki ng serious ly. We had always joke d among our selves that she did not have a phi losophe r’s mind. “What’s the matter with you? ” I asked. “Your s is a new developm ent for me: Carol the sorceres s - phi losophe r. You are talking like don Juan.” “Not yet.” She laughe d. “But it’s com ing. It’s rolling, and when it finally hits me, it’ll be the easiest thing in the world for me to be a sorceress - phi losophe r. You’ ll see. And no one will be able to expl ain it because it will just happe n.” An alarm bell rang in my mind. “You’ re not Carol!” I shout ed. “You’ re the death defier masque rading as Carol. I kne w it.” Carol laughe d, undi sturbed by my accusation. “Don’ t be absurd,” she said. “You’ re goi ng to miss the lesson. I kne w that, soone r or later, you were goi ng to give in to your indul ging. Believe me, I am Carol. But we’re doi ng som ething we’ve never done : we are intendi ng in the second attention, as the sorcerers of antiqui ty used to do.” I was not convi nced, but I had no more energy to pursue my argum ent, for som ething like the great vor texes of my dreaming was beginni ng to pul l me in. I heard Carol’s voice faintly, saying in my ear, “We are dreaming our selves. Dream your intent of me. Intend me forward! Inte nd me forward!” With great effort, I voi ced my inne rmost though t. “Stay here with me forever,” I said with the slow ness of a tape recorder on the blink. She responde d with som ething incom prehensible. I wanted to laugh at my voi ce, but then the vortex swall ow ed me. When I woke up, I was alone in the hot el room . I had no idea how long I had slept. I felt extremely disappoi nted at not findi ng Carol by my side. I hur riedly dressed and went dow n to the lobby to look for her. Besides, I wanted to shake off som e s trange sleepiness that had clung to me. At the desk, the manager told me that the American wom an who had rented the room had just left a mom ent ago. I ran out to the street, hopi ng to catch her, but there was no sign of her. It was midda y; the sun was shin ing in a cloudl ess sky. It was a bit warm. I walked to the chur ch. My surprise was genui ne but dul l at findi ng out that I had inde ed seen the detail of its architectural structure in that dream.

From there I slow ly walk ed to don Juan’s hous e, still looki ng for Carol. I was sure I was goi ng to find her there, waiting for me. Don Juan received me as if I had com e back from the dead. He and his com panions were in the throes of agitation as they examined me with undi sgui sed curiosity “Where have you been?” don Juan demande d. I coul d not com prehend the reason for all the fuss. I told him that I had spent the night with Carol in the hot el by the plaza, because I had no energy to walk back from the chur ch to their hous e, but tha t they already kne w this. “We kne w not hing of the sort,” he snappe d. “Didn’ t Carol tell you she was with me?” I asked in the midst of a dull suspicion, which, if I had not been so exha usted, woul d have been alarming. No one answered. They looke d at one ano ther, searchingl y. I faced don Juan and told him I was unde r the impression he had sent Carol to find me. Don Juan paced the room up and dow n without saying a word. “Carol Tiggs hasn’t been with us at all,” he said. “And you’ ve been gone for nine days.” My fatigue prevented me from being blasted by those statements. His tone of voi ce and the conc ern the others show ed were ample proof that they were serious . But I was so num b that there was not hing for me to say. Don Juan asked me to tell them, in all pos sib le detail, what had transpired between the death defier and me. I was shoc ked at being able to remember so much, and at being able to conve y all of it in spite of my fatigue . A mom ent of levity broke the tension when I told them how hard the wom an had laug hed at my inane yelling in her dream, my intent to see. “Pointing the little finge r works better,” I said to don Juan, but without any feeling of recrimination. Don Juan asked if the wom an had any other reaction to my yelling besides laughi ng. I had no mem ory of one , except her mirth and the fact that she had com mented how intensely he disliked her. “I don’ t dislike her,” don Juan protested. “I just don’t like the old sorcerers’ coerciveness.” Addr essing everybody, I said that I persona lly had liked that wo man immensely and unbi asedly. And that I had love d Carol Tiggs as I never thought I coul d love anyone . They did not seem to appreciate what I was saying. They looke d at one anot her as if I had sudde nly gone crazy.

He even called the hot el maids; they corrobo rated his statements. “What can the meaning of all this be?” don Juan asked out loud . It seemed to be a que stion addr essed to himself. He gently ushered me out of the hot el. “Let’s get out of this conf ounde d place,” he said. When we were out side, he ordered me not to turn around to look at the hot el or at the chur ch across the street, but to keep my head dow n. I looke d at my shoe s and instantly realized I was no longe r wearing Carol’s clothe s but my ow n. I coul d not remember, how ever, no matter how hard I tried, when I had change d clothes. I figur ed that it must have been when I woke up in the hot el room . I must have put on my ow n clothes then, although my memory was blank. By then we had, re ached the plaza. Before we crossed it to head off to don Juan’s hous e, I expl ained to him about my clothes. He shook his head rhyt hm ically, listening to every word. Then he sat dow n on a bench, and, in a voi ce that conve yed genui ne conc ern, he warned me th at, at the mom ent, I had no way of know ing what had transpired in the second attention between the wom an in the chur ch and my energy body. My interaction with the Carol Tiggs of the hot el had been just the tip of the iceberg. “It’s hor rendous to think that you were in the second attention for nine days,” don Juan went on. “Nine days is just a second for the death defier, but an eternity for us.” Before I coul d protest or expl ain or say anyt hing, he stoppe d me with a com ment. “Cons ider this,” he said. “If yo u still can’t remember all the things I taught you and did with you in the second attention, imagine how much more difficult it must be to remember what the death defier taught you and did with you. I onl y made you change levels of awareness; the death def ier made you change uni verses.” I felt meek and defeated. Don Juan and his two companions urged me to make a titanic effort and try to remember when I change d my clothes. I coul d not . There was not hing in my mind: no feelings , no memories. Som ehow , I was n ot totally there with them. The nervous agitation of don Juan and his two com panions reached a peak. Never had I seen him so discom bobul ated. There had always been a touc h of fun, of not qui te taking himself serious ly in everything he did or said to me. No t this time, though. Again, I tried to think, bring forth som e memory that woul d shed light on all this; and again I failed, but I did not feel defeated; an improbable surge of opt imism ove rtook me. I felt that everything was ‘com ing along as it shoul d. Do n Juan’s expr essed conc ern was that he kne w nothing about the dreaming I had done with the wom an in the church. To create a dream hotel, a dream tow n, a dream Carol Tiggs was to him onl y a sample of the old sorcerers’ dreaming prow ess, the total scope of w hich defied hum an imagination. Don Juan ope ned his arms expa nsively and finally smiled with his usual delight . “We can onl y deduc e that the wom an in the chur ch show ed you how to do it,” he said in a slow , deliberate tone . “It’s goi ng to be a giant task for you to make com prehensible an incom prehensible maneuve r.

She has used Carol’s energy"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 161 body and your s to lift off, to break away from her moor ings . She took you up on your offer of free energy. ” What he was saying had no meaning to me; appa rently, it meant a great deal to his two com panions . They became immensely agitated. Addressing them, don Juan expl ained that the death defier and the wom an in the chur ch were different expr essions of the same energy; the wom an in the church was the more powerful and com plex of the two. Upon taking cont rol, she made use of Carol Tiggs ’s energy body, in som e obs cure, om inous fashion congr uous with the old sorcerers’ machinations , and created the Carol Tiggs of the hot el, a Carol Tiggs of sheer intent. Don Juan adde d that Carol and the wom an may have arrived at som e sort of energetic agreement during their meeting. At that instant, a thought seemed to find its way to d on Juan. He stared at his two com panions , unbe lievingl y. Their eyes darted around, goi ng from one to the other. I was sure they were not merely look ing for agreement, for they seemed to have realized som ething in uni son. “All our speculations are useless,” don Juan said in a qui et, even tone . “I believe there is no longe r any Carol Tiggs . There isn’t any, wom an in the chur ch either; bot h have merged and flow n away on the wings of intent, I believe, forward. “The reason the Carol Tiggs of the hot el was so wo rried about her appe arance was because she was the wom an in the chur ch, making you dream a Carol Tiggs of anot her kind; an infinitely more pow erful Carol Tiggs . Don’t you remember what she said? ‘Dream your intent of me. Intend me forward.” “What doe s this mean, don Juan?” I asked stunne d. “It means that the death defier has seen her total way out . She has caught a ride with you. Your fate is her fate.” “Meaning what, don Juan?” “Meaning that if you reach freedom so will she.” “How is she goi ng to do that?” “Through Carol Tiggs . But don’ t worry about Carol.” He said this before I voi ced my appr ehension. “She’s capable of that maneuve r and much more.” Immensities were piling up on me. I already felt their crushing weight . I had a mom ent of lucidity and asked don Juan, “What is goi ng to be the out com e of all this?” He did not answer. He gazed at me, scanni ng me from head to toe. Then he slow ly and deliberately said, “The death defier’s gift cons ists of endl ess dreaming pos sibilities. One of them was your dream of Carol Tiggs in anot her time, in anot her world; a more vast world, ope n - ende d; a world where the impos sible might even be feasible. The implication was not onl y that you will live thos e pos sibilities but that one day you will com prehend them.” He stood u p, and we started to walk in silence tow ard his hous e. My thought s began’ to race wildly. They were not though ts, actually, but images, a mixture of memories of the wom an in the church and of Carol Tiggs , talking to me in the darkne ss in the dream hot el"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 162 ro om . A coupl e of times I was near to conde nsing thos e images into a feeling of my usual self, but I had to give it up; I had no energy for such a task. Before we arrived at the hous e, don Juan stoppe d walking and faced me. He again scrutinized me carefully, as if he were looki ng for signs in my body. I then felt obl iged to set him straight on a subj ect I believed he was deadly wrong about . “I was with the real Carol Tiggs at the hot el,” I said. “For a mom ent, I myself believed she was the death defier, but a fter careful evaluation, I can’t hold on to that belief. She was Carol. In som e obs cure, awesom e way she was at the hot el, as I was there at the hot el myself.” “Of cour se she was Carol,” don Juan agreed. “But not the Carol you and I know . This one was a dr eam Carol, I’ve told you , a Carol made out of pure intent. You helped the wom an in the chur ch spin that dream. Her art was to make that dream an all - inclusive reality: the art of the old sorcerers, the most fright ening thing there is. I told you that you w ere goi ng to get the crow ning lesson in dreaming, didn’ t I?” “What do you think happe ned to Carol Tiggs ?” I asked. “Carol Tiggs is gone ,” he replied. “But som eday you will find the new Carol Tiggs , the one in the dream hot el room .” “What do you mean she’s gone ?” “She’s gone from the world,” he said. I felt a surge of nervous ness cut through my solar plexus . I was awakening. The awareness of myself had started to becom e familiar to me, but I was not yet fully in cont rol of it. It had begun , though , to break throug h the fog of the dream; it had begun as a mixture of not know ing what was goi ng on and the forebodi ng sensation that the incom mensurable was just around the corner. I must have had an expr ession of disbelief, because don Juan adde d in a forceful tone , “This is dreaming. You shoul d know by now that its transactions are final. Carol Tiggs is gone .” “But where do you think she went, don Juan?” “Wherever the sorcerers of antiqui ty went. I told you that the death defier’s gift was endl ess dreaming pos sibil ities. You didn’ t want anything conc rete, so the wom an in the chur ch gave you an abstract gift: the pos sibility of flying on the wings of intent.” "}]
