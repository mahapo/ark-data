I call him \"don J uan.\" In Spanish, don is an appellative used to denote respect. I made don J uan's acquaintance unde r the most fortuitous circumstances. I was sitting with Bill, a friend of mine, in a bus depot in a border town in Arizona. We were very qui et. In the late afternoon t he summer heat seemed unbe arable. Suddenly he leaned ove r and tapped me on the shoulder. \"There's the man I told you a bout,\" he said in a low voice. He nodde d casually toward the entrance. An old man had just walked in. \"What did you t ell me about him?\" I asked. \"He's the Indian that know s about peyote. Remember?\" I remembered that Bill and I had onc e driven all day looking for the hous e of an \"eccentric\" Mexican Indian who lived in the area. We did not find the man's hous e and I had the feeling that the Indians whom we had asked for directions had deliberately misled us. Bill had told me that the man was a \"yerbero,\" a person who ga thers and sells medicinal herbs, and that he knew a great deal about the hallucinogenic cactus, peyote. He had also said that it would be worth my while to meet him. Bill was my gui de in the Southwest while I was collecting information and specimens of medicinal plants used by t he Indians of the area. Bill got up and went to greet the man. The Indian was of medium height. His hair was white and short, and grew a bit over his ears, accentuating the roundne ss of his head. He was very dark; the deep wrinkles cm his face gave him the appearance of age, yet his body s eemed to be strong a nd fit. I watched him for a moment. He moved around w ith a nimbleness that I would have thought impossible for an old man. Bill signaled me to join them. \"He's a nice guy,\" Bill said to me. \"But I can't unde rstand hi m. His Spanish is weird, full of rural colloquial- isms, I suppos e.\" The old man looked at Bill and smiled. And Bill, who speaks only a few words of Spanish, made up an absurd phr ase in that language. He looked at me as if asking whether he was making sense, but I did not know what he had had in mind; he then smiled shyly and walked away. The old man looked at me and be gan laughing. I explained to him that my friend sometimes forgot that he did not speak Spanish. \"I think he also forgot to introduce us,\" I said, and I told him my name. \"And I am Juan Matus, at your service,\" he said. We shook ha nds and remained qui et for some time. I broke the silence and told him about my enterprise. I told him that I was looking for any ki nd of information on pl ants, especially peyote. I talked compulsively for a long t ime, and although I was almost totally ignorant on the subject, I said I knew a great deal about peyote. I thought that if I boasted about my know ledge he would become interested in talking to me. But he did not say anything. H e listened patiently. Then he nodde d slowly and pe ered at me. His eyes seemed to shine with a light of their own. I avoided his gaze. I felt embarrassed. I had the certainty that at that moment he knew I was talking nonsense. \"Come to my hous e some time,\" he finally said, taking hi s eyes away from me. \"Perhaps we could talk there with more ease.\" I did not know what else to say. I felt uneasy. After a while Bill came back into the room. He recognized my discomfort and di d not say a word. We sat in tight silence for some time. Then the old man got up. H is bus had come. He said goodbye . \"It didn't go too well, did it?\" Bill asked. 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"No.\" \"Did you a sk him about plants?\" \"I did. But I think I goof ed.\" \"I told you, he 's very eccentric. The Indians around he re know him, yet they never mention hi m. And that's something.\" \"He said I could come to his hous e, though.\" \"He was bullshitting you. S ure, you c an go t o his hous e, but what does it mean? He'll never tell you a nything. If you e ver ask him anything he 'll clam up as if you w ere an idiot talking nons ense.\" Bill said convincingly that he had encountered people like him before, people who ga ve the impression of know ing a great deal. In his judgm ent, he said, such people were not worth the trouble, because sooner or later one could obt ain the same information from someone else who di d not play hard to get. He said that he had neither patience nor time for old fogies, and that it was possible that the old man was only presenting hi mself as being know ledgeable about herbs, when in reality he knew as little as the next man. Bill went on talking but I was not listening. M y mind ke pt on w ondering about the old Indian. He knew I had been bluffing. I remembered his eyes. They had actually shone. I went back to see him a couple of months later, not so much as a student of anthropology i nterested in medicinal plants but as a person with an inexplicable curiosity. The way he had looked at me was an unprecedented event in my life. I wanted to know what was involved in that look, i t became almost an obs ession with me. I ponde red it and the more I thought about it the more unus ual it seemed to be. Don Juan and I became friends, and for a year I paid innum erable visits. I found hi s manner very reassuring I his sense of hum or superb; but above all I felt there a silent consistency about his acts, a consistency which was thoroughl y baffling to me. I felt a strange delight in his presence and at the same time I experienced a strange discomfort. His mere company forced me to make a tremendous reevaluation of my models of behavior. I had been reared, perhaps like everyone else, to have a readiness to accept man as an essentially weak and fallible creature. What impressed me about don J uan was the fact that he did not make a point of being weak and helpless, and just being around hi m insured an unf avorable comparison be tween his way of behaving and m ine. Perhaps one of the most impressive statements he made to me at that time was concerned with our inherent difference. Prior to one of my visits I had been feeling qui te unha ppy a bout the total course of my life and about a number of pressing pe rsonal conflicts that I had. When I arrived at his hous e I felt moody a nd ne rvous. We were talking about my interest in know ledge; but, as usual, we were on two different tracks. I was referring to academic know ledge that transcends experience, while he was talking about direct know ledge of the world. \"Do you know anything about the world around you? \" he asked. \"I know all kinds of things,\" I said. \"I mean do you e ver feel the world around you? \" \"I feel as much of the world around m e as I can.\" \"That's not enough. Y ou m ust feel everything, ot herwise the world loses its sense.\" I voiced the classical argument that I did not have to taste the soup i n order to know the recipe, nor did I have to get an electric shock in order to know about electricity. \"You m ake it sound s tupid,\" he said. \"The way I see it, you w ant to cling to your arguments, despite the fact that they bring not hing to you; you w ant to remain the same even at the cost of your well-being.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"I am talking about the fact that you're not complete. You ha ve no pe ace.\" That statement annoye d me. I felt offended. I thought he was certainly not qualified to pass judgm ent on m y acts or my personality. \"You're plagued with problems,\" he said. \"Why?\" \"I am only a man, don J uan,\" I said peevishly. I made that statement in the same vein my father used to make it. Whenever he said he was only a man he 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"implicitly meant he was weak and he lpless and hi s statement, like mine, was filled with an ultimate sense of despair. Don Juan peered at me as he had done the first day we met. \"You think about your self too m uch,\" he said and smiled. \"And that gives you a strange fatigue that makes you s hut off the world around you a nd cling to your arguments. Therefore, all you ha ve is problems. I'm only a man too, but I don't mean that the way you do.\" \"How do you m ean it?\" \"I've vanquished my problems. Too ba d my life is so short that I can't grab ont o all the things I would like to. But that is not an issue; it's only a pity.\" I liked the tone of his statement. There was no de spair or self-pity in it. In 1961, a year after our first meeting, don J uan disclosed to me that he had a secret know ledge of medicinal plants. He told me he was a \"brujo.\" The Spanish word brujo can be rendered in English as sorcerer, medicine man, curer. From that point on the relation be tween us changed; I became his apprentice and for the next four years he endeavored to teach me the mysteries of sorcery. I have written about that apprenticeship in The Teach- ings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge. Our conversations were conduc ted in Spanish, and thanks to don J uan's superb command of that language I obtained detailed explanations of the intricate means of his system of beliefs. I have referred to that complex and well-systematized body of know ledge as sorcery and to him as a sorcerer because those categories he himself used in informal conversations. In the context of more serious elucidations, how ever, he could use the terms \"know ledge\" to categorize sorcery and \"man of know ledge\" or \"one who know s\" to categorize a sorcerer. In order to teach and corroborate his know ledge don J uan used three well-know n psychotropic plants: peyote, Lophophor a williamasii; jimson weed, Datura inoxia; and a species of mushroom which belongs to the genus Psylocebe. Through t he separate ingestion of each of these hallucinogens he produced in me, as his apprentice, some peculiar states of distorted perception, or altered consciousness, which I have called \"states of nonor dinary reality.\" I have used the word \"reality\" because it was a major premise in don J uan's system of beliefs that the states of consciousness produced by t he ingestion of any of those three plants were not hallucinations, but con- crete, although unor dinary, aspects of the reality of everyday life. Don Juan behaved toward these states of non- ordinary reality not \"as if\" they were real but \"as\" real. To classify these plants as hallucinogens and the states they produced as nonor dinary reality is, of course, my own device. Don Juan unde rstood a nd explained the plants as being ve hicles that would conduc t or lead a man to certain impersonal forces or \"powers\" and the states they produced as being the \"meetings\" that a sorcerer had to have with those \"powers\" in order to gain control over them. He called peyote \"Mescalito\" and he explained it as being a benevolent teacher and pr otector of men. Mescalito taught the \"right way to live.\" Peyote was usually ingested at gatherings of sorcerers called \"mitotes,\" where the participants would gather specifically to seek a lesson on t he right way to live. Don Juan considered the jimson weed and the mushrooms to be powers of a different sort. He called them \"allies\" and said that they were capable of being m anipulated; a sorcerer, in fact, drew his strength from manipu- lating an ally . Of the two, don J uan preferred the mushroom. He maintained that the power contained in the mushroom was his personal ally and he called it \"smoke\" or \"little smoke.\" Don Juan's procedure to utilize the mushrooms was to let them dry into a fine powder inside a small gour d. He kept the gour d sealed for a year and then mixed the fine powder with five other dry plants and pr oduced a mixture for smoking in a pipe. In order to become a man of know ledge one had to \"meet\" with the ally as many times as possible; one had to become familiar with it. This premise implied, of course, that one had to smoke the hallucinogenic mixture quite often. The process of \"smoking\" consisted of ingesting the fine mushroom powder, which did not incinerate, and inhaling the smoke of the other five plants that made up the mixture. Don Juan explained the profound e ffects that the mushrooms had on one 's perceptual capacities as the \" ally removing one 's body.\" Don Juan's method of teaching required an extraordinary effort on the part of the apprentice. In fact, the 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"degree of participation and involvement needed was so strenuous that by the end of 1965 I had to withdraw from the apprenticeship. I can say now , with the perspective of the five years that have elapsed, that at that time don Juan's teachings had begun t o pos e a serious threat to my \"idea of the world.\" I had begun t o lose the certainty, which all of us have, that the reality of everyday life is something we can take for granted. At the time of my withdrawal I was convinced that my decision was final; I did not want to see don J uan ever again. However, in April of 1968 a n early copy of my book w as made available to me and I felt compelled to show it to him. I paid him a visit. Our link of teacher-apprentice was mysteriously reestablished, and I can say that on that occasion I began a second c ycle of apprenticeship, very different from the first. My fear was not as acute as it had been in the past. The total mood of don J uan's teachings was more relaxed. He laughed and also made me laugh a great deal. There seemed to be a deliberate intent on hi s part to minimize seriousness in general. He clowned dur ing the truly crucial moments of this second c ycle, and thus helped me to ove rcome experiences which could easily have become obsessive. His premise was that a light and amenable disposition was needed in order to withstand the impact and the strangeness of the know ledge he was teaching m e. \"The reason you got scared and qui t is because you f elt too da mn important,\" he said, explaining m y previous withdrawal. \"Feeling important makes one heavy, clumsy, and va in. To be a man of know ledge one needs to be light and fluid.\" Don Juan's particular interest in his second c ycle of apprenticeship was to teach me to \"see.\" Apparently in his system of know ledge there was the possibility of making a semantic difference between \"seeing\" and \"looking\" as two distinct manners of perceiving. \"Looking\" referred to the ordinary way in which we are accustomed to perceive the world, while \"seeing\" entailed a very complex process by vi rtue of which a man of know ledge allegedly perceives the \"essence\" of the things of the world. In order to present the intricacies of this learning pr ocess in a readable form I have condensed long pa ssages of questions and answers, and thus I have edited my original field not es. It is my belief, how ever, that at this point my presentation cannot possibly detract from the meaning of don J uan's teachings. The editing was aimed at making m y not es flow, as conversation flows, so they would have the impact I desired; that is to say, I wanted by m eans of a reportage to communicate to the reader the drama and di rectness of the field situation. E ach section I have set as a chapter was a session with don J uan. As a rule, he always concluded each of our sessions on an abrupt note; thus the dramatic tone of the ending of each chapter is not a literary device of my own, it was a device proper of don J uan's oral tradition. It seemed to be a mnemonic device that helped me to retain the dramatic quality and importance of the lessons. Certain explanations are needed, how ever, to make my reportage cogent, since its clarity depends on the elucidation of a num ber of key concepts or key uni ts that I want to emphasize. This choice of emphasis is congruous with my interest in social science. It is perfectly pos sible that another person with a different set of goals and expectations would single out concepts entirely different from those I have chosen myself. During the second c ycle of apprenticeship don J uan made a point of assuring m e that the use of the smoking mixture was the indispensable prerequisite to \"seeing.\" Therefore I had to use it as often as possible. \"Only the smoke can give you t he necessary speed to catch a glimpse of that fleeting world,\" he said. With the aid of the psychotropic mixture, he produced in me a series of states of nonor dinary reality. The main feature of such states, in relation to what don J uan seemed to be doing, w as a condition of \"inapplicability.\" What I perceived in those states of altered consciousness was incomprehensible and impossible to interpret by means of our everyday mode of unde rstanding the world. In other words, the condition of inapplicability entailed the cessation of the pertinence of my world view. Don Juan used this condition of inapplicability of the states of nonor dinary reality in order to introduce a series of preconceived, new \"units of meaning.\" Units of meaning were all the single elements pertinent to the know ledge don J uan was striving to teach me. I have called them units of meaning be cause they were the basic conglomerate of sensory data and their interpretations on w hich more complex meaning was constructed. One example of such a unit is the way in which the phys iological effect of the psychotropic mixture was unde rstood. It produced a num bness and loss of motor control that was interpreted in don J uan's system as an act performed 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"by the smoke, which in this case was the ally , in order \"to remove the body of the practitioner.\" Units of meaning were grouped together in a specific way, and each block thus created formed what I have called a \"sensible interpretation.\" Obviously there has to be an endless num ber of possible sensible interpretations that are pertinent to sorcery that a sorcerer must learn to make. In our day-to-day life we are confronted with an endless num ber of sensible interpretations pertinent to it. A simple example could be the no longer deliberate interpretation, w hich we make scores of times every day, of the structure we call \"room.\" It is obvi ous that we have learned to interpret the structure we call room in terms of room; thus room is a sensible interpretation because it requires that at the time we make it we are cognizant, in one way or another, of all the elements that enter into its composition. A system of sensible interpretation is, in other words, the process by vi rtue of which a practitioner is cognizant of all the units of meaning ne cessary to make assumptions, deductions, predictions, etc., about all the situations pertinent to his activity. By \"practitioner\" I mean a participant who ha s an adequate know ledge of all, or nearly all, the units of mean- ing involved in his particular system of sensible interpretation. D on Juan was a practitioner; that is, he was a sorcerer who kne w all the steps of his sorcery. As a practitioner he attempted to make his system of sensible interpretation accessible to me. Such an accessibility, in this case, was equivalent to a process of re-socialization in which new ways of interpreting perceptual data were learned. I was the \"stranger,\" the one who lacked the capacity to make intelligent and congruous interpretations of the units of meaning pr oper to sorcery. Don Juan's task, as a practitioner making hi s system accessible to me, was to disarrange a particular certainty which I share with everyone else, the certainty that our \"common-sense\" views of the world are final. Through the use of psychotropic plants, and through w ell-directed contacts between the alien system and m yself, he succeeded in poi nting out to me that my view of the world cannot be final because it is only an interpretation. For the American Indian, perhaps for thousands of years, the vague phenomenon w e call sorcery has been a serious bona fide practice, comparable to that of our science. Our difficulty in unde rstanding it stems, no doubt , from the alien uni ts of meaning with which it deals. Don Juan had onc e told me that a man of know ledge had predilections. I asked him to explain his statement. \"My predilection is to see,\" he said. \"What do you m ean by t hat?\" \"I like to see\" he said, \"because only by seeing can a man of know ledge know .\" \"What kind of things do you see?\" \"Everything.\" \"But I also see everything and I'm not a man of know ledge.\" \"No. You don' t see. \"I think I do.\" \"I tell you, you don' t.\" \"What makes you s ay that, don J uan?\" \"You onl y look a t the surface of things.\" \"Do you m ean that every man of know ledge actually sees through e verything he looks at?\" \"No. That's not what I mean. I said that a man of know ledge has his own predilections; mine is just to see and to know ; others do ot her things.\" \"What other things, for example?\" \"Take Sacateca, he's a man of know ledge and hi s predilection is dancing. S o he dances and know s.\" \"Is the predilection of a man of know ledge something he does in order to know ?\" \"Yes, that is correct.\" \"But how could dancing he lp Sacateca to know ?\" \"One can say that Sacateca dances with all he has.\" \"Does he dance like I dance? I mean like dancing?\" 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"Let's say that he dances like I see and not like you m ay dance.\" \"Does he also see the way you see ?\" \"Yes, but he also dances.\" \"How does Sacateca dance?\" \"It's hard to explain that. It is a peculiar way of dancing he does when he wants to know . But all I can say about it is that, unless you unde rstand the ways of a man who know s, it is impossible to talk about dancing or seeing .\" \"Have you seen him doing hi s dancing?\" \"Yes. However, it is not possible for everyone who looks at his dancing to see that it is his peculiar way of know ing.\" I knew Sacateca, or at least I knew who he was. We had met and onc e I had bought him a beer. He was very polite and told me I should feel free to stop at his hous e anytime I wanted to. I toyed for a long t ime with the idea of visiting hi m but I did not tell don J uan. On the afternoon of May 14, 1962, I drove up to Sacateca's hous e; he had given me directions how to get there and I had no t rouble finding it. It was on a corner and ha d a fence all around i t. The gate was closed. I walked around i t to see if I could peek inside the hous e. It appeared to be deserted. \"Don Elias,\" I called out loud. T he chickens got frightened and scattered about cackling furiously. A small dog c ame to the fence. I expected it to bark at me; instead, it just sat there looking at me. I called out once again and the chickens had another burst of cackling. An old woman came out of the hous e. I asked her to call don E lias. \"He's not here,\" she said. \"Where can I find hi m?\" \"He's in the fields.\" \"Where in the fields?\" \"I don't know . Come back in the late afternoon. H ell be here around f ive.\" \"Are you don E lias wife?\" \"Yes, I'm his wife,\" she said and smiled. I tried to ask her about Sacateca but she excused herself and said that she did not speak Spanish well. I got into my car and dr ove away. I returned to the hous e around s ix o'clock. I drove to the door and ye lled Sacateca's name. This time he came out of the hous e. I turned on m y tape recorder, which in its brown leather case looked like a camera hanging from my shoulder. He seemed to recognize me. \"Oh, it's you,\" he said, smiling. \"How's Juan?\" \"He's fine. But how are you, don E lias?\" He did not answer. He seemed to be nervous. Overtly he was very composed, but I felt that he was ill at ease. \"Has Juan sent you he re on some sort of errand?\" \"No. I came here by m yself.\" \"What in the world for?\" His question seemed to betray very bona fide surprise. \"I just wanted to talk to you,\" I said, hopi ng to sound a s casual as possible. \"Don Juan has told me marvelous things about you a nd I got curious and wanted to ask you a few questions.\" Sacateca was standing in front of me. His body w as lean and wiry. He was wearing kha ki pants and shirt. His eyes were half-closed; he seemed to be sleepy or perhaps drunk. H is mouth was open a bit and hi s lower lip hung. I noticed that he was breathing de eply and seemed to be almost snoring. T he thought came to me that Sacateca was undoubt edly plastered out of his mind. B ut that thought seemed to be very incongruous because only a few minutes before, when he came out of his hous e, he had been very alert and aware of my presence. \"What do you w ant to talk about?\" he finally said. His voice was tired; it was as though hi s words dragged after each other. I felt very une asy. It was as if his 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"tiredness was contagious and pul ling m e. \"Nothing in particular,\" I answered. \"I just came to chat with you i n a friendly way. You onc e asked me to come to your hous e.\" ''Yes, I did, but it's not the same now.\" \"Why isn't it the same?\" \"Don't you t alk with Juan?\" \"Yes, I do.\" \"Then what do you w ant with me?\" \"I thought maybe I could ask you s ome questions?\" \"Ask Juan. Isn't he teaching you? \" \"He is, but just the same I would like to ask you a bout what he is teaching m e, and ha ve your opinion. T his way I'll be able to know what to do.\" \"Why do you w ant to do t hat? Don't you t rust Juan?\" \"I do.\" \"Then why don' t you a sk him to tell you w hat you w ant to know ?\" \"I do. A nd he tells me. But if you c ould also tell me about what don J uan is teaching m e, perhaps I will understand be tter.\" \"Juan can tell you e verything. H e alone can do t hat. Don't you unde rstand that?\" \"I do, but then I'd like to talk with people like you, don E lias. One does not find a man of know ledge every day.\" \"Juan is a man of know ledge.\" \"I know that.\" \"Then why are you t alking to me?\" \"I said I came to be friends,\" \"No, you di dn't. There is something else about you t his time.\" I wanted to explain myself and all I could do w as mumble incoherently. Sacateca did not say anything. H e seemed to listen attentively. His eyes were half-closed again but I felt he was peering at me. He nodde d almost imperceptibly. Then his lids opened and I saw his eyes. He seemed to be looking pa st me. He casually tapped the floor with the tip of his right foot, just behind hi s left heel. His legs were slightly arched; his arms were limp against his sides. Then he lifted his-right arm; his hand was open with the palm turned perpendicular to the ground; his fingers were extended and poi nting toward me. He let his hand wobble a couple of times before he brought it to my face level. He held it in that position for an instant and then he said a few words to me. His voice was very clear, yet the words dragged. After a moment he dropped his hand to his side and remained motionless, taking a strange position. H e was standing, resting on t he ball of his left foot. His right foot was crossed behind the heel of the left foot and he was tapping the floor rhythmically and ge ntly with the tip of his right foot I felt an unw arranted apprehension, a form of restlessness. My thought s seemed to be dissociated. I was thinking unr elated nons ensical thought s that had not hing to do w ith what was going on. I noticed my discomfort and tried to steer my thought s back to the situation at hand, but I couldn't in spite of a great struggle. It was as if some force was keeping m e from concentrating or thinking relevant thought s. Sacateca had not said a word, and I didn't know what else to say or do. Q uite automatically, I turned around and left. Later on I felt compelled to tell don J uan about my encounter with Sacateca. Don Juan roared with laughter. \"What really took pl ace there?\" I asked. \"Sacateca danced!\" don J uan said. \"He saw you, t hen he danced.\" \"What did he do to me? I felt very cold and di zzy.\" \"He apparently didn't like you a nd stopped you by t ossing a word at you.\" \"How could he possibly do t hat?\" I exclaimed incredulously. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"Very simple; he stopped you w ith his will .\" \"What did you s ay?\" \"He stopped you w ith his will !\" The explanation di d not suffice. His statements sounde d like gibberish to me. I tried to probe him further, but he could not explain the event to my satisfaction. Obviously that event or any event that occurred within this alien system of sensible interpretation could be explained or unde rstood onl y in terms of the units of meaning pr oper to that system. This work is, therefore, a reportage and should be read as a reportage. The system I recorded was incomprehensible to me, thus the pretense to anything ot her than reporting about it would be misleading and impertinent. In this respect I have adopted the phenomenological method a nd ha ve striven to deal with sorcery solely as phenomena that were presented to me. I, as the perceiver, recorded what I perceived, and at the moment of recording I endeavored to suspend judgm ent. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"P ar t 1 The Preliminaries of “Seeing” 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"1 April 2.1968 Don Juan looked at me for a moment and di d not seem at all surprised to see me, even though i t had been more than two years since I last visited him. He put his hand on m y shoulder and smiled gently and said that I looked different, that I was getting fat and soft. I had brought him a copy of my book. W ithout any pr eliminaries I took i t out of my brief case and ha nded it to him. \"It's a book a bout you, don J uan,\" I said. He took i t and flipped through t he pages as if they were a deck of cards. He liked the green color on the dust jacket and the height of the book. H e felt the cover with his palms, turned it around a couple of times, and then handed it back to me. I felt a great surge of pride. \"I want you t o keep it,\" I said. He shook hi s head with a silent laugh. \"I better not,\" he said, and then added with a broad \"You know what we do w ith paper in Mexico.\" I laughed. I thought his touch of irony w as beautiful. We where sitting on a bench in the park of a small town in the mountainous area of central Mexico. I had absolutely no w ay of letting hi m know about my intention of paying hi m a visit, but I was certain I was going to find hi m, and I did. I waited onl y a short while in that town before don J uan came down from the mountains and I found hi m at the market, at the stand of one of his friends. Don Juan told me, matter-of-factly, that I was there just in time to take him back to Sonora, and we sat in the park to wait for a friend of his, a Mazatec Indian with whom he lived. We waited about three hour s. We talked about different unimportant things, and toward the end of the day, right before his friend came, I related to him some events I had witnessed a few days before. During m y trip to see him my car broke down in the outskirts of a city and I had to stay in town for three days while it was being repaired. There was a motel across the street from the auto shop, but the outskirts of towns are always depressing for me, so I took l odgings in a modern eight-story hot el in the center of town. The bellboy t old me that the hotel had a restaurant, and when I came down to eat I found t hat there were tables out on the sidewalk. It was a rather handsome arrangement set on the street corner unde r some low brick arches of modern lines. It was cool outside and there were empty tables, yet I preferred to sit in the stuffy indoor s. I had not iced upon e ntering that a group of shoeshine boys were sitting on t he curb in front of the restaurant, and I was certain they would have hounde d me had I taken one of the outside tables. From where I was seated I could see the group of boys through t he glass window . A couple of young m en took a table and the boys flocked around t hem, asking to shine their shoes. The young m en refused and I was amazed to see that the boys did not insist and went back to sit on the curb. After a while three men in bus iness suits got up and left and the boys ran to their table and be gan eating the leftovers; in a matter of seconds the plates were clean. The same thing ha ppened with leftovers on all the other tables. I noticed that the children were quite orderly; if they spilled water they sponge d it up w ith their own shoeshine cloths. I also not iced the thoroughne ss of their scavenging pr ocedures. They even ate the ice cubes left in the glasses of water and the lemon slices from the tea, peel and all. There was absolutely not hing that they wasted. In the course of the time I stayed in the hotel I found out that there was an agreement between the children and the manager of the restaurant; the boys were allowed to hang around t he premises to make some money from the customers and were also allowed to eat the leftovers, provided that they did not harass anybody a nd di d not break anything. T here were eleven in all, ranging in age from five to twelve; the oldest, how ever, was kept a dis- tance from the rest of the group. T hey deliberately ostracized him, taunting hi m with a singsong t hat he already had pubi c hair and was too ol d to be among t hem. After three days of watching them go like vultures after the most meager of leftovers I became desponde nt, and I left that city feeling that there was no hope for those children whose world was already m olded by t heir 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"day-after-day struggle for crumbs. \"Do you f eel sorry for them?\" don J uan exclaimed in a questioning tone. \"I certainly do,\" I said. \"Why?\" \"Because I'm concerned with the well-being of my fellow men. Those are children and their world is ugly and cheap.\" \"Wait! Wait! How can you s ay that their world is ugly and cheap?\" don J uan said, mocking m y statement. \"You think that you're better off, don' t you? \" I said I did; and he asked me why; and I told him that in comparison to those children's world mine was infinitely more varied and rich in experiences and in oppor tunities for personal satisfaction and de velopment. Don Juan's laughter was friendly and ge nuine. He said that I was not careful with what I was saying, that I had no way of know ing about the richness and the oppor tunities in the world of those children. I thought don J uan was being stubbor n. I really thought he was taking the oppos ite view just to annoy m e. I sincerely believed that those children did not have the slightest chance for any intellectual growth. I argued my poi nt for a while longer and then don J uan asked me bluntly, \"Didn't you onc e tell me that in your opinion m an's greatest accomplishment was to become a man of know ledge?\" I had said that, and I repeated again that in my opi nion to become a man of know ledge was one of the greatest intellectual accomplishments. \"Do you t hink that your very rich world would ever help you t o become a man of know ledge?\" don J uan asked with slight sarcasm. I did not answer and he then worded the same question in a different manner, a thing I always do to him when I think he does not unde rstand. \"In other words,\" he said, smiling br oadly, obvi ously aware that I was cognizant of his ploy, \"can your free- dom and oppor tunities help you t o become a man of know ledge?\" \"No!\" I said emphatically. \"Then how could you f eel sorry for those children?\" he said seriously. \"Any of them could become a man of know ledge. All the men of know ledge I know were kids like those you s aw eating leftovers and licking the tables.\" Don Juan's argument gave me an unc omfortable sensation. I had not felt sorry for those unde rprivileged children because they did not have enough t o eat, but because in my terms their world had already condemned them to be intellectually inadequate. And ye t in don J uan's terms any of them could achieve what I believed to be the epitome of man's intellectual accomplishment, the goal of becoming a man of know ledge. My reason for pitying them was incongruous. Don Juan had nailed me neatly. \"Perhaps you're right,\" I said. \"But how can one avoid the desire, the genuine desire, to help our fellow men?\" \"How do you t hink one can help them?\" \"By alleviating their burden. The least one can do f or our fellow men is to try to change them. You your self are involved in doi ng that. Aren't you? \" \"No. I'm not. I don't know what to change or why to change anything in my fellow men.\" \"What about me, don J uan? Weren't you t eaching m e so I could change?\" \"No. I'm not trying to change you. I t may happen that one day you m ay become a man of know ledge—there's no way to know that—but that will not change you. S ome day perhaps you'll be able to see men in another mode and then you' ll realize that there's no w ay to change anything about them.\" \"What's this other mode of seeing m en, don J uan?\" \"Men look di fferent when you see. The little smoke will help you t o see men as fibers of light\" \"Fibers of light?\" \"Yes. Fibers, like white cobwebs. Very fine threads that circulate from the head to the navel. Thus a man looks like an egg of circulating fibers. And hi s arms and legs are like luminous bristles, bursting out in all direc- 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"tions.\" \"Is that the way everyone looks?\" \"Everyone. Besides, every man is in touch with everything else, not through hi s hands, though, but through a bunch of long f ibers that shoot out from the center of his abdom en. Those fibers join a man to his surroundi ngs; they keep his balance; they give him stability. So, as you m ay see some day, a man is a luminous egg whether he's a beggar or a king and there's no w ay to change anything; or rather, what could be changed in that luminous egg? What?\" 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 My visit to don J uan started a new cycle. I had no t rouble falling ba ck again into my old pattern of enjoying his sense of drama and hi s hum or and hi s patience with me. I definitely felt that I had to visit him more often. Not to see don J uan was indeed a great loss for me; besides, I had something of particular interest that I wanted to dis- cuss with him. After I had finished the book a bout his teachings I began to reexamine the field not es I had not used. I had discarded a great deal of data because my emphasis had been on t he states of nonor dinary reality. Rehashing m y old not es I had come to the conclusion that a skillful sorcerer could bring forth the most specialized range of perception in his apprentice by simply \"manipulating social cues.\" My whole argument about the nature of these manipulatory procedures rested on t he assumption that a leader was needed to bring forth the necessary range of perception. I took a s a specific test case the sorcerer's peyote meetings. I contended that in those meetings sorcerers reached an agreement about the nature of reality without any ove rt exchange of words or signs, and m y conclusion was that a very sophisticated code was employed by t he participants to arrive at such an agreement. I had constructed a complex system to explain the code and pr ocedures, so I went back to see don J uan to ask his personal opinion and advice about my work. May 21,1968 Nothing out of the ordinary happened dur ing m y trip to see don J uan. The temperature in the desert was over a hundr ed degrees and was quite uncomfortable. The heat subsided in the late afternoon a nd by t he tune I arrived at his hous e, in the early evening, there was a cool breeze. I was not very tired, so we sat in his room and talked, I felt comfortable and relaxed, and we talked for hour s. It was not a conversation that I would have liked to record; I was not really trying to make great sense or trying to draw great meaning; we talked about the weather, the crops, his grandson, the Yaqui Indians, the Mexican gove rnment. I told don J uan how much I enjoyed the exquisite sensation of talking in the dark. He said that my statement was consistent with my talkative nature; that it was easy for me to like chattering in the darkness because talking was the only thing I could do a t that time, while sitting around. I argued that it was more than the mere act of talking that I enjoyed. I said that I relished the soothing warmth of the darkness around us . He asked me what I did at hom e when it was dark. I said that invariably I would turn on t he lights or I would go out into the lighted streets until it was time to go t o sleep. \"Oh!\" he said incredulously. \"I thought you ha d learned to use the darkness.\" \"What can you us e it for?\" I asked. He said the darkness—and he called it \"The darkness of the day\"—was the best time to \"see.\" He stressed the word \"see\" with a peculiar inflection. I wanted to know what he meant by that, but he said it was too late to go into it then. May 22,1968 As soon a s I woke up in the morning, and without any pr eliminaries, I told don J uan that I had constructed a system to explain what took pl ace at a peyote meeting, a mitote, I took m y not es and read to him what I had done. He listened patiently while I struggled to elucidate my schemata. I said that I believed a covert leader was necessary in order to cue the participants so they could arrive at any pertinent agreement. I pointed out that people attend a mitote to seek the presence of Mescalito and hi s lessons about the right way to live; and that those persons never exchange a word or a gesture among t hem, yet they agree about the presence of Mescalito and hi s specific lesson. A t least that was what they pur portedly did in the mitotes I had attended; they agreed that Mescalito had appeared to them individually and ha d given them a lesson. In my personal experience I had found t hat the form of the individual visit of Mescalito and hi s consequent lesson were strikingly hom ogeneous, although va rying in content from person to person. I could not explain this hom ogeneity except as a result of a subtle and complex system of cueing. It took m e close to two hour s to read and explain to don J uan the scheme I had constructed. I ended my talk by be gging hi m to tell me in his own words what were the exact procedures for reaching agreement. When I had finished he frowned. I thought he must have found m y explanation challenging; he appeared to 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"be involved in deep deliberation. A fter a reasonable silence I asked him what he thought about my idea. My que stion m ade him suddenly turn his frown into a smile and then into roaring laughter. I tried to laugh too and asked nervously what was so funny. \"You're deranged!\" he exclaimed. \"Why should anyone be bothered with cueing at such an important time as a mitote? Do you t hink one ever fools around w ith Mescalito?\" I thought for a moment that he was being evasive; he was not really answering m y que stion. \"Why should anyone cue?\" don J uan asked stubbor nly. \"You ha ve been in mitotes. You should know that no one told you how to feel, or what to do, no one except Mescalito himself.\" I insisted that such an explanation was not possible and be gged him again to tell me how the agreement was reached. \"I know why you ha ve come,\" don J uan said in a mysterious tone. \"I can't help you i n your endeavor because there is no system of cueing.\" \"But how can all those persons agree about Mescalito's presence?\" ''They agree because they see\" don J uan said dramatically, and then added casually, \"Why don' t you a ttend another mitote and see for your self?\" I felt that was a trap. I did not say anything, but put my not es away. He did not insist. A while later he asked me to drive him to the hous e of one of his friends. We spent most of the day there. During the course of a conversation hi s friend John a sked me what bad become of my interest in peyote. John had provided the peyote buttons for my first experience nearly eight years before. I did not know what to say to him. Don Juan came to my aid and told John I was doing fine. On our way back to don J uan's hous e I felt obliged to make a comment about John's question and I said, among ot her things, that I had no i ntention of learning any m ore about peyote, because it required a kind of courage I did not have; and that I had really meant it when I said I had qui t. Don Juan smiled and di d not say anything. I kept on talking unt il we got to the hous e. We sat on the clean area in front of the door . It was a warm, clear day, but there was enough of a breeze in the late afternoon t o make it pleasant. \"Why do you ha ve to pus h so hard?\" don J uan said suddenly. \"How many ye ars now have you be en saying that you don' t want to learn any m ore?\" \"Three.\" \"Why are you s o vehement about it?\" \"I feel that I'm betraying you, don J uan. I think that's why I'm always talking about it.\" \"You're not betraying m e.\" \"I have failed you. I have run away. I feel I am defeated.\" \"You do w hat you c an. Besides, you ha ven't been defeated yet. What I have to teach you i s very hard. I, for instance, found i t perhaps even harder than you.\" \"But you ke pt at it, don J uan. My case is different. I gave up and I have come to see you not because I want to learn, but only because I wanted to ask you t o clarify a point in my work.\" Don Juan looked at me for a moment and then he looked away. \"You ought to let the smoke guide you a gain,\" he said forcefully. \"No, don J uan, I can't use your smoke any m ore. I think I have exhausted myself.\" \"You ha ven't begun.\" \"I am too afraid.\" \"So you' re afraid. There is nothing ne w about being afraid. Don't think about your fear. Think about the wonders of seeing!\" \"I sincerely wish I could think about those wonders, but I can't. When I think of your smoke I feel a sort of darkness coming upon m e. It is as if there were no m ore people on the earth, no one to turn to. Your smoke has shown me the ultimate of loneliness, don J uan.\" \"That's not true. Take me, for example. The smoke is my ally and I don't feel such a loneliness.\" 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"\"But you're different; you've conque red your fear.\" Don Juan patted me gently on t he shoulder. \"You're not afraid,\" he said softly. His voice carried a strange accusation. \"Am I lying about my fear, don J uan?\" \"I'm not concerned with lies,\" he said severely. \"I'm concerned with something else. The reason you don' t want to learn is not because you're afraid. It's something else.\" I vehemently urged him to tell me what it was. I pleaded with him, but he did not say anything; he just shook his head as if he could not believe I did not know it. I told him that perhaps it was inertia which kept me from learning. H e wanted to know the meaning of the word \"inertia.\" I read to him from my dictionary: \"The tendency of matter to remain at rest if at rest, or, if mov- ing, to keep moving in the same direction, unl ess affected by s ome outside force.\" \" 'Unless affected by s ome outside force,'\" he repeated. \"That's about the best word you' ve found. I 've told you a lready, onl y a crackpot would unde rtake the task of becoming a man of know ledge of his own accord. A sober-headed man has to be tricked into doi ng it.\" \"I'm sure there must be scores of people who would gladly unde rtake the task,\" I said. \"Yes, but those don't count. They are usually cracked. They are like gour ds that look f ine from the outside and ye t they would leak the minute you put pressure on them, the minute you f illed them with water. \"I had to trick you i nto learning onc e, tine same way my benefactor tricked me. Otherwise you w ouldn't have learned as much as you di d. Perhaps it's time to trick you a gain.\" The tricking to which he was referring was one of the most crucial points of my apprenticeship. It had taken place years before, yet in my mind it was as vivid as if it had just happened. Through ve ry artful manipulations don J uan had onc e forced me into a direct and terrifying confrontation with a woman reputed to be a sorceress. The clash resulted in a profound a nimosity on he r part Don Juan exploited my fear of the woman as motivation to continue with the apprenticeship, claiming that I had to learn more about sorcery in order to protect myself against her magical onslaughts. The end results of his \"tricking\" were so convincing that I sincerely felt I had no other recourse than to learn as much as possible if I wanted to stay alive. \"If you're planning to scare me again with that woman I simply won't come back any m ore,\" I said. Don Juan's laughter was very joyous . \"Don't worry,\" he said reassuringly. \"Tricks with fear won't work with you a ny m ore. You're no longer afraid. But if it is needed, you c an be tricked wherever you a re; you don' t have to be around he re for that.\" He put his arms behind hi s head and lay dow n to sleep. I worked on m y not es until he woke up a couple of hours later; it was almost dark then. Noticing that I was writing, he sat up straight and, smiling, asked me if I had written myself out of my problem. May 23,1968 We were talking about Oaxaca. I told don J uan that once I had arrived in the city on a day when the market was open, a day when scores of Indians from all over the area flock to town to sell food a nd all kinds of trinkets. I mentioned that I was particularly interested in a man who was selling m edicinal plants. He carried a wooden kit in which he kept a num ber of small jars with dry, shredded plants, and he stood i n the middle of the street holding one jar, yelling a very peculiar singsong. \"I bring he re,\" he would say, \"for fleas, flies, mosquitoes, and lice. \"Also for pigs, horses, goats, and cows. \"I have here for all the maladies of man. \"The mumps, the measles, rheumatism, and gout \"I bring he re for the heart, the liver, the stomach, and the loin. \"Come near, ladies and ge ntlemen. \"I bring he re for fleas, flies, mosquitoes, and lice.\" I had listened to him for a long t ime. His format consisted of enumerating a long l ist of man's diseases for which he claimed to have a cure; the device he used to give rhythm to his singsong w as to pause after naming a 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"set of four. Don Juan said that he also used to sell herbs in the market in Oaxaca when he was young. H e said he still re- membered his selling pi tch and he yelled it for me. He said that he and hi s friend Vicente used to make con- coctions. \"Those concoctions were really good,\" don J uan said. \"My friend Vicente used to make great extracts of plants.\" I told don J uan that once during one of my trips to Mexico I had met his friend Vicente. Don Juan seemed to be surprised and wanted to know more about it. I was driving through D urango a t that time and remembered that don J uan had onc e told me I should pay a visit to his friend, w ho lived there. I looked for him and found hi m, and talked to him for a while. Before I left he gave me a sack with some plants and a series of instructions for replanting one of them. I stopped on m y way to the town of Aguas Calientes. I made sure there were no pe ople around. F or at least ten minutes I had been watching the road and surroundi ng areas. There had not been any hous es in sight, nor cattle grazing alongside the road. I stopped on t he top of a small hill; from there I could see the road ahead and behind m e. It was deserted in bot h directions as far into the distance as I could see. I waited for a few minutes to orient myself and to remember don V icente's instructions. I took one of the plants, walked into a field of cacti on the east side of the road, and pl anted it as don V icente had instructed me. I had with me a bottle of mineral water with which I intended to sprinkle the plant. I tried to ope n it by hi tting the cap with the small iron ba r I had used as a digging stick, but the bottle exploded and a glass sliver nicked my uppe r lip and m ade it bleed. I walked back to my car to get another bottle of mineral water. As I was getting it out of my trunk a man driving a VW station wagon s topped and asked me if I needed help. I said that everything was all right and he drove away. I returned to water the plant and then I started back toward my car. When I was perhaps a hundr ed feet away I heard some voices. I hurried dow n a slope onto the highway and found t hree Mexicans at the car, two men and one woman. One of the men was sitting on t he front bum per. He was perhaps in his late thirties, of medium height, with black curly hair. He was carrying a bundl e on hi s back and was wearing ol d slacks and a worn-out pinkish shirt. His shoes were untied and pe rhaps too bi g for his feet; they seemed to be loose and uncomfortable. He was sweating pr ofusely. The other man was standing about twenty feet away from the car. He was small-boned and shorter than the other man, and hi s hair was straight and combed backwards. He carried a smaller bundl e and was older, perhaps in his late forties. His clothes were in better condition. H e had on a dark blue jacket, light blue slacks, and bl ack shoes. He was not perspiring at all and seemed aloof, uninterested. The woman appeared to be also in her forties. She was fat and ha d a very dark complexion. S he wore black Capris, a white sweater, and bl ack, poi nted shoes. She did not carry a bundl e, but was holding a portable transis- tor radio. She seemed to be very tired and he r face was covered with beads of perspiration. When I approached them the younge r man and the woman accosted me. They wanted a ride. I told them I did not have any space in my car. I showed them that the back seat was loaded to capacity and there was really no room left. The man suggested that if I drove slow they could go pe rched on t he back bum per, or lying across the front fender. I thought the idea was preposterous. Yet there was such an urgency in their plea that I felt very sad and ill at ease. I gave them some money for their bus fare. The younge r man took t he bills and thanked me, but the older man turned his back disdainfully. \"I want transportation,\" he said. \"I'm not interested in money.\" Then he turned to me. \"Can't you gi ve us some food or water?\" he asked. I really had not hing to give them. They stood t here looking at me for a moment and then they began to walk away. I got into my car and tried to start the motor. The heat was very intense and the motor seemed to be flooded. The younge r man stopped when he heard the starter grinding and came back and stood be hind m y car ready to push it. I felt a tremendous apprehension. I was actually panting de sperately. The motor finally ignited and I zoomed away. 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"After I had finished relating this, don J uan remained pensive for a long w hile. \"Why ha ven't you t old me this before?\" he said without looking at me. I did not know what to say. I shrugged my shoulders and told him that I never thought it was important. \"It's damn important!\" he said. \"Vicente is a first-rate sorcerer. He gave you s omething to plant because he had his reasons; and if you e ncountered three people who seemed to have poppe d out of nowhere right after you had planted it, there was a reason for that too; but only a fool like you w ould disregard the incident and think it wasn't important.\" He wanted to know exactly what had taken place when I paid don V icente the visit. I told him that I was driving across town and pa ssed by t he market; I got the idea then of looking for don Vicente. I walked into the market and went to the section for medicinal herbs. There were three stands in a row but they were run by t hree fat women. I walked to the end of the aisle and found a nother stand around t he corner. There I saw a thin, small-boned, white-haired man. He was at that moment selling a birdcage to a woman. I waited around unt il he was by hi mself and then I asked him if he knew Vicente Medrano. H e looked at me without answering. \"What do you w ant with that Vicente Medrano?\" he finally said. I told him I had come to pay him a visit on be half of his friend, and ga ve him don J uan's name. The old man looked at me for an instant and then he said he was Vicente Medrano and was at my service. He asked me to sit down. He seemed to be pleased, very relaxed, and ge nuinely friendly. I told him about my friendship with don Juan, I felt that there was an immediate bond of sympathy be tween us. He told me he had know n don J uan since they were in their twenties. Don Vicente had onl y words of praise for don J uan. Toward the end of our conversation he said in a vibrant tone: \"Juan is a true man of know ledge. I myself have dwelled onl y briefly with plant powers. I was always interested in their curative properties; I have even collected bot any books , which I sold onl y recently.\" He remained silent for a moment; he rubbed his chin a couple of times. He seemed to be searching for a proper word. \"You m ay say that I am only a man of lyric know ledge,\" he said. \"I'm not like Juan, my Indian brother.\" Don Vicente was silent again for another moment. His eyes were glassy and were staring at the floor by m y left side. Then he turned to me and said almost in a whisper, \"Oh, how high soars my Indian brother!\" Don Vicente got up. I t seemed that our conversation was finished. If anyone else had made a statement about an Indian brother I would have taken it for a cheap cliche. Don Vicente's tone, how ever, was so sincere and hi s eyes were so clear that he enraptured me with the image of his Indian brother soaring so high. A nd I believed he meant what he had said. \"Lyric know ledge, my eye!\" don J uan exclaimed after I had recounted the whole story. \"Vicente is a brujo. Why di d you go t o see him?\" I reminded him that he himself had asked me to visit don V icente, \"That's absurd!\" he exclaimed dramatically. \"I said to you, s ome day, when you know how to see, you s hould pay a visit to my friend Vicente; that's what I said. Apparently you w ere not listening.\" I argued that I could find no ha rm in having m et don V icente, that I was charmed by hi s manners and hi s kindness. Don Juan shook hi s head from side to side and in a half-kidding tone expressed his bewilderment at what he called my \"baffling good l uck,\" He said that my visiting don V icente was like walking into a lion's den armed with a twig. Don Juan seemed to be agitated, yet I could not see any reason for his concern. Don Vicente was a beautiful man. He seemed so frail; his strangely haunting eyes made him look a lmost ethereal. I asked don J uan how a beautiful person like that could be dangerous. \"You're a damn fool,\" he said and looked stern for a moment \"He won't cause you a ny ha rm by hi mself. But know ledge is power, and onc e a man embarks on the road of know ledge he's no longer liable for what may happen to those who come in contact with him. You should have paid him a visit when you kne w enough t o 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"defend your self; not from him, but from the power he has harnessed, which, by t he way, is not his or anybody else's.

He apparently liked you a nd m ust have made you a great gift, and you c hucked it. What a pity!\" May 24,1968 I had been pestering don J uan all day to tell me about don V icente's gift. I had poi nted out to him in various ways that he had to consider our differences; I said that what was self-explanatory for him might be totally in- comprehensible for me. \"How many pl ants did he give you? \" he finally asked, I said four, but I actually could not remember. Then don J uan wanted to know exactly what had taken place after I left don V icente and be fore I stopped on t he side of the road. But I could not remember either. \"The num ber of plants is important and so is the order of events,\" he said. \"How can I tell you w hat his gift was if you don' t remember what happened?\" I struggled uns uccessfully to visualize the sequence of events. \"If you w ould remember everything that happened,\" he said, \"I could at least tell you how you c hucked your gift.\" Don Juan seemed to be very disturbed. He urged me impatiently to recollect, but my memory was almost a total blank. \"What do you t hink I did wrong, don J uan?\" I said, just to continue the conversation. \"Everything.\" \"But I followed don V icente's instructions to the letter.\" \"So what? Don't you unde rstand that to follow his instructions was meaningless?\" \"Why?\" \"Because those instructions were designed for someone who could see, not for an idiot who got out with his life just by sheer luck. You went to see Vicente without preparation. H e liked you a nd ga ve you a gift. And that gift could easily have cost you your life.\" \"But why di d he give me something so serious? If he's a sorcerer he should've know n that I don't know any- thing.\" \"No, he couldn't have seen that. You look a s though you know , but you don' t know much really.\" I said I was sincerely convinced that I had never misrepresented myself, at least not deliberately. \"I didn't mean that,\" he said. \"If you w ere putting on a irs Vicente could've seen through you. T his is something worse than put ting on a irs. When I see you, you l ook t o me as if you know a great deal, and ye t I myself know that you don' t.\" \"What do I seem to know , don J uan?\" \"Secrets of power, of course; a brujo's know ledge. So when Vicente saw you he made you a gift and you acted toward it the way a dog a cts toward food w hen his belly is full. A dog pi sses on food w hen he doesn't want to eat any m ore, so other dogs won't eat it. You di d that on the gift. Now we'll never know what really took pl ace. You ha ve lost a great deal. What a waste!\" He was quiet for some time; then he shrugged his shoulders and smiled. \"It's useless to complain,\" he said, \"and ye t it's so difficult not to. Gifts of power happen so rarely in one 's life; they are unique and pr ecious. Take me, for instance; nobody ha s ever made me such a gift. There are few people, to my know ledge, who ever had one . To waste something so uni que is a shame.\" \"I see what you m ean, don J uan,\" I said. \"Is there anything I can do now to salvage the gift?\" He laughed and repeated several times, \"To salvage the gift.\" \"That sounds nice,\" he said. \"I like that. Yet there isn't anything one can do t o salvage your gift.\" May 25, 1968 Don Juan spent nearly all his time today showing m e how to assemble trapping de vices for small animals. We had been cutting and cleaning br anches nearly all morning. T here were many que stions in my mind. I had to talk to him while we worked, but he had made a joke and said that of the two of us only I could move my hands 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"and m y mouth at the same time. We finally sat down to rest and I blurted out a question. \"What's it like to see, don J uan?\" \"You ha ve to learn to see in order to know that. I can't tell you.\" \"Is it a secret I shouldn't know ?\" \"No. It's just that I can't describe it.\" \"Why?\" \"It wouldn't make sense to you.\" \"Try me, don J uan. Maybe it'll make sense to me.\" \"No. You m ust do it your self. Once you l earn, you c an see every single thing in the world in a different way.\" \"Then, don J uan, you don' t see the world in the usual way any m ore.\" \"I see both ways. When I want to look at the world I see it the way you do. T hen when I want to see it I look at it the way I know and I perceive it in a different way.\" \"Do things look c onsistently the same every time you see them?\" \"Things don't change. You change your way of looking, that's all\" \"I mean, don J uan, that if you see, for instance, the same tree, does it remain the same every time you see it?\" \"No. It changes and ye t it's the same.\" \"But if the same tree changes every time you see it, your seeing may be a mere illusion.\" He laughed and di d not answer for some time, but seemed to be thinking. F inally he said, \"Whenever you look a t things you don' t see them. You just look a t them, I suppos e, to make sure that something is there. Since you're not concerned with seeing, things look ve ry much the same every time you l ook a t them. When you l earn to see, on the other hand, a thing is never the same every time you see it, and ye t it is the same. I told you, f or in- stance, that a man is like an egg. E very time I see the same man I see an egg, ye t it is not the same egg.\" \"But you w on't be able to recognize anything, since nothing is the same; so what's the advantage of learning to see?\" \"You can tell things apart. You can see them for what they really are.\" \"Don't I see things as they really are?\" \"No. Your eyes have learned onl y to look. T ake, for example, the three people you e ncountered, the three Mexicans. You ha ve described them in detail, and even told me what clothes they wore. And that only proved to me that you di dn't see them at all. If you w ere capable of seeing you w ould have know n on t he spot that they were not people.\" \"They were not people? What were they?\" \"They were not people, that's all.\" \"But that's impossible. They were just like you a nd m e.\" \"No, they were not. I'm sure of it.\" I asked him if they were ghos ts, spirits, or the souls of dead people. His reply was that he did not know what ghos ts, spirits, and souls were. I translated for him the Webster's New World Dictionary definition of the word ghos ts: \"The suppos ed disembodied spirit of a dead person, conceived of as appearing to the living as a pale, shadowy apparition.\" And then the definition of spirit: \"A supernatural being, especially one thought of... as a ghos t, or as inhabiting a certain region, be ing of a certain (good or evil) character.\" He said they could perhaps be called spirits, although t he definition I had read was not quite adequate to de- scribe them. \"Are they gua rdians of some sort?\" I asked. \"No. They don' t guard anything.\" \"Are they ove rseers? Are they watching ove r us?\" \"They are forces, neither good nor bad, just forces that a brujo learns to harness.\" \"Are they the allies, don J uan?\" \"Yes, they are the allies of a man of know ledge.\" This was the first time in eight years of our association that don J uan had come close to defining an \"ally .\" I 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"must have asked him to do s o doz ens of times. He usually disregarded my que stion, saying that I knew what an ally was and that it was stupid to voi ce what I already kne w. Don Juan's direct statement about the nature of an ally was a nove lty and I was compelled to probe him. \"You told me the allies were in the plants,\" I said, \"in the jimson weed and in the mushrooms.\" \"I've never told you t hat,\" he said with great conviction. \"You always jump to your own conclusions.\" \"But I wrote it down in my not es, don J uan.\" \"You m ay write whatever you w ant, but don't tell me I said that.\" I reminded him that he had at first told me his benefactor's ally was the jimson weed and hi s own ally was the little smoke; and that he had later clarified it by saying that the ally was contained in each plant. \"No. That's not correct,\" he said, frowning. \"My ally is the little smoke, but that doesn't mean that my ally is in the smoking m ixture, or in the mushrooms, or in my pipe. They all have to be put together to get me to the ally , and that ally I call little smoke for reasons of my own.\" Don Juan said that the three people I had seen, whom he called \"those who are not people\"— los que no son gente —were in reality don V icente's allies. I reminded him that he had established that the difference between an ally and M escalito was that an ally could not be seen, while one could easily see Mescalito. We involved our selves in a long di scussion then. He said that he had established the idea that an ally could not be seen because an ally adopted any form. When I pointed out that he had onc e also said that Mescalito adopted any form, don J uan dropped the whole conversation, saying that the \"seeing\" to which he was referring was not like ordinary \"looking at things\" and that my confusion stemmed from my insistence on talking. Hours later don J uan himself started back again on t he topic of the allies. I had felt he was somehow annoye d by m y que stions so I had not pressed him any further. He was showing m e then how to make a trap for rabbits; I had to hol d a long s tick and be nd it as far as possible so he could tie a string around t he ends. The stick was fairly thin but still demanded considerable strength to bend. M y head and arms were shivering with the exertion and I was nearly exhausted when he finally tied the string. We sat down and be gan to talk. He said it was obvi ous to him that I could not comprehend anything unl ess I talked about it, and that he did not mind m y que stions and was going to tell me about the allies. \"The ally is not in the smoke,\" he said. \"The smoke takes you t o where the ally is, and when you be come one with the ally you don' t ever have to smoke again. From then on you c an summon your ally at will and m ake him do anything you w ant. \"The allies are neither good nor evil, but are put to use by the sorcerers for whatever purpose they see fit. I like the little smoke as an ally because it doesn't demand m uch of me. It's constant and fair.\" \"How does an ally look t o you, don J uan? Those three people I saw, for instance, who looked like ordinary people to me; how would they look t o you? \" \"They would look l ike ordinary people.\" \"Then how can you t ell them apart from real people?\" \"Real people look l ike luminous eggs when you see them. Non-people always look l ike people. That's what I meant when I said you c annot see an ally . The allies take different forms. They look l ike dogs , coyotes, birds, even tumbleweeds, or anything else. The only difference is that when you see them they look j ust like what they're pretending to be. Everything ha s its own way of being when you see. Just like men look l ike eggs, other things look l ike something else, but the allies can be seen onl y in the form they are portraying. T hat form is good enough t o fool the eyes, our eyes, that is. A dog i s never fooled, neither is a crow.\" \"Why would they want to fool us?\" \"I think we are all clowns. We fool ourselves. The allies just take the outward appearance of whatever is around a nd then we take them for what they are not. It is not their fault that we have taught our eyes only to look at things.\" \"I'm not clear about their function, don J uan. What do allies do in the world?\" \"This is like asking m e what we men do i n the world. I really don' t know . We are here, that's all. And the 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"allies are here like us; and m aybe they have been here before us.\" \"What do you m ean before us, don J uan?\" \"We men have not always been here.\" \"Do you m ean here in this country or here in the world?\" We involved our selves in another long a rgument at this point Don Juan said that for him there was only the world, the place where he put his feet. I asked him how he knew that we had not always been in the world. \"Very simple,\" he said. \"We men know very little about the world. A coyote know s much more than we do. A coyote is hardly ever fooled by t he world's appearance.\" \"How come we can catch them and ki ll them?\" I asked. \"If they are not fooled by a ppearances how come they die so easily?\" Don Juan stared at me until I became embarrassed. \"We may trap or poison or shoot a coyote,\" he said. \"Any way we do it a coyote is an easy prey for us because he is not familiar with man's machinations. If the coyote survived, how ever, you c ould rest assured that we'd never catch up w ith him again. A good hunt er know s that and ne ver sets his trap twice on the same spot, because if a coyote dies in a trap, every coyote can see his death, which lingers on, a nd thus they will avoid the trap or even the general area where it was set. We, on t he other hand, ne ver see death, which lingers on the spot where one of our fellow men has died; we may suspect it, but we never see it.\" \"Can a coyote see an ally ?\" \"Certainly.\" \"How does an ally look t o a coyote?\" \"I would have to be a coyote to know that. I can tell you, how ever, that to a crow it looks like a pointed hat. Round a nd wide at the bottom, ending in a long poi nt. Some of them shine, but the majority are dull and appear to be very heavy. T hey resemble a dripping pi ece of cloth. They are foreboding shapes.\" \"How do they look t o you w hen you see them, don J uan?\" \"I've told you a lready; they look l ike whatever they're pretending to be. They take any shape or size that suits them. They could be shaped like a pebble or a mountain.\" \"Do they talk, or laugh, or make any noi se?\" \"In the company of men they behave like men. In the company of animals they behave like animals. Animals are usually afraid of them; however, if they are accustomed to seeing the allies, they leave them alone. We ourselves do something similar. We have scores of allies among us , but we don't bother them. Since our eyes can only look a t things, we don't notice them.\" \"Do you m ean that some of the people I see in the street are not really people?\" I asked, truly bewildered by his statement. \"Some of them are not,\" he said emphatically. His statement seemed preposterous to me, yet I could not seriously conceive of don J uan's making such a re- mark pur ely for effect I told him it sounde d like a science-fiction tale about beings from another planet. He said he did not care how it sounde d, but some people in the streets were not people. \"Why m ust you t hink that every person in a moving crowd is a hum an being?\" he asked with an air of utmost seriousness. I really could not explain why, except that I was habituated to believe that as an act of sheer faith on m y part. He went on to say how much he liked to watch bus y places with a lot of people, and how he would sometimes see a crowd of men who looked like eggs, and among t he mass of egg-like creatures he would spot one who looked just tike a person. \"It's very enjoyable to do t hat,\" he said, laughing, \"or at least it's enjoyable for me. I like to sit in parks and bus depots and watch. Sometimes I can spot an ally right away; at other times I can see only real people. Once I saw two allies sitting in a bus, side by side. That's the only time in my life I have seen two together.\" \"Did it have a special significance for you t o see two of them?\" \"Certainly. Anything they do i s significant. From their actions a brujo can sometimes draw his power. Even if 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"a brujo doe s not have an ally of his own, as long a s he know s how to see, he can handle power by w atching the acts of the allies. My benefactor taught me to do t hat, and for years before I had my own ally I watched for allies among c rowds of people and every time I saw one it taught me something. Y ou found t hree together. What a magnificent lesson you w asted.\" He did not say anything else until we finished assembling the rabbit trap. Then he turned to me and said sud- denly, as if he had just remembered it, that another important thing about the allies was that if one found t wo of them they were always two of the same kind. T he two allies he saw were two men, he said; and since I had seen two men and one woman he concluded that my experience was even more unus ual. I asked if the allies portray children; if the children could be of the same or of different sex; if the allies por- trayed people of different races; if they could por tray a family composed of a man, a woman, and a child; and finally I asked him if he had ever seen an ally driving a car or a bus. Don Juan did not answer at all. He smiled and let me do the talking. W hen he heard my last question he burst out laughing and said that I was being careless with my que stions, that it would have been more appropriate to ask if he had ever seen an ally driving a motor vehicle. \"You don' t want to forget the motorcycles, do you? \" he said with a mischievous glint in his eye. I thought his making fun of my que stion was funny a nd lighthearted and I laughed with him. Then he explained that the allies could not take the lead or act upon a nything di rectly; they could, how ever, act upon m an in an indirect way. Don Juan said that coming in contact with an ally was dangerous because the ally was capable of bringing out the worst in a person. T he apprenticeship was long a nd arduous , he said, because one had to reduce to a minimum all that was unnecessary in one 's life, in order to withstand the impact of such an encounter. Don Juan said that his benefactor, when he first came in contact with an ally , was driven to bur n himself and was scarred as if a mountain lion ha d mauled him. In his own case, he said, an ally pushed him into a pile of burning wood, a nd he burned himself a little on the knee and shoulder blade, but the scars disappeared in time, when he became one with the ally . 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"3 On June 10, 1968, I started on a long j ourney with don J uan to participate in a mitote. I had been waiting for this oppor tunity for months, yet I was not really sure I wanted to go. I thought my hesitation was due to my fear that at a peyote meeting I would have to ingest peyote, and I had no i ntention whatsoever of doing that. I had repeatedly expressed those feelings to don J uan. He laughed patiently at first, but finally he firmly stated that he did not want to hear one more thing about my fear. As far as I was concerned, a mitote was ideal ground f or me to verify the schemata I had constructed. For one thing, I had never completely abandone d the idea that a covert leader was necessary at such a meeting in order to insure agreement among t he participants. Somehow I had the feeling that don J uan had discarded my idea for reasons of his own, since he deemed it more efficacious to explain everything that took pl ace at a mitote in terms of \"seeing.\" I thought that my interest in finding a suitable explanation in my own terms was not in accordance with what he himself wanted me to do; therefore he had to discard my rationale, as he was accustomed to doi ng with whatever did not conform to his system. Right before we started on t he journey don J uan eased my apprehension about having to ingest peyote by telling m e that I was attending the meeting onl y to watch. I felt elated. At that tune I was almost certain I was going to discover the covert procedure by w hich the participants arrive at an agreement. It was late afternoon w hen we left; the sun was almost on the horizon; I felt it on m y neck and wished I had a Venetian blind in the rear window of my car. From the top of a hill I could see down into a huge valley; the road was like a black ribbon l aid flat over the ground, up a nd dow n innum erable hills. I followed it with my eyes for a moment before we began descending; it ran due south unt il it disappeared ove r a range of low mountains in the distance. Don Juan sat quietly, looking straight ahead. We had not said a word for a long t ime. It was uncomfortably warm inside the car. I had ope ned all the window s, but that did not help because it was an extremely hot day. I felt very annoye d and restless. I began to complain about the heat. Don Juan frowned and looked at me quizzically. \"It's hot all over Mexico this time of the year,\" he said. \"There is nothing one can do a bout it.\" I did not look a t him, but I knew he was gazing at me. The car picked up s peed goi ng dow n the slope. I vaguely saw a highway sign, Vado —dip. When I actually saw the dip I was going qui te fast, and although I did slow down, we still felt the impact and bobbe d up a nd dow n on t he seats. I reduced the speed considerably; we were going through a n area where livestock grazed freely on t he sides of the road, an area where the carcass of a horse or a cow run dow n by a car was a common sight. At a certain poi nt I had to stop completely and let some horses cross the highway. I was getting m ore restless and annoye d. I told don J uan that it was the heat; I said that I had always disliked the heat since my childhood, be cause every summer I used to feel suffocated and I could hardly breathe. \"You're not a child now ,\" he said. \"The heat still suffocates me.\" \"Well, hunge r used to suffocate me when I was a child,\" he said softly. \"To be very hungr y was the only thing I knew as a child, and I used to swell up unt il I could not breathe either. But that was when I was a child. I cannot suffocate now, neither can I swell like a toad when I am hungr y.\" I didn't know what to say. I felt I was getting m yself into an unt enable position and soon I would have to de- fend a point I really didn't care to defend. T he heat was not that bad. What disturbed me was the prospect of driving for over a thousand m iles to our destination. I felt annoye d at the thought of having to exert myself. \"Let's stop and ge t something to eat,\" I said. \"Maybe it won't be so hot once the sun goe s down.\" Don Juan looked at me, smiling, and said that there were not any clean towns for a long s tretch and that he had unde rstood m y pol icy was not to eat from the stands on the roadside. \"Don't you f ear diarrhea any m ore?\" he asked. I knew he was being sarcastic, yet he kept an inquisitive and at the same time serious look on hi s face. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"\"The way you a ct,\" he said, \"one would think that diarrhea is lurking out there, waiting for you t o step out of the car to jump you. Y ou're in a terrible fix; if you e scape the heat, diarrhea will eventually get you.\" Don Juan's tone was so serious that I began to laugh. T hen we drove in silence for a long t ime. When we arrived at a highway stop for trucks called Los Vidrios— Glass—it was already qui te dark. Don Juan shouted from the car, \"What do you ha ve to eat today?\" \"Pork meat,\" a woman shouted back from inside. \"I hope for your sake that the pig was run dow n on t he road today,\" don J uan said to me, laughing. We got out of the car. The road was flanked on bot h sides by ranges of low mountains that seemed to be the solidified lava of some gigantic volcanic eruption. In the darkness the black, jagged peaks were silhouetted against the sky like huge menacing walls of glass slivers. While we ate I told don J uan that I could see the reason why the place was called Glass. I said that to me the name was obvi ously due to the glass-sliver shape of the mountains. Don Juan said in a convincing tone that the place was called Los Vidrios because a truck loaded with glass had ove rturned on t hat spot and the glass shreds were left lying around t he road for years. I felt he was being facetious and asked him to tell me if that was the real reason. \"Why don' t you a sk someone here?\" he said. I asked a man who was sitting at a table next to our s; he said apologetically that he didn't know . I went into the kitchen and asked the women there if they kne w, but they all said they didn't; that the place was just called Glass. \"I believe I'm right,\" don J uan said in a low voice. \"Mexicans are not given to not icing things around t hem. I'm sure they can't see the glass mountains, but they surely can leave a mountain of glass shreds lying around f or years.\" We both found t he image funny a nd laughed. When we had finished eating don J uan asked me how I felt. I told him fine, but I really felt somewhat queasy. Don Juan gave me a steadfast look a nd seemed to detect my feeling of discomfort. \"Once you de cided to come to Mexico you s hould have put all your petty fears away,\" he said very sternly. \"Your decision to come should have vanquished them. You came because you w anted to come. That's the warrior's way. I have told you t ime and time again, the most effective way to live is as a warrior. Worry and think before you m ake any de cision, but once you m ake it, be on your way free from worries or thought s; there will be a million ot her decisions still awaiting you. T hat's the warrior's way.\" \"I believe I do that, don J uan, at least some of the time. It's very hard to keep on r eminding m yself, though.\" \"A warrior thinks of his death when things become unclear.\" \"That's even harder, don J uan. For most people death is very vague and remote. We never think of it.\" \"Why not ?\" \"Why should we?\" \"Very simple,\" he said. \"Because the idea of death is the only thing that tempers our spirit.\" By the time we left Los Vidrios it was so dark that the jagged silhouette of the mountains had emerged into the darkness of the sky. W e drove in silence for more than an hour . I felt tired. It was as though I didn't want to talk because there was nothing to talk about. The traffic was minimal. Few cars passed by f rom the oppos ite direction. It seemed as if we were the only people going south on t he highway. I thought that was strange and I kept on looking in the rear-view mirror to see if there were other cars coming from behind, but there were none . After a while I stopped looking for cars and be gan to dwell again on t he prospect of our trip. Then I noticed that my headlights seemed extremely bright in contrast with the darkness all around a nd I looked again in the rear-view mirror. I saw a bright glare first and then two poi nts of light that seemed to have emerged from the ground. T hey were the headlights of a car on a hilltop in the distance behind us . They remained visible for a while, then they disappeared into the darkness as if they had been scooped away; after a moment they appeared on another hilltop, and then they disappeared again. I followed their appearances and di sappearances in the mirror for a long t ime. At one point it occurred to me that the car was gaining on us . It was definitely closing in. 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The lights were bigger and br ighter. I deliberately stepped on t he gas pedal. I had a sensation of uneasiness. Don Juan seemed to not ice my concern, or perhaps he was only not icing that I was speeding up. H e looked at me first, then he turned around a nd looked at the distant headlights. He asked me if there was something wrong w ith me. I told him that I had not seen any cars behind us for hours and that suddenly I had not iced the lights of a car that seemed to be gaining on us all the time. He chuckled and asked me if I really thought it was a car. I told him that it had to be a car and he said that my concern revealed to him that, somehow, I must have felt that whatever was behind us was something m ore than a mere car. I insisted that I thought it was just another car on the highway, or perhaps a truck. \"What else can it be?\" I said loudly. Don Juan's probing ha d put me on edge. He turned and looked straight at me, then he nodde d slowly, as if measuring what he was going to say. \"Those are the lights on the head of death,\" he said softly. \"Death put s them on like a hat and then shoots off on a gallop. T hose are the lights of death on t he gallop ga ining on us , getting closer and closer.\" A chill ran up m y back. After a while I looked in the rear-view mirror again, but the lights were not there any more. I told don J uan that the car must have stopped or turned off the road. He did not look ba ck; he just stretched his arms and ya wned. \"No,\" he said. \"Death never stops. Sometimes it turns off its lights, that's all.\" We arrived in nor theastern Mexico June 13. T wo old Indian women, who looked alike and seemed to be sisters, and four girls were gathered at the door of a small adobe hous e. There was a hut behind the hous e and a dilapidated barn that had onl y part of its roof and one wall left. The women were apparently waiting for us; they must have spotted my car by the dust it raised on t he dirt road after I left the paved highway a couple of miles away. The hous e was in a deep valley, and vi ewed from the door the highway looked like a long s car high up on the side of the green hills. Don Juan got out of the car and talked with the old women for a moment. They poi nted to some wooden stools in front of the door . Don Juan signaled me to come over and sit down. One of the old women sat with us; the rest went inside the hous e. Two of the girls remained by t he door , examining m e with curiosity. I waved at them; they giggled and ran inside. After a few minutes two young m en came over and gr eeted don J uan. They did not speak to me or even look a t me. They talked to don J uan briefly; then he got up and all of us, including the women, Walked to another hous e, perhaps half a mile away. We met there with another group of people. Don Juan went inside but told me to stay by t he door . I looked in and saw an old Indian man around don J uan's age sitting on a wooden stool. It was not quite dark. A group of young I ndian men and women were standing qui etly around a n old truck parked in front of the hous e. I talked to them in Spanish but they deliberately avoided answering m e; the women giggled every time I said something and the men smiled pol itely and turned their eyes away. It was as if they did not unde rstand m e, yet I was sure all of them spoke Spanish because I had heard them talking among t hemselves. After a while don J uan and the other old man came out and got into the truck and sat next to the driver. That appeared to be a signal for everyone to climb ont o the flatbed of the truck. There were no side railings, and when the truck began to move we all hung ont o a long r ope that was tied to some hooks on the chassis. The truck moved slowly on t he dirt road. At one point, on a very steep slope, it stopped and everybody jumped dow n and walked behind it; then two young m en hoppe d ont o the flatbed again and sat on the edge without using the rope. The women laughed and encouraged them to maintain their precarious position. D on Juan and the old man, who was referred to as don S ilvio, walked together and di d not seem to be concerned with the young m en's histrionics. When the road leveled off everybody got on the track again. We rode for about an hour . The floor was extremely hard and unc omfortable, so I stood up a nd he ld ont o the roof of the cab and rode that way unt il we stopped in front of a group of shacks. There were more people there; it was very dark by t hen and I could see only a few of them in the dim, yellowish light of a kerosene lantern that hung by a n ope n door . 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Everybody got off the truck and m ingled with the people in the hous es. Don Juan told me again to stay outside. I leaned against the front fender of the truck and after a minute or two I was joined by t hree young m en. I had met one of them four years before at a previous mitote. He embraced me by gr abbing m y forearms. \"You're fine,\" he whispered to me in Spanish. We stayed very qui etly by t he truck. It was a warm, windy ni ght. I could hear the soft rumble of a stream close by. M y friend asked me in a whisper if I had any cigarettes. I passed a pack around. B y the glow of the cig- arettes I looked at my watch. It was nine o'clock. A group of people emerged from inside the hous e soon a fterwards and the three young m en walked away. Don Juan came over to me and told me that he had explained my presence to everybody' s satisfaction and that I was welcome to come and serve water at the mitote. He said we would be going right away. A group of ten women and eleven men left the hous e. The man heading the party was rather husky; he was per-haps in his mid-fifties. They called him \"Mocho,\" a nickname which means \"cropped.\" He moved with brisk, firm steps. He carried a kerosene lantern and waved it from side to side as he walked. At first I thought he was moving it at random , but then I discovered that he waved the lantern to mark an obs tacle or a difficult pass on the road. We walked for over an hour . The women chatted and laughed softly from time to time. Don Juan and the other old man were at the head of the line; I was at the very tail end of it. I kept my eyes down on t he road, trying to see where I was walking. It had been four years since don J uan and I had been in the hills at night, and I had lost a great deal of physical prowess. I kept stumbling and involuntarily kicking small rocks. My kne es did not have any flexibility; the road seemed to come up at me when I encountered a high spot, or it seemed to give in unde r me when I hit a low spot. I was the noisiest walker and that made me into an unw illing clown. Someone in the group s aid, \"Woo,\" every time I stumbled and everyone laughed. At one point, one of the rocks I kicked hit a woman's heel and she said out loud, t o everyone's delight, \"Give a candle to that poor boy! \" But the final mortification was when I tripped and ha d to hol d ont o the person in front of me; he nearly lost his balance with my weight on hi m and let out a deliberate scream that was out of all proportion. E veryone laughed so hard that the whole group ha d to stop for a while. At a certain moment the man who was leading jerked his lantern up a nd dow n. It seemed that was the sign we had arrived at our destination. T here was a dark silhouette of a low hous e to my right, a short distance away. Everyone in the group s crambled in different directions. I looked for don J uan. It was difficult to find hi m in the darkness. I stumbled noi sily for a while before noticing that he was sitting on a rock. He again told me that my dut y was to bring water for the men who were going to participate. He had taught me the procedure years before. I remembered every detail of it but he insisted on r efreshing m y memory and showed me again how to do i t. Afterwards we walked to the back of the hous e where all the men had gathered. They had bui lt a fire. There was a cleared area covered with straw mats perhaps fifteen feet away from the fire. Mocho, the man who ha d led us, sat on a mat first; I noticed that the uppe r edge of his left ear was missing, w hich accounted for his nickname. Don Silvio sat to his right and don J uan to his left. Mocho was sitting facing the fire. A young m an advanced toward him and pl aced a flat basket with peyote buttons in front of him; then the young m an sat down between Mocho and don S ilvio. Another young m an carried two small baskets and pl aced them next to the peyote buttons and then sat between Mocho and don J uan. Then two other young m en flanked don S ilvio and don J uan, closing a circle of seven persons. The women remained inside the hous e. Two young m en were in charge of keeping the fire burning all night, and one teenager and I kept the water that was going to be given to the seven participants after their all-night ritual. The boy a nd I sat by a rock. The fire and the receptacle with water were oppos ite each other and at an equal distance from the circle of participants. Mocho, the headman, sang hi s peyote song; his eyes were closed; his body bobbe d up a nd dow n. It was a very long s ong. I did not unde rstand the language. Then all of them, one by one , sang their peyote songs. They did not seem to follow any pr econceived order. They apparently sang whenever they felt like doing it. Then Mocho he ld the basket with peyote buttons, took t wo of them, and pl aced it back again in the center of the circle; 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"don S ilvio was nest and then don J uan. The four young m en, who seemed to be a separate unit, took t wo peyote buttons each, following a counter-clockwise direction. Each of the seven participants sang and ate two peyote buttons four consecutive times, then they passed the other two baskets, which contained dried fruit and m eat. They repeated this cycle at various times during the night, yet I could not detect any unde rlying or der to their individual movements. They did not speak to one another; they seemed rather to be by themselves and to themselves. I did not see any of them, not even onc e, paying attention to what the other men were doing. Before daybreak they got up and the young m an and I gave them water. Afterwards I walked around t o orient myself. The hous e was a one-room shack, a low adobe construction with a thatched roof. The scenery that sur- rounde d it was quite oppr essive. The shack was located in a harsh plain with mixed vegetation. S hrubs and cacti grew together, but there were no trees at all. I did not feel like venturing be yond t he hous e. The women left during the morning. T he men moved silently in the area immediately surroundi ng the hous e. Around m idday all of us sat down again in the same order we had sat the night before. A basket with pieces of dried meat cut to the same size as a peyote button was passed around. S ome of the men sang their peyote songs. After an hour or so all of them stood up a nd went off in different directions. The women had left a pot of gruel for the fire and water attendants. I ate some of it and then I slept most of the afternoon. After dark the young m en in charge of the fire built another one and the cycle of intaking pe yote buttons began again. It followed roughl y the same order as the preceding ni ght, ending at daybreak. During the course of the night I struggled to obs erve and record every single movement performed by e ach of the seven participants, in hope s of discovering the slightest form of a detectable system of verbal or nonve rbal communication among t hem. There was nothing in their actions, how ever, that revealed an unde rlying system. In the early evening the cycle of intaking pe yote was renewed. By morning I knew that I had completely failed to find clues that would poi nt out the covert leader, or to discover any form of covert communication among t hem or any traces of their system of agreement. For the rest of the day I sat by m yself and tried to arrange my not es. When the men gathered again for the fourth night I knew somehow that this was to be the last meeting. N o- body ha d mentioned anything about it to me, yet I knew they would disband the next day. I sat by the water again and everyone else resumed his position in the order that had already be en established. The behavior of the seven men in the circle was a replica of what I had obs erved dur ing the three previous nights. I became absorbed in their movements as I had done before. I wanted to record everything they did, every movement, every utterance, every gesture. At a certain moment I heard a sort of beep in my ear; it was a common sort of buzzing in the ear and I did not pay attention to it. The beep became louder, yet it was still within the range of my ordinary bodi ly sensations. I remembered dividing m y attention be tween watching the men and listening to the buzzing I was hearing. T hen, at a given instant, the faces of the men seemed to become brighter; it was as if a light had been turned on. B ut it was not quite like an electric light, or a lantern, or the reflection of the fire on their faces. It was rather an iridescence; a pink luminosity, very tenuous , yet detectable from where I was. The buzzing seemed to increase. I looked at the teenage boy w ho was with me but he had fallen asleep. The pink luminosity became more noticeable by then. I looked at don J uan; his eyes were closed; so were don S ilvio's and so were Mocho's. I could not see the eyes of the four younge r men because two of them were bent forward and the other two had their backs turned to me. I became even more involved in watching. Y et I had not fully realized that I was actually hearing a buzzing and was actually seeing a pinkish glow hove ring ove r the men. After a moment I became aware that the tenuous pink light and the buzzing were very steady, I had a moment of intense bewilderment and then a thought crossed my mind, a thought that had not hing to do w ith the scene I was witnessing, nor with the purpose I had in mind for being there. I remembered something m y mother had told me once when I was a child. The thought was distracting and ve ry inappropriate; I tried to discard it and involve myself again in my assiduous watching, but I 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"could not do it. The thought recurred; it was stronger, more demanding, and then I clearly heard my mother's voice calling m e. I heard the shuffling of her slippers and then her laughter. I turned around l ooking for her; I conceived that I was going to be transported in time by some sort of hallucination or mirage and I was going to see her, but I saw only the boy s leeping be side me. To see him jolted me and I experienced a brief moment of ease, of sobriety. I looked again at the group of men. They had not changed their positions at all. However, the luminosity was gone, and so was the buzzing in my ears. I felt relieved. I thought that the hallucination of hearing m y mother's voice was over. Her voice had been so clear and vi vid. I said to myself over and ove r that for an instant the voice had almost trapped me. I noticed vaguely that don J uan was looking at me, but that did not matter. It was the memory of my mother's voice calling m e that was mesmerizing. I struggled desperately to think about something else. And then I heard her voice again, as clearly as if she had been behind m e. She called my name. I turned quickly, but all I saw was the dark silhouette of the shack and the shrubs beyond i t. Hearing m y name caused me the most profound a nguish. I whined involuntarily. I felt cold and ve ry lonely and I began to weep. At that moment I had the sensation that I needed someone to care for me. I turned my head to look a t don J uan; he was staring at me. I did not want to see him so I closed my eyes. And then I saw my mother. It was not the thought of my mother, the way I think of her ordinarily. This was a clear vision of her, standing by m e. I felt desperate. I was trembling and wanted to escape. The vision of my mother was too disturbing, too alien to what I was pursuing in that peyote meeting. T here was apparently no c onscious way to avoid it. Perhaps I could have opened my eyes if I really wanted the vision to vanish, but instead I examined it in detail. My examination was more than merely looking at her; it was a compulsive scrutiny and assessment. A very peculiar feeling enveloped me as if it were an out side force, and I suddenly felt the horrendous burden of my mother's love. When I heard my name I was torn apart; the memory of my mother filled me with anguish and melancholy, but when I examined her I knew that I had never liked her. This was a shocking realization. Thought s and images came to me as an avalanche. The vision of my mother must have vanished in the meantime; it was no longer important. I was no longer interested in what the Indians were doing either. In fact I had forgotten the mitote. I was absorbed in a series of extraordinary thought s, extraordinary because they were more than thought s; these were complete units of feeling that were emotional certainties, indisputable evidences about the nature of my relationship with my mother. At a certain moment these extraordinary thought s ceased to come. I noticed that they had lost their fluidity and their quality of being complete units of feeling. I had begun t o think about other things. My mind was rambling. I thought of other members of my immediate family, but there were no images to accompany m y thought s. Then I looked at don J uan. He was standing; the rest of the men were also standing, and then they all walked toward the water. I moved aside and nudge d the boy w ho was still asleep. I related to don J uan the sequence of my astoundi ng vi sion almost as soon a s he got into my car. He laughed with great delight and said that my vision was a sign, an om en as important as my first experience with Mescalito. I remembered that don J uan had interpreted the reactions I had when I first ingested peyote as an all- important omen; in fact he decided to teach me his know ledge because of it. Don Juan said that during the last night of the mitote Mescalito had hove red ove r me so obvi ously that everyone was forced to turn toward me, and that was why he was staring at me when I looked at him. I wanted to hear his interpretation of my vision, but he did not want to talk about it. He said that whatever I had experienced was nons ense in comparison to the omen. Don Juan kept on talking about Mescalito's light hove ring ove r me and how everyone had seen it. \"That was really something,\" he said. \"I couldn't possibly ask for a better omen.\" Don Juan and I were obvi ously on t wo different avenues of thought . He was concerned with the importance of the events he had interpreted as an om en and I was obsessed with the details of the vision I had had. \"I don't care about omens,\" I said. \"I want to know what happened to me.\" He frowned as if he were upset and remained very stiff and qui et for a moment. Then he looked at me. His 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"tone was very forceful. He said that the only important issue was that Mescalito had been very gentle with me, had engulfed me with his light and ha d given me a lesson with no ot her effort on m y part than being around. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"4 On September 4, 1968, I went to Sonora to visit don J uan. Following a request he had made during m y pre- vious visit to him, I stopped on t he way, in Hermosillo, to buy hi m a nonc ommercial tequila called bacanora. His request seemed very odd t o me at the time, since I knew he disliked drinking, but I bought four bottles and put them in a box a long w ith other things I had brought for him. \"Why, you got four bottles!\" he said, laughing, w hen he opened the box. \" I asked you t o buy m e one. I believe you t hought the bacanora was for me, but it's for my grandson Lucio, and you ha ve to give it to him as though i t's a personal gift of your own.\" I had met don J uan's grandson two years before; he was twenty-eight years old then. He was very tall, over six feet, and was always extravagantly well dressed for his means and in comparison to his peers. While the majority of Yaquis wear khakis and Levis, straw hats, and hom emade sandals called guaraches, Lucio's outfit was an expensive black leather jacket with frills of turquoise beads, a Texan cowboy ha t, and a pair of boot s that were monogr ammed and ha nd de corated. Lucio was delighted to receive the liquor and immediately took t he bottles inside his hous e, apparently to put them away. Don Juan made a casual comment that one should never hoard liquor and dr ink alone. Lucio said he was not really hoa rding, but was putting it away unt il that evening, at which time he was going to invite his friends to drink with him. That evening around s even o'clock I returned to Lucio's place. It was dark. I made out the vague silhouette of two people standing unde r a small tree; it was Lucio and one of his friends, who were waiting for me and gui ded me to the hous e with a flashlight. Lucio's hous e was a flimsy, two-room, dirt-floor, wattle-and-daub construction. It was perhaps twenty feet long a nd suppor ted by r elatively thin beams of the mesquite tree. It had, as all the hous es of the Yaquis have, a flat, thatched roof and a nine-foot-wide ramada, which is a sort of awning ove r the entire front part of the hous e. A ramada roof is never thatched; it is made of branches arranged in a loose fashion, gi ving enough s hade and ye t permitting the cooling br eeze to circulate freely. As I entered the hous e I turned on m y tope recorder, which I kept inside my brief case. Lucio introduced me to his friends. There were eight men inside the hous e, including don J uan. They were sitting casually around t he center of the room unde r the bright light of a gasoline lantern that hung f rom a beam, Don Juan was sitting on a box. I sat facing hi m at the end of a six-foot bench made with a thick wooden beam nailed on t wo prongs planted in the ground. Don Juan had placed his hat on the floor beside him. The light of the gasoline lantern made his short white hair look m ore brilliantly white. I looked at his face; the light had also enhanced the deep wrinkles on hi s neck and forehead, and m ade him look da rker and ol der. I looked at the other men; unde r the greenish-white light of the gasoline lantern all of them looked tired and old. Lucio addressed the whole group i n Spanish and said in a loud voi ce that we were going to drink one bottle of bacanora that I had brought for him from Hermosillo. He went into the other room, brought out a bottle, uncorked it, and ga ve it to me along w ith a small tin cup. I pour ed a very small amount into the cup and dr ank it. The bacanora seemed to be more fragrant and m ore dense than regular tequila, and stronger too. It made me cough. I passed the bottle and everyone pour ed himself a small drink, everyone except don J uan; he just took t he bottle and pl aced it in front of Lucio, who was at the end of the line. All of them made lively comments about the rich flavor of that particular bottle, and all of them agreed that the liquor must have come from the high m ountains of Chihuahua. The bottle went around a second t ime. The men smacked their lips, repeated their statements of praise, and engaged themselves in a lively discussion about the noticeable differences between the tequila made around G ua- dalajara and that made at a high altitude in Chihuahua. During the second t ime around don J uan again did not drink and I pour ed onl y a dab for myself, but the rest 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"of them filled the cup to the brim. The bottle went around onc e more and was finished. \"Get the other bottles, Lucio,\" don J uan said. Lucio seemed to vacillate, and don J uan qui te casualty explained to the others that I had brought four bottles for Lucio. Benigno, a young m an of Lucio's age, looked at the brief case that I had placed inconspicuously behind m e and asked if I was a tequila salesman. Don Juan answered that I was not, and that I had really come to Sonora to see him. \"Carlos is learning about Mescalito, and I'm teaching hi m,\" don J uan said. All of them looked at me and smiled pol itely. Bajea, the woodcutter, a small, thin man with sharp features, looked at me fixedly for a moment and then said that the storekeeper had accused me of being a spy from an American company that was planning to do m ining in the Yaqui land. T hey all reacted as if they were indignant at such an accusation. B esides, they all resented the storekeeper, who was a Mexican, or a Yori as the Yaquis say. Lucio went into the other room and returned with another bottle of bacanora. He opened it, pour ed himself a large drink, and then passed it around. T he conversation dr ifted to the probabilities of the American company coming to Sonora and its possible effect on the Yaquis. The bottle went back to Lucio. He lifted it and looked at its contents to see how much was left. \"Tell him not to worry,\" don J uan whispered to me. \"Tell him you'll bring hi m more next time you c ome around.\" I leaned ove r to Lucio and assured him that on m y next visit I was going to bring hi m at least half a dozen bottles. At one moment the topics of conversation seemed to wane away. Don Juan turned to me and said loudly, \"Why don' t you t ell the guys here about your encounters with Mesca- lito? I think that'll be much more interesting than this idle chat about what will happen if the American company comes to Sonora.\" \"Is Mescalito peyote, Grandpa?\" Lucio asked curiously. \"Some people call it that way,\" don J uan said dryly. \"I prefer to call it Mescalito.\" \"That confounde d thing causes madness,\" said Genaro, a tall, husky, m iddle-aged man. \"I think it's stupid to say that Mescalito causes madness,\" don J uan said softly. \"Because if that were the case, Carlos would be in a strait-jacket this very moment instead of being he re talking to you. H e has taken it and look at him. He is fine.\" Bajea smiled and replied shyly, \"Who can tell?\" and everybody l aughed. \"Look a t me then,\" don J uan said. \"I've know n Mescalito nearly all my life and it has never hurt me.\" The men did not laugh, but it was obvi ous that they were not taking hi m seriously. \"On the other hand,\" don J uan went on, \" it's true that Mescalito drives people crazy, as you s aid, but that's only when they come to him without know ing what they're doing.\" Esquere, an old man who seemed to be don J uan's age, chuckled softly as he shook hi s head from side to side. \"What do you m ean by ' know ing,' Juan?\" he asked. \"The last time I saw you, you w ere saying the same thing.\" \"People go really crazy when they take that peyote stuff,\" Genaro continued. \"I've seen the Huichol Indians eating it. They acted as if they had rabies. They frothed and puke d and pi ssed all over the place. You could get epilepsy from taking that confounde d thing. T hat's what Mr. Salas, the gove rnment engineer, told me once. And epilepsy is for life, you know .\" \"That's being worse than animals,\" Bajea added solemnly. \"You saw only what you w anted to see about the Huichol Indians, Genaro,\" don J uan said. \"For one thing, you ne ver took t he trouble of finding out from them what it's like to get acquainted with Mescalito. Mescalito has never made anyone epileptic, to my know ledge. The government engineer is a Yori and I doubt that a Yori know s anything about it. You really don' t think that all the thousands of people who know Mescalito are crazy, 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"do you? \" \"They must be crazy, or pretty nearly so, to do a thing like that,\" answered Genaro. \"But if all those thousands of people were crazy at the same time who would do t heir work? How would they manage to survive?\" don J uan asked. \"Macario, who comes from the 'other side'\"—the U.S.A.—\"told me that whoever takes it there is marked for life,\" Esquere said. \"Macario is lying if he says that,\" don J uan said. \"I'm sure he doesn't know what he's talking about.\" \"He really tells too m any lies,\" said Benigno. \"Who's Macario?\" I asked. \"He's a Yaqui Indian who lives here,\" Lucio said. \"He says he's from Arizona and that he was in Europe during the war. He tells all kinds of stories.\" \"He says he was a colonel!\" Benigno s aid. Everyone laughed and the conversation shifted for a while to Macario's unbe lievable tales, but don J uan re- turned again to the topic of Mescalito. \"If all of you know that Macario is a liar, how can you be lieve him when he talks about Mescalito?\" \"Do you m ean peyote, Grandpa?\" Lucio asked, as if he were really struggling to make sense out of the term. \"God da mn it! Yes!\" Don Juan's tone was sharp and abrupt. Lucio recoiled involuntarily, and for a moment I felt they were all afraid. Then don J uan smiled broadly and continued in a mild tone. \"Don't you f ellows see that Macario doe sn't know what he's talking about? Don't you s ee that in order to talk about Mescalito one has to know ?\" \"There you go a gain,\" Esquere said. \"What the hell is this know ledge? You are worse than Macario. At least he says what's on hi s mind, w hether he know s it or not. For years I've been listening to you s ay we have to know . What do w e have to know ?\" \"Don Juan says there is a spirit in peyote,\" Benigno s aid. \"I have seen peyote in the field, but I have never seen spirits or anything of the sort,\" Bajea added. \"Mescalito is like a spirit, perhaps,\" don J uan explained. \"But whatever he is doesn't become clear until one know s about him. Esquere complains that I have been saying this for years. Well, I have. But it's not my fault that you don' t unde rstand. B ajea says that whoever takes it becomes like an animal. Well, I don't see it that way. To me those who think they are above animals live worse than animals. Look a t my grandson he re. He works without rest. I would say he lives to work, like a mule. And all he does that is not animal-like is to get drunk.\" Everybody l aughed, Victor, a very young m an who seemed to be still in adolescence, laughed in a pitch above everybody e lse. Eligio, a young f armer, had not uttered a single word so far. He was sitting on t he floor to my right, with his back against some sacks of chemical fertilizer that had been piled inside the hous e to protect them from the rain. He was one of Lucio's childhood f riends, pow erful looking and, although s horter than Lucio, more stocky and better built. Eligio seemed concerned about don J uan's words. Bajea was trying to come back with a comment, but Eligio interrupted him. \"In what way would peyote change all this?\" he asked. \"It seems to me that a man is born to work all his life, like mules do.\" \"Mescalito changes everything,\" don J uan said, \"yet we still have to work like everybody e lse, like mules. I said there was a spirit inside Mescalito because it is something like a spirit which brings about the change in men. A spirit we can see and can touch, a spirit that changes us, sometimes even against our will.\" \"Peyote drives you out of your mind,\" Genaro said, \"and then of course you be lieve you've changed. True?\" \"How can it change us?\" Eligio insisted. \"He teaches us the right way to live,\" don J uan said. \"He helps and pr otects those who know him. The life you f ellows are leading is no life at all. You don' t know the happiness that comes from doing things deliberately. You don' t have a protector!\" 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"\"What do you m ean?\" Genaro said indignantly. \"We certainly have. Our Lord Jesus Christ, and our Mother the Virgin, and the little Virgin of Guadalupe. Aren't they our protectors?\" \"Fine bunc h of protectors!\" don J uan said mockingly. \"Have they taught you a better way to live?\" \"That's because people don't listen to them,\" Genaro protested, \"and they onl y pay attention to the devil.\" \"If they were real protectors they would force you t o listen,\" don J uan said. \"If Mescalito becomes your pro- tector you w ill have to listen whether you I ike it or not, because you c an see him and you m ust take heed of what he says. He will make you a pproach him with respect. Not the way you f ellows are accustomed to approach your protectors.\" \"What do you m ean, Juan?\" Esquere asked. \"What I mean is that for you t o come to your protectors means that one of you ha s to play a fiddle, and a dancer has to put on hi s mask and leggings and rattles and da nce, while the rest of you dr ink. Y ou, B enigno, you were a dancer once, tell us about it.\" \"I gave it up after three years,\" Benigno s aid. \"It's hard work.\" \"Ask Lucio,\" Esquere said satirically. \"He gave it up in one week!\" Everybody l aughed except don J uan. Lucio smiled, seemingly embarrassed, and gul ped dow n two huge swal- lows of bacanora. \"It is not hard, it is stupid,\" don J uan said. \"Ask Valencio, the dancer, if he enjoys dancing. H e does not! He got accustomed to it, that's all. I've seen him dance for years, and every time I have, I've seen the same move- ments badly executed. He takes no pr ide in his art except when he talks about it. He has no love for it, therefore year after year he repeats the same motions. What was bad about his dancing at the beginning ha s become fixed. He cannot see it any longer.\" \"He was taught to dance that way,\" Eligio said. \"I was also a dancer in the town of Torim. I know you m ust dance the way they teach you.\" \"Valencio is not the best dancer anyway,\" Esquere said. \"There are others. How about Sacateca?\" \"Sacateca is a man of know ledge, he is not in the same class with you f ellows,\" don J uan said sternly. \"He dances because that's the bent of his nature. All I wanted to say was that you, w ho are not dancers, do not enjoy it. Perhaps if the dances are well performed some of you w ill get pleasure. Not many of you know that much about dancing, though; therefore you a re left with a very lousy piece of joy. T his is why you f ellows are all drunkards. Look a t my grandson he re!\" \"Cut it out, Grandpa!\" Lucio protested. \"He's not lazy or stupid,\" don J uan went on, \" but what else does he do be sides drink?\" \"He buys leather jackets!\" Genaro remarked, and the whole audience roared. Lucio gul ped dow n more bacanora. \"And how is peyote going to change that?\" Eligio asked. \"If Lucio would seek the protector,\" don J uan said, \"his life would be changed. I don't know exactly how , but I am sure it would be different.\" \"He would stop dr inking, is that what you m ean?\" Eligio insisted. \"Perhaps he would. He needs something else besides tequila to make his life satisfying. A nd that something, whatever it may be, might be provided by t he protector.\" \"Then peyote must taste very good,\" Eligio said. \"I didn't say that,\" don J uan said. \"How in the hell are you goi ng to enjoy it if it doesn't taste good? \" Eligio said. \"It makes one enjoy life better,\" don J uan said. \"But if it doesn't taste good, how could it make us enjoy our lives better?\" Eligio persisted. \"It doesn't make sense,\" \"Of course it makes sense,\" Genaro said with conviction. \"Peyote makes you c razy and na turally you t hink you're having a great time with your life, no m atter what you do.\" They all laughed again. \"It does make sense,\" don J uan proceeded, undi sturbed, \"if you t hink how little we know and how much 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"there is to see. Booze is what makes people crazy. It blurs the images. Mescalito, on t he other hand, sharpens everything. It makes you s ee so very well. So very well!\" Lucio and Benigno l ooked at each other and smiled as though t hey had already he ard the story before. Genaro and Esquere grew more impatient and be gan to talk at the same time. Victor laughed above all the other voices. The only one interested seemed to be Eligio. \"How can peyote do all that?\" he asked. \"In the first place,\" don J uan explained, \"you m ust want to become acquainted with him, and I think this is by far the most important thing. T hen you m ust be offered to him, and you m ust meet with him many times before you c an say you know him.\" \"And what happens then?\" Eligio asked. Genaro interrupted. \"You crap on t he roof with your ass on the ground.\" The audience roared. \"What happens next is entirely up t o you,\" don J uan went on w ithout losing hi s self-control. \"You m ust come to him without fear and, little by little, he will teach you how to live a better life.\" There was a long pa use. The men seemed to be tired. The bottle was empty. Lucio, with obvi ous reluctance, opened another. \"Is peyote Carlos' protector too?\" Eligio asked in a joking tone. \"I wouldn't know that,\" don J uan said. \"He has taken it three times, so ask him to tell you a bout it.\" They all turned to me curiously and Eligio asked, \"Did you r eally take it?\" \"Yes. I did.\" It seemed don J uan had won a round w ith his audience. They were either interested in hearing about my experience or too pol ite to laugh i n my face. \"Didn't it hurt your mouth?\" Lucio asked. \"It did. It also tasted terrible.\" \"Why di d you t ake it, then?\" Benigno a sked. I began to explain to them in elaborate terms that for a Western man don J uan's know ledge about peyote was one of the most fascinating things one could find. I said that everything he had said about it was true and that each one of us could verify that truth for ourselves. I noticed that all of them were smiling as if they were concealing their contempt. I grew very embarrassed. I was aware of my awkwardness in conveying what I really had in mind. I talked for a while longer, but I had lost the impetus and onl y repeated what don J uan had already said. Don Juan came to my aid and asked in a reassuring tone, \"You were not looking for a protector when you first came to Mescalito, were you? \" I told them that I did not know that Mescalito could be a protector, and that I was moved onl y by m y curiosity and a great desire to know him. Don Juan reaffirmed that my intentions had been faultless and said that because of it Mescalito had had a beneficial effect on m e. \"But it made you puke and pi ss all over the place, didn't it?\" Genaro insisted. I told him that it had in fact affected me in such a manner. They all laughed with restraint. I felt that they had become even more contemptuous of me. They didn't seem to be interested, except for Eligio, who was gazing at me. \"What did you s ee?\" he asked. Don Juan urged me to recount for them all or nearly all the salient details of my experiences, so I described the sequence and the form of what I had perceived. When I finished talking Lucio made a comment. \"If peyote is that weird, I'm glad I've never taken it.\" \"It is just like I said,\" Genaro said to Bajea. \"That thing m akes you i nsane.\" \"But Carlos is not insane now. How do you a ccount for that?\" don J uan asked Genaro. \"How do w e know he isn't?\" Genaro retorted. 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"They all broke out laughing, including don J uan. \"Were you a fraid?\" Benigno a sked. \"I certainly was.\" \"Why di d you do i t, then?\" Eligio asked. \"He said he wanted to know ,\" Lucio answered for me. \"I think Carlos is getting to be like my grandpa. Both have been saying they want to know , but nobody know s what in the hell they want to know .\" \"It is impossible to explain that know ing,\" don J uan said to Eligio, \"because it is different for every man. The only thing which is common to all of us is that Mescalito reveals his secrets privately to each man. Being aware of how Genaro feels, I don't recommend that he meet Mescalito. Yet in spite of my words or his feelings, Mescalito could have a totally beneficial effect on hi m. But only he could find out , and that is the know ing I have been talking about.\" Don Juan got up. \" It's time to go hom e,\" he said. \"Lucio is drunk a nd Victor is asleep.\" Two days later, on S eptember 6, Lucio, Benigno, a nd Eligio came over to the hous e where I was staying to go hunt ing with me. They remained silent for a while as I kept on w riting m y not es. Then Benigno l aughed politely as a warning that he was going to say something important. After a preliminary embarrassing silence he laughed again and said, \"Lucio here says that he would take peyote.\" \"Would you r eally?\" I asked. \"Yes. I wouldn't mind it.\" Benigno's laughter came in spurts. \"Lucio says he will eat peyote if you buy hi m a motorcycle.\" Lucio and Benigno l ooked at each other and br oke out laughing. \"How much is a motorcycle in the United States?\" Lucio asked. \"You could probably get one for a hundr ed dol lars,\" I said. \"That isn't very much there, is it? You could easily get it for him, couldn't you? \" Benigno a sked. \"Well, let me ask your grandpa first,\" I said to Lucio. \"No, no,\" he protested. \"Don't mention it to him. He'll spoil everything. H e's a weirdo. A nd be sides, he's too old and feeble-minded and he doesn't know what he's doing.\" \"He was a real sorcerer once,\" Benigno a dded. \"I mean a real one. My folks say he was the best. But he took to peyote and be came a nobody. N ow he's too ol d.\" \"And he goes over and ove r the same crappy s tories about peyote,\" Lucio said. \"That peyote is pure crap,\" Benigno s aid. \"You know , we tried it once. Lucio got a whole sack of it from his grandpa. One night as we were going to town we chewed it. Son of a bitch! It cut my mouth to shreds. It tasted like hell!\" \"Did you s wallow it?\" I asked. \"We spit it out,\" Lucio said, \"and threw the whole damn sack away.\" They bot h thought the incident was very funny. E ligio, in the meantime, had not said a word. He was withdrawn, as usual. He did not even laugh. \"Would you l ike to try it, Eligio?\" I asked. \"No. Not me. Not even for a motorcycle.\" Lucio and Benigno f ound t he statement utterly funny a nd roared again. \"Nevertheless,\" Eligio continued, \"I must admit that don J uan baffles me.\" \"My grandfather is too ol d to know anything,\" Lucio said with great conviction. \"Yeah, he's too ol d,\" Benigno e choed. I thought the opinion the two young m en had of don J uan was childish and unf ounde d. I felt it was my dut y to defend hi s character and I told them that in my judgm ent don J uan was then, as he had been in the past, a great sorcerer, perhaps even the greatest of all. I said I felt there was something about him, something truly extraordinary. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"I urged them to remember that he was over seventy years old and ye t he was more energetic and stronger than all of us put together. I challenged the young m en to prove it to themselves by trying to sneak up on don Juan. \"You just can't sneak up on m y grandpa,\" Lucio said proudly. \"He's a brujo.\" I reminded them that they had said he was too ol d and feeble-minded, and that a feeble-minded person doe s not know what goes on around hi m. I said that I had marveled at don J uan's alertness time and time again. \"No one can sneak up on a brujo, even if he's old,\" Benigno s aid with authority. \"They can gang up on hi m when he's asleep, though. T hat's what happened to a man named Cevicas. People got tired of his evil sorcery and killed him.\" I asked them to give me all the details of that event, but they said it had taken place before their time, or when they were still very young. E ligio added that people secretly believed that Cevicas had been onl y a fool, and that no one could harm a real sorcerer. I tried to que stion them further on their opinions about sorcerers. They did not seem to have much interest in the subject; besides, they were eager to start out and shoot the .22 rifle I had brought . We were silent for a while as we walked toward the thick chaparral, then Eligio, who was at the head of the line, turned around a nd said to me, \"Perhaps we're the crazy one s. Perhaps don J uan is right. Look a t the way we live.\" Lucio and Benigno pr otested. I tried to mediate. I agreed with Eligio and told them that I myself had felt that the way I lived was somehow wrong. B enigno s aid that I had no bus iness complaining about my life, that I had money and I had a car. I retorted that I could easily say that they themselves were better off because each owned a piece of land. T hey responde d in uni son that the owner of their land was the federal bank. I told them that I did not own my car either, that a bank in California owned it, and that my life was only different but not better than theirs. By that time we were already in the dense shrubs. We did not find any de er or wild boa rs, but we got three jack rabbits. On our return we stopped at Lucio's house and he announc ed that his wife was going to make rabbit stew. Benigno w ent to the store to buy a bottle of tequila and ge t us some sodas. When we came back don J uan was with him. \"Did you f ind m y grandpa at the store buyi ng be er?\" Lucio asked laughing. \"I haven't been invited to this reunion,\" don J uan said. \"I've just dropped by t o ask Carlos if he's leaving for Hermosillo.\" I told him I was planning to leave the next day, and while we talked Benigno di stributed the bottles. Eligio gave his to don J uan, and since among t he Yaquis it is deadly impolite to refuse, even as a courtesy, don J uan took i t quietly. I gave mine to Eligio, and he was obliged to take it. So Benigno i n turn gave me his bottle. But Lucio, who ha d obvi ously visualized the entire scheme of Yaqui good m anners, had already finished drinking hi s soda. He turned to Benigno, w ho ha d a pathetic look on hi s face, and said, laughing, \"They've screwed you out of your bottle.\" Don Juan said he never drank soda and pl aced his bottle in Benigno's hands. We sat unde r the ramada in silence. Eligio seemed to be nervous. He fidgeted with the brim of his hat. \"I've been thinking about what you s aid the other night,\" he said to don J uan. \"How can peyote change our life? How?\" Don Juan did not answer. He stared fixedly at Eligio for a moment and then began to sing in Yaqui. It was not a song pr oper, but a short recitation. W e remained qui et for a long t ime. Then I asked don J uan to translate the Yaqui words for me. \"That was only for Yaquis,\" he said matter-of-factly. I felt dejected. I was sure he had said something of great importance. \"Eligio is an Indian,\" don J uan finally said to me, \"and as an Indian Eligio has nothing. W e Indians have nothing. A ll you s ee around he re belongs to the Yoris. The Yaquis have only their wrath and what the land of fers to them freely.\" 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Nobody ut tered a sound f or quite some time, then don J uan stood up a nd said goodbye and walked away. We looked at him until he had disappeared behind a bend of the road. All of us seemed to be nervous. Lucio told us in a disoriented manner that his grandfather had not stayed because he hated rabbit stew. Eligio seemed to be immersed in thought s. Benigno t urned to me and said loudly, \"I think the Lord is going to puni sh you a nd don Juan for what you're doing.\" Lucio began to laugh a nd Benigno j oined him. \"You're clowning, B enigno,\" Eligio said somberly. \"What you've just said isn't worth a damn.\" September 15,1968 It was nine o'clock Saturday night. Don Juan sat in front of Eligio in the center of the ramada of Lucio's house. Don Juan placed his sack of peyote buttons between them and sang while rocking hi s body s lightly back and forth. Lucio, Benigno, a nd I sat five or six feet behind Eligio with our backs against the wall. It was quite dark at first. We had been sitting inside the hous e unde r the gasoline lantern waiting for don J uan. He had called us out to the ramada when he arrived and ha d told us where to sit. After a while my eyes became accustomed to the dark. I could see everyone clearly. I noticed that Eligio seemed to be terrified. His entire body s hook; his teeth chattered unc ontrollably. He was convul sed with spasmodic jerks of his head and ba ck. Don Juan spoke to him, telling hi m not to be afraid, and to trust the protector, and to think of nothing else. He casually took a peyote button, of fered it to Eligio, and or dered him to chew it very slowly. Eligio whined like a puppy a nd recoiled. His breathing was very rapid, it sounde d like the whizzing of bellows. He took of f his hat and wiped his forehead. He covered his face with his hands. I thought he was crying. It was a very long, t ense moment before he regained some control over himself. He sat up straight and, still covering hi s face with one hand, took t he peyote button and be gan chewing it. I felt a tremendous apprehension. I had not realized unt il then that I was perhaps as scared as Eligio. My mouth had a dryness similar to that produced by pe yote. Eligio chewed the button for a long t une. My tension in- creased. I began to whine involuntarily as my respiration be came more accelerated. Don Juan began to chant louder, then he offered another button to Eligio and after Eligio had finished it he offered him dry fruit and told him to chew it very slowly. Eligio got up repeatedly and went to the bushes. At one point he asked for water. Don Juan told him not to drink it but only swish it in his mouth. Eligio chewed two more buttons and don J uan gave him dry meat. By the time he had chewed his tenth but ton I was nearly sick with anxiety. Suddenly Eligio slumped forward and hi s forehead hit the ground. H e rolled on hi s left side and jerked con- vulsively. I looked at my watch. It was twenty after eleven. Eligio tossed, wobbled, and m oaned for over an hour while he lay on t he floor. Don Juan maintained the same position in front of him. His peyote songs were almost a murmur. Benigno, who was sitting to my right, looked inattentive; Lucio, next to him, had slumped on hi s side and was snoring. Eligio's body c rumpled into a contorted pos ition. H e lay on hi s right side with his front toward me and hi s hands between his legs. His body ga ve a powerful jump and he turned on hi s back with his legs slightly curved. His left hand waved out and up w ith an extremely free and elegant motion. H is right hand repeated the same pattern, and then bot h arms alternated in a wavering, slow movement, resembling that of a harpist. The move- ment became more vigorous by de grees. His arms had a perceptible vibration and went up and dow n like pistons. At the same time his hands rotated onw ard at the wrist and hi s fingers quivered. It was a beautiful, harmonious, hypnot ic sight. I thought his rhythm and m uscular control were beyond c omparison. Eligio then rose slowly, as if he were stretching against an enveloping force. His body S hivered. He squatted and then pus hed himself up to an erect position. H is arms, trunk, a nd he ad trembled as if an intermittent electric current were going through t hem. It was as though a force outside his control was setting hi m or driving hi m up. Don Juan's chanting be came very loud. L ucjo and Benigno w oke up and looked at the scene uninterestedly for a while and then went back to sleep. Eligio seemed to be moving up a nd up. H e was apparently climbing. H e cupped his hands and seemed to grab ont o obj ects beyond m y vision. H e pushed himself up and pa used to catch his breath. 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"I wanted to see his eyes and m oved closer to him, but don J uan gave me a fierce look a nd I recoiled to my place. Then Eligio jumped. It was a final, formidable leap. He had apparently reached his goal. He puffed and sobbed with the exertion. H e seemed to be holding ont o a ledge. But something was overtaking hi m. He shrieked desperately. His grip faltered and he began to fall. His body a rched backward and was convul sed from head to toe with the most beautiful, coordinated ripple. The ripple went through hi m perhaps a hundr ed times before his body c ollapsed like a lifeless burlap sack. After a while he extended his arms in front of him as though he was protecting hi s face. His legs stretched out backward as he lay on hi s chest; they were arched a few inches above the ground, gi ving hi s body t he very appearance of sliding or flying at an incredible speed. His head was arched as far back as possible, his arms locked ove r his eyes, shielding them. I could feel the wind hi ssing around hi m. I gasped and ga ve a loud involuntary shriek. Lucio and Benigno w oke and looked at Eligio curiously. \"If you pr omise to buy m e a motorcycle I will chew it now,\" Lucio said loudly. I looked at don J uan. He made an imperative gesture with his head. \"Son of a bitch!\" Lucio mumbled, and went back to sleep. Eligio stood up a nd be gan walking. H e took a couple of steps toward me and stopped. I could see him smiling with a beatific expression. H e tried to whistle. There was no clear sound ye t it had harmony. I t was a tune. It had onl y a couple of bars, which he repeated ove r and ove r. After a while the whistling was distinctly audible, and then it became a sharp melody. E ligio mumbled uni ntelligible words. The words seemed to be the lyrics to the tune. He repeated it for hour s. A very simple song, r epetitious, monotonous , and ye t strangely beautiful. Eligio seemed to be looking at something while he sang. A t one moment he got very close to me. I saw his eyes in the semidarkness. They were glassy, transfixed. He smiled and gi ggled. He walked and sat down and walked again, groaning and sighing. Suddenly something seemed to have pushed him from behind. H is body a rched in the middle as though moved by a direct force. At one instant Eligio was balanced on t he tips of his toes, making ne arly a complete circle, his hands touching the ground. H e dropped to the ground a gain, softly, on hi s back, and extended his whole length, acquiring a strange rigidity. He whimpered and gr oaned for a whale, then began to snore. Don Juan covered him with some burlap sacks. It was 5:35 A . M . Lucio and Benigno ha d fallen asleep shoulder to shoulder with their backs against the wall. Don Juan and I sat quietly for a very long t ime. He seemed to be tired. I broke the silence and asked him about Eligio. He told me that Eligio's encounter with Mescalito had been exceptionally successful; Mescalito had taught him a song t he first time they met and that was indeed extraordinary. I asked him why he had not let Lucio take some for a motorcycle. He said that Mescalito would have killed Lucio if he had approached him unde r such conditions. Don Juan admitted that he had prepared everything carefully to convince his grandson; he told me that he had counted on my friendship with Lucio as the central part of his strategy. H e said that Lucio had always been his great concern, and that at one time they had lived together and were very close, but Lucio became gravely ill when he was seven and don J uan's son, a devout Catholic, made a vow to the Virgin of Guadalupe that Lucio would join a sacred dancing society if his life were spared. Lucio recovered and was forced to carry out the promise. He lasted one week as an apprentice, and then made up hi s mind to break the vow. He thought he would have to die as a result of it, braced himself, and for a whole day he waited for death to come. Everybody m ade fun of the boy a nd the incident was never forgotten. Don Juan did not speak for a long t ime. He seemed to have become engulfed by t hought s. \"My setup was for Lucio,\" he said, \"and I found E ligio instead. I knew it was useless, but when we like someone we should properly insist, as though i t were possible to remake men. Lucio had courage when he was a little boy a nd then he lost it along t he way.\" \"Can you be witch him, don J uan?\" 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"\"Bewitch him? For what?\" \"So he will change and regain his courage.\" \"You don' t bewitch for courage. Courage is something pe rsonal. Bewitching is for rendering pe ople harmless or sick or dum b. You don' t bewitch to make warriors. To be a warrior you ha ve to be crystal clear, like Eligio. There you ha ve a man of courage!\" Eligio snored peacefully unde r the burlap sacks. It was already da ylight. The sky was impeccably blue. There were no clouds in sight. \"I would give anything in this world,\" I said, \"to know about Eligio's journey. Would you m ind if I asked him to tell me?\" \"You should not unde r any circumstances ask him to do t hat!\" \"Why not ? I tell you a bout my experiences.\" \"That's different. It is not your inclination to keep things to your self. Eligio is an Indian. His journey is all he has. I wish it had been Lucio.\" \"Isn't there anything you c an do, don J uan?\" \"No. Unfortunately there is no w ay to make bone s for a jellyfish. It was only my folly.\" The sun came out. Its light blurred my tired eyes. \"You've told me time and time again, don J uan, that a sorcerer cannot have follies. I've never thought you could have any.\" Don Juan looked at me piercingly. He got up, gl anced at Eligio and then at Lucio. He tucked his hat on hi s head, patting it on its top. \"It's possible to insist, to properly insist, even though w e know that what we're doing is useless,\" he said, smiling, \"But we must know first that our acts are useless and ye t we must proceed as if we didn't know it. That's a sorcerer's controlled folly.\" 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"5 I returned to don J uan's hous e on O ctober 3, 1968, f or the sole purpose of asking hi m about the events sur- roundi ng Eligio's initiation. A n almost endless stream of questions had occurred to me while rereading the account of what took pl ace then. I was after very precise explanations so I made a list of questions beforehand, carefully choosing the most appropriate words. I began by a sking hi m: \"Did I see that night, don J uan?\" \"You almost did.\" \"Did you see that I was seeing Eligio's movements?\" \"Yes. I saw that Mescalito was allowing you t o see part of Eligio's lesson, ot herwise you w ould've been look- ing at a man sitting there, or perhaps lying there. During the last mitote you di d not notice that the men were doing anything, di d you? \" At the last mitote I had not noticed any of the men performing m ovements out of the ordinary. I told him I could safely say that all I had recorded in my not es was that some of them got up and went to the bushes more often than others. \"But you ne arly saw Eligio's entire lesson,\" don J uan went on. \" Think about that. Do you unde rstand now how generous Mescalito is with you? Mescalito has never been so gentle with anyone , to my know ledge. Not anyone . And ye t you ha ve no regard for his generosity. How can you t urn your back on hi m so bluntly? Or perhaps I should say, in exchange for what are you t urning your back on M escalito?\" I felt that don J uan was cornering m e again. I was unable to answer his question. I had always believed I had quit the apprenticeship in order to save myself, yet I had no i dea from what I was saving m yself, or for what. I wanted to change the direction of our conversation qui ckly, and to that end I abandone d my intention to carry on with all my precalculated que stions and br ought out my most important query. \"I wonder if you c ould tell me more about your controlled folly,\" I said. \"What do you w ant to know about it?\" \"Please tell me, don J uan, what exactly is controlled folly?\" Don Juan laughed loudly and m ade a smacking sound by s lapping hi s thigh with the hollow of his hand. \"This is controlled folly!\" he said, and laughed and slapped his thigh again. \"What do you m ean ... ? \" \"I am happy t hat you f inally asked me about my controlled folly after so many ye ars, and ye t it wouldn't have mattered to me in the least if you ha d never asked. Yet I have chosen to feel happy, a s if I cared, that you a sked, as if it would matter that I care. That is controlled folly!\" We both laughed very loudly. I hugge d him. I found hi s explanation de lightful although I did not quite unde r- stand it. We were sitting, as usual, in the area right in front of the door of his hous e. It was mid-morning. D on Juan had a pile of seeds in front of him and was picking the debris from them. I had offered to help him but he had turned me down; he said the seeds were a gift for one of his friends in central Mexico and I did not have enough power to touch them. \"With whom do you e xercise controlled folly, don J uan?\" I asked after a long s ilence. He chuckled. \"With everybody! \" he exclaimed, smiling. \"When do you c hoose to exercise it, then?\" \"Every single time I act.\" I felt I needed to recapitulate at that point and I asked him if controlled folly meant that his acts were never sincere but were only the acts of an actor. \"My acts are sincere,\" he said, \"but they are only the acts of an actor.\" \"Then everything you do m ust be controlled folly!\" I said truly surprised. \"Yes, everything,\" he said. 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"\"But it can't be true,\" I protested, \"that every one of your acts is only controlled folly.\" \"Why not ?\" he replied with a mysterious look. \"That would mean that nothing m atters to you a nd you don' t really care about anything or anybody. T ake me, for example. Do you m ean that you don' t care whether or not I become a man of know ledge, or whether I live, or die, or do anything?\" \"True! I don't. You are like Lucio, or everybody e lse in my life, my controlled folly.\" I experienced a peculiar feeling of emptiness. Obviously there was no reason in the world why don J uan had to care about me, but on the other hand I had almost the certainty that he cared about me personally; I thought it could not be otherwise, since he had always given me his undi vided attention dur ing every moment I had spent with him. It occurred to me that perhaps don J uan was just saying that because he was annoye d with me. After all, I had qui t his teachings. \"I have the feeling we are not talking about the same thing,\" I said. \"I shouldn't have used myself as an ex- ample. What I meant to say was that there must be something in the world you c are about in a way that is not controlled folly. I don't think it is possible to go on l iving if nothing really matters to us.\" \"That applies to you \" he said. \"Things matter to you. You asked me about my controlled folly and I told you that everything I do in regard to myself and m y fellow men is folly, because nothing m atters.\" \"My poi nt is, don J uan, that if nothing m atters to you, how can you go on l iving?\" He laughed and after a moment's pause, in which he seemed to deliberate whether or not to answer, he got up and went to the back of his hous e. I followed him. \"Wait, wait, don J uan.\" I said. \"I really want to know ; you m ust explain to me what you m ean.\" \"Perhaps it's not possible to explain,\" he said. \"Certain things in your life matter to you be cause they're important; your acts are certainly important to you, but for me, not a single thing is important any longer, neither my acts nor the acts of any of my fellow men. I go on l iving, though, be cause I have my will. Because I have tempered my will throughout my life until it's neat and wholesome and now it doesn't matter to me that nothing matters. My will controls the folly of my life.\" He squatted and ran his fingers on some herbs that he had put to dry in the sun on a big piece of burlap. I was bewildered. Never would I have anticipated the direction that my que ry had taken. After a long pa use I thought of a good poi nt. I told him that in my opi nion some of the acts of my fellow men were of supreme im- portance. I pointed out that a nuclear war was definitely the most dramatic example of such an act. I said that for me destroying life on the face of the earth was an act of staggering enormity. \"You be lieve that because you're thinking. Y ou're thinking about life,\" don J uan said with a glint in his eyes. \"You're not seeing.\" \"Would I feel differently if I could see?\" I asked. \"Once a man learns to see he finds himself alone in the world with not hing but folly,\" don J uan said cryptically. He paused for a moment and looked at me as if he wanted to judge the effect of his words. \"Your acts, as well as the acts of your fellow men in general, appear to be important to you be cause you ha ve learned to think they are important.\" He used the word \"learned\" with such a peculiar inflection that it forced me to ask what he meant by it. He stopped handling hi s plants and looked at me. \"We learn to think about everything,\" he said, \"and then we train our eyes to look a s we think about the things we look a t. We look a t ourselves already thinking that we are important. And therefore we've got to feel important! But then when a man learns to see, he realizes that he can no l onger think about the things he looks at, and if he cannot think about what he looks at everything be comes unimportant.\" Don Juan must have noticed my puz zled look a nd repeated his statements three times, as if to make me understand them. What he said sounde d to me like gibberish at first, but upon t hinking about it, his words loomed more like a sophisticated statement about some facet of perception. I tried to think of a good que stion that would make him clarify his point, but I could not think of anything. 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"All of a sudden I felt exhausted and could not formulate my thought s clearly. Don Juan seemed to not ice my fatigue and pa tted me gently. \"Clean these plants here,\" he said, \"and then shred them carefully into this jar.\" He handed me a large coffee jar and left. He returned to his hous e hour s later, in the late afternoon. I had finished shredding hi s plants and ha d plenty of time to write my not es. I wanted to ask him some questions right off, but he was not in any m ood t o answer me. He said he was famished and ha d to fix his food f irst. He lit a fire in his earthen stove and set up a pot with bone-broth stock. He looked in the bag of groceries I had brought and took s ome vegetables, sliced them into small pieces, and dum ped them into the pot. Then he lay on hi s mat, kicked off his sandals, and told me to sit closer to the stove so I could feed the fire. It was almost dark; from where I sat I could see the sky to the west. The edges of some thick cloud f orma- tions were tinted with a deep buf f, while the center of the clouds remained almost black. I was going to make a comment on how beautiful the clouds were, but he spoke first. \"Fluffy edges and a thick core,\" he said, poi nting at the clouds. His statement was so perfectly apropos that it made me jump. \"I was just going to tell you a bout the clouds,\" I said. \"Then I beat you t o it,\" he said, and laughed with childlike abandon. I asked him if he was in a mood t o answer some questions. \"What do you w ant to know ?\" he replied. \"What you t old me this afternoon a bout controlled folly has disturbed me very much,\" I said. \"I really cannot understand what you m eant.\" \"Of course you c annot unde rstand it,\" he said. \"You are trying to think about it, and what I said doe s not fit with your thought s.\" \"I'm trying to think about it,\" I said, \"because that's the only way I personally can unde rstand anything. F or example, don J uan, do you m ean that once a man learns to see, everything in the whole world is worthless?\" \"I didn't say worthless. I said uni mportant. Everything is equal and therefore unimportant. For example, there is no w ay for me to say that my acts are more important than your s, or that one thing is more essential than an- other, therefore all things are equal and by be ing equal they are unimportant.\" I asked him if his statements were a pronounc ement that what he had called \"seeing\" was in effect a \"better way\" than merely \"looking at things.\" He said that the eyes of man could perform both functions, but neither of them was better than the other; however, to train the eyes only to look w as, in his opinion, an unne cessary loss. \"For instance, we need to look w ith our eyes to laugh,\" he said, \"because only when we look a t things can we catch the funny e dge of the world. On the other hand, w hen our eyes see, everything is so equal that nothing is funny.\" \"Do you m ean, don J uan, that a man who sees cannot ever laugh?' He remained silent for some time. \"Perhaps there are men of know ledge who ne ver laugh,\" he said. \"I don't know any of them, though. T hose I know see and also look, s o they laugh.\" \"Would a man of know ledge cry as well?\" \"I suppos e so. Our eyes look s o we may laugh, or cry, or rejoice, or be sad, or be happy. I personally don' t like to be sad, so whenever I witness something that would ordinarily make me sad, I simply shift my eyes and see it instead of looking at it. But when I encounter something funny I look a nd I laugh.\" \"But then, don J uan, your laughter is real and not controlled folly.\" Don Juan stared at me for a moment. \"I talk to you be cause you m ake me laugh,\" he said. \"You remind m e of some bushy-tailed rats of the desert that get caught when they stick their tails in hol es trying to scare other rats away in order to steal their food. Y ou get caught in your own que stions. Watch out ! Sometimes those rats yank their tails off trying to pul l themselves free.\" 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"I found hi s comparison funny a nd I laughed. Don Juan had onc e shown me some small rodents with bus hy tails that looked like fat squirrels; the image of one of those chubby r ats yanking its tail off was sad and at the same time morbidly funny. \"My laughter, as well as everything I do, i s real,\" he said, \"but it also is controlled folly because it is useless; it changes nothing and ye t I still do it.\" \"But as I unde rstand it, don J uan, your laughter is not useless. It makes you ha ppy.\" \"No! I am happy be cause I choose to look a t things that make me happy a nd then my eyes catch their funny edge and I laugh. I have said this to you c ountless times. One must always choose the path with heart in order to be at one's best, perhaps so one can always laugh.\" I interpreted what he had said as meaning that crying was inferior to laughter, or at least perhaps an act that weakened us. He asserted that there was no intrinsic difference and that both were unimportant; he said, how ever, that his preference was laughter, because laughter made his body f eel better than crying. At that point I suggested that if one has a preference there is no equality; if he preferred laughing to crying, the former was indeed more important. He stubbor nly maintained that his preference did not mean they were not equal; and I insisted that our argu- ment could be logically stretched to saying that if things were suppos ed to be so equal why not also choose death? \"Many m en of know ledge do that,\" he said. \"One day they may simply disappear. People may think that they have been ambushed and ki lled because of their doings. They choose to die because it doesn't matter to them. On the other hand, I choose to live, and to laugh, not because it matters, but because that choice is the bent of my na- ture. The reason I say I choose is because I see, but it isn't that I choose to live; my will makes me go on l iving in spite of anything I may see. \"You don' t unde rstand m e now because of your habit of thinking as you l ook a nd thinking as you t hink.\" This statement intrigued me very much. I asked him to explain what he meant by it. He repeated the same construct various times, as if giving hi mself time to arrange it in different terms, and then delivered his point, saying that by \"thinking\" he meant the constant idea that we have of everything in the world. He said that \"seeing\" dispelled that habit and unt il I learned to \"see\" I could not really unde rstand what he meant. \"But if nothing m atters, don J uan, why should it matter that I learn to see?\" \"I told you onc e that our lot as men is to learn, for good or bad,\" he said. \"I have learned to see and I tell you that nothing really matters; now it is your turn; perhaps some day you w ill see and you w ill know then whether things matter or not. For me nothing m atters, but perhaps for you e verything will. You should know by now that a man of know ledge lives by acting, not by thinking about acting, nor by thinking about what he will think when he has finished acting. A man of know ledge chooses a patlh with heart and follows it; and then he looks and rejoices and laughs; and then he sees and know s. He know s that his life will be over altogether too soon; he know s that he, as well as everybody e lse, is not going anywhere; he know s, because he sees, that nothing is more important than anything else. In other words, a man of know ledge has no honor , no di gnity, no f amily, no na me, no country, but only life to be lived, and unde r these circumstances his only tie to his fellow men is his controlled folly. Thus a man of know ledge endeavors, and sweats, and puf fs, and if one looks at him he is just like any ordinary man, except that the folly of has life is unde r control. Nothing be ing m ore important than anything else, a man of know ledge chooses any act, and acts it out as if it matters to him. His controlled folly makes him say that what he does matters and m akes him act as if it did, and ye t he know s that it doesn't; so when he fulfills his acts he retreats in peace, and whether his acts were good or bad, or worked or didn't, is in no w ay part of his concern. \"A man of know ledge may choose, on t he other hand, to remain totally impassive and ne ver act, and be have as if to be impassive really matters to him; he will be rightfully true at that too, be cause that would also be his controlled folly.\" I involved myself at this point in a very complicated effort to explain to don J uan that I was interested in 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"know ing what would motivate a man of know ledge to act in a particular way in spite of the fact that he knew nothing m attered. He chuckled softly before answering. \"You think about your acts,\" he said. \"Therefore you ha ve to believe your acts are as important as you t hink they are, when in reality not hing of what one does is important. Nothing! But then if nothing really matters, as you a sked me, how can I go on l iving? It would be simple to die; that's what you s ay and be lieve, because you're thinking about life, just as you're thinking now what seeing would be like. You wanted me to describe it to you s o you c ould begin to think about it, the way you do w ith everything else. In the case of seeing, however, thinking is not the issue at all, so I cannot tell you w hat it is like to see. Now you w ant me to describe the reasons for my controlled folly and I can onl y tell you t hat controlled folly is very much like seeing; it is something you c annot think about.\" He yawned. He lay on hi s back and stretched his arms and legs. His bone s made a cracking sound. \"You ha ve been away too long,\" he said. \"You think too m uch.\" He got up and walked into the thick chaparral at the side of the hous e. I fed the fire to keep the pot boiling. I was going to light a kerosene lantern but the semidarkness was very soothing. T he fire from the stove, which supplied enough l ight to write, also created a reddish glow all around m e. I put my not es on the ground a nd lay down. I felt tired. Out of the whole conversation with don J uan the only poi gnant thing in my mind was that he did not care about me; it disturbed me immensely. Over a period of years I had put my trust in him. Had I not had complete confidence in him I would have been paralyzed with fear at the prospect of learning hi s know ledge; the premise on w hich I had based my trust was the idea that he cared about me personally; actually I had always been afraid of him, but I had kept my fear in check because I trusted him. When he removed that basis I had not hing to fall back on a nd I felt helpless. A very strange anxiety pos sessed me. I became extremely agitated and be gan pacing up a nd dow n in front of the stove. Don Juan was taking a long t ime. I waited for him impatiently. He returned a while later; he sat down again in front of the fire and I blurted out my fears. I told him that I worried because I was incapable of changing di rections in midstream; I explained to him that together with the trust I had in him, I had also learned to respect and to regard his way of life as being intrinsically more rational, or at least more functional, than mine. I said that his words had plunged me into a terrible conflict because they entailed my having to change my feelings. To illustrate my poi nt I told don J uan the story of an old man of my culture, a very wealthy, conservative lawyer who lived his life convinced that he uphe ld the truth. In the early thirties, with the advent of the New Deal, he found hi mself passionately involved in the political drama of that time. He was categorically sure that change was deleterious to the country, and out of devotion to his way of life and the conviction that he was right, he vowed to fight what he thought to be a political evil. But the tide of the time was too strong, i t overpowered him. He struggled for ten years against it in the political arena and in the realm of his personal life; then the Second W orld War sealed his efforts into total defeat. His political and ideological downfall resulted in a profound bi tterness; he became a self-exile for twenty-five years. When I met him he was eighty-four years old and ha d come back to his hom e town to spend hi s last years in a hom e for the aged. It seemed inconceivable to me that he had lived that long, c onsidering the way he had squandered his life in bitterness and self-pity. Somehow he found m y company amenable and we used to talk at great length. The last time I saw him he had concluded our conversation with the following: \"I have had time to turn around a nd examine my life. The issues of my time are today onl y a story; not even an interesting one . Perhaps I threw away years of my life chasing something that never existed. I've had the feeling lately that I believed in something farcical. It wasn't worth my while. I think I know that. However, I can't retrieve the forty years I've lost.\" I told don J uan that my conflict arose from the doubt s into which his words about controlled folly had thrown me. \"If nothing really matters,\" I said, \"upon be coming a man of know ledge one would find one self, perforce, as empty as my friend and in no be tter position.\" \"That's not so,\" don J uan said cuttingly. \"Your friend is lonely because he will die without seeing. In his life 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"he just grew old and now he must have more self-pity than ever before. He feels he threw away forty years because he was after victories and found onl y defeats. He'll never know that to be victorious and to be defeated are equal. \"So now you're afraid of me because I've told you t hat you're equal to everything else. You're being childish. Our lot as men is to learn and one goes to know ledge as one goes to war; I have told you t his countless times. One goes to know ledge or to war with fear, with respect, aware that one is going to war, and with absolute confidence in one self. Put your trust in your self, not in me. \"And so you' re afraid of the emptiness of your friend's life. But there's no emptiness in the life of a man of know ledge, I tell you. E verything is filled to the brim.\" Don Juan stood up a nd extended his arms as if feeling things in the air. \"Everything is filled to the brim,\" he repeated, \"and everything is equal. I'm not like your friend who just grew old. When I tell you t hat nothing m atters I don't mean it the way he does. For him, his struggle was not worth his while, because he was defeated; for me there is no vi ctory, or defeat, or emptiness. Everything is filled to the brim and everything is equal and m y struggle was worth my while. \"In order to become a man of know ledge one must be a warrior, not a whimpering child. One must strive without giving up, w ithout a complaint, without flinching, unt il one sees, only to realize then that nothing matters.\" Don Juan stirred the pot with a wooden spoon. T he food w as ready. H e took t he pot off the fire and pl aced it on an adobe rectangular block, which he had bui lt against the wall and which he used as a shelf or a table. With his foot he shoved two small boxe s that served as comfortable chairs, especially if one sat with his back against the supporting be ams of the wall. He signaled me to sit down and then he pour ed a bowl of soup. H e smiled; his eyes were shining as if he were truly enjoying m y presence. He pushed the bowl gently toward me. There was such a warmth and ki ndness in his gesture that it seemed to be an appeal to restore my trust in him. I felt idiotic; I tried to disrupt my mood by l ooking for my spoon, but I couldn't find it. The soup w as too hot to be drunk directly from the bowl, and while it cooled off I asked don J uan if controlled folly meant that a man of know ledge could not like anybody a ny m ore. He stopped eating and laughed. \"You're too concerned with liking pe ople or with being liked your self,\" he said. \"A man of know ledge likes, that's all. He likes whatever or whoever he wants, but he uses his controlled folly to be unconcerned about it. The oppos ite of what you a re doing now . To like people or to be liked by pe ople is not all one can do a s a man.\" He stared at me for a moment with his head tilted a little to one side. \"Think about that,\" he said. \"There is one more thing I want to ask, don J uan. You said that we need to look w ith our eyes to laugh, but I believe we laugh be cause we think. T ake a blind m an, he also laughs.\" \"No,\" he said. \"Blind m en don' t laugh. T heir bodi es jerk a little with the ripple of laughter. They have never looked at the funny e dge of the world and ha ve to imagine it. Their laughter is not roaring.\" We did not speak any m ore. I had a sensation of well-being, of happiness. We ate in silence; then don J uan began to laugh. I was using a dry twig to spoon t he vegetables into my mouth. October 4,1968 At a certain moment today I asked don J uan if he minded talking a bit more about \"seeing.\" He seemed to deliberate for an instant, then he smiled and said that I was again involved in my usual routine, trying to talk instead of doing. \"If you w ant to see you ha ve to let the smoke guide you,\" he said emphatically. \"I won't talk about this any more.\" I was helping hi m clean some dry herbs. We worked in complete silence for a long t ime. When I am forced into a prolonged silence I always feel apprehensive, especially around don J uan. At a given moment I brought up a question to him in a sort of compulsive, almost belligerent outburst. \"How does a man of know ledge exercise controlled folly when it comes to the death of a person he loves?\" I 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"asked. Don Juan was taken aback by m y que stion and looked at me quizzically. \"Take your grandson Lucio,\" I said. \"Would your acts be controlled folly at the time of his death?\" \"Take my son Eulalio, that's a better example,\" don J uan replied calmly. \"He was crushed by r ocks while working in the construction of the Pan-American Highway. My acts toward him at the moment of his death were controlled folly. When I came down to the blasting area he was almost dead, but his body w as so strong t hat it kept on m oving and ki cking. I stood i n front of him and told the boys in the road crew not to move him any m ore; they obe yed me and stood t here surroundi ng m y son, looking at his mangled body. I stood t here too, but I did not look. I shifted my eyes so I would see his personal life disintegrating, expanding unc ontrollably beyond i ts limits, like a fog of crystals, because that is the way life and de ath mix and expand. T hat is what I did at the time of my son's death. That's all one could ever do, a nd that is controlled folly. Had I looked at him I would have watched him becoming immobile and I would have felt a cry inside of me, because never again would I look a t his fine figure pacing the earth. I saw his death instead, and there was no sadness, no f eeling. H is death was equal to everything else.\" Don Juan was quiet for a moment. He seemed to be sad, but then he smiled and tapped my head. \"So you m ay say that when it comes to the death of a person I love, my controlled folly is to shift my eyes.\" I thought about the people I love myself and a terribly oppr essive wave of self-pity enveloped me. \"Lucky you, don J uan,\" I said. \"You can shift your eyes, while I can onl y look.\" He found m y statement funny a nd laughed. \"Lucky, bul l!\" -he said. \"It's hard work.\" We both laughed. After a long s ilence I began probing hi m again, perhaps only to dispel my own sadness. \"If I have unde rstood you c orrectly then, don J uan,\" I said, \"the only acts in the life of a man of know ledge which are not controlled folly are those he performs with his ally or with Mescalito. Isn't that right?\" \"That's right,\" he said, chuckling. \"My ally and M escalito are not on a par with us hum an beings. My con- trolled folly applies only to myself and to the acts I perform while in the company of my fellow men.\" \"However, it is a logical possibility,\" I said, \"to think that a man of know ledge may also regard his acts with his ally or with Mescalito as controlled folly, true?\" He stared at me for a moment. \"You're thinking again,\" he said. \"A man of know ledge doesn't think, therefore he cannot encounter that possibility. Take me, for example. I say that my controlled folly applies to the acts I performed while in the com- pany of my fellow men; I say that because I can see my fellow men. However, I cannot see through m y ally and that makes it incomprehensible to me, so how could I control my folly if I don't see through i t? With my ally or with Mescalito I am only a man who know s how to see and finds that he's baffled by w hat he sees; a man who know s that he'll never unde rstand all that is around hi m. \"Take your case, for instance. It doesn't matter to me whether you be come a man of know ledge or not; however, it matters to Mescalito. Obviously it matters to him or he wouldn't take so many steps to show his concern about you. I can not ice his concern and I act toward it, yet his reasons are incomprehensible to me.\" 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"6 Just as we were getting into my car to start on a trip to central Mexico, on O ctober 5, 1968, don J uan stopped me. \"I have told you be fore,\" he said with a serious expression, \"that one should never reveal the name nor the whereabouts of a sorcerer. I believe you unde rstood t hat you s hould never reveal my name nor the place where my body i s. Now I am going to ask you t o do t he same with a friend of mine, a friend you w ill call Genaro. We are going to his hous e; we will spend some time there.\" I assured don J uan that I had never betrayed his confidence. \"I know that,\" he said without changing hi s serious expression. \"Yet I am concerned with your becoming thought less.\" I protested and don J uan said his aim was only to remind m e that every time one was careless in matters of sorcery, one was playing with an imminent and senseless death that could be averted by be ing thought ful and aware. \"We will not touch upon t his matter any longer,\" he said. \"Once we leave my hous e we will not mention Genaro, nor will we think about him. I want you t o put your thought s in order now. When you m eet him you must be clear and ha ve no doubt s in your mind.\" \"What kinds of doubt s are you r eferring to, don J uan?\" \"Any ki nds of doubt s whatever. When you m eet him you ought to be crystal clear. He will see you!\" His strange admonitions made me very apprehensive. I mentioned that perhaps I should not meet his friend at all but only drive to the vicinity of his friend's hous e and leave him there. \"What I've told you w as only a precaution,\" he said. \"You've met one sorcerer already, V icente, and he nearly killed you. W atch out this time!\" After we arrived in central Mexico it took us two days to walk from where I left my car to his friend's hous e, a little shack perched on t he side of a mountain. Don Juan's friend was at the door , as if he had been waiting for us. I recognized him immediately. I had already m ade his acquaintance, although ve ry briefly, when I brought my book t o don J uan. I had not really looked at him at that time, except in a glancing fashion, so I had had the feeling he was as old as don J uan. As he stood a t the door of his hous e, how ever, I noticed that he was definitely younge r. He was perhaps in his early sixties. He was shorter than don J uan and slimmer, very dark and wiry. His hair was thick and gr aying and a bit long; it ran ove r his ears and forehead. His face was round a nd ha rd. A very prominent nose made him look l ike a bird of prey with small dark eyes. He talked to don J uan first. Don Juan nodde d affirmatively. They conversed briefly. They were not speaking Spanish so I did not unde rstand what they were saying. T hen don G enaro turned to me. \"You're welcome to my hum ble little shack,\" he said apologetically in Spanish. His words were a polite formula I had heard before in various rural areas of Mexico. Yet as he said the words he laughed joyous ly for no ove rt reason, and I knew he was exercising hi s controlled folly. He did not care in the least that his hous e was a shack. I liked don G enaro very much. For the next two days we went into the mountains to collect plants. Don Juan, don G enaro, and I left each day at the crack of dawn. The two old men went together to some specific but unidentified part of the mountains and left me alone in one area of the woods. I had an exquisite feeling there. I did not notice the passage of time, nor was I apprehensive at staying alone; the extraordinary experience I had bot h days was an unc anny c apacity to concentrate on the delicate task of finding the specific plants don J uan had entrusted me to collect. We returned to the hous e in the late afternoon a nd bot h days I was so tired that I fell asleep immediately. The third day, how ever, was different. The three of us worked together, and don J uan asked don G enaro to teach me how to select certain plants. We returned around noon a nd the two old men sat for hour s in front of the house, in complete silence, as if they were in a state of trance. Yet they were not asleep. I walked around t hem a couple of times; don J uan followed my movements with his eyes, and so did don G enaro. \"You m ust talk to the plants before you pi ck them,\" don J uan said. He dropped his words casually and 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"repeated his statement three times, as if to catch my attention. N obody ha d said a word unt il he spoke. \"In order to see the plants you m ust talk to them personally,\" he went on. \" You m ust get to know them individually; then the plants can tell you a nything you c are to know about them.\" It was late in the afternoon. D on Juan was sitting on a flat rock facing the western mountains; don G enaro was sitting by hi m on a straw mat with his face toward the north. Bon Juan had told me, the first day we were there, that those were their \"positions\" and that I had to sit on the ground a t any pl ace oppos ite to bot h of them. He added that while we sat in those positions I had to keep my face toward the southeast and look a t them only in brief glances. \"Yes, that's the way it is with plants, isn't it?\" don J uan said and turned to don G enaro, who agreed with an affirmative gesture. I told him that the reason I had not followed his instructions was because I felt a little stupid talking to plants. \"You fail to unde rstand that a sorcerer is not joking,\" he said severely. \"When a sorcerer attempts to see, he attempts to gain pow er.\" Don Genaro was staring at me. I was taking not es and that seemed to baffle him. He smiled at me, shook hi s head, and said something to don J uan. Don Juan shrugged his shoulders. To see me writing m ust have been qui te odd f or don G enaro. Don Juan was, I suppos e, habituated to my taking not es, and the fact that I wrote while he spoke was no longer odd t o him; he could carry on t alking without appearing to not ice my acts. Don Genaro, however, kept on laughing, and I had to stop writing in order not to disrupt the mood of the conversation. Don Juan affirmed again that a sorcerer's acts were not to be taken as jokes because a sorcerer played with death at every turn of the way. Then he proceeded to relate to don G enaro the story of how one night I had looked at the lights of death following m e during one of our trips. The story proved to be utterly funny; don Genaro rolled on t he ground l aughing. Don Juan apologized to me and said that his friend was given to explosions of laughter. I glanced at don Genaro, who I thought was still rolling on t he ground, a nd saw him performing a most unus ual act. He was standing on hi s head without the aid of his arms or hands, and hi s legs were crossed as if he were sitting. T he sight was so incongruous that it made me jump. When I realized he was doing something almost impossible, from the point of view of body m echanics, he had gone back again to a normal sitting pos ition. D on Juan, however, seemed to be cognizant of what was involved and celebrated don G enaro's performance with roaring laughter. Don Genaro seemed to have noticed my confusion; he clapped his hands a couple of times and rolled on t he ground a gain; apparently he wanted me to watch him. What had at first appeared to be rolling on t he ground w as actually leaning ove r in a sitting pos ition, and touching the ground w ith his head. He seemingly attained his illog- ical posture by ga ining m omentum, leaning ove r several times, until the inertia carried his body t o a vertical stand, so that for an instant he \"sat on hi s head.\" When their laughter subsided don J uan continued talking; his tone was very severe. I shifted the position of my body i n order to be at ease and gi ve him all my attention. H e did not smile at all, as he usually doe s, especially when I try to pay deliberate attention to what he is saying. D on Genaro kept looking at me as if he were expecting m e to start writing again, but I did not take notes any m ore. Don Juan's words were a reprimand for not talking to the plants I had collected, as he had always told me to do. H e said the plants I had killed could also have killed me; he said he was sure they would, sooner or later, make me get ill. He added that if I became ill as a result of hurting pl ants, I would, how ever, slough i t off and be lieve I had onl y a touch of the flu. The two of them had another moment of mirth, then don J uan became serious again and said that if I did not think of my death, my entire life would be only a personal chaos. He looked very stern. \"What else can a man have, except his life and hi s death?\" he said to me. At that point I felt it was indispensable to take notes and I began writing again. Don Genaro stared at me and smiled. Then he tilted his head back a little and ope ned his nostrils. He apparently had remarkable control over the muscles operating hi s nostrils, because they ope ned up t o perhaps twice their normal size. What was most comical about his clowning was not so much his gestures as his own reactions to them. After 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"he enlarged his nostrils he tumbled dow n, laughing, and worked his body a gain into the same, strange, sitting-on- his-head, ups ide-down pos ture. Don Juan laughed unt il tears rolled dow n his cheeks. I felt a bit embarrassed and laughed nervously. \"Genaro doe sn't like writing,\" don J uan said as an explanation. I put my not es away, but don G enaro assured me that it was all right to write, because he did not really mind it. I gathered my not es again and be gan writing. H e repeated the same hilarious motions and bot h of them had the same reactions again. Don Juan looked at me, still laughing, and said that his friend was portraying m e; that my tendency was to open my nos trils whenever I wrote; and that don G enaro thought that trying to become a sorcerer by taking not es was as absurd as sitting on one 's head and thus he had made up the ludicrous posture of resting the weight of his sitting body on hi s head. \"Perhaps you don' t think it's funny,\" don J uan said, \"but only Genaro can work his way up t o sitting on hi s head, and onl y you c an think of learning to be a sorcerer by w riting your way up.\" They bot h had another explosion of laughter and don G enaro repeated his incredible movement. I liked him. There was so much grace and di rectness in his acts. \"My apologies, don G enaro,\" I said, poi nting to the writing pa d. \"It's all right,\" he said and chuckled again. I could not write any m ore. They went on talking for a very long t ime about how plants could actually kill and how sorcerers used plants in that capacity. Both of them kept staring at me while they talked, as if they expected me to write. \"Carlos is like a horse that doesn't like to be saddled,\" don J uan said. \"You ha ve to be very slow with him. You scared him and now he won't write.\" Don Genaro expanded his nostrils and said in a mocking pl ea, frowning and puc kering hi s mouth. \"Come on, C arlitos, write! Write until your thumb falls off.\" Don Juan stood up, s tretching hi s arms and arching hi s back. In spite of his advanced age his body s eemed to be powerful and limber. He went to the bushes at the side of the hous e and I was left alone with don G enaro. He looked at me and I moved my eyes away because he made me feel embarrassed. \"Don't tell me you're not even goi ng to look a t me?\" he said with a most hilarious intonation. He opened his nostrils and m ade them quiver; then he stood up a nd repeated don J uan's movements, arching his back and stretching hi s arms but with his body c ontorted into a most ludicrous position; it was truly an indescribable gesture that combined an exquisite sense of pantomime and a sense of the ridiculous. It enthralled me. It was a masterful caricature of don J uan. Don Juan came back at that moment and caught the gesture and obvi ously the meaning also. He sat down chuckling. \"Which direction is the wind?\" don G enaro asked casually. Don Juan poi nted to the west with a movement of his head. \"I'd better go w here the wind bl ows,\" don G enaro said with a serious expression. He then turned and shook hi s finger at me. \"And don' t you pa y any attention if you he ar strange noises,\" he said. \"When Genaro shits the mountains tremble.\" He leaped into the bushes and a moment later I heard a very strange noise, a deep, une arthly rumble. I did not know what to make of it. I looked at don J uan for a clue but he was doubl ed ove r with laughter. October 17,1968 I don't remember what prompted don G enaro to tell me about the arrangement of the \"other world,\" as he called it. He said that a master sorcerer was an eagle, or rather that he could make himself into an eagle. On the other hand, an evil sorcerer was a \"tecolote,\" an owl. Don Genaro said that an evil sorcerer was a child of the night and for such a man the most useful animals were the mountain lion or other wild cats, or the night birds, especially the owl. He said that the \"brujos liricos,\" lyric sorcerers, meaning the dilettante sorcerers, preferred 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"other animals—a crow, for example. Don Juan laughed; he had been listening in silence. Don Genaro turned to him and said, \"That's true, you know that, Juan.\" Then he said that a master sorcerer could take his disciple on a journey with him and actually pass through the ten layers of the other world. The master, provided that he was an eagle, could start at the very bot tom layer and then go t hrough e ach successive world unt il he reached the top. E vil sorcerers and di lettantes could at best, be said, go t hrough onl y three layers. Don Genaro gave a description of what those steps were by saying, \"You start at the very bot tom and then your teacher takes you w ith him in his flight and soon, boom ! You go t hrough t he first layer. Then a little while later, boom ! You go t hrough t he second; and boom ! You go t hrough t he third...\" Don Genaro took m e through t en boom s to the last layer of the world. When he had finished talking don J uan looked at me and smiled know ingly. \"Talking is not Genaro's predilection,\" he said, \"but if you c are to get a lesson, he will teach you a bout the equilibrium of things.\" Don Genaro nodde d affirmatively; he puckered up hi s mouth and closed his eyelids halfway. I thought his gesture was delightful. Don Genaro stood up a nd so did don J uan. \"All right,\" don G enaro said. \"Let's go, t hen. We could go a nd wait for Nestor and Pablito. They're through now . On Thursdays they're through e arly.\" Both of them got into my car; don J uan sat in the front. I did not ask them anything but simply started the engine. Don Juan directed me to a place he said was Nestor's hom e; don G enaro went into the hous e and a while later came out with Nestor and Pablito, two young m en who were his apprentices. They all got in my car and don Juan told me to take the road toward the western mountains. We left my car on the side of the dirt road and walked along t he bank of a river, which was perhaps fifteen or twenty feet across, to a waterfall that was visible from where I had parked. It was late afternoon. T he scenery was quite impressive. Directly above us there was a huge , dark, bluish cloud t hat looked like a floating roof; it had a well-defined edge and was shaped like an enormous half-circle. To the west, on t he high m ountains of the Cor- dillera Central, the rain seemed to be descending on t he slopes. It looked like a whitish curtain falling on t he green peaks. To the east there was the long, de ep valley; there were only scattered clouds over the valley and the sun was shining there. The contrast between the two areas was magnificent. We stopped at the bottom of the waterfall; it was perhaps a hundr ed and fifty feet high; the roar was very loud. Don Genaro fastened a belt around hi s waist. He had at least seven items hanging from it. They looked like small gour ds. He took of f his hat and let it hang on hi s back from a cord tied around hi s neck. He put on a head- band that he took f rom a pouc h made of a thick wool fabric. The headband was also made of wool of various colors; a sharp yellow was the most prominent of them. He inserted three feathers in the headband. T hey seemed to be eagle feathers. I noticed that the places where he had inserted them were not symmetrical. One feather was above the back curve of his right ear, the other was a few inches to the front, and the third was over his left temple. Then he took of f his sandals, hooke d or tied them to the waist of his trousers, and fastened his belt over his poncho. T he belt seemed to be made of woven strips of leather. I could not see whether he tied it or buckled it. Don Genaro walked toward the waterfall. Don Juan manipulated a round r ock into a steady pos ition and-sat down on i t. The other two young m en did the same with some rocks and sat down to his left. Don Juan poi nted to the place next to him, on hi s right side, and told me to bring a rock and sit by hi m\". \"We must make a line here,\" he said, showing m e that the three were sitting in a row. By then don G enaro had reached the very bot tom of the waterfall and ha d begun c limbing a trail on the right side of it. From where we were sitting the trail looked fairly steep. There were a lot of shrubs he used as railings. At one moment he seemed to lose his footing and almost slid dow n, as if the dirt were slippery. A moment later the same thing ha ppened and the thought crossed my mind that perhaps don G enaro was too ol d to be climbing. I saw him slipping and stumbling several times before he reached the spot where the trail ended. I experienced a sort of apprehension when he began to climb tihe rocks. I could not figure out what he was going to do. 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"\"What's he doing?\" I asked don J uan in a whisper. Don Juan did not look a t me. \"Obviously he's climbing,\" he said. Don Juan was looking straight at don G enaro. His gaze was fixed. His eyelids were half-closed. He was sitting ve ry erect with his hands resting be tween his legs, on t he edge of the rock. I leaned ove r a little bit to see the two young m en. Don Juan made an imperative gesture with his hand to make me get back in line. I retreated immediately. I had onl y a glimpse of the young m en. They seemed to be as attentive as he was. Don Juan made another gesture with his hand and poi nted to the direction of the waterfall. I looked again. Don Genaro had climbed qui te a way on t he rocky wall. At the moment I looked he was perched on a ledge, inching hi s way slowly to circumvent a huge boul der. His arms were spread, as if he were embracing the rock. He moved slowly toward his right and suddenly he lost his footing. I gasped involuntarily. For a moment his whole body hung i n the air. I was sure he was going to fall but he did not . His right hand ha d grabbed ont o something and ve ry agilely his feet went back on t he ledge again. But before he moved on he turned to us and looked. It was only a glance. There was, how ever, such a stylization to the movement of turning his head that I began to wonder. I remembered then that he had done the same thing, turning to look a t us, every time he slipped. I had thought that don G enaro must have felt embarrassed by hi s clumsiness and turned to see if we were looking. He climbed a bit more toward the top, suffered another loss of footing, and hung pe rilously on t he overhanging rock face. This time he was suppor ted by hi s left hand. W hen he regained his balance he turned and looked at us again. He slipped twice more before he reached the top. F rom where we were sitting, the crest of the waterfall seemed to be twenty to twenty-five feet across. Don Genaro stood m otionless for a moment. I wanted to ask don J uan what don G enaro was going to do up there, but don J uan seemed to be so absorbed in watching that I did not dare disturb him. Suddenly don G enaro jumped ont o the water. It was such a thoroughl y une xpected action that I felt a vacuum in the pit of my stomach. It was a magnificent, outlandish leap. For a second I had the clear sensation that I had seen a series of superimposed images of his body m aking an elliptical flight to the middle of the stream. When my surprise receded I noticed that he had landed on a rock on t he edge of the fall, a rock which was hardly visible from where we were sitting. He stayed perched there for a long t ime. He seemed to be fighting the power of the onrushing water. Twice he hung ove r the precipice and I could not determine what he was clinging to. He gained his balance and squatted on the rock. Then he leaped again, like a tiger. I could barely see the next rock where he landed; it was like a small cone on the very edge of tine fall. He remained there almost ten minutes. He was motionless. His immobility was so impressive to me that I was shivering. I wanted to get up and walk around. D on Juan not iced my nervousness and told me imperatively to be calm. Don Genaro's stillness plunged me into an extraordinary and m ysterious terror. I felt that if he remained perched there any longer I could not control myself. Suddenly he jumped again, this time all the way to the other bank of the waterfall. He landed on hi s feet and hands, like a feline. He remained in a squat position for a moment, then he stood up a nd looked across the fall, to the other side, and then dow n at us. He stayed dead still looking at us. His hands were clasped at his sides, as if he were holding ont o an uns een railing. There was something truly exquisite about his posture; his body s eemed so nimble, so frail. I thought that don Genaro with his headband and feathers, his dark ponc ho and hi s bare feet was the most beautiful hum an being I had ever seen. He threw his arms up suddenly, lifted his head, and flipped his body s wiftly in a sort of lateral somersault to his left. The boul der where he had been standing was round a nd when he jumped he disappeared behind it. 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Huge drops of rain began to fall at that moment. Don Juan got up and so did the two young m en. Their move- ment was so abrupt that it confused me. Don Genaro's masterful feat had thrown me into a state of profound emotional excitement. I felt he was a consummate artist and I wanted to see him right then to applaud hi m. I strained to look on t he left side of the waterfall to see if he was coming dow n, but he was not. I insisted on know ing what had happened to him. Don Juan did not answer. \"We better hurry out of here,\" he said. \"It's a real downpour . We have to take Nestor and Pablito to their house and then we'll have to start on our trip back.\" \"I didn't even say goodbye to don G enaro,\" I complained. \"He already said goodbye to you,\" don J uan answered harshly. He peered at me for an instant and then softened his frown and smiled. \"He has also wished you w ell,\" he said. \"He felt happy w ith you.\" \"But aren't we going to wait for him?\" \"No!\" don J uan said sharply, \"Let him be, wherever he is. Perhaps he is an eagle flying to the other world, or perhaps he has died up t here. It doesn't matter now.\" October 23,1968 Don Juan casually mentioned that he was going to make another trip to central Mexico in the near future. \"Are you goi ng to visit don G enaro?\" I asked. \"Perhaps,\" he said without looking at me. \"He's all right, isn't he, don J uan? I mean not hing ba d happened to him up there on top of the waterfall, did it?\" \"Nothing ha ppened to him; he is sturdy.\" We talked about his projected trip for a while and then I said I had enjoyed don G enaro's company and hi s jokes. He laughed and said that don G enaro was truly like a child. There was a long pa use; I struggled in my mind to find an ope ning line to ask about his lesson. D on Juan looked at me and said in a mischievous tone: \"You're dying to ask me about Genaro's lesson, aren't you? \" I laughed with embarrassment. I had been obs essed with everything that took pl ace at the waterfall. I had been hashing and rehashing all the details I could remember and m y conclusions were that I had witnessed an incredible feat of phys ical prowess. I thought don G enaro was beyond doubt a peerless master of equilibrium; every single movement he had performed was highly ritualized and, ne edless to say, must have had some inextricable, symbolic meaning. \"Yes,\" I said. \"I admit I'm dying to know what his lesson was.\" \"Let me tell you s omething,\" don J uan said. \"It was a waste of time for you. H is lesson was for someone who can see. Pablito and Nestro got the gist of it, although t hey don' t see very well. But you, you w ent there to look. I told Genaro that you a re a very strange plugged-up fool and that perhaps you'd get unpl ugged with his lesson, but you di dn't. It doesn't matter, though. Seeing is very difficult. \"I didn't want you t o speak to Genaro afterwards, so we had to leave. Too ba d. Yet it would have been worse to stay. Genaro risked a great deal to show you s omething m agnificent. Too ba d you c an't see.\" \"Perhaps, don J uan, if you t ell me what the lesson was I may find out that I really saw.\" Don Juan doubl ed up w ith laughter. \"Your best feature is asking que stions,\" he said. He was apparently goi ng to drop the subject again. We were sitting, as usual, in the area in front of his hous e; he suddenly got up and walked inside. I trailed behind hi m and insisted on de scribing to him what I had seen. I faithfully followed the sequence of events as I remembered it. Don Juan kept on smiling while I spoke. When I had finished he shook hi s head. \"Seeing is very difficult,\" he said. I begged him to explain his statement \"Seeing is not a matter of talk,\" he said imperatively. Obviously he was not going to tell me anything m ore, so I gave up and left the hous e to run some errands for 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"him. When I returned it was already da rk; we had something to eat and afterwards we walked out to the ramada; we had no s ooner sat down than don J uan began to talk about don G enaro's lesson. H e did not give me any time to prepare myself for it. I did have my not es with me, but it was too da rk to write and I did not want to alter the flow of his talk by goi ng inside the hous e for the kerosene lantern. He said that don G enaro, being a master of balance, could perform very complex and di fficult movements. Sitting on hi s head was one of such movements and with it he had attempted to show me that it was impossible to \"see\" while I took not es. The action of sitting on hi s head without the aid of his hands was, at best, a freakish stunt that lasted onl y an instant. In don G enaro's opinion, w riting about \"seeing\" was the same; that is, it was a precarious maneuver, as odd a nd as unne cessary as sitting on one 's head. Don Juan peered at me in the dark and in a very dramatic tone said that while don G enaro was horsing around, s itting on hi s head, I was on the very verge of \"seeing.\" Don Genaro not iced it and repeated his ma- neuvers over and ove r, to no a vail, because I had lost the thread right away. Don Juan said that afterwards don G enaro, moved by hi s personal liking for me, attempted in a very dramatic way to bring m e back to that verge of \"seeing.\" After very careful deliberation he decided to show me a feat of equilibrium by crossing the waterfall. He felt that the waterfall was like the edge on w hich I was standing and was confident I could also make it across. Don Juan then explained don G enaro's feat. He said that he had already told me that hum an beings were, for those who \"saw,\" luminous beings composed of something like fibers of light, which rotated from the front to the back and m aintained the appearance of an egg. H e said that he had also told me that the most astonishing pa rt of the egg-like creatures was a set of long f ibers that came out of the area around t he navel; don J uan said that those fibers were of the uttermost importance in the life of a man. Those fibers were the secret of don G enaio's balance and hi s lesson ha d not hing to do w ith acrobatic jumps across the waterfall. His feat of equilibrium was in the way he used those \"tentacle-like\" fibers. Don Juan dropped the subject as suddenly as he had started it and be gan to talk about something thoroughl y unrelated. October 24,1968 I cornered don J uan and told him I intuitively felt that I was never going to get another lesson in equilibrium and that he had to explain to me all the pertinent details, which I would otherwise never discover by m yself. Don Juan said I was right, in so far as know ing that don G enaro would never give me another lesson. \"What else do you w ant to know ?\" he asked. \"What are those tentacle-like fibers, don J uan?\" \"They are the tentacles that come out of a man's body w hich are apparent to any sorcerer who sees. Sorcerers act toward people in accordance to the way they see their tentacles. Weak persons have very short, almost invisible fibers; strong pe rsons have bright, long one s. Genaro's, for instance, are so bright that they resemble thickness. You can tell from the fibers if a person is healthy, or if he is sick, or if he is mean, or kind, or treaoherous. You can also tell from the fibers if a person can see. Here is a baffling pr oblem. When Genaro saw you he knew, just like my friend Vicente did, that you c ould see; when I see you I see that you c an see and ye t I know myself that you c an't. How baffling! Genaro couldn't get over that. I told him that you w ere a strange fool. I think he wanted to see that for himself and took you t o the waterfall.\" \"Why do you t hink I give the impression I can see?\" Don Juan did not answer me. He remained silent for a long t ime. I did not want to ask him anything else. Finally he spoke to me and said that he knew why but did not know how to explain it. \"You think everything in the world is simple to unde rstand,\" he said, \"because everything you do i s a routine that is simple to unde rstand. A t the waterfall, when you l ooked at Genaro moving across the water, you be lieved that he was a master of somersaults, because somersaults was all you c ould think about. And that is all you w ill ever believe he did. Yet Genaro never jumped across that water. If he had jumped he would have died. Genaro balanced himself on hi s superb, bright fibers. He made them long, l ong e nough s o that he could, let's say, roll on them across the waterfall. He demonstrated the proper way to make those tentacles long, a nd how to move them 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"with precision. \"Pablito saw nearly all of Genaro's movements. Nestor, on t he other hand, saw only the most obvi ous maneuvers. He missed the delicate details. But you, you saw nothing at all.\" \"Perhaps if you ha d told me beforehand, don J uan, what to look f or ...\" He interrupted me and said that giving m e instructions would onl y have hindered don G enaro. Had I know n what was going to take place, my fibers would have been agitated and would have interfered with don G enaro's. \"If you c ould see,\" he said, \"it would have been obvious to you, f rom the first step that Genaro took, t hat he was not slipping as he went up the side of the waterfall. He was loosening hi s tentacles. Twice he made them go around boul ders and he ld to the sheer rock like a fly. When he got to the top and was ready to cross the water he focused them onto a small rock in the middle of the stream, and when they were secured there, he let the fibers pull him. Genaro never jumped, therefore he could land on t he slippery surfaces of small boul ders at the very edge of the water. His fibers were at all times neatly wrapped around e very rock he used. \"He did not stay on t he first boul der very long, be cause he had the rest of his fibers tied ont o another one, even smaller, at the place where the onrush of water was the greatest. His tentacles pulled him again and he landed on i t. That was the most outstanding thing he did. The surface was too small for a man to hol d ont o; and the onrush of the water would have washed his body ove r the precipice had he not had some of his fibers still focused on t he first rock. \"He stayed in that second pos ition for a long t ime, because he had to draw out his tentacles again and send them across to the other side of the fall. When he had them secured he had to release the fibers focused on t he first rock. That was very tricky. P erhaps only Genaro could do t hat. He nearly lost his grip; or maybe he was only fooling us , well never know that for sure. Personally, I really think he nearly lost his grip. I know that, because he became rigid and sent out a magnificent shoot, like a beam of light across the water. I feel that beam alone could have pulled him through. W hen he got to the other side he stood up a nd let his fibers glow like a cluster of lights. That was the one thing he did just for you. I f you ha d been able to see, you w ould have seen that. \"Genaro stood t here looking at you, a nd then he knew that you ha d not seen.\" 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"P ar t 2 The task of “Seeing” 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"7 Don Juan was not at his hous e when I arrived there at midday on N ovember 8, 1968. I had no i dea where to look f or him, so I sat and waited. For some unknow n reason I knew he would soon be hom e. A short while later don J uan walked into his hous e. He nodde d at me. We exchanged greetings. He seemed to be tired and lay dow n on hi s mat. He yawned a couple of times. The idea of \"seeing\" had become an obs ession with me and I had made up m y mind to use his hallucinogenic smoking m ixture again. It had been a terribly difficult decision to make, so I still wanted to argue the point a bit further. \"I want to learn to see, don J uan,\" I said bluntly. \"But I really don' t want to take anything; I don't want to smoke your mixture. Do you t hink there is any chance I could learn to see without it?\" He sat up, s tared at me for a moment, and lay dow n again. \"No!\" he said. \"You will have to use the smoke.\" \"But you s aid I was on the verge of seeing with don G enaro.\" \"I meant that something in you w as glowing as though you w ere really aware of Genaro's doings, but you were just looking. O bviously there is something in you t hat resembles seeing, but isn't; you're plugged up a nd only the smoke can help you.\" \"Why doe s one have to smoke? Why can't one simply learn to see by one self? I have a very earnest desire. Isn't that enough? \" \"No, it's not enough. Seeing is not so simple and onl y the smoke can give you t he speed you ne ed to catch a glimpse of that fleeting world. Otherwise you w ill only look.\" \"What do you m ean by a fleeting world?\" \"The world, when you see, is not as you t hink it is now. It's rather a fleeting world that moves and changes. One may perhaps learn to apprehend that fleeting world by one self, but it won't do any good, be cause the body decays with the stress. With the smoke, on t he other hand, one never suffers from exhaustion. T he smoke gives the necessary speed to grasp the fleeting m ovement of the world and at the same time it keeps the body a nd its strength intact.\" \"All right!\" I said dramatically. \"I don't want to beat around t he bush any longer. I'll smoke.\" He laughed at my display of histrionics. \"Cut it out,\" he said. \"You always hook ont o the wrong t hing. N ow you t hink that just deciding to let the smoke guide you i s going to make you see. There's much more to it. There is always much more to anything.\" He became serious for a moment. \"I have been very careful with you, a nd m y acts have been deliberate,\" he said, \"because it is Mescalito's desire that you unde rstand m y know ledge. But I know that I won't have time to teach you a ll I want. I will only have time to put you on t he road and trust that you w ill seek in the same fashion I did. I must admit that you a re more indolent and m ore stubbor n than I. You ha ve other views, though, a nd the direction that your life will take is something I cannot foresee.\" His deliberate tone of voice, something in his attitude, summoned up a n old feeling in me, a mixture of fear, loneliness, and expectation. \"We'll soon know where you s tand,\" he said cryptically. He did not say anything else. After a while he went outside the hous e. I followed him and stood i n front of him, not know ing whether to sit down or to unl oad some packages I had brought for him. \"Would it be dangerous?\" I asked, just to say something. \"Everything is dangerous,\" he said. Don Juan did not seem to be inclined to tell me anything else; he gathered some small bundl es that were piled in a corner and put them inside a carrying ne t. I did not offer to help him because I knew that if he had wished my help he would have asked me. Then he lay dow n on hi s straw mat. He told me to relax and rest. I lay down on m y mat and tried to sleep but I was not tired; the night before I had stopped at a motel and slept until 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"noon, know ing that I had onl y a three-hour drive to don J uan's place. He was not sleeping either. Although hi s eyes were closed, I noticed an almost imperceptible, rhythmical movement of his head. The thought occurred to me that he was perhaps chanting to himself. \"Let's eat something,\" don J uan said suddenly, and hi s voice made me jump. \"You're going to need all your energy. Y ou should be in good s hape.\" He made some soup, but I wasn't hungr y. The next day, November 9, don J uan let me eat only a morsel of food a nd told me to rest. I lay around a ll morning but I could not relax. I had no i dea what don J uan had in mind, but , worst of all, I was not certain what I had in mind m yself. We were sitting unde r his ramada around 3: 00 P.M. I was very hungr y. I had suggested various times that we should eat, but he had refused. \"You ha ven't prepared your mixture for three years,\" he said suddenly. \"You'll have to smoke my mixture, so let's say that I have collected it for you. Y ou will need onl y a bit of it. I will fill the pipe's bowl once. You will smoke all of it and then rest. Then the keeper of the other world will come. You will do not hing but observe it. Observe how it moves; observe everything it does. Your life may depend on how well you w atch.\" Don Juan had dropped his instructions so abruptly that I did not know what to say or even what to think. I mumbled incoherently for a moment. I could not organize my thought s. Finally I asked the first clear thing that came to my mind. \"Who's this guardian?\" Don Juan flatly refused to involve himself in conversation, but I was too ne rvous to stop talking and I insisted desperately that he tell me about this guardian. \"You'll see it,\" he said casually. \"It guards the other world.\" \"What world? The world of the dead?\" \"It's not the world of the dead or the world of anything. It's just another world. There's no us e telling you about it. See it for your self.\" With that don J uan went inside the hous e. I followed him into his room. \"Wait, wait, don J uan. What are you goi ng to do? \" He did not answer. He took hi s pipe out of a bundl e and sat down on a straw mat in the center of the room, looking at me inquisitively. He seemed to be waiting for my consent. \"You're a fool,\" he said softly. \"You're not afraid. You just say you' re afraid.\" He shook hi s head slowly from side to side. Then he took t he little bag with the smoking m ixture and filled the pipe bowl. \"I am afraid, don J uan. I am really afraid.\" \"No, it's not fear.\" I desperately tried to gain time and be gan a long di scussion about the nature of my feelings. I sincerely main- tained that I was afraid, but he pointed out that I was not panting, nor was my heart beating faster than usual. I thought for a while about what he had said. He was wrong; I did have many of the phys ical changes ordinarily associated with fear, and I was desperate. A sense of impending doom permeated everything around me. My stomach was upset and I was sure I was pale; my hands were sweating pr ofusely; and ye t I really thought I was not afraid. I did not have the feeling of fear I had been accustomed to throughout my life. The fear which has always been idiosyncratically mine was not there. I was talking as I paced up a nd dow n the room in front of don J uan, who was still sitting on hi s mat, holding hi s pipe, and looking at me inquisitively; and upon considering the matter I arrived at the conclusion that what I felt instead of my usual fear was a profound s ense of displeasure, a discomfort at the mere thought of the confusion created by t he intake of hallucinogenic plants. Don Juan stared at me for an instant, then he looked past me, squinting as if he were struggling to detect something in the distance. I kept walking ba ck and forth in front of him until he forcefully told me to sit down and relax. We sat quietly for a few minutes. 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"\"You don' t want to lose your clarity, do you? \" he said abruptly. \"That's very right, don J uan,\" I said. He laughed with apparent delight. \"Clarity, the second e nemy of a man of know ledge, has loomed upon you. \"You're not afraid,\" he said reassuringly, \"but now you ha te to lose your clarity, and since you're a fool, you call that fear.\" He chuckled. \"Get me some charcoals,\" he ordered. His tone was kind and reassuring. I got up automatically and went to the back of the hous e and ga thered some small pieces of burning charcoal from the fire, put them on top of a small stone slab, and returned to the room. \"Come out here to the porch,\" don J uan called loudly from outside. He placed a straw mat on the spot where I usually sit. I put the charcoals next to him and he blew on them to activate the fire. I was about to sit down but he stopped me and told me to sit on the right edge of the mat. He then put a piece of charcoal in the pipe and ha nded it to me. I took i t. I was amazed at the silent forcefulness with which don J uan had steered me. I could not think of anything to say. I had no m ore arguments. I was convinced that I was not afraid, but only unw illing to lose my clarity. \"Puff, puff,\" he ordered me gently. \"Just one bowl this time.\" I sucked on t he pipe and he ard the chirping of the mixture catching on f ire. I felt an instantaneous coat of ice inside my mouth and m y nos e. I took a nother puff and the coating extended to my chest. When I had taken the last puff I felt that the entire inside of my body w as coated with a peculiar sensation of cold warmth. Don Juan took t he pipe away from me and tapped the bowl on hi s palm to loosen the residue. Then, as he always does, he wet his finger with saliva and rubbed it inside the bowl. My body w as num b, but I could move. I changed pos itions to sit more comfortably. \"What's going to happen?\" I asked. I had some difficulty voc alizing. Don Juan very carefully put his pipe inside its sheath and rolled it up in a long pi ece of cloth. Then he sat up straight, facing m e. I felt dizzy; my eyes were closing involuntarily. Don Juan shook m e vigorously and or dered me to stay awake. He said I knew very well that if I fell asleep I would die. That jolted me. It occurred to me that don J uan was probably just saying that to keep me awake, but on the other hand, it also occurred to me that he might be right. I opened my eyes as wide as I could and that made don J uan laugh. H e said that I had to wait for a while and ke ep my eyes open all the time and that at a given moment I would be able to see the guardian of the other world. I felt a very annoyi ng he at all over my body; I tried to change positions, but I could not move any m ore. I wanted to talk to don J uan; the words seemed to be so deep inside of me that I could not bring them out. Then I tumbled on m y left side and found m yself looking at don J uan from the floor. He leaned ove r and or dered me in a whisper not to look a t him but to stare fixedly at a point on m y mat which was directly in front of my eyes. He said that I had to look w ith one eye, my left eye, and that sooner or later I would see the guardian. I fixed my stare on the spot he had poi nted to but I did not see anything. A t a certain moment, how ever, I noticed a gnat flying in front of my eyes. It landed on t he mat. I followed its movements. It came very close to me, so close that my visual perception bl urred. And then, all of a sudden, I felt as if I had stood up. I t was a very puzzling sensation that deserved some ponde ring, but there was no time for that. I had the total sensation that I was looking straight onward from my usual eye level, and what I saw shook up t he last fiber of my being. T here is no ot her way to describe the emotional jolt I experienced. Right there facing m e, a short distance away, was a gigantic, monstrous animal. A truly monstrous thing! Never in the wildest fantasies of fiction ha d I encountered anything like it. I looked at it in complete, utmost bewilderment. The first thing I really not iced was its size. I thought , for some reason, that it must be close to a hundr ed feet 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"tall. It seemed to be standing erect, although I could not figure out how it stood. N ext, I noticed that it had wings, two short, wide wings. At that point I became aware that I insisted on e xamining the animal as if it were an ordinary sight; that is, I looked at it. However, I could not really look a t it in the way I was accustomed to looking. I realized that I was, rather, noticing things about it, as if the picture were becoming m ore clear as parts were added. Its body w as covered with tufts of black hair. It had a long m uzzle and was drooling. Its eyes were bulgy and round, l ike two enormous white balls. Then it began to beat its wings. It was not the flapping m otion of a bird's wings, but a kind of flickering, vibratory tremor. It gained speed and be gan circling in front of me; it was not flying, but rather skidding with astoundi ng speed and agility, just a few inches above the ground. F or a moment I found m yself engrossed in watching it move. I thought that its movements were ugly and ye t its speed and easiness were superb. It circled twice in front of me, vibrating its wings, and whatever was drooling out of its mouth flew in all directions. Then it turned around a nd skidded away at an incredible speed unt il it disappeared in the distance. I stared fixedly in the direction it had gone because there was nothing else I could do. I had a most peculiar sensa- tion of being incapable of organizing m y thought s coherently. I could not move away. It was as if I were glued to the spot. Then I saw something like a cloud i n the distance; an instant later the gigantic beast was circling again at full speed in front of me. Its wings cut closer and closer to my eyes until they hit me. I felt that its wings had actually hit whatever part of me was there. I yelled with all my might in the midst of one of the most excruciating pains I have ever had. The next thing I knew I was seated on m y mat and don J uan was rubbing m y forehead. He rubbed my arms and legs with leaves, then he took m e to an irrigation di tch behind hi s hous e, took of f my clothes, and submerged me completely, then pul led me out and submerged me over and ove r again. As I lay on t he shallow bottom of the irrigation di tch, don J uan pul led up m y left foot from time to time and tapped the sole gently. After a while I felt a ticklishness. He noticed it and said that I was all right. I put on m y clothes and we returned to his hous e. I sat down again on m y straw mat and tried to talk, but I felt I could not concentrate on w hat I wanted to say, although m y thought s were very clear. I was amazed to realize how much concentration was necessary to talk. I also not iced that in order to say something I had to stop looking at things. I had the impression that I was entangled at a very deep level and when I wanted to talk I had to surface like a diver; I had to ascend as if pulled by m y words. Twice I went as far as clearing m y throat in a fashion which was perfectly ordinary. I could have said then whatever I wanted to, but I did not . I preferred to remain at the strange level of silence where I could just look. I had the feeling that I was beginning to tap what don J uan had called \"seeing\" and that made me very happy. Afterwards don J uan gave me some soup a nd tortillas and or dered me to eat. I was able to eat without any trouble and without losing what I thought to be my \"power of seeing.\" I focused my gaze on everything around me. I was convinced I could \"see\" everything, and ye t the world looked the same to the best of my assessment. I struggled to \"see\" until it was quite dark. I finally got tired and lay dow n and went to sleep. I woke up w hen don J uan covered me with a blanket. I had a headache and I was sick to my stomach. After a while I felt better and slept soundl y unt il the next day. In the morning I was myself again. I asked don J uan eagerly, \"What happened to me?\" Don Juan laughed coyly. \"You went to look f or the keeper and of course you f ound i t,\" he said. \"But what was it, don J uan?\" \"The guardian, the keeper, the sentry of the other world,\" don J uan said factually. I intended to relate to him the details of the portentous and ugl y beast, but he disregarded my attempt, saying that my experience was nothing special, that any m an could do t hat. I told him that the guardian had been such a shock to me that I really had not yet been able to think about it. Don Juan laughed and m ade fun of what he called an ove rdramatic bent of my nature. \"That thing, w hatever it was, hurt me,\" I said. \"It was as real as you a nd I.\" \"Of course it was real. It caused you pa in, didn't it?\" As I recollected my experience I grew more excited. Don Juan told me to calm down. Then he asked me if I 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"had really been afraid of it; he stressed the word \"really.\" \"I was petrified,\" I said. \"Never in my life have I experienced such an awesome fright.\" \"Come on,\" he said, laughing. \"You were not that afraid.\" \"I swear to you,\" I said with genuine fervor, \"that if I could have moved I would have run hys terically.\" He found m y statement very funny a nd roared with laughter. \"What was the point of making m e see that monstrosity, don J uan?\" He became serious and ga zed at me. \"That was the guardian,\" he said. \"If you w ant to see you m ust overcome the guardian.\" \"But how am I to ove rcome it, don J uan? It is perhaps a hundr ed feet tall.\" Don Juan laughed so hard that tears rolled dow n his cheeks. \"Why don' t you l et me tell you w hat I saw, so there won't be any m isunderstanding?\" I said. \"If that makes you ha ppy, go a head, tell me.\" I narrated everything I could remember, but that did not seem to change his mood. \"Still, that's nothing ne w,\" he said, smiling. \"But how do you e xpect me to ove rcome a thing like that? With what?\" He was silent for quite a while. Then he turned to me and said, \"You were not afraid, not really. You were hurt, but you w ere not afraid.\" He reclined against some bundl es and put his arms behind hi s head. I thought he had dropped the subject. \"You know ,\" he said suddenly, looking at the roof of the ramada, \"every man can see the guardian. And the guardian is sometimes for some of us an awesome beast as high as the sky. Y ou're lucky; for you i t was only a hundr ed feet tall. And ye t its secret is so simple.\" He paused for a moment and hum med a Mexican song. \"The guardian of the other world is a gnat,\" he said slowly, as if he were measuring the effect of his words. \"I beg your pardon.\" \"The guardian of the other world is a gnat,\" he repeated. \"What you e ncountered yesterday was a gnat; and that little gnat will keep you a way unt il you ove rcome it.\" For a moment I did not want to believe what don J uan was saying, but upon r ecollecting the sequence of my vision I had to admit that at a certain moment I was looking at a gnat, and an instant later a sort of mirage had taken place and I was looking at the beast. \"But how could a gnat hurt me, don J uan?\" I asked, truly bewildered. \"It was not a gnat when it hurt you,\" he said, \"it was the guardian of the other world. Perhaps some day you will have the courage to ove rcome it. Not now, though; now it is a hundr ed-foot-tall drooling be ast. But there is no poi nt in talking about it. It's no feat to stand in front of it, so if you w ant to know more about it, find the guardian again.\" Two days later, on N ovember 11, I smoked don J uan's mixture again. I had asked don J uan to let me smoke once more to find the guardian. I had not asked him on the spur of the moment, but after long de liberation. M y curiosity about the guardian was disproportionately greater than my fear, or the discomfort of losing m y clarity. The procedure was the same. Don Juan filled the pipe bowl once and when I had finished the entire contents he cleaned it and put it away. The effect was markedly slower; when I began to feel a bit dizzy don J uan came to me and, hol ding m y head in his hands, helped me to lie down on m y left side. He told me to stretch my legs and relax and then helped me put my right arm in front of my body, a t the level of my chest. He turned my hand so the palm was pressing against the mat, and let my weight rest on it. I did not do anything to help or hinder him, for I did not know what be was doing. H e sat in front of me and told me not to be concerned with anything. H e said that the guardian was going to come, and that I had a ringside seat to see it. He also told me, in a casual way, that the guardian could cause great pain, but that there was one way to avert it. He said that two days before he had made me sit up w hen he judged I had had enough. H e pointed to my right arm and said that he had deliberately put it in that position so 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"I could use it as a lever to pus h myself up w henever I wanted to. By the time he had finished telling m e all that, my body w as quite num b. I wanted to call to his attention the fact that it would be impossible for me to pus h myself up be cause I had lost control of my muscles. I tried to vocalize the words but I could not . He seemed to have anticipated me, how ever, and explained that the trick was in the will. He urged me to remember the time, years before, when I had first smoked the mushrooms. On that occasion I had fallen to the ground a nd sprung up t o my feet again by a n act of what he called, at that time, my ''will\"; I had \"thought myself up.\" He said that was in fact the only pos sible way to get up. What he was saying was useless to me because I did not remember what I had really done years before. I had an ove rwhelming sense of despair and closed my eyes. Don Juan grabbed me by the hair, shook m y head vigorously, and or dered me imperatively not to close my eyes. I not only ope ned my eyes but I did something I thought was astonishing. I actually said, \"I don't know how I got up that time.\" I was startled. There was something ve ry monotonous about the rhythm of my voi ce, but it was plainly my voice, and ye t I hone stly believed I could not have said that, because a minute before I had been incapable of speaking. I looked at don J uan. He turned his face to one side and laughed. \"I didn't say that,\" I said. And again I was startled by m y voi ce. I felt elated. Speaking unde r these conditions became an exhilarating process. I wanted to ask don J uan to explain my talking, but I found I was again incapable of uttering one single word. I struggled fiercely to voi ce my thought s, but it was useless. I gave up and at that moment, almost involun- tarily, I said, \"Who's talking, w ho's talking?\" That question m ade don J uan laugh s o hard that at one point he bobbe d on hi s side. Apparently it was possible for me to say simple things, as long a s I knew exactly what I wanted to say. \"Am I talking? Am I talking?\" I asked. Don Juan told me that if I did not stop hor sing around he was going to go out and lie down unde r the ramada and leave me alone with my clowning. \"It isn't clowning,\" I said. I was very serious about that. My thought s were very clear; my body, how ever, was num b; I did not feel it. I was not suffocated, as I had onc e been in the past unde r similar conditions; I was comfortable because I could not feel anything; I had no c ontrol whatever over my vol untary system and ye t I could talk. The thought occurred to me that if I could talk I could probably stand up a s don J uan had said. \"Up,\" I said in English, and in a flicker of an eye I was up. Don Juan shook hi s head in disbelief and walked out of the hous e. \"Don Juan!\" I called out three times. He came back. \"Put me down,\" I said. \"Put your self down,\" he said. \"You seem to be doing ve ry well.\" I said, \"Down,\" and suddenly I lost sight of the room. I could not see anything. A fter a moment the room and don J uan came back again into my field of vision. I thought that I must have lain dow n with my face to the ground a nd he had grabbed me by the hair and lifted my head. \"Thank you,\" I said in a very slow monotone. \"You are welcome,\" he replied, mocking m y tone of voice, and ha d another attack of laughter. Then he took s ome leaves and be gan rubbing m y arms and feet with them. \"What are you doi ng?\" I asked, \"I am rubbing you,\" he said, imitating m y painful monotone. His body c onvul sed with laughter. His eyes were shiny and ve ry friendly. I liked him. I felt that don J uan was compassionate and fair and funny. I could not laugh w ith him, but I would have liked to. Another feeling of ex- 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"hilaration invaded me and I laughed; it was such an awful sound t hat don J uan was taken aback for an instant. \"I better take you t o the ditch,\" he said, \"or you're going to kill your self clowning.\" He put me up on m y feet and m ade me walk around t he room. Little by little I began to feel my feet, and m y legs, and finally my entire body. M y ears were bursting with a strange pressure. It was like the sensation of a leg or an arm that has fallen asleep. I felt a tremendous weight on the back of my neck and unde r the scalp on t he top of my head. Don Juan rushed me to the irrigation di tch at the back of his hous e; he dum ped me there fully clothed. The cold water reduced the pressure and the pain, by de grees, until it was all gone . I changed my clothes in the hous e and sat down and I again felt the same kind of aloofness, the same desire to stay qui et. I noticed this time, how ever, that it was not clarity of mind, or a power to focus; rather, it was a sort of melancholy and a phys ical fatigue. Finally I fell asleep. November 12,1968 This morning don J uan and I went to the nearby hi lls to collect plants. We walked about six miles on extremely rough t errain. I became very tired. We sat down to rest, at my initiative, and he began a conversation, saying that he was pleased with my progress. \"I know now that it was I who talked,\" I said, \"but at the time I could have sworn it was someone else.\" \"It was you, of course,\" he said. \"How come I couldn't recognize myself?\" \"That's what the little smoke does. One can talk and not notice it; or one can move thousands of miles and not notice that either. That's also how one can go t hrough t hings. The little smoke removes the body a nd one is free, like the wind; better than the wind, the wind can be stopped by a rock or a wall or a mountain. The little smoke makes one as free as the air; perhaps even freer, the air can be locked in a tomb and be come stale, but with the aid of the little smoke one cannot be stopped or locked in.\" Don Juan's words unleashed a mixture of euphor ia and doubt . I felt an ove rwhelming une asiness, a sensation of unde fined gui lt. \"Then one can really do a ll those things, don J uan?\" \"What do you t hink? You would rather think you' re crazy, wouldn't you? \" he said cuttingly. \"Well, it's easy for you t o accept all those things. For me it's impossible.\" \"It's not easy for me. I don't have any m ore privileges than you. T hose things are equally hard for you or for me or for anyone else to accept.\" \"But you a re at hom e with all this, don J uan.\" \"Yes, but it cost me plenty. I had to struggle, perhaps more than you e ver will. You ha ve a baffling way of getting everything to work for you. Y ou ha ve no idea how hard I had to toil to do w hat you di d yesterday. You have something that helps you e very inch of the way. There is no ot her possible explanation for the manner in which you l earn about the powers. You di d it before with Mescalito, now you ha ve done it with the little smoke. You should concentrate on the fact that you ha ve a great gift, and leave other considerations on the side.\" \"You m ake it sound s o easy, but it isn't. I'm torn inside.\" \"You'll be in one piece again soon e nough. Y ou ha ve not taken care of your body, f or one thing. Y ou're too fat. I didn't want to say anything to you be fore. One must always let others do w hat they have to do. Y ou were away for years. I told you t hat you w ould come back, though, a nd you di d. The same thing ha ppened to me. I quit for five and a half years.\" \"Why di d you s tay away, don J uan?\" \"For the same reason you di d. I didn't like it.\" \"Why di d you c ome back?\" \"For the same reason you ha ve come back your self, because there is no ot her way to live.\" That statement had a great impact on m e, for I had found m yself thinking that perhaps there was no ot her way to live. I had never voiced this thought to anyone , yet don J uan had surmised it correctly. After a very long s ilence I asked him, 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"\"What did I do ye sterday, don J uan?\" \"You got up w hen you w anted to.\" \"But I don't know how I did that.\" \"It takes tune to perfect that technique.

That's the point, I really don' t.\" \"Of course you do.\" \"Don Juan, I assure you, I swear to you . . .\" He did not let me finish; he got up and walked away. Later on w e talked again about the guardian of the other world. \"If I believe that whatever I have experienced is actu ally real,\" I said, \"then the guardian is a gigantic creature that can cause unbe lievable phys ical pain; and if I believe that one can actually travel enormous distances by an act of will, then it's logical to conclude that I could also will the monster to disappear. Is that correct?\" \"Not exactly,\" he said. \"You cannot will the guardian to disappear. Your will can stop it from harming you, though. O f course if you e ver accomplish that, the road is open to you. Y ou can actually go by t he guardian and there's nothing that it can do, not even whirl around m adly.\" \"How can I accomplish that?\" \"You already know how. All you ne ed now is practice.\" I told him that we were having a misunderstanding that stemmed from our differences in perceiving the world. I said that for me to know something m eant that I had to be fully aware of what I was doing and that I could repeat what I knew at will, but in this case I was neither aware of what I had done unde r the influence of the smoke, nor could I repeat it if my life depended on i t. Don Juan looked at me inquisitively. He seemed to be amused by w hat I was saying. H e took of f his hat and scratched his temples as he does when he wants to pretend be wilderment. \"You really know how to talk and say not hing, don' t you? \" he said laughing. \"I have told you, you ha ve to have an unbe nding intent in order to become a man of know ledge. But you s eem to have an unbe nding intent to confuse your self with riddles. You insist on explaining everything as if the whole world were composed of things that can be explained. Now you a re confronted with the guardian and with the problem of moving by us ing your will. Has it ever occurred to you t hat only a few things in this world can be explained your way? When I say that the guardian is really blocking your passing and could actually knoc k the devil out of you, I know what I mean. When I say that one can move by one 's will, I also know what I mean. I wanted to teach you, l ittle by little, how to move, but then I realized that you know how to do i t even though you s ay you don' t.\" \"But I really don' t know how,\" I protested. \"You do, you f ool,\" he said sternly, and then smiled. \"It reminds me of the time when someone put that kid Julio on a harvesting m achine; he knew how to run it although he had never done it before.\" \"I know what you m ean, don J uan; however, I still feel that I could not do it again, because I am not sure of what I did.\" \"A phony s orcerer tries to explain everything in the world with explanations he is not sure about,\" he said, \"and so everything is witchcraft. But then you' re no be tter. You also want to explain everything your way but you're not sure of your explanations either.\" 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"8 Don Juan asked me abruptly if I was planning to leave for hom e during the weekend. I said I intended to leave Monday morning. W e were sitting unde r his ramada around m idday on S aturday, January 18, 1969, t aking a rest after a long w alk in the nearby hi lls. Don Juan got up and went into the hous e. A few moments later he called me inside. He was sitting in the middle of his room and ha d placed my straw mat in front of his. He motioned me to sit down and without saying a word he unwrapped his pipe, took i t out of its sheath, filled its bowl with his smoking m ixture, and lit it. He had even brought into his room a clay tray filled with small charcoals. He did not ask me whether I was willing to smoke. He just handed me the pipe and told me to puf f. I did not hesitate. Don Juan had apparently assessed my mood c orrectly; my ove rwhelming curiosity about the guardian must have been obvi ous to him. I did not need any coaxing and eagerly smoked the entire bowl. The reactions I had were identical to those I had had before. Don Juan also proceeded in very much the same manner. This time, how ever, instead of helping m e to do i t, he just told me to prop m y right arm on the mat and lie down on m y left side. He suggested that I should make a fist if that would give me a better leverage. I did make a fist with my right hand, be cause I found i t was easier than turning m y palm against the floor while lying with my weight on it I was not sleepy; I felt very warm for a while, then I lost all feeling. Don Juan lay dow n on hi s side facing m e; his right forearm rested on hi s elbow and pr opped his head up l ike a pillow. Everything was perfectly placid, even my body, w hich by t hen lacked tactile sensations. I felt very con- tent. \"It's nice,\" I said. Don Juan got up hur riedly. \"Don't you da re start with this crap,\" he said forcefully. \"Don't talk. You'll waste every bit of energy talking, and then the guardian will mash you dow n, like you w ould smash a gnat.\" He must have thought that his simile was funny be cause he began to laugh, but he stopped suddenly. \"Don't talk, please don't talk,\" he said with a serious look on hi s face. \"I wasn't about to say anything,\" I said, and I really did not want to say that. Don Juan got up. I saw him walking away toward the back of his hous e. A moment later I noticed that a gnat had landed on m y mat and that filled me with a kind of anxiety I had never experienced before. It was a mixture of elation, anguish, and fear. I was totally aware that something transcendental was about to unf old in front of me; a gnat who gua rded the other world. It was a ludicrous thought ; I felt like laughing out loud, but then I realized that my elation was distracting m e and I was going to miss a transition pe riod I wanted to clarify. In my previous attempt to see the guardian I had looked at the gnat first with my left eye, and then I felt that I had stood up and looked at it with bot h eyes, but I was not aware how that transition ha d occurred. I saw the gnat whirling around on t he mat in front of my face and realized that I was looking at it with bot h eyes. It came very close; at a given moment I could not see it with bot h eyes any longer and shifted the view to my left eye, which was level with the ground. T he instant I changed focus I also felt that I had straightened my body t o a fully vertical position and I was looking at an unbelievably enormous animal. It was brilliantly black. Its front was covered with long, bl ack, insidious hair, which looked like spikes coming through t he cracks of some slick, shiny scales. The hair was actually arranged in tufts. Its body w as massive, thick and round. I ts wings were wide and short in comparison to the length of its body. I t had two white, bulging eyes and a long m uzzle. This time it looked more like an alligator. It seemed to have long e ars, or perhaps horns, and it was drooling. I strained myself to fix my gaze on it and then became fully aware that I could not look a t it in the same way I ordinarily look a t things. I had a strange thought ; looking at the guardian's body I felt that every single part of it was independently alive, as the eyes of men are alive. I realized then for the first tune in my life that the eyes were the only part of a man that could show, to me, whether or not he was alive. The guardian, on t he other hand, had a \"million eyes.\" I thought this was a remarkable finding. B efore this experience I had speculated on t he similes that could 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"describe the \"distortions\" that rendered a gnat as a gigantic beast; and I had thought that a good s imile was \"as if looking at an insect through t he magnifying lens of a microscope.\" But that was not so. Apparently viewing the guardian was much more complex than looking at a magnified insect. The guardian began to whirl in front of me. At one moment it stopped and I felt it was looking at me. I noticed then that it made no sound. T he dance of the guardian was silent. The awesomeness was in its appearance: its bulging eyes; its horrendous mouth; its drooling; its insidious hair; and above all its incredible size. I watched very closely the way it moved its wings, how it made them vibrate without sound. I watched how it skidded ove r the ground l ike a monum ental ice skater. Looking at that nightmarish creature in front of me, I actually felt elated. I really believed I had discovered the secret of overpowering it. I thought the guardian was only a moving pi cture on a silent screen; it could not harm me; it only looked terrifying. The guardian was standing still, facing m e; suddenly it fluttered its wings and turned around. I ts back looked like brilliantly colored armor; its shine was dazzling but the hue was nauseating; it was my unf avorable color. The guardian remained with its back turned to me for a while and then, fluttering its wings, again skidded out of sight. I was confronted with a very strange dilemma. I honestly believed that I had ove rpowered it by realizing that it presented onl y a picture of wrath. My belief was perhaps due to don J uan's insistence that I knew more than I was willing to admit. At any rate, I felt I had ove rcome the guardian and the path was free. Yet I did not know how to proceed. Don Juan had not told me what to do i n such a case. I tried to turn and look be hind m e, but I was unable to move. However, I could see very well over the major part of a 180- degree range in front of my eyes. And what I saw was a cloudy, pa le-yellow horizon; it seemed gaseous. A sort of lemon hue uniformly covered all I could see. It seemed that I was on a plateau filled with vapors of sulphur. Suddenly the guardian appeared again at a point on the horizon. It made a wide circle before stopping in front of me; its mouth was wide open, like a huge cavern; it had no t eeth. It vibrated its wings for an instant and then it charged at me. It actually charged at me like a bull, and with its gigantic wings it swung a t my eyes. I screamed with pain and then I flew up, or rather I felt I had ejected myself up, a nd went soaring be yond t he guardian, beyond t he yellowish plateau, into another world, the world of men, and I found m yself standing in the middle of don J uan's room. Januar y 19,1969 \"I really thought I had ove rpowered the guardian,\" I said to don J uan. \"You m ust be kidding,\" he said. Don Juan had not spoken one word to me since the day before and I did not mind it I had been immersed in a sort of reverie and again I had felt that if I looked intently I would be able to \"see.\" But I did not see anything that was different. Not talking, how ever, had relaxed me tremendous ly. Don Juan asked me to recount the sequence of my experience, and what particularly interested him was the hue I had seen on t he guardian's back. Don Juan sighed and seemed to be really concerned. \"You were lucky that the color was on the guardian's back,\" he said with a serious face. \"Had it been on t he front part of its body, or worse yet, on i ts head, you w ould be dead by now . You m ust not try to see the guardian ever again. It's not your temperament to cross that plain; yet I was convinced that you c ould go t hrough i t. But let's not talk about it any m ore. This was only one of a variety of roads.\" I detected an una ccustomed heaviness in don J uan's tone. \"What will happen to me if I try to see the guardian again?\" \"The guardian will take you a way,\" he said, \"It will pick you up i n its mouth and carry you i nto that plain and leave you t here forever. It is obvi ous that the guardian kne w that it is not your temperament and warned you t o stay away.” \"How do you t hink the guardian kne w that?\" Don Juan gave me a long, s teadfast look. H e tried to say something, but gave up as though he was unable to find the right words. 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"\"I always fall for your questions,\" he said, smiling. \"You were not really thinking when you a sked me that, were you? \" I protested and reaffirmed that it puzzled me that the guardian kne w my temperament. Don Juan had a strange glint in his eye when he said, \"And you ha d not even mentioned anything about your temperament to the guardian, had you? \" His tone was so comically serious that we both laughed. After a while, how ever, he said that the guardian, being the keeper, the watchman of that world, kne w many secrets that a brujo was entitled to share. \"That's one way a brujo gets to see\" he said. \"But that will not be your dom ain, so there is no poi nt in talking about it.\" \"Is smoking the only way to see the guardian?\" I asked. \"No. You could also see it without it. There are scores of people who could do t hat. I prefer the smoke because it is more effective and less dangerous to one self. If you t ry to see the guardian without the aid of the smoke, chances are that you m ay delay in getting out of its way. In your case, for instance, it is obvi ous that the guardian was warning you w hen it turned its back so you w ould look a t your enemy color. Then it went away; but when it came back you w ere still there, so it charged at you. Y ou were prepared, how ever, and jumped. The little smoke gave you t he protection you ne eded; had you gone into that world without its aid you w ouldn't have been able to extricate your self from the guardian's grip.\" \"Why not ?\" \"Your movements would have been too slow. To survive in that world you ne ed to be as fast as lightning. It was my mistake to leave the room, but I didn't want you t o talk any m ore. You are a blabbermouth, so you t alk even against your desire. Had I been there with you I would've pulled your head up. Y ou jumped up by your self, which was even better; however, I would rather not run a risk like that; the guardian is not something you c an fool around w ith.\" 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"9 For three months don J uan systematically avoided talking about the guardian. I paid him four visits during these months; he involved me in running errands for him every time, and when I had performed the errands he simply told me to go hom e.

I told him that he was doing something incongruous to me; I was ready to learn and ye t he did not even want me around. I had had to struggle very hard to ove rcome my aversion to using hi s hallucinogenic mushrooms and I felt, as he had said himself, that I had no time to lose. Don Juan patiently listened to my complaints. \"You're too weak,\" he said. \"You hur ry when you s hould wait, but you w ait when you s hould hur ry. You think too m uch. Now you t hink that there is no time to waste. A while back you t hought you di dn't want to smoke any m ore. Your life is too da mn loose; you're not tight enough t o meet the little smoke.

Y ou thought about the guardian and thus you c ouldn't overcome it. \"First you m ust live like a warrior. I think you unde rstand that very well.\" I wanted to interject something in my defense, but he gestured with his hand to be quiet. \"Your life is fairly tight,\" he continued. \"In fact, your life is tighter than Pablito's or Nestor's, Genaro's apprentices, and ye t they see and you don' t. Your life is tighter than Eligio's and he 'll probably see before you do. This baffles me. Even Genaro cannot get over that. You've faithfully carried out everything I have told you t o do. Everything that my benefactor taught me, in the first stage of learning, I have passed on t o you. T he rule is right, the steps cannot be changed. You ha ve done everything one has to do a nd ye t you don' t see; but to those who see, like Genaro, you a ppear as though you see. I rely on t hat and I am fooled. You always turn around a nd behave like an idiot who doe sn't see, which of course is right for you.\" Don Juan's words distressed me profoundl y. I don't know why but I was close to tears. I began to talk about my childhood a nd a wave of self-pity enveloped me. Don Juan stared at me for a brief moment and then moved his eyes away. It was a penetrating gl ance. I felt he had actually grabbed me with his eyes. I had the sensation of two fingers gently clasping m e and I acknow ledged a weird agitation, an itching, a pleasant despair in the area of my solar plexus. I became aware of my abdom inal region. I sensed its heat. I could not speak coherently any more and I mumbled, then stopped talking altogether. \"Perhaps it's the promise,\" don J uan said after a long pa use. \"I beg your pardon.\" \"A promise you onc e made, long a go.\" \"What promise?\" \"Maybe you c an tell me that. You do r emember it, don' t you? \" \"I don't.\" \"You pr omised something ve ry important once. I thought that perhaps your promise was keeping you f rom seeing.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"I'm talking about a promise you m ade! You m ust remember it.\" \"If you know what the promise was, why don' t you t ell me, don J uan?\" \"No. It won't do any good t o tell you.\" \"Was it a promise I made to myself?\" 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"For a moment I thought he might be referring to my resolution to qui t the apprenticeship. \"No. This is something that took pl ace a long t ime ago,\" he said. I laughed because I was certain don J uan was playing some sort of game with me. I felt mischievous. I had a sensation of elation at the idea that I could fool don J uan, who, I was convinced, kne w as little as I did about the alleged promise. I was sure he was fishing in the dark and trying to improvise. The idea of hum oring hi m delighted me. \"Was it something I promised to my grandpa?\" \"No,\" he said, and hi s eyes glittered. \"Neither was it something you pr omised to your little grandma.\" The ludicrous intonation he gave to the word \"grandma\" made me laugh. I thought don J uan was setting some sort of trap for me, but I was willing to play the game to the end. I began enumerating all the possible individuals to whom I could have promised something of great importance. He said no t o each. Then he steered the conversation to my childhood. \"Why was your childhood s ad?\" he asked with a serious expression. I told him that my childhood ha d not really been sad, but perhaps a bit difficult. \"Everybody f eels that way,\" he said, looking at me again. \"I too was very unha ppy a nd afraid when I was a child. To be an Indian is hard, very hard. But the memory of that time no longer has meaning for me, beyond t hat it was hard. I had ceased to think about the hardship of my life even before I had learned to see.\" \"I don't think about my childhood e ither,\" I said. \"Why doe s it make you s ad, then? Why do you w ant to weep?\" \"I don't know . Perhaps when I think of myself as a child I feel sorry for myself and for all my fellow men. I feel helpless and sad.\" He looked at me fixedly and again my abdom inal region registered the weird sensation of two gentle fingers clasping it. I moved my eyes away and then glanced back at him. He was looking into the distance, past me; his eyes were foggy, out of focus. \"It was a promise of your childhood,\" he said after a moment's silence. \"What did I promise?\" He did not answer. His eyes were closed. I smiled involuntarily; I knew he was feeling hi s way in the dark; however, I had lost some of my original impetus to hum or him. \"I was a skinny c hild,\" he went on, \" and I was always afraid.\" \"So was I,\" I said. \"What I remember the most is the terror and sadness that fell upon m e when the Mexican soldiers killed my mother,\" he said softly, as if the memory was still painful. \"She was a poor and hum ble Indian. Perhaps it was better that her life was over then. I wanted to be killed with her, because I was a child. But the soldiers picked me up and be at me. When I grabbed ont o my mother's body t hey hit my fingers with a horsewhip and br oke them. I didn't feel any pa in, but I couldn't grasp any m ore, and then they dragged me away.\" He stopped talking. H is eyes were still closed and I could detect a very slight tremor in his lips. A profound sadness began to ove rtake me. Images of my own childhood s tarted to flood m y mind. \"How old were you, don J uan?\" I asked, just to offset the sadness in me. \"Maybe seven. That was the time of the great Yaqui wars. The Mexican soldiers came upon us unexpectedly while my mother was cooking some food. S he was a helpless woman. They killed her for no reason at all. It doesn't make any di fference that she died that way, not really, and ye t for me it does. I cannot tell myself why, though; it just does. I thought they had killed my father too, but they hadn't. He was wounde d. Later on they put us in a tram like cattle and closed the door . For days they kept us there in the dark, like animals. They kept us alive with bits of food t hey threw into the wagon f rom time to time. \"My father died of his wounds in that wagon. H e became delirious with pain and fever and went on telling me that I had to survive. He kept on telling m e that until the very last moment of his life. \"The people took c are of me; they gave me food; an old woman curer fixed the broken bone s of my hand. And as you c an see, I lived. Life has been neither good nor bad to me; life has been hard. Life is hard and for a 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"child it is sometimes horror itself.\" We did not speak for a very long t ime. Perhaps an hour went by in complete silence. I had very confusing feelings. I was somewhat dejected and ye t I could not tell why. I experienced a sense of remorse. A while before I had been willing to hum or don J uan, but he had suddenly turned the tables with his direct account. It had been simple and concise and ha d produced a strange feeling in me. The idea of a child unde rgoing pa in had always been a touchy subject for me. In an instant my feelings of empathy for don J uan gave way to a sensation of disgust with myself. I had actually taken not es, as if don J uan's life were merely a clinical case. I was on the verge of ripping up m y not es when don J uan poke d my calf with his toe to attract my attention. H e said he was \"seeing\" a light of violence around m e and wondered whether I was going to start beating hi m. His laughter was a delightful break. He said that I was given to out bursts of violent behavior but that I was not really mean and that most of the time the violence was against myself. \"You're right, don J uan,\" I said. \"Of course,\" he said, laughing. He urged me to talk about my childhood. I began to tell him about my years of fear and loneliness and got involved in describing to him what I thought to be my ove rwhelming struggle to survive and m aintain my spirit. He laughed at the metaphor of \"maintaining m y spirit.\" I talked for a long t ime. He listened with a serious expression. T hen, at a given moment his eyes \"clasped\" me again and I stopped talking. A fter a moment's pause he said that nobody ha d ever hum iliated me and that was the reason I was not really mean. \"You ha ven't been defeated yet,\" he said. He repeated the statement four or five times so I felt obliged to ask him what he meant by that. He explained that to be defeated was a condition of life which was unavoidable. Men were either victorious or defeated and, de pending on t hat, they became persecutors or victims. These two conditions were prevalent as long a s one did not \"see\"; \"seeing\" dispelled the illusion of victory, or defeat, or suffering. H e added that I should learn to \"see\" while I was victorious to avoid ever having the memory of being humiliated. I protested that I was not and ha d never been victorious at anything; and that my life was, if anything, a defeat. He laughed and threw his hat on the floor. \"If your life is such a defeat, step on m y hat,\" he dared me in jest. I sincerely argued my poi nt. Don Juan became serious. His eyes squinted to a fine slit. He said that I thought my life was a defeat for reasons other than defeat itself. Then in a very qui ck and thoroughl y une xpected manner he took m y head in his hands by pl acing hi s palms against my temples. His eyes became fierce as he looked into mine. Out of fright I took a n involuntary deep breath through m y mouth. He let my head go a nd reclined against the wall, still gazing at me. He had performed his movements with such a speed that by the time he had relaxed and reclined comfortably against the wall, I was still in the middle of my deep breath. I felt dizzy, ill at ease. \"I see a little boy c rying,\" don J uan said after a pause. He repeated it various times as if I did not unde rstand. I had the feeling he was talking about me as a little boy c rying, so I did not really pay attention to it. \"Hey!\" he said, demanding m y full concentration. \"I see a little boy c rying.\" I asked him if that boy w as me. He said no. T hen I asked him if it was a vision of my life or just a memory of his own life. He did not answer. \"I see a little boy,\" he continued saying. \"And he is crying and crying.\" \"Is he a boy I know ?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" \"Is he my little boy? \" \"No.\" \"Is he crying now ?\" \"He's crying now ,\" he said with conviction. I thought don J uan was having a vision of someone I knew who was a little boy a nd who was at that very 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"moment crying. I voiced the names of all the children I knew, but he said those children were irrelevant to my promise and the child who was crying was very important to it. Don Juan's statements seemed to be incongruous. He had said that I had promised something to someone during m y childhood, a nd that the child who was crying at that very moment was important to my promise. I told him he was not making sense. He calmly repeated that he \"saw\" a little boy c rying at that moment, and that the little boy w as hurt. I seriously struggled to fit his statements into some sort of orderly pattern, but I could not relate them to anything I was aware of. \"I give up,\" I said, \"because I can't remember making an important promise to anybody, l east of all to a child.\" He squinted his eyes again and said that this particular child who was crying at that precise moment was a child of my childhood. \"He was a child dur ing m y childhood a nd is still crying now ?\" I asked. \"He is a child crying now ,\" he insisted. \"Do you r ealize what you're saying, don J uan?\" \"I do.\" \"It doesn't make sense. How can he be a child now if he was one when I was a child myself?\" \"He's a child and he 's crying now ,\" he said stubbor nly. \"Explain it to me, don J uan.\" \"No. You must explain it to me.\" For the life of me I could not fathom what he was referring to. \"He's crying! He's crying!\" don J uan kept on saying in a mesmerizing tone. \"And he 's huggi ng you now . He's hurt! He's hurt! And he 's looking at you. D o you f eel his eyes? He's kneeling and huggi ng you. H e's younge r than you. H e has come running to you. B ut his arm is broken. Do you f eel his arm? That little boy ha s a nose that looks like a button. Y es! That's a button nos e.\" My ears began to buz z and I lost the sensation of being at don J uan's hous e. The words \"button nos e\" plunged me at once into a scene out of my childhood. I knew a button-nose boy! Don Juan had edged his way into one of the most recondite places of my life. I knew then the promise he was talking about. I had a sensation of elation, of despair, of awe for don J uan and hi s splendid maneuver. How in the devil did he know about the button-nose boy of my childhood? I became so agitated by t he memory don J uan had evoked in me that my power to remember took m e back to a time when I was eight years old. My mother had left two years before and I had spent the most hellish years of my life circulating among m y mother's sisters, who served as dutiful mother surrogates and took c are of me a couple of months at a time. Each of my aunts had a large family, and no m atter how careful and pr otective the aunts were toward me, I had twenty-two cousins to contend with. Their cruelty was sometimes truly bizarre. I felt then that I was surrounde d by e nemies, and in the excruciating ye ars that followed I waged a desperate and sordid war. Finally, through m eans I still do not know to this day, I succeeded in subdui ng all my cousins. I was indeed victorious. I had no m ore competitors who counted. However, I did not know that, nor did I know how to stop m y war, which logically was extended to the school grounds . The classrooms of the rural school where I went were mixed and the first and third grades were separated only by a space between the desks. It was there that I met a little boy w ith a flat nose, who was teased with the nickname \"Button-nose.\" He was a first-grader. I used to pick on hi m haphazardly, not really intending to. But he seemed to like me in spite of everything I did to him. He used to follow me around a nd even kept the secret that I was responsible for some of the pranks that baffled the principal. And ye t I still teased him. One day I deliberate- ly toppled ove r a heavy standing bl ackboard; it fell on hi m; the desk in which he was sitting absorbed some of the impact, but still the blow broke his collarbone. He fell down. I helped him up and saw the pain and fright in his eyes as he looked at me and he ld ont o me. The shock of seeing hi m in pain, with a mangled arm, was more than I could bear. For years I had viciously battled against my cousins and I had won; I had vanquished my foes; I had felt good a nd pow erful up to the moment when the sight of the button-nose little boy c rying de molished my 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"victories. Right there I quit the battle. In whatever way I was capable of, I made a resolution not to win ever again. I thought his arm would have to be cut off, and I promised that if the little boy w as cured I would never again be victorious. I gave up m y victories for him. That was the way I unde rstood i t then. Don Juan had ope ned a festered sore in my life. I felt dizzy, ove rwhelmed. A well of unm itigated sadness beckoned me and I succumbed to it. I felt the weight of my acts on m e. The memory of that little button-nose boy, w hose name was Joaquin, produced in me such a vivid anguish that I wept. I told don J uan of my sadness for that boy w ho ne ver had anything, that little Joaquin who di d not have money to go t o a doctor and whose arm never set properly. And all I had to give him were my childish victories. I felt so ashamed. \"Be in peace, you f unny bi rd,\" don J uan said imperatively. \"You ga ve enough. Y our victories were strong and they were your s. You ga ve enough. N ow you m ust change your promise.\" \"How do I change it? Do I just say so?\" \"A promise like that cannot be changed by j ust saying so. Perhaps very soon you' ll be able to know what to do about changing it. Then perhaps you'll even get to see.\" \"Can you gi ve me any suggestions, don J uan?\" \"You m ust wait patiently, know ing that you're waiting, and know ing what you're waiting for. That is the warrior's way. And if it is a matter of fulfilling your promise then you m ust be aware that you a re fulfilling it. Then a time will come when your waiting will be over and you w ill no longer have to honor your promise. There is nothing you c an do f or that little boy's life. Only he could cancel that act.\" \"But how can he?\" \"By learning to reduce his wants to not hing. A s long a s he thinks that he was a victim, his life will be hell. And as long a s you t hink the same your promise will be valid. What makes us unha ppy i s to want. Yet if we would learn to cut our wants to not hing, the smallest thing we'd get would be a true gift. Be in peace, you m ade a good gi ft to Joaquin. To be poor or wanting is only a thought ; and so is to hate, or to be hungr y, or to be in pain.\" \"I cannot truly believe that, don J uan. How could hunge r and pa in be only thought s?\" \"They are only thought s for me now. That's all I know . I have accomplished that feat. The power to do t hat is all we have, mind you, t o oppos e the forces of our lives; without that power we are dregs, dust in the wind.\" \"I have no doubt that you ha ve done it, don J uan, but how can a simple man like myself or little Joaquin accomplish that?\" \"It is up to us as single individuals to oppos e the forces of our lives. I have said this to you c ountless times: Only a warrior can survive. A warrior know s that he is waiting and what he is waiting for; and while he waits he wants nothing and thus whatever little thing he gets is more than he can take. If he needs to eat he finds a way, because he is not hungr y; if something hur ts his body he finds a way to stop it, because he is not in pain. To be hungr y or to be in pain means that the man has abandone d himself and is no longer a warrior; and the forces of his hunge r and pa in will destroy hi m.\" I wanted to go on a rguing m y poi nt, but I stopped because I realized that by arguing I was making a barrier to protect myself from the devastating force of don J uan's superb feat which had touched me so deeply and with such a power. How did he know ? I thought that perhaps I had told him the story of the button-nose boy dur ing one of my deep states of nonor dinary reality. I did not recollect telling hi m, but my not remembering unde r such conditions was unde rstandable. \"How did you know about my promise, don J uan?\" \"I saw it.\" \"Did you see it when I had taken Mescalito, or when I had smoked your mixture?\" \"I saw it now. Today.\" \"Did you see the whole thing?\" \"There you go a gain. I've told you, t here's no poi nt in talking about what seeing is like. It is nothing.\" I did not pursue the point any longer. Emotionally I was convinced. \"I also made a vow once,\" don J uan said suddenly. The sound of his voice made me jump. \"I promised my father that I would live to destroy hi s assassins. I carried that promise with me for years. Now the promise is 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"changed. I'm no longer interested in destroying anybody. I don't hate the Mexicans. I don't hate anyone . I have learned that the countless paths one traverses in one 's life are all equal. Oppressors and oppr essed meet at the end, and the only thing that prevails is that life was altogether too short for both. Today I feel sad not because my mother and father died the way they did; I feel sad because they were Indians. They lived like Indians and di ed like Indians and ne ver knew that they were, before anything else, men.\" 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"10 I went back to visit don J uan on M ay 30, 1969, a nd bl untly told him that I wanted to take another crack at \"seeing.\" He shook hi s head negatively and laughed, and I felt compelled to protest. He told me I had to be patient and the time was not right, but I dogge dly insisted I was ready. He did not seem annoye d with my nagging requests. He tried, nevertheless, to change the subject. I did not let go and asked him to advise me what to do i n order to ove rcome my impatience. \"You m ust act like a warrior,\" he said. \"How?\" \"One learns to act like a warrior by acting, not by talking.\" \"You said that a warrior thinks about his death. I do that all the time; obvi ously that isn't enough.\" He seemed to have an out burst of impatience and m ade a smacking sound w ith his lips. I told him that I had not meant to make him angry and that if he did not need me there at his hous e, I was ready to go ba ck to Los Angeles. Don Juan patted me gently on t he back and said that he never got angry with me; he had simply assumed I knew what it meant to be a warrior. \"What can I do to live like a warrior?\" I asked. He took of f his hat and scratched his temples. He looked at me fixedly and smiled. \"You like everything spelled out , don' t you? \" \"My mind works that way.\" \"It doesn't have to.\" \"I don't know how to change. That is why I ask you t o tell me exactly what to do t o live like a warrior; if I knew that, I could find a way to adapt myself to it.\" He must have thought my statements were hum orous; he patted me on the back as he laughed. I had the feeling he was going to ask me to leave any m inute, so I quickly sat down on m y straw mat facing him and be gan asking hi m more questions. I wanted to know why I had to wait. He explained that if I were to try to \"see\" in a helter-skelter manner, before I had \"healed the wounds \" I re- ceived battling the guardian, chances were that I would encounter the guardian again even though I was not look- ing for it. Don Juan assured me that no m an in that position would be capable of surviving such an encounter. \"You m ust completely forget the guardian before you c an again embark on t he quest of seeing\" he said. \"How can anyone forget the guardian?\" \"A warrior has to use his will and hi s patience to forget. In fact, a warrior has only his will and hi s patience and with them he builds anything he wants.\" \"But I'm not a warrior.\" \"You ha ve started learning the ways of sorcerers. You ha ve no m ore time for retreats or for regrets. You onl y have time to live like a warrior and work for patience and will, whether you l ike it or not.\" \"How does a warrior work for them?\" Don Juan thought for a long t ime before answering. \"I think there is no w ay of talking about it,\" he finally said. \"Especially about will. Will is something ve ry special. It happens mysteriously. There is no real way of telling how one uses it, except that the results of using the will are astoundi ng. P erhaps the first thing that one should do i s to know that one can develop the will. A warrior know s that and pr oceeds to wait for it. Your mistake is not to know that you a re waiting for your will. \"My benefactor told me that a warrior know s that he is waiting and know s what he is waiting for. In your case, you know that you're waiting. Y ou've been here with me for years, yet you don' t know what you a re waiting for. It is very difficult, if not impossible, for the average man to know what he is waiting for. A warrior, how ever, has no pr oblems; he know s that he is waiting for his will.\" \"What exactly is the will? Is it determination, like the determination of your grandson Lucio to have a motor- cycle?\" \"No,\" don J uan said softly and gi ggled. \"That's not will. Lucio onl y indulges. Will is something else, some- 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"thing ve ry clear and pow erful which can direct our acts. Will is something a man uses, for instance, to win a battle which he, by a ll calculations, should lose.\" \"Then will must be what we call courage,\" I said. \"No. Courage is something else. Men of courage are dependable men, nobl e men perennially surrounde d by people who flock around t hem and admire them; yet very few men of courage have will. Usually they are fearless men who are given to performing da ring common-sense acts; most of the time a courageous man is also fearsome and feared. Will, on t he other hand, ha s to do w ith astonishing feats that defy our common sense.\" \"Is will the control we may have over ourselves?\" I asked. \"You m ay say that it is a kind of control.\" \"Do you t hink I can exercise my will, for instance, by de nying m yself certain things?\" \"Such as asking que stions?\" he interjected. He said it in such a mischievous tone that I had to stop writing to look a t him. We both laughed. \"No,\" he said. \"Denying your self is an indulgence and I don't recommend anything of the kind. T hat is the reason why I let you a sk all the questions you w ant. If I told you t o stop asking que stions, you m ight warp your will trying to do t hat. The indulgence of denying is by far the worst; it forces us to believe we are doing gr eat things, when in effect we are only fixed within our selves. To stop asking que stions is not the will I'm talking about. Will is a power. And since it is a power it has to be controlled and tuned and that takes time. I know that and I'm patient with you. W hen I was your age I was as impulsive as you. Y et I have changed. Our will operates in spite of our indulgence. For example, your will is already ope ning your gap, little by little.\" \"What gap are you t alking about?\" \"There is a gap in us; like the soft spot on the head of a child which closes with age, this gap ope ns as one de- velops one's will.\" \"Where is that gap?\" \"At the place of your luminous fibers,\" he said, poi nting to his abdom inal area. \"What is it like? What is it for?\" \"It's an ope ning. It allows a space for the will to shoot out, like an arrow.\" \"Is the will an obj ect? Or like an obj ect?\" \"No. I just said that to make you unde rstand. W hat a sorcerer calls will is a power within our selves. It is not a thought , or an obj ect, or a wish. To stop asking que stions is not will because it needs thinking and wishing. W ill is what can make you s ucceed when your thought s tell you t hat you're defeated. Will is what makes you invulnerable. Will is what sends a sorcerer through a wall; through s pace; to the moon, i f he wants.\" There was nothing else I wanted to ask. I was tired and somewhat tense. I was afraid don J uan was going to ask me to leave and that annoye d me. \"Let's go to the hills,\" he said abruptly, and stood up. On the way he started talking about will again and laughed at my dismay ove r not being able to take notes. He described will as a force which was the true link be tween men and the world. He was very careful to establish that the world was whatever we perceive, in any m anner we may choose to perceive. Don Juan maintained that \"perceiving the world\" entails a process of apprehending whatever presents itself to us. This particular \"perceiving\" is done with our senses and with our will. I asked him if will was a sixth sense. He said it was rather a relation be tween our selves and the perceived world. I suggested that we halt so I could take notes. He laughed and ke pt on w alking. He did not make me leave that night, and the next day after eating br eakfast he himself brought up the subject of will. \"What you your self call will is character and strong di sposition,\" he said. \"What a sorcerer calls will is a force that comes from within and attaches itself to the world out there. It comes out through t he belly, right here, where the luminous fibers are.\" He rubbed his navel to poi nt out the area. \"I say that it comes out through he re because one can feel it coming out .\" 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"\"Why do you c all it will?\" \"I don't call it anything. M y benefactor called it will, and ot her men of know ledge call it will.\" \"Yesterday you s aid that one can perceive the world with the senses as well as with the will. How is that pos- sible?\" \"An average man can 'grab' the things of the world onl y with his hands, or his eyes, or his ears, but a sorcerer can grab them also with his nose, or his tongue , or his will, especially with his will. I cannot really describe how it is done , but you your self, for instance, cannot describe to me how you he ar. It happens that I am also capable of hearing, so we can talk about what we hear, but not about how we hear. A sorcerer uses his will to perceive the world. That perceiving, how ever, is not like hearing. W hen we look a t the world or when we hear it, we have the impression that it is out there and that it is real. When we perceive the world with our will we know that it is not as 'out there' or 'as real' as we think.\" \"Is will the same as seeing?\" \"No. Will is a force, a power. Seeing is not a force, but rather a way of getting through t hings. A sorcerer may have a very strong w ill and ye t he may not see; which means that only a man of know ledge perceives the world with his senses and with his will and also with his seeing. \" I told him that I was more confused than ever about how to use my will to forget the guardian. That statement and m y mood of perplexity seemed to delight him. \"I've told you t hat when you t alk you onl y get confused,\" he said and laughed. \"But at least now you know you a re waiting for your will. You still don't know what it is, or how it could happen to you. S o watch carefully everything you do. T he very thing that could help you de velop your will is amidst all the little things you do.\" Don Juan was gone all morning; he returned in the early afternoon w ith a bundl e of dry plants. He signaled me with his head to help him and we worked in complete silence for hour s, sorting the plants. When we finished we sat down to rest and he smiled at me benevolently. I said to him in a very serious manner that I had been reading m y not es and I still could not unde rstand what being a warrior entailed or what the idea of will meant. \"Will is not an idea,\" he said. This was the first time he had spoken to me the whole day. After a long pa use he continued: \"We are different, you a nd I. Our characters are not alike. Your nature is more violent than mine. When I was your age I was not violent but mean; you a re the oppos ite. My benefactor was like that; he would have been perfectly suited to be your teacher. He was a great sorcerer but he did not see; not the way I see or the way Genaro sees. I unde rstand the world and live guided by m y seeing. My benefactor, on t he other hand, ha d to live as a warrior. If a man sees he doesn't have to live like a warrior, or like anything else, for he can see things as they really are and di rect his life accordingly. But, considering your character, I would say that you m ay never learn to see, in which case you w ill have to live your entire life like a warrior. My benefactor said that when a man embarks on the paths of sorcery he becomes aware, in a gradual manner, that ordinary life has been forever left behind; that know ledge is indeed a frightening affair; that the means of the ordinary world are no longer a buffer for him; and that he must adopt a new way of life if he is going to survive. The first thing he ought to do, a t that point, is to want to become a warrior, a very important step and de cision. The frightening na ture of know ledge leaves one no alternative but to become a warrior. \"By the time know ledge becomes a frightening affair the man also realizes that death is the irreplaceable partner that sits next to him on the mat. Every bit of know ledge that becomes power has death as its central force. Death lends the ultimate touch, and whatever is touched by de ath indeed becomes power. \"A man who follows the paths of sorcery is confronted with imminent annihilation every turn of the way, and unavoidably he becomes keenly aware of his death. Without the awareness of death he would be only an ordinary man involved in ordinary acts. He would lack the necessary pot ency, the necessary concentration that transforms one's ordinary time on earth into magical power. \"Thus to be a warrior a man has to be, first of all, and rightfully so, keenly aware of his own death. But to be 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"concerned with death would force any one of us to focus on the self and that would be debilitating. S o the next thing one needs to be a warrior is detachment. The idea of imminent death, instead of becoming an obs ession, be - comes an indifference.\" Don Juan stopped talking and looked at me. He seemed to be waiting for a comment. \"Do you unde rstand?\" he asked. I unde rstood w hat he had said but I personally could not see how anyone could arrive at a sense of detachment. I said that from the point of view of my own apprenticeship I had already experienced the moment when know ledge became such a frightening affair. I could also truthfully say that I no longer found s uppor t in the ordinary premises of my daily life. And I wanted, or perhaps even more than wanted, I needed, to live like a warrior. \"Now you m ust detach your self,\" he said. \"From what?\" \"Detach your self from everything.\" \"That's impossible. I don't want to be a hermit.\" \"To be a hermit is an indulgence and I never meant that. A hermit is not detached, for he willfully abandons himself to being a hermit. \"Only the idea of death makes a man sufficiently detached so he is incapable of abandoni ng hi mself to any- thing. O nly the idea of death makes a man sufficiently detached so he can't deny hi mself anything. A man of that sort, how ever, does not crave, for he has acquired a silent lust for life and for all things of life. He know s his death is stalking hi m and won't give him time to cling to anything, so he tries, without craving, all of everything. \"A detached man, who know s he has no pos sibility of fencing of f his death, has only one thing to back himself with: the power of his decisions. He has to be, so to speak, the master of his choices. He must fully understand that his choice is his responsibility and onc e he makes it there is no longer time for regrets or recriminations. His decisions are final, simply because his death doe s not permit him time to cling to anything. \"And thus with an awareness of his death, with his detachment, and with the power of his decisions a warrior sets his life in a strategical manner. The know ledge of his death gui des him and m akes him detached and silently lusty; the power of his final decisions makes him able to choose without regrets and what he chooses is always strategically the best; and so he performs everything he has to with gus to and lusty efficiency. \"When a man behaves in such a manner one may rightfully say that he is a warrior and ha s acquired patience!\" Don Juan asked me if I had anything to say, and I remarked that the task he had described would take a life- time. He said I protested too m uch in front of him and that he knew I behaved, or at least tried to behave, in terms of a warrior in my day-to-day life. \"You ha ve pretty good c laws,\" he said, laughing. \"Show them to me from time to time. It's good pr actice.\" I made a gesture of claws and gr owled, and he laughed. Then he cleared his throat and went on talking. \"When a warrior has acquired patience he is on hi s way to will. He know s how to wait. His death sits with him on hi s mat, they are friends. His death advises him, in mysterious ways, how to choose, how to live strategically. And the warrior waits! I would say that the warrior learns without any hur ry because he know s he is waiting for his will; and one day he succeeds in performing something or dinarily qui te impossible to accomplish. He may not even not ice his extraordinary deed. But as he keeps on pe rforming impossible acts, or as impossible things keep on ha ppening to him, he becomes aware that a sort of power is emerging. A power that conies out of his body a s he progresses on the path of know ledge. At first it is like an itching on t he belly, or a warm spot that cannot be soothed; then it becomes a pain, a great discomfort. Sometimes the pain and di scomfort are so great that the warrior has convul sions for months, the more severe the convul sions the better for him. A fine power is always heralded by gr eat pain. \"When the convul sions cease the warrior notices he has strange feelings about things. He notices that he can actually touch anything he wants with a feeling that comes out of his body f rom a spot right below or right above his navel. That feeling is the will, and when he is capable of grabbing with it, one can rightfully say that the 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"warrior is a sorcerer, and that he has acquired will.\" Don Juan stopped talking and seemed to await my comments or questions. I had not hing to say. I was deeply concerned with the idea that a sorcerer had to experience pain and convul sions but I felt embarrassed about asking hi m if I also had to go t hrough t hat. Finally, after a long s ilence, I asked him, and he giggled as if he had been anticipating m y que stion. H e said that pain was not absolutely necessary; he, for example, had never had it and will had just happened to him. \"One day I was in the mountains,\" he said, \"and I stumbled upon a pum a, a female one; she was big and hungr y. I ran and she ran after me. I climbed a rock and she stood a few feet away ready to jump. I threw rocks at her. She growled and be gan to charge me. It was then that my will fully came out, and I stopped her with it before she jumped on m e. \"I caressed her with my will. I actually rubbed her tits with it. She looked at me with sleepy eyes and lay down and I ran like a son of a bitch before she got over it.\" Don Juan made a very comical gesture to por tray a man running for dear life, holding ont o his hat. I told him that I hated to think I had onl y female mountain lions or convul sions to look f orward to, if I wanted will. \"My benefactor was a sorcerer of great powers,\" he went on. \" He was a warrior through a nd through. H is will was indeed his most magnificent accomplishment. But a man can go s till further than that; a man can learn to see. Upon l earning to see he no longer needs to live like a warrior, nor be a sorcerer. Upon l earning to see a man becomes everything by be coming not hing. H e, so to speak, vanishes and ye t he's there. I would say that this is the time when a man can be or can get anything he desires. But he desires nothing, and instead of playing with his fellow men like they were toys, he meets them in the midst of their folly. The only difference between them is that a man who sees controls his folly, while his fellow men can't. A man who sees has no longer an active interest in his fellow men. Seeing has already de tached him from absolutely everything he knew before.\" \"The sole idea of being de tached from everything I know gives me the chills,\" I said. \"You m ust be joking! The thing which should give you t he chills is not to have anything to look f orward to but a lifetime of doing that which you ha ve always done . Think of the man who pl ants corn year after year until he's too ol d and tired to get up, s o he lies around l ike an old dog. H is thought s and feelings, the best of him, ramble aimlessly to the only things he has ever done , to plant corn. For me that is the most frightening waste there is. \"We are men and our lot is to learn and to be hurled into inconceivable new worlds.\" \"Are there any ne w worlds for us really?\" I asked half in jest. \"We have exhausted not hing, you f ool,\" he said imperatively. \" Seeing is for impeccable men. Temper your spirit now, become a warrior, learn to see, and then you' ll know that there is no end to the new worlds for our vision.\" 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"11 Don Juan did not make me leave after I had run hi s errands, as he had been doi ng lately. He said I could stay, and the next day, June 28, 1969, j ust before noon he told me I was going to smoke again. \"Am I going to try to see the guardian again?\" \"No, that's out. This is something else.\" Don Juan calmly filled his pipe with smoking m ixture, lighted it, and ha nded it to me. I experienced no apprehension, A pleasant drowsiness enveloped me right away. When I had finished smoking the whole bowl of mixture, don J uan put his pipe away and he lped me stand up. W e had been sitting facing each other on two straw mats he had placed in the center of his room. He said that we were going for a short walk and encouraged me to walk, shoving m e gently. I took a step and m y legs sagged. I did not feel any pa in when my kne es hit the ground. Don Juan held my arm and pus hed me up on m y feet again. \"You ha ve to walk,\" he said, \"the same way you got up the other time. You m ust use your will.\" I seemed to be stuck to the ground. I attempted a step with my right foot and almost lost my balance. Don Juan held my right arm at the armpit and ge ntly catapulted me forward, but my legs did not suppor t me and I would have collapsed on m y face had don J uan not caught my arm and buf fered my fall. He held me by the right armpit and m ade me lean on hi m. I could not feel anything but I was certain that my head was resting on hi s shoulder; I was seeing the room from a slanted perspective. He dragged me in that position around t he porch. We circled it twice in a most painful fashion; finally, I suppos e, my weight became so great that he had to drop m e on the ground. I knew he could not move me. In a certain way it was as if part of myself deliberately wanted to become lead-heavy. D on Juan did not make any effort to pick me up. H e looked at me for an instant; I was lying on m y back facing hi m, I tried to smile at him and he began to laugh; then he bent over and slapped me on the belly. I had a most peculiar sensation. It was not painful or pleasurable or anything I could think of . It was rather a jolt. Don Juan immediately began to roll me around. I did not feel anything; I assumed he was rolling m e around be cause my view of the porch changed in accordance with a circular motion. W hen don J uan had me in the position he wanted he stepped back. \"Stand up! \" he ordered me imperatively. \"Stand up t he way you di d it the other day. Don't piddle around. You know how to get up. N ow get up!\" I intently tried to recollect the actions I had performed on t hat occasion, but I could not think clearly; it was as if my thought s had a will of their own no m atter how hard I tried to control them. Finally the thought occurred to me that if I said \"up\" as I had done before I would certainly get up. I said, \"Up,\" loud a nd clear but nothing happened. Don Juan looked at me with obvi ous displeasure and then walked around m e toward the door . I was lying on my left side and ha d a full view of the area in front of his hous e; my back was to the door , so when he walked around m e I immediately assumed he had gone inside. \"Don Juan!\" I called loudly, but he did not answer. I had an ove rpowering feeling of impotence and de spair. I wanted to get up. I said, \"Up,\" again and again, as if that were the magic word that would make me move. Nothing ha ppened. I had an attack of frustration and I went through a sort of tantrum. I wanted to beat my head against the floor and weep. I spent excruciating moments in which I wanted to move or talk and I could not do either. I was truly immobile, paralyzed. \"Don Juan, help me!\" I finally managed to bellow. Don Juan came back and sat in front of me, laughing. H e said that I was getting hys terical and that whatever I was experiencing was inconsequential. He lifted my head and, looking straight at me, said that I was having an attack of sham fear. He told me not to fret. \"Your life is getting complicated,\" he said. \"Get rid of whatever it is that's causing you t o lose your temper. Stay here quietly and rearrange your self.\" He placed my head on t he ground. H e stepped ove r me and all I could perceive was the shuffling of his sandals as he walked away. 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"My first impulse was to fret again, but I could not gather the energy to work myself into it. Instead, I found myself slipping into a rare state of serenity; a great feeling of ease enveloped me. I knew what the complexity of my life was. It was my little boy. I wanted to be his father more than anything else on this earth. I liked the idea of molding hi s character and taking hi m hiking and teaching hi m \"how to live,\" and ye t I abhorred the idea of coercing hi m into my way of life, but that was precisely what I would have to do, c oerce him with force or with that artful set of arguments and rewards we call unde rstanding. \"I must let him go,\" I thought . \"I must not cling to him. I must set him free.\" My thought s brought on a terrifying feeling of melancholy. I began to weep. My eyes filled with tears and my view of the porch blurred. Suddenly I had a great urge to get up and look f or don J uan to explain to him about my little boy; and the next thing I knew, I was looking at the porch from an upr ight position. I turned around t o face the hous e and found don J uan standing in front of me. Apparently he had been standing there behind m e all the time. Although I could not feel my steps, I must have walked toward him, because I moved. Don Juan came to me smiling and he ld me up by t he armpits. His face was very close to mine. \"Good, good w ork,\" he said reassuringly. At that instant I became aware that something extraordinary was taking pl ace right there. I had the feeling at first that I was only recollecting an event that had taken place years before. At one time in the past I had seen don Juan's face at very close range; I had smoked his mixture and I had had the feeling then that don J uan's face was submerged in a tank of water. It was enormous and it was luminous and it moved. The image had been so brief that I did not have time to really take stock of it. This time, how ever, don J uan was holding m e and hi s face was no m ore than a foot away from mine and I had time to examine it. When I stood up a nd turned around I definitely saw don J uan; \"the don J uan I know \" definitely walked toward me and he ld me. But when I focused my eyes on his face I did not see don J uan as I am accustomed to seeing hi m; instead, I saw a large object in front of my eyes. I knew it was don J uan's face, yet that know ledge was not guided by m y perception; it was, rather, a logical conclusion on m y part; after all, my memory confirmed that the instant before, \"the don J uan I know \" was hold- ing m e by the armpits. Therefore the strange, luminous object in front of me had to be don J uan's face; there was a familiarity to it; yet it had no r esemblance to what I would call don J uan's \"real\" face. What I was looking at was a round obj ect which had a luminosity of its own. Every part in it moved. I perceived a contained, undul atory, rhythmical flow; it was as if the flowing was enclosed within itself, never moving be yond i ts limits, and ye t the object in front of my eyes was oozing with movement at any pl ace on its surface. The thought that occurred to me was that it oozed life. In fact it was so alive that I became engrossed looking at its movement. It was a mesmerizing fluttering. It became more and m ore engrossing, unt il I could no l onger tell what the phenomenon i n front of my eyes was. I experienced a sudden jolt; the luminous object became blurry, as if something were shaking it, and then it lost its glow and be came solid and fleshy. I was then looking at don J uan's familiar dark face. He was smiling placidly. The view of his \"real\" face lasted an instant and then the face again acquired a glow, a shine, an iridescence. It was not light as I am accustomed to perceiving light, or even a glow; rather it was movement, an incredibly fast flickering of something. T he glowing obj ect began to bobbl e up and dow n again and that disrupted its undul atory continuity. Its shine diminished as it shook, unt il it again became the \"solid\" face of don Juan, as I see him in everyday life. At that moment I vaguely realized that don J uan was shaking m e. He was also speaking to me. I did not unde rstand what he was saying, but as he kept on shaking m e I finally heard him. \"Don't stare at me. Don't stare at me,\" he kept saying. \"Break your gaze. Break your gaze. Move your eyes away.\" Shaking m y body s eemed to force me to dislodge my steady ga ze; apparently when I did not peer intently into don J uan's face I did not see the luminous object. When I moved my eyes away from his face and looked at it with the corner of my eye, so to speak, I could perceive his solidity; that is to say, I could perceive a three- dimensional person; without really looking at him I could, in fact, perceive his whole body, but when I focused my gaze, the face became at once the luminous object. 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"\"Don't look a t me at all,\" don J uan said gravely. I moved my eyes away and looked at the ground. \"Don't fix your gaze on anything,\" don J uan said imperatively, and stepped aside in order to help me walk. I did not feel my steps and could not figure out how I performed the act of walking, ye t with don J uan holding m e by the armpit, we moved all the way to the back of his hous e. We stopped by t he irrigation di tch. \"Now gaze at the water,\" don J uan ordered me. I looked at the water but I could not gaze at it. Somehow the movement of the current distracted me, Don Juan kept on ur ging m e in a joking m anner to exercise my \"gazing pow ers,\" but I could not concentrate. I gazed at don J uan's face once again but the glow did not become apparent any m ore. I began to experience a strange itching on m y body, t he sensation of a limb that has fallen asleep; the muscles of my legs began to twitch. Don Juan shoved me into the water and I tumbled dow n all the way to the bottom. He had apparently held my right hand as he pushed me, and when I hit the shallow bottom he pulled me up again. It took a long t ime for me to regain control over myself. When we got back to his hous e hour s later, I asked him to explain my experience. As I put on m y dry clothes I excitedly described what I had perceived, but he discarded my entire account, saying that there was nothing of importance in it. \"Big deal!\" he said, mocking m e. \"You saw a glow, big deal.\" I insisted on a n explanation and he got up and said he had to leave. It was almost five in the afternoon. The next day I insisted again on di scussing m y peculiar experience. \"Was it seeing, don J uan?\" I asked. He remained qui et, smiling m ysteriously, as I kept pressing hi m to answer me. \"Let's say that seeing is somewhat like that,\" he finally said. \"You were gazing at my face and saw it shining, but it was still my face. It just happens that the little smoke makes one gaze like that. Nothing to it.\" \"But in what way would seeing be different?\" \"When you see there are no longer familiar features in the world. Everything is new. Everything ha s never happened before. The world is incredible!\" \"Why do you s ay incredible, don J uan? What makes it incredible?\" \"Nothing is any longer familiar. Everything you ga ze at becomes nothing! Yesterday you di dn't see. You gazed at my face and, since you l ike me, you not iced my glow. I was not monstrous, like the guardian, but beautiful and interesting. B ut you di d not see me. I didn't become nothing in front of you. A nd ye t you di d well. You took t he first real step toward seeing. The only drawback was that you f ocused on m e, and in that case I'm no be tter than the guardian for you. Y ou succumbed in bot h instances and di dn't see.\" \"Do things disappear? How do they become nothing?\" \"Things don't disappear. They don' t vanish, if that's what you m ean; they simply become nothing and ye t they are still there.\" \"How can that be possible, don J uan?\" \"You ha ve the damnedest insistence on talking!\" don J uan exclaimed with a serious face. \"I think we didn't hit it right about your promise. Perhaps what you r eally promised was to never, ever stop talking.\" Don Juan's tone was severe. The look i n his face was concerned. I wanted to laugh but I did not dare. I believed that don J uan was serious, but he was not. He began to laugh. I told him that if I did not talk I got very nervous. \"Let's walk, then,\" he said. He took m e to the mouth of a canyon a t the bottom of the hills. It was about an hour 's walk. We rested for a short while and then he guided me through t he thick desert unde rbrush to a water hole; that is, to a spot he said was a water hole. It was as dry as any ot her spot in the surroundi ng area. \"Sit in the middle of the water hole,\" he ordered me. I obeyed and sat down. \"Are you goi ng to sit here too?\" I asked. I saw him fixing a place to sit some twenty yards from the center of the water hole, against the rocks on the 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"side of the mountain. He said he was going to watch me from there. I was sitting with my kne es against my chest. He corrected my position and told me to sit with my left leg tucked unde r my seat and m y right one bent, with the knee in an upward pos ition. M y right arm had to be by m y side with my fist resting on t he ground, w hile my left arm was crossed ove r my chest. He told me to face him and stay there, relaxed but not \"abandone d.\" He then took a sort of whitish cord from his pouc h. It looked like a big loop. H e looped it around hi s neck and stretched it with his left hand unt il it was taut. He plucked the tight string with his right hand. It made a dull, vibratory sound. He relaxed his grip and looked at me and told me that I had to yell a specific word if I began to feel that something was coming at me when he plucked the string. I asked what was suppos ed to come at me and he told me to shut up. H e signaled me with his hand that he was going to commence. He said that if something came at me in a very menacing way I had to adopt a fighting form that he had taught me years before, which consisted of dancing, be ating the ground w ith the tip of the left foot, while I slapped my right thigh vi gorously. The fighting form was part of a defense technique used in cases of extreme distress and da nger. I had a moment of genuine apprehension. I wanted to inquire about the reason for our being there, but he did not give me time and be gan plucking the string. H e did it various times at regular intervals of perhaps twenty seconds. I noticed that as he kept plucking the string he augmented the tension. I could clearly see that his arms and ne ck were shivering unde r the stress. The sound be came more clear and I realized then that he added a peculiar yell every time he plucked the string. T he combined sound of the tense string and the hum an voi ce produced a weird, une arthly reverberation. I did not feel anything coming at me, but the sight of don J uan's exertion and the eerie sound he was producing ha d me almost in a state of trance. Don Juan relaxed his grip and looked at me. While he played, his back was turned to me and he was facing the southeast, as I was; when he relaxed, he faced me. \"Don't look a t me when I play,\" he said. \"Don't close your eyes, though. N ot for anything. L ook a t the ground in front of you a nd listen.\" He tensed the string again and be gan playing. I looked at the ground a nd concentrated on t he sound he was making. I had never heard the sound be fore in my life. I became very frightened. The eerie reverberation filled the narrow canyon a nd be gan to echo. In fact the sound don J uan was making was coming ba ck to me as an echo from all around t he canyon w alls. Don Juan must have also not iced that and increased the tension of his string. A lthough don J uan had changed the pitch, the echo seemed to subside, and then it seemed to concentrate on one point, toward the southeast. Don Juan reduced the tension of the string by de grees, until I heard a final dull twang. H e put the string inside his pouc h and walked toward me. He helped me stand up. I noticed then that the muscles of my arms and legs were stiff, like rocks; I was literally soaked in perspiration. I had no i dea I had been perspiring so heavily. Drops of sweat ran into my eyes and m ade them burn. Don Juan practically dragged me out of the place. I tried to say something but he put his hand ove r my mouth. Instead of leaving the canyon t he way we had come in, don J uan made a detour. We climbed the side of the mountain and ended up i n some hills very far from the mouth of the canyon. We walked in dead silence to his hous e. It was already da rk by t he time we got there. I tried to talk again but don J uan put his hand on m y mouth onc e more. We did not eat and di d not light the kerosene lantern. Don Juan put my mat in his room and poi nted at it with his chin. I unde rstood i t as a gesture that I should lie down and go t o sleep. \"I have the proper thing for you t o do,\" don J uan said to me as soon a s I woke up the next morning. \"You will start it today. There isn't much time, you know .\" After a very long, une asy pause I felt compelled to ask him, \"What did you ha ve me doing in the canyon ye sterday?\" 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Don Juan giggled like a child. \"I just tapped the spirit of that water hole,\" he said. \"That type of spirit should be tapped when the water hole is dry, when the spirit has retreated into the mountains. Yesterday I, let us say, woke him up from his slumber. But he didn't mind it and poi nted to your lucky di rection. H is voice came from that direction.\" Don Juan poi nted toward the southeast. \"What was the string you pl ayed, don J uan?\" \"A spirit catcher.\" \"Can I look a t it?\" \"No. But I'll make you one . Or better yet, you w ill make one for your self some day, when you l earn to see\" \"What is it made of, don J uan?\" \"Mine is a wild boa r. When you ge t one you w ill realize that it is alive and can teach you t he different sounds it likes. With practice you w ill get to know your spirit catcher so well that together you w ill make sounds full of power.\" \"Why di d you t ake me to look f or the spirit of the water hole, don J uan?\" \"You will know that very soon.\" Around 11: 30 A . M . we sat unde r his ramada, where he prepared his pipe for me to smoke. He told me to stand up w hen my body w as quite num b; I did that with great ease. He helped me walk around, I was surprised at my control; I actually walked twice around t he ramada by m yself. Don Juan stayed by m y side but did not guide me or suppor t me. Then he took m e by the arm and walked me to the irrigation di tch. He made me sit on the edge of the bank and or dered me imperatively to gaze at the water and think of nothing else. I tried to focus my gaze on the water but its movement distracted me. My mind and m y eyes began to wander onto other features of the immediate surroundi ngs. Don Juan bobbe d my head up a nd dow n and or dered me again to gaze only at the water and not think at all. He said it was difficult to stare at the moving water and that one had to keep on t rying. I tried three times and every time I became distracted by s omething else. Don Juan very pa- tiently shook m y head every time. Finally I noticed that my mind and m y eyes were focusing on t he water; in spite of its movement. I was becoming immersed in my view of its liquidness. The water became slightly different. It seemed to be heavier and uni formly grayish green. I could not ice the ripples it made as it moved. The ripples were extremely sharp. And then, suddenly, I had the sensation that I was not looking at a mass of moving water but at a picture of water; what I had in front of my eyes was a frozen segment of the running water. The ripples were immobile. I could look a t every one of them. Then they began to acquire a green phos phorescence and a sort of green fog ooz ed out of them. The fog expanded in ripples and as it moved, its greenness became more brilliant until it was a dazzling radiance that covered everything. I don't know how long I stayed by t he irrigation di tch. Don Juan did not interrupt me. I was immersed in the green glow of the fog. I could sense it all around m e. It soothed me. I had no t hought s, no f eelings. All I had was a quiet awareness, the awareness of a brilliant, soothing gr eenness. Being extremely cold and da mp was the next thing I became aware of. Gradually I realized that I was submerged in the irrigation di tch. At one moment the water slipped inside my nos e, and I swallowed it and it made me cough. I had an annoyi ng itch inside my nos e and I sneezed repeatedly. I stood up a nd ha d such a forceful and loud s neeze that I also farted. Don Juan clapped his hands and laughed. \"If a body f arts, it's alive,\" he said. He signaled me to follow him and we walked to his hous e. I thought of keeping qui et. In a way, I expected to be in a detached and m orose mood, but I really did not feel tired or melancholy. I felt rather buoya nt and changed my clothes very rapidly. I began to whistle. Don Juan looked at me curiously and pr etended to be surprised; he opened his mouth and hi s eyes. His gesture was very funny a nd I laughed qui te a bit longer than it called for. \"You're cracking up,\" he said, and laughed very hard himself. I explained to him that I did not want to fall into the habit of feeling m orose after using hi s smoking m ixture. I told him that after he had taken me out of the irrigation di tch, dur ing m y attempts to meet the guardian, I had 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"become convinced that I could \"see\" if I stared at things around m e long e nough. \"Seeing is not a matter of looking and ke eping qui et,\" he said. \"Seeing is a technique one has to learn. Or maybe it is a technique some of us already know .\" He peered at me as if to insinuate that I was one of those who already kne w the technique. \"Are you s trong e nough t o walk?\" he asked. I said I felt fine, which I did. I was not hungr y, although I had not eaten all day. Don Juan put some bread and some pieces of dry meat in a knapsack, handed it to me, and ge stured with his head for me to follow. \"Where are we going?\" I asked. He pointed toward the hills with a slight movement of his head. We headed for the same canyon w here the water hole was, but we did not enter it. Don Juan climbed ont o the rocks to our right, at the very mouth of the canyon. W e went up the hill. The sun was almost on the horizon. It was a mild day but I felt hot and suffocated. I could hardly breathe. Don Juan was quite a way ahead of me and ha d to stop to let me catch up w ith him. He said I was in terrible physical condition and that it was perhaps not wise to go a ny further. He let me rest for about an hour . He selected a slick, almost round boul der and told me to lie there. He arranged my body on t he rock. He told me to stretch my arms and legs and let them hang loose. My back was slightly arched and m y neck relaxed, so that my head also hung l oose. He made me stay in that position for perhaps fifteen minutes. Then he told me to unc over my abdom inal region. H e carefully selected some branches and leaves and he aped them over my naked belly. I felt an instantaneous warmth all over my body. D on Juan then took m e by the feet and turned me until my head was toward the southeast. \"Now let us call that spirit of the water hole,\" he said. I tried to turn my head to look a t him. He held me vigorously by t he hair and said that I was in a very vul ner- able position and in a terribly weak phys ical state and ha d to remain qui et and m otionless. He had put all those special branches on m y belly to protect me and was going to remain next to me in case I could not take care of myself. He was standing ne xt to the top of my head, and if I rolled my eyes I could see him. He took hi s string and tensed it and then realized I was looking at him by rolling m y eyes way into my forehead. He gave me a snappy tap on t he head with his knuc kles and or dered me to look a t the sky, not to close my eyes, and to concentrate on the sound. H e added, as if on second t hought , that I should not hesitate to yell the word he had taught me if I felt something was coming at me. Don Juan and hi s \"spirit catcher\" began with a low-tension twang. H e slowly increased the tension, and I began to hear a sort of reverberation first, and then a definite echo which came consistently from a southeasterly direction. T he tension increased. Don Juan and hi s \"spirit catcher\" were perfectly matched. The string pr oduced a low-range note and don J uan magnified it, increasing its intensity unt il it was a penetrating cry, a howling call. The apex was an eerie shriek, inconceivable from the point of view of my own experience. The sound r everberated in the mountains and echoed back to us. I fancied it was coming di rectly toward me. I felt it had something to do w ith the temperature of my body. B efore don J uan started his calls I had been very warm and comfortable, but during the highest point of his calls I became chilled; my teeth chattered uncontrollably and I truly had the sensation that something was coming at me. At one point I noticed that the sky had become very dark. I had not been aware of the sky although I was looking at it. I had a moment of intense panic and I yelled the word don J uan had taught me. Don Juan immediately began to decrease the tension of his eerie calls, but that did not bring m e any relief. \"Cover your ears,\" don J uan mumbled imperatively. I covered them with my hands. After some minutes don J uan stopped altogether and came around t o my side. After he had taken the branches and leaves off my belly, he helped me up and carefully put them on the rock where I had been lying. H e made a fire with them, and while it burned he rubbed my stomach with other leaves from his pouc h. He put his hand on m y mouth when I was about to tell him that I had a terrible headache. 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"We stayed there until all the leaves had bur ned. It was fairly dark by t hen. We walked dow n the hill and I got sick to my stomach. While we were walking along t he irrigation di tch, don J uan said that I had done enough a nd I should not stay around. I asked him to explain what the spirit of the water hole was, but he gestured me to be quiet. He said that we would talk about it some other time, then he deliberately changed the subject and ga ve me a long e xplanation about \"seeing.\" I said it was regrettable that I could not write in the darkness. He seemed very pleased and said that most of the time I did not pay attention to what he had to say because I was so determined to write everything dow n. He spoke about \"seeing\" as a process independent of the allies and the techniques of sorcery. A sorcerer was a person who could command an ally and could thus manipulate an ally 's power to his advantage, but the fact that he commanded an ally did not mean that he could \"see.\" I reminded him that he had told me before that it was impossible to \"see\" unless one had an ally . Don Juan very calmly replied that he had come to the conclusion it was possible to \"see\" and ye t not command an ally . He felt there was no reason why not , since \"seeing\" had nothing to do w ith the manipulatory techniques of sorcery, which served onl y to act upon our fellow men. The techniques of \"seeing,\" on the other hand, ha d no e ffect on m en. My thought s were very clear. I experienced no f atigue or drowsiness and no l onger had an unc omfortable feeling in my stomach, as I walked with don J uan. I was terribly hungr y, and when we got to his hous e I gorged myself with food. Afterwards I asked him to tell me more about the techniques of \"seeing.\" He smiled broadly at me and said that I was again myself. \"How is it,\" I said, \"that the techniques of seeing have no effect on our fellow men?\" \"I've told you a lready,\" he said. \"Seeing is not sorcery. Yet one may easily confuse them, because a man who sees can learn, in no t ime at all, to manipulate an ally and m ay become a sorcerer. On the other hand, a man may learn certain techniques in order to command an ally and thus become a sorcerer, and ye t he may never learn to see. \"Besides, seeing is contrary to sorcery. Seeing makes one realize the unimportance of it all.\" \"The unimportance of what, don J uan?\" \"The unimportance of everything.\" We did not say anything else. I felt very relaxed and di d not want to speak any m ore. I was lying on m y back on a straw mat. I had made a pillow with my windbreaker. I felt comfortable and ha ppy a nd wrote my not es for hours in the light of the kerosene lantern. Suddenly don J uan spoke again. \"Today you di d very well,\" he said. \"You di d very well at the water. The spirit of the water hole likes you and he lped you a ll the way.\" I realized then that I had forgotten to recount my experience to him. I began to describe the way I had per- ceived the water. He did not let me continue. He said that he knew I had perceived a green fog. I felt compelled to ask, \"How did you know that, don J uan?\" \"I saw you.\" \"What did I do?\" \"Nothing, you s at there and ga zed into the water and finally you pe rceived the green mist.\" \"Was it seeing?\" \"No. But it was very close. You're getting close.\" I got very excited. I wanted to know more about it. He laughed and m ade fun of my eagerness. He said that anyone could perceive the green fog be cause it was like the guardian, something that was unavoidably there, so there was no gr eat accomplishment in perceiving it. \"When I said you di d well, I meant that you di d not fret,\" he said, \"as you di d with the guardian. If you ha d become restless I would have had to shake your head and br ing you ba ck. Whenever a man goe s into the green fog hi s benefactor has to stay by hi m in case it begins to trap him. You can jump out of the guardian's reach by 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"yourself, but you c an't escape the clutches of the green fog by your self. At least not at the beginning. L ater on you m ay learn a way to do i t. Now we're trying to find out something else.\" \"What are we trying to find out ?\" \"Whether you c an see the water.\" \"How will I know that I have seen it, or that I am seeing it?\" \"You will know . You ge t confused onl y when you t alk.\" 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"12 Working on m y not es I had come across various questions. \"Is the green fog, like the guardian, something that one has to ove rcome in order to see?\" I asked don J uan as soon a s we sat down unde r his ramada on August 8, 1969. \"Yes. One must overcome everything,\" he said. \"How can I overcome the green fog?\" \"The same way you s hould have overcome the guardian, by l etting it turn into not hing.\" \"What should I do?\" \"Nothing. F or you, t he green fog is something m uch easier than the guardian. The spirit of the water hole likes you, w hile it certainly was not your temperament to deal with the guardian. You ne ver really saw the guardian.\" \"Maybe that was because I didn't like it. What if I were to meet a guardian I liked? There must be some people who would regard the guardian I saw as being be autiful. Would they ove rcome it because they liked it?\" \"No! You still don't unde rstand. It doesn't matter whether you l ike or dislike the guardian. As long a s you have a feeling toward it, the guardian will remain the same, monstrous, beautiful, or whatever. If you ha ve no feeling toward it, on t he other hand, the guardian will become nothing and will still be there in front of you.\" The idea that something as colossal as the guardian could become nothing and still be in front of my eyes made absolutely no s ense. I felt it was one of the alogical premises of don J uan's know ledge. However, I also felt that if he wanted to he could explain it to me. I insisted on a sking hi m what he meant by that. \"You thought the guardian was something you kne w, that's what I mean.\" \"But I didn't think it was something I knew.\" \"You thought it was ugly. Its size was awesome. It was a monster. You know what all those things are. So the guardian was always something you kne w, and as long a s it was something you kne w you di d not see it. I have told you a lready, the guardian had to become nothing and ye t it had to stand in front of you. I t had to be there and it had, at the same time, to be nothing.\" \"How could that be, don J uan? What you s ay is absurd.\" \"It is. But that is seeing. There is really no w ay to talk about it. Seeing, as I said before, is learned by seeing. \"Apparently you ha ve no pr oblem with water. You ne arly saw it the other day. Water is your 'hinge.' All you need now is to perfect your technique of seeing. You ha ve a powerful helper in the spirit of the water hole.\" \"That's another burning que stion I have, don J uan.\" \"You m ay have all the burning que stions you w ant, but we cannot talk about the spirit of the water hole in this vicinity. In fact, it is better not to think about it at all. Not at all. Otherwise the spirit will trap you a nd if that happens there is nothing a living m an can do t o help you. S o keep your mouth shut and ke ep your thought s on something else.\" Around t en o'clock the next morning don J uan took hi s pipe out of its sheath, filled it with smoking m ixture, then handed it to me and told me to carry it to the bank of the stream. Holding the pipe with bot h hands, I managed to unbut ton m y shirt and put the pipe inside and hol d it tight. Don Juan carried two straw mats and a small tray with coals. It was a warm day. We sat on the mats in the shade of a small grove of brea trees at the very edge of the water. Don Juan placed a charcoal inside the pipe bowl and told me to smoke. I did not have any apprehension or any feeling of elation. I remembered that during m y second a ttempt to \"see\" the guardian, after don J uan had explained its nature, I had had a unique sensation of wonder and awe. This time, how ever, although don J uan had made me cognizant of the possibility of actually \"seeing\" the water, I was not involved emotionally; I was only curious. Don Juan made me smoke twice the amount I had smoked dur ing pr evious attempts. At a given moment he leaned ove r and whispered in my right ear that he was going to teach me how to use the water in order to move. I felt his face very close, as if he had put his mouth next to my ear. He told me not to gaze into the water, but to focus my eyes on the surface and ke ep them fixed unt il the water turned into a green fog. H e repeated ove r and 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"over that I had to put all my attention on t he fog unt il I could not detect anything else. \"Look a t the water in front of you,\" I heard him saying, \"but don't let its sound c arry you a nywhere. If you l et the sound of the water carry you I may never be able to find you a nd br ing you ba ck. Now get into the green fog and listen to my voi ce.\" I heard and unde rstood hi m with extraordinary clarity. I began looking at the water fixedly, and ha d a very peculiar sensation of phys ical pleasure; an itch; an unde fined happiness. I stared for a long t ime but did not detect the green fog. I felt that my eyes were getting out of focus and I had to struggle to keep looking at the water; finally I could not control my eyes any longer and I must have closed them, or blinked, or perhaps I just lost my capacity to focus; at any rate, at that very moment the water became fixed; it ceased to move. It seemed to be a painting. T he ripples were immobile. Then the water began to fizzle; it was as if it had carbonated particles that exploded at once. For an instant I saw the fizzling as a slow expansion of green matter. It was a silent explosion; the water burst into a brilliant green mist, which expanded unt il it had enveloped me. I remained suspended in it until a very sharp, sustained, shrill noise shook e verything; the fog seemed to congeal into the usual features of the water surface. The shrill noise was don J uan yelling, \"Heyyyy! \" close to my ear. He told me to pay attention to his voice and go ba ck into the fog and wait there until he called me. I said, \"O.K.,\" in English and he ard the cackling noi se of his laughter. \"Please, don' t talk,\" he said. \"Don't give me any m ore O.K.s.\" I could hear him very well. The sound of his voice was melodious and above all friendly. I knew that without thinking; it was a conviction that struck me and then passed. Don Juan's voice ordered me to focus all my attention on t he fog but not abandon m yself to it. He said repeatedly that a warrior did not abandon hi mself to anything, not even to his death. I became immersed in the mist again and not iced that it was not fog at all, or at least it was not what I conceive fog to be like. The foglike phenomenon w as composed of tiny bubbl es, round obj ects that came into my field of \"vision\" and m oved out of it with a floating qua lity. I watched their movement for a while, then a loud, di stant noise jolted my attention and I lost my capacity to focus and could no l onger perceive the tiny bubbl es. All I was aware of then was a green, amorphous , foglike glow. I heard the loud noi se again and the jolt it gave dispelled the fog at once and I found myself looking at the water of the irrigation di tch. Then I heard it again much closer; it was don J uan's voice. He was telling m e to pay attention to him, because his voice was my onl y gui de. He ordered me to look a t the bank of the stream and at the vegetation di rectly in front of me. I saw some reeds and a space which was clear of reeds. It was a small cove on the bank, a place where don J uan steps across to plunge his bucket and fill it with water. After a few moments don J uan ordered me to return to the fog and asked me again to pay attention to his voice, because he was going to gui de me so I could learn how to move; he said that once I saw the bubbl es I should board one of them and let it carry me. I obeyed him and was at once surrounde d by t he green mist, and then I saw the tiny bubbl es. I heard don Juan's voice again as a very strange and frightening rumble. Immediately upon he aring it I began losing m y capacity to perceive the bubbl es. \"Mount one of those bubbl es,\" I heard him saying. I struggled to maintain my perception of the green bubbl es and still hear his voice. I don't know how long I fought to do t hat, when suddenly I was aware that I could listen to him and still keep sight of the bubbl es, which kept on pa ssing through, f loating slowly out of my field of perception. D on Juan's voice kept on ur ging m e to follow one of them and m ount it. I wondered how I was suppos ed to do t hat and automatically I voiced the word, \"How.\" I felt that the word was very deep inside me and as it came out it carried me to the surface. The word was like a buoy t hat emerged out of my depth. I heard myself saying, \"How,\" and I sounde d like a dog how ling. D on Juan how led back, also like a dog, a nd then he made some coyote sounds , and laughed. I thought it was very funny a nd I actually laughed. Don Juan told me very calmly to let myself become affixed to a bubbl e by following it. \"Go back again,\" he said. \"Go into the fog! Into the fog!\" 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"I went back and not iced that the movement of the bubbl es had slowed dow n and they had become as large as basketballs. In fact they were so large and slow that I could examine any one of them in great detail. They were not really bubbl es, not like a soap bubbl e, nor like a balloon, nor any spherical container. They were not con- tainers, yet they were contained. Nor were they round, a lthough w hen I first perceived them I could have sworn they were round a nd the image that came to my mind was \"bubbl es.\" I viewed them as if I were looking through a window ; that is, the frame of the window did not allow me to follow them but only permitted me to view them coming into and goi ng out of my field of perception. W hen I ceased to view them as bubbl es, how ever, I was capable of following them; in the act of following them I became affixed to one of them and I floated with it. I truly felt I was moving. In fact I was the bubbl e, or that thing which resembled a bubbl e. Then I heard the shrill sound of don J uan's voice. It jolted me and I lost my feeling of being \"it.\" The sound was extremely frightening; it was a remote voice, very metallic, as if he were talking through a loud-speaker. I made out some of the words. \"Look a t the banks,\" he said. I saw a very large body of water. The water was rushing. I could hear the noise it made. \"Look a t the banks,\" don J uan ordered me again. I saw a concrete wall. The sound of the water became terribly loud; the sound e ngulfed me. Then it ceased instantaneously, as if it had been cut off. I had the sensation of blackness, of sleep. I became aware that I was immersed in the irrigation di tch. Don Juan was splashing water in my face as he hummed. Then he submerged me in the ditch. He pulled my head up, ove r the surface, and let me rest it on the bank as he held me by the back of my shirt collar. I had a most pleasant sensation in my arms and legs. I stretched them. My eyes were tired and they itched; I lifted my right hand to rub them. It was a difficult movement. My arm seemed to be heavy. I could hardly lift it out of the water, but when I did, my arm came out covered with a most astonishing m ass of green mist. I held my arm in front of my eyes. I could see its contour as a darker mass of green surrounde d by a most intense greenish glow. I got to my feet in a hurry and stood i n the middle of the stream and looked at my body; my chest, arms, and legs were green, deep green. The hue was so intense that it gave me the feeling of a viscous substance. I looked like a figurine don J uan had made for me years before out of a datura root. Don Juan told me to come out. I noticed an urgency in his voice. \"I'm green,\" I said. \"Cut it out,\" he said imperatively. \"You ha ve no time. Get out of there. The water is about to trap you. G et out of it! Out! Out!\" I panicked and jumped out . \"This time you m ust tell me everything that took pl ace,\" he said matter-of-factly, as soon a s we sat facing each other inside his room. He was not interested in the sequence of my experience; he wanted to know only what I had encountered when he told me to look a t the bank. H e was interested in details. I described the wall I had seen. \"Was the wall to your left or to your right?\" he asked. I told him that the wall had really been in front of me. But he insisted that it had to be either to the left or to the right. \"When you f irst saw it, where was it? Close your eyes and don' t open them until you ha ve remembered.\" He stood up a nd turned my body w hile I had my eyes closed unt il he had me facing east, the same direction I had faced when I was sitting in front of the stream. He asked me in which direction I had moved. I said I had moved onw ard, ahead, in front of me. He insisted that I should remember and concentrate on the tune when I was still viewing the water as bubbl es. \"Which way did they flow?\" he asked. Don Juan urged me to recall, and finally I had to admit that the bubbl es had seemed to be moving to my right. Yet I was not as absolutely sure as he wanted me to be. Under his probing I began to realize that I was incapable of classifying m y perception. T he bubbl es had moved to my right when I first viewed them, but when 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"they became larger they flowed everywhere. Some of them seemed to be coming di rectly at me, others seemed to go in every pos sible direction. T here were bubbl es moving above and be low me. In fact they were all around m e. I recollected hearing their fizzing; thus I must have perceived them with my ears as well as with my eyes. When the bubbl es became so large that I was able to \"mount\" one of them, I \"saw\" them rubbing each other like balloons. My excitement increased as I recollected the details of my perception. D on Juan, how ever, was completely uninterested. I told him that I had seen the bubbl es fizzing. It was not a purely auditory or purely visual effect, but something undi fferentiated, yet crystal clear; the bubbl es rasped against each other. I did not see or hear their movement, I felt it; I was part of the sound a nd the motion. As I recounted my experience I became deeply moved. I held his arm and shook i t in an out burst of great agi- tation. I had realized that the bubbl es had no out er limit; none theless, they were contained and their edges changed shape and were uneven and jagged. The bubbl es merged and separated with great speed, yet their movement was not dazzling. T heir movement was fast and at the same time slow. Another thing I remembered, as I recounted my experience, was the quality of color that the bubbl es seemed to pos sess. They were transparent and ve ry bright and seemed almost green, although i t was not a hue, as I am accustomed to perceiving hue s. \"You're stalling,\" don J uan said. \"Those things are not important. You're dwelling on t he wrong i tems. The direction is the only important issue.\" I could onl y remember that I had moved without any poi nt of reference, but don J uan concluded that since the bubbl es had flowed consistently to my right—south—at the beginning, the south was the direction with which I had to be concerned. He again urged me imperatively to recollect whether the wall was to my right or my left. I strained to remember. When don J uan \"called me\" and I surfaced, so to speak, I think I had the wall to my left. I was very close to it and was able to distinguish the grooves and pr otuberances of the wooden armature or mold into which the concrete had been pour ed. Very thin strips of wood ha d been used and the pattern they had created was compact The wall was very high. O ne end of it was visible to me, and I noticed that it did not have a corner but curved around. He sat in silence for a moment, as if he were thinking how to decipher the meaning of my experience; he finally said that I had not accomplished a great deal, that I had fallen short of what he expected me to do. \"What was I suppos ed to do? \" He did not answer but made a puckering ge sture with his lips. \"You di d very well,\" he said. \"Today you l earned that a brujo uses the water to move.\" \"But did I see?\" He looked at me with a curious expression. H e rolled his eyes and said that I had to go i nto the green mist a good m any times until I could answer that question m yself. He changed the direction of our conversation in a subtle way, saying I had not really learned how to move using the water, but I had learned that a brujo could do that, and he had deliberately told me to look a t the bank of the stream so I could check my movement. \"You m oved very fast,\" he said, \"as fast as a man who know s how to perform this technique. I had a hard time keeping up w ith you.\" I begged him to explain what had happened to me from the beginning. H e laughed, shaking hi s head slowly as though i n disbelief. \"You always insist on know ing things from the beginning,\" he said. \"But there's no be ginning; the beginning is only in your thought .\" \"I think the beginning was when I sat on the bank and smoked,\" I said. \"But before you s moked I had to figure out what to do w ith you,\" he said. \"I would have to tell you w hat I did and I can't do that, because it would take me to still another point. So perhaps things would be clearer to you if you di dn't think about beginnings.\" \"Then tell me what happened after I sat on the bank and smoked\" 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"\"I think you ha ve told me that already,\" he said, laughing. \"Was anything I did of any importance, don J uan?\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"You followed my directions very well and ha d no pr oblem getting into and out of the fog. T hen you l istened to my voi ce and returned to the surface every time I called you. T hat was the exercise. The rest was very easy. You simply let the fog carry you. Y ou be haved as though you kne w what to do. W hen you w ere very far away I called you a gain and m ade you l ook a t the bank, so you w ould know how far you ha d gone . Then I pulled you back.\" \"You m ean, don J uan, that I really traveled in the water?\" \"You di d. And ve ry far too.\" \"How far?\" \"You wouldn't believe it.\" I tried to coax him into telling m e, but he dropped the subject and said he had to leave for a while. I insisted that he should at least give me a hint. \"I don't like to be kept in the dark,\" I said. \"You ke ep your self in the dark,\" he said. \"Think about the wall you s aw. Sit down here on your mat and remember every detail of it. Then perhaps you yourself may discover how far you w ent. All I know now is that you t raveled very far. I know that because I had a terrible time pulling you ba ck. If I had not been around, you m ight have wandered off and ne ver returned, in which case all that would be left of you now would be your dead body on t he side of the stream. Or perhaps you might have returned by your self. With you I 'm not sure. So judging by t he effort it took m e to bring you ba ck, I'd say you w ere clearly in ...\" He made a long pa use; he stared at me in a friendly way. \"I would go a s far as the mountains of central Mexico,\" he said. \"I don't know how far you w ould go, pe rhaps as far as Los Angeles, or perhaps even as far as Brazil.\" Don Juan returned the next day late in the afternoon. In the meantime I had written dow n everything I could recollect about my perception. W hile I wrote, it occurred to me to follow the banks up and dow n the stream in each direction and corroborate whether I had actually seen a feature on either side that might have elicited in me the image of a wall. I conjectured that don Juan might have made me walk, in a state of stupor, and then might have made me focus my attention on s ome wall on the way. In the hour s that elapsed between the tune I first detected the fog and the time I got out of the ditch and went back to his hous e, I calculated that if he had made me walk, we could have walked, at the most, two and a half miles. So I followed the banks of the stream for about three miles in each direction, carefully observing every feature which might have been pertinent to my vision of the wall. The stream was, as far as I could tell, a plain canal used for irrigation. It was four to five feet wide throughout its length and I could not find any vi sible features in it that would have reminded me or forced the image of a concrete wall. When don J uan arrived at his hous e in the late afternoon I accosted him and insisted on r eading m y account to htm. He refused to listen and m ade me sit down. He sat facing m e. He was not smiling. H e seemed to be thinking, judging by t he penetrating look i n his eyes, which were fixed above the horizon. \"I think you m ust be aware by now ,\" he said in a tone that was suddenly very severe, \"that everything is mortally dangerous. The water is as deadly as the guardian. If you don' t watch out the water will trap you. I t nearly did that yesterday. But in order to be trapped a man has to be willing. T here's your trouble. You're willing to abandon your self.\" I did not know what he was talking about. His attack on m e had been so sudden that I was disoriented. I feebly asked him to explain himself. He reluctantly mentioned that he had gone to the water canyon a nd ha d \"seen\" the spirit of the water hole and ha d the profound c onviction I had flubbed my chances to \"see\" the water. \"How?\" I asked, truly baffled. \"The spirit is a force,\" he said, \"and as such, it responds only to strength. You cannot indulge in its presence.\" 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"\"When did I indulge?\" \"Yesterday, when you be came green in the water.\" \"I did not indulge. I thought it was a very important moment and I told you w hat was happening to me.\" \"Who are you t o think or decide what is important? You know nothing about the forces you're tapping. T he spirit of the water hole exists out there and could have helped you; in fact it was helping you unt il you f lubbed it. Now I don't know what will be the outcome of your doings. You ha ve succumbed to the force of the water-hole spirit and now it can take you a ny time.\" \"Was it wrong t o look a t myself turning gr een?\" \"You abandone d your self. You willed to abandon your self. That was wrong. I have told you t his already and I will repeat it again. You can survive in the world of a brujo onl y if you a re a warrior. A warrior treats every- thing with respect and doe s not trample on anything unl ess he has to. You di d not treat the water with respect yesterday. Usually you be have very well. However, yesterday you a bandone d your self to your death, like a god- damned fool. A warrior does not abandon hi mself to anything, not even to his death. A warrior is not a willing partner; a warrior is not available, and if he involves him-self with something, you c an be sure that he is aware of what he is doing.\" I did not know what to say. Don Juan was almost angry. That disturbed me. Don Juan had rarely behaved in such a way with me. I told him that I truly had no i dea I was doing something wrong. A fter some minutes of tense silence he took of f his hat and smiled and told me that I had gained control over my indulging self. He stressed that I had to avoid water and ke ep it from touching the surface of my body f or three or four months. \"I don't think I could go w ithout taking a shower,\" I said. Don Juan laughed unt il tears rolled dow n his cheeks. \"You can't go w ithout a shower! At times you're so weak I think you' re putting m e on. B ut it is not a joke. At times you r eally have no control and the forces of your life take you f reely.\" I raised the point that it was hum anly impossible to be controlled at all times. He maintained that for a warrior there was nothing out of control, I brought up the idea of accidents and said that what happened to me at the water canal could certainly be classed as an accident, since I neither meant it nor was I aware of my improper behavior. I talked about different people who ha d misfortunes that could be explained as accidents; I talked especially about Lucas, a very fine old Yaqui man who ha d suffered a serious injury when the truck he was driving ove rturned. \"It seems to me it is impossible to avoid accidents,\" I said. \"No man can control everything around hi m.\" \"True,\" don J uan said cuttingly. \"But not everything is an una voidable accident. Lucas doesn't live like a warrior. If he did, he'd know that he is waiting and what he is waiting for; and he wouldn't have driven that truck while he was drunk. H e crashed against the rock side of the road because he was drunk a nd m angled his body f or nothing. \"Life for a warrior is an exercise in strategy,\" don J uan went on. \" But you w ant to find the meaning of life. A warrior doesn't care about meanings. If Lucas lived like a warrior—and he had a chance to, as we all have a chance to—he would set his life strategically. Thus if he couldn't avoid an accident that crushed his ribs, he would have found m eans to offset that handicap, or avoid its consequences, or battle against them. If Lucas were a warrior he wouldn't be sitting in his dingy hous e dying of starvation. H e would be battling to the end.\" I posed an alternative to don J uan, using hi m as an example, and asked him what would be the outcome if he himself were to be involved in an accident that severed his legs. \"If I cannot help it, and lose my legs,\" he said, \"I won't be able to be a man any m ore, so I will join that which is waiting for me out there.\" He made a sweeping ge sture with his hand to poi nt all around hi m. I argued that he had misunderstood m e. I had meant to poi nt out that it was impossible for any single individual to foresee all the variables involved in his day-to-day actions. \"All I can say to you,\" don J uan said, \"is that a warrior is never available; never is he standing on t he road waiting to be clobbered. Thus he cuts to a minimum his chances of the unforeseen. What you c all accidents are, 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"most of the time, very easy to avoid, except for fools who are living he lter-skelter.\" \"It is not possible to live strategically all the time,\" I said. \"Imagine that someone is waiting for you w ith a powerful rifle with a telescopic sight; he could spot you a ccurately five hundr ed yards away. What would you do?\" Don Juan looked at me with an air of disbelief and then broke into laughter. \"What would you do? \" I urged him. \"If someone is waiting for me with a rifle with a telescopic sight?\" he said, obvi ously mocking m e. \"If someone is hiding out of sight, waiting for you. Y ou won't have a chance. You can't stop a bullet.\" \"No. I can't. But I still don't unde rstand your point.\" \"My poi nt is that all your strategy cannot be of any he lp in a situation like that.\" \"Oh, but it can. If someone is waiting for me with a powerful rifle with a telescopic sight I simply will not come around.\" 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"13 My next attempt at \"seeing\" took pl ace on S eptember 3, 1969. D on Juan made me smoke two bow ls of the mixture. The immediate effects were identical to those I had experienced dur ing pr evious attempts. I remember that when my body w as thoroughl y num b, don J uan held me by m y right armpit and m ade me walk into the thick desert chaparral that grows for miles around hi s hous e. I cannot recollect what I or don J uan did after we entered the brush, nor can I recall how long w e walked; at a certain moment I found I was sitting on t op of a small hill. Don Juan was sitting on m y left side, touching m e. I could not feel him but I could see him with the corner of my eye. I had the feeling that he had been talking to me although I could not remember his words. Yet I felt I knew exactly what he had said, in spite of the fact that I could not bring it back into my clear memory. I had the sensation that his words were like the cars of a train which was moving away and hi s last word was like a square caboose. I knew what that last word was but I could not say it or think clearly about it. It was a state of half- wakefulness with a dreamlike image of a train of words. Then very faintly I heard don J uan's voice talking to me. \"Now you m ust look a t me,\" he said as he turned my head to face him. He repeated the statement three or four times. I looked and de tected right away the same glowing effect I had perceived twice before while looking at his face; it was a mesmerizing m ovement, an undul atory shift of light within contained areas. There were no de finite bounda ries to those areas, and ye t the waving light never spilled ove r but moved within invisible limits. I scanned the glowing obj ect in front of me and immediately it started to lose its glow and the familiar features of don J uan's face emerged, or rather became superimposed on t he fading gl ow. I must have then focused my gaze again; don J uan's features faded and the glow intensified. I had placed my attention on a n area which must have been his left eye. I noticed that there the movement of the glow was not contained. I detected something pe rhaps resembling explosions of sparks. The explosions were rhythmical and actually sent out something like particles of light that flew out with apparent force toward me and then retreated as if they were rubber fibers. Don Juan must have turned my head around. S uddenly I found m yself looking at a plowed field. \"Now look a head,\" I heard don J uan saying. In front of me, perhaps two hundr ed yards away, was a large, long hi ll; its entire slope had been plowed. Horizontal furrows ran parallel to each other from the bottom to the very top of the hill. I noticed that in the plowed field there were quantities of small rocks and three huge boul ders that interrupted the lineality of the furrows. There were some bushes right in front of me which prevented me from observing the details of a ravine or water canyon a t the bottom of the hill. From where I was, the canyon a ppeared as a deep cut, with green vegetation m arkedly different from the barren hill. The greenness seemed to be trees that grew in the bottom of the canyon. I felt a breeze blowing in my eyes. I had a feeling of peace and pr ofound qui etness. There were no sounds of birds or insects. Don Juan spoke to me again. It took m e a moment to unde rstand what he was saying. \"Do you s ee a man in that field?\" he kept on asking. I wanted to tell him that there was no m an in that field, but I could not vocalize the words. Don Juan took m y head in his hands from behind—I could see his fingers over my eyebrows and on m y cheeks—and m ade me pan over the field, moving m y head slowly from right to left and then in the oppos ite direction. \"Watch every detail. Your life may depend on i t,\" I heard him saying ove r and ove r. He made me pan four times over the 180- degree visual horizon in front of me. At one moment, when he had moved my head to face the extreme left, I thought I detected something m oving in the field. I had a brief percep- tion of movement with the corner of my right eye. He began to shift my head back to my right and I was capable of focusing m y gaze on the plowed field. I saw a man walking alongside the furrows. He was a plain man dressed like a Mexican peasant; he wore sandals, a pair of light gray pants, a long-sleeved beige shirt, and a straw hat, and carried a light brown bag with a strap ove r his right shoulder. 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Don Juan must have noticed that I had seen the man. He asked me repeatedly if the man was looking at me or if he was coming toward me. I wanted to tell him that the man was walking away and that his back was turned to me, but I could onl y say, \"No.\" Don Juan said that if the man turned and came to me I should yell and he would turn my head away in order to protect me. I had no s ense of fear or apprehension or involvement. I coldly watched the scene. The man stopped walking at the middle of the field. He stood w ith his right foot on a ledge of a large round boul der, as if he were tying hi s sandal. Then he straightened up, pul led a string from his bag, and wrapped it around hi s left hand. H e turned his back to me and, facing the top of the hill, began scanning the area in front of him. I thought he was scanning because of the way he moved his head, which he kept turning slowly to his right; I saw him in profile, and then he began to turn his whole body t oward me until he was looking at me. He actually jerked his head, or moved it in such a way that I knew beyond a doubt that he had seen me. He extended his left arm in front of him, pointing to the ground, a nd hol ding hi s arm in that position he began to walk toward me. \"He's coming!\" I yelled without any di fficulty. Don Juan must have turned my head around, f or next I was looking at the chaparral. He told me not to gaze but look \" lightly\" at things and scan ove r them. He said that he was going to stand a short distance in front of me and then walk toward me, and that I should gaze at him until I saw his glow. I saw don J uan moving to a spot perhaps twenty yards away. He walked with such incredible speed and agility that I could hardly believe it was don J uan. He turned around a nd faced me and or dered me to gaze at him. His face was glowing; it looked like a blotch of light. The light seemed to spill over his chest almost to the middle of his body. I t was as if I were looking at a light through m y half-closed eyelids. The glow seemed to ex- pand and recede. He must have begun t o walk toward me because the light became more intense and m ore discernible. He said something to me. I struggled to unde rstand and lost my view of the glow, and then I saw don J uan as I see him in everyday life; he was a couple of feet away from me. He sat down facing m e. As I pinpointed ray attention on hi s face I began to perceive a vague glow. Then it was as if his face were crisscrossed by t hin beams of light. Don Juan's face looked as if someone were shining tiny m irrors on it; as the light became more intense the face lost its contours and was again an amorphous glowing obj ect. I perceived once more the effect of pulsating explosions of light emanating from an area which must have been his left eye. I did not focus my attention on i t, but deliberately gazed at an adjacent area which I surmised to be his right eye, I caught at once the sight of a clear, transparent pool of light. It was a liquid light. I noticed that perceiving was more than sighting; it was feeling. T he pool of dark, liquid light had an extraordinary depth. It was \"friendly,\" \"kind.\" The light that emanated from it did not explode but whirled slowly inward, creating exquisite reflections. The glow had a very lovely and de licate way of touching m e, of soothing me, which gave me a sensation of exquisiteness. I saw a symmetrical ring of brilliant dashes of light that expanded rhythmically on t he vertical plain of the glowing area. The ring expanded to cover nearly all the glowing surface and then contracted to a point of light in the middle of the brilliant pool . I saw the ring expanding and contracting several times. Then I deliberately moved back without losing m y gaze and was capable of seeing bot h eyes. I distinguished the rhythm of both types of light explosions. The left eye sent out dashes of tight that actually protruded out of the vertical plain, while the right eye sent out dashes that radiated without protruding. T he rhythm of the two eyes was alternating, the light of the left eye exploded out ward while the radiating light beams of the right eye contracted and whirled inward. Then the light of the right eye extended to cover the whole glowing surface while the exploding light of the left eye receded. Don Juan must have turned me around onc e more, for I was again looking at the plowed field. I heard him telling m e to watch the man. The man was standing by t he boul der looking at me. I could not distinguish his features; his hat covered most of his face. After a moment he tucked his bag unde r his right arm and be gan to walk away toward my right. He walked almost to the end of the plowed area, changed direction, and took a few steps toward the gully. Then I lost control of my focusing and he vanished and so did the total scenery. The 96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"image of the desert shrubs became superimposed on i t. I do not recollect how I returned to don J uan's hous e, nor do I remember what he did to me to \"bring m e back.\" When I woke up I was lying on m y straw mat in don J uan's room. He came to my side and he lped me up. I was dizzy; my stomach was upset. Don Juan in a very qui ck and efficient manner dragged me to the shrubs at the side of his hous e. I got sick and he laughed. Afterwards I felt better. I looked at my watch; it was eleven P . M . I went back to sleep and by one o'clock the next afternoon I thought I was myself again. Don Juan kept asking m e how I felt. I had the sensation of being absent-minded. I could not really concen- trate. I walked around t he hous e for a while unde r don J uan's close scrutiny. H e followed me around. I felt there was nothing to do a nd I went back to sleep. I woke up in the late afternoon f eeling m uch better. I found a great many m ashed leaves around m e. In fact when I woke up I was lying on m y stomach on t op of a pile of leaves. Their scent was very strong. I remember becoming aware of the scent before I fully woke up. I wandered to the back and found don J uan sitting by t he irrigation di tch. When he saw me approaching he made frantic gestures to make me stop and go ba ck into the hous e. \"Run inside!\" he yelled. I ran into the hous e and he joined me a while later. \"Don't ever come after me,\" he said. \"If you w ant to see me wait for me here.\" I apologized. He told me not to waste myself in silly apologies which did not have the power to cancel my acts. He said that he had had a very difficult tune bringing m e back and that he had been interceding for me at the water. \"We have to take a chance now and wash you i n the water,\" he said. I assured him I felt fine. He gazed into my eyes for a long t ime. \"Come with me,\" he said. \"I'm going to put you i n the water.\" \"I'm fine,\" I said. \"Look, I 'm taking not es.\" He pulled me up from my mat with considerable force. \"Don't indulge!\" he said. \"In no t ime at all you w ill fall asleep again. Maybe I won't be able to wake you up this time.\" We ran to the back of his hous e. Before we reached the water he told me in a most dramatic tone to shut my eyes tight and not open them until he said to. He told me that if I gazed at the water even for an instant I might die. He led me by the hand and dunke d me into the irrigation di tch head first. I kept my eyes shut as he went on submerging and pul ling m e out of the water for hour s. The change I experienced was remarkable. Whatever was wrong w ith me before I entered the water was so subtle that I did not really not ice it until I compared it with the feeling of well-being and alertness I had while don J uan kept me in the irrigation canal. Water got into my nos e and I began to sneeze. Don Juan pul led me out and led me, with my eyes still closed, into the hous e. He made me change my clothes and then gui ded me into his room, had me sit down on m y mat, arranged the direction of my body, a nd then told me to ope n my eyes. I opened them and what I saw caused me to jump back and gr ab ont o his leg. I experienced a tremendous ly confusing m oment. Don Juan rapped me with his knuc kles on the very top of my head. It was a quick blow which was not hard or painful but somehow shock- ing. \"What is the matter with you? What did you s ee?\" he asked. Upon ope ning m y eyes I had seen the same scene I had watched before. I had seen the same man. This time, however, he was almost touching m e. I saw his face. There was an air of familiarity about it. I almost knew who he was. The scene vanished when don J uan hit me on the head. I looked up a t don J uan. He had his hand ready to hit me again. He laughed and asked if I would like to get another blow. I let go of his leg and relaxed on m y mat. He ordered me to look s traight ahead and not to turn around f or any reason in the direction of the water at the back of his hous e. I then not iced for the first tune that it was pitch black in the room. For a moment I was not sure whether I had 97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"my eyes open. I touched them with my hands to make sure. I called don J uan loudly and told him something was wrong w ith my eyes; I could not see at all, while a moment before I had seen him ready to hit me. I heard his laughter over my head to my right, and then he lit his kerosene lantern. My eyes adapted to the light in a matter of seconds. Everything was as it always had been: the wattle-and-daub walls of the room and the strangely contorted, dry medicinal roots hanging on t hem; the bundl es of herbs; the thatched roof; the kerosene lantern hanging from a beam. I had seen the room hundr eds of times, yet this time there was something uni que about it and about myself. This was the first time I did not believe in the final \"reality\" of my perception. I had been edging toward that feeling and I had perhaps intellectualized it at various times, but never had I been at the brink of a serious doubt . This time, how ever, I did not believe the room was \"real,\" and for a moment I had the strange sensation that it was a scene which would vanish if don J uan rapped me on top of my head with his knuc kles. I began to shiver without being cold. Nervous spasms ran dow n my spine. My head felt heavy, especially in the area right above my neck. I complained that I did not feel well and told him what I had seen. He laughed at me, saying that to succumb to fright was a miserable indulgence. \"You're frightened without being afraid,\" he said. \"You saw the ally staring at you, bi g deal. Wait until you have him face to face before you s hit in your pants.\" He told me to get up and walk to my car without turning around i n the direction of the water, and to wait for him while he got a rope and a shovel. He made me drive to a place where we had found a tree stump. We proceeded to dig it out in the darkness. I worked terribly hard for hour s. We did not get the stump out but I felt much better. We went back to his hous e and ate and things were again perfectly \"real\" and commonplace. \"What happened to me?\" I asked. \"What did I do ye sterday?\" \"You smoked me and then you s moked an ally ,\" he said. \"I beg your pardon?\" Don Juan laughed and said that next I was going to demand that he start telling m e everything from the be- ginning. \"You smoked me,\" he repeated. \"You ga zed into my face, into my eyes. You saw the lights that mark a man's face. I am a sorcerer, you s aw that in my eyes. You di d not know that, though, be cause this is the first time you've done it. The eyes of men are not all alike. You will soon f ind that out. Then you s moked an ally .\" \"Do you m ean the man in the field?\" \"That was not a man, that was an ally beckoning you.\" \"Where did we go? Where were we when I saw that man, I mean that ally ?\" Don Juan made a gesture with his chin to poi nt out an area in front of his hous e and said that he had taken me to the top of a small hill. I said that the scenery I had viewed had not hing to do w ith the desert chaparral around his hous e and he replied that the ally that had \"beckoned\" me was not from the surroundi ngs. \"Where is it from?\" \"I'll take you t here very soon.\" \"What is the meaning of my vision?\" \"You were learning to see, that was all; but now you a re about to lose your pants because you i ndulge; you have abandone d your self to your fright. Maybe you s hould describe everything you s aw.\" When I started to describe the way his own face had appeared to me, he made me stop and said that it was of no importance whatsoever, I told him that I had almost seen him as a \"luminous egg.\" He said that \"almost\" was not enough a nd that seeing was going to take me a great deal of time and work. He was interested in the scene of the plowed field and in every detail I could remember about the man. \"That ally was beckoning you,\" he said \"I made you m ove your head when he came to you not because he was endangering you but because it is better to wait. You are not in a hurry. A warrior is never idle and ne ver in a hurry. To meet an ally without being pr epared is like attacking a lion with your farts.\" I liked the metaphor. We had a delightful moment of laughter. \"What would've happened if you ha dn't moved my head?\" \"You would've had to move your head your self.\" 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"\"And if I didn't?\" \"The ally would have come to you a nd scared you s tiff. If you ha d been alone he might have killed you. I t is not advisable for you t o be alone in the mountains or the desert until you c an defend your self. An ally might catch you a lone there and m ake mincemeat out of you.\" \"What was the meaning of the acts he performed?\" \"By looking at you he meant he welcomes you. H e showed you t hat you ne ed a spirit catcher and a pouc h, but not from this area; his bag was from another part of the country. You ha ve three stumbling bl ocks in your way that make you s top; those were the boul ders. And you de finitely are going to get your best powers in water canyons and gul lies; the ally pointed out the gully to you. T he rest of the scene was meant to help you l ocate the exact place to find hi m. I know now where the place is. I will take you t here very soon.\" \"Do you m ean that the scenery I saw really exists? \"Of course.\" \"Where?\" \"I cannot tell you t hat.\" \"How would I find that area?\" \"I cannot tell you t hat either, and not because I don't want to but because I simply don' t know how to tell you.\" I wanted to know the meaning of seeing the same scene while I was in his room. Don Juan laughed and imitated me holding ont o his leg. \"That was a reaffirmation that the ally wants you,\" he said. \"He made sure you or I knew that he was welcoming you.\" \"What about the face I saw?\" \"It is a familiar face to you be cause you know him. You ha ve seen it before. Maybe it is the face of your death. You got frightened but that was your carelessness. He was waiting for you a nd when he showed up you succumbed to fright. Fortunately I was there to hit you or he would've turned against you, w hich would have been onl y proper. To meet an ally a man must be a spotless warrior or the ally may turn against him and de stroy him.\" Don Juan dissuaded me from going ba ck to Los Angeles the next morning. A pparently he thought I still had not totally recovered. He insisted that I sit inside his room facing the southeast, in order to preserve my strength. He sat to my left, handed me my not ebook, a nd said that this time I had him pinned dow n; he not only had to stay with me, he also had to talk to me. \"I have to take you t o the water again in the twilight,\" he said. \"You're not solid yet and you s houldn't be alone today. I'll keep you c ompany all morning; in the afternoon you' ll be in better shape.\" His concern made me feel very apprehensive. \"What's wrong w ith me?\" I asked. \"You've tapped an ally .\" \"What do you m ean by t hat?\" \"We must not talk about allies today. Let us talk about anything else.\" I really did not want to talk at all. I had begun t o feel anxious and restless. Don Juan apparently found t he situation ut terly ludicrous; he laughed till the tears came. \"Don't tell me that at a time when you s hould talk you a re not going to find anything to say,\" he said, his eyes shining with a mischievous glint. His mood w as very soothing to me. There was only one topic that interested me at that moment: the ally . His face was so familiar; it was not as if I knew him or as if I had seen him before. It was something else. Every time I began to think about his face my mind experienced a bom bardment of other thought s, as if some part of myself knew the secret but did not allow the rest of me to come close to it. The sensation of the ally 's face being familiar was so eerie that it had forced me into a state of morbid melancholy. Don Juan had said that it might have been the face of my death. I think that 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"statement had clinched me. I wanted desperately to ask about it and I had the clear sensation that don J uan was holding m e back. I took a couple of deep breaths and bl urted out a question. \"What is death, don J uan?\" \"I don't know ,\" he said, smiling. \"I mean, how would you de scribe death? I want your opinions. I think everybody ha s definite opinions about death.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" I had the Tibetan Book of the Dead in the trunk of my car. It occurred to me to use it as a topic of conversation, since it dealt with death. I said I was going to read it to him and be gan to get up. H e made me sit down and went out and got the book hi mself. \"The morning is a bad time for sorcerers,\" he said as an explanation for my having to stay put . \"You're too weak to leave my room. Inside here you a re protected. If you w ere to wander off now, chances are that you w ould find a terrible disaster. An ally could kill you on t he road or in the bush, and later on w hen they found your body t hey would say that you ha d either died mysteriously or had an accident.\" I was in no pos ition or mood t o que stion hi s decisions, so I stayed put nearly all morning reading and explaining some parts of the book t o him. He listened attentively and di d not interrupt me at all. Twice I had to stop for short periods of time while he brought some water and food, but as soon a s he was free again he urged me to continue reading. H e seemed to be very interested. When I finished he looked at me. \"I don't unde rstand why those people talk about death as if death were like life,\" he said softly. \"Maybe that's the way they unde rstand it. Do you t hink the Tibetans see?\" \"Hardly. When a man learns to see, not a single thing he know s prevails. Not a single one. If the Tibetans could see they could tell right away that not a single thing is any longer the same. Once we see, nothing is know n; nothing remains as we used to know it when we didn't see.\" \"Perhaps, don J uan, seeing is not the same for everyone.\" \"True. It's not the same. Still, that does not mean that the meanings of life prevail. When one learns to see, not a single thing is the same.\" \"Tibetans obvi ously think that death is like life. What do you t hink de ath is like, your self?\" I asked. \"I don't think de ath is like anything and I think the Tibetans must be talking about something else. At any rate, what they're talking about is not death.\" \"What do you t hink they're talking about?\" \"Maybe you c an tell me that. You're the one who reads.\" I tried to say something else but he began to laugh. \"Perhaps the Tibetans really see,\" don J uan went on, \" in which case they must have realized that what they see makes no sense at all and they wrote that bunc h of crap because it doesn't make any di fference to them; in which case what they wrote is not crap at all.\" \"I really don' t care about what the Tibetans have to say,\" I said, \"but I certainly care about what you ha ve to say. I would like to hear what you t hink about death.\" He stared at me for an instant and then giggled. He opened his eyes and raised his eyebrows in a comical gesture of surprise. \"Death is a whorl,\" he said. \"Death is the face of the ally ; death is a shiny cloud ove r the horizon; death is the whisper of Mescalito in your ears; death is the toothless mouth of the guardian; death is Genaro sitting on hi s head; death is me talking; death is you a nd your writing pa d; death is nothing. N othing! It is here yet it isn't here at all.\" Don Juan laughed with great delight. His laughter was like a song, i t had a sort of dancing rhythm. \"I make no sense, huh? \" don J uan said. \"I cannot tell you w hat death is like. But perhaps I could tell you about your own death. There is no w ay of know ing what it will be like for sure; however, I could tell you w hat it may be like.\" 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"I became frightened at that point and argued that I only wanted to know what death appeared to be like to him; I emphasized that I was interested in his opinions about death in a general sense, but did not care to know about the particulars of anybody' s personal death, especially my own. \"I can't talk about death except in personal terms,\" he said. \"You wanted me to tell you a bout death. All right! Then don' t be afraid of hearing about your own death.\" I admitted that I was too ne rvous to talk about it. I said that I wanted to talk about death in general terms, as he himself had done when he told me that at the time of his son Eulalio's death, life and de ath mixed like a fog of crystals. \"I told you t hat my son's life expanded at the time of his personal death,\" he said. \"I was not talking about death in general but about my son's death. Death, whatever it is, made his life expand.\" I definitely wanted to steer the conversation out of the realm of particulars, and m entioned that I had been reading accounts of people who ha d died for several minutes and ha d been revived through m edical techniques. In all the cases I had read, the persons involved had made statements, upon r eviving, that they could not recollect anything at all; that dying was simply a sensation of blacking out . \"That's perfectly unde rstandable,\" he said. \"Death has two stages. The first is a blackout. It is a meaningless stage, very similar to the first effect of Mescalito, in which one experiences a lightness that makes one feel happy, c omplete, and that everything in the world is at ease. But that is only a shallow state; it soon va nishes and one enters a new realm, a realm of harshness and pow er. That second s tage is the real encounter with Mescalito. Death is very much like this. The first stage is a shallow blackout. The second, how ever, is the real stage where one meets with death; it is a brief moment, after the first blackout, when we find that we are, somehow, ourselves again. It is then that death smashes against us with qui et fury and pow er until it dissolves our lives into not hing.\" \"How can you be sure that you a re talking about death?\" \"I have my ally . The little smoke has shown me my unmistakable death with great clarity. This is why I can only talk about personal death.\" Don Juan's words caused me a profound a pprehension and a dramatic ambivalence. I had a feeling he was going to describe the overt, commonplace details of my death and tell me how or when I was going to die. The mere thought of know ing that made me despair and at the same time provoke d my curiosity. I could have asked him to describe his own death, of course, but I felt that such a request would be rather rude and I ruled it out automatically. Don Juan seemed to be enjoying m y conflict. His body c onvul sed with laughter. \"Do you w ant to know what your death may be like?\" he asked me with childlike delight in his face. I found hi s mischievous pleasure in teasing m e rather comforting. It almost took t he edge off my apprehension. \"O.K., tell me,\" I said, and m y voi ce cracked. He had a formidable explosion of laughter. He held his stomach and rolled on hi s side and m ockingly repeated, \" 'O.K., tell me,'\" with a crack in his voice. Then he straightened out and sat down, assuming a feigned stiffness, and in a tremulous voice he said, \"The second s tage of your death may very well be as follows.\" His eyes examined me with apparently genuine curiosity. I laughed. I clearly realized that his making fun was the only device that could dul l the edge of the idea of one's death. \"You dr ive a great deal,\" he went on saying, \"so you m ay find your self, at a given moment, behind the wheel again. It will be a very fast sensation that won't give you t ime to think. S uddenly, let's say, you w ould find yourself driving, as you ha ve done thousands of times. But before you c ould wonder about your self, you w ould notice a strange formation in front of your windshield. If you l ooked closer you'd realize that it is a cloud t hat looks like a shiny whorl. It would resemble, let's say, a face, right in the middle of the sky in front of you. A s you watched it, you w ould see it moving ba ckward unt il it was only a brilliant point in the distance, and then you would not ice that it began moving toward you a gain; it would pick up s peed and in a blink of an eye it would smash against the windshield of your car. You are strong; I'm sure it would take death a couple of whams to get 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"you. \"By then you w ould know where you w ere and what was happening to you; the face would recede again to a position on t he horizon, w ould pick up s peed and smash against you. T he face would enter inside you a nd then you'd know —it was the ally 's face all the time, or it was me talking, or you w riting. D eath was nothing all the time. Nothing. It was a little dot lost in the sheets of your notebook. A nd ye t it would enter inside you w ith uncontrollable force and would make you e xpand; it would make you f lat and extend you ove r the sky and the earth and be yond. A nd you w ould be like a fog of tiny crystals moving, m oving away.\" I was very taken by hi s description of my death. I had expected to hear something so different. I could not say anything for a long t ime. \"Death enters through t he belly,\" he continued. \"Right through t he gap of the will. That area is the most important and sensitive part of man. It is the area of the will and also the area through w hich all of us die. I know it because my ally has guided me to that stage. A sorcerer tunes his will by letting hi s death ove rtake him, and when he is fiat and be gins to expand, hi s impeccable will takes over and assembles the fog into one person again.\" Don Juan made a strange gesture. He opened his hands like two fans, lifted them to the level of his elbows, turned them until his thumbs were touching hi s sides, and then brought them slowly together at the center of his body ove r his navel. He kept them there for a moment. His arms shivered with the strain. Then he brought them up unt il the tips of his middle fingers touched his forehead, and then pul led them down in the same position to the center of his body. It was a formidable gesture. Don Juan had performed it with such force and be auty that I was spellbound. \"It is his will which assembles a sorcerer,\" he said, \"but as his old age makes him feeble his will wanes and a moment unavoidably comes when he is no longer capable of commanding hi s will. He then has nothing with which to oppos e the silent force of his death, and hi s life becomes like the lives of all his fellow men, an expanding fog m oving be yond i ts limits.\" Don Juan stared at me and stood up. I was shivering. \"You can go t o the bushes now,\" he said. \"It is afternoon.\" I needed to go but I did not dare. I felt perhaps more jumpy than afraid. However, I was no longer apprehensive about the ally . Don Juan said that it did not matter how I felt as long a s I was \"solid.\" He assured me I was in perfect shape and could safely go i nto the bushes as long a s I did not get close to the water. \"That is another matter,\" he said. \"I need to wash you onc e more, so stay away from the water.\" Later on he wanted me to drive him to the nearby town. I mentioned that driving would be a welcome change for me because I was still shaky; the idea that a sorcerer actually played with his death was quite gruesome to me. \"To be a sorcerer is a terrible burden,\" he said in a reassuring tone. \"I've told you t hat it is much better to learn to see. A man who sees is everything; in comparison, the sorcerer is a sad fellow.\" \"What is sorcery, don J uan?\" He looked at me for a long t ime as he shook hi s head almost imperceptibly. \"Sorcery is to apply one 's will to a key joint,\" he said. \"Sorcery is interference. A sorcerer searches and finds the key joint of anything he wants to affect and then he applies his will to it. A sorcerer doesn't have to see to be a sorcerer, all he has to know is how to use his will.\" I asked him to explain what he meant by a key joint. He thought for a while and then he said that he knew what my car was. \"It's obvi ously a machine,\" I said. \"I mean your car is the spark plugs. That's its key joint for me. I can apply my will to it and your car won't work.\" Don Juan got into my car and sat down. He beckoned me to do l ikewise as he made himself comfortable on the seat. \"Watch what I do,\" he said. \"I'm a crow, so first I'll make my feathers loose.\" 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"He shivered his entire body. H is movement reminded me of a sparrow wetting its feathers in a puddl e. He lowered his head like a bird dipping its beak into the water. \"That feels really good,\" he said, and be gan to laugh. His laughter was strange. It had a very peculiar mesmerizing effect on m e. I recollected having he ard him laugh i n that manner many times before. Perhaps the reason I had never become overtly aware of it was that he had never laughed like that long e nough i n my presence. \"A crow loosens its neck next,\" he said, and be gan twisting hi s neck and rubbing hi s cheeks on hi s shoulders. \"Then he looks at the world with one eye and then with the other.\" His head shook a s he allegedly shifted his view of the world from one eye to the other. The pitch of his laughter became higher. I had the absurd feeling that he was going to turn into a crow in front of my eyes. I wanted to laugh i t off but I was almost paralyzed. I actually felt some kind of enveloping force around m e. I was not afraid nor was I dizzy or sleepy. M y faculties were unimpaired, to the best of my judgm ent. \"Turn on your car now,\" don J uan said. I turned on t he starter and automatically stepped on t he gas pedal. The starter began to grind without igniting the engine. Don Juan's laughter was a soft, rhythmical cackle. I tried it again; and again. I spent perhaps ten minutes grinding the starter of my car. Don Juan cackled all that time. Then I gave up and sat there with a heavy head. He stopped laughing and scrutinized me and I \"knew\" then that his laughter had forced me into a sort of hypnot ic trance. Although I had been thoroughl y aware of what was taking pl ace, I felt I was not myself. During the time I could not start my car I was very doc ile, almost num b. It was as if don J uan was not only doi ng something to my car but also to me. When he stopped cackling I was convinced the spell was over, and impetuously I turned on t he starter again. I had the certainty don J uan had onl y mesmerized me with his laughter and m ade me believe I could not start my car. With the corner of my eye I saw him looking curiously at me as I ground t he motor and pum ped the gas furiously. Don Juan patted me gently and said that fury would make me \"solid\" and pe rhaps I would not need to be washed in the water again. The more furious I could get, the quicker I could recover from my encounter with the ally . \"Don't be embarrassed,\" I heard don J uan saying. \"Kick the car.\" His natural everyday laughter exploded, and I felt ridiculous and laughed sheepishly. After a while don J uan said he had released the car. It started! 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"14 September 28,1969 There was something eerie about don J uan's hous e. For a moment I thought he was hiding somewhere around the place to scare me. I called out to him and then gathered enough ne rve to walk inside. Don Juan was not there. I put the two bags of groceries I had brought on a pile of firewood a nd sat down to wait for him, as I had done dozens of times before. But for the first time in my years of associating with don J uan I was afraid to stay alone in his hous e. I felt a presence, as if someone invisible was there with me. I remembered then that years before I had had the same vague feeling that something unknow n was prowling around m e when I was alone. I jumped to my feet and ran out of the hous e. I had come to see don J uan to tell him that the cumulative effect of the task of \"seeing\" was taking its toll on me. I had begun t o feel uneasy; vaguely apprehensive without any ove rt reason; tired without being fatigued. Then my reaction at being alone in don J uan's hous e brought back the total memory of how my fear had bui lt up in the past. The fear traced back to years before, when don J uan had forced the very strange confrontation be tween a sor- ceress, a woman he called \"la Catalina,\" and m e. It began on N ovember 23, 1961, w hen I found hi m in his hous e with a dislocated ankle. He explained that he had an enemy, a sorceress who could turn into a blackbird and who had attempted to kill him. \"As soon a s I can walk I'm going to show you w ho the woman is,\" don J uan said. \"You m ust know who she is,\" \"Why doe s she want to kill you? \" He shrugged his shoulders impatiently and refused to say anything else. I came back to see him ten days later and found hi m perfectly well. He rotated his ankle to demonstrate to me mat it was fine and attributed his prompt recovery to the nature of the cast he himself had made. \"It's good you' re here,\" he said. \"Today I'm going to take you on a little journey.\" He then directed me to drive to a desolate area. We stopped there; don J uan stretched his legs and m ade him- self comfortable on the seat, as if he were going to take a nap. He told me to relax and remain very qui et; he said we had to be as inconspicuous as possible until nightfall because the late afternoon w as a very dangerous time for the business we were pursuing. \"What kind of business are we pursuing?\" I asked. \"We are here to stake out la Catalina,\" he said. When it was fairly dark we slid out of the car and walked very slowly and noi selessly into the desert chap- arral. From the place where we stopped I could distinguish the black silhouette of the hills on bot h sides. We were in a flat, fairly wide canyon. D on Juan gave me detailed instructions on how to stay merged with the chaparral and taught me a way to sit \"in vigil,\" as he called it. He told me to tuck my right leg unde r my left thigh and ke ep my left leg in a squat position. H e explained that the tucked leg was used as a spring in order to stand up w ith great speed, if it were necessary. He then told me to sit facing the west, because that was the direction of the woman's hous e. He sat next to me, to my right, and told me in a whisper to keep my eyes focused on t he ground, searching, or rather, waiting, for a sort of wind wave that would make a ripple in the bushes. Whenever the ripple touched the bushes on w hich I had focused my gaze, I was supposed to look up a nd see the sorceress in all her \"magnificent evil splendor.\" Don Juan actually used those words. When I asked him to explain what he meant, he said that if I detected a ripple I simply had to look up a nd see for myself, because \"a sorcerer in flight\" was such a unique sight that it defied explanations. There was a fairly steady wind and I thought I detected a ripple in the bushes many times. I looked up e ach time, prepared to have a transcendental experience, but I did not see anything. E very time the wind bl ew the bushes don J uan would kick the ground vi gorously, whirling around, m oving hi s arms as if they were whips. The strength of his movements was extraordinary. 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"After a few failures to see the sorceress \"in flight\" I was sure I was not going to witness any transcendental event, yet don J uan's display of \"power\" was so exquisite that I did not mind spending the night there. At daybreak don J uan sat down by m e. He seemed to be totally exhausted. He could hardly move. He lay down on hi s back and m umbled that he had failed to \"pierce the woman.\" I was very intrigued by t hat statement; he repeated it several times and each time his tone became more downhearted, more desperate. I began to experience an unus ual anxiety. I found i t very easy to project my feelings into don J uan's mood. Don Juan did not mention anything about the incident or the woman for several months. I thought he had either forgotten or resolved the whole affair. One day, how ever, I found hi m in a very agitated mood, a nd in a manner that was completely incongruous with his natural calmness he hold me that the \"blackbird\" had stood i n front of him the night before, almost touching hi m, and that he had not even awakened. The woman's artfulness was so great that he had not felt her presence at all. He said his good f ortune was to wake up in the nick of time to stage a horrendous fight for his life. Don Juan's tone of voice was moving, almost pathetic. I felt an overwhelming surge of compassion and concern. In a somber and dr amatic tone he reaffirmed that he had no w ay to stop he r and that the next time she came near him was going to be his last day on e arth. I became desponde nt and was nearly in tears. Don Juan seemed to notice my profound c oncern and laughed, I thought , bravely. He patted me on the back and said that I should not worry, that he was not altogether lost yet, because he had one last card, a trump card. \"A warrior lives strategically,\" he said, smiling. \"A warrior never carries loads he cannot handle.\" Don Juan's smile had the power to dispel the ominous clouds of doom . I suddenly felt elated and we both laughed. He patted my head. \"You know , of all the things on this earth, you a re my last card,\" he said abruptly, looking straight into my eyes. \"What?\" \"You are my trump card in my fight against that witch.\" I did not unde rstand what he meant and he explained that the woman did not know me and that if I played my hand as he would direct me, I had a better than good c hance to \"pierce her.\" \"What do you m ean by pi erce her'?\" \"You cannot kill her but you m ust pierce her like a balloon. I f you do t hat she'll leave me alone. But don't think about it now. I'll tell you w hat to do w hen the time comes.\" Months went by. I had forgotten the incident and was caught by surprise when I arrived at his hous e one day; don J uan came out running and di d not let me get out of my car. \"You m ust leave immediately,\" he whispered with appalling ur gency. \"Listen carefully. Buy a shotgun, or get one in any way you c an; don't bring m e your own gun, do you unde rstand? Get any gun, e xcept your own, and br ing it here right away.\" \"Why do you w ant a shotgun?\" \"Go now !\" I returned with a shotgun. I had not had enough m oney to buy one but a friend of mine had given me his old gun. D on Juan did not look a t it; he explained, laughing, that he had been abrupt with me because the blackbird was on the roof of the hous e and he did not want her to see me. \"Finding the blackbird on t he roof gave me the idea that you c ould bring a gun a nd pi erce her with it,\" don Juan said emphatically. \"I don't want anything to happen to you, s o I suggested that you buy t he gun or that you get one in any ot her way. You see, you ha ve to destroy the gun a fter completing the task.\" \"What kind of task are you t alking about?\" \"You m ust attempt to pierce the woman with your shotgun.\" He made me clean the gun by r ubbing it with the fresh leaves and stems of a peculiarly scented plant. He himself rubbed two shells and pl aced them inside the barrels. Then he said I was to hide in front of his hous e and wait until the blackbird landed on t he roof and then, after taking careful aim, I was suppos ed to let go w ith bot h barrels. The effect of the surprise, more than the pellets, would pierce the woman, and if I were powerful and 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"determined I could force her to leave him alone. Thus my aim had to be impeccable and so did my determination to pierce her. \"You m ust scream at the moment you s hoot,\" he said. \"It must be a potent and pi ercing ye ll.\" He then piled bundl es of bamboo a nd fire sticks about ten feet away from the ramada of his hous e. He made me lean against the piles. The position was quite comfortable. I was sort of half-seated; my back was well propped and I had a good vi ew of the roof. He said it was too early for the witch to be out, and that we had unt il dusk to do a ll the preparations; he would then pretend he was locking hi mself inside the hous e, in order to attract her and elicit another attack on hi s person. H e told me to relax and find a comfortable position that I could shoot from without moving. H e made me aim at the roof a couple of times and concluded that the act of lifting the gun t o my shoulder and taking aim was too slow and cumbersome. He then bui lt a prop for the gun. H e made two deep hol es with a pointed iron ba r, planted two forked sticks in them, and tied a long pol e in between the forks. The structure gave me a shooting support and allowed me to keep the gun a imed at the roof. Don Juan looked at the sky and said it was time for him to go i nto the hous e. He got up and calmly went inside, giving m e the final admonition that my endeavor was not a joke and that I had to hit the bird with the first shot. After don J uan left I had a few more minutes of twilight and then it became quite dark. It seemed as if darkness had been waiting unt il I was alone and suddenly it descended on m e. I tried to focus my eyes on the roof, which was silhouetted against the sky; for a while there was enough l ight on the horizon so the line of the roof was still visible, but then the sky be came black and I could hardly see the hous e. I kept my eyes focused on the roof for hour s without noticing anything at all. I saw a couple of owls flying by t oward the north; the span of their wings was quite remarkable and they could not be mistaken for blackbirds. At a given moment, how ever, I distinctly not iced the black shape of a small bird landing on t he roof. It was definitely a bird! My heart began poundi ng ha rd; I felt a buzzing in my ears. I aimed in the dark and pul led bot h triggers. There was quite a loud explosion. I felt a strong r ecoil of the gun but t on m y shoulder and at the same time I heard a most piercing and horrendous hum an shriek. It was loud a nd eerie and seemed to have come from the roof. I had a moment of total confusion. I then remembered that don J uan had admonished me to yell as I shot and I had forgotten to do s o. I was thinking of reloading m y gun w hen don J uan ope ned the door and came out running. H e had his kerosene lantern with him. He appeared to be quite nervous. \"I think you got her,\" he said. \"We must find the dead bird now .\" He brought a ladder and m ade me climb up a nd look on t he ramada, but I could not find anything there. He climbed up a nd looked himself for a while, with equally negative results. \"Perhaps you ha ve blasted the bird to bits,\" don J uan said, \"in which case we must find at least a feather.\" We began looking around t he ramada first and then around t he hous e. We looked with the light of the lantern until morning. T hen we started looking again all over the area we had covered dur ing the night. Around 11: 00 A . M . don J uan called off our search. He sat down dejected, smiled sheepishly at me, and said that I had failed to stop hi s enemy and that now, more than ever before, his life was not worth a hoot because the woman was doubt lessly irked, itching to take revenge. \"You're safe, though,\" don J uan said reassuringly. \"'The woman doe sn't know you.\" As I was walking to my car to return hom e, I asked him if I had to destroy the shotgun. H e said the gun ha d done nothing and I should give it back to its owner. I noticed a profound l ook of despair in don J uan's eyes. I felt so moved by i t that I was about to weep. \"What can I do to help you? \" I asked, \"There's nothing you c an do,\" don J uan said. We remained silent for a moment. I wanted to leave right away, I felt an oppr essive anguish. I was ill at ease, \"Would you r eally try to help me?\" don J uan asked in a childlike tone. I told him again that my total person was at his disposal, that my affection for him was so profound I would undertake any ki nd of action to help him. Don Juan smiled and asked again if I really meant that, and I 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"vehemently reaffirmed my desire to help him. \"If you r eally mean it,\" he said, \"I may have one more chance.\" He seemed to be delighted. He smiled broadly and clapped his hands several times, the way he always does when he wants to express a feeling of pleasure. This change of mood w as so remarkable that it also involved me. I suddenly felt that the oppr essive mood, t he anguish, had been vanquished and life was inexplicably exciting again. Don Juan sat down and I did likewise. He looked at me for a long m oment and then proceeded to tell me in a very calm and de liberate manner that I was in fact the only person who could help him at that moment, and thus he was going to ask me to do s omething ve ry dangerous and ve ry special. He paused for a moment as if he wanted a reaffirmation on m y part, and I again reiterated my firm desire to do anything for him. \"I'm going to give you a weapon t o pierce her,\" he said. He took a long obj ect from his pouc h and ha nded it to me. I took i t and then examined it. I almost dropped it. \"It is a wild boa r,\" he went on, \" You m ust pierce her with it.\" The object I was holding was a dry foreleg of a wild boa r. The skin was ugly and the bristles were revolting to the touch. The hoof was intact and its two halves were spread out , as if the leg were stretched. It was an awful- looking thing. It made me feel almost sick to my stomach. He quickly took i t back. \"You m ust ram the wild boa r right into her navel,\" don J uan said. \"What?\" I said in a feeble voice. \"You m ust hold the wild boa r in your left hand and stab her with it. She is a sorceress and the wild boa r will enter her belly and no one in this world, except another sorcerer, will see it stuck in there. This is not an ordinary battle but an affair of sorcerers. The danger you w ill run is that if you f ail to pierce her she might strike you de ad on the spot, or her companions and relatives will shoot you or knife you. Y ou m ay, on t he other hand, ge t out without a scratch. \"If you s ucceed she will have a hellish time with the wild boa r in her body a nd she will leave me alone.\" An oppr essive anguish enveloped me again. I had a profound a ffection for don J uan. I admired him. At the time of this startling request, I had already learned to regard his way of life and hi s know ledge as a paramount accomplishment. How could anyone let a man like that die? And ye t how could anyone deliberately risk his life? I became so immersed in my deliberations I did not notice that don J uan had stood up a nd was standing by m e until he patted me on the shoulder. I looked up; he was smiling be nevolently. \"Whenever you f eel that you r eally want to help me, you s hould return,\" he said, \"but not until then. If you come back I know what we will have to do. G o now ! If you don' t want to return I'll unde rstand that too.\" I automatically stood up, got into my car, and dr ove away. Don Juan had actually let me off the hook. I could have left and ne ver returned, but somehow the thought of being free to leave did not soothe me. I drove a while longer and then impulsively turned around a nd dr ove back to don J uan's hous e. He was still sitting unde rneath his ramada and di d not seem surprised to see me. \"Sit down,\" he said. \"The clouds in the west are beautiful. It will be dark shortly. Sit quietly and let the twilight fill you. D o whatever you w ant now, but when I tell you, l ook s traight at those shiny clouds and ask the twilight to give you pow er and calmness.\" I sat facing the western clouds for a couple of hour s. Don Juan went into the hous e and stayed inside. When it was getting da rk he returned. \"The twilight has come,\" he said. \"Stand up! Don't close your eyes, but look s traight at the clouds; put your arms up w ith your hands open and your fingers extended and trot in place.\" I followed his instructions; I lifted my arms over my head and be gan trotting. D on Juan came to my side and corrected my movements. He placed the leg of the wild boa r against the palm of my left hand and m ade me hold it with my thumb. He then pul led my arms down unt il they poi nted to the orange and da rk gray clouds over the horizon, toward the west. He extended my fingers like fans and told me not to curl them over the palms of my hands. It was of crucial importance that I keep my fingers spread because if I closed them I would not be asking the twilight for power and calm, but would be menacing it. He also corrected my trotting. H e said it should be 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"peaceful and uni form, as if I were actually running toward the twilight with my extended arms. I could not fall asleep dur ing that night. It was as if, instead of calming m e, the twilight had agitated me into a frenzy. \"I still have so many things pending in my life,\" I said. \"So many things unresolved.\" Don Juan chuckled softly. \"Nothing is pending in the world,\" he said. \"Nothing is finished, yet nothing is unresolved. Go to sleep.\" Don Juan's words were strangely soothing. Around t en o'clock the next morning, don J uan gave me something to eat and then we were on our way. He whispered that we were going to approach the woman around noon, or before noon i f possible. He said that the ideal time would have been the early hour s of the day, because a witch is always less powerful or less aware in the morning, but she would never leave the protection of her hous e at those hour s. I did not ask any que stions. He directed me to the highway and at a certain poi nt he told me to stop and pa rk on t he side of the road. He said we had to wait there. I looked at my watch; it was five minutes to eleven. I yawned repeatedly. I was actually sleepy; my mind wandered around a imlessly. Suddenly don J uan straightened up a nd nudge d me. I jumped up i n my seat. \"There she is!\" he said. I saw a woman walking toward the highway on t he edge of a cultivated field. She was carrying a basket looped in her right arm. It was not until then that I noticed we were parked near a crossroads. There were two narrow trails which ran parallel to bot h sides of the highway and another wider and m ore trafficked trail that ran perpendicular to the highway; obvi ously people who us ed that trail had to walk across the paved road. When the woman was still on the dirt road don J uan told me to get out of the car. \"Do it now,\" he said firmly. I obeyed him. The woman was almost on the highway. I ran and ove rtook he r. I was so close to her that I felt her clothes on m y face. I took t he wild boa r hoof from unde r my shirt and thrust it at her. I did not feel any resistance to the blunt object I had in my hand. I saw a fleeting shadow in front of me, like a drape; my head turned to my right and I saw the woman standing fifty feet away on t he oppos ite side of the road. She was a fairly young, da rk woman with a strong, s tocky body. S he was smiling at me. Her teeth were white and bi g and he r smile was placid. She had closed her eyes halfway, as if to protect them from the wind. S he was still holding he r basket, looped ove r her right arm. I then had a moment of unique confusion. I turned around t o look a t don J uan. He was making frantic ges- tures to call me back. I ran back. There were three or four men coming in a hurry toward me. I got into the car and sped away in the oppos ite direction. I tried to ask don J uan what had happened but I could not talk; my ears were bursting with an ove rwhelming pressure; I felt that I was choking. H e seemed to be pleased and be gan to laugh. I t was as if my failure did not concern him. I had my hands so tight around t he steering wheel that I could not move them; they were frozen; my arms were rigid and so were my legs. In fact I could not take my foot off the gas pedal. Don Juan patted me on the back and told me to relax. Little by little the pressure in my ears diminished. \"What happened back there?\" I finally asked. He giggled like a child without answering. T hen he asked me if I had not iced the way the woman got out of the way. He praised her excellent speed. Don Juan's talk seemed so incongruous that I could not really follow him. He praised the woman! He said her power was impeccable and she was a relentless enemy. I asked don J uan if he did not mind m y failure. I was truly surprised and annoye d at his change of mood. H e seemed to be actually glad. He told me to stop. I parked alongside the road. He put his hand on m y shoulder and looked piercingly into my eyes. \"Whatever I have done to you t oday was a trick,\" he said bluntly. \"The rule is that a man of know ledge has to trap his apprentice. Today I have trapped you a nd I have tricked you i nto learning.\" 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"I was dum founde d. I could not arrange my thought s. Don Juan explained that the whole involvement with the woman was a trap; that she had never been a threat to him; and that his job was to put me in touch with her, under specific conditions of abandon a nd pow er I had experienced when I tried to pierce her. He commended my resolution and called it an act of power which demonstrated to the woman that I was capable of great exertion. Don Juan said that even though I was not aware of it, all I did was to show off in front of her. \"You could never touch her,\" he said, \"but you s howed your claws to her. She know s now that you're not afraid. You ha ve challenged her. I used her to trick you be cause she's powerful and relentless and ne ver forgets. Men are usually too bus y to be relentless enemies.\" I felt a terrible anger. I told him that one should not play with a person's innermost feelings and loyalties. Don Juan laughed unt il tears rolled dow n his cheeks, and I hated him. I had an ove rwhelming de sire to punc h him and leave; there was, how ever, such a strange rhythm in his laughter that it kept me almost paralyzed. \"Don't be so angry,\" don J uan said soothingly. Then he said that his acts had never been a farce, that he also had thrown his life away a long t ime before when his own benefactor tricked him, just as he had tricked me. Don Juan said that his benefactor was a cruel man who di d not think about him the way he, don J uan, thought about me. He added very sternly that the woman had tested her strength against him and ha d really tried to kill him. \"Now she know s that I was playing with her,\" he said, laughing, \"and she'll hate you for it. She can't do anything to me, but she will take it out on you. S he doesn't know yet how much pow er you ha ve, so she will come to test you, l ittle by little. Now you ha ve no choice but to learn in order to defend your self, or you w ill fall prey to that lady. S he is no trick.\" Don Juan reminded me of the way she had flown away. \"Don't be angry,\" he said. \"It was not an ordinary trick. It was the rule.\" There was something about the way the woman moved away from me that was truly maddening. I had witnessed it myself: she had jumped the width of the highway in a flick of an eyelash. I had no w ay to get out of that certainty. From that moment on I focused all my attention on t hat incident and little by little I accumulated \"proof\" that she was actually following m e. The final outcome was that I had to withdraw from the apprenticeship unde r the pressure of my irrational fear. I came back to don J uan's hous e hour s later, in the early afternoon. H e was apparently waiting for me. He came up to me as I got out of my car and examined me with curious eyes, walking around m e a couple of times. \"Why the nervousness?\" he asked before I had time to say anything. I explained that something ha d scared me off that morning and that I had begun t o feel something pr owling around m e, as in the past. Don Juan sat down and seemed to be engulfed in thought s. His face had an unus ually serious expression. H e seemed to be tired. I sat by hi m and arranged my not es. After a very long pa use his face brightened up a nd he smiled. \"What you f elt this morning was the spirit of the water hole,\" he said. \"I've told you t hat you m ust be prepared for unexpected encounters with those forces. I thought you unde rstood.\" \"I did.\" \"Then why the fear?\" I could not answer. \"That spirit is on your trail,\" he said. \"It already tapped you i n the water. I assure you i t will tap you a gain and pr obably you w on't be prepared and that encounter will be your end.\" Don Juan's words made me feel genuinely concerned. My feelings were strange, how ever; I was concerned but not afraid. Whatever was happening to me had not been able to elicit my old feelings of blind fear. \"What should I do?\" I asked. \"You forget too easily,\" he said. \"The path of know ledge is a forced one . In order to learn we must be spurred. In the path of know ledge we are always fighting something, avoiding something, pr epared for something; and that something is always inexplicable, greater, more powerful than us. The inexplicable forces will come to you. N ow it is the spirit of the water hole, later on it'll be your own ally , so there is nothing you c an 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"do now but to prepare your self for the struggle. Years ago la Catalina spurred you, s he was only a sorceress, though, a nd that was a beginner's trick. \"The world is indeed full of frightening things and we are helpless creatures surrounde d by f orces that are inexplicable and unbe nding. T he average man, in ignorance, believes that those forces can be explained or changed; he doesn't really know how to do t hat, but he expects that the actions of mankind will explain them or change them sooner or later. The sorcerer, on t he other hand, doe s not think of explaining or changing them; instead, he learns to use such forces by redirecting hi mself and adapting to their direction. T hat's his trick. There is very little to sorcery onc e you f ind out its trick. A sorcerer is only slightly better off than the average man. Sorcery doe s not help him to live a better life; in fact I should say that sorcery hinders him; it makes his life cumbersome, precarious. By ope ning hi mself to know ledge a sorcerer becomes more vulnerable than the average man. On the one hand hi s fellow men hate him and fear him and will strive to end hi s life; on the other hand the inexplicable and un bending forces that surround e very one of us, by r ight of our being alive, are for a sorcerer a source of even greater danger. To be pierced by a fellow man is indeed painful, but nothing in comparison to being touched by a n ally . A sorcerer, by ope ning hi mself to know ledge, falls prey to such forces and ha s only one means of balancing hi mself, his will; thus he must feel and act like a warrior. I will repeat this once more: Only as a warrior can one survive the path of know ledge. What helps a sorcerer live a better life is the strength of being a warrior. \"It is my commitment to teach you t o see. Not because I personally want to do s o but because you w ere chosen; you w ere pointed out to me by M escalito. I am compelled by m y personal desire, how ever, to teach you to feel and act like a warrior. I personally believe that to be a warrior is more suitable than anything else. Therefore I have endeavored to show you t hose forces as a sorcerer perceives them, because only unde r their terrifying impact can one become a warrior. To see without first being a warrior would make you w eak; it would give you a false meekness, a desire to retreat; your body w ould decay because you w ould become indifferent. It is my personal commitment to make you a warrior so you w on't crumble. \"I have heard you s ay time and time again that you a re always prepared to die. I don't regard that feeling as necessary. I think it is a useless indulgence. A warrior should be prepared onl y to battle. I have also heard you say that your parents injured your spirit. I think the spirit of man is something that can be injured very easily, although not by the same acts you your self call injurious. I believe that your parents did injure you by m aking you i ndulgent and soft and gi ven to dwelling. \"The spirit of a warrior is not geared to indulging and complaining, nor is it geared to winning or losing. T he spirit of a warrior is geared onl y to struggle, and every struggle is a warrior's last battle on earth. Thus the out- come matters very little to him. In his last battle on earth a warrior lets his spirit flow free and clear. And as he wages his battle, know ing that his will is impeccable, a warrior laughs and laughs.\" I finished writing and looked up. D on Juan was staring at me. He shook hi s head from side to side and smiled. \"You really write everything?\" he asked in an incredulous tone. \"Genaro says that he can never be serious with you be cause you're always writing. H e's right; how can anyone be serious if you're always writing?\" He chuckled and I tried to defend m y pos ition. \"It doesn't matter,\" he said, \"If you e ver learn to see, I suppos e you m ust do it your own weird way.\" He stood up a nd looked at the sky. It was around noon. H e said there was still time to start on a hunt ing trip to a place in the mountains. \"What are we going to hunt ?\" I asked. \"A special animal, either a deer or a wild boa r or even a mountain lion.\" He paused for a moment and then added, \"Even an eagle.\" I stood up a nd followed him to my car. He said that this time we were going onl y to obs erve and to find out what animal we had to hunt . He was about to get in my car when he seemed to remember something. H e smiled and said that the journey had to be postponed unt il I had learned something without which our hunt ing would be impossible. 110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"We went back and sat down again unde rneath his ramada. There were so many things I wanted to ask, but he did not give me time to say anything be fore he spoke again. \"This brings us to the last point you m ust know about a warrior,\" he said. \"A warrior selects the items that make his world. \"The other day when you s aw the ally and I had to wash you t wice, do you know what was wrong w ith you? \" \"No.\" \"You ha d lost your shields.\" \"What shields? What are you t alking about?\" \"I said that a warrior selects the items that make his world. He selects deliberately, for every item he chooses is a shield that protects him from the onslaughts of the forces he is striving to use. A warrior would use his shields to protect himself from his ally , for instance. \"An average man who is equally surrounde d by t hose inexplicable forces is oblivious to them because he has other kinds of special shields to protect himself.\" He paused and looked at me with a question in his eyes. I had not unde rstood w hat he meant. \"What are those shields?\" I insisted. \"What people do,\" he repeated. \"What do they do? \" \"Well, look a round. P eople are busy doi ng that which people do. T hose are their shields. Whenever a sorcerer has an encounter with any of those inexplicable and un bending forces we have talked about, his gap opens, making hi m more susceptible to his death than he ordinarily is; I've told you t hat we die through t hat gap, therefore if it is open one should have his will ready to fill it; that is, if one is a warrior. If one is not a warrior, like your self, then one has no ot her recourse but to use the activities of daily life to take one's mind away from the fright of the encounter and thus to allow one's gap to close.

Your old shields are no longer safe.\" \"What am I suppos ed to do? \" \"Act like a warrior and select the items of your world. You cannot surround your self with things helter- skelter any longer. I tell you t his in a most serious vein. Now for the first time you a re not safe in your old way of life.\" \"What do you m ean by s electing the items of my world?\" \"A warrior encounters those inexplicable and unbe nding forces because he is deliberately seeking them, thus he is always prepared for the encounter.

The first thing you m ust do, t hen, is be prepared. Think that the ally is going to pop i n front of your eyes any m inute and you m ust be ready for him.

Don Juan laughed and said that he did not mean I should force the issue, that listening to the sounds of the world had to be done harmoniously and with great patience. \"A warrior is aware that the world will change as soon a s he stops talking to himself,\" he said, \"and he must be prepared for that monum ental jolt.\" \"What do you m ean, don J uan?\" \"The world is such-and-such or so-and-so onl y because we tell ourselves that that is the way it is.

It was excruciating at first to listen and not look, but even more excruciating was not to talk to myself. By the end of the two months I was capable of shutting of f my internal dialogue for short periods of time and I was also capable of paying attention to sounds . I arrived at don J uan's hous e at 9:00 A.M. on N ovember 10, 1969. \"We should start that trip right now,\" he said upon m y arrival at his hous e. I rested for an hour and then we drove toward the low slopes of the mountains to the east. We left my car in the care of one of his friends who lived in that area while we hiked into the mountains. Don Juan had put some crackers and sweet rolls in a knapsack for me. There were enough pr ovisions for a day or two. I had asked don Juan if we needed more. He shook hi s head negatively. We walked the entire morning. It was a rather warm day. I carried one canteen of water, most of which I drank m yself. Don Juan drank onl y twice. When there was no m ore water he assured me it was all right to drink from the streams we found on our way. He laughed at my reluctance. After a short while my thirst made me overcome my fears. In the early afternoon w e stopped in a small valley at the bottom of some lush green hills. Behind the hills, toward the east, the high m ountains were silhouetted against a cloudy s ky. \"You can think, you c an write about what we say or about what you pe rceive, but nothing about where we are,\" he said. We rested for a while and then he took a bundl e from inside his shirt. He untied it and showed me his pipe. He filled its bowl with smoking m ixture, lighted a match and ki ndled a small dry twig, placed the burning twig inside the bowl, and told me to smoke. Without a piece of charcoal inside the bowl it was difficult to light the pipe; we had to keep kindling twigs until the mixture caught on fire. When I had finished smoking he said that we were there so I could find out the kind of game I was suppos ed to hunt . He carefully repeated three or four times that the most important aspect of my endeavor was to find some holes. He emphasized the word \"holes\" and said that inside them a sorcerer could find all sorts of messages and di rections. I wanted to ask what kind of holes they were; don J uan seemed to have guessed my que stion and said that they were impossible to describe and were in the realm of \"seeing.\" He repeated at various times that I should focus all my attention on l istening to sounds and do m y best to find the holes between the sounds . He said that he was going to play his spirit catcher four times. I was suppos ed to use those eerie calls as a guide to the ally that had welcomed me; that ally would then give me the message I was seeking. D on Juan told me I should stay in complete alertness, since he had no i dea how the ally would manifest himself to me. I listened attentively. I was sitting with my back against the rock side of the hill. I experienced a mild numbness. Don Juan warned me against closing m y eyes. I began to listen and I could distinguish the whistling of birds, the wind rustling the leaves, the buzzing of insects. As I placed my individual attention on t hose sounds , I could actually make out four different types of bird whistlings. I could distinguish the speeds of the wind, in terms of slow or fast; I could also hear the different rustlings of three types of leaves. The buzzings of insects were dazzling. T here were so many that I could not count them or correctly differentiate them. I was immersed in a strange world of sound, a s I had never been in my life. I began to slide to my right. Don Juan made a motion to stop m e but I caught myself before he did. I straightened up a nd sat erect again. Don Juan moved my body unt il he had propped me on a crevice in the rock wall. He swept the small rocks from unde r my legs and pl aced the back of my head against the rock. He told me imperatively to look a t the mountains to the southeast. I fixed my gaze in the distance but he corrected me and said I should not gaze but look, s ort of scanning, at the hills in front of me and at the vegetation on them. He repeated ove r and ove r that I should concentrate all my attention on m y hearing. Sounds began to be prominent again. It was not so much that I wanted to hear them; rather, they had a way of forcing m e to concentrate on them. The wind rustled the leaves. The wind came high above the trees and then it 114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"dropped into the valley where we were. Upon dr opping, it touched the leaves of the tall trees first; they made a peculiar sound w hich I fancied to be a sort of rich, raspy, lush sound. T hen the wind hi t the bushes and their leaves sounde d like a crowd of small things; it was an almost melodious sound, ve ry engulfing and qui te demanding; it seemed capable of drowning everything else. I found i t displeasing. I felt embarrassed because it occurred to me that I was like the rustle of the bushes, nagging and de manding. T he sound w as so akin to me that I hated it. Then I heard the wind rolling on t he ground. I t was not a rustling sound but more of a whistle, almost a beep or a flat buzz. Listening to the sounds the wind was making, I realized that all three of them happened at once. I was wondering how I had been capable of isolating each of them, when I again became aware of the whistling of birds and the buzzing of insects. At one moment there were only the sounds of the wind and the next moment a gigantic flow of other sounds emerged at once into my field of awareness. Logically, all the existing sounds must have been continually emitted dur ing the time I was hearing onl y the wind. I could not count all the whistles of birds or buzzings of insects, yet I was convinced I was listening to each separate sound a s it was produced. Together they created a most extraordinary order. I cannot call it any ot her thing but \"order.\" It was an order of sounds that had a pattern; that is, every sound ha ppened in sequence. Then I heard a unique prolonged wail. It made me shiver. Every other noise ceased for an instant, and the valley was dead still as the reverberation of the wail reached the valley's outer limits; then the noises began again. I picked up t heir pattern immediately. After a moment of attentive listening I thought I unde rstood don J uan's recommendation to watch for the holes between the sounds . The pattern of noises had spaces in between sounds ! For example, specific whistles of birds were timed and ha d pauses in between them, and so had all the other sounds I was perceiving. T he rustling of leaves was like a binding gl ue that made them into a hom ogeneous buzz. The fact of the matter was that the timing of each sound w as a unit in the overall pattern of sounds . Thus the spaces or pauses in between sounds were, if I paid attention to them, holes in a structure. I heard again the piercing wail of don J uan's spirit catcher. It did not jolt me, but the sounds again ceased for an instant and I perceived such a cessation as a hole, a very large hole. At that precise moment I shifted my attention from hearing to looking. I was looking at a cluster of low hills with lush green vegetation. T he silhouette of the hills was arranged in such a way that from the place where I was looking there seemed to be a hole on the side of one of the hills. It was a space in between two hills and through i t I could see the deep, dark, gray hue of the mountains in the distance. For a moment I did not know what it was. It was as if the hole I was looking at was the \"hole\" in the sound. T hen the noises began again but the visual image of the huge hole remained. A short while later I became even more keenly aware of the pattern of sounds and their order and the arrangement of their pauses. My mind was capable of distinguishing and di scriminating among a n enormous number of individual sounds . I could actually keep track of all the sounds , thus each pause between sounds was a definite hole. At a given moment the pauses became crystallized in my mind and formed a sort of solid grid, a structure. I was not seeing or hearing it. I was feeling it with some unknow n part of myself. Don Juan played his string onc e again; the sounds ceased as they had done before, creating a huge hole in the sound s tructure. This time, how ever, that big pause blended with the hole in the hills I was looking at; they became superimposed on e ach other. The effect of perceiving two hol es lasted for such a long t ime that I was capable of seeing-hearing their contours as they fit one another. Then the other sounds began again and their structure of pauses became an extraordinary, almost visual perception. I began seeing the sounds as they created patterns and then all those patterns became superimposed on t he environment in the same way I had perceived the two big hol es becoming superimposed. I was not looking or hearing as I was accustomed to doi ng. I was doing something which was entirely different but combined features of both. For some reason m y attention was focused on t he large hole in the hills. I felt I was hearing it and at the same time looking at it. There was something of a lure about it. It dom inated my field of perception and every single sound pa ttern which coincided with a feature of the environment was hinged on t hat hole. I heard onc e more the eerie wail of don J uan's spirit catcher; all other sounds stopped; the two large holes seemed to light up and ne xt I was looking again at the plowed field; the ally was standing there as I had seen him before. The light of the total scene became very clear. I could see him plainly, as if he were fifty yards away. I 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"could not see his face; his hat covered it. Then he began to come toward me, lifting up hi s head slowly as he walked; I could almost see his face and that terrified me. I knew I had to stop hi m without delay, I had a strange surge in my body; I felt an out flow of \"power.\" I wanted to move my head to the side to stop the vision but I could not do it. At that crucial instant a thought came to my mind. I knew what don J uan meant when he spoke of the items of a \"path with heart\" being the shields. There was something I wanted to do i n my life, something ve ry consuming and intriguing, something that tilled me with great peace and joy. I knew the ally could not overcome me. I moved my head away without any trouble before I could see his entire face. I began hearing all the other sounds ; they suddenly became very loud a nd shrill, as if they were actually angry with me. They lost their patterns and turned into an amorphous conglomerate of sharp, painful shrieks. My ears began to buz z unde r their pressure. I felt that my head was about to explode. I stood up a nd put the palms of my hands to my ears. Don Juan helped me walk to a very small stream, made me take off my clothes, and rolled me in the water. He made me lie on the almost dry bed of the stream and then gathered water in his hat and splashed me with it. The pressure in my ears subsided very rapidly and it took onl y a few minutes to \"wash\" me. Don Juan looked at me, shook hi s head in approval, and said I had made myself \"solid\" in no t ime at all. I put on m y clothes and he took m e back to the place where I had been sitting. I felt extremely vigorous, buoyant, and clearheaded. He wanted to know all the details of my vision. H e said that the \"holes\" in the sounds were used by s orcerers to find out specific things. A sorcerer's ally would reveal complicated affairs through t he holes in the sounds . He refused to be more specific about the \"holes\" and sloughe d off my que stions, saying that since I did not have an ally such information would onl y be harmful to me. \"Everything is meaningful for a sorcerer,\" he said. \"The sounds have holes in them and so doe s everything around you. O rdinarily a man doe s not have the speed to catch the holes, and thus he goes through l ife without protection. T he worms, the birds, the trees, all of them can tell us unimaginable things if only one could have the speed to grasp their message. The smoke can give us that grasping speed. But we must be on good t erms with all the living things of this world. This is the reason why we must talk to plants we are about to kill and apologize for hurting them; the same thing m ust be done with the animals we are going to hunt . We should take only enough f or our needs, otherwise the plants and the animals and the worms we have killed would turn against us and cause us disease and m isfortune. A warrior is aware of this and strives to appease them, so when he peers through t he holes, the trees and bi rds and the worms give him truthful messages. \"But all this is not important now. What is important is that you s aw the ally . That is your game! I've told you that we were going to hunt for something. I thought it was going to be an animal. I figured that you w ere going to see the animal we had to hunt . I myself saw a wild boa r; my spirit catcher is a wild boa r.\" \"Do you m ean your spirit catcher is made out of a wild boa r?\" \"No! Nothing in the life of a sorcerer is made out of anything else. If something is anything at all, it is the thing itself. If you kne w wild boa rs you w ould realize my spirit catcher is one.\" \"Why di d we come here to hunt ?\" \"The ally showed you a spirit catcher that he got from his pouc h. You ne ed to have one if you a re going to call him.\" \"What is a spirit catcher?\" \"It is a fiber. With it I can call the allies, or my own ally , or I can call the spirits of water holes, the spirits of rivers, the spirits of mountains. Mine is a wild boa r and cries like a wild boa r. I used it twice around you t o call the spirit of the water hole to help you. T he spirit came to you a s the ally came to you t oday. You could not see it, though, be cause you di d not have the speed; however, that day I took you t o the water canyon a nd put you on a rock, you kne w the spirit was almost on top of you w ithout actually seeing it. Those spirits are helpers. They are hard to handle and sort of dangerous. One needs an impeccable will to hol d them at bay.\" \"What do they look l ike?\" \"They are different for every man and so are the allies. For you a n ally would apparently look l ike a man you 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"once knew, or like a man you w ill always be about to know ; that's the bent of your nature.

It was wise of you t o stop; the ally was going too fast for your strength and a direct jolt with him would be very injurious to you.\" \"How can I get a spirit catcher now?\" \"Apparently the ally is going to give you one himself.\" \"How?\" \"I don't know . You will have to go t o him. He has already told you w here to look f or it.\" \"Where?\" \"Up there, on t hose hills where you s aw the hole.\" \"Would I be looking for the ally himself?\" \"No. But he is already welcoming you. T he little smoke has opened your way to him. Then, later on, you w ill meet him face to face, but that will happen onl y after you know him very well.\" 117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"16 We arrived in the same valley in the late afternoon of December 15, 1969. D on Juan mentioned repeatedly as we moved through t he shrubs that directions or points of orientation were of crucial importance in the endeavor I was going to unde rtake. \"You m ust determine the right direction immediately upon a rriving at the top of a hill,\" don J uan said. \"As soon a s you a re on the top, face that direction.\" He pointed to the southeast. \"That is your good di rection and you s hould always face it, especially when you' re in trouble. Remember that.\" We stopped at the bottom of the hills where I had perceived the hole. He pointed at a specific place where I had to sit down; he sat next to me and in a very qui et voice gave me detailed instructions. He said that as soon a s I reached the hilltop I had to extend m y right arm in front of me with the palm of my hand dow n and m y fingers stretched like a fan, except the thumb, which had to be tucked against the palm. Next I had to turn my head to the north and fold my arm over my chest, pointing m y hand also toward the north; then I had to dance, putting m y left foot behind the right one, beating the ground w ith the tip of my left toes. He said that when I felt a warmth coming up m y left leg I had to begin sweeping m y arm slowly from north to south and then to the north again. \"The spot over which the palm of your hand feels warm as you s weep your arm is the place where you m ust sit, and it is also the direction in which you m ust look,\" he said. \"If the spot is toward the east, or if it is in that direction\"—he pointed to the southeast again—\"the results will be excellent. If the spot where your hand ge ts warm is toward the north, you w ill take a bad beating but you may turn the tide in your favor. If the spot is toward the south you w ill have a hard fight. \"You will need to sweep your arm up to four times at first, but as you be come more familiar with the movement you w ill need onl y one single sweep to know whether or not your hand is going to get warm. \"Once you e stablish a spot where your hand ge ts warm, sit there; that is your first point If you a re facing the south or the north, you ha ve to make up your mind whether you f eel strong e nough t o stay. If you ha ve doubt s about your self, get up and leave. There is no ne ed to stay if you a re not confident. If you de cide to stick around, clean an area big enough t o bui ld a fire about five feet away from your first point. The fire must be in a straight line in the direction you a re looking. T he area where you bui ld the fire is your second poi nt. Then gather all the twigs you c an in between those two poi nts and m ake a fire. Sit on your first point and look a t the fire. Sooner or later the spirit will come and you w ill see it. \"If your hand doe s not get warm at all after four sweeping m ovements, sweep your arm slowly from north to south and then turn around a nd sweep it to the west. If your hand ge ts warm on any pl ace toward the west, drop everything and rum. Run dow nhill toward the flat area, and no m atter what you he ar or feel behind you, don' t turn around. A s soon a s you ge t to the flat area, no m atter how frightened you a re, don' t keep on r unning, dr op to the ground, t ake off your jacket, bunc h it around your navel, and curl up like a ball, tucking your knees against your stomach. You m ust also cover your eyes with your hands, and your arms have to remain tight against your thighs. You m ust stay in that position unt il morning. If you f ollow these simple steps no ha rm will ever come to you. \"In case you c annot get to the flat area in time, drop to the ground r ight where you a re. You will have a horrid time there. You will be harassed, but if you ke ep calm and don' t move or look you w ill come out of it without a single scratch. \"Now if your hand doe s not get warm at all while you s weep it to the west, face the east again and run in an easterly direction unt il you a re out of breath. Stop there and repeat the same maneuvers. You m ust keep on r un- ning toward the east, repeating these movements, until your hand ge ts warm.\" After giving m e these instructions he made me repeat them until I had memorized them. Then we sat in silence for a long t ime. I attempted to revive the conversation a couple of times, but he forced me into silence each time by an imperative gesture. It was getting da rk when don J uan got up and without a word began climbing the hill. I followed him. At the 118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"top of the hill I performed all the movements he had prescribed. Don Juan stood by, a short distance away, and kept a sharp look on m e. I was very careful and de liberately slow. I tried to feel any pe rceivable change of temperature, but I could not detect whether or not the palm of my hand be came warm. By that time it was fairly dark, yet I was still capable of running in an easterly direction without stumbling on t he shrubs. I stopped running when I was out of breath, which was not too far from my poi nt of departure. I was extremely tired and tense. My forearms ached and so did my calves. I repeated there all the required motions and again had the same negative results. I ran in the dark two more times, and then, while I was sweeping m y arm for the third time, my hand be came warm over a point toward the east. It was such a definite change of temperature that it startled me. I sat down and waited for don J uan. I told him I had detected a change in temperature in my hand. H e told me to proceed, and I picked all the dry brush I could find and started a fire. He sat to my left a couple of feet away. The fire drew strange, dancing silhouettes. At times the flames became iridescent; they grew bluish and then brilliantly white. I explained that unus ual play of colors by assuming that it was produced by s ome chemical property of the specific dry twigs and br anches I had collected. Another very unus ual feature of the fire was the sparks. The new twigs I kept adding created extremely big sparks. I thought they were like tennis balls that seemed to explode in midair. I stared at the fire fixedly, the way I believed don J uan had recommended, and I became dizzy. He handed me his water gour d and signaled me to drink. T he water relaxed me and ga ve me a delightful feeling of freshness. Don Juan leaned ove r and whispered in my ear that I did not have to stare at the flames, that I should onl y watch in the direction of the fire. I became very cold and clammy after watching for almost an hour . At a moment when I was about to lean ove r and pi ck up a twig, something like a moth or a spot in my retina swept across from right to left between myself and the fire. I immediately recoiled. I looked at don J uan and he signaled me with a movement of his chin to look ba ck at the flames. A moment later the same shadow swept across in the oppos ite direction. D on Juan got up hur riedly and be gan piling loose dirt on top of the burning twigs until he had completely extinguished the flames. He executed the maneuver of putting out the fire with tremendous speed. By the time I moved to help him he had finished. He stomped on t he dirt on top of the smoldering twigs and then he nearly dragged me downhill and out of the valley. He walked very fast without turning hi s head back and di d not allow me to talk at all. When we got to my car hour s later I asked him what was the thing I had seen. He shook hi s head imperatively and we drove in complete silence. He went directly inside when we arrived at his hous e in the early morning, and he again hus hed me up w hen I tried to talk. Don Juan was sitting out side, behind hi s hous e. He seemed to have been waiting for me to wake up, be cause he started talking as I came out of the hous e. He said that the shadow I had seen the night before was a spirit, a force that belonged to the particular place where I had seen it. He spoke of that specific being as a useless one. \"It only exists there,\" he said. \"It has no secrets of power, so there was no poi nt in remaining there. You would have seen onl y a fast, passing shadow going ba ck and forth all night. There are other types of beings, how - ever, that can give you s ecrets of power, if you a re fortunate enough t o find them.\" We ate some breakfast then and di d not talk for quite a while. After eating we sat in front of his hous e. \"There are three kinds of beings,\" he said suddenly, \"those that cannot give anything be cause they have nothing to give, those that can onl y cause fright, and those that have gifts. The one you s aw last night was a silent one; it has nothing to give; it is only a shadow. Most of the time, how ever, another type of being is associated with the silent one, a nasty spirit whose only qua lity is to cause fear and which always hove rs around t he abode of a silent one. That is why I decided to get out of there fast. That nasty type follows people right into their homes and m akes life impossible for them. I know people who ha ve had to move out of their hous es because of them. There are always some people who be lieve they can get a lot out of that kind of being, but the mere fact that a spirit is around t he hous e does not mean anything. P eople may try to entice it, or they may follow it around 119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"the hous e unde r the impression that it can reveal secrets to them. But the only thing pe ople would get is a frightful experience. I know people who took t urns watching one of those nasty beings that had followed them into their hous e. They watched the spirit for months; finally someone else had to step in and dr ag the people out of the hous e; they had become weak and were wasting away. So the only wise thing one can do w ith that nasty type is to forget about it and leave it alone.\" I asked him how people enticed a spirit. He said that people took pa ins to figure out first where the spirit would most likely appear and then they put weapons in its way, in hope s that it might touch the weapons, because spirits were know n to like paraphernalia of war. Don Juan said that any ki nd of gear, or any obj ect, that was touched by a spirit rightfully became a power object. However, the nasty type of being was know n never to touch anything, but only to produce the auditory illusion of noise. I then asked don J uan about the manner in which those spirits caused fear. He said that their most common way of frightening pe ople was to appear as a dark shadow shaped as a man that would roam around t he hous e, creating a frightening clatter or creating the sound of voices, or as a dark shadow that would suddenly lurch out from a dark corner. Don Juan said that the third type of spirit was a true ally , a giver of secrets; that special type existed in lonely, abandone d places, places which were almost inaccessible. He said that a man who wished to find one of these beings had to travel far and go by hi mself. At a distant and lonely place the man had to take all the necessary steps alone. He had to sit by hi s fire and if he saw the shadow he had to leave immediately. He had to remain, however, if he encountered other conditions, such as a strong w ind that would kill his fire and would keep him from kindling it again dur ing four attempts; or if a branch broke from a nearby tree. The branch really had to break and the man had to make sure that it was not merely the sound of a branch breaking of f. Other conditions he had to be aware of were rocks that rolled, or pebbles which were thrown at his fire, or any constant noise, and he then had to walk in the direction in which any of these phenomena occurred unt il the spirit revealed itself. There were many ways in which such a being put a warrior to the test. It might suddenly leap in front of him, in the most horrendous appearance, or it might grab the man from the back and not turn him loose and ke ep him pinned dow n for hour s. It might also topple a tree on hi m. Don Juan said that those were truly dangerous forces, and although t hey could not kill a man hand to hand, they could cause his death by f right, or by actually letting objects fall on hi m, or by appearing suddenly and causing hi m to stumble, lose his footing, and go ove r a precipice. He told me that if I ever found one of those beings unde r inappropriate circumstances I should never attempt to struggle with it because it would kill me. It would rob m y soul. So I should throw myself to the ground a nd bear it until the morning. \"When a man is facing the ally , the giver of secrets, he has to muster up all his courage and gr ab it before it grabs him, or chase it before it chases him. The chase must be relentless and then comes the struggle. The man must wrestle the spirit to the ground a nd ke ep it there until it gives him power.\" I asked him if these forces had substance, if one could really touch them. I said that the very idea of a \"spirit\" connot ed something ethereal to me. \"Don't call them spirits,\" he said. \"Call them allies; call them inexplicable forces.\" He was silent for a while, then he lay on hi s back and pr opped his head on hi s folded arms. I insisted on know ing if those beings had substance. \"You're damn right they have substance,\" he said after another moment of silence. \"When one struggles with them they are solid, but that feeling lasts only a moment. Those beings rely on a man's fear; therefore if the man struggling with one of them is a warrior, the being loses its tension ve ry qui ckly while the man becomes more vigorous. One can actually absorb the spirit's tension.\" \"What kind of tension is that?\" I asked. \"Power. When one touches them, they vibrate as if they were ready to rip one apart. But that is only a show. The tension ends when the man maintains his grip.\" 120"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"\"What happens when they lose their tension? Do they become like air?\" \"No, they just become flaccid. They still have substance, though. B ut it is not like anything one has ever touched.\" Later on, dur ing the evening, I said to him that perhaps what I had seen the night before could have been onl y a moth. He laughed and ve ry patiently explained that moths fly back and forth onl y around l ight bulbs, because a light bulb cannot burn their wings. A fire, on t he other hand, w ould bur n them the first time they came close to it. He also poi nted out that the shadow covered the entire fire. When he mentioned that, I remembered that it was really an extremely large shadow and that it actually blocked the view of the fire for an instant. However, it had happened so fast that I had not emphasized it in my earlier recollection. Then he pointed out that the sparks were very large and flew to my left. I had not iced that myself. I said that the wind was probably blowing in that direction. D on Juan replied that there was no w ind whatsoever. That was true. Upon r ecalling m y experience I could remember that the night was still. Another thing I had completely ove rlooked was a greenish glow in the flames, which I detected when don Juan signaled me to keep on l ooking at the fire, after the shadow had first crossed my field of vision. D on Juan reminded me of it. He also obj ected to my calling it a shadow. He said it was round a nd m ore like a bubbl e. Two days later, on D ecember 17, 1969, don J uan said in a very casual tone that I knew all the details and necessary techniques in order to go t o the hills by m yself and obt ain a power object, the spirit catcher. He urged me to proceed alone and affirmed that his company would onl y hinder me. I was ready to leave when he seemed to change his mind. \"You're not strong e nough,\" he said. \"I'll go w ith you t o the bottom of the hills.\" When we were at the small valley where I had seen the ally , he examined from a distance the formation in the terrain that I had called a hole in the hills, and said that we had to go s till further south into the distant mountains. The abode of the ally was at the furthermost point we could see through t he hole. I looked at the formation and all I could distinguish was the bluish mass of the distant mountains. He guided me, how ever, in a southeasterly direction and after hour s of walking we reached a point he said was \"deep enough\" into the ally 's abode. It was late afternoon w hen we stopped. We sat down on s ome rocks. I was tired and hungr y; all I had eaten during the day was some tortillas and water. Don Juan stood up a ll of a sudden, looked at the sky, and told me in a commanding tone to take off in the direction that was the best for me and to be sure I could remember the spot where we were at the moment, so I could return there whenever I was through. H e said in a reassuring tone that he would be waiting for me if it took m e forever, I asked apprehensively if he believed that the affair of getting a spirit catcher was going to take a long t ime. \"Who know s?\" he said, smiling m ysteriously. I walked away toward the southeast, turning around a couple of times to look a t don J uan. He was walking very slowly in the oppos ite direction. I climbed to the top of a large hill and looked at don J uan onc e again; he was a good t wo hundr ed yards away. He did not turn to look a t me. I ran dow nhill into a small bowl-like depression be tween the hills, and I suddenly found m yself alone. I sat down for a moment and be gan to wonder what I was doing there. I felt ludicrous looking for a spirit catcher. I ran back up t o the top of the hill to have a better view of don J uan but I could not see him anywhere. I ran dow nhill in the direction I had last seen him. I wanted to call off the whole affair and go hom e. I felt quite stupid and tired. \"Don Juan!\" I yelled ove r and ove r. He was nowhere in sight. I again ran to the top of another steep hill; I could not see him from there either. I ran qui te a way looking for him but he had disappeared. I retraced my steps and went back to the original place where he had left me. I had the absurd certainty I was going to find hi m sitting there laughing at my inconsis- tencies. \"What in the hell have I gotten into?\" I said loudly. I knew then that there was no w ay to stop whatever I was doing there. I really did not know how to go ba ck to my car. Don Juan had changed directions various times and the general orientation of the four cardinal points 121"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"was not enough. I was afraid of getting lost in the mountains. I sat down and for the first time in my life I had the strange feeling that there never really was a way to revert back to an original point of departure. Don Juan had said that I always insisted on s tarting at a point I called the beginning, w hen in effect the beginning di d not exist. And there in the middle of those mountains I felt I unde rstood w hat he meant It was as if the point of departure had always been myself; it was as if don J uan had never really been there; and when I looked for him he became what he really was—a fleeting image that vanished ove r a hill. I heard the soft rustle of leaves and a strange fragrance enveloped me. I felt the wind as a pressure on m y ears, like a shy buz zing. T he sun was about to reach some compact clouds over the horizon that looked like a solidly tinted orange band, w hen it disappeared behind a heavy bl anket of lower clouds; it appeared again a moment later, like a crimson ba ll floating in the mist. It seemed to struggle for a while to get into a patch of blue sky but it was as if the clouds would not give the sun time, and then the orange band and the dark silhouette of the mountains seemed to swallow it up. I lay dow n on m y back. The world around m e was so still, so serene and at the same time so alien, I felt overwhelmed. I did not want to weep but tears rolled dow n easily. I remained in that position for hour s. I was almost unable to get up. T he rocks unde r me were hard, and right where I had lain dow n there was scarcely any ve getation, in contrast to the lush green bus hes all around. F rom where I was I could see a fringe of tall trees on the eastern hills. Finally it got fairly dark. I felt better; in fact I felt almost happy. F or me the semidarkness was much more nurturing and pr otective than the hard daylight. I stood up, c limbed to the top of a small hill, and be gan repeating the motions don J uan had taught me. I ran toward the east seven times, and then I noticed a change of temperature on m y hand. I built a fire and set a careful watch, as don J uan had recommended, obs erving every detail. Hours went by and I began to feel very tired and cold. I had gathered qui te a pile of dry twigs; I fed the fire and m oved closer to it. The vigil was so strenuous and so intense that it exhausted me; I began to nod. I fell asleep twice and woke up onl y when my head bobbe d to one side. I was so sleepy that I could not watch the fire any m ore. I drank some water and even sprinkled some on m y face to keep awake. I succeeded in fighting m y sleepiness only for brief moments. I had somehow become desponde nt and irritable; I felt utterly stupid being there and that gave me a sensation of irrational frustration and de jection. I was tired, hungr y, sleepy, and absurdly annoye d with myself. I finally gave up the struggle of keeping awake. I added a lot of dry twigs to the fire and lay dow n to sleep. The pursuit of an ally and a spirit catcher was at that moment a most ludicrous and foreign endeavor. I was so sleepy that I could not even think or talk to myself. I fell asleep. I was awakened suddenly by a loud c rack. It appeared that the noise, whatever it was, had come from just above my left ear, since I was lying on m y right side. I sat up fully awake. My left ear buzzed and was deafened by the proximity and force of the sound. I must have been asleep for only a short while, judging by t he amount of dry twigs which were still burning in the fire. I did not hear any ot her noises but I remained alert and ke pt on feeding the fire. The thought crossed my mind that perhaps what woke me up w as a guns hot; perhaps someone was around watching m e, taking shots at me. The thought became very anguishing and created an avalanche of rational fears. I was sure that someone owned that land, and if that was so they might take me for a thief and ki ll me, or they might kill me to rob m e, not know ing that I had not hing with me. I experienced a moment of terrible concern for my safety. I felt the tension in my shoulders and m y neck. I moved my head up a nd dow n; the bone s of my neck made a cracking sound. I still kept looking into the fire but I did not see anything unus ual in it, nor did I hear any noises. After a while I relaxed qui te a bit and it occurred to me that perhaps don J uan was at the bottom of all this. I rapidly became convinced that it was so. The thought made me laugh. I had another avalanche of rational conclusions, nappy c onclusions this time. I thought that don J uan must have suspected I was going to change my mind about staying in the mountains, or he must have seen me running after him and taken cover in a concealed cave or behind a bush. Then he had followed me and, not icing I had fallen asleep, waked me up by c racking a 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"branch near my ear. I added more twigs to the fire and be gan to look a round i n a casual and covert manner to see if I could spot him, even though I knew that if he was hiding around t here I would not be able to discover him. Everything was quite placid: the crickets, the wind roughi ng the trees on the slopes of the hills surroundi ng me, the soft, cracking sound of the twigs catching on f ire. Sparks flew around, but they were only ordinary sparks. Suddenly I heard the loud noi se of a branch snapping in two. The sound c ame from my left. I held my breath as I listened with utmost concentration. A n instant later I heard another branch snapping on m y right. Then I heard the faint faraway sound of snapping br anches. It was as if someone was stepping on t hem and making them crack. The sounds were rich and full, they had a lusty qua lity. They also seemed to be getting closer to where I was. I had a very slow reaction and di d not know whether to listen or stand up. I was deliberating what to do w hen all of a sudden the sound of snapping br anches happened all around m e. I was engulfed by t hem so fast that I barely had time to jump to my feet and stomp on t he fire. I began to run dow nhill in the darkness. The thought crossed my mind as I moved through t he shrubs that there was no flat land. I kept on trotting and trying to protect my eyes from the bushes. I was halfway dow n to the bottom of the hill when I felt something be hind m e, almost touching m e. It was not a branch; it was something which I intuitively felt was overtaking m e. This realization m ade me freeze. I took of f my jacket, bundl ed it on my stomach, crouched ove r my legs, and covered my eyes with my hands, as don J uan had prescribed. I kept that position for a short while and then I realized that everything around m e was dead still. There were no sounds of any ki nd. I became extraordinarily alarmed. The muscles of my stomach contracted and shivered spasmodically. Then I heard another cracking sound. I t seemed to have occurred far away, but it was extremely clear and distinct. It happened onc e more, closer to me. There was an interval of quietness and then something exploded just above my head. The suddenness of the noise made me jump involuntarily and I nearly rolled ove r on m y side. It was definitely the sound of a branch being snapped in two. The sound ha d happened so close that I heard the rustling of the branch leaves as it was being cracked. Next there was a downpour of cracking explosions; branches were being snapped with great force all around me. The incongruous thing, at that point, was my reaction to the whole phenomenon; instead of being terrified, I was laughing. I sincerely thought I had hit upon t he cause of all that was happening. I was convinced that don Juan was again tricking m e. A series of logical conclusions cemented my confidence; I felt elated. I was sure I could catch that foxy ol d don J uan in another of his tricks. He was around m e cracking br anches, and know ing I would not dare to look up, he was safe and free to do a nything he wanted to. I figured that he had to be alone in the mountains, since I had been with him constantly for days. He had not had fine time or the oppor tunity to engage any collaborators. If he was hiding, as I thought , he was hiding by hi mself and logically he could produce only a limited num ber of noises. Since he was alone, the noises had to occur in a linear temporal sequence; that is, one at a time, or at most two or three at a time. Besides, the variety of noises also had to be limited to the mechanics of a single individual. I was absolutely certain, as I remained crouched and still, that the whole experience was a game and that the only way to remain on t op of it was by emotionally dislodging m yself from it. I was positively enjoying it. I caught myself chuckling at the idea that I could anticipate my oppone nt's next move. I tried to imagine what I would do ne xt if I were don J uan. The sound of something slurping jolted me out of my mental exercise. I listened attentively; the sound happened again. I could not determine what it was. It sounde d like an animal slurping water. It happened again very close by. I t was an irritating sound t hat brought to mind the smacking noi se of a big-jawed adolescent girl chewing gum . I was wondering how don J uan could produce such a noise when the sound ha ppened again, coming from the right. There was a single sound f irst and then I heard a series of slushing, slurping sounds , as if someone were walking in mud. It was an almost sensual, exasperating sound of feet slushing in deep mud. T he noises stopped for a moment and started onc e more toward my left, very close, perhaps only ten feet away. Now they sounde d as if a heavy pe rson were trotting with rain boot s in mud. I marveled at the richness of the sound. I could not imagine any pr imitive devices that I myself could use to produce it. I heard another series of trotting, slushing sounds toward my rear and then they happened all at once, on a ll sides. Someone seemed to be walking, 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"running, trotting on m ud all around m e. A logical doubt occurred to me. If don J uan was doing all that, he had to be running in circles at an incredible speed. The rapidity of the sounds made that alternative impossible. I then thought that don J uan must have confederates after all. I wanted to involve myself in speculation as to who hi s accomplices could be but the intensity of the noises took a ll my concentration. I really could not think clearly, yet I was not afraid, I was perhaps only dum bfounde d by t he strange quality of the sounds . The slashings actually vibrated. In fact their peculiar vibrations seemed to be directed at my stomach, or perhaps I perceived their vibrations with the lower part of my abdom en. That realization br ought an instantaneous loss of my sense of objectivity and aloofness. The sounds were attacking m y stomach! The question oc curred to me, \"What if it was not don J uan?\" I panicked. I tensed my abdom inal muscles and tucked my thighs hard against the bundl e of my jacket. The noises increased in num ber and speed, as if they kne w I had lost my confidence, their vibrations were so intense I wanted to vom it. I fought the feeling of nausea. I took de ep breaths and be gan to sing m y peyote songs. I got sick and the slushing noi ses ceased at once; the sounds of crickets and wind and the distant staccato barking of coyotes became superimposed. The abrupt cessation allowed me a respite and I took s tock of myself. Only a short while before I had been in the best of spirits, confident and aloof; obvi ously I had failed miserably to judge the situation. E ven if don J uan had accomplices, it would be mechanically impossible for them to produce sounds that would affect my stomach. To produce sounds of such intensity they would have needed gadgetry beyond their means or their conception. A pparently the phenomenon I was experiencing was not a game and the \"another one of don J uan's tricks\" theory was only my rude explanation. I had cramps and an ove rwhelming de sire to roll over and straighten my legs. I decided to move to my right in order to get my face off the place where I had got ten sick. The instant I began to crawl I heard a very soft squeak right above my left ear. I froze on the spot. The squeak was repeated on t he other side of my head. It was a single sound. I thought it resembled the squeak of a door . I waited but I heard not hing else, so I decided to move again. No sooner had I started to inch my head to the right when I was nearly forced to jump up. A flood of squeaks engulfed me at once. They were like squeaks of door s at times; at other times they were like the squeaks of rats or guinea pigs. They were not loud or intense but very soft and insidious and pr oduced agonizing spasms of nausea in me. They stopped as they had begun, di minishing gr adually unt il I could hear only one or two of them at a time. Then I heard something like the wings of a big bird sweeping ove r the tops of the bushes. It seemed to be flying in circles over my head. The soft squeaks began to increase again, and so did the flapping wings. Above my head there seemed to be something like a flock of gigantic birds beating their soft wings. Both noi ses merged, creating an enveloping wave around m e. I felt that I was floating suspended in an enormous undul ating ripple. The squeaks and the flapping were so smooth I could feel them all over my body. T he flapping wings of a flock of birds seemed to be pulling m e up from above, while the squeaks of an army of rats seemed to be pushing m e from unde rneath and from around m y body. There was no doubt in my mind that through m y blundering stupidity I had unl eashed something terrible on myself. I clenched my teeth and took de ep breaths and sang pe yote songs. The noises lasted a very long t ime and I oppos ed them with all my might. When they subsided, there was again an interrupted \"silence\" as I am accustomed to perceiving silence; that is, I could detect only the natural sounds of the insects and the wind. T he time of silence was for me more deleterious than the time of noises. I began to think and to assess my pos ition, and m y deliberation threw me into a panic. I knew that I was lost; I did not have the know ledge nor the stamina to fend of f whatever was accosting m e. I was utterly helpless, crouched over my own vom it. I thought that the end of my life had come and I began to weep. I wanted to think about my life but I did not know where to start. Nothing of what I had done in my life was really worthy of that last ultimate emphasis, so I had not hing to think about. That was an exquisite realization. I had changed since the last time I experienced a similar fright. This time I was more empty. I had less personal feelings to carry along. I asked myself what a warrior would do i n that situation and I arrived at various conclusions. There was 124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"something about my um bilical region that was uniquely important; there was something une arthly about the sounds ; they were aiming at my stomach; and the idea that don J uan was tricking m e was utterly unt enable. The muscles of my stomach were very tight, although I did not have cramps any longer. I kept on singing and breathing de eply and I felt a soothing warmth inunda ting m y entire body. I t had become clear to me that if I was going to survive I had to proceed in terms of don J uan's teachings. I repeated his instructions in my mind. I remembered the exact point where the sun ha d disappeared ove r the mountains in relation to the hill where I was and to the place where I had crouched. I reoriented myself and when I was convinced that my assessment of the cardinal points was correct I began to change my pos ition, so I would have my head poi nting in a new and \"better\" direction, the southeast. I slowly started moving m y feet toward my left, inch by i nch, unt il I had them twisted unde r my calves. Then I began to align m y body w ith my feet, but no sooner had I begun t o creep laterally than I felt a peculiar tap; I had the actual phys ical sensation of something touching the uncovered area of the back of my neck. It happened so fast that I yelled involuntarily and froze again. I tightened my abdom inal muscles and be gan to breath deeply and sing m y peyote songs. A second l ater I felt once more the same light tap on m y neck. I cringed. My neck was uncovered and there was nothing I could do t o protect myself. I was tapped again. It was a very soft, almost silky obj ect that touched my neck, like the furry paw of a giant rabbit. It touched me again and then it began to cross my neck back and forth unt il I was in tears. It was as if a herd of silent, smooth, weightless kangaroos were stepping on m y neck. I could hear the soft thump of the paws as they stepped gently ove r me. It was not a painful sensation at all and ye t it was maddening. I knew that if I did not involve myself in doi ng something I would go m ad and stand up a nd run. S o I slowly began again to maneuver my body into a new position. M y attempt at moving seemed to increase the tapping on m y neck. It finally got to such a frenzy that I jerked my body a nd at once aligned it in the new direction. I had no i dea whatsoever about the outcome of my act. I was just taking action to keep from going stark, raving m ad. As soon a s I changed directions the tapping on m y neck ceased. After a long, a nguished pause I heard a distant snapping of branches. The noises were not close any m ore. It was as if they had retreated to another position far away from me. The sound of snapping br anches merged after a moment with a blasting sound of leaves being rustled, as if a strong w ind were beating the entire hill. All the bushes around m e seemed to shiver, yet there was no w ind. T he rustling sound a nd the cracking of branches gave me the feeling that the whole hill was on fire. My body w as as tight as a rock. I was perspiring copiously. I began to feel warmer and warmer. For a moment I was utterly convinced that the hill was burning. I did not jump up a nd run be cause I was so num b I was paralyzed; in fact I could not even ope n my eyes. All that mattered to me at that point was to get up and escape the fire. I had terrible cramps in my stomach which started to cut my intake of air. I became very involved in trying to breathe. After a long s truggle I was capable of taking de ep breaths again and I was also capable of noticing that the rustling ha d subsided; there was only an occasional cracking sound. T he snapping sound of branches became more and m ore distant and sporadic until it ceased altogether. I was able to ope n my eyes. I looked through m y half-closed lids to the ground unde rneath me. It was already da ylight. I waited a while longer without moving and then I started to stretch my body. I rolled on m y back. The sun was over the hills in the east. It took m e hour s to straighten out my legs and dr ag myself downhill. I began to walk toward the place where don J uan had left me, which was perhaps only a mile away; by m idafternoon I was barely at the edge of some woods, still a good qua rter of a mile away. I could not walk any m ore, not for any reason. I thought of mountain lions and tried to climb up a tree, but my arms could not suppor t my weight. I leaned against a rock and resigned myself to die there. I was convinced that I would be food f or mountain lions or other predators. I did not have the strength even to throw a rock. I was not hungr y or thirsty. Around noon I had found a small stream and ha d drunk a lot of water, but the water did not help to restore my strength. As I sat there in utter helplessness I felt more desponde nt than afraid. I was so tired I did not care about my fate and I fell asleep. I woke up w hen something shook m e. Don Juan was leaning ove r me. He helped me sit up and ga ve me water and some gruel. He laughed and said that I looked wretched. I tried to tell him what had happened but he hushed me up and said that I had missed my mark, that the place where I was suppos ed to meet him was about a 125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"hundr ed yards away. Then he half carried me downhill. He said he was taking m e to a large stream and was going to wash me there. On the way he plugged my ears with some leaves he had in his pouc h and then he blindfolded me, putting one leaf on each eye and securing them both with a piece of cloth. He made me take off my clothes and told me to place my hands over my eyes and ears to make sure I could not see or hear anything. Don Juan rubbed my entire body w ith leaves and then dum ped me in a river. I felt it was a large river. It was deep. I was standing and I could not touch the bottom. Don Juan was holding m e by the right elbow. At first I did not feel the coldness of the water, but little by little I began to feel chilled, and then the cold became intolerable. Don Juan pul led me out and dr ied me with some leaves that had a peculiar scent. I put on m y clothes and he led me away; we walked a good di stance before he took t he leaves off my ears and m y eyes. Don Juan asked me if I felt strong e nough t o walk back to my car. The weird thing was that I felt very strong. I even ran up t he side of a steep hill to prove it. On the way to my car I stayed very close to don J uan. I stumbled scores of times and he laughed. I noticed that his laughter was especially invigorating and it became the focal point of my replenishing; the more he laughed the better I felt. The next day I narrated to don J uan the sequence of events from the time he left me. He laughed all the way through m y account, especially when I told him that I had thought it was one of his tricks. \"You always think you' re being tricked,\" he said. \"You trust your self too m uch. You act like you know all the answers. You know nothing, m y little friend, not hing.\" This was the first time don J uan had called me \"my little friend.\" It took m e aback. He noticed it and smiled. There was a great warmth in his voice and that made me very sad. I told him that I had been careless and incom- petent because that was the inherent bent of my personality; and that I would never unde rstand hi s world. I felt deeply moved. He was very encouraging and asserted that I had done fine. I asked him the meaning of my experience. \"It has no m eaning,\" he replied. \"The same thing could happen to anyone , especially someone like you w ho has his gap already ope ned. It is very common. A ny warrior who's gone in search of allies would tell you a bout their doings. What they did to you w as mild. However, your gap is open and that is why you' re so nervous. One cannot turn into a warrior overnight. Now you m ust go hom e and don' t return unt il you're healed and your gap is closed.\" 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"17 I did not return to Mexico for months; I used the time to work on m y field not es and for the first time in ten years, since I started the apprenticeship, don J uan's teachings began to make real sense. I felt that the long pe riods of time I had to stay away from the apprenticeship had had a very sobering and be neficial effect on m e; they had allowed me the oppor tunity to review my findings and to arrange them in an intellectual order proper of my training and interest. The events that took pl ace on m y last visit to the field, how ever, pointed to a fallacy in my optimism about unde rstanding don J uan's know ledge. I made the last entry in my field not es on O ctober 16, 1970. T he events that took pl ace on that occasion marked a transition. T hey not only closed a cycle of instruction, but they also ope ned a new one, which was so very different from what I had done thus far that I feel this is the point where I must end m y reportage. As I approached don J uan's hous e I saw him sitting in his usual place unde r his ramada in front of the door . I parked in the shade of a tree, took m y briefcase and a bag of groceries out of the car and walked toward him, greeting hi m in a loud voi ce. I then not iced that he was not alone. There was another man sitting be hind a high pile of firewood. B oth of them were looking at me. Don Juan waved and so did the other man. Judging from his attire he was not an Indian but a Mexican from the Southwest. He was wearing Levis, a beige shirt, a Texan cowboy ha t and cowboy boot s. I talked to don J uan and then looked at the man; he was smiling at me. I stared at him for a moment. \"Here's little Carlos,\" the man said to don J uan, \"and he doesn't speak to me any m ore. Don't tell me that he's cross with me!\" Before I could say anything they bot h broke up laughing and onl y then did I realize that the strange man was don G enaro. \"You di dn't recognize me, did you? \" he asked, still laughing. I had to admit that his attire had baffled me. \"What are you doi ng in this part of the world, don G enaro?\" I asked. \"He came to enjoy the hot wind,\" don J uan said. \"Isn't that right?\" \"That's right,\" don G enaro echoed. \"You've no idea what the hot wind can do t o an old body l ike mine.\" I sat down between them. \"What does it do to your body? \" I asked. \"The hot wind tells extraordinarily things to my body,\" he said. He turned to don J uan, his eyes glittering. \"Isn't that so?\" Don Juan shook hi s head affirmatively. I told them that the time of the hot Santa Ana winds was the worst part of the year for me, and that it was certainly strange that don G enaro would come to seek the hot wind while I was running away from it. \"Carlos can't stand the heat,\" don J uan said to don G enaro. \"When it gets hot he becomes like a child and suffocates.\" \"Suffowhat?\" \"Suffo ... c ates.\" \"My goodne ss!\" don G enaro said, feigning concern, and m ade a gesture of despair which was indescribably funny. Don Juan explained to him next that I had been away for months because of an unf ortunate incident with the allies. \"So, you' ve finally encountered an ally !\" don G enaro said. \"I think I did,\" I said cautiously. They laughed loudly. Don Genaro patted me on the back two or three times. It was a very light tapping which I interpreted as a friendly gesture of concern. He rested his hand on m y shoulder as he looked at me, and I had a feeling of placid contentment, which lasted onl y an instant, for next don G enaro did something inexplicable to 127"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"me. I suddenly felt that he had put the weight of a boul der on m y back. I had the sensation that he had increased the weight of his hand, w hich was resting on m y right shoulder, until it made me sag all the way dow n and I hit my head on t he ground. \"We must help little Carlos,\" don G enaro said and ga ve a conspiratorial look t o don J uan. I sat up straight again and turned to don J uan, but he looked away. I had a moment of vacillation and the annoyi ng thought that don J uan was acting as if he were aloof, detached from me. Don Genaro was laughing; he seemed to be waiting for my reaction. I asked him to put his hand on m y shoulder once more, but he did not want to do i t. I urged him at least to tell me what he had done to me. He chuckled. I turned to don J uan again and told him that the weight of don G enaro's hand ha d nearly crushed me. \"I don't know anything about it,\" don J uan said in a comically factual tone. \"He didn't put his hand on m y shoulder.\" With that both of them broke up laughing. \"What did you do t o me, don G enaro?” I asked. \"I just put my hand on your shoulder,\" he said innocently. \"Do it again,\" I said. He refused. Don Juan interceded at that point and asked me to describe to don G enaro what I had perceived in my last experience. I thought he wanted me to give a bona fide description of what had happened to me, but the more serious my description be came the more they laughed. I stopped two or three times but they urged me to go on. \"The ally will come to you r egardless of your feelings,\" don J uan said when I had finished my account. \"I mean, you don' t have to do a nything to lure him out. You m ay be sitting twiddling your thumbs, or thinking about women and then suddenly, a tap on your shoulder, you t urn around a nd the ally is standing by you.\" \"What can I do if something like that happens?\" I asked. \"Hey! Hey! Wait a minute!\" don G enaro said. \"That's not a good que stion. Y ou shouldn't ask what can you do, obvi ously you c an't do anything. Y ou should ask what can a warrior do?\" He turned to me, blinking. H is head was slightly tilted to the right, and hi s mouth was puckered. I looked at don J uan for a cue whether the situation was a joke, but he kept a solemn face. \"All right!\" I said. \"What can a warrior do?\" Don Genaro blinked and m ade smacking sounds with his lips, as if he were searching for a right word. He looked at me fixedly, hol ding hi s chin. \"A warrior wets his pants,\" he said with Indian solemnity. Don Juan covered his face and don G enaro slapped the ground, e xploding in a howling laughter. \"Fright is something one can never get over,\" don J uan said after the laughter had subsided, \"When a warrior is caught in such a tight spot he would simply turn his back to the ally without thinking twice. A warrior cannot indulge, thus he cannot die of fright. A warrior allows the ally to come only when he is good a nd ready. W hen he is strong e nough t o grapple with the ally he opens his gap and lurches out, grabs the ally , keeps him pinned dow n and m aintains his stare on hi m for exactly the time he has to, then he moves his eyes away and releases the ally and lets him go. A warrior, my little friend, is the master at all times.\" \"What happens if you s tare at an ally for too long?\" I asked. Don Genaro looked at me and m ade a comical gesture of outstaring. \"Who know s?\" don J uan said. \"Maybe Genaro will tell you w hat happened to him.\" \"Maybe,\" don G enaro said and chuckled. \"Would you pl ease tell me?\" Don Genaro got up, c racked his bone s stretching hi s arms, and ope ned his eyes until they were round a nd looked crazy. \"Genaro is going to make the desert tremble,\" he said and went into the chaparral. \"Genaro is determined to help you,\" don J uan said in a confidential tone. \"He did the same thing to you a t his 128"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"house and you a lmost saw \" I thought he was referring to what had happened at the waterfall, but he was talking about some unearthly rumbling sounds I had heard at don G enaro's hous e. \"By the way, what was it?\" I asked. \"We laughed at it, but you ne ver explained to me what it was.\" \"You ha ve never asked.\" \"I did.\" \"No. You ha ve asked me about everything else except that.\" Don Juan looked at me accusingly. \"That was Genaro's art,\" he said. \"Only Genaro can do t hat. You almost saw then.\" I told him that it had never occurred to me to associate \"seeing\" with the strange noises I had heard at that time. \"And why not ?\" he asked flatly. \" Seeing means the eyes to me,\" I said. He scrutinized me for a moment as if there were something wrong w ith me. \"I never said that seeing is a matter of the eyes alone,\" he said and shook hi s head in disbelief. \"How does he do it?\" I insisted. \"He has already told you how he does it,\" don J uan said sharply. At that very moment I heard an extraordinary rumble. I jumped up a nd don J uan began to laugh. T he rumble was like a thunde rous avalanche. Listening to it, I had the funny r ealization that my inventory of experiences in sound c onies definitely from the movies. The deep thunde r I heard resembled the sound t rack of a movie when the whole side of a mountain falls into a valley. Don Juan held his sides as if they hur t from laughing. T he thunde rous rumble shook t he ground w here I stood. I distinctly heard the thump of what seemed to be a monum ental boul der that was rolling on i ts sides. I heard a series of crushing thumps that gave me the impression that the boul der was rolling inexorably toward me. I experienced a moment of supreme confusion. M y muscles were tense; my whole body w as ready for fleeing. I looked at don J uan. He was staring at me. I then heard the most frightening thump I had ever heard in my life. It was as if a monum ental boul der had landed right behind the hous e. Everything shook, a nd at that moment I had a most peculiar perception. F or an instant I actually \" saw \" a boul der the size of a mountain right behind the house. It was not as if an image had been superimposed on t he scenery of the hous e I was looking at. It was not the view of a real boul der either. It was rather as if the noise was creating the image of a boul der rolling on i ts monum ental sides. I was actually \" seeing \" the noise. The inexplicable character of my perception threw me into the depths of despair and confusion. N ever in my life would I have conceived that my senses were capable of perceiving in such a manner. I had an attack of rational fright and de cided to flee for my life. Don Juan held me by the arm and or dered me imperatively not to run away and not to turn around e ither, but face the direction in which don G enaro had gone . I heard next a series of boom ing noi ses, which resembled the sound of rocks falling and pi ling on t op of each other, and then everything was quiet again. A few minutes later don G enaro came back and sat down. He asked me if I had \"seen.\" I did not know what to say. I turned to don J uan for a cue. He was staring at me. \"I think he did,\" he said and chuckled. I wanted to say that I did not know what they were talking about. I felt terribly frustrated. I had a phys ical sensation of wrath, of utter discomfort. \"I think we should leave him here to sit alone,\" don J uan said. They got up and walked by m e. \"Carlos is indulging in his confusion,\" don J uan said very loudly. I stayed alone for hour s and ha d time to write my not es and to ponde r on the absurdity of my experience. Upon t hinking about it, it became obvi ous to me that from the very moment I saw don G enaro sitting unde r the ramada the situation ha d acquired a farcical mood. T he more I deliberated about it the more convinced I became that don J uan had relinquished the control over to don G enaro and that thought filled me with apprehension. 129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Don Juan and don G enaro returned at dusk. They sat down next to me, flanking m e. Don Genaro drew closer and almost leaned on m e. His thin and frail shoulder touched me lightly and I experienced the same feeling I had had when he tapped me. A crushing weight toppled me over and I tumbled ont o don J uan's lap. He helped me to sit up straight and asked in a joking tone if I was trying to sleep on hi s lap. Don Genaro seemed to be delighted; his eyes shone. I wanted to weep. I had the feeling I was like an animal that had been corralled. \"Am I frightening you, l ittle Carlos?\" don G enaro asked and seemed really concerned. \"You look l ike a wild horse.\" \"Tell him a story,\" don J uan said. \"That's the only thing that calms him.\" They moved away and sat in front of me. Both of them examined me with curiosity. In the semidarkness their eyes seemed glassy, like enormous dark pool s of water. Their eyes were awesome. They were not the eyes of men. We stared at each other for a moment and then I moved my eyes away. I noticed that I was not afraid of them, and ye t their eyes had frightened me to the point that I was shivering. I felt a most uncomfortable confusion. After a moment of silence don J uan urged don G enaro to tell me what had happened to him at the time he had tried to out stare his ally . Don Genaro was sitting a few feet away, facing m e; he did not say anything. I looked at him; his eyes seemed to be four or five tunes the size of ordinary hum an eyes; they were shining and had a compelling attraction. W hat seemed to be the light of his eyes dom inated everything around t hem. Don Genaro's body s eemed to have shriveled and looked more like the body of a feline. I noticed a movement of his cat-like body a nd be came frightened. In a completely automatic way, as if I had been doi ng it all my life, I adopted a \"fighting form\" and be gan beating rhythmically on m y calf. When I became aware of my acts I got embarrassed and looked at don J uan, He was peering at me as he does ordinarily; his eyes were kind and soothing. H e laughed loudly. Don Genaro made a purring sound a nd stood up a nd went inside the hous e. Don Juan explained to me that don G enaro was very forceful and di d not like to piddle around a nd that he had been just teasing m e with his eyes. He said that, as usual, I knew more than I myself expected. He made a comment that everyone who was involved with sorcery was terribly dangerous during the hour s of twilight and that sorcerers like don G enaro could perform marvels at that time. We were quiet for a few minutes. I felt better. Talking to don J uan relaxed me and restored my confidence. Then he said that he was going to eat something and that we were going for a walk so that don G enaro could show me a technique for hiding. I asked him to explain what he meant by a technique for hiding. H e said he was through w ith explaining things to me because explaining onl y forced me to indulge. We went inside the hous e. Don Genaro had lit the kerosene lantern and was chewing a mouthful of food. After eating, the three of us walked into the thick desert chaparral Don Juan walked almost next to me. Don Genaro was in front, a few yards ahead of us. It was a clear night, there were heavy clouds, but enough m oonlight to render the surroundi ngs quite visible. At one moment don J uan stopped and told me to go a head and follow don G enaro. I vacillated; he pushed me gently and assured me it was all right. He said I should always be ready and should always trust my own strength. I followed don G enaro and for the next two hour s I tried to catch up w ith him, but no m atter how hard I struggled I could not overtake him. Don Genaro's silhouette was always ahead of me. Sometimes he disappeared as if he had jumped to the side of the trail only to appear again ahead of me. As far as I was concerned, this seemed to be a strange and m eaningless walk in the dark. I followed because I did not know how to return to the house. I could not unde rstand what don G enaro was doing. I thought he was leading m e to some recondite place in the chaparral to show me the technique don J uan had talked about At a certain poi nt, how ever, I had the peculiar sensation that don G enaro was behind m e. I turned around a nd caught a glimpse of a person some distance behind m e. The effect was startling. I strained to see in the darkness and I believed I could make out the silhouette of a man standing pe rhaps fifteen yards away. The figure was almost merged with the bushes; it was as if he wanted to conceal himself. I stared fixedly for a moment and I could actually keep the silhouette of the man 130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"within my field of perception even though he was trying to hide behind the dark shapes of the bushes. Then a logical thought came to my mind. It occurred to me that the man had to be don J uan, who m ust have been following us all the time. The instant I became convinced that that was so, I also realized I could no l onger isolate his silhouette; all I had in front of me was the undi fferentiated dark mass of the desert chaparral. I walked toward the place I had seen the man, but I could not find anybody. D on Genaro was nowhere in sight either, and since I did not know my way I sat down to wait. A half hour later, don J uan and don G enaro came by. T hey called my name out loud. I stood up a nd joined them. We walked to the hous e in complete silence. I welcomed that quiet interlude, for I felt completely disoriented. In fact, I felt unknow n to myself. Don Genaro was doing something to me, something which kept me from formulating m y thought s the way I am accustomed to doing. T his became evident to me when I sat down on the trail. I had automatically checked the time when I sat down and then I had remained qui et as if my mind ha d been turned off. Yet I sat in a state of alertness I have never experienced before. It was a state of thought lessness, perhaps comparable to not caring about anything. T he world seemed to be, during that time, in a strange balance; there was nothing I could add to it and not hing I could subtract from it. When we arrived at the hous e don G enaro rolled out a straw mat and went to sleep. I felt compelled to render my experiences of the day to don J uan. He did not let me talk. October 18,1970 \"I think I unde rstand what don G enaro was trying to do t he other night,\" I said to don J uan. I said that in order to draw him out. His continual refusal to talk was unne rving m e. Don Juan smiled and shook hi s head slowly as if agreeing with what I had said. I would have taken his gesture as an affirmation except for the strange glint in his eyes. It was as if his eyes were laughing at me. \"You don' t think I unde rstand, do you? \" I asked compulsively. \"I suppos e you do... you do, i n fact. You do unde rstand that Genaro was behind you a ll the time. However, understanding is not the real point\" His statement that don G enaro had been behind m e all the time was shocking to me. I begged him to explain it. \"Your mind is set to seek onl y one side of this,\" he said. He took a dry twig and m oved it in the air. He was not drawing in the air or making a figure; what he did resembled the movements he makes with his fingers when he cleans the debris from a pile of seeds. His movements were like a soft prodding or scratching the air with the twig. He turned and looked at me and I shrugged my shoulders automatically in a gesture of bafflement. He drew closer and repeated his movements, making eight points on the ground. H e circled the first point. \"You are here,\" he said. \"We are all here; this is feeling, and we move from here to here.\" He circled the second, w hich he had drawn right above num ber one. He then moved his twig back and forth between the two poi nts to por tray a heavy traffic. \"There are, how ever, six more points a man is capable of handling,\" he said. \"Most men know nothing about them.\" He placed his twig between poi nts one and two and pe cked on t he ground w ith it. \"To move between these two poi nts you c all unde rstanding. Y ou've been doi ng that all your life. If you s ay you unde rstand m y know ledge, you ha ve done nothing ne w.\" He then joined some of the eight points to the others with lines; the result was a long t rapezoid figure that had eight centers of uneven radiation. \"Each of these six remaining poi nts is a world, just like feeling and unde rstanding are two worlds for you,\" he said. \"Why eight points? Why not an infinite num ber, as in a circle?\" I asked. I drew a circle on the ground. D on Juan smiled. \"As far as I know there are only eight points a man is capable of handling. P erhaps men cannot go be yond that. And I said handling, not unde rstanding, di d you ge t that?\" 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"His tone was so funny I laughed. He was imitating or rather mocking m y insistence on the exact usage of words. \"Your problem is that you w ant to unde rstand everything, and that is not possible. If you i nsist on understanding you' re not considering your entire lot as a hum an being. Y our stumbling bl ock is intact Therefore, you ha ve done almost nothing in all these years. You ha ve been shaken out of your total slumber, true, but that could have been accomplished anyway by ot her circumstances.\" After a pause don J uan told me to get up be cause we were going to the water canyon. A s we were getting into my car don G enaro came out from behind the hous e and joined us. I drove part of the way and then we walked into a deep ravine. Don Juan picked a place to rest in the shade of a large tree. \"You m entioned onc e,\" don J uan began, \"that a friend of your s had said, when the two of you s aw a leaf falling from the very top of a sycamore, that that same leaf will not fall again from that same sycamore ever in a whole eternity, remember?\" I remembered having told him about that incident. \"We are at the foot of a large tree,\" he continued, \"and now if we look a t that other tree in front of us we may see a leaf falling from the very top.\" He signaled me to look. T here was a large tree on the other side of the gully; its leaves were yellowish and dry. He urged me with a movement of his head to keep on l ooking at the tree. After a few minutes wait, a leaf cracked loose from the top and be gan falling to the ground; it hit other leaves and br anches three times before it landed in the tall unde rbrush. \"Did you s ee it?\" \"Yes.\" \"You would say that the same leaf will never again fall from that same tree, true?\" \"True.\" \"To the best of your unde rstanding that is true. But that is only to the best of your unde rstanding. L ook again.\" I automatically looked and saw a leaf falling. It actually hit the same leaves and br anches as the previous one. It was as if I were looking at an instant television replay. I followed the wavy falling of the leaf until it landed on the ground. I stood up t o find out if there were two leaves, but the tall unde rbrush around t he tree prevented me from seeing where the leaf had actually landed. Don Juan laughed and told me to sit down. \"Look,\" he said, poi nting with his head to the top of the tree. \"There goes the same leaf again.\" I once more saw a leaf falling in exactly the same pattern as the previous two. When it had landed I knew don J uan was about to signal me again to look a t the top of the tree, but before he did I looked up. T he leaf was again falling. I realized then that I had onl y seen the first leaf cracking loose, or, rather, the first time the leaf fell I saw it from the instant it became detached from the branch; the other three times the leaf was already falling when I lifted my head to look. I told that to don J uan and I urged him to explain what he was doing. \"I don't unde rstand how you're making m e see a repetition of what I had seen before. What did you do t o me, don J uan?\" He laughed but did not answer and I insisted that he should tell me how I could see that leaf falling ove r and over. I said that according to my reason that was impossible. Don Juan said that his reason told him the same, yet I had witnessed the leaf falling ove r and ove r. He then turned to don G enaro. \"Isn't that so?\" he asked. Don Genaro did not answer. His eyes were fixed on m e. \"It is impossible!\" I said. \"You're chained!\" don J uan exclaimed. \"You're chained to your reason.\" He explained that the leaf had fallen ove r and ove r from that same tree so I would stop trying to unde rstand. 132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"In a confidential tone he told me that I had the whole thing pa t and ye t my mania always blinded me at the end. \"There's nothing to unde rstand. U nderstanding is only a very small affair, so very small,\" he said. At that point don G enaro stood up. H e gave a quick glance to don J uan; their eyes met and don J uan looked at the ground i n front of him. Don Genaro stood i n front of me and be gan swinging hi s arms at his sides, back and forth in uni son. \"Look, l ittle Carlos,\" he said. \"Look! Look!\" He made an extraordinarily sharp, swishing sound. I t was the sound of something ripping. A t the precise instant the sound ha ppened, I felt a sensation of vacuity in my lower abdom en. It was the terribly anguishing sensation of falling, not painful, but rather unpl easant and consuming. It lasted a few seconds and then it subsided, leaving a strange itch in my kne es. But while the sensation ha d lasted I experienced another unbelievable phenomenon. I saw don G enaro on t op of some mountains that were perhaps ten miles away. The perception lasted onl y a few seconds and it happened so une xpectedly that I did not have time really to examine it. I cannot recall whether I saw a man-size figure standing on t op of the mountains, or a reduced image of don Genaro. I cannot even recall whether or not it was don G enaro. Yet at that moment I was certain beyond a ny doubt that I was seeing hi m standing on t op of the mountains. However, the moment I thought that I could not possibly see a man ten miles away the perception va nished. I turned around t o look f or don G enaro, but he was not there. The bafflement I experienced was as unique as everything else that was happening to me. My mind buc kled under the strain. I felt utterly disoriented. Don Juan stood up a nd m ade me cover the lower part of my abdom en with my hands and pr ess my legs tightly against my body i n a squat position. W e sat in silence for a while and then he said that he was truly goi ng to refrain from explaining anything to me, because only by a cting can one become a sorcerer. He recommended that I leave immediately, otherwise don G enaro would probably kill me in his effort to help me. \"You are going to change directions,\" he said, \"and you' ll break your chains.\" He said that there was nothing to unde rstand about his or about don G enaro's actions, and that sorcerers were quite capable of performing extraordinary feats. \"Genaro and I are acting from here,\" he said and poi nted to one of the centers of radiation in his diagram. \"And it is not the center of unde rstanding, ye t you know what it is.\" I wanted to say that I did not really know what he was talking about, but he did not give me time and stood up and signaled me to follow him. He began to walk fast and in no t ime at all I was puffing and sweating trying to keep up w ith him. When we were getting inside the car I looked around f or don G enaro. \"Where is he?\" I asked \"You know where he is,\" don J uan snapped at me. Before I left I sat down with him, as I always do. I had an ove rwhelming ur ge to ask for explanations. As don Juan says, explanations are truly my indulgence. \"Where's don G enaro?\" I asked cautiously. \"You know where,\" he said. \"Yet you f ail every time because of your insistence on unde rstanding. F or example, you kne w the other night that Genaro was behind you a ll the time; you e ven turned around a nd saw him.\" \"No,\" I protested. \"No, I didn't know that.\" I was truthful at that. My mind refused to intake that sort of stimuli as being \"real,\" and ye t, after ten years of apprenticeship with don J uan my mind could no l onger uphol d my old ordinary criteria of what is real. However, all the speculations I had thus far engendered about the nature of reality had been mere intellectual manipulations; the proof was that unde r the pressure of don J uan and don G enaro's acts my mind ha d entered into an impasse. Don Juan looked at me and there was such sadness in his eyes that I began to weep. Tears fell freely. For the first time in my life I felt the encumbering weight of my reason.
