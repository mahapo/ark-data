I haveexplained in those books that he taught me sorcery, but not as we understandsorcery in the context of our daily world: not the use of supernatural powersover others; nor the calling of spirits through charms, spells, or rituals toproduce supernatural effects. For don Juan, sorcery was the act of embodyingsome specialized theoretical and practical premises about the nature and role ofperception in molding the universe around us.Following don Juan's suggestion, I have refrained from using the term shamanism,a category proper to anthropology, to classify his knowledge. I have called itall along what he himself called it: sorcery. On examination, however, Irealized that calling it sorcery obscures even more the already obscurephenomena he presented to me in his teachings.In anthropological works, shamanism is described as a belief system of somenative people of northern Asia, prevailing also among certain native NorthAmerican Indian tribes, which maintains that an unseen world of ancestralspiritual forces, good and evil, is pervasive around us; and that thesespiritual forces can be summoned or controlled through the acts of practitionerswho are the intermediaries between the natural and supernatural realms.Don Juan was indeed an intermediary between the natural world of everyday lifeand an unseen world, which he called not the supernatural but the secondattention. His role as a teacher was to make this configuration accessible tome. I have described in my previous work his teaching methods to this effect aswell as the sorcery arts he made me practice. The most important of which iscalled the art of dreaming.Don Juan contended that our world, which we believe to be unique and absolute,is only one in a cluster of consecutive worlds arranged like the layers of anonion. He asserted that even though we have been energetically conditioned toperceive solely our world, we still have the capability of entering into thoseother realms; which are as real, unique, absolute, and engulfing as our ownworld is.Don Juan explained to me that, for us to perceive those other realms, not onlydo we have to covet them, but we need to have sufficient energy to seize them.Their existence is constant and independent of our awareness, he said, but theirinaccessibility is entirely a consequence of our energetic conditioning. Inother words, simply and solely because of our conditioning, we are compelled toassume that the world of daily life is the one and only possible world.Believing that our energetic conditioning is correctable, don Juan stated thatsorcerers of ancient times developed a set of practices designed to reconditionour energetic capabilities to perceive. They called this set of practices theart of dreaming.With the perspective time gives, I now realize that the most fitting statementdon Juan made about dreaming was to call it the 'gateway to infinity'. Iremarked at the time he said it that the metaphor had no meaning to me.\"Let's then do away with metaphors,\" he conceded. \"Let's say that dreaming isthe sorcerers' practical way of putting ordinary dreams to use.\"\"But how can ordinary dreams be put to use?\" I asked.\"We always get tricked by words,\" he said. \"In my own case, my teacher attemptedto describe dreaming to me by saying that it is the way sorcerers say good nightto the world. He was, of course, tailoring his description to fit my mentality.I'm doing the same with you.\"On another occasion don Juan said to me, \"Dreaming can only be experienced.Dreaming is not just having dreams; neither is it daydreaming or wishing orimagining. Through dreaming we can perceive other worlds which we can certainlydescribe, but we can't describe what makes us perceive them. Yet we can feel howdreaming opens up those other realms. Dreaming seems to be a sensation; aprocess in our bodies; an awareness in our minds.\"In the course of his general teachings, don Juan thoroughly explained to me theprinciples, rationales, and practices of the art of dreaming. His instructionwas divided into two parts. One part was about dreaming procedures, and theother part was about the purely abstract explanations of these procedures. Histeaching method was an interplay between enticing my intellectual curiosity withthe abstract principles of dreaming, and guiding me to seek an outlet in itspractices.I have already described all this in as much detail as I had been able to. And Ihave also described the sorcerers' milieu in which don Juan placed me in orderto teach me his arts. My interaction in this milieu was of special interest tome because it took place exclusively in the 'second attention'. I interactedthere with the ten women and five men who were don Juan's sorcerer companionsand with the four young men and the four young women who were his apprentices.Don Juan gathered them immediately after I came into his world. He made it clearto me that they formed a traditional sorcerers' group- a replica of his ownparty- and that I was supposed to lead them.However, working with me he realized that I was different than he expected. Heexplained that difference in terms of an energy configuration seen only bysorcerer seers. Instead of having four compartments of energy as he himself had,I had only three.Such a configuration, which he had mistakenly hoped was a correctable flaw, mademe completely inadequate for interacting with or leading those eightapprentices. I have written extensively about those events.Because of my configuration, it became imperative for don Juan to gather anothergroup of people more akin to my energetic structure. I have never mentioned thesecond group of apprentices: Don Juan did not permit me to do so. He argued thatthey were exclusively in my field, and that the agreement I had had with him wasto write about his field; not mine.The second group of apprentices was extremely compact. It had only threemembers: a dreamer, Florinda Grau; a stalker, Taisha Abelar; and a nagual woman,Carol Tiggs.We interacted with one another solely in the second attention. In the world ofeveryday life, we did not have even a vague notion of one another. In terms ofour relationship with don Juan, however, there was no vagueness. He put enormouseffort into training all of us equally.Nevertheless, toward the end when don Juan's time was about to finish, thepsychological pressure of his departure started to collapse the rigid boundariesof the second attention. The result was that our interaction began to lapse intothe world of everyday affairs; and we met, seemingly, for the first time.None of us, consciously, knew about our deep and arduous interaction in thesecond attention. Since all of us were involved in academic studies, we ended upmore than shocked when we found out we had met before. This was and still is, ofcourse, intellectually inadmissible to us, yet we know that it was thoroughlywithin our experience. We have been left, therefore, with the disquietingknowledge that the human psyche is infinitely more complex than our mundane oracademic reasoning had led us to believe.Once we asked don Juan, in unison, to shed light on our predicament. He saidthat he had two explanatory options.One option was to cater to our hurt rationality and patch it up by saying thatthe second attention is a state of awareness as illusory as elephants flying inthe sky; and that everything we thought we had experienced in that state wassimply a product of hypnotic suggestions.The other option was to explain it the way sorcerer dreamers understand it; asan energetic configuration of awareness.During the fulfillment of my dreaming tasks, however, the barrier of the secondattention remained unchanged. Every time I entered into dreaming, I also enteredinto the second attention, and waking up from dreaming did not necessarily meanI had left the second attention.For years I could remember only bits of my dreaming experiences. The bulk ofwhat I did was energetically unavailable to me.It took me fifteen years of uninterrupted work, from 1973 to 1988, to storeenough energy to rearrange everything linearly in my mind. I remembered thensequences upon sequences of dreaming events, and I was able to fill in, at last,some seeming lapses of memory. In this manner I captured the inherent continuityof don Juan's lessons in the art of dreaming; a continuity that had been lost tome because of his making me weave between the awareness of our everyday life andthe awareness of the second attention. This work is a result of thatrearrangement.All this brings me to the final part of my statement: the reason for writingthis book.Being in possession of most of the pieces of don Juan's lessons in the art ofdreaming, I would like to explain in a future work the current position andinterest of his last four students: Florinda Grau, Taisha Abelar, Carol Tiggs,and myself.But before I describe and explain the results of don Juan's guidance andinfluence on us four, I must review, in light of what I know now, the parts ofdon Juan's lessons in dreaming to which I did not have access before.The definitive reason for this work, however, was given by Carol Tiggs. Herbelief is that explaining the world that don Juan made us inherit is theultimate expression of our gratitude to him and our commitment to his quest. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"1. Sorcerers of Antiquity: An IntroductionVery early in our relationship, Don Juan stressed, time and time again, thateverything he was teaching me had been envisioned and worked out by men hereferred to as sorcerers of antiquity. He made it very clear that there was aprofound distinction between those sorcerers and the sorcerers of modern times.He categorized sorcerers of antiquity as men who existed in Mexico perhapsthousands of years before the Spanish Conquest; men whose greatestaccomplishment had been to build the structures of sorcery, emphasizingpracticality and concreteness. He rendered them as men who were brilliant butlacking in wisdom.Modern sorcerers, by contrast, don Juan portrayed as men renowned for theirsound minds and their capacity to rectify the course of sorcery if they deemedit necessary.Don Juan explained to me that the sorcery premises pertinent to dreaming werenaturally envisioned and developed by sorcerers of antiquity. Out of necessity,for those premises are key in explaining and understanding dreaming, I againhave to write about and discuss them. The major part of this book is, therefore,a reintroduction and amplification of what I have presented in my previousworks. During one of our conversations, don Juan stated that in order to appreciate theposition of dreamers and dreaming, one has to understand the struggle ofmodern-day sorcerers to steer sorcery away from concreteness toward theabstract.\"What do you call concreteness, don Juan?\" I asked.\"The practical part of sorcery,\" he said. \"The obsessive fixation of the mind onpractices and techniques, and the unwarranted influence over people. All ofthese were in the realm of the sorcerers of the past.\"\"And what do you call the abstract?\"\"The search for freedom; freedom to perceive, without obsessions, all that'shumanly possible. I say that present-day sorcerers seek the abstract becausethey seek freedom. They have no interest in concrete gains. There are no socialfunctions for them as there were for the sorcerers of the past. So you'll nevercatch them being the official seers, or the sorcerers in residence.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that the past has no value to modern-day sorcerers?\"\"It certainly has value. It's the taste of that past which we don't like. Ipersonally detest the darkness and morbidity of the mind. I like the immensityof thought. However, regardless of my likes and dislikes, I have to give duecredit to the sorcerers of antiquity, for they were the first to find out and doeverything we know and do today.Don Juan explained that sorcerers of antiquity's most important attainment wasto perceive the energetic essence of things. This insight was of such importancethat it was turned into the basic premise of sorcery. Nowadays, after lifelongdiscipline and training, sorcerers do acquire the capacity to perceive theessence of things; a capacity they call seeing.\"What would it mean to me to perceive the energetic essence of things?\" I onceasked don Juan.\"It would mean that you perceive energy directly,\" he replied. \"By separatingthe social part of perception, you'll perceive the essence of everything.Whatever we are perceiving is energy, but since we can't directly perceiveenergy, we process our perception to fit a mold. This mold is the social part ofperception, which you have to separate.\"\"Why do I have to separate it?\"\"Because it deliberately reduces the scope of what can be perceived and makes usbelieve that the mold into which we fit our perception is all that exists. I amconvinced that for man to survive now, his perception must change at its socialbase.\"\"What is this social base of perception, don Juan?\"\"The physical certainty that the world is made of concrete objects. I call thisa social base because a serious and fierce effort is put out by everybody toguide us to perceive the world the way we do.\"\"How then should we perceive the world?\"\"Everything is energy. The whole universe is energy. The social base of ourperception should be the physical certainty that energy is all there is. Amighty effort should be made to guide us to perceive energy as energy. Then wewould have both alternatives at our fingertips.\"\"Is it possible to train people in such a fashion?\" I asked.Don Juan replied that it was possible and that this was precisely what he wasdoing with me and his other apprentices. He was teaching us a new way ofperceiving; first, by making us realize we process our perception to fit a mold;and second, by fiercely guiding us to perceive energy directly. He assured methat this method was very much like the one used to teach us to perceive theworld of daily affairs.Don Juan's conception was that our entrapment in processing our perception tofit a social mold loses its power when we realize we have accepted this mold asan inheritance from our ancestors without bothering to examine it.\"To perceive a world of hard objects that had either a positive or a negativevalue must have been utterly necessary for our ancestors' survival,\" don Juansaid. \"After ages of perceiving in such a manner, we are now forced to believethat the world is made up of objects.\"\"I can't conceive the world in any other way, don Juan,\" I complained. \"It isunquestionably a world of objects. To prove it, all we have to do is bump intothem.\"\"Of course it's a world of objects. We are not arguing that.\"\"What are you saying then?\"\"I am saying that this is first a world of energy; then it's a world of objects.If we don't start with the premise that it is a world of energy, we'll never beable to perceive energy directly. We'll always be stopped by the physicalcertainty of what you've just pointed out: the hardness of objects.\"His argument was extremely mystifying to me. In those days, my mind would simplyrefuse to consider any way to understand the world except the one with which Iwas familiar. Don Juan's claims and the points he struggled to raise wereoutlandish propositions that I could not accept, but that I could not refuseeither.\"Our way of perceiving is a predator's way,\" he said to me on one occasion. \"Avery efficient manner of appraising and classifying food and danger. But this isnot the only way we are able to perceive. There is another mode; the one I amfamiliarizing you with; the act of perceiving the essence of everything- energyitself- directly.\"To perceive the essence of everything will make us understand, classify, anddescribe the world in entirely new, more exciting, and more sophisticatedterms.\"That was don Juan's claim.The more sophisticated terms to which he was alluding were those he had beentaught by his predecessors; terms that correspond to sorcery truths which haveno rational foundation and no relation whatsoever to the facts of our dailyworld; but which are self-evident truths for the sorcerers who perceive energydirectly and see the essence of everything.For such sorcerers, the most significant act of sorcery is to see the essence ofthe universe. Don Juan's version was that the sorcerers of antiquity- the firstones to see the essence of the universe- described it in the best manner. Theysaid that the essence of the universe resembles incandescent threads stretchedinto infinity in every conceivable direction; luminous filaments that areconscious of themselves in ways impossible for the human mind to comprehend.From seeing the essence of the universe, the sorcerers of antiquity went on tosee the energy essence of human beings. Don Juan stated that they depicted humanbeings as bright shapes that resembled giant eggs and called them luminous eggs.\"When sorcerers see a human being,\" don Juan said, \"they see a giant, luminousshape that floats, making, as it moves, a deep furrow in the energy of theearth, just as if the luminous shape had a taproot that was dragging.\"Don Juan had the impression that our energy shape keeps on changing throughtime. He said that every seer he knew, himself included, saw that human beingsare shaped more like balls or even tombstones than eggs. But, once in a while,and for no reason known to them, sorcerers see a person whose energy is shapedlike an egg. Don Juan suggested that people who are egglike in shape today aremore akin to people of ancient times.In the course of his teachings, don Juan repeatedly discussed and explained whathe considered the decisive finding of the sorcerers of antiquity. He called itthe crucial feature of human beings as luminous balls; a round spot of intensebrilliance, the size of a tennis ball, permanently lodged inside the luminousball, flush with its surface, about two feet back from the crest of a person'sright shoulder blade.Since I had trouble visualizing this the first time don Juan described it to me,he explained that the luminous ball is much larger than the human body, that thespot of intense brilliance is part of this ball of energy, and that it islocated on a place at the height of the shoulder blades, an arm's length from aperson's back. He said that the old sorcerers named it the assemblage pointafter seeing what it does.\"What does the assemblage point do?\" I asked.\"It makes us perceive,\" he replied. \"The old sorcerers saw that in human beingsperception is assembled there, on that point. Seeing that all living beings alsohave a point of brilliance, the old sorcerers surmised that perception ingeneral must take place on that spot, in whatever pertinent manner.\"\"What did the old sorcerers see that made them conclude that perception takesplace on the assemblage point?\" I asked.He answered that, first, they saw that out of the millions of the universe'sluminous energy filaments passing through the entire luminous ball, only a smallnumber pass directly through the assemblage point, as should be expected sinceit is small in comparison with the whole.Next, they saw that a spherical extra glow, slightly bigger than the assemblagepoint, always surrounds it, greatly intensifying the luminosity of the filamentspassing directly through that glow.Finally, they saw two things. One, that the assemblage points of human beingscan dislodge themselves from the spot where they are usually located.And, two, that when the assemblage point is on its habitual position, perceptionand awareness seem to be normal, judging by the normal behavior of the subjectsbeing observed. But when their assemblage points and surrounding glowing spheresare on a different position than the habitual one, their unusual behavior seemsto be the proof that their awareness is different; that they are perceiving inan unfamiliar manner.The conclusion the old sorcerers drew from all this was that the greater thedisplacement of the assemblage point from its customary position, the moreunusual the consequent behavior and, evidently, the consequent awareness andperception.\"Notice that when I talk about seeing, I always say \"having the appearance of\"or \"seemed like,\" don Juan warned me. \"Everything one sees is so unique thatthere is no way to talk about it except by comparing it to something known tous.\"He said that the most adequate example of this difficulty was the way sorcererstalk about the assemblage point and the glow that surrounds it. They describethem as brightness, yet it cannot be brightness, because seers see them withouttheir eyes. They have to fill out the difference, however, and say that theassemblage point is a spot of light and that around it there is a halo; a glow.Don Juan pointed out that we are so visual, so ruled by our predator'sperception, that everything we see must be rendered in terms of what thepredator's eye normally sees.After seeing what the assemblage point and its surrounding glow seemed to bedoing, don Juan said that the old sorcerers advanced an explanation. Theyproposed that in human beings the assemblage point, by focusing its glowingsphere on the universe's filaments of energy that pass directly through it,automatically and without premeditation assembles those filaments into a steadyperception of the world.\"How are those filaments you talk about assembled into a steady perception ofthe world?\" I asked.\"No one can possibly know that,\" he emphatically replied. \"Sorcerers see themovement of energy, but just seeing the movement of energy cannot tell them howor why energy moves.\"Don Juan stated that, seeing that millions of conscious energy filaments passthrough the assemblage point, the old sorcerers postulated that in passingthrough it they come together, amassed by the glow that surrounds it. Afterseeing that the glow is extremely dim in people who have been renderedunconscious or are about to die, and that it is totally absent from corpses,they were convinced that this glow is awareness.\"How about the assemblage point? Is it absent from a corpse?\" I asked.He answered that there is no trace of an assemblage point on a dead being,because the assemblage point and its surrounding glow are the mark of life andconsciousness. The inescapable conclusion of the sorcerers of antiquity was thatawareness and perception go together and are tied to the assemblage point andthe glow that surrounds it.\"Is there a chance that those sorcerers might have been mistaken about theirseeing?\" I asked.\"I can't explain to you why, but there is no way sorcerers can be mistaken abouttheir seeing,\" don Juan said, in a tone that admitted no argument. \"Now, theconclusions they arrive at from their seeing might be wrong, but that would bebecause they are naive; uncultivated. In order to avoid this disaster, sorcerershave to cultivate their minds, in whatever form they can.\"He softened up then and remarked that it certainly would be infinitely safer forsorcerers to remain solely at the level of describing what they see, but thatthe temptation to conclude and explain, even if only to oneself, is far toogreat to resist.The effect of the assemblage point's displacement was another energyconfiguration the sorcerers of antiquity were able to see and study. Don Juansaid that when the assemblage point is displaced to another position, a newconglomerate of millions of luminous energy filaments come together on thatpoint. The sorcerers of antiquity saw this and concluded that since the glow ofawareness is always present wherever the assemblage point is, perception isautomatically assembled there. Because of the different position of theassemblage point, the resulting world, however, cannot be our world of dailyaffairs.Don Juan explained that the old sorcerers were capable of distinguishing twotypes of assemblage point displacement.One was a displacement to any position on the surface or in the interior of theluminous ball; this displacement they called a shift of the assemblage point.The other was a displacement to a position outside the luminous ball; theycalled this displacement a movement of the assemblage point. They found out thatthe difference between a shift and a movement was the nature of the perceptioneach allows.Since the shifts of the assemblage point are displacements within the luminousball, the worlds engendered by them, no matter how bizarre or wondrous orunbelievable they might be, are still worlds within the human domain. The humandomain is the energy filaments that pass through the entire luminous ball.By contrast, movements of the assemblage point, since they are displacements topositions outside the luminous ball, engage filaments of energy that are beyondthe human realm. Perceiving such filaments engenders worlds that are beyondcomprehension, inconceivable worlds with no trace of human antecedents in them.The problem of validation always played a key role in my mind in those days.\"Forgive me, don Juan,\" I said to him on one occasion, \"but this business of theassemblage point is an idea so farfetched, so inadmissible that I don't know howto deal with it or what to think of it.\"\"There is only one thing for you to do,\" he retorted. \"See the assemblage point!It isn't that difficult to see. The difficulty is in breaking the retaining wallwe all have in our minds that holds us in place. To break it, all we need isenergy. Once we have energy, seeing happens to us by itself. The trick is inabandoning our fort of self-complacency and false security.\"\"It is obvious to me, don Juan, that it takes a lot of knowledge to see. Itisn't just a matter of having energy.\"\"It is just a matter of having energy, believe me. The hard part is convincingyourself that it can be done. For this, you need to trust the nagual. The marvelof sorcery is that every sorcerer has to prove everything with his ownexperience. I am telling you about the principles of sorcery, not with the hopethat you will memorize them, but with the hope that you will practice them.\"Don Juan was certainly right about the need for trusting. In the beginningstages of my thirteen-year apprenticeship with him, the hardest thing for me wasto affiliate myself with his world and his person. This affiliating meant that Ihad to learn to trust him implicitly and accept him without bias as the nagual.Don Juan's total role in the sorcerers' world was synthesized in the titleaccorded to him by his peers. He was called the nagual. It was explained to methat this concept refers to any person, male or female, who possesses a specifickind of energy configuration which to a seer appears as a double luminous ball.Seers believe that when one of these people enters into the sorcerers' world,that extra load of energy is turned into a measure of strength and the capacityfor leadership. Thus, the nagual is the natural guide; the leader of a party ofsorcerers.At first, to feel such a trust for don Juan was quite disturbing to me, if notaltogether odious. When I discussed it with him, he assured me that to trust histeacher in such a manner had been just as difficult for him.\"I told my teacher the same thing you are saying to me now,\" don Juan said. \"Hereplied that without trusting the nagual there is no possibility of relief, andthus no possibility of clearing the debris from our lives in order to be free.\"Don Juan reiterated how right his teacher had been. And I reiterated my profounddisagreement. I told him that my being reared in a stifling religiousenvironment had had dreadful effects on me, and that his teacher's statementsand his own acquiescence to his teacher reminded me of the obedience dogma thatI had to learn as a child, and that I abhorred.\"It sounds like you're voicing a religious belief when you talk about thenagual,\" I said.\"You may believe whatever you want,\" don Juan replied undauntedly. \"The factremains, there is no game without the nagual. I know this and I say so. And sodid all the naguals who preceded me. But they didn't say it from the standpointof self-importance, and neither do I.\"To say there is no path without the nagual is to refer totally to the fact thatthe man, the nagual, is a nagual because he can reflect the abstract, thespirit, better than others. But that's all. Our link is with the spirit itselfand only incidentally with the man who brings us its message.\"I did learn to trust don Juan implicitly as the nagual, and this, as he hadstated it, brought me an immense sense of relief and a greater capacity toaccept what he was striving to teach me.In his teachings, he put a great emphasis on explaining and discussing theassemblage point. I asked him once if the assemblage point had anything to dowith the physical body.\"It has nothing to do with what we normally perceive as the body,\" he said.\"It's part of the luminous egg, which is our energy self.\"\"How is it displaced?\" I asked.\"Through energy currents. Jolts of energy, originating outside or inside ourenergy shape. These are usually unpredictable currents that happen randomly, butwith sorcerers they are very predictable currents that obey the sorcerer'sintent.\"\"Can you yourself feel these currents?\"\"Every sorcerer feels them. Every human being does, for that matter, but averagehuman beings are too busy with their own pursuits to pay any attention tofeelings like that.\"\"What do those currents feel like?\"\"Like a mild discomfort, a vague sensation of sadness followed immediately byeuphoria. Since neither the sadness nor the euphoria has an explainable cause,we never regard them as veritable [* veritable- a word modifier that has littlemeaning except to intensify the meaning it modifies] onslaughts [* onslaught-the rapid and continuous delivery of linguistic communication (spoken orwritten)] of the unknown but as unexplainable, ill-founded moodiness.\"\"What happens when the assemblage point moves outside the energy shape? Does ithang outside? Or is it attached to the luminous ball?\"\"It pushes the contours of the energy shape out, without breaking its energyboundaries.\"Don Juan explained that the end result of a movement of the assemblage point isa total change in the energy shape of a human being. Instead of a ball or anegg, he becomes something resembling a smoking pipe. The tip of the stem is theassemblage point, and the bowl of the pipe is what remains of the luminous ball.If the assemblage point keeps on moving, a moment comes when the luminous ballbecomes a thin line of energy.Don Juan went on to explain that the old sorcerers were the only ones whoaccomplished this feat of energy shape transformation.I asked him whether in their new energetic shape those sorcerers were still men.\"Of course they were still men,\" he said. \"But I think what you want to know isif they were still men of reason, trustworthy persons. Well, not quite.\"\"In what way were they different?\"\"In their concerns. Human endeavors and preoccupations had no meaning whatsoeverto them. They also had a definite new appearance.\"\"Do you mean that they didn't look like men?\"\"It's very hard to tell what was what about those sorcerers. They certainlylooked like men. What else would they look like? But they were not quite likewhat you or I would expect. Yet if you pressed me to tell in what way they weredifferent, I would go in circles, like a dog chasing its tail.\"\"Have you ever met one of those men, don Juan?\"\"Yes, I have met one.\"\"What did he look like?\"\"As far as looks, he looked like a regular person. Now, it was his behavior thatwas unusual.\"\"In what way was it unusual?\"\"All I can tell you is that the behavior of the sorcerer I met is something thatdefies the imagination. But to make it a matter of merely behavior ismisleading. It is really something you must see to appreciate.\"\"Were all those sorcerers like the one you met?\"\"Certainly not. I don't know how the others were, except through sorcerers'stories handed down from generation to generation. And those stories portraythem as being quite bizarre.\"\"Do you mean monstrous?\"\"Not at all. They say that they were very likable but extremely scary. They weremore like unknown creatures. What makes mankind homogeneous is the fact that weare all luminous balls. And those sorcerers were no longer balls of energy butlines of energy that were trying to bend themselves into circles, which theycouldn't quite make.\"\"What finally happened to them, don Juan? Did they die?\"\"Sorcerers' stories say that because they had succeeded in stretching theirshapes, they had also succeeded in stretching the duration of theirconsciousness. So they are alive and conscious to this day. There are storiesabout their periodic appearances on the earth.\"\"What do you think of all this yourself, don Juan?\"\"It is too bizarre for me. I want freedom. Freedom to retain my awareness andyet disappear into the vastness. In my personal opinion, those old sorcererswere extravagant, obsessive, capricious men who got pinned down by their ownmachinations. [* machination- a crafty and involved plot to achieve your(usually sinister) ends]\"But don't let my personal feelings sway you. The old sorcerers' accomplishmentis unparalleled. If nothing else, they proved to us that man's potentials arenothing to sneeze at.\" Another topic of don Juan's explanations was the indispensability of energeticuniformity and cohesion for the purpose of perceiving. His contention was thatmankind perceives the world we know, in the terms we do, only because we shareenergetic uniformity and cohesion.He said that we automatically attain these two conditions of energy in thecourse of our rearing and that they are so taken for granted we do not realizetheir vital importance until we are faced with the possibility of perceivingworlds other than the world we know. At those moments, it becomes evident thatwe need a new appropriate energetic uniformity and cohesion to perceivecoherently and totally.I asked him what uniformity and cohesion were, and he explained that man'senergetic shape has uniformity in the sense that every human being on earth hasthe form of a ball or an egg. And the fact that man's energy holds itselftogether as a ball or an egg proves it has cohesion.He said that an example of a new uniformity and cohesion was the old sorcerers'energetic shape when it became a line: every one of them uniformly became a lineand cohesively remained a line. Uniformity and cohesion at a line levelpermitted those old sorcerers to perceive a homogeneous new world.\"How are uniformity and cohesion acquired?\" I asked.\"The key is the position of the assemblage point, or rather the fixation of theassemblage point,\" he said.He did not want to elaborate any further at that time, so I asked him if thoseold sorcerers could have reverted to being egglike. He replied that at one pointthey could have, but that they did not. And then the line cohesion set in andmade it impossible for them to go back.He believed that what really crystallized that line cohesion and prevented themfrom making the journey back was a matter of choice and greed. The scope of whatthose sorcerers were able to perceive and do as lines of energy wasastronomically greater than what an average man or any average sorcerer can door perceive.He explained that the human domain when one is an energy ball is whatever energyfilaments pass through the space within the ball's boundaries. Normally, weperceive not all the human domain but perhaps only one thousandth of it.He was of the opinion that, if we take this into consideration, the enormity ofwhat the old sorcerers did becomes apparent. They extended themselves into aline a thousand times the size of a man as an energy ball and perceived all theenergy filaments that passed through that line.On his insistence, I made giant efforts to understand the new model of energyconfiguration he was outlining for me. Finally, after much pounding, I couldfollow the idea of energy filaments inside the luminous ball and outside it. Butif I thought of a multitude of luminous balls, the model broke down in my mind.In a multitude of luminous balls, I reasoned, the energy filaments that areoutside one of them will perforce be inside the adjacent one. So in a multitudethere could not possibly be any energy filaments outside any luminous ball.\"To understand all this certainly isn't an exercise for your reason,\" he repliedafter carefully listening to my arguments. \"I have no way of explaining whatsorcerers mean by filaments inside and outside the human shape. When seers seethe human energy shape, they see one single ball of energy. If there is anotherball next to it, the other ball is seen again as a single ball of energy.\"The idea of a multitude of luminous balls comes from your knowledge of humancrowds. In the universe of energy, there are only single individuals, alone,surrounded by the boundless.\"You must see that for yourself!\" I argued with don Juan then that it was pointless to tell me to see it formyself when he knew I could not. And he proposed that I borrow his energy anduse it to see.\"How can I do that? Borrow your energy.\"\"Very simple. I can make your assemblage point shift to another position moresuitable to perceiving energy directly.\"This was the first time, in my memory, that he deliberately talked aboutsomething he had been doing all along: making me enter into someincomprehensible state of awareness that defied my idea of the world and ofmyself, a state he called the second attention.So, to make my assemblage point shift to a position more suitable to perceivingenergy directly, don Juan slapped my back, between my shoulder blades, with sucha force that he made me lose my breath. I thought that I must have fainted orthat the blow had made me fall asleep. Suddenly, I was looking or I was dreamingI was looking at something literally beyond words. Bright strings of light shotout from everywhere, going everywhere, strings of light which were like nothingthat had ever entered my thoughts.When I recovered my breath, or when I woke up, don Juan expectantly asked me,\"What did you see?\" And when I answered, truthfully, \"Your blow made me seestars,\" he doubled up laughing.He remarked that I was not ready yet to comprehend any unusual perception Imight have had.\"I made your assemblage point shift,\" he went on, \"and for an instant you weredreaming the filaments of the universe. But you don't yet have the discipline orthe energy to rearrange your uniformity and cohesion. The old sorcerers were theconsummate masters of that rearranging. That was how they saw everything thatcan be seen by man.\"\"What does it mean to rearrange uniformity and cohesion?\"\"It means to enter into the second attention by retaining the assemblage pointon its new position and keeping it from sliding back to its original spot.\"Don Juan then gave me a traditional definition of the second attention. He saidthat the old sorcerers called the result of fixing the assemblage point on newpositions the second attention and that they treated the second attention as anarea of all-inclusive activity, just as the attention of the daily world is.He pointed out that sorcerers really have two complete areas for theirendeavors: a small one, called the first attention or the awareness of our dailyworld or the fixation of the assemblage point on its habitual position; and amuch larger area, the second attention or the awareness of other worlds or thefixation of the assemblage point on each of an enormous number of new positions.Don Juan helped me to experience inexplicable things in the second attention bymeans of what he called a sorcerer's maneuver: tapping my back gently orforcefully striking it at the height of my shoulder blades. He explained thatwith his blows he displaced my assemblage point.From my experiential position, such displacements meant that my awareness usedto enter into a most disturbing state of unequaled clarity, a state of superconsciousness, which I enjoyed for short periods of time and in which I couldunderstand anything with minimal preambles. It was not quite a pleasing state.Most of the time it was like a strange dream, so intense that normal awarenesspaled by comparison.Don Juan justified the indispensability of such a maneuver, saying that innormal awareness a sorcerer teaches his apprentices basic concepts andprocedures and in the second attention he gives them abstract and detailedexplanations.Ordinarily, apprentices do not remember these explanations at all, yet theysomehow store them, faithfully intact, in their memories. Sorcerers have usedthis seeming peculiarity of memory and have turned remembering everything thathappens to them in the second attention into one of the most difficult andcomplex traditional tasks of sorcery.Sorcerers explain this seeming peculiarity of memory, and the task ofremembering, saying that every time anyone enters into the second attention, theassemblage point is on a different position. To remember, then, means torelocate the assemblage point on the exact position it occupied at the timethose entrances into the second attention occurred.Don Juan assured me not only that sorcerers have total and absolute recall butthat they relive every experience they had in the second attention by this actof returning their assemblage point to each of those specific positions. He alsoassured me that sorcerers dedicate a lifetime to fulfilling this task ofremembering.In the second attention, don Juan gave me very detailed explanations of sorceryknowing that the accuracy and fidelity of such instruction will remain with me,faithfully intact, for the duration of my life.About this quality of faithfulness he said, \"Learning something in the secondattention is just like learning when we were children. What we learn remainswith us for life. \"It's second nature with me,\" we say when it comes tosomething we've learned very early in life.\" Judging from where I stand today, I realize that don Juan made me enter, as manytimes as he could, into the second attention in order to force me to sustain,for long periods of time, new positions of my assemblage point and to perceivecoherently in them. That is to say, he aimed at forcing me to rearrange myuniformity and cohesion.I succeeded countless times in perceiving everything as precisely as I perceivein the daily world. My problem was my incapacity to make a bridge between myactions in the second attention and my awareness of the daily world. It took agreat deal of effort and time for me to understand what the second attention is.Not so much because of its intricacy and complexity, which are indeed extreme,but because, once I was back in my normal awareness, I found it impossible toremember not only that I had entered into the second attention but that such astate existed at all. Another monumental breakthrough that the old sorcerers claimed, and that donJuan carefully explained to me, was to find out that the assemblage pointbecomes very easily displaced during sleep.This realization triggered another one: that dreams are totally associated withthat displacement. The old sorcerers saw that the greater the displacement, themore unusual the dream. Or vice versa: the more unusual the dream, the greaterthe displacement.Don Juan said that this observation led them to devise extravagant techniques toforce the displacement of the assemblage point, such as ingesting plants thatcan produce altered states of consciousness; subjecting themselves to states ofhunger, fatigue, and stress; and especially controlling dreams. In this fashion,and perhaps without even knowing it, they created dreaming.One day, as we strolled around the plaza in the city of Oaxaca, don Juan gave methe most coherent definition of dreaming from a sorcerer's standpoint.\"Sorcerers view dreaming as an extremely sophisticated art,\" he said, \"the artof displacing the assemblage point at will from its habitual position in orderto enhance and enlarge the scope of what can be perceived.\"He said that the old sorcerers anchored the art of dreaming on five conditionsthey saw in the energy flow of human beings.One, they saw that only the energy filaments that pass directly through theassemblage point can be assembled into coherent perception.Two, they saw that if the assemblage point is displaced to another position, nomatter how minute the displacement, different and unaccustomed energy filamentsbegin to pass through it; engaging awareness and forcing the assembling of theseunaccustomed energy fields into a steady, coherent perception.Three, they saw that, in the course of ordinary dreams, the assemblage pointbecomes easily displaced by itself to another position on the surface or in theinterior of the luminous egg.Four, they saw that the assemblage point can be made to move to positionsoutside the luminous egg, into the energy filaments of the universe at large.And, five, they saw that through discipline it is possible to cultivate andperform, in the course of sleep and ordinary dreams, a systematic displacementof the assemblage point. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"2. The First Gate of DreamingAs a preamble [* preamble- a preliminary introduction] to his first lesson indreaming, don Juan talked about the second attention as a progression: beginningas an idea that comes to us more like a curiosity than an actual possibility;turning into something that can only be felt, as a sensation is felt; andfinally evolving into a state of being, or a realm of practicalities, or apreeminent force that opens for us worlds beyond our wildest fantasies.When explaining sorcery, sorcerers have two options. One is to speak inmetaphorical terms and talk about a world of magical dimensions. The other is toexplain their business in abstract terms proper to sorcery. I have alwayspreferred the latter, although neither option will ever satisfy the rationalmind of a Western man.Don Juan told me that what he meant by his 'metaphorical description of thesecond attention as a progression' was that, being a by-product of adisplacement of the assemblage point, the second attention does not happennaturally but must be intended; beginning with intending it as an idea andending up with intending it as a steady and controlled awareness of theassemblage point's displacement.\"I am going to teach you the first step to power,\" don Juan said, beginning hisinstruction in the art of dreaming. \"I'm going to teach you how to set updreaming.\"\"What does it mean to set up dreaming?\"\"To set up dreaming means to have a precise and practical command over thegeneral situation of a dream. For example, you may dream that you are in yourclassroom. To set up dreaming means that you don't let the dream slip intosomething else. You don't jump from the classroom to the mountains, forinstance. In other words, you control the view of the classroom and don't let itgo until you want to.\"\"But is it possible to do that?\"\"Of course it's possible. This control is no different from the control we haveover any situation in our daily lives. Sorcerers are used to it, and get itevery time they want or need to. In order to get used to it yourself, you muststart by doing something very simple. Tonight, in your dreams, you must look atyour hands.\"Not much more was said about this in the awareness of our daily world. In myrecollection of my experiences in the second attention, however, I found outthat we had a more extensive exchange. For instance, I expressed my feelingsabout the absurdity of the task, and don Juan suggested that I should face it interms of a quest that was entertaining, instead of solemn and morbid.\"Get as heavy as you want when we talk about dreaming,\" he said. \"Explanationsalways call for deep thought. But when you actually dream, be as light as afeather. Dreaming has to be performed with integrity and seriousness, but in themidst of laughter and with the confidence of someone who doesn't have a worry inthe world. Only under these conditions can our dreams actually be turned intodreaming.\"Don Juan assured me that he had selected my hands arbitrarily as something tolook for in my dreams and that looking for anything else was just as valid. Thegoal of the exercise was not finding a specific thing but engaging my dreamingattention.Don Juan described the dreaming attention as the control one acquires over one'sdreams upon fixating the assemblage point on any new position to which it hasbeen displaced during dreams. In more general terms, he called the dreamingattention an incomprehensible facet of awareness that exists by itself waitingfor a moment when we would entice it; a moment when we would give it purpose. Itis a veiled faculty that every one of us has in reserve but that we never havethe opportunity to use in everyday life.My first attempts at looking for my hands in my dreams were a fiasco. Aftermonths of unsuccessful efforts, I gave up and complained to don Juan again aboutthe absurdity of such a task.\"There are seven gates,\" he said as a way of answering, \"and dreamers have toopen all seven of them; one at the time. You're up against the first gate thatmust be opened if you are to dream.\"\"Why didn't you tell me this before?\"\"It would've been useless to tell you about the gates of dreaming before yousmacked your head against the first one. Now you know that it is an obstacle andthat you have to overcome it.\"Don Juan explained that there are entrances and exits in the energy flow of theuniverse and that, in the specific case of dreaming, there are seven entrancesexperienced as obstacles; which sorcerers call the seven gates of dreaming.\"The first gate is a threshold we must cross by becoming aware of a particularsensation before deep sleep,\" he said. \"A sensation which is like a pleasantheaviness that doesn't let us open our eyes. We reach that gate the instant webecome aware that we're falling asleep; suspended in darkness and heaviness.\"\"How do I become aware that I am falling asleep? Are there any steps to follow?\"\"No. There are no steps to follow. One just intends to become aware of fallingasleep.\"\"But how does one intend to become aware of it?\"\"Intent or intending is something very difficult to talk about. I or anyone elsewould sound idiotic trying to explain it. Bear that in mind when you hear what Ihave to say next: Sorcerers intend anything they set themselves to intend,simply by intending it.\"\"That doesn't mean anything, don Juan.\"\"Pay close attention. Someday it'll be your turn to explain. The statement seemsnonsensical because you are not putting it in the proper context. Like anyrational man, you think that understanding is exclusively the realm of ourreason; of our mind.\"For sorcerers, because the statement I made pertains to intent and intending,understanding it pertains to the realm of energy. Sorcerers believe that if onewould intend that statement for the energy body, the energy body wouldunderstand it in terms entirely different from those of the mind. The trick isto reach the energy body. For that you need energy.\"\"In what terms would the energy body understand that statement, don Juan?\"\"In terms of a bodily feeling which is hard to describe. You'll have toexperience it to know what I mean.\"I wanted a more precise explanation, but don Juan slapped my back and made meenter into the second attention. At that time, what he did was still utterlymysterious to me. I could have sworn that his touch hypnotized me.I believed he had instantaneously put me to sleep, and I dreamt that I foundmyself walking with him on a wide avenue lined with trees in some unknown city.It was such a vivid dream, and I was so aware of everything that I immediatelytried to orient myself by reading signs and looking at people. It definitely wasnot any English- or Spanish-speaking city, but it was a Western city. The peopleseemed to be northern Europeans, perhaps Lithuanians. I became absorbed intrying to read billboards and street signs.Don Juan nudged me gently. \"Don't bother with that,\" he said. \"We are nowhereidentifiable. I've just lent you my energy so you would reach your energy body,and with it you've just crossed into another world. This won't last long, so useyour time wisely.\"Look at everything, but without being obvious. Don't let anyone notice you.\"We walked in silence. It was a block-long walk which had a remarkable effect onme. The more we walked, the greater my sensation of visceral anxiety. My mindwas curious, but my body was alarmed. I had the clearest understanding that Iwas not in this world.When we got to an intersection and stopped walking, I saw that the trees on thestreet had been carefully trimmed. They were short trees with hard-looking,curled leaves. Each tree had a big square space for watering. There were noweeds or trash in those spaces, as one would find around trees in the city, onlycharcoal black, loose dirt.The moment I focused my eyes on the curb, before I stepped off it to cross thestreet, I noticed that there were no cars. I tried desperately to watch thepeople who milled around us; to discover something about them that would explainmy anxiety. As I stared at them, they stared back at me. In one instant a circleof hard blue and brown eyes had formed around us.A certainty hit me like a blow: This was not a dream at all. We were in areality beyond what I know to be real. I turned to face don Juan. I was about torealize what was different about those people, but a strange dry wind that wentdirectly to my sinuses hit my face, blurred my view, and made me forget what Iwanted to tell don Juan.The next instant, I was back where I had started from: don Juan's house. I waslying on a straw mat, curled up on my side.\"I lent you my energy, and you reached your energy body,\" don Juan saidmatter-of-factly.I heard him talk, but I was numb. An unusual itching on my solar plexus kept mybreaths short and painful. I knew that I had been on the verge of findingsomething transcendental about dreaming and about the people I had seen, yet Icould not bring whatever I knew into focus.\"Where were we, don Juan?\" I asked. \"Was it all a dream? A hypnotic state?\"\"It wasn't a dream,\" he replied. \"It was dreaming. I helped you reach the secondattention so that you would understand intending as a subject not for yourreason but for your energy body.\"At this point, you can't yet comprehend the importance of all this; not onlybecause you don't have sufficient energy, but because you're not intendinganything. If you were, your energy body would comprehend immediately that theonly way to intend is by focusing your intent on whatever you want to intend.This time I focused it for you on reaching your energy body.\"\"Is the goal of dreaming to intend the energy body?\" I asked, suddenly empoweredby some strange reasoning.\"One can certainly put it that way,\" he said. \"In this particular instance,since we're talking about the first gate of dreaming, the goal of dreaming is tointend that your energy body becomes aware that you are falling asleep. Don'ttry to force yourself to be aware of falling asleep. Let your energy body do it.To intend is to wish without wishing, to do without doing.\"Accept the challenge of intending,\" he went on. \"Put your silent determinationwithout a single thought into convincing yourself that you have reached yourenergy body, and that you are a dreamer. Doing this will automatically put youin the position to be aware that you are falling asleep.\"\"How can I convince myself that I am a dreamer when I am not?\"\"When you hear that you have to convince yourself, you automatically become morerational. How can you convince yourself you are a dreamer when you know you arenot? Intending is both: the act of convincing yourself you are indeed a dreamer,although you have never dreamt before; and the act of being convinced.\"\"Do you mean I have to tell myself I am a dreamer and try my best to believe it?Is that it?\"\"No, it isn't. Intending is much simpler and, at the same time, infinitely morecomplex than that. It requires imagination, discipline, and purpose. In thiscase, to intend means that you get an unquestionable bodily knowledge that youare a dreamer. You feel you are a dreamer with all the cells of your body.\"Don Juan added in a joking tone that he did not have sufficient energy to makeme another loan for intending, and that the thing I should do was reach myenergy body on my own. He assured me that intending the first gate of dreamingwas one of the means discovered by the sorcerers of antiquity for reaching thesecond attention and the energy body.After telling me this, he practically threw me out of his house; commanding menot to come back until I had intended the first gate of dreaming.I returned home, and every night for months I went to sleep intending with allmy might to become aware that I was falling asleep and to see my hands in mydreams. The other part of the task, to convince myself that I was a dreamer andthat I had reached my energy body, was totally impossible for me.Then, one afternoon while taking a nap, I dreamt I was looking at my hands. Theshock was enough to wake me up. It proved to be a unique dream that could not berepeated. Weeks went by, and I was unable either to become aware that I wasfalling asleep or to find my hands. I began to notice, however, that I washaving in my dreams a vague feeling that there was something I should have beendoing but could not remember. This feeling became so strong that it kept onwaking me up at all hours of the night.When I told don Juan about my futile attempts to cross the first gate ofdreaming, he gave me some guidelines.\"To ask a dreamer to find a determined item in his dreams is a subterfuge,\" hesaid. \"The real issue is to become aware that one is falling asleep. And,strange as it may seem, that doesn't happen by commanding oneself to be awarethat one is falling asleep, but by sustaining the sight of whatever one islooking at in a dream.\"He told me that dreamers take quick, deliberate glances at everything present ina dream. If they focus their dreaming attention on something specific, it isonly as a point of departure. From there, dreamers move on to look at otheritems in the dream's content; returning to the point of departure as many timesas possible.After a great effort, I indeed found hands in my dreams, but they never weremine. They were hands that only seemed to belong to me, hands that changedshape, becoming quite nightmarish at times. The rest of my dreams' content,nonetheless, was always pleasantly steady. I could almost sustain the view ofanything I focused my attention on.It went on like this for months until one day when my capacity to dream changedseemingly by itself. I had done nothing special besides my constant earnestdetermination to be aware that I was falling asleep and to find my hands.I dreamt I was visiting my hometown. Not that the town I was dreaming aboutlooked at all like my hometown, but somehow I had the conviction that it was theplace where I was born. It all began as an ordinary, yet very vivid dream. Thenthe light in the dream changed. Images became sharper. The street where I waswalking became noticeably more real than a moment before. My feet began to hurt.I could feel that things were absurdly hard. For instance, on bumping into adoor, not only did I experience pain on the knee that hit the door, but I wasalso enraged by my clumsiness.I realistically walked in that town until I was completely exhausted. I saweverything I could have seen had I been a tourist walking through the streets ofa city. There was no difference whatsoever between that dream walk and any walkI had actually taken on the streets of a city I visited for the first time.\"I think you went a bit too far,\" don Juan said after listening to my account.\"All that was required was your awareness of falling asleep. What you've done isequivalent to bringing a wall down just to squash a mosquito sitting on it.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that I flubbed it?\"\"No. But apparently you're trying to repeat something you did before. When Imade your assemblage point shift, and you and I ended up in that mysteriouscity, you were not asleep. You were dreaming, but not asleep; meaning that yourassemblage point didn't reach that position through a normal dream. I forced itto shift.\"You certainly can reach the same position through dreaming, but I wouldn'tadvise you to do that at this time.\"\"Is it dangerous?\"\"And how! Dreaming has to be a very sober affair. No false movement can beafforded. Dreaming is a process of awakening, of gaining control. Our dreamingattention must be systematically exercised because it is a door to the secondattention.\"\"What's the difference between the dreaming attention and the second attention?\"\"The second attention is like an ocean, and the dreaming attention is like ariver feeding into it. The second attention is the condition of being aware oftotal worlds, total like our world is total, while the dreaming attention is thecondition of being aware of the items of our dreams.\"He heavily stressed that the dreaming attention is the key to every movement inthe sorcerers' world. He said that among the multitude of items in our dreams,there exist real energetic interferencesl; things that have been put in ourdreams extraneously by an alien force. To be able to find them and follow themis sorcery.The emphasis he put on those statements was so pronounced that I had to ask himto explain them. He hesitated for a moment before answering.\"Dreams are, if not a door, a hatch into other worlds,\" he began. \"As such,dreams are a two-way street. Our awareness goes through that hatch into otherrealms, and those other realms send scouts into our dreams.\"\"What are those scouts?\"\"Energy charges that get mixed with the items of our normal dreams. They arebursts of foreign energy that come into our dreams, and we interpret them asitems familiar or unfamiliar to us.\"\"I am sorry, don Juan, but I can't make heads or tails out of your explanation.\"\"You can't because you're insisting on thinking about dreams in terms known toyou; as what occurs to us during normal sleep.\"And I am insisting on giving you another version: a hatch into other realms ofperception. Through that hatch, currents of unfamiliar energy seep in. Then themind or the brain or whatever takes those currents of energy and turns them intoparts of our dreams.\"He paused, obviously to give my mind time to take in what he was telling me.\"Sorcerers are aware of those currents of foreign energy,\" he continued. \"Theynotice them and strive to isolate them from the normal items of their dreams.\"\"Why do they isolate them, don Juan?\"\"Because they come from other realms. If we follow them to their source, theyserve us as guides into areas of such mystery that sorcerers shiver at the meremention of such a possibility.\"\"How do sorcerers isolate them from the normal items of their dreams?\"\"By the exercise and control of their dreaming attention. At one moment, ourdreaming attention discovers them among the items of a dream and focuses onthem. Then the total dream collapses; leaving only the foreign energy.\"Don Juan refused to explain the topic any further. He went back to discussing mydreaming experience and said that, all in all, he had to take my dream as beingmy first genuine attempt at dreaming; and that this meant I had succeeded inreaching the first gate of dreaming. During another discussion at a different time, he abruptly brought up thesubject again. He said, \"I'm going to repeat what you must do in your dreams inorder to pass the first gate of dreaming.\"First you must focus your gaze on anything of your choice as the startingpoint. Then shift your gaze to other items and look at them in brief glances.Focus your gaze on as many things as you can. Remember that if you glance onlybriefly, the images don't shift. Then go back to the item you first looked at.\"\"What does it mean to pass the first gate of dreaming?\"\"We reach the first gate of dreaming by becoming aware that we are fallingasleep, or by having, like you did, a gigantically real dream. Once we reach thegate, we must cross it by being able to sustain the sight of any item of ourdreams.\"\"I can almost look steadily at the items of my dreams, but they dissipate tooquickly.\"\"This is precisely what I am trying to tell you. In order to offset theevanescent [* evanescent- tending to vanish like vapour] quality of dreams,sorcerers have devised the use of the starting point item.\"Every time you isolate it and look at it, you get a surge of energy, so at thebeginning don't look at too many things in your dreams. Four items will suffice.Later on, you may enlarge the scope until you can cover all you want; but assoon as the images begin to shift and you feel you are losing control, go backto your starting point item and start all over again.\"\"Do you believe that I really reached the first gate of dreaming, don Juan?\"\"You did, and that's a lot. You'll find out, as you go along, how easy it'll beto do dreaming now.\"I thought don Juan was either exaggerating or giving me incentive. But heassured me he was being on the level.\"The most astounding thing that happens to dreamers,\" he said, \"is that onreaching the first gate, they also reach the energy body.\"\"What exactly is the energy body?\"\"It's the counterpart of the physical body. A ghostlike configuration made ofpure energy.\"\"But isn't the physical body also made out of energy?\"\"Of course it is. The difference is that the energy body has only appearance butno mass. Since it's pure energy, it can perform acts that are beyond thepossibilities of the physical body.\"\"Such as what for example, don Juan?\"\"Such as transporting itself in one instant to the ends of the universe. Anddreaming is the art of tempering the energy body; of making it supple andcoherent by gradually exercising it.\"Through dreaming, we condense the energy body until it's a unit capable ofperceiving. Its perception, although affected by our normal way of perceivingthe daily world, is an independent perception. It has its own sphere.\"\"What is that sphere, don Juan?\"\"Energy. The energy body deals with energy in terms of energy. There are threeways in which it deals with energy in dreaming: it can perceive energy as itflows; or it can use energy to boost itself like a rocket into unexpected areas;or it can perceive as we ordinarily perceive the world.\"\"What does it mean to perceive energy as it flows?\"\"It means to 'see'. It means that the energy body sees energy directly as alight; or as a vibrating current of sorts; or as a disturbance. Or it feels itdirectly as a jolt, or as a sensation that can even be pain.\"\"What about the other way you talked about, don Juan? The energy body usingenergy as a boost.\"\"Since energy is its sphere, it is no problem for the energy body to usecurrents of energy that exist in the universe to propel itself. All it has to dois isolate them, and off it goes with them.\"He stopped talking and seemed to be undecided as if he wanted to add something,but was not sure about it. He smiled at me, and just as I was beginning to askhim a question, he continued his explanation.\"I've mentioned to you before that sorcerers isolate in their dreams scouts fromother realms,\" he said. \"Their energy bodies do that. They recognize energy andgo for it. But it isn't desirable for dreamers to indulge in searching forscouts. I was reluctant to tell you about it because of the facility with whichone can get swayed by that search.\"Don Juan then quickly went on to another subject. He carefully outlined for mean entire block of practices. At the time, I found that on one level it was allincomprehensible to me. Yet on another level it was perfectly logical andunderstandable.He reiterated that reaching with deliberate control the first gate of dreamingis a way of arriving at the energy body. But to maintain that gain is predicatedon energy alone. Sorcerers get that energy by redeploying, in a more intelligentmanner, the energy they have and use for perceiving the daily world.When I urged don Juan to explain it more clearly, he added that we all have adetermined quantity of basic energy. That quantity is all the energy we have,and we normally use all of it for perceiving and dealing with our engulfingworld.He repeated various times, to emphasize it, that there is no more energy for usanywhere. And since our available energy is already engaged, there is not asingle bit left in us for any extraordinary perception; such as dreaming.\"Where does that leave us?\" I asked.\"It leaves us to scrounge energy for ourselves wherever we can find it,\" hereplied.Don Juan explained that sorcerers have a scrounging method. They intelligentlyredeploy their energy by cutting down anything they consider superfluous [*superfluous- serving no useful purpose; having no excuse for being] in theirlives. They call this method the sorcerers' way. In essence, the sorcerers' way,as don Juan put it, is a chain of behavioral choices for dealing with the world;choices much more intelligent than those our progenitors [* progenitor- anancestor in the direct line] taught us. These sorcerers' choices are designed torevamp our lives by altering our basic reactions about being alive.\"What are those basic reactions?\" I asked.\"There are two ways of facing our being alive,\" he said. \"One is to surrender toit, either by acquiescing to its demands or by fighting those demands. The otheris by molding our particular life situation to fit our own configurations.\"\"Can we really mold our life situation, don Juan?\"\"One's particular life situation can be molded to fit one's specifications,\" donJuan insisted. \"Dreamers do that. A wild statement? Not really, if you considerhow little we know about ourselves.\"He said that his interest as a teacher was to get me thoroughly involved withthe themes of life and being alive- that is to say, with the difference betweenlife, as a consequence of biological forces; and the act of being alive, as amatter of cognition.\"When sorcerers talk about molding one's life situation,\" don Juan explained,\"they mean molding the awareness of being alive. Through molding this awareness,we can get enough energy to reach and sustain the energy body, and with it wecan certainly mold the total direction and consequences of our lives.\"Don Juan ended our conversation about dreaming by admonishing [* admonishing-counsel in terms of someone's behaviour] me not merely to think about what hehad told me, but to turn his concepts into a viable way of life by a process ofrepetition.He claimed that everything new in our lives, such as the sorcerers' concepts hewas teaching me, must be repeated to us to the point of exhaustion before weopen ourselves to it. He pointed out that repetition is the way our progenitorssocialized us to function in the daily world. As I continued my dreaming practices, I gained the capability of beingthoroughly aware that I was falling asleep, as well as the capability ofstopping in a dream to examine at will anything that was part of that dream'scontent. To experience this was for me no less than miraculous.Don Juan stated that as we tighten the control over our dreams, we tighten themastery over our dreaming attention. He was right in saying that the dreamingattention comes into play when it is called; when it is given a purpose.Its coming into play is not really a process as one would normally understand aprocess as an ongoing system of operations, or a series of actions or functionsthat bring about an end result.The dreaming attention is rather an awakening. Something dormant becomessuddenly functional. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"3. The Second Gate of DreamingI found out by means of my dreaming practices that a dreaming teacher mustcreate a didactic [* didactic- instructive (especially excessively)] synthesisin order to emphasize a given point. In essence, what don Juan wanted with myfirst dreaming task was to exercise my dreaming attention by focusing it on theitems of my dreams.To this effect he used as a spearhead the idea of being aware of falling asleep.His subterfuge was to say that the only way to be aware of falling asleep is toexamine the elements of one's dreams.I realized, almost as soon as I had begun my dreaming practices, that exercisingthe dreaming attention is the essential point in dreaming. To the mind, however,it seems impossible that one can train oneself to be aware at the level ofdreams.Don Juan said that the active element of such training is persistence; and thatthe mind and all its rational defenses cannot cope with persistence. Sooner orlater, he said, the mind's barriers fall under persistence's impact, and thedreaming attention blooms.As I practiced focusing and holding my dreaming attention on the items of mydreams, I began to feel a peculiar self-confidence so remarkable that I sought acomment from don Juan. \"It is your entering into the second attention that gives you that sense ofself-assurance,\" he said. \"This calls for even more sobriety on your part. Goslowly, but don't stop; and above all, don't talk about it. Just do it!\"I told him that in practice I had corroborated what he had already told me; thatif one takes short glances at everything in a dream, the images do not dissolve.I commented that the difficult part is to break the initial barrier thatprevents us from bringing dreams to our conscious attention.I asked don Juan to give me his opinion on this matter because I earnestlybelieved that this barrier is a psychological one created by our socialization;a barrier which puts a premium on disregarding dreams.\"The barrier is more than socialization,\" he replied. \"It's the first gate ofdreaming. Now that you've overcome it, it seems stupid to you that we can't stopat will and pay attention to the items of our dreams. That's a false certainty.The first gate of dreaming has to do with the flow of energy in the universe.It's a natural obstacle.\"Don Juan made me agree then that we would talk about dreaming only in the secondattention and as he saw fit. He encouraged me to practice in the meantime; andhe promised me no interference on his part. As I gained proficiency in setting up dreaming, I repeatedly experiencedsensations that I deemed of great importance, such as the feeling that I wasrolling into a ditch just as I was falling asleep. Don Juan never told me thatthey were nonsensical sensations but let me record them in my notes.I realize now how absurd I must have appeared to him. Today, if I were teachingdreaming, I would definitely discourage such a behavior. Don Juan merely madefun of me, calling me a covert egomaniac who professed to be fightingself-importance yet kept a meticulous, superpersonal diary called 'My Dreams'.Every time he had an opportunity, don Juan pointed out that the energy needed torelease our dreaming attention from its socialization prison comes fromredeploying our existing energy. Nothing could have been truer.The emergence of our dreaming attention is a direct corollary [* corollary- apractical consequence that follows naturally] of revamping our lives. Since wehave, as don Juan said, no way to plug-into any external source for a boost ofenergy, we must redeploy our existing energy by any means available.Don Juan insisted that the sorcerers' way is the best means to oil, so to speak,the wheels of energy redeployment; and that of all the items in the sorcerers'way, the most effective is 'losing self-importance'.He was thoroughly convinced that losing self-importance is indispensable foreverything sorcerers do. For this reason, he put an enormous emphasis on guidingall his students to fulfill this requirement. He was of the opinion thatself-importance is not only the sorcerers' supreme enemy, but the nemesis ofmankind.Don Juan's argument was that most of our energy goes into upholding ourimportance. This is most obvious in our endless worry about the presentation ofthe self; about whether or not we are admired or liked or acknowledged.He reasoned that if we were capable of losing some of that importance, twoextraordinary things would happen to us. One, we would free our energy fromtrying to maintain the illusory idea of our grandeur; and, two, we would provideourselves with enough energy to enter into the second attention to catch aglimpse of the actual grandeur of the universe. It took me more than two years to be able to focus my unwavering dreamingattention on anything I wanted. I became so proficient that I felt as if I hadbeen doing it all my life. The eeriest part was that I could not conceive of nothaving had that ability.Yet I could remember how difficult it had been even to think of this as apossibility. It occurred to me that the capability of examining the contents ofone's dreams must be the product of a natural configuration of our being;similar perhaps to our capability of walking. We are physically conditioned towalk only in one manner, bipedally, yet it takes a monumental effort for us tolearn to walk.This new capacity of looking in glances at the items of my dreams was coupledwith a most insistent nagging to remind myself to look at the elements of mydreams. I knew about my compulsive bent of character, but in my dreams mycompulsiveness was vastly augmented. It became so noticeable that not only did Iresent hearing my nagging at myself, but I also began to question whether it wasreally my compulsiveness or something else. I even thought I was losing my mind.\"I talk to myself endlessly in my dreams; reminding myself to look at things,\" Isaid to don Juan.I had all along respected our agreement that we would talk about dreaming onlywhen he brought up the subject. However, I thought that this was an emergency.\"Does it sound to you like it's not you but someone else?\" he asked.\"Come to think of it, yes. I don't sound like myself at those times.\"\"Then it's not you. It's not time yet to explain it. But let's say that we arenot alone in this world. Let's say that there are other worlds available todreamers; total worlds.\"From those other total worlds, energetic entities sometimes come to us. Thenext time you hear yourself nagging at yourself in your dreams, get really angryand yell a command. Say, Stop it!\"I entered into another challenging arena: to remember in my dreams to shout thatcommand. I believe that, perhaps, out of being so tremendously annoyed athearing myself nagging, I did remember to shout, \"Stop it.\" The nagging ceasedinstantly, and never again was repeated.\"Does every dreamer experience this?\" I asked don Juan when I saw him again.\"Some do,\" he answered, uninterestedly.I began to rant about how strange it had all been. He cut me off, saying, \"Youare ready now to get to the second gate of dreaming.\"I seized the opportunity to seek answers for questions I had not been able toask him. What I had experienced the first time he made me dream had beenforemost in my mind. I told don Juan that I had observed the elements of my owndreams to my heart's content, and never had I felt anything even vaguely similarin terms of clarity and detail.\"The more I think about it,\" I said, \"the more intriguing it becomes. Watchingthose people in that dream, I experienced a fear and revulsion impossible toforget. What was that feeling, don Juan?\"\"In my opinion, your energy body hooked onto the foreign energy of that placeand had the time of its life. Naturally, you felt afraid and revolted. You wereexamining alien energy for the first time in your life.\"You have a proclivity for behaving like the sorcerers of antiquity. The momentyou have the chance, you let your assemblage point go. That time your assemblagepoint shifted quite a distance. The result was that you, like the old sorcerers,journeyed beyond the world we know. A most real but dangerous journey.\"I bypassed the meaning of his statements in favor of my own interest and askedhim, \"Was that city perhaps on another planet?\"\"You can't explain dreaming by way of things you know or suspect you know,\" hesaid. \"All I can tell you is that the city you visited was not in this world.\"\"Where was it, then?\"\"Out of this world, of course. You're not that stupid. That was the first thingyou noticed. What got you going in circles is that you can't imagine anythingbeing out of this world.\"\"Where is out of this world, don Juan?\"\"Believe me, the most extravagant feature of sorcery is that configurationcalled 'out of this world'. For instance, you assumed that I was seeing the samethings you did. The proof is that you never asked me what I saw. You and onlyyou saw a city and people in that city. I didn't see anything of the sort. I sawenergy. So, out of this world was for you alone, on that occasion, a city.\"\"But then, don Juan, it wasn't a real city. It existed only for me in my mind.\"\"No. That's not the case. Now you want to reduce something transcendental [*transcendental- existing outside of or not in accordance with nature] tosomething mundane. [* mundane- found in the ordinary course of events] You can'tdo that. That journey was real. You saw it as a city. I saw it as energy.Neither of us is right or wrong.\"\"My confusion comes when you talk about things being real. You said before thatwe reached a real place. But if it was real, how can we have two versions ofit?\"\"Very simple. We have two versions because we had, at that time, two differentrates of uniformity and cohesion. I have explained to you that those twoattributes are the key to perceiving.\"\"Do you think that I can go back to that particular city?\"\"You got me there. I don't know. Or perhaps I do know but can't explain it. Orperhaps I can explain it but I don't want to. You'll have to wait and figure outfor yourself which is the case.\"He refused any further discussion. \"Let's get on with our business,\" he said. \"You reach the second gate ofdreaming when you wake up from a dream into another dream. You can have as manydreams as you want or as many as you are capable of, but you must exerciseadequate control and not wake up in the world we know.\"I had a jolt of panic. \"Are you saying that I should never wake up in thisworld?\" I asked.\"No, I didn't mean that. But now that you have pointed it out, I have to tellyou that it is an alternative. The sorcerers of antiquity used to do that; neverwake up in the world we know. Some of the sorcerers of my line have done it too.It certainly can be done, but I don't recommend it. What I want is for you towake up naturally when you are through with dreaming. But while you aredreaming, I want you to dream that you wake up in another dream.\"I heard myself asking the same question I had asked the first time he told meabout setting up dreaming. \"But is it possible to do that?\"Don Juan obviously caught on to my mindlessness and laughingly repeated theanswer he had given me before. \"Of course it's possible. This control is nodifferent from the control we have over any situation in our daily lives.\"I quickly got over my embarrassment and was ready to ask more questions. DonJuan anticipated me, and began to explain facets of the second gate of dreaming;an explanation that made me yet more uneasy.\"There's one problem with the second gate,\" he said. \"It's a problem that can beserious- depending on one's bent of character. If our tendency is to indulge inclinging to things or situations, we are in for a sock in the jaw.\"\"In what way, don Juan?\"\"Think for a moment. You've already experienced the outlandish joy of examiningyour dreams' contents. Imagine yourself going from dream to dream; watchingeverything; examining every detail. It's very easy to realize that one may sinkto mortal depths. Especially if one is given to indulging.\"\"Wouldn't the body or the brain naturally put a stop to it?\"\"If it's a natural sleeping situation, meaning normal, yes. But this is not anormal situation. This is dreaming. A dreamer on crossing the first gate hasalready reached the energy body. So what is really going through the secondgate, hopping from dream to dream, is the energy body.\"\"What's the implication of all this, don Juan?\"\"The implication is that on crossing the second gate you must intend a greaterand more sober control over your dreaming attention; the only safety valve fordreamers.\"\"What is this safety valve?\"\"You will find out for yourself that the true goal of dreaming is to perfect theenergy body. A perfect energy body, among other things of course, has such acontrol over the dreaming attention that it makes it stop when needed. This isthe safety valve dreamers have. No matter how indulging they might be, at agiven time, their dreaming attention must make them surface.\" I started all over again on another dreaming quest. This time the goal was moreelusive; and the difficulty even greater. Exactly as with my first task, I couldnot begin to figure out what to do. I had the discouraging suspicion that all mypractice was not going to be of much help this time. After countless failures, Igave up and settled down to simply continue my practice of fixing my dreamingattention on every item of my dreams. Accepting my shortcomings seemed to giveme a boost, and I became even more adept at sustaining the view of any item inmy dreams.A year went by without any change. Then one day something changed. As I waswatching a window in a dream- trying to find out if I could catch a glimpse ofthe scenery outside the room- some windlike force, which I felt as a buzzing inmy ears, pulled me through the window to the outside.Just before that pull, my dreaming attention had been caught by a strangestructure some distance away. It looked like a tractor. The next thing I knew, Iwas standing by it; examining it.I was perfectly aware that I was dreaming. I looked around to find out if Icould tell from what window I had been looking. The scene was that of a farm inthe countryside. No buildings were in sight. I wanted to ponder this. However,the quantity of farm machinery lying around, as if abandoned, took all myattention.I examined mowing machines, tractors, grain harvesters, disk plows, thrashers.There were so many that I forgot my original dream. What I wanted then was toorient myself by watching the immediate scenery. There was something in thedistance that looked like a billboard and some telephone poles around it.The instant I focused my attention on that billboard, I was next to it. Thesteel structure of the billboard gave me a fright. It was menacing. On thebillboard itself was a picture of a building. I read the text. It was anadvertisement for a motel. I had a peculiar certainty that I was in Oregon ornorthern California.I looked for other features in the environment of my dream. I saw mountains veryfar away and some green, round hills not too far. On those hills were clumps ofwhat I thought were California oak trees. I wanted to be pulled by the greenhills, but what pulled me were the distant mountains. I was convinced that theywere the Sierras.All my dreaming energy left me on those mountains. But before it did, I waspulled by every possible feature. My dream ceased to be a dream. As far as mycapacity to perceive was concerned, I was veritably in the Sierras, zooming intoravines, boulders, trees, caves. I went from scarp faces to mountain peaks untilI had no more drive and could not focus my dreaming attention on anything. Ifelt myself losing control. Finally, there was no more scenery, just darkness. \"You have reached the second gate of dreaming,\" don Juan said when I narrated mydream to him. \"What you should do next is to cross it. Crossing the second gateis a very serious affair. It requires a most disciplined effort.\"I was not sure I had fulfilled the task he outlined for me because I had notreally woken up in another dream. I asked don Juan about this irregularity.\"The mistake was mine,\" he said. \"I told you that one has to wake up in anotherdream, but what I meant is that one has to change dreams in an orderly andprecise manner, the way you have done it.\"With the first gate, you wasted a lot of time looking exclusively for yourhands. This time, you went directly to the solution without bothering to followthe given command of waking up in another dream.\"Don Juan said that there are two ways of properly crossing the second gate ofdreaming.One is to wake up in another dream, that is to say, to dream that one is havinga dream, and then dream that one wakes up from it.The alternative is to use the items of a dream to trigger another dream; exactlyas I had done.Just as he had been doing all along, don Juan let me practice without anyinterference on his part; and I corroborated the two alternatives he described.Either I dreamt that I was having a dream from which I dreamt I woke up, or Izoomed from a definite item accessible to my immediate dreaming attention toanother one not quite accessible.Or I entered into a slight variation of the second: I gazed at any item of adream, maintaining the gaze until the item changed shape, and by changing shapeit pulled me into another dream through a buzzing vortex. Never was I capable,however, of deciding beforehand which of the three I would follow.My dreaming practices always ended by my running out of dreaming attention, andby my finally waking up, or by my falling into dark, deep slumber.Everything went smoothly in my practices. The only disturbance I had was apeculiar interference; a jolt of fear or discomfort I had begun to experiencewith increasing frequency.My way of discarding it was to believe that it was related to my ghastly eatinghabits; or to the fact that, in those days, don Juan was giving me a profusionof hallucinogenic plants as part of my training. Those jolts became soprominent, however, that I had to ask don Juan's advice.\"You have entered now into the most dangerous facet of the sorcerers'knowledge,\" he began. \"It is sheer dread; a veritable nightmare. I could jokewith you and say that I didn't mention this possibility to you out of regard foryour cherished rationality, but I can't. Every sorcerer has to face it. Here iswhere, I fear, you might very well think you're going off the deep end.\"Don Juan very solemnly explained that life and consciousness, being exclusivelya matter of energy, are not solely the property of organisms. He said thatsorcerers have seen that there are two types of conscious beings roaming theearth: the organic and the inorganic.In comparing one with the other, sorcerers have seen that both are luminousmasses crossed from every imaginable angle by millions of the universe's energyfilaments. They are different from each other in their shape and in their degreeof brightness.Inorganic beings are long and candlelike but opaque; whereas organic beings areround and by far the brighter. Another noteworthy difference, which don Juansaid sorcerers have seen, is that the life and consciousness of organic beingsis short-lived because they are made to hurry; whereas the life of inorganicbeings is infinitely longer, and their consciousness infinitely more calm anddeeper.\"Sorcerers find no problem interacting with them,\" don Juan went on. \"Inorganicbeings possess the crucial ingredient for interaction; consciousness.\"\"But do these inorganic beings really exist? Like you and I exist?\" I asked.\"Of course they do,\" he replied. \"Believe me, sorcerers are very intelligentcreatures. Under no condition would they toy with aberrations of the mind, andthen take them for real.\"\"Why do you say they are alive?\"\"For sorcerers, having life means having consciousness. It means having anassemblage point and its surrounding glow of awareness; a condition that pointsout to sorcerers that the being in front of them, organic or inorganic, isthoroughly capable of perceiving. Perceiving is understood by sorcerers as theprecondition of being alive.\"\"Then the inorganic beings must also die. Is that true, don Juan?\"\"Naturally. They lose their awareness just like we do, except that the length oftheir consciousness is staggering to the mind.\"\"Do these inorganic beings appear to sorcerers?\"\"It's very difficult to tell what is what with them. Let's say that those beingsare enticed by us; or better yet, compelled to interact with us.\"Don Juan peered at me most intently. \"You're not taking in any of this at all,\"he said with the tone of someone who has reached a conclusion.\"It's nearly impossible for me to think about this rationally,\" I said.\"I warned you that the subject will tax your reason. The proper thing to do thenis to suspend judgment and let things take their course; meaning that you letthe inorganic beings come to you.\"\"Are you serious, don Juan?\"\"Deadly serious. The difficulty with inorganic beings is that their awareness isvery slow in comparison with ours. It will take years for a sorcerer to beacknowledged by inorganic beings. So, it is advisable to have patience and wait.Sooner or later they show up, but not like you or I would show up. Theirs is amost peculiar way to make themselves known.\"\"How do sorcerers entice them? Do they have a ritual?\"\"Well, they certainly don't stand in the middle of the road and call out to themwith trembling voices at the stroke of midnight, if that's what you mean.\"\"What do they do then?\"\"They entice them in dreaming. I said that what's involved is more than enticingthem. By the act of dreaming, sorcerers compel those beings to interact withthem.\"\"How do sorcerers compel them by the act of dreaming?\"\"Dreaming is sustaining the position where the assemblage point has shifted indreams. This act creates a distinctive energy charge which attracts theirattention. It's like bait to fish: They'll go for it. Sorcerers, by reaching andcrossing the first two gates of dreaming, set bait for those beings and compelthem to appear.\"By going through the two gates, you have made your bidding known to them. Now,you must wait for a sign from them.\"\"What would the sign be, don Juan?\"\"Possibly the appearance of one of them, although that seems too soon. I am ofthe opinion that their sign will be simply some interference in your dreaming. Ibelieve that the jolts of fear you are experiencing nowadays are notindigestion, but energy jolts sent to you by the inorganic beings.\"\"What should I do?\"\"You must gauge your expectations.\"I could not understand what he meant. He carefully explained that our normalexpectation when engaging in interaction with our fellow men, or with otherorganic beings, is to get an immediate reply to our solicitation.With inorganic beings, however, since they are separated from us by a mostformidable barrier- energy that moves at a different speed- sorcerers must gaugetheir expectations and sustain the solicitation for as long as it takes to beacknowledged.\"Do you mean, don Juan, that the solicitation is the same as the dreamingpractices?\"\"Yes. But for a perfect result, you must add to your practices the intent ofreaching those inorganic beings. Send a feeling of power and confidence to them;a feeling of strength; of detachment.\"Avoid, at any cost, sending a feeling of fear or morbidity. They are prettymorbid by themselves. To add your morbidity to them is unnecessary, to say theleast.\"\"I'm not clear, don Juan, about the way they appear to sorcerers. What is thepeculiar way they make themselves known?\"\"They do, at times, materialize themselves in the daily world right in front ofus. Most of the time, though, their invisible presence is marked by a bodilyjolt; a shiver of sorts that comes from the marrow of the bones.\"\"What about in dreaming, don Juan?\"\"In dreaming we have the total opposite. At times, we feel them the way you arefeeling them; as a jolt of fear. Most of the time, they materialize themselvesright in front of us. Since at the beginning of dreaming we have no experiencewhatsoever with them, they might imbue us with fear beyond measure. That is areal danger to us. Through the channel of fear, they can follow us to the dailyworld- with disastrous results for us.\"\"In what way, don Juan?\"\"Fear can settle down in our lives, and we would have to be mavericks to dealwith it. Inorganic beings can be worse than a pest. Through fear they can easilydrive us raving mad.\"\"What do sorcerers do with inorganic beings?\"\"They mingle with them. They turn them into allies. They form associations;create extraordinary friendships. I call them vast enterprises where perceptionplays the uppermost role. We are social beings. We unavoidably seek the companyof consciousness.\"With inorganic beings, the secret is not to fear them. And this must be donefrom the beginning.\"The intent one has to send out to them has to be of power and abandon. In thatintent one must encode the message \"I don't fear you. Come to see me. If you do,I'll welcome you. If you don't want to come, I'll miss you.\" With a message likethis, they'll get so curious that they'll come for sure.\"\"Why should they come to seek me, or why on earth should I seek them?\"\"Dreamers, whether they like it or not, in their dreaming seek associations withother beings. This may come to you as a shock, but dreamers automatically seekgroups of beings; nexuses [* nexuses- connected series or groups] of inorganicbeings in this case. Dreamers seek them avidly.\"\"This is very strange to me, don Juan. Why would dreamers do that?\"\"The novelty for us is the inorganic beings. And the novelty for them is one ofour kind crossing the boundaries of their realm. The thing you must bear in mindfrom now on is that inorganic beings, with their superb consciousness, exert atremendous pull over dreamers and can easily transport them into worlds beyonddescription.\"The sorcerers of antiquity used them, and they are the ones who coined the name'allies'. Their allies taught them to move the assemblage point out of the egg'sboundaries into the non-human universe. So when they transport a sorcerer, theytransport him to worlds beyond the human domain.\"As I heard him talk, I was plagued by strange fears and misgivings; which donJuan promptly realized.\"You are a religious man to the end.\" He laughed. \"Now, you're feeling the devilbreathing down your neck. Think about dreaming in these terms: Dreaming isperceiving more than what we believe it is possible to perceive.\"In my waking hours, I worried about the possibility that inorganic consciousbeings really existed. When I was dreaming, however, my conscious worries didnot have much effect. The jolts of physical fear continued, but whenever theyhappened a strange calmness always trailed behind; a calmness that took controlof me and let me proceed as if I had no fear at all.It seemed at that time that every breakthrough in dreaming happened to mesuddenly; without warning. The presence of inorganic beings in my dreams was noexception.It happened while I was dreaming about a circus I knew in my childhood. Thesetting looked like a town in the mountains in Arizona. I began to watch peoplewith the vague hope I always had that I would see again the people I had seenthe first time don Juan made me enter into the second attention.As I watched them, I felt a sizable jolt of nervousness in the pit of mystomach. It was like a punch. The jolt distracted me, and I lost sight of thepeople, the circus, and the mountain town in Arizona.In their place stood two strange-looking figures. They were thin, less than afoot wide, but long, perhaps seven feet. They were looming over me like twogigantic earthworms.I knew that it was a dream, but I also knew that I was seeing.Don Juan had discussed seeing in my normal awareness and in the second attentionas well. Although I had been incapable of experiencing it myself, I thought Ihad understood the idea of directly perceiving energy.In that dream, looking at those two strange apparitions, I realized that I wasseeing the energy essence of something unbelievable.I remained very calm. I did not move. The most remarkable thing to me was thatthey didn't dissolve or change into something else. They were cohesive beingsthat retained their candlelike shape. Something in them was forcing something inme to hold the view of their shape. I knew it because something was telling methat if I did not move, they would not move either.It all came to an end, at a given moment, when I woke up with a fright. I wasimmediately besieged by fears. A deep preoccupation took hold of me. It was notpsychological worry, but rather a bodily sense of anguish and sadness with noapparent foundation.The two strange shapes appeared to me from then on in every one of my dreamingsessions. Eventually, it was as if I dreamt only to encounter them. They neverattempted to move toward me or to interfere with me in any way.They just stood there immobile in front of me for as long as my dream lasted.Not only did I never make any effort to change my dreams, but I even forgot theoriginal quest of my dreaming practices.When I finally discussed with don Juan what was happening to me, I had spentmonths solely viewing the two shapes. \"You are stuck at a dangerous crossroad,\" don Juan said. \"It isn't right tochase these beings away, but it isn't right either to let them stay. For thetime being, their presence is a hindrance to your dreaming.\"\"What can I do, don Juan?\"\"Face them, right now, in the world of daily life, and tell them to come backlater when you have more dreaming power.\"\"How do I face them?\"\"It's not simple, but it can be done. It requires only that you have enoughguts, which of course you do.\"Without waiting for me to tell him that I had no guts at all, he took me to thehills. He lived then in northern Mexico, and he had given me the totalimpression he was a solitary sorcerer; an old man forgotten by everybody andcompletely outside the main current of human affairs.I had surmised, however, that he was intelligent beyond measure. And because ofthis I was willing to comply with what I half-believed were mere eccentricities.The cunningness of sorcerers, cultivated through the ages, was don Juan'strademark. He made sure that I understood all I could in my normal awareness;and he also made sure that I entered into the second attention where Iunderstood, or at least passionately listened to, everything he taught me.In this fashion, he divided me in two. In my normal consciousness, I could notunderstand why or how I was more than willing to take his eccentricitiesseriously. In the second attention, it all made sense to me.His contention was that the second attention is available to all of us. But bywillfully holding on to our half-cocked rationality- some of us more fiercelythan others- we keep the second attention at arm's length. His idea was thatdreaming brings down the barriers that surround and insulate the secondattention.The day he took me to the hills of the Sonoran desert to meet the inorganicbeings, I was in my normal state of awareness. Yet somehow I knew I had to dosomething that was certainly going to be unbelievable.It had rained lightly in the desert. The red dirt was still wet, and as I walkedit got clumped up in the rubber soles of my shoes. I had to step on rocks toremove the heavy chunks of dirt. We walked in an easterly direction climbingtoward the hills. When we got to a narrow gully between two hills, don Juanstopped.\"This is for sure an ideal place to summon your friends,\" he said.\"Why do you call them my friends?\"\"They have singled you out themselves. When they do that, it means that theyseek an association. I've mentioned to you that sorcerers form bonds offriendship with them. Your case seems to be an example. And you don't even haveto solicit them.\"\"What does such a friendship consist of, don Juan?\"\"It consists of a mutual exchange of energy. The inorganic beings supply theirhigh awareness, and sorcerers supply their heightened awareness and high energy.The positive result is an even exchange. The negative one is dependency on bothparties.\"The old sorcerers used to love their allies. In fact, they loved their alliesmore than they loved their own kind. I can foresee terrible dangers in that.\"\"What do you recommend I do, don Juan?\"\"Summon them. Size them up, and then decide yourself what to do.\"\"What should I do to summon them?\"\"Hold your dream view of them in your mind. The reason they have saturated youwith their presence in your dreams is that they want to create a memory of theirshape in your mind. And this is the time to use that memory.\" Don Juanforcefully ordered me to close my eyes and keep them closed.Then he guided me to sit down on some rocks. I felt the hardness and thecoldness of the rocks. The rocks were slanted; it was difficult to keep mybalance.\"Sit here and visualize their shape until they are just like they are in yourdreams,\" don Juan said in my ear. \"Let me know when you have them in focus.\"It took me very little time and effort to have a complete mental picture oftheir shape just like in my dreams. It did not surprise me at all that I coulddo it.What shocked me was that, although I tried desperately to let don Juan know Ihad pictured them in my mind, I could not voice my words or open my eyes. I wasdefinitely awake. I could hear everything.I heard don Juan say, \"You can open your eyes now.\"I opened them with no difficulty. I was sitting cross-legged on some rocks,which were not the same ones I had felt under me when I sat down. Don Juan wasjust behind me to my right. I tried to turn around to face him, but he forced myhead to remain straight.And then I saw two dark figures, like two thin tree trunks, right in front ofme. I stared at them openmouthed.They were not as tall as in my dreams. They had shrunk to half their size.Instead of being shapes of opaque luminosity, they were now two condensed, dark,almost black, menacing sticks.\"Get up and grab one of them,\" don Juan ordered me, \"and don't let go, no matterhow it shakes you.\"I definitely did not want to do anything of the sort, but some unknown drivemade me stand up against my will. I had at that moment the clear realizationthat I would end up doing what don Juan had ordered me to- although I had noconscious intention of doing so.Mechanically, I advanced toward the two figures, my heart pounding nearly out ofmy chest. I grabbed the one to my right. What I felt was an electric dischargethat almost made me drop the dark figure.Don Juan's voice came to me as if he had been yelling from a distance away. \"Youdrop it and you're done for,\" he said.I held on to the figure, which twirled and shook; not like a massive animalwould, but like something quite fluffy and light, although strongly electrical.We rolled and turned on the sand of the gully for quite some time. It gave mejolt after jolt of some sickening electric current.I thought it was sickening because I fancied it to be different from the energyI had always encountered in our daily world. When it hit my body, it tickled meand made me yell and growl like an animal; not in anguish, but in a strangeanger.It finally became a still, almost solid form under me. It lay inert. I asked donJuan if it was dead, but I did not hear my voice.\"Not a chance,\" said someone laughing; someone who was not don Juan. \"You'vejust depleted its energy charge. But don't get up yet. Lie there just a momentlonger.\"I looked at don Juan with a question in my eyes. He was examining me with greatcuriosity. Then he helped me up. The dark figure remained on the ground. Iwanted to ask don Juan if the dark figure was all right. Again, I could notvoice my question.Then I did something extravagant. I took it all for real. Up to that momentsomething in my mind was preserving my rationality by taking what was happeningas a dream; a dream induced by don Juan's machinations.I went to the figure on the ground and tried to lift it up. I could not put myarms around it because it had no mass. I became disoriented. The same voice,which was not don Juan's, told me to lie down on top of the inorganic being. Idid it, and both of us got up in one motion, the inorganic being like a darkshadow attached to me. It gently separated from me and disappeared, leaving mewith an extremely pleasant feeling of completeness.It took me more than twenty-four hours to regain total control of my faculties.I slept most of the time. Don Juan checked me from time to time by asking me thesame question, \"Was the inorganic being's energy like fire or like water?\"My throat seemed scorched. I could not tell him that the energy jolts I had feltwere like jets of electrified water. I have never felt jets of electrified waterin my life. I am not sure if it is possible to produce them or to feel them; butthat was the image playing in my mind every time don Juan asked his keyquestion.Don Juan was asleep when I finally knew I was completely recovered. Knowing thathis question was of great importance, I woke him up and told him what I hadfelt.\"You are not going to have helping friends among the inorganic beings, butraather relationships of annoying dependence,\" he stated. \"Be extremely careful.Watery inorganic beings are more given to excesses.\"The old sorcerers believed that the watery inorganic beings were more loving,more capable of imitating, or perhaps were even capable of having feelings- asopposed to the fiery ones, who were thought to be more serious and morecontained, but also more pompous.\"\"What's the meaning of all this for me, don Juan?\"\"The meaning is too vast to discuss at this time. My recommendation is that youvanquish fear from your dreams and from your life in order to safeguard yourunity. The inorganic being you depleted of energy and then recharged again wasthrilled out of its candlelike shape with it. It'll come to you for more.\"\"Why didn't you stop me, don Juan?\"\"You didn't give me time. Besides, you didn't even hear me shouting at you toleave the inorganic being on the ground.\"\"You should have lectured me beforehand the way you always do about all thepossibilities.\"\"I didn't know all the possibilities. In matters of the inorganic beings, I amnearly a novice. I refused that part of the sorcerers' knowledge on the groundthat it is too cumbersome and capricious. [* capricious- changeable: determinedby chance or impulse or whim rather than by necessity or reason] I don't want tobe at the mercy of any entity, organic or inorganic.\"That was the end of our exchange. I should have been worried because of hisdefinitely negative reaction, but I was not. I somehow was certain that whateverI had done was all right.I continued my dreaming practices without any interference from the inorganicbeings. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"4. The Fixation of the Assemblage DoingSince our agreement had been to discuss dreaming only when don Juan consideredit necessary, I rarely asked him about it and never insisted on continuing myquestions beyond a certain point. I was more than eager, therefore, to listen tohim whenever he decided to take up the subject. His comments or discussions ondreaming were invariably cushioned in other topics of his teachings, and theywere always suddenly and abruptly brought in.We were engaged in some unrelated conversation once while I was visiting withhim in his house, when without any preamble he said that, by means of theirdreaming contacts with inorganic beings, the old sorcerers became immenselywell-versed in the manipulation of the assemblage point; a vast and ominoussubject.I immediately grabbed the opportunity and asked don Juan for an estimate of thetime when the old sorcerers might have lived. At various opportunities before, Ihad asked the same question, but he never gave me a satisfactory answer. I wasconfident, however, that at the moment, perhaps because he had brought up thesubject himself, he might be willing to oblige me.\"A most trying subject,\" he said. The way he said it made me believe he wasdiscarding my question. I was quite surprised when he continued talking. \"It'lltax your rationality as much as the topic of inorganic beings. By the way, whatdo you think about them now?\"\"I have let my opinions rest,\" I said. \"I can't afford to think one way oranother.\"My answer delighted him. He laughed and commented on his own fears of andaversions to the inorganic beings.\"They have never been my cup of tea,\" he said. \"Of course, the main reason wasmy fear of them. I was unable to get over it when I had to, and then it becamefixed.\"\"Do you fear them now, don Juan?\"\"It's not quite fear I feel but revulsion. I don't want any part of them.\"\"Is there any particular reason for this revulsion?\"\"The best reason in the world: we are antithetical. [* antithetical- sharplycontrasted in character or purpose] They love slavery, and I love freedom. Theylove to buy, and I don't sell.\"I became inexplicably agitated and brusquely told him that the subject was sofarfetched for me that I could not take it seriously.He stared at me, smiling, and said, \"The best thing to do with inorganic beingsis what you do: deny their existence, but visit with them regularly and maintainthat you are dreaming; and that in dreaming anything is possible. This way youdon't commit yourself.\"I felt strangely guilty, although I could not figure out why. I felt compelledto ask, \"What are you referring to, don Juan?\"\"To your visits with the inorganic beings,\" he replied dryly.\"Are you kidding? What visits?\"\"I didn't want to discuss this, but I think it's time I tell you that thenagging voice you heard, reminding you to fix your dreaming attention on theitems of your dreams, was the voice of an inorganic being.\"I thought don Juan was completely irrational. I became so irritated that I evenyelled at him.He laughed at me and asked me to tell him about my irregular dreaming sessions.That request surprised me. I had never mentioned to anyone that every so often Iused to zoom out of a dream, pulled by a given item, but instead of my changingdreams, as I should have, the total mood of the dream changed and I would findmyself in a dimension unknown to me.I soared in it, directed by some invisible guide, which made me twirl around andaround. I always awoke from one of these dreams still twirling, and I continuedtossing and turning for a long time before I fully woke up.\"Those are bona fide meetings you are having with your inorganic being friends,\"don Juan said.I did not want to argue with him, but neither did I want to agree. I remainedsilent. I had forgotten my question about the old sorcerers, but don Juan pickedup the subject again.\"My understanding is that the old sorcerers existed perhaps as far back as tenthousand years ago,\" he said, smiling and watching my reaction.Basing my response on current archaeological data on the migration of Asiaticnomadic tribes to the Americas, I said that I believed his date was incorrect.Ten thousand years was too far back.\"You have your knowledge and I have mine,\" he said. \"My knowledge is that theold sorcerers ruled for four thousand years, from seven thousand to threethousand years ago. Three thousand years ago, they went to nothing. And fromthen on, sorcerers have been regrouping and restructuring what was left of theold ones.\"\"How can you be so sure about your dates?\" I asked.\"How can you be so sure about yours?\" he retorted.I told him that archaeologists have foolproof methods to establish the date ofpast cultures. Again he retorted that sorcerers have foolproof methods of theirown.\"I'm not trying to be contrary or argue you down,\" he continued, \"but somedaysoon you may be able to ask someone who knows for sure.\"\"No one can know this for sure, don Juan.\"\"This is another of those impossible things to believe, but there is somebodywho can verify all this. You'll meet that person someday.\"\"Come on, don Juan, you've got to be joking. Who can verify, what happened seventhousand years ago?\"\"Very simple, one of the old sorcerers we've been talking about. The one I met.He's the one who told me all about the old sorcerers. I hope you remember what Iam going to tell you about that particular man. He is the key to many of ourendeavors, and he's also the one you have to meet.\"I told don Juan that I was hanging on every word he said, even though I did notunderstand what he was saying. He accused me of humoring him, and of notbelieving a word about the old sorcerers. I admitted that in my state of dailyconsciousness, of course, I had not believed those farfetched stories. Butneither had I in the second attention, although there I should have had adifferent reaction.\"Only when you ponder what I said does it become a farfetched story,\" heremarked. \"If you don't involve your common sense, it remains purely a matter ofenergy.\"\"Why did you say, don Juan, that I am going to meet one of the old sorcerers?\"\"Because you are. It is vital that the two of you meet someday. But, for themoment, just let me tell you another farfetched story about one of the nagualsof my line, the nagual Sebastian.\"Don Juan told me then that the nagual Sebastian had been a sexton [* sexton- anofficer of the church who is in charge of sacred objects] in a church insouthern Mexico around the beginning of the eighteenth century.In his account, don Juan stressed how sorcerers, past or present, seek and findrefuge in established institutions, such as the Church. It was his idea thatbecause of their superior discipline, sorcerers are trustworthy employees, andthat they are avidly sought by institutions that are always in dire need of suchpersons. Don Juan maintained that as long as no one is aware of the sorcerers'doings, their lack of ideological sympathies makes them appear as model workers.Don Juan continued his story and said that one day while Sebastian wasperforming his duties as a sexton, a strange man came to the church; an oldIndian who seemed to be ill. In a weak voice he told Sebastian that he neededhelp. The nagual thought that the Indian wanted the parish priest, but the man,making a great effort, addressed the nagual. In a harsh and direct tone, he toldhim that he knew that Sebastian was not only a sorcerer but a nagual.Sebastian, quite alarmed by this sudden turn of events, pulled the Indian asideand demanded an apology. The man replied that he was not there to apologize, butto get specialized help. He needed, he said, to receive the nagual's energy inorder to maintain his life, which, he assured Sebastian, had spanned thousandsof years but at the moment was ebbing away.Sebastian, who was a very intelligent man, unwilling to pay attention to suchnonsense, urged the Indian to stop clowning around. The old man became angry andthreatened Sebastian with exposing him and his group to the ecclesiastical [*ecclesiastical- of or associated with a church] authorities if he did not complywith his request.Don Juan reminded me that those were the times when the ecclesiasticalauthorities were brutally and systematically eradicating heretical practicesamong the Indians of the New Worlds. The man's threat was not something to betaken lightly. The nagual and his group were indeed in mortal danger.Sebastian asked the Indian how he could give him energy. The man explained thatnaguals, by means of their discipline, gain a peculiar energy that they store intheir bodies and that he would get it painlessly from Sebastian's energy centeron his navel. In return for it, Sebastian would get not only the opportunity tocontinue his activities unscathed, but also a gift of power.The knowledge that he was being manipulated by the old Indian did not sit rightwith the nagual, but the man was inflexible and the old Indian left him noalternative but to comply with his request.Don Juan assured me that the old Indian was not exaggerating about his claims atall. He turned out to be one of the sorcerers of ancient times; one of thoseknown as the death defiers. He had apparently survived to the present bymanipulating his assemblage point in ways that only he knew about.Don Juan said that what transpired between Sebastian and that man later becamethe ground for an agreement that had bound all six naguals who followedSebastian. The death defier kept his word; in exchange for energy from every oneof those naguals, he made a donation to the giver; a gift of power. Sebastianhad to accept such a gift, although reluctantly; he had been cornered and had noother choice. All the other naguals who followed him, however, gladly andproudly accepted their gifts.Don Juan concluded his story, saying that over time the death defier came to beknown as the tenant. And for over two hundred years, the naguals of don Juan'sline honored that binding agreement; creating a symbiotic relationship thatchanged the course and final goal of their lineage.Don Juan did not care to explain the story any further, and I was left with astrange sensation of truthfulness, which was more bothersome to me than I couldhave imagined.\"How did he get to live that long?\" I asked.\"No one knows,\" don Juan replied. \"All we've known about him, for generations,is what he tells us. The death defier is the one I asked about the oldsorcerers, and he told me that they were at their peak three thousand yearsago.\"\"How do you know he was telling you the truth?\" I asked.Don Juan shook his head in amazement, if not revulsion. \"When you're facing thatinconceivable unknown out there,\" he said, pointing all around him, \"you don'tfool around with petty lies. Petty lies are only for people who have neverwitnessed what's out there waiting for them.\"\"What's waiting for us out there, don Juan?\"His answer, a seemingly innocuous phrase, was more terrifying to me than if hehad described the most horrendous thing.\"Something utterly impersonal,\" he said. He must have noticed that I was comingapart. He made me change levels of awareness to make my fright vanish. A few months later, my dreaming practices took a strange turn. I began to get,in my dreams, replies to questions I was planning to ask don Juan. The mostimpressive part of this oddity was that it quickly lapsed into my waking hours.One day, while I was sitting at my desk, I got a reply to an unvoiced questionabout the realness of inorganic beings. I had seen inorganic beings in dreams somany times I had begun to think of them as real. I reminded myself I had eventouched one, in a state of seminormal consciousness in the Sonoran desert. Andmy dreams had been periodically deviated to views of worlds I seriously doubtedcould have been products of my mentality.I wished to give don Juan my best shot, in terms of a concise query, so I moldeda question in my mind: If one is to accept that inorganic beings are as real aspeople, where, in the physicality of the universe, is the realm in which theyexist?After formulating the question to myself, I heard a strange laughter, just as Ihad the day I wrestled with the inorganic being. Then a man's voice answered me.\"That realm exists in a particular position of the assemblage point,\" it said.\"Just like your world exists in the habitual position of the assemblage point.\"The last thing I wanted was to enter into a dialogue with a disembodied voice,so I stood up and ran out of my house. The thought occurred to me that I waslosing my mind. Another worry to add to my collection of worries.The voice had been so clear and authoritative that it not only intrigued me butterrified me. I waited with great trepidation for oncoming barrages of thatvoice, but the event was never repeated. At the first opportunity I had, Iconsulted with don Juan. He was not impressed in the least.\"You must understand, once and for all, that things like this are very normal inthe life of a sorcerer,\" he said. \"You are not going mad. You are simply hearingthe voice of the dreaming emissary. Upon crossing the first or second gate ofdreaming, dreamers reach a threshold of energy and begin to see things or tohear voices. Not really plural voices, but a singular voice. Sorcerers call itthe voice of the dreaming emissary.\"\"What is the dreaming emissary?\"\"Alien energy that has conciseness. Alien energy that purports to aid dreamersby telling them things. The problem with the dreaming emissary is that it cantell only what the sorcerers already know or should know, were they worth theirsalt.\"\"To say that it's alien energy that has conciseness doesn't help me at all, donJuan. What kind of energy- benign, malignant, right, wrong, what?\"\"It's just what I said, alien energy. An impersonal force that we turn into avery personal one because it has voice. Some sorcerers swear by it. They evensee it. Or, as you yourself have done, they simply hear it as a man's or awoman's voice. And the voice can tell them about the state of things, which mostof the time they take as sacred advice.\"\"Why do some of us hear it as a voice?\"\"We see it or hear it because we maintain our assemblage points fixed on aspecific new position. The more intense this fixation, the more intense ourexperience of the emissary. Watch out! You may see it and feel it as a nakedwoman.\"Don Juan laughed at his own remark, but I was too scared for levity.\"Is this force capable of materializing itself?\" I asked.\"Certainly,\" he replied. \"And it all depends on how fixed the assemblage pointis. But, rest assured, if you are capable of maintaining a degree of detachment,nothing happens. The emissary remains what it is: an impersonal force that actson us because of the fixation of our assemblage points.\"\"Is its advice safe and sound?\"\"It cannot be advice. It only tells us what's what, and then we draw theinferences ourselves.\"I told don Juan then about what the voice had said to me.\"It's just like I said,\" don Juan remarked. \"The emissary didn't tell youanything new. Its statements were correct, but it only seemed to be revealingthings to you. What the emissary did was merely repeat what you already knew.\"\"I'm afraid I can't claim that I knew all that, don Juan.\"\"Yes, you can. You know now infinitely more about the mystery of the universethan what you rationally suspect. But that's our human malady, to know moreabout the mystery of the universe than we suspect.\"Having experienced this incredible phenomenon all by myself without don Juan'scoaching made me feel elated. I wanted more information about the emissary. Ibegan to ask don Juan whether he also heard the emissary's voice.He interrupted me and with a broad smile said, \"Yes, yes. The emissary alsotalks to me. In my youth I used to see it as a friar with a black cowl. Atalking friar who used to scare the daylights out of me every time. Then, whenmy fear was more manageable, it became a disembodied voice which tells me thingsto this day.\"\"What kinds of things, don Juan?\"\"Anything I focus my intent on; things I don't want to take the trouble offollowing up myself. Like, for example, details about the behavior of myapprentices. What they do when I am not around. It tells me things about you, inparticular. The emissary tells me everything you do.\"At that point, I really did not care for the direction our conversation hadtaken. I frantically searched my mind for questions about other topics while heroared with laughter.\"Is the dreaming emissary an inorganic being?\" I asked.\"Let's say that the dreaming emissary is a force that comes from the realm ofinorganic beings. This is the reason dreamers always encounter it.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that every dreamer hears or sees the emissary?\"\"Everyone hears the emissary. Very few see it or feel it.\"\"Do you have any explanation for this?\"\"No. Besides, I really don't care about the emissary. At one point in my life, Ihad to make a decision whether to concentrate on the inorganic beings and followin the footsteps of the old sorcerers, or to refuse it all. My teacher thenagual Julian helped me make up my mind to refuse it. I've never regretted thatdecision.\"\"Do you think I should refuse the inorganic beings myself, don Juan?\"He did not answer me. Instead, he explained that the whole realm of inorganicbeings is always poised to teach. Perhaps because inorganic beings have a deeperconsciousness than ours, they feel compelled to take us under their wings.\"I didn't see any point in becoming their pupil,\" he added. \"Their price is toohigh.\"\"What is their price?\"\"Our lives, our energy, our devotion to them. In other words, our freedom.\"\"But what do they teach?\"\"Things pertinent to their world. The same way we ourselves would teach them, ifwe were capable of teaching them, things pertinent to our world. Their method,however, is to take our basic self as a gauge of what we need and then teach usaccordingly. A most dangerous affair!\"\"I don't see why it would be dangerous.\"\"If someone was going to take your basic self as a gauge, with all your fearsand greed and envy, et cetera, et cetera, and teach you what fulfills thathorrible state of being, what do you think the result would be?\"I had no comeback. I thought I understood perfectly well the reasons for hisrejection.\"The problem with the old sorcerers was that they learned wonderful things, butit was on the basis of their unadulterated lower selves,\" don Juan went on. \"Theinorganic beings became their allies, and by means of deliberate examples, theirallies taught the old sorcerers marvels. Their allies performed the actions, andthe old sorcerers were guided step by step to copy those actions; but the oldsorcerers did so without changing anything about their basic nature.\"\"Do these relationships with inorganic beings exist today?\"\"I can't answer that truthfully. All I can say is that I can't conceive ofhaving a relationship like that myself. Involvements of this nature curtail oursearch for freedom by consuming all our available energy. In order to reallyfollow their allies' example, the old sorcerers had to spend their lives in therealm of the inorganic beings. The amount of energy needed to accomplish such asustained journey is staggering.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that the old sorcerers were able to exist in thoserealms like we exist here?\"\"Not quite like we exist here, but certainly they lived: They retained theirawareness; their individuality. The dreaming emissary became the most vitalentity for those sorcerers. If a sorcerer wants to live in the realm of theinorganic beings, the emissary is the perfect bridge. It speaks, and its bent isto teach; to guide.\"\"Have you ever been in that realm, don Juan?\"\"Countless times. And so have you. But there is no point in talking about itnow. You haven't cleared all the debris from your dreaming attention yet. We'lltalk about that realm some day.\"\"Do I gather, don Juan, that you don't approve of or like the emissary?\"\"I neither approve of it nor like it. It belongs to another mood; the oldsorcerers' mood. Besides, its teachings and guidance in our world are nonsense.And for that nonsense the emissary charges us enormities in terms of energy. Oneday you will agree with me. You'll see.\"In the tone of don Juan's words, I caught a veiled implication of his beliefthat I disagreed with him about the emissary. I was about to confront him withit when I heard the emissary's voice in my ears.\"He's right,\" the voice said. \"You like me because you find nothing wrong withexploring all possibilities. You want knowledge: Knowledge is power. You don'twant to remain safe in the routines and beliefs of your daily world.\"The emissary said all that in English with a marked Pacific Coast intonation.Then it shifted into Spanish. I heard a slight Argentine accent. I had neverheard the emissary speaking like this before. It fascinated me. The emissarytold me about fulfillment; knowledge; about how far away I was from mybirthplace; about my craving for adventure and my near obsession with newthings; new horizons. The voice even talked to me in Portuguese with a definiteinflection from the southern pampas.To hear that voice pouring out all this flattery not only scared me, butnauseated me. I told don Juan, right on the spot, that I had to stop my dreamingtraining. He looked up at me, caught by surprise. But when I repeated what I hadheard, he agreed I should stop, although I sensed he was doing it only toappease me.A few weeks later, I found my reaction a bit hysterical, and my decision towithdraw unsound. I went back to my dreaming practices. I was sure don Juan wasaware that I had canceled out my withdrawal.On one of my visits to him, quite abruptly, he spoke about dreams.\"Just because we haven't been taught to emphasize dreams as a genuine field forexploration doesn't mean they are not one,\" he began. \"Dreams are analyzed fortheir meaning or are taken as portents, but never are they taken as a realm ofreal events.\"\"To my knowledge, only the old sorcerers did that,\" don Juan went on, \"but atthe end they flubbed it. They got greedy, and when they came to a crucialcrossroads, they took the wrong fork. They put all their eggs in one basket: thefixation of the assemblage point on the thousands of positions it can adopt.\"Don Juan expressed his bewilderment at the fact that out of all the marvelousthings the old sorcerers learned exploring those thousands of positions, onlythe art of dreaming and the art of stalking remain. He reiterated that the artof dreaming is concerned with the displacement of the assemblage point. Then hedefined stalking as the art that deals with the fixation of the assemblage pointon any location to which it is displaced.\"To fixate the assemblage point on any new spot means to acquire cohesion,\" hesaid. \"You have been doing just that in your dreaming practices.\"\"I thought I was perfecting my energy body,\" I said, somehow surprised at hisstatement.\"You are doing that and much more, you are learning to have cohesion. Dreamingdoes it by forcing dreamers to fixate the assemblage point. The dreamingattention, the energy body, the second attention, the relationship withinorganic beings, and the dreaming emissary are but by-products of acquiringcohesion. In other words, they are all by-products of fixating the assemblagepoint on a number of dreaming positions.\"\"What is a dreaming position, don Juan?\"\"Any new position to which the assemblage point has been displaced duringsleep.\"\"How do we fixate the assemblage point on a dreaming position?\"\"By sustaining the view of any item in your dreams, or by changing dreams atwill. Through your dreaming practices, you are really exercising your capacityto be cohesive. That is to say, you are exercising your capacity to maintain anew energy shape by holding the assemblage point fixed on the position of anyparticular dream you are having.\"\"Do I really maintain a new energy shape?\"\"Not exactly, and not because you can't but only because you are shifting theassemblage point instead of moving it. Shifts of the assemblage point give riseto minute changes which are practically unnoticeable. The challenge of shifts isthat they are so small and so numerous that to maintain cohesiveness in all ofthem is a triumph.\"\"How do we know we are maintaining cohesion?\"\"We know it by the clarity of our perception. The clearer the view of ourdreams, the greater our cohesion.\"He said then that it was time for me to have a practical application of what Ihad learned in dreaming. Without giving me a chance to ask anything, he urged meto focus my attention, as if I were in a dream, on the foliage of a desert treegrowing nearby: a mesquite tree.\"Do you want me to just gaze at it?\" I asked.\"I don't want you to just gaze at it. I want you to do something very specialwith that foliage,\" he said. \"Remember that, in your dreams, once you are ableto hold the view of any item, you are really holding the dreaming position ofyour assemblage point. Now, gaze at those leaves as if you were in a dream, butwith a slight yet most meaningful variation. You are going to hold your dreamingattention on the leaves of the mesquite tree in the awareness of our dailyworld.\"My nervousness made it impossible for me to follow his line of thought. Hepatiently explained that by staring at the foliage, I would accomplish a minutedisplacement of my assemblage point. Then, by summoning my dreaming attentionthrough staring at individual leaves, I would actually fixate that minutedisplacement, and my cohesion would make me perceive in terms of the secondattention. He added, with a chuckle, that the process was so simple it wasridiculous.Don Juan was right. All I needed was to focus my sight on the leaves, maintainit, and in one instant I was drawn into a vortex-like sensation, extremely likethe vortexes in my dreams. The foliage of the mesquite tree became a universe ofsensory data. It was as if the foliage had swallowed me, but it was not only mysight that was engaged. If I touched the leaves, I actually felt them. I couldalso smell them. My dreaming attention was multisensorial instead of solelyvisual, as in my regular dreaming.What had begun as gazing at the foliage of the mesquite tree had turned into adream. I believed I was in a dreamt tree, as I had been in trees of countlessdreams. And, naturally, I behaved in this dreamt tree as I had learned to behavein my dreams: I moved from item to item, pulled by the force of a vortex thattook shape on whatever part of the tree I focused my multisensorial dreamingattention. Vortexes were formed not only on gazing, but also on touchinganything with any part of my body.In the midst of this vision or dream, I had an attack of rational doubts. Ibegan to wonder if I had really climbed the tree in a daze and was actuallyhugging the leaves, lost in the foliage, without knowing what I was doing. Orperhaps I had fallen asleep, possibly mesmerized by the fluttering of leaves inthe wind, and was having a dream.But just like in dreaming, I didn't have enough energy to ponder for too long.My thoughts were fleeting. They lasted an instant, and then the force of directexperience blanketed them out completely.A sudden motion around me shook everything and virtually made me emerge from aclump of leaves as if I had broken away from the tree's magnetic pull.I was facing then, from an elevation, an immense horizon. Dark mountains andgreen vegetation surrounded me. Another jolt of energy made me shake from mybones out.Then I was somewhere else. Enormous trees loomed everywhere. They were biggerthan the Douglas firs of Oregon and Washington State. Never had I seen a forestlike that. The scenery was such a contrast to the aridness of the Sonoran desertthat it left me with no doubt that I was having a dream.I held on to that extraordinary view, afraid to let go, knowing that it wasindeed a dream and would disappear once I had run out of dreaming attention. Butthe images lasted even when I thought I should have run out of dreamingattention. A horrifying thought crossed my mind then: What if this was neither adream nor the daily world?Frightened, as an animal must experience fright, I recoiled into the clump ofleaves I had emerged from. The momentum of my backward motion kept me goingthrough the tree foliage and around the hard branches. It pulled me away fromthe tree, and in one split second I was standing next to don Juan, at the doorof his house, in the desert in Sonora.I instantly realized I had entered again into a state in which I could thinkcoherently, but I could not talk. Don Juan told me not to worry. He said thatour speech faculty is extremely flimsy, and attacks of muteness are common amongsorcerers who venture beyond the limits of normal perception.My gut feeling was that don Juan had taken pity on me and had decided to give mea pep talk. But the voice of the dreaming emissary, which I clearly heard atthat instant, said that in a few hours and after some rest, I was going to beperfectly well.Upon awakening I gave don Juan, at his request, a complete description of what Ihad seen and done. He warned me that it was not possible to rely on myrationality to understand my experience, not because my rationality was in anyway impaired, but because what had taken place was a phenomenon outside theparameters of reason.I, naturally, argued that nothing can be outside the limits of reason. Thingscan be obscure, but sooner or later reason always finds a way to shed light onanything. And I really believed this.Don Juan, with extreme patience, pointed out that reason is only a by-product ofthe habitual position of the assemblage point. Therefore, knowing what is goingon, being of sound mind, having our feet on the ground- sources of great prideto us and assumed to be a natural consequence of our worth- are merely theresult of the fixation of the assemblage point on its habitual place. The morerigid and stationary it is, the greater our confidence in ourselves; the greaterour feeling of knowing the world; of being able to predict.He added that what dreaming does is give us the fluidity to enter into otherworlds by destroying our sense of knowing this world. He called dreaming ajourney of unthinkable dimensions; a journey that, after making us perceiveeverything we can humanly perceive, makes the assemblage point jump outside thehuman domain and perceive the inconceivable.\"We are back again,\" he went on, \"harping on the most important topic of thesorcerers' world; the position of the assemblage point. The old sorcerers'curse, as well as mankind's thorn in the side.\"\"Why do you say that, don Juan?\"\"Because both the old sorcerers fell prey and mankind in general falls prey tothe position of the assemblage point: the old sorcerers because, although theyknew all about the assemblage point, they fell for its facility to bemanipulated; mankind in general, because by not knowing that the assemblagepoint exists, we are obliged to take the by-product of its habitual position assomething final and indisputable.\"You must avoid falling into those traps,\" he continued. \"It'd be reallydisgusting if you sided with mankind as if you didn't know about the existenceof the assemblage point. But it'd be even more insidious if you sided with theold sorcerers and cynically manipulate the assemblage point for gain.\"\"I still don't understand. What is the connection of all this with what Iexperienced yesterday?\"\"Yesterday, you were in a different world. But if you ask me where that worldis, and I tell you that it is in the position of the assemblage point, my answerwon't make any sense to you.\"Don Juan's argument was that I had two choices.One was to follow mankind's rationales and be faced with a predicament: Myexperience would tell me that other worlds exist, but my reason would say thatsuch worlds do not and cannot exist.The other choice was to follow the old sorcerers' rationales, in which case Iwould automatically accept the existence of other worlds, and my greed alonewould make my assemblage point hold on to the position that creates thoseworlds. The result would be another kind of predicament; that of having to movephysically into visionlike realms, driven by expectations of power and gain.I was too numb to follow his argument, but then I realized I did not have tofollow it because I agreed with him completely despite the fact that I did nothave a total picture of what I was agreeing about. Agreeing with him was rathera feeling that came from far away; an ancient certainty I had lost which was nowslowly finding its way back to me.The return to my dreaming practices eliminated these turmoils, but created newones. For example, after months of hearing it daily, I stopped finding thedreaming emissary's voice an annoyance or a wonder. It became a matter of coursefor me.And I made so many mistakes influenced by what it said that I almost understooddon Juan's reluctance to take it seriously. A psychoanalyst would have had afield day interpreting the emissary according to all the possible permutationsof my intrapersonal dynamics.Don Juan maintained a steadfast view on the dreaming emissary: It is animpersonal but constant force from the realm of inorganic beings. Thus, everydreamer experiences it, in more or less the same terms. If we choose to take itswords as advice, we are incurable fools.And I was definitely one of them. There was no way I could have remainedimpassive being in direct contact with such an extraordinary event: a voice thatclearly and concisely told me in three languages hidden things about anything oranyone I focused my attention on. Its only drawback, which was of no consequenceto me, was that we were not synchronized. The emissary used to tell me thingsabout people or events when I had honestly forgotten I had been interested inthem.I asked don Juan about this oddity, and he said that it had to do with therigidity of my assemblage point. He explained that I had been reared by oldadults and that they had imbued me with old people's views. Therefore, I wasdangerously righteous. His urge to give me potions of hallucinogenic plants wasbut an effort, he said, to shake my assemblage point and allow it to have aminimal margin of fluidity.\"If you don't develop this margin,\" he went on, \"either you'll become morerighteous or you'll become a hysterical sorcerer. My interest in telling youabout the old sorcerers is not to bad-mouth them but to pit them against you.Sooner or later, your assemblage point will be more fluid, but not fluid enoughto offset your facility to be like them: righteous and hysterical.\"\"How can I avoid all that, don Juan?\"\"There is only one way. Sorcerers call it sheer understanding. I call it aromance with knowledge. It's the drive sorcerers use to know, to discover, to bebewildered.\"Don Juan changed the subject and continued to explain the fixation of theassemblage point. He said that seeing children's assemblage points constantlyfluttering as if moved by tremors and changing their place with ease, the oldsorcerers came to the conclusion that the assemblage point's habitual locationis not innate but brought about by habituation. Seeing also that only in adultsis it fixed on one spot, they surmised that the specific location of theassemblage point fetters a specific way of perceiving. Through usage, thisspecific way of perceiving becomes a system of interpreting sensory data.Don Juan pointed out that since we are drafted into that system by being borninto it, from the moment of our birth we imperatively strive to adjust ourperceiving to conform to the demands of this system; a system that rules us forlife. Consequently, the old sorcerers were thoroughly right in believing thatthe act of countermanding that system and perceiving energy directly is whattransforms a person into a sorcerer.Don Juan expressed wonder at what he called the greatest accomplishment of ourhuman upbringing: The ability to lock our assemblage point on its habitualposition. And furthermore, once it is immobilized there, our perception can becoached and guided to interpret what we perceive. In other words, we can then beguided to perceive more in terms of our system than in terms of our senses.He assured me that human perception is universally homogeneous, because theassemblage points of the whole human race are fixed on the same spot.He went on to say that sorcerers prove all this to themselves when they see thatat the moment the assemblage point is displaced beyond a certain threshold, andnew filaments of energy begin to be perceived, there is no sense to what weperceive. The immediate cause is that new sensory data has rendered ourconventional system inoperative; our formerly established system can no longerbe used to interpret what we are newly perceiving.\"Perceiving without our customary system is, of course, chaotic,\" don Juancontinued. \"But strangely enough, when we think we have truly lost our bearings,our old system rallies. It comes to our rescue and transforms our newincomprehensible perception into a thoroughly comprehensible new world. Justlike what happened to you when you gazed at the leaves of the mesquite tree.\"\"What exactly happened to me, don Juan?\"\"Your perception was chaotic for a while. Everything came to you at once, andyour system for interpreting the world didn't function. Then, the chaos clearedup, and there you were in front of a new world.\"\"We are again, don Juan, at the same place we were before. Does that worldexist, or is it merely my mind that concocted it?\"\"We certainly are back, and the answer is still the same. It exists in theprecise position your assemblage point was at that moment. In order to perceiveit, you needed cohesion, that is, you needed to maintain your assemblage pointfixed on that position; which you did. The result was that you totally perceiveda new world for a while.\"\"But would others perceive that same world?\"\"If they had uniformity and cohesion, they would. Uniformity is to hold, inunison, the same position of the assemblage point. The old sorcerers called theentire act of acquiring uniformity and cohesion outside the normal worldstalking perception.\"The art of stalking,\" he continued, \"as I have already said, deals with thefixation of the assemblage point. The old sorcerers discovered, throughpractice, that important as it is to displace the assemblage point, it isequallly important to make it stay fixed on its new position, wherever that newposition might be.\"He explained that if the assemblage point does not become stationary, there isno way that we can perceive coherently. We would experience then a kaleidoscopeof disassociated images. This is the reason the old sorcerers put as muchemphasis on stalking as they did on dreaming. One art cannot exist without theother, especially for the kinds of activities in which the old sorcerers wereinvolved.\"What were those activities, don Juan?\"\"The old sorcerers called them the intricacies of the second attention, or thegrand adventure of the unknown.\"Don Juan said that these activities stem from the displacements of theassemblage point. Not only had the old sorcerers learned to displace theirassemblage points to thousands of positions on the surface or on the inside oftheir energy masses, but they had also learned to fixate their assemblage pointson those positions; and thus retain their cohesiveness indefinitely.\"What was the benefit of that, don Juan?\"\"We can't talk about benefits. We can talk only about end results.\"He explained that the cohesiveness of the old sorcerers was such that it allowedthem to become perceptually and physically everything the specific position oftheir assemblage points dictated. They could transform themselves into anythingfor which they had a specific inventory. An inventory is, he said, all thedetails of perception involved in becoming, for example, a jaguar, a bird, aninsect, et cetera, et cetera.\"It's very hard for me to believe that this transformation can be possible,\" Isaid.\"It is possible,\" he assured me. \"Not so much for you and me, but for them. Forthem, it was nothing.\"He said that the old sorcerers had superb fluidity. All they needed was theslightest shift of their assemblage points, the slightest perceptual cue fromtheir dreaming, and they would instantaneously stalk their perception, rearrangetheir cohesiveness to fit their new state of awareness, and be an animal,another person, a bird, or anything.\"But isn't that what mentally ill people do? Make up their own reality as theygo along?\" I said.\"No, it isn't the same. Insane people imagine a reality of their own becausethey don't have any preconceived purpose at all. Insane people bring chaos intothe chaos. Sorcerers, on the contrary, bring order to the chaos. Theirpreconceived, transcendental purpose is to free their perception.Sorcerers don't make up the world they are perceiving. They perceive energydirectly. And then they discover that what they are perceiving is an unknown newworld which can swallow them whole because it is as real as anything we know tobe real.\"Don Juan then gave me a new version of what had happened to me as I gazed at themesquite tree. He said that I began by perceiving the energy of the tree. On thesubjective level, however, I believed I was dreaming because I employed dreamingtechniques to perceive energy.He asserted that to use dreaming techniques in the world of everyday life wasone of the old sorcerers' most effective devices. It made perceiving energydirectly dreamlike, instead of totally chaotic, until a moment when somethingrearranged perception and the sorcerer found himself facing a new world- thevery thing that had happened to me.I told him about the thought I'd had, which I had barely dared to think: thatthe scenery I was viewing was not a dream, nor was it our daily world.\"It wasn't,\" he said. \"I've been saying this to you over and over, and you thinkthat I am merely repeating myself. I know how difficult it is for the mind toallow mindless possibilities to become real. But new worlds exist! They arewrapped one around the other, like the skins of an onion. The world we exist inis but one of those skins.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that the goal of your teaching is to prepare me to gointo those worlds?\"\"No. I don't mean that. Those journeys are the antecedents [* antecedent-someone from whom you are descended; something which preceedes and causesanother result] of the sorcerers of today.We go into those worlds only as an exercise. We do the same dreaming that theold sorcerers used to do, but at one moment we deviate into new ground. The oldsorcerers preferred the shifts of the assemblage point, so they were always onmore or less known, predictable ground. We prefer the movements of theassemblage point. The old sorcerers were after the human unknown. We are afterthe nonhuman unknown.\"\"I haven't gotten to that yet, have I?\"\"No. You are only beginning. And at the beginning everyone has to go through theold sorcerers' steps. After all, they were the ones who invented dreaming.\"\"At what point will I then begin to learn the new sorcerers' brand of dreaming?\"\"You have enormous ground yet to cover. Years from now perhaps. Besides, in yourcase, I have to be extraordinarily careful. In character, you are definitelylinked to the old sorcerers. I've said this to you before, but you always manageto avoid my probes.\"Sometimes I even think that some alien energy is advising you, but then Idiscard the idea. You are not devious.\"\"What are you talking about, don Juan?\"\"You've done, unwittingly, two things that worry the hell out of me.\"You traveled with your energy body to a place outside this world the first timeyou dreamt; you even walked there!\"And then you traveled with your energy body to another place outside thisworld, but parting from the awareness of the daily world.\"\"Why would that worry you, don Juan?\"\"Dreaming is too easy for you. That is a damnation if we don't watch it. Itleads to the human unknown. As I said to you, modern-day sorcerers strive to getto the nonhuman unknown.\"\"What can the nonhuman unknown be?\"\"Freedom from being human. Inconceivable worlds that are outside the band of manbut that we still can perceive. This is where modern sorcerers take the sideroad. Their predilection is what's outside the human domain. And what areoutside that domain are all-inclusive worlds; not merely the realm of birds orthe realm of animals or the realm of man- even if it be the unknown man.\"What I am talking about are worlds, like the one where we live; total worldswith endless realms.\"\"Where are those worlds, don Juan? In different positions of the assemblagepoint?\"\"Right. In different positions of the assemblage point, but positions sorcerersarrive at with a movement of the assemblage point, not a shift.Entering into those worlds is the type of dreaming only sorcerers of today do.The old sorcerers stayed away from it because it requires a great deal ofdetachment and no self-importance whatsoever. A price they couldn't afford topay.\"For the sorcerers who practice dreaming today, dreaming is freedom to perceiveworlds beyond the imagination.\"\"But, what's the point of perceiving all that?\"\"You already asked me, today, the same question. You speak like a true merchant.What's the risk? you ask. What's the percentage gain to my investment? Is itgoing to better me?\"\"There is no way to answer that. The merchant mind does commerce. But freedomcannot be an investment. Freedom is an adventure with no end in which we riskour lives and much more for a few moments of something beyond words; beyondthoughts or feelings.\"\"I didn't ask that question in that spirit, don Juan. What I want to know iswhat can be the driving force to do all this for a lazy bum like myself?\"\"To seek freedom is the only driving force I know. Freedom to fly off into thatinfinity out there. Freedom to dissolve; to lift off; to be like the flame of acandle, which, in spite of being up against the light of a billion stars,remains intact, because it never pretended to be more than what it is: a merecandle.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"5. The World of Inorganic BeingsFaithful to my agreement to wait for don Juan to initiate any comment ondreaming, only in cases of necessity did I ask him for advice. Ordinarily,though, he not only seemed reluctant to touch the subject but was somehowdispleased with me about it. In my estimation, a confirmation of his disapprovalwas the fact that whenever we talked about my dreaming activities, he alwaysminimized the import of anything I had accomplished.For me, at that time, the animate existence of inorganic beings had become themost crucial aspect of my dreaming practices. After encountering them in mydreams, and especially after my bout with them in the desert around don Juan'shouse, I should have been more willing to take their existence as a seriousaffair. But all these events had quite the opposite effect on me. I becameadamant and doggedly denied the possibility that they existed.Then I had a change of heart and decided to conduct an objective inquiry aboutthem. The method of this inquiry required that I first compile a record ofeverything that transpired in my dreaming sessions, then use that record as amatrix to find out if my dreaming proved or disproved anything about theinorganic beings. I actually wrote down hundreds of pages of meticulous butmeaningless details when it should have been clear to me that the evidence oftheir existence had been gathered almost as soon as I had started my inquiry.It took but a few sessions for me to discover that what I thought to be donJuan's casual recommendation- to suspend judgment and let the inorganic beingscome to me- was, in fact, the very procedure used by the sorcerers of antiquityto attract them. By leaving me to find it out for myself, don Juan was simplyfollowing his sorcery training. He had remarked time and time again that it isvery difficult to make the self give up its strongholds except through practice.One of the self's strongest lines of defense is indeed our rationality, and thisis not only the most durable line of defense when it comes to sorcery actionsand explanations but also the most threatened. Don Juan believed that theexistence of inorganic beings is a foremost assailant of our rationality.In my dreaming practices, I had an established course, which I followed everysingle day without deviation. I aimed first at observing every conceivable itemof my dreams, then at changing dreams. I can say in sincerity that I observeduniverses of detail in dreams upon dreams.As a matter of course, at one given moment my dreaming attention began to wane,and my dreaming sessions ended: either in my falling asleep and having regulardreams in which I had no dreaming attention whatsoever; or in my waking up andnot being able to sleep at all.From time to time, however, as don Juan had described it, a current of foreignenergy, a scout, as he called it, was injected into my dreams. Being forewarnedhelped me to adjust my dreaming attention and be on the alert. The first time Inoticed foreign energy, I was dreaming about shopping in a department store. Iwas going from counter to counter looking for antiques. I finally found one. Theincongruence of looking for antiques in a department store was so obvious thatit made me chuckle, but since I had found one, I forgot about that incongruence.The antique was the handle of a walking stick. The salesman told me that it wasmade of iridium, which he called one of the hardest substances in the world. Itwas a carved piece: the head and shoulders of a monkey. It looked like jade tome. The salesman was insulted when I insinuated that it might be jade, and toprove his point he hurled the object, with all his strength, against the cementfloor. It did not break but bounced like a ball and then sailed away, spinninglike a Frisbee. I followed it. It disappeared behind some trees. I ran to lookfor it, and I found it, stuck on the ground. It had been transformed into anextraordinarily beautiful, deep green and black, full-length walking stick.I coveted it. I grabbed it and struggled to pull it out of the ground beforeanyone else came along. But, hard as I tried, I could not make it budge. I wasafraid I would break it if I attempted to pry it loose by shaking it back andforth. So I began to dig around it with my bare hands. As I kept on digging, itkept on melting, until only a puddle of green water was left in its place. Istared at the water; it suddenly seemed to explode. It turned into a whitebubble, and then it was gone. My dream continued into other images and details,which were not outstanding, although they were crystal clear.When I told don Juan about this dream, he said, \"You isolated a scout. Scoutsare more numerous when our dreams are average, normal dreams. The dreams ofdreamers are strangely free from scouts. When they appear, they are identifiableby the strangeness and incongruity surrounding them.\"\"Incongruity, in what manner, don Juan?\"\"Their presence doesn't make any sense.\"\"Very few things make sense in a dream.\"\"Only in average dreams are things nonsensical. I would say that this is sobecause more scouts are injected then, because average people are subject to agreater barrage from the unknown.\"\"Do you know why is that so, don Juan?\"\"In my opinion, what takes place is a balance of forces. Average people havestupendously strong barriers to protect themselves against those onslaughts.Barriers such as worries about the self. The stronger the barrier, the greaterthe attack.\"Dreamers, by contrast, have fewer barriers and fewer scouts in their dreams. Itseems that in dreamers' dreams nonsensical things disappear, perhaps to ensurethat dreamers catch the presence of scouts.\"Don Juan advised me to pay close attention and remember every single possibledetail of the dream I had had. He even made me repeat what I had told him.\"You baffle me,\" I said. \"You don't want to hear anything about my dreaming, andthen you do. Is there any order to your refusals and acceptances?\"\"You bet there is order behind all this,\" he said. \"Chances are, you'll do thesame someday to another dreamer. Some items are of key importance because theyare associated with the spirit. Others are entirely unimportant because they areassociated with our indulging personality.\"\"The first scout you isolate will always be present; it could be in any form,even iridium. By the way, what's iridium?\"\"I don't really know,\" I said in total sincerity.\"There you are! And what will you say if it turns out to be one of the strongestsubstances in the world?\"Don Juan's eyes shone with delight while I nervously laughed at that absurdpossibility- which I later learned was true.I began to notice from then on the presence of incongruous items in my dreams.Once I had accepted don Juan's categorization of foreign energy in dreams, Itotally agreed with him that incongruous items were foreign invaders of mydreams. Upon isolating them, my dreaming attention always focused on them withan intensity that did not occur under any other circumstances.Another thing I noticed was that every time foreign energy invaded my dreams, mydreaming attention had to work hard to turn it into a known object. The handicapof my dreaming attention was its inability to accomplish fully such atransformation. The end result was a bastardized item, nearly unknown to me. Theforeign energy then dissipated quite easily, the bastardized item vanished,turning into a blob of light, which was quickly absorbed by other pressingdetails of my dreams.When I asked don Juan to comment on what was happening to me, he said, \"At thispoint in your dreaming, scouts are reconnoiterers sent by the inorganic realm.They are very fast, meaning that they don't stay long.\"\"Why do you say that they are reconnoiterers, don Juan?\"\"They come in search of potential awareness. They have consciousness andpurpose, although it is incomprehensible to our minds, comparable perhaps to theconsciousness and purpose of trees. The inner speed of trees and inorganicbeings is incomprehensible to us because it is infinitely slower than ours.\"\"What makes you say that, don Juan?\"\"Both trees and inorganic beings last longer than we do. They are made to stayput. They are immobile, yet they make everything move around them.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that inorganic beings are stationary like trees?\"\"Certainly. What you see in dreaming as bright or dark sticks are theirprojections. What you hear as the voice of the dreaming emissary is equallytheir projection. And so are their scouts.\"For some unfathomable reason, I was overwhelmed by these statements. I wassuddenly filled with anxiety. I asked don Juan if trees also had projectionslike that.\"\"They do,\" he said. \"Their projections are, however, even less friendly to usthan those of the inorganic beings. Dreamers never seek them, unless they are ina state of profound amenity with trees, which is a very difficult state toattain. We have no friends on this earth, you know.\" He chuckled and added,\"It's no mystery why.\"\"It may not be a mystery to you, don Juan, but it certainly is to me.\"\"We are destructive. We have antagonized every living being on this earth.That's why we have no friends.\"I felt so ill at ease that I wanted to stop the conversation altogether. But acompulsive urge made me return to the subject of inorganic beings.\"What do you think I should do to follow the scouts?\" I asked.\"Why in the world would you want to follow them?\"\"I am conducting an objective inquiry about inorganic beings.\"\"You're pulling my leg, aren't you? I thought you were unmovable on your standthat inorganic beings don't exist.\"His scoffing tone and cackling laughter told me what his thoughts and feelingsabout my objective inquiry were.\"I've changed my mind, don Juan. Now I want to explore all those possibilities.\"\"Remember, the realm of inorganic beings was the old sorcerers' field. To getthere, they tenaciously fixed their dreaming attention on the items of theirdreams. In that fashion, they were able to isolate the scouts. And when they hadthe scouts in focus, they shouted their intent to follow them. The instant theold sorcerers voiced that intent, off they went, pulled by that foreign energy.\"\"Is it that simple, don Juan?\"He did not answer. He just laughed at me as if daring me to do it.At home, I tired of searching for don Juan's true meanings. I was thoroughlyunwilling to consider that he might have described an actual procedure. Afterrunning out of ideas and patience, one day I let my guard down. In a dream I washaving then, I was baffled by a fish that had suddenly jumped out of a pond Iwas walking by. The fish twitched by my feet, then flew like a colored bird,perching on a branch, still being a fish. The scene was so outlandish that mydreaming attention was galvanized. I instantly knew it was a scout. A secondlater, when the fish-bird turned into a point of light, I shouted my intent tofollow it, and, just as don Juan had said, off I went into another world.I flew through a seemingly dark tunnel as if I were a weightless flying insect.The sensation of a tunnel ended abruptly. It was exactly as if I had been spewedout of a tube and the impulse had left me smack against an immense physicalmass. I was almost touching it. I could not see the end of it in any direction Ilooked. The entire thing reminded me so much of science fiction movies that Iwas utterly convinced I was constructing the view of that mass myself, as oneconstructs a dream. Why not? The thought I had was that, after all, I wasasleep, dreaming.I settled down to observe the details of my dream. What I was viewing lookedvery much like a gigantic sponge. It was porous and cavernous. I could not feelits texture, but it looked rough and fibrous. It was dark brownish in color.Then I had a momentary jolt of doubt about that silent mass being just a dream.What I was facing did not change shape. It did not move either. As I looked atit fixedly, I had the complete impression of something real but stationary. Itwas planted somewhere, and it had such a powerful attraction that I wasincapable of deviating my dreaming attention to examine anything else, includingmyself. Some strange force, which I had never before encountered in my dreaming,had me riveted down.Then I clearly felt that the mass released my dreaming attention. All myawareness focused on the scout that had taken me there. It looked like a fireflyin the darkness, hovering over me, by my side. In its realm, it was a blob ofsheer energy. I was able to see its energetic sizzling. It seemed to beconscious of me. Suddenly, it lurched onto me and tugged me or prodded me. I didnot feel its touch, yet I knew it was touching me. That sensation was startlingand new, it was as if a part of me that was not there had been electrified bythat touch, ripples of energy went through it, one after another.From that moment on, everything in my dreaming became much more real. I had avery difficult time keeping the idea that I was dreaming a dream. To thisdifficulty, I had to add the certainty I had that with its touch the scout hadmade an energetic connection with me. I knew what it wanted me to do the instantit seemed to tug me or shove me.The first thing it did was to push me through a huge cavern or opening into thephysical mass I had been facing. Once I was inside that mass, I realized thatthe interior was as homogeneously porous as the outside but much softer looking,as if the roughness had been sanded down. What I was facing was a structure thatlooked something like the enlarged picture of a beehive. There were countlessgeometric-shaped tunnels going in every direction. Some went up or down, or tomy left or my right. They were at angles with one another, or going up or downon steep or mild inclines.The light was very dim, yet everything was perfectly visible. The tunnels seemedto be alive and conscious: They sizzled. I stared at them, and the realizationthat I was seeing hit me. Those were tunnels of energy. At the instant of thisrealization, the voice of the dreaming emissary roared inside my ears, so loudlyI could not understand what it said. \"Lower it down,\" I yelled with unusualimpatience and became aware that if I spoke, I blocked my view of the tunnelsand entered into a vacuum where all I could do was hear.The emissary modulated its voice and said, \"You are inside an inorganic being.Choose a tunnel and you can even live in it.\" The voice stopped for an instant,then added, \"That is, if you want to do it.\"I could not bring myself to say anything. I was afraid that any statement ofmine might be construed as the opposite of what I meant.\"There are endless advantages for you,\" the emissary's voice continued. \"You canlive in as many tunnels as you want. And each one of them will teach somethingdifferent. The sorcerers of antiquity lived in this manner and learned marvelousthings.\"I sensed without any feeling that the scout was pushing me from behind. Itappeared to want me to move onward. I took the tunnel to my immediate right. Assoon as I was in it, something made me aware that I was not walking on thetunnel; I was hovering in it, flying. I was a blob of energy no different fromthe scout.The voice of the emissary sounded inside my ears again. \"Yes, you are just ablob of energy,\" it said. Its redundancy brought me an intense relief. \"And youare floating inside one inorganic being,\" it went on. \"This is the way the scoutwants you to move in this world. When it touched you, it changed you forever.You are practically one of us now. If you want to stay here, just voice yourintent.\" The emissary stopped talking, and the view of the tunnel returned tome. But when it spoke again, something had been adjusted. I did not lose sightof that world and I still could hear the emissary's voice. \"The ancientsorcerers learned everything they knew about dreaming by staying here among us,\"it said.I was going to ask if they had learned everything they knew by just livinginside those tunnels, but before I voiced my question the emissary answered it.\"Yes, they learned everything by just living inside the inorganic beings,\" itsaid. \"To live inside them, all the old sorcerers had to do was say they wantedto, just like all it took for you to get here was to voice your intent, loud andclear.\"The scout pushed against me to signal me to continue moving. I hesitated, and itdid something equivalent to shoving me with such a force that I shot like abullet through endless tunnels. I finally stopped because the scout stopped. Wehovered for an instant. Then we dropped into a vertical tunnel. I did not feelthe drastic change of direction. As far as my perception was concerned, I wasstill moving seemingly parallel to the ground.We changed directions many times with the same perceptual effect on me. I beganto formulate a thought about my incapacity to feel that I was moving up or downwhen I heard the emissary's voice. \"I think you'll be more comfortable if youcrawl rather than fly,\" it said. \"You can also move like a spider or a fly,straight up or down or upside down.\"Instantaneously, I settled down. It was as if I had been fluffy and suddenly Igot some weight, which grounded me. I could not feel the tunnel's walls, but theemissary was right about my being more comfortable when crawling.\"In this world you don't have to be pinned down by gravity,\" it said. Of course,I was able to realize that myself. \"You don't have to breathe either,\" the voicewent on. \"And, for your convenience alone, you can retain your eyesight and seeas you see in your world.\" The emissary seemed to be deciding whether to addmore. It coughed, just like a man clearing his throat, and said, \"The eyesightis never impairedf. Therefore, a dreamer always speaks about his dreaming interms of what he sees.\"The scout pushed me into a tunnel to my right. It was somehow darker than theothers. To me, at a preposterous level, it seemed cozier than the others, morefriendly or even known to me. The thought crossed my mind that I was like thattunnel or that the tunnel was like me.\"You two have met before,\" the emissary's voice said.\"I beg your pardon,\" I said. I had understood what it said, but the statementwas incomprehensible.\"\"You two wrestled, and because of that you now carry each other's energy.\" Ithought that the emissary's voice carried a touch of malice or even sarcasm.\"No, it isn't sarcasm,\" the emissary said. \"I am glad that you have relativeshere among us.\"\"What do you mean by relatives?\" I asked.\"Shared energy makes kinship,\" it replied. \"Energy is like blood.\"I was unable to say anything else. I clearly felt pangs of fear.\"Fear is something that is absent in this world,\" the emissary said.And that was the only statement that was not true.My dreaming ended there. I was so shocked by the vividness of everything, and bythe impressive clarity and continuity of the emissary's statements, that I couldnot wait to tell don Juan. It surprised and disturbed me that he did not want tohear my account. He did not say so, but I had the impression that he believedall of it had been a product of my indulging personality.\"Why are you behaving like this with me?\" I asked. \"Are you displeased with me?\"\"No. I am not displeased with you,\" he said. \"The problem is that I can't talkabout this part of your dreaming. You are completely by yourself in this case. Ihave said to you that inorganic beings are real. You are finding out how realthey are. But what you do with this finding is your business, yours alone.Someday you'll see the reason for my staying away.\"\"But isn't there something you can tell me about that dream?\" I insisted.\"What I can say is that it wasn't a dream. It was a journey into the unknown. Anecessary journey, I may add, and an ultrapersonal one.\"He changed the subject then and began to talk about other aspects of histeachings.From that day on, in spite of my fear and don Juan's reluctance to advise me, Ibecame a regular dream traveler to that spongy world. I discovered right awaythat the greater my capacity to observe the details of my dreams, the greater myfacility to isolate the scouts.If I chose to acknowledge the scouts as foreign energy, they remained within myperceptual field for a while.If I chose to turn the scouts into quasi known objects, they stayed even longer,changing shapes erratically.But if I followed them, by revealing out loud my intent to go with them, thescouts veritably transported my dreaming attention to a world beyond what I cannormally imagine.Don Juan had said that inorganic beings are always poised to teach. But he hadnot told me that dreaming is what they are poised to teach. He had stated thatthe dreaming emissary, since it is a voice, is the perfect bridge between thatworld and ours. I found out that the dreaming emissary was not only a teacher'svoice but the voice of a most subtle salesman. It repeated on and on, at theproper time and occasion, the advantages of its world. Yet it also taught meinvaluable things about dreaming. Listening to what it said, I understood theold sorcerers' preference for concrete practices.\"For perfect dreaming, the first thing you have to do is shut off your internaldialogue,\" it said to me one time. \"For best results in shutting it off, putbetween your fingers some two to three inch long quartz crystals or a couple ofsmooth, thin river pebbles. Bend your fingers slightly, and press the crystalsor pebbles with them.\"The emissary said that metal pins, if they were the size and width of one'sfingers, were equally effective. The procedure consisted of pressing at leastthree thin items between the fingers of each hand and creating, an almostpainful pressure in the hands. This pressure had the strange property ofshutting off the internal dialogue. The emissary's expressed preference was forquartz crystals. It said that they gave the best results, although with practiceanything was suitable.\"Falling asleep at a moment of total silence guarantees a perfect entrance intodreaming,\" said the emissary's voice, \"and it also guarantees the enhancing ofone's dreaming attention.\"\"Dreamers should wear a gold ring,\" said the emissary to me another time,\"preferably fitted a bit tight.\"The emissary's explanation was that such a ring serves as a bridge for surfacingfrom dreaming back into the daily world or for sinking from our daily awarenessinto the inorganic beings' realm.\"How does this bridge work?\" I asked. I had not understood what was involved.\"The contact of the fingers on the ring lays the bridge down,\" the emissarysaid. \"If a dreamer comes into my world wearing a ring, that ring attracts theenergy of my world and keeps it; and when that energy is needed, that energytransports the dreamer back to this world through the ring's releasing it intothe dreamer's fingers.\"The pressure of that ring around a finger serves equally well to ensure adreamer's return to his world. It gives him a constant, familiar sense on hisfinger.\"During another dreaming session, the emissary said that our skin is the perfectorgan for transposing energy waves from the mode of the daily world to the modeof the inorganic beings and vice versa. It recommended that I keep my skin cooland free from pigments or oils.It also recommended that dreamers wear a tight belt or headband or necklace tocreate a pressure point that serves as a skin center of energy exchange. Theemissary explained that the skin automatically screens energy, and that what weneed to do to make the skin not only screen but exchange energy from one mode tothe other is to express our intent out loud, in dreaming.One day the emissary's voice gave me a fabulous bonus. It said that, in order toensure the keenness and accuracy of our dreaming attention, we must bring itfrom behind the roof of the mouth, where an enormous reservoir of attention islocated in all human beings. The emissary's specific directions were to practiceand learn the discipline and control necessary to press the tip of the tongue onthe roof of the mouth while dreaming. This task is as difficult and consuming,the emissary said, as finding one's hands in a dream. But, once it isaccomplished, this task gives the most astounding results in terms ofcontrolling the dreaming attention.I received a profusion of instructions on every conceivable subject,instructions that I promptly forgot if they were not endlessly repeated to me. Isought don Juan's advice on how to resolve this problem of forgetting.His comment was as brief as I had expected. \"Focus only on what the emissarytells you about dreaming,\" he said.Whatever the emissary's voice repeated enough times, I grasped with tremendousinterest and fervor. Faithful to don Juan's recommendation, I only followed itsguidance when it referred to dreaming and I personally corroborated the value ofits instruction. The most vital piece of information for me was that thedreaming attention comes from behind the roof of the mouth. It took a great dealof effort on my part to feel in dreaming that I was pressing the roof of mymouth with the tip of my tongue. Once I accomplished this, my dreaming attentiontook on a life of its own and became, I may say, keener than my normal attentionto the daily world.It did not take much for me to deduce how deep must have been the involvement ofthe old sorcerers with the inorganic beings. Don Juan's commentaries andwarnings about the danger of such an involvement became more vital than ever. Itried my best to live up to his standards of self-examination with noindulgence. Thus, the emissary's voice and what it said became a superchallengefor me. I had to avoid, at all cost, succumbing to the temptation of theemissary's promise of knowledge, and I had to do this all by myself since donJuan continued to refuse to listen to my accounts.\"You must give me at least a hint about what I should do,\" I insisted on oneoccasion when I was bold enough to ask him.\"I can't,\" he said with finality, \"and don't ask again. I've told you, in thisinstance, dreamers have to be left alone.\"\"But you don't even know what I want to ask you.\"\"Oh yes I do. You want me to tell you that it is all right to live in one ofthose tunnels, if for no other reason than just to know what the emissary'svoice is talking about.\"I admitted that this was exactly my dilemma. If nothing else, I wanted to knowwhat was implied in the statement that one can live inside those tunnels.\"I went through the same turmoil myself,\" don Juan went on, \"and no one couldhelp me because this is a superpersonal and final decision; a final decisionmade the instant you voice your desire to live in that world. In order to getyou to voice that desire, the inorganic beings are going to cater to your mostsecret wishes.\"\"This is really diabolical, don Juan.\"\"You can say that again. But not just because of what you are thinking. For you,the diabolical part is the temptation to give in, especially when such greatrewards are at stake. For me, the diabolical nature of the inorganic beings'realm is that it might very well be the only sanctuary dreamers have in ahostile universe.\"\"Is it really a haven for dreamers, don Juan?\"\"It definitely is for some dreamers. Not for me. I don't need props or railings.I know what I am. I am alone in a hostile universe, and I have learned to say.So be it!\"That was the end of our exchange. He had not said what I wanted to hear, yet Iknew that even the desire to know what it was like to live in a tunnel meantalmost to choose that way of life. I was not interested in such a thing. I mademy decision right then to continue my dreaming practices without any furtherimplications. I quickly told don Juan about it.\"Don't say anything,\" he advised me. \"But do understand that if you choose tostay, your decision is final. You'll stay there forever.\"It is impossible for me to judge objectively what took place during thecountless times I dreamt of that world. I can say that it appeared to be a worldas real as any dream can be real. Or I can say that it appeared to be as real asour daily world is real. Dreaming of that world, I became aware of what don Juanhad said to me many times: that under the influence of dreaming, reality suffersa metamorphosis. I found myself then facing the two options which, according todon Juan, are the options faced by all dreamers: either we carefully revamp orwe completely disregard our system of sensory input interpretation.For don Juan, to revamp our interpretation system meant to intend itsreconditioning. It meant that one deliberately and carefully attempts to enlargeits capabilities. By living in accordance with the sorcerers' way, dreamers saveand store the necessary energy to suspend judgment and thus facilitate thatintended revamping. He explained that if we choose to recondition ourinterpretation system, reality becomes fluid, and the scope of what can be realis enhanced without endangering the integrity of reality. Dreaming, then, indeedopens the door into other aspects of what is real.If we choose to disregard our system, the scope of what can be perceived withoutinterpretation grows inordinately. The expansion of our perception is sogigantic that we are left with very few tools for sensory interpretation, andthus leaves a sense of an infinite realness that is unreal; or an infiniteunrealness that could very well be real but is not.For me, the only acceptable option was reconstructing and enlarging myinterpretation system. In dreaming the inorganic beings' realm, I was faced withthe consistence of that world from dream to dream; from isolating the scoutsthrough listening to the dreaming emissary's voice to going through tunnels. Iwent through them without feeling anything, yet being aware that space and timewere constant, although not in terms discernible by rationality under normalconditions. However, by noticing the difference or the absence or profusion ofdetail in each tunnel, or by noticing the sense of distance between tunnels, orby noticing the apparent length or width of each tunnel in which I traveled, Iarrived at a sense of objective observation.The area where this reconstruction of my interpretation system had the mostdramatic effect was the knowledge of how I related to the world of the inorganicbeings. In that world, which was real to me, I was a blob of energy. Thus, Icould whiz in the tunnels, like a fast-moving light, or I could crawl on theirwalls, like an insect. If I flew, a voice told me not arbitrary but consistentinformation about details on the walls on which I had focused my dreamingattention. Those details were intricate protuberances, like the Braille systemof writing. When I crawled on the walls, I could see the same details withgreater accuracy and hear the voice giving me more complex descriptions.The unavoidable consequence for me was the development of a dual stand. On theone hand, I knew I was dreaming a dream; on the other, I knew I was involved ina pragmatic journey, as real as any journey in the world. This bona fide splitwas a corroboration of what don Juan had said: that the existence of inorganicbeings is the foremost assailant of our rationality.Only after I had really suspended judgment did I get any relief. At one moment,when the tension of my untenable position- seriously believing in the attestableexistence of inorganic beings, while seriously believing that it was only adream- was about to destroy me, something in my attitude changed drastically,but without any solicitation on my part.Don Juan maintained that my energy level, which had been steadily growing, oneday reached a threshold that allowed me to disregard assumptions andprejudgments about the nature of man, reality, and perception. That day I becameenamored with knowledge, regardless of logic or functional value, and, aboveall, regardless of personal convenience.When my objective inquiry into the subject of inorganic beings no longermattered to me, don Juan himself brought up the subject of my dream journey intothat world. He said, \"I don't think you are aware of the regularity of yourmeetings with inorganic beings.\"He was right. I had never bothered to think about it. I commented on the oddityof my oversight.\"It isn't an oversight,\" he said. \"It's the nature of that realm to fostersecretiveness. Inorganic beings veil themselves in mystery, darkness. Thinkabout their world: stationary, fixed to draw us like moths to a light or a fire.\"There is something the emissary hasn't dared to tell you so far: that theinorganic beings are after our awareness or the awareness of any being thatfalls into their nets. They'll give us knowledge, but they'll extract a payment:our total being.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that the inorganic beings are like fishermen?\"\"Exactly. At one moment, the emissary will show you men who got caught in thereor other beings that are not human that also got caught in there.\"Revulsion and fear should have been my response. Don Juan's revelations affectedme deeply, but in the sense of creating uncontainable curiosity. I was nearlypanting.\"Inorganic beings can't force anyone to stay with them,\" don Juan went on. \"Tolive in their world is a voluntary affair. Yet they are capable of imprisoningany one of us by catering to our desires, by pampering and indulging us. Bewareof awareness that is immobile. Awareness like that has to seek movement, and itdoes this, as I've told you, by creating projections, phantasmagoricalprojections at times.\"I asked don Juan to explain what 'phantasmagorical projections' meant. He saidthat inorganic beings hook onto dreamers' innermost feelings and play themmercilessly. They create phantoms to please dreamers or frighten them. Hereminded me that I had wrestled with one of those phantoms. He explained thatinorganic beings are superb projectionists, who delight in projecting themselveslike pictures on the wall.\"The old sorcerers were brought down by their inane trust in those projections,\"he continued. \"The old sorcerers believed their allies had power. Theyoverlooked the fact their allies were tenuous energy projected through worlds,like in a cosmic movie.\"\"You are contradicting yourself, don Juan. You yourself said that the inorganicbeings are real. Now you tell me that they are mere pictures.\"\"I meant to say that the inorganic beings, in our world, are like movingpictures projected on a screen; and I may even add that they are like movingpictures of rarefied energy projected through the boundaries of two worlds.\"\"But what about inorganic beings in their world? Are they also like movingpictures?\"\"Not a chance. That world is as real as our world. The old sorcerers portrayedthe inorganic beings' world as a blob of caverns and pores floating in some darkspace. And they portrayed the inorganic beings as hollow canes bound together,like the cells of our bodies. The old sorcerers called that immense bundle thelabyrinth of penumbra.\" [* penumbra- a fringe region of partial shadow around aregion of complete shadow]\"Then every dreamer sees that world in the same terms, right?\"\"Of course. Every dreamer sees it as it is. Do you think you are unique?\"I confessed that something in that world had been giving me all along thesensation I was unique. What created this most pleasant and clear feeling ofbeing exclusive was not the voice of the dreaming emissary, or anything I couldconsciously think about.\"That's exactly what floored the old sorcerers,\" don Juan said. \"The inorganicbeings did to them what they are doing to you now; they created for them thesense of being unique, exclusive plus a more pernicious [* pernicious-exceedingly harmful] sense yet: the sense of having power. Power and uniquenessare unbeatable as corrupting forces. Watch out!\"\"How did you avoid that danger yourself, don Juan?\"\"I went to that world a few times, and then I never went back.\"Don Juan explained that in the opinion of sorcerers, the universe ispredatorial, and sorcerers more than anyone else have to take this into accountin their daily sorcery activities. His idea was that consciousness isintrinsically compelled to grow, and the only way it can grow is through strife;through life-or-death confrontations.\"The awareness of sorcerers grows when they do dreaming,\" he went on. \"And themoment it grows, something out there acknowledges its growth, recognizes it andmakes a bid for it. The inorganic beings are the bidders for that new, enhancedawareness. Dreamers have to be forever on their toes. They are prey the momentthey venture out in that predatorial universe.\"\"What do you suggest I do to be safe, don Juan?\"\"Be on your toes every second! Don't let anything or anybody decide for you. Goto the inorganic beings' world only when you want to go.\"\"Honestly, don Juan, I wouldn't know how to do that. Once I isolate a scout, atremendous pull is exerted on me to go. I don't have a chance in hell to changemy mind.\"\"Come on! Who do you think you're kidding? You can definitely stop it. Youhaven't tried to, that's all.\"I earnestly insisted that it was impossible for me to stop. He did not pursuethe subject any longer, and I was thankful for that. A disturbing feeling ofguilt had begun to gnaw at me. For some unknown reason, the thought ofconsciously stopping the pull of the scouts had never occurred to me.As usual, don Juan was correct. I found out that I could change the course of mydreaming by intending that course. After all, I did intend for the scouts totransport me to their world. It was feasible that if I deliberately intended theopposite, my dreaming would follow the opposite course.With practice, my capacity to intend my journeys into the inorganic beings'realm became extraordinarily keen. An increased capacity to intend brought forthan increased control over my dreaming attention. This additional control made memore daring. I felt that I could journey with impunity, because I could stop thejourney any time I wanted to.\"Your confidence is very scary\" was don Juan's comment when I told him, at hisrequest, about the new aspect of my control over my dreaming attention.\"Why should it be scary?\" I asked. I was truly convinced of the practical valueof what I had found out.\"Because yours is the confidence of a fool,\" he said. \"I am going to tell you asorcerers' story that is apropos. [* apropos- of an appropriate or relevantnature] I didn't witness it myself, but my teacher's teacher, the nagual Elias,did.\"Don Juan said that the nagual Elias and the love of his life, a sorceress namedAmalia, were lost, in their youth, in the inorganic beings' world.I had never heard don Juan talk about sorcerers being the love of anybody'slife. His statement startled me. I asked him about this inconsistency.\"It's not an inconsistency. I have simply refrained all along from telling youstories of sorcerers' affection,\" he said. \"You've been so oversaturated withlove all your life that I wanted to give you a break.\"Well, the nagual Elias and the love of his life, the witch Amalia, got lost inthe inorganic beings' world,\" don Juan went on. \"They went there not in dreamingbut with their physical bodies.\"\"How did that happen, don Juan?\"\"Their teacher, the nagual Rosendo, was very close in temperament and practiceto the old sorcerers. He intended to help Elias and Amalia, but instead hepushed them across some deadly boundaries. The nagual Rosendo didn't have thatcrossing in mind. What he wanted to do was to put his two disciples into thesecond attention, but what he got as a result was their disappearance.\"Don Juan said that he was not going to go into the details of that long andcomplicated story. He was only going to tell me how they became lost in thatworld. He stated that the nagual Rosendo's miscalculation was to assume that theinorganic beings are not, in the slightest, interested in women. His reasoningwas correct and was guided by the sorcerers' knowledge that the universe ismarkedly female and that maleness, being an offshoot of femaleness, is almostscarce, thus, coveted.Don Juan made a digression and commented that perhaps that scarcity of males isthe reason for men's unwarranted dominion on our planet. I wanted to remain onthat topic, but he went ahead with his story. He said that the nagual Rosendo'splan was to give instruction to Elias and Amalia exclusively in the secondattention. And to that effect, he followed the old sorcerers' prescribedtechnique. He engaged a scout, in dreaming, and commanded it to transport hisdisciples into the second attention by displacing their assemblage points on theproper position.Theoretically, a powerful scout could displace their assemblage points on theproper position with no effort at all. What the nagual Rosendo did not take intoconsideration was the trickery of the inorganic beings. The scout did displacethe assemblage points of his disciples, but it displaced them on a position fromwhich it was easy to transport them bodily into the realm of the inorganicbeings.\"Is this possible, to be transported bodily?\" I asked.\"It is possible,\" he assured me. \"We are energy that is kept in a specific shapeand position by the fixation of the assemblage point on one location. If thatlocation is changed, the shape and position of that energy will changeaccordingly. All the inorganic beings have to do is to place our assemblagepoint on the right location, and off we go, like a bullet, shoes, hat, and all.\"\"Can this happen to any one of us, don Juan?\"\"Most certainly. Especially if our sum total of energy is right. Obviously, thesum total of the combined energies of Elias and Amalia was something theinorganic beings couldn't overlook. It is absurd to trust the inorganic beings.They have their own rhythm, and it isn't human.\"I asked don Juan what exactly the nagual Rosendo did to send his disciples tothat world. I knew it was stupid of me to ask, knowing that he was going toignore my question. My surprise was genuine when he began to tell me.\"The steps are simplicity itself,\" he said. \"He put his disciples inside a verysmall, closed space, something like a closet. Then he went into dreaming, calleda scout from the inorganic beings' realm by voicing his intent to get one, thenvoiced his intent to offer his disciples to the scout.\"The scout, naturally, accepted the gift and took them away, at an unguardedmoment, when they were making love inside that closet. When the nagual openedthe closet, they were no longer there.\"Don Juan explained that making gifts of their disciples to the inorganic beingswas precisely what the old sorcerers used to do. The nagual Rosendo did not meanto do that, but he got swayed by the absurd belief that the inorganic beingswere under his control.\"Sorcerers' maneuvers are deadly,\" don Juan went on. \"I beseech you to beextraordinarily aware. Don't get involved in having some idiotic confidence inyourself.\"\"What finally happened to the nagual Elias and Amalia?\" I asked.\"The nagual Rosendo had to go bodily into that world and look for them,\" hereplied.\"Did he find them?\"\"He did, after untold struggles. However, he could not totally bring them out.So the two young people were always semiprisoners of that realm.\"\"Did you know them, don Juan?\"\"Of course I knew them, and I assure you, they were very strange.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"6. The Shadows' World\"You must be extremely careful, for you are about to fall prey to the inorganicbeings,\" don Juan said to me, quite unexpectedly, after we had been talkingabout something totally unrelated to dreaming.His statement caught me by surprise. As usual, I attempted to defend myself.\"You don't have to warn me. I'm very careful,\" I assured him.\"The inorganic beings are plotting,\" he said. \"I sense that, and I can't consolemyself by saying that they set traps at the beginning and, in this manner,undesirable dreamers are effectively and permanently screened out.\"The tone of his voice was so urgent that I immediately had to reassure him I wasnot going to fall into any trap.\"You must seriously consider that the inorganic beings have astounding means attheir disposal,\" he went on. \"Their awareness is superb. In comparison, we arechildren, children with a lot of energy, which the inorganic beings covet.\"I wanted to tell him that, on an abstract level, I had understood his point andhis concern, but, on a concrete plane, I saw no reason for his warning, becauseI was in control of my dreaming practices.A few minutes of uneasy silence followed before don Juan spoke again. He changedthe subject and said that he had to bring to my attention a very important issueof his dreaming instruction, an issue that had, so far, bypassed my awareness.\"You already understand that the gates of dreaming are specific obstacles,\" hesaid, \"but you haven't understood yet that whatever is given as the exercise toreach and cross a gate is not really what that gate is all about.\"\"This is not clear to me at all, don Juan.\"\"I mean that it's not true to say, for example, that the second gate is reachedand crossed when a dreamer learns to wake up in another dream, or when a dreamerlearns to change dreams without waking up in the world of daily life.\"\"Why isn't it true, don Juan?\"\"Because the second gate of dreaming is reached and crossed only when a dreamerlearns to isolate and follow the foreign energy scouts.\"\"Why then is the idea of changing dreams given at all?\"\"Waking up in another dream or changing dreams is the drill devised by the oldsorcerers to exercise a dreamer's capacity to isolate and follow a scout.\"Don Juan stated that following a scout is a high accomplishment and that whendreamers are able to perform it, the second gate is flung open and the universethat exists behind it becomes accessible to them. He stressed that this universeis there all the time but that we cannot go into it because we lack energeticprowess and that, in essence, the second gate of dreaming is the door into theinorganic beings' world, and dreaming is the key that opens that door.\"Can a dreamer isolate a scout directly, without having to go through the drillof changing dreams?\" I asked.\"No, not at all,\" he said. \"The drill is essential. The question here is whetherthis is the only drill that exists. Or can a dreamer follow another drill?\"Don Juan looked at me quizzically. It seemed that he actually expected me toanswer the question.\"It's too difficult to come up with a drill as complete as the one the oldsorcerers devised,\" I said, without knowing why but with irrefutable authority.Don Juan admitted that I was absolutely right and said that the old sorcerershad devised a series of perfect drills to go through the gates of dreaming intothe specific worlds that exist behind every gate. He reiterated that dreaming,being the old sorcerers' invention, has to be played by their rules. Hedescribed the rule of the second gate in terms of a series of three steps: one,through practicing the drill of changing dreams, dreamers find out about thescouts; two, by following the scouts, they enter into another veritableuniverse; and three, in that universe, by means of their actions, dreamers findout, on their own, the governing laws and regulations of that universe.Don Juan said that in my dealings with the inorganic beings, I had followed therule so well that he feared devastating consequences. He thought that theunavoidable reaction on the part of the inorganic beings was going to be anattempt to keep me in their world.\"Don't you think that you are exaggerating, don Juan?\" I asked. I could notbelieve that the picture was as bleak as he was painting it.\"I am not exaggerating at all,\" he said, in a dry, serious tone. \"You'll see.The inorganic beings don't let anyone go, not without a real fight.\"\"But what makes you think they want me?\"\"They've already shown you too many things. Do you really believe that they aregoing to all this trouble just to entertain themselves?\"Don Juan laughed at his own remark. I did not find him amusing. A strange fearmade me ask him whether he thought I should interrupt or even discontinue mydreaming practices.\"You have to continue your dreaming until you have gone through the universebehind the second gate,\" he said. \"I mean that you alone must either accept orreject the lure of the inorganic beings. That is why I remain aloof and hardlyever comment on your dreaming practices.\"I confessed to him that I had been at a loss to explain why he was so generousin elucidating other aspects of his knowledge and so miserly with dreaming.\"I was forced to teach you dreaming,\" he said, \"only because that is the patternset out by the old sorcerers. The path of dreaming is filled with pitfalls, andto avoid those pitfalls or to fall into them is the personal and individualaffair of each dreamer, and I may add that it is a final affair.\"\"Are those pitfalls the result of succumbing to adulation or to promises ofpower?\" I asked.\"Not only succumbing to those, but succumbing to anything offered by theinorganic beings. There is no way for sorcerers to accept anything offered bythem, beyond a certain point.\"\"And what is that certain point, don Juan?\"\"That point depends on us as individuals. The challenge is for each of us totake only what is needed from that world, nothing more. To know what's needed isthe virtuosity of sorcerers, but to take only what's needed is their highestaccomplishment. To fail to understand this simple rule is the surest way ofplummeting into a pitfall.\"\"What happens if you fall, don Juan?\"\"If you fall, you pay the price, and the price depends on the circumstances andthe depth of the fall. But there is really no way of talking about aneventuality of this sort, because we are not facing a problem of punishment.Energetic currents are at stake here, energetic currents which createcircumstances that are more dreadful than death. Everything in the sorcerers'path is a matter of life or death, but in the path of dreaming this matter isenhanced a hundred fold.\"I reassured don Juan that I always exercised the utmost care in my dreamingpractices, and that I was extremely disciplined and conscientious.\"I know that you are,\" he said. \"But I want you to be even more disciplined andhandle everything related to dreaming with kid gloves. Be, above all, vigilant.I can't foretell where the attack will come from.\"\"Are you seeing, as a seer, imminent danger for me, don Juan?\"\"I have seen imminent danger for you since the day you walked in that mysteriouscity the first time I helped you round up your energy body.\"\"But do you know specifically what I should do and what I should avoid?\"\"No, I don't. I only know that the universe behind the second gate is theclosest to our own, and our own universe is pretty crafty and heartless. So thetwo can't be that different.\"I persisted in asking him to tell me what was in store for me. And he insistedthat, as a sorcerer, he sensed a state of general danger but that he could notbe more specific.\"The universe of the inorganic beings is always ready to strike,\" he went on.\"But so is our own universe. That's why you have to go into their realm exactlyas if you were venturing into a war zone.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that dreamers always have to be afraid of that world?\"\"No. I don't mean that. Once a dreamer goes through the universe behind thesecond gate, or once a dreamer refuses to consider it as a viable option, thereare no more headaches.\"Don Juan stated that only then are dreamers free to continue. I was not surewhat he meant; he explained that the universe behind the second gate is sopowerful and aggressive that it serves as a natural screen or a testing groundwhere dreamers are probed for their weaknesses. If they survive the tests, theycan proceed to the next gate; if they do not, they remain forever trapped inthat universe.I was left choking with anxiety but, in spite of my coaxing, that was all hesaid. When I went home, I continued my journeys to the inorganic beings' realm,exerting great care. My carefulness seemed only to increase my sense of enjoyingthose journeys. I got to the point that the mere contemplation of the inorganicbeings' world was enough to create an exultation impossible to describe. Ifeared that my delight was going to end sooner or later, but it was not so.Something unexpected made it even more intense.On one occasion, a scout guided me very roughly through countless tunnels, as ifsearching for something, or as if it were trying to draw all my energy out andexhaust me. By the time it finally stopped, I felt as if I had run a marathon. Iseemed to be at the edge of that world. There were no more tunnels, onlyblackness all around me. Then something lit up the area right in front of me.Light shone from an indirect source. It was a subdued light that renderedeverything diffusely gray or brownish. When I became used to the light, Ivaguely distinguished some dark, moving shapes. After a while, it seemed to methat focusing my dreaming attention on those moving shapes made themsubstantial. I noticed that there were three types: some of them were round,like balls; others were like bells; and others yet like gigantic, undulatingcandle flames. All of them were basically round and the same size. I judged thatthey were three to four feet in diameter. There were hundreds, perhaps eventhousands of them.I knew that I was having a strange, sophisticated vision, yet those shapes wereso real that I found myself reacting with genuine queasiness. I got thenauseating feeling of being over a nest of giant, round, brown and grayish bugs.I felt somehow safe, though, hovering above them. I discarded all theseconsiderations, however, the moment I realized that it was idiotic of me to feelsafe or ill at ease, as if my dream were a real-life situation. However, as Iobserved those buglike shapes squirm, I became very disturbed at the idea thatthey were about to touch me.\"We are the mobile unit of our world,\" the emissary's voice said, all of asudden. \"Don't be afraid. We are energy, and, for sure, we're not intending totouch you. It would be impossible anyway. We are separated by real boundaries.\"After a long pause, the voice added, \"We want you to join us. Come down to wherewe are. And don't be ill at ease. You are not ill at ease with the scouts andcertainly not with me. The scouts and I are just like the others. I ambell-shaped, and scouts are like candle flames.\"That last statement was definitely a cue of sorts for my energy body. On hearingit, my queasiness and fear vanished. I descended to their level, and the ballsand bells and candle flames surrounded me. They came so close to me that theywould have touched me had I had a physical body. Instead, we went through oneanother, like encapsulated air puffs.I had, at that point, an unbelievable sensation. Although I did not feelanything with or in my energy body, I was feeling and recording the most unusualtickling somewhere else; soft, airlike things were definitely going through me,but not right there. The sensation was vague and fast and did not give me timeto catch it fully. Instead of focusing my dreaming attention on it, I becameentirely absorbed in watching those oversized bugs of energy.At the level where we were, it seemed to me that there was a commonality betweenthe shadow entities and myself: size.Perhaps it was because I judged them to be the same size as my energy body thatI felt almost cozy with them. On examining them, I concluded that I did not mindthem at all. They were impersonal, cold, detached, and I liked that immensely. Iwondered for an instant whether my disliking them one minute and liking them thenext was a natural consequence of dreaming or a product of some energeticinfluence those entities were exerting on me.\"They are most likable,\" I said to the emissary, at the very moment I wasoverpowered by a wave of profound friendship or even affection for them.No sooner had I spoken my mind than the dark shapes scurried away, like bulkyguinea pigs, leaving me alone in semidarkness.\"You projected too much feeling and scared them off,\" the emissary's voice said.\"Feeling is too hard for them, and for me for that matter.\" The emissaryactually laughed shyly.My dreaming session ended there. On awakening, my first reaction was to pack mybag to go to Mexico and see don Juan. However, an unexpected development in mypersonal life made it impossible for me to travel, in spite of my franticpreparations to leave. The anxiety resulting from this setback interrupted mydreaming practices altogether. I did not engage my conscious volition to stopthem. I had unwittingly put so much emphasis on this specific dream that Isimply knew if I could not get to don Juan there was no point in continuingdreaming.After an interruption that lasted over half a year, I became more and moremystified by what had happened. I had no idea that my feelings alone were goingto stop my practices. I wondered then if the desire would be sufficient toreinstate it. It was! Once I had formulated the thought of reentering dreaming,my practices continued as if they had never been interrupted. The scout pickedup where we had left off and took me directly to the vision I'd had during mylast session.\"This is the shadows' world,\" the emissary's voice said as soon as I was there.\"But, even though we are shadows, we shed light. Not only are we mobile but weare the light in the tunnels. We are another kind of inorganic being that existshere. There are three kinds: one is like an immobile tunnel, the other is like amobile shadow. We are the mobile shadows. The tunnels give us their energy, andwe do their bidding.\"The emissary stopped talking. I felt it was daring me to ask about the thirdkind of inorganic being. I also felt that if I did not ask, the emissary wouldnot tell me.\"What's the third kind of inorganic being?\" I said.The emissary coughed and chuckled. To me, it sounded like it relished beingasked.\"Oh, that's our most mysterious feature,\" it said. \"The third kind is revealedto our visitors only when they choose to stay with us.\"\"Why is that so?\" I asked.\"Because it takes a great deal of energy to see them,\" the emissary answered.\"And we would have to provide that energy.\"I knew that the emissary was telling me the truth. I also knew that a horrendousdanger was lurking. Yet I was driven by a curiosity without limits. I wanted tosee that third kind.The emissary seemed to be aware of my mood.\"Would you like to see them?\" it asked casually.\"Most certainly,\" I said.\"All you have to do is to say out loud that you want to stay with us,\" theemissary said with a nonchalant intonation.\"But if I say that, I have to stay, right?\" I asked.\"Naturally,\" the emissary said in a tone of ultimate conviction. \"Everything yousay out loud in this world is for keeps.\"I could not help thinking that, if the emissary had wanted to trick me intostaying, all it had to do was lie to me. I would not have known the difference.\"I cannot lie to you, because a lie doesn't exist,\" the emissary said, intrudinginto my thoughts. \"I can tell you only about what exists. In my world, onlyintent exists; a lie has no intent behind it; therefore, it has no existence.\"I wanted to argue that there is intent even behind lies, but before I couldvoice my argument, the emissary said that behind lies there is intention butthat that intention is not intent.I could not keep my dreaming attention focused on the argument the emissary wasposing. It went to the shadow beings. Suddenly, I noticed that they had theappearance of a herd of strange, childlike animals. The emissary's voice warnedme to hold my emotions in check, for sudden bursts of feelings had the capacityto make them disperse, like a flock of birds.\"What do you want me to do?\" I asked.\"Come down to our side and try to push or pull us,\" the emissary's voice urgedme. \"The quicker you learn to do that, the quicker you'll be able to move thingsaround in your world by merely looking at them.\"My merchant's mind went berserk with anticipation. I was instantly among them,desperately trying to push them or pull them. After a while, I thoroughlyexhausted my energy. I then had the impression that I had been trying to dosomething equivalent to lifting a house with the strength of my teeth.Another impression I had was that the more I exerted myself, the greater thenumber of shadows. It was as if they were coming from every corner to watch me,or to feed on me. The moment I had that thought, the shadows again scurriedaway.\"We are not feeding on you,\" the emissary said. \"We all come to feel yourenergy, very much like what you do with sunlight on a cold day.\"The emissary urged me to open up to them by canceling out my suspiciousthoughts. I heard the voice, and as I listened to what it was saying, I realizedthat I was hearing, feeling, and thinking exactly as I do in my daily world. Islowly turned to see around me. Taking the clarity of my perception as a gauge,I concluded that I was in a real world.The emissary's voice sounded in my ears. It said that for me the only differencebetween perceiving my world and perceiving theirs was that perceiving theirworld started and ended in the blink of an eye; perceiving mine did not, becausemy awareness- together with the awareness of an immense number of beings like mewho held my world in place with their intent- was fixed on my world. Theemissary added that perceiving my world started and ended the same way for theinorganic beings, in the blink of an eye, but perceiving their world did not,because there were immense numbers of them holding it in place with theirintent.At that instant the scene started to dissolve. I was like a diver, and waking upfrom that world was like swimming up to reach the surface. In the following session, the emissary began its dialogue with me by restatingthat a totally coordinated and coactive relationship existed between mobileshadows and stationary tunnels. It finished its statement saying, \"We can'texist without each other.\"\"I understand what you mean,\" I said.There was a touch of scorn in the emissary's voice when it retorted that I couldnot possibly understand what it means to be related in that fashion, which wasinfinitely more than being dependent. I intended to ask the emissary to explainwhat it meant by that, but the next instant I was inside of what I can onlydescribe as the very tissue of the tunnel. I saw some grotesquely merged,glandlike protuberances that emitted an opaque light. The thought crossed mymind that those were the same protuberances that had given me the impression ofbeing like Braille. Considering that they were energy blobs three to four feetin diameter, I began to wonder about the actual size of those tunnels.\"Size here is not like size in your world,\" the emissary said. \"The energy ofthis world is a different kind of energy; its features don't coincide with thefeatures of the energy of your world, yet this world is as real as your own.\"The emissary went on to say that it had told me everything about the shadowbeings when it described and explained the protuberances on the tunnels' walls.I retorted that I had heard the explanations but I had not paid attention tothem because I believed that they did not pertain directly to dreaming.\"Everything here, in this realm, pertains directly to dreaming,\" the emissarystated.I wanted to think about the reason for my misjudgment, but my mind became blank.My dreaming attention was waning. I was having trouble focusing it on the worldaround me. I braced myself for waking up. The emissary started to speak again,and the sound of its voice propped me up. My dreaming attention perked upconsiderably.\"Dreaming is the vehicle that brings dreamers to this world,\" the emissary said,\"and everything sorcerers know about dreaming was taught to them by us. Ourworld is connected to yours by a door called dreams. We know how to go throughthat door, but men don't. They have to learn it.\"The emissary's voice went on explaining what it had already explained to mebefore.\"The protuberances on the tunnels' walls are shadow beings,\" it said. \"I am oneof them. We move inside the tunnels, on their walls, charging ourselves with theenergy of the tunnels, which is our energy.\"An idle thought crossed my mind: I was really incapable of conceiving asymbiotic relationship such as the one I was witnessing.\"If you would stay among us, you would certainly learn to feel what it is liketo be connected as we are connected,\" the emissary said.The emissary seemed to be waiting for my reply. I had the feeling that what itreally wanted was for me to say that I had decided to stay.\"How many shadow beings are in each tunnel?\" I asked to change the mood andimmediately regretted it because the emissary began to give me a detailedaccount of the numbers and functions of the shadow beings in each tunnel. Itsaid that each tunnel had a specific number of dependent entities, whichperformed specific functions having to do with the needs and expectations of thesupporting tunnels.I did not want the emissary to go into more detail. I reasoned that the less Iknew about the tunnel and shadow beings the better off I was. The instant Iformulated that thought, the emissary stopped, and my energy body jerked as ifit had been pulled by a cable. The next moment, I was fully awake, in my bed. From then on, I had no more fears that could have interrupted my practices.Another idea had begun to rule me: the idea that I had found unparalleledexcitation. I could hardly wait every day to start dreaming and have the scouttake me to the shadows' world. The added attraction was that my visions of theshadows' world became even more true to life than before. Judged by thesubjective standards of orderly thoughts, orderly visual and auditory sensoryinput, orderly responses on my part, my experiences, for as long as they lasted,were as real as any situation in our daily world. Never had I had perceptualexperiences in which the only difference between my visions and my everydayworld was the speed with which my visions ended. One instant I was in a strange,real world, and the next instant I was in my bed.I craved don Juan's commentaries and explanations, but I was still marooned inLos Angeles. The more I considered my situation, the greater my anxiety: I evenbegan to sense that something in the inorganic beings' realm was brewing attremendous speed.As my anxiety grew, my body entered into a state of profound fright, although mymind was ecstatic in the contemplation of the shadows' world. To make thingsworse, the dreaming emissary's voice lapsed into my daily consciousness. One daywhile I was attending a class at the university, I heard the voice say, over andover, that any attempt on my part to end my dreaming practices would bedeleterious to my total aims. It argued that warriors do not shy away from achallenge and that I had no valid rationale for discontinuing my practices. Iagreed with the emissary. I had no intention of stopping anything, and the voicewas merely reaffirming what I felt.Not only did the emissary change but a new scout appeared on the scene. On oneoccasion, before I had begun to examine the items of my dream, a scout hadliterally jumped in front of me and aggressively captured my dreaming attention.The notable feature of this scout was that it did not need to go through anyenergetic metamorphosis. It was a blob of energy from the start. In the blink ofan eye, the scout transported me, without my having to voice my intent to gowith it, to another part of the inorganic beings' realm: the world of thesaber-toothed tigers.I have described in my other works glimpses of those visions. I say glimpsesbecause I did not have sufficient energy then to render these perceived worldscomprehensible to my linear mind.My nightly visions of the saber-toothed tigers occurred regularly for a longtime, until one night when the aggressive scout that had taken me for the firsttime to that realm suddenly appeared again. Without waiting for my consent, ittook me to the tunnels.I heard the emissary's voice. It immediately went into the longest and mostpoignant sales pitch I had heard so far. It told me about the extraordinaryadvantages of the inorganic beings' world. It spoke of acquiring knowledge thatwould definitely stagger the mind and about acquiring it by the simplest act, ofstaying in those marvelous tunnels. It spoke of incredible mobility, of endlesstime to find things, and, above all, of being pampered by cosmic servants thatwould cater to my slightest whims.\"Aware beings from the most unbelievable corners of the cosmos stay with us,\"the emissary said, ending its talk. \"And they love their stay with us. In fact,no one wants to leave.\"The thought that crossed my mind at that moment was that servitude wasdefinitely antithetical [* antithetical- sharply contrasted in character orpurpose] to me. I had never been at ease with servants or with being served.The scout took over and made me glide through many tunnels. It came to a halt ina tunnel that seemed somehow larger than the others. My dreaming attentionbecame riveted on the size and configuration of that tunnel, and it would havestayed glued there had I not been made to turn around. My dreaming attentionfocused then on a blob of energy a bit bigger than the shadow entities. It wasblue, like the blue in the center of a candle's flame. I knew that this energyconfiguration was not a shadow entity and that it did not belong there.I became absorbed in sensing it. The scout signaled me to leave, but somethingwas making me impervious to its cues. I remained, uneasily, where I was.However, the scout's signaling broke my concentration, and I lost sight of theblue shape.Suddenly, a considerable force made me spin around and put me squarely in frontof the blue shape. As I gazed at it, it turned into the figure of a person: verysmall, slender, delicate, almost transparent. I desperately attempted todetermine whether it was a man or a woman, but, hard as I tried, I could not.My attempts to ask the emissary failed. It flew away quite abruptly, leaving mesuspended in that tunnel, facing now an unknown person. I tried to talk to thatperson the way I talked to the emissary. I got no response. I felt a wave offrustration at not being able to break the barrier that separated us. Then I wasbesieged by the fear of being alone with someone who might have been an enemy.I had a variety of reactions triggered by the presence of that stranger. I evenfelt elation, because I knew that the scout had finally shown me another humanbeing caught in that world. I only despaired at the possibility that we were notable to communicate perhaps because that stranger was one of the sorcerers ofantiquity and belonged to a time different from mine.The more intense my elation and curiosity, the heavier I became, until a momentin which I was so massive that I was back in my body, and back in the world. Ifound myself in Los Angeles, in a park by the University of California. I wasstanding on the grass, right in the line of people playing golf.The person in front of me had solidified at the same rate. We stared at eachother for a fleeting instant. It was a girl, perhaps six or seven years old. Ithought I knew her. On seeing her, my elation and curiosity grew so out ofproportion that they triggered a reversal. I lost mass so fast that in anotherinstant I was again a blob of energy in the inorganic beings' realm. The scoutcame back for me and hurriedly pulled me away.I woke up with a jolt of fright. In the process of surfacing into the dailyworld, something had let a message slip through. My mind went into a frenzytrying to put together what I knew or thought I knew. I spent more thanforty-eight continuous hours attempting to get at a hidden feeling or a hiddenknowledge that had gotten stuck to me. The only success I had was to sense aforce- I fancied it to be outside my mind or my body- that told me not to trustmy dreaming anymore.After a few days, a dark and mysterious certainty began to get hold of me, acertainty that grew by degrees until I had no doubt about its authenticity: Iwas sure that the blue blob of energy was a prisoner in the inorganic beings'realm.I needed don Juan's advice more desperately than ever. I knew that I wasthrowing years of work out the window, but I couldn't help it: I droppedeverything I was doing and ran to Mexico.\"What do you really want?\" don Juan asked me as a way to contain my hystericalbabbling.I could not explain to him what I wanted because I did not know it myself.\"Your problem must be very serious to make you run like this,\" don Juan saidwith a pensive expression.\"It is, in spite of the fact that I can't figure out what my problem really is,\"I said.He asked me to describe my dreaming practices in all the detail that waspertinent. I told him about my vision of the little girl and how it had affectedme at an emotional level. He instantly advised me to ignore the event and regardit as a blatant attempt, on the part of the inorganic beings, to cater to myfantasies. He remarked that if dreaming is overemphasized, it becomes what itwas for the old sorcerers: a source of inexhaustible indulging.For some inexplicable reason, I was unwilling to tell don Juan about the realmof the shadow entities. It was only when he discarded my vision of the littlegirl that I felt obliged to describe to him my visits to that world. He wassilent for a long time, as if he were overwhelmed.When he finally spoke, he said, \"You are more alone than I thought, because Ican't discuss your dreaming practices at all. You are at the position of the oldsorcerers. All I can do is to repeat to you that you must exercise all the careyou arc able to muster up.\"\"Why do you say that I am at the position of the old sorcerers?\"\"I've told you repeatedly that your mood is dangerously like the old sorcerers'.They were very capable beings. Their flaw was that they took to the inorganicbeings' realm like fish take to the water. You are in the same boat. You knowthings about it that none of us can even conceive. For instance, I never knewabout the shadows' world, and neither did the nagual Julian. Nor did the nagualElias, in spite of the fact that he spent a long time in the world of theinorganic beings.\"\"But what difference does knowing the shadows' world make?\"\"A great deal of difference. Dreamers are taken there only when the inorganicbeings are sure the dreamers are going to stay in that world. We know thisthrough the old sorcerers' stories.\"\"I assure you, don Juan, that I have no intention whatsoever of staying there.You talk as if I am just about to be lured by promises of service or promises ofpower. I am not interested in either, and that's that.\"\"At this level, it isn't that easy anymore. You've gone beyond the point whereyou could simply quit. Besides, you had the misfortune of being singled out by awatery inorganic being. Remember how you tumbled with it? And how it felt? Itold you then that watery inorganic beings are the most annoying. They aredependent and possessive, and once they sink their hooks, they never give up.\"\"And what does that mean in my case, don Juan?\"\"It means real trouble. The specific inorganic being who's running the show isthe one you grabbed that fatal day. Over the years, it has grown familiar withyou. It knows you intimately.\"I sincerely remarked to don Juan that the mere idea that an inorganic being knewme intimately made me sick to my stomach.\"When dreamers realize that the inorganic beings have no appeal,\" he said, \"itis usually too late for them, because by then the inorganic beings have them inthe bag.\"I felt in the depths of me that he was talking abstractly, about dangers thatmight exist theoretically but not in practice. I was secretly convinced therewas no danger of any sort.\"I am not going to allow the inorganic beings to lure me in any way, if that'swhat you're thinking,\" I said.\"I am thinking that they are going to trick you,\" he said. \"Like they trickedthe nagual Rosendo. They are going to set you up, and you won't see the trap oreven suspect it. They are smooth operators. Now they have even invented a littlegirl.\"\"But there is no doubt in my mind that the little girl exists,\" I insisted.\"There is no little girl,\" he snapped. \"That bluish blob of energy is a scout;an explorer caught in the inorganic beings' realm. I've said to you that theinorganic beings are like fishermen: They attract and catch awareness.\"Don Juan said that he believed, without a doubt, that the bluish blob of energywas from a dimension entirely different from ours; a scout that got stranded andcaught like a fly in a spider's web.I did not appreciate his analogy. It worried me to the point of physicaldiscomfort. I did mention this to don Juan, and he told me that my concern withthe prisoner scout was making him feel very close to despair.\"Why does this bother you?\" I asked.\"Something is brewing in that confounded world,\" he said. \"And I can't figureout what it is.\"While I remained with don Juan and his companions, I did not dream at all aboutthe inorganic beings' world. As usual, my practice was to focus my dreamingattention on the items of my dreams and to change dreams. As a way to offset myconcerns, don Juan made me gaze at clouds and at faraway mountain peaks. Theresult was an immediate feeling of being level with the clouds, or the feelingthat I was actually at the faraway mountain peaks.\"I am very pleased, but very worried,\" don Juan said as a comment on my effort.\"You are being taught marvels, and you don't even know it. And I don't mean thatyou are being taught by me.\"\"You are talking about the inorganic beings, true?\"\"Yes, the inorganic beings. I recommend that you don't gaze at anything; gazingwas the old sorcerers' technique. They were able to get to their energy bodiesin the blink of an eye, simply by gazing at objects of their predilection. Avery impressive technique, but useless to modern sorcerers. It does nothing toincrease our sobriety or our capacity to seek freedom. All it does is pin usdown to concreteness; a most undesirable state.\"Don Juan added that, unless I kept myself in check, by the time I had merged thesecond attention with the attention of my everyday life, I was going to be aninsufferable man. There was, he said, a dangerous gap between my mobility in thesecond attention and my insistence on immobility in my awareness of the dailyworld. He remarked that the gap between the two was so great that in my dailystate I was nearly an idiot, and in the second attention I was a lunatic.Before I went home, I took the liberty of discussing my dreaming visions of theshadows' world with Carol Tiggs, although don Juan had advised me not to discussthem with anybody. She was most understanding and most interested, since she wasmy total counterpart. Don Juan was definitely annoyed with me for havingrevealed my troubles to her. I felt worse than ever. Self-pity possessed me, andI began to complain about always doing the wrong thing.\"You haven't done anything yet,\" don Juan snapped at me. \"That much, I know.\"Was he right! On my next dreaming session, at home, all hell broke loose. Ireached the shadows' world, as I had done on countless occasions: The differencewas the presence of the blue energy shape. It was among the other shadow beings.I felt it was possible that the blob had been there before and I hadn't noticedit. As soon as I spotted it, my dreaming attention was inescapably attracted tothat blob of energy. In a matter of seconds, I was next to it. The other shadowscame to me, as usual, but I paid no attention to them.All of a sudden, the blue, round shape turned into the little girl I had seenbefore. She craned her thin, delicate, long neck to one side and said in abarely audible whisper, \"Help me!\" Either she said that or I fantasized that shesaid it. The result was the same: I stood frozen, galvanized by genuine concern.I experienced a chill, but not in my energy mass. I felt a chill in another partof me. This was the first time I was completely aware that my experience wasthoroughly separate from my sensorial feelings. I was experiencing the shadows'world, with all the implications of what I normally consider experiencing: I wasable to think, to assess, to make decisions; I had psychological continuity; inother words, I was myself. The only part of me that was missing was my sensorialself. I had no bodily sensations. All my input came through seeing and hearing.My rationality then considered a strange dilemma: seeing and hearing were notphysical faculties but qualities of the visions I was having.\"You are really seeing and hearing,\" the emissary's voice said, erupting into mythoughts. \"That is the beauty of this place. You can experience everythingthrough seeing and hearing, without having to breathe. Think of it! You don'thave to breathe! You can go anywhere in the universe and not breathe.\"A most disquieting ripple of emotion went through me, and, again, I did not feelit there, in the shadows' world. I felt it in another place. I became enormouslyagitated by the obvious yet veiled realization that there was a live connectionbetween the me that was experiencing and a source of energy, a source ofsensorial feeling located somewhere else. It occurred to me that this somewhereelse was my actual physical body, which was asleep in my bed.At the instant of this thought, the shadow beings scurried away, and the littlegirl was alone in my field of vision. I watched her and became convinced that Iknew her. She seemed to falter as if she were about to faint. A boundless waveof affection for her enveloped me.I tried to speak to her, but I was incapable of uttering sounds. It became clearto me then that all my dialogues with the emissary had been elicited andaccomplished by the emissary's energy. Left to my own devices, I was helpless. Iattempted next to direct my thoughts to the little girl. It was useless. We wereseparated by a membrane of energy I could not pierce.The little girl seemed to understand my despair and actually communicated withme, directly into my thoughts. She told me, essentially, what don Juan hadalready said: that she was a scout caught in the webs of that world. Then sheadded that she had adopted the shape of a little girl because that shape wasfamiliar to me and to her; and that she needed my help as much as I needed hers.She said this to me in one clump of energetic feeling, which was like words thatcame to me all at once. I had no difficulty understanding her, although this wasthe first time anything of the sort had happened to me.I did not know what to do. I tried to convey to her my sensation of incapacity.She seemed to comprehend me instantly. She silently appealed to me with aburning look. She even smiled as if to let me know that she had left it up to meto extricate her from her bonds. When I retorted, in a thought, that I had noabilities whatsoever, she gave me the impression of a hysterical child in thethroes of despair.I frantically tried to talk to her. The little girl actually cried, like a childher age would cry, out of desperation and fear. I couldn't stand it. I chargedat her, but with no effective result. My energy mass went through her. My ideawas to lift her up and take her with me.I attempted the same maneuver over and over until I was exhausted. I stopped toconsider my next move. I was afraid that my dreaming attention was going towane, and then I would lose sight of her. I doubted that the inorganic beingswould bring me back to that specific part of their realm. It seemed to me thatthis was going to be my last visit to them: the visit that counted.Then I did something unthinkable. Before my dreaming attention vanished, Iyelled loud and clear my intent to merge my energy with the energy of thatprisoner scout and set it free. ================================================================= "},{"pageContent":"7. The Blue ScoutI was dreaming an utterly nonsensical dream. Carol Tiggs was by my side. She wasspeaking to me, although I could not understand what she said. Don Juan was alsoin my dream, as were all the members of his party. They seemed to be trying todrag me out of a foggy, yellowish world.After a serious effort, during which I lost and regained sight of them varioustimes, they succeeded in extricating me from that place. Since I could notconceive the sense of all that endeavor, I finally figured that I was having anormal, incoherent dream.My surprise was staggering when I woke up and found myself in bed, in don Juan'shouse. I was incapable of moving. I had no energy at all. I did not know what tothink, although I immediately sensed the gravity of my situation. I had thevague feeling that I had lost my energy because of fatigue caused by dreaming.Don Juan's companions seemed to be extremely affected by whatever was happeningto me. They kept on coming into my room, one at a time. Each stayed for amoment, in complete silence, until someone else showed up. It appeared to methat they were taking turns watching over me. I was too weak to ask them toexplain their behavior.During the subsequent days, I began to feel better, and they started to talk tome about my dreaming. At first, I did not know what they wanted of me. Then itdawned on me, because of their questions, that they were obsessed with theshadow beings. Every one of them appeared to be scared and said to me more orless the same thing. They insisted that they had never been in the shadows'world. Some of them even claimed that they did not know it existed. Their claimsand reactions increased my sense of bewilderment and my fear.The questions everyone asked were, \"Who took you into that world? Or how did youeven begin to know how to get there?\" When I told them that the scouts had shownme that world, they could not believe me. Obviously, they had surmised that Ihad been there, but since it was not possible for them to use their personalexperience as a reference point, they were unable to fathom what I was saying.Yet they still wanted to know all I could tell them about the shadow beings andtheir realm. I obliged them. All of them, with the exception of don Juan, sat bymy bed, hanging on every word I said. However, every time I asked them about mysituation, they scurried away, just like the shadow beings.Another disturbing reaction, which they never had before, was that theyfrantically avoided any physical contact with me. They kept their distance, asif I were carrying the plague. Their reaction worried me so much that I feltobliged to ask them about it. They denied it. They seemed insulted and even wentso far as to insist on proving to me that I was wrong. I laughed heartily at thetense situation that ensued. Their bodies went rigid every time they tried toembrace me.Florinda Grau, don Juan's closest cohort, was the only member of his party wholavished physical attention on me and tried to explain to me what was going on.She told me that I had been discharged of energy in the inorganic beings' worldand charged again, but that my new energetic charge was a bit disturbing to themajority of them.Florinda used to put me to bed every night, as if I were an invalid. She evenspoke to me in baby talk, which all of them celebrated with gales of laughter.But regardless of how she made fun of me, I appreciated her concern, whichseemed to be real.I have written about Florinda before in connection with my meeting her. She wasby far the most beautiful woman I had ever met. Once I said to her, and I reallymeant it, that she could have been a fashion magazine model.\"Of a magazine of nineteen ten,\" she retorted.Florinda, although she was old, was not old at all. She was young and vibrant.When I asked don Juan about her unusual youthfulness, he replied that sorcerykept her in a vital state. Sorcerers' energy, he remarked, was seen by the eyeas youth and vigor.After satisfying their initial curiosity about the shadows' world, don Juan'scompanions stopped coming into my room, and their conversation remained at thelevel of casual inquiries about my health. Every time I tried to get up,however, there was someone around who gently put me back to bed. I did not wanttheir ministrations, yet it seemed that I needed them; I was weak. I acceptedthat. But what really took its toll on me was not having anyone explain to mewhat I was doing in Mexico when I had gone to bed to dream in Los Angeles. Iasked them repeatedly. Every one of them gave me the same answer, \"Ask thenagual. He's the only one who can explain it.\"Finally, Florinda broke the ice. \"You were lured into a trap: That's whathappened to you,\" she said.\"Where was I lured into a trap?\"\"In the world of the inorganic beings, of course. That has been the world you'vebeen dealing with for years. Isn't that so?\"\"Most definitely, Florinda. But can you tell me about the kind of trap it was?\"\"Not really. All I can tell you is that you lost all your energy there. But youfought very well.\"\"Why am I sick, Florinda?\"\"You are not sick with an illness: You were energetically wounded. You werecritical, but now you are only gravely wounded.\"\"How did all this happen?\"\"You entered into a mortal combat with the inorganic beings, and you weredefeated.\"\"I don't remember fighting anyone, Florinda.\"\"Whether you remember or not is immaterial. You fought and were outclassed. Youdidn't have a chance against those masterful manipulators.\"\"I fought the inorganic beings?\"\"Yes. You had a mortal encounter with them. I really don't know how you havesurvived their death blow.\"She refused to tell me anything else and hinted that the nagual was coming tosee me any day.The next day don Juan showed up. He was very jovial and supportive. He jokinglyannounced that he was paying me a visit in his capacity of energy doctor. Heexamined me by gazing at me from head to toe.\"You're almost cured,\" he concluded.\"What happened to me, don Juan?\" I asked.\"You fell into a trap the inorganic beings set for you,\" he answered.\"How did I end up here?\"\"Right there is the big mystery, for sure,\" he said and smiled jovially,obviously trying to make light of a serious matter. \"The inorganic beingssnatched you, body and all. First they took your energy body into their realmwhen you followed one of their scouts; and then they took your physical body.\"Don Juan's companions seemed to be in a state of shock. One of them asked donJuan whether the inorganic beings could abduct anyone. Don Juan answered thatthey certainly could. He reminded them that the nagual Elias was taken into thatuniverse, and he definitely did not intend to go there.All of them assented with a nod. Don Juan continued speaking to them, referringto me in the third person. He said that the combined awareness of a group ofinorganic beings had first consumed my energy body by forcing an emotionaloutburst from me: to free the blue scout. Then the combined awareness of thesame group of inorganic beings had pulled my inert physical mass into theirworld. Don Juan added that without the energy body one is merely a lump oforganic matter that can be easily manipulated by awareness.\"The inorganic beings are glued together, like the cells of the body,\" don Juanwent on. \"When they put their awareness together, they are unbeatable. It'snothing for them to yank us out of our moorings and plunge us into their world.Especially if we make ourselves conspicuous and available, like he did.\"Their sighs and gasps echoed against the walls. All of them seemed to begenuinely frightened and concerned.I wanted to whine and blame don Juan for not stopping me, but I remembered howhe had tried to warn me, to deviate me, time and time again, to no avail. DonJuan was definitely aware of what was going on in my mind. He gave a knowingsmile.\"The reason you think you're sick,\" he said, addressing me, \"is that theinorganic beings discharged your energy and gave you theirs. That should havebeen enough to kill anyone. As the nagual, you have extra energy; therefore, youbarely survived.\"I mentioned to don Juan that I remembered bits and pieces of quite an incoherentdream, in which I was in a yellow-fogged world. He, Carol Tiggs, and hiscompanions were pulling me out.\"The inorganic beings' realm looks like a yellow fog world to the physical eye,\"he said. \"When you thought you were having an incoherent dream, you wereactually looking with your physical eyes for the first time at the inorganicbeings' universe. And, strange as it may seem to you, it was also the first timefor us. We knew about the fog only through sorcerers' stories, not throughexperience.\"Nothing of what he was saying made sense to me. Don Juan assured me that becauseof my lack of energy, a more complete explanation was impossible. I had to besatisfied, he said, with what he was telling me and how I understood it.\"I don't understand it at all,\" I insisted.\"Then you haven't lost anything,\" he said. \"When you get stronger, you yourselfwill answer your questions.\"I confessed to don Juan that I was having hot flashes. My temperature would risesuddenly, and while I felt hot and sweaty, I had extraordinary but disturbinginsights into my situation.Don Juan scanned my entire body with his penetrating gaze. He said that I was ina state of energetic shock. Losing energy had temporarily affected me, and whatI interpreted as hot flashes were, in essence, blasts of energy during which Imomentarily regained control of my energy body and knew everything that hadhappened to me.\"Make an effort, and tell me yourself what happened to you in the inorganicbeings' world,\" he ordered me.I told him that the clear sensation I got, from time to time, was that he andhis companions had gone into that world with their physical bodies and hadsnatched me out of the inorganic beings' clutches.\"Right!\" he exclaimed. \"You're doing fine. Now, turn that sensation into a viewof what happened.\"I was unable to do what he wanted, hard as I tried. Failing made me experiencean unusual fatigue which seemed to dry up the inside of my body. Before don Juanleft the room, I remarked to him that I was suffering from anxiety.\"That means nothing,\" he said, unconcerned. \"Gain back your energy, and don'tworry about nonsense.\"More than two weeks went by, during which I slowly gained back my energy.However, I kept on worrying about everything. I worried mainly about beingunknown to myself, especially about a streak of coldness in me that I had notnoticed before; a sort of indifference; a detachment that I had attributed to mylack of energy until I regained it. Then I realized that detachment was a newfeature of my being; a feature that had me permanently out of synchronization.To elicit the feelings I was accustomed to, I had to summon them up and actuallywait a moment until they made their appearance in my mind.Another new feature of my being was a strange longing that took hold of me fromtime to time. I longed for someone I did not know. It was such an overpoweringand consuming feeling that when I experienced it, I had to move around the roomincessantly to alleviate it. The longing remained with me until I made use ofanother newcomer in my life: a rigid control of myself so new and powerful thatit only added more fuel to my worrying.By the end of the fourth week, everybody felt that I was finally cured. They cutdown their visits drastically. I spent much of the time alone, sleeping. Therest and relaxation I was getting was so complete that my energy began toincrease remarkably. I felt like my old self again. I even began to exercise.One day around noon, after a light lunch, I returned to my room to take a nap.Just before I sank into a deep sleep, I was tossing in my bed trying to find amore comfortable spot, when a strange pressure on my temples made me open myeyes. The little girl of the inorganic beings' world was standing by the foot ofmy bed, peering at me with her cold, steel blue eyes.I jumped out of bed and screamed so loudly that three of don Juan's companionswere in the room before I had stopped my scream. They were aghast. They watchedin horror as the little girl came to me and was stopped by the boundaries of myluminous physical being. We looked at each other for an eternity. She wastelling me something, which I could not comprehend at first but which in thenext moment became as clear as a bell. She said that for me to understand whatshe was saying, my awareness had to be transferred from my physical body into myenergy body.Don Juan came into the room at that moment. The little girl and don Juan staredat each other. Without a word, don Juan turned around and walked out of theroom. The little girl swished past the door after him. The commotion this scenecreated among don Juan's companions was indescribable. They lost all theircomposure. Apparently, all of them had seen the little girl as she left the roomwith the nagual.I myself seemed to be on the verge of exploding. I felt faint and had to sitdown. I had experienced the presence of the little girl as a blow on my solarplexus. She bore an astonishing likeness to my father. Waves of sentiment hitme. I wondered about the meaning of this until I was actually sick.When don Juan returned to the room, I had gained minimal control over myself.The expectation of hearing what he had to say about the little girl was makingmy breathing very difficult. Everybody was as excited as I was. They all talkedto don Juan at once and laughed when they realized what they were doing. Theirmain interest was to find out whether there was any uniformity in the way theyhad perceived the scout's appearance. Everybody was in agreement that they hadseen a little girl, six to seven years old, very thin, with angular, beautifulfeatures. They also agreed that her eyes were steel blue and burning with a muteemotion: Her eyes, they said, expressed gratitude and loyalty.Every detail they described about the little girl I corroborated myself. Hereyes were so bright and overpowering that they had actually caused me somethinglike pain. I had felt the weight of her look on my chest.A serious query, which don Juan's companions had and which I echoed myself, wasabout the implications of this event. All agreed that the scout was a portion offoreign energy that had filtered through the walls separating the secondattention and the attention of the daily world. They asserted that; since theywere not dreaming and yet all of them had seen the alien energy projected intothe figure of a human child; that child had existence.They argued that there must have been hundreds, if not thousands, of cases inwhich foreign energy slips unnoticed through natural barriers into our humanworld, but that in the history of their lineage there was no mention whatsoeverof an event of this nature. What worried them the most was that there were nosorcerers' stories about it.\"Is this the first time in the history of mankind that this has happened?\" oneof them asked don Juan.\"I think it happens all the time,\" he replied, \"but it has never happened insuch an overt, volitional way.\"\"What does it mean to us?\" another one of them asked don Juan.\"Nothing to us, but everything to him,\" he said and pointed at me.All of them then entered into a most disturbing silence. Don Juan paced back andforth for a moment. Then he stopped in front of me and peered at me, giving allthe indications of someone who cannot find words to express an overwhelmingrealization.\"I can't even begin to assess the scope of what you've done,\" don Juan finallysaid to me in a tone of bewilderment. \"You fell into a pitfall, but it wasn'tthe kind of pitfall I was worrying about. Your pitfall was designed for youalone, and it was deadlier than anything I could have thought of. I worriedabout your falling prey to flattery and being served. What I never counted onwas that the shadow beings would set a trap using your inherent aversion tochains.\"Don Juan had once made a comparison of his reaction and mine, in the sorcerers'world, to the things that pressed us the most. He said, without making it soundlike a complaint, that although he wanted and tried to, he had never been ableto inspire the kind of affection his teacher, the nagual Julian, inspired inpeople.\"My unbiased reaction, which I am putting on the table for you to examine, is tobe able to say, and mean it: it's not my fate to evoke blind and totalaffection. So be it!\"\"Your unbiased reaction,\" he went on, \"is that you can't stand chains, and youwould forfeit your life to break them.\"I sincerely disagreed with him and told him that he was exaggerating. My viewswere not that clear.\"Don't worry,\" he said laughing, \"sorcery is action. When the time comes, you'llact your passion the same way I act mine. Mine is to acquiesce to my fate, notpassively, like an idiot, but actively, like a warrior. Yours is to jump withouteither capriciousness or premeditation to cut someone else's chains.\"Don Juan explained that upon merging my energy with the scout I had truthfullyceased to exist. All my physicalness had then been transported into theinorganic beings' realm and, had it not been for the scout who guided don Juanand his companions to where I was, I would have died or remained in that world,inextricably lost.\"Why did the scout guide you to where I was?\" I asked.\"The scout is a sentient being from another dimension,\" he said. \"It's a littlegirl now, and as such she told me that in order to get the necessary energy tobreak the barrier that had trapped her in the inorganic beings' world, she hadto take all of yours. That's her human part now. Something resembling gratitudedrove her to me. When I saw her, I knew instantly that you were done for.\"\"What did you do then, don Juan?\"\"I rounded up everyone I could get hold of, especially Carol Tiggs, and off wewent into the inorganic beings' realm.\"\"Why Carol Tiggs?\"\"In the first place, because she has endless energy, and, in the second place,because she had to familiarize herself with the scout. All of us got somethinginvaluable out of this experience. You and Carol Tiggs got the scout. And therest of us got a reason to round up our physicality and place it on our energybodies: We became energy.\"\"How did all of you do that, don Juan?\"\"We displaced our assemblage points, in unison. Our impeccable intent to saveyou did the work. The scout took us, in the blink of an eye, to where you werelying, half dead, and Carol dragged you out.\"His explanation made no sense to me. Don Juan laughed when I tried to raise thatpoint.\"How can you understand this when you don't even have enough energy to get outof your bed?\" he retorted.I confided to him that I was certain I knew infinitely more than I rationallyadmitted but that something was keeping a tight lid on my memory.\"Lack of energy is what has put a tight lid on your memory,\" he said. \"When youhave sufficient energy, your memory will work fine.\"\"Do you mean that I can remember everything if I want to?\"\"Not quite. You may want as much as you like, but if your energy level is not ona par with the importance of what you know, you might as well kiss yourknowledge good-bye: it'll never be available to you.\"\"So what's the thing to do, don Juan?\"\"Energy tends to be cumulative: If you follow the warrior's way impeccably, amoment will come when your memory opens up.\"I confessed that hearing him talk gave me the absurd sensation that I wasindulging in feeling sorry for myself; that there was nothing wrong with me.\"You are not just indulging,\" he said. \"You were actually energetically deadfour weeks ago. Now you are merely stunned. Being stunned and lacking energy iswhat makes you hide your knowledge. You certainly know more than any of us aboutthe inorganic beings' world. That world was the exclusive concern of the oldsorcerers. All of us have told you that only through sorcerers' stories do weknow about it. I sincerely say that it is more than strange to me that you'vebecome, in your own right, another source of sorcerers' stories for us.\"I reiterated that it was impossible for me to believe I had done something hehad not. But I could not believe either that he was merely humoring me.\"I am not flattering or humoring you,\" he said, visibly annoyed. \"I am stating asorcery fact. Knowing more than any of us about that world shouldn't be a reasonfor feeling pleased. There's no advantage in that knowledge. In fact, in spiteof all you know, you couldn't save yourself. We saved you, because we found you.But without the aid of the scout, there was no point in even trying to find you.You were so infinitely lost in that world that I shudder at the mere thought.\"In my state of mind, I did not find it strange in the least that I actually sawa ripple of emotion going through all of don Juan's companions and apprentices.The only one who remained unaltered was Carol Tiggs. She seemed to have fullyaccepted her role. She was one with me.\"You did free the scout,\" don Juan continued, \"but you gave up your life. Or,worse yet, you gave up your freedom. The inorganic beings let the scout go inexchange for you.\"\"I can hardly believe that, don Juan. Not that I doubt you, you understand, butyou describe such an underhanded maneuver that I am stunned.\"\"Don't consider it underhanded and you have the whole thing in a nutshell. Theinorganic beings are forever in search of awareness and energy. If you supplythem with the possibility of both, what do you think they'll do? Blow you kissesfrom across the street?\"I knew that don Juan was right. However, I could not hold that certainty for toolong: Clarity kept drifting away from me.Don Juan's companions continued asking him questions. They wanted to know if hehad given any thought to what to do with the scout.\"Yes, I have. It is a most serious problem, which the nagual here has toresolve,\" he said, pointing at me. \"He and Carol Tiggs are the only ones who canfree the scout. And he knows it too.\"Naturally, I asked him the only possible question, \"How can I free it?\"\"Instead of my telling you how, there is a much better and more just way offinding out,\" don Juan said with a big smile. \"Ask the emissary. The inorganicbeings cannot lie, you know.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"8. The Third Gate of Dreaming\"The third gate of dreaming is reached when you find yourself in a dream,staring at someone else who is asleep. And that someone else turns out to beyou,\" don Juan said.My energy level was so keyed up at the time that I went to work on the thirdtask right away although he did not offer any more information about it.Journeying to the realm of inorganic beings was no longer an issue for me.The first thing I noticed in my dreaming practices was that a surge of energyimmediately rearranged the focus of my dreaming attention. Its focus was now onwaking up in a dream and seeing myself sleeping.Very soon after, I found myself in a dream looking at myself asleep. Iimmediately reported it to don Juan. The dream had happened while I was at hishouse.\"There are two phases to each of the gates of dreaming,\" he said. \"The first, asyou know, is to arrive at the gate: The second is to cross it. By dreaming whatyou've dreamt- that you saw yourself asleep- you arrived at the third gate. Thesecond phase is to move around once you've seen yourself asleep.\"At the third gate of dreaming,\" he went on, \"you begin to deliberately mergeyour dreaming reality with the reality of the daily world. This is the drill,and sorcerers call it completing the energy body. The merge between the tworealities has to be so thorough that you need to be more fluid than ever.Examine everything at the third gate with great care and curiosity.\"I complained that his recommendations were too cryptic and were not making anysense to me.\"What do you mean by great care and curiosity?\" I asked.\"Our tendency at the third gate is to get lost in detail,\" he replied. \"To viewthings with great care and curiosity means to resist the nearly irresistibletemptation to plunge into detail.\"The given drill at the third gate, as I said, is to consolidate the energybody.\"Dreamers begin forging the energy body by fulfilling the drills of the firstand second gates. When they reach the third gate, the energy body is ready tocome out, or perhaps it would be better to say that it is ready to act.Unfortunately, this also means that it's ready to be mesmerized by detail.\"\"What does it mean to be mesmerized by detail?\"\"The energy body is like a child who's been imprisoned all its life. The momentit is free, it soaks up everything it can find, and I mean everything. Everyirrelevant, minute detail totally absorbs the energy body.\"An awkward silence followed. I had no idea what to say. I had understood himperfectly, I just didn't have anything in my experience to give me an idea ofexactly what it all meant.\"The most asinine detail becomes a world for the energy body,\" don Juanexplained. \"The effort that dreamers have to make to direct the energy body isstaggering. I know that it sounds awkward to tell you to view things with careand curiosity, but that is the best way to describe what you should do. At thethird gate, dreamers have to avoid a nearly irresistible impulse to plunge intoeverything, and they avoid it by being so curious, so desperate to get intoeverything that they don't let any particular thing imprison them.\"Don Juan added that his recommendations, which he knew sounded absurd to themind, were directly aimed at my energy body. He stressed over and over that myenergy body had to unite all its resources in order to act.\"But hasn't my energy body been acting all along?\" I asked.\"Part of it has, otherwise you wouldn't have journeyed to the inorganic beings'realm,\" he replied. \"Now your entire energy body has to be engaged to performthe drill of the third gate. Therefore, to make things easier for your energybody, you must hold back your rationality.\"\"I am afraid you are barking up the wrong tree,\" I said. \"There is very littlerationality left in me after all the experiences you've brought into my life.\"\"Don't say anything,\" don Juan replied. \"At the third gate, rationality isresponsible for the insistence of our energy bodies on being obsessed withsuperfluous detail. At the third gate, then, we need irrational fluidity;irrational abandon to counteract that insistence.\"Don Juan's statement that each gate is an obstacle could not have been moretruthful. I labored to fulfill the drill of the third gate of dreaming moreintensely than I had on the other two tasks combined. Don Juan put tremendouspressure on me. Besides, something else had been added to my life: a true senseof fear. I had been normally and even excessively afraid of one thing or anotherthroughout my life, but there had been nothing in my experience comparable tothe fear I felt after my bout with the inorganic beings. Yet all this wealth ofexperience was inaccessible to my normal memory. Only in the presence of donJuan were those memories at my disposal.I asked him about this strange situation once when we were at the NationalMuseum of Anthropology and History in Mexico City. What had prompted my questionwas that, at the moment, I had the odd ability to remember everything that hadhappened to me in the course of my association with don Juan. And that made mefeel so free, so daring and light-footed that I was practically dancing around.\"It just happens that the presence of the nagual induces a shift of theassemblage point,\" he said.He guided me then into one of the display rooms of the museum and said that myquestion was apropos to what he had been planning to tell me.\"My intention was to explain to you that the position of the assemblage point islike a vault where sorcerers keep their records,\" he said. \"I was tickled pinkwhen your energy body felt my intent and you asked me about it. The energy bodyknows immensities. Let me show you how much it knows.\"He instructed me to enter into total silence. He reminded me that I was alreadyin a special state of awareness because my assemblage point had been made toshift by his presence. He assured me that entering into total silence was goingto allow the sculptures in that room to make me see and hear inconceivablethings.He added, apparently to increase my confusion, that some of the archaeologicalpieces in that room had the capacity to produce, by themselves, a shift of theassemblage point, and that if I reached a state of total silence I would beactually witnessing scenes pertaining to the lives of the people who made thosepieces.He then began the strangest tour of a museum I have ever taken. He went aroundthe room, describing and interpreting astounding details of every one of thelarge pieces. According to him, every archaeological piece in that room was apurposeful record left by the people of antiquity, a record that don Juan as asorcerer was reading to me as one would read a book.\"Every piece here is designed to make the assemblage point shift,\" he went on.\"Fix your gaze on any of them, silence your mind, and find out whether or notyour assemblage point can be made to shift.\"\"How would I know that it has shifted?\"\"Because you would see and feel things that are beyond your normal reach.\"I gazed at the sculptures and saw and heard things that I would be at a loss toexplain.In the past, I had examined all those pieces with the bias of anthropology;always bearing in mind the descriptions of scholars in the field. Theirdescriptions of the functions of those pieces, rooted in modern man's cognitionof the world, appeared to me, for the first time, to be utterly prejudiced ifnot asinine.What don Juan said about those pieces, and what I heard and saw myself whilegazing at them was the farthest thing from what I had always read about them.My discomfort was so great that I felt obliged to apologize to don Juan for whatI thought was my suggestibility. He did not laugh or make fun of me. Hepatiently explained that sorcerers were capable of leaving accurate records oftheir findings in the position of the assemblage point.He maintained that when it comes to getting to the essence of a written account,we have to use our sense of sympathetic or imaginative participation to gobeyond the mere page into the experience itself.However, in the sorcerers' world, since there are no written pages, totalrecords, which can be relived instead of read, are left in the position of theassemblage point.To illustrate his argument, don Juan talked about the sorcerers' teachings forthe second attention. He said that they are given when the apprentice'sassemblage point is on a place other than the normal one. The position of theassemblage point becomes, in this manner, the record of the lesson. In order toplay the lesson back, the apprentice has to return his assemblage point to theposition it occupied when the lesson was given. Don Juan concluded his remarksby reiterating that to return the assemblage point to all the positions itoccupied when the lessons were given is an accomplishment of the highestmagnitude. For nearly a year, don Juan did not ask me anything about my third dreamingtask. Then one day, quite abruptly, he wanted me to describe to him all thenuances of my dreaming practices.The first thing I mentioned was a baffling recurrence. For a period of months, Ihad dreams in which I found myself staring at me, sleeping in my bed. The oddpart was the regularity of those dreams; they happened every four days, likeclockwork.During the other three days, my dreaming was what it always had been so far: Iexamined every possible item in my dreams, I changed dreams, and occasionally,driven by a suicidal curiosity, I followed the foreign energy scouts, although Ifelt extremely guilty doing this. I fancied it to be like having a secret drugaddiction. The realness of that world was irresistible to me.Secretly, I felt somehow exonerated from total responsibility, because don Juanhimself had suggested that I ask the dreaming emissary about what to do to freethe blue scout trapped among us. He meant for me to pose the question in myeveryday practice, but I construed his statement to imply that I had to ask theemissary while I was in its world. The question I really wanted to ask theemissary was whether the inorganic beings had set a trap for me.The emissary not only told me that everything don Juan had said was true butalso gave me instructions on what Carol Tiggs and I had to do to liberate thescout.\"The regularity of your dreams is something that I rather expected,\" don Juanremarked, after listening to me.\"Why did you expect something like that, don Juan?\"\"Because of your relationship with the inorganic beings.\"\"That's over and forgotten, don Juan,\" I lied, hoping he would not pursue thesubject any further.\"You are saying that for my benefit, aren't you? You don't need to; I know thetrue story. Believe me, once you get to play with them, you are hooked. They'llalways be after you. Or, what's worse yet, you'll always be after them.\"He stared at me, and my guilt must have been so obvious that it made him laugh.\"The only possible explanation for such regularity is that the inorganic beingsare catering to you again,\" don Juan said in a serious tone.I hurried to change the subject and told him that another nuance of my dreamingpractices worth mentioning was my reaction to the sight of myself lying soundasleep. That view was always so startling that it either glued me to the spotuntil the dream changed, or frightened me so profoundly that it made me wake upscreaming at the top of my voice. I had gotten to the point where I was afraidto go to sleep on the days I knew I was going to have that dream.\"You are not yet ready for a true merging of your dreaming reality and yourdaily reality,\" he concluded. \"You must recapitulate your life further.\"\"But I've done all the recapitulating possible,\" I protested. \"I've beenrecapitulating for years. There is nothing more I can remember about my life.\"\"There must be much more,\" he said adamantly, \"otherwise, you wouldn't wake upscreaming.\"I did not like the idea of having to recapitulate again. I had done it, and Ibelieved I had done it so well that I did not need to touch the subject everagain.\"The recapitulation of our lives never ends, no matter how well we've done itonce,\" don Juan said. \"The reason average people lack volition in their dreamsis that they have never recapitulated and their lives are filled to capacitywith heavily loaded emotions like memories, hopes, fears, et cetera, et cetera.\"Sorcerers, in contrast, are relatively free from heavy, binding emotions,because of their recapitulation. And if something stops them, as it has stoppedyou at this moment, the assumption is that there still is something in them thatis not quite clear.\"\"To recapitulate is too involving, don Juan. Maybe there is something else I cando instead.\"\"No. There isn't. Recapitulating and dreaming go hand in hand. As we regurgitateour lives, we get more and more airborne.\"Don Juan had given me very detailed and explicit instructions about therecapitulation. It consisted of reliving the totality of one's life experiencesby remembering every possible minute detail of them. He saw the recapitulationas the essential factor in a dreamer's redefinition and redeployment of energy.\"The recapitulation sets free energy imprisoned within us; and without thisliberated energy, dreaming is not possible.\" That was his statement.Years before, don Juan had coached me to make a list of all the people I had metin my life, starting at the present. He helped me to arrange my list in anorderly fashion, breaking it down into areas of activity, such as jobs I hadhad, schools I had attended. Then he guided me to go, without deviation, fromthe first person on my list to the last one, reliving every one of myinteractions with them.He explained that recapitulating an event starts with one's mind arrangingeverything pertinent to what is being recapitulated. Arranging meansreconstructing the event, piece by piece; starting by recollecting the physicaldetails of the surroundings; then going to the person with whom one shared theinteraction; and then going to oneself- to the examination of one's feelings.Don Juan taught me that the recapitulation is coupled with a natural, rhythmicalbreathing. Long exhalations are performed as the head moves gently and slowlyfrom right to left; and long inhalations are taken as the head moves back fromleft to right. He called this act of moving the head from side to side 'fanningthe event'. The mind examines the event from beginning to end while the bodyfans, on and on, everything the mind focuses on.Don Juan said that the sorcerers of antiquity, the inventors of therecapitulation, viewed breathing as a magical, life-giving act and used it,accordingly, as a magical vehicle; the exhalation, to eject the foreign energyleft in them during the interaction being recapitulated; and the inhalation topull back the energy that they themselves left behind during the interaction.Because of my academic training, I took the recapitulation to be the process ofanalyzing one's life. But don Juan insisted that it was more involved than anintellectual psychoanalysis. He postulated the recapitulation as a sorcerer'sploy to induce a minute but steady displacement of the assemblage point. He saidthat the assemblage point, under the impact of reviewing past actions andfeelings, goes back and forth between its present site and the site it occupiedwhen the event being recapitulated took place.Don Juan stated that the old sorcerers' rationale behind the recapitulation wastheir conviction that there is an inconceivable dissolving force in theuniverse, which makes organisms live by lending them awareness. That force alsomakes organisms die in order to extract the same lent awareness; which organismshave enhanced through their life experiences.Don Juan explained the old sorcerers' reasoning. They believed that since it isour life experience this force is after, it is of supreme importance that it canbe satisfied with a facsimile of our life experience: the recapitulation. Havinghad what it seeks, the dissolving force then lets sorcerers go, free to expandtheir capacity to perceive and reach with it the confines of time and space.When I started again to recapitulate, it was a great surprise to me that mydreaming practices were automatically suspended the moment my recapitulationbegan. I asked don Juan about this unwanted recess.\"Dreaming requires every bit of our available energy,\" he replied. \"If there isa deep preoccupation in our life, there is no possibility of dreaming.\"\"But I have been deeply preoccupied before,\" I said, \"and my practices werenever interrupted.\"\"It must be then that every time you thought you were preoccupied, you were onlyegomaniacally disturbed,\" he said, laughing. \"To be preoccupied, for sorcerers,means that all your energy sources are taken on. This is the first time you'veengaged your energy sources in their totality. The rest of the time, even whenyou recapitulated before, you were not completely absorbed.\"Don Juan gave me this time a new recapitulation pattern. I was supposed toconstruct a jigsaw puzzle by recapitulating, without any apparent order,different events of my life.\"But it's going to be a mess,\" I protested.\"No, it won't be,\" he assured me. \"It'll be a mess if you let your pettinesschoose the events you are going to recapitulate. Instead, let the spirit decide.Be silent, and then get to the event the spirit points out.\"The results of that pattern of recapitulation were shocking to me on manylevels. I was very impressed to find out that, whenever I silenced my mind, aseemingly independent force immediately plunged me into a most detailed memoryof some event in my life. But it was even more impressive that a very orderlyconfiguration resulted. What I thought was going to be chaotic turned out to beextremely effective.I asked don Juan why he had not made me recapitulate in this manner from thestart. He replied that there are two basic rounds to the recapitulation; thatthe first is called formality and rigidity; and the second fluidity.I had no inkling about how different my recapitulation was going to be thistime. The ability to concentrate, which I had acquired by means of my dreamingpractices, permitted me to examine my life at a depth I would never haveimagined possible.It took me over a year to view and review all I could about my life experiences.At the end, I had to agree with don Juan: There had been immensities of loadedemotions hidden so deeply inside me as to be virtually inaccessible.The result of my second recapitulation was a new, more relaxed attitude. Thevery day I returned to my dreaming practices, I dreamt I saw myself asleep. Iturned around and daringly left my room, penuriously going down a flight ofstairs to the street.I was elated with what I had done and reported it to don Juan. My disappointmentwas enormous when he did not consider this dream part of my dreaming practices.He argued that I had not gone to the street with my energy body, because if Ihad I would have had a sensation other than walking down a flight of stairs.\"What kind of sensation are you talking about, don Juan?\" I asked, with genuinecuriosity.\"You have to establish some valid guide to find out whether you are actuallyseeing your body asleep in your bed,\" he said instead of answering my question.\"Remember, you must be in your actual room, seeing your actual body. Otherwise,what you are having is merely a dream. If that's the case, control that dream,either by observing its detail or by changing it.\"I insisted he tell me more about the valid guide he had referred to, but he cutme short.\"Figure out a way to validate the fact that you are looking at yourself,\" hesaid.\"Do you have any suggestions as to what can be a valid guide?\" I insisted.\"Use your own judgment. We are coming to the end of our time together. You haveto be on your own very soon.\" He changed the subject then, and I was left with aclear taste of my ineptitude. I was unable to figure out what he wanted or whathe meant by a valid guide.In the next dream in which I saw myself asleep, instead of leaving the room andwalking down the stairs, or waking up screaming, I remained glued, for a longtime, to the spot from which I watched. Without fretting or despairing, Iobserved the details of my dream. I noticed then that I was asleep wearing awhite T-shirt that was ripped at the shoulder. I tried to come closer andexamine the rip, but moving was beyond my capabilities. I felt a heaviness thatseemed to be part of my very being. In fact, I was all weight. Not knowing whatto do next, I instantly entered into a devastating confusion. I tried to changedreams, but some unaccustomed force kept me staring at my sleeping body.In the midst of my turmoil, I heard the dreaming emissary saying that not havingcontrol to move around was frightening me to the point that I might have to doanother recapitulation. The emissary's voice and what it said did not surpriseme at all. I had never felt so vividly and terrifyingly unable to move. I didnot, however, give in to my terror. I examined it and found out that it was nota psychological terror but a physical sensation of helplessness, despair, andannoyance. It bothered me beyond words that I was not capable of moving mylimbs. My annoyance grew in proportion to my realization that something outsideme had me brutally pinned down. The effort I made to move my arms or legs was sointense and single-minded that at one moment I actually saw one leg of my body,sleeping on the bed, flung out as if kicking.My awareness was then pulled into my inert, sleeping body, and I woke up withsuch a force that it took more than half an hour to calm myself down. My heartwas beating almost erratically. I was shivering, and some of the muscles in mylegs twitched uncontrollably. I had suffered such a radical loss of body heatthat I needed blankets and hot-water bottles to raise my temperature.Naturally, I went to Mexico to ask don Juan's advice about the sensation ofparalysis, and about the fact that I really had been wearing a ripped T-shirt,thus, I had indeed seen myself asleep. Besides, I was deadly afraid ofhypothermia. He was reluctant to discuss my predicament. All I got out of himwas a caustic remark.\"You like drama,\" he said flatly. \"Of course you really saw yourself asleep. Theproblem is that you got nervous because your energy body has never beenconsciously in one piece before. If you ever get nervous and cold again, hold onto your dick. That will restore your body temperature in a jiffy and without anyfuss.\"I felt a bit offended by his crassness. However, the advice proved effective.The next time I became frightened, I relaxed and returned to normal in a fewminutes, doing what he had prescribed. In this manner, I discovered that if Idid not fret and kept my annoyance in check, I did not panic. To remaincontrolled did not help me move, but it certainly gave me a deep sensation ofpeace and serenity.After months of useless efforts at walking, I sought don Juan's comments onceagain, not so much for his advice this time but because I wanted to concededefeat. I was up against an impassable barrier, and I knew with indisputablecertainty that I had failed.\"Dreamers have to be imaginative,\" don Juan said with a malicious grin.\"Imaginative you are not. I didn't warn you about having to use your imaginationto move your energy body because I wanted to find out whether you could resolvethe riddle by yourself. You didn't, and your friends didn't help you either.\"In the past, I had been driven to defend myself viciously whenever he accused meof lacking imagination. I thought I was imaginative, but having don Juan as ateacher had taught me, the hard way, that I am not. Since I was not going toengage my energy in futile defenses of myself, I asked him instead, \"What isthis riddle you are talking about, don Juan?\"\"The riddle of how impossible and yet how easy it is to move the energy body.You are trying to move it as if you were in the daily world. We spend so muchtime and effort learning to walk that we believe our dreaming bodies should alsowalk. There is no reason why they should, except that walking is foremost in ourminds.\"I marveled at the simplicity of the solution. I instantly knew that don Juan wasright. I had gotten stuck again at the level of interpretation. He had told me Ihad to move around once I reached the third gate of dreaming, and to me movingaround meant walking. I told him that I understood his point.\"It isn't my point,\" he curtly answered. \"It's a sorcerers' point. Sorcerers saythat at the third gate the entire energy body can move like energy moves: fastand directly. Your energy body knows exactly how to move. It can move as itmoves in the inorganic beings' world.\"And this brings us to the other issue here,\" don Juan added with an air ofpensiveness. \"Why didn't your inorganic being friends help you?\"\"Why do you call them my friends, don Juan?\"\"They are like the classic friends who are not really thoughtful or kind to usbut not mean either. The friends who are just waiting for us to turn our backsso they can stab us there.\"I understood him completely and agreed with him one hundred percent.\"What makes me go there? Is it a suicidal tendency?\" I asked him, morerhetorically than not.\"You don't have any suicidal tendency,\" he said. \"What you have is a totaldisbelief that you were near death. Since you were not in physical pain, youcan't quite convince yourself you were in mortal danger.\"His argument was most reasonable, except that I did believe a deep, unknown fearhad been ruling my life since my bout with the inorganic beings. Don Juanlistened in silence as I described to him my predicament. I could not discard orexplain away my urge to go to the inorganic beings' world, in spite of what Iknew about it.\"I have a streak of insanity,\" I said. \"What I do doesn't make sense.\"\"It does make sense. The inorganic beings are still reeling you in, like a fishhooked at the end of a line,\" he said. \"They throw worthless bait at you fromtime to time to keep you going. To arrange your dreams to occur every four dayswithout fail is worthless bait. But they didn't teach you how to move yourenergy body.\"\"Why do you think they didn't?\"\"Because when your energy body learns to move by itself, you'll be thoroughlyout of their reach. It was premature of me to believe that you are free fromthem. You are relatively but not completely free. They are still bidding foryour awareness.\"I felt a chill in my back. He had touched a sore spot in me.\"Tell me what to do, don Juan, and I'll do it,\" I said.\"Be impeccable. I have told you this dozens of times. To be impeccable means toput your life on the line in order to back up your decisions, and then to doquite a lot more than your best to realize those decisions. When you are notdeciding anything, you are merely playing roulette with your life in ahelter-skelter way.\"Don Juan ended our conversation, urging me to ponder what he had said.At the first opportunity I had, I put don Juan's suggestion about moving myenergy body to the test. When I found myself looking at my body asleep, insteadof struggling to walk toward it I simply willed myself to move closer to thebed. Instantly, I was nearly touching my body. I saw my face. In fact, I couldsee every pore in my skin. I cannot say that I liked what I saw. My view of myown body was too detailed to be aesthetically pleasing. Then something like awind came into the room, totally disarranged everything, and erased my view.During subsequent dreams, I entirely corroborated that the only way the energybody can move is to glide or soar. I discussed this with don Juan. He seemedunusually satisfied with what I had done, which certainly surprised me. I wasaccustomed to his cold reaction to anything I did in my dreaming practices.\"Your energy body is used to moving only when something pulls it,\" he said. \"Theinorganic beings have been pulling your energy body right and left, and untilnow you have never moved it by yourself with your own volition. It doesn't seemlike you've done much, moving the way you did, yet I assure you that I wasseriously considering ending your practices. For a while, I believed you werenot going to learn how to move on your own.\"\"Were you considering ending my dreaming practices because I am slow?\"\"You're not slow. It takes sorcerers forever to learn to move the energy body. Iwas going to end your dreaming practices because I have no more time. There areother topics, more pressing than dreaming, on which you can use your energy.\"\"Now that I've learned how to move my energy body by myself, what else should Ido, don Juan?\"\"Continue moving. Moving your energy body has opened up a new area for you; anarea of extraordinary exploration.\"He urged me again to come up with an idea to validate the faithfulness of mydreams; that request did not seem as odd as it had the first time he voiced it.\"As you know, to be transported by a scout is the real dreaming task of thesecond gate,\" he explained. \"It is a very serious matter, but not as serious asforging and moving the energy body. Therefore, you have to make sure, by somemeans of your own, whether you are actually seeing yourself asleep or whetheryou are merely dreaming that you're seeing yourself asleep. Your newextraordinary exploration hinges on really seeing yourself asleep.\"After some heavy pondering and wondering, I believed that I had come up with theright plan. Having seen my ripped T-shirt gave me an idea for a valid guide. Istarted from the assumption that, if I were actually observing myself asleep, Iwould also be observing whether I had the same sleeping attire I had gone to bedin, an attire that I had decided to change radically every four days. I wasconfident that I was not going to have any difficulty in remembering, in dreams,what I was wearing when I went to bed; the discipline I had acquired through mydreaming practices made me think that I had the ability to record things likethis in my mind and remember them in dreams.I engaged my best efforts to follow this guide, but the results did not pan outas I thought they would. I lacked the necessary control over my dreamingattention, and I could not quite remember the details of my sleeping attire. Yetsomething else was definitely at work. Somehow I always knew whether my dreamswere ordinary dreams or not. The outstanding aspect of the dreams that were notjust ordinary dreams was that my body lay asleep in bed while my consciousnessobserved it.A notable feature of these dreams was my room. It was never like my room in thedaily world but an enormous empty hall with my bed at one end. I used to soarover a considerable distance to be at the side of the bed where my body lay. Themoment I was next to it, a windlike force used to make me hover over it, like ahummingbird. At times the room used to vanish; disappear piece by piece untilonly my body and the bed were left. At other times, I used to experience acomplete loss of volition. My dreaming attention seemed then to functionindependently of me. Either it was completely absorbed by the first item itencountered in the room or it seemed unable to decide what to do. In thoseinstances, I had the sensation that I was helplessly floating, going from itemto item.The voice of the dreaming emissary explained to me once that all the elements ofthe dreams, which were not just commonplace dreams, were really energyconfigurations different from those of our normal world. The emissary's voicepointed out that, for example, the walls were liquid. It urged me then to plungeinto one of them.Without thinking twice, I dived into a wall as if I were diving into a hugelake. I did not feel the waterlike wall; what I felt was not a physicalsensation of plunging into a body of water either. It was more like the thoughtof diving and the visual sensation of going through liquid matter. I was going,head-first, into something that opened up, like water does, as I kept movingdownward.The sensation of going down, headfirst, was so real that I began to wonder howlong or how deep or how far I was diving. From my point of view, I spent aneternity in there. I saw clouds and rocklike masses of matter suspended in awaterlike substance. There were some glowing, geometric objects that resembledcrystals, and blobs of the deepest primary colors I had ever seen. There werealso zones of intense light and others of pitch blackness. Everything went byme, either slowly or at a fast speed. I had the thought that I was viewing thecosmos. At the instant of that thought, my speed increased so immensely thateverything became blurred, and all of a sudden, I found myself awake with mynose smack against the wall of my room.Some hidden fear urged me to consult with don Juan. He listened to me, hangingon every word.\"You need to do some drastic maneuvering at this point,\" he said. \"The dreamingemissary has no business interfering with your dreaming practices. Or rather,you should not, under any conditions, permit it to do so.\"\"How can I stop it?\"\"Perform a simple but difficult maneuver. Upon entering into dreaming, voice outloud your desire not to have the dreaming emissary anymore.\"\"Does that mean, don Juan, that I will never hear it again?\"\"Positively. You'll get rid of it forever.\"\"But is it advisable to get rid of it forever?\"\"It most certainly is, at this point.\"With those words, don Juan involved me in a most disturbing dilemma. I did notwant to put an end to my relationship with the emissary, but, at the same time,I wanted to follow don Juan's advice. He noticed my hesitation.\"I know it's a very difficult affair,\" he conceded, \"but if you don't do it, theinorganic beings will always have a line on you. If you want to avoid this, dowhat I said, and do it now.\"During my next dreaming session, as I prepared myself to utter my intent, theemissary's voice interrupted me. It said, \"If you refrain from stating yourrequest, I promise you never to interfere with your dreaming practices and talkto you only if you ask me direct questions.\"I instantly accepted its proposition and sincerely felt that it was a good deal.I was even relieved it had turned out this way. I was afraid, however, that donJuan was going to be disappointed.\"It was a good maneuver,\" he remarked and laughed. \"You were sincere: You reallyintended to voice your request. To be sincere is all that was required. Therewas, essentially, no need for you to eliminate the emissary. What you wanted wasto corner it into proposing an alternative way, convenient to you. I am sure theemissary won't interfere anymore.\"He was right. I continued my dreaming practices without any meddling from theemissary. The remarkable consequence was that I began to have dreams in which mydream rooms were my room in the daily world, with one difference: In the dreams,my room was always so slanted and so distorted that it looked like a giantcubist painting: Obtuse and acute angles were the rule instead of the normalright angles of walls, ceiling, and floor. In my lopsided room, the very slantcreated by the acute or obtuse angles was a device to display prominently someabsurd, superfluous, but real detail; for example, intricate lines in thehardwood floor; or weather discolorations in the wall paint, or dust spots onthe ceiling; or smudged fingerprints on the edge of a door.In those dreams, I unavoidably got lost in the waterlike universes of the detailpointed out by the slant. During my entire dreaming practices, the profusion ofdetail in my room was so immense and its pull so intense that it instantly mademe dive into it.At the first free moment I had, I was at don Juan's place, consulting him aboutthis state.\"I can't overcome my room,\" I said to him after I had given him the details ofmy dreaming practices.\"What gives you the idea you have to overcome it?\" he asked with a grin.\"I feel that I have to move beyond my room, don Juan.\"\"But you are moving beyond your room. Perhaps you should ask yourself whetheryou are caught again in interpretations. What do you think moving means in thiscase?\"I told him walking from my room to the street had been such a haunting dream forme that I felt a real need to do it again.\"But you are doing greater things than that,\" he protested. \"You are going tounbelievable regions. What else do you want?\"I tried to explain to him that I had a physical urge to move away from the trapof detail. What upset me the most was my incapacity to free myself from whatevercaught my attention. To have a modicum of volition was the bottom line for me.A very long silence followed. I waited to hear more about the trap of detail.After all, he had warned me about its dangers.\"You are doing fine,\" he finally said. \"Dreamers take a very long time toperfect their energy bodies. And this is exactly what's at stake here;perfecting your energy body.\"Don Juan explained that the reason my energy body was compelled to examinedetail and get inextricably stuck in it was its inexperience; itsincompleteness. He said that sorcerers spend a lifetime consolidating the energybody by letting it sponge up everything possible.\"Until the energy body is complete and mature, it is self-absorbed,\" don Juanwent on. \"It can't get free from the compulsion to be absorbed by everything.But if one takes this into consideration, instead of fighting the energy body asyou're doing now, one can lend it a hand.\"\"How can I do that, don Juan?\"\"By directing its behavior, that is to say, by stalking it.\"He explained that since everything related to the energy body depends on theappropriate position of the assemblage point, and since dreaming is nothing elsebut the means to displace it, stalking is, consequently, the way to make theassemblage point stay put on the perfect position; in this case, the positionwhere the energy body can become consolidated and from which it can finallyemerge.Don Juan said that the moment the energy body can move on its own, sorcerersassume that the optimum position of the assemblage point has been reached. Thenext step is to stalk it, that is, to fixate it on that position in order tocomplete the energy body. He remarked that the procedure is simplicity itself.One intends to stalk it.Silence and looks of expectation followed that statement. I expected him to saymore, and he expected me to have understood what he had said. I had not.\"Let your energy body intend to reach the optimum dreaming position,\" heexplained. \"Then, let your energy body intend to stay at that position and youwill be stalking.\"He paused, and with his eyes urged me to consider his statement.\"Intending is the secret, but you already know that,\" he said. \"Sorcerersdisplace their assemblage points through intending; and fixate them, equally,through intending. And there is no technique for intending. One intends throughusage.\"To have another of my wild assumptions about my worth as a sorcerer wasunavoidable at that point. I had boundless confidence that something was goingto put me on the right track to intend the fixation of my assemblage point onthe ideal spot. I had accomplished in the past all kinds of successful maneuverswithout knowing how I performed them. Don Juan himself had marveled at myability or my luck, and I was sure this was going to be one of those instances.I was gravely mistaken. No matter what I did, or how long I waited, I had nosuccess whatsoever in fixing my assemblage point on any spot, much less on theideal one.After months of serious but unsuccessful struggling, I gave up.\"I really believed I could do it,\" I said to don Juan, the moment I was in hishouse. \"I am afraid that nowadays I am more of an egomaniac than ever.\"\"Not really,\" he said with a smile. \"What happens is that you are caught inanother of your routinary misinterpretations of terms. You want to find theideal spot, as if you were finding your lost car keys. Then you want to tie yourassemblage point, as if you were tying your shoes. The ideal spot and thefixation of the assemblage point are metaphors. They have nothing to do with thewords used to describe them.\"He asked me then to tell him the latest events of any dreaming practices. Thefirst thing I mentioned was that my urge to be absorbed by detail had subsidednotably. I said that perhaps because I moved in my dreams, compulsively andincessantly, the movement might have been what always managed to stop me beforeI plunged into the detail I was observing. To be stopped in that fashion gave methe opportunity to examine the act of being absorbed by detail. I came to theconclusion that inanimate matter actually possesses an immobilizing force, whichI saw as a beam of dull light that kept me pinned down. For example, many timessome minute mark on the walls or in the wood lines of the hardwood floor of myroom used to send a line of light that transfixed me. From the moment mydreaming attention was focused on that light, the whole dream rotated aroundthat minute mark. I saw it enlarged perhaps to the size of the cosmos. That viewused to last until I woke up, usually with my nose pressed against the wall orthe wood floor. My own observations were that, in the first place, the detailwas real, and, in the second place, I seemed to have been observing it while Iwas asleep.Don Juan smiled and said, \"All this is happening to you because the forging ofyour energy body was completed the moment it moved by itself. I didn't tell youthat, but I insinuated it. I wanted to know whether or not you were capable offinding it out by yourself, which, of course, you did.\"I had no idea what he meant. Don Juan scrutinized me in his usual manner. Hispenetrating gaze scanned my body.\"What exactly did I find out by myself, don Juan?\" I was forced to ask.\"You found out that your energy body had been completed,\" he answered.\"I didn't find out anything of the kind, I assure you.\"\"Yes, you did. It started some time ago, when you couldn't find a guide tovalidate the realness of your dreams, but then something went to work for youand let you know whether you were having a regular dream. That something wasyour energy body. Now, you despair that you couldn't find the ideal spot to fixyour assemblage point. And I tell you that you did. The proof is that, by movingaround, your energy body curtailed its obsession with detail.\"I was nonplussed. [* nonplussed- filled with bewilderment] I could not even askone of my feeble questions.\"What comes next for you is a sorcerers' gem,\" don Juan went on. \"You are goingto practice seeing energy in your dreaming. You have fulfilled the drill for thethird gate of dreaming: moving your energy body by itself. Now you are going toperform the real task: seeing energy with your energy body.\"You have seen energy before,\" he went on, \"many times, in fact. But each ofthose times, seeing was a fluke. Now you are going to do it deliberately.\"Dreamers have a rule of thumb,\" he continued. \"If their energy body iscomplete, they see energy every time they gaze at an item in the daily world. Indreams, if they see the energy of an item, they know they are dealing with areal world, no matter how distorted that world may appear to their dreamingattention. If they can't see the energy of an item, they are in an ordinarydream and not in a real world.\"\"What is a real world, don Juan?\"\"A world that generates energy; the opposite of a phantom world of projections,where nothing generates energy, like most of our dreams, where nothing has anenergetic effect.\"Don Juan then gave me another definition of dreaming: a process by whichdreamers isolate dream conditions in which they can find energy-generatingelements.He must have noticed my bewilderment. He laughed and gave another, even moreconvoluted definition: dreaming is the process by which we intend to findadequate positions of the assemblage point; positions that permit us to perceiveenergy-generating items in dreamlike states.He explained that the energy body is also capable of perceiving energy that isquite different from the energy of our own world; as in the case of items of theinorganic beings' realm, which the energy body perceives as sizzling energy.He added that in our world nothing sizzles. Everything here wavers.\"From now on,\" he said, \"the issue of your dreaming is going to be to determinewhether the items on which you focus your dreaming attention are energygenerating, mere phantom projections, or generators of foreign energy.\"Don Juan admitted that he had hoped I was going to come up with the idea ofseeing energy as the gauge to determine whether or not I was observing my realbody asleep. He laughed at my spurious device of putting on elaborate sleepingattire every four days. He said that I'd had, at my fingertips, all theinformation necessary to deduce what was the real task of the third gate ofdreaming and to come up with the right idea, but that my interpretation systemhad forced me to seek contrived solutions that lacked the simplicity anddirectness of sorcery. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"9. The New Area of ExplorationDon Juan told me that in order to see in dreaming not only did I have to intendseeing but I had to put my intent into loud words. For reasons he refused toexplain, he insisted that I had to speak up. He conceded that there are othermeans to accomplish the same result, but he asserted that voicing one's intentis the simplest and most direct way.The first time I put into words my intent to see, I was dreaming of a churchbazaar. There were so many articles that I could not make up my mind which oneto gaze at. A giant, conspicuous vase in a corner made up my mind for me. Igazed at it, voicing my intent to see. The vase remained in my view for aninstant, then it changed into another object.I gazed at as many things as I could in that dream. After I voiced my intent tosee, every item I had chosen to gaze at vanished or turned into something else,as had happened all along in my dreaming practices. My dreaming attention wasfinally exhausted, and I woke up tremendously frustrated, almost angry.For months on end, I actually gazed at hundreds of items in my dreams anddeliberately voiced my intent to see, but nothing ever happened. Tired ofwaiting, I finally had to ask don Juan about it.\"You need to have patience. You are learning to do something extraordinary,\" heremarked. \"You are learning to intend to see in your dreams. Someday you willnot have to voice your intent: You'll simply will it, silently.\"\"I think I have not understood the function of whatever I am doing,\" I said.\"Nothing happens when I shout my intent to see. What does that mean?\"\"It means that your dreams, so far, have been ordinary dreams: They have beenphantom projections; images that have life only in your dreaming attention.\"He wanted to know exactly what had happened to the items on which I had focusedmy gaze. I said that they had vanished or changed shape or even producedvortexes that eventually changed my dreams.\"It has been like that in all my daily dreaming practices,\" I said. \"The onlything out of the ordinary is that I am learning to yell in my dreams, at the topof my voice.\"My last statement threw don Juan into a genuine fit of belly laughter, which Ifound disconcerting. I failed to find the humor of my statement or the reasonfor his reaction.\"Someday you'll appreciate how funny all this is,\" he said as an answer to mysilent protest. \"In the meantime, don't give up or get discouraged. Keep ontrying. Sooner or later, you'll hit the right note.\" As usual, he was right. A couple of months later, I hit the jackpot. I had amost unusual dream. It started with the appearance of a scout from the inorganicbeings' world. The scouts as well as the dreaming emissary had been strangelyabsent from my dreams. I had not missed them or pondered their disappearance. Infact, I was so at ease without them, I had even forgotten to ask don Juan abouttheir absence.In that dream, the scout had been, at first, a gigantic yellow topaz which I hadfound stuck in the back of a drawer. The moment I voiced my intent to see, thetopaz turned into a blob of sizzling energy. I feared that I would be compelledto follow it, so I moved my gaze away from the scout and focused it on anaquarium with tropical fish. I voiced my intent to see and got a tremendoussurprise. The aquarium emitted a low, greenish glow and changed into a largesurrealist portrait of a bejeweled woman. The portrait emitted the same greenishglow when I voiced my intent to see.As I gazed at that glow, the whole dream changed. I was walking then on a streetin a town that seemed familiar to me: It might have been Tucson. I gazed at adisplay of women's clothes in a store window and spoke out loud my intent tosee. Instantly, a black mannequin, prominently displayed, began to glow. I gazednext at a saleslady who came at that moment to rearrange the window. She lookedat me. After voicing my intent, I saw her glow. It was so stupendous that I wasafraid some detail in her splendorous glow would trap me, but the woman movedinside the store before I had time to focus my total attention on her. Icertainly intended to follow her inside, however, my dreaming attention wascaught by a moving glow. It came to me charging, filled with hatred. There wasloathing in it and viciousness. I jumped backward. The glow stopped its charge.A black substance swallowed me, and I woke up.These images were so vivid that I firmly believed I had seen energy and my dreamhad been one of those conditions that don Juan had called dreamlike,energy-generating. The idea that dreams can take place in the consensual realityof our daily world intrigued me, just as the dream images of the inorganicbeings' realm had intrigued me.\"This time, you not only saw energy but crossed a dangerous boundary,\" don Juansaid, after hearing my account.He reiterated that the drill for the third gate of dreaming is to make theenergy body move on its own. In my last session, he said, I had unwittinglysuperseded the effect of that drill and crossed into another world.\"Your energy body moved,\" he said. \"It journeyed by itself. That kind ofjourneying is beyond your abilities at this moment, and something attacked you.\"\"What do you think it was, don Juan?\"\"This is a predatorial universe. It could have been one of thousands of thingsexisting out there.\"\"Why do you think it attacked me?\"\"For the same reason the inorganic beings attacked you: because you madeyourself available.\"\"Is it that clear-cut, don Juan?\"\"Certainly. It's as clear-cut as what you would do if a strange-looking spidercrept across your desk while you were writing. You'd squash it out of fright,rather than admire it or examine it.\"I was at a loss and searched for words to ask the proper question. I wanted toask him where my dream had taken place, or what world I was in in that dream.But those questions did not make any sense. I could gather that myself. Don Juanwas very understanding.\"You want to know where your dreaming attention was focused, don't you?\" heasked with a grin.This was exactly how I wanted to word my question. I reasoned that in the dreamunder consideration, I must have been looking at some real object- just likewhat had happened when I saw in dreams the minute details on the floor or thewalls or the door of my room; details that I later had corroborated existed.Don Juan said that in special dreams, like the one I'd had, our dreamingattention focuses on the daily world, and that it moves instantly from one realobject to another in the world. What makes this movement possible is that theassemblage point is on the proper dreaming position. From that position, theassemblage point gives the dreaming attention such fluidity that it can move ina split second over incredible distances, and in doing so it produces aperception so fast, so fleeting that it resembles an ordinary dream.Don Juan explained that in my dream I had seen a real vase, and then my dreamingattention had moved over distances to see a real surrealist painting of abejeweled woman. The result, with the exception of seeing energy, had been veryclose to an ordinary dream in which items, when gazed at, quickly turn intosomething else.\"I know how disturbing this is,\" he went on, definitely aware of mybewilderment. \"For some reason pertinent to the mind, to see energy in dreamingis more upsetting than anything one can think of.\"I remarked that I had seen energy in dreaming before, yet it had never affectedme like this.\"Now your energy body is complete and functioning,\" he said. \"Therefore, theimplication that you see energy in your dream is that you are perceiving a realworld through the veil of a dream. That's the importance of the journey youtook. It was real. It involved energy-generating items that nearly ended yourlife.\"\"Was it that serious, don Juan?\"\"You bet! The creature that attacked you was made of pure awareness and was asdeadly as anything can be. You saw its energy. I am sure that you realize by nowthat unless we see in dreaming, we can't tell a real energy-generating thingfrom a phantom projection. So, even though you battled the inorganic beings andindeed saw the scouts and the tunnels, your energy body doesn't know for sure ifthey were real; meaning energy generating. You are ninety-nine but not onehundred percent sure.\"Don Juan insisted on talking about the journey I had taken. For inexplicablereasons, I was reluctant to deal with that subject. What he was saying producedan instantaneous reaction in me. I found myself trying to come to grips with adeep, strange fear: It was dark and obsessive in a nagging, visceral way.\"You definitely went into another layer of the onion,\" don Juan said, finishinga statement to which I had not paid attention.\"What is this other layer of the onion, don Juan?\"\"The world is like an onion, it has many skins. The world we know is but one ofthem. Sometimes, we cross boundaries and enter into another skin; another world,very much like this one, but not the same. And you entered into one all byyourself.\"\"How is this journey you're talking about possible, don Juan?\"\"That is a meaningless question, because no one can answer it. In the view ofsorcerers, the universe is constructed in layers which the energy body cancross. Do you know where the old sorcerers are still existing to this day? Inanother layer; in another skin of the onion.\"\"For me, the idea of a real, pragmatic journey taken in dreams is very difficultto understand or to accept, don Juan.\"\"We have discussed this topic to exhaustion. I was convinced you understood thatthe journey of the energy body depends exclusively on the position of theassemblage point.\"\"You've told me that, and I have been mulling it over and over. Still, sayingthat the journey is in the position of the assemblage point doesn't say anythingto me.\"\"Your problem is your cynicism. I was just like you. Cynicism doesn't allow usto make drastic changes in our understanding of the world. It also forces us tofeel that we are always right.\"I understood his point to perfection, but I reminded him about my fight againstall that.\"I propose that you do one nonsensical thing that might turn the tide,\" he said.\"Repeat to yourself incessantly that the hinge of sorcery is the mystery of theassemblage point. If you repeat this to yourself long enough, some unseen forcetakes over and makes the appropriate changes in you.\"Don Juan did not give me any indication that he was being facetious. [*facetious- cleverly amusing in tone] I knew he meant every word of it. Whatbothered me was his insistence that I repeat the formula ceaselessly to myself.I caught myself thinking that all of it was asinine.\"Cut your cynical attitude,\" he snapped at me. \"Repeat this in a bona fidemanner.\"The mystery of the assemblage point is everything in sorcery,\" he continued,without looking at me. \"Or rather, everything in sorcery rests on themanipulation of the assemblage point. You know all this, but you have to repeatit.\"For an instant, as I heard his remarks, I thought I was going to die of anguish.An incredible sense of physical sadness gripped my chest and made me scream withpain. My stomach and diaphragm seemed to be pushing up, moving into my chestcavity. The push was so intense that my awareness changed levels, and I enteredinto my normal state. Whatever we had been talking about became a vague thoughtabout something that might have happened, but actually had not according to themundane reasoning of my everyday-life consciousness.The next time don Juan and I talked about dreaming, we discussed the reasons Ihad been unable to proceed with my dreaming practices for months on end. DonJuan warned me that to explain my situation he had to go in a roundabout way. Hepointed out, first, that there is an enormous difference between the thoughtsand deeds of the men of antiquity and those of modern men. Then he pointed outthat the men of ancient times had a very realistic view of perception andawareness because their view stemmed from their observations of the universearound them. Modern men, in contrast, have an absurdly unrealistic view ofperception and awareness because their view stems from their observations of thesocial order and from their dealings with it.\"Why are you telling me this?\" I asked.\"Because you are a modern man involved with the views and observations of men ofantiquity,\" he replied. \"And none of those views and observations are familiarto you. Now more than ever you need sobriety and aplomb. [* aplomb- greatcoolness and composure under strain] I am trying to make a solid bridge- abridge you can walk on, between the views of men of ancient times and those ofmodern men.\"He remarked that of all the transcendental observations of the men of ancienttimes, the only one with which I was familiar, because it had filtered down toour day, was the idea of selling our souls to the devil in exchange forimmortality; which he admitted sounded to him like something coming straight outof the relationship of the old sorcerers with the inorganic beings. He remindedme how the dreaming emissary had tried to induce me to stay in its realm byoffering me the possibility of maintaining my individuality and self-awarenessfor nearly an eternity.\"As you know, succumbing to the lure of the inorganic beings is not just anidea: It's real,\" don Juan went on. \"But you haven't yet fully realized theimplication of that realness. Dreaming, likewise, is real: It is anenergy-generating condition. You hear my statements and you certainly understandwhat I mean, but your awareness hasn't caught up with the total implication ofit yet.\"Don Juan said that my rationality knew the import of a realization of thisnature, and during our last talk it had forced my awareness to change levels. Iended up in my normal awareness before I could deal with the nuances of mydream. My rationality had further protected itself by suspending my dreamingpractices.\"I assure you that I am fully aware of what an energy-generating conditionmeans,\" I said.\"And I assure you that you are not,\" he retorted. \"If you were, you wouldmeasure dreaming with greater care and deliberation. Since you believe you arejust dreaming, you take blind chances. Your faulty reasoning tells you that nomatter what happens, at a given moment the dream will be over and you will wakeup.\"He was right. In spite of all the things I had witnessed in my dreamingpractices, somehow I still retained the general sense that all of it had been adream.\"I am talking to you about the views of men of antiquity and the views of modernman,\" don Juan went on, \"because your awareness, which is the awareness ofmodern man, prefers to deal with an unfamiliar concept as if it were an emptyideality.\"If I left it up to you, you'd regard dreaming as an idea. Of course, I'm sureyou take dreaming seriously, but you don't quite believe in the reality ofdreaming.\"\"I understand what you are saying, don Juan, but I don't understand why you aresaying it.\"\"I am saying all this because you are now, for the first time, in the properposition to understand that dreaming is an energy-generating condition. For thefirst time, you can understand now that ordinary dreams are the honing devicesused to train the assemblage point to reach the position that creates thisenergy-generating condition we call dreaming.\"He warned me that since dreamers touch and enter real worlds of all-inclusiveeffects, they ought to be in a permanent state of the most intense and sustainedalertness: Any deviation from total alertness imperils the dreamer in ways morethan dreadful.I began again, at this point, to experience a movement in my chest cavity,exactly as I had felt the day my awareness changed levels by itself. Don Juanforcibly shook me by the arm.\"Regard dreaming as something extremely dangerous!\" he commanded me. \"And beginthat now! Don't start any of your weird maneuvers.\"His tone of voice was so urgent that I stopped whatever I was, unconsciously,doing.\"What is going on with me, don Juan?\" I asked.\"What's going on with you is that you can displace your assemblage point quicklyand easily,\" he said. \"Yet that ease has the tendency to make the displacementerratic. Bring your ease to order; and don't allow yourself even a fraction ofan inch leeway.\"I could easily have argued that I did not know what he was talking about; but Iknew. I also knew I had only a few seconds to round up my energy and change myattitude; and I did. This was the end of our exchange that day. I went home, and for nearly a year Ifaithfully and daily repeated what don Juan had asked me to say; that the hingeof sorcery is the mystery of the assemblage point.The results of my litany-like invocation were incredible. I was firmly convincedthat it had the same effect on my awareness that exercise has on the muscles ofthe body. My assemblage point became more agile; which meant that seeing energyin dreaming became the sole goal of my practices. My skill at intending to seegrew in proportion to my efforts. A moment came when I was able just to intendseeing without saying a word; and actually experience the same result as when Ivoiced out loud my intent to see.Don Juan congratulated me on my accomplishment. I, naturally, assumed he wasbeing facetious. He assured me that he meant it, but beseeched me to continueshouting- at least whenever I was at a loss. His request did not seem odd to me.On my own, I had been yelling in my dreams at the top of my voice every time Ideemed it necessary.I discovered that the energy of our world wavers. It scintillates. Not onlyliving beings but everything in our world glimmers with an inner light of itsown. Don Juan explained that the energy of our world consists of layers ofshimmering hues.The top layer is whitish; another, immediately adjacent to it, is chartreuse;and another one, more distant yet, is amber.I found all those hues, or rather I saw glimmers of them whenever items that Iencountered in my dreamlike states changed shapes. However, a whitish glow wasalways the initial impact of seeing anything that generated energy.\"Are there only three different hues?\" I asked don Juan.\"There is an endless number of them,\" he replied, \"but for the purposes of abeginning order, you should be concerned with those three. Later on, you can getas sophisticated as you want and isolate dozens of hues if you are able to doit.\"The whitish layer is the hue of the present position of mankind's assemblagepoint,\" don Juan continued. \"Let's say that it is a modern hue. Sorcerersbelieve that everything man does nowadays is tinted with that whitish glow. Atanother time, the position of mankind's assemblage point made the hue of theruling energy in the world chartreuse; and at another time, more distant yet, itmade it amber. The color of sorcerers' energy is amber; which means that theyare energetically associated with the men who existed in a distant past.\"\"Do you think, don Juan, that the present whitish hue will change someday?\"\"If man is capable of evolving. The grand task of sorcerers is to bring forththe idea that, in order to evolve, man must first free his awareness from itsbindings to the social order. Once awareness is free, intent will redirect itinto a new evolutionary path.\"\"Do you think sorcerers will succeed in that task?\"\"They have already succeeded. They themselves are the proof. To convince othersof the value and import of evolving is another matter.\" The other kind of energy I found present in our world but alien to it was thescouts' energy; the energy don Juan had called sizzling. I encountered scores ofitems in my dreams that, once I saw them, turned into blobs of energy thatseemed to be frying; bubbling with some heatlike inner activity.\"Bear in mind that not every scout you are going to find belongs to the realm ofinorganic beings,\" don Juan remarked. \"Every scout you have found so far, exceptfor the blue scout, has been from that realm; but that was because the inorganicbeings were catering to you. They were directing the show. Now you are on yourown. Some of the scouts you will encounter are going to be, not from theinorganic beings' realm, but from other even more distant levels of awareness.\"\"Are the scouts aware of themselves?\" I asked.\"Most certainly,\" he replied.\"Then why don't they make contact with us when we are awake?\"\"They do. But our great misfortune is to have our consciousness so fully engagedthat we don't have time to pay attention. In our sleep, however, thetwo-way-traffic trapdoor opens: We dream. And in our dreams, we make contact.\"\"Is there any way to tell whether the scouts are from a level besides theinorganic beings' world?\"\"The greater their sizzling, the farther they come from. It sounds simplistic,but you have to let your energy body tell you what is what. I assure you, it'llmake very fine distinctions and unerring judgments when faced with alienenergy.\" He was right again. Without much ado, my energy body distinguished two generaltypes of alien energy. The first was the scouts from the inorganic beings'realm. Their energy fizzled mildly. There was no sound to it, but it had all theovert appearance of effervescence, or of water that is starting to boil.The energy of the second general type of scouts gave me the impression ofconsiderably more power. Those scouts seemed to be just about to burn. Theyvibrated from within as if they were filled with pressurized gas.My encounters with the alien energy were always fleeting because I paid totalattention to what don Juan recommended. He said, \"Unless you know exactly whatyou are doing and what you want out of alien energy, you have to be content witha brief glance. Anything beyond a glance is as dangerous and as stupid aspetting a rattlesnake.\"\"Why is it dangerous, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Scouts are always very aggressive and extremely daring,\" he said. \"They have tobe that way in order to prevail in their explorations. Sustaining our dreamingattention on them is tantamount to soliciting their awareness to focus on us.Once they focus their attention on us, we are compelled to go with them. Andthat, of course, is the danger. We may end up in worlds beyond our energeticpossibilities.\"Don Juan explained that there are many more types of scouts than the two I hadclassified, but that at my present level of energy I could only focus on three.He described the first two types as the easiest to spot. Their disguises in ourdreams are so outlandish, he said, that they immediately attract our dreamingattention. He depicted the scouts of the third type as the most dangerous interms of aggressiveness and power- and because they hide behind subtledisguises.\"One of the strangest things dreamers find, which you yourself will findpresently,\" don Juan continued, \"is this third type of scout. So far, you havefound samples of only the first two types, but that's because you haven't lookedin the right place.\"\"And what is the right place, don Juan?\"\"You have again fallen prey to words; this time the culprit word is 'items',which you have taken to mean only things, objects. Well, the most ferociousscout hides behind people in our dreams. A formidable surprise was in store forme in my dreaming when I focused my gaze on the dream image of my mother. AfterI voiced my intent to see, she turned into a ferocious, frightening bubble ofsizzling energy.\"Don Juan paused to let his statements sink in. I felt stupid for being disturbedat the possibility of finding a scout behind the dream image of my mother.\"It's annoying that they are always associated with the dream images of ourparents or close friends,\" he went on. \"Perhaps that's why we often feel ill atease when we dream of them.\" His grin gave me the impression that he wasenjoying my turmoil. \"A rule of thumb for dreamers is to assume that the thirdtype of scout is present whenever they feel perturbed by their parents orfriends in a dream. Sound advice is to avoid those dream images. They are sheerpoison.\"\"Where does the blue scout stand in relation to the other scouts?\" I asked.\"Blue energy doesn't sizzle,\" he replied. \"It is like ours; it wavers, but it isblue instead of white. Blue energy doesn't exist in a natural state in ourworld.\"And this brings us to something we've never talked about. What color were thescouts you've seen so far?\"Until the moment he mentioned it, I had never thought about this. I told donJuan that the scouts I had seen were either pink or reddish. And he said thatthe deadly scouts of the third type were bright orange.I found out myself that the third type of scout is outright scary. Every time Ifound one of them, it was behind the dream images of my parents, especially ofmy mother. Seeing it always reminded me of the blob of energy that had attackedme in my first deliberate seeing dream. Every time I found it, the alienexploring energy actually seemed about to jump on me. My energy body used toreact with horror even before I saw it.During our next discussion of dreaming, I queried don Juan about the totalabsence of inorganic beings in my dreaming practices.\"Why don't they show up anymore?\" I asked.\"They only show themselves at the beginning,\" he explained. \"After their scoutstake us to their world, there is no necessity for the inorganic beings'projections. If we want to see the inorganic beings, a scout takes us there. Forno one, and I mean no one, can journey by himself to their realm.\"\"Why is that so, don Juan?\"\"Their world is sealed. No one can enter or leave without the consent of theinorganic beings. The only thing you can do by yourself once you are inside is,of course, voice your intent to stay. To say it out loud means to set in motioncurrents of energy that are irreversible. In olden times, words were incrediblypowerful. Now they are not. But in the inorganic beings' realm, words haven'tlost their power.\"Don Juan laughed and said that he had no business saying anything about theinorganic beings' world because I really knew more about it than he and all hiscompanions combined.\"There is one last issue related to that world that we haven't discussed,\" hesaid.He paused for a long while, as if searching for the appropriate words.\"In the final analysis,\" he began, \"my aversion to the old sorcerers' activitiesis very personal. As a nagual, I detest what they did. They cowardly soughtrefuge in the inorganic beings' world. They argued that in a predatorialuniverse poised to rip us apart, the only possible haven for us is in thatrealm.\"\"Why did they believe that?\" I asked.\"Because it's true,\" he said. \"Since the inorganic beings can't lie, the salespitch of the dreaming emissary is all true. That world can give us shelter andprolong our awareness for nearly an eternity.\"\"The emissary's sales pitch, even if it's the truth, has no appeal to me,\" Isaid.\"Do you mean you will chance a road that might rip you apart?\" he asked with anote of bewilderment in his voice.I assured don Juan that I did not want the inorganic beings' world no matterwhat advantages it offered. My statement seemed to please him to no end.\"You are ready then for one final statement about that world. The most dreadfulstatement I can make,\" he said, and tried smile, but did not quite make it.Don Juan searched in my eyes, I suppose for a glimmer agreement orcomprehension. He was silent for a moment.\"The energy necessary to move the assemblage points of sorcerers comes from therealm of inorganic beings,\" he said, as if he were hurrying to get it over with.My heart nearly stopped. I felt a vertigo and had to stomp my feet on the groundnot to faint.Don Juan went on, \"This is the truth, and the legacy of the old sorcerers to us.They have us pinned down to this day. This is the reason I don't like them. Iresent having to dip into one source alone. Personally, I refuse to do it.\"And I have tried to steer you away from it; but with no success becausesomething pulls you to that world, like a magnet.\"I understood don Juan better than I could have thought. Journeying to that worldhad always meant to me, at an energetic level, a boost of dark energy. I hadeven thought of it in those terms, long before don Juan voiced his statement.\"What can we do about it?\" I asked.\"We can't have dealings with them,\" he answered, \"and yet we can't stay awayfrom them. My solution has been to take their energy but not give in to theirinfluence. This is known as the ultimate stalking. It is done by sustaining theunbending intent of freedom even though no sorcerer knows what freedom reallyis.\"\"Can you explain to me, don Juan, why sorcerers have to take energy from therealm of inorganic beings?\"\"There is no other viable energy for sorcerers. In order to maneuver theassemblage point in the manner they do, sorcerers need an inordinate amount ofenergy.\"I reminded him of his own statement: that a redeployment of energy is necessaryin order to do dreaming.\"That is correct,\" he replied. \"To start dreaming sorcerers need to redefinetheir premises and save their energy, but that redefining is valid only to havethe necessary energy to set up dreaming. To fly into other realms, to seeenergy, to forge the energy body, et cetera, et cetera, is another matter. Forthose maneuvers, sorcerers need loads of dark, alien energy.\"\"But how do they take it from the inorganic beings' world?\"\"By the mere act of going to that world. All the sorcerers of our line have todo this. However, none of us is idiotic enough to do what you've done. But thisis because none of us has your proclivities.\" [* proclivities- naturalinclinations]Don Juan sent me home to ponder what he had revealed to me. I had endlessquestions, but he did not want to hear any of them.\"All the questions you have, you can answer yourself,\" he said as he wavedgood-bye to me. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"10. Stalking the StalkersAt home, I soon realized that it was impossible for me to answer any of myquestions. In fact, I could not even formulate them. Perhaps that was becausethe boundary of the second attention had begun to collapse on me: This was whenI met Florinda Grau and Carol Tiggs in the world of everyday life. The confusionof not knowing them at all yet knowing them so intimately that I would have diedfor them at the drop of a hat was most deleterious to me. I had met TaishaAbelar a few years before, and I was just beginning to get used to theconfounded feeling of knowing her without having the vaguest idea of how. To addtwo more people to my overloaded system proved too much for me. I got ill out offatigue and had to seek don Juan's aid. I went to the town in southern Mexicowhere he and his companions lived.Don Juan and his fellow sorcerers laughed uproariously at the mere mention of myturmoils. Don Juan explained to me that they were not really laughing at me, butat themselves. My cognitive problems reminded them of the ones they had had whenthe boundary of the second attention had collapsed on them just as it had on me.Their awareness, like mine, had not been prepared for it, don Juan said.\"Every sorcerer goes through the same agony,\" don Juan went on. \"Awareness is anendless area of exploration for sorcerers and man in general. In order toenhance awareness, there is no risk we should not run; no means we shouldrefuse. Bear in mind, however, that only in soundness of mind can awareness beenhanced.\"Don Juan reiterated, then, that his time was coming to an end, and that I had touse my resources wisely to cover as much ground as I could before he left. Talklike that had used to throw me into states of profound depression. But as thetime of his departure approached, I had begun to react with more resignation. Ihad no longer felt depressed, but I still panicked.Nothing else was said after that. The next day, at his request, I drove don Juanto Mexico City. We arrived around noon and went directly to the hotel del Prado,in the Paseo Alameda, the place he usually lodged when he was in the city. DonJuan had an appointment with a lawyer that day at four in the afternoon. Sincewe had plenty of time, we went to have lunch in the famous Cafe Tacuba, arestaurant in the heart of downtown where it was purported that real meals wereserved.Don Juan was not hungry. He ordered only two sweet tamales, while I gorgedmyself on a sumptuous feast. He laughed at me and made signs of silent despairat my healthy appetite.\"I'm going to propose a line of action for you,\" he said in a curt tone when wehad finished our lunch. \"It's the last task of the third gate of dreaming, andit consists of stalking the stalkers; a most mysterious maneuver. To stalk thestalkers means to deliberately draw energy from the inorganic beings' realm inorder to perform a sorcery feat.\"\"What kind of sorcery feat, don Juan?\"\"A journey; a journey that uses awareness as an element of the environment,\" heexplained. \"In the world of daily life, water is an element of the environmentthat we use for traveling. Imagine awareness being a similar element that can beused for traveling. Through the medium of awareness, scouts from all over theuniverse come to us, and vice versa; via awareness, sorcerers go to the ends ofthe universe.\"There had been certain concepts, among the hosts of concepts don Juan had mademe aware of in the course of his teachings, that attracted my full interestwithout any coaxing. This was one.\"The idea that awareness is a physical element is revolutionary,\" I said in awe.\"I didn't say it's a physical element,\" he corrected me. \"It's an energeticelement. You have to make that distinction. For sorcerers who see, awareness isa glow. They can hitch their energy body to that glow and go with it.\"\"What's the difference between a physical and an energetic element?\" I asked.\"The difference is that physical elements are part of our interpretation system,but energetic elements are not. Energetic elements, like awareness, exist in ouruniverse. But we, as average people, perceive only the physical elements becausewe were taught to do so. Sorcerers perceive the energetic elements for the samereason: They were taught to do so.\"Don Juan explained that the use of awareness as an energetic element of ourenvironment is the essence of sorcery; that in terms of practicalities, thetrajectory of sorcery is, first, to free the existing energy in us by impeccablyfollowing the sorcerers' path; second, to use that energy to develop the energybody by means of dreaming; and, third, to use awareness as an element of theenvironment in order to enter with the energy body and all our physicality intoother worlds.\"There are two kinds of energy journeys into other worlds,\" he went on. \"One iswhen awareness picks up the sorcerer's energy body and takes it wherever it may;and the other is when the sorcerer decides, in full consciousness, to use theavenue of awareness to make a journey. You've done the first kind of journeying.It takes an enormous discipline to do the second.\"After a long silence, don Juan stated that in the life of sorcerers there areissues that require masterful handling; and that dealing with awareness as anenergetic element open to the energy body is the most important, vital, anddangerous of those issues.I had no comment. I was suddenly on pins and needles; hanging on every one ofhis words.\"By yourself, you don't have enough energy to perform the last task of the thirdgate of dreaming,\" he went on, \"but you and Carol Tiggs together can certainlydo what I have in mind.\"He paused, deliberately egging me on with his silence to ask what he had inmind. I did. His laughter only increased the ominous mood.\"I want you two to break the boundaries of the normal world, and using awarenessas an energetic element, enter into another,\" he said. \"This breaking andentering amounts to stalking the stalkers. Using awareness as an element of theenvironment bypasses the influence of the inorganic beings, but it still usestheir energy.\"He did not want to give me any more information- in order not to influence me-he said. His belief was that the less I knew beforehand the better off I wouldbe. I disagreed, but he assured me that, in a pinch, my energy body wasperfectly capable of taking care of itself.We went from the restaurant to the lawyer's office. Don Juan quickly concludedhis business, and we were, in no time at all, in a taxi on our way to theairport. Don Juan informed me that Carol Tiggs was arriving on a flight from LosAngeles, and that she was coming to Mexico City exclusively to fulfill this lastdreaming task with me.\"The valley of Mexico is a superb place to perform the kind of sorcery feat youare after,\" he commented.\"You haven't told me yet what the exact steps to follow are,\" I said.He didn't answer me. We did not speak any more, but while we waited for theplane to land, he explained the procedure I had to follow. I was to go toCarol's room at the Regis Hotel across the street from our hotel, and aftergetting into a state of total inner silence with her, we had to slip gently intodreaming; voicing our intent to go to the realm of the inorganic beings.I interrupted to remind him that I always had to wait for a scout to show upbefore I could manifest out loud my intent to go to the inorganic beings' world.Don Juan chuckled and said, \"You haven't dreamt with Carol Tiggs yet. You'llfind out that it's a treat. Sorceresses don't need any props. They just go tothat world whenever they want to; for them, there is a scout on permanent call.\"I could not bring myself to believe that a sorceress would be able to do what hewas asserting. I thought I had a degree of expertise in handling the inorganicbeings' world. When I mentioned to him what was going through my mind, heretorted that I had no expertise whatsoever when it came to what sorceresses arecapable of.\"Why do you think I had Carol Tiggs with me to pull you bodily out of thatworld?\" he asked. \"Do you think it was because she's beautiful?\"\"Why was it, don Juan?\"\"Because I couldn't do it myself; and for her, it was nothing. She has a knackfor that world.\"\"Is she an exceptional case, don Juan?\"\"Women in general have a natural bent for that realm; sorceresses are, ofcourse, the champions, but Carol Tiggs is better than anyone I know because she,as the nagual woman, has superb energy.\"I thought I had caught don Juan in a serious contradiction. He had told me thatthe inorganic beings were not interested at all in women. Now he was assertingthe opposite.\"No. I'm not asserting the opposite,\" he remarked when I confronted him. \"I'vesaid to you that the inorganic beings don't pursue females; they only go aftermales. But I've also said to you that the inorganic beings are female, and thatthe entire universe is female to a large degree. So draw your own conclusions.\"Since I had no way to draw any conclusions, Don Juan explained to me thatsorceresses, in theory, come and go as they please in that world because oftheir enhanced awareness and their femaleness.\"Do you know this for a fact?\" I asked.\"The women of my party have never done that,\" he confessed, \"not because theycan't but because I dissuaded them. The women of your party, on the other hand,do it like changing skirts.\"I felt a vacuum in my stomach. I really did not know anything about the women ofmy party. Don Juan consoled me saying that my circumstances were different fromhis; as was my role as a nagual. He assured me that I did not have it in me todissuade any of the women of my party, even if I stood on my head.As the taxi drove us to her hotel, Carol delighted don Juan and me with herimpersonations of people we knew. I tried to be serious and questioned her aboutour task. She mumbled some apologies for not being able to answer me with theseriousness I deserved. Don Juan laughed uproariously when she mimicked mysolemn tone of voice.After registering Carol at the hotel, the three of us meandered around downtownlooking for secondhand bookstores. We ate a light dinner at the Sanborn'srestaurant in the House of Tiles. About ten o'clock, we walked to the RegisHotel. We went directly to the elevator. My fear had sharpened my capacity toperceive details. The hotel building was old and massive. The furniture in thelobby had obviously seen better days. Yet there was still, all around us,something left of an old glory that had a definite appeal. I could easilyunderstand why Carol liked that hotel so much.Before we got into the elevator, my anxiety mounted to such heights that I hadto ask don Juan for last-minute instructions.\"Tell me again how we are going to proceed,\" I begged.Don Juan pulled us to the huge, ancient stuffed chairs in the lobby andpatiently explained to us that, once we were in the world of the inorganicbeings, we had to voice our intent to transfer our normal awareness to ourenergy bodies. He suggested that Carol and I voice our intent together, althoughthat part was not really important. What was important, he said, was that eachof us intend the transfer of the total awareness of our daily world to ourenergy body.\"How do we do this transference of awareness?\" I asked.\"Transferring awareness is purely a matter of voicing our intent and having thenecessary amount of energy,\" he said. \"Carol knows all this. She's done itbefore. She entered physically into the inorganic beings' world when she pulledyou out of it, remember? Her energy will do the trick. It'll tip the scales.\"\"What does it mean to tip the scales? I am in limbo, don Juan.\"Don Juan explained that to tip the scales meant to add one's total physical massto the energy body. He said that using awareness as a medium to make the journeyinto another world is not the result of applying any techniques, but is ratherthe corollary of intending and having enough energy. The bulk of energy fromCarol Tiggs added to mine- or the bulk of my energy added to Carol's- was goingto make us into one single entity; energetically capable of pulling ourphysicality and placing it on the energy body in order to make that journey.\"What exactly do we have to do in order to enter into that other world?\" Carolasked. Her question scared me half to death: I thought she knew what was goingon.\"Your total physical mass has to be added to your energy body,\" don Juanreplied, looking into her eyes. \"The great difficulty of this maneuver is todiscipline the energy body, a thing the two of you have already done. Lack ofdiscipline is the only reason the two of you may fail in performing this feat ofultimate stalking. Sometimes, as a fluke, an average person ends up performingit and entering into another world. But this is immediately explained away asinsanity or hallucination.\"I would have given anything in the world for don Juan to continue talking. Buthe put us in the elevator, and we went up to the second floor to Carol's roomdespite my protests and my rational need to know. Deep down, however, my turmoilwas not so much that I needed to know: The bottom line was my fear. Somehow,this sorcerers' maneuver was more frightening to me than anything I had done sofar.Don Juan's parting words to us were \"Forget the self and you will fear nothing.\"His grin and the nodding of his head were invitations to ponder the statement.Carol laughed and began to clown; imitating don Juan's voice as he gave us hiscryptic instructions. Her lisping added quite a bit of color to what don Juanhad said. Sometimes I found her lisping adorable. Most of the time, I detestedit. Fortunately, that night her lisping was hardly noticeable.We went to her room and sat down on the edge of the bed. My last consciousthought was that the bed was a relic from the beginning of the century. Before Ihad time to utter a single word, I found myself in a strange-looking bed. Carolwas with me. She half sat up at the same time I did. We were naked, each coveredwith a thin blanket.\"What's going on?\" she asked in a feeble voice.\"Are you awake?\" I asked inanely.\"Of course I am awake,\" she said in an impatient tone.\"Do you remember where we were?\" I asked. There was a long silence, as sheobviously tried to put her thoughts in order.\"I think I am real, but you are not,\" she finally said. \"I know where I wasbefore this. And you want to trick me.\"I thought she was doing the same thing herself: that she knew what was going onand was testing me or pulling my leg. Don Juan had told me that her demons andmine were caginess and distrust. I was having a grand sample of that.\"I refuse to be part of any shit where you are in control,\" she said. She lookedat me with venom in her eyes. \"I am talking to you, whoever you are.\"She took one of the blankets we had been covered with and wrapped herself withit. \"I am going to lie here and go back to where I came from,\" she said, with anair of finality. \"You and the nagual go and play with each other.\"\"You have to stop this nonsense,\" I said forcefully. \"We are in another world.\"She didn't pay any attention and turned her back to me like an annoyed, pamperedchild. I did not want to waste my dreaming attention in futile discussions ofrealness. I began to examine my surroundings. The only light in the room wasmoonlight shining through the window directly in front of us. We were in a smallroom, on a high bed. I noticed that the bed was primitively constructed. Fourthick posts had been planted in the ground, and the bed frame was a lattice,made of long poles attached to the posts. The bed had a thick mattress, orrather a compact mattress. There were no sheets or pillows. Filled burlap sackswere stacked up against the walls. Two sacks by the foot of the bed, staggeredone on top of the other, served as a stepladder to climb onto it.Looking for a light switch, I became aware that the high bed was in a corner,against the wall. Our heads were to the wall; I was on the outside of the bedand Carol on the inside. When I sat on the edge of the bed, I realized that itwas perhaps over three feet above the ground.Carol sat up suddenly and said with a heavy lisp, \"This is disgusting! Thenagual certainly didn't tell me I was going to end up like this.\"\"I didn't know it either,\" I said. I wanted to say more and start aconversation, but my anxiety had grown to extravagant proportions.\"You shut up,\" she snapped at me, her voice cracking with anger. \"You don'texist. You're a ghost. Disappear! Disappear!\"Her lisping was actually cute and distracted me from my obsessive fear. I shookher by the shoulders. She yelled, not so much in pain as in surprise orannoyance.\"I'm not a ghost,\" I said. \"We made the journey because we joined our energy.\"Carol Tiggs was famous among us for her speed in adapting to any situation. Inno time at all, she was convinced of the realness of our predicament and beganto look for her clothes in the semidarkness. I marveled at the fact that she wasnot afraid. She became busy, reasoning out loud where she might have put herclothes had she gone to bed in that room.\"Do you see any chair?\" she asked.I faintly saw a stack of three sacks that might have served as a table or highbench. She got out of the bed, went to it, and found her clothes and mine,neatly folded, the way she always handled garments. She handed my clothes to me:They were my clothes, but not the ones I had been wearing a few minutes before,in Carol's room at the Regis Hotel.\"These are not my clothes,\" she lisped. \"And yet they are mine. How strange!\"We dressed in silence. I wanted to tell her that I was about to burst withanxiety. I also wanted to comment on the speed of our journey, but in the time Ihad taken to dress, the thought of our journey had become very vague. I couldhardly remember where we had been before waking up in that room. It was as if Ihad dreamt the hotel room. I made a supreme effort to recollect, to push awaythe vagueness that had begun to envelop me. I succeeded in dispelling the fog,but that act exhausted all my energy. I ended up panting and sweating.\"Something nearly, nearly got me,\" Carol said. I looked at her. She, like me,was covered with perspiration. \"It nearly got you too. What do you think it is?\"\"The position of the assemblage point,\" I said with absolute certainty.She did not agree with me. \"It's the inorganic beings collecting their dues,\"she said shivering. \"The nagual told me it was going to be horrible, but I neverimagined anything this horrible.\"I was in total agreement with her; we were in a horrifying mess, yet I could notconceive what the horror of that situation was. Carol and I were not novices: Wehad seen and done endless things, some of them outright terrifying. But therewas something in that dream room that chilled me beyond belief.\"We are dreaming, aren't we?\" Carol asked.Without hesitation, I reassured her that we were, although I would have givenanything to have don Juan there to reassure me of the same thing.\"Why am I so frightened?\" she asked me, as if I were capable of rationallyexplaining it.Before I could formulate a thought about it, she answered her question herself.She said that what frightened her was to realize, at a body level, thatperceiving is an all-inclusive act when the assemblage point has beenimmobilized on one position. She reminded me that don Juan had told us that thepower our daily world has over us is a result of the fact that our assemblagepoint is immobile on its habitual position. This immobility is what makes ourperception of the world so inclusive and overpowering that we cannot escape fromit. Carol also reminded me about another thing the nagual had said: that if wewant to break this totally inclusive force, all we have to do is dispel the fog,that is to say, displace the assemblage point by intending its displacement.I had never really understood what don Juan meant until the moment I had tobring my assemblage point to another position, in order to dispel that world'sfog, which had begun to swallow me.Carol and I, without saying another word, went to the window and looked out. Wewere in the country. The moonlight revealed some low, dark shapes of dwellingstructures. By all indications, we were in the utility or supply room of a farmor a big country house.\"Do you remember going to bed here?\" Carol asked.\"I almost do,\" I said and meant it. I told her I had to fight to keep the imageof her hotel room in my mind as a point of reference.\"I have to do the same,\" she said in a frightened whisper. \"I know that if welet go of that memory, we are goners.\"Then she asked me if I wanted us to leave that shack and venture outside. I didnot. My apprehension was so acute that I was unable to voice my words. I couldonly give her a signal with my head.\"You are so very right not to want to go out,\" she said. \"I have the feelingthat if we leave this shack, we'll never make it back.\"I was going to open the door and just look outside, but she stopped me.\"Don't do that,\" she said. \"You might let the outside in.\"The thought that crossed my mind at that instant was that we had been placedinside a frail cage. Anything, such as opening the door, might upset theprecarious balance of that cage. At the moment I had that thought, both of ushad the same urge. We took off our clothes as if our lives depended on that. Wethen jumped into the high bed without using the two sack steps- only to jumpdown from it in the next instant.It was evident that Carol and I had the same realization at the same time. Sheconfirmed my assumption when she said, \"Anything that we use belonging to thisworld can only weaken us. If I stand here naked and away from the bed and awayfrom the window, I don't have any problem remembering where I came from. But ifI lie in that bed or wear those clothes or look out the window, I am done for.\"We stood in the center of the room for a long time, huddled together. A weirdsuspicion began to fester in my mind. \"How are we going to return to our world?\"I asked, expecting her to know.\"The reentry into our world is automatic if we don't let the fog set in,\" shesaid with the air of a foremost authority; which was her trademark.And she was right. Carol and I woke up, at the same time, in the bed of her roomin the Regis Hotel. It was so obvious we were back in the world of daily lifethat we didn't ask questions or make comments about it. The sunlight was nearlyblinding.\"How did we get back?\" Carol asked. \"Or rather, when did we get back?\"I had no idea what to say or what to think. I was too numb to speculate, whichwas all I could have done.\"Do you think that we just returned?\" Carol insisted. \"Or maybe we've beenasleep here all night. Look! We're naked. When did we take our clothes off?\"\"We took them off in that other world,\" I said and surprised myself with thesound of my voice.My answer seemed to stump Carol. She looked uncomprehendingly at me and then ather own naked body.We sat there without moving for an endless time. Both of us seemed to bedeprived of volition. But then, quite abruptly, we had the same thought atexactly the same time. We got dressed in record time, ran out of the room, wentdown two flights of stairs, crossed the street, and rushed into don Juan'shotel.Inexplicably and excessively out of breath, since we had not really exertedourselves physically, we took turns explaining to him what we had done. Heconfirmed our conjectures.\"What you two did was about the most dangerous thing one can imagine,\" he said.He addressed Carol and told her that our attempt had been both a total successand a fiasco. We had succeeded in transferring our awareness of the daily worldto our energy bodies, thus making the journey with all our physicality, but wehad failed in avoiding the influence of the inorganic beings. He said thatordinarily dreamers experience the whole maneuver as a series of slowtransitions, and that they have to voice their intent to use awareness as anelement. In our case, all those steps were dispensed with. Because of theintervention of the inorganic beings, the two of us had actually been hurledinto a deadly world with a most terrifying speed.\"It wasn't your combined energy that made your journey possible,\" he continued.\"Something else did that. It even selected adequate clothes for you.\"\"Do you mean, nagual, that the clothes and the bed and the room happened onlybecause we were being run by the inorganic beings?\" Carol asked.\"You bet your life,\" he replied. \"Ordinarily, dreamers are merely voyeurs. Theway your journey turned out, you two got a ringside seat and lived the oldsorcerers' damnation. What happened to them was precisely what happened to you.The inorganic beings took them to worlds from which they could not return. Ishould have known, but it didn't even enter my mind that the inorganic beingswould take over and try to set up the same trap for you two.\"\"Do you mean they wanted to keep us there?\" Carol asked.\"If you had gotten outside that shack, you'd now be meandering hopelessly inthat world,\" don Juan said.He explained that since we entered into that world with all our physicality, thefixation of our assemblage points on the position preselected by the inorganicbeings was so overpowering that it created a sort of fog that obliterated anymemory of the world we came from. He added that the natural consequence of suchan immobility, as in the case of the sorcerers of antiquity, is that thedreamer's assemblage point cannot return to its habitual position.\"Think about this,\" he urged us. \"Perhaps this is exactly what is happening toall of us in the world of daily life. We are here, and the fixation of ourassemblage point is so overpowering that it has made us forget where we camefrom, and what our purpose was for coming here.\"Don Juan did not want to say any more about our journey. I felt that he wassparing us further discomfort and fear. He took us to eat a late lunch. By thetime we reached the restaurant, a couple of blocks down Francisco Madero Avenue,it was six o'clock in the afternoon. Carol and I had slept, if that is what wedid, about eighteen hours.Only don Juan was hungry. Carol remarked with a touch of anger that he waseating like a pig. Quite a few heads turned in our direction on hearing donJuan's laughter.It was a warm night. The sky was clear. There was a soft, caressing breeze as wesat down on a bench in the Paseo Alameda.\"There is a question that's burning me,\" Carol said to don Juan. \"We didn't useawareness as a medium for traveling, right?\"\"That's true,\" don Juan said and sighed deeply. \"The task was to sneak by theinorganic beings, not be run by them.\"\"What's going to happen now?\" she asked.\"You are going to postpone stalking the stalkers until you two are stronger,\" hesaid. \"Or perhaps you'll never accomplish it. It doesn't really matter: If onething doesn't work, another will. Sorcery is an endless challenge.\"He explained to us again, as if he were trying to fix his explanation in ourminds, that in order to use awareness as an element of the environment, dreamersfirst have to make a journey to the inorganic beings' realm. Then they have touse that journey as a springboard, and, while they are in possession of thenecessary dark energy, they have to intend to be hurled through the medium ofawareness into another world.\"The failure of your trip was that you didn't have time to use awareness as anelement for traveling,\" he went on. \"Before you even got to the inorganicbeings' world, you two were already in another world.\"\"What do you recommend we do?\" Carol asked. \"I recommend that you see as littleof each other as possible,\" he said. \"I'm sure the inorganic beings will notpass up the opportunity to get you two, especially if you join forces.\"So Carol Tiggs and I deliberately stayed away from each other from then on. Theprospect that we might inadvertently elicit a similar journey was too great arisk for us. Don Juan encouraged our decision by repeating over and over that wehad enough combined energy to tempt the inorganic beings to lure us again.Don Juan brought my dreaming practices back to seeing energy inenergy-generating dreamlike states. In the course of time, I saw everything thatpresented itself to me. I entered in this manner into a most peculiar state: Ibecame incapable of rendering intelligently what I saw. My sensation was alwaysthat I had reached states of perception for which I had no lexicon. [* lexicon-(1.) a lamgauge user's knowledge of words (2.) a reference book containing analphabetical list of words]Don Juan explained my incomprehensible and indescribable visions as my energybody using awareness as an element not for journeying, because I never hadenough energy, but for entering into the energy fields of inanimate matter or ofliving beings. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"11. The TenantThere were no more dreaming practices for me, as I was accustomed to havingthem. The next time I saw don Juan, he put me under the guidance of two women ofhis party: Florinda and Zuleica- his two closest cohorts. Their instruction wasnot at all about the gates of dreaming but about different ways to use theenergy body, and it did not last long enough to be influential. They gave me theimpression that they were more interested in checking me out than in teaching meanything.\"There is nothing else I can teach you about dreaming,\" don Juan said when Iquestioned him about this state of affairs. \"My time on this earth is up. ButFlorinda will stay. She's the one who will direct, not only you, but all myother apprentices.\"\"Will she continue my dreaming practices?\"\"I don't know that, and neither does she. It's all up to the spirit. The realplayer. We are not players ourselves. We are mere pawns in its hands. Followingthe commands of the spirit, I have to tell you what the fourth gate of dreamingis, although I can't guide you anymore.\"\"What's the point of whetting my appetite? I'd rather not know.\"\"The spirit is not leaving that up to me or to you. I have to outline the fourthgate of dreaming for you, whether I like it or not.\"Don Juan explained that, at the fourth gate of dreaming, the energy body travelsto specific, concrete places and that there are three ways of using the fourthgate: one, to travel to concrete places in this world; two, to travel toconcrete places out of this world; and, three, to travel to places that existonly in the intent of others. He stated that the last one is the most difficultand dangerous of the three and was, by far, the old sorcerers' predilection.\"What do you want me to do with this knowledge?\" I asked.\"Nothing for the moment. File it away until you need it.\"\"Do you mean that I can cross the fourth gate by myself, without help?\"\"Whether or not you can do that is up to the spirit.\"He abruptly dropped the subject, but he did not leave me with the sensation thatI should try to reach and cross the fourth gate by myself.Don Juan then made one last appointment with me to give me, he said, asorcerers' send-off: the concluding touch of my dreaming practices. He told meto meet him in the small town in southern Mexico where he and his sorcerercompanions lived.I arrived there in the late afternoon. Don Juan and I sat in the patio of hishouse on some uncomfortable wicker chairs fitted with thick, oversize pillows.Don Juan laughed and winked at me. The chairs were a gift from one of the womenmembers of his party. The chairs had been bought for him in Phoenix, Arizona,and with great difficulty brought into Mexico. He said we simply had to sit asif nothing was bothering us, especially him.Don Juan asked me to read to him a poem by Dylan Thomas, which he said had themost pertinent meaning for me at that point in time. I have longed to move awayFrom the hissing of the spent lieAnd the old terrors' continual cryGrowing more terrible as the dayGoes over the hill into the deep sea... I have longed to move away but am afraid;Some life, yet unspent, might explodeOut of the old lie burning on the ground,And, crackling into the air, leave me half-blind. Don Juan stood up and said that he was going for a walk in the plaza, in thecenter of town. He asked me to come along. I immediately assumed that the poemhad evoked a negative response in him and he needed to dispel it.We reached the square plaza without having said a word. We walked around it acouple of times, still not talking. There were quite a number of people, millingaround the stores on the streets facing the east and north sides of the park.All the streets around the plaza were unevenly paved. The houses were massive,one-story adobe buildings with tiled roofs, whitewashed walls, and blue or brownpainted doors. On a side street, a block away from the plaza, the high walls ofthe enormous colonial church, which looked like a Moorish mosque, loomedominously over the roof of the only hotel in town. On the south side, there weretwo restaurants, which inexplicably coexisted side by side, doing good business,serving practically the same menu at the same prices.I broke the silence and asked don Juan whether he also found it odd that bothrestaurants were just about the same.\"Everything is possible in this town,\" he replied.The way he said it made me feel uneasy.\"Why are you so nervous?\" he asked, with a serious expression. \"Do you knowsomething you're not telling me?\"\"Why am I nervous? That's a laugh. I am always nervous around you, don Juan.Sometimes more so than others.\"He seemed to be making a serious effort not to laugh.\"Naguals are not really the most friendly beings on earth,\" he said in a tone ofapology. \"I learned this the hard way, being pitted against my teacher, theterrible nagual Julian. His mere presence used to scare the daylights out of me.And when he used to zero in on me, I always thought my life wasn't worth a plugnickel.\"\"Unquestionably, don Juan, you have the same effect on me.\"He laughed openly. \"No, no. You are definitely exaggerating. I'm an angel incomparison.\"\"You may be an angel in comparison, except that I don't have the nagual Julianto compare you with.\"He laughed for a moment, then became serious again.\"I don't know why, but I definitely feel scared,\" I explained.\"Do you feel you have reason to be scared?\" he asked and stopped walking to peerat me.His tone of voice and his raised eyebrows gave me the impression he suspectedthat I knew something I was not revealing to him. He was clearly expecting adisclosure on my part.\"Your insistence makes me wonder,\" I said. \"Are you sure you are not the one whohas something up his sleeve?\"\"I do have something up my sleeve,\" he admitted and grinned. \"But that's not theissue. The issue is that there is something in this town awaiting you. And youdon't quite know what it is; or you do know what it is but don't dare to tellme; or you don't know anything about it at all.\"\"What's waiting for me here?\"Instead of answering me, don Juan briskly resumed his walking, and we kept goingaround the plaza in complete silence. We circled it quite a few times, lookingfor a place to sit. Then, a group of young women got up from a bench and left.\"For years now, I have been describing to you the aberrant practices of thesorcerers of ancient Mexico,\" don Juan said as he sat down on the bench andgestured for me to sit by him.With the fervor of someone who has never said it before, he began to tell meagain what he had told me many times; that those sorcerers, guided by extremelyselfish interests, put all their efforts into perfecting practices that pushedthem further and further away from sobriety or mental balance, and that theywere finally exterminated when their complex edifices of beliefs and practicesbecame so cumbersome that they could no longer support them.\"The sorcerers of antiquity, of course, lived and proliferated in this area,\" hesaid, watching my reaction. \"Here in this town. This town was built on theactual foundations of one of their towns. Here in this area, the sorcerers ofantiquity carried on all their dealings.\"\"Do you know this for a fact, don Juan?\"\"I do, and so will you, very soon.\"My mounting anxiety was forcing me to do something I detested; to focus onmyself. Don Juan, sensing my frustration, egged me on.\"Very soon, we'll know whether or not you're really like the old sorcerers, orlike the new ones,\" he said.\"You are driving me nuts with all this strange and ominous talk,\" I protested.Being with don Juan for thirteen years had conditioned me, above everythingelse, to conceive of panic as something that was just around the corner at alltimes, ready to be released.Don Juan seemed to vacillate. I noticed his furtive glances in the direction ofthe church. He was even distracted. When I talked to him, he was not listening.I had to repeat my question.\"Are you waiting for someone?\"\"Yes, I am,\" he said. \"Most certainly I am. I was just sensing the surroundings.You caught me in the act of scanning the area with my energy body.\"\"What did you sense, don Juan?\"\"My energy body senses that everything is in place. The play is on tonight. Youare the main protagonist. I am a character actor with a small but meaningfulrole. I exit in the first act.\"\"What in the world are you talking about?\"He did not answer me. He smiled knowingly.\"I'm preparing the ground,\" he said. \"Warming you up, so to speak, harping onthe idea that modern-day sorcerers have learned a hard lesson. They haverealized that only if they remain totally detached can they have the energy tobe free. Theirs is a peculiar type of detachment which is born not out of fearor indolence, but out of conviction.\"Don Juan paused and stood up, stretched his arms in front of him, to his sides,and then behind him.\"Do the same,\" he advised me. \"It relaxes the body; and you have to be veryrelaxed to face what's coming to you tonight.\" He smiled broadly.\"Either total detachment or utter indulging is coming to you tonight. It is achoice that every nagual in my line has to make.\" He sat down again and took adeep breath. What he had said seemed to have taken all his energy.\"I think I can understand detachment and indulging,\" he went on, \"because I hadthe privilege of knowing two naguals: my benefactor, the nagual Julian, and hisbenefactor, the nagual Elias. I witnessed the difference between the two. Thenagual Elias was detached to the point that he could put aside a gift of power.The nagual Julian was also detached, but not enough to put aside such a gift.\"\"Judging by the way you're talking,\" I said, \"I would say that you are going tospring some sort of test on me tonight. Is that true?\"\"I don't have the power to spring tests of any sort on you, but the spiritdoes.\" He said this with a grin, then added, \"I am merely its agent.\"\"What is the spirit going to do to me, don Juan?\"\"All I can say is that tonight you're going to get a lesson in dreaming the waylessons in dreaming used to be; but you are not going to get that lesson fromme. Someone else is going to be your teacher and guide you tonight.\"\"Who is going to be my teacher and guide?\"\"A visitor who might be a horrendous surprise to you, or no surprise at all.\"\"And what's the lesson in dreaming I am going to get?\"\"It's a lesson about the fourth gate of dreaming. And it is in two parts. Thefirst part I'll explain to you presently. The second part nobody can explain toyou because it is something that pertains only to you. All the naguals of myline got this two-part lesson, but no two of those lessons were alike: They weretailored to fit those naguals' personal bents of character.\"\"Your explanation doesn't help me at all, don Juan. I am getting more and morenervous.\"We remained quiet for a long moment. I was shaken up and fidgety, and did notknow what else to say without actually nagging.\"As you already know, for modern-day sorcerers to perceive energy directly is amatter of personal attainment,\" don Juan said. \"We maneuver the assemblage pointthrough self-discipline. For the old sorcerers, the displacement of theassemblage point was a consequence of their subjugation to others, theirteachers, who accomplished those displacements through dark operations and gavethem to their disciples as gifts of power.\"It's possible for someone with greater energy than ours to do anything to us,\"he went on. For example, the nagual Julian could have turned me into anything hewanted; a fiend or a saint. But he was an impeccable nagual and let me bemyself. The old sorcerers were not that impeccable; and by means of theirceaseless efforts to gain control over others, they created a situation ofdarkness and terror that was passed on from teacher to disciple.\"He stood up and swept his gaze all around us.\"As you can see, this town isn't much,\" he continued, \"but it has a uniquefascination for the warriors of my line. Here lies the source of what we are,and the source of what we don't want to be.\"Since I am at the end of my time, I must pass on to you certain ideas; recountto you certain stories; put you in touch with certain beings right here in thistown, exactly as my benefactor did with me.\"Don Juan said that he was reiterating something I already was familiar with,that whatever he was and everything he knew were a legacy from his teacher, thenagual Julian. He in turn inherited everything from his teacher, the nagualElias. The nagual Elias from the nagual Rosendo; he from the nagual Lujan; thenagual Lujan from the nagual Santisteban; and the nagual Santisteban from thenagual Sebastian.He told me again, in a very formal tone, something he had explained to me manytimes before; that there were eight naguals before the nagual Sebastian, butthat they were quite different. They had a different attitude toward sorcery; adifferent concept of it, although they were still directly related to hissorcery lineage.\"You must recollect now, and repeat to me, everything I've told you about thenagual Sebastian,\" he demanded.His request seemed odd to me, but I repeated everything I had been told by himor by any of his companions about the nagual Sebastian and the mythical oldsorcerer, the death defier, known to them as the tenant.\"You know that the death defier makes us gifts of power every generation,\" donJuan said. \"And the specific nature of those gifts of power is what changed thecourse of our lineage.\"He explained that the tenant, being a sorcerer from the old school, had learnedfrom his teachers all the intricacies of shifting his assemblage point. Since hehad perhaps thousands of years of strange life and awareness- ample time toperfect anything- he knew now how to reach and hold hundreds, if not thousandsof positions of the assemblage point. His gifts were like both maps for shiftingthe assemblage point to specific spots, and manuals on how to immobilize it onany of those positions and thus acquire cohesion.Don Juan was at the peak of his raconteur's form. I had never seen him moredramatic. If I had not known him better, I would have sworn that his voice hadthe deep and worried inflection of someone gripped by fear or preoccupation. Hisgestures gave me the impression of a good actor portraying nervousness andconcern to perfection.Don Juan peered at me, and in the tone and manner of someone making a painfulrevelation, he said that, for instance, the nagual Lujan received from thetenant a gift of fifty positions. He shook his head rhythmically, as if he weresilently asking me to consider what he had just said. I kept quiet.\"Fifty positions!\" he exclaimed in wonder. \"For a gift, one or, at the most, twopositions of the assemblage point should be more than adequate.\"He shrugged his shoulders, gesturing bewilderment.\"I was told that the tenant liked the nagual Lujan immensely,\" he continued.\"They struck up such a close friendship that they were practically inseparable.I was told that the nagual Lujan and the tenant used to stroll into the churchover there every morning for early mass.\"\"Right here, in this town?\" I asked, in total surprise.\"Right here,\" he replied. \"Possibly they sat down on this very spot, on anotherbench, over a hundred years ago.\"\"The nagual Lujan and the tenant really walked in this plaza?\" I asked again,unable to overcome my surprise.\"You bet!\" he exclaimed. \"I brought you here tonight because the poem you werereading to me cued me that it was time for you to meet the tenant.\"Panic overtook me with the speed of wildfire. I had to breathe through my mouthfor a moment.\"We have been discussing the strange accomplishments of the sorcerers of ancienttimes,\" don Juan continued. \"But it's always hard when one has to talkexclusively in idealities without any firsthand knowledge. I can repeat to youfrom now until doomsday something that is crystal clear to me but impossible foryou to understand or believe because you don't have any practical knowledge ofit.\"He stood up and gazed at me from head to toe.\"Let's go to church,\" he said. \"The tenant likes the church and itssurroundings. I'm positive this is the moment to go there.\"Very few times in the course of my association with don Juan had I felt suchapprehension. I was numb. My entire body trembled when I stood up. My stomachwas tied in knots, yet I followed him without a word when he headed for thechurch- my knees wobbling and sagging involuntarily every time I took a step. Bythe time we had walked the short block from the plaza to the limestone steps ofthe church portico, I was about to faint. Don Juan put his arm around myshoulders to prop me up.\"There's the tenant,\" he said as casually as if he had just spotted an oldfriend.I looked in the direction he was pointing and saw a group of five women andthree men at the far end of the portico. My fast and panicked glance did notregister anything unusual about those people. I couldn't even tell whether theywere going into the church or coming out of it. I noticed, though, that theyseemed to be congregated there accidentally. They were not together. By the timedon Juan and I reached the small door cut out in the church's massive woodenportals, three women had entered the church. The three men and the other twowomen were walking away. I experienced a moment of confusion and looked at donJuan for directions. He pointed with a movement of his chin to the holy waterfont.\"We must observe the rules and cross ourselves,\" he whispered.\"Where's the tenant?\" I asked, also in a whisper. Don Juan dipped the tips ofhis fingers in the basin, and made the sign of the cross. With an imperativegesture of the chin, he urged me to do the same.\"Was the tenant one of the three men who left?\" I whispered nearly in his ear.\"No,\" he whispered back. \"The tenant is one of the three women who stayed. Theone in the back row.\"At that moment, a woman in the back row turned her head toward me, smiled, andnodded at me.I reached the door in one jump and ran out.Don Juan ran after me. With incredible agility, he overtook me and held me bythe arm.\"Where are you going?\" he asked, his face and body contorting with laughter.He held me firmly by the arm as I took big gulps of air. I was veritablychoking. Peals of laughter came out of him, like ocean waves. I forcefullypulled away and walked toward the plaza. He followed me.\"I never imagined you were going to get so upset,\" he said, as new waves oflaughter shook his body.\"Why didn't you tell me that the tenant is a woman?\"\"That sorcerer in there is the death defier,\" he said solemnly. \"For such asorcerer so versed in the shifts of the assemblage point, to be a man or a womanis a matter of choice or convenience. This is the first part of the lesson indreaming I said you were going to get. And the death defier is the mysteriousvisitor who's going to guide you through it.\"He held his sides as laughter made him cough. I was speechless. Then a suddenfury possessed me. I was not mad at don Juan or myself or anyone in particular.It was a cold fury which made me feel as if my chest and all my neck muscleswere going to explode.\"Let's go back to the church,\" I shouted, and I didn't recognize my own voice.\"Now, now,\" he said softly. \"You don't have to jump into the fire just likethat. Think. Deliberate. Measure things up. Cool that mind of yours. Never inyour life have you been put to such a test. You need calmness now.\"I can't tell you what to do,\" he continued. \"I can only, like any other nagual,put you in front of your challenge, after telling you, in quite oblique terms,everything that is pertinent. This is another of the nagual's maneuvers: to sayeverything without saying it, or to ask without asking.\"I wanted to get it over with quickly. But don Juan said that a moment's pausewould restore whatever was left of my self-assurance. My knees were about togive in. Solicitously, don Juan made me sit down on the curb. He sat next to me.\"The first part of the dreaming lesson in question is that maleness andfemaleness are not final states but are the result of a specific act ofpositioning the assemblage point,\" he said. \"And this act is, naturally, amatter of volition and training. Since it was a subject close to the oldsorcerers' hearts, they are the only ones who can shed light on it.\"Perhaps because it was the only rational thing to do, I began to argue with donJuan. \"I can't accept or believe what you are saying,\" I said. I felt heatrising to my face.\"But you saw the woman,\" don Juan retorted. \"Do you think that all of this is atrick?\"\"I don't know what to think.\"\"That being in the church is a real woman,\" he said forcefully. \"Why should thatbe so disturbing to you? The fact that she was born a man attests only to thepower of the old sorcerers' machinations. This shouldn't surprise you. You havealready embodied all the principles of sorcery.\"My insides were about to burst with tension. In an accusing tone, don Juan saidthat I was just being argumentative. With forced patience but real pomposity, Iexplained to him the biological foundation of maleness and femaleness.\"I understand all that,\" he said. \"And you're right in what you're saying. Yourflaw is to try to make your assessments universal.\"\"What we're talking about are basic principles,\" I shouted. \"They'll bepertinent to man here or in any other place in the universe.\"\"True. True,\" he said in a quiet voice. \"Everything you say is true as long asour assemblage point remains on its habitual position. But the moment it isdisplaced beyond certain boundaries and our daily world is no longer infunction, none of the principles you cherish has the total value you're talkingabout.\"Your mistake is to forget that the death defier has transcended thoseboundaries thousands upon thousands of times. It doesn't take a genius torealize that the tenant is no longer bound by the same forces that bind younow.\"I told him that my quarrel, if it could be called a quarrel, was not with him,but with accepting the practical side of sorcery, which up to that moment hadbeen so farfetched that it had never posed a real problem to me. I reiteratedthat, as a dreamer, it was within my experience to attest that in dreaminganything is possible. I reminded him that he himself had sponsored andcultivated this conviction together with the ultimate necessity for soundness ofmind. What he was proposing as the tenant's case was not sane. It was a subjectonly for dreaming; certainly not for the daily world. I let him know that to meit was an abhorrent and untenable proposition.\"Why this violent reaction?\" he asked with a smile.His question caught me off guard. I felt embarrassed. \"I think it threatens meat the core,\" I admitted. And I meant it. To think that the woman in the churchwas a man was somehow nauseating to me.A thought played in my mind: perhaps the tenant is a transvestite. I queried donJuan, in earnest, about this possibility. He laughed so hard he seemed about toget ill.\"That's too mundane a possibility,\" he said. \"Maybe your old friends would dosuch a thing. Your new ones are more resourceful and less masturbatory. Irepeat. That being in the church is a woman. It is a she. And she has all theorgans and attributes of a female.\" He smiled maliciously \"You've always beenattracted to women, haven't you? It seems that this situation has been tailoredjust for you.\"His mirth was so intense and childlike that it was contagious. We both laughed.He, with total abandon. I, with total apprehension.I came to a decision then. I stood up and said out loud that I had no desire todeal with the tenant in any form or shape. My choice was to bypass all thisbusiness and go back to don Juan's house and then home.Don Juan said that my decision was perfectly all right with him, and we startedback to his house. My thoughts raced wildly. Am I doing the right thing? Am Irunning away out of fear? Of course, I immediately rationalized my decision asthe right and unavoidable one. After all, I assured myself, I was not interestedin acquisitions, and the tenant's gifts were like acquiring property. Then doubtand curiosity hit me. There were so many questions I could have asked the deathdefier.My heart began to pound so intensely I felt it beating against my stomach. Thepounding suddenly changed into the emissary's voice. It broke its promise not tointerfere and said that an incredible force was accelerating my heart beat inorder to drive me back to the church; to walk toward don Juan's house was towalk toward my death.I stopped walking and hurriedly confronted don Juan with the emissary's words.\"Is this true?\" I asked.\"I am afraid it is,\" he admitted sheepishly.\"Why didn't you tell me yourself, don Juan? Were you going to let me die becauseyou think I am a coward?\" I asked in a furious mood.\"You were not going to die just like that. Your energy body has endlessresources. And it had never occurred to me to think you're a coward. I respectyour decisions, and I don't give a damn about what motivates them.\"You are at the end of the road, just like me. So be a true nagual. Don't beashamed of what you are. If you were a coward, I think you would have died offright years ago. But if you're too afraid to meet the death defier, then dierather than face him. There is no shame in that.\"\"Let's go back to the church,\" I said, as calmly as I could.\"Now we're getting to the crux of the matter!\" don Juan exclaimed. \"But first,let's go back to the park and sit down on a bench and carefully consider youroptions. We can spare the time: Besides, it's too early for the business athand.\"We walked back to the park and immediately found an unoccupied bench and satdown.\"You have to understand that only you, yourself, can make the decision to meetor not to meet the tenant, or to accept or reject his gifts of power,\" don Juansaid. \"But your decision has to be voiced to the woman in the church, face toface and alone; otherwise it won't be valid.\"Don Juan said that the tenant's gifts were extraordinary but that the price forthem was tremendous. And that he himself did not approve of either, the gifts orthe price.\"Before you make your real decision,\" don Juan continued, \"you have to know allthe details of our transactions with that sorcerer.\"\"I'd rather not hear about this anymore, don Juan,\" I pleaded.\"It's your duty to know,\" he said. \"How else are you going to make up yourmind?\"\"Don't you think that the less I know about the tenant the better off I'll be?\"\"No. This is not a matter of hiding until the danger is over. This is the momentof truth. Everything you've done and experienced in the sorcerers' world haschanneled you to this spot. I didn't want to say it because I knew your energybody was going to tell you, but there is no way to get out of this appointment.Not even by dying. Do you understand?\" He shook me by the shoulders. \"Do youunderstand?\" he repeated.I understood so well that I asked him if it would be possible for him to make mechange levels of awareness in order to alleviate my fear and discomfort. Henearly made me jump with the explosion of his \"no\".\"You must face the death defier in coldness and with ultimate premeditation,\" hewent on. \"And you can't do this by proxy.\"Don Juan calmly began to repeat everything he had already told me about thedeath defier. As he talked, I realized that part of my confusion was the resultof his use of words. He rendered 'death defier' in Spanish as el desafiante dela muerte, and 'tenant' as el inquilino, both of which automatically denote amale. But in describing the relationship between the tenant and the naguals ofhis line, don Juan kept on mixing the Spanish-language male and female genderdenotation, creating a great confusion in me.He said that the tenant was supposed to pay for the energy he took from thenaguals of our lineage, but that whatever he paid has bound those sorcerers forgenerations. As payment for the energy taken from all those naguals, the womanin the church taught them exactly what to do to displace their assemblage pointto some specific positions, which she herself had chosen. In other words, shebound every one of those men with a gift of power consisting of a preselected,specific position of the assemblage point and all its implications.\"\"What do you mean by 'all its implications', don Juan?\"\"I mean the negative results of those gifts. The woman in the church knows onlyof indulging. There is no frugality, no temperance in that woman. For instance,she taught the nagual Julian how to arrange his assemblage point to be, justlike her, a woman. Teaching this to my benefactor, who was an incurablevoluptuary, was like giving booze to a drunkard.\"\"But isn't it up to each one of us to be responsible for what we do?\"\"Yes, indeed. However, some of us have more difficulty than others in beingresponsible. To augment that difficulty deliberately, as that woman does, is toput too much unnecessary pressure on us.\"\"How do you know the woman in the church does this deliberately?\"\"She has done it to every one of the naguals of my line. If we look at ourselvesfairly and squarely, we have to admit that the death defier has made us, withhis gifts, into a line of very indulging, dependent sorcerers.\"I could not overlook his inconsistency of language usage any longer, and Icomplained to him.\"You have to speak about that sorcerer as either a male or a female, but not asboth,\" I said harshly. \"I'm too stiff, and your arbitrary use of gender makes meall the more uneasy.\"\"I am very uneasy myself,\" he confessed. \"But the truth is that the death defieris both: male and female. I've never been able to take that sorcerer's changewith grace. I was sure you would feel the same way, having seen him as a manfirst.\"Don Juan reminded me of a time, years before, when he took me to meet the deathdefier and I met a man, a strange Indian who was not old but not young eitherand was very slightly built. I remember mostly his strange accent and his use ofone odd metaphor when describing things he allegedly had seen. He said, mis ojosse pasearon, \"my eyes walked on\". For instance, he said, \"My eyes walked on thehelmets of the Spanish conquerors.\"The event was so fleeting in my mind that I had always thought the meeting hadlasted only a few minutes. Don Juan later told me that I had been gone with thedeath defier for a whole day.\"The reason I was trying to find out from you earlier whether you knew what wasgoing on,\" don Juan continued, \"was because I thought that years ago you hadmade an appointment with the death defier yourself.\"\"You were giving me undue credit, don Juan. In this instance, I really don'tknow whether I am coming or going. But what gave you the idea that I knew?\"\"The death defier seemed to have taken a liking to you. And that meant to methat he might have already given you a gift of power, although you didn'tremember it. Or he might have set up your appointment with him, as a woman. Ieven suspected she had given you precise directions.\"Don Juan remarked that the death defier, being definitely a creature of ritualhabits, always met the naguals of his line first as a man, as it had happenedwith the nagual Sebastian, and subsequently as a woman.\"Why do you call the death defier's gifts, gifts of power? And why the mystery?\"I asked. \"You yourself can displace your assemblage point to whatever spot youwant, isn't that so?\"\"They are called gifts of power because they are products of the specializedknowledge of the sorcerers of antiquity,\" he said. \"The mystery about the giftsis that no one on this earth, with the exception of the death defier, can giveus a sample of that knowledge. And, of course, I can displace my assemblagepoint to whatever spot I want, inside or outside man's energy shape. But what Ican't do, and only the death defier can, is to know what to do with my energybody in each one of those spots in order to get total perception, totalcohesion.\"He explained, then, that modern-day sorcerers do not know the details of thethousands upon thousands of possible positions of the assemblage point.\"What do you mean by details?\" I asked.\"Particular ways of treating the energy body in order to maintain the assemblagepoint fixed on specific positions,\" he replied.He took himself as an example. He said that the death defier's gift of power tohim had been the position of the assemblage point of a crow and the proceduresto manipulate his energy body to get the total perception of a crow. Don Juanexplained that total perception- total cohesion was what the old sorcererssought at any cost, and that, in the case of his own gift of power, totalperception came to him by means of a deliberate process he had to learn, step bystep, as one learns to work a very complex machine.Don Juan further explained that most of the shifts modern-day sorcerersexperience are mild shifts within a thin bundle of energetic luminous filamentsinside the luminous egg, a bundle called the band of man; or the purely humanaspect of the universe's energy. Beyond that band, but still within the luminousegg, lies the realm of the grand shifts; or movements. When the assemblage pointshifts to any spot on that area, perception is still comprehensible to us, butextremely detailed procedures are required for perception to be total.\"The inorganic beings tricked you and Carol Tiggs in your last journey byhelping you two to get total cohesion on a grand shift,\" don Juan said. \"Theydisplaced your assemblage points to the farthest possible spot, then helped youperceive there as if you were in your daily world: A nearly impossible thing. Todo that type of perceiving a sorcerer needs pragmatic knowledge, or influentialfriends.\"Your friends would have betrayed you in the end and left you and Carol to fendfor yourselves and learn pragmatic measures in order to survive in that world.You two would have ended filled to the brim with pragmatic procedures, just likethose most knowledgeable old sorcerers.\"Every grand shift has different inner workings,\" he continued, \"which modernsorcerers could learn if they knew how to fixate the assemblage point longenough at any grand shift. Only the sorcerers of ancient times had the specificknowledge required to do this.\"Don Juan went on to say that the knowledge of the specific procedures involvedin shifts was not available to the eight naguals who preceded the nagualSebastian, and that the tenant showed the nagual Sebastian how to achieve totalperception on ten new positions of the assemblage point. The nagual Santistebanreceived seven, the nagual Lujan fifty, the nagual Rosendo six, the nagual Eliasfour, the nagual Julian sixteen, and he was shown two: That made a total ofninety-five specific positions of the assemblage point that his lineage knewabout. He said that if I asked him whether he considered this an advantage tohis lineage, he would have to say no because the weight of those gifts put themcloser to the old sorcerers' mood.\"Now it's your turn to meet the tenant,\" he continued. \"Perhaps the gifts hewill give you will offset our total balance and our lineage will plunge into thedarkness that finished off the old sorcerers.\"\"This is so horribly serious, it's sickening,\" I said.\"I most sincerely sympathize with you,\" he retorted with a serious expression.\"I know it's no consolation to you if I say that this is the toughest trial of amodern nagual. To face something so old and mysterious as the tenant is notawe-inspiring but revolting. At least it was to me, and still is.\"\"Why do I have to continue with it, don Juan?\"\"Because, without knowing it, you accepted the death defier challenge. I drew anacceptance from you in the course of your apprenticeship, in the same manner myteacher drew one from me, surreptitiously. [* surreptitiously- in a mannermarked by quiet and caution and secrecy; taking pains to avoid being observed]\"I went through the same horror, only a little more brutally than you.\" He beganto chuckle. \"The nagual Julian was given to playing horrendous jokes. He told methat there was a very beautiful and passionate widow who was madly in love withme. The nagual used to take me to church often, and I had seen the woman staringat me. I thought she was a good-looking woman, and I was a horny young man. Whenthe nagual said that she liked me, I fell for it. My awakening was very rude.\"I had to fight not to laugh at don Juan's gesture of lost innocence. Then theidea of his predicament hit me, as being not funny but ghastly.\"Are you sure, don Juan, that that woman is the tenant?\" I asked, hoping thatperhaps it was a mistake or a bad joke.\"I am very, very sure,\" he said. \"Besides, even if I were so dumb as to forgetthe tenant, my seeing can't fail me.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that the tenant has a different type of energy?\"\"No, not a different type of energy, but certainly different energy featuresthan a normal person.\"\"Are you absolutely sure, don Juan, that that woman is the tenant?\" I insisted,driven by a strange revulsion and fear.\"That woman is the tenant!\" don Juan exclaimed in a voice that admitted nodoubts.We remained quiet. I waited for the next move in the midst of a panic beyonddescription.\"I have already said to you that to be a natural man or a natural woman is amatter of positioning the assemblage point,\" don Juan said. \"By natural I meansomeone who was born either male or female. To a seer, the shiniest part of theassemblage point faces outward, in the case of females; and inward, in the caseof males. The tenant's assemblage point was originally facing inward, but hechanged it by twisting it around and making his egglike energy shape look like ashell that has curled up on itself.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"12. The Woman in the ChurchDon Juan and I sat in silence. I had run out of questions, and he seemed to havesaid to me all that was pertinent. It could not have been more than seveno'clock, but the plaza was unusually deserted. It was a warm night. In theevenings, in that town, people usually meandered around the plaza until ten oreleven.I took a moment to reconsider what was happening to me. My time with don Juanwas coming to an end. He and his party were going to fulfill the sorcerers'dream of leaving this world and entering into inconceivable dimensions. On thisbasis of my limited success in dreaming, I believed that the claims were notillusory but extremely sober, although contrary to reason. They were seeking toperceive the unknown, and they had made it.Don Juan was right in saying that, by inducing a systematic displacement of theassemblage point, dreaming liberates perception; enlarging the scope of what canbe perceived. For the sorcerers of his party, dreaming had not only opened thedoors of other perceivable worlds, but prepared them for entering into thoserealms in full awareness. Dreaming for them had become ineffable; [* ineffable-defying expression or description] unprecedented; something whose nature andscope could only be alluded to, as when don Juan said that it is the gateway tothe light and to the darkness of the universe.There was only one thing pending for them: my encounter with the death defier. Iregretted that don Juan had not given me notice so that I could prepare myselfbetter. But he was a nagual who did everything of importance on the spur of themoment, without any warning.For a moment, I seemed to be doing fine, sitting with don Juan in that park,waiting for things to develop. But then my emotional stability suffered adownward swing and, in the twinkling of an eye, I was in the midst of a darkdespair. I was assailed by petty considerations about: my safety, my goals, myhopes in the world, my worries. Upon examination, however, I had to admit thatperhaps the only true worry I had was about my three cohorts in don Juan'sworld. Yet, if I thought it out, even that was no real worry to me. Don Juan hadtaught them to be the kind of sorceresses who always knew what to do, and, mostimportant, he had prepared them always to know what to do with what they knew.Having had all the possible worldly reasons for feeling anguish stripped off mea long time ago, all I had been left with was concern for myself. And I gavemyself to it shamelessly. One last indulging for the road; the fear of dying atthe hands of the death defier. I became so afraid that I got sick to my stomach.I tried to apologize, but don Juan laughed.\"You're not in any way unique at barfing out of fear,\" he said. \"When I met thedeath defier, I wet my pants. Believe me.\"I waited in silence for a long, unbearable moment.\"Are you ready?\" he asked. I said yes. And he added, standing up, \"Let's go thenand find out how you are going to stand up in the firing line.\"He led the way back to the church. To the best of my ability, all I remember ofthat walk, to this day, is that he had to drag me bodily the whole way. I do notremember arriving at the church or entering it. The next thing I knew, I waskneeling on a long, worn-out wooden pew next to the woman I had seen earlier.She was smiling at me. Desperately, I looked around, trying to spot don Juan,but he was nowhere in sight. I would have flown like a bat out of hell had thewoman not restrained me by grabbing my arm.\"Why should you be so afraid of poor little me?\" the woman asked me in English.I stayed glued to the spot where I was kneeling. What had taken me entirely andinstantaneously was her voice. I cannot describe what it was about its raspysound that called out the most recondite memories in me. It was as if I hadalways known that voice.I remained there immobile, mesmerized by that sound. She asked me something elsein English, but I could not make out what she was saying. She smiled at me,knowingly.\"It's all right,\" she whispered in Spanish. She was kneeling to my right. \"Iunderstand real fear. I live with it.\"I was about to talk to her when I heard the emissary's voice in my ear. \"That isthe voice of Hermelinda, your wet nurse,\" it said. The only thing I had everknown about Hermelinda was the story I was told of her being accidentally killedby a runaway truck. That the woman's voice next to me would stir such deep, oldmemories was shocking to me. I experienced a momentary agonizing anxiety.\"I am your wet nurse!\" the woman exclaimed softly. \"How extraordinary! Do youwant my breast?\" Laughter convulsed her body.I made a supreme effort to remain calm, yet I knew that I was quickly losingground and that in no time at all I was going to take leave of my senses.\"Don't mind my joking,\" the woman said in a low voice. \"The truth is that I likeyou very much. You are bustling with energy. And we are going to get alongfine.\"Two older men knelt down right in front of us. One of them turned curiously tolook at us. She paid no attention to him and kept on whispering in my ear.\"Let me hold your hand,\" she pleaded. But her plea was like a command. Isurrendered my hand to her, unable to say no.\"Thank you. Thank you for your confidence and your trust in me,\" she whispered.The sound of her voice was driving me mad. Its raspiness was so exotic, soutterly feminine. Not under any circumstances would I have taken it for a man'svoice laboring to sound womanly. It was a raspy voice, but not a throaty orharsh-sounding one. It was more like the sound of bare feet softly walking ongravel.I made a tremendous effort to break an invisible sheet of energy that seemed tohave enveloped me. I thought I succeeded. I stood up, ready to leave, and Iwould have had not the woman also stood up and whispered in my ear, \"Don't runaway. There is so much I have to tell you.\"I automatically sat down; stopped by curiosity. Strangely, my anxiety wassuddenly gone, and so was my fear. I even had enough presence to ask the woman,\"Are you really a woman?\"She chuckled softly, like a young girl. Then she voiced a convoluted sentence.\"If you dare to think that I would transform myself into a fearsome man andcause you harm, you are gravely mistaken,\" she said, accentuating even more thatstrange, mesmeric voice. \"You are my benefactor. I am your servant, as I havebeen the servant of all the naguals who preceded you.\"Gathering all the energy I could, I spoke my mind to her.\"You are welcome to my energy,\" I said. \"It's a gift from me to you, but I don'twant any gifts of power from you. And I really mean this.\"\"I can't take your energy for free,\" she whispered. \"I pay for what I get,that's the deal. It's foolish to give your energy for free.\"\"I've been a fool all my life. Believe me,\" I said. \"I can surely afford to makeyou a gift. I have no problem with it. You need the energy, take it. But I don'tneed to be saddled with unnecessaries. I have nothing and I love it.\"\"Perhaps,\" she said pensively.Aggressively, I asked her whether she meant that 'perhaps' she would take myenergy, or that she did not believe I had nothing and loved it.She giggled with delight and said that she might take my energy since I was sogenerously offering it, but that she had to make a payment. She had to give me athing of similar value.As I heard her speak, I became aware that she spoke Spanish with a mostextravagant foreign accent. She added an extra phoneme to the middle syllable ofevery word. Never in my life had I heard anyone speak like that.\"Your accent is quite extraordinary,\" I said. \"Where is it from?\"\"From nearly eternity,\" she said and sighed. We had begun to connect. Iunderstood why she sighed. She was the closest thing to permanent, while I wastemporary. That was my advantage. The death defier had worked herself into acorner, and I was free.I examined her closely. She seemed to be between thirty-five and forty yearsold. She was a dark, thoroughly Indian woman, almost husky, but not fat or evenhefty. I could see that the skin of her forearms and hands was smooth, themuscles, firm and youthful. I judged that she was five feet, six or seven inchestall. She wore a long dress, a black shawl, and guaraches. In her kneelingposition, I could also see her smooth heels and part of her powerful calves. Hermidsection was lean. She had big breasts that she could not or perhaps did notwant to hide under her shawl. Her hair was jet black and tied in a long braid.She was not beautiful, but she was not homely either. Her features were in noway outstanding. I felt that she could not possibly have attracted anybody'sattention; except for her eyes, which she kept low, hidden beneath downcasteyelids. Her eyes were magnificent, clear, peaceful. Apart from don Juan's, Ihad never seen eyes more brilliant, more alive.Her eyes put me completely at ease. Eyes like that could not be malevolent. Ihad a surge of trust and optimism and the feeling that I had known her all mylife. But I was also very conscious of something else; my emotional instability.It had always plagued me in don Juan's world, forcing me to be like a yo-yo. Ihad moments of total trust and insight only to be followed by abject doubts anddistrust. This event was not going to be different. My suspicious mind suddenlycame up with the warning thought that I was falling under the woman's spell.\"You learned Spanish late in life, didn't you?\" I said, just to get out fromunder my thoughts and to avoid her reading them.\"Only yesterday,\" she retorted and broke into a crystalline laughter, her small,strangely white teeth, shining like a row of pearls.People turned to look at us. I lowered my forehead as if in deep prayer. Thewoman moved closer to me.\"Is there a place where we could talk?\" I asked.\"We are talking here,\" she said. \"I have talked here with all the naguals ofyour line. If you whisper, no one will know we are talking.\"I was dying to ask her about her age. But a sobering memory came to my rescue. Iremembered a friend of mine who for years had been setting up all kinds of trapsto make me confess my age to him. I detested his petty concern, and now I wasabout to engage in the same behavior. I dropped it instantly.I wanted to tell her about it, just to keep the conversation going. She seemedto know what was going through my mind. She squeezed my arm in a friendlygesture, as if to say that we had shared a thought.\"Instead of giving me a gift, can you tell me something that would help me in myway?\" I asked her.She shook her head. \"No,\" she whispered. \"We are extremely different. Moredifferent than I believed possible.\"She got up and slid sideways out of the pew. She deftly genuflected as she facedthe main altar. She crossed herself and signaled me to follow her to a largeside altar to our left.We knelt in front of a life-size crucifix. Before I had time to say anything,she spoke.\"I've been alive for a very, very long time,\" she said. \"The reason I have hadthis long life is that I control the shifts and movements of my assemblagepoint. Also, I don't stay here in your world too long. I have to save the energyI get from the naguals of your line.\"\"What is it like to exist in other worlds?\" I asked.\"It's like in your dreaming, except that I have more mobility. And I can staylonger anywhere I want. Just like if you would stay as long as you wanted in anyof your dreams.\"\"When you are in this world, are you pinned down to this area alone?\"\"No. I go everywhere I want.\"\"Do you always go as a woman?\"\"I've been a woman longer than a man. Definitely, I like it much better. I thinkI've nearly forgotten how to be a man. I am all female!\"She took my hand and made me touch her crotch. My heart was pounding in mythroat. She was indeed a female.\"I can't just take your energy,\" she said, changing the subject. \"We have tostrike another kind of agreement.\"Another wave of mundane reasoning hit me then. I wanted to ask her where shelived when she was in this world. I did not need to voice my question to get ananswer.\"You're much, much younger than I,\" she said, \"and you already have difficultytelling people where you live. And even if you take them to the house you own orpay rent on, that's not where you live.\"\"There are so many things I want to ask you, but all I do is think stupidthoughts,\" I said.\"You don't need to ask me anything,\" she went on. \"You already know what I know.All you needed was a jolt in order to claim what you already know. I am givingyou that jolt.\"Not only did I think stupid thoughts but I was in a state of such suggestibilitythat no sooner had she finished saying that I knew what she knew than I felt Iknew everything, and I no longer needed to ask any more questions. Laughingly, Itold her about my gullibility.\"You're not gullible,\" she assured me with authority. \"You know everything,because you're now totally in the second attention. Look around!\"For a moment, I could not focus my sight. It was exactly as if water had gotteninto my eyes. When I arranged my view, I knew that something portentous hadhappened. The church was different, darker, more ominous, and somehow harder. Istood up and took a couple of steps toward the nave. [* nave- the central areaof a church] What caught my eye were the pews: They were made not out of lumberbut out of thin, twisted poles. These were homemade pews, set inside amagnificent stone building. Also, the light in the church was different. It wasyellowish, and its dim glow cast the blackest shadows I had ever seen. It camefrom the candles of the many altars. I had an insight about how well candlelightmixed with the massive stone walls and ornaments of a colonial church.The woman was staring at me. The brightness of her eyes was most remarkable. Iknew then that I was dreaming and she was directing the dream. But I was notafraid of her or of the dream. I moved away from the side altar and looked againat the nave of the church. There were people kneeling in prayer there.Lots of them, strangely small, dark, hard people. I could see their bowed headsall the way to the foot of the main altar. The ones who were close to me staredat me, obviously, in disapproval. I was gaping at them and at everything else. Icould not hear any noise, though. People moved, but there was no sound.\"I can't hear anything,\" I said to the woman, and my voice boomed, echoing as ifthe church were a hollow shell.Nearly all the heads turned to look at me. The woman pulled me back into thedarkness of the side altar.\"You will hear if you don't listen with your ears,\" she said. \"Listen with yourdreaming attention.\"It appeared that all I needed was her insinuation. I was suddenly flooded by thedroning sound of a multitude in prayer. I was instantly swept up by it. I foundit the most exquisite sound I had ever heard. I wanted to rave about it to thewoman, but she was not by my side. I looked for her. She had nearly reached thedoor. She turned there to signal me to follow her. I caught up with her at theportico. [* portico- a porch or entrance to a building consisting of a coveredand often columned area] The streetlights were gone. The only illumination wasmoonlight. The facade of the church was also different; it was unfinished.Square blocks of limestone lay everywhere. There were no houses or buildingsaround the church. In the moonlight the scene was eerie.\"Where are we going?\" I asked her.\"Nowhere,\" she replied. \"We simply came out here to have more space, moreprivacy. Here we can talk our little heads off.\"She urged me to sit down on a quarried, half-chiseled piece of limestone.\"The second attention has endless treasures to be discovered,\" she began. \"Theinitial position in which the dreamer places his body is of key importance. Andright there is the secret of the ancient sorcerers, who were already ancient inmy time. Think about it.\"She sat so close to me that I felt the heat of her body. She put an arm aroundmy shoulder and pressed me against her bosom. Her body had a most peculiarfragrance: It reminded me of trees or sage. It was not that she was wearingperfume: Her whole being seemed to exude that characteristic odor of pineforests. Also the heat of her body was not like mine or like that of anyone elseI knew. Hers was a cool, mentholated heat; even; balanced. The thought that cameto my mind was that her heat would press on relentlessly but knew no hurry.She began then to whisper in my left ear. She said that the gifts she had givento the naguals of my line had to do with what the old sorcerers used to call thetwin positions. That is to say, the initial position in which a dreamer holdshis physical body to begin dreaming is mirrored by the position in which heholds his energy body, in dreams, to fixate his assemblage point on any spot ofhis choosing. The two positions make a unit, she said, and it took the oldsorcerers thousands of years to find out the perfect relationship between anytwo positions. She commented, with a giggle, that the sorcerers of today willnever have the time or the disposition to do all that work, and that the men andwomen of my line were indeed lucky to have her to give them such gifts. Herlaughter had a most remarkable, crystalline sound.I had not quite understood her explanation of the twin positions. Boldly, I toldher that I did not want to practice those things but only know about them asintellectual possibilities.\"What exactly do you want to know?\" she asked softly.\"Explain to me what you mean by the twin positions, or the initial position inwhich a dreamer holds his body to start dreaming.\" I said.\"How do you lie down to start your dreaming?\" she asked.\"Any which way. I don't have a pattern. Don Juan never stressed this point.\"\"Well, I do stress it,\" she said and stood up. She changed positions. She satdown to my right and whispered in my other ear that, in accordance with what sheknew, the position in which one places the body is of utmost importance. Sheproposed a way of testing this by performing an extremely delicate but simpleexercise.\"Start your dreaming by lying on your right side, with your knees a bit bent,\"she said. \"The discipline is to maintain that position and fall asleep in it. Indreaming, then, the exercise is to dream that you lie down in exactly the sameposition and fall asleep again.\"\"What does that do?\" I asked.\"It makes the assemblage point stay put, and I mean really stay put, in whateverposition it is at the instant of that second falling asleep.\"\"What are the results of this exercise?\"\"Total perception. I am sure your teachers have already told you that my giftsare gifts of total perception.\"\"Yes. But I think I am not clear about what total perception means,\" I lied.She ignored me and went on to tell me that the four variations of the exercisewere to fall asleep lying on the right side, the left, the back, and thestomach. Then in dreaming the exercise was to dream of falling asleep a secondtime in the same position as the dreaming had been started. She promised meextraordinary results, which she said, were not possible to foretell.She abruptly changed the subject and asked me, \"What's the gift you want foryourself?\"\"No gift for me. I've told you that already.\"\"I insist. I must offer you a gift, and you must accept it. That is ouragreement.\"\"Our agreement is that we give you energy. So take it from me. This one is onme. My gift to you.\"The woman seemed dumbfounded. And I persisted in telling her it was all rightwith me that she took my energy. I even told her that I liked her immensely.Naturally, I meant it. There was something supremely sad, and at the same timesomething supremely appealing about her.\"Let's go back inside the church,\" she muttered.\"If you really want to make me a gift,\" I said, \"take me for a stroll in thistown, in the moonlight.\"She shook her head affirmatively. \"Provided that you don't say a word,\" shesaid.\"Why not?\" I asked, but I already knew the answer.\"Because we are dreaming,\" she said. \"I'll be taking you deeper into my dream.\"She explained that as long as we stayed in the church, I had enough energy tothink and converse, but that beyond the boundaries of that church it was adifferent situation.\"Why is that?\" I asked daringly.In a most serious tone, which not only increased her eeriness but terrified me,the woman said, \"Because there is no out there. This is a dream. You are at thefourth gate of dreaming, dreaming my dream.\"She told me that her art was to be capable of projecting her intent, and thateverything I saw around me was her intent. She said in a whisper that the churchand the town were the results of her intent: They did not exist, and yet theydid. She added, looking into my eyes, that this is one of the mysteries ofintending in the second attention the twin positions of dreaming. It can bedone, but it cannot be explained or comprehended.She told me then that she came from a line of sorcerers who knew how to moveabout in the second attention by projecting their intent. Her story was that thesorcerers of her line practiced the art of projecting their thoughts in dreamingin order to accomplish the truthful reproduction of any object or structure orlandmark or scenery of their choice.She said that the sorcerers of her line used to start by gazing at a simpleobject and memorizing every detail of it. They would then close their eyes andvisualize the object and correct their visualization against the true objectuntil they could see it, in its completeness, with their eyes shut. The nextthing in their developing scheme was to dream with the object and create in thedream, from the point of view of their own perception, a total materializationof the object. This act, the woman said, was called the first step to totalperception.From a simple object, those sorcerers went on to take more and more complexitems. Their final aim was for all of them together to visualize a total world,then dream that world; and thus re-create a totally veritable realm where theycould exist.\"When any of the sorcerers of my line were able to do that,\" the woman went on,\"they could easily pull anyone into their intent; into their dream. This is whatI am doing to you now, and what I did to all the naguals of your line.\"The woman giggled. \"You better believe it,\" she said, as if I did not.\"Whole populations disappeared in dreaming like that. This is the reason I saidto you that this church and this town are one of the mysteries of intending inthe second attention.\"\"You say that whole populations disappeared that way. How was it possible?\" Iasked.\"They visualized and then re-created in dreaming the same scenery,\" she replied.\"You've never visualized anything, so it's very dangerous for you to go into mydream.\"She warned me, then, that to cross the fourth gate and travel to places thatexist only in someone else's intent was perilous, since every item in such adream had to be an ultimately personal item.\"Do you still want to go?\" she asked.I said yes. Then she told me more about the twin positions. The essence of herexplanation was that if I were, for instance, dreaming of my hometown, and mydream had started when I lay down on my right side, I could very easily stay inthe town of my dream if I would lie on my right side in the dream, and dreamthat I had fallen asleep. The second dream not only would necessarily be a dreamof my hometown, but would be the most concrete dream one can imagine.She was confident that in my dreaming training I had gotten countless dreams ofgreat concreteness, but she assured me that every one of them had to be a fluke.For the only way to have absolute control of dreams was to use the technique ofthe twin positions.\"And don't ask me why,\" she added. \"It just happens. Like everything else.\"She made me stand up and admonished me again not to talk or stray from her. Shetook my hand gently, as if I were a child; and headed toward a clump of darksilhouettes of houses. We were on a cobbled street. Hard river rocks had beenpounded edgewise into the dirt. Uneven pressure had created uneven surfaces. Itseemed that the cobblers had followed the contours of the ground withoutbothering to level it.The houses were big, whitewashed, one-story, dusty buildings with tiled roofs.There were people meandering quietly. Dark shadows inside the houses gave me thefeeling of curious but frightened neighbors gossiping behind doors. I could alsosee the flat mountains around the town.Contrary to what had happened to me all along in my dreaming, my mentalprocesses were unimpaired. My thoughts were not pushed away by the force of theevents in the dream. My mental calculations told me I was in the dream versionof the town where don Juan lived, but at a different time. My curiosity was atits peak. I was actually with the death defier in her dream. But was it a dream?She herself had said it was a dream. I wanted to watch everything, to besuperalert. I wanted to test everything by seeing energy. I felt embarrassed,but the woman tightened her grip on my hand as if to signal me that she agreedwith me.Still feeling absurdly bashful, I automatically stated out loud my intent tosee. In my dreaming practices, I had been using all along the phrase \"I want tosee energy.\" Sometimes, I had to say it over and over until I got results. Thistime, in the woman's dream town, as I began to repeat it in my usual manner, thewoman began to laugh. Her laughter was like don Juan's: a deep, abandoned bellylaugh.\"What's so funny?\" I asked, somehow contaminated by her mirth.\"Juan Matus doesn't like the old sorcerers in general and me in particular,\" thewoman said between fits of laughter. \"All we have to do, in order to see in ourdreams, is to point with our little finger at the item we want to see. To makeyou yell in my dream is his way to send me his message. You have to admit thathe's really clever.\" She paused for a moment, then said in the tone of arevelation, \"Of course, to yell like an asshole works too.\"The sorcerers' sense of humor bewildered me beyond measure. She laughed so hardshe seemed to be unable to proceed with our walk. I felt stupid. When she calmeddown and was perfectly poised again, she politely told me that I could point atanything I wanted in her dream, including herself.I pointed at a house with the little finger of my left hand. There was no energyin that house. The house was like any other item of a regular dream. I pointedat everything around me with the same result.\"Point at me,\" she urged me. \"You must corroborate that this is the methoddreamers follow in order to see.\"She was thoroughly right. That was the method. The instant I pointed my fingerat her, she was a blob of energy. A very peculiar blob of energy, I may add. Herenergetic shape was exactly as don Juan had described it: It looked like anenormous seashell, curled inwardly along a cleavage that ran its length.\"I am the only energy-generating being in this dream,\" she said. \"So the properthing for you to do is just watch everything.\"At that moment I was struck, for the first time, by the immensity of don Juan'sjoke. He had actually contrived to have me learn to yell in my dreaming so thatI could yell in the privacy of the death defier's dream. I found that touch sofunny that laughter spilled out of me in suffocating waves.\"Let's continue our walk,\" the woman said softly when I had no more laughter inme.There were only two streets that intersected: Each had three blocks of houses.We walked the length of both streets, not once but four times. I looked ateverything and listened with my dreaming attention for any noises. There werevery few, only dogs barking in the distance, or people speaking in whispers aswe went by.The dogs barking brought me an unknown and profound longing. I had to stopwalking. I sought relief by leaning my shoulder against a wall. The contact withthe wall was shocking to me, not because the wall was unusual but because what Ihad leaned on was a solid wall, like any other wall I had ever touched. I feltit with my free hand. I ran my fingers on its rough surface. It was indeed awall!Its stunning realness put an immediate end to my longing and renewed my interestin watching everything. I was looking, specifically, for features that could becorrelated with the town of my day. However, no matter how intently I observed,I had no success. There was a plaza in that town, but it was in front of thechurch, facing the portico.In the moonlight the mountains around the town were clearly visible and almostrecognizable. I tried to orient myself, observing the moon and the stars, as ifI were in the consensual reality of everyday life. It was a waning moon, perhapsa day after full. It was high over the horizon. It must have been between eightand nine in the evening. I could see Orion to the right of the moon: Its twomain stars, Betelgeuse and Rigel, were on a horizontal straight line with themoon. I estimated it to be early December. My time was May. In May, Orion isnowhere in sight at that time. I gazed at the moon as long as I could. Nothingshifted. It was the moon as far as I could tell. The disparity in time got mevery excited.As I reexamined the southern horizon, I thought I could distinguish thebell-like peak visible from don Juan's patio. I tried next to figure out wherehis house might have been. For one instant I thought I found it. I became soenthralled that I pulled my hand out of the woman's grip. Instantly, atremendous anxiety possessed me. I knew that I had to go back to the church,because if I did not I would simply drop dead on the spot. I turned around andbolted for the church. The woman quickly grabbed my hand and followed me.As we approached the church at a running pace, I became aware that the town inthat dreaming was behind the church. Had I taken this into consideration,orientation might have been possible. As it was, I had no more dreamingattention. I focused all of it on the architectural and ornamental details onthe back of the church. I had never seen that part of the building in the worldof everyday life, and I thought that if I could record its features in mymemory, I could check them later against the details of the real church.That was the plan I concocted on the spur of the moment. Something inside me,however, scorned my efforts at validation. During all my apprenticeship, I hadbeen plagued by the need for objectivity, which had forced me to check andrecheck everything about don Juan's world. Yet it was not validation per se thatwas always at stake, but rather the need to use this drive for objectivity as acrutch to give me protection at the moments of most intense cognitivedisruption: When it was time to check what I had validated, I never went throughwith it.Inside the church, the woman and I knelt in front of the small altar on the leftside, where we had been, and the next instant, I woke up in the well-illuminatedchurch of my day.The woman crossed herself and stood up. I did the same automatically. She tookmy arm and began to walk toward the door.\"Wait, wait,\" I said and was surprised that I could talk. I could not thinkclearly, yet I wanted to ask her a convoluted question. What I wanted to knowwas how anyone could have the energy to visualize every detail of a whole town.Smiling, the woman answered my unvoiced question: She said that she was verygood at visualizing because after a lifetime of doing it, she had many, manylifetimes to perfect it. She added that the town I had visited and the churchwhere we had talked were examples of her recent visualizations. The church wasthe same church where Sebastian had been a sexton. She had given herself thetask of memorizing every detail of every corner of that church and that town,for that matter, out of a need to survive.She ended her talk with a most disturbing afterthought.\"Since you know quite a bit about this town, even though you've never tried tovisualize it,\" she said, \"you are now helping me to intend it. I bet you won'tbelieve me if I tell you that this town you are looking at now doesn't reallyexist, outside your intent and mine.\"She peered at me and laughed at my sense of horror, for I had just fullyrealized what she was saying.\"Are we still dreaming?\" I asked, astonished.\"We are,\" she said. \"But this dreaming is more real than the other, becauseyou're helping me. It is not possible to explain it beyond saying that it ishappening. Like everything else.\" She pointed all around her. \"There is no wayto tell how it happens, but it does. Remember always what I've told you: This isthe mystery of intending in the second attention.\"She gently pulled me closer to her. \"Let's stroll to the plaza of this dream,\"she said. \"But perhaps I should fix myself a little bit so you'll be more atease.\"I looked at her uncomprehendingly as she expertly changed her appearance. Shedid this with very simple, mundane maneuvers. She undid her long skirt,revealing the very average midcalf skirt she was wearing underneath. She thentwisted her long braid into a chignon and changed from her guaraches intoinch-heel shoes she had in a small cloth sack.She turned over her reversible black shawl to reveal a beige stole. She lookedlike a typical middle-class Mexican woman from the city, perhaps on a visit tothat town.She took my arm with a woman's aplomb [* aplomb- great coolness and composureunder strain] and led the way to the plaza.\"What happened to your tongue?\" she said in English. \"Did the cat eat it?\"I was totally engrossed in the unthinkable possibility that I was still in adream; what is more, I was beginning to believe that if it were true, I ran therisk of never waking up.In a nonchalant tone that I could not recognize as mine, I said, \"I didn'trealize until now that you spoke in English to me before. Where did you learnit?\"\"In the world out there. I speak many languages.\" She paused and scrutinized me.\"I've had plenty of time to learn them. Since we're going to spend a lot of timetogether, I'll teach you my own language sometime.\"She giggled, no doubt at my look of despair.I stopped walking. \"Are we going to spend a lot of time together?\" I asked,betraying my feelings.She replied in a joyful tone, \"Of course. You are- and I should say verygenerously- going to give me your energy, for free. You said that yourself,didn't you?\"I was aghast.\"What's the problem?\" the woman asked, shifting back into Spanish. \"Don't tellme that you regret your decision. We are sorcerers. It's too late to change yourmind. You are not afraid, are you?\"I was again more than terrified, but if I had been put on the spot to describewhat terrified me, I would not have known. I was certainly not afraid of beingwith the death defier in another dream, or of losing my mind, or even my life.Was I afraid of evil? I asked myself. But the thought of evil could notwithstand examination. As a result of all those years on the sorcerers' path, Iknew without the shadow of a doubt that in the universe only energy exists: Evilis merely a concatenation of the human mind, overwhelmed by the fixation of theassemblage point on its habitual position.Logically, there was really nothing for me to be afraid of. I knew that, but Ialso knew that my real weakness was to lack the fluidity to fix my assemblagepoint instantly on any new position to which it was displaced. The contact withthe death defier was displacing my assemblage point at a tremendous rate, and Idid not have the prowess to keep up with the push. The end result was a vaguepseudo-sensation of fearing that I might not be able to wake up.\"There is no problem,\" I said. \"Let's continue our dream walk.\"She linked her arm with mine, and we reached the park in silence. It was not atall a forced silence. But my mind was running in circles. How strange, Ithought: Only a while ago I had walked with don Juan from the park to the churchin the midst of the most terrifying normal fear. Now I was walking back from thechurch to the park with the object of my fear; and I was more terrified thanever, but in a different, more mature, more deadly manner.To fend off my worries, I began to look around. If this was a dream, as Ibelieved it was, there was a way to prove or disprove it. I pointed my finger atthe houses, at the church, at the pavement in the street. I pointed at people. Ipointed at everything. Daringly, I even grabbed a couple of people, whom Iseemed to scare considerably. I felt their mass. They were as real as anything Iconsider real, except that they did not generate energy. Nothing in that towngenerated energy. Everything seemed real and normal, yet it was a dream.I turned to the woman, who was holding on to my arm, and questioned her aboutit.\"We are dreaming,\" she said in her raspy voice and giggled.\"But how can people and things around us to be so real, so three-dimensional?\"\"The mystery of intending in the second attention!\" she exclaimed reverently.\"Those people out there are so real that they even have thoughts.\"That was the last stroke. I did not want to question anything else. I wanted toabandon myself to that dream. A considerable jolt on my arm brought me back tothe moment. We had reached the plaza. The woman had stopped walking and waspulling me to sit down on a bench. I knew I was in trouble when I did not feelthe bench underneath me as I sat down. I began to spin. I thought I wasascending. I caught a most fleeting glimpse of the park, as if I were looking atit from above.\"This is it!\" I yelled. I thought I was dying. The spinning ascension turnedinto a twirling descent into blackness. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"13. Flying on the Wings of Intent\"Make an effort, nagual,\" a woman's voice urged me. \"Don't sink. Surface,surface. Use your dream techniques!\"My mind began to work. I thought it was the voice of an English speaker, and Ialso thought that if I were to use dreaming techniques, I had to find a point ofdeparture to energize myself.\"Open your eyes,\" the voice said. \"Open them now. Use the first thing you see asa point of departure.\"I made a supreme effort and opened my eyes. I saw trees and blue sky. It wasdaytime! A blurry face was peering at me. But I could not focus my eyes. Ithought that it was the woman in the church looking at me.\"Use my face,\" the voice said. It was a familiar voice, but I could not identifyit. \"Make my face your home base; then look at everything,\" the voice went on.My ears were clearing up, and so were my eyes. I gazed at the woman's face, thenat the trees in the park, at the wrought-iron bench, at people walking by, andback again at her face.In spite of the fact that her face changed every time I gazed at her, I began toexperience a minimum of control. When I was more in possession of my faculties,I realized that a woman was sitting on the bench, holding my head on her lap.And she was not the woman in the church: She was Carol Tiggs.\"What are you doing here?\" I gasped.My fright and surprise were so intense that I wanted to jump up and run, but mybody was not ruled at all by my mental awareness. Anguishing moments followed inwhich I tried desperately but uselessly to get up. The world around me was tooclear for me to believe I was still dreaming, yet my impaired motor control mademe suspect that this was really a dream. Besides, Carol's presence was tooabrupt: There were no antecedents to justify it.Cautiously, I attempted to will myself to get up, as I had done hundreds oftimes in dreaming, but nothing happened. If I ever needed to be objective, thiswas the time. As carefully as I could, I began to look at everything within myfield of vision with one eye first. I repeated the process with the other eye. Itook the consistency between the images of my two eyes as an indication that Iwas in the consensual reality of everyday life.Next, I examined Carol. I noticed at that moment that I could move my arms. Itwas only my lower body that was veritably paralyzed. I touched Carol's face andhands: I embraced her. She was solid and, I believed, the real Carol Tiggs. Myrelief was enormous because for a moment, I had had the dark suspicion that shewas the death defier masquerading as Carol.With utmost care, Carol helped me to sit up on the bench. I had been sprawled onmy back, half on the bench and half on the ground. I noticed then somethingtotally out of the norm. I was wearing faded blue Levi's, and worn brown leatherboots. I also had on a Levi's jacket and a denim shirt.\"Wait a minute,\" I said to Carol. \"Look at me! Are these my clothes? Am Imyself?\"Carol laughed and shook me by the shoulders, the way she always did to denotecamaraderie; manliness; that she was one of the boys.\"I'm looking at your beautiful self,\" she said in her funny forced falsetto. \"Ohmassa, who else could it possibly be?\"\"How in the hell can I be wearing Levi's and boots?\" I insisted. \"I don't ownany.\"\"Those are my clothes you are wearing. I found you naked!\"\"Where? When?\"\"Around the church, about an hour ago. I came to the plaza here to look for you.The nagual sent me to see if I could find you. I brought the clothes, just incase.\"I told her that I felt terribly vulnerable and embarrassed to have wanderedaround without my clothes.\"Strangely enough, there was no one around,\" she assured me, but I felt she wassaying it just to ease my discomfort. Her playful smile told me so.\"I must have been with the death defier all last night, maybe even longer,\" Isaid. \"What day is it today?\"\"Don't worry about dates,\" she said, laughing. \"When you are more centered,you'll count the days yourself.\"\"Don't humor me, Carol Tiggs. What day is it today?\" My voice was a gruff,no-nonsense voice that did not seem to belong to me.\"It's the day after the big fiesta,\" she said and slapped me gently on myshoulder. \"We all have been looking for you since last night.\"\"But what am I doing here?\"\"I took you to the hotel across the plaza. I couldn't carry you all the way tothe nagual's house: You ran out of the room a few minutes ago, and we ended uphere.\"\"Why didn't you ask the nagual for help?\"\"Because this is an affair that concerns only you and me. We must solve ittogether.\"That shut me up. She made perfect sense to me. I asked her one more naggingquestion.\"What did I say when you found me?\"\"You said that you had been so deeply into the second attention and for such along time that you were not quite rational yet. All you wanted to do was to fallasleep.\"\"When did I lose my motor control?\"\"Only a moment ago. You'll get it back. You yourself know that it is quitenormal, when you enter into the second attention and receive a considerableenergy jolt, to lose control of your speech or of your limbs.\"\"And when did you lose your lisping, Carol?\" I caught her totally by surprise.She peered at me and broke into a hearty laugh.\"I've been working on it for a long time,\" she confessed. \"I think that it'sterribly annoying to hear a grown woman lisping. Besides, you hate it.\"Admitting that I detested her lisping was not difficult. Don Juan and I hadtried to cure her, but we had concluded she was not interested in getting cured.Her lisping made her extremely cute to everyone, and don Juan's feelings werethat she loved it and was not going to give it up. Hearing her speak withoutlisping was tremendously rewarding and exciting to me. It proved to me that shewas capable of radical changes on her own; a thing neither don Juan nor I wasever sure about.\"What else did the nagual say to you when he sent you to look for me?\" I asked.\"He said you were having a bout with the death defier.\"In a confidential tone, I revealed to Carol that the death defier was a woman.Nonchalantly, she said that she knew it.\"How can you know it?\" I shouted. \"No one has ever known this, apart from donJuan. Did he tell you that himself?\"\"Of course he did,\" she replied, unperturbed by my shouting. \"What you haveoverlooked is that I also met the woman in the church. I met her before you did.We amiably chatted in the church for quite a while.\"I believed Carol was telling me the truth. What she was describing was very muchwhat don Juan would do. He would in all likelihood send Carol as a scout inorder to draw conclusions.\"When did you see the death defier?\" I asked.\"A couple of weeks ago,\" she replied in a matter-of-fact tone. \"It was no greatevent for me. I had no energy to give her, or at least not the energy that womanwants.\"\"Why did you see her then? Is dealing with the nagual woman also part of thedeath defier's and sorcerers' agreement?\"\"I saw her because the nagual said that you and I are interchangeable, and forno other reason. Our energy bodies have merged many times. Don't you remember?\"The woman and I talked about the ease with which we merge. I stayed with hermaybe three or four hours, until the nagual came in and got me out.\"\"Did you stay in the church all that time?\" I asked, because I could hardlybelieve that they had knelt in there for three or four hours only talking aboutthe merging of our energy bodies.\"She took me into another facet of her intent,\" Carol conceded after a moment'sthought. \"She made me see how she actually escaped her captors.\"Carol related then a most intriguing story. She said that according to what thewoman in the church had made her see, every sorcerer of antiquity fell,inescapably, prey to the inorganic beings. The inorganic beings, after capturingthem, gave them power to be the intermediaries between our world and theirrealm, which people called the netherworld.The death defier was unavoidably caught in the nets of the inorganic beings.Carol estimated that he spent perhaps thousands of years as a captive, until themoment he was capable of transforming himself into a woman. He had clearly seenthis as his way out of that world the day he found out that the inorganic beingsregard the female principle as imperishable. They believe that the femaleprinciple has such a pliability and its scope is so vast that its members areimpervious to traps and setups and can hardly be held captive. The deathdefier's transformation was so complete and so detailed that she was instantlyspewed out of the inorganic beings' realm.\"Did she tell you that the inorganic beings are still after her?\" I asked.\"Naturally they are after her,\" Carol assured me. \"The woman told me she has tofend off her pursuers every moment of her life.\"\"What can they do to her?\"\"Realize she was a man and pull her back to captivity, I suppose. I think shefears them more than you can think it's possible to fear anything.\"Nonchalantly, Carol told me that the woman in the church was thoroughly aware ofmy run-in with the inorganic beings and that she also knew about the blue scout.\"She knows everything about you and me,\" Carol continued. \"And not because Itold her anything, but because she is part of our lives and our lineage. Shementioned that she had always followed all of us, you and me in particular.\"Carol related to me the instances that the woman knew in which Carol and I hadacted together. As she spoke, I began to experience a unique nostalgia for thevery person who was in front of me: Carol Tiggs. I wished desperately to embraceher. I reached out to her, but I lost my balance and fell off the bench.Carol helped me up from the pavement and anxiously examined my legs and thepupils of my eyes, my neck and my lower back. She said that I was stillsuffering from an energetic jolt.She propped my head on her bosom and caressed me as if I were a malingeringchild she was humoring.After a while I did feel better: I even began to regain my motor control.\"How do you like the clothes I am wearing?\" Carol asked me all of a sudden. \"AmI overdressed for the occasion? Do I look all right to you?\"Carol was always exquisitely dressed. If there was anything certain about her,it was her impeccable taste in clothes. In fact, as long as I had known her, ithad been a running joke between don Juan and the rest of us that her only virtuewas her expertise at buying beautiful clothes and wearing them with grace andstyle.I found her question very odd and made a comment.\"Why would you be insecure about your appearance? It has never bothered youbefore. Are you trying to impress someone?\"\"I'm trying to impress you, of course,\" she said.\"But this is not the time,\" I protested. \"What's going on with the death defieris the important matter, not your appearance.\"\"You'd be surprised how important my appearance is.\" She laughed. \"My appearanceis a matter of life or death for both of us.\"\"What are you talking about? You remind me of the nagual setting up my meetingwith the death defier. He nearly drove me nuts with his mysterious talk.\"\"Was his mysterious talk justified?\" Carol asked with a deadly seriousexpression.\"It most certainly was,\" I admitted.\"So is my appearance. Humor me. How do you find me? Appealing, unappealing,attractive, average, disgusting, overpowering, bossy?\"I thought for a moment and made my assessment. I found Carol very appealing.This was quite strange to me. I had never consciously thought about her appeal.\"I find you divinely beautiful,\" I said. \"In fact, you're downright stunning.\"\"Then this must be the right appearance.\" She sighed.I was trying to figure out her meanings, when she spoke again. She asked, \"Whatwas your time with the death defier like?\"I succinctly told her about my experience, mainly about the first dream. I saidthat I believed the death defier had made me see that town, but at another timein the past.\"But that's not possible,\" she blurted out. \"There is no past or future in theuniverse. There is only the moment.\"\"I know that it was the past,\" I said. \"It was the same church, but a differenttown.\"\"Think for a moment,\" she insisted. \"In the universe there is only energy, andenergy has only a here and now, an endless and ever-present here and now.\"\"So what do you think happened to me, Carol?\"\"With the death defier's help, you crossed the fourth gate of dreaming,\" shesaid. \"The woman in the church took you into her dream, into her intent. Shetook you into her visualization of this town. Obviously, she visualized it inthe past, and that visualization is still intact in her- as her presentvisualization of this town must be there too.\"After a long silence she asked me another question.\"What else did the woman do with you?\"I told Carol about the second dream. The dream of the town as it stands today.\"There you are,\" she said. \"Not only did the woman take you into her past intentbut she further helped you cross the fourth gate by making your energy bodyjourney to another place that exists today, only in her intent.\"Carol paused and asked me whether the woman in the church had explained to mewhat intending in the second attention meant.I did remember her mentioning but not really explaining what it meant to intendin the second attention. Carol was dealing with concepts don Juan had neverspoken about.\"Where did you get all these novel ideas?\" I asked, truly marveling at how lucidshe was.In a noncommittal tone, Carol assured me that the woman in the church hadexplained to her a great deal about those intricacies.\"We are intending in the second attention now,\" she continued. \"The woman in thechurch made us fall asleep; you here, and I in Tucson. And then we fell asleepagain in our dream. But you don't remember that part, while I do. The secret ofthe twin positions. Remember what the woman told you; the second dream isintending in the second attention: the only way to cross the fourth gate ofdreaming.\"After a long pause, during which I could not articulate one word, she said, \"Ithink the woman in the church really made you a gift, although you didn't wantto receive one. Her gift was to add her energy to ours in order to move backwardand forward on the here-and-now energy of the universe.\"I got extremely excited. Carol's words were precise, apropos. She had definedfor me something I considered undefinable, although I did not know what it wasthat she had defined. If I could have moved, I would have leapt to hug her. Shesmiled beatifically as I kept on ranting nervously about the sense her wordsmade to me. I commented rhetorically that don Juan had never told me anythingsimilar.\"Maybe he doesn't know,\" Carol said, not offensively but conciliatorily.I did not argue with her. I remained quiet for a while, strangely void ofthoughts. Then my thoughts and words erupted out of me like a volcano. Peoplewent around the plaza, staring at us every so often or stopping in front of usto watch us. And we must have been a sight; Carol Tiggs kissing and caressing myface while I ranted on and on about her lucidity and my encounter with the deathdefier.When I was able to walk, she guided me across the plaza to the only hotel intown. She assured me that I did not yet have the energy to go to don Juan'shouse, but that everybody there knew our whereabouts.\"How would they know our whereabouts?\" I asked.\"The nagual is a very crafty old sorcerer,\" she replied, laughing. \"He's the onewho told me that if I found you energetically mangled, I should put you in thehotel rather than risk crossing the town with you in tow.\"Her words and especially her smile made me feel so relieved that I kept onwalking in a state of bliss. We went around the corner to the hotel's entrance,half a block down the street, right in front of the church. We went through thebleak lobby, up the cement stairway to the second floor, directly to anunfriendly room I had never seen before. Carol said that I had been there:However, I had no recollection of the hotel or the room. I was so tired, though,that I could not think about it. I just sank into the bed, face down. All Iwanted to do was sleep, yet I was too keyed up. There were too many loose ends,although everything seemed so orderly. I had a sudden surge of nervousexcitation and sat up.\"I never told you that I hadn't accepted the death defier's gift,\" I said,facing Carol. \"How did you know I didn't?\"\"Oh, but you told me that yourself,\" she protested as she sat down next to me.\"You were so proud of it. That was the first thing you blurted out when I foundyou.\"This was the only answer, so far, that did not quite satisfy me. What she wasreporting did not sound like my statement.\"I think you read me wrong,\" I said. \"I just didn't want to get anything thatwould deviate me from my goal.\"\"Do you mean you didn't feel proud of refusing?\"\"No. I didn't feel anything. I am no longer capable of feeling anything, exceptfear.\"I stretched my legs and put my head on the pillow. I felt that if I closed myeyes or did not keep on talking I would be asleep in an instant. I told Carolhow I had argued with don Juan at the beginning of my association with him abouthis confessed motive for staying on the warrior's path. He had said that fearkept him going in a straight line, and that what he feared the most was to losethe nagual; the abstract; the spirit.\"Compared with losing the nagual, death is nothing,\" he had said with a note oftrue passion in his voice. \"My fear of losing the nagual is the only real thingI have; because without it, I would be worse than dead.\"I said to Carol that I had immediately contradicted don Juan and bragged thatsince I was impervious to fear, if I had to stay within the confines of onepath, the moving force for me had to be love.Don Juan had retorted that when the real pull comes, fear is the only worthwhilecondition for a warrior. I secretly resented him for what I thought was hiscovert narrow-mindedness.\"The wheel has done a full turn,\" I said to Carol, \"and look at me now. I canswear to you that the only thing that keeps me going is the fear of losing thenagual.\"Carol stared at me with a strange look I had never seen in her.\"I dare to disagree,\" she said softly. \"Fear is nothing compared with affection.Fear makes you run wildly: Love makes you move intelligently.\"\"What are you saying, Carol Tiggs? Are sorcerers people in love now?\"She did not answer. She lay next to me and put her head on my shoulder. Westayed there in that strange unfriendly room for a long time; in total silence.\"I feel what you feel,\" Carol said abruptly. \"Now, try to feel what I feel. Youcan do it. But let's do it in the dark.\"Carol stretched her arm up and turned off the light above the bed. I sat upstraight in one single motion. A jolt of fright had gone through me likeelectricity. As soon as Carol had turned off the light, it was nighttime insidethat room. In the middle of great agitation, I asked Carol about it.\"You're not all together yet,\" she said reassuringly. \"You had a bout ofmonumental proportions. Going so deeply into the second attention has left you alittle mangled, so to speak. Of course, it's daytime, but your eyes can't yetadjust properly to the dim light inside this room.\"More or less convinced, I lay down again. Carol kept on talking, but I was notlistening. I felt the sheets. They were real sheets. I ran my hands on the bed.It was a bed! I leaned over and ran the palms of my hands on the cold tiles ofthe floor. I got out of bed and checked every item in the room and in thebathroom. Everything was perfectly normal, perfectly real. I told Carol thatwhen she turned off the light, I had the clear sensation I was dreaming.\"Give yourself a break,\" she said. \"Cut this investigatory nonsense, and come tobed and rest.\"I opened the curtains of the window to the street. It was day-time outside, butthe moment I closed them it was nighttime inside. Carol begged me to come backto bed. She feared that I might run away and end up in the street, as I had donebefore. She made sense. I went back to bed without noticing that not even for asecond had it entered my mind to point at things. It was as if that knowledgehad been erased from my memory.The darkness in that hotel room was most extraordinary. It brought me adelicious sense of peace and harmony. It brought me also a profound sadness; alonging for human warmth; for companionship. I felt more than bewildered. Neverhad anything like this happened to me. I lay in bed, trying to remember if thatlonging was something I knew. It was not. The longings I knew were not for humancompanionship: They were abstract: They were rather a sort of sadness for notreaching something undefined.\"I am coming apart,\" I said to Carol. \"I am about to weep for people.\"I thought she would understand my statement as being funny. I intended it as ajoke. But she did not say anything: She seemed to agree with me. She sighed.Being in an unstable state of mind, I became instantly swayed towardemotionality. I faced her in the darkness and muttered something that in a morelucid moment would have been quite irrational to me.\"I absolutely adore you,\" I said.Talk like that among the sorcerers of don Juan's line was unthinkable. CarolTiggs was the nagual woman. Between the two of us, there was no need fordemonstrations of affection. In fact, we did not even know what we felt for eachother. We had been taught by don Juan that among sorcerers there was no need ortime for such feelings.Carol smiled at me and embraced me. And I was filled with such a consumingaffection for her that I began to weep involuntarily.\"Your energy body is moving forward on the universe's luminous filaments ofenergy,\" she whispered in my ear. \"We are being carried by the death defier'sgift of intent.\"I had enough energy to understand what she was saying. I even questioned herabout whether she, herself, understood what it all meant. She hushed me andwhispered in my ear.\"I do understand: The death defier's gift to you was the wings of intent. Andwith them, you and I are dreaming ourselves in another time. In a time yet tocome.\"I pushed her away and sat up. The way Carol was voicing those complex sorcerers'thoughts was unsettling to me. She was not given to take conceptual thinkingseriously. We had always joked among ourselves that she did not have aphilosopher's mind.\"What's the matter with you?\" I asked. \"Yours is a new development for me: Carolthe sorceress philosopher. You are talking like don Juan.\"\"Not yet.\" She laughed. \"But it's coming. It's rolling, and when it finally hitsme, it'll be the easiest thing in the world for me to be a sorceressphilosopher. You'll see. And no one will be able to explain it because it willjust happen.\"An alarm bell rang in my mind.\"You're not Carol!\" I shouted. \"You're the death defier masquerading as Carol. Iknew it.\"Carol laughed, undisturbed by my accusation.\"Don't be absurd,\" she said. \"You're going to miss the lesson. I knew that,sooner or later, you were going to give in to your indulging. Believe me, I amCarol. But we're doing something we've never done: We are intending in thesecond attention as the sorcerers of antiquity used to do.\"I was not convinced, but I had no more energy to pursue my argument becausesomething like the great vortexes of my dreaming was beginning to pull me in. Iheard Carol's voice faintly, saying in my ear, \"We are dreaming ourselves. Dreamyour intent of me. Intend me forward! Intend me forward!\"With great effort, I voiced my innermost thought. \"Stay here with me forever,\" Isaid with the slowness of a tape recorder on the blink. She responded withsomething incomprehensible. I wanted to laugh at my voice, but then the vortexswallowed me. When I woke up, I was alone in the hotel room. I had no idea how long I hadslept. I felt extremely disappointed at not finding Carol by my side. Ihurriedly dressed and went down to the lobby to look for her. Besides, I wantedto shake off some strange sleepiness that had clung to me.At the desk, the manager told me that the American woman who had rented the roomhad just left a moment ago. I ran out to the street, hoping to catch her, butthere was no sign of her. It was midday: The sun was shining in a cloudless sky.It was a bit warm.I walked to the church. My surprise was genuine but dull at finding out that Ihad indeed seen the detail of its architectural structure in that dream.Uninterestedly, I played my own devil's advocate and gave myself the benefit ofthe doubt. Perhaps don Juan and I had examined the back of the church and I didnot remember it. I thought about it. It did not matter. My validation scheme hadno meaning for me anyway. I was too sleepy to care.From there I slowly walked to don Juan's house, still looking for Carol. I wassure I was going to find her there waiting for me. Don Juan received me as if Ihad come back from the dead.He and his companions were in the throes of agitation as they examined me withundisguised curiosity.\"Where have you been?\" don Juan demanded. I could not comprehend the reason forall the fuss. I told him that I had spent the night with Carol in the hotel bythe plaza because I had no energy to walk back from the church to their house,but that they already knew this.\"We knew nothing of the sort,\" he snapped.\"Didn't Carol tell you she was with me?\" I asked in the midst of a dullsuspicion, which, if I had not been so exhausted, would have been alarming.No one answered. They looked at one another, searchingly. I faced don Juan andtold him I was under the impression he had sent Carol to find me. Don Juan pacedthe room up and down without saying a word.\"Carol Tiggs hasn't been with us at all,\" he said. \"And you've been gone fornine days.\"My fatigue prevented me from being blasted by those statements. His tone ofvoice and the concern the others showed were ample proof that they were serious.But I was so numb that there was nothing for me to say.Don Juan asked me to tell them, in all possible detail, what had transpiredbetween the death defier and me. I was shocked at being able to remember somuch, and at being able to convey all of it in spite of my fatigue. A moment oflevity broke the tension when I told them how hard the woman had laughed at myinane yelling my intent to see in her dream.\"Pointing the little finger works better,\" I said to don Juan, but without anyfeeling of recrimination.Don Juan asked if the woman had any other reaction to my yelling besideslaughing. I had no memory of one, except her mirth and the fact that she hadcommented how intensely he disliked her.\"I don't dislike her,\" don Juan protested. \"I just don't like the old sorcerers'coerciveness.\"Addressing everybody, I said that I personally had liked that woman immenselyand unbiasedly. And that I had loved Carol Tiggs as I never thought I could loveanyone. They did not seem to appreciate what I was saying. They looked at oneanother as if I had suddenly gone crazy.I wanted to say more to explain myself. But don Juan, I believed just to stop mefrom babbling idiocies, practically dragged me out of the house and back to thehotel; accompanied by two of his companions.The same manager I had spoken to earlier obligingly listened to our descriptionof Carol Tiggs, but he flatly denied ever having seen her or me before. He evencalled the hotel maids: They corroborated his statements.\"What can the meaning of all this be?\" don Juan asked out loud. It seemed to bea question addressed to himself. He gently ushered me out of the hotel. \"Let'sget out of this confounded place,\" he said.When we were outside, he ordered me not to turn around to look at the hotel orat the church across the street, but to keep my head down. I looked at my shoesand instantly realized I was no longer wearing Carol's clothes but my own. Icould not remember, however, no matter how hard I tried, when I had changedclothes. I figured that it must have been when I woke up in the hotel room. Imust have put on my own clothes then, although my memory was blank.By then we had reached the plaza. Before we crossed it to head off to don Juan'shouse, I explained to him about my clothes. He shook his head rhythmically,listening to every word. Then he sat down on a bench, and, in a voice thatconveyed genuine concern, he warned me that, at the moment, I had no way ofknowing what had transpired in the second attention between the woman in thechurch and my energy body. My interaction with the Carol Tiggs of the hotel hadbeen just the tip of the iceberg.\"It's horrendous to think that you were in the second attention for nine days,\"don Juan went on. \"Nine days is just a second for the death defier, but aneternity for us.\"Before I could protest or explain or say anything, he stopped me with a comment.\"Consider this,\" he said. \"If you still can't remember all the things I taughtyou and did with you in the second attention, imagine how much more difficult itmust be to remember what the death defier taught you and did with you. I onlymade you change levels of awareness; the death defier made you changeuniverses.\"I felt meek and defeated. Don Juan and his two companions urged me to make atitanic effort and try to remember when I changed my clothes. I could not. Therewas nothing in my mind: no feelings, no memories. Somehow, I was not totallythere with them.The nervous agitation of don Juan and his two companions reached a peak. Neverhad I seen him so discombobulated. There had always been a touch of fun, of notquite taking himself seriously in everything he did or said to me. Not thistime, though.Again, I tried to think, bring forth some memory that would shed light on allthis; and again I failed, but I did not feel defeated; an improbable surge ofoptimism overtook me. I felt that everything was coming along as it should.Don Juan's expressed concern was that he knew nothing about the dreaming I haddone with the woman in the church. To create a dream hotel, a dream town, adream Carol Tiggs was to him only a sample of the old sorcerers' dreamingprowess; the total scope of which defied human imagination.Don Juan opened his arms expansively and finally smiled with his usual delight.\"We can only deduce that the woman in the church showed you how to do it,\" hesaid in a slow, deliberate tone. \"It's going to be a giant task for you to makecomprehensible an incomprehensible maneuver. It has been a masterful movement onthe chessboard, performed by the death defier as the woman in the church. Shehas used Carol's energy body and yours to lift off, to break away from hermoorings. She took you up on your offer of free energy.\"What he was saying had no meaning to me: Apparently, it meant a great deal tohis two companions. They became immensely agitated. Addressing them, don Juanexplained that the death defier and the woman in the church were differentexpressions of the same energy; the woman in the church was the more powerfuland complex of the two. Upon taking control, she made use of Carol Tiggs'senergy body, in some obscure, ominous fashion congruous with the old sorcerers'machinations, and created the Carol Tiggs of the hotel, a Carol Tiggs of sheerintent. Don Juan added that Carol and the woman may have arrived at some sort ofenergetic agreement during their meeting.At that instant, a thought seemed to find its way to don Juan. He stared at histwo companions, unbelievingly. Their eyes darted around, going from one to theother. I was sure they were not merely looking for agreement, for they seemed tohave realized something in unison.\"All our speculations are useless,\" don Juan said in a quiet, even tone. \"Ibelieve there is no longer any Carol Tiggs. There isn't any woman in the churcheither: Both have merged and flown away on the wings of intent, I believe,forward.\"The reason the Carol Tiggs of the hotel was so worried about her appearance wasbecause she was the woman in the church, making you dream a Carol Tiggs ofanother kind; an infinitely more powerful Carol Tiggs. Don't you remember whatshe said? \"Dream your intent of me. Intend me forward.\"\"What does this mean, don Juan?\" I asked stunned.\"It means that the death defier has seen her total way out. She has caught aride with you. Your fate is her fate.\"\"Meaning what, don Juan?\"\"Meaning that if you reach freedom so will she.\"\"How is she going to do that?\"\"Through Carol Tiggs. But don't worry about Carol.\" He said this before I voicedmy apprehension. \"She's capable of that maneuver and much more.\"Immensities were piling up on me. I already felt their crushing weight. I had amoment of lucidity and asked don Juan, \"What is going to be the outcome of allthis?\"He did not answer. He gazed at me, scanning me from head to toe. Then he slowlyand deliberately said, \"The death defier's gift consists of endless dreamingpossibilities. One of them was your dream of Carol Tiggs in another time, inanother world; a more vast world; open-ended; a world where the impossible mighteven be feasible. The implication was not only that you will live thosepossibilities but that one day you will comprehend them.\"He stood up, and we started to walk in silence toward his house. My thoughtsbegan to race wildly. They were not thoughts, actually, but images; a mixture ofmemories of the woman in the church and of Carol Tiggs talking to me in thedarkness in the dream hotel room. A couple of times I was near to condensingthose images into a feeling of my usual self, but I had to give it up: I had noenergy for such a task.Before we arrived at the house, don Juan stopped walking and faced me. He againscrutinized me carefully, as if he were looking for signs in my body. I thenfelt obliged to set him straight on a subject I believed he was deadly wrongabout.\"I was with the real Carol Tiggs at the hotel,\" I said. \"For a moment, I myselfbelieved she was the death defier, but after careful evaluation, I can't hold onto that belief. She was Carol. In some obscure, awesome way she was at thehotel, as I was there at the hotel myself.\"\"Of course she was Carol,\" don Juan agreed. \"But not the Carol you and I know.This one was a dream Carol, I've told you, a Carol made out of pure intent. Youhelped the woman in the church spin that dream. Her art was to make that dreaman all-inclusive reality; the art of the old sorcerers; the most frighteningthing there is. I told you that you were going to get the crowning lesson indreaming, didn't I?\"\"What do you think happened to Carol Tiggs?\" I asked.\"Carol Tiggs is gone,\" he replied. \"But someday you will find the new CarolTiggs, the one in the dream hotel room.\"\"What do you mean she's gone?\"\"She's gone from the world,\" he said.I felt a surge of nervousness cut through my solar plexus. I was awakening. Theawareness of myself had started to become familiar to me, but I was not yetfully in control of it. It had begun, though, to break through the fog of thedream: It had begun as a mixture of not knowing what was going on and theforeboding sensation that the incommensurable was just around the corner.I must have had an expression of disbelief because don Juan added in a forcefultone, \"This is dreaming. You should know by now that its transactions are final.Carol Tiggs is gone.\"\"But where do you think she went, don Juan?\"\"Wherever the sorcerers of antiquity went. I told you that the death defier'sgift was endless dreaming possibilities. You didn't want anything concrete, sothe woman in the church gave you an abstract gift: the possibility of flying onthe wings of intent.\" ### \"The Art of Dreaming\" - Copyright 1993 by Carlos Castaneda ###"}]
