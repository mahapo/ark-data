I was interested at that time in studying the usesof medicinal plants among the Indians of the Southwest and northern Mexico.My research evolved into something else over the years as a consequence of itsown momentum and of my own growth. The study of medicinal plants was supersededby the study of a belief system which seemed to cut across the boundaries of atleast two different cultures.The person responsible for this shift of emphasis in my work was a Yaqui Indianfrom northern Mexico, don Juan Matus, who later introduced me to don GenaroFlores, a Mazatec Indian from central Mexico. Both of them were practitioners ofan ancient knowledge, which in our time is commonly known as sorcery, and whichis thought to be a primitive form of medical or psychological science, but whichin fact is a tradition of extremely self-disciplined practitioners and extremelysophisticated praxis. [* praxis- translating an idea into action]The two men became my teachers rather than my informants, but I still persisted,in a haphazard way, in regarding my task as a work in anthropology. I spentyears trying to figure out the cultural matrix of that system, perfecting ataxonomy, a classificatory scheme, a hypothesis of its origin and dissemination.All were futile efforts in view of the fact that in the end, the compellinginner forces of that system derailed my intellectual pursuit and turned me intoa participant.Under the influence of these two powerful men my work has been transformed intoan autobiography, in the sense that I have been forced from the moment I becamea participant to report what happens to me. It is a peculiar autobiographybecause I am not reporting about what happens to me in my everyday life as anaverage man, nor am I reporting about my subjective states generated by dailyliving. I am reporting, rather, on the events that unfold in my life as a directresult of having adopted an alien set of interrelated ideas and procedures. Inother words, the belief system I wanted to study swallowed me, and in order forme to proceed with my scrutiny I have to make an extraordinary daily payment; mylife as a man in this world.Due to these circumstances I am now faced with the special problem of having toexplain what it is that I am doing. I am very far away from my point of originas an average Western man or as an anthropologist, and I must first of allreiterate that this is not a work of fiction. What I am describing is alien tous, therefore, it seems unreal.As I enter deeper into the intricacies of sorcery, what at first appeared to bea system of primitive beliefs and practices has now turned out to be an enormousand intricate world. In order to become familiar with that world and to reportabout it, I have to use myself in increasingly complex and more refined ways.Whatever happens to me is no longer something I can predict, nor anythingcongruous with what other anthropologists know about the belief systems of theIndians of Mexico. I find myself, consequently, in a difficult position. All Ican do under the circumstances is present what happened to me as it happened. Icannot give any other assurance of my good faith, except to reassert that I donot live a dual life, and that I have committed myself to following theprinciples of don Juan's system in my everyday existence.After don Juan Matus and don Genaro Flores, the two Mexican Indian sorcerers whotutored me, had explained their knowledge to me to their own satisfaction, theysaid goodbye and left. I understood that from then on my task was to assemble bymyself what I had learned from them.In the course of fulfilling this task I went back to Mexico and found out thatdon Juan and don Genaro had nine other apprentices of sorcery; five women andfour men. The oldest woman was named Soledad; the next was Maria Elena,nicknamed \"la Gorda,\" the other three women, Lydia, Rosa, and Josefina, wereyounger, and were called \"the little sisters.\" The four men, in order of age,were Eligio, Benigno, Nestor, and Pablito: The latter three men were called \"theGenaros\" because they were very close to don Genaro.I had already known that Nestor, Pablito, and Eligio, who was no longer around,were apprentices, but I had been led to believe that the four girls werePablito's sisters, and that Soledad was their mother. I knew Soledad slightlyover the years, and had always called her dona Soledad as a sign of respectsince she was closer to don Juan in age. Lydia and Rosa had also been introducedto me but our relationship had been too brief and casual to afford me anunderstanding of who they really were. I knew la Gorda and Josefina only byname. I had met Benigno but had no idea that he was connected to don Juan anddon Genaro.For reasons that were incomprehensible to me, all of them seemed to have beenwaiting in one way or another for my return to Mexico. They informed me that Iwas supposed to take the place of don Juan as their leader, their Nagual. Theytold me that don Juan and don Genaro had disappeared from the face of the earth,and so had Eligio. The women and the men believed that the three of them had notdied: They had entered another world, different from the world of our everydaylife, yet equally real.The women- especially dona Soledad- clashed violently with me from our firstmeeting. They were, nevertheless, instrumental in producing a catharsis [*catharsis- purging of emotional tensions] in me. My contact with them resultedin a mysterious effervescence in my life. From the moment I met them, drasticchanges took place in my thinking and my understanding. All this did not happen,however, on a conscious level. If anything, after my first visit to them, Ifound myself more confused than ever. Yet in the midst of the chaos, Iencountered a surprisingly solid base. In the impact of our clash, I found inmyself resources I had not imagined I possessed.La Gorda and the three little sisters were consummate [* consummate- having orrevealing supreme mastery or skill] dreamers. They voluntarily gave me pointers,and showed me their accomplishments. Don Juan had described the art of dreamingas the capacity to utilize one's ordinary dreams and transform them intocontrolled awareness by virtue of a specialized form of attention which he anddon Genaro called the second attention.I expected that the three Genaros were going to teach me their accomplishmentsin another aspect of don Juan's and don Genaro's teachings, 'the art ofstalking'. The art of stalking was introduced to me as a set of procedures andattitudes that enabled one to get the best out of any conceivable situation. Butwhatever the three Genaros told me about stalking did not have the cohesion orthe force I had anticipated. I concluded that either the men were not reallypractitioners of that art, or they simply did not want to show it to me.I stopped my inquiries in order to give everyone a chance to feel relaxed withme, but all of the men and women sat back and trusted that since I was no longerasking questions I was finally behaving like a Nagual. Each of them demanded myguidance and counsel.In order to comply I was obliged to undertake a total review of everything donJuan and don Genaro had taught me; to go deeper still into the art of sorcery. ================================================================= Part one: The Other Self"},{"pageContent":"1. The Fixation of the Second Attention It was midafternoon when I got to where la Gorda and the little sisters lived.La Gorda was alone, sitting outside by the door, gazing into the distantmountains. She was shocked to see me. She explained that she had been completelyabsorbed in a memory, and for a moment she had been on the verge of rememberingsomething very vague that had to do with me.Later that night, after dinner, la Gorda, the three little sisters, the threeGenaros, and I sat on the floor of la Gorda's room. The women sat together.For some reason, although I had been with each one of them an equal length oftime, I had isolated la Gorda as the recipient of all my concern. It was as ifthe others did not exist for me. I speculated that perhaps it was because laGorda reminded me of don Juan while the others did not. There was something veryeasy about her. Yet that easiness was not so much in her actions as it was in myfeelings for her.They wanted to know what I had been doing. I told them that I had just been inthe city of Tula, Hidalgo, where I had visited some archaeological ruins. I hadbeen most impressed with a row of four colossal, columnlike figures of stone,called the Atlanteans,\" which stand on the flat top of a pyramid.Each one of the almost cylindrical figures, measuring fifteen feet in height andthree feet across, is made of four separate pieces of basalt carved to representwhat archaeologists think are Toltec warriors carrying their war paraphernalia.Twenty feet behind each of the front figures on the top of the pyramid, there isanother row of four rectangular columns of the same height and width as thefirst, also made of four separate pieces of stone.The awe-inspiring setting of the Atlanteans was enhanced by what a friend, whohad guided me through the site, had told me about them. He said that a custodianof the ruins had revealed to him that he had heard the Atlanteans walking atnight; making the ground underneath them shake.I asked the Genaros for comments on what my friend had said. They acted shy andgiggled. I turned to la Gorda who was sitting beside me, and asked her directlyfor her opinions.\"I've never seen those figures,\" she said. \"I've never been in Tula. Just theidea of going to that town scares me.\"\"Why does it scare you, Gorda?\" I asked.\"Something happened to me in the ruins of Monte Alban in Oaxaca,\" she said. \"Iused to go to roam around those ruins even after the Nagual Juan Matus told menot to set foot in them. I don't know why but I loved that place. Every time Iwas in Oaxaca I would go there. Because women alone are always harassed, I wouldusually go with Pablito, who is very daring. But once I went there with Nestor.He saw a glitter on the ground. We dug a little and found a strange rock thatfit in the palm of my hand. A hole had been neatly drilled into the rock. Iwanted to put my finger through it, but Nestor stopped me. The rock was smoothand made my hand very hot. We didn't know what to do with it. Nestor put itinside his hat and we carried it as if it were a live animal.\"All of them started to laugh. There seemed to be a concealed joke in what laGorda was telling me.\"Where did you take it?\" I asked her.\"We brought it here to this house,\" she replied, and that statement eliciteduncontainable laughter from the others. They coughed and choked laughing,\"The joke is on la Gorda,\" Nestor said. \"You've got to understand that she'smuleheaded like no one else. The Nagual had already told her not to fool aroundwith rocks, or bones, or any other thing she might find buried in the ground.But she used to sneak behind his back and get all kinds of crap.\"That day in Oaxaca she insisted on carrying that god-awful thing. We got on thebus with it and brought it all the way to this town, and then right into thisroom.\"\"The Nagual and Genaro had gone on a trip,\" la Gorda said. \"I got daring and putmy finger through the hole and realized that the rock had been cut to be held inthe hand. Right away I could feel the feeling of whoever had held that rock. Itwas a power rock. My mood changed. I became frightened. Something awesome beganto lurk in the dark; something that had no shape or color. I couldn't be alone.I would wake up screaming and after a couple of days I couldn't sleep any more.Everybody took turns keeping me company, day and night.\"\"When the Nagual and Genaro came back,\" Nestor said, \"the Nagual sent me withGenaro to put the rock back in the exact place where it had been buried. Genaroworked for three days to pinpoint the spot. And he did it.\"\"What happened to you, Gorda, after that?\" I asked her.\"The Nagual buried me,\" she said. \"For nine days I was naked inside a dirtcoffin.\"There was another explosion of laughter among them.\"The Nagual told her that she couldn't get out of it,\" Nestor explained. \"PoorGorda had to piss and shit inside her coffin. The Nagual pushed her inside a boxthat he made with branches and mud. There was a little door on the side for herfood and water. The rest of it was sealed.\"\"Why did he bury her?\" I asked.\"That's the only way to protect anyone,\" Nestor said. \"She had to be placedunder the ground so the earth would heal her. There is no better healer than theearth. Besides, the Nagual had to fend off the feeling of that rock which wasfocused on la Gorda. The dirt is a screen. It doesn't allow anything to gothrough either way. The Nagual knew that she couldn't get worse by being buriedfor nine days. She could only get better. Which she did.\"\"How did it feel to be buried like that, Gorda?\" I asked.\"I nearly went crazy,\" she said. \"But that was just my indulging. If the Nagualhadn't put me in there, I would have died. The power of that rock was too greatfor me. Its owner had been a very large man. I could tell that his hand wastwice the size of mine. He held on to that rock for dear life, and in the endsomeone killed him. His fear terrified me. I could feel something coming at meto eat my flesh. That was what the man felt. He was a man of power, but someoneeven more powerful got him.\"The Nagual said that once you have an object of that kind it brings disasterbecause its power enters into challenges with other objects of its kind; and theowner becomes either a pursuer or a victim. The Nagual said that it is thenature of such objects to be at war because the part of our attention whichfocuses on them to give them power is a very dangerous, belligerent part.\"\"La Gorda is very greedy,\" Pablito said. \"She figured that if she could findsomething which already had a great deal of power in it, she'd be a winnerbecause nowadays no one is interested in challenging power.\"La Gorda assented with a movement of her head.\"I didn't know that one could pick up other things besides the power that theobjects have,\" she said. \"When I first put my finger through the hole and heldthe rock, my hand got hot and my arm began to vibrate. I felt truly strong andbig. I'm sneaky so no one knew that I was holding the rock in my hand. After afew days of holding it the real horror began. I could feel that somebody hadgone after the owner of the rock. I could feel his fright. He was doubtlessly avery powerful sorcerer and whoever was after him wanted not only to kill him butto eat his flesh. That really scared me. I should've dropped the rock then, butthe feeling I was having was so new that I kept the rock clutched in my handlike a damn fool. When I finally dropped it, it was too late. Something in mewas hooked. I had visions of men coming at me; men dressed in strange clothes. Ifelt they were biting me; tearing the flesh of my legs with sharp little knivesand with their teeth. I went berserk!\"\"How did don Juan explain those visions?\" I asked her.\"He said that she no longer had defenses,\" Nestor said. \"And because of that shecould pick up that man's fixation; his second attention which had been pouredinto that rock. When he was being killed he held on to the rock in order togather all his concentration. The Nagual said that the man's power went out ofhis body into his rock. He knew what he was doing. He didn't want his enemies tobenefit by devouring his flesh. The Nagual also said that the ones who killedhim knew this. That's why they were eating him alive; to get whatever power wasleft. They must have buried the rock to avoid trouble. And la Gorda and I, liketwo idiots, found it and dug it up.\"La Gorda shook her head affirmatively three or four times. She had a veryserious expression.\"The Nagual told me that the second attention is the most fierce thing thereis,\" she said. \"If it is focused on objects, there is nothing more horrendous.\"\"What's horrible is that we cling,\" Nestor said. \"The man who owned the rock wasclinging to his life and to his power; that's why he was horrified at feelinghis flesh eaten away. The Nagual said that if the man would've let go of hispossessiveness and abandoned himself to his death, whatever it may have been,there wouldn't have been any fear in him.\"The conversation faded. I asked the others if they had anything to say. Thelittle sisters glared at me. Benigno giggled and hid his face with his hat.\"Pablito and I have been in the pyramids of Tula,\" he finally said. \"We've beenin all the pyramids there are in Mexico. We like them.\"\"Why did you go to all the pyramids?\" I asked him.\"I really don't know why we went to them,\" he said. \"Perhaps it was because theNagual Juan Mat us told us not to.\"\"How about you, Pablito?\" I asked.\"I went there to learn,\" he replied huffily, and laughed. \"I used to live in thecity of Tula. I know those pyramids like the back of my hand. The Nagual told methat he also used to live there. He knew everything about the pyramids. He was aToltec himself.\"I realized then that it had been more than curiosity that made me go to thearchaeological site in Tula. The main reason I had accepted my friend'sinvitation was because at the time of my first visit to la Gorda, and theothers, they had told me something which don Juan had never even mentioned tome; that he considered himself a cultural descendant of the Toltecs. Tula hadbeen the ancient epicenter of the Toltec empire.\"What do you think about the Atlanteans walking around at night?\" I askedPablito.\"Sure, they walk at night,\" he said. \"Those things have been there for ages. Noone knows who built the pyramids. The Nagual Juan Matus himself told me that theSpaniards were not the first to discover them. The Nagual said there were othersbefore them. God knows how many.\"\"What do you think those four figures of stone represent?\" I asked.\"They are not men, but women,\" he said. \"That pyramid is the center of order andstability. Those figures are its four corners. They are the four winds, the fourdirections. They are the foundation, the basis of the pyramid. They have to bewomen, mannish women, if you want to call them that. As you yourself know, wemen are not that hot. We are a good binding, a glue to hold things together, butthat's all. The Nagual Juan Matus said that the mystery of the pyramid is itsstructure. The four corners have been elevated to the top. The pyramid itself isthe man supported by his female warriors; a male who has elevated his supportersto the highest place. See what I mean?\"I must have had a look of perplexity on my face. Pablito laughed. It was apolite laughter.\"No. I don't see what you mean, Pablito,\" I said. \"But that's because don Juannever told me anything about it. The topic is completely new to me. Please tellme everything you know.\"\"The Atlanteans are the nagual. They are dreamers. They represent the order ofthe second attention brought forward. That's why they're so fearsome andmysterious. They are creatures of war but not of destruction.\"The other row of columns, the rectangular ones, represent the order of thefirst attention; the tonal. They are stalkers. That's why they are covered withinscriptions. They are very peaceful and wise; the opposite of the front row.\"Pablito stopped talking and looked at me almost defiantly, then he broke into asmile.I thought he was going to go on to explain what he had said, but he remainedsilent as if waiting for my comments.I told him how mystified I was and urged him to continue talking. He seemedundecided, stared at me for a moment, and took a deep breath. He had hardlybegun to speak when the voices of the rest of them were raised in a clamor ofprotest.\"The Nagual already explained that to all of us,\" la Gorda said impatiently.\"What's the point of making him repeat it?\"I tried to make them understand that I really had no conception of what Pablitowas talking about. I prevailed on him go on with his explanation. There wasanother wave of voices speaking at the same time. Judging by the way the littlesisters glared at me, they were getting very angry; especially Lydia.\"We don't like to talk about those women,\" la Gorda said to me in a conciliatorytone. \"Just the thought of the women of the pyramid makes us very nervous.\"\"What's the matter with you people?\" I asked. \"Why are you acting like this?\"\"We don't know,\" la Gorda replied. \"It's just a feeling that all of us have; avery disturbing feeling. We were fine until a moment ago when you started to askquestions about those women.\"La Gorda's statements were like an alarm signal. All of them stood up andadvanced menacingly toward me, talking in loud voices.It took me a long time to calm them and make them sit down. The little sisterswere very upset and their mood seemed to influence la Gorda's. The three menshowed more restraint. I faced Nestor and asked him bluntly to explain to me whythe women were so agitated. Obviously I was unwittingly doing something toaggravate them.\"I really don't know what it is,\" Nestor said. \"I'm sure none of us here knowswhat is the matter with us, except that we all feel very sad and nervous.\"\"Is it because we're talking about the pyramids?\" I asked him.\"It must be,\" Nestor replied somberly. \"I myself didn't know that those figureswere women.\"\"Of course you did, you idiot,\" Lydia snapped.Nestor seemed to be intimidated by her outburst. He recoiled and smiledsheepishly at me.\"Maybe I did,\" he conceded. \"We're going through a very strange period in ourlives. None of us knows anything for sure any more. Since you came into ourlives, we are unknown to ourselves.\"A very oppressive mood set in. I insisted that the only way to dispel it was totalk about those mysterious columns on the pyramids.The women protested heatedly. The men remained silent. I had the feeling thatthe men were affiliated in principle with the women, but secretly wanted todiscuss the topic just as I did.\"Did don Juan tell you anything else about the pyramids, Pablito?\" I asked.My intention was to steer the conversation away from the specific topic of theAtlanteans, and yet stay near it.\"He said one specific pyramid there in Tula was a guide,\" Pablito repliedeagerly.From the tone of his voice I deduced that he really wanted to talk. And theattentiveness of the other apprentices convinced me that covertly all of themwanted to exchange opinions.\"The Nagual said that it was a guide to the second attention,\" Pablito went on,\"but that it was ransacked and everything destroyed. He told me that some of thepyramids were gigantic not-doings. They were not lodgings but places forwarriors to do their dreaming and exercise their second attention. Whatever theydid was recorded in drawings and figures that were put on the walls.\"Then another kind of warrior must've come along; a kind who didn't approve ofwhat the sorcerers of the pyramid had done with their second attention, anddestroyed the pyramid and all that was in it.\"The Nagual believed that the new warriors must've been warriors of the thirdattention, just as he himself was. Warriors who were appalled by the evilness ofthe fixation of the second attention. The sorcerers of the pyramids were toobusy with their fixation to realize what was going on. When they did, it was toolate.\"Pablito had an audience. Everyone in the room, myself included, was fascinatedwith what he was saying. I understood the ideas he was presenting because donJuan had explained them to me. Don Juan had said that our total being consists of two perceivable segments. Thefirst is the familiar physical body which all of us can perceive. The second isthe luminous body which is a cocoon that only seers can perceive; a cocoon thatgives us the appearance of giant luminous eggs.He had also said that one of the most important goals of sorcery is to reach theluminous cocoon; a goal which is fulfilled through the sophisticated use ofdreaming, and through a rigorous systematic exertion he called not-doing. Hedefined not-doing as an unfamiliar act which engages our total being by forcingus to become conscious of its luminous segment.In order to explain these concepts, don Juan made a threepart, uneven divisionof our consciousness.He called the smallest the first attention, and said that it is theconsciousness that every normal person has developed in order to deal with thedaily world. It encompasses the awareness of the physical body.Another larger portion he called the second attention, and described it as theawareness we need in order to perceive our luminous cocoon and to act asluminous beings. He said that the second attention remains in the background forthe duration of our lives unless it is brought forth through deliberate trainingor by an accidental trauma. He said the second attention encompasses theawareness of the luminous body.He called the last portion, which was the largest, the third attention-animmeasurable consciousness which engages undefinable aspects of the awareness ofthe physical and the luminous bodies.I asked him if he himself had experienced the third attention. He said that hewas on the periphery of it, and that if he ever entered it completely, I wouldknow it instantly because all of him would become what he really was; anoutburst of energy.He added that the battlefield of warriors was the second attention, which wassomething like a training ground for reaching the third attention. The secondattention was a state rather difficult to arrive at, but very fruitful once itwas attained. \"The pyramids are harmful,\" Pablito went on. \"Especially to unprotectedsorcerers like ourselves. They are worse yet to formless warriors like la Gorda.The Nagual said that there is nothing more dangerous than the evil fixation ofthe second attention.\"When warriors learn to focus on the weak side of the second attention nothingcan stand in their way. They become hunters of men; ghouls. Even if they are nolonger alive, they can reach for their prey through time as if they were presenthere and now.\"And because prey is what we become if we walk into one of those pyramids, theNagual called them traps of the second attention.\"\"What exactly did he say would happen?\" la Gorda asked.\"The Nagual said that we could stand perhaps one visit to the pyramids,\" Pablitoexplained. \"On the second visit we would feel a strange sadness. It would belike a cold breeze that would make us listless and fatigued; a fatigue that soonturns into bad luck. In no time at all we'll be jinxed. Everything will happento us. In fact, the Nagual said that our own streaks of bad luck were due to ourwillfulness in visiting those ruins against his recommendations.\"Eligio, for instance, never disobeyed the Nagual. You wouldn't catch him deadin there. Neither did this Nagual here, and they were always lucky while therest of us were jinxed, especially la Gorda and myself. Weren't we even bittenby the same dog? And didn't the same beams of the kitchen roof get rotten twiceand fall on us?\"\"The Nagual never explained this to me,\" la Gorda said.\"Of course he did,\" Pablito insisted,\"If I had known how bad it was, I wouldn't have set foot in those damnedplaces,\" la Gorda protested.\"The Nagual told every one of us the same things,\" Nestor said. \"The problem isthat every one of us was not listening attentively, or rather every one of uslistened to him in his own way, and heard what he wanted to hear.\"The Nagual said that the fixation of the second attention has two faces.\"The first and easier face is the evil one. It happens when dreamers use theirdreaming to focus their second attention on the items of the world, like moneyand power over people.[~ the world of the 1st attention]\"The other face is the more difficult to reach and it happens when dreamersfocus their second attention on items that are not in or from this world, suchas the journey into the unknown. [~ the world of the third attention]\"Warriors need endless impeccability in order to reach this face.\"I said to them that I was sure that don Juan had selectively revealed certainthings to some of us, and other things to others. I could not, for instance,recall don Juan ever discussing the evil face of the second attention with me.I told them then what don Juan said to me in reference to the fixation ofattention in general. He stressed to me that all archaeological ruins in Mexico, especially thepyramids, were harmful to modern man. He depicted the pyramids as foreignexpressions of thought and action. He said that every item, every design inthem, was a calculated effort to record aspects of attention which werethoroughly alien to us. For don Juan, it was not only ruins of past culturesthat held a dangerous element in them. Anything which was the object of anobsessive concern had a harmful potential.We had discussed this in detail once. It was a reaction he had to some commentsI had made about my being at a loss as to where to store my field notes safely.I regarded them in a most possessive manner and was obsessed with theirsecurity.\"What should I do?\" I asked him.\"Genaro once gave you the solution,\" he replied. \"You thought, as you always do,that he was joking. He never jokes. He told you that you should write with thetip of your finger instead of a pencil. You didn't take him up on that becauseyou can't imagine that this is the not-doing of taking notes.\"I argued that what he was proposing had to be a joke. My self image was that ofa social scientist who needed to 'record everything' that was said and done inorder to 'draw verifiable conclusions'. For don Juan, the one thing had nothingto do with the other: To be a serious student had nothing to do with takingnotes.I personally could not see a solution. Don Genaro's suggestion seemed to mehumorous; not a real possibility.Don Juan argued his point further. He said that taking notes was a way ofengaging the first attention in the task of remembering; that I took notes inorder to remember what was said and done. Don Genaro's recommendation was not ajoke because writing with the tip of my finger on a piece of paper, as thenot-doing of taking notes, would force my second attention to focus onremembering; and I would not accumulate sheets of paper. Don Juan thought thatthe end result would be more accurate and more powerful than taking notes. Ithad never been done as far as he knew, but the principle was sound.He pressed me to do it for a while. I became disturbed. Taking notes acted notonly as a mnemonic [* mnemonic- a device, such as a rhyme or acronym, used toaid recall] device, but soothed me as well. It was my most serviceable crutch.To accumulate sheets of paper gave me a sense of purpose and balance.\"When you worry about what to do with your sheets,\" don Juan explained, \"you arefocusing a very dangerous part of yourself on them. All of us have thatdangerous side, that fixation. The stronger we become, the more deadly that sideis.\"The recommendation for warriors is not to have any material things on which tofocus their power, but to focus their power on the spirit; on the true flightinto the unknown, not on trivial shields. In your case, your notes are yourshield. They won't let you live in peace.\"I seriously felt that I had no way on earth to disassociate myself from mynotes. Don Juan then conceived of a task for me in lieu of a not-doing proper.He said that for someone who was as possessive as I was, the most appropriateway of freeing myself from my notebooks would be to disclose them; to throw themin the open; to write a book. I thought, at the time, that that was a biggerjoke than taking notes with the tip of my finger.\"Your compulsion to possess and hold on to things is not unique,\" he said.\"Everyone who wants to follow the warrior's path, the sorcerer's way, has to ridhimself of this fixation.\"My benefactor told me that there was a time when warriors did have materialobjects on which they placed their obsession; and that gave rise to the questionof whose object would be more powerful, or the most powerful of them all.Remnants of those objects still remain in the world; the leftovers of that racefor power.\"No one can tell what kind of fixation those objects must have received. Meninfinitely more powerful than you poured all the facets of their attention onthem. You have merely begun to pour your puny worry on your notes. You haven'tgotten yet to other levels of attention.\"Think how horrible it would be if you would find yourself at the end of yourtrail as a warrior, still carrying your bundles of notes on your back. By thattime the notes will be alive, especially if you learn to write with yourfingertip and still have to pile up sheets. Under those conditions it wouldn'tsurprise me in the least if someone found your bundles walking around.\" \"It is easy for me to understand why the Nagual Juan Matus didn't want us tohave possessions,\" Nestor said after I had finished talking. \"We are alldreamers. He didn't want us to focus our dreaming body on the weak face of thesecond attention.\"I didn't understand his maneuvers at the time. I resented the fact that he mademe get rid of everything I had. I thought he was being unfair. My belief wasthat he was trying to keep Pablito and Benigno from envying me because they hadnothing themselves. I was well-off in comparison. At the time, I had no ideathat he was protecting my dreaming body.\" Don Juan had described dreaming to me in various ways. The most obscure of themall now appears to me as being the one that defines it best. He said thatdreaming is intrinsically the not-doing of sleep. And as such, dreaming affordspractitioners the use of that portion of their lives spent in slumber.It is as if the dreamers no longer sleep; yet no illness results from it. Thedreamers do not lack sleep, and the effect of dreaming seems to be an increaseof waking time owing to the use of an alleged extra body; the dreaming body.Don Juan had explained to me that the dreaming body is sometimes called the\"double\" or the \"other\" because it is a perfect replica of the dreamer's body.It is inherently the energy of a luminous being, a whitish, phantomlikeemanation which is projected by the fixation of the second attention into athree-dimensional image of the body.Don Juan explained that the dreaming body is not a ghost, and is as real asanything we deal with in the world. He said that the second attention isunavoidably drawn to focus on our total being as a field of energy, andtransforms that energy into anything suitable. The easiest thing is, of course,the image of the physical body with which we are already thoroughly familiarfrom our daily lives, and our use of our first attention.And that which channels the energy of our total being to produce anything thatmight be within the boundaries of possibility is known as 'will'. Don Juan couldnot say what those boundaries were; except that at the level of luminous beings,the range is so broad that it is futile to try to establish limits.Thus, the energy of a luminous being can be transformed through will intoanything. \"The Nagual said that the dreaming body gets involved and attaches itself toanything,\" Benigno said. \"It doesn't have sense. He told me that men are weakerthan women because a man's dreaming body is more possessive.\"The little sisters agreed in unison with a movement of their heads. La Gordalooked at me and smiled.\"The Nagual told me that you're the king of possessiveness,\" she said to me.\"Genaro said that you even say goodbye to your turds before you flush themdown.\"The little sisters rolled down on their sides laughing. The Genaros made obviousefforts to contain themselves. Nestor, who was sitting by my side, patted myknee.The Nagual and Genaro used to tell great stories about you,\" he said. \"Theyentertained us for years with tales about a weird guy they knew. We know nowthat it was you.\"I felt a wave of embarrassment. It was as if don Juan and don Genaro hadbetrayed me; laughing at me in front of the apprentices. Self-pity took over. Ibegan to complain. I said out loud that they had been predisposed to be againstme; to think that I was a fool.\"That's not true,\" Benigno said. \"We are delighted that you are with us.\"\"Are we?\" Lydia snapped.All of them became involved in a heated argument. The men and the women weredivided. La Gorda did not join either group. She stayed sitting by my side,while the others had stood up and were shouting.\"We're going through a difficult time,\" la Gorda said to me in a low voice.\"We've done a lot of dreaming and yet it isn't enough for what we need.\"\"What do you need, Gorda?\" I asked.\"We don't know,\" she said. \"We were hoping that you would tell us that.\"The little sisters and the Genaros sat down again in order to listen to what laGorda was saying to me.\"We need a leader,\" she went on. \"You are the Nagual, but you're not a leader.\"\"It takes time to make a perfect Nagual,\" Pablito said. \"The Nagual Juan Matustold me that he himself was crappy in his youth, until something shook him outof his complacency.\"\"I don't believe it,\" Lydia shouted. \"He never told me that.\"\"He said that he was very crummy,\" la Gorda added in a low voice.\"The Nagual told me that in his youth he was a jinx, just like me,\" Pablitosaid. \"He was also told by his benefactor not to set foot in those pyramids andbecause of that he practically lived there until he was driven away by a hordeof phantoms.\"Apparently no one else knew the story. They perked up.\"I had completely forgotten about that,\" Pablito explained. \"I've only justremembered it now. It was just like what happened to la Gorda. One day after theNagual had finally become a formless warrior, the evil fixations of thosewarriors who had done their dreaming and other not-doings in the pyramids cameafter him.\"They found him while he was working in the field. He told me that he saw a handcoming out of the loose dirt in a fresh furrow to grab the leg of his pants. Hethought that it was a fellow worker who had been accidentally buried. He triedto dig him out. Then he realized that he was digging into a dirt coffin: A manwas buried there. The Nagual said that the man was very thin and dark and had nohair.\"The Nagual tried frantically to patch up the dirt coffin. He didn't want hisfellow workers to see it and he didn't want to injure the man by digging him outagainst his will. He was working so hard that he didn't even notice that theother workers had gathered around him. By then the Nagual said that the dirtcoffin had collapsed and the dark man was sprawled on the ground; naked.\"The Nagual tried to help him up and asked the men to give him a hand. Theylaughed at him. They thought he was drunk having the d.t.'s because there was noman, or dirt coffin, or anything like that in the field.\"The Nagual said that he was shaken but he didn't dare tell his benefactor aboutit. It didn't matter because at night a whole flock of phantoms came after him.He went to open the front door after someone knocked and a horde of naked menwith glaring yellow eyes burst in.\"They threw him to the floor and piled on top of him. They would have crushedevery bone in his body had it not been for the swift actions of his benefactor.He saw the phantoms and pulled the Nagual to safety to a hole in the groundwhich he always kept conveniently at the back of his house. He buried the Nagualthere while the ghosts squatted around waiting for their chance.The Nagual told me that he had become so frightened that he would voluntarily goback into his dirt coffin every night to sleep long after the phantoms hadvanished.\"Pablito stopped talking. Everyone seemed to be getting ready to leave. Theyfretted and changed position as if to show that they were tired of sitting.I then told them that I had had a very disturbing reaction upon hearing myfriend's statements about the Atlanteans walking at night in the pyramids ofTula. I had not recognized the depth at which I had accepted what don Juan anddon Genaro had taught me until that day.I realized that I had completely suspended judgment even though it was clear inmy mind that the possibility those colossal figures of stone could walk did notenter into the realm of serious speculation. My reaction was a total surprise tome.I explained to them at great length that the idea of the Atlanteans walking atnight was a clear example of the fixation of the second attention. I had arrivedat that conclusion using the following set of premises:First, that we are not merely whatever our common sense requires us to believewe are. We are in actuality luminous beings capable of becoming aware of ourluminosity.Second, that as luminous beings aware of our luminosity we are capable ofunraveling different facets of our awareness, or our attention, as don Juancalled it.Third, that the unraveling could be brought about by a deliberate effort as wewere trying to do ourselves, or accidentally, through a bodily trauma.Fourth, that there had been a time when sorcerers deliberately placed differentfacets of their attention on material objects.Fifth, that the Atlanteans, judging by their awe-inspiring setting, must havebeen objects of fixation for sorcerers of another time.I said that the custodian who had given my friend the information hadundoubtedly unraveled another facet of his attention; he might have unwittinglybecome, if only for a moment, a receptor for the projections of ancientsorcerers' second attention. It was not so farfetched to me then that the manmay have visualized the fixation of those sorcerers.If those sorcerers were members of don Juan's and don Genaro's tradition, theymust have been impeccable practitioners in which case there would have been nolimit to what they could accomplish with the fixation of their second attention.If they intended that the Atlanteans should walk at night, then the Atlanteanswould walk at night.As I talked, the three little sisters became very angry and agitated with me.When I finished, Lydia accused me of doing nothing else but talking. Then theygot up and left without even saying goodbye. The men followed them, but stoppedat the door and shook hands with me. La Gorda and I remained in the room.\"There is something very wrong with those women,\" I said.\"No. They're just tired of talking,\" la Gorda said. \"They expect some actionfrom you.\"\"How come the Genaros are not tired of talking?\" I asked.\"They are more stupid than the women,\" she replied dryly.\"How about you, Gorda?\" I asked. \"Are you also tired of talking?\"\"I don't know what I am,\" she said solemnly. \"When I am with you, I'm not tired;but when I am with the little sisters, I'm dead tired just like them.\"During the following uneventful days that I stayed with them, it was obviousthat the little sisters were thoroughly hostile to me. The Genaros tolerated mein an offhand way. Only la Gorda seemed to be aligned with me. I began to wonderwhy. I asked her about it before I left for Los Angeles.\"I don't know how it is possible, but I'm used to you,\" she said. \"It's as ifyou and I are together, while the little sisters the Genaros are in a differentworld.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"2. 'Seeing' Together For several weeks after my return to Los Angeles I had a sense of milddiscomfort which I explained away as a dizziness or a sudden loss of breath dueto physical exertion. It reached a climax one night when I woke up terrified;unable to breathe. The physician I went to see diagnosed my trouble ashyperventilation; most likely caused by tension. He prescribed a tranquilizerand suggested breathing into a paper bag if the attack should ever occur again.I decided to return to Mexico to seek la Gorda's counsel. After I told her thedoctor's diagnosis, she calmly assured me that no illness was involved; that Iwas finally losing my shields; and that what I was experiencing was the \"loss ofmy human form\" and the entrance into a new state of separation from humanaffairs.\"Don't fight it,\" she said. \"Our natural reaction is to struggle against it. Indoing so we dispel it. Let go of your fear and follow the loss of your humanform step by step.\"She added that in her case, the disintegration of her human form began in herwomb with a severe pain and an inordinate pressure that shifted slowly in twodirections; down her legs and up to her throat. She also said that the effectsare felt immediately.I wanted to record every nuance of my entrance into that new state. I preparedmyself to write down a detailed account of whatever took place, but to my utterchagrin nothing more happened.After a few days of fruitless expectation, I gave up on la Gorda's explanationand concluded that the doctor had correctly diagnosed my condition. It wasperfectly understandable to me. I was carrying a responsibility that generatedunbearable tension. I had accepted the leadership that the apprentices believedbelonged to me, but I had no idea how to lead.The pressure in my life also showed in a more serious way. My usual level ofenergy was dropping steadily. Don Juan would have said that I was losing mypersonal power and that eventually I would lose my life. Don Juan had set me upto live exclusively by means of 'personal power'; which I understood to be astate of being; a relationship of order between the subject and the universe; arelationship that cannot be disrupted without resulting in the subject's death.Since there was no foreseeable way to change my situation, I had concluded thatmy life was coming to an end. My feeling of being doomed seemed to infuriate allthe apprentices. I decided to get away from them for a couple of days to dispelmy gloom and their tension.When I came back, I found them standing outside the front door of the littlesisters' house as if they had been waiting for me. Nestor ran to my car, andbefore I even turned the motor off he blurted out that Pablito had run away.He had gone to die, Nestor said, in the city of Tula, the place of hisancestors. I was appalled. I felt guilty.La Gorda did not share my concern. She was beaming, exuding contentment.\"That little pimp is better off dead,\" she said. \"All of us are going to livetogether harmoniously now, as we should. The Nagual told us that you were goingto bring change into our lives. Well, you did. Pablito is not bugging us anylonger. You got rid of him. Look how happy we are. We are better off withouthim.\"I was outraged by her callousness. I stated as forcefully as I could that donJuan had given all of us, in a most painstaking manner, the format of awarrior's life. I stressed that the warrior's impeccability demanded that I notlet Pablito die just like that.\"And what do you think you're going to do?\" la Gorda asked.\"I'm going to take one of you to live with him,\" I said, \"until the day when allof you, including Pablito, can move out of here.\"They laughed at me, even Nestor and Benigno, who I thought were closest toPablito. La Gorda laughed longer than anyone else, obviously challenging me.I turned to Nestor and Benigno for moral support. They looked away.I appealed to la Gorda's superior understanding. I pleaded with her. I used allthe arguments I could think of. She looked at me with utter contempt.\"Let's get going,\" she said to the others.She gave me the most vacuous smile. She shrugged her shoulders, and made a vaguepuckering gesture with her lips.\"You're welcome to come with us,\" she said to me, \"providing that you don't askquestions or talk about that little pimp.\"\"You are a formless warrior, Gorda,\" I said. \"You told me that yourself. Why,then, do you judge Pablito?\"La Gorda did not answer. But she acknowledged the blow. She frowned and avoidedmy gaze.\"La Gorda is with us!\" Josefina yelled in a high-pitched voice.The three little sisters gathered around la Gorda and pulled her inside thehouse. I followed them. Nestor and Benigno also went inside.\"What are you going to do, take one of us by force?\" la Gorda asked me.I told all of them that I considered it my duty to help Pablito and that I woulddo the same for any one of them.\"You really think you can pull this off?\" la Gorda asked me; her eyes flaringwith anger.I wanted to roar with rage as I had once done in their presence, but thecircumstances were different. I could not do it.\"I'm going to take Josefina with me,\" I said. \"I am the Nagual.\"La Gorda gathered the three little sisters, and shielded them with her body.They were about to join hands. Something in me knew that if they did, theircombined strength would have been awesome and my efforts to take Josefina wouldhave been useless. My only chance was to strike before they had a chance togroup.I pushed Josefina with the palms of my hands and sent her reeling to the centerof the room. Before they had time to regroup themselves, I hit Lydia and Rosa.They bent over with pain. La Gorda came at me with a fury I had never witnessedin her. It was like the attack of a savage beast. Her whole concentration was ona single thrust of her body. If she had struck me, I would have been killed. Shemissed my chest by inches. I grabbed her from behind in a bear hug and wetumbled down. We rolled over and over until we were utterly exhausted. Her bodyrelaxed. She began to caress the back of my hands, which were tightly claspedaround her stomach.I noticed then that Nestor and Benigno were standing by the door. They bothseemed to be on the verge of becoming physically ill.La Gorda smiled shyly, and whispered in my ear that she was glad I had overcomeher.I took Josefina to Pablito. I had felt that she was the only one of theapprentices who genuinely needed someone to look after her, and Pablito resentedher the least. I was sure that his sense of chivalry would force him to reachout to her since she would be in need of help.A month later I returned once more to Mexico. Pablito and Josefina had returned.They were living together at don Genaro's house and shared it with Benigno andRosa. Nestor and Lydia lived at Soledad's place, and la Gorda lived alone in thelittle sisters' house.\"Do our new living arrangements surprise you?\" la Gorda asked.My surprise was more than evident. I wanted to know all the implications of thisnew organization.La Gorda let me know in a dry tone that there were no implications that she knewof. They had chosen to live in couples but not as couples. She added that,contrary to what I might think, they were impeccable warriors.The new format was rather pleasant. Everybody seemed to be completely relaxed.There was no more bickering or outbursts of competitive behavior among them.They had also taken to dressing in the Indian apparel typical of that region.The women wore dresses with full gathered skirts that almost touched the ground.They wore dark shawls, and their hair in braids; except for Josefina who alwayswore a hat. The men wore thin white pajama-like pants and shirts, and strawhats. All of them wore homemade sandals.I asked la Gorda the reason for their new way of dressing. She said that theywere getting ready to leave. Sooner or later, with my help or by themselves,they were going to leave that valley. They would be going into a new world; anew life. When they did that, they would acknowledge the change; the longer theywore their Indian clothes, the more drastic the change would be when they put oncity clothes.She added that they had been taught to be fluid; at ease in whatever situationthey found themselves; and that I had been taught the same. My challenge was todeal with them with ease regardless of what they did to me. Their challenge inturn was to leave their valley and settle down elsewhere to find out if theycould be as fluid as warriors should be.I asked for her honest opinion about our chances of succeeding. She said thatfailure was written all over our faces.La Gorda changed the subject abruptly, and told me that in her dreaming she hadfound herself staring at a gigantic narrow gorge between two enormous roundmountains. She thought that the two mountains were familiar to her, and wantedme to drive her to a nearby town. She believed, without knowing why, that thetwo mountains were located there and that the message from her dreaming was thatboth of us should go there.We left at the crack of dawn. I had driven through that town before. It was verysmall and I had never noticed anything in its surroundings that even came closeto la Gorda's vision. There were only eroded hills around it. It turned out thatthe two mountains were not there, or if they were, we could not find them.During the two hours that we spent in that town, however, both of us had afeeling that we knew something undefined; a feeling which turned at times into acertainty, and then receded again into the darkness to become merely annoyanceand frustration.Visiting that town unsettled us in mysterious ways; or rather, for unknownreasons we became very agitated. I was in the throes of a most illogicalconflict. I did not remember having ever stopped in that town, and yet I couldhave sworn that I had not only been there, but had lived there for a time.It was not a clear memory. I did not remember the streets or the houses. What Ifelt was a vague but strong apprehension that something was going to becomeclear in my mind. I was not sure what; a memory perhaps. At moments that vagueapprehension became paramount, especially when I saw a particular house. Iparked in front of it. La Gorda and I looked at it from the car for perhaps anhour. Yet neither of us suggested leaving the car to go into it.Both of us were very edgy. We began to talk about her vision of the twomountains. Our conversation soon turned into an argument. She thought I had nottaken her dreaming seriously. Our tempers flared and we ended up yelling at eachother; not so much out of anger, as out of nervousness. I caught myself andstopped.On our way back, I parked the car on the side of the dirt road. We got out tostretch our legs. We walked for a while. It was too windy to enjoy it. La Gordastill seemed to be agitated. We went back to the car and sat inside.\"If you would only rally your knowledge,\" la Gorda said in a pleading tone. \"Youwould know that losing the human form ...\"She stopped in midsentence, My frown must have brought her up short. She wascognizant of my struggle. If there was any knowledge in me that I could haveconsciously rallied, I would have done it already.\"But we are luminous beings,\" she said in the same pleading tone. \"There is somuch more to us. You are the Nagual. There is even more to you.\"\"What do you think I should do?\" I asked.\"You must let go of your desire to cling,\" she said. \"The very same thinghappened to me. I held on to things, such as the food I liked, the mountainswhere I lived, the people I used to enjoy talking to, but most of all, I clungto the desire to be liked.\"I told her that her advice was meaningless to me for I was not aware of holdingon to anything. She insisted that somehow I knew that I was putting up barriersto losing my human form.\"Our attention is trained to focus doggedly,\" she went on. \"That is the way wemaintain the world. Your first attention has been taught to focus on somethingthat's quite strange to me, but very familiar to you.\"I told her that my mind dwells on abstractions- not abstractions likemathematics, for instance, but rather propositions of reasonableness.\"Now is the time to let go of all that,\" she said. \"In order to lose your humanform you should let go of all that ballast. You counterbalance so hard that youparalyze yourself.\"I was in no mood to argue. What she called losing the human form was a concepttoo vague for immediate consideration. I was concerned with what we hadexperienced in that town. La Gorda did not want to talk about it.\"The only thing that counts is that you rally your knowledge,\", she said. \"Youcan do it if you need to like that day when Pablito ran away and you and I cameto blows.\"La Gorda said that what had happened on that day was an example of \"rallyingone's knowledge.\" Without being thoroughly aware of what I was doing, I hadperformed complex maneuvers which required seeing.\"You did not just attack us,\" she said. \"You saw.\"She was right; in a manner of speaking. Something quite out of the ordinary hadtaken place on that occasion. I had considered it in great detail, confining it,however, to purely personal speculation. I had no adequate explanation for it,outside of saying that the emotional charge of the moment had affected me ininconceivable ways.When I had stepped inside their house and faced the four women, I became awarein one split second that I was able to shift my ordinary way of perceiving. Isaw four amorphous blobs of very intense amber light in front of me. One of themwas more mellow; more pleasing. The other three were unfriendly, sharp,whitish-amber glows. The mellow glow was la Gorda. And at that moment the threeunfriendly glows were looming menacingly over her.The blob of whitish luminosity closest to me, which was Josefina, was a bitoff-balance. It was leaning over, so I gave it a push. I kicked the other two ina depression they each had on their right side. I had no conscious idea that Ishould kick them there. I simply found the indentation convenient- somehow itinvited me to put my foot in it. The result was devastating. Lydia and Rosafainted on the spot. I had kicked each of them on their right thigh. It was nota kick that could have broken any bones. I only pushed the blobs of light infront of me with my foot. Nonetheless, it was as if I had given them a ferociousblow in the most vulnerable part of their bodies.La Gorda was right, I had rallied some knowledge I was not aware of. If that wascalled seeing, the logical conclusion for my intellect would be to say thatseeing is a bodily knowledge. The predominance of the visual sense in usinfluences this bodily knowledge and makes it seem to be eye-related. What Iexperienced was not altogether visual.I saw the blobs of light with something else besides my eyes, since I wasconscious that the four women were in my field of vision during the entire timeI dealt with them. The blobs of light were not even superimposed on them. Thetwo sets of images were separate.What complicated the issue for me was the matter of time. Everything wascompressed into a few seconds. If I did shift from one scene to the other, theshift must have been so fast that it became meaningless. Thus I can only recallperceiving two separate scenes simultaneously.After I had kicked the two blobs of light, the mellow one- la Gorda- came towardme. It did not come straight at me, but angled to my left from the moment itstarted to move; it obviously intended to miss me, so when the glow passed by Igrabbed it. As I rolled over and over on the floor with it, I felt I was meltinginto it. That was the only time I really lost the sense of continuity. I againbecame aware of myself while la Gorda was caressing the backs of my hands.\"In our dreaming, the little sisters and I have learned to join hands,\" la Gordasaid. \"We know how to make a line. Our problem that day was that we had nevermade that line outside our room. That was why they dragged me inside. Your bodyknew what it meant for us to join hands. If we had done it, I would have beenunder their control. They are more fierce than I am. Their bodies are tightlysealed. They are not concerned with sex. I am. That makes me weaker. I'm surethat your concern with sex is what makes it very difficult for you to rally yourknowledge.\"She went on talking about the debilitating effects of having sex. I felt ill atease. I tried to steer the conversation away from that topic, but she seemeddetermined to go back to it regardless of my discomfort.\"Let's you and I drive to Mexico City,\" I said in desperation.I thought I would shock her. She did not answer. She puckered her lips;squinting her eyes. She contracted the muscles of her chin, pushing her upperlip until it bulged under her nose. Her face became so contorted that I wastaken aback. She reacted to my surprise, and relaxed her facial muscles.\"Come on, Gorda,\" I said. \"Let's go to Mexico City.\"\"Sure. Why not?\" she said. \"What do I need?\"I did not expect that reaction and ended up shocked myself.\"Nothing,\" I said. \"We'll go as we are.\"Without saying another word, she slumped on the seat and we drove off towardMexico City. It was still early; not even midday. I asked her if she would dareto go to Los Angeles with me. She was pensive for a moment.\"I've just asked my luminous body that question,\" she said.\"What did it say?\"\"It said only if power permits it.\"There was such a wealth of feeling in her voice that I stopped the car andhugged her. My affection for her at that moment was so deep that I gotfrightened. It had nothing to do with sex or the need of psychologicalreinforcement. It was a feeling that transcended everything I knew.Embracing la Gorda brought back the sense I had had earlier that something in mewhich was bottled up, pushed into recesses I could not consciously reach, wasabout to come out. I almost knew then what it was, but I lost it when I reachedfor it.La Gorda and I arrived in the city of Oaxaca in the early evening. I parked mycar on a side street and then we walked to the center of town to the plaza. Welooked for the bench where don Juan and don Genaro used to sit. It wasunoccupied. We sat there in reverent silence. Finally la Gorda said that she hadbeen there with don Juan many times as well as with someone else she could notremember. She was not sure whether that was something she had merely dreamed.\"What did you do with don Juan on this bench?\" I asked.\"Nothing. We just sat waiting for the bus, or for the lumber truck that wouldgive us a ride up the mountains,\" she replied.I told her that when I sat on that bench with don Juan, we would talk for hours.I recounted for her the great predilection that he had for poetry, and how Iused to read it to him when we had nothing else to do. He would listen to poemson the premise that only the first or sometimes the second stanza was worthwhilereading. The rest he found to be indulgence on the poet's part. There were veryfew poems, of the hundreds I must have read to him, that he listened to all theway through.At first I read to him what I liked. My preference was for abstract, convoluted,cerebral poetry. Later he made me read over and over what he liked. In hisopinion a poem had to be compact- preferably short- and it had to be made up ofprecise poignant images of great simplicity.In the late afternoons, sitting on that bench in Oaxaca, a poem by Cesar Vallejoalways seemed to sum up for him a special feeling of longing. I recited it to laGorda from memory; not so much for her benefit as for mine. I wonder what she is doing at this hourmy Andean and sweet Ritaof reeds and wild cherry trees.Now that this weariness chokes me, and blood dozes off,like lazy brandy inside me.I wonder what she is doing with those handsthat in attitude of penitenceused to iron starchy whiteness,in the afternoons.Now that this rain is taking away my desire to go on.I wonder what has become of her skirt with lace;of her toils; of her walk;of her scent of spring sugar cane from that place.She must be at the door,gazing at a fast moving cloud.A wild bird on the tile roof will let out a call;and shivering she will say at last, \"Jesus, it's cold!\" The memory of don Juan was incredibly vivid. It was not a memory on the level ofmy thought, nor was it on the level of my conscious feelings. It was an unknownkind of memory that made me weep. Tears were streaming from my eyes, but theywere not soothing at all.The last hour of the afternoon had always had special significance for don Juan.I had accepted his regard for that hour, and his conviction that if something ofimportance were to come to me, it would have to be at that time.La Gorda put her head on my shoulder. I rested my head on her head. We remainedin that position for a while. I felt relaxed. The agitation had been driven awayfrom me. It was strange that the single act of resting my head on la Gorda'swould bring such peace.I wanted to make a joke and tell her that we should tie our heads together. ThenI knew that she would actually take me up on that. My body shook with laughterand I realized that I was asleep, yet my eyes were open. If I had really wantedto, I could have stood up. I did not want to move, so I remained there fullyawake and yet asleep.I saw people walking by and staring at us. I did not mind that in the least.Ordinarily I would have objected to being noticed. Then all at once the peoplein front of me changed into very large blobs of white light.I was facing the luminous eggs in a sustained fashion for the first time in mylife! Don Juan had told me that human beings appear to the seer as luminouseggs. I had experienced flashes of that perception, but never before had Ifocused my vision on them as I was doing that day.The blobs of light were quite amorphous at first. It was as if my eyes were notproperly focused. But then, at one moment, it was as if I had finally arrangedmy vision and the blobs of white light became oblong luminous eggs. They werebig, in fact, they were enormous, perhaps seven feet high by four feet wide oreven larger.At one moment I noticed that the eggs were no longer moving. I saw a solid massof luminosity in front of me. The eggs were watching me; looming dangerouslyover me. I moved deliberately and sat up straight. La Gorda was sound asleep onmy shoulder. There was a group of adolescents around us. They must have thoughtthat we were drunk. They were mimicking us. The most daring adolescent wasfeeling la Gorda's breasts. I shook her and woke her up.We stood up in a hurry and left. They followed us, taunting us and yellingobscenities. The presence of a policeman on the corner dissuaded them fromcontinuing with their harassment. We walked in complete silence from the plazato where I had left my car. It was almost evening. Suddenly la Gorda grabbed myarm. Her eyes were wild; her mouth open. She pointed.\"Look! Look!\" she yelled. \"There's the Nagual and Genaro!\"I saw two men turning the corner a long block ahead of us. La Gorda took off ina fast run. Running after her, I asked her if she was sure. She was besideherself. She said that when she had looked up, both don Juan and don Genaro werestaring at her. The moment her eyes met theirs they moved away.When we reached the corner ourselves, the two men were still the same distanceaway from us. I could not distinguish their features. They were dressed likerural Mexican men. They were wearing straw hats. One was husky, like don Juan.The other was thin, like don Genaro.The two men went around another corner and we again ran noisily after them. Thestreet they had turned onto was deserted and led to the outskirts of town. Itcurved slightly to the left. The two men were just where the street curved.Right then something happened that made me feel it was possible they mightreally be don Juan and don Genaro. It was a movement that the smaller man made.He turned three-quarter profile to us and tilted his head as if telling us tofollow; something don Genaro used to do to me whenever we were out in the woods.He always walked ahead of me; daring, coaxing me with a movement of his head tocatch up with him.La Gorda began to yell at the top of her voice. \"Nagual! Genaro! Wait!\"She ran ahead of me. They were walking very fast toward some shacks that werehalf-visible in the semi-darkness. They must have entered one of them or turnedinto any of a number of pathways; suddenly they were out of sight.La Gorda stood there and bellowed their names without any bashfulness. Peoplecame out to see who was yelling. I held her until she calmed down.\"They were right in front of me,\" she said, crying. \"Not even ten feet away.When I yelled and called your attention to them, they were a block away in oneinstant.\"I tried to appease her. She was in a high state of nervousness. She clung to meshivering. For some indiscernible reason I was absolutely sure that the two menwere not don Juan and don Genaro; therefore, I could not share la Gorda'sagitation.She said that we had to drive back home; that power would not permit her to goto Los Angeles or even to Mexico City with me. It was not time yet for herjourney. She was convinced that seeing them had been an omen. They haddisappeared pointing toward the east, toward her hometown.I did not have any objections to starting back that very moment. After all thethings that had happened to us that day, I should have been dead tired. InsteadI was vibrating with a most extravagant vigor reminiscent of times with don Juanwhen I had felt like ramming walls with my shoulders.On our way back to my car, I was again filled with the most passionate affectionfor la Gorda. I could never thank her enough for her help. I thought thatwhatever she had done to help me see the luminous eggs had worked. She had beenso courageous; risking ridicule and even bodily harm by sitting on that bench. Iexpressed my thanks to her. She looked at me as if I were crazy and then brokeinto a belly laugh.\"I thought the same thing about you,\" she said. \"I thought you had done it justfor me. I too saw luminous eggs. This was the first time for me also. We haveseen together! Like the Nagual and Genaro used to do.\"As I opened the door of the car for la Gorda, the full impact of what we haddone struck me. Up to that point I had been numb. Something in me had sloweddown. Now my euphoria was as intense as la Gorda's agitation had been a shortwhile before. I wanted to run in the street and shout.It was la Gorda's turn to contain me. She squatted and rubbed my calves.Strangely enough, I calmed down immediately. I found that it was difficult forme to talk. My thoughts were running ahead of my ability to verbalize them. Idid not want to drive back to her hometown right away. There seemed to be stillso much more to do. Since I could not explain clearly what I wanted, Ipractically dragged a reluctant Gorda back to the plaza, but there were no emptybenches at that hour.I was famished so I pulled her into a restaurant. She thought she could not eatbut when they brought the food she turned out to be as hungry as I was. Eatingrelaxed us completely.We sat on the bench later that night. I had refrained from talking about whathappened to us until we had a chance to sit there. La Gorda was at firstunwilling to say anything. My mind was in a peculiar state of exhilaration. Ihad had similar moments with don Juan, but they were associated, as a rule, withthe aftereffects of hallucinogenic plants.I began by describing to la Gorda what I had seen. The feature of those luminouseggs that had impressed me the most was their movements. They did not walk. Theymoved in a floating manner, yet they were grounded. The way they moved was notpleasing. Their movements were stilted, wooden, and jerky.When they were in motion the whole egg shape became smaller and rounder. Theyseemed to jump or jerk, or shake up and down with great speed. The result was amost annoying nervous shivering. Perhaps the closest I can get to describing thephysical discomfort caused by their motion would be to say that I felt as if theimages on a moving picture screen had been speeded up.Another thing that had intrigued me was that I could not detect any legs. I hadonce seen a ballet production in which the dancers mimicked the movement ofsoldiers on ice skates. For that effect, they wore loose tunics that hung allthe way to the floor. There was no way to see their feet, thus the illusion thatthey were gliding on ice.The luminous eggs that paraded in front of me gave the impression that they weresliding on a rough surface. Their luminosity shook up and down almostimperceptibly, yet enough to make me nearly ill. When the eggs were in reposethey became elongated. Some of them were so long and rigid that they brought tomind the idea of a wooden icon.Another even more disturbing feature of the luminous eggs was the absence ofeyes. I had never realized so acutely how we are drawn to the eyes of livingbeings. The luminous eggs were thoroughly alive. They were observing me withgreat curiosity. I could see them jerking up and down; leaning over to watch me,but without any eyes.Many of those luminous eggs had black spots on them, huge spots below themidsection. Others did not. La Gorda had told me that reproduction affects thebodies of both men and women by causing a hole to appear below the stomach, butthe spots on those luminous eggs did not seem like holes to me. They were areaswith no luminosity, but there was no depth to them.Those that had the black spots seemed to be mellow, tired. The crest of theiregg shape was wilted. It looked opaque in comparison to the rest of their glow.The ones without spots, on the other hand, were dazzlingly bright. I fanciedthem to be dangerous. They were vibrant; filled with energy and whiteness.La Gorda said that the instant I rested my head on her she also entered into astate that resembled dreaming. She was awake, yet she could not move. She wasconscious that people were milling around us. Then she saw them turning intoluminous blobs and finally into egg-shaped creatures.She did not know that I was also seeing. She had thought at first that I waswatching over her, but at one moment the pressure of my head was so heavy thatshe concluded quite consciously that I too must have been seeing. Only after Istraightened up and caught the young man fondling her as she seemed to sleep,did I have an inkling of what might be happening to her.Our visions differed in that she could distinguish men from women by the shapeof some filaments that she called 'roots'. Women, she said, had thick bundles offilaments that resembled a lion's tail. They grew inward from the place of thegenitalia. She explained that those roots were the givers of life. The embryo,in order to accomplish its growth, attaches itself to one of those nurturingroots and thoroughly consumes it, leaving only a hole.Men, on the other hand, had short filaments that were alive and floating almostseparately from the luminous mass of their bodies.I asked her what in her opinion was the reason we had seen together. Shedeclined to make any comment, but she coaxed me to go ahead with myspeculations. I told her that the only thing that occurred to me was theobvious; emotions must have been a factor.After la Gorda and I had sat down on don Juan's favorite bench in the lateafternoon, and I had recited the poem that he liked, I was highly charged withemotion. My emotions must have prepared my body.But I also had to consider the fact that from doing dreaming, I had learned toenter into a state of total quietness. I was able to turn off my internaldialogue and remain as if I were inside a cocoon, peeking out of a hole. In thatstate I could either let go of some control I had and enter into dreaming, or Icould hold on to that control and remain passive, thoughtless, and withoutdesires.I did not think, however, that those were the significant factors. I believedthe catalyst was la Gorda. I thought it was what I felt for her which hadcreated the conditions for seeing.La Gorda laughed shyly when I told her what I believed.\"I don't agree with you,\" she said. \"I think what has happened is that your bodyhas started to remember.\"\"What do you mean by that, Gorda?\" I asked.There was a long pause. She seemed to be either fighting to say something shedid not want to say, or she was desperately trying to find the appropriate word.\"There are so many things that I know,\" she said, \"and yet I don't know what Iknow. I remember so many things that I finally end up remembering nothing. Ithink you are in the same predicament yourself.\"I assured her that I was not aware of it. She refused to believe me.\"At times I really believe you don't know,\" she said. \"At other times I believeyou are playing with us. The Nagual told me that he himself didn't know. A lotof things that he told me about you are coming back to me now.\"\"What does it mean that my body has begun to remember?\" I insisted.\"Don't ask me that,\" she said with a smile. \"I don't know what you are supposedto remember, or what that remembering is like. I've never done it myself. I knowthat much.\"\"Is there anybody among the apprentices who could tell me?\" I asked.\"No one,\" she said. \"I think I'm a courier to you; a courier who can bring youonly half a message this time.\"She stood up and begged me to drive her back to her hometown. I was tooexhilarated to leave then. We walked around the plaza at my suggestion. Finallywe sat down on another bench.\"Isn't it strange to you that we could see together with such ease?\" la Gordaasked.I did not know what she had in mind. I was hesitant in answering.\"What would you say if I told you that I think we've seen together before?\" laGorda asked, carefully voicing her words.I could not understand what she meant. She repeated the question one more timeand I still could not get her meaning.\"When could we have seen together before?\" I asked. \"Your question doesn't makesense.\"\"That's the point,\" she replied. \"It doesn't make sense, and yet I have thefeeling we have seen together before.\"I felt a chill and stood up. I remembered again the sensation I had had in thattown. La Gorda opened her mouth to say something but stopped herself inmid-sentence. She stared at me, bewildered, put her hand to my lips, and thenpractically dragged me to the car.I drove all night. I wanted to talk, to analyze, but she fell asleep as ifpurposely avoiding any discussion. She was right, of course. Of the two of us,she was the one who was cognizant of the danger of dissipating a mood throughover analysing it.When we arrived at her house, as she got out of the car she said that we couldnot talk at all about what happened to us in Oaxaca.\"Why is that, Gorda?\" I asked.\"I don't want to waste our power,\" she said. \"That's the sorcerer's way. Neverwaste your gains.\"\"But if we don't talk about it, we'll never know what really happened to us,\" Iprotested.\"We have to keep quiet for at least nine days,\" she said.\"Can we talk about it just between the two of us?\" I asked.\"A talk between the two of us is precisely what we must avoid,\" she said. \"We'revulnerable. We must allow ourselves time to heal.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"3. Quasi Memories of the Other Self \"Can you tell us what's going on?\" Nestor asked me when all of us were togetherat night. \"Where did you two go yesterday?\"I had forgotten la Gorda's recommendation that we not talk about what hadhappened to us. I began to tell them that we had gone first to the nearby townand we had found a most intriguing house there.All of them seemed to have been touched by a sudden tremor. They perked up,looked at one another, and then they stared at la Gorda as if waiting for her totell them about it.\"What kind of a house was it?\" Nestor asked.Before I had time to answer, la Gorda interrupted me. She began to talk in ahurried almost incoherent manner. It was evident to me that she was improvising.She even used words and phrases in the Mazatec language. She gave me furtiveglances that spelled out a silent plea not to say anything about it.\"How about your dreaming, Nagual?\" she asked me with the relief of someone whohas found the way out. \"We'd like to know everything you do. I think it's veryimportant that you tell us.\"She leaned over and as casually as she could she whispered in my ear thatbecause of what had happened to us in Oaxaca I had to tell them about mydreaming.\"Why would it be important to you?\" I said loudly.\"I think we are very close to the end,\" la Gorda said solemnly. \"Everything yousay or do to us is of key importance now.\"I related to them the events of what I considered my true dreaming. Don Juan hadtold me that there was no point in emphasizing the trials. He gave me a rule ofthumb. If I should have the same vision three times, he said, I had to payextraordinary attention to it. Otherwise, a neophyte's [* neophyte- a newparticipant in some activity] attempts were merely a stepping stone to buildingthe second attention.I dreamed once that I woke up and jumped out of bed only to be confronted bymyself still sleeping in bed. I watched myself asleep, and had the self-controlto remember that I was dreaming. I followed then the directions don Juan hadgiven me, which were to avoid sudden jolts or surprises, and to take everythingwith a grain of salt.The dreamer has to get involved, don Juan had said, in dispassionateexperimentations. Rather than examining his sleeping body, the dreamer walks outof the room. I suddenly found myself, without knowing how, outside my room. Ihad the absolutely clear sensation that I had been placed there instantaneously.When I first stood outside my door, the hall and the staircase were monumental.If anything really scared me that night, it was the size of those structureswhich in real life were thoroughly commonplace. The hall was about fifty feetlong and the staircase had sixteen steps.I could not conceive how to cover the enormous distances I was perceiving. Ivacillated, [* vacillate- be undecided about something; waver betweenconflicting positions or courses of action] then something made me move.I did not walk, though. I did not feel my steps. Suddenly I was holding on thethe railing. I could see my hands and forearms but I did not feel them. I washolding on by the force of something that had nothing to do with my musculatureas I know it. The same thing happened when I tried to go down the stairs. I didnot know how to walk. I just could not take a step. It was as if my legs werewelded together. I could see my legs by leaning over, but I could not move themforward or laterally, nor could I lift them up toward my chest. I seemed to bestuck to the top step. I felt I was like those inflated plastic dolls that canlean in any direction until they are horizontal, only to be pulled upright againby the weight of their heavy rounded bases.I made a supreme effort to walk and bounced from step to step like a clumsyball. It took an incredible degree of attention to get to the ground floor. Icould not describe it in any other way. Some form of attentiveness was requiredto maintain the bounds of my vision; to prevent it from disintegrating into thefleeting images of an ordinary dream.When I finally got to the street door I could not open it. I tried desperately,but to no avail. Then I recalled that I had gotten out of my room by gliding outof it as if the door had been open. All I needed was to recall that feeling ofgliding and suddenly I was out in the street.It looked dark- a peculiarly lead-gray darkness that did not permit me toperceive any colors. My interest was drawn immediately to an enormous lagoon ofbrightness right in front of me at my eye level. I deduced rather than perceivedthat it was the street light, since I knew there was one right on the cornertwenty feet above the ground.I knew then that I could not make the perceptual arrangements needed in order tojudge up, or down, or here, or there. Everything seemed to be extraordinarilypresent. I had no mechanism, as in ordinary life, to arrange my perception.Everything was there in the foreground and I had no volition to construct anadequate screening procedure.I stayed in the street, bewildered, until I began to have the sensation that Iwas levitating. I held on to the metal pole that supported the light and thestreet sign on the corner. A strong breeze was lifting me up. I was sliding upthe pole until I could plainly see the name of the street; Ashton.Months later, when I again found myself in a dream looking at my sleeping body,I already had a repertoire [* repertoire- the entire range of skills or devicesused in a particular activity] of things to do. In the course of my regulardreaming I had learned that what matters in that state was volition. [*volition- the capability of conscious choice and decision and intention] Thecorporeality [* corporeality- the quality of being physical; consisting ofmatter] of the body has no significance: It is simply a memory that slows downthe dreamer.I glided out of the room without hesitation, since I did not have to act out themotions of opening a door or walking in order to move. The hall and staircasewere not as enormous as they appeared to be the first time. I glided throughwith great ease and ended up in the street where I willed myself to move threeblocks.I became aware then that the lights were still very disturbing sights. If Ifocused my attention on them, they became pools of immeasurable size. The otherelements of that dream were easy to control. The buildings were extraordinarilylarge, but their features were familiar. I pondered what to do.And then, quite casually, I realized that if I did not stare at things, but onlyglanced at them just as we do in our daily world, I could arrange my perception.In other words, if I followed don Juan's suggestions to the letter, and took mydreaming for granted, I could use the perceptual biases of my everyday life.After a few moments the scenery became, if not completely familiar,controllable.The next time I had a similar dream, I went to my favorite coffee shop on thecorner. The reason I selected it was because I was used to going there all thetime in the very early hours of the morning. In my dreaming, I saw the usualwaitresses who worked the graveyard shift. I saw a row of people eating at thecounter; and right at the very end of the counter I saw a peculiar character. Aman I saw nearly every day walking aimlessly around the UCLA campus. He was theonly person who actually looked at me. The instant I came in, he seemed to senseme. He turned around and stared at me.I found the same man in my waking hours a few days later in the same coffee shopin the early hours of the morning. He took one look at me, and seemed torecognize me. He looked horrified, and ran away without giving me a chance totalk to him.While dreaming, I came back once more to the same coffee shop and that was whenthe course of my dreaming changed. As I was watching the restaurant from acrossthe street, the scene altered.I could not see the familiar buildings any more. Instead I saw primeval scenery.It was no longer night. It was bright daylight and I was looking at a lushvalley. Swampy, deep-green, reedlike plants grew all over. Next to me there wasa rock ledge eight to ten feet high. A huge saber-toothed tiger was sittingthere.I was petrified. We looked at each other fixedly for a long time. The size ofthat beast was striking, yet it was not grotesque or out of proportion. It had asplendid head, big eyes the color of dark honey, massive paws, and an enormousrib cage.What impressed me the most was the color of its fur. It was uniformly darkbrown; almost chocolate. Its color reminded me of roasted coffee beans, onlylustrous. It had strangely longish fur; not matted or ratty. It did not looklike a puma's fur, or a wolf's, or a polar bear's either. It looked likesomething I had never seen before.From that time on, it became routine for me to see the tiger. At times thescenery was cloudy and chilly. I could see rain in the valley, thick, copiousrain. At other times the valley was bathed in sunlight. Quite often I would seeother saber-toothed tigers in the valley. I could hear their unique squeakingroar- a most nauseating sound to me.The tiger never touched me. We stared at each other from ten to twelve feetaway. Yet I could tell what he wanted. He was showing me how to breathe in aspecific manner. It got to the point in my dreaming where I could imitate thetiger's breathing so well that I felt I was turning into one. I told theapprentices that a tangible result of my dreaming was that my body became moremuscular.After listening to my account, Nestor marveled at how different their dreamingwas from mine. They had particular dreaming tasks. His was to find cures foranything that ailed the human body. Benigno's task was to predict, foresee, orfind a solution for anything that was of human concern. Pablito's task was tofind ways to build. Nestor said that those tasks were the reason why he dealtwith medicinal plants, Benigno had an oracle, and Pablito was a carpenter. Headded that, so far, they had only scratched the surface of their dreaming andthat they had nothing of substance to report.\"You may think that we've done a great deal,\" he went on, \"but we haven't.Genaro and the Nagual did everything for us and for these four women. We've donenothing on our own yet.\"\"It seems to me that the Nagual set you up differently,\" Benigno said, speakingvery slowly and deliberately. \"You must've been a tiger and you are definitelygoing to turn into one again. That's what happened to the Nagual. He had been acrow already, and while in this life he turned into one again.\"\"The problem is that that kind of tiger doesn't exist any more,\" Nestor said.\"We never heard what happens in that case.\"He swept his head around to include all of them with his gesture.\"I know what happens,\" la Gorda said. \"I remember that the Nagual Juan Matuscalled that ghost dreaming. He said that none of us has ever done ghost dreamingbecause we are not violent or destructive. He never did it himself. And he saidthat whoever does it is marked by fate to have ghost helpers and allies.\"\"What does that mean, Gorda?\" I asked.\"It means that you're not like us,\" she replied somberly.La Gorda seemed to be very agitated. She stood up, and paced up and down theroom four or five times before she sat down again by my side.There was a gap of silence in the conversation. Josefina mumbled somethingunintelligible. She also seemed to be very nervous. La Gorda tried to calm herdown; hugging her and patting her back.\"Josefina has something to tell you about Eligio,\" la Gorda said to me.Everyone looked at Josefina without saying a word; a question in their eyes.\"In spite of the fact that Eligio has disappeared from the face of the earth,\"la Gorda went on, \"he is still one of us. And Josefina talks to him all thetime.\"The rest of them suddenly became attentive. They looked at one another and thenthey looked at me.\"They meet in dreaming,\" la Gorda said dramatically.Josefina took a deep breath, she seemed to be the epitome [* epitome- a standardor typical example] of nervousness. Her body shook convulsively. Pablito lay ontop of her on the floor, and began breathing hard with his diaphragm, pushing itin and out, forcing her to breathe in unison with him.\"What's he doing?\" I asked la Gorda.\"What's he doing! Can't you see?\" she replied sharply.I whispered to her that I was aware that he was trying to make her relax, butthat his procedure was novel to me. She said that Pablito was giving Josefinaenergy by placing his midsection, where men have a surplus of it, overJosefina's womb, where women store their energy.Josefina sat up and smiled at me. She seemed to be perfectly relaxed.\"I do meet Eligio all the time,\" she said. \"He waits for me every day.\"\"How come you've never told us that?\" Pablito asked in a huffy tone.\"She told me,\" la Gorda interrupted, and then she went into a lengthyexplanation of what it meant to all of us that Eligio was available. She addedthat she had been waiting for a sign from me to disclose Eligio's words.\"Don't beat around the bush, woman!\" Pablito yelled. \"Tell us his words.\"\"They are not for you!\" la Gorda yelled back.\"Who are they for, then?\" Pablito asked.\"They are for the Nagual,\" la Gorda yelled, pointing at me.La Gorda apologized for raising her voice. She said that whatever Eligio hadsaid was complex and mysterious, and she could not make heads or tails of it.\"I just listened to him. That's all I was able to do, listen to him,\" la Gordacontinued.\"Do you mean you also meet Eligio?\" Pablito asked in a tone that was a mixtureof anger and expectation.\"I do,\" la Gorda replied in almost a whisper. \"I couldn't talk about it becauseI had to wait for him.\"She pointed to me, and then pushed me with both hands. I momentarily lost mybalance and tumbled down on my side.\"What is this? What are you doing to him?\" Pablito asked in a very angry voice.\"Was that a display of Indian love?\"I turned to la Gorda. She made a gesture with her lips to tell me to be quiet.\"Eligio says that you are the Nagual, but you are not for us,\" Josefina said tome.There was dead silence in the room. I did not know what to make of Josefina'sstatement. I had to wait until someone else talked.\"Do you feel relieved?\" la Gorda prodded me.I said to all of them that I did not have any opinions one way or the other.They looked like children- bewildered children. La Gorda had the air of amistress of ceremonies who is thoroughly embarrassed.Nestor stood up and faced la Gorda. He spoke a phrase in Mazatec to her. It hadthe sound of a command or a reproach.\"Tell us everything you know, Gorda,\" he went on in Spanish. \"You have no rightto play with us, to hold back something so important, just for yourself.\"La Gorda protested vehemently. She explained that she was holding on to what sheknew because Eligio had asked her to do so. Josefina assented with a nod of herhead.\"Did he tell all this to you or to Josefina?\" Pablito asked.\"We were together,\" la Gorda said in a barely audible whisper.\"You mean you and Josefina dream together!\" Pablito exclaimed breathlessly.The surprise in his voice corresponded to the shock wave that seemed to gothrough the rest of them.\"What exactly has Eligio said to you two?\" Nestor asked when the shock hadsubsided.\"He said that I should try to help the Nagual remember his left side,\" la Gordasaid.\"Do you know what she's talking about?\" Nestor asked me.There was no possibility that I would have known. I told them that they shouldturn to themselves for answers. But none of them voiced any suggestions.\"He told Josefina other things which she can't remember,\" la Gorda said. \"So weare in a real fix. Eligio said that you are definitely the Nagual and you haveto help us, but that you are not for us. Only upon remembering your left sidecan you take us to where we have to go.\"Nestor spoke to Josefina in a fatherly manner, and urged her to remember whatEligio had said. Nestor did that rather than insisting that I should remembersomething which must have been in some sort of code since none of us could makesense of it.Josefina winced and frowned as if she were under a heavy weight that was pushingher down. She actually looked like a rag doll that was being compressed. Iwatched in true fascination.\"I can't,\" she finally said. \"I know what he's talking about when he speaks tome, but I can't say now what it is. It doesn't come out.\"\"Do you remember any words?\" Nestor asked. \"Any single words?\"She stuck her tongue out, shook her head from side to side, and screamed at thesame time.\"No. I can't,\" she said after a moment.\"What kind of dreaming do you do, Josefina?\" I asked.\"The only kind I know,\" she snapped.\"I've told you how I do mine,\" I said. \"Now tell me how you do yours.\"\"I close my eyes and I see this wall,\" she said. \"It's like a wall of fog.Eligio waits for me there. He takes me through it and shows me things, Isuppose. I don't know what we do, but we do things together. Then he brings meback to the wall and lets me go; and I come back and forget what I've seen.\"\"How did you happen to go with la Gorda?\" I asked.\"Eligio told me to get her,\" she said. \"The two of us waited for la Gorda, andwhen she went into her dreaming we snatched her and pulled her behind that wall.We've done that twice.\"\"How did you snatch her?\" I asked,\"I don't know!\" Josefina replied. \"But I'll wait for you and when you do yourdreaming, I'll snatch you and then you'll know.\"\"Can you snatch anyone?\" I asked.\"Sure,\" she said, smiling. \"But I don't do it because it's a waste. I snatchedla Gorda because Eligio told me that he wanted to tell her something on accountof her being more levelheaded than I am.\"\"Then Eligio must have told you the same things, Gorda,\" Nestor said with afirmness that was not familiar to me.La Gorda made an unusual gesture of lowering her head, opening her mouth on thesides, shrugging her shoulders, and lifting her arms above her head.\"Josefina has just told you what happened,\" she said. \"There is no way for me toremember. Eligio speaks with a different speed. He speaks but my body cannotunderstand him. No. No. My body cannot remember. That's what it is. I know hesaid that the Nagual here will remember, and will take us to where we have togo. He couldn't tell me more because there was so much to tell and so littletime. He said that somebody, and I don't remember who, is waiting for me inparticular.\"\"Is that all he said?\" Nestor insisted.\"The second time I saw him, he told me that all of us will have to remember ourleft side, sooner or later, if we want to get to where we have to go. But he isthe one who has to remember first.\"She pointed to me and pushed me again as she had done earlier. The force of hershove sent me tumbling like a ball.\"What are you doing this for, Gorda?\" I asked, a bit annoyed at her.\"I'm trying to help you remember,\" she said. \"The Nagual Juan Matus told me thatI should give you a push from time to time in order to jolt you.\"La Gorda hugged me in a very abrupt movement.\"Help us, Nagual\" she pleaded. \"We are worse off than dead if you don't.\"I was close to tears. Not because of their dilemma, but because I felt somethingstirring inside me. It was something that had been edging its way out ever sincewe visited that town.La Gorda's pleading was heartbreaking. I then had another attack of what seemedto be hyperventilation. A cold sweat enveloped me and then I got sick to mystomach. La Gorda tended to me with absolute kindness. True to her practice of waiting before revealing a finding, la Gorda would notconsider discussing our seeing together in Oaxaca. For days she remained aloofand determinedly uninterested. She would not even discuss my getting ill.Neither would the other women.Don Juan used to stress the need for waiting for the most appropriate time tolet go of something that we hold. I understood the mechanics of la Gorda'sactions, although I found her insistence on waiting rather annoying and not inaccord with our needs. I could not stay with them too long, so I demanded thatall of us should get together and share everything we knew. She was inflexible.\"We have to wait,\" she said. \"We have to give our bodies a chance to come upwith a solution. Our task is the task of remembering, not with our minds butwith our bodies. Everybody understands it like that.\"She looked at me inquisitively. She seemed to be looking for a clue that wouldtell her that I too had understood the task. I admitted to being thoroughlymystified. Since I was the outsider, I was alone while they had one another forsupport.\"This is the silence of warriors,\" she said, laughing, and then added in aconciliatory tone, \"This silence doesn't mean that we can't talk about somethingelse.\"\"Maybe we should go back to our old discussion of losing the human form,\" Isaid.There was a look of annoyance in her eyes. I explained at length that,especially when foreign concepts were involved, meaning had to be continuallyclarified for me.\"What exactly do you want to know?\" she asked.\"Anything that you may want to tell me,\" I said.\"The Nagual told me that losing the human form brings freedom,\" she said. \"Ibelieve it. But I haven't felt that freedom, not yet.\"There was a moment of silence. She was obviously assessing my reaction.\"What kind of freedom is it, Gorda?\" I asked.\"The freedom to remember your self,\" she said. \"The Nagual said that losing thehuman form is like a spiral. It gives you the freedom to remember and this inturn makes you even freer.\"\"Why haven't you felt that freedom yet?\" I asked.She clicked her tongue, and shrugged her shoulders. She seemed confused orreluctant to go on with our conversation.\"I'm tied to you,\" she said. \"Until you lose your human form in order toremember, I won't be able to know what that freedom is. But perhaps you won't beable to lose your human form unless you remember first. We shouldn't be talkingabout this anyway. Why don't you go and talk to the Genaros?\"She sounded like a mother sending her child out to play, but I did not mind itin the least. From someone else I could easily have taken the same attitude asarrogance or contempt. I liked being with her. That was the difference. I found Pablito, Nestor, and Benigno in Genaro's house playing a strange game.Pablito was dangling about four feet above the ground inside something thatseemed to be a dark leather harness strapped to his chest under his armpits. Theharness resembled a thick leather vest.As I focused my attention on it, I noticed that Pablito was actually standing onsome thick straps that looped down from the harness like stirrups. He wassuspended in the center of the room by two ropes strung over a thick roundtransverse beam that supported the roof. Each rope was attached to the harnessitself, over Pablito's shoulders, by a metal ring.Nestor and Benigno each held a rope. They were standing, facing each other,holding Pablito in midair by the strength of their pull. Pablito was holding onwith all his strength to two long thin poles that were planted in the ground andfitted comfortably in his clasped hands. Nestor was to Pablito's left andBenigno to his right.The game seemed to be a three-sided tug-of-war; a ferocious battle between theones who were tugging and the one who was suspended.When I walked into the room, all I could hear was the heavy breathing of Nestorand Benigno. The muscles of their arms and necks were bulging with the strain ofpulling.Pablito kept an eye on both of them, focusing on each one, one at a time with asplit-second glance. All three were so absorbed in their game that they did noteven notice my presence, or if they did, they could not afford to break theirconcentration to greet me.Nestor and Benigno stared at each other for ten to fifteen minutes in totalsilence. Then Nestor faked letting his rope go. Benigno did not fall for it, butPablito did. Pablito tightened the grip of his left hand, and braced his feet onthe poles in order to strengthen his hold. Benigno used the moment to strike,and gave a mighty tug at the precise instant that Pablito eased his grip.Benigno's pull caught Pablito and Nestor by surprise. Benigno hung from the ropewith all his weight. Nestor was outmaneuvered. Pablito fought desperately tobalance himself. It was useless. Benigno won the round.Pablito got out of the harness, and came to where I was. I asked him about theirextraordinary game. He seemed somehow reluctant to talk. Nestor and Benignojoined us after putting their gear away. Nestor said that their game had beendesigned by Pablito, who found the structure in dreaming, and then constructedit as a game.At first it was a device for tensing the muscles of two of them at the sametime. They used to take turns at being hoisted. But then Benigno's dreaming gavethem the entry into a game where all three of them tensed their muscles andsharpened their visual prowess by remaining in a state of alertness; sometimesfor hours.\"Benigno thinks now that it is helping our bodies to remember,\" Nestor went on.\"La Gorda, for instance, plays it in a weird way. She wins every time, no matterwhat position she plays. Benigno thinks that's because her body remembers.\"I asked them if they also had the silence rule. They laughed. Pablito said thatla Gorda wanted more than anything else to be like the Nagual Juan Matus. Shedeliberately imitated him up to the most absurd detail.\"Do you mean we can talk about what happened the other night?\" I asked, almostbewildered, since la Gorda had been so emphatically against it.\"We don't care,\" Pablito said. \"You're the Nagual!\"\"Benigno here remembered something real, real weird,\" Nestor said withoutlooking at me.\"I think it was a mixed-up dream, myself,\" Benigno said, \"but Nestor thinks itwasn't.\"I waited impatiently. With a movement of my head, I urged them to go on.\"The other day he remembered you teaching him how to look for tracks in softdirt,\" Nestor said.\"It must have been a dream,\" I said.I wanted to laugh at the absurdity, but all three of them looked at me withpleading eyes.\"It's absurd,\" I said.\"Anyway, I better tell you now that I have a similar recollection,\" Nestor said.\"You took me to some rocks and showed me how to hide. Mine was not a mixed-updream. I was awake. I was walking with Benigno one day, looking for plants, andsuddenly I remembered you teaching me. So I hid as you taught me, and scaredBenigno out of his wits.\"\"I taught you! How could that be? When?\" I asked.I was beginning to get nervous. They did not seem to be joking.\"When? That's the point,\" Nestor said. \"We can't figure out when. But Benignoand I know it was you.\"I felt heavy; oppressed. My breathing became difficult. I feared I was going toget ill again. I decided right then to tell them about what la Gorda and I had'seen' together. Talking about it relaxed me. At the end of my recounting I wasagain in control of myself.\"The Nagual Juan Matus left us a little bit open,\" Nestor said. \"All of us cansee a little. We see holes in people who have had children and also, from timeto time, we see a little glow in people. Since you don't see at all, it lookslike the Nagual left you completely closed so that you will open yourself fromwithin. Now you've helped la Gorda and she either sees from within or she'smerely riding on your back.\"I told them that what had happened in Oaxaca may have been a fluke.Pablito thought that we should go to Genaro's favorite rock and sit there withour heads together. The other two found his idea brilliant. I had no objections.Although we sat there for a long time, nothing happened. We did get veryrelaxed, however.While we were still sitting on the rock I told them about the two men la Gordahad believed to be don Juan and don Ge-naro. They slid down, and practicallydragged me back to la Gorda's house. Nestor was the most agitated. He was almostincoherent. All I got out of them was that they had been waiting for a sign ofthat nature.La Gorda was waiting for us at the door. She knew what I had told them.\"I just wanted to give my body time,\" she said before we had said anything. \"Ihave to be dead sure, which I am. It was the Nagual and Genaro.\"\"What's in those shacks?\" Nestor asked.\"They didn't go inside them,\" la Gorda said. \"They walked away toward the openfields; toward the east. In the direction of this town.\"She seemed bent on appeasing them. She asked them to stay. They did not want to.They excused themselves and left. I was sure that they felt ill at ease in herpresence.She seemed to be very angry. I rather enjoyed her explosions of temper, and thiswas quite contrary to my normal reactions. I had always felt edgy in thepresence of anyone who was upset, with the mysterious exception of la Gorda.During the early hours of the evening all of us congregated in la Gorda's room.All of them seemed preoccupied. They sat in silence, staring at the floor. LaGorda tried to start a conversation. She said that she had not been idle, thatshe had put two and two together, and had come up with some solutions.\"This is not a matter of putting two and two together,\" Nestor said. \"This is atask of remembering with the body.\"It seemed that they had talked about it among themselves, judging by the nods ofagreement Nestor had from the others. That left la Gorda and myself as theoutsiders.\"Lydia also remembers something,\" Nestor went on. \"She thought it was herstupidity, but upon hearing what I've remembered she told us that this Nagualhere took her to a curer, and left her there to have her eyes cured.\"La Gorda and I turned to Lydia. She lowered her head as if embarrassed. Shemumbled. The memory seemed too painful for her. She said that when don Juanfirst found her, her eyes were infected and she could not see. Someone drove herin a car over a great distance to the curer who healed her.She had always been convinced that don Juan had done that, but upon hearing myvoice she realized that it was I who had taken her there. The incongruity ofsuch a memory threw her into agony from the first day she met me.\"My ears don't lie to me,\" Lydia added after a long silence. \"It was you whotook me there.\"\"Impossible! Impossible!\" I yelled.My body began to shake, out of control. I had a sense of duality. Perhaps what Icall my rational self, incapable of controlling the rest of me, took the seat ofa spectator. Some part of me was watching as another part of me shook.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"4. Crossing the Boundaries of Affection \"What's happening to us, Gorda?\" I asked after the others had gone home.\"Our bodies are remembering, but I just can't figure out what,\" she said.\"Do you believe the memories of Lydia, Nestor, and Benigno?\"\"Sure. They're very serious people. They don't just say things like that for thehell of it.\"\"But what they say is impossible. You believe me, don't you, Gorda?\"\"I believe that you don't remember, but then...\"She did not finish. She came to my side and began to whisper in my ear. She saidthat there was something that the Nagual Juan Matus had made her promise to keepto herself until the time was right; a trump card to be used only when there wasno other way out.She added in a dramatic whisper that the Nagual had foreseen their new livingarrangement, which was the result of my taking Josefina to Tula to be withPablito. She said that there was a faint chance that we might succeed as a groupif we followed the natural order of that organization. La Gorda explained thatsince we were divided into couples, we formed a living organism. We were asnake; a rattlesnake.The snake had four sections and was divided, into two longitudinal halves, maleand female. She said that she and I made up the first section of the snake, thehead. It was a cold, calculating, poisonous head. The second section, formed byNestor and Lydia, was the firm and fair heart of the snake. The third was thebelly-a shifty, moody, untrustworthy belly made up by Pablito and Josefina. Andthe fourth section, the tail, where the rattle was located, was formed by thecouple who in real life could rattle on in their Tzotzil language for hours onend, Benigno and Rosa.La Gorda straightened herself up from the position she had adopted to whisper inmy ear. She smiled at me, and patted me on the back.\"Eligio said one word that finally came back to me,\" she went on. \"Josefinaagrees with me that he said the word \"trail\" over and over. We are going to goon a trail!\"Without giving me a chance to ask her any questions, she said that she was goingto sleep for a while, and then assemble everyone to go on a trip.We started out before midnight, hiking in bright moonlight. Everyone of theothers had been reluctant to go at first, but la Gorda very skillfully sketchedout for them don Juan's alleged description of the snake.Before we started, Lydia suggested that we provide ourselves with supplies incase the trip turned out to be a long one. La Gorda dismissed her suggestion onthe grounds that we had no idea about the nature of the trip. She said that theNagual Juan Matus had once pointed out to her the beginning of a pathway, andsaid that at the right opportunity we should place ourselves on that spot andlet the power of the trail reveal itself to us. La Gorda added that it was notan ordinary goats' path but a natural line on the earth which the Nagual hadsaid would give us strength and knowledge if we could follow it and become onewith it.We moved under mixed leadership. La Gorda supplied the impetus and Nestor knewthe actual terrain. She led us to a place in the mountains. Nestor took overthen and located a pathway. Our formation was evident, the head taking the leadand the others arranging themselves according to the anatomical model of asnake: heart, intestines, and tail. The men were to the right of the women. Eachcouple was five feet behind the one in front of them.We hiked as quickly and as quietly as we could. There were dogs barking for atime. As we got higher into the mountains there was only the sound of crickets.We walked for a long while.All of a sudden la Gorda stopped and grabbed my arm. She pointed ahead of us.Twenty or thirty yards away, right in the middle of the trail, there was thebulky silhouette of an enormous man over seven feet tall. He was blocking ourway. We grouped together in a tight bunch. Our eyes were fixed on the darkshape. He did not move. After a while, Nestor alone advanced a few steps towardhim. Only then did the figure move. He came toward us. Gigantic as he was, hemoved nimbly.Nestor came back running. The moment he joined us, the man stopped. Boldly, laGorda took a step toward him. The man took a step toward us. It was evident thatif we kept on moving forward, we were going to clash with the giant. We were nomatch for whatever it was. Without waiting to prove it, I took the initiativeand pulled everyone back and quickly steered them away from that place.We walked back to la Gorda's house in total silence. It took us hours to getthere. We were utterly exhausted. When we were safely sitting in her room, laGorda spoke.\"We are doomed,\" she said to me. \"You didn't want us to move on. That thing wesaw on the trail was one of your allies, wasn't it? They come out of theirhiding place when you pull them out.\"I did not answer. There was no point in protesting. I remembered the countlesstimes I had believed that don Juan and don Genaro were in cahoots with eachother. I thought that while don Juan talked to me in the darkness, don Genarowould put on a disguise in order to scare me. Don Juan would insist that it wasan ally.The idea that there were allies or entities at large that escape our everydayattention had been too farfetched for me. But then I had lived to find out thatthe allies of don Juan's description existed in fact. There were, as he hadsaid, entities at large in the world.In an authoritarian outburst, rare to me in my everyday life, I stood up andtold la Gorda and the rest of them that I had a proposition for them and theycould take it or leave it. If they were ready to move out of there, I waswilling to take the responsibility of taking them somewhere else. If they werenot ready, I would feel exonerated [* exonerated- freed from any question ofguilt] from any further commitment to them.I felt a surge of optimism and certainty. None of them said anything. Theylooked at me silently, as if they were internally assessing my statements.\"How long would it take you to get your gear?\" I asked.\"We have no gear,\" la Gorda said. \"We'll go as we are. And we can go right thisminute if it is necessary. But if we can wait three more days, everything willbe better for us.\"\"What about the houses that you have?\" I asked.\"Soledad will take care of that,\" she said.That was the first time dona Soledad's name had been mentioned since I last sawher. I was so intrigued that I momentarily forgot the drama of the moment. I satdown.La Gorda was hesitant to answer my questions about dona Soledad. Nestor tookover and said that dona Soledad was around but that none of them knew much abouther activities. She came and went without giving anyone notice; the agreementbetween them being that they would look after her house and vice versa. DonaSoledad knew that they had to leave sooner or later, and she would assume theresponsibility of doing whatever was necessary to dispose of their property.\"How will you let her know?\" I asked.\"That's la Gorda's department,\" Nestor said. \"We don't know where she is.\"\"Where is dona Soledad, Gorda?\" I asked.\"How in the hell would I know?\" la Gorda snapped at me.\"But you're the one who calls her,\" Nestor said.La Gorda looked at me. It was a casual look, yet it gave me a shiver. Irecognized that look, but from where? The depths of my body stirred. My solarplexus had a solidity I had never felt before. My diaphragm seemed to be pushingup on its own. I was pondering whether I should lie down when suddenly I foundmyself standing.\"La Gorda doesn't know,\" I said. \"Only I know where she is.\"Everyone was shocked- I perhaps more than anyone else. I had made the statementwith no rational foundation whatsoever. At the moment I was voicing it,nevertheless, I had had the perfect conviction that I knew where she was. It waslike a flash that crossed my consciousness. I saw a mountainous area with veryrugged, arid peaks; a scraggy terrain, desolate and cold.As soon as I had spoken, my next conscious thought was that I must have seenthat landscape in a movie and that the pressure of being with these people wascausing me to have a breakdown.I apologized to them for mystifying them in such a blatant althoughunintentional manner. I sat down again.\"You mean you don't know why you said that?\" Nestor asked me.He had chosen his words carefully. The natural thing to say, at least for me,would have been, \"So you really don't know where she is.\" I told them thatsomething unknown had come upon me. I described the terrain I had seen, and thecertainty I had had that dona Soledad was there.\"That happens to us quite often,\" Nestor said.I turned to la Gorda and she nodded her head. I asked for an explanation.\"These crazy mixed-up things keep coming to our minds,\" la Gorda said. \"AskLydia, or Rosa, or Josefina.\"Since they had entered into their new living arrangement Lydia, Rosa, andJosefina had not said much to me. They had confined themselves to greetings andcasual comments about food or the weather.Lydia avoided my eyes. She mumbled that she thought at times that she rememberedother things.\"Sometimes I can really hate you,\" she said to me. \"I think you are pretendingto be stupid. Then I remember that you were very ill because of us. Was it you?\"\"Of course it was him,\" Rosa said. \"I too remember things. I remember a lady whowas kind to me. She taught me how to keep myself clean, and this Nagual cut myhair for the first time while the lady held me because I was scared. That ladyloved me. She hugged me all the time. She was very tall. I remember my face wason her bosom when she used to hug me. She was the only person who ever cared forme. I would've gladly gone to my death for her.\"\"Who was that lady, Rosa?\" la Gorda asked with bated breath.Rosa pointed to me with a movement of her chin, a gesture heavy with dejectionand contempt.\"He knows,\" she said.All of them stared at me, waiting for an answer. I became angry and yelled atRosa that she had no business making statements that were really accusations. Iwas not in any way lying to them.Rosa was not flustered by my outburst. She calmly explained that she rememberedthe lady telling her that I would come back some day, after I had recovered frommy illness. Rosa understood that the lady was taking care of me; nursing me backto health. Therefore, I had to know who she was and where she was since I seemedto have recovered.\"What kind of illness did I have, Rosa?\" I asked.\"You got ill because you couldn't hold your world,\" she said with utterconviction. \"Someone told me, I think a very long time ago, that you were notmade for us, just like Eligio told la Gorda in dreaming. You left us because ofit and Lydia never forgave you. She'll hate you beyond this world.\"Lydia protested that her feelings for me had nothing to do with what Rosa wassaying. She was merely short-tempered and easily got angry at my stupidities.I asked Josefina if she also remembered me.\"I sure do,\" she said with a grin. \"But you know me, I'm crazy. You can't trustme. I'm not dependable.\"La Gorda insisted on hearing what Josefina remembered. Josefina was set not tosay anything and they argued back and forth. Finally Josefina spoke to me.\"What's the use of all this talk about remembering? It's just talk,\" she said.\"And it isn't worth a fig.\"Josefina seemed to have scored a point with all of us. There was no more to besaid. They were getting up to leave after having sat in polite silence for a fewminutes.\"I remember you bought me beautiful clothes,\" Josefina suddenly said to me.\"Don't you remember when I fell down the stairs in one store? I nearly broke myleg and you had to carry me out.\"Everybody sat down again and kept their eyes fixed on Josefina.\"I also remember a crazy woman,\" she went on. \"She wanted to beat me and used tochase me all over the place until you got angry and stopped her.\"I felt exasperated. Everyone seemed to be hanging on Josefina's words when sheherself had told us not to trust her because she was crazy. She was right. Herremembering was sheer aberration [* aberration- condition markedly differentfrom the norm] to me.\"I know why you got ill, too,\" she went on. \"I was there. But I can't rememberwhere. They took you beyond that wall of fog to find this stupid Gorda. Isuppose she must have gotten lost. You couldn't make it back. When they broughtyou out you were almost dead.\"The silence that followed her revelations was oppressive. I was afraid to askanything.\"I can't remember why on earth she went in there, or who brought you back,\"Josefina continued. \"I do remember that you were ill, and didn't recognize meany more. This stupid Gorda swears that she didn't know you when you first cameto this house a few months ago. I knew you right away. I remembered you were theNagual that got ill. You want to know something? I think these women are justindulging. And so are the men, especially that stupid Pablito. They've got toremember, they were there, too.\"\"Can you remember where we were?\" I asked.\"No. I can't,\" Josefina said. \"I'll know it if you take me there, though. Whenwe all were there, they used to call us the drunkards because we were groggy. Iwas the least dizzy of all, so I remember pretty well.\"\"Who called us drunkards?\" I asked.\"Not you, just us,\" Josefina replied. \"I don't know who. The Nagual Juan Matus,I suppose.\"I looked at them and each one of them avoided my eyes.\"We are coming to the end,\" Nestor muttered, as if talking to himself. \"Ourending is staring us in the eye.\"He seemed to be on the verge of tears.\"I should be glad and proud that we have arrived at the end,\" he went on. \"YetI'm sad. Can you explain that, Nagual?\"Suddenly all of them were sad. Even defiant Lydia was sad.\"What's wrong with all of you?\" I asked in a convivial tone. \"What ending areyou talking about?\"\"I think everyone knows what ending it is,\" Nestor said. \"Lately, I've beenhaving strange feelings. Something is calling us. And we don't let go as weshould. We cling.\"Pablito had a true moment of gallantry and said that la Gorda was the only oneamong them who did not cling to anything. The rest of them, he assured me, werenearly hopeless egotists.\"The Nagual Juan Matus said that when it's time to go, we will have a sign,\"Nestor said. \"Something we truly like will come forth and take us.\"\"He said it doesn't have to be something great,\" Benigno added. \"Anything welike will do.\"\"For me the sign will come in the form of the lead soldiers I never had,\" Nestorsaid to me. \"A row of Hussars on horseback will come to take me. What will it befor you?\" I remembered don Juan telling me once that death might be behind anythingimaginable, even behind a dot on my writing pad. He gave me then the definitivemetaphor of my death.I had told him that once while walking on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles Ihad heard the sound of a trumpet playing an old, idiotic popular tune. The musicwas coming from a record shop across the street.Never had I heard a more beautiful sound. I became enraptured by it. I had tosit down on the curb. The limpid brass sound of that trumpet was going directlyto my brain. I felt it just above my right temple. It soothed me until I wasdrunk with it.When it concluded, I knew that there would be no way of ever repeating thatexperience, and I had enough detachment not to rush into the store and buy therecord and a stereo set to play it on.Don Juan said that it had been a sign given to me by the powers that rule thedestiny of men. When the time comes for me to leave the world, in whatever form,I will hear the same sound of that trumpet, the same idiotic tune, the samepeerless trumpeter. The next day was a frantic day for them. They seemed to have endless things todo. La Gorda said that all their chores were personal and had to be performed byeach one of them without any help.I welcomed being alone. I too had things to work out. I drove to the nearby townthat had disturbed me so thoroughly. I went directly to the house that had heldsuch fascination for la Gorda and me.I knocked on the door. A lady answered. I made up a story that I had lived inthat house as a child, and wanted to look at it again. She was a very graciouswoman. She let me go through the house, apologizing profusely for a nonexistentdisorder.There was a wealth of hidden memories in that house. They were there, and Icould feel them, but I could not remember anything.The following day la Gorda left at dawn. I expected her to be gone all day butshe came back at noon. She seemed very upset.\"Soledad has come back and wants to see you,\" she said flatly.Without any word of explanation, she took me to dona Soledad's house. DonaSoledad was standing by the door. She looked younger and stronger than the lasttime I had seen her. She bore only the slightest resemblance to the lady I hadknown years before.La Gorda seemed to be on the verge of crying. The tension we were going throughmade her mood perfectly understandable to me. She left without saying a word.Dona Soledad said that she had only a little time to talk to me and that she wasgoing to use every minute of it. She was strangely deferential. [* deferential-showing courteous regard for people's feelings] There was a tone of politenessin every word she said.I made a gesture to interrupt her to ask a question. I wanted to know where shehad been. She rebuffed me in a most delicate manner. She said that she hadchosen her words carefully and that the lack of time would permit her only tosay what was essential.She peered into my eyes for a moment that seemed unnaturally long. That annoyedme. She could have talked to me and answered some questions in the same lengthof time. She broke her silence and spoke what I thought were absurdities. Shesaid that she had attacked me as I had requested her to, the day we crossed theparallel lines for the first time, and that she only hoped her attack had beeneffective and served its purpose.I wanted to shout that I had never asked her to do anything of the sort. I didnot know about parallel lines and what she was saying was nonsense. She pressedmy lips with her hand. I recoiled automatically. She seemed sad. She said thatthere was no way for us to talk because at that moment we were on two parallellines and neither of us had the energy to cross over. Only her eyes could tellme her mood.For no reason, I began to feel relaxed. Something inside me felt at ease. Inoticed that tears were rolling down my cheeks. And then a most incrediblesensation took possession of me for a moment; a short moment, but long enough tojolt the foundations of my consciousness, or of my person, or of what I thinkand feel is myself.During that brief moment I knew that we were very close to each other in purposeand temperament. Our circumstances were alike. I wanted to acknowledge to herthat it had been an arduous struggle, but the struggle was not over yet. Itwould never be over. She was saying goodbye because being the impeccable warriorshe was, she knew that our paths would never cross again. We had come to the endof a trail.A lost wave of affiliation, of kinship, burst out from some unimaginable darkcorner of myself. That flash was like an electric charge in my body. I embracedher. My mouth was moving, saying things that had no meaning to me. Her eyes litup. She was also saying something I could not understand. The only sensationthat was clear to me, that I had crossed the parallel lines, had no pragmaticsignificance. There was a welled-up anguish inside me pushing outward. Someinexplicable force was splitting me apart. I could not breathe and everythingwent black.I felt someone moving me, shaking me gently. La Gorda's face came into focus. Iwas lying in dona Soledad's bed and la Gorda was sitting by my side. We werealone.\"Where is she?\" I asked.\"She's gone,\" la Gorda replied.I wanted to tell la Gorda everything. She stopped me. She opened the door. Allthe apprentices were outside waiting for me. They had put on their raunchiestclothes. La Gorda explained that they had torn up everything they had. It waslate afternoon. I had been asleep for hours. Without talking, we walked to laGorda's house, where I had my car parked. They crammed inside like childrengoing on a Sunday drive.Before I got into the car, I stood gazing at the valley. My body rotated slowlyand made a complete circle, as if it had a volition and purpose of its own. Ifelt I was capturing the essence of that place. I wanted to keep it with mebecause I knew unequivocally that never in this life would I see it again.The others must have done that already. They were free of melancholy. They werelaughing; teasing one another.I started the car and drove away. When we reached the last bend in the road thesun was setting, and la Gorda yelled at me to stop. She got out and ran to asmall hill at the side of the road. She climbed it and took a last look at hervalley. She extended her arms toward it and breathed it in.The ride down those mountains was strangely short and thoroughly uneventful.Everybody was quiet. I tried to get la Gorda into a conversation, but she flatlyrefused. She said that the mountains, being possessive, claimed ownership ofthem, and that if they did not save their energy, the mountains would never letthem go.Once we got to the lowlands they became more animated, especially la Gorda. Sheseemed to be bubbling with energy. She even volunteered information without anycoaxing on my part. One of her statements was that the Nagual Juan Matus hadtold her, and Soledad had confirmed, that there was another side to us. Uponhearing it, the rest of them joined in with questions and comments. They werebaffled by their strange memories of events that could not logically have takenplace. Since some of them had first met me only months before, remembering me inthe remote past was something beyond the bounds of their reason.I told them then about my meeting with dona Soledad. I described my feeling ofhaving known her intimately before, and my sense of having unmistakably crossedwhat she called the parallel lines. They reacted with confusion to my statement.It seemed that they had heard the term before but I was not sure they allunderstood what it meant. For me it was a metaphor. I could not vouch that itwas the same for them.When we were coming into the city of Oaxaca, they expressed the desire to visitthe place where la Gorda had said don Juan and don Genaro disappeared. I drovedirectly to the spot. They rushed out of the car and seemed to be orientingthemselves, sniffing at something, looking for clues. La Gorda pointed in thedirection she thought they had gone.\"You've made a terrible mistake, Gorda,\" Nestor said loudly. \"That's not theeast, that's the north.\"La Gorda protested and defended her opinion. The women backed her, and so didPablito. Benigno was noncommittal. He kept on looking at me as if I were goingto furnish the answer, which I did. I referred to a map of the city of Oaxacathat I had in the car. The direction la Gorda was pointing was indeed north.Nestor remarked that he had felt all along that their departure from their townwas not premature or forced in any way. The timing was right. The others hadnot, and their hesitation arose from la Gorda's misjudgment. They had believed,as she herself had, that the Nagual had pointed toward their hometown, meaningthat they had to stay put. I admitted, as an afterthought, that in the finalanalysis I was the one to blame because, although I had had the map, I hadfailed to use it at the time.I then mentioned that I had forgotten to tell them that one of the men, the oneI had thought for a moment was don Genaro, had beckoned us with a movement ofhis head. La Gorda's eyes widened with genuine surprise, or even alarm. She hadnot detected the gesture, she said. The beckoning had been only for me.\"That's it!\" Nestor exclaimed. \"Our fates are sealed!\"He turned to address the others. All of them were talking at once. He madefrantic gestures with his hands to calm them.\"I only hope that all of you did whatever you had to do as if you were nevercoming back,\" he said. \"Because we are never going back.\"\"Are you telling us the truth?\" Lydia asked me with a fierce look in her eyes,as the others peered expectantly at me.I assured them that I had no reason to make it up. The fact that I saw that mangesturing to me with his head had no significance whatsoever for me. Besides, Iwas not even convinced that those men were don Juan and don Genaro.\"You're very crafty,\" Lydia said. \"You may just be telling us this so that wewill follow you meekly.\"\"Now, wait a minute,\" la Gorda said. \"This Nagual may be as crafty as you like,but he'd never do anything like that.\"They all began talking at once. I tried to mediate and had to shout over theirvoices that what I had seen did not make any difference anyway.Nestor very politely explained that Genaro had told them that when the time camefor them to leave their valley he would somehow let them know with a movement ofhis head. They quieted down when I said that if their fates were sealed by thatevent, so was mine. All of us were going north.Nestor then led us to a place of lodging, a boardinghouse where he stayed whendoing business in the city. Their spirits were high, in fact too high for mycomfort. Even Lydia embraced me, apologizing for being so difficult. Sheexplained that she had believed la Gorda and therefore had not bothered to cuther ties effectively. Josefina and Rosa were ebullient [* ebullient- joyouslyunrestrained] and patted me on the back over and over. I wanted to talk with laGorda. I needed to discuss our course of action. But there was no way to bealone with her that night.Nestor, Pablito, and Benigno left in the early morning to do some errands.Lydia, Rosa, and Josefina also went out to go shopping. La Gorda requested thatI help her buy her new clothes. She wanted me to pick out one dress for her, theperfect one to give her the self-confidence she needed to be a fluid warrior. Inot only found a dress but an entire outfit, shoes, nylons, and lingerie.I took her for a stroll. We meandered in the center of town like two tourists,staring at the Indians in their regional garments. Being a formless warrior, shewas already perfectly at ease in her elegant outfit. She looked ravishing. Itwas as if she had never dressed any other way. It was I who could not get usedto it.The questions that I wanted to ask la Gorda, which should have poured out of me,were impossible to formulate. I had no idea what to ask her. I told her in trueseriousness that her new appearance was affecting me. Very soberly, she saidthat the crossing of boundaries was what had affected me.\"We crossed some boundaries last night,\" she said. \"Soledad told me what toexpect, so I was prepared. But you were not.\"She began to explain softly and slowly that we had crossed some boundaries ofaffection the night before. She was enunciating every syllable as if she weretalking to a child or a foreigner. But I could not concentrate. We went back toour lodgings. I needed to rest, yet I ended up going out again. Lydia, Rosa, andJosefina had not been able to find anything and wanted something like la Gorda'soutfit.By midafternoon I was back in the boardinghouse admiring the little sisters.Rosa had difficulty walking with high-heeled shoes. We were joking about herfeet when the door opened slowly and Nestor made a dramatic entrance. He waswearing a tailored dark-blue suit, light-pink shirt, and blue necktie. His hairwas neatly combed and a bit fluffy, as if it had been blown dry. He looked atthe women and the women looked at him. Pablito came in, followed by Benigno.Both were dashing. Their shoes were brand new and their suits looked custommade.I could not get over everyone's adaptation to city clothes. They reminded me somuch of don Juan. I was perhaps as shocked seeing the three Genaros in cityclothes as I had been when I saw don Juan wearing a suit, yet I accepted theirchange instantly. On the other hand, while I was not surprised at the women'stransformation, for some reason I could not get accustomed to it.I thought that the Genaros must have had a streak of sorcerers' luck in order tofind such perfect fits. They laughed when they heard me raving about their luck.Nestor said that a tailor had made their suits months before.\"We each have another suit,\" he said to me. \"We even have leather suitcases. Weknew our time in these mountains was up. We are ready to go! Of course, youfirst have to tell us where. And also how long we are going to stay here.\"He explained that he had old business accounts he had to close and needed time.La Gorda stepped in and with great certainty and authority stated that thatnight we were going to go as far away as power permitted. Consequently they haduntil the end of the day to settle their business. Nestor and Pablito hesitatedby the door. They looked at me, waiting for confirmation. I thought the least Icould do was to be honest with them, but la Gorda interrupted me just as I wasabout to say that I was in limbo as to what exactly we were going to do.\"We will meet at the Nagual's bench at dusk,\" she said. \"We'll leave from there.We should do whatever we have to or want to until then, knowing that never againin this life will we be back.\"La Gorda and I were alone after everybody left. In an abrupt and clumsymovement, she sat on my lap. She was so light I could make her thin body shakeby contracting the muscles of my calves. Her hair had a peculiar perfume. Ijoked that the smell was unbearable.She was laughing and shaking when out of nowhere a feeling came to me -a memory?All of a sudden I had another Gorda on my lap, fat, twice the size of the GordaI knew. Her face was round and I was teasing her about the perfume in her hair.I had the sensation that I was taking care of her.The impact of that spurious [* spurious- plausible but false] memory made mestand up. La Gorda fell noisily to the floor. I described what I had'remembered'. I told her that I had seen her as a fat woman only once, and sobriefly that I had no idea of her features, and yet I had just had a vision ofher face when she was fat.She did not make any comments. She took off her clothes and put on her old dressagain.\"I am not yet ready for it,\" she said, pointing at her new outfit. \"We stillhave one more thing to do before we are free. According to the Nagual JuanMatus' instructions, all of us must sit together on a power spot of his choice.\"\"Where's that spot?\"\"Somewhere in the mountains around here. It's like a door. The Nagual told methat there was a natural crack on that spot. He said that certain power spotsare holes in this world. If you are formless you can go through one of thoseholes into the unknown; into another world. That world and this world we live inare on two parallel lines.Chances are that all of us have been taken across those lines at one time oranother, but we don't remember. Eligio is in that other world. Sometimes wereach it through dreaming. Josefina, of course, is the best dreamer among us.She crosses those lines every day, but being crazy makes her indifferent, evendumb, so Eligio helped me to cross those lines thinking I was more intelligent,and I turned out to be just as dumb.Eligio wants us to remember our left side. Soledad told me that the left side isthe parallel line to the one we are living in now. So if he wants us to rememberit, we must have been there. And not in dreaming, either. That's why all of usremember weird things now and then.\"Her conclusions were logical given the premises she was working with. I knewwhat she was talking about. Those occasional unsolicited memories reeked of thereality of everyday life and yet we could find no time sequence for them; noopening in the continuum of our lives where we could fit them.La Gorda reclined on the bed. There was a worried look in her eyes.\"What bothers me is what to do to find that power spot,\" she said. \"Without itthere is no possible journey for us.\"\"What worries me is where I'm going to take all of you and what I'm going to dowith you,\" I said.\"Soledad told me that we will go as far north as the border,\" la Gorda said.\"Some of us even further north perhaps. But you won't go all the way throughwith us. You have another fate.\"La Gorda was pensive [* pensive- persistently or morbidly thoughtfu] for amoment. She frowned with the apparent effort of arranging her thoughts.\"Soledad said that you will take me to fulfill my destiny,\" la Gorda said. \"I amthe only one of us who is in your charge.\"Alarm must have been written all over my face. She smiled.\"Soledad also told me that you are plugged up,\" la Gorda went on. \"You havemoments, though, when you are a Nagual. The rest of the time, Soledad says, youare like a crazy man who is lucid [* lucid- transparently clear in language]only for a few moments, and then reverts back to his madness.\"Dona Soledad had used an appropriate image to describe me; one I couldunderstand. I must have had a moment of lucidity for her when I knew I hadcrossed the parallel lines. That same moment, by my standards, was the mostincongruous of all. Dona Soledad and I were certainly on two different lines ofthought.\"What else did she tell you?\" I asked.\"She told me I should force myself to remember,\" la Gorda said. \"She exhaustedherself trying to bring out my memory. That was why she couldn't deal with you.\"La Gorda got up. She was ready to leave. I took her for a walk around the city.She seemed very happy. She went from place to place watching everything;feasting her eyes on the world.Don Juan had given me that image. He had said that a warrior knows that he iswaiting, and knows also what he is waiting for; and while he waits, he feastshis eyes on the world. For him the ultimate accomplishment of a warrior was joy.That day in Oaxaca la Gorda was following don Juan's teachings to the letter.In the late afternoon before dusk, we sat down on don Juan's bench. Benigno,Pablito, and Josefina showed up first. After a few minutes the other threejoined us. Pablito sat down between Josefina and Lydia and put his arms aroundthem. They had changed back into their old clothes. La Gorda stood up and beganto tell them about the power spot.Nestor laughed at her and the rest of them joined him.\"Never again will you get us to fall for your bossiness,\" Nestor said. \"We arefree of you. We crossed the boundaries last night.\"La Gorda was unruffled but the others were angry. I had to intervene. I saidloudly that I wanted to know more about the boundaries we had crossed the nightbefore. Nestor explained that that pertained only to them. La Gorda disagreed.They seemed to be on the verge of fighting. I pulled Nestor to the side andordered him to tell me about the boundaries.\"Our feelings make boundaries around anything,\" he said. \"The more we love, thestronger the boundary is. In this case we loved our home. Before we left it, wehad to lift up our feelings. Our feelings for our home went up to the top of themountains to the west from our valley. That was the boundary and when we crossedthe top of those mountains, knowing that we'll never be back, we broke it.\"\"But I also knew that I'd never be back,\" I said.\"You didn't love those mountains the way we did,\" Nestor replied.\"That remains to be seen,\" la Gorda said cryptically.\"We were under her influence,\" Pablito said, standing up and pointing to laGorda. \"She had us by the napes of our necks. Now I see how stupid we've been onaccount of her. We can't cry over spilled milk, but we'll never fall for itagain.\"Lydia and Josefina joined Nestor and Pablito. Benigno and Rosa looked on as ifthe struggle did not concern them any more.I had right then another moment of certainty and authoritarian behavior. I stoodup, and without any conscious volition announced that I was taking charge, andthat I relieved la Gorda of any further obligation to make comments or topresent her ideas as the only solution. When I finished talking, I was shockedat my boldness. Everyone including la Gorda was delighted.The force behind my explosion had been first a physical sensation that mysinuses were opening, and second the certainty that I knew what don Juan hadmeant, and exactly where the place was that we had to visit before we could befree. As my sinuses opened, I had had a vision of the house that had intriguedme.I told them where we had to go. They accepted my directions without anyarguments or even comments. We checked out of the boardinghouse and went to eatdinner. Afterward we strolled around the plaza until about eleven o'clock. Ibrought the car around, they piled noisily inside, and we were off. La Gordaremained awake to keep me company while the rest of them went to sleep, and thenNestor drove while la Gorda and I slept. ======================================================="},{"pageContent":"5. A Horde of Angry Sorcerers We were in the town at the crack of dawn. At that point I took the wheel anddrove toward the house. A couple of blocks before we got there, la Gorda askedme to stop. She got out of the car and began to walk on the high sidewalk. Oneby one, all of them got out. They followed la Gorda. Pablito came to my side andsaid that I should park on the plaza which was a block away. I did that.The moment I saw la Gorda turning the corner I knew that something was wrongwith her. She was extraordinarily pale. She came to me and said in a whisperthat she was going to go to hear early mass. Lydia also wanted to do that. Bothof them walked across the plaza and went inside the church.Pablito, Nestor, and Benigno were as somber as I had ever seen them. Rosa wasfrightened; her mouth open; her eyes fixed, unblinking, looking in the directionof the house. Only Josefina was beaming. She gave me a buddy-buddy slap on theback.\"You've done it, you son of a gun!\" she exclaimed. \"You've knocked the tar outof these sons of bitches.\"She laughed until she was nearly out of breath.\"Is this the place, Josefina?\" I asked.\"It surely is,\" she said. \"La Gorda used to go to church all the time. She was areal churchgoer at that time.\"\"Do you remember that house over there?\" I asked, pointing to it.\"That's Silvio Manuel's house,\" she said.All of us jumped upon hearing the name. I felt something similar to a mild shockof electric current going through my knees. The name was definitely not familiarto me, yet my body jumped upon hearing it. Silvio Manuel was such a rare name;so liquid a sound.The three Genaros and Rosa were as perturbed as I was. I noticed that they werepale. Judging by what I felt, I must have been just as pale as they were.\"Who is Silvio Manuel?\" I finally managed to ask Josefina.\"Now you got me,\" she said. \"I don't know.\"She reiterated that she was crazy and nothing that she said should be takenseriously. Nestor begged her to tell us whatever she remembered.Josefina tried to think but she was not the person to perform well underpressure. I knew that she would do better if no one asked her. I proposed thatwe look for a bakery or a place to eat.\"They didn't let me do much in that house, that's what I remember,\" Josefinasaid all of a sudden.She turned around as if looking for something, or as if she were orientingherself.\"Something is missing here!\" she exclaimed. \"This is not quite the way it usedto be.\"I attempted to help her by asking questions that I deemed appropriate, such aswhether houses were missing or had been painted, or new ones built. But Josefinacould not figure out how it was different.We walked to the bakery and bought sweet rolls. As we were heading back to theplaza to wait for la Gorda and Lydia, Josefina suddenly hit her forehead as ifan idea had just struck her.\"I know what's missing!\" she shouted. \"That stupid wall of fog! It used to behere then. It's gone now.\"All of us spoke at once, asking her about the wall, but Josefina went on talkingundisturbed, as if we were not there.\"It was a wall of fog that went all the way up to the sky,\" she said. \"It wasright here. Every time I turned my head, there it was. It drove me crazy. That'sright, darn it. I wasn't nuts until I was driven crazy by that wall. I saw itwith my eyes closed or with my eyes open. I thought that wall was after me.\"For a moment Josefina lost her natural vivaciousness. A desperate look appearedin her eyes. I had seen that look in people who were going through a psychoticepisode. I hurriedly suggested that she eat her sweet roll. She calmed downimmediately and began to eat it.\"What do you think of all this, Nestor?\" I asked.\"I'm scared,\" he said softly.\"Do you remember anything?\" I asked him.He shook his head negatively. I questioned Pablito and Benigno with a movementof my brows. They also shook their heads to say no.\"How about you, Rosa?\" I asked.Rosa jumped when she heard me addressing her. She seemed to have lost herspeech. She held a sweet roll in her hand and stared at it, seemingly undecidedas to what to do with it.\"Of course she remembers,\" Josefina said, laughing, \"but she's frightened todeath. Can't you see that piss is even coming out her ears?\"Josefina seemed to think her statement was the ultimate joke. She doubled uplaughing and dropped her roll on the ground. She picked it up, dusted it off,and ate it.\"Crazy people eat anything,\" she said, slapping me on the back.Nestor and Benigno seemed uncomfortable with Josefina's antics. Pablito wasdelighted. There was a look of admiration in his eyes. He shook his head andclicked his tongue as if he could not believe such grace.\"Let's go to the house,\" Josefina urged us. \"I'll tell you all kinds of thingsthere.\"I said that we should wait for la Gorda and Lydia. Besides, it was still tooearly to bother the charming lady who lived there. Pablito said that in thecourse of his carpentry business he had been in the town and knew a house wherea family prepared food for transient [* transient- one who stays for only ashort time] people. Josefina did not want to wait. For her, it was either goingto the house or going to eat. I opted for having breakfast, and told Rosa to gointo the church to get la Gorda and Lydia; but Benigno gallantly volunteered towait for them and take them to the breakfast place. Apparently he too knew wherethe place was.Pablito did not take us directly there. Instead, at my request, we made a longdetour. There was an old bridge at the edge of town that I wanted to examine. Ihad seen it from my car the day I had come with la Gorda. Its structure seemedto be colonial. We went out on the bridge and then stopped abruptly in themiddle of it. I asked a man who was standing there if the bridge was very old.He said that he had seen it all his life and he was over fifty.I thought that the bridge held a unique fascination for me alone, but watchingthe others, I had to conclude that they too had been affected by it. Nestor andRosa were panting; out of breath. Pablito was holding on to Josefina; she inturn was holding on to me.\"Do you remember anything, Josefina?\" I asked.\"That devil Silvio Manuel is on the other side of this bridge,\" she said,pointing to the other end, some thirty feet away.I looked Rosa in the eyes. She nodded her head affirmatively and whispered thatshe had once crossed that bridge in great fear and that something had beenwaiting to devour her at the other end.The two men were no help. They looked at me, bewildered. Each said that he wasafraid for no reason. I had to agree with them. I felt I would not dare crossthat bridge at night for all the money in the world. I did not know why.\"What else do you remember, Josefina?\" I asked.\"My body is very frightened now,\" she said. \"I can't remember anything else.That devil Silvio Manuel is always in the darkness. Ask Rosa.\"With a movement of my head, I invited Rosa to talk. She nodded affirmativelythree or four times but could not vocalize her words. The tension I myself wasexperiencing was uncalled for, yet real. All of us were standing on that bridge,midway across, incapable of taking one more step in the direction Josefina hadpointed.At last Josefina took the initiative and turned around. We walked back to thecenter of town. Pablito guided us then to a large house. La Gorda, Lydia, andBenigno were already eating. They had even ordered food for us. I was nothungry. Pablito, Nestor, and Rosa were in a daze. Josefina ate heartily. Therewas an ominous silence at the table. Everybody avoided my eyes when I tried tostart a conversation.After breakfast we walked to the house. No one said a word. I knocked and whenthe lady came out I explained to her that I wanted to show her house to myfriends. She hesitated for a moment. La Gorda gave her some money and apologizedfor inconveniencing her.Josefina led us directly to the back. I had not seen that part of the house whenI was there before. There was a cobbled courtyard with rooms arranged around it.Bulky farming equipment was stored away in the roofed corridors.I had the feeling I had seen that courtyard when there was no clutter in it.There were eight rooms, two on each of the four sides of the courtyard. Nestor,Pablito, and Benigno seemed to be on the brink of getting physically ill. LaGorda was perspiring profusely. She sat down with Josefina in an alcove in oneof the walls, while Lydia and Rosa went inside one of the rooms. Suddenly Nestorseemed to have an urge to find something and disappeared into another of thoserooms. So did Pablito and Benigno.I was left alone with the lady. I wanted to talk to her, ask her questions, seeif she knew Silvio Manuel, but I could not muster the energy to talk. My stomachwas in knots. My hands were dripping perspiration. What oppressed me was anintangible sadness, a longing for something not present, unformulated.I could not stand it. I was about to say goodbye to the lady and walk out of thehouse when la Gorda came to my side. She whispered that we should sit down in alarge room off a hall separate from the courtyard. The room was visible fromwhere we were standing. We went there and stepped inside. It was a very large,empty room with a high beamed ceiling; dark but airy.La Gorda called everyone to the room. The lady just looked at us, but did notcome in herself. Everyone seemed to know precisely where to sit. The Genaros satto the right of the door, on one side of the room, and la Gorda and the threelittle sisters sat to the left, on the other side. They sat close to the walls.Although I would have liked to sit next to la Gorda, I sat near the center ofthe room. The place seemed right to me. I did not know why, but an ulteriororder seemed to have determined our places.While I sat there, a wave of strange feelings rolled over me. I was passive andrelaxed. I fancied myself to be like a moving picture screen on which alienfeelings of sadness and longing were being projected. But there was nothing Icould recognize as a precise memory. We stayed in that room for over an hour.Toward the end I felt I was about to uncover the source of the unearthly sadnessthat was making me weep almost without control. But then, as involuntarily as wehad sat there, we stood up and left the house. We did not even thank the lady orsay goodbye to her. We congregated in the plaza. La Gorda stated right away that because she wasformless she was still in charge. She said that she was taking this standbecause of conclusions she had reached in Silvio Manuel's house. La Gorda seemedto be waiting for comments. The silence of the others was unbearable to me. Ifinally had to say something.\"What are the conclusions you reached in that house, Gorda?\" I asked.\"I think we all know what they are,\" she replied in a haughty tone.\"We don't know that,\" I said. \"Nobody has said anything yet.\"\"We don't have to talk, we know,\" la Gorda said.I insisted that I could not take such an important event for granted. We neededto talk about our feelings. As far as I was concerned, all I had gotten out ofit was a devastating sense of sadness and despair.\"The Nagual Juan Matus was right,\" la Gorda said. \"We had to sit on that placeof power to be free. I am free now. I don't know how it happened, but somethingwas lifted off me as I sat there.\"The three women agreed with her. The three men did not. Nestor said that he hadbeen about to remember actual faces, but that no matter how hard he had tried toclear his view, something thwarted him. All he had experienced was a sense oflonging and sadness at finding himself still in the world. Pablito and Benignosaid more or less the same thing.\"See what I mean, Gorda?\" I said.She seemed displeased. She puffed up as I had never seen her. Or had I seen herall puffed-up before, somewhere? She harangued the group. I could not payattention to what she was saying. I was immersed in a memory that was formless,but almost within my grasp.To keep it going it seemed I needed a continuous flow from la Gorda. I was fixedon the sound of her voice; her anger. At a certain moment, when she was becomingmore subdued, I yelled at her that she was bossy. She got truly upset. I watchedher for a while. I was remembering another Gorda; another time; an angry, fatGorda, pounding her fists on my chest. I remembered laughing at seeing herangry; humoring her like a child. The memory ended the moment la Gorda's voicestopped. She seemed to have realized what I was doing.I addressed all of them and told them that we were in a precarious [*precarious- affording no ease or reassurance: fraught with danger] position-something unknown was looming over us.\"It's not looming over us,\" la Gorda said dryly. \"It's hit us already. And Ithink you know what it is.\"\"I don't, and I think I'm also speaking for the rest of the men,\" I said.The three Genaros assented with a nod.\"We have lived in that house while we were on the left side,\" la Gordaexplained. \"I used to sit in that alcove to cry because I couldn't figure outwhat to do. I think if I could have stayed in that room a bit longer today, Iwould've remembered it all. But something pushed me out of there.\"I also used to sit in that room when there were more people in there. Icouldn't remember their faces, though. Yet other things became clear as I satthere today. I'm formless. Things come to me, good and bad. I, for instance,picked up my old arrogance and my desire to brood. But I also picked up otherthings; good things.\"\"Me too,\" Lydia said in a raspy voice.\"What are the good things?\" I asked.\"I think I'm wrong in hating you,\" Lydia said. \"My hatred will keep me fromflying away. They told me that in that room, the men there and the women.\"\"What men and what women?\" Nestor asked in a tone of fright.\"I was there when they were there, that's all I know,\" Lydia said. \"You alsowere there. All of us were there.\"\"Who were those men and women, Lydia?\" I asked.\"I was there when they were there, that's all I know,\" she repeated.\"How about you, Gorda?\" I asked.\"I've told you already that I can't remember any faces or anything specific,\"she said. \"But I know one thing: whatever we did in that house was on the leftside. We crossed, or somebody made us cross, over the parallel lines. The weirdmemories we have come from that time, from that world.\"Without any verbal agreement, we left the plaza and headed for the bridge. LaGorda and Lydia ran ahead of us. When we got there we found both of themstanding exactly where we ourselves had stopped earlier.\"Silvio Manuel is the darkness,\" la Gorda whispered to me, her eyes fixed on theother end of the bridge.Lydia was shaking. She also tried to talk to me. I could not understand what shewas mouthing.I pulled everyone back away from the bridge. I thought that perhaps if we couldpiece together what we knew about that place, we might have a composite thatwould help us understand our dilemma.We sat on the ground a few yards away from the bridge. There were lots of peoplemilling around, but no one paid any attention to us.\"Who's Silvio Manuel, Gorda?\" I asked.\"I never heard the name until now,\" she said. \"I don't know the man, yet I knowhim. Something like waves came upon me when I heard that name. Josefina told methe name when we were in the house. From that moment on, things have started tocome to my mind and to my mouth, just like Josefina. I never thought I wouldlive to find myself being like Josefina.\"\"Why did you say that Silvio Manuel is the darkness?\" I asked.\"I have no idea,\" she said. \"Yet all of us here know that that is the truth.\"She urged the women to speak up. No one uttered a word. I picked on Rosa. Shehad been about to say something three or four times. I accused her of holdingout on us. Her little body convulsed.\"We crossed this bridge and Silvio Manuel waited for us at the other end,\" shesaid in a voice barely audible. \"I went last. When he devoured the others Iheard their screams. I wanted to run away but the devil Silvio Manuel was atboth ends of the bridge. There was no way to escape.\"La Gorda, Lydia, and Josefina agreed. I asked whether it was just a feeling thatthey had had or an actual 'moment to moment' memory of something. La Gorda saidthat for her it had been exactly as Rosa had described it, a moment to momentmemory. The other two agreed with her.I wondered aloud what had happened with the people who lived around the bridge.If the women were screaming as Rosa said they were, the passersby must haveheard them. Screaming would have caused a commotion. For a moment I felt thatthe whole town must have collaborated in some plot. A chill ran through me. Iturned to Nestor and bluntly expressed the full scope of my fear.Nestor said that the Nagual Juan Matus and Genaro were indeed warriors ofsupreme accomplishment, and as such they were solitary beings. Their contactswith people were one-to-one. There was no possibility that the entire town, oreven the people who lived around the bridge were in collusion with them. Forthat to happen, Nestor said, all those people would have to be warriors, a mostunlikely possibility. Josefina began to circle me, looking me up and down with asneer.\"You certainly have gall,\" she said. \"Pretending that you don't know anything,when you were here yourself. You brought us here! You pushed us onto thisbridge!\"The eyes of the women became menacing. I turned to Nestor for assistance.\"I don't remember a thing,\" he said. \"This place scares me, that's all I know.\"Turning to Nestor was an excellent maneuver on my part. The women lashed out athim.\"Of course you remember!\" Josefina yelled. \"All of us were here. What kind ofstupid ass are you?\"My inquiry required a sense of order. I moved them away from the bridge. Ithought that, being the active persons they were, they would find it morerelaxing to stroll and talk things out; rather than sitting, as I would havepreferred.As we walked, the women's anger vanished as quickly as it had come. Lydia andJosefina became even more talkative. They stated over and over the sense theyhad had that Silvio Manuel was awesome. Nevertheless, neither of them couldremember being physically hurt. They only remembered being paralyzed by fear.Rosa did not say a word, but gestured her agreement with everything the otherssaid.I asked them if it had been night when they tried to cross the bridge. BothLydia and Josefina said that it was daytime. Rosa cleared her throat andwhispered that it was at night. La Gorda clarified the discrepancy, explainingthat it had been the morning twilight, or just before.We reached the end of a short street and automatically turned back toward thebridge.\"It's simplicity itself,\" la Gorda said suddenly, as if she had just thought itthrough. \"We were crossing, or rather Silvio Manuel was making us cross, theparallel lines. That bridge is a power spot; a hole in this world; a door to theother. We went through it. It must have hurt us to go through, because my bodyis scared. Silvio Manuel was waiting for us on the other side. None of usremembers his face because Silvio Manuel is the darkness, and never would heshow his face. We could see only his eyes.\"\"One eye,\" Rosa said quietly, and looked away.\"Everyone here, including you,\" la Gorda said to me, \"knows that Silvio Manuel'sface is in darkness. One could only hear his voice- soft, like muffledcoughing.\"La Gorda stopped talking and began scrutinizing me in a way that made me feelself-conscious. Her eyes were cagey. She gave me the impression that she washolding back something she knew. I asked her. She denied it, but she admittedhaving scores of feelings with no foundation that she did not care to explain. Iurged and then demanded that the women make an effort to recollect what hadhappened to them on the other side of that bridge. Each of them could rememberonly hearing the screams of the others.The three Genaros remained outside our discussion. I asked Nestor if he had anyidea of what had happened. His somber answer was that all of it was beyond hisunderstanding.I came then to a quick decision. It seemed to me that the only avenue open forus was to cross that bridge. I rallied them to walk back to the bridge and goover it as a group. The men agreed instantaneously, the women did not. Afterexhausting all my reasonings I finally had to push and drag Lydia, Rosa, andJosefina.La Gorda was reluctant to go but seemed intrigued by the prospect. She movedalong without helping me with the women, and so did the Genaros. They gigglednervously at my efforts to herd the little sisters, but they did not move afinger to help. We walked up to the point where we had stopped earlier.I felt there that I was suddenly too weak to hold the three women. I yelled atla Gorda to help. She made a halfhearted attempt to catch Lydia as the grouplost its cohesion and everyone of them except la Gorda scrambled, stumping andpuffing, to the safety of the street. La Gorda and I stayed as if we were gluedto that bridge, incapable of going forward and begrudging having to retreat.La Gorda whispered in my ear that I should not be afraid at all because it hadactually been I who had been waiting for them on the other side. She added thatshe was convinced I knew I was Silvio Manuel's helper, but that I did not dareto reveal it to anyone.Right then a fury beyond my control shook my body. I felt that la Gorda had nobusiness making those remarks or having those feelings. I grabbed her by thehair and twirled her around. I caught myself at the apex of my wrath andstopped. I apologized and hugged her.A sober thought came to my rescue. I said to her that being a leader was gettingon my nerves. The tension was becoming more and more acute as we proceeded. Shedid not agree with me. She held on steadfastly to her interpretation that SilvioManuel and I were utterly close, and that upon being reminded of my master, Ihad reacted with anger. It was lucky that she had been entrusted to my care, shesaid, otherwise I probably would have thrown her off the bridge.We turned back. The rest of them were safely off the bridge, staring at us withunmistakable fear. A very peculiar state of timelessness seemed to prevail.There were no people around. We must have been on that bridge for at least fiveminutes and not a single person had crossed it or even come in sight. Then allof a sudden people were moving around as on any thoroughfare during the busyhours.Without a word, we walked back to the plaza. We were dangerously weak. I had avague desire to remain in the town a bit longer, but we got in the car and droveeast, toward the Atlantic coast. Nestor and I took turns driving, stopping onlyfor gasoline and to eat, until we reached Veracruz.That city was neutral ground for us. I had been there only once. None of theothers had ever been there. La Gorda believed that such an unknown city was theproper place to shed their old wrappings. We checked into a hotel, and therethey proceeded to rip their old clothes to shreds. The excitation of a new citydid wonders for their morale and their feeling of well-being.Our next stop was Mexico City. We stayed at a hotel by the Alameda Park wheredon Juan and I had once stayed. For two days we were perfect tourists. Weshopped and visited as many tourist spots as possible. The women looked simplystunning. Benigno bought a camera in a pawn shop. He took four hundred andtwenty-five shots without any film.At one place, while we were admiring the stupendous mosaics on the walls, asecurity guard asked me where those gorgeous foreign women were from. He assumedI was a tourist guide. I told him that they were from Sri Lanka. He believed meand marveled at the fact that they almost looked Mexican.The following day at ten o'clock in the morning we were at the airline officeinto which don Juan had once pushed me. When he shoved me I had gone in throughone door and come out through another; not to the street, as I should have, butto a market at least a mile away, where I had watched the activities of thepeople there.La Gorda speculated that the airline office was also, like that bridge, a powerspot, a door to cross from one parallel line to the other. She said thatevidently the Nagual had pushed me through that opening but I got caught midwaybetween the two worlds, in between the lines. Thus I had watched the activity inthe market without being part of it. She said that the Nagual, of course, hadintended to push me all the way through, but my willfulness thwarted him and Iended back on the line I came from; this world.We walked from the airline office to the market and from there to the AlamedaPark where don Juan and I had sat after our experience at the office. I had beenin that park with don Juan many times. I felt it was the most appropriate placeto talk about the course of our future actions.It was my intention to summarize everything we had done in order to let thepower of that place decide what our next step would be. After our deliberateattempt at crossing the bridge, I had tried unsuccessfully to think out a way tohandle my companions as a group. We sat on some stone steps and I started offwith the idea that for me knowledge was fused with words. I told them that itwas my earnest belief that if an event or experience was not formulated into aconcept, it was condemned to dissipatel. I asked them therefore to give me theirindividual assessments of our situation.Pablito was the first one to talk. I found that odd, since he had beenextraordinarily quiet up until now. He apologized because what he was going tosay was not something he had remembered or felt, but a conclusion based oneverything he knew.He said that he saw no problem in understanding what the women said had happenedon that bridge. It had been, Pablito maintained, a matter of being compelled tocross from the right side, the tonal, to the left side, the nagual. What hadscared everyone was the fact that someone else was in control, forcing thecrossing.He saw no problem either in accepting that I had been the one who had thenhelped Silvio Manuel. He backed up his conclusion with the statement that onlytwo days earlier he had seen me doing the same thing; pushing everyone onto thebridge. That time I had had no one to help me on the other side; no SilvioManuel to pull them.I tried to change the topic and began to explain to them that to forget the waywe had forgotten was called amnesia. The little I knew about amnesia was notenough to shed any light on our case, but enough to make me believe that wecould not forget as if on command. I told them that someone, possibly don Juan,must have done something unfathomable to us. I wanted to find out exactly whatthat had been.Pablito insisted that it was important for me to understand that it was I whohad been in cahoots with Silvio Manuel. He intimated then that Lydia andJosefiha had talked to him about the role I had played in forcing them to crossthe parallel lines.I did not feel comfortable discussing that subject. I commented that I had neverheard about the parallel lines until the day I spoke with dona Soledad; yet Ihad had no qualms about immediately adopting the idea. I told them that I knewin a flash what she meant. I even became convinced I had crossed them myselfwhen I thought I remembered her. Every one of the others, with the exception ofla Gorda, said that the first time they had heard about parallel lines was whenI spoke of them. La Gorda said that she had first learned about them from donaSoledad, just before I did.Pablito made an attempt to talk about my relationship with Silvio Manuel. Iinterrupted him. I said that while all of us were at the bridge trying to crossit, I had failed to recognize that I- and presumably all of them- had enteredinto a state of non-ordinary reality.I only became aware of the change when I realized that there were no otherpeople on the bridge. Only the eight of us had stood there. It had been a clearday, but suddenly the skies became cloudy and the light of the midmorning turnedto dusk. I had been so busy with my fears and personalistic interpretations thenthat I had failed to notice the awesome change.When we retreated from the bridge I perceived that other people were againwalking around. But what had happened to them when we were attempting ourcrossing?La Gorda and the rest of them had not noticed anything- in fact they had notbeen aware of any changes until the very moment I described them. All of themstared at me with a mixture of annoyance and fear. Pablito again took the leadand accused me of trying to railroad them into something they did not want. Hewas not specific about what that might be, but his eloquence was enough to rallythe others behind him.Suddenly I had a horde of angry sorcerers on me. It took me a long time toexplain my need to examine from every possible point of view something sostrange and engulfing as our experience on the bridge. They finally calmed down,not so much because they were convinced, but from emotional fatigue. All ofthem, la Gorda included, had vehemently supported Pablito's stand.Nestor advanced another line of reasoning. He suggested that I was possibly anunwilling envoy who did not fully realize the scope of my actions. He added thathe could not bring himself to believe, as the others did, that I was aware thatI had been left with the task of misleading them. He felt that I did not reallyknow that I was leading them to their destruction, yet I was doing just that.He thought that there were two ways of crossing the parallel lines; one by meansof someone else's power, and the other by one's own power. His final conclusionwas that Silvio Manuel had made them cross by frightening them so intensely thatsome of them did not even remember having done it. The task left for them toaccomplish was to cross on their own power; mine was to thwart them.Benigno spoke then. He said that in his opinion the last thing don Juan did tothe male apprentices was to help us cross the parallel lines by making us jumpinto an abyss. Benigno believed that we already had a great deal of knowledgeabout the crossing, but that it was not yet time to accomplish it again. At thebridge they were incapable of taking one more step because the time was notright.They were correct, therefore, in believing that I had tried to destroy them byforcing them to cross. He thought that going over the parallel lines in fullawareness meant a final step for all of them, a step to be taken only when theywere ready to disappear from this earth.Lydia faced me next. She did not make any assessments, but challenged me toremember how I had first lured her to the bridge. She blatantly stated that Iwas not the Nagual Juan Matus's apprentice but Silvio Manuel's; that SilvioManuel and I had devoured each other's bodies.I had another attack of rage, as with la Gorda on the bridge. I caught myself intime. A logical thought calmed me. I said to myself over and over that I wasinterested in analyses. [* analyses- an investigation of the component parts ofa whole]I explained to Lydia that it was useless to taunt me like that. She did not wantto stop. She yelled that Silvio Manuel was my master and that this was thereason I was not part of them at all. Rosa added that Silvio Manuel gave meeverything I was.I questioned Rosa's choice of words. I told her that she should have said thatSilvio Manuel gave me everything I had. She defended her wording. Silvio Manuelhad given me what I was. Even la Gorda backed her up and said that sheremembered a time when I had gotten so ill that I had no resources left;everything in me was exhausted. It was then that Silvio Manuel had taken overand pumped new life into my body.La Gorda said that I was indeed better off knowing my true origins thanproceeding, as I had done so far, on the assumption that it was the Nagual JuanMatus who had helped me. She insisted that I was fixed on the Nagual because ofhis predilection for words. Silvio Manuel, on the other hand, was the silentdarkness. She explained that in order to follow him I would need to cross theparallel lines. But to follow the Nagual Juan Matus, all I needed to do was totalk about him.What they were saying was nothing but nonsense to me. I was about to make what Ithought was a very good point about it when my line of reasoning becameliterally scrambled. I could not think what my point had been, although only asecond before, it was clarity itself.Instead, a most curious memory beset me. It was not a feeling of something, butthe actual hard memory of an event. I remembered that once I was with don Juanand another man whose face I could not remember. The three of us were talkingabout something I was perceiving as a feature of the world. It was three or fouryards to my right and it was an inconceivable bank of yellowish fog that, as faras I could tell, divided the world in two.It went from the ground up to the sky, to infinity. While I talked to the twomen, the half of the world to my left was intact and the half to my right wasveiled in fog. I remembered that I had oriented myself with the aid of landmarksand realized that the axis of the bank of fog went from east to west. Everythingto the north of that line was the world as I knew it. I remembered asking donJuan what had happened to the world south of the line. Don Juan made me turn afew degrees to my right, and I saw that the wall of fog moved as I turned myhead. The world was divided in two at a level my intellect could not comprehend.The division seemed real, but the boundary was not on a physical plane. It hadto be somehow in myself. Or was it?There was still one more facet to this memory. The other man said that it was agreat accomplishment to divide the world in two, but it was an even greateraccomplishment when a warrior had the serenity and control to stop the rotationof that wall. He said that the wall was not inside us. It was certainly out inthe world, dividing it in two, and rotating when we moved our heads as if itwere stuck to our right temples. The great accomplishment of keeping the wallfrom turning enabled the warrior to face the wall and gave him the power to gothrough it anytime he so desired.When I told the apprentices what I had just remembered, the women were convincedthat the other man was Silvio Manuel. Josefina, as a connoisseur of the wall offog, explained that the advantage Eligio had over everyone else was his capacityto make the wall stand still so he could go through it at will. She added thatit is easier to pierce the wall of fog in dreaming because then it does notmove.La Gorda seemed to be touched by a series of perhaps painful memories. Her bodyjumped involuntarily until finally she exploded into words. She said that it wasno longer possible for her to deny the fact that I was Silvio Manuel's helper.The Nagual himself had warned her that I would enslave her if she was notcareful. Even Soledad had told her to watch me because my spirit took prisonersand kept them as servants; a thing only Silvio Manuel would do. He had enslavedme and I in turn would enslave anyone who came close to me. She asserted thatshe had lived under my spell up to the moment she sat in that room in SilvioManuel's house when something was suddenly lifted off her shoulders.I stood up and literally staggered under the impact of la Gorda's words. Therewas a vacuum in my stomach. I had been convinced that I could count on her forsupport under any conditions. I felt betrayed. I thought it would be appropriateto let them know my feelings, but a sense of sobriety came to my rescue. I toldthem instead that it had been my dispassionate conclusion, as a warrior, thatdon Juan had changed the course of my life for the better. I had assessed overand over what he had done to me, and the conclusion had always been the same. Hehad brought me freedom. Freedom was all I knew, all I could bring to anyone whomight come to me.Nestor made a gesture of solidarity with me. He exhorted the women to abandontheir animosity toward me. He looked at me with the eyes of one who does notunderstand but wants to. He said that I did not belong with them; that I wasindeed a solitary bird. They had needed me for a moment in order to break theirboundaries of affection and routine. Now that they were free, the sky was theirlimit. To remain with me would doubtlessly be pleasant but deadly for them.He seemed to be deeply moved. He came to my side and put his hand on myshoulder. He said that he had the feeling we were not going to see each otherever again on this earth. He regretted that we were going to part like pettypeople; bickering, complaining, accusing.He told me that speaking on behalf of the others, but not for himself, he wasgoing to ask me to leave, for we had no more possibilities in being together. Headded that he had laughed at la Gorda for telling us about the snake we hadformed. He had changed his mind and no longer found the idea ridiculous. It hadbeen our last opportunity to succeed as a group. Don Juan had taught me to accept my fate in humbleness.\"The course of a warrior's destiny is unalterable,\" he once said to me. \"Thechallenge is how far he can go within those rigid bounds; how impeccable he canbe within those rigid bounds. If there are obstacles in his path, the warriorstrives impeccably to overcome them. If he finds unbearable hardship and pain onhis path, he weeps. But all his tears put together could not move the line ofhis destiny the breadth of one hair.\"My original decision to let the power of that place point out our next step hadbeen correct. I stood up. The others turned their heads away. La Gorda came tomy side and said, as if nothing had happened, that I should leave and that shewould catch up with me and join me at a later time. I wanted to retort that Isaw no reason for her to join me. She had chosen to join the others.She seemed to read my feeling of having been betrayed. She calmly assured methat we had to fulfill our fate together as warriors and not as the petty peoplewe were.====================================================Part two: The Art of 'Dreaming'"},{"pageContent":"6. Losing the Human Form A few months later, after helping everyone to resettle in different parts ofMexico, la Gorda took up residence in Arizona. We began then to unravel thestrangest and most engulfing part of our apprenticeship.At first our relationship was rather strained. It was very difficult for me toovercome my feelings about the way we had parted in the Alameda Park. Althoughla Gorda knew the whereabouts of the others, she never said anything to me. Shefelt that it would have been superfluous [* superfluous- serving no usefulpurpose] for me to know about their activities.On the surface, everything seemed to be all right between la Gorda and me.Nevertheless, I held a bitter resentment toward her for siding with the othersagainst me. I did not express it, but it was always there. I helped her, and dideverything for her as if nothing had happened; but that entered under theheading of impeccability. It was my duty. To fulfill that duty, I would havegladly gone to my death. I purposely absorbed myself in guiding and coaching herin the intricacies of modern city living. She was even learning English. Herprogress was phenomenal. [* phenomenal- exceedingly or unbelievably great]Three months went by almost unnoticed. But one day while I was in Los Angeles, Iwoke up in the early morning hours with an unbearable pressure in my head. Itwas not a headache: It was rather a very intense weight in my ears. I felt italso on my eyelids and the roof of my mouth. I knew I was feverish, but the heatwas only in my head. I made a feeble attempt to sit up. The thought crossed mymind that I was having a stroke. My first reaction was to call for help, butsomehow I calmed down and tried to let go of my fear.After a while, the pressure in my head began to diminish, but it also began toshift to my throat. I gasped for air- gagging and coughing for some time. Thepressure moved slowly to my chest, then to my stomach, to my groin, to my legs,and to my feet before it finally left my body.Whatever had happened to me had taken about two hours to unfold. During thecourse of those two grueling hours, it was as if something inside my body wasactually moving downward; moving out of me. I fancied it to be rolling up like acarpet. Another image that occurred to me was of a blob moving inside the cavityof my body.I discarded that image in favor of the first because the feeling was ofsomething being coiled within itself. Just like a carpet being rolled up, itbecame heavier and thus more painful as it went down. The two areas where thepain became excruciating were my knees and my feet, especially my right footwhich remained hot for thirty-five minutes after all the pain and pressure hadvanished.La Gorda, upon hearing my report, said that this time for certain I had lost myhuman form; that I had dropped all my shields, or most of them. She was right.Without knowing how or even realizing what had happened, I found myself in amost unfamiliar state. I felt detached; unbiased.It did not matter what la Gorda had done to me. It was not that I had forgivenher for her reproachable behavior with me. It was as if there had never been anybetrayal. There was no overt or covert rancor left in me for la Gorda, or foranyone else.What I felt was not a willed indifference, nor negligence to act. Neither was italienation, nor even the desire to be alone. Rather, it was an alien feeling ofaloofness; a capability of immersing myself in the moment, and of having nothoughts whatever about anything else.People's actions no longer affected me because I had no more expectations of anykind. A strange peace became the ruling force in my life. I felt I had somehowadopted one of the concepts of a warrior's life: detachment.La Gorda said that I had done more than adopt it: I had actually embodied it.Don Juan and I had had long discussions on the possibility that someday I woulddo just that. He had said that detachment did not automatically mean wisdom, butthat it was, nonetheless, an advantage because it allowed the warrior to pausemomentarily to reassess situations; to reconsider positions. In order to usethat extra moment consistently and correctly, however, he said that a warriorhad to struggle unyieldingly for a lifetime.I had despaired that I would never experience that feeling. As far as I coulddetermine, there was no way to improvise it. It had been useless for me to thinkabout its benefits, or to reason out the possibilities of its advent. [* advent-an arrival that has been awaited; especially of something momentous]During the years I had known don Juan, I certainly experienced a steadylessening of personal ties with the world; but that had taken place on anintellectual plane. In my everyday life, I was unchanged until the moment I lostmy human form.I speculated with la Gorda that the concept of losing the human form refers to abodily condition that besets the apprentice upon his reaching a certainthreshold in the course of training.Be that as it may, the end result of losing the human form for la Gorda andmyself, oddly enough, was not only the sought-after and coveted sense ofdetachment, but also the fulfillment of our elusive task of remembering.And again in this case, the intellect played a minimal part. One night la Gorda and I were discussing a movie. She had gone to see an X-ratedmovie, and I was eager to hear her description of it. She had not liked it atall. She maintained that it was a weakening experience because being a warriorentailed leading an austere [* austere- severely simple, stern, or strict inbearing or demeanour] life in total celibacy, [* celibacy- abstaining fromsexual relations] like the Nagual Juan Matus.I told her that I knew for a fact that don Juan liked women, and was notcelibate; and that I found that delightful.\"You're insane!\" she exclaimed with a tinge of amusement in her voice. \"TheNagual was a perfect warrior. He was not caught up in any webs of sensuality.\"She wanted to know why I thought don Juan was not celibate. I told her about anincident that had taken place in Arizona at the beginning of my apprenticeship. I had been resting at don Juan's house one day after an exhausting hike. DonJuan appeared to be strangely nervous. He kept getting up to look out the door.He seemed to be waiting for someone.Then, quite abruptly, he told me that a car had just come around the bend in theroad, and was heading for the house. He said that it was a girl- a friend of hiswho was bringing him some blankets. I had never seen don Juan embarrassed, and Ifelt terribly sad to see him so upset that he did not know what to do.I thought that he did not want me to meet the girl. I suggested that I mighthide, but there was no place to conceal myself in the room. So he made me liedown on the floor, and covered me with a straw mat. I heard the sound of a carmotor being turned off, and then through the slits in the mat I saw a girlstanding at the door. She was tall, slender, and very young. I thought she wasbeautiful. Don Juan was saying something to her in a low, intimate voice. Thenhe turned and pointed at me.\"Carlos is hiding under the mat,\" he said to the girl in a loud clear voice.\"Say hello to him.\"The girl waved at me, and said hello with the friendliest smile. I felt stupidand angry at don Juan for putting me in that embarrassing position. It seemedobvious to me that he was trying to alleviate his nervousness; or even worse,that he was showing off in front of me.When the girl left, I angrily asked for an explanation. He candidly said that hehad gotten carried away because my feet were showing, and he did not know whatelse to do. When I heard this, his whole maneuver became clear. He had beenshowing off his young friend to me. I could not possibly have had my feetuncovered because they were tucked under my thighs. I laughed knowingly, and donJuan seemed obligated to explain that he liked women, especially that girl.I never forgot the incident. Don Juan never discussed it, and whenever I broughtit up, he always made me stop. I wondered almost obsessively about that youngwoman. I had hopes that someday she might look me up after reading my books. La Gorda had become very agitated. She was pacing back and forth in the roomwhile I talked. She was about to weep. I imagined all sorts of intricatenetworks of relationships that might be at stake. I thought la Gorda waspossessive, and was reacting like a woman threatened by another woman.\"Are you jealous, Gorda:\" I asked.\"Don't be stupid,\" she said angrily. \"I'm a formless warrior. I've no envy orjealousy left in me.\"I brought up something that the Genaros had told me; that la Gorda was theNagual's woman. Her voice became barely audible.\"I think I was,\" she said, and with a vague look she sat on her bed. \"I have afeeling that I was. I don't know how though. In this life, the Nagual Juan Matuswas to me what he was to you. He was not a man. He was the Nagual. He had nointerest in sex.\"I assured her that I had heard don Juan express his liking for that girl.\"Did he say that he had sex with her?\" la Gorda asked.\"No, he didn't, but it was obvious from the way he talked,\" I said.\"You would like the Nagual to be like you, wouldn't you?\" she asked with asneer. \"The Nagual was an impeccable warrior.\"I thought I was right, and did not need to review my opinion. Just to humor laGorda, I said that perhaps the young woman was, if not his mistress, don Juan'sapprentice.There was a long pause. What I had said had a disturbing effect on me. Untilthat moment I had never thought about such a possibility. I had been locked intoa prejudgment allowing myself no room for revision.La Gorda asked me to describe the young woman. I could not do it. I had notreally looked at her features. I had been too annoyed; too embarrassed toexamine her in detail. The young woman also seemed to have been struck by theawkwardness of the situation, and she had hurried out of the house.La Gorda said that, without any logical reason, she felt that the young womanwas a key figure in the Nagual's life. Her statement led us to talking about donJuan's known friends. We struggled for hours trying to piece together all theinformation we had about his associates. I told her about the different timesdon Juan had taken me to participate in peyote ceremonies. I described everyonewho was there. She recognized none of them. I realized then that I might knowmore people associated with don Juan than she did.But something I had said triggered her recollection of a time when she had seena young woman driving the Nagual and Genaro in a small white car. The woman letthe two men off at the door of la Gorda's house, and she stared at la Gordabefore she drove away. La Gorda thought that the young woman was someone who hadgiven the Nagual and Genaro a lift. I remembered then that I had gotten up fromunder the straw mat at don Juan's house just in time to see a white Volkswagendriving away.I mentioned one more incident involving another of don Juan's friends; a man whohad given me some peyote plants once in the market of a city in northern Mexico.He had also obsessed me for years. His name was Vicente.Upon hearing that name, la Gorda's body reacted as if a nerve had been touched.Her voice became shrill. She asked me to repeat the name, and describe the man.Again I could not come up with any description. I had seen the man only once fora few minutes more than ten years before.La Gorda and I went through a period of almost being angry; not at one another,but at whatever was keeping us imprisoned. The final incident that precipitated our full-fledged remembering came one daywhen I had a cold, and was running a high fever. I had stayed in bed, dozing offand on, with thoughts rambling aimlessly in my mind. The melody of an oldMexican song had been running through my head all day.At one moment, I was dreaming that someone was playing it on a guitar. Icomplained about the monotony of it, and whoever I was protesting to, thrust theguitar toward my stomach. I jumped back to avoid being hit, and bumped my headon the wall: I woke up then.It had not been a vivid dream. Only the tune had been haunting. I could notdispel the sound of the guitar. It kept running through my mind. I remained halfawake listening to the tune. It seemed as if I were entering into a state ofdreaming.Then, a complete and detailed dreaming scene appeared in front of my eyes. Inthe scene there was a young woman sitting next to me. I could distinguish everydetail of her features. I did not know who she was, but seeing her shocked me.I was fully awake in one instant. The anxiety that her face created in me was sointense that I got up, and quite automatically I began to pace back and forth. Iwas perspiring profusely and I dreaded to leave my room. I could not call laGorda for help either. She had gone back to Mexico for a few days to seeJosefina. I tied a sheet around my waist to brace my midsection. It helped tosubdue some ripples of nervous energy that went through me.As I paced back and forth, the image in my mind began to dissolve; not intopeaceful oblivion as I would have liked, but into an intricate full-fledgedmemory. I remembered that one time I had been sitting on some sacks of wheat or barleystacked up in a grain bin. The young woman was singing the old Mexican song thathad been running in my mind while she played a guitar. When I joked about herplaying, she nudged me in the ribs with the butt of the guitar. There had beenother people sitting with me; la Gorda and two men. I knew those men very well,but I still could not remember who the young woman was. I tried but it seemedhopeless.I lay down again drenched in a cold sweat. I wanted to rest for a moment beforeI got out of my soaked pajamas. As I rested my head on a high pillow, my memoryseemed to clear up further, and then I knew who the guitar player was. She wasthe Nagual woman; the most important being on earth for la Gorda and myself. Shewas the feminine analogue [* analogue- somrthing equivalent in some respects,though otherwise dissimilar] of the Nagual man; not his wife or his woman, buthis counterpart. She had the serenity and command of a true leader. Being awoman, she nurtured us.I did not dare to push my memory too far. I knew intuitively that I did not havethe strength to withstand the full recollection. I stopped on the level ofabstract feelings. I knew that she was the embodiment of the purest, mostunbiased, and profound affection. It would be most appropriate to say that laGorda and I loved the Nagual woman more than life itself. What on earth hadhappened to us to have forgotten her?That night lying on my bed I became so agitated that I feared for my very life.I began to chant some words which became a guiding force to me. Only when I hadcalmed down did I remember that the words I had said to myself over and overwere also a memory that had come back to me that night; the memory of a formula;an incantation to pull me through an upheaval such as the one I had experienced. I am already given to the power that rules my fate.And I cling to nothing, so I will have nothing to defend.I have no thoughts, so I will see.I fear nothing, so I will remember myself. The formula had one more line, which at the time was incomprehensible to me. Detached and at ease, I will dart past the Eagle to be free. Being sick and feverish may have served as a cushion of sorts. It may have beenenough to deviate the main impact of what I had done; or rather, of what hadcome upon me since I had not intentionally done anything.Up to that night, if my inventory of experience had been examined, I could haveaccounted for the continuity of my existence. The nebulous [* nebulous- lackingdefinite form or limits] memories I had of la Gorda, or the presentiment [*presentiment- a feeling of evil to come] of having lived in that house in themountains of central Mexico were in a way real threats to the idea of mycontinuity.But those memories were nothing in comparison to remembering the Nagual woman;not so much because of the emotions that the memory itself brought back, butbecause I had forgotten her; and not as one forgets a name or a tune.There had been nothing about her in my mind prior to that moment of revelation.Nothing! And then something had come upon me, or something had fallen off me,and I found myself remembering her; a most important being, who from the pointof view of my experiential self prior to that moment, I had never met.I had to wait two more days for la Gorda's return before I could tell her aboutmy recollection. The moment I described the Nagual woman, la Gorda rememberedher. La Gorda's awareness was somehow dependent on mine.\"The girl I saw in the white car was the Nagual woman!\" la Gorda exclaimed. \"Shecame back to me and I couldn't remember her.\"I heard the words and understood their meaning, but it took a long time for mymind to focus on what she had said. My attention wavered. It was as if a lightwas actually placed in front of my eyes, and was being dimmed. I had the notionthat if I did not stop the dimming, I would die. Suddenly I felt a convulsionand I knew that I had put together two pieces of myself that had becomeseparated. I realized that the young woman I had seen at don Juan's house wasthe Nagual woman.In that moment of emotional upheaval, la Gorda was no help to me. Her mood wascontagious. She was weeping without restraint. The emotional shock ofremembering the Nagual woman had been traumatic to her.\"How could I have forgotten her?\" la Gorda sighed.I caught a glint of suspicion in her eyes as she faced me.\"You had no idea that she existed, did you?\" she asked.Under any other conditions, I would have thought that her question wasimpertinent and insulting; but I was wondering the same about her. It hadoccurred to me that she might have known more than she was revealing.\"No. I didn't,\" I said. \"But how about you, Gorda? Did you know that sheexisted?\"Her face had such a look of innocence and perplexity that my doubts weredispelled.\"No,\" she replied. \"Not until today. I know now for a fact that I used to sitwith her and the Nagual Juan Matus on that bench in the plaza in Oaxaca. Ialways remembered having done that, and I remembered her features; but I thoughtI had dreamed it all. I knew everything, and yet I didn't. But why did I thinkit was a dream?\"I had a moment of panic. Then I had the perfect physical certainty that as shespoke a channel opened somewhere in my body. Suddenly I knew that I also used tosit on that bench with don Juan and the Nagual woman.I remembered then a sensation I had experienced on every one of those occasions.It was a sense of physical contentment, happiness, and plenitude that would beimpossible to imagine. I thought that don Juan and the Nagual woman were perfectbeings, and that to be in their company was indeed my great fortune.Sitting on that bench, flanked by the most exquisite beings on earth, Iexperienced perhaps the epitome of my human sentiments. One time I told donJuan, and I meant it, that I wanted to die then so as to keep that feeling pure,intact, and free from disruption.I told la Gorda about my memory. She said that she understood what I meant. Wewere quiet for a moment and then the thrust of our remembering swayed usdangerously toward sadness; even despair. I had to exert the most extraordinarycontrol over my emotions not to weep. La Gorda was sobbing, covering her facewith her forearm.After a while we became more calm. La Gorda stared into my eyes. I knew what shewas thinking. It was as if I could read her questions in her eyes. They were thesame questions that had obsessed me for days. Who was the Nagual woman? Wherehad we met her? Where did she fit? Did the others know her too?I was just about to voice my questions when la Gorda interrupted me.\"I really don't know,\" she said quickly, beating me to the question. \"I wascounting on you to tell me. I don't know why, but I feel that you can tell mewhat's what.\"She was counting on me, and I was counting on her. We laughed at the irony ofour situation. I asked her to tell me everything she remembered about the Nagualwoman. La Gorda made efforts to say something two or three times, but seemed tobe unable to organize her thoughts.\"I really don't know where to start,\" she said. \"I only know that I loved her.\"I told her that I had the same feeling. An unearthly sadness gripped me everytime I thought of the Nagual woman. As I was talking, my body began to shake.\"You and I loved her,\" la Gorda said. \"I don't know why I'm saying this, but Iknow that she owned us.\"I prodded her to explain that statement. She could not determine why she hadsaid it. She was talking nervously; elaborating on her feelings. I could nolonger pay attention to her. I felt a fluttering in my solar plexus. A vaguememory of the Nagual woman started to form. I urged la Gorda to keep on talking;to repeat herself if she had nothing else to say, but not to stop. The sound ofher voice seemed to act for me as a conduit into another dimension; another kindof time.It was as if blood was rushing through my body with an unusual pressure. I felta prickling all over, and then I had an odd bodily memory. I knew in my bodythat the Nagual woman was the being who made the Nagual complete. She brought tothe Nagual peace, plenitude, and a sense of being protected and delivered.I told la Gorda that I had the insight that the Nagual woman was don Juan'spartner. La Gorda looked at me aghast. She slowly shook her head from side toside.\"She had nothing to do with the Nagual Juan Matus, you idiot,\" she said with atone of ultimate authority. \"She was for you. That's why you and I belonged toher.\"La Gorda and I stared into each other's eyes. I was certain that she wasinvoluntarily voicing thoughts which rationally did not mean anything to her.\"What do you mean, she was for me, Gorda?\" I asked after a long silence.\"She was your partner,\" she said. \"You two were a team; and I was her ward; andshe entrusted you to deliver me to her someday.\"I begged la Gorda to tell me all she knew, but she did not seem to know anythingelse. I felt exhausted.\"Where did she go?\" la Gorda said suddenly. \"I just can't figure that out. Shewas with you, not with the Nagual. She should be here with us now.\"She had then another attack of disbelief and fear. She accused me of hiding theNagual woman in Los Angeles. I tried to ease her apprehensions. I surprisedmyself by talking to la Gorda as if she were a child.She listened to me with all the outward signs of complete attention. Her eyes,however, were vacant; out of focus. It occurred to me then that she was usingthe sound of my voice just as I had used hers; as a conduit. I knew that she wasalso aware of it.I kept on talking until I had run out of things to say within the bounds of ourtopic. Something else took place then, and I found myself half listening to thesound of my own voice. I was talking to la Gorda without any volition on mypart. Words that seemed to have been bottled up inside me, now free, reachedindescribable levels of absurdity. I talked and talked until something made mestop.I had remembered that don Juan told the Nagual woman and me while we were onthat bench in Oaxaca about a particular human being whose presence hadsynthesized for him all that he could aspire or expect from human companionship.It was a woman who had been for him what the Nagual woman was for me; a partner;a counterpart. She left him, just as the Nagual woman left me. His feelings forher were unchanged, and were rekindled by the melancholy that certain poemsevoked in him.I also remembered that it was the Nagual woman who used to supply me with booksof poetry. She kept stacks of them in the trunk of her car. It was at herinstigation [* instigation- the verbal act of urging on] that I read poems todon Juan.Suddenly the physical memory of the Nagual woman sitting with me on that benchwas so clear that I took an involuntary gasp of air. My chest swelled. Anoppressive sense of loss- greater than any feeling I had ever had- tookpossession of me. I bent over with a ripping pain in my right shoulder blade.There was something else I knew; a memory which part of me did not want torelease.I became involved with whatever was left of my shield of intellectuality as theonly means to recover my equanimity. I said to myself over and over that laGorda and I had been operating all along on two absolutely different planes. Sheremembered a great deal more than I did, but she was not inquisitive. She hadnot been trained to ask questions of others or of herself.But then the thought struck me that I was no better off. I was still as sloppyas don Juan had once said I was. I had never forgotten reading poetry to donJuan, and yet it had never occurred to me to examine the fact that I had neverowned a book of Spanish poetry, nor did I ever carry one in my car.La Gorda brought me out of my ruminations. [* ruminations- calm, lengthy, andintense mental considerations] She was almost hysterical. She shouted that shehad just figured out that the Nagual woman had to be somewhere very near us.Just as we had been left to find one another, the Nagual woman had been left tofind us.The force of her reasoning almost convinced me. Something in me knew,nevertheless, that it was not so. In fact, that was the memory that was insideme which I did not dare to bring out.I wanted to start a debate with la Gorda, but there was no reason. My shield ofintellect and words was insufficient to absorb the impact of remembering theNagual woman. Its effect was staggering to me; more devastating than even thefear of dying.\"The Nagual woman is shipwrecked somewhere,\" la Gorda said meekly. \"She'sprobably marooned, and we're doing nothing to help her.\"\"No! No!\" I yelled. \"She's not here any more.\" I did not exactly know why I hadsaid that, yet I knew that it was true. We sank for a moment into depths ofmelancholy that would be impossible to fathom rationally. For the first time inthe memory of the me I know, I felt a true, boundless sadness; a dreadfulincompleteness. There was a wound somewhere in me that had been opened again.This time I could not take refuge- as I had done so many times in the past-behind a veil of mystery and not knowing. Not to know had been bliss to me. Fora moment, I was dangerously sliding into despondency. La Gorda stopped me.\"A warrior is someone who seeks freedom,\" she said in my ear. \"Sadness is notfreedom. We must snap out of it.\"Having a sense of detachment, as don Juan had said, entails having a moment'spause to reassess situations. At the depth of my sadness, I understood what hemeant. I had the detachment. It was up to me to strive to use that pausecorrectly.I could not be sure whether or not my volition [* volition- he capability ofconscious choice and intention] played a role, but all of a sudden my sadnessvanished. It was as if it had never existed. The speed of my change of mood, andits thoroughness, alarmed me.\"Now you are where I am!\" la Gorda exclaimed when I described what had happened.\"After all these years, I still haven't learned how to handle formlessness. Ishift helplessly from one feeling to another in one instant. Because of myformlessness, I could help the little sisters, but I was also at their mercy.Any one of them was strong enough to make me sway from one extreme to the other.\"The problem was that I lost my human form before you did. If you and I had lostit together, we could have helped each other. As it was, I went up and downfaster than I care to remember.\"I had to admit that her claim of being formless had always seemed spurious [*spurious- plausible but false; intended to deceive] to me. In my understanding,losing the human form included a necessary concomitant; [* concomitant- an eventor situation that happens at the same time as, or in connection with another]namely, a consistency of character which was, in light of her emotional ups anddowns, beyond her reach.On account of that, I had judged her harshly and unjustly. Having lost my humanform, I was now in a position to understand that formlessness is, if anything, adetriment to sobriety and levelheadedness. There is no automatic emotionalstrength involved in it. An aspect of being detached, the capacity to becomeimmersed in whatever one is doing, naturally extends to everything one does,including being inconsistent, and outright petty. The advantage of beingformless is that it allows us a moment's pause, providing that we have theself-discipline and courage to utilize it.At last la Gorda's past behavior became comprehensible to me. She had beenformless for years, but without the self-discipline required. Thus she had beenat the mercy of drastic shifts of mood; and incredible discrepancies between heractions and her purposes.After our initial recollection of the Nagual woman, la Gorda and I summoned allour forces and tried for days to elicit more memories, but there seemed to benone. I myself was back where I had been before I had begun to remember. Iintuited that there should be a great deal more somehow buried in me, but Icould not get to it. My mind was void of even the vaguest inkling of any othermemories.La Gorda and I went through a period of tremendous confusion and doubt. In ourcase, being formless meant to be ravaged by the worst distrust imaginable. Wefelt that we were guinea pigs in the hands of don Juan; a being supposedlyfamiliar to us, but about whom in reality we knew nothing.We fueled each other with doubts and fears. The most serious issue was of coursethe Nagual woman. When we would focus our attention on her, our memory of herbecame so keen that it was past comprehension that we could have forgotten her.This would give rise over and over to speculations of what don Juan had reallydone to us. These conjectures led very easily to the feeling that we had beenused. We became enraged by the unavoidable conclusion that he had manipulatedus, and had rendered us helpless and unknown to ourselves.When our rage was exhausted, fear began to loom over us- for we were faced withthe awesome possibility that don Juan might have done still more deleterious [*deleterious- harmful to living things] things to us.====================================================="},{"pageContent":"7. 'Dreaming' Together One day, in order to alleviate our distress momentarily, I suggested that weimmerse ourselves in dreaming. As soon as I voiced my suggestion, I became awarethat a gloom which had been haunting me for days could be drastically altered bywilling the change. I clearly understood then that the problem with la Gorda andmyself had been that we had unwittingly focused on fear and distrust, as ifthose were the only possible options available to us, while all along we hadhad, without consciously knowing it, the alternative of deliberately centeringour attention on the opposite; the mystery, the wonder of what had happened tous.I told la Gorda my realization. She agreed immediately. She became instantlyanimated, the pall of her gloom dispelled in a matter of seconds.\"What kind of dreaming do you propose we should do?\" she asked.\"How many kinds are there?\" I asked.\"We could do dreaming together,\" she replied. \"My body tells me that we havedone this already. We have gone into dreaming as a team. It'll be a cinch forus- as it was for us to see together.\"\"But we don't know what the procedure is to do dreaming together,\" I said.\"We didn't know how to see together and yet we saw,\" she said. \"I'm sure that ifwe try we can do it, because there are no steps to anything a warrior does.There is only personal power. And right now we have it.\"We should start out dreaming from two different places as far away as possiblefrom each other. The one who goes into dreaming first waits for the other. Oncewe find each other, we interlock our arms and go deeper in together.\"I told her that I had no idea how to wait for her if I went into dreaming aheadof her. She herself could not explain what was involved, but she said that towait for the other dreamer was what Josefina had described as 'snatching' them.La Gorda had been snatched by Josefina twice.\"The reason Josefina called it snatching was because one of us had to grab theother by the arm,\" she explained.She demonstrated then a procedure of interlocking her left forearm with my rightforearm by each of us grabbing hold of the area below each other's elbows.\"How can we do that in dreaming?\" I asked.I personally considered dreaming one of the most private states imaginable.\"I don't know how, but I'll grab you,\" la Gorda said. \"I think my body knowshow. The more we talk about it, though, the more difficult it seems to be.\"We started off our dreaming from two distant locations. We could agree only onthe time to lie down since the entrance into dreaming was something impossibleto prearrange. The foreseeable possibility that I might have to wait for laGorda gave me a great deal of anxiety, and I could not enter into dreaming withmy customary ease.After some ten to fifteen minutes of restlessness I finally succeeded in goinginto a state I call restful vigil. Years before, when I had acquired a degree of experience in dreaming, I hadasked don Juan if there were any known steps which were common to all of us. Hehad told me that in the final analysis every dreamer was different.But in talking with la Gorda I discovered such similarities in our experiencesof dreaming that I ventured a possible classificatory scheme of the differentstages.Restful vigil is the preliminary state; a state in which the senses becomedormant and yet one is aware. In my case, I had always perceived in this state aflood of reddish light; a light exactly like what one sees facing the sun withthe eyelids tightly closed.The second state of dreaming I called dynamic vigil. In this state the reddishlight dissipates, as fog dissipates, and one is left looking at a scene, atableau of sorts, which is static. One sees a three-dimensional picture, afrozen bit of something, a landscape, a street, a house, a person, a face, oranything.I called the third state passive witnessing. In it the dreamer is no longerviewing a frozen bit of the world but is observing; eyewitnessing an event as itoccurs. It is as if the primacy of the visual and auditory senses makes thisstate of dreaming mainly an affair of the eyes and ears.The fourth state was the one in which I was drawn to act. In it one is compelledto enterprise; to take steps; to make the most of one's time. I called thisstate dynamic initiative. La Gorda's proposition of waiting for me had to do with affecting the second andthird states of our dreaming together. When I entered into the second state,dynamic vigil, I saw a dreaming scene of don Juan and various other persons,including a fat Gorda.Before I even had time to consider what I was viewing, I felt a tremendous pullon my arm and I realized that the 'real' Gorda was by my side. She was to myleft and had gripped my right forearm with her left hand. I clearly felt herlifting my hand to her forearm so that we were gripping each other's forearms.Next, I found myself in the third state of dreaming, passive witnessing. DonJuan was telling me that I had to look after la Gorda and take care of her in amost selfish fashion- that is, as if she were my own self.His play on words delighted me. I felt an unearthly happiness in being therewith him and the others. Don Juan went on explaining that my selfishness couldbe put to a grand use, and that to harness it was not impossible.There was a general feeling of comradeship [* - the quality of easy familiarityand sociability] among all the people gathered there. They were laughing at whatdon Juan was saying to me, but without making fun.Don Juan said that the surest way to harness selfishness was through the dailyactivities of our lives; that I was efficient in whatever I did because I had noone to bug the devil out of me, and that it was no challenge to me to soar likean arrow by myself. If I were given the task of taking care of la Gorda,however, my independent effectiveness would go to pieces, and in order tosurvive I would have to extend my selfish concern for myself to include laGorda. Only through helping her, don Juan was saying in the most emphatic tone,would I find the clues for the fulfillment of my true task.La Gorda put her fat arms around my neck. Don Juan had to stop talking. He waslaughing so hard he could not go on. All of them were roaring.I felt embarrassed and annoyed with la Gorda. I tried to get out of her embracebut her arms were tightly fastened around my neck. Don Juan made a sign with hishands to make me stop. He said that the minimal embarrassment I was experiencingthen was nothing in comparison with what was in store for me.The sound of laughter was deafening. I felt very happy, although I was worriedabout having to deal with la Gorda, for I did not know what it would entail.At that moment in my dreaming I changed my point of view- or rather, somethingpulled me out of the scene and I began to look around as a spectator. We were ina house in northern Mexico. I could tell by the surroundings which werepartially visible from where I stood. I could see the mountains in the distance.I also remembered the paraphernalia of the house.We were at the back, under a roofed, open porch. Some of the people were sittingon some bulky chairs. Most of them, however, were either standing or sitting onthe floor. I recognized every one of them. There were sixteen people. La Gordawas standing by my side facing don Juan.I became aware that I could have two different feelings at the same time. Icould either go into the dreaming scene and feel that I was recovering along-lost sentiment, or I could witness the scene with the mood that was currentin my life. When I plunged into the dreaming scene I felt secure and protected.When I witnessed it with my current mood I felt lost, insecure, and anguished. Idid not like my current mood, so I plunged into my dreaming scene.A fat Gorda asked don Juan, in a voice which could be heard above everyone'slaughter, if I was going to be her husband. There was a moment's silence. DonJuan seemed to be calculating what to say.He patted her on the head and said that he could speak for me, and said that Iwould be delighted to be her husband. People were laughing riotously. I laughedwith them. My body convulsed with a most genuine enjoyment, yet I did not feel Iwas laughing at la Gorda. I did not regard her as a clown, or as stupid. She wasa child.Don Juan turned to me and said that I had to honor la Gorda regardless of whatshe did to me, and that I had to train my body, through my interaction with her,to feel at ease in the face of the most trying situations. Don Juan addressedthe whole group and said that it was much easier to fare well under conditionsof maximum stress, such as in the interplay with someone like la Gorda, than tobe impeccable under normal circumstances. Don Juan added that I could not underany circumstances get angry with la Gorda, because she was indeed mybenefactress. Only through her would I be capable of harnessing my selfishness.I had become so thoroughly immersed in the dreaming scene that I had forgotten Iwas a dreamer. A sudden pressure on my arm reminded me that I was dreaming. Ifelt la Gorda's presence next to me, but without seeing her.She was there only as a touch; a tactile sensation on my forearm. I focused myattention on it. It felt like a solid grip on me, and then la Gorda as a wholeperson materialized; as if she were made of superimposed frames of photographicfilm. It was like trick photography in a movie. The dreaming scene dissolved.Instead, la Gorda and I were looking at each other with our forearmsinterlocked.In unison, we again focused our attention on the dreaming scene we had beenwitnessing. At that moment I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that both of ushad been viewing the same thing.Now don Juan was saying something to la Gorda, but I could not hear him. Myattention was being pulled back and forth between the third state of dreaming,passive witnessing, and the second, dynamic vigil. I was for a moment with donJuan, a fat Gorda, and sixteen other people, and the next moment I was with thecurrent Gorda watching a frozen scene.Then a drastic jolt in my body brought me to still another level of attention. Ifelt something like the cracking of a dry piece of wood. It was a minorexplosion, yet it sounded more like an extraordinarily loud cracking ofknuckles. I found myself in the first state of dreaming, restful vigil. I wasasleep and yet thoroughly aware. I wanted to stay for as long as I could in thatpeaceful stage, but another jolt made me wake up instantly. I had suddenlyrealized that la Gorda and I had dreamed together.I was more than eager to speak with her. She felt the same. We rushed to talk toeach other. When we had calmed down, I asked her to describe to me everythingthat had happened to her in our dreaming together.\"I waited for you for a long time,\" she said. \"Some part of me thought I hadmissed you, but another part thought that you were nervous and were havingproblems, so I waited.\"\"Where did you wait, Gorda?\" I asked.\"I don't know,\" she replied. \"I know that I was out of the reddish light, but Icouldn't see anything. Come to think of it, I had no sight. I was feeling my wayaround. Perhaps I was still in the reddish light. It wasn't red, though. Theplace where I was, was tinted with a light peach color.Then I opened my eyes and there you were. You seemed to be ready to leave, so Igrabbed you by the arm. Then I looked and saw the Nagual Juan Matus, you, me,and other people in Vicente's house. You were younger and I was fat.\"The mention of Vicente's house brought a sudden realization to me. I told laGorda that once while driving through Zacatecas, in northern Mexico, I had had astrange urge and gone to visit one of don Juan's friends, Vicente, notunderstanding that in doing so I had unwittingly crossed into an excludeddomain, for don Juan had never introduced me to him.Vicente, like the Nagual woman, belonged to another area, another world. It wasno wonder that la Gorda was so shaken when I told her about the visit. We knewhim so very well. He was as close to us as don Genaro, perhaps even closer. Yetwe had forgotten him, just as we had forgotten the Nagual woman.At that point la Gorda and I made a huge digression. [* digression- a turningaside from the main course or concern)] We remembered together that Vicente,Genaro, and Silvio Manuel were don Juan's friends; his cohorts.They were bound together by a vow of sorts. La Gorda and I could not rememberwhat it was that had united them. Vicente was not an Indian. He had been apharmacist as a young man. He was the scholar of the group, and the real healerwho kept all of them healthy. He had a passion for botany. I was convincedbeyond any doubt that he knew more about plants than any human being alive. LaGorda and I remembered that it was Vicente who had taught everyone, includingdon Juan, about medicinal plants. He took special interest in Nestor, and all ofus thought that Nestor was going to be like him.\"Remembering Vicente makes me think about myself,\" la Gorda said. \"It makes methink what an unbearable woman I've been. The worst thing that can happen to awoman is to have children, to have holes in her body, and still act like alittle girl. That was my problem. I wanted to be cute and I was empty. And theylet me make a fool out of myself. They encouraged me to be a jackass.\"\"Who are they, Gorda?\" I asked.\"The Nagual and Vicente and all those people who were in Vicente's house when Iacted like such an ass with you.\"La Gorda and I had a realization in unison. They had allowed her to beunbearable only with me. No one else put up with her nonsense, although shetried it on everyone.\"Vicente did put up with me,\" la Gorda said. \"He played along with me. I evencalled him uncle. When I tried to call Silvio Manuel uncle he nearly ripped theskin off my armpits with his clawlike hands.\"We tried to focus our attention on Silvio Manuel but we could not remember whathe looked like. We could feel his presence in our memories but he was not aperson. He was only a feeling.As far as the dreaming scene was concerned, we remembered that it had been afaithful replica of what really did occur in our lives at a certain place andtime. It still was not possible for us to recall when. I knew, however, that Itook care of la Gorda as a means of training myself for the hardship ofinteracting with people. It was imperative that I internalize a mood of ease inthe face of difficult social situations, and no one could have been a bettercoach than la Gorda. The flashes of faint memories I had had of a fat Gordastemmed from those circumstances; for I had followed don Juan's orders to theletter.La Gorda said that she had not liked the mood of the dreaming scene. She wouldhave preferred just to watch it, but I pulled her in to feel her old feelingswhich were abhorrent to her. Her discomfort was so acute that she deliberatelysqueezed my arm to force me to end our participation in something so odious toher.The next day we arranged a time for another session of dreaming together. Shestarted from her bedroom and I from my study, but nothing happened. We becameexhausted merely trying to enter into dreaming. For weeks after that we tried toachieve again the effectiveness of our first performance, but without anysuccess. With every failure we became more desperate and greedy.In the face of our impasse, I decided that we should postpone our dreamingtogether for the time being and take a closer look at the process of dreamingand analyze its concepts and procedures.La Gorda did not agree with me at first. For her, the idea of reviewing what weknew about dreaming was another way of succumbing to despair and greed. Shepreferred to keep on trying even if we did not succeed. I persisted and shefinally accepted my point of view out of the sheer sense of being lost.One night we sat down and, as casually as we could, we began to discuss what weknew about dreaming. It quickly became obvious that there were some core topicswhich don Juan had given special emphasis.First was the act itself. It seemed to begin as a unique state of awarenessarrived at by focusing the residue of consciousness, which one still has whenasleep, on the elements, or the features of one's dreams.The residue of consciousness, which don Juan called the second attention, wasbrought into action, or was harnessed, through exercises of not-doing. Wethought that the essential aid to dreaming was a state of mental quietness whichdon Juan had called 'stopping the internal dialogue', or the 'not doing oftalking to oneself'.To teach me how to master it, he used to make me walk for miles with my eyesheld fixed and out of focus at a level just above the horizon so as to emphasizethe peripheral view. His method was effective on two counts. It allowed me tostop my internal dialogue after years of trying, and it trained my attention. Byforcing me to concentrate on the peripheral view, don Juan reinforced mycapacity to concentrate for long periods of time on one single activity.Later on, when I had succeeded in controlling my attention and could work forhours at a chore without distraction- a thing I had never before been able todo- he told me that the best way to enter into dreaming was to concentrate onthe area just at the tip of the sternum; at the top of the belly. He said thatthe attention needed for dreaming stems from that area.The energy needed in order to move and to seek in dreaming stems from the areaan inch or two below the belly button. He called that energy the will, or thepower to select; to assemble.In a woman both the attention and the energy for dreaming originate from thewomb.\"A woman's dreaming has to come from her womb because that's her center,\" laGorda said. \"In order for me to start dreaming or to stop it, all I have to dois place my attention on my womb. I've learned to feel the inside of it. I see areddish glow for an instant and then I'm off.\"\"How long does it take you to get to see that reddish glow?\" I asked.\"A few seconds. The moment my attention is on my womb I'm already into dreaming\"she continued. \"I never toil; not ever. Women are like that. The most difficultpart for a woman is to learn how to begin. It took me a couple of years to stopmy internal dialogue by concentrating my attention on my womb. Perhaps that'swhy a woman always needs someone else to prod her.\"The Nagual Juan Matus used to put cold, wet river pebbles on my belly to get meto feel that area. Or he would place a weight on it. I had a chunk of lead thathe got for me. He would make me close my eyes and focus my attention on the spotwhere the weight was. I used to fall asleep every time. But that didn't botherhim.It doesn't really matter what one does as long as the attention is on the womb.Finally I learned to concentrate on that spot without anything being placed onit. I went into dreaming one day all by myself.I was feeling my belly, at the spot where the Nagual had placed the weight somany times, when all of a sudden I fell asleep as usual, except that somethingpulled me right into my womb. I saw the reddish glow and I then had a mostbeautiful dream. But as soon as I tried to tell it to the Nagual, I knew that ithad not been an ordinary dream. There was no way of telling him what the dreamwas. I had just felt very happy and strong. He said it had been dreaming.\"From then on he never put a weight on me. He let me do dreaming withoutinterfering. He asked me from time to time to tell him about it. Then he wouldgive me pointers. That's the way the instruction in dreaming should beconducted.\"La Gorda said that don Juan told her that anything may suffice as a not-doing tohelp dreaming, providing that it forces the attention to remain fixed. Forinstance, he made her and all the other apprentices gaze at leaves and rocks,and encouraged Pablito to construct his own not-doing device.Pablito started off with the not-doing of walking backwards. He would move bytaking short glances to his sides in order to direct his path and to avoidobstacles on the way. I gave him the idea of using a rearview mirror and heexpanded it into the construction of a wooden helmet with an attachment thatheld two small mirrors, about six inches away from his face and two inches belowhis eye level. The two mirrors did not interfere with his frontal view, and dueto the lateral angle at which they were set, they covered the whole range behindhim. Pablito boasted that he had a 360-degree peripheral view of the world.Aided by this artifact, Pablito could walk backwards for any distance, or anylength of time.The position one assumes to do dreaming was also a very important topic.\"I don't know why the Nagual didn't tell me from the very beginning,\" la Gordasaid, \"that the best position for a woman to start from is to sit with her legscrossed and then let the body fall, as it may do once the attention is ondreaming. The Nagual told me about this perhaps a year after I had begun. Now Isit in that position for a moment, I feel my womb, and right away I'm dreaming.\"In the beginning, just like la Gorda, I had done it while lying on my back,until one day when don Juan told me that for the best results I should sit up ona soft, thin mat, with the soles of my feet placed together and my thighstouching the mat. He pointed out that, since I had elastic hip joints, I shouldexercise them to the fullest, aiming at having my thighs completely flat againstthe mat. He added that if I were to enter into dreaming in that sittingposition, my body would not slide or fall to either side, but my trunk wouldbend forward and my forehead would rest on my feet.Another topic of great significance was the time to do dreaming. Don Juan hadtold us that the late night or early morning hours were by far the best. Hisreason for favoring those hours was what he called a practical application ofthe sorcerers' knowledge.He said that since one has to do dreaming within a social milieu, [* milieu- theenvironmental condition] one has to seek the best possible conditions ofsolitude and lack of interference. The interference he was referring to had todo with the attention of people, and not their physical presence.For don Juan it was meaningless to retreat from the world and hide, for even ifone were alone in an isolated, deserted place, the interference of our fellowmen is prevalent because the fixation of their first attention cannot be shutoff. Only locally, at the hours when most people are asleep, can one avert partof that fixation for a short period of time. It is at those times that the firstattention of those around us is dormant.This led to his description of the second attention. Don Juan explained to usthat the attention one needs in the beginning of dreaming has to be forciblymade to stay on any given item in a dream. Only through immobilizing ourattention can one turn an ordinary dream into dreaming.He explained, furthermore, that in dreaming one has to use the same mechanismsof attention as in everyday life; that our first attention had been taught tofocus on the items of the world with great force in order to turn the amorphous[* amorphous- having no definite form or distinct shape] and chaotic realm ofperception into the orderly world of awareness.Don Juan also told us that the second attention served the function of abeckoner; a caller of chances. The more it is exercised, the greater thepossibility of getting the desired result. But that was also the function ofattention in general; a function so taken for granted in our daily life that ithas become unnoticeable. If we encounter a fortuitous [* fortuitous- occurringby happy chance] occurrence, we talk about it in terms of accident orcoincidence, rather than in terms of our attention having beckoned the event.Don Juan's discussion of the second attention prepared the ground for anotherkey topic; the dreaming body. As a means of guiding la Gorda to it, don Juangave her the task of immobilizing her second attention as steadily as she couldon the components of the feeling of flying in dreaming.\"How did you learn to fly in dreaming?\" I asked her. \"Did someone teach you?\"\"The Nagual Juan Matus taught me on this earth,\" she replied. \"And in dreaming,someone I could never see taught me. It was only a voice telling me what to do.The Nagual gave me the task of learning to fly in dreaming, and the voice taughtme how to do it. Then it took me years to teach myself to shift from my regularbody, the one you can touch, to my dreaming body.\"\"You have to explain this to me, Gorda\" I said.\"You were learning to get to your dreaming body when you dreamed that you gotout of your body,\" she continued. \"But, the way I see it, the Nagual did notgive you any specific task, so you went any old way you could.\"I, on the other hand, was given the task of using my dreaming body. The littlesisters had the same task. In my case, I once had a dream where I flew like akite. I told the Nagual about it because I had liked the feeling of gliding. Hetook it very seriously and turned it into a task. He said that as soon as onelearns to do dreaming, any dream that one can remember is no longer a dream.It's dreaming.\"I began then to seek flying in dreaming. But I couldn't set it up. The more Itried to influence my dreaming, the more difficult it got. The Nagual finallytold me to stop trying and let it come of its own accord. Little by little Istarted to fly in dreaming. That was when some voice began to tell me what todo. I've always felt it was a woman's voice.\"When I had learned to fly perfectly, the Nagual told me that every movement offlying which I did in dreaming I had to repeat while I was awake. You had thesame chance when the saber-toothed tiger was showing you how to breathe. But younever changed into a tiger in dreaming, so you couldn't properly try to do itwhile you were awake.\"But I did learn to fly in dreaming. By shifting my attention to my dreamingbody, I could fly like a kite while I was awake. I showed you my flying oncebecause I wanted you to see that I had learned to use my dreaming body, but youdidn't know what was going on.\"She was referring to a time she had scared me with the incomprehensible act ofactually bobbing up and down in the air like a kite. The event was so farfetchedfor me that I could not begin to understand it in any logical way. As usual whenthings of that nature confronted me, I would lump them into an amorphouscategory of \"perceptions under conditions of severe stress.\" I had argued thatin cases of severe stress, perception could be greatly distorted by the senses.My explanation did not explain anything, but seemed to keep my reason pacified.I told la Gorda that there must have been more to what she had called her shiftinto her dreaming body than merely repeating the action of flying.She thought for a while before answering.\"I think the Nagual must have told you, too,\" she said, \"that the only thingthat really counts in making that shift is anchoring the second attention. TheNagual said that attention is what makes the world. He was of course absolutelyright. He had reasons to say that. He was the master of attention.I suppose he left it up to me to find out that all I needed to shift into mydreaming body was to focus my attention on flying. What was important was tostore attention in dreaming; to observe everything I did in flying. That was theonly way of grooming my second attention. Once it was solid, just to focus itlightly on the details and feeling of flying brought more dreaming of flyinguntil it was routine for me to dream I was soaring through the air.\"In the matter of flying, then, my second attention was keen. When the Nagualgave me the task of shifting to my dreaming body he meant for me to turn on mysecond attention while I was awake. This is the way I understand it.\"The first attention, the attention that makes the world, can never becompletely overcome. It can only be turned off for a moment and replaced withthe second attention- providing that the body has stored enough of the secondattention. Dreaming is naturally a way of storing the second attention. So, Iwould say that in order to shift into your dreaming body when awake you have topractice dreaming until it comes out your ears.\"\"Can you get to your dreaming body any time you want?\" I asked.\"No. It's not that easy,\" she replied. \"I've learned to repeat the movements andfeelings of flying while I'm awake, and yet I can't fly every time I want to.There is always a barrier to my dreaming body. Sometimes I feel that the barrieris down. My body is free at those times and I can fly as if I were dreaming.\"I told la Gorda that in my case don Juan gave me three tasks to train my secondattention.The first was to find my hands in dreaming.Next he recommended that I should choose a locale, focus my attention on it, andthen do daytime dreaming and find out if I could really go there. He suggestedthat I should place someone I knew at the site, preferably a woman, in order todo two things; first to check subtle changes that might indicate that I wasthere in dreaming, and second, to isolate unobtrusive detail, which would beprecisely what my second attention would zero in on.The most serious problem the dreamer has in this respect is the unbendingfixation of the second attention on detail that would be thoroughly undetectedby the attention of everyday life, creating in this manner a nearlyinsurmountable obstacle to validation. What one seeks in dreaming is not whatone would pay attention to in everyday life.Don Juan said that one strives to immobilize the second attention only in thelearning period. After that, one has to fight the almost invincible pull of thesecond attention and give only cursory glances at everything. In dreaming onehas to be satisfied with the briefest possible views of everything. As soon asone focuses on anything, one loses control.The last generalized task he gave me was to get out of my body. I had partiallysucceeded, and all along I had considered it my only real accomplishment indreaming. Don Juan left before I had perfected the feeling in dreaming that Icould handle the world of ordinary affairs while I was dreaming. His departureinterrupted what I thought was going to be an unavoidable overlapping of mydreaming time into my world of everyday life.To elucidate [* elucidate- make clear; free from confusion or ambiguity] thecontrol of the second attention, don Juan presented the idea of will. He saidthat will can be described as the maximum control of the luminosity of the bodyas a field of energy; or it can be described as a level of proficiency, or astate of being that comes abruptly into the daily life of a warrior at any giventime.It is experienced as a force that radiates out of the middle part of the bodyfollowing a moment of the most absolute silence, or a moment of sheer terror, orprofound sadness; but not after a moment of happiness, because happiness is toodisruptive to afford the warrior the concentration needed to use the luminosityof the body and turn it into silence.\"The Nagual told me that for a human being, sadness is as powerful as terror,\"la Gorda said. \"Sadness makes a warrior shed tears of blood. Both can bring themoment of silence. Or the silence comes of itself, because the warrior tries forit throughout his life.\"\"Have you ever felt that moment of silence yourself?\" I asked.\"I have, by all means, but I can't remember what it is like,\" she said. \"You andI have both felt it before and neither of us can remember anything about it. TheNagual said that it is a moment of blackness; a moment still more silent thanthe moment of shutting off the internal dialogue. That blackness, that silence,gives rise to the intent to direct the second attention; to command it; to makeit do things.\"This is why it's called will. The intent and the effect are will. The Nagualsaid that they are tied together. He told me all this when I was trying to learnflying in dreaming. The intent of flying produces the effect of flying.\"I told her that I had nearly written off the possibility of ever experiencingwill.\"You'll experience it,\" la Gorda said. \"The trouble is that you and I are notkeen enough to know what's happening to us. We don't feel our will because wethink that it should be something we know for sure that we are doing or feeling,like getting angry, for instance. Will is very quiet, unnoticeable. Will belongsto the other self.\"\"What other self, Gorda?\" I asked.\"You know what I'm talking about,\" she replied briskly. \"We are in our otherselves when we do dreaming. We have entered into our other selves countlesstimes by now, but we are not complete yet.\"There was a long silence. I conceded to myself that she was right in saying thatwe were not complete yet. I understood that as meaning that we were merelyapprentices of an inexhaustible art. But then the thought crossed my mind thatperhaps she was referring to something else. It was not a rational thought. Ifelt first something like a prickling sensation in my solar plexus and then Ihad the thought that perhaps she was talking about something else. Next I feltthe answer. It came to me in a block, a clump of sorts. I knew that all of itwas there, first at the tip of my sternum and then in my mind. My problem wasthat I could not disentangle what I knew fast enough to verbalize it.La Gorda did not interrupt my thought processes with further comments orgestures. She was perfectly quiet; waiting. She seemed to be internallyconnected to me to such a degree that there was no need for us to say anything.We sustained the feeling of communality with each other for a moment longer andthen it overwhelmed us both. La Gorda and I calmed down by degrees. I finallybegan to speak. Not that I needed to reiterate what we had felt and known incommon, but just to reestablish our grounds for discussion I told her that Iknew in what way we were incomplete, but that I could not put my knowledge intowords.\"There are lots and lots of things we know,\" she said. \"And yet we can't getthem to work for us because we really don't know how to bring them out of us.You've just begun to feel that pressure. I've had it for years. I know and yet Idon't know. Most of the time I trip over myself and sound like an imbecile whenI try to say what I know.\"I understood what she meant and I understood her at a physical level. I knewsomething thoroughly practical and self-evident about will and what la Gorda hadcalled the other self, and yet I could not utter a single word about what Iknew; not because I was reticent or bashful, but because I did not know where tobegin, or how to organize my knowledge.\"Will is such a complete control of the second attention that it is called theother self,\" la Gorda said after a long pause. \"In spite of all we've done, weknow only a tiny bit of the other self. The Nagual left it up to us to completeour knowledge. That's our task of remembering.\"She smacked her forehead with the palm of her hand, as if something had justcome to her mind.\"Holy Jesus! We are remembering the other self!\" she exclaimed, her voice almostbordering on hysteria. Then she calmed down and went on talking in a subduedtone. \"Evidently we've already been there and the only way of remembering it isthe way we're doing it, by shooting off our dreaming bodies while dreamingtogether.\"\"What do you mean, shooting off our dreaming bodies?\" I asked.\"You yourself have witnessed when Genaro used to shoot off his dreaming body,\"she said. \"It pops off like a slow bullet. It actually glues and unglues itselffrom the physical body with a loud crack.\"The Nagual told me that Genaro's dreaming body could do most of the things wenormally do. He used to come to you that way in order to jolt you. I know nowwhat the Nagual and Genaro were after. They wanted you to remember, and for thateffect Genaro used to perform incredible feats in front of your very eyes byshooting off his dreaming body. But to no avail.\"\"I never knew that he was in his dreaming body,\" I said.\"You never knew because you weren't watching,\" she said. \"Genaro tried to letyou know by attempting to do things that the dreaming body cannot do, likeeating, drinking, and so forth. The Nagual told me that Genaro used to joke withyou that he was going to shit and make the mountains tremble.\"\"Why can't the dreaming body do those things?\" I asked.\"Because the dreaming body cannot handle the intent of eating, or drinking,\" shereplied.\"What do you mean by that, Gordar\" I asked.\"Genaro's great accomplishment was that in his dreaming he learned the intent ofthe body,\" she explained. \"He finished what you had started to do. He coulddream his whole body as perfectly as it could be.\"But the dreaming body has a different intent from the intent of the physicalbody. For instance, the dreaming body can go through a wall, because it knowsthe intent of disappearing into thin air. The physical body knows the intent ofeating, but not the one of disappearing. For Genaro's physical body to gothrough a wall would be as impossible as for his dreaming body to eat.\"La Gorda was silent for a while as if measuring what she had just said. I wantedto wait before asking her any questions.\"Genaro had mastered only the intent of the dreaming body\" she said in a softvoice. \"Silvio Manuel, on the other hand, was the ultimate master of intent, Iknow now that the reason we can't remember his face is because he was not likeeverybody else.\"\"What makes you say that, Gorda?\" I asked.She started to explain what she meant, but she was incapable of speakingcoherently. Suddenly she smiled. Her eyes lit up.\"I've got it!\" she exclaimed. \"The Nagual told me that Silvio Manuel was themaster of intent because he was permanently in his other self. He was the realchief. He was behind everything the Nagual did. In fact, he's the one who madethe Nagual take care of you.\"I experienced a great physical discomfort upon hearing la Gorda say that. Inearly became sick to my stomach and made extraordinary efforts to hide it fromher. I turned my back to her and began to gag.She stopped talking for an instant and then proceeded as if she had made up hermind not to acknowledge my state. Instead, she began to yell at me. She saidthat it was time that we air our grievances. She confronted me with my feelingsof resentment after what happened in Mexico City. She added that my rancor wasnot because she had sided with the other apprentices against me, but because shehad taken part in unmasking me.I explained to her that all of those feelings had vanished from me. She wasadamant. She maintained that unless I faced them they would come back to me insome way. She insisted that my affiliation with Silvio Manuel was at the crux ofthe matter.I could not believe the changes of mood I went through upon hearing thatstatement. I became two people- one raving, foaming at the mouth- the othercalm, observing. I had a final painful spasm in my stomach and got ill. But itwas not a feeling of nausea that had caused the spasm. It was rather anuncontainable wrath.When I finally calmed down I was embarrassed at my behavior, and worried that anincident of that nature might happen to me again at another time.\"As soon as you accept your true nature, you'll be free from rage,\" la Gordasaid in a nonchalant tone.I wanted to argue with her, but I saw the futility of it. Besides, my attack ofanger had drained me of energy. I laughed at the fact that I did not know what Iwould do if she were right.The thought occurred to me then that if I could forget about the Nagual woman,anything was possible. I had a strange sensation of heat or irritation in mythroat, as if I had eaten hot spicy food. I felt a jolt of bodily alarm, just asthough I had seen someone sneaking behind my back, and I knew at that momentsomething I had had no idea I knew a moment before. La Gorda was right. SilvioManuel had been in charge of me.La Gorda laughed loudly when I told her that. She said that she had alsoremembered something about Silvio Manuel.\"I don't remember him as a person, as I remember the Nagual woman,\" she went on,\"but I remember what the Nagual told me about him.\"\"What did he tell you?\" I asked.\"He said that while Silvio Manuel was on this earth he was like Eligio. Hedisappeared once without leaving a trace and went into the other world. He wasgone for years. Then one day he returned. The Nagual said that Silvio Manuel didnot remember where he'd been or what he'd done, but his body had been changed.He had come back to the world, but he had come back in his other self.\"\"What else did he say, Gorda?\" I asked.\"I can't remember any more,\" she replied. \"It is as if I were looking through afog.\"I knew that if we pushed ourselves hard enough, we were going to find out rightthen who Silvio Manuel was. I told her so.\"The Nagual said that intent is present everywhere,\" la Gorda said all of asudden.\"What does that mean?\" I asked.\"I don't know,\" she said. \"I'm just voicing things that come to my mind. TheNagual also said that intent is what makes the world.\"I knew that I had heard those words before. I thought that don Juan must havealso told me the same thing and I had forgotten it.\"When did don Juan tell you that?\" I asked.\"I can't remember when,\" she said. \"But he told me that people, and all otherliving creatures for that matter, are the slaves of intent. We are in itsclutches. It makes us do whatever it wants. It makes us act in the world. Iteven makes us die.\"He said that when we become warriors, though, intent becomes our friend. Itlets us be free for a moment. At times it even comes to us as if it had beenwaiting around for us. He told me that he himself was only a friend of intent-unlike Silvio Manuel, who was the master of it.\"There were barrages [* barrage- the rapid and continuous delivery ofcommunication: the heavy fire of artillery to saturate an area rather than hit aspecific target] of hidden memories in me that fought to get out. They seemedabout to surface. I experienced a tremendous frustration for a moment and thensomething in me gave up. I became calm. I was no longer interested in findingout about Silvio Manuel.La Gorda interpreted my change of mood as a sign that we were not ready to faceour memories of Silvio Manuel.\"The Nagual showed all of us what he could do with his intent,\" she saidabruptly. \"He could make things appear by calling intent.\"He told me that if I wanted to fly, I had to summon the intent of flying. Heshowed me then how he himself could summon it, and jumped in the air and soaredin a circle, like a huge kite. Or he would make things appear in his hand. Hesaid that he knew the intent of many things and could call those things byintending them. The difference between him and Silvio Manuel was that SilvioManuel, by being the master of intent, knew the intent of everything.\"I told her that her explanation needed more explaining. She seemed to strugglearranging words in her mind.\"I learned the intent of flying,\" she said, \"by repeating all the feelings I hadwhile flying in dreaming. This was only one thing. The Nagual had learned in hislife the intent of hundreds of things.\"But Silvio Manuel went to the source itself. He tapped it. He didn't have tolearn the intent of anything. He was one with intent. The problem was that hehad no more desires because intent has no desire of its own, so he had to relyon the Nagual for volition. [* volition- the capability of conscious choice andintention] In other words, Silvio Manuel could do anything the Nagual wanted.The Nagual directed Silvio Manuel's intent. But since the Nagual had no desireseither, most of the time they didn't do anything.\" ============================================================="},{"pageContent":"8. The Right and the Left Side Awareness Our discussion of dreaming was most helpful to us, not only because it solvedour impasse in dreaming together, but because it brought its concepts to anintellectual level. Talking about it kept us busy. It allowed us to have amoment's pause in order to ease our agitation.One night while I was out running an errand I called la Gorda from a telephonebooth. She told me that she had been in a department store and had had thesensation that I was hiding there behind some mannequins on display. She wascertain I was teasing her and became furious with me. She rushed through thestore trying to catch me, to show me how angry she was. Then she realized thatshe was actually remembering something she had done quite often around me;having a tantrum. [* tantrum- a display of bad temper]In unison, we arrived then at the conclusion that it was time to try again ourdreaming together. As we talked, we felt a renewed optimism. I went homeimmediately.I very easily entered into the first state, restful vigil. I had a sensation ofbodily pleasure; a tingling radiating from my solar plexus, which wastransformed into the thought that we were going to have great results. Thatthought turned into a nervous anticipation. I became aware that my thoughts wereemanating from the tingling in the middle of my chest. The instant I turned myattention to it, however, the tingling stopped. It was like an electric currentthat I could switch on and off.The tingling began again, even more pronounced than before, and suddenly I foundmyself face to face with la Gorda. It was as if I had turned a corner and bumpedinto her. I became immersed in watching her. She was so absolutely real, soherself, that I had the urge to touch her. The most pure, unearthly affectionfor her burst out of me at that moment. I began to sob uncontrollably.La Gorda quickly tried to interlock our arms to stop my indulging, but she couldnot move at all. We looked around. There was no fixed tableau in front of oureyes; no static picture of any sort. I had a sudden insight and told la Gordathat it was because we had been watching each other that we had missed theappearance of the dreaming scene. Only after I had spoken did I realize that wewere in a new situation. The sound of my voice scared me. It was a strangevoice; harsh; unappealing. It gave me a feeling of physical revulsion.La Gorda replied that we had not missed anything, that our second attention hadbeen caught by something else. She smiled and made a puckering gesture with hermouth; a mixture of surprise and annoyance at the sound of her own voice.I found the novelty of talking in dreaming spellbinding, for we were notdreaming of a scene in which we talked, we were actually conversing. It requireda unique effort quite similar to my initial effort of walking down a stairway indreaming.I asked her whether she thought my voice sounded funny. She nodded and laughedout loud. The sound of her laughter was shocking. I remembered that don Genaroused to make the strangest and most frightening noises. La Gorda's laughter wasin the same category. The realization struck me then that la Gorda and I hadquite spontaneously entered into our dreaming bodies.I wanted to hold her hand. I tried but I could not move my arm. Because I hadsome experience with moving in that state, I willed myself to go to la Gorda'sside. My desire was to embrace her, but instead I moved in on her so close thatwe merged. I was aware of myself as an individual being, but at the same time Ifelt I was part of la Gorda. I liked that feeling immensely.We stayed merged until something broke our hold. I felt a command to examine theenvironment. As I looked, I clearly remembered having seen it before. We weresurrounded by small round mounds that looked exactly like sand dunes. They wereall around us in every direction as far as we could see. They seemed to be madeof something that looked like pale yellow sandstone, or rough granules ofsulphur. The sky was the same color, and was very low and oppressive. There werebanks of yellowish fog or some sort of yellow vapor that hung from certain spotsin the sky.I noticed then that la Gorda and I seemed to be breathing normally. I could notfeel my chest with my hands, but I was able to feel it expanding as I inhaled.The yellow vapors were obviously not harmful to us.We began to move in unison; slowly; cautiously; almost as if we were walking.After a short distance I got very fatigued and so did la Gorda. We were glidingjust over the ground, and apparently moving that way was very tiring to oursecond attention; it required an inordinate degree of concentration. We were notdeliberately mimicking our ordinary walk, but the effect was much the same as ifwe had been. To move required outbursts of energy, something like tinyexplosions, with pauses in between. We had no objective in our movement exceptmoving itself, so finally we had to stop.La Gorda spoke to me, her voice so faint that it was barely audible. She saidthat we were mindlessly going toward the heavier regions, and that if we kept onmoving in that direction, the pressure would get so great that we would die.We automatically turned around and headed back in the direction we had comefrom, but the feeling of fatigue did not let up. Both of us were so exhaustedthat we could no longer maintain our upright posture. We collapsed and quitespontaneously adopted the dreaming position.I woke up instantly in my study. La Gorda woke up in her bedroom.The first thing I told her upon awakening, was that I had been in that barrenlandscape several times before. I had seen at least two aspects of it; oneperfectly flat; the other covered with small mounds like sand dunes.As I was talking, I realized that I had not even bothered to confirm that we hadhad the same vision. I stopped and told her that I had gotten carried away by myown excitement. I had proceeded as if I were comparing notes with her about avacation trip.\"It's too late for that kind of talk between us,\" she said with a sigh, \"but ifit makes you happy, I'll tell you what we saw.\"She patiently described everything we had seen, said, and done. She added thatshe too had been in that deserted place before, and that she knew for a factthat it was a no-man's land; the space between the world we know and the otherworld.\"It is the area between the parallel lines,\" she went on. \"We can go to it indreaming. But in order to leave this world and reach the other, the one beyondthe parallel lines, we have to go through that area with our whole bodies.\"I felt a chill at the thought of entering that barren place with our wholebodies.\"You and I have been there together with our bodies,\" la Gorda went on. \"Don'tyou remember?\"I told her that all I could remember was seeing that landscape twice under donJuan's guidance. Both times I had written off the experience because it had beenbrought about by the ingestion of hallucinogenic plants. Following the dictumsof my intellect, I had regarded them as private visions and not as consensual [*consensual- existing with agreement by multiple individuals] experiences. I didnot remember viewing that scene under any other circumstances.\"When did you and I get there with our bodies?\" I asked.\"I don't know,\" she said. \"The vague memory of it just popped into my mind whenyou mentioned being there before. I think that now it is your turn to help mefinish what I have started to remember. I can't focus on it yet, but I do recallthat Silvio Manuel took the Nagual woman, you, and me into that desolate place.I don't know why he took us in there, though. We were not in dreaming.\"I did not hear what else she was saying. My mind had begun to zero in onsomething still inarticulate. [* inarticulate- without, or deprived of the useof speech or words] I struggled to set my thoughts in order. They rambledaimlessly. For a moment I felt as if I had reverted back years, to a time when Icould not stop my internal dialogue.Then the fog began to clear. My thoughts arranged themselves without myconscious direction, and the result was the full memory of an event which I hadalready partially recalled in one of those unstructured flashes of recollectionthat I used to have.La Gorda was right. We had been taken once to a region that don Juan had called'limbo' apparently drawing the term from religious dogma. I knew that la Gordawas also right in saying that we had not been in dreaming. On that occasion, at the request of Silvio Manuel, don Juan had rounded up theNagual woman, la Gorda, and myself. Don Juan told me that the reason for ourmeeting was the fact that, by my own means, but without knowing how, I hadentered into a special recess of awareness which was the site of the keenestform of attention.I had previously reached that state, which don Juan had called the 'left side',but all too briefly and always aided by him. One of its main features, the onethat had the greatest value for all of us involved with don Juan, was that inthat state we were able to perceive a colossal bank of yellowish vapor;something which don Juan called the 'wall of fog'.Whenever I was capable of perceiving it, it was always to my right; extendingforward to the horizon and up to infinity, thus dividing the world in two. Thewall of fog would turn either to the right or to the left as I turned my head,so there was never a way for me to face it.On the day in question, both don Juan and Silvio Manuel had talked to me aboutthe wall of fog. I remembered that after Silvio Manuel had finished talking, hegrabbed la Gorda by the nape of her neck as if she were a kitten, anddisappeared with her into the bank of fog.I had had a split second to observe their disappearance, because don Juan hadsomehow succeeded in making me face the wall myself. He did not pick me up bythe nape of the neck but pushed me into the fog; and the next thing I knew, Iwas looking at the desolate plain. Don Juan, Silvio Manuel, the Nagual woman,and la Gorda were also there. I did not care what they were doing.I was concerned with a most unpleasant and threatening feeling of oppression; afatigue; a maddening difficulty in breathing. I perceived that I was standinginside a suffocating, yellow, low ceilinged cave. The physical sensation ofpressure became so overwhelming that I could no longer breathe.It seemed that all my physical functions had stopped. I could not feel any partof my body, yet I still could: move, walk, extend my arms, rotate my head. I putmy hands on my thighs. There was no feeling in my thighs, nor in the palms of myhands. My legs and arms were visibly there, but not palpably [* palpably- as tobe capable of being perceived by the senses or the mind: being capable of beinghandled, or touched, or felt] there.Moved by the boundless fear I was feeling, I grabbed the Nagual woman by the armand yanked her off balance. But it was not my muscle strength that had pulledher. It was a force that was stored, not in my muscles or skeletal frame, but inthe very center of my body.Wanting to play that force once more, I grabbed la Gorda. She was rocked by thestrength of my pull. Then I realized that the energy to move them had come froma sticklike protuberance that acted upon them as a tentacle. It was balanced atthe midpoint of my body.All that had taken only an instant. The next moment I was back again at the samepoint of physical anguish and fear.I looked at Silvio Manuel in a silent plea for help. The way he returned my lookconvinced me that I was lost. His eyes were cold and indifferent.Don Juan turned his back to me and I shook from the inside out with a physicalterror beyond comprehension. I thought that the blood in my body was boiling,not because I felt heat, but because an internal pressure was mounting to thepoint of bursting.Don Juan commanded me to relax and abandon myself to my death. He said that Ihad to remain in there until I died.He said that I had a chance to either die peacefully- if I would make a supremeeffort and let my terror possess me; or I could die in agony if I chose to fightit.Silvio Manuel spoke to me, a thing he rarely did. He said that the energy Ineeded to accept my terror was in my middle point, and that the only way tosucceed was to acquiesce; [* acquiesce- to agree or express agreement] tosurrender without surrendering.The Nagual woman and la Gorda were perfectly calm. I was the only one who wasdying there. Silvio Manuel said that the way I was wasting energy, my end wasonly moments away, and that I should consider myself already dead. Don Juansignaled the Nagual woman and la Gorda to follow him. They turned their backs tome. I did not see what else they did.I felt a powerful vibration go through me. I figured that it was my deathrattle. My struggle was over. I did not care any more. I gave in to theunsurpassable terror that was killing me. My body, or the configuration Iregarded as my body, relaxed, abandoned itself to its death. As I let the terrorcome in, or perhaps go out of me, I felt and saw a tenuous vapor- a whitishsmear against the sulphur-yellow surroundings- leaving my body.Don Juan came back to my side and examined me with curiosity. Silvio Manuelmoved away and grabbed la Gorda again by the nape of her neck. I clearly saw himhurling her, like a giant rag doll, into the fog bank. Then he stepped inhimself and disappeared.The Nagual woman made a gesture to invite me to come into the fog. I movedtoward her, but before I reached her, don Juan gave me a forceful shove thatpropelled me through the thick yellow fog. I did not stagger but glided through,and ended up falling headlong onto the ground in the everyday world.La Gorda remembered the whole affair as I narrated it to her. Then she addedmore details.\"The Nagual woman and I were not afraid for your life,\" she said. \"The Nagualhad told us that you had to be forced to give up your holdings, but that wasnothing new. Every male warrior has to be forced by fear.\"Silvio Manuel had already taken me behind that wall three times so that I wouldlearn to relax. He said that if you saw me at ease, you would be affected by it,and you were. You gave up and relaxed.\"\"Did you also have a hard time learning to relax?\" I asked. \"No. It's a cinchfor a woman,\" she said. \"That's our advantage. The only problem is that we haveto be transported through the fog. We can't do it on our own.\"\"Why not, Gorda?\" I asked.\"One needs to be very heavy to go through and a woman is light,\" she said. \"Toolight, in fact.\"\"What about the Nagual woman? I didn't see anyone transporting her,\" I said.\"The Nagual woman was special,\" la Gorda said. \"She could do everything byherself. She could take me in there, or take you. She could even pass throughthat deserted plain; a thing which the Nagual said was mandatory for alltravelers who journey into the unknown.\"\"Why did the Nagual woman go in there with me?\" I asked.\"Silvio Manuel took us along to buttress [* buttress- make stronger ordefensible with supports] you,\" she said. \"He thought that you needed theprotection of two females and two males flanking you. Silvio Manuel thought thatyou needed to be protected from the entities that roam and lurk in there. Alliescome from that deserted plain. And other things even more fierce.\"\"Were you also protected?\" I asked.\"I don't need protection,\" she said. \"I'm a woman. I'm free from all that. Butwe all thought that you were in a terrible fix. You were the Nagual, and a verystupid one. We thought that any of those fierce allies- or if you wish, callthem demons- could have blasted you, or dismembered you. That was what SilvioManuel said. He took us to flank your four corners.\"But the funny part was that neither the Nagual nor Silvio Manuel knew that youdidn't need us. We were supposed to walk for quite a while until you lost yourenergy. Then Silvio Manuel was going to frighten you by pointing out the alliesto you and beckoning them to come after you. He and the Nagual planned to helpyou little by little. That is the rule.\"But something went wrong. The minute you got in there, you went crazy. Youhadn't moved an inch and you were already dying. You were frightened to deathand you hadn't even seen the allies yet.\"Silvio Manuel told me that he didn't know what to do, so he said in your earthe last thing he was supposed to say to you, to give in, to surrender withoutsurrendering. You became calm at once all by yourself and they didn't have to doany of the things that they had planned. There was nothing for the Nagual andSilvio Manuel to do except to take us out of there.\"I told la Gorda that when I found myself back in the world there was someonestanding by me who helped me to stand up. That was all I could recollect.\"We were in Silvio Manuel's house,\" she said. \"I can now remember a lot aboutthat house. Someone told me, I don't know who, that Silvio Manuel found thathouse and bought it because it was built on a power spot.\"But someone else said that Silvio Manuel found the house, liked it, bought it,and then brought the power spot to it. I personally feel that Silvio Manuelbrought the power. I feel that his impeccability held the power spot on thathouse for as long as he and his companions lived there.\"When it was time for them to move away, the power of that spot vanished withthem, and the house became what it had been before Silvio Manuel found it, anordinary house.\"As la Gorda talked, my mind seemed to clear up further, but not enough to revealwhat had happened to us in that house that filled me with such sadness. Withoutknowing why, I was sure it had to do with the Nagual woman. Where was she?La Gorda did not answer when I asked her that. There was a long silence. Sheexcused herself, saying that she had to make breakfast. It was already morning.She left me by myself with a most painful, heavy heart. I called her back. Shegot angry and threw her pots on the floor. I understood why. In another session of dreaming together we went still deeper into theintricacies of the second attention. This took place a few days later. La Gordaand I, with no such expectation or effort, found ourselves standing together.She tried three or four times in vain to interlock her arm with mine. She spoketo me, but her speech was incomprehensible. I knew, however, that she was sayingthat we were again in our dreaming bodies. She was cautioning me that allmovement should stem from our midsections.As in our last attempt, no dreaming scene presented itself for our examination,but I seemed to recognize a physical locale which I had seen in dreaming nearlyevery day for over a year: It was the valley of the saber-toothed tiger.We walked a few yards. This time our movements were not jerky or explosive. Weactually walked from the belly with no muscular action involved. The trying partwas my lack of practice. It was like the first time I had ridden a bicycle. Ieasily got tired and lost my rhythm. I became hesitant and unsure of myself. Westopped. La Gorda was out of synchronization, too.We began then to examine what was around us. Everything had an indisputablereality, at least to the eye. We were in a rugged area with a weird vegetation.I could not identify the strange shrubs I saw. They seemed like small trees,five to six feet high. They had a few leaves, which were flat and thick,chartreuse in color; and huge, gorgeous, deep-brown flowers striped with gold.The stems were not woody, but seemed to be light and pliable, like reeds; theywere covered with long, formidable looking needlelike thorns. Some old deadplants that had dried up and fallen to the ground gave me the impression thatthe stems were hollow.The ground was very dark and seemed moist. I tried to bend over to touch it, butI failed to move. La Gorda signaled me to use my midsection. When I did that Idid not have to bend over to touch the ground. There was something in me like atentacle which could feel.But I could not tell what I was feeling. There were no particular tactilequalities on which to base distinctions. The ground that I touched appeared tobe soil, not to my sense of touch but to what seemed to be a visual core in me.I was plunged then into an intellectual dilemma. Why would dreaming seem to bethe product of my visual faculty? Was it because of the predominance of thevisual in daily life? The questions were meaningless. I was in no position toanswer them, and all my queries did was to debilitate my second attention.La Gorda jolted me out of my deliberations by ramming me. I experienced asensation like a blow. A tremor ran through me. She pointed ahead of us. Asusual, the saber-toothed tiger was lying on the ledge where I had always seenit. We approached until we were a mere six feet from the ledge and we had tolift our heads to see the tiger. We stopped. It stood up. Its size wasstupendous, especially its breadth.I knew that la Gorda wanted us to sneak around the tiger to the other side ofthe hill. I wanted to tell her that that might be dangerous, but I could notfind a way to convey the message to her. The tiger seemed angry; aroused. Itcrouched back on its hind legs, as if it were preparing to jump on us. I wasterrified.La Gorda turned to me, smiling. I understood that she was telling me not tosuccumb to my panic because the tiger was only a ghostlike image. With amovement of her head, she coaxed me to go on. Yet at an unfathomable level, Iknew that the tiger was an entity, perhaps not in the factual sense of our dailyworld, but real nonetheless. And because la Gorda and I were dreaming, we hadlost our own 'factuality in the world'. At that moment we were on a par with thetiger; our existence also was ghostlike.We took one more step at the nagging insistence of la Gorda. The tiger jumpedfrom the ledge. I saw its enormous body hurtling through the air coming directlyat me. I lost the sense that I was dreaming. To me, the tiger was real and I wasgoing to be ripped apart. A barrage of lights, images, and the most intenseprimary colors I had ever seen flashed all around me. I woke up in my study. After we became extremely proficient in our dreaming together, I had thecertainty that we had managed to secure our detachment; and we were no longer ina hurry. The outcome of our efforts was not what moved us to act.It was rather an ulterior compulsion that gave us the impetus to act impeccablywithout thought of reward. Our subsequent sessions were like the first exceptfor the speed and ease with which we entered into the second state of dreaming,dynamic vigil.Our proficiency in dreaming together was such that we successfully repeated itevery night. Without any such intention on our part, our dreaming togetherfocused itself randomly on three areas: on the sand dunes, on the habitat of thesaber-toothed tiger, and most important, on forgotten past events.When the scenes that confronted us had to do with forgotten events in which laGorda and I had played an important role, she had no difficulty in interlockingher arm with mine. That act gave me an irrational sense of security. La Gordaexplained that it fulfilled a need to dispel the utter aloneness that the secondattention produces. She said that to interlock the arms promoted a mood ofobjectivity, and as a result, we could watch the activity that took place inevery scene. At times we were compelled to be part of the activity. At othertimes we were thoroughly objective and watched the scene as if we were in amovie theater.When we visited the sand dunes or the habitat of the tiger, we were unable tointerlock arms. In those instances our activity was never the same twice. Ouractions were never premeditated, but seemed to be spontaneous reactions to novelsituations.According to la Gorda, most of our dreaming together grouped itself into threecategories. The first and by far the largest was a reenactment of events we hadlived together. The second was a review that both of us did of events I alonehad \"lived\"- the land of the saber-toothed tiger was in this category. The thirdwas an actual visit to a realm that existed as we saw it at the moment of ourvisit. She contended that those yellow mounds are present here and now, and thatthat is the way they look and stand always to the warrior who journeys intothem.I wanted to argue a point with her. She and I had had mysterious interactionswith people we had forgotten for reasons inconceivable to us; but whom we hadnonetheless known in fact. The saber-toothed tiger, on the other hand, was acreature of my dreaming. I could not conceive both of them to be in the samecategory.Before I had time to voice my thoughts, I got her answer. It was as if she wereactually inside my mind reading it like a text.\"They are in the same class,\" she said, and laughed nervously. \"We can't explainwhy we have forgotten, or how it is that we are remembering now. We can'texplain anything. The saber-toothed tiger is there, somewhere. We'll never knowwhere. But why should we worry about a made-up inconsistency? To say that one isa fact and the other a dream has no meaning whatever to the other self.\" La Gorda and I used dreaming together as a means of reaching an unimagined worldof hidden memories. Dreaming together enabled us to recollect events that wewere incapable of retrieving with our 'everyday life' memory. When we rehashedthose events in our waking hours, it triggered yet more detailed recollections.In this fashion we disinterred, [* disinterred- dig up dead bodies for reburialor for medical investigation] so to speak, masses of memories that had beenburied in us. It took us almost two years of prodigious [* prodigious- so greatin size, force, or extent as to elicit awe] effort and concentration to arriveat a modicum [* modicum- a small or moderate or token amount] of understandingof what had happened to us.Don Juan had told us that human beings are divided in two. The right side, whichhe called the tonal, encompasses everything the intellect can conceive of. Theleft side, called the nagual, is a realm of indescribable features; a realmimpossible to contain in words. The left side is perhaps comprehended, ifcomprehension is what takes place, with the total body; thus its resistance toconceptualization. [* conceptualization- inventing or contriving an idea orexplanation and formulating it mentally]Don Juan had also told us that all the faculties, possibilities, andaccomplishments of sorcery, from the simplest to the most astounding, are in thehuman body itself.Taking as a base the concepts that we are divided in two and that everything isin the body itself, la Gorda proposed an explanation of our memories.She believed that during the years of our association with the Nagual JuanMatus, our time was divided between: states of normal awareness, on the rightside, the tonal, where the first attention prevails; and states of heightenedawareness, on the left side, the nagual, or the site of the second attention.La Gorda thought that the Nagual Juan Matus's efforts were to lead us to theother self by means of our self-control of the second attention throughdreaming.However, he put us in direct touch with the second attention through bodilymanipulation. La Gorda remembered that he used to force her to go from one sideto the other by pushing or massaging her back. She said that sometimes he wouldeven give her a sound blow over or around her right shoulder blade.The result was her entrance into an extraordinary state of clarity. To la Gorda,it seemed that everything in that state went faster, yet nothing in the worldhad been changed.It was weeks after la Gorda told me this that I remembered the same had been thecase with me. At any given time, don Juan might give me a blow on my back. Ialways felt the blow on my spine, high between my shoulder blades. Anextraordinary clarity would follow. The world was the same but sharper.Everything stood by itself. It may have been that my reasoning faculties werenumbed by don Juan's blow, thus allowing me to perceive without theirintervention.I would stay clear indefinitely or until don Juan would give me another blow onthe same spot to make me revert back to a normal state of awareness. He neverpushed or massaged me. It was always a direct sound blow- not like the blow of afist, but rather a smack that took my breath away for an instant. I would haveto gasp and take long, fast gulps of air until I could breathe normally again.La Gorda reported the same effect:. All the air would be forced out of her lungsby the Nagual's blow and she would have to breathe extra hard to fill them upagain. La Gorda believed that breath was the all-important factor. In heropinion, the gulps of air that she had to take after being struck were what madethe difference, yet she could not explain in what way breathing would affect herperception and awareness. She also said that she was never hit back into normalawareness. She reverted back to it by her own means, although without knowinghow.Her remarks seemed relevant to me. As a child, and even as an adult, I hadoccasionally had the wind knocked out of me when I took a fall on my back. Butthe effect of don Juan's blow, though it left me breathless, was not like thatat all. There was no pain involved. Instead it brought on a sensation impossibleto describe.The closest I can come is to say that it created a feeling like dryness in me.The blows to my back seemed to dry out my lungs and fog up everything else.Then, as la Gorda had observed, everything that had become hazy after theNagual's blow became crystal clear as I breathed, as if breath were thecatalyst; [* catalyst- something that causes an important event to happen] theall-important factor.The same thing would happen to me on the way back to the awareness of everydaylife. The air would be knocked out of me, the world I was watching would becomefoggy, and then it would clear as I filled up my lungs.Another feature of those states of heightened awareness was the incomparablerichness of personal interaction; a richness that our bodies understood as asensation of speeding. Our back and forth movement between the right and theleft sides made it easier for us to realize that on the right side too muchenergy and time is consumed in the actions and interactions of our daily life.On the left side, on the other hand, there is an inherent need for economy andspeed.La Gorda could not describe what this speed really was, and neither could I. Thebest I could do would be to say that on the left side I could grasp the meaningof things with precision and directness. Every facet of activity was free ofpreliminaries or introductions.I acted and rested. I went forth and retreated without any of the thoughtprocesses that are usual to me. This was what la Gorda and I understood asspeeding.La Gorda and I discerned at one moment that the richness of our perception onthe left side was a post-facto realization. Our interaction appeared to be richin the light of our capacity to remember it. We became cognizant then that inthese states of heightened awareness we had perceived everything in one clump;one bulky mass of inextricable detail. We called this ability to perceiveeverything at once intensity.For years we had found it impossible to examine the separate constituent partsof those chunks of experience. We had been unable to synthesize those parts intoa sequence that would make sense to the intellect. Since we were incapable ofthose syntheses, we could not remember.Our incapacity to remember was in reality an incapacity to put the memory of ourperception on a linear basis. We could not lay our experiences flat, so tospeak, and arrange them in a sequential order. The experiences were available tous, but at the same time they were impossible to retrieve because they wereblocked by a wall of intensity.The task of remembering, then, was properly the task of joining our left andright sides; of reconciling those two distinct forms of perception into aunified whole. It was the task of consolidating the totality of oneself byrearranging intensity into a linear sequence.It occurred to us that the activities we remembered taking part in might nothave taken long to perform in terms of time measured by the clock. By reason ofour capacity to perceive in terms of intensity, we may have had only asubliminal sensation of lengthy passages of time. La Gorda felt that if we couldrearrange intensity into a linear sequence, we would honestly believe that wehad lived a thousand years.The pragmatic [* pragmatic- guided by practical experience and observationrather than theory] step that don Juan took to aid our task of remembering wasto make us interact with certain people while we were in a state of heightenedawareness. He was very careful not to let us see those people when we were in astate of normal awareness. In this way he created the appropriate conditions forremembering.Upon completing our remembering, la Gorda and I entered into a bizarre state. Wehad detailed knowledge of social interactions which we had shared with don Juanand his companions.These were not memories in the sense that I would remember an episode from mychildhood. They were more than vivid moment to moment recollections of events.We reconstructed conversations that seemed to be reverberating in our ears, asif we were listening to them.Both of us felt that it was superfluous [* superfluous- serving no usefulpurpose] to try to speculate about what was happening to us. What we remembered,from the point of view of our experiential selves, was taking place now. Suchwas the character of our remembering.At last la Gorda and I were able to answer the questions that had driven us sohard. We remembered who the Nagual woman was, where she fit among us, what herrole had been. We deduced, more than remembered, that we had spent equal amountsof time with don Juan and don Genaro in normal states of awareness, and with donJuan and his other companions in states of heightened awareness. We recapturedevery nuance of those interactions which had been veiled by intensity.Upon a thoughtful review of what we had found, we realized that we had bridgedthe two sides of ourselves in a minimal fashion. We turned then to other topics;new questions that had come to take precedence over the old ones.There were three subjects, three questions, that summarized all of our concerns.Who was don Juan and who were his companions? What had they really done to us?And where had all of them gone?================================================================= Part three: The Eagle's Gift"},{"pageContent":"9. The Rule of the Nagual Don Juan had been extremely sparing with information about his background andpersonal life. His reticence [* reticence- not volunteering anything more thannecessary] was, fundamentally, a didactic [* didactic- instructive] device. Asfar as he was concerned, his time began when he became a warrior. Anything thathad happened to him before was of very little consequence.All la Gorda and I knew about his early life was that he was born in Arizona ofYaqui and Yuma Indian parentage. When he was still an infant, his parents tookhim to live with the Yaquis in northern Mexico. At ten years of age he wascaught in the tide of the Yaqui wars. His mother was killed then, and his fatherwas apprehended by the Mexican army. Both don Juan and his father were sent to arelocation center in the farthest southern state of Yucatan. He grew up there.Whatever happened to him during that period was never disclosed to us. Don Juanbelieved there was no need to tell us about it. I felt otherwise. The importancethat I gave to that segment of his life arose from my erroneous conviction thatthe distinctive features and the emphasis of his leadership grew out of thatpersonal inventory of experience.But that inventory, important as it might have been, was not what gave him theparamount significance he had in our eyes and in the eyes of his othercompanions. His total preeminence [* preeminence- high status importance owingto marked superiority] rested on the fortuitous act of becoming involved withthe 'rule.'Being involved with the rule may be described as living a myth. Don Juan lived amyth, a myth that caught him and made him the Nagual.Don Juan said that when the rule caught him, he was an aggressive, unruly man;living in exile as thousands of other Yaqui Indians from northern Mexico livedat that time. He worked in the tobacco plantations of southern Mexico.One day after work, in a nearly fatal encounter with a fellow worker overmatters of money, he was shot in the chest.When he regained consciousness an old Indian was leaning over him, poking thesmall wound in his chest with his fingers. The bullet had not penetrated thechest cavity, but was lodged in the muscle against a rib. Don Juan fainted twoor three times from shock, loss of blood, and in his own words, from fear ofdying. The old Indian removed the bullet, and since don Juan had no place tostay, the old Indian took don Juan to his own house and nursed him for over amonth.The old Indian was kind but severe. One day when don Juan was fairly strong andalmost recovered, the old man gave him a sound blow on his back and forced himinto a state of heightened awareness. Then, without any further preliminaries,he revealed to don Juan the portion of the rule which pertained to the Nagualand his role.Don Juan did exactly the same thing with me and with la Gorda. He made us shiftlevels of awareness, and told us the rule of the Nagual in the following way: The power that governs the destiny of all living beings is called the Eagle, notbecause it is an eagle or has anything to do with an eagle, but because itappears to the seer as an immeasurable jet-black eagle, standing erect as aneagle stands; its height reaching to infinity.As the seer gazes on the blackness that the Eagle is, four blazes of lightreveal what the Eagle is like.The first blaze, which is like a bolt of lightning, helps the seer make out thecontours of the Eagle's body. There are patches of whiteness that look like aneagle's feathers and talons.A second blaze of lightning reveals the flapping, wind-creating blackness thatlooks like an eagle's wings.With the third blaze of lightning, the seer beholds a piercing, inhuman eye.The fourth and last blaze discloses what the Eagle is doing...The Eagle is devouring the awareness of all the creatures that a moment beforewere alive on earth, are now dead, and have floated to the Eagle's beak like aceaseless swarm of fireflies to meet their owner; this being their reason forhaving had life.The Eagle disentangles these tiny flames, lays them flat like a tanner stretchesout a hide, and then consumes them; for awareness is the Eagle's food.The Eagle- the power that governs the destinies of all living things- reflectsequally and at once all those living things.There is no way, therefore, for man to pray to the Eagle, to ask favors, or tohope for grace. The human part of the Eagle is too insignificant to move thewhole. It is only from the Eagle's actions that a seer can tell what it wants. TheEagle, although it is not moved by the circumstances of any living thing, hasgranted a gift to each of those beings.In those beings' own way, and by right, any one of them, if it so desires, hasthe power to keep the flame of awareness; the power to disobey the summons to'die and be consumed'.Every living thing has been granted the power, if it so desires, to seek anopening to freedom and to go through it. It is evident to the seer who sees theopening, and to the creatures that go through it, that the Eagle has grantedthat gift in order to perpetuate awareness. For the purpose of guiding living things to that opening, the Eagle created theNagual. The Nagual is a double being to whom the rule has been revealed.Whether the Nagual be in the form of a human being, an animal, a plant, oranything else that lives; the Nagual by virtue of its doubleness is drawn toseek that hidden passageway.In human beings, the Nagual comes in pairs; male and female. A double man and adouble woman become the Nagual only after the rule has been told to each ofthem, and each of them has understood it and accepted it in full.To the eye of the seer, a Nagual man or Nagual woman appears as a luminous eggwith four compartments.Unlike the average human being who has two sides only- a left and a right- theNagual has a left side divided into two long sections, and a right side equallydivided in two.The Eagle created the first Nagual man and Nagual woman as seers and immediatelyput them in the world to see.The Eagle provided them with four female warriors who were stalkers; three malewarriors; and one male courier- whom the Nagual pair were to nourish, enhance,and lead to freedom.The female warriors are called the four directions; the four corners of asquare; the four moods; the four winds; and are the four different femalepersonalities that exist in the human race.The first is the east. She is called order. She is optimistic, light-hearted,smooth, and persistent; like a steady breeze.The second is the north. She is called strength. She is resourceful, blunt,direct, and tenacious; like a hard wind.The third is the west. She is called feeling. She is introspective, remorseful,cunning, and sly; like a cold gust of wind.The fourth is the south. She is called growth. She is nurturing, loud, shy, andwarm; like a hot wind.The three male warriors and the courier are representative of the four types ofmale activity and temperament.The first type is the knowledgeable man; the scholar; a noble, dependable, andserene man fully dedicated to accomplishing his task, whatever it may be.The second type is the man of action; highly volatile, and a great humorous,fickle companion.The third type is the organizer behind the scenes: the mysterious, unknowableman. Nothing can be said about him because he allows nothing about himself toslip out.The courier is the fourth type. He is the assistant; a taciturn, [* taciturn-habitually reserved and uncommunicative] somber man who does very well ifproperly directed, but who cannot stand on his own.In order to make things easier, the Eagle showed the Nagual man and Nagual womanthat each of these types among men and women of the earth has specific featuresin their luminous bodies.The scholar has a sort of shallow dent; a bright depression at his solar plexus.In some men it appears as a pool of intense luminosity; sometimes smooth andshiny like a mirror without a reflection.The man of action has some fibers emanating from the area of the will. Thenumber of fibers varies from one to five, and their size ranges from a merestring to a thick, whiplike tentacle up to eight feet long. Some men of actionhave as many as three of these fibers developed into tentacles.The man behind the scenes is recognized not by a feature, but by his ability tocreate, quite involuntarily, a burst of power that effectively blocks theattention of seers. When in the presence of this type of man, seers findthemselves immersed in extraneous detail rather than seeing.The assistant has no obvious configuration. To seers he appears as a clear glowin a flawless shell of luminosity.In the female realm, the east is recognized by the almost imperceptible blotchesin her luminosity; something like small areas of discoloration.The north has an overall radiation. She exudes a reddish glow, almost like heat.The west has a tenuous film enveloping her, a film which makes her appear darkerthan the others.The south has an intermittent glow; she shines for a moment and then gets dull,only to shine again.The Nagual man and the Nagual woman have two different movements in theirluminous bodies. Their right sides wave, while their left sides whirl.In terms of personality, the Nagual man is supportive, steady, unchangeable. TheNagual woman is a being at war and yet relaxed; ever aware but without strain.Both of them reflect the four types of their sex; as four ways of behaving. The first command that the Eagle gave the Nagual man and Nagual woman was tofind, on their own, another set of four female warriors, four directions, whowere the exact replicas of the stalkers but who were dreamers.Dreamers appear to a seer as having an apron of hairlike fibers at theirmidsections. Stalkers have a similar apronlike feature, but instead of fibersthe apron consists of countless small, round protuberances.The eight female warriors are divided into two bands, which are called the rightand left planets. The right planet is made up of four stalkers, the left of fourdreamers. The warriors of each planet were taught by the Eagle the rule of theirspecific task: stalkers were taught stalking; dreamers were taught dreaming.The two female warriors of each direction live together. They are so alike thatthey mirror each other, and only through impeccability can they find solace andchallenge in each other's reflection.The only time when the four dreamers or four stalkers get together is when theyhave to accomplish a strenuous task.But only under special circumstances should the four of them join hands becausetheir touch fuses them into one being. This should be done only in cases of direneed, or at the moment of leaving this world.The two female warriors of each direction are attached to one of the males, inany combination that is necessary. Thus they make a set of four households whichare capable of incorporating as many warriors as needed.The male warriors and the courier can also form an independent unit of four men,or each can function as a solitary being as dictated by necessity. Next the Nagual and his party were commanded to find three more couriers. Thesecould be all males or all females or a mixed set, but the male couriers had tobe of the fourth type of man, the assistant, and the females had to be from thesouth. In order to make sure that the first Nagual man would lead his party to freedomand not deviate from that path or become corrupted, the Eagle took the Nagualwoman to the other world to serve as a beacon, guiding the party to the opening. The Nagual and his warriors were then commanded to forget.They were plunged into darkness and were given new tasks; the task ofremembering themselves, and the task of remembering the Eagle.The command to forget was so great that everyone was separated. They did notremember who they were. The Eagle intended that if they were capable ofremembering themselves again, they would find the totality of themselves.Only then would they have the strength and forebearance necessary to seek andface their definitive journey. Their last task, after they had regained the totality of themselves, was to geta new pair of double beings and transform them into a new Nagual man and a newNagual woman by virtue of revealing the rule to them.And just as the first Nagual man and Nagual woman had been provided with aminimal party, they had to supply the new pair of Naguals with four femalewarriors who were stalkers, three male warriors, and one male courier. When the first Nagual and his party were ready to go through the passageway, thefirst Nagual woman was waiting to guide them.They were ordered then to take the new Nagual woman with them to the other worldto serve as a beacon for her people, leaving the new Nagual man in the world torepeat the cycle.While in the world, the minimal number under a Nagual's leadership is sixteen:eight female warriors, three male warriors, four couriers, and the Nagualhimself.At the moment of leaving the world when the new Nagual woman is with them, theNagual's number is seventeen. If his personal power permits him to have morewarriors, then more must be added in multiples of four. I had confronted don Juan with the question of how the rule became known to man.He explained that the rule was endless and covered every facet of a warrior'sbehavior. The interpretation and the accumulation of the rule is the work ofseers whose only task throughout the ages has been to see the Eagle; to observeits ceaseless flux.From their observations, the seers have concluded that, providing the luminousshell that comprises one's humanness has been broken, it is possible to find inthe Eagle the faint reflection of man. The Eagle's irrevocable dictums can thenbe apprehended by seers, properly interpreted by them, and accumulated in theform of a governing body.Don Juan explained that the rule was not a tale, and that to cross over tofreedom did not mean eternal life as eternity is commonly understood- that is,as living forever.What the rule stated was that one could keep the awareness which is ordinarilyrelinquished at the moment of dying.Don Juan could not explain what it meant to keep that awareness, or perhaps hecould not even conceive of it. His benefactor had told him that at the moment ofcrossing, one enters into the third attention, and the body in its entirety iskindled with knowledge. Every cell at once becomes aware of itself, and alsoaware of the totality of the body.His benefactor had also told him that this kind of awareness is meaningless toour compartmentalized minds. Therefore the crux of the warrior's struggle wasnot so much to realize that the crossing over stated in the rule meant crossingto the third attention, but rather to conceive that there exists such anawareness at all.Don Juan said that in the beginning the rule was to him something strictly inthe realm of words. He could not imagine how it could lapse into the domain ofthe actual world and its ways.Under the effective guidance of his benefactor, however, and after a great dealof work, he finally succeeded in grasping the true nature of the rule, andtotally accepted it as a set of pragmatic directives rather than a myth. Fromthen on, he had no problem in dealing with the reality of the third attention.The only obstacle in his way arose from his being so thoroughly convinced thatthe rule was a map that he believed he had to look for a literal opening in theworld, a passageway. Somehow he had become needlessly stuck at the first levelof a warrior's development.Don Juan's own work as a leader and teacher, as a result, was directed athelping the apprentices, and especially me, to avoid repeating his mistake. Whathe succeeded in doing with us was to lead us through the three stages of awarrior's development without overemphasizing any of them.First he guided us to take the rule as a map; then he guided us to theunderstanding that one can attain a paramount awareness, because there is such athing; and finally he guided us to an actual passageway into that otherconcealed world of awareness.In order to lead us through the first stage, the acceptance of the rule as amap, don Juan took the section which pertains to the Nagual and his role andshowed us that it corresponds to unequivocal facts.He accomplished this by allowing us to have, while we were in stages ofheightened awareness, an unrestricted interaction with the members of his group,who were the living personifications of the eight types of people described bythe rule.As we interacted with them, more complex and inclusive aspects of the rule wererevealed to us, until we were capable of realizing that we were caught in thenetwork of something which at first we had conceptualized as a myth, but whichin essence was a map.Don Juan told us that in this respect his case had been identical to ours. Hisbenefactor helped him go through that first stage by allowing him the same typeof interaction. To that effect he made him shift back and forth from the rightside to the left side awareness, just as don Juan had done to us. On the leftside, he introduced him to the members of his own group, the eight female andthree male warriors, and the four couriers, who were, as is mandatory, thestrictest examples of the types described by the rule.The impact of knowing them and dealing with them was staggering to don Juan. Notonly did it force him to regard the rule as a factual guide, but it made himrealize the magnitude of our unknown possibilities.He said that by the time all the members of his own group had been gathered, hewas so deeply committed to the warrior's way that he took for granted the factthat, without any overt effort on anybody's part, they had turned out to beperfect replicas of the warriors of his benefactor's party. The similarity oftheir personal likes, dislikes, affiliations, and so forth, was not a result ofimitation. Don Juan said that they belonged, as the rule had stated, to specificblocks of people who had the same input and output. The only differences amongmembers of the same block were in the pitch of their voices, and the sound oftheir laughter.In trying to explain to me the effects that the interaction with hisbenefactor's warriors had had on him, don Juan touched on the subject of thevery meaningful difference between his benefactor and himself in how theyinterpreted the rule; and also in how they led and taught other warriors toaccept it as a map.He said that there are two types of interpretations- universal and individual.Universal interpretations take the statements that make up the body of the ruleat face value. An example would be to say that the Eagle does not care aboutman's actions and yet it has provided man with a passageway to freedom.An individual interpretation, on the other hand, is a current conclusion arrivedat by seers using universal interpretation's as premises. An example would be tosay that because of the Eagle's lack of concern, I would have to make sure thatmy chances to reach freedom are enhanced, perhaps by my own dedication.According to don Juan, he and his benefactor were quite different in the methodsthey used to lead their wards. Don Juan said that his benefactor's mode wasseverity; he led with an iron hand, and following his conviction that with theEagle free handouts are out of the question, he never did anything for anyone ina direct way. Instead, he actively helped everyone to help themselves. Heconsidered that the Eagle's gift of freedom is not a bestowal but a chance tohave a chance.Don Juan, although he appreciated the merits of his benefactor's method,disagreed with it. Later on, when he was on his own, he himself saw that itwasted precious time. For him it was more expedient to present everyone with agiven situation and force them to accept it, rather than wait until they wereready to face it on their own. That was his method with me and the otherapprentices.The instance in which that difference in leadership had the greatest bearing fordon Juan was during the mandatory interaction that he had with his benefactor'swarriors. The command of the rule was that his benefactor had to find for donJuan first a Nagual woman, and then a group of four women and four men to makeup his warrior's party.His benefactor saw that don Juan did not yet have enough personal power toassume the responsibility of a Nagual woman, and so he reversed the sequence andasked the females of his own group to find don Juan the four women first, andthen the four men.Don Juan confessed that he was enthralled with the idea of such a reversal. Hehad understood that those women were for his use, and in his mind that meantsexual use. His downfall, however, was to reveal his expectations to hisbenefactor who immediately put don Juan in contact with the men and women of hisown party and left him alone to interact with them.For don Juan, to meet those warriors was a true ordeal, not only because theywere deliberately difficult with him, but because the nature of that encounteris meant to be a breakthrough.Don Juan said that interaction in the left-side awareness cannot take placeunless all the participants share that state. This was why he would not let usenter into the left-side awareness except to carry on our interaction with hiswarriors. That was the procedure his benefactor had followed with him.Don Juan gave me a brief account of what had taken place during his firstmeeting with the members of his benefactor's group. His idea was that I coulduse his experience perhaps as a sample of what to expect.He said that his benefactor's world had a magnificent regularity. The members ofhis party were Indian warriors from all over Mexico. At the time he met themthey lived in a remote mountainous area in southern Mexico.Upon reaching their house, don Juan was confronted with two identical women, thebiggest Indian women he had ever seen. They were sulky and mean, but had verypleasing features.When he tried to go between them, they caught him between their enormousbellies, grabbed his arms, and started beating him up. They threw him to theground and sat on him, nearly crushing his rib cage. They kept him immobilizedfor over twelve hours while they conducted on-the-spot negotiations with hisbenefactor, who had to talk nonstop throughout the night until they finally letdon Juan get up around midmorning.He said that what scared him the most was the determination that showed in theeyes of those women. He thought he was done for; that they were going to sit onhim until he died, as they had said they would.Normally there should have been a waiting period of a few weeks before meetingthe next set of warriors, but due to the fact that his benefactor was planningto leave him in their midst, don Juan was immediately taken to meet the others.He met everyone in one day and all of them treated him like dirt.They argued that he was not the man for the job; that he was too coarse and waytoo stupid; young but already senile in his ways. His benefactor arguedbrilliantly in his defense. He told them that they could change thoseconditions, and that it should be an ultimate delight for them and for don Juanto take up that challenge.Don Juan said that his first impression was right. For him there was only workand hardship from then on. The women saw that don Juan was unruly and could notbe trusted to fulfill the complex and delicate task of leading four women.Since they were seers themselves, they made their own individual interpretationof the rule and decided that it would be more helpful for don Juan to have thefour male warriors first and then the four females. Don Juan said that theirseeing had been correct, because in order to deal with women warriors, a Nagualhas to be in a state of consummate personal power; a state of serenity andcontrol in which human feelings play a minimal part; a state which at the timewas inconceivable for him.His benefactor put him under the direct supervision of his two westerly women,the most fierce and uncompromising warriors of them all. Don Juan said that allwesterly women, in accordance with the rule, are raving mad and have to be caredfor. Under the duress of dreaming and stalking they lose their right sides,their minds. Their reason burns up easily due to the fact that their left-sideawareness is extraordinarily keen. Once they lose their rational side, they arepeerless dreamers and stalkers since they no longer have any rational ballast tohold them back.Don Juan said that those women cured him of his lust. For six months he spentmost of his time in a harness suspended from the ceiling of their rural kitchen,like a ham that was being smoked, until he was thoroughly purified from thoughtsof gain and personal gratification.Don Juan explained that a leather harness is a superb device for curing certainmaladies that are not physical. The idea is that the higher a person issuspended and the longer that person is kept from touching the ground bydangling in midair, the better the possibilities of a true cleansing effect.While he was being cleansed by the westerly warriors, the other women wereinvolved in the process of finding the men and the women for his party. It tookyears to accomplish this. Don Juan, in the meantime, was forced to interact withall his benefactor's warriors by himself.The presence of those warriors and his contact with them was so overwhelming todon Juan that he believed he would never get out from under them. The result washis total and literal adherence to the body of the rule. Don Juan said that he spent irreplaceable time pondering the existence of anactual passageway into the other world. He viewed such a concern as a pitfall tobe avoided at all costs. To protect me from it, he allowed the required interaction with the members of his group to be carried on while I was protected bythe presence of la Gorda or any of the other apprentices.In my case, meeting don Juan's warriors was the end result of a long process.There was never any mention of them in casual conversations with don Juan. Iknew of their existence solely by inference from the rule which he was revealingto me in installments. Later on, he admitted that they existed, and thateventually I would have to meet them. He prepared me for the encounter by givingme general instructions and pointers.He warned me about a common error; that of overestimating the left-sideawareness; of becoming dazzled by its clarity and power. He said that to be inthe left-side awareness does not mean that one is immediately liberated fromone's folly- it only means an extended capacity for perceiving, a greaterfacility to understand and learn, and above all, a greater ability to forget.As the time approached for me to meet don Juan's own warriors, he again gave mea scanty description of his benefactor's party as a guideline for my own use. Hesaid that to an onlooker, his benefactor's world may have appeared at certaintimes as consisting of four households. The first was formed by the southerlywomen and the Nagual's courier; the second by the easterly women, the scholar,and a male courier; the third by the northerly women, the man of action, andanother male courier; and the fourth by the westerly women, the man behind thescenes, and a third male courier.At other times that world may have seemed to be composed of groups. There was agroup of four thoroughly dissimilar older men, who were don Juan's benefactorand his three male warriors. Then a group of four men who were very similar toone another, who were the couriers. A group composed of two sets of apparentlyidentical female twins who lived together and were the southerly and easterlywomen.And two other sets of apparently sisters, who were the northerly and westerlywomen.None of these women were relatives- they just looked alike because of theenormous amount of personal power that don Juan's benefactor had. Don Juandescribed the southerly women as being two mastodons, scary in appearance butvery friendly and warm. The easterly women were very beautiful, fresh and funny,a true delight to the eyes and the ears. The northerly women were utterlywomanly, vain, coquettish, [* coquettish- like a seductive woman who uses hersex appeal to exploit men] concerned with their aging, but also terribly directand impatient. The westerly women were mad at times, and at other times theywere the epitome of severity and purpose. They were the ones who disturbed donJuan the most because he could not reconcile the fact that they were so sober,kind, and helpful, with the fact that at any given moment they could lose theircomposure and be raving mad.The men, on the other hand, were in no way memorable to don Juan. He thoughtthat there was nothing remarkable about them. They seemed to have beenthoroughly absorbed by the shocking force of the women's determination and byhis benefactor's overpowering personality.Insofar as his own awakening was concerned, don Juan said that upon being thrustinto his benefactor's world, he realized how easy and convenient it had been forhim to go through life with no self-restraint. He understood that his mistakehad been to believe that his goals were the only worthwhile ones a man couldhave.All his life he had been a pauper. His consuming ambition, therefore, was tohave material possessions; to be somebody. He had been so preoccupied with hisdesire to get ahead and his despair at not being successful, that he had had notime for examining anything. He had gladly sided with his benefactor because herealized that he was being offered an opportunity to make something of himself.If nothing else, he thought he might learn to be a sorcerer. He conceived thatimmersion in his benefactor's world might have an effect on him analogous to theeffect of the Spanish Conquest on the Indian culture. It destroyed everything,but it also forced a shattering self-examination. My response to the preparations to meet don Juan's party of warriors was not,strangely enough, awe or fear, but a petty intellectual concern about twotopics. The first was the proposition that there are only four types of men andfour types of women in the world. I argued with don Juan that the range ofindividual variation in people is too great for such a simple scheme. Hedisagreed with me. He said that the rule was final, and that it did not allowfor an indefinite number of types of people. The second topic was the cultural context of don Juan's knowledge. He did notknow that himself. He viewed it as the product of a sort of Pan-Indianism. Hisconjecture about its origin was that at one time, in the Indian world prior tothe Conquest, the handling of the second attention became vitiated. [* vitiated-ruined in character or quality]It was developed without any hindrance over perhaps thousands of years, to thepoint that it lost its strength. The practitioners of that time may have had noneed for controls, and thus without restraint, the second attention, instead ofbecoming stronger, became weaker by virtue of its increased intricacy.Then the Spanish invaders came and, with their superior technology, destroyedthe Indian world. Don Juan said that his benefactor was convinced that only ahandful of those warriors survived and were capable of reassembling theirknowledge and redirecting their path. Whatever don Juan and his benefactor knewabout the second attention was the restructured version; a new version which hadbuilt-in restraints because it had been forged under the harshest conditions ofsuppression. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"10. The Nagual's Party of Warriors When don Juan judged that the time was right for me to have my first encounterwith his fellow warriors, he made me shift levels of awareness.He then made it perfectly clear that he would have nothing to do with their wayof meeting me.Don Juan warned me that if they decided to beat me, he could not stop them: Theycould do anything they wanted, except kill me.Don Juan stressed over and over again that the warriors of his party were aperfect replica of his benefactor's party except that some of don Juan's womenwere more fierce; and all the men were utterly unique and powerful.Therefore, my first encounter with them might resemble a head-on collision.I was nervous and apprehensive on the one hand, but curious on the other.My mind was running wild with endless speculations, most of them about what thewarriors would look like.Don Juan said that he had the choice either of coaching me to memorize anelaborate ritual, as he had been made to do, or of making it the most casualencounter possible.He waited for an omen to point out which alternative to take.Don Juan told me that his benefactor had done something similar; only hisbenefactor had insisted don Juan learn the ritual before the omen presenteditself.When don Juan revealed his sexual daydreams of sleeping with four women, hisbenefactor interpreted it as the omen: Don Juan's benefactor chucked the ritual;and ended up pleading like a hog dealer for don Juan's life.In my case, don Juan wanted an omen before he taught me the ritual.That omen came when don Juan and I were driving through a border town in Arizonaand a policeman stopped me.The policeman thought I was an illegal alien.Only after I had shown him my passport- which he suspected of being a forgery-and other documents, did he let me go.Don Juan had been in the front seat next to me all the time, and the policemanhad not given him a second glance: The policeman had focused solely on me.Don Juan thought the incident was the omen he was waiting for: Hisinterpretation of it was that it would be very dangerous for me to callattention to myself; and he concluded that my world had to be one of uttersimplicity and candor: Elaborate ritual and pomp were out of character for me.Don Juan conceded, however, that a minimal observance of ritualistic patternswas in order when I made my acquaintance with his warriors.I had to begin by approaching them from the south, because that is the directionthat power follows in its ceaseless flux: Life force flows to us from the south,and leaves us flowing toward the north.Don Juan said that the only opening to a Nagual's world was through the south,and that the gate was made by two female warriors who would have to greet me,and who would let me go through if they so decided.He took me to a town in central Mexico to a house in the countryside.As we approached it on foot from a southerly direction, I saw two massive Indianwomen standing four feet apart, facing each other.They were about thirty or forty feet away from the main door of the house in anarea where the dirt was hard-packed.The two women were extraordinarily muscular and stern: Both had long, jet-blackhair held together in a single thick braid.The women looked like sisters. They were about the same height and weight.I figured that they must have been around five feet four, and weighed 150pounds.One of them was extremely dark, almost black, the other much lighter.They were dressed like typical Indian women from central Mexico with long, fulldresses and shawls, and homemade sandals.Don Juan made me stop three feet from them.He turned to the woman on our left and made me face her. He said that her namewas Cecilia and that she was a dreamer.He then turned abruptly without giving me time to say anything, and made me facethe darker woman to our right.He said that her name was Delia and that she was a stalker.The women nodded at me. They did not smile or move to shake hands with me, ormake any gesture of welcome.Don Juan walked between them as if they were two columns marking a gate.He took a couple of steps and turned as if waiting for the women to invite me togo through. The women stared at me calmly for a moment.Then Cecilia asked me to come in as if I were at the threshold of an actualdoor.Don Juan led the way to the house.At the front door we found a man.The man was very slender.At first sight he looked extremely young, but on closer examination he appearedto be in his late fifties.He gave me the impression of being an old child: small, wiry, with penetratingdark eyes.He was like an elfish apparition, a shadow.Don Juan introduced him to me as Emilito, and said that Emilito was his courierand all-around helper who would welcome me on his behalf.It seemed to me that Emilito was indeed the most appropriate being to welcomeanyone.His smile was radiant. His small teeth were perfectly even.He shook hands with me, or rather he crossed his forearms and clasped both myhands.He seemed to be exuding enjoyment.Anyone would have sworn that he was ecstatic in meeting me.His voice was very soft and his eyes sparkled.We walked into a large room.There was another woman there.Don Juan said that her name was Teresa and that she was Cecilia's and Delia'scourier.Teresa was perhaps in her early thirties, and she definitely looked likeCecilia's daughter.Teresa was very quiet but very friendly.We followed don Juan to the back of the house where there was a roofed porch.It was a warm day. We sat there around a table; and after a frugal dinner wetalked until after midnight.Emilito was the host. He charmed and delighted everyone with his exotic stories.The women opened up. They were a great audience for him.To hear the women's laughter was an exquisite pleasure.They were tremendously muscular, bold, and physical.At one point when Emilito said that Cecilia and Delia were like two mothers tohim, and Teresa like a daughter, they picked him up and tossed him in the airlike a child.Of the two women, Delia seemed the more rational, down-to-earth.Cecilia was perhaps more aloof, but appeared to have greater inner strength.Cecilia gave me the impression of being more intolerant, or more impatient: Sheseemed to get annoyed with some of Emilito's stories.Nonetheless, she was definitely on the edge of her chair when Emilito would tellwhat he called his 'tales of eternity'.Emilito would preface every story with the phrase, \"Do you, dear friends, knowthat...?\"The story that impressed me most was about some creatures that he said existedin the universe, who were the closest thing to human beings without being human;creatures who were obsessed against movement, and were capable of detecting theslightest fluctuation inside themselves or around them.These creatures were so sensitive to motion that it was a curse to them: It gavethem such pain that their ultimate ambition was to find quietude.Emilito would intersperse his tales of eternity with the most outrageous dirtyjokes.Because of his incredible gifts as a raconteur, I understood every one of hisstories as a metaphor, or a parable with which he was teaching us something.Don Juan said that Emilito was merely reporting about things he had witnessed inhis journeys through eternity: The role of a courier was to travel ahead of theNagual, like a scout in a military operation.Emilito went to the limits of the second attention, and whatever he witnessed hepassed on to the others. My second encounter with don Juan's warriors was just as contrived as the first.One day don Juan made me shift levels of awareness and told me that I had asecond appointment.He made me drive to Zacatecas in northern Mexico.We arrived there very early in the morning.Don Juan said that that was only a stopover, and that we had until the next dayto relax before we embarked on my second formal meeting to make the acquaintanceof the eastern women and the scholar warrior of his party.He explained then an intricate and delicate point of choice.He said that we had met the south and the courier in the midafternoon, becausehe had made an individual interpretation of the rule and had picked that hour torepresent the night: The south was really the night- a warm, friendly, cozynight- and properly we should have gone to meet the two southerly women aftermidnight.However, meeting them at night would have been inauspicious [* inauspicious-contrary to one's interests or welfare] for me because my general direction wastoward the light; toward optimism; an optimism that works itself harmoniouslyinto the mystery of darkness.He said that that was precisely what we had done that day: We had enjoyed eachother's company and talked until it was pitch-black.I had wondered why they did not light their lanterns.Don Juan said that the east, on the other hand, was the morning; the light; andthat we would meet the easterly women the next day at midmorning.Before breakfast we went to the plaza and sat down on a bench.Don Juan told me that he wanted me to remain there and wait for him while he ransome errands.He left and shortly after he had gone a woman came and sat down on the other endof the bench.I did not pay any attention to her and I started reading a newspaper.A moment later another woman joined her.I wanted to move to another bench, but I remembered that don Juan hadspecifically said that I should sit there.I had turned my back to the women and had even forgotten that they were theresince they were so quiet, when a man greeted them and stood facing me.I became aware from their conversation that the women had been waiting for him.The man apologized for being late.He obviously wanted to sit down, so I slid over to make room for him.He thanked me profusely and apologized for inconveniencing me.He said that they were absolutely lost in the city because they were ruralpeople, and that once they had been to Mexico City and had nearly died in thetraffic.He asked me if I lived in Zacatecas.I said no and I was going to end our conversation right there; but there wassomething very winning about his smile.He was an old man, but was remarkably fit for his age.He was not an Indian. He seemed to be a gentleman farmer from a small ruraltown.He was wearing a suit, and had a straw hat on. His features were very delicate.His skin was almost transparent. He had a high-bridged nose, a small mouth, anda perfectly groomed white beard.He looked extraordinarily healthy and yet he seemed frail. He was of mediumheight and well built, but at the same time gave the impression of beingslender, almost effete. [* effete- marked by excessive self-indulgence and moraldecay]He stood up and introduced himself to me.He told me that his name was Vicente Medrano, and that he had come to the cityon business only for the day.He then pointed to the two women, and said that they were his sisters.The women stood up and faced us.They were very slim and darker than their brother.They were also much younger: One of them could have been his daughter.I noticed that their skin was not like his: Theirs was dry.The two women were very good-looking.Like the man, they had fine features, and their eyes were clear and peaceful.They were about five feet four.They were wearing beautifully tailored dresses, but with their shawls, lowheeled shoes, and dark cotton stockings they looked like well-to-do farm women.The older one appeared to be in her fifties, the younger in her forties.The man introduced them to me.The older woman was named Carmela and the younger one Hermelinda.I stood up and briefly shook hands with them.I asked them if they had any children: That question was usually a sureconversation opener for me.The women laughed and in unison ran their hands down their stomachs to show mehow lean they were.The man calmly explained that his sisters were spinsters, and that he himselfwas an old bachelor.He confided to me, in a half-joking tone, that unfortunately his sisters weretoo mannish: They lacked the femininity that makes a woman desirable, and sothey had been unable to find husbands.I said that they were better off, considering the subservient role of women inour society.The women disagreed with me. They said that they would not have minded at allbeing servants if they had only found men who wanted to be their masters.The younger one said that the real problem was that their father had failed toteach them to behave like women.The man commented with a sigh that their father was so domineering that he hadalso prevented him from marrying by deliberately neglecting to teach him how tobe a macho.All three of them sighed and looked gloomy.I wanted to laugh.After a long silence we sat down again and the man said that if I stayed a whilelonger on that bench I would have a chance to meet their father, who was stillvery spirited for his advanced age.The man added in a shy tone that their father was going to take them to eatbreakfast because they themselves never carried any money: Their father handledthe purse strings.I was aghast. Those old people who looked so strong were in reality like weak,dependent children.I said goodbye to them and got up to leave.The man and his sisters insisted that I stay. They assured me that their fatherwould love it if I would join them for breakfast.I did not want to meet their father and yet I was curious.I told them that I myself was waiting for someone.At that, the women began to chuckle and then broke into a roaring laughter.The man also abandoned himself to uncontained laughter.I felt stupid and I wanted to get out of there.At that moment don Juan showed up and I became aware of their maneuver. I didnot think it was amusing.All of us stood up.They were still laughing as don Juan told me that those women were the east-that Carmela was the stalker and Hermelinda the dreamer- and that Vicente wasthe warrior scholar and his oldest companion.As we were leaving the plaza, another man joined us; a tall, dark Indian,perhaps in his forties.He was wearing Levi's and a cowboy hat. He seemed terribly strong and sullen.Don Juan introduced him to me as Juan Tuma, Vicente's courier and researchassistant.We walked to a restaurant a few blocks away: The women held me between them.Carmela said that she hoped I was not offended by their joke; that they had hadthe choice of just introducing themselves to me or kidding me.What made them decide to kid me was my thoroughly snobbish attitude in turningmy back to them, and my wanting to move to another bench.Hermelinda added that one has to be utterly humble and carry nothing to defend,not even one's person; that one's person should be protected, but not defended.In snubbing them, I was not protecting but merely defending myself.I felt quarrelsome. I was frankly put out by their masquerade.I began to argue, but before I had made my point don Juan came to my side.He told the two women that they should overlook my belligerence, that it takes avery long time to clean out the garbage that a luminous being picks up in theworld.The owner of the restaurant knew Vicente, and had prepared a sumptuous breakfastfor us.All of them were in great spirits, but I was unable to let go of my brooding.Then, at don Juan's request, Juan Tuma began to talk about his journeys.Juan Tuma was a factual man, and I became mesmerized by his dry accounts ofthings beyond my comprehension.To me, the most fascinating was his description of some beams of light or energythat allegedly crisscross the earth.He said that these beams do not fluctuate as everything else in the universedoes, but are fixed into a pattern. This pattern coincides with hundreds ofpoints in the luminous body.Hermelinda had understood that all the points were in our physical body, butJuan Tuma explained that since the luminous body is quite big, some of thepoints are as much as three feet away from the physical body.In a sense they are outside of us, and yet they are not. They are on theperiphery of our luminosity and thus still belong to the total body.The most important of those points is located a foot away from the stomach, 40degrees to the right of an imaginary line shooting straight forward.Juan Tuma told us that point was a center of assembling for the secondattention; and that it is possible to manipulate it by gently stroking the airwith the palms of the hands.Listening to Juan Tuma, I forgot my anger. My next encounter with don Juan's world was with the west.He gave me ample warning that the first contact with the west was a mostimportant event because it would decide, in one way or another, what I shouldsubsequently do.He also alerted me to the fact that it was going to be a trying event,especially for me, as I was so stiff and felt so self-important.He said that the west is naturally approached at dusk; a time of day which isdifficult just in itself, and that his warriors of the west were very powerful,bold, and downright maddening.At the same time, I was also going to meet the male warrior who was the manbehind the scenes.Don Juan admonished me to exercise the utmost caution and patience: Not onlywere the women raving mad, but they and the man were the most powerful warriorshe had ever known.They were, in his opinion, the ultimate authorities of the second attention.Don Juan did not elaborate any further.One day, as though on the spur of the moment, he suddenly decided that it wastime to start on our trip to meet the westerly women.We drove to a city in northern Mexico.Just at dusk, don Juan directed me to stop in front of a big unlit house on theoutskirts of town.We got out of the car and walked to the main door.Don Juan knocked several times.No one answered, and I had the feeling that we had come at the wrong time. Thehouse seemed empty.Don Juan kept on knocking until he apparently got tired.He signaled me to knock.He told me to keep on doing it without stopping because the people who lived inthere were hard of hearing.I asked him if it would be better to return later or the next day.He told me to keep on banging on the door.After a seemingly endless wait, the door began to open slowly.A weird looking woman stuck her head out, and asked me if my intention was tobreak down the door, or to anger the neighbors and their dogs.Don Juan stepped forward to say something.The woman stepped out and forcefully brushed him aside.She began to shake her finger at me, yelling that I was behaving as if I ownedthe world; as if there were no one else besides myself.I protested that I was merely doing what don Juan had told me to do.The woman asked if I had been told to break the door down.Don Juan tried to intervene but was again brushed away.The woman looked as if she had just gotten out of bed. She was a mess.Our knocking had probably awakened her and she must have put on a dress from herbasket of dirty clothes.She was barefoot. Her hair was graying and terribly unkempt. She had red, beadyeyes.She was a homely woman, but somehow very impressive; rather tall- about fivefeet eight- dark and enormously muscular.Her bare arms were knotted with hard muscles, and I noticed that she hadbeautifully shaped calves.She looked me up and down, towering over me, and shouted that she had not heardmy apologies.Don Juan whispered to me that I should apologize loud and clear.Once I had done that, the woman smiled and turned to don Juan and hugged him asif he were a child.She grumbled that he should not have made me knock because my touch on the doorwas too shifty and disturbing.She held don Juan's arm and led him inside, helping him over the high threshold.She called him 'dearest little old man'.Don Juan laughed.I was appalled to see him acting as if he were delighted at the absurdities ofthat scary woman.Once she had helped the dearest little old man into the house, she turned to me,and made a gesture with her hand to shoo me away as if I were a dog.She laughed at my surprise.Her teeth were big, uneven, and filthy.Then she seemed to change her mind and told me to come in.Don Juan was heading to a door that I could barely see at the end of a darkhall.The woman scolded him for not knowing where he was going.She took us through another dark hall.The house seemed to be enormous and there was not a single light in it.The woman opened a door to a very large room; almost empty except for two oldarmchairs in the center under the weakest light bulb I had ever seen: It was anold fashioned long bulb.Another woman was sitting in one of the armchairs.The first woman sat down on a small straw mat on the floor, and rested her backagainst the other chair.Then she put her thighs against her breasts; exposing herself completely. Shewas not wearing underpants.I stared at her dumbfounded.In an ugly gruff tone, the woman asked me why I was staring at her vagina.I did not know what to say except to deny it.She stood up and seemed about to hit me. She demanded that I tell her that I hadgaped at her because I had never seen a vagina in my life.I felt guilty. I was thoroughly embarrassed and also annoyed at having beencaught in such a situation.The woman asked don Juan what kind of Nagual I was if I had never seen a vagina.She began repeating this over and over, yelling it at the top of her voice.She ran around the room and stopped by the chair where the other woman wassitting. She shook her by the shoulders, and, pointing at me, said that I was aman who had never seen a vagina in his whole life.She laughed and taunted me.I was mortified. I felt that don Juan should have done something to save me fromthat humiliation.I remembered that he had told me these women were quite mad.He had understated it: This woman was ready for an institution.I looked at don Juan for support and advice.He looked away. He seemed to be equally at a loss; although I thought I caught amalicious smile which he quickly hid by turning his head.The woman lay down on her back, and pulled up her skirt, and commanded me tolook to my heart's content instead of sneaking glances.My face must have been red, judging by the heat in my head and neck. I was soannoyed that I almost lost control. I felt like bashing her head in.The woman who was sitting in the chair suddenly stood up and grabbed the otherone by the hair and made her stand up in one single motion, seemingly with noeffort at all.The second woman stared at me through half closed eyes, bringing her face nomore than two or three inches from mine. She smelled surprisingly fresh.In a high pitched voice, she said that we should get down to business.Both of the women stood close to me under the light bulb. They did not lookalike.The second woman was older, or looked older and her face was covered by a thickcoat of cosmetic powder that gave her a clownish appearance. Her hair was neatlyarranged in a chignon.She seemed calm except for a continuous tremor in her lower lip and chin.Both women were equally tall and strong looking; they towered menacingly over meand stared at me for a long time.Don Juan did not do anything to break their fixation.The older woman nodded her head, and don Juan told me that her name was Zuleicaand that she was a dreamer.The woman who had opened the door was named Zoila, and she was a stalker.Zuleica turned to me, and in a parrotlike voice asked me if it was true that Ihad never seen a vagina.Don Juan could not hold his composure any longer and began to laugh.With a gesture, I signaled him that I did not know what to say.He whispered in my ear that it would be better for me to say that I had not;otherwise I should be prepared to describe a vagina, because that was whatZuleica would demand that I do next.I answered accordingly, and Zuleica said that she felt sorry for me.Then she ordered Zoila to show me her vagina.Zoila lay down on her back under the light bulb and opened her legs.Don Juan was laughing and coughing.I begged him to get me out of that madhouse.He whispered in my ear again that I had better take a good look and appearattentive and interested, because if I did not we would have to stay there untilkingdom come.After my careful and attentive examination, Zuleica said that from then on Icould brag that I was a connoisseur, and that if I ever stumbled upon a womanwithout pants, I would not be so coarse and obscene as to let my eyes pop out oftheir sockets because now I had seen a vagina.Zuleica very quietly led us to the patio.She whispered that there was someone out there waiting to meet me.The patio was pitch black. I could hardly make out the silhouettes of theothers.Then I saw the dark outline of a man standing a few-feet away from me.My body experienced an involuntary jolt.Don Juan spoke to the man in a very low voice; saying that he had brought me tomeet him. Don Juan told the man my name.After a moment's silence, don Juan said to me that the man's name was SilvioManuel, and that he was the warrior of darkness and the actual leader of thewhole warrior's party.Then Silvio Manuel spoke to me. I thought that he must have had a speechdisorder: His voice was muffled and the words came out of him like spurts ofsoft coughing.He ordered me to come closer.As I tried to approach him, he receded, just as if he were floating.He led me into an even darker recess of a hall, walking, it seemed, noiselesslybackwards.He muttered something I could not understand. I wanted to speak: My throatitched and was parched.He repeated something two or three times until it dawned on me that he wasordering me to undress.There was something overpowering about his voice and the darkness around him: Iwas incapable of disobeying.I took off my clothes and stood stark naked, shivering with fear and cold.It was so dark that I could not see if don Juan and the two women were around.I heard a soft prolonged hissing from a source a few feet away from me. Then Ifelt a cool breeze.I realized that Silvio Manuel was exhaling his breath all over my body.He then asked me to sit on my clothes and look at a bright point which I couldeasily distinguish in the darkness; a point that seemed to give out a faintamber light.I stared at it for what seemed hours, until I suddenly realized that the pointof brightness was Silvio Manuel's left eye.I could then make out the contour of his whole face and his body: The hall wasnot as dark as it had seemed.Silvio Manuel advanced to me and helped me up.To see in the dark with such clarity enthralled me. I did not even mind that Iwas naked or that, as I then saw, the two women were watching me.Apparently they could also see in the dark: They were staring at me.I wanted to put on my pants, but Zoila snatched them out of my hands.The two women and Silvio Manuel stared at me for a long time.Then don Juan came out of nowhere, and handed me my shoes.Zoila led us through a corridor to an open patio with trees.I made out the dark silhouette of a woman standing in the middle of the patio.Don Juan spoke to her and she mumbled something in reply.He told me that she was a southerly woman, that her name was Marta, and that shewas a courier to the two westerly women.Marta said that she could bet I had never been introduced to a woman while I wasnaked; that the normal procedure is to get acquainted and then undress.She laughed out loud. Her laughter was so pleasing, so clear and youthful, thatit sent chills through me. It reverberated through the whole house, enhanced bythe darkness and the silence there.I looked to don Juan for support.He was gone and so was Silvio Manuel. I was alone with the three women.I became very nervous and asked Marta if she knew where don Juan had gone.At that precise moment, someone grabbed the skin of my armpits. I yelled withpain.I knew that it was Silvio Manuel. He lifted me up as if I weighed nothing andshook my shoes off me.Then he stood me in a shallow tub of ice-cold water that came up to my knees.I remained in the tub for a long time while all of them scrutinized me.Then Silvio Manuel lifted me up again and set me down next to my shoes whichsomeone had neatly placed next to the tub.Don Juan again came out of nowhere and handed me my clothes.He whispered that I should put them on, and stay only long enough to be polite.Marta gave me a towel to dry myself.I looked around for the other two women and Silvio Manuel, but they were nowherein sight.Marta, don Juan, and I stood in the darkness talking for a long time. She seemedto be speaking mainly to don Juan, but I believed that I was her real audience.I waited for a clue from don Juan to leave, but he appeared to be enjoyingMarta's agile conversation.She told him that Zoila and Zuleica had been at the peak of their madness thatday. Then she added for my benefit that they were extremely rational most of thetime.As if she were revealing a secret, Marta told us that the reason Zoila's hairlooked so unkempt was because at least one third of it was Zuleica's hair.What had happened was that the two of them had had a moment of intensecamaraderie and were helping one another to groom their hair.Zuleica braided Zoila's hair as she had done hundreds of times, except that,being out of control, she had braided portions of her own hair in with Zoila's.Marta said that when they got up from their chairs they went into a commotion.She ran to their rescue, but by the time she entered the room, Zuleica had takenover.And since Zuleica was more lucid than Zoila that day, Zuleica had decided to cutthe portion of Zoila's hair that was braided to hers.Zuleica got confused in the melee that ensued, and she cut her own hair instead.Don Juan was laughing as if it were the funniest thing ever.I heard soft coughlike bursts of laughter coming from the darkness on the farside of the patio.Marta added that she had to improvise a chignon until Zuleica's hair grew out.I laughed along with don Juan.I liked Marta. The two other women were abhorrent to me: They gave me asensation of nausea.Marta, on the other hand, seemed a paragon of calm and silent purpose. I couldnot see her features, but I imagined her to be very beautiful. The sound of hervoice was haunting.She very politely asked don Juan if I would accept something to eat.He replied that I did not feel comfortable with Zuleica and Zoila, and that Iwould probably get sick to my stomach.Marta assured me that the two women were gone, and took my arm and led usthrough the darkest hall yet into a well-lit kitchen.The contrast was too great for my eyes. I stood in the doorway trying to getused to the light.The kitchen had a very high ceiling and was fairly modern and adequate. We satin a sort of dinette area.Marta was young and very strong. She had a plump, voluptuous figure, a roundface, and a small nose and mouth. Her jet-black hair was braided and coiledaround her head.I thought that she must have been as curious to examine me as I had been to seeher.We sat and ate and talked for hours.I was fascinated by her. She was an uneducated woman but she held me spellboundwith her talk.She gave us detailed accounts of the preposterous things that Zoila and Zuleicadid when they were mad.As we drove away, don Juan expressed his admiration for Marta.He said that she was perhaps the finest example he knew of how determination canaffect a human being. With no background or preparation at all except for herunbending intent, Marta had successfully tackled the most arduous taskimaginable; that of taking care of Zoila, Zuleica, and Silvio Manuel.I asked don Juan why Silvio Manuel had refused to let me look at him in thelight.He replied that Silvio Manuel was in his element in darkness, and that I wasgoing to have countless opportunities to see him.For our first meeting, nonetheless, it was mandatory that he maintain himselfwithin the boundaries of his power; the darkness of the night.Silvio Manuel and the two women lived together because they were a team offormidable sorcerers.Don Juan advised me that I should not make hasty judgments about the westerlywomen.He said I had met them at a moment when they were out of control, but their lackof control pertained only to surface behavior.They had an inner core which was unalterable.Thus, even at the time of their worst madness, they were capable of laughing attheir own aberration, [* aberration- a state or condition markedly differentfrom the norm] as if it were a performance staged by someone else.Silvio Manuel's case was different.He was in no way deranged: In fact, it was his profound sobriety that enabledhim to deal so effectively with those two women because he and they wereopposite extremes.Don Juan said that Silvio Manuel had been born that way and everyone around himacknowledged his difference.Even their benefactor, who was stern and unsparing with everybody, lavished agreat deal of attention on Silvio Manuel.It took don Juan years to understand the reason for this preference.Due to something inexplicable in his nature, once Silvio Manuel had entered intothe left-side awareness, he never came out of it.His proclivity to remain in a state of heightened awareness, coupled with thesuperb leadership of their benefactor, allowed Silvio Manuel to arrive beforeanyone else, not only at the conclusion that the rule is a map and there is infact another kind of awareness, but also to the actual passageway into thatother world of awareness.Don Juan said that Silvio Manuel, in a most impeccable manner, balanced hisexcessive gains by putting them at the service of their common purpose: SilvioManuel became the silent force behind don Juan. My last introductory encounter with don Juan's warriors was with the north.Don Juan took me to the city of Guadalajara to fulfill that meeting.He said that our appointment was only a short distance from the center of townand had to be at noon because the north was the midday.We left the hotel around 11 a.m., and took an easy stroll through the downtownarea.I was walking along without watching where I was going; worried about themeeting, and I collided head-on with a lady who was rushing out of a store.She was carrying packages, which scattered all over the ground.I apologized, and began to help her pick them up.Don Juan urged me to hurry because we were going to be late.The lady seemed to be stunned: I held her arm.She was a very slender, tall woman perhaps in her sixties; very elegantlydressed. She seemed to be a lady of social standing.She was exquisitely polite, and assumed the blame saying that she had beendistracted looking for her manservant.She asked me if I would help her locate him in the crowd.I turned to don Juan.He said that the least I could do after nearly killing her was to help her.I took her packages and we walked back into the store.A short distance away I spotted a forlorn looking Indian who seemed thoroughlyout of place there.The lady called him and he came to her side like a lost puppy. He looked as ifhe was about to lick her hand.Don Juan was waiting for us outside the store.He explained to the lady that we were in a hurry and then told her my name.The lady smiled graciously and initiated a handshake.I thought that in her youth she must have been ravishing, because she was stillbeautiful and alluring.Don Juan turned to me and abruptly said that her name was Nelida, that she wasof the north, and that she was a dreamer.Then he made me face the manservant and said that his name was Genaro Flores,and that he was the man of action; the warrior of deeds in the party.My surprise was total. All three of them had a belly laugh: The greater mydismay, the more they seemed to enjoy it.Don Genaro gave the packages away to a group of children, telling them that hisemployer, the kind lady who was talking, had bought those things as a presentfor them: It was her good deed for the day.Then we strolled in silence for half a block. I was tongue-tied.Suddenly Nelida pointed to a store and asked us to wait just an instant becauseshe had to pick up a box of nylons that they were holding for her there.She peered at me smiling, her eyes shining, and told me that, all kidding aside,sorcery or no sorcery, she had to wear nylons and lace panties.Don Juan and don Genaro laughed like two idiots.I stared at Nelida because I could not do anything else.There was something about her that was utterly earthly and yet she was almostethereal. [* ethereal- characterized by lightness and insubstantiality; asimpalpable or intangible as air]She kiddingly told don Juan to hold on to me because I was about to pass out.Then she politely asked don Genaro to run in and get her order from a specificclerk.As he started in, Nelida seemed to change her mind and called him back, but heapparently did not hear her and he disappeared inside the store.She excused herself and ran after him.Don Juan pressed my back to get me out of my turmoil.He said that I would meet the other northerly woman whose name was Florinda byherself at another time, because she was to be my link into another cycle;another mood.He described Florinda as a carbon copy of Nelida, or vice versa.I remarked that Nelida was so sophisticated and stylish that I could imagineseeing her in a fashion magazine.The fact that she was beautiful and so fair- perhaps of French or northernItalian extraction- had surprised me. Although Vicente was not an Indian either,his rural appearance made him less of an anomaly. [* anomaly- deviation from thenormal; or common order, form, or rule]I asked don Juan why there were non-Indians in his world.He said that power is what selects the warriors of a Nagual's party, and that itis impossible to know its designs.We waited in front of the store for perhaps half an hour.Don Juan seemed to get impatient and asked me to go inside and tell them tohurry.I walked into the store. It was not a big place, there was no back door, and yetthey were nowhere in sight.I asked the clerks, but they could not help me.I confronted don Juan and demanded to know what had happened.He said that they had either disappeared into thin air, or had sneaked out whilehe was cracking my back.I raged at him that most of his people were tricksters.He laughed until tears were rolling down his cheeks.He said that I was the ideal dupe: My self-importance made me a most enjoyablesubject.He was laughing so hard at my annoyance that he had to lean against a wall. La Gorda gave me an account of her first meeting with the members of don Juan'sparty.Her version differed only in content. The form was the same.The warriors were perhaps a bit more violent with her, but she had understoodthis as their attempt to shake her out of her slumber; and also as a naturalreaction to what she considered her ugly personality.As we reviewed don Juan's world, we realized that it was a replica of hisbenefactor's world.It could be seen as consisting either of groups or households. There was a groupof four independent pairs of apparent sisters who worked and lived together;another group of three men who were don Juan's age and were very close to him; ateam of two somewhat younger men, the couriers Emilito and Juan Tuma; andfinally a team of two younger, southerly women who seemed to be related to eachother, Marta and Teresa.At other times it could be seen as consisting of four separate households,located quite far from one another in different areas of Mexico. One was made upof the two westerly women, Zuleica and Zoila, Silvio Manuel, and the courierMarta. The next was composed of the southerly women, Cecilia and Delia, donJuan's courier, Emilito, and the courier Teresa. Another household was formed bythe easterly women, Carmela and Hermelinda, Vicente, and the courier Juan Tuma;and the last, of the northerly women, Nelida and Florinda, and don Genaro.According to don Juan, his world did not have the harmony and balance of hisbenefactor's.The only two women who thoroughly balanced one another, and who looked likeidentical twins were the northerly warriors, Nelida and Florinda.Nelida once told me in casual conversation that she and Florinda were so alikethat they even had the same blood type.For me one of the most pleasant surprises of our interaction was thetransformation of Zuleica and Zoila; who had been so abhorrent.They turned out to be, as don Juan had said, the most sober and dutiful warriorsimaginable.I could not believe my eyes when I saw them again. Their mad spell had passedand they now looked like two well-dressed Mexican ladies, tall, dark, andmuscular, with brilliant dark eyes like pieces of shiny black obsidian.They laughed and joked with me about what had happened the night of our firstmeeting, as if someone else and not they had been involved in it.I could easily understand don Juan's turmoil with the westerly warriors of hisbenefactor's party.It was impossible for me to accept that Zuleica and Zoila could ever turn intosuch obnoxious, nauseating creatures as I had first encountered.I was to witness their metamorphoses many times, yet I was never again able tojudge them as harshly as I had on our first encounter.More than anything else, their outrages made me feel sad.But the biggest surprise to me was Silvio Manuel.In the darkness of our first meeting I had imagined him to be an imposing man,an overpowering giant.In fact, he was tiny, but not small-boned tiny. His body was like the body of ajockey; small, yet perfectly proportioned. He looked to me as if he might be agymnast.His physical control was so remarkable that he could puff himself up like atoad, to nearly twice his size, by contracting all the muscles of his body.He used to give astounding demonstrations of how he could dislodge his jointsand put them back together again without any overt signs of pain.Looking at Silvio Manuel, I always experienced a deep unfamiliar feeling offright.To me he seemed like a visitor from another time. He was pale-dark, like abronze statue. His features were sharp; his aquiline nose, full lips, and widelyseparated, slanted eyes made him look like a stylized figure on a Mayan fresco.He was friendly and warm during the daytime, but as soon as the twilight set in,he would become unfathomable.His voice would change. He would sit in a dark corner and let the darknessswallow him. All that was visible of him was his left eye, which remained openand acquired a strange shine, reminiscent of the eyes of a feline. A secondary issue that came up in the course of our interaction with don Juan'swarriors was the subject of controlled folly.Don Juan gave me a succinct explanation once when he was discussing the twocategories into which all the women warriors are mandatorily divided, thedreamers and the stalkers.He said that all the members of his party did dreaming and stalking as part oftheir daily lives, but that the women who made up the planet of the dreamers andthe planet of the stalkers were the foremost authorities on their respectiveactivities.The stalkers are the ones who take the brunt of the daily world.They are the business managers, the ones who deal with people. Everything thathas to do with the world of ordinary affairs goes through them.The stalkers are the practitioners of controlled folly, just as the dreamers arethe practitioners of dreaming.In other words, controlled folly is the basis for stalking; as dreams are thebasis for dreaming.Don Juan said that, generally speaking, a warrior's greatest accomplishment inthe second attention is dreaming, and in the first attention his greatestaccomplishment is stalking.I had misunderstood what don Juan's warriors were doing to me in our firstmeetings.I took their actions as instances of trickery- and that would still be myimpression today had it not been for the idea of controlled folly.Don Juan said that their actions with me had been masterful lessons in stalking.He told me that the art of stalking was what his benefactor had taught himbefore anything else. In order to survive among his benefactor's warriors he hadhad to learn that art quickly.In my case, he said, since I did not have to contend by myself with hiswarriors, I had to learn dreaming first.When the time was right, Florinda would step out to guide me into thecomplexities of stalking.No one else could deliberately talk to me about it. They could only give medirect demonstrations, as they had already done in our first meetings.Don Juan explained to me at great length that Florinda was one of the foremostpractitioners of stalking because she had been trained in every intricacy of itby his benefactor and four or his female warriors who were stalkers.Florinda was the first female warrior to come into don Juan's world; and becauseof that, she was to be my personal guide not only in the art of stalking, butalso in the mystery of the third attention if I ever got there.Don Juan did not elaborate on this. He said it would have to wait until I wasready to learn stalking, and then to enter into the third attention.Don Juan said that his benefactor had taken extra time and care with him and hiswarriors in everything that pertained to their mastering the art of stalking.His benefactor used complex ploys to create an appropriate context for acounterpoint between the dictums of the rule and the behavior of the warriors inthe daily world as they interacted with people.He believed that that was the way to convince them that, in the absence ofself-importance, a warrior's only way of dealing with the social milieu is interms of controlled folly.In the course of working out his ploys, don Juan's benefactor would pit theactions of people and the actions of the warriors against the commands of therule, and would then sit back and let the natural drama unfold itself.The folly of the people would take the lead for a while and drag the warriorsinto it, as seems to be the natural course; only to be vanquished in the end bythe more encompassing designs of the rule. Don Juan told us that at first he resented his benefactor's control over theplayers.Don Juan even told his benefactor that to his face.His benefactor was not fazed: He argued that his control was merely an illusioncreated by the Eagle: He was only an impeccable warrior, and his actions were ahumble attempt to mirror the Eagle.Don Juan said that the force with which his benefactor carried out his designsoriginated from his knowledge that the Eagle is real and final, and that whatpeople do is utter folly.The two together gave rise to controlled folly, which don Juan's benefactordescribed as the only bridge between the folly of people and the finality of theEagle's dictums.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"11. The Nagual Woman Don Juan said that when he was put in the care of the westerly women to becleansed, he was also put under the guidance of the northerly woman who wascomparable to Florinda, the number-one stalker, who taught him the principles ofthat art. She and his benefactor gave him the actual means to secure the threemale warriors, the one courier, and the four female stalkers who were to make uphis party.The eight female seers of his benefactor's group had searched for thedistinctive configurations of luminosity and had had no difficulty whatever infinding the appropriate types of male and female warriors for don Juan's party.His benefactor, however, did not permit those seers to do anything to gather thewarriors they had found. It was left to don Juan to apply the principles ofstalking and secure them.The first warrior to appear was Vicente. Don Juan did not have enough of acommand of stalking to be able to draft him. His benefactor and the northerlystalker had to do most of the work. Then came Silvio Manuel, later don Genaro,and finally Emilito, the courier.Florinda was the first female warrior. She was followed by Zoila, then Delia,and then Carmela. Don Juan said that his benefactor had insisted relentlesslythat they deal with the world exclusively in terms of controlled folly. The endresult was a stupendous team of practitioners, who thought up and executed themost intricate schemes.When they had all acquired a degree of proficiency in the art of stalking, theirbenefactor thought it was time for him to find the Nagual woman for them- whichhe did.But before he brought her into their world, and true to his policy of helpingeveryone to help themselves; he waited not only until all of them were expertstalkers, but until don Juan had learned to see. Although don Juan regrettedimmensely the time wasted in waiting, he conceded that their joint effort insecuring her created a stronger tie among all of them. It revitalized theircommitment to seek their freedom.His benefactor began to unfold his strategy for drawing in the Nagual woman byall of a sudden becoming a devout Catholic. He demanded that don Juan, being theheir to his knowledge, behave like a son and go to church with him. He draggedhim to mass nearly every day. Don Juan said that his benefactor, who was verycharming and glib, would introduce him to everyone in church as his son, abone-setter.Don Juan, by his own account an uncivilized pagan at that time, was mortified tofind himself in social situations where he had to talk and give an account ofhimself. He put his mind at ease with the idea that his benefactor had anulterior motive for everything he was doing. He attempted to deduce fromobserving him what his reasons might be.His benefactor's actions were consistent and seemed aboveboard. As an exemplaryCatholic, he gained the trust of scores of people, especially the parish priest,who held him in high esteem, considering him a friend and confidant. Don Juancould not figure out what he was up to. The thought crossed his mind that hisbenefactor might have sincerely taken up Catholicism, or gone mad. He had notyet understood that a warrior never loses his mind under any circumstances.Don Juan's qualms about going to church vanished when his benefactor beganintroducing him to the daughters of people he was acquainted with. He enjoyedthat, although he felt ill at ease. Don Juan thought that his benefactor washelping him to exercise his tongue. He was neither glib nor charming, and hisbenefactor had said that a Nagual, perforce, has to be both.One Sunday during mass, after nearly a year of almost daily attendance, don Juanfound out the real reason for their going to church. He was kneeling next to agirl named Olinda, the daughter of one of his benefactor's acquaintances. Heturned to exchange a glance with her, as had become their custom after months ofdaily contact.Their eyes met, and suddenly don Juan saw her as a luminous being- and then hesaw her doubleness. Olinda was a double woman. His benefactor had known it allalong, and had taken the most difficult path in order to put don Juan in touchwith her. Don Juan confessed to us that the moment was overwhelming to him.His benefactor knew that don Juan had seen. His mission to put the double beingstogether had been completed successfully and impeccably. He stood up and hiseyes swept every corner of that church, then he walked out without a backwardglance. There was nothing more for him to do there.Don Juan said that when his benefactor walked out in the middle of mass, allheads turned. Don Juan wanted to follow him, but Olinda boldly clasped his handand held him back. He knew then that the power of seeing had not been his alone.Something had gone through both of them and they were transfixed.Don Juan realized all of a sudden that not only had the mass ended, but thatthey were already outside the church. His benefactor was trying to calm Olinda'smother, who was incensed and shamed by their unexpected and inadmissible displayof affection.Don Juan was at a loss as to what to do next. He knew that it was up to him tofigure out a plan. He had the resources, but the importance of the event madehim lose confidence in his ability. He forsook his training as a stalker andbecame lost in the intellectual dilemma of whether or not to treat Olinda ascontrolled folly.His benefactor told him that he could not help him. His duty had been only toput them together, and that was where his responsibility ended. It was up to donJuan to take the necessary steps to secure her. He suggested that don Juan evenconsider marrying her, if that was what was needed. Only after she came to himof her own accord could he help don Juan by directly intervening with her as aNagual.Don Juan tried a formal courtship. He was not well received by her parents, whocould not conceive of someone from a different social class as a suitor fortheir daughter. Olinda was not an Indian: Her family were middle-class urbandwellers; owners of a small business. The father had other plans for hisdaughter. He threatened to send her away if don Juan persisted in his intentionto marry her.Don Juan said that double beings, especially women, are extraordinarilyconservative, even timid. Olinda was no exception. After their initialexhilaration in church, she was overtaken by caution, and then by fear. Her ownreactions scared her.As a strategic maneuver, his benefactor made don Juan retreat, to make it appearas if he were acquiescing to his father, who had not approved of the girl- whichwas the assumption of everyone who had witnessed the incident in church. Peoplegossiped that their display had displeased his father so intensely that hisfather, who was such a devout Catholic, had never returned to church.His benefactor told don Juan that a warrior is never under siege. To be undersiege implies that one has personal possessions that could be blockaded. Awarrior has nothing in the world except his impeccability, and impeccabilitycannot be threatened. Nonetheless, in a battle for one's life, such as the onedon Juan was waging to secure the Nagual woman, a warrior should strategicallyuse every means available.Accordingly, don Juan resolved to use any portion of his stalker's knowledgethat he had to- to get the girl. To that end, he engaged Silvio Manuel to usehis sorcerer's arts, which even at that early stage were formidable, to abductthe girl. Silvio Manuel and Genaro, who was a true daredevil, stole into thegirl's house disguised as old washerwomen. It was midday and everyone in thehouse was busy preparing food for a large group of relatives and friends whowere coming to dinner.They were having an informal going-away party for Olinda. Silvio Manuel wascounting on the likelihood that people who saw two strange washerwomen coming inwith bundles of clothes would assume that it had to do with Olinda's party andwould not get suspicious. Don Juan had supplied Silvio Manuel and Genarobeforehand with all the information they needed concerning the routines of themembers of the household. He told them that the washerwomen usually carriedtheir bundles of washed clothes into the house and left them in a storage roomto be ironed. Carrying a large bundle of clothes, Silvio Manuel and Genaro wentdirectly into that room, knowing that Olinda would be there.Don Juan said that Silvio Manuel went up to Olinda and used his mesmeric powersto make her faint. They put her inside a sack, wrapped the sack with her bedsheets, and walked out, leaving behind the bundle they had carried in. Theybumped into her father at the door. He did not even glance at them.Don Juan's benefactor was utterly put out with their maneuver. He ordered donJuan to take the girl back immediately to her house. It was imperative, he said,that the double woman come to the benefactor's house of her own free will,perhaps not with the idea of joining them but at least because they interestedher.Don Juan felt that everything was lost- the odds against getting her back intoher house unnoticed were too great- but Silvio Manuel figured out a solution. Heproposed that they should let the four women of don Juan's party take the girlto a deserted road, where don Juan would rescue her.Silvio Manuel wanted the women to pretend that they were kidnapping her. At somepoint along the road someone would see them and come in pursuit. Their pursuerwould overtake them and they would drop the sack, with a degree of force so asto be convincing. The pursuer would be, of course, don Juan, who would happenmiraculously to be at just the right place at the right time.Silvio Manuel demanded true-to-life action. He ordered the women to gag thegirl, who by then would surely be awake and screaming inside the sack, and thento run for miles carrying the sack. He told them to hide from their pursuer.Finally, after a truly exhausting ordeal, they were to drop the sack in such away that the girl could witness a most vicious fight between don Juan and thefour women. Silvio Manuel told the women that this had to be utterly realistic.He armed them with sticks and instructed them to hit don Juan convincinglybefore they were driven away.Of the women, Zoila was the one most easily carried away by hysteria. As soon asthey began whacking don Juan she became possessed by her role and gave achilling performance, striking don Juan so hard that flesh was torn from hisback and shoulders. For a moment it seemed that the kidnappers were going towin. Silvio Manuel had to come out of his hiding place and, pretending to be apasserby, remind them that it was only a ploy and that it was time to run away.Don Juan thus became Olinda's savior and protector. He told her that he couldnot take her back to her house himself because he had been injured, but he wouldsend her back instead with his pious father.She helped him walk to his benefactor's house. Don Juan said that he did nothave to pretend injury. He was bleeding profusely and barely made it to thedoor. When Olinda told his benefactor what had happened, his benefactor's desireto laugh was so excruciating he had to disguise it as weeping.Don Juan had his wounds bandaged and then went to bed. Olinda began to explainto don Juan why her father was opposed to him, but she did not finish. DonJuan's benefactor came into the room and told her that it was evident to him,from observing her walk, that the kidnappers had injured her back. He offered toalign it for her before it became critical.Olinda hesitated. Don Juan's benefactor reminded her that the kidnappers had notbeen playing- they had nearly killed his son, after all. That comment sufficed.She came to the benefactor's side and let him give her a sound blow on hershoulder blade. It made a cracking sound and Olinda entered into a state ofheightened awareness. He disclosed the rule to her, and just like don Juan, sheaccepted it in full. There was no doubt, no hesitation.The Nagual woman and don Juan found completeness and silence in each other'scompany. Don Juan said that the feeling they had for each other had nothing todo with affection or need. It was rather a shared physical sense that an ominousbarrier had been broken within them, and they were one and the same being.Don Juan and his Nagual woman, as the rule prescribed, worked together for yearsto find the set of four female dreamers, who turned out to be Nelida, Zuleica,Cecilia, and Hermelinda and the three couriers, Juan Tuma, Teresa, and Marta.Finding them was another occasion when the pragmatic nature of the rule was madeclear to don Juan: All of them were exactly what the rule said they were goingto be. Their advent introduced a new cycle for everyone, don Juan's benefactorand his party included. For don Juan and his warriors it meant the cycle ofdreaming, and for his benefactor and his party it meant a period of unequalledimpeccability in their acts. His benefactor explained to don Juan that when he was young and was firstintroduced to the idea of the rule as the means to freedom, he had been elated,transfixed with joy. Freedom to him was a reality around the corner. When hecame to understand the nature of the rule as a map, his hopes and optimism wereredoubled.Later on, sobriety took hold of his life. The older his benefactor got, the lesschance he saw for his success and the success of his party. Finally he becameconvinced that no matter what they did, the odds were too great against theirtenuous human awareness ever flying free. He made peace with himself and hisfate, and surrendered to failure. He told the Eagle from his inner self that hewas glad and proud to have nourished his awareness. The Eagle was welcome to it.Don Juan told us that the same mood was shared by all the members of hisbenefactor's party. The freedom proposed in the rule was something theyconsidered unattainable. They had caught glimpses of the annihilating force thatthe Eagle is, and felt that they did not stand a chance against it. All of themhad agreed, nevertheless, that they would live their lives impeccably for noother reason than to be impeccable.Don Juan said that his benefactor and his party, in spite of their feelings ofinadequacy, or perhaps because of those feelings, did find their freedom. Theydid enter into the third attention- not as a group, however, but one by one. Thefact that they found the passageway was the final corroboration of the truthcontained in the rule. The last one to leave the world of everyday-lifeawareness was his benefactor. He complied with the rule and took don Juan'sNagual woman with him.As the two of them dissolved into total awareness, don Juan and all his warriorswere made to 'explode from within'- he could find no other way of describing thefeeling entailed in being forced to forget all they had witnessed of theirbenefactor's world.The one who never forgot was Silvio Manuel. It was he who engaged don Juan inthe backbreaking effort of bringing back together the members of their group,all of whom had been scattered. He then plunged them into the task of findingthe totality of themselves. It took them years to accomplish both tasks.Don Juan had extensively discussed the topic of forgetting, but only inconnection with their great difficulty in getting together again and startingover without their benefactor. He never told us exactly what it entailed toforget or to gain the totality of oneself. In that respect he was true to hisbenefactor's teachings, only helping us to help ourselves.To this effect, he trained la Gorda and me to see together and was able to showus that, although human beings appear to a seer as luminous eggs, the egglikeshape is an external cocoon; a shell of luminosity that houses a mostintriguing, haunting, mesmeric core made up of concentric circles of yellowishluminosity the color of a candle's flame.During our final session, he had us see people milling around a church. It waslate afternoon, almost dark, yet the creatures inside their rigid, luminouscocoons radiated enough light to render everything around them crystal clear.The sight was wondrous.Don Juan explained that the egg-shaped shells which seemed so bright to us wereindeed dull. The luminosity emanated from the brilliant core: The shell in factdulled its radiance. Don Juan revealed to us that the shell must be broken inorder to liberate that being. It must be broken from the inside at the righttime, just as creatures that hatch out of eggs break their shells. If they failto do so, they suffocate and die. As with creatures that hatch out of eggs,there is no way for a warrior to break the shell of his luminosity until thetime is right.Don Juan told us that losing the human form was the only means of breaking thatshell, the only means of liberating that haunting luminous core; the core ofawareness which is the Eagle's food. To break the shell means remembering theother self, and arriving at the totality of oneself. Don Juan and his warriors did arrive at the totality of themselves, and turnedthen to their last task, which was to find a new pair of double beings. Don Juansaid that they thought it was going to be a simple matter- everything else hadbeen relatively easy for them. They had no idea that the apparent effortlessnessof their accomplishments as warriors was a consequence of their benefactor'smastery and personal power.Their quest for a new pair of double beings was fruitless. In all theirsearching, they never came across a double woman. They found several double men,but those double men were all well-situated, busy, prolific, and so satisfiedwith their lives that it would have been useless to approach them. Those menfelt that they did not need to find purpose in life: They thought they hadalready found it.Don Juan said that one day he realized that he and his group were getting old,and there seemed to be no hope of ever accomplishing their task. That was thefirst time they felt the sting of despair and impotence.Silvio Manuel insisted that they should resign themselves and live impeccablywithout hope of finding their freedom. It seemed plausible to don Juan that thismight indeed be the key to everything.In this respect he found himself following in his benefactor's footsteps. Hecame to accept that an unconquerable pessimism overtakes a warrior at a certainpoint on his path. A sense of defeat, or perhaps more accurately, a sense ofunworthiness, comes upon him almost unawares.Don Juan said that, before, he used to laugh at his benefactor's doubts andcould not bring himself to believe that he worried in earnest. In spite of theprotests and warnings of Silvio Manuel, don Juan had thought it was all a giantploy designed to teach them something. Since he could not believe that hisbenefactor's doubts were real, neither could he believe that his benefactor'sresolution to live impeccably without hope of freedom was genuine.When don Juan finally grasped that his benefactor, in all seriousness, hadresigned himself to fail, it also dawned on don Juan that a warrior's resolutionto live impeccably in spite of everything cannot be approached as a strategy toensure success.Don Juan and his party proved this truth for themselves when they realized for afact that the odds against them were astonishing. Don Juan said that at suchmoments a lifelong training takes over, and the warrior enters into a state ofunsurpassed humility: When the true poverty of his human resources becomesundeniable, the warrior has no recourse but to step back and lower his head.Don Juan marveled that this realization seems to have no effect on the femalewarriors of a party: The disarray seems to leave them unfazed.He told us that he had noted this in his benefactor's party: the females werenever as worried and morose about their fate as were the males. They seemedsimply to acquiesce in the judgment of don Juan's benefactor and followed himwithout showing signs of emotional wear and tear. If the women were ruffled atsome level, they were indifferent to it. To be busy was all that counted forthem. It was as if only the males had bid for freedom and felt the impact of acounter-bidding.In his own group, don Juan observed the same contrast. The women readily agreedwith him when he said that his resources were inadequate. He could only concludethat the women, although they never mentioned it, had never believed they hadany resources to begin with. There was consequently no way they could feeldisappointed or despondent at finding out they were impotent: They had known itall along.Don Juan told us that the reason the Eagle demanded twice as many femalewarriors as males was precisely because females have an inherent balance whichis lacking in males. At the crucial moment, it is the men who get hysterical andcommit suicide if they judge that everything is lost. A woman may kill herselfdue to lack of direction and purpose, but not because of the failure of a systemto which she happens to belong.After don Juan and his party of warriors had given up hope- or rather, as donJuan put it, after he and the male warriors had reached rock bottom and thewomen had found suitable ways to humor them- don Juan finally stumbled upon adouble man he could approach.I was that double man. He said that since no one in his right mind is going tovolunteer for such a preposterous project as a struggle for freedom, he had tofollow his benefactor's teachings and, in true stalker's style, reel me in as hehad reeled in the members of his own party. He needed to have me alone at aplace where he could apply physical pressure to my body, and it was necessarythat I go there of my own accord. He lured me into his house with great ease. Ashe said, securing the double man is never a great problem, the difficulty is tofind one who is available.That first visit to his house was, from the point of view of my daily awareness,an uneventful session. Don Juan was charming and joked with me. He guided theconversation to the fatigue the body experiences after long drives; a subjectthat seemed thoroughly inconsequential to me as a student of anthropology.Then he made the casual comment that my back appeared to be out of alignment,and without another word put a hand on my chest and straightened me up and gaveme a sound rap on the back. He caught me so unprepared that I blacked out. WhenI opened my eyes again I felt as if he had broken my spine, but I knew that Iwas different. I was someone else and not the me I knew. From then on, wheneverI saw him he would make me shift from my right-side awareness to my left, andthen he would reveal the rule to me.Almost immediately after finding me, don Juan encountered a double woman. He didnot put me in touch with her through a scheme, as his benefactor had done withhim; but devised a ploy, as effective and elaborate as any of his benefactor's,by which he himself enticed and secured the double woman. He assumed this burdenbecause he believed that it was the benefactor's duty to secure both doublebeings immediately upon finding them, and then to put them together as partnersin an inconceivable enterprise.He told me that one day when he was living in Arizona, he had gone to agovernment office to fill out an application. The lady at the desk told him totake it to an employee in the adjacent section, and without looking she pointedto her left.Don Juan followed the direction of her outstretched arm and saw a double womansitting at a desk. When he took his application to her he realized that she wasjust a young girl. She told him that she had nothing to do with applications.Nevertheless, out of sympathy for a poor old Indian, she took the time to helphim process it.Some legal documents were needed, documents which don Juan had in his pocket,but he pretended total ignorance and helplessness. He made it seem that thebureaucratic organization was an enigma to him. It was not difficult at all toportray total mindlessness, don Juan said. All he had to do was revert to whathad once been his normal state of awareness.It was to his purpose to prolong his interaction with the girl for as long as hecould. His mentor had told him, and he himself had verified it in his search,that double women are quite rare. His mentor had also warned him that they haveinner resources that make them highly volatile. Don Juan was afraid that if hedid not play his cards expertly she would leave.He played on her sympathy to gain time. He created further delay by pretendingthat the legal documents were lost. Nearly every day he would bring in adifferent one to her. She would read it and regretfully tell him that it was notthe right one. The girl was so moved by his sorry condition that she evenvolunteered to pay for a lawyer to draw him up an affidavit in lieu of thepapers.After three months of this, don Juan thought it was time to produce thedocuments. By then she had gotten used to him and almost expected to see himevery day. Don Juan came one last time to express his thanks and say goodbye. Hetold her that he would have liked to bring her a gift to show his appreciation,but he did not have money even to eat.She was moved by his candor and took him to lunch. As they were eating he musedthat a gift does not necessarily have to be an object that one buys. It could besomething that is only for the eyes of the beholder. Something to rememberrather than to possess.She was intrigued by his words. Don Juan reminded her that she had expressedcompassion for the Indians and their condition as paupers. He asked her if shewould like to see the Indians in a different light- not as paupers but asartists. He told her that he knew an old man who was the last of his line ofpower dancers. He assured her that the man would dance for her at his request;and furthermore, he promised her that never in her life had she seen anythinglike it, nor would she ever again. It was something that only Indians witnessed.She was delighted at the idea. She picked him up after her work, and they headedfor the hills where he told her the Indian lived. Don Juan took her to his ownhouse. He made her stop the car quite a distance away, and they began to walkthe rest of the way. Before they reached the house he stopped and drew a linewith his foot in the sandy, dried dirt. He told her that the line was a boundaryand coaxed her to step across.The Nagual woman herself told me that up to that point she had been veryintrigued with the possibility of witnessing a genuine Indian dancer, but whenthe old Indian drew a line on the dirt and called it a boundary, she began tohesitate. Then she became outright alarmed when he told her that the boundarywas for her alone, and that once she stepped over it there was no way ofreturning.The Indian apparently saw her consternation and tried to put her at ease. Hepolitely patted her on the arm and gave her his guarantee that no harm wouldcome to her while he was around. The boundary could be explained, he told her,as a form of symbolic payment to the dancer because he did not want money.Ritual was in lieu of money, and ritual required that she step over the boundaryof her own accord.The old Indian gleefully stepped over the line and told her that to him all ofit was sheer Indian nonsense, but that the dancer, who was watching them frominside the house, had to be humored if she wanted to see him dance.The Nagual woman said that she suddenly became so afraid that she could not moveto cross the line. The old Indian made an effort to persuade her, saying thatstepping over that boundary was beneficial to the entire body. Crossing it hadnot only made him feel younger, it had actually made him younger, such power didthat boundary have. To demonstrate his point, he crossed back again andimmediately his shoulders slouched, the corners of his mouth drooped, his eyeslost their shine. The Nagual woman could not deny the differences the crossingshad made.Don Juan recrossed the line a third time. He breathed deeply, expanding hischest, his movements brisk and bold. The Nagual woman said that the thoughtcrossed her mind that he might even make sexual advances. Her car was too faraway to make a run for it. The only thing she could do was to tell herself thatit was stupid to fear that old Indian.Then the old man made another appeal to her reason and to her sense of humor. Ina conspiratorial tone, as if he were revealing a secret with some reluctance, hetold her that he was just pretending to be young to please the dancer, and thatif she did not help him by crossing the line, he was going to faint at anymoment from the stress of walking without slouching. He walked back and forthacross the line to show her the immense strain involved in his pantomime.The Nagual woman said that his pleading eyes revealed the pain his old body wasgoing through to mimic youth. She crossed the line to help him and be done withit: She wanted to go home.The moment she crossed the line, don Juan took a prodigious jump and glided overthe roof of the house. The Nagual woman said that he flew like a huge boomerang.When he landed next to her she fell on her back. Her fright was beyond anythingshe had ever experienced, but so was her excitement at having witnessed such amarvel. She did not even ask how he had accomplished such a magnificent feat.She wanted to run back to her car and head for home.The old man helped her up and apologized for having tricked her. In fact, hesaid, he himself was the dancer and his flight over the house had been hisdance. He asked her if she had paid attention to the direction of his flight.The Nagual woman circled her hand counterclockwise.He patted her head paternally and told her that it was very auspicious that shehad been attentive. Then he said that she may have injured her back in her fall,and that he could not just let her go without making sure she was all right.Boldly, he straightened her shoulders, and lifted her chin and the back of herhead, as if he were directing her to extend her spine. He then gave her a soundsmack between her shoulder blades, literally knocking all the air out of herlungs. For a moment she was unable to breathe and she fainted.When she regained consciousness, she was inside his house. Her nose wasbleeding, her ears were buzzing, her breathing was accelerated, and she couldnot focus her eyes. He instructed her to take deep breaths to a count of eight.The more she breathed, the clearer everything became. At one point, she told me,the whole room became incandescent: Everything glowed with an amber light.She became stupefied and could not breathe deeply any more. The amber light bythen was so thick it resembled fog. Then the fog turned into amber cobwebs. Itfinally dissipated, but the world remained uniformly amber for a while longer.Don Juan began to talk to her then. He took her outside the house and showed herthat the world was divided into two halves. The left side was clear but theright side was veiled in amber fog. He told her that it is monstrous to thinkthat the world is understandable or that we ourselves are understandable. Hesaid that what she was perceiving was an enigma; a mystery that one could onlyaccept in humbleness and awe.He then revealed the rule to her. Her clarity of mind was so intense that sheunderstood everything he said. The rule seemed to her appropriate andself-evident.He explained to her that the two sides of a human being are totally separate andthat it takes great discipline and determination to break that seal and go fromone side to the other. A double being has a great advantage: The condition ofbeing double permits relatively easy movement between the compartments on theright side. The great disadvantage of double beings is that by virtue of havingtwo compartments they are sedentary, conservative, afraid of change.Don Juan said to her that his intention had been to make her shift from herextreme right compartment to her more lucid, sharper left-right side; butinstead, through some inexplicable quirk, his blow had sent her all across herdoubleness, from her everyday extreme-right side to her extreme-left side.He tried four times to make her revert back to a normal state of awareness, butto no avail. His blows helped her, however, to turn her perception of the wallof fog on and off at will. Although he had not intended it, don Juan had beenright in saying that the line was a one-way boundary for her. Once she crossedit, just like Silvio Manuel, she never returned. When don Juan put the Nagual woman and me face to face, neither of us had knownof the other's existence, yet we instantly felt that we were familiar with oneanother. Don Juan knew from his own experience that the solace double beingsfeel in each other's company is indescribable, and far too brief.He told us that we had been put together by forces incomprehensible to ourreason, and that the only thing we did not have was time. Every minute might bethe last; therefore, it had to be lived with the spirit.Once don Juan had put us together, all that was left for him and his warriors todo was find four female stalkers, three male warriors, and one male courier tomake up our party.To that end, don Juan found Lydia, Josefina, la Gorda, Rosa, Benigno, Nestor,Pablito, and the courier Eligio. Each one of them was a replica in anundeveloped form of the members of don Juan's own party. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"12. The 'Not-Doings' of Silvio Manuel Don Juan and his warriors sat back to allow the Nagual woman and myself room toenact the rule- that is, to nourish, enhance, and lead the eight warriors tofreedom. Everything seemed perfect, yet something was wrong.The first set of female warriors don Juan had found were dreamers when theyshould have been stalkers. He did not know how to explain this anomaly. [*anomaly- deviation from the normal or common order or form or rule] He couldonly conclude that power had put those women in his path in a manner that madeit impossible to refuse them.There was another striking anomaly that was even more baffling to don Juan andhis party: Three of the women and the three male warriors were incapable ofentering into a state of heightened awareness, despite don Juan's titanicefforts. They were groggy, out of focus, and could not break the seal; themembrane that separates their two sides. They were nicknamed the drunkardsbecause they staggered around without muscular coordination.The courier Eligio and la Gorda were the only ones with an extraordinary degreeof awareness, especially Eligio who was par with any of don Juan's own people.The three girls clustered together and made an unshakable unit. So did the threemen. Groups of three when the rule prescribes four were something ominous. Thenumber three is a symbol of dynamics, change, movement, and above all, a symbolof revitalization.The rule was no longer serving as a map. And yet it was not conceivable that anerror was involved. Don Juan and his warriors argued that power does not makemistakes. They pondered the question in their dreaming and seeing. They wonderedwhether they had perhaps been too hasty, and simply had not seen that the threewomen and the three men were inept.Don Juan confided to me that he saw two relevant questions. One was thepragmatic problem of our presence among them.The other was the question of the rule's validity. Their benefactor had guidedthem to the certainty that the rule encompassed everything a warrior might beconcerned with. He had not prepared them for the eventuality that the rule mightprove to be inapplicable.La Gorda said that the women of don Juan's party never had any problems with me.It was only the males who were at a loss. To the men, it was incomprehensibleand unacceptable that the rule was incongruous in my case. The women, however,were confident that sooner or later the reason for my being there was going tobe made clear.I had observed how the women kept themselves detached from the emotionalturmoil, seeming to be completely unconcerned with the outcome. They seemed toknow without any reasonable doubt that my case had to be somehow included in therule. After all, I had definitely helped them by accepting my role. Thanks tothe Nagual woman and myself, don Juan and his party had completed their cycleand were almost free.The answer came to them at last through Silvio Manuel. His seeing revealed thatthe three little sisters and the Genaros were not inept. It was rather that Iwas not the right Nagual for them. I was incapable of leading them because I hadan unsuspected configuration that did not match the pattern laid down by therule; a configuration which don Juan as a seer had overlooked. My luminous bodygave the appearance of having four compartments when in reality it had onlythree. There was another rule for what they called a 'three pronged Nagual'. Ibelonged to that other rule.Silvio Manuel said that I was like a bird hatched by the warmth and care ofbirds of a different species. All of them were still bound to help me, as Imyself was bound to do anything for them, but I did not belong with them.Don Juan assumed responsibility for me because he had brought me into theirmidst, but my presence among them forced them all to exert themselves to themaximum, searching for two things: an explanation of what I was doing amongthem, and a solution to the problem of what to do about it.Silvio Manuel very quickly hit upon a way to dislodge me from their midst. Hetook over the task of directing the project, but since he did not have thepatience or energy to deal with me personally, he commissioned don Juan to do soas his surrogate.Silvio Manuel's goal was to prepare me for a moment when a courier bearing therule pertinent to a three pronged Nagual would make himself or herself availableto me. He said that it was not his role to reveal that portion of the rule. Ihad to wait, just as all the others had to wait, for the right time.There was still another serious problem that added more confusion. It had to dowith la Gorda, and in the long run with me. La Gorda had been accepted into myparty as a southerly woman. Don Juan and the rest of his seers had attested toit. She seemed to be in the same category with Cecilia, Delia, and the twofemale couriers. The similarities were undeniable. Then la Gorda lost all hersuperfluous weight and slimmed down to half her size. The change was so radicaland profound that she became something else.She had gone unnoticed for a long time simply because all the other warriorswere too preoccupied with my difficulties to pay any attention to her. Herchange was so drastic, however, that they were forced to focus on her, and whatthey saw that she was not a southerly woman at all. The bulkiness of her bodyhad misled their previous seeing.They remembered then that from the first moment she came into their midst, laGorda could not really get along with Cecilia, Delia, and the other southerlywomen. She was, on the other hand, utterly charmed and at ease with Nelida andFlorinda, because in fact she had always been like them. That meant that therewere two northerly dreamers in my party, la Gorda and Rosa- a blatantdiscrepancy with the rule.Don Juan and his warriors were more than baffled. They understood everythingthat was happening as an omen, an indication that things had taken anunforeseeable turn. Since they could not accept the idea of human erroroverriding the rule, they assumed that they had been made to err by a superiorcommand, for a reason which was difficult to discern but real.They pondered the question of what to do next, but before any of them came upwith an answer, a true southerly woman, dona Soledad, came into the picture withsuch a force that it was impossible for them to refuse her. She was congruouswith the rule. She was a stalker.Her presence distracted us for a time. For a while it seemed as if she weregoing to pull us off to another plateau. She created vigorous movement. Florindatook her under her wing to instruct her in the art of stalking. But whatevergood it did, it was not enough to remedy a strange loss of energy that I felt, alistlessness that seemed to be increasing. Then one day Silvio Manuel said that in his dreaming he had received a masterplan. He was exhilarated and went off to discuss its details with don Juan andthe other warriors. The Nagual woman was included in their discussions, but Iwas not. This made me suspect that they did not want me to find out what SilvioManuel had discovered about me.I confronted every one of them with my suspicions. They all laughed at me,except for the Nagual woman, who told me that I was right. Silvio Manuel'sdreaming had revealed the reason for my presence among them, but I would have tosurrender to my fate, which was not to know the nature of my task until I wasready for it.There was such finality in her tone that I could only accept without questioneverything she said. I think that if don Juan or Silvio Manuel had told me thesame thing, I would not have acquiesced so easily.She also said that she disagreed with don Juan and the others. She thought Ishould be informed of the general purpose of their actions, if only to avoidunnecessary friction and rebelliousness.Silvio Manuel intended to prepare me for my task by taking me directly into thesecond attention. He planned a series of bold actions that would galvanize myawareness.In the presence of all the others, he told me that he was taking over myguidance and that he was shifting me to his area of power; the night. Theexplanation he gave was that a number of not-doings had presented themselves tohim in dreaming. They were designed for a team composed of la Gorda and myselfas the doers, and the Nagual woman as the overseer.Silvio Manuel was awed by the Nagual woman and had only words of admiration forher. He said that she was in a class by herself. She could perform on a par withhim or any of the other warriors of his party. She did not have experience, butshe could manipulate her attention in any way she needed. He confessed that herprowess was as great a mystery to him as was my presence among them, and thather sense of purpose and her conviction were so keen that I was no match forher. In fact, he asked la Gorda to give me special support, so I could withstandthe Nagual woman's contact. For our first not-doing, Silvio Manuel constructed a wooden crate big enough tohouse la Gorda and me if we sat back-to-back with our knees up. The crate had alid made of lattice-work to let in a flow of air.La Gorda and I were to climb inside it and sit in total darkness and totalsilence without falling asleep. He began by letting us enter the box for shortperiods. Then he increased the time as we got used to the procedure until wecould spend the entire night inside it without moving or dozing off.The Nagual woman stayed with us to make sure that we would not change levels ofawareness due to fatigue. Silvio Manuel said that our natural tendency underunusual conditions of stress is to shift from the heightened state of awarenessto our normal one, and vice versa.The general effect of the not-doing every time we performed it was to give us anunequalled sense of rest; which was a complete puzzle to me, since we never fellasleep during our nightlong vigils. I attributed the sense of rest to the factthat we were in a state of heightened awareness, but Silvio Manuel said that theone had nothing to do with the other; that the sense of rest was the result ofsitting with our knees up. The second not-doing consisted of making us lie on the ground like curled-updogs, almost in the fetal position, resting on our left sides, our foreheads onour folded arms. Silvio Manuel insisted that we keep our eyes closed as long aspossible, opening them only when he told us to shift positions and lie on ourright sides.He told us that the purpose of this not-doing was to allow our sense of hearingto separate from our sight. As before, he gradually increased the length of timeuntil we could spend the entire night in auditory vigil. Silvio Manuel was then ready to move us to another area of activity. Heexplained that in the first two not-doings we had broken a certain perceptualbarrier while we were stuck to the ground.By way of analogy, he compared human beings to trees. We are like mobile trees.We are somehow rooted to the ground. Our roots are transportable, but that doesnot free us from the ground.He said that in order to establish balance we had to perform the third not-doingwhile dangling in the air. If we succeeded in channeling our intent while wewere suspended from a tree inside a leather harness, we would make a trianglewith our intent, a triangle whose base was on the ground and its vertex in theair. Silvio Manuel thought that we had gathered our attention with the first twonot-doings to the point that we could perform the third perfectly from thebeginning.One night he suspended la Gorda and me in two separate harnesses like strapchairs. We sat in them and he lifted us with a pulley to the highest largebranches of a tall tree. He wanted us to pay attention to the awareness of thetree which he said would give us signals since we were its guests. He made theNagual woman stay on the ground and call our names from time to time during theentire night.While we were suspended from the tree in the innumerable times we performed thisnot-doing, we experienced a glorious flood of physical sensations like mildcharges of electrical impulses.During the first three or four attempts, it had been as if the tree wereprotesting our intrusion. Then after that, the impulses became signals of peaceand balance.Silvio Manuel told us that the awareness of a tree draws its nourishment fromthe depths of the earth, while the awareness of mobile creatures draws it fromthe surface. There is no sense of strife in a tree, whereas moving beings arefilled to the brim with it.His contention was that perception suffers a profound jolt when we are placed instates of quietude in darkness. Our hearing takes the lead then, and the signalsfrom all the living and existing entities around us can be detected- not withour hearing only, but with a combination of the auditory and visual senses, inthat order. He said that in darkness, especially while one is suspended, theeyes become subsidiary to the ears.He was absolutely right, as la Gorda and I discovered. Through the exercise ofthe third not-doing, Silvio Manuel gave a new dimension to our perception of theworld around us. He then told la Gorda and me that the next set of three not-doings would beintrinsically different and more complex. These had to do with learning tohandle the other world. It was mandatory to maximize their effect by moving ourtime of action to the evening or predawn twilight.He told us that the first not-doing of the second set had two stages. In stageone we had to bring ourselves to our keenest state of heightened awareness so asto detect the wall of fog. Once that was done, stage two consisted of makingthat wall stop rotating in order to venture into the world between the parallellines.He warned us that what he was aiming at was to place us directly into the secondattention, without any intellectual preparation. He wanted us to learn itsintricacies without rationally understanding what we were doing.His contention was that a magical deer or a magical coyote handles the secondattention without having any intellect. Through the forced practice ofjourneying behind the wall of fog, we were going to undergo, sooner or later, apermanent alteration in our total being; an alteration that would make us acceptthat the world between the parallel lines is real because it is part of thetotal world; just as our luminous body is part of our total being.Silvio Manuel also said that he was using la Gorda and me to probe into thepossibility that we could someday help the other apprentices by ushering theminto the other world; in which case they could accompany the Nagual Juan Matusand his party in their definitive journey.He reasoned that since the Nagual woman had to leave this world with the NagualJuan Matus and his warriors, the apprentices had to follow her because she wastheir only leader in the absence of a Nagual man. He assured us that she wascounting on us; that this was the reason she was supervising our work.Silvio Manuel had la Gorda and me sit down on the ground in the area in back ofhis house, where we had performed all the not-doings. We did not need don Juan'said to enter into our keenest state of awareness. Almost immediately I saw thewall of fog. La Gorda did too. Yet no matter how we tried, we could not stop itsrotation. Every time I moved my head, the wall moved with it.The Nagual woman was able to stop it and go through it by herself, but for allher efforts she could not take the two of us with her. Finally don Juan andSilvio Manuel had to stop the wall for us and physically push us through it. Thesensation I had upon entering into that wall of fog was that my body was beingtwisted like the braids of a rope.On the other side, there was the horrible desolate plain with small round sanddunes. There were very low yellow clouds around us, but no sky or horizon. Banksof pale yellow vapor impaired visibility. It was very difficult to walk.The pressure seemed much greater than what my body was used to. La Gorda and Iwalked aimlessly, but the Nagual woman seemed to know where she was going. Thefurther we went away from the wall, the darker it got and the more difficult itwas to move. La Gorda and I could no longer walk erect. We had to crawl. I lostmy strength and so did la Gorda. The Nagual woman had to drag us back to thewall and out of there.We repeated our journey innumerable times. At first we were aided by don Juanand Silvio Manuel in stopping the wall of fog, but then la Gorda and I becamealmost as proficient as the Nagual woman. We learned to stop the rotation ofthat wall.It happened quite naturally to us. In my case, on one occasion I realized thatmy intent was the key; a special aspect of my intent because it was not myvolition as I know it.It was an intense desire that was focused on the midpoint of my body. It was apeculiar nervousness that made me shudder and then it turned into a force thatdid not really stop the wall, but made some part of my body turn involuntarilyninety degrees to the right. The result was that for an instant I had two pointsof view. I was looking at the world divided in two by the wall of fog and at thesame time I was staring directly at a bank of yellowish vapor. The latter viewgained predominance and something pulled me into the fog and beyond it.Another thing that we learned was to regard that place as real. Our journeysacquired for us the factuality of an excursion into the mountains, or a seavoyage in a sailboat. The deserted plain with sand-dune like mounds was as realto us as any part of the world.La Gorda and I had the rational feeling that the three of us spent an eternityin the world between the parallel lines, yet we were unable to remember whatexactly transpired there. We could only remember the terrifying moments when wewould have to leave it to return to the world of everyday life. It was always amoment of tremendous anguish and insecurity.Don Juan and all his warriors followed our endeavors with great curiosity, butthe one who was strangely absent from all our activities was Eligio. Although hewas himself a peerless warrior comparable to the warriors of don Juan's ownparty, he never took part in our struggle; nor did he help us in any way.La Gorda said that Eligio had succeeded in attaching himself to Emilito and thusdirectly to the Nagual Juan Matus. He was never part of our problem because hecould go into the second attention at the drop of a hat. To him, journeying intothe confines of the second attention was as easy as snapping his fingers. La Gorda reminded me of the day when Eligio's unusual talents allowed him tofind out that I was not their man long before anyone else had even an inkling ofthe truth...I had been sitting on the back porch of Vicente's house in northern Mexico whenEmilito and Eligio suddenly showed up. Everyone took for granted that Emilitohad to disappear for long periods of time. When he would show up again, everyonealso took for granted that he had returned from a voyage. No one asked him anyquestions. He would report his findings first to don Juan and then to whoeverwanted to hear them.On that day it was as if Emilito and Eligio had just come into the house throughthe back door. Emilito was ebullient as ever. Eligio was his usual quiet somberself. I had always thought that when I saw both of them together, that Emilito'sexquisite personality overwhelmed Eligio and made him even more sullen.Emilito went inside looking for don Juan and Eligio opened up to me. He smiledand came to my side. He put his arm around my shoulders and placing his mouth tomy ear whispered that he had broken the seal of the parallel lines and he couldgo into something he said Emilito had called glory.Eligio went on to explain certain things about glory which I was unable tocomprehend. It was as if my mind could only focus on the periphery of thatevent. After explaining it to me, Eligio took me by the hand and made me standin the middle of the patio, looking at the sky with my chin slightly turned up.He was to my right, standing with me in the same position. He told me to let goand fall backwards pulled by the heaviness of the very top of my head. Somethinggrabbed me from behind and pulled me down. There was an abyss behind me. I fellinto it. And then suddenly I was on the desolate plain with dune-like mounds.Eligio urged me to follow him. He told me that the edge of glory was over thehills. I walked with him until I could not move any longer. He ran ahead of mewith no effort at all as if he were made of air. He stood on top of a largemound and pointed beyond. He ran back to me and begged me to crawl up that hillwhich he told me was the edge of glory. It was perhaps only a hundred feet awayfrom me, but I could not move another inch.He tried to drag me up the hill, but he could not budge me. My weight seemed tohave increased a hundred-fold. Eligio finally had to summon don Juan and hisparty. Cecilia lifted me up on her shoulders and carried me out.La Gorda added that Emilito had put Eligio up to it. Emilito was proceedingaccording to the rule. My courier had journeyed into glory. It was mandatorythat he show it to me.I could recollect the eagerness in Eligio's face and the fervor with which heurged me to make one last effort to witness glory. I could also recollect hissadness and disappointment when I failed. He never spoke to me again. La Gorda and I had been so involved in our journeys behind the wall of fog thatwe had forgotten that we were due for the next not-doing of the series withSilvio Manuel. He told us that it could be devastating, and that it consisted ofcrossing the parallel lines with the three little sisters and the three Genarosdirectly into the entrance to the world of total awareness. He did not includedona Soledad because his not-doings were only for dreamers and she was astalker.Silvio Manuel added that he expected us to become familiar with the thirdattention by placing ourselves at the foot of the Eagle over and over. Heprepared us for the jolt.He explained that a warrior's journeys into the desolate sand dunes is apreparatory step for the real crossing of boundaries. To venture behind the wallof fog while one is in a state of heightened awareness or while one is doingdreaming entails only a very small portion of our total awareness, while tocross bodily into the other world entails engaging our total being.Silvio Manuel had conceived the idea of using the bridge as the symbol of a truecrossing. He reasoned that the bridge was adjacent to a power spot; and powerspots are cracks, passageways into the other world. He thought that it waspossible that la Gorda and I had acquired enough strength to withstand a glimpseof the Eagle.He announced that it was my personal duty to round up the three women and thethree men and help them get into their keenest states of awareness. It was theleast I could do for them, since I had perhaps been instrumental in destroyingtheir chances for freedom.He moved our time of action to the hour just before dawn, or the morningtwilight. I dutifully attempted to make them shift awareness, as don Juan did tome. Since I had no idea how to manipulate their bodies or what I really had todo with them, I ended up beating them on the back.After several grueling attempts on my part, don Juan finally intervened. He gotthem as ready as they could possibly be and handed them over to me to herd likecattle onto the bridge. My task was to take them one by one across that bridge.The power spot was on the south side, a very auspicious omen. Silvio Manuelplanned to cross first, wait for me to deliver them to him and then usher us asa group into the unknown.Silvio Manuel walked across, followed by Eligio, who did not even glance at me.I held the six apprentices in a tight group on the north side of the bridge.They were terrified. They got loose from my grip and began to run in differentdirections. I caught the three women one by one and succeeded in delivering themto Silvio Manuel.He held them at the entrance of the crack between the worlds. The three men weretoo fast for me. I was too tired to run after them.I looked at don Juan across the bridge for guidance. He and the rest of hisparty and the Nagual woman were clustered together looking at me. They hadcoaxed me with gestures to run after the women or the men, laughing at myfumbling attempts. Don Juan made a gesture with his head to disregard the threemen and to cross over to Silvio Manuel with la Gorda.We crossed. Silvio Manuel and Eligio seemed to be holding the sides of avertical slit the size of a man. The women ran and hid behind la Gorda. SilvioManuel urged all of us to step inside the opening. I obeyed him. The women didnot.Beyond that entrance there was nothing. Yet it was filled to the brim withsomething that was nothing. My eyes were open. All my senses were alert. Istrained myself trying to see in front of me. But there was nothing in front ofme. Or if there was something there, I could not grasp it.My senses did not have the compartmentalization I have learned to regard asmeaningful. Everything came to me at once, or rather nothingness came to me to adegree I had never experienced before or after. I felt that my body was beingtorn apart. A force from within myself was pushing outward. I was bursting, andnot in a figurative way. Suddenly I felt a human hand snatching me out of therebefore I disintegrated.The Nagual woman had crossed over and saved me. Eligio had not been able to movebecause he was holding the opening, and Silvio Manuel had the four women bytheir hair, two in each hand, ready to hurl them in.I assume that the whole event must have taken at least a quarter of an hour tounfold, but at the time it never occurred to me to worry about people around thebridge.Time seemed to have been somehow suspended; just as it became suspended yearslater when the apprentices and I returned to the bridge on our way to MexicoCity.Silvio Manuel said that although the attempt had seemed to be a failure, it wasa total success. The four women did see the aperture and through it into theother world; and what I experienced in there was a true sense of death.\"There is nothing gorgeous or peaceful about death,\" he said, \"because the realterror begins upon dying. With that incalculable force you felt in there, theEagle will squeeze out of you every flicker of awareness you have ever had.\"Silvio Manuel prepared la Gorda and me for another attempt. He explained thatpower spots were actual holes in a sort of canopy that prevents the world fromlosing its shape. A power spot could be utilized as long as one has gatheredenough strength in the second attention.He told us that the key to withstanding the Eagle's presence was the potency ofone's intent. Without intent there was nothing. He said to me that, since I wasthe only one who had stepped into the other world, what had nearly killed me wasmy incapacity to change my intent.He was confident, however, that with forced practice all of us would get toelongate our intent. He could not explain, however, what intent was. He jokedthat only the Nagual Juan Matus could explain it- but that he was not around.Unfortunately our next attempt did not take place because I became depleted ofenergy. It was a swift and devastating loss of vitality. I was suddenly so weakthat I passed out in Silvio Manuel's house.I asked la Gorda whether she knew what happened next: I myself had no idea. LaGorda said that Silvio Manuel told everyone that the Eagle had dislodged me fromtheir group, and that finally I was ready for them to prepare me to carry outthe designs of my fate.His plan was to take me to the world between the parallel lines while I wasunconscious, and let that world draw out all the remaining and useless energyfrom my body. His idea was sound in the judgment of all his companions becausethe rule says that one could only enter in there with awareness. To enterwithout it brings death, since without consciousness the life force is exhaustedby the physical pressure of that world.La Gorda added that they did not take her with me.But the Nagual Juan Matus had told her that once I was empty of vital energy-practically dead- all of them took turns in blowing new energy into my body. Inthat world, anybody who has life force can give it to others by blowing on them.They put their breath in all the spots where there is a storage point. SilvioManuel blew first, then the Nagual woman. The remaining part of me was made upof all the members of the Nagual Juan Matus' party.After they had blown their energy into me, the Nagual woman brought me out ofthe fog to Silvio Manuel's house. She laid me on the ground with my head towardthe southeast.La Gorda said that I looked as if I were dead. She and the Genaros and the threelittle sisters were there. The Nagual woman explained to them that I was ill,but that I was going to come back someday to help them find their freedombecause I would not be free myself until I did that.Silvio Manuel then gave me his breath and brought me back to life. That was whyshe and the little sisters remembered that he was my master. He carried me to mybed and let me sleep, as if nothing had happened. After I woke up I left and didnot return.And then la Gorda forgot because no one ever pushed her into the left sideagain. She went to live in the town where I later found her with the others. TheNagual Juan and Genaro had set up two different households. Genaro took care ofthe men and the Nagual Juan Matus looked after the women.I had gone to sleep feeling depressed, feeble. When I woke up I was in perfectcontrol of myself, ebullient, filled with extraordinary and unfamiliar energy.My well-being was marred only by don Juan's telling me that I had to leave laGorda and strive alone to perfect my attention until one day when I would beable to return to help her. He also told me not to fret or get discouraged, forthe carrier of the rule would eventually make himself or herself known to me inorder to reveal my true task.Afterward I did not see don Juan for a very long time. When I came back, he kepton making me shift from the right to the left side awareness for two purposes;first, so I could continue my relationship with his warriors and the Nagualwoman; and second, so he could put me under the direct supervision of Zuleica,with whom I had a steady interaction throughout the remaining years of myassociation with don Juan.He told me that the reason he had to entrust me to Zuleica was because accordingto Silvio Manuel's master plan there were to be two kinds of instruction for me,one for the right side and one for the left.The right side instruction pertained to the state of normal consciousness andhad to do with leading me to the rational conviction that there is another typeof awareness concealed in human beings. Don Juan was in charge of thisinstruction.The left side instruction had been assigned to Zuleica. It was related to thestate of heightened awareness, and had to do exclusively with the handling ofthe second attention.Thus every time I went to Mexico I would spend half of my time with Zuleica, andthe other half with don Juan. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"13. The Intricacies of Dreaming Don Juan began the task of ushering me into the second attention by telling methat I had already had a great deal of experience in entering into it- SilvioManuel had taken me to the very entrance.The flaw had been that I had not been given the appropriate rationales. Malewarriors must be given serious reasons before they safely venture into theunknown. Female warriors are not subject to this and can go without anyhesitation, providing that they have total confidence in whoever is leadingthem.He told me that I had to start by learning first the intricacies of dreaming. Hethen put me under Zuleica's supervision. He admonished me to be impeccable andpractice meticulously whatever I learned, and above all, to be careful anddeliberate in my actions so as not to exhaust my life force in vain. He saidthat the prerequisite for entrance into any of the three stages of attention isthe possession of life force, because without it warriors cannot have directionand purpose. He explained that upon dying our awareness also enters into thethird attention; but only for an instant as a purging action just before theEagle devours it.La Gorda said that the Nagual Juan Matus made every one of the apprentices learndreaming. She thought that all of them were given this task at the same time Iwas. Their instruction was also divided into right and left. She said that theNagual and Genaro provided the instruction for the state of normal awareness.When they judged that the apprentices were ready, the Nagual made them shiftinto a state of heightened awareness and left them with their respectivecounterparts.Vicente taught Nestor, Silvio Manuel taught Benigno, Genaro taught Pablito.Lydia was taught by Hermelinda, and Rosa by Nelida. La Gorda added that Josefinaand she were put under the care of Zuleica in order to learn together the finerpoints of dreaming so they would be able to come to my aid someday.Moreover, la Gorda deduced on her own that the men were also taken to Florindato be taught stalking. The proof of this was their drastic change of behavior.She claimed that she knew, before she remembered anything, that she had beentaught the principles of stalking but in a very superficial manner. She had notbeen made to practice.The men were given practical knowledge and tasks. Their behavioral change wasthe proof. They became lighthearted and jovial. They enjoyed their lives, whileshe and the other women, because of their dreaming became progressively moresomber and morose.La Gorda believed that the men were unable to remember their instruction when Iasked them to reveal their stalking knowledge to me, because they practiced itwithout knowing what they were doing. Their training was revealed, however, intheir dealings with people. They were consummate artists in bending people totheir wishes.Through their stalking practice, the men had even learned controlled folly. Forexample, they carried on as if Soledad were Pablito's mother. To any onlooker,it would seem that they were mother and son pitted against each other when inreality they were acting out a part. They convinced everybody. Sometimes Pablitowould give such a performance that he would even convince himself. La Gorda confessed that all of the apprentices were more than baffled by mybehavior after I returned to Mexico following the departure of don Juan and hiswarriors. The apprentices did not know whether I was insane, or was myself amaster of controlled folly: I gave all the outward indications that I believedtheir masquerade.Soledad told them not to be fooled because I was indeed insane. I appeared to bein control, but I was so completely aberrated that I could not behave like aNagual. She engaged every one of the women in delivering a deadly blow to me.She told them that I had requested it myself at one time when I had been incontrol of my faculties. La Gorda said that it took her several years under Zuleica's guidance to learndreaming. When the Nagual Juan Matus had judged that she was proficient, hefinally took her to her true counterpart, Nelida.It was Nelida who showed her how to behave in the world. She groomed her notonly to be at ease in Western clothes, but to have good taste. Thus when she puton her city clothes in Oaxaca and amazed me with her charm and poise, she wasalready experienced in that transformation. Zuleica was very effective as my guide into the second attention. She insistedthat our interaction take place only at night, and in total darkness. For me,Zuleica was only a voice in the dark; a voice that started every contact we hadby telling me to focus my attention on her words and nothing else. Her voice wasthe woman's voice that la Gorda thought she had heard in dreaming.Zuleica told me that if dreaming is going to be done indoors, it is best to doit in total darkness, while lying down or sitting up on a narrow bed; or betteryet, while sitting inside a coffin-like crib. She thought that outdoors,dreaming should be done in the protection of a cave, in the sandy areas of waterholes, or sitting against a rock in the mountains; never on the flat floor of avalley, or next to rivers, or lakes, or the sea; because flat areas as well aswater were antithetical [* antithetical- sharply contrasted in character orpurpose] to the second attention.Every one of my sessions with her was imbued with mysterious overtones. Sheexplained that the surest way to make a direct hit on the second attention isthrough ritual acts: monotonous chanting; intricate repetitious movements.Her teachings were not about the preliminaries of dreaming which had alreadybeen taught to me by don Juan. Her assumption was that whoever came to heralready knew how to do dreaming; so she dealt exclusively with esoteric pointsof the left side awareness.Zuleica's instructions began one day when don Juan took me to her house. We gotthere late in the afternoon. The place seemed to be deserted, but the front dooropened as we approached. I expected Zoila or Marta to show up but no one was atthe entrance. I felt that whoever had opened the door for us had also moved outof our way very quickly.Don Juan took me inside to the patio and made me sit on a crate that had acushion and had been turned into a bench. The seat on the crate was bumpy, hard,and very uncomfortable. I ran my hand underneath the thin cushion and foundsharp edged rocks. Don Juan said that my situation was unconventional because Ihad to learn the fine points of dreaming in a hurry. Sitting on a hard surfacewas a prop to keep my body from feeling it was in a normal sitting situation.Just a few minutes before arriving at the house, don Juan had made me changelevels of awareness. He said that Zuleica's instruction had to be conducted inthat state in order for me to have the speed that I needed. He admonished me toabandon myself and trust Zuleica implicitly.He then commanded me to focus my gaze with all the concentration I was capableof, and memorize every detail of the patio that was within my field of vision.He insisted that I had to memorize the detail as much as the feeling of sittingthere. He repeated his instructions to make sure that I had understood. Then heleft.It quickly got very dark, and sitting there I started to fret. I had not hadenough time to concentrate on the detail of the patio.I heard a rustling sound just behind me and then Zuleica's voice jolted me. In aforceful whisper she told me to get up and follow her. I automatically obeyedher. I could not see her face, she was only a dark shape walking two steps aheadof me. She led me to an alcove in the darkest hall in her house. Although myeyes were used to the darkness I was still unable to see a thing. I stumbled onsomething and she commanded me to sit down inside a narrow crib and support mylower back with something I thought was a hard cushion.I next felt that she had backed up a few steps behind me; a thing which baffledme completely because I thought that my back was only a few inches from thewall. Speaking from behind me, she ordered me in a soft voice to focus myattention on her words and let them guide me. She told me to keep my eyes openand fixed on a point right in front of me at my eye level; and that this pointwas going to turn from darkness to a bright and pleasing orange-red.Zuleica spoke very softly with an even intonation. I heard every word she said.The darkness around me seemed to have effectively cut off any distractingexternal stimuli. I heard Zuleica's words in a vacuum, and then I realized thatthe silence in that hall was matched by the silence inside me.Zuleica explained that a dreamer must start from a point of color; intense lightor unmitigated darkness are useless to a dreamer in the initial onslaught.Colors such as purple or light green or rich yellow are, on the other hand,stupendous starting points.She preferred, however, orange-red, because through experience it had proven tobe the one that gave her the greatest sensation of rest. She assured me thatonce I had succeeded in entering into the orange-red color I would have ralliedmy second attention permanently- providing that I could be aware of the sequenceof physical events.It took me several sessions with Zuleica's voice to realize with my body whatshe wanted me to do. The advantage of being in a state of heightened awarenesswas that I could follow my transition from a state of vigil to a state ofdreaming. Under normal conditions that transition is blurred, but under thosespecial circumstances I actually felt in the course of one session how my secondattention took over the controls.The first step was an unusual difficulty in breathing. It was not a difficultyin inhaling or exhaling- I was not short of breath- rather, my breathing changedrhythm all of a sudden. My diaphragm began to contract and it forced mymidsection to move in and out with great speed. The result was the fastest shortbreaths I had ever taken. I breathed in the lower part of my lungs and felt agreat pressure in my intestines. I tried unsuccessfully to break the spasms ofmy diaphragm. The harder I tried, the more painful it got.Zuleica ordered me to let my body do whatever was necessary and to forget aboutdirecting or controlling it. I wanted to obey her, but I did not know how. Thespasms, which must have lasted ten to fifteen minutes, subsided as suddenly asthey had appeared and were followed by another strange, shocking sensation.I felt it first as a most peculiar itch; a physical feeling which was notpleasing or displeasing. It was something like a nervous tremor. It became veryintense to the point of forcing me to focus my attention on it in order todetermine where in my body it was happening. I was stunned by the realizationthat it was not taking place anywhere in my physical body, but outside of it;and yet I still felt it.I disregarded Zuleica's order to enter into a patch of coloration that wasforming right at my eye level, and gave myself fully to the exploration of thatstrange sensation outside me. Zuleica must have seen what I was going through.She suddenly began to explain that the second attention belongs to the luminousbody, just as the first attention belongs to the physical body. She said thatthe point where the second attention assembles itself was situated right whereJuan Tuma had described it the first time we met- approximately one and one-halffeet in front of the midpoint between the stomach and the belly button and fourinches to the right.Zuleica ordered me to massage that place; to manipulate it by moving the fingersof both my hands right on that point as if I were playing a harp. She assured methat sooner or later I would end up feeling my fingers going through somethingas thick as water, and that finally I would feel my luminous shell.As I kept on moving my fingers the air got progressively thicker until I felt amass of sorts. An undefined physical pleasure spread all over me. I thought thatI was touching a nerve in my body and felt silly at the absurdity of it. Istopped.Zuleica warned me that if I did not move my fingers she was going to bop me onthe head. The longer I kept up the wavering motion, the closer I felt theitching. It finally got as near as five or six inches from my body. It was as ifsomething in me had shrunk. I actually thought I could feel a dent.I then had another eerie sensation. I was falling asleep and yet I wasconscious. There was a buzzing in my ears, which reminded me of the sound of abullroarer. Next I felt a force rolling me over on my left side without wakingme up. I was rolled very tightly, like a cigar, and was tucked into the itchingdepression. My awareness remained suspended there, incapable of waking up, butso tightly rolled on itself that I could not fall asleep either.I heard Zuleica's voice telling me to look around. I could not open my eyes, butmy tactile sense told me that I was in a ditch, lying on my back. I feltcomfortable and secure. There was such a tightness to my body, such acompactness, that I did not ever want to get up. Zuleica's voice ordered me tostand up and open my eyes. I could not do it. She said that I had to will mymovements; that it was no longer a matter of contracting my muscles to get up.I thought that she was annoyed at my slowness. I realized then that I was fullyconscious, perhaps more conscious than I had ever been in my entire life. Icould think rationally and yet I seemed to be sound asleep. The thought occurredto me that Zuleica had put me in a state of deep hypnosis. It bothered me for aninstant, then it did not matter. I abandoned myself to the feeling of beingsuspended; floating free.I could not hear anything else she said. It was either that she had stoppedtalking to me or that I had shut off the sound of her voice. I did not want toleave that haven. I had never been so peaceful and complete. I lay thereunwilling to get up or to change anything. I could feel the rhythm of mybreathing. Suddenly I woke up.In my next session with Zuleica, she told me that I had succeeded in making adent in my luminosity all by myself, and that making a dent meant bringing adistant point in my luminous shell closer to my physical body; therefore closerto control. She asserted repeatedly that from the moment the body learns to makethat dent, it is easier to enter into dreaming. I agreed with her. I hadacquired a strange impulse; a sensation that my body had instantly learned toreproduce. It was a mixture of feeling at ease, secure, dormant, suspendedwithout tactile sense, and at the same time fully awake; aware of everything. La Gorda said that the Nagual Juan Matus had struggled for years to create thatdent in her- in all three little sisters, and in the Genaros as well, so as togive them the permanent ability to focus their second attention.He had told her that ordinarily the dent is created on the spur of the moment bythe dreamer when it is needed. Then the luminous shell changes back to itsoriginal shape. But in the apprentices' case, since they did not have a Nagualleader, the depression was created from the outside and was a permanent featureof their luminous bodies; a great help, but also a hindrance. It made all ofthem vulnerable and moody.I remembered then that once I had seen and kicked a depression in the luminousshells of Lydia and Rosa. I thought that the dent was at the height of the upperportion of the outside of their right thigh, or perhaps just at the crest oftheir hipbone. La Gorda explained that I had kicked them in the dent of theirsecond attention and that I had nearly killed them. La Gorda said that she and Josefina lived in Zuleica's house for several months.The Nagual Juan Matus had delivered them to her one day after making them shiftlevels of awareness. He did not tell them what they were going to do there, norwhat to expect. He simply left them by themselves in the hall of her house, andwalked away.They sat there until it got dark. Zuleica then came to them. They never saw her:They only heard her voice as if she were talking to them from a point on thewall.Zuleica was very demanding from the moment she took over. She made them undresson the spot and ordered both of them to crawl inside thick fluffy cotton bags,some poncho-like garments that were lying on the floor. The garments coveredthem from neck to toes.Next, she ordered them to sit back to back on a mat in the same alcove where Imyself used to sit. Zuleica told them that their task was to gaze at thedarkness until it began to acquire a hue. After many sessions they indeed beganto see colors in the darkness; at which time Zuleica made them sit side by sideand gaze at the same spot.La Gorda said that Josefina learned very fast, and that one night shedramatically entered into the patch of orange-red by swishing physically out ofthe poncho. La Gorda thought that either Josefina had reached out for the blotchof color or it had reached out for her. The result was that in one instantJosefina was gone from inside the poncho. Zuleica separated them from then on,and la Gorda started her slow, solitary learning.La Gorda's account made me remember that Zuleica had also made me crawl inside afluffy garment. In fact, the commands she used to order me to crawl insiderevealed to me the rationale for its use. She directed me to feel its fluffinesswith my naked skin, especially with the skin of my calves.She repeated over and over that human beings have a superb center of perceptionon the outside of the calves, and that if the skin in that area could be made torelax or be soothed, the scope of our perception would be enhanced in ways thatwould be impossible to fathom rationally. The garment was very soft and warm,and it induced an extraordinary sensation of pleasurable relaxation in my legs.The nerves in my calves became highly stimulated.La Gorda reported the same sensation of physical pleasure. She went as far as tosay that it was the power of that poncho that guided her to find the patch oforange-red color. She was so impressed with the garment that she made herselfone by copying the original. Its effect was not the same, but it still providedher solace and well-being. She said that she and Josefina ended up spending allof their available time inside the ponchos that she had sewn for both of them.Lydia and Rosa had also been placed inside the garment, but they were neverparticularly fond of it. Neither was I.La Gorda explained Josefina's and her own attachment as a direct consequence ofhaving been led to finding their dreaming color while they were inside thegarment. She said that the reason for my indifference to it was the fact that Idid not enter into the area of coloration at all; rather, the hue had come tome.She was right. Something else besides Zuleica's voice dictated the outcome ofthat preparatory phase. By all indications, Zuleica had lead me through the samesteps she had led la Gorda and Josefina.I had stared at the darkness throughout many sessions, and was ready tovisualize the spot of coloration. In fact, I witnessed its entire metamorphosisfrom plain darkness to a precisely outlined blotch of intense brightness.First I was swayed by the external itch. I then focused my attention upon ituntil I ended up entering into a state of restful vigil. It was then that Ifirst became immersed in an orange-red coloration.After I had learned to remain suspended between sleep and vigil, Zuleica seemedto relax her pace. I even believed that she was not in any hurry to get me outof that state. She let me stay in it without interfering, and never asked meabout it; perhaps because her voice was only for commands and not for askingquestions. We never really talked- at least not the way I talked with don Juan.While I was in the state of restful vigil, I realized one time that it wasuseless for me to remain there; that no matter how pleasant it was, itslimitations were blatant.I sensed then a tremor in my body and I opened my eyes, or rather my eyes becameopen by themselves. Zuleica was staring at me. I experienced a moment ofbafflement. I thought I had woken up, and to be faced with Zuleica in the fleshwas something I had not expected. I had gotten used to hearing only her voice.It also surprised me that it was no longer night. I looked around. We were notin Zuleica's house. Then the realization struck me that I was dreaming and Iwoke up.Zuleica started then on another facet of her teachings. She taught me how tomove.She began her instruction by commanding me to place my awareness on the midpointof my body. In my case the midpoint is below the lower edge of my belly button.She told me to sweep the floor with it, that is, make a rocking motion with mybelly as if a broom were attached to it. Throughout countless sessions, Iattempted to accomplish what her voice was urging me to do.She did not allow me to go into a state of restful vigil. It was her intentionto guide me to elicit the perception of sweeping the floor with my midsectionwhile I remained in a waking state. She said that to be on the left sideawareness was enough of an advantage to do well in the exercise.One day, for no reason I could think of, I succeeded in having a vague feelingin the area of my stomach. It was not something defined, and when I focused myattention on it I realized that it was a prickling sensation inside the cavityof my body, not quite in my stomach area but above it. The closer I examined it,the more details I noticed. The vagueness of the sensation soon turned into acertainty. There was a strange connection of nervousness- a prickling sensation-between my solar plexus and my right calf.As the sensation became more acute, I involuntarily brought my right thigh up tomy chest. Thus the two points were as close to each other as my anatomypermitted. I shivered for a moment with an unusual nervousness and then Iclearly felt that I was sweeping the floor with my midsection. It was a tactilesensation that happened over and over every time I rocked my body in my sittingposition.In my next session, Zuleica allowed me to enter into a state of restful vigil.But this time that state was not quite as it had been before. There seemed to bea sort of control in me that curtailed my enjoying it freely as I had done inthe past; a control that also made me focus on the steps I had taken to get intoit.First I noticed the itch on the point of the second attention in my luminousshell. I massaged that point by moving my fingers on it as if I were playing aharp and the point sunk towards my stomach. I felt it almost on my skin.I experienced a prickling sensation on the outside of my right calf. It was amixture of pleasure and pain. The sensation radiated to my whole leg and then tomy lower back.I felt that my buttocks were shaking. My entire body was transfixed by a nervousripple. I thought that my body had been caught upside down in a net. My foreheadand my toes seemed to be touching. I was like a closed U-shape.Then I felt as if I were being folded in two and rolled inside a sheet. Mynervous spasms were what made the sheet roll into itself, with me in the center.When the rolling ended I could not sense my body any more.I was only an amorphous awareness; a nervous spasm wrapped in itself. Thatawareness came to rest inside a ditch, inside a depression of itself.I understood then the impossibility of describing what takes place in dreaming.Zuleica said that the right and left side awareness are wrapped up together.Both of them come to rest in one single bundle in the dent; the depressed centerof the second attention. To do dreaming one needs to manipulate both theluminous body and the physical body.First, the center of assembling for the second attention has to be madeaccessible by being pushed in from the outside by someone else, or sucked infrom within by the dreamer. Second, in order to dislodge the first attention,the centers of the physical body located in the midsection and the calves,especially the right one, have to be stimulated and placed as close to oneanother as possible until they seem to join. Then the sensation of being bundledtakes place and automatically the second attention takes over.Zuleica's explanation, given in commands, was the most cogent way of describingwhat takes place because none of the sensory experiences involved in dreamingare part of our normal inventory of sensory data. All of them were baffling tome.The sensation of an itch- a tingling outside myself- was localized; and becauseof that, the turmoil of my body upon feeling it was minimal.The sensation of being rolled on myself, on the other hand, was by far the mostdisquieting. It included a range of sensations that left my body in a state ofshock. I was convinced that at one point my toes were touching my forehead,which is a position I am not able to attain; and yet I knew beyond the shadow ofa doubt that I was inside a net hanging upside down in a pear shape with my toesright against my forehead. On a physical plane I was sitting down and my thighswere against my chest.Zuleica also said that the feeling of being rolled up like a cigar and placedinside the dent of the second attention was the result of merging my right andleft awareness into a single awareness in which the order of predominance hasbeen switched, and the left has gained supremacy.She challenged me to be attentive enough to catch the reversal motion; the twoattentions again becoming what they normally are with the right holding thereins.I never caught the feelings involved, but her challenge obsessed me to the pointthat I became trapped in deadly vacillations in my effort to watch everything.She had to withdraw her challenge by ordering me to stop my scrutinies, for Ihad other things to do.Zuleica said that first of all I had to perfect my command of moving at will.She began her instruction by directing me time and time again to open my eyeswhile I was in a state of restful vigil. It took a great deal of effort for meto do it.One time my eyes opened suddenly and I saw Zuleica looming over me. I was lyingdown but I could not determine where. The light was extremely bright as if Iwere just underneath a powerful electric bulb, but the light was not shiningdirectly on my eyes. I could see Zuleica without any effort.She ordered me to stand up by willing my movement. She said that I had to pushmyself up with my midsection, that I had three thick tentacles there which Icould use as crutches to lift up my whole body.I tried every conceivable way to get up. I failed. I had a sensation of despairand physical anguish reminiscent of nightmares I used to have as a child inwhich I was unable to wake up and yet I was fully awake desperately trying toscream.Zuleica finally spoke to me. She said that I had to follow a certain sequence,and that it was wasteful and downright dumb of me to fret and get agitated as ifI were dealing with the world of everyday life.Fretting was proper only in the first attention: The second attention wascalmness itself.She wanted me to repeat the sensation I had had of sweeping the floor with mymidsection. I thought that in order to repeat it I would have to be sitting.Without any deliberation on my part I sat up and adopted the position I had usedwhen my body first elicited that sensation.Something in me rocked, and suddenly I was standing. I could not figure out whatI had done to move. I thought that if I started all over again I could catch thesequence. As soon as I had that thought I found myself lying down again. Uponstanding up once more I realized that there was no procedure involved; that inorder to move I had to intend my moving at a very deep level.In other words, I had to be utterly convinced that I wanted to move, or perhapsit would be more accurate to say that I had to be convinced that I needed tomove.Once I had understood that principle, Zuleica made me practice every conceivableaspect of volitional movement. The more I practiced, the clearer it became forme that dreaming was in fact a rational state.Zuleica explained it. She said that in dreaming, the right side, the rationalawareness, is wrapped up inside the left side awareness in order to give thedreamer a sense of sobriety and rationality; but that the influence ofrationality has to be minimal and used only as an inhibiting mechanism toprotect the dreamer from excesses and bizarre undertakings.The next step was learning to direct my dreaming body. From the first time I metZuleica, Don Juan had proposed the task of gazing at the patio as I sat on thecrate. I religiously engaged myself, sometimes for hours, in gazing at it. I wasalways alone in Zuleica's house. It seemed that on the days when I went thereeveryone was gone or was hiding. The silence and the solitude worked in my favorand I succeeded in memorizing the details of that patio.Zuleica presented to me, accordingly, the task of opening my eyes from a stateof restful vigil to see the patio. It took many sessions to accomplish it. Atfirst I would open my eyes and I would see her, and she, with a jerk of herbody, would make me bounce back like a ball into the state of restful vigil.On one of those bounces, I felt an intense tremor. Something that was located inmy feet rattled its way up to my chest and I coughed it up. The scene of thepatio at night came out of me just as if it had emerged out of my bronchialtubes. It was something like the roar of an animal.I heard Zuleica's voice coming to me as a faint murmur. I could not understandwhat she was saying. I vaguely noticed that I was sitting on the crate. I wantedto get up but I felt that I was not solid. It was as if a wind were blowing meaway.Then I heard Zuleica's voice very clearly telling me not to move. I tried toremain motionless but some force pulled me and I woke up in the alcove in thehall. Silvio Manuel was facing me.Typically, after every session of dreaming in Zuleica's house, don Juan would bewaiting for me in the pitch-black hall. He would take me out of the house andmake me shift levels of awareness.This time Silvio Manuel was there. Without saying a word to me, he put me insidea harness and hoisted me up against the beams of the roof. He kept me thereuntil midday at which time don Juan came and let me down. He explained that tobe kept without touching the ground for a period of time tunes the body, andthat it is essential to do this before embarking on a dangerous journey such asthe one I was about to undertake.It took many more sessions of dreaming for me to learn, at last, to open my eyesto see either Zuleica or to see the dark patio. I realized then that she herselfhad been dreaming all along. She had never been in person behind me in thealcove in the hall. I had been right the first night when I thought that my backwas against the wall. Zuleica was merely a voice from dreaming.During one of the dreaming sessions, when I opened my eyes deliberately to seeZuleica, I was shocked to find la Gorda as well as Josefina looming over metogether with Zuleica. The final facet of her teaching began then.Zuleica taught the three of us to journey with her. She said that our firstattention was hooked to the emanations of the earth, while our second attentionwas hooked to the emanations of the universe. What she meant by that was that adreamer by definition is outside the boundaries of the concerns of everydaylife. As a traveler in dreaming then, Zuleica's last task with la Gorda,Josefina, and me was to tune our second attention to follow her around in hervoyages into the unknown.In successive sessions, Zuleica's voice told me that her 'obsession' was goingto lead me to a rendezvous; that in matters of the second attention thedreamer's obsession serves as a guide; and that hers was focused on an actualplace beyond this earth. From that place she was going to call me, and I had touse her voice as a line to pull myself.Nothing happened for two sessions: Zuleica's voice would become more and morefaint as she spoke, and I worried that I was incapable of following her. She hadnot told me what to do. I also experienced an unusual heaviness. I could notbreak a binding force around me that prevented me from getting out of the stateof restful vigil.During the third session, I suddenly opened my eyes without even trying to.Zuleica, la Gorda and Josefina were staring at me. I was standing with them. Iimmediately realized that we were in some place completely unknown to me.The most obvious feature was a brilliant indirect light. The whole scene wasinundated by a white, powerful, neonlike light. Zuleica was smiling as ifinviting us to look around. La Gorda and Josefina seemed to be as cautious as Iwas. They gave me and Zuleica furtive glances.Zuleica signaled us to move around. We were outdoors, standing in the middle ofa glaring circle. The ground seemed to be hard, dark rock, yet it reflected agreat deal of the blinding white light which came from above. The strange thingwas that, although I knew that the light was too intense for my eyes, I was notat all hurt when I looked up and spotted its source. It was the sun. I wasstaring directly at the sun which, perhaps due to the fact that I was dreaming,was intensely white.La Gorda and Josefina were also staring at the sun; apparently without anyinjurious effect. Suddenly I felt frightened. The light was alien to me. It wasa merciless light. It seemed to attack us, creating a wind that I could feel. Icould not sense any heat, however. I believed it to be malignant.In unison, la Gorda, Josefina and I huddled together like frightened childrenaround Zuleica. She held us, and then the white, glaring light began to diminishby degrees until it had completely vanished. In its place there was a mild, verysoothing, yellowish light.I became aware then that we were not in this world. The ground was the color ofwet terra-cotta. There were no mountains, but where we were standing was notflat land either. The ground was cracked and parched. It looked like a rough drysea of terra-cotta. I could see it all around me just as if I were in the middleof the ocean.I looked up. The sky had lost its maddening glare. It was dark, but not blue. Abright, incandescent star was near the horizon. It dawned on me at that instantthat we were in a world with two suns; two stars. One was enormous and had goneover the horizon, the other was smaller or perhaps more distant.I wanted to ask questions, to walk around and look for things. Zuleica signaledus to relax, to wait patiently. But something seemed to be pulling us. Suddenlyla Gorda and Josefina were gone. And I woke up.From that time on I never went back to Zuleica's house. Don Juan would make meshift levels of awareness in his own house or wherever we were, and I wouldenter into dreaming. Zuleica, la Gorda and Josefina were always waiting for me.We went back to the same unearthly scene over and over, until we were thoroughlyfamiliar with it.Whenever we could do it, we would skip the time of glare- the daytime- and gothere at night just in time to witness the rise over the horizon of a colossalcelestial body; something of such magnitude that when it erupted over the jaggedline of the horizon it covered at least half of the one hundred and eightydegree range in front of us. The celestial body was beautiful, and its ascentover the horizon was so breathtaking that I could have stayed there for aneternity, just to witness that sight.The celestial body took up nearly the entire firmament when it reached thezenith. Invariably we would lie on our backs in order to gaze at it. It hadconsistent configurations, which Zuleica taught us to recognize.I realized that it was not a star. Its light was reflected, It must have been anopaque body because the reflected light was mellow in relation to its monumentalsize. There were enormous, unchanging brown spots on its saffron-yellow surface.Zuleica took us systematically on voyages that were beyond words. La Gorda saidthat Zuleica took Josefina even farther and deeper into the unknown, becauseJosefina was, just like Zuleica herself, quite a bit crazy. Neither of them hadthat core of rationality that supplies a dreamer with sobriety, thus they had nobarriers and no interest in finding out rational causes or reasons for anything.The only thing that Zuleica told me about our journeys that sounded like anexplanation was that the dreamers' power to focus on their second attention madethem into living slingshots. The stronger and the more impeccable the dreamerswere, the farther they could project their second attention into the unknown,and the longer their dreaming projection would last.Don Juan said that my journeys with Zuleica were no illusion, and thateverything I had done with her was a step toward the control of the secondattention. In other words, Zuleica was teaching me the perceptual bias of thatother realm.He could not explain, however, the exact nature of those journeys; or perhaps hedid not want to commit himself. He said that if he attempted to explain theperceptual bias of the second attention in terms of the perceptual bias of thefirst, he would only trap himself hopelessly in words. He wanted me to draw myown conclusion, and the more I thought about the whole matter, the clearer itbecame to me that his reluctance was functional.Under Zuleica's guidance during her instruction for the second attention, I madefactual visitations to mysteries that were certainly beyond the scope of myreason, but obviously within the possibilities of my total awareness. I learnedto voyage into something incomprehensible and ended up, like Emilito and JuanTuma, having my own tales of eternity. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"14. Florinda La Gorda and I were in total agreement that by the time Zuleica had finishedteaching us the intricacies of dreaming: we had accepted the undeniable factthat the rule is a map; that there is another awareness concealed in us; andthat it is possible to enter into that awareness.Don Juan had accomplished what the rule prescribed he do.The rule determined that his next movement was to intro-duce me to Florinda; theonly one of his warriors whom I had not met. Don Juan told me that I had to goto her house by myself because whatever transpired between Florinda and myselfwas of no concern to others. He said that Florinda was to be my personal guideexactly as if I were a Nagual like him. He had had that kind of relationshipwith the warrior of his benefactor's party who was comparable to Florinda.Don Juan left me one day at the door of Nelida's house. He told me to walk in;that Florinda was waiting for me inside. \"It's an honor to make your acquaintance,\" I said to the woman who was facing mein the hall.\"I'm Florinda,\" she said.We looked at each other in silence. I was awestruck. My state of awareness wasas keen as it had ever been. Never again have I experienced a comparablesensation.\"That's a beautiful name,\" I managed to say, but I meant more than that.The soft and long enunciation of the Spanish vowels made the name fluid andsonorous; especially the 'i' after the 'r'. The name was not rare; I simply hadnever met anyone, until that day, who was the essence of that name. The woman infront of me fit into it as if it had been made for her, or perhaps as if sheherself had made her person fit into it.Physically she looked exactly like Nelida, except that she seemed moreself-confident; more powerful. She was rather tall and slender. She had theolive skin of Mediterranean peo-ple; Spanish, or perhaps French. She was old andyet she was not feeble or even aged. Her body seemed to be supple and lean: longlegs, angular features, small mouth, a beautifully chiseled nose, dark eyes andbraided white hair; no jowls, no sagging skin on her face and neck. She was oldas if she had been made up to look old. Remembering in retrospect my first meeting with her, I am reminded of somethingthoroughly unrelated but apropos. [* apropos- of an appropriate or pertinentnature]I saw once in a weekly newspaper a reprint of a twenty year old photograph of ayoung Hollywood actress who had been made up to look twenty years older in orderto play the role of an aging woman.Next to it, the paper had printed a current picture of the same actress as shelooked after twenty real years of hard living.Florinda, in my subjective judgment, was like the first picture of the movieactress; a young girl made up to look old. \"What do we have here?\" she said pinching me. \"You don't look like much. Soft.Indulging to the core no doubt.\"Her bluntness reminded me of don Juan's; as did the inner life of her eyes. Ithad occurred to me, looking back at my life with don Juan, that his eyes werealways in repose. One could see no agitation in them. It was not that don Juan'seyes were beautiful to look at. I have seen gorgeous eyes, but never have Ifound them to say anything. Florinda's eyes, like don Juan's, gave me thefeeling that they had witnessed all there is to witness. They were calm, but notbland. The excitement had been driven inward and had turned into something Icould only describe as inner life.Florinda took me through the living room and out to a roofed patio. We sat onsome comfortable sofalike chairs. Her eyes seemed to look for something in myface.She asked, \"Do you know who I am and what I'm supposed to do for you?\"I said that all I knew about her and her relation to me was what don Juan hadsketched out. In the course of explaining my position I called her donaFlorinda.\"Don't call me dona Florinda,\" she said with a childish gesture of annoyance andembarrassment. \"I'm not that old yet, or even that respectable.\"I asked her how she expected me to address her.\"Just Florinda will do,\" she said. \"Insofar as to who I am, I can tell you rightoff that I am a woman warrior who knows the secrets of stalking.\"And insofar as what I am supposed to do for you, I can tell you that I am goingto teach you: the first seven principles of stalking; the first three principlesof the rule for stalkers; and the first three maneuvers of stalking.\"She added that the normal thing was for every warrior to forget what transpireswhen the interaction is on the left side, and that it would take years for me tocome to grips with whatever she was going to teach me. She said that herinstruc-tion was merely the beginning, and that some day she would finishteaching me, but under different circumstances.I asked her if she minded my asking her questions. \"Do as you please,\" she said.\"All I need from you is your commitment to practice. After all, you know in oneway or another whatever we're going to discuss. Your shortcomings are that youhave no self-confidence and that you are unwilling to claim your knowledge aspower. The Nagual Juan Matus, being a man, mes-merized you. You cannot act onyour own. Only a woman can liberate you from that.\"I will begin by telling you the story of my life, and in doing so, things willbecome clear to you. I will have to tell it to you in bits, so you will have tocome here quite often.\"Her apparent willingness to tell me about her life struck me as being at oddswith the reticence [* reticence- the trait of being uncommunicative; notvolunteering anything more than necessary] of everyone else to reveal anythingpersonal about themselves. After years with them I had accepted their ways sounquestioningly that her voluntary intent to reveal her personal life wasfreakish to me. Her statement put me immediately on guard.\"I beg your pardon,\" I said. \"Did you say that you are going to reveal yourpersonal life to me?\"\"Why not?\" she asked.I answered her with a long explanation of what don Juan had told me about theencumbering force of personal history, and the need that a warrior has to eraseit. I wrapped it up by telling her that he had prohibited me from ever talkingabout my life.She laughed in a high falsetto voice. She seemed to be delighted.\"That applies only to men,\" she said. \"The not-doing of your personal life is totell endless stories, but not a single one about your real self. You see, beinga man means that you have a solid history behind you. You have family, friends,and acquaintances; and every one of them has a definite idea of you. Being a manmeans that you're accountable. You cannot disappear that easily. In order toerase yourself, you needed a lot of work.\"My case is different. I'm a woman and that gives me a splendid advantage. I'mnot accountable. Don't you know that women are not accountable?\"\"I don't know what you mean by accountable,\" I said.\"I mean that a woman can easily disappear,\" she replied. \"A woman can, ifnothing else, get married. A woman belongs to the husband. In a family with lotsof children, the daugh-ters are discarded very early. No one counts on them andchances are that some will vanish without leaving a trace. Their disappearanceis easily accepted.\"A son, on the other hand, is something one banks on. It's not that easy for ason to slip off and vanish. And even if he does, he will leave traces behindhim. A son feels guilty for disappearing. A daughter does not.\"When the Nagual trained you to keep your mouth shut about your personal life,he intended to help you to overcome your feeling of having done wrong to yourfamily and friends who were counting on you one way or another.\"After a lifetime struggle, the male warrior ends up, of course, erasinghimself, but that struggle takes its toll on the man. He becomes secretive;forever on guard against himself. A woman doesn't have to contend with thathardship. A woman is already prepared to disintegrate into thin air. In fact,it's expected of her.\"Being a woman, I'm not compelled to secrecy. I don't give a fig about it.Secrecy is the price you men have to pay for being important to society. Thatstruggle is only for the men because they resent erasing themselves, and theywould find curious ways to pop up somewhere; somehow. Take yourself forin-stance: You go around giving lectures.\" Florinda made me nervous in a very peculiar way. I felt strangely restless inher presence.I would admit without hes-itation that don Juan and Silvio Manuel also made mefeel nervous and apprehensive, but it was a different feeling. I was actuallyafraid of them, especially Silvio Manuel. He terrified me and yet I had learnedto live with my terror.Florinda did not frighten me. My nervousness was rather the result of beingannoyed; threatened by her savoir faire. [* savoir faire- social skill]She did not stare at me the way don Juan or Silvio Manuel used to. They wouldalways fix their eyes on me until I moved my face away in a gesture ofsubmission. Florinda only glanced at me. Her eyes moved continually from thingto thing. She seemed to examine not only my eyes, but every inch of my face andbody. As she talked, she would shift in quick glances from my face to my hands,or to her feet, or to the roof. \"I make you ill at ease, don't I?\" she asked.Her question caught me thoroughly off guard. I laughed. Her tone was notthreatening at all.\"You do,\" I said.\"Oh, it's perfectly understandable,\" she went on. \"You are used to being a man.A woman for you is something made for your benefit. A woman is stupid to you.And the fact that you're the Nagual and a man makes things even morediffi-cult.\"I felt obligated to defend myself. I thought that she was a very opinionatedlady and I wanted to tell her so. I started off in great form, but petered outalmost immediately upon hear-ing her laughter. It was a joyous, youthfullaughter. Don Juan and don Genaro used to laugh at me all the time and theirlaughter was also youthful, but Florinda's had a differ-ent vibration. There wasno hurry in her laughter; no pres-sure.\"I think we'd better go inside,\" she said. \"There shouldn't be any distractions.The Nagual Juan Matus has already taken you around, showing you the world. Thatwas important for what he had to tell you. I have other things to talk aboutwhich require another setting.\"We sat on a leather couch in a den off the patio. I felt more at ease indoors.She went right into the story of her life. She said that she had been born in a fairly large Mexican city to a well-to-dofamily. As she was an only child, her parents spoiled her from the moment shewas born. Without a trace of false modesty Florinda admitted that she had alwaysbeen aware of being beautiful.She said that beauty is a demon that breeds and proliferates when admired. Sheassured me that she could say without the shadow of a doubt that that demon isthe hardest one to overcome, and that if I would look around to find those whoare beautiful, I would find the most wretched beings imaginable.I did not want to argue with her, yet I had the most intense desire to tell herthat she was somehow dogmatic. [* dogmatic- characterized by assertion ofunprovable principles] She must have caught my feelings because she winked atme.\"They are wretched, you'd better believe it,\" she contin-ued. \"Try them. Beunwilling to go along with their idea that they are beautiful, and because ofit, important. You'll see what I mean.\"She said that she could hardly give her parents or herself full blame for herconceit. Everyone around her had conspired from her infancy on to make her feelimportant and unique.\"When I was fifteen,\" she went on, \"I thought I was about the greatest thingthat ever came to earth. Everybody said so, especially men.\"She confessed that throughout her adolescent years she in-dulged in theattention and adulation of scores of admirers. At eighteen, she judiciouslychose the best possible husband from the ranks of no less than eleven serioussuitors. She married Celestino, a man of means, fifteen years her senior.Florinda described her married life as heaven on earth. To the enormous circleof friends she already had, she added Celestino's friends. The total effect wasthat of a perennial [* perennial- lasting an indefinitely long time; suggestingself-renewal] holi-day.Her bliss, however, lasted only six months- which went by almost unnoticed. Itall came to a most abrupt and brutal end when she contracted a mysterious andcrippling disease.Her left foot, ankle, and calf began to swell. The line of her beautiful leg wasruined. The swelling became so intense that the cutaneous tissues started toblister and burst. Her whole lower leg from the knee down became the site ofscabs and a pesti-lent secretion. The skin became hard. The disease wasdiag-nosed as elephantiasis. Doctors' attempts to cure her condition were clumsyand painful, and their final conclusion was that only in Europe were theremedical centers advanced enough to possibly undertake a cure.In a matter of three months Florinda's paradise had turned into hell on earth.Desperate and in true agony she wanted to die rather than go on. Her sufferingwas so pathetic that one day a servant girl, not being able to bear it anylonger, confessed to her that she had been bribed by Celestino's former mistressto slip a certain concoction into her food- a poison manufactured by sorcerers.The servant girl, as an act of contrition, promised to take her to a curer; awoman reported to be the only person who could counteract such a poison.Florinda chuckled, remembering her dilemma. She had been raised a devoutCatholic. She did not believe in witch-craft or in Indian curers. But her painwas so intense and her condition so serious that she was willing to tryanything.Ce-lestino was deadly opposed. He wanted to turn the servant girl over to theauthorities. Florinda interceded, not so much out of compassion, but out of thefear that she might not find the curer on her own. Florinda suddenly stood up. She told me that I had to leave. She held my arm andwalked me to the door as if I had been her oldest and dearest friend. Sheexplained that I was ex-hausted, because to be in the left side awareness is aspecial and frail condition which has to be used sparingly. It certainly is nota state of power.The proof was that I had nearly died when Silvio Manuel had tried to rally mysecond attention by forcing me to enter boldly into it. She said that there isno way on earth that we can order anyone or ourselves to rally knowledge. It israther a slow affair. The body, at the right time and under the propercircumstances of impeccability, rallies its knowledge without the interventionof desire.We stood at the front door for a while exchanging pleasant remarks andtrivialities. She suddenly said that the reason the Nagual Juan Matus hadbrought me to her that day was be-cause he knew that his time on earth wascoming to an end. The two forms of instruction that I had received, according toSilvio Manuel's master plan, had already been completed. All that was leftpending was what she had to say to me. She stressed that hers was notinstruction proper, but rather the establishing of my link to her. The next time don Juan took me to see Florinda- just before he left me at thedoor- he repeated what she had told me; that the time was approaching for himand his party to enter into the third attention. Before I could question him, heshoved me inside the house. His shove sent me not only into the house, but intomy keenest state of awareness. I saw the wall of fog.Florinda was standing in the hall as if she had been waiting for don Juan toshove me in. She held my arm and quietly led me to the living room. We sat down.I wanted to start a conversation but I could not talk.She explained that a shove from an impeccable warrior, like the Nagual JuanMatus, can cause a shift into another area of awareness. She said that mymistake all along had been to believe that the procedures are important. Theprocedure of shoving a warrior into another state of consciousness is utilizableonly if both participants, especially the one who shoves, are impeccable andimbued with personal power.The fact that I was seeing the wall of fog made me feel utterly nervous on aphysical level. My body was shaking uncontrollably. Florinda said that my bodywas shaking be-cause it had learned to crave for activity while it remained inthat state of awareness, and that my body could also learn to focus its keenestattention on whatever was being said, rather than whatever was being done.She told me then that to be placed on the left side conscious-ness was anexpediency. By forcing me into a state of heightened awareness and allowing meto interact with his warriors only when I was in that state, the Nagual JuanMatus was making sure that I would have a ledge to stand on.Florinda said that his strategy was to cultivate a small part of the other selfby deliberately filling it with memories of interac-tion. The memories areforgotten only to resurface someday in order to serve as a rational outpost fromwhere to depart into the immeasurable vastness of the other self.Because I was so nervous, she proposed to calm me down by proceeding with thestory of her life, which, she clarified, was not really the story of her life asa woman in the world, but the story of how a crummy woman was helped to become awarrior. She said that once she made up her mind to see the curer there was no way tostop her. She started off, carried on a stretcher by the servant girl and fourmen, on the two-day trip that changed the course of her life. There were noroads. It was mountainous and sometimes the men had to carry her on their backs.They arrived at the curer's house at dusk. The place was well lit and there werelots of people in the house. Florinda said that a polite old man told her thatthe curer was away for the day treating a patient. The man seemed to be verywell informed about the curer's activities and Florinda found it easy to talk tohim.He was solicitous and he confided that he was a patient himself. He describedhis disease as an incurable condition that made him oblivious to the world. Theychatted amicably until late. The old man was so helpful that he even gaveFlorinda his bed so she could rest and wait until the next day when the curerwould return.In the morning Florinda said that she was suddenly awak-ened by a sharp pain inher leg. A woman was moving her leg, pressing it with a piece of shiny wood.\"The curer was a very pretty woman,\" Florinda went on. \"She took a look at myleg and shook her head.\"I know who has done this to you\" she said. \"He must have been hand-somely paid,or he must have surmised that you are a useless human being. Which do you thinkit was?\"Florinda laughed. She said that she thought the curer was either crazy or wasbeing rude. She had no conception that anyone in the world could possiblybelieve that she was a useless human being. Even though she was in excruciatingpain, she let the woman know, in so many words, that she was a rich and worthyperson, and nobody's fool.Florinda recalled that the curer changed her attitude on the spot. She seemed tohave gotten scared. She respectfully addressed her as \"Missy\", and got up fromher chair and ordered everyone out of the room.When they were alone the curer sat on Florinda's chest and pushed her headbackward over the edge of the bed. Florinda said that she fought her. Shethought that she was going to be killed. She tried to scream to alert herservants, but the curer quickly covered her head with a blanket and plugged hernose.Florinda gasped for air and had to breathe through her open mouth. The more thecurer pressed on Florinda's chest and the tighter she plugged her nose, thewider Florinda opened her mouth.When she realized what the curer was really doing, she had already drunk thefoul liquid contents of a large bottle which the curer had put into her openmouth. Florinda commented that the curer had maneuvered her so well that she didnot even choke in spite of the fact that her head was dangling over the side ofthe bed.\"I drank so much liquid that I was about to get sick,\" Flo-rinda said. \"She mademe sit up and looked right into my eyes without blinking. I wanted to put myfinger down my throat and vomit. She slapped me until my lips bled. An Indianslapping me! Drawing blood from my lips! Neither my father nor my mother hadever laid a hand on me. My surprise was so great that I forgot the discomfort inmy stom-ach.\"The curer called my men and told them to take me home. Then she leaned over andput her mouth to my ear so no one would hear. 'If you don't come back in ninedays, you asshole,' she whispered, 'you'll swell up like a toad and wish to Godyou were dead.'Florinda said that the liquid had irritated her throat and vocal cords. Shecould not utter a word. This, however, was the least of her worries. When shearrived at her home Celestino was waiting in a state of frenzy.Being incapable of speak-ing, Florinda was in the position to observe him. Shenoticed that his anger had nothing to do with worrying about her health, butwith concern about his standing as a man of wealth and social status. He couldnot bear to be seen by his influ-ential friends as resorting to Indian curers.He was raging, shouting that he was going to take his complaint to the armyheadquarters, have the soldiers capture the woman curer and bring her to town tobe thrashed and thrown in jail. These were not just empty threats: He actuallypressed a military commander to send a patrol after the curer. The soldiers cameback a few days later with the news that the woman had fled.Florinda was put at ease by her maid who assured her that the curer would bewaiting for her if she cared to go back. Although the inflammation of her throatpersisted to the point that she could not eat solid food and could barelyswallow liquids, Florinda could hardly wait for the day when she was supposed togo back to see the curer. The medicine had eased the pain in her leg.When she let Celestino know her intentions, he became furious enough to round upsome help in order to put an end to the nonsense himself. He and three of histrusted men went on horseback ahead of her.Florinda said that when she arrived at the curer's house, she expected to findher perhaps dead, but instead she found Ce-lestino sitting alone. He had senthis men to three different places in the vicinity with orders to bring back thecurer, by force if necessary. Florinda saw the same old man she had met the timebefore. He was trying to calm her husband down, assuring him that any one of hismen would be back shortly with the woman.As soon as Florinda was placed on a cot in the front porch, the curer steppedout of the house. She began to insult Celestino, calling him names, yellingobscenities at him until she got him so angry that he rushed to strike her.The old man held him back and begged him not to hit her. He implored on hisknees, pointing out that she was an old woman. Celestino was unmoved. He saidthat he was going to horsewhip her regardless of her age.He advanced to grab her but was stopped cold. Six awesome-looking men came outfrom behind the bushes wielding their machetes. Florinda said that fear frozeCelestino to the spot. He was ashen.The curer came to him and told him that either he would meekly let her whip himon the buttocks or her helpers would hack him to pieces. As proud a man as hewas, he bent over meekly to be whipped. The curer had reduced him in a fewmoments to a helpless man. She laughed in his face. She knew that he was pinneddown and she let him sink. He had walked into her trap, like the careless foolthat he was, drunk with his own inflated ideas about his worth. Florinda looked at me and smiled. She was quiet for a while.\"The first principle of the art of stalking is that warriors choose theirbattleground,\" she said. \"A warrior never goes into battle without knowing whatthe surroundings are. The woman curer had shown me, through her battle withCeles-tino, the first principle of stalking. \"Then the curer came over to where I was lying down. I was crying. That was theonly thing I could do. She seemed con-cerned. She tucked my blanket around myshoulders and smiled and winked at me.\"The deal is still on, asshole,\" she said. \"Come back as soon as you can if youwant to live. But don't bring your master with you, you little whore. Come onlywith those who are absolutely necessary.\" Florinda fixed her eyes on me for a moment. From her silence I surmised that shewanted my comments.\"To discard everything that is unnecessary is the second principle of the art ofstalking,\" she said without giving me time to say anything.Her account had absorbed me so intensely that I had not noticed that the wall offog had disappeared- nor when. I simply realized that it was not there anymore.Florinda got up from her chair and led me to the door. We stood there forawhile, as we had done at the end of our first meeting.Florinda said that Celestino's anger had also permitted the curer to point out,not to her reason, but to her body, the first three precepts of the rule forstalkers.Although her mind was focused entirely on herself, since nothing else existedfor her outside her physical pain and the anguish of losing her beauty, stillher body had acknowledged what had happened, and needed later on only a reminderin order to put everything in place.\"Warriors don't have the world to cushion them, so they must have the rule,\" shewent on. \"Yet the rule of stalkers applies to everyone.\"Celestino's arrogance was his undoing and the beginning of my instruction andliberation. His self-importance, which was also mine, forced us both to believethat we were above practically everybody. The curer brought us down to what wereally are; nothing.\"The first precept of the rule is that everything that sur-rounds us is anunfathomable mystery.\"The second precept of the rule is that we must try to unravel these mysteries,but without ever hoping to accom-plish this.\"The third, that a warrior, aware of the unfathomable mys-tery that surroundshim and aware of his duty to try to un-ravel it, takes his rightful place amongmysteries and regards himself as one. Consequently, for a warrior there is noend to the mystery of being, whether being means being a pebble, or an ant, oroneself. That is a warrior's humbleness. One is equal to everything.\"There was a long and forced silence. Florinda smiled, play-ing with the tip ofher long braid. She said that I had had enough. The third time I went to see Florinda, don Juan did not leave me at the door butwalked in with me. All the members of his party were congregated in the house,and they greeted me as if I were returning home from a long trip. It was anexquisite event. It integrated Florinda with the rest of them in my feelingssince that was the first time she had joined them while I was present. The next time I went to Florinda's house, don Juan unex-pectedly shoved me as hehad done before. My shock was immense. Florinda was waiting for me in the hall.I had en-tered instantly into the state where the wall of fog is visible.\"I've told you how the principles of the art of stalking were shown to me,\" shesaid as soon as we sat down on the couch in her living room. \"Now, you must dothe same for me. How did the Nagual Juan Matus show them to you?\"I told her that I could not remember offhand. I had to think about it, and Icould not think. My body was frightened.\"Don't complicate things,\" she said in a tone of command. \"Aim at being simple.Apply all the concentration you have to decide whether or not to enter intobattle, for any battle is a battle for one's life. This is the third principleof the art of stalking, A warrior must be willing and ready to make his laststand here and now. But not in a helter-skelter way.\"I simply could not organize my thoughts. I stretched my legs and lay down on thecouch. I took deep breaths to relax my midsection, which seemed to be tied inknots.\"Good,\" Florinda said. \"I see that you're applying the fourth principle of theart of stalking. Relax, abandon yourself, fear nothing. Only then will thepowers that guide us open the road and aid us. Only then.\"I struggled to remember how don Juan had shown me the principles of the art ofstalking. For some inexplicable reason my mind refused to focus on my pastexperience. Don Juan was so vague a memory. I stood up and began to look around.The room we were in was exquisitely arranged. The floor was made of largebuff-colored tiles. Excellent craftsmanship had been involved in laying it. Iwas about to examine the furniture. I moved toward a beautiful dark-brown table.Flo-rinda jumped to my side and shook me vigorously.\"You've correctly applied the fifth principle of the art of stalking\" she said.\"Don't let yourself wander away.\"\"What is the fifth principle?\" I asked.\"When faced with odds that cannot be dealt with, warriors retreat for a moment,\"she said. \"They let their minds mean-der. They occupy their time with somethingelse. Anything would do.\"You've done just that. But now that you've accomplished it, you must apply thesixth principle: Warriors compress time; even an instant counts. In a battle foryour life, a second is an eternity; an eternity that may decide the outcome.War-riors aim at succeeding, therefore they compress time. War-riors don't wastean instant.\"All of a sudden a bulk of memories erupted into my aware-ness. I excitedly toldFlorinda that I could certainly remember the first time don Juan had acquaintedme with those princi-ples. Florinda put her fingers to her lips in a gesturethat demanded my silence. She said that she had only been inter-ested inbringing me face to face with the principles, but she did not want me to relatethose experiences to her. Florinda went on with her story. She said that as the curer was telling her tocome back without Celestino, the curer had her drink a concoction thatalleviated her pain almost instantly, and the curer also whispered in her earthat Florinda had to make a momentous decision by herself; and that Florindashould put her mind at ease by doing something else, but that she should notwaste a moment once she had reached her decision.At home she stated her desire to go back. Celestino did not see any point inobjecting because her conviction was unshak-able.\"Almost immediately I went back to see the curer,\" Flo-rinda continued. \"Thistime we went on horseback. I took my two most trusted servants with me: the girlwho had given me the poison, and a man to handle the horses. The horses werevery nervous because of the stench of my leg, and we had a rough time going overthose mountains; but we somehow made it. Without knowing it, I had used the third principle of the art of stalking. I hadput my life, or what was left of it, on the line. I was willing and ready todie. It wasn't such a great decision for me, I was dying anyway. It is a factthat when one is half dead, as in my case, not with great pain but with greatdis-comfort, the tendency is to get so lazy and weak that no effort is possible. \"I stayed at the curer's house for six days. By the second day I felt betteralready. The swelling went down. The oozing from the leg had stopped. There wasno more pain. I was just a little weak and wobbly in the knees when I tried towalk.\"During the sixth day the curer took me to her room. She was very careful withme and, showing me every considera-tion. She made me sit on her bed, and gave mecoffee.\"The curer then sat on the floor at my feet, facing me. I can remember her exactwords. 'You are very, very sick and only I can cure you,' she said. 'If I don't,you'll die a death that is not to be believed. Since you're an imbecile, you'lllast to the bitter end. On the other hand, I could cure you in one day but Iwon't. You will have to keep coming here until you have understood what I haveto show you. Only then will I cure you completely- otherwise, being the imbecileyou are, you will never come back.'\"Florinda said that the curer, with great patience, explained to her the verydelicate points of her decision to help her. Florinda did not understand a wordof it. The explanation made her believe more than ever that the curer was a bittouched in the head.When the curer realized that she was not getting through to Florinda, the curerbecame more stern, and made Florinda repeat over and over, as if Florinda were achild, that without the curer's help her life was finished, and that the curercould choose to cancel the cure and leave her hopelessly to die.Finally, the curer lost her patience when Florinda begged her to finish healingher, and send her home to her family. The curer picked up a bottle containingthe medicine, and smashed it on the ground, and told Florinda that she wasthrough with her.Florinda told me, \"I cried then the only real tears of my life.\"Florinda told the curer that all she wanted was to be cured and that she wasmore than willing to pay for it. The curer said it was too late for monetarypayment; that what she wanted from Florinda was her attention, not her money.Florinda admitted to me that she had learned during the course of her life howto get anything she wanted. She knew how to be obstinate, and she raised thepoint that there must have been thousands of patients that had come to thecurer- half dead just like herself- and that the curer took their money; so whywas her case different?The curer's reply, which was no explanation at all for Florinda, was that beinga seer she had seen Florinda's luminous body, and Florinda and the curer wereexactly alike.Florinda thought that the woman had to be mad not to realize that there was aworld of difference between them. The curer was a rude Indian, uneducated andprimi-tive, while Florinda was rich and beautiful and white.Florinda asked the woman what she was planning to do to her. The curer told herthat she had been commissioned to heal her, and then teach her something ofgreat importance. Florinda wanted to know who had commissioned her. The womanreplied that it was the Eagle- a reply which con-vinced Florinda that the womanwas absolutely crazy.And yet Florinda saw no alternative to complying with the woman's demands. Shetold her that she was willing to do anything.The woman changed her belligerent attitude instantly. She gave Florinda somemedicine to take home, and told her to come back as soon as she could. \"As you yourself know,\" Florinda went on, \"a teacher must trick the disciple.She tricked me with my cure. She was right. I was such an idiot that if she hadcured me right away, I would've gone back to my stupid life as if nothing hadever happened to me. Don't we all do that?\" Florinda returned the following week. Upon arriving she was greeted by the oldman she had met before. He talked to her as if they were the best of friends.He said that the curer had been away for several days and would not be back forseveral more; and that she had entrusted him with some med-icine for her in caseshe showed up.He told Florinda in a very friendly but commanding tone that the curer's absencehad left Florinda with only two alternatives: she could either go back home,possibly in worse physical shape than before due to the strenuous trip; or shecould follow the curer's carefully out-lined instructions.He added that if she decided to stay and start her treatment right away, inthree to four months she would be as good as new. There was, however, onestipula-tion: if she decided to stay, she had to remain in the curer's house foreight consecutive days and had, perforce, to send her servants home.Florinda said that there was nothing to decide; that she had to stay. The oldman immediately gave her the potion that the curer had apparently left for her.He sat up with her most of the night. He was reassuring, and his easy talkkindled Florinda's optimism and confidence.Her two servants left the next morning after breakfast. Flo-rinda was not at allafraid. She trusted the old man implicitly. He told her that he had to build abox for her treatment in accordance with the curer's instructions. He made hersit on a low chair which had been placed in the center of a circular area withno vegetation on it. While she was seated there, the old man introduced her tothree young men he said were his assistants. Two were Indians and one was white.It took the four of them less than an hour to construct a crate around the chairwhere Florinda was sitting. When they were finished, Florinda was encased snuglyinside a crate which had a lattice top to allow for ventilation. One of itssides was hinged in order to serve as a door.The old man opened the door and helped Florinda to step out of it. He took herto the house, and asked her to help him prepare her medicine in order to have ithandy for the time when the curer would return.Florinda was fascinated with the way he worked. He made a potion out of plantswith a pungent odor, and prepared a bucket of a hot liquid. He suggested thatfor her comfort she should immerse her leg in the bucket, and if she felt likeit, she should drink the concoction he had prepared before it lost its potency.Florinda obeyed him unquestioningly. The relief she felt was remarkable.The old man then assigned her a room to herself, and had the young men put thecrate inside the room. He told her that it might be days before the curer wouldshow up. In the meantime she had to follow meticulously all the instructionsleft for her.She agreed with him, and he produced a list of tasks. They included a great dealof walking in order to collect the medicinal plants needed for her potions, andher assistance in their actual preparation.Florinda said that she spent twelve days there instead of eight because herservants were late due to torrential rains. It was not until the tenth day thatshe discovered that the woman had never left, and that the old man was actuallythe real curer. Florinda laughed, describing her shock. The old man had tricked her intoactively participating in her own cure. Fur-thermore, under the pretext that thecurer demanded it, he put her inside the crate daily for at least six hours, inorder to fulfill a specific task he had called the 'recapitulation'.At that point in her account, Florinda scrutinized me and concluded that I hadhad enough, and that it was time for me to leave. On our next meeting, she explained that the old man was her benefactor, and thatshe was the first stalker that the women of her benefactor's party had found forthe Nagual Juan Matus; but none of that was known to her then.Even though her benefactor made her shift levels of awareness and revealed thisto her, it was to no avail. She had been raised to be beautiful, and that hadcreated a shield around her so im-penetrable that she was impervious to change.Her benefactor concluded that she needed time. He devised a plan to drawCelestino to Florinda's battleground. He made her see things about Celestino'spersonality that she herself knew to be true, but had not had the courage toface on her own. Celestino was very possessive of everything he owned; his wealth and Florindaranked high among his possessions. He had been forced to swallow his pride overhis humiliation at the hands of the curer because the curer was cheap, andFlorinda was actually recuperating. He was biding his time; waiting for a momentwhen the cure would be complete in order to seek revenge.Florinda said that her benefactor told her that the danger was that her completerecovery was going to be too quick and Celestino would decide, since he made allthe decisions in the house, that there was no longer any need for Florinda tosee the curer.Her benefactor then gave her a potion to apply on her other leg. The unguent wasterribly pungent, and pro-duced an irritation on the skin that resembled thespreading of the disease. Her benefactor advised her to use the unguent everytime she wanted to come back to see him even though she did not need atreatment.Florinda said that it took a year to be cured. In the course of that time, herbenefactor acquainted her with the rule and drilled her like a soldier in theart of stalking. He made her apply the principles of stalking to the things shedid daily; small things at first, leading up to the major issues of her life.In the course of that year, her benefactor also introduced her to the NagualJuan Matus, whom she described as very witty and thoughtful, but still the mostunruly and terrifying young man she had ever met. She said that it was theNagual Juan Matus who helped her escape from Celestino.He and Silvio Manuel smuggled her out of the city through police and armyroadblocks. Celestino had filed a legal complaint for desertion, and being aninfluential man, he had used his re-sources to try to stop her from leaving him.Because of this her benefactor had to move to another part of Mexico, and shehad to remain in hiding in his house for years. This situation suited Florindaas she had to fulfill the task of recapitulating, and for that she neededabsolute quiet and solitude. She explained that a recapitulation is the forte of stalkers just as thedreaming body is the forte of dreamers. The recapitulation consisted ofrecol-lecting one's life down to the most insignificant detail.Thus her benefactor had given her that crate as a tool and a symbol. It was atool that would permit her to learn concentration, because she would have to sitin there for years until all of her life had passed in front of her eyes.And it was a symbol of the narrow boundaries of our person. Her benefactor toldher that when-ever she had finished her recapitulation, she would break thecrate to symbolize that she no longer abided by the limitations of her person.She said that stalkers use crates or earth coffins in order to seal themselvesin while they are reliving, more than merely recollecting, every moment of theirlives.The reason why stalkers must recapitulate their lives in such a thorough manneris that the Eagle's gift to man includes its willingness to accept a surrogateinstead of genuine awareness- if such a surrogate be a perfect replica. Florindaexplained that since awareness is the Eagle's food, the Eagle can be satisfiedwith a perfect recapitulation in place of consciousness. Florinda gave me then the fundamentals of recapitulating. She said that thefirst stage is a brief recounting of all the incidents in our lives that in anobvious manner stand out for examination.The second stage is a more detailed recollection, which starts systematically ata point that could be the moment prior to the stalker sitting in the crate, andtheoretically could extend to the moment of birth.She assured me that a perfect recapitulation could change a warrior as much, ifnot more, than the total control of the dreaming body.In this respect, dreaming and stalking led to the same end, the entering intothe third attention. It was impor-tant for a warrior, however, to know andpractice both. She said that for women it took different configurations in theluminous body to master one or the other. Men, on the other hand, could do bothwith a degree of ease, yet they could never get to the level of proficiency thatthe women attained in each art.Florinda explained that the key element in recapitulating was breathing. Breathfor her was magical, because it was a life-giving function.She said that recollecting was easy if one could reduce the area of stimulationaround the body. This was the reason for the crate.Then breathing would foster deeper and deeper memories. Theoretically, stalkershave to remember every feeling that they have had in their lives, and thisprocess begins with a breath. She warned me that the things she was teaching mewere only preliminaries; that at a later time in a different setting she wouldteach me the intri-cacies.Florinda said that her benefactor directed her to write down a list of theevents to be relived.He told her that the procedure starts with an initial breath. Stalkers beginwith their chin on the right shoulder and slowly inhale as they move their headover a hundred and eighty degree arc. The breath terminates on the leftshoulder. Once the inhalation ends, the head goes back to a relaxed position.They exhale looking straight ahead.The stalker then takes the event at the top of the list and remains with ituntil all the feelings expended in it have been recounted. As stalkers rememberthe feelings they invested in whatever it is that they are remembering, theyinhale slowly, moving their heads from the right shoulder to the left. Thefunction of this breathing is to restore energy.Florinda claimed that the luminous body is constantly creating cob-web likefilaments which are projected out of the luminous mass; propelled by emotions ofany sort. Therefore, every situation of interaction, or every situation wherefeelings are involved, is potentially draining to the luminous body.By breathing from right to left while remembering a feeling, stalk-ers, throughthe magic of breathing, pick up the filaments they left behind. The nextimmediate breath is from left to right and it is an exhalation. With it stalkerseject filaments left in them by other luminous bodies involved in the eventbeing recollected.She stated that these were the mandatory preliminaries of stalking, which allthe members of her party went through as an introduction to the more demandingexercises of the art. Unless stalkers have gone through the preliminaries inorder to retrieve the filaments they have left in the world, and par-ticularlyin order to reject those that others have left in them, there is no possibilityof handling controlled folly, because those foreign filaments are the basis ofone's limitless capacity for self-importance.In order to practice controlled folly, since it is not a way to fool or chastisepeople or feel superior to them, one has to be capable of laughing at oneself.Florinda said that one of the results of a detailed recapitulation is genuinelaugh-ter upon coming face to face with the boring repetition of one'sself-esteem, which is at the core of all human interaction.Florinda emphasized that the rule defined stalking and dreaming as arts;therefore they are something that one performs. She said that the life-givingnature of breath is what also gives it its cleansing capacity. It is thiscapacity that makes a recapitulation into a practical matter. In our next meeting Florinda summed up what she called her last-minuteinstructions. She asserted that since the joint assessment of the Nagual JuanMatus and his party of warriors had been that I did not need to deal with theworld of every-day life, they taught me dreaming instead of stalking.She explained that this assessment had been radically modified, and that theyhad found themselves in an awkward position. They did not have any more time toteach me stalking.She had to stay behind on the periphery of the third attention in order tofulfill her assignment at a later time when I would be ready. On the other hand,if I were to leave the world with them, she was exonerated from thatresponsibility.Florinda said that her benefactor considered the three basic techniques ofstalking- the crate, the list of events to be reca-pitulated, and the stalker'sbreath-to be about the most im-portant tasks a warrior can fulfill.Her benefactor thought that a profound recapitulation is the most expedientmeans to lose the human form. Thus it is easier for stalkers, afterrecapitulat-ing their lives, to make use of all the not-doings of the self, suchas erasing personal history, losing self-importance, breaking routines and soforth.Florinda said that her benefactor gave all of them an ex-ample of what he meant.First he acted out his premises, and then he gave them the warrior's rationalesfor his actions.In her own case, he, being a master of the art of stalking, acted out the ployof her disease and cure which not only was con-gruous with the warrior's way,but was a masterful introduc-tion to the seven basic principles of the art ofstalking.He first drew Florinda to his own battleground where she was at his mercy; heforced her to discard what was not essential; he taught her to put her life onthe line with a decision; he taught her how to relax; he showed her how toregroup her resources using a new mood of optimism and self-confidence; hetaught her to compress time; and fi-nally he showed her that a stalker neverpushes himself to the front.Florinda was most impressed by the last principle. To her it summarizedeverything she wanted to tell me in her last-minute instructions.\"My benefactor was the chief,\" Florinda said. \"And yet, looking at him, no onewould've ever believed it. He always had one of his female warriors as a frontwhile he freely mingled with the patients pretending to be one of them; or heposed as an old fool who was constantly sweeping dry leaves with a handmadebroom.\"Florinda explained that in order to apply the seventh prin-ciple of the art ofstalking, one has to apply the other six. Thus her benefactor was always lookingon from behind the scenes. Thanks to that he was capable of avoiding or parryingcon-flicts. If there was strife, it was never directed toward him, but towardshis front, the female warrior.\"I hope that you have realized by now,\" she went on, \"that only a master stalkercan be a master of controlled folly. Con-trolled folly doesn't mean to conpeople. It means, as my bene-factor explained it, that warriors apply the sevenbasic principles of the art of stalking to whatever they do, from the mosttrivial acts to life and death situations.\"Applying these principles brings about three results. The first is thatstalkers learn never to take themselves seriously. They learn to laugh atthemselves. If they're not afraid of being a fool, they can fool anyone. Thesecond is that stalkers learn to have endless patience. Stalkers are never in ahurry. They never fret. And the third is that stalkers learn to have an end-lesscapacity to improvise.\"Florinda stood up. We had been sitting, as usual, in her living room. Iimmediately assumed that our conversation was over. She said that there was onemore topic to present to me before we said goodbye.She took me to another patio inside her house. I had never been in that part ofher house before. She called someone softly and a woman stepped out from a room.I did not recognize her at first.The woman called my name and then I realized that she was dona Soledad. Herchange was stupendous. She was younger and more powerful. Florinda said thatSoledad had been inside a recapitulating crate for five years; that the Eaglehad accepted her recapitu-lation in place of her awareness and had let her gofree.Dona Soledad assented with a movement of her head. Florinda abruptly ended themeeting, and told me that it was time for me to leave because I had no moreenergy. I went to Florinda's house many more times afterward. I saw her every time butonly for a few moments. She told me that she had decided not to instruct meanymore because it was to my advantage that I deal only with dona Soledad.Dona Soledad and I met several times, but whatever took place during ourmeetings is something quite incomprehensi-ble to me. Every time we were togethershe would make me sit at the door of her room facing the east. She would sit tomy right, touching me. Then we would make the wall of fog stop rotating and bothof us would be left facing the south, into her room.I had already learned with la Gorda to stop the rotation of the wall. It seemedthat dona Soledad was helping me to realize another aspect of that perceptualcapacity.I had correctly detected with la Gorda that only a portion of us stopped thewall. It was as if suddenly I had become divided in two. A portion of my totalself was looking straight ahead and saw an immobile wall to my right whileanother larger portion of my total self had turned ninety degrees to the rightand was star-ing at the wall.Every time dona Soledad and I stopped the wall we re-mained staring at it. Wenever entered into the area between the parallel lines as the Nagual woman, laGorda and I had done scores of times.Dona Soledad would make me gaze every time into the fog as if the fog were areflective glass. I would experience then the most extravagant disassociation.It was as if I were racing at breakneck speed. I would see bits of a landscapeforming in the fog, and suddenly I was in another physical reality.It was a mountainous area, rugged and inhospitable. Dona Soledad was alwaysthere in the company of another lovely woman who laughed uproariously at me.My incapacity to remember what we did beyond that point was even more acute thanmy incapacity to remember what the Nagual woman and la Gorda and I did in thearea between the parallel lines. It seemed that dona Soledad and I entered intoanother area of awareness that was unknown to me.I was already in what I thought was my keenest state of conscious-ness, and yetthere was something even keener. The aspect of the second attention that donaSoledad was obviously showing me was more complex and more inaccessible thananything I had witnessed so far.All I could recollect was a sense of having moved a great deal; a physicalsensation comparable to having walked for miles, or to having hiked on ruggedmoun-tain trails. I also had a clear bodily certainty, although I could notfathom why, that dona Soledad, the woman, and I ex-changed words, thoughts,feelings; but I could not pinpoint them.After every meeting with dona Soledad, Florinda would immediately make me leave.Dona Soledad gave minimal ver-bal feedback. It appeared to me that being in astate of such heightened awareness affected her so profoundly she could hardlytalk. There was something that we were seeing in that rugged landscape besidesthe lovely woman, or something we were doing together that left us breathless.She could not remember anything, although she tried.I asked Florinda to clarify the nature of my journeys with dona Soledad. Shesaid that a part of her last-minute instruc-tion was to make me enter into thesecond attention as stalkers do, and that dona Soledad was more capable than sheherself was to usher me into the stalker's dimension.On the meeting that was to be our last, Florinda, as she had done at thebeginning of our instruction, was waiting for me in the hall. She took my armand led me to the living room. We sat down.She warned me not to try as yet to make sense of my journeys with dona Soledad.She explained that stalkers are inherently different than dreamers in the waythey use the world around them, and that what dona Soledad was doing was tryingto help me to turn my head.When don Juan had described the concept of turning a warrior's head to face anew direction, I had understood it as a metaphor that depicted a change inattitude. Florinda said that that description was true, but it was no metaphor.It was true that stalkers turn their heads; however, they do not turn them toface a new direction, but to face time in a different way. Stalkers face theoncoming time. Normally we face time as it recedes from us. Only stalkers canchange that and face time as it advances on them.Florinda explained that turning the head did not mean that one sees into thefuture, but that one sees time as something concrete, yet incomprehensible.It was superfluous, therefore, for me to try to think out whatever dona Soledadand I were doing. All of it would make sense when I could perceive the totalityof myself and would then have the energy necessary to unravel that mystery.Florinda told me, in the spirit of someone giving a bonus, that dona Soledad wasa supreme stalker. Florinda called her the greatest of them all. She said thatdona Soledad could cross the parallel lines anytime.Furthermore, none of the warriors of don Juan Matus' party had been able to dowhat she had done. Dona Soledad, through her impeccable stalking tech-niques,had found her parallel being.Florinda explained that whatever I had experienced with the Nagual Juan Matus,or Silvio Manuel, or Genaro, or Zuleica were only minute portions of the secondattention. Whatever dona Soledad was helping me witness was still anotherminute, but different portion.Dona Soledad had not only made me face the oncoming time, but she had taken meto her parallel being. Florinda defined the parallel being as the counterbalancethat all living creatures have by the fact that they are luminous beings filledwith inexplicable energy.A parallel being of any person is another person of the same sex who isintimately and inextric-ably joined to the first one. They coexist in the worldat the same time. The two parallel beings are like the two ends of the samepole.It is nearly impossible for warriors to find their parallel being, because thereare too many distracting factors in the life of a warrior; other priorities. Butwhoever is capable of accomplishing this feat would find in his parallel being,just as dona Soledad had, an endless source of youth and energy.Florinda stood up abruptly and took me to dona Soledad's room. Perhaps because Iknew that it was going to be our last meeting, I was taken by a strange anxiety.Dona Soledad smiled at me when I told her what Florinda had just told me. Shesaid, with what I thought to be a true warrior's humble-ness, that she was notteaching me anything; that all she had aspired to do was to show me her parallelbeing because that would be where she would retreat when the Nagual Juan Matusand his warriors left the world.However, something else had happened which was beyond her understanding.Florinda had explained to her that we had boosted each other's energy; and thathad made us face the oncoming time, not in small doses as Florinda would haveliked us to, but in incom-prehensible gobbles as my unruly nature wanted it.The result of our last meeting was even more baffling. Dona Soledad, herparallel being and I remained for what I felt was an extraordinarily long timetogether. I saw every feature of the parallel being's face. I felt she wastrying to tell me who she was. She also seemed to be cognizant that this was ourlast meeting. There was such an overpowering sense of frailty in her eyes. Thena windlike force blew us away into something that held no meaning for me.Florinda suddenly helped me to stand up. She took me by the arm and led me tothe door. Dona Soledad walked with us. Florinda said that I would have a hardtime remembering all that had transpired because I was indulging in myrational-ity; a condition that could only worsen because they were about toleave and I would have no one to help me to shift levels of awareness. She addedthat someday dona Soledad and I would meet again in the world of everyday life.It was then that I turned to dona Soledad and begged her to drive me out of myindulging; I told her that if she failed she should kill me. I did not want tolive in the meagerness of my rationality.\"It's wrong to say that,\" Florinda said. \"We're warriors, and warriors have onlyone thing in mind- their freedom. To die and be eaten by the Eagle is nochallenge. On the other hand, to sneak around the Eagle and be free is theultimate audacity.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"15. The Plumed Serpent Having accomplished every one of the goals which the rule specified, don Juanand his party of warriors were ready for their final task; to leave the world ofeveryday life. And all that was left for la Gorda, for the other apprentices,and for me was to witness it.There was only one unresolved problem: What to do with the apprentices? Don Juansaid that properly they should leave with him by becoming incorporated into hisown group. However, they were not ready. The reactions they had while attemptingto cross the bridge had demonstrated to him what their weaknesses were.Don Juan expressed the feeling that his benefactor's choice to wait years beforegathering a warrior's party for him had been a wise choice and had producedpositive results; while his own decision to set me up quickly with the Nagualwoman and my own group had nearly been fatal to us.I understood that he was voicing this not as an expression of regret, but ratheras an affirmation of the warrior's freedom to choose, and accept his choice.He said, furthermore, that he had seriously considered following hisbenefactor's example, and that if he had done so, he would have found out soonenough that I was not a Nagual like him and no one else besides me would havebeen engaged beyond that point.As it was, Lydia, Rosa, Benigno, Nestor and Pablito were seriously handicapped;la Gorda and Josefina needed time to perfect themselves; only Soledad and Eligiowere safe because they were perhaps even more proficient than the warriors inhis own group. Don Juan added that it was up to the nine of them to take theirunfavorable or favorable circumstances, and without regret or despair, orpatting themselves on the back, turn their curse or blessing into a livingchallenge.Don Juan pointed out that not everything about us had been a failure. The smallpart that we had played amidst his warriors had been a complete triumph in asmuch as the rule fit every one of my party except me. I fully agreed with him.To begin with, the Nagual woman was everything the rule had prescribed. She hadpoise; control. She was a being at war and yet thoroughly at ease. Without anyovert preparation, she handled and led all of don Juan's gifted warriors eventhough they were more than twice her age.These men and women asserted that she was a carbon copy of the other Nagualwoman they had known. She reflected perfectly each one of the female warriors.Consequently she could also reflect the five women don Juan had found for myparty, for they were the replicas of the older ones. Lydia was like Hermelinda,Josefina was like Zuleica, Rosa and la Gorda were like Nelida, and Soledad waslike Delia.The men were also replicas of don Juan's warriors. Nestor was a copy of Vicente,Pablito of Genaro, Benigno of Silvio Manuel, and Eligio was like Juan Tuma. Therule was indeed the voice of an overpowering force that had molded these peopleinto a homogeneous whole. It was only by a strange twist of fate that they hadbeen left stranded without the leader that would find for them the passagewayinto the other awareness.Don Juan said that all the members of my party had to enter into that otherawareness by themselves, and that he did not know what their chances werebecause that was up to each one of them individually. He had helped everyoneimpeccably; thus his spirit was free from worry and concern and his mind wasfree from idle speculations. All that was left for him to do was to show uspragmatically what it meant to cross over the parallel lines in one's totality.Don Juan told me that at best I could only help one of the apprentices, and thathe had picked la Gorda because of her prowess and because I was already familiarwith her. He said that I had no more energy for the others due to the fact thatI had other duties to perform; other paths of action which were congruous withmy true task.Don Juan explained to me that every one of his own warriors knew what that taskwas but had not revealed it to me because I needed to prove that I was worthy ofit. The fact that they were at the end of their trail, and the fact that I hadfaithfully followed my instructions made it imperative that this revelation takeplace, although only in a partial form. When the actual time came for don Juan to leave, he let me know that his time onEarth was up while I was in a state of normal awareness. Yet I missed the fullsignificance of what he was saying.Don Juan tried to the very end to induce me to join my two states of awareness.Everything would have been so simple if I had been capable of that merger. SinceI was not, and was only rationally touched by his revelation, he forced me toshift levels of awareness in order to allow me to assess the event in moreencompassing terms.He warned me repeatedly that to be in the left side awareness is an advantageonly in the sense that our grasp of things is accelerated. It is a disadvantagebecause it allows us to focus with inconceivable lucidity only on one thing at atime. This renders us dependent and vulnerable. We cannot be on our own whilebeing in the left side awareness, and have to be cushioned by warriors who havegained the totality of themselves and who know how to handle themselves in thatstate. La Gorda said that one day the Nagual Juan Matus and Genaro rounded up all theapprentices at her house. The Nagual made them shift into the left sideawareness, and told them that his time on earth had come to an end.She did not believe him at first. She thought that he was trying to startle theminto acting like warriors. But then she realized that there was a glow in hiseyes that she had never seen before.Having made them shift levels of awareness, he talked with every one of themindividually, and made them go through a summation so as to refreshen all theconcepts and procedures he had acquainted them with.Don Juan did the same with me. My appointment took place the day before I sawhim for the last time. In my case he conducted that summation in both states ofawareness. In fact, he made me shift back and forth various times as if makingsure that I would be completely saturated in both.I had been unable to recollect at first what had taken place after thissummation. One day la Gorda finally succeeded in breaking the barriers of mymemory. She told me that she was inside my mind as if she were reading me.Her assessment was that what kept my memory locked up was that I was afraid toremember my pain. What had happened at Silvio Manuel's house the night beforethey left was inextricably enmeshed with my fear. She said that she had theclearest sensation that I was afraid, but she did not know the reason why. Norcould she remember what exactly had taken place in that house specifically inthe room where we sat down.As la Gorda spoke, I felt as if I were plummeting into an abyss. I realized thatsomething in me was trying to make a connection between two separate events thatI had witnessed in my two states of awareness.On my left side I had the locked-up memories of don Juan and his party ofwarriors on their last day on earth. On my right side I had the memory of havingjumped that day into an abyss. In trying to join my two sides, I experienced atotal sense of physical descent. My knees gave way and I fell to the floor.When I described my experience and my interpretation of it, la Gorda said thatwhat was coming to my right side awareness was doubtlessly the memory that hadsurfaced in her as I talked. She had just remembered that we had made one moreattempt to cross the parallel lines with the Nagual Juan Matus and his party.She said that the two of us, together with the rest of the apprentices, hadtried once more to cross the bridge.I could not bring that memory into focus. There seemed to be a constrictingforce that prevented me from organizing my thoughts and feelings about it. LaGorda said that Silvio Manuel had told the Nagual Juan Matus to prepare me andall the apprentices for their crossing.Silvio Manuel did not want to leave me in the world because he thought that Idid not stand a chance of fulfilling my task. The Nagual Juan Matus disagreedwith him but carried out the preparations regardless of how he felt.La Gorda told me that she remembered I had driven to her house to take her aswell as the other apprentices to Silvio Manuel's house. They remained therewhile I went back to the Nagual Juan Matus and Genaro in order to prepare forthe crossing.I did not remember it at all. She insisted that I should use her as a guidesince we were so intimately joined. She assured me that I could read her mindand find something there that would awaken my full recollection.My mind was in a state of great turmoil. A feeling of anxiety prevented me fromeven focusing on what la Gorda was saying. She kept on talking, describing whatshe remembered of our second attempt to cross that bridge.She said that Silvio Manuel had harangued them. He told them that they had hadsufficient training to try once again to cross. What they needed to enter fullyinto the other self was to abandon the intent of their first attention. Oncethey were in the awareness of the other self the power of the Nagual Juan Matusand his party would pick them up and lift them off into the third attention withgreat facility- something they could not do if the apprentices were in theirnormal awareness.At one instant, I was not listening to la Gorda any more. The sound of her voicewas indeed a vehicle for me. Suddenly the memory of the entire event surfaced inmy mind. I reeled under the impact of remembering.La Gorda stopped talking, and as I described my memory she also recollectedeverything. We had put together the last pieces of the separate memories of ourtwo states of awareness. I remembered that don Juan and don Genaro prepared me for the crossing while Iwas in a state of normal consciousness. I rationally thought that they werepreparing me for a jump into an abyss.La Gorda remembered that to prepare her and the other apprentices for thecrossing, Silvio Manuel had hoisted them to the beams of his roof strapped inleather harnesses. There was a harness in every room of his house. They werekept suspended in them nearly all day.La Gorda commented that to have a harness in one's room is an ideal thing. TheGenaros, without really knowing what they were doing, had hit upon thequasi-memory of the harnesses they had been suspended from and had created theirgame.It was a game that combined the curative and cleansing qualities of being keptaway from the ground, with the possibility of exercising the concentration thatone needs for shifting from the right to the left side consciousness. Their gamewas indeed a device that helped them remember.La Gorda said that after she and all the apprentices had remained suspended allday, Silvio Manuel had brought them down at dusk. All of them went with him tothe bridge and waited there with the rest of the party until the Nagual JuanMatus and Genaro showed up with me. The Nagual Juan Matus explained to all ofthem that it had taken longer than he had anticipated to prepare me.I remembered that don Juan and his warriors crossed over the bridge before wedid. Dona Soledad and Eligio automatically went with them. Then Carol the Nagualwoman crossed over.From the other side of the bridge Silvio Manuel signaled us to start walking.Without saying a word, all of us began at once. Midway across the bridge, Lydia,Rosa and Pablito seemed incapable of taking one more step. Benigno and Nestorwalked almost to the end and then stopped. Only la Gorda, Josefina and I arrivedto where don Juan and the others were standing.What happened next was very much like what had happened the first time weattempted to go through. Silvio Manuel and Eligio held open something I believedwas an actual slit. I had enough energy to focus my attention on it. It was notan opening on the hill that stood at the end of the bridge, nor was it anopening in the wall of fog, although I could distinguish a foglike vapor aroundthe slit.It was a dark mysterious opening that stood by itself apart from everythingelse. It was as big as a man, but narrow. Don Genaro made a joke and called it'the cosmic vagina', a remark that brought roaring laughter from his peers. LaGorda and Josefina held on to me and we stepped in.I felt instantly that I was being crushed. The same incalculable force that hadnearly made me explode the first time had gripped me again. I could feel laGorda and Josefina merging with me. I seemed to be wider than they were and theforce flattened me against the two of them together.The next thing I knew I was lying on the ground with la Gorda and Josefina ontop of me. Silvio Manuel helped us stand up. He told me that it would beimpossible for us to join them in their journey at that time, but that perhapslater, when we had tuned ourselves to perfection, the Eagle would let us gothrough.As we walked back to his house, Silvio Manuel told me almost in a whisper thattheir path and my path had diverged from each other that night. He said that ourpaths would never meet again, and that I was alone.He exhorted me to be frugal and utilize every bit of my energy without wastingany of it. He assured me that if I could gain the totality of myself withoutexcessive drainage, I would have the energy to fulfill my task. If I drainedmyself excessively before I lost my human form, I was done for.I asked him if there was a way to avoid drainage. He shook his head. He repliedthat there was a way, but not for me. Whether I succeeded or not was not amatter of my volition. He then revealed my task. But he did not tell me how tocarry it out. He said that someday the Eagle would put someone in my path totell me how to do it. And not until I had succeeded would I be free.When we got to the house, all of us congregated in the large room. Don Juan satin the center of the room facing the southeast. The eight female warriorssurrounded him. They sat in pairs on the cardinal points, also facing thesoutheast. Then the three male warriors made a triangle outside the circle withSilvio Manuel at the vertex that pointed to the southeast. The two femalecouriers sat flanking him, and the two male couriers sat in front of him almostagainst the wall.The Nagual woman made the male apprentices sit against the east wall. She madethe women sit against the west wall. She then led me to a place directly behinddon Juan. We sat there together.We remained seated for what I thought was only an instant, yet I felt a surge ofunusual energy in my body. I believed that we had sat down and then immediatelystood up.When I asked the Nagual woman why we got up so quickly, she replied that we hadbeen sitting there for several hours, and that someday before I entered into thethird attention, all of it would come back to me.La Gorda stated that not only did she have the sensation that we sat in thatroom only for an instant, but that she was never told that it had beenotherwise.What the Nagual Juan Matus told her afterward was that she had the obligation tohelp the other apprentices, especially Josefina, and that one day I would returnto give her the final push she needed to cross totally into the other self.She was tied to me and to Josefina. In our dreaming together under Zuleica'ssupervision we had exchanged enormities of our luminosity. That was why we wereable to withstand together the pressure of the other self upon entering it inthe flesh.He also told her that it was the power of the warriors of his party which hadmade the crossing so easy this time, and that when she would have to cross onher own, she had to be prepared to do it in dreaming. After we had stood up that night, Florinda came over to where I was. She took meby the arm and walked around the room with me, while don Juan and his otherwarriors talked to the apprentices.Florinda said that I should not allow the events of that night at the bridge toconfuse me. I should not believe, as the Nagual Juan Matus had believed at onetime, that there is an actual physical passageway into the other self.The slit that I had seen was simply a construct of their intent which had beentrapped by a combination of the Nagual Juan Matus' obsession with passagewaysand Silvio Manuel's bizarre sense of humor. The mixture of both had produced thecosmic vagina.As far as she was concerned, the passage from one self to the other had nophysicality. The cosmic vagina was a physical expression of the two men's powerto move the 'wheel of time'.Florinda explained that when she or her peers talked about time, they were notreferring to something which is measured by the movement of a clock. Time is theessence of attention. The Eagle's emanations are made out of time, and properly,when one enters into any aspect of the other self, one is becoming acquaintedwith time.Florinda assured me that that very night while we sat in formation, they had hadtheir last chance to help me and the apprentices to face the wheel of time.She said that the wheel of time is like a state of heightened awareness which ispart of the other self- just as the left side awareness is part of the self ofeveryday life. Florinda said that that state could physically be described as atunnel of infinite length and width; a tunnel with reflective furrows.Every furrow is infinite, and there are infinite numbers of them. Livingcreatures are compulsorily made, by the force of life, to gaze into one furrow.To gaze into it means to be trapped by it; to live that furrow.Florinda asserted that what warriors call will belongs to the wheel of time. Itis something like the runner of a vine, or an intangible tentacle which all ofus possess. She said that a warrior's final aim is to learn to focus it on thewheel of time in order to make it turn.Warriors who have succeeded in turning the wheel of time can gaze into anyfurrow and draw from it whatever they desire, such as the cosmic vagina.To be trapped compulsorily in one furrow of time entails seeing the images ofthat furrow only as they recede. To be free from the spellbinding force of thosegrooves means that one can look in either direction, as images recede or as theyapproach.Florinda stopped talking and embraced me. She whispered in my ear that she wouldbe back to finish her instruction someday when I had gained the totality ofmyself. Then don Juan called everyone to come to where I was. They surrounded me. DonJuan spoke to me first. He said that I could not go with them on their journeybecause it was impossible that I could withdraw from my task. Under thecircumstance, the only thing they could do for me would be to wish me well.He added that warriors have no life of their own. From the moment theyunderstand the nature of awareness, they cease to be persons and the humancondition is no longer part of their view. I had my duty as a warrior andnothing else was important. I was going to be left behind to fulfill a mostobscure task.Since I had already relinquished my life, there was nothing else for them to sayto me except that I should do my best. And there was nothing for me to say tothem except that I had understood and had accepted my fate. Vicente came to my side next. He spoke very softly. He said that the challengeof a warrior is to arrive at a very subtle balance of positive and negativeforces. This challenge does not mean that a warrior should strive to haveeverything under control, but that a warrior should strive to meet anyconceivable situation, the expected and the unexpected, with equal efficiency.To be perfect under perfect circumstances was to be a paper warrior. Mychallenge was to be left behind. Theirs was to strike onward into theunknowable. Both challenges were consuming. For warriors, the excitation ofstaying put is equal to the excitation of the journey. Both are equal, becauseboth entail the fulfilling of a sacred trust. Silvio Manuel came to my side next. He was concerned with practicalities. Hegave me a formula; an incantation for times when my task would be greater thanmy strength. It was the incantation that came to my mind the first time Iremembered the Nagual woman. I am already given to the power that rules my fate.And I cling to nothing, so I will have nothing to defend.I have no thoughts, so I will see.I fear nothing, so I will remember myself. Detached and at ease,I will dart past the Eagle to be free. Ya me di al poder que a mi destino rige.No me agarro ya de nada, para asi no tener nada que defender.No tengo pensamientos, para asi poder ver.No temo ya a nada, para asi poder acordarme de mi. Sereno y dcsprendido,me dejara el aguila pasar a la libertad. He told me that he was going to reveal to me a practical maneuver of the secondattention, and right then he turned into a luminous egg. He reverted back to hisnormal appearance and repeated this transformation three or four more times. Iunderstood perfectly well what he was doing. He did not need to explain it tome, and yet I could not put into words what I knew.Silvio Manuel smiled, cognizant of my problem. He said that it took an enormityof strength to let go of the intent of everyday life. The secret that he hadjust revealed was how to expedite letting go of that intent. In order to do whathe had done, one must place one's attention on the luminous shell.He turned one more time into a luminous egg and then it became obvious to mewhat I had known all along. Silvio Manuel's eyes turned for an instant to focuson the point of the second attention. His head was straight, as if he had beenlooking ahead of him, only his eyes were askew. He said that a warrior mustevoke intent. The glance is the secret. The eyes beckon intent.I became euphoric at that point. I was at long last capable of thinking aboutsomething I knew without really knowing. The reason why seeing seems to bevisual is because we need the eyes to focus on intent. Don Juan and his party ofwarriors knew how to use their eyes to catch another aspect of intent and calledthis act seeing. What Silvio Manuel had shown me was the true function of theeyes; the catchers of intent.I then used my eyes deliberately to beckon intent. I focused them on the pointof the second attention. All of a sudden don Juan, his warriors, dona Soledad,and Eligio were luminous eggs; but not la Gorda, the three little sisters, andthe Genaros. I kept on moving my eyes back and forth between the blobs of lightand the people until I heard a crack in the base of my neck, and then everybodyin the room was a luminous egg.I felt for an instant that I could not tell them apart, but then my eyes seemedto adjust and I held two aspects of intent; two images at once. I could seetheir physical bodies and also their luminosities.The two scenes were not superimposed on each other. They were separate, and yetI could not figure out how. I definitely had two channels of vision, and seeinghad everything to do with my eyes, and yet was independent of them. I couldstill see the luminous eggs, but not their physical bodies when I closed myeyes.I had at one moment the clearest sensation that I knew how to shift my attentionto my luminosity. I also knew that to revert to the physical level all I had todo was to focus my eyes on my body. Don Genaro came to my side next and told me that the Nagual Juan Matus, as aparting gift, had given me duty, Vicente had given me challenge, Silvio Manuelhad given me magic, and he was going to give me humor. He looked me up and downand commented that I was the sorriest looking Nagual he had ever seen. Heexamined the apprentices and concluded that there was nothing else for us to do,except to be optimistic and to look on the positive side of things. He told us ajoke about a country girl who was seduced and jilted by a city slicker. When shewas told on the day of her wedding that the groom had left town, she pulledherself together with the sobering thought that not everything had been lost.She had lost her virginity, but she had not yet killed her piglet for thewedding feast.Don Genaro told us that the only thing that would help us to get out of oursituation, which was the situation of the jilted bride, was to hold onto ourpiglets, whatever they might be, and laugh ourselves silly. Only throughlaughter could we change our condition.He coaxed us with gestures of his head and hands to give him a hearty 'ha-ha'.The sight of the apprentices trying to laugh was as ridiculous as my ownattempt. Suddenly I was laughing with don Juan and his warriors.Don Genaro, who had always made jokes about my being a poet, asked me to read apoem out loud. He said that he wanted to summarize his sentiments and hisrecommendations with the poem that celebrates life, death and laughter. He wasreferring to a fraction of Jose Gorostiza's poem, \"Death Without End.\"The Nagual woman handed me the book and I read the part that don Juan and donGenaro had always liked. Oh, what blind joyWhat hunger to use upthe air that we breathe,the mouth, the eye, the hand.What biting itchto spend absolutely all of ourselvesin one single burst of laughter.Oh, this impudent, insulting deaththat assassinates us from afar.over the pleasure that we take in dyingfor a cup of tea...for a faint caress. The setting for the poem was overpowering. I felt a shiver. Emilito and the courier Juan Tuma came to my side. At first, they did not say aword. Their eyes were shining like black marbles. All their feelings seemed tobe focused in their eyes.Then the courier Juan Tuma said very softly that once he had ushered me into themysteries of Mescalito at his house, and that that had been a forerunner ofanother occasion in the wheel of time when he would usher me into the ultimatemystery.Emilito said, as if his voice were an echo of the courier Juan Tuma's, that bothof them were confident that I was going to fulfill my task. They would bewaiting because for I would join them someday.The courier Juan Tuma added that the Eagle had put me with the Nagual JuanMatus' party as my rescue unit. They embraced me again and whispered in unisonthat I should trust myself. After the couriers, the female warriors came to me. Each one hugged me andwhispered a wish in my ear; a wish of plenitude and fulfillment. The Nagual woman came to me last. She sat down and held me in her lap as if Iwere a child. She exuded affection and purity. I was breathless. We stood up andwalked around the room. We talked about and pondered our fate. Forces impossibleto fathom had guided us to that culminating moment. The awe that I felt wasimmeasurable. And so was my sadness.She then revealed a portion of the rule that applies to the three-prongedNagual. She was in a state of ultimate agitation and yet she was calm. Herintellect was peerless and yet she was not trying to reason anything out.Her last day on earth overwhelmed her. She filled me with her mood. It was as ifup to that moment I had not quite realized the finality of our situation. Beingon my left side entailed that the primacy of the immediate took precedence,which made it practically impossible for me to foresee beyond that moment.However, the impact of her mood engaged a great deal of my right side awarenessand its capacity to prejudge feelings that are to come. I realized that I wouldnever again see her. That was unbearable!Don Juan had told me that on the left side there are no tears; that a warriorcan no longer weep; and that the only expression of anguish is a shiver thatcomes from the very depths of the universe. It is as if one of the Eagle'semanations is anguish. The warrior's shiver is infinite.As the Nagual woman talked to me and held me, I felt that shiver.She put her arms around my neck and pressed her head against mine. I thought shewas wringing me like a piece of cloth. I felt something coming out of my body,or out of hers into mine. My anguish was so intense, and it flooded me so fastthat I went berserk. I fell to the floor with the Nagual woman still embracingme. I thought, as if in a dream, that I must have gashed her forehead in ourfall. Her face and mine were covered with blood. Blood had pooled in her eyes. Don Juan and don Genaro very swiftly lifted me up. They held me. I was havinguncontainable spasms, like seizures.The female warriors surrounded the Nagual woman. Then they stood in a row in themiddle of the room. The men joined them. In one moment there was an undeniablechain of energy going between them.The row moved and paraded in front of me. Each one of them came for a moment andstood in front of me, but without breaking the row. It was as if they weremoving on a conveyor that transported them and made each of them stop in frontof me.The male couriers went by first, then the female couriers, then the malewarriors, then the dreamers, the stalkers, and finally the Nagual woman. Theywent by me and remained in full view for a second or two, long enough to saygoodbye, and then they disappeared into the blackness of the mysterious slitthat had appeared in the room.Don Juan pressed my back and relieved some of my unbearable anguish. He saidthat he understood my pain, and that the affinity of the Nagual man and theNagual woman is not something that can be formulated. It exists as a result ofthe emanations of the Eagle. Once the two people are put together and areseparated there is no way to fill the emptiness because it is not socialemptiness, but a movement of those emanations.Don Juan told me then that he was going to make me shift to my extreme right. Hesaid that it was a merciful, although temporary maneuver. It would allow me toforget for the time being, but it would not soothe me when I remembered.Don Juan also told me that the act of remembering is thoroughlyincomprehensible. In actuality it is the act of remembering oneself which doesnot stop at recollecting the interaction warriors perform in their left sideawareness, but goes on to recollect every memory that the luminous body hasstored from the moment of birth.The systematic interaction warriors go through in states of heightenedconsciousness is only a device to entice the other self to reveal itself interms of memories. This act of remembering, although it seems to be onlyassociated with warriors, is something that is within the realm of every humanbeing. Every one of us can go directly to the memories of our luminosity withunfathomable results.Don Juan said then that that day they would leave at dusk and that the onlything they still had to do for me was to create an opening; an interruption inthe continuum of my time.They were going to make me jump into an abyss as a means of interrupting theEagle's emanation that accounts for my feeling that I am whole and continuous.The jump was going to be done while I was in a state of normal awareness, andthe idea was that my second attention would take over.Rather than dying at the bottom of the abyss I would enter fully into the otherself. Don Juan said that I would eventually come out of the other self once myenergy was exhausted; but I would not come out on the same mountaintop fromwhere I was going to jump. He predicted that I would emerge at my favorite spotwherever it might be. This would be the interruption in the continuum of mytime.He then pushed me completely out of my left side awareness. And I forgot myanguish, my purpose, and my task. At dusk that afternoon, Pablito, Nestor and I did jump off a precipice. TheNagual's blow had been so accurate and so merciful that nothing of the momentousevent of their farewell transcended beyond the limits of the other momentousevent of jumping to certain death and not dying. Awe-inspiring as that eventwas, it was pale in comparison to what was taking place in another realm.Don Juan made me jump at the precise moment when he and all of his warriors hadkindled their awareness. I had a dreamlike vision of a row of people looking atme. Afterwards I rationalized it as just one of a long series of visions orhallucinations I had had upon jumping. This was the meager interpretation of myright side awareness, overwhelmed by the awesomeness of the total event.On my left side, however, I realized that I had entered into the other self, andthis entrance had had nothing to do with my rationality. The warriors of donJuan's party had caught me for an eternal instant before they vanished into thetotal light; before the Eagle let them go through.I knew that they were in a range of the Eagle's emanations which was beyond myreach. They were waiting for don Juan and don Genaro. I saw don Juan taking thelead. And then there was only a line of exquisite lights in the sky. Somethinglike a wind seemed to make the cluster of lights contract and wriggle. There wasa massive glow on one end of the line of lights where don Juan was. I thought ofthe plumed serpent of the Toltec legend. And then the lights were gone. ### \"The Eagle's Gift\" - The End ### Continue to the next page for \"The Six Explanatory Propositions\" which wereincluded in the Spanish language version of the Eagle's Gift but were neverpublished in the English versions of the book. ================================================================= Six Explanatory Propositions: from \"The Eagle's Gift: Spanish Version\" "},{"pageContent":"Introduction to the Six Explanatory Propositions In spite of the amazing maneuvers that don Juan did with my awareness along theyears, I stubbornly insisted in trying to intellectually evaluate what he did.Although I have written at length about these maneuvers, it has always been froma strictly experiential point of view. And even more restrictively, my writingshave always been from a strictly rational perspective on the experiences.Unfortunately, immersed as I was in my own rationality, I couldn't recognize thetrue goals of the teachings of Don Juan.To understand the stretch of don Juan's goals with a certain degree ofprecision, it was necessary that I lose my human form and arrive at the totalityof myself.The teachings of Don Juan were meant to guide me through the second stage of awarrior's development so that I would verify, and accept without restriction,that within each of us lies another type of awareness outside the bounds ofcommon rationality.This stage of warriorship was divided into two categories: action andexplanation.The first category, for which Don Juan required Don Genaro's help, dealt withphysical activities consisting of showing me certain procedures, actions, andmethods that were designed to exercise and enhance my awareness- primarilyletting my body directly experience the other type of awareness. The secondcategory had to do with the six explanatory propositions which don Juan gave myintellect in an attempt to describe the other type of awareness.Due to the difficulties that I had in adapting my rationality in order to acceptthe plausibility of what he was teaching me, Don Juan improvisied and presentedthese explanatory propositions in terms similar to an academic presentation.The first thing he did, however, as an introductory step, was to create adivision in me by means of a specific blow on the right shoulder blade. Thisblow made me enter an unusual state of awareness which I couldn't recall once Iwas back to normality.Until the moment in which Don Juan made me enter such a unique state ofawareness, I had an undeniable sense of continuity which I thought of as thenormal product of my vital life experiences. The idea that I had about myselfwas that of being a entity that could fully explain everything I had done. I wasconvinced that the dwelling of all my awareness and experiences was in my head.However, Don Juan showed me with his blow that there exists a point in thespinal cord at the height of the shoulder blades that is obviously a center ofan enhanced awareness.When I questioned the Nagual Don Juan about the nature of this blow, heexplained that the Nagual is a director; a guide who bears the responsibility ofopening the way; and that a Nagual must be impeccable to instill in hisapprentices a sense of confidence and clarity. Only under these conditions can anagual possibly give this blow on the back to force a displacement of awareness.Because the power of the nagual is what allows the transition, if the nagual isnot an impeccable practitioner, the displacement doesn't occur- as when I tried,unsuccessfully, to put the other apprentices in a state of heightened awarenessby hitting them on the back before we ventured onto the bridge.I asked Don Juan what this displacement of awareness implied. He said that thenagual has to strike on a precise spot, which varies from person to person butwhich is always located in the general area of the shoulder blades. A nagual hasto see to specify the spot which is located in the periphery of one's luminosityand not on the physical body itself. Once the nagual identifies it, he pushes itin, more that striking it, and thus creates a concavity; a depression in theluminous shield. The state of heightened awareness resulting from this blowlasts as long as this depression lasts. Some luminous shields go back to theiroriginal forms by themselves; some have to be struck in another point to berestored; and some others never go back to their original shapes.Don Juan said that seers see awareness as a peculiar glow. Everyday awareness isa glow on the right side which extends from the physical body's exterior to theperiphery of our luminosity. Heightened awareness is a more intense shineassociated with great speed and concentration; a shine which saturates theperiphery of the left side.Don Juan said that seers explain what happens with the blow of the nagual as atemporal dislodging of a center located in the luminous cocoon of the body. TheEagle's emanations are in reality evaluated and selected in that center. Theblow alters their normal behavior.Through their observations, seers have reached the conclusion that warriors mustbe put in that state of disorientation. The change in the way awareness worksunder these conditions makes this state an ideal territory to elucidate[*elucidate -make free from confusion or ambiguity; make clear] the commands ofthe Eagle: It allows warriors to function as if they were in everyday awareness,with the difference that they can concentrate in everything they do withunprecedented clarity and strength.Don Juan said that my situation was analogous to the one he had experienced. Hisbenefactor created a deep division in himself, making him shift again and againfrom the awareness of the right side to the awareness to the left side.The clarity and freedom of his left side awareness were in direct opposition tothe rationalizations and endless defenses of his right side. He told me that allwarriors are cast into the depths of the same situation that this polaritymolds, and that the Nagual creates and reinforces the division in an effort tolead his apprentices to the conviction that there is an awareness in humanbeings yet unexplored.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"1. What we perceive as the world are the Eagle's emanations.Don Juan explained to me that the world we perceive does not have atranscendental existence. Since we are familiarized with it, we believe thatwhat we perceive is a world of objects which exist such as we perceive them,when in reality there is not a world of objects, but rather, a universe ofEagle's emanations.These emanations represent the only immutable reality. It is a reality thatencompasses all that is: perceivable and unperceivable; knowable and unknowable.Seers who see the Eagle's emanations call them commands because of their urgingforce. All living creatures are urged to use the emanations, and they use themwithout getting to know what they are. Ordinary men interpret them as reality.And seers who see the emanations interpret them as the rule.Despite the fact that seers see the emanations, they don't have a way of knowingwhat it is they are seeing. Instead of entangling themselves with uselessconjectures, seers occupy themselves in the functional speculation of how theEagle's commands can be interpreted. Don Juan maintained that to intuit areality which transcends the world we perceive stays at the level of conjecture.It is not enough for a warrior to conjecture that the Eagle's commands areinstantly perceived by all creatures that live on Earth, and that none of themperceives them in the same way. Warriors must try to behold the flow ofemanations and \"see\" the way in which man and other living beings use it tobuild their perceptual world.When I proposed to use the word \"description\" instead of Eagles's emanations,Don Juan said that he was not making a metaphor. He said that the word\"description\" connotes a human agreement, and that what we perceive stems from acommand in which human agreements do not count. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"2. Attention is what makes us perceive the Eagle's emanations as the action ofskimming.Don Juan used to say that perception is a physical faculty that living creaturesgroom. The final result of this grooming is known, among seers, as \"attention\".Don Juan described attention as the action of hooking and channeling perception.He said that this action is our most singular feat which covers all the spectrumof both human alternatives and human possibilities. Don Juan established aprecise distinction between alternatives and possibilities. Human alternativesare those that we are enabled to choose as persons who function within thesocial environment. Our landscape of this dominion is quite limited. Humanpossibilities are those that we are capable of achieving as luminous beings.Don Juan revealed to me a classificatory scheme of three types of attention,emphasizing that calling them \"types\" was erroneous. In fact, they are threelevels of knowledge: first, second and third attention; each one of them anindependent dominion, complete in itself.For a warrior that is in the initial stages of his learning, the first attentionis the most important of the three. Don Juan said that his explanatorypropositions were attempts to bring into first-frame the way in which the firstattention works; something that passes completely unadverted [*unadverted -notgiven attention to] to us. He considered it imperative for warriors tounderstand the nature of the first attention if they were going to venture intothe other two. He explained to me that the first attention has been taught howto move instantly through a whole spectrum of the Eagle's emanations, withoutemphasizing at all that fact, in order to reach \"perceptual units\" which all ofus have learned that are perceivable. Seers call this feat \"skimming\" because itimplies the capability of suppressing those emanations which are superfluous,and selecting which of them must be emphasized.Don Juan explained this process by taking as an example the mountain that wewere seeing at that moment. He stressed that my first attention, at the momentof seeing the mountain, had skimmed an infinite number of emanations to obtain amiracle of perception; a skimming that all human beings know because each one ofthem has attained it by himself.Seers contend that everything the first attention suppresses to obtain askimming, cannot be recovered anymore by the first attention under anycondition. Once we learn to perceive in terms of skimmings, our senses stopregistering the superfluous emanations. To elucidate [*elucidate -make free fromconfusion or ambiguity; make clear] this point he gave me the example of theskimming \"human body\". He said that our first attention is totally unconsciousof the emanations that compose the external luminous shield of the physicalbody. Our oval cocoon is not subjected to perception; those emanations have beenrejected which would make it perceivable in a benefit to those emanations whichallow the first attention to perceive the physical body such as we know it.Therefore, the perceptual goal that children must achieve as they grow upconsists in learning to isolate the appropriate emanations to be able to channeltheir chaotic perception and transform it into the first attention. In doing so,they learn how to build skimmings. All grown up human beings who surroundchildren teach them how to skim. Sooner or later, children learn to controltheir first attention in order to perceive skimmings in terms which are alike tothose of their teachers.Don Juan never ceased to be amazed at the capability of human beings to bringorder into the chaos of perception. He contended that all of us, by his/her ownmerits, is a magistral magician, and that our magic consists in renderingreality to the skimmings that our first attention has learned how to build. Thefact that we perceive in terms of skimmings is the Eagle's command, but toperceive the commands as objects is our power, our magical gift. Our fallacy, onthe other hand, is that we always end up being one-sided when forgetting thatskimmings are only real in terms that we perceive them as real due to the powerthat we have to do it. Don Juan called this an error in judgment which destroysthe richness of our mysterious origins. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"3. The skimmings are made sense of by the first ring of power.Don Juan used to say that the first ring of power is the force that stems fromthe Eagle's emanations to affect exclusively our first attention. He explainedthat it has been represented as a \"ring \" because of its dynamism; of itsuninterrupted movement. It has been called ring \"of power\" due to, first, itscompulsive character, and, second, because of its unique ability to stop itsworks; to change them or to reverse their direction.The first ring of power's compulsive character is better shown in the fact thatnot only does it urge the first attention to build and perpetuate skimmings, butit also demands a consensus from all the participants. Of each one of us isdemanded a complete agreement upon the faithful reproduction of skimmings sinceconformity to the first ring of power must be total.It is precisely this conformity which gives us the certainty that skimmings areobjects which exist as such; independent from our perception. Besides, thecompulsiveness of the first ring of power does not cease after the initialagreement, but it demands that we continuously renovate the agreement. Forexample, during our whole life we must operate as if each one of our skimmingswas perceptually the first one for each human being in spite of languages andcultures. Don Juan granted that even if all this is too serious to be takenjokingly, the urging character of the first ring of power is so intense that itforces us to believe that if the \"mountain\" could have an awareness of its own,it would consider itself as the skimming that we have learned how to build.The most valuable feature that the first ring of power bears to a warrior is thesingular capability of interrupting its flux of energy, or to totally suspendit. Don Juan said that this is a latent capability which exists within us all asa backup unit. In our narrow world of skimmings, there is no need to use it.Since we are so efficiently buttressed and shielded by the net of the firstattention, we do not realize, not even vaguely, that we have hidden resources.However, if another alternative to follow would present itself to us, such as isthe warrior's option to use the second attention, the latent capability of thefirst ring of power could start to function and could be used with spectacularresults.Don Juan underlined that the biggest feat of sorcerers is the process ofactivating this latent capability. He called it blocking the intent of the firstring of power. He explained to me that the Eagle's emanations, which havealready been isolated by the first attention in order to build the everydayworld, exert an unbending pressure upon the first attention. For this pressureto stop its activity, the intent must be displaced. Seers call this anobstruction; or an interruption of the first ring of power. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"4. Intent is the force that moves the first ring of power.Don Juan explained to me that \"intent\" does not refer to having an intention, orto wanting one thing or the other; but rather has to do with an imponderable [*imponderable- difficult or impossible to evaluate with precision] force thatmakes us behave in ways which could be described as intentions, wishing,volition, etc. Don Juan didn't bring intent forth as a condition of beingstemming from oneself, such as a habit produced by socialization nor by abiological reaction; but rather, don Juan brought intent forth as a private,intimate force that we possess and use individually as a key that makes thefirst ring of power move in acceptable ways. Intent is what directs our firstattention in order for it to focus on the Eagle's emanations within a certainframe. And intent is also what commands the first ring of power to obstruct orinterrupt its flux of energy.Don Juan suggested to me that I conceive intent as an invisible force whichexists in the universe, without revealinging itself, but which still affectingeverything: The force that creates and sustains skimmings. He asserted thatskimmings must be incessantly recreated to be imbued with continuity. In orderto recreate them each time with the freshness that they need to build a livingworld, we must intend them each time we build them. For instance, we must intendthe \"mountain\" along with all its complexities for the skimming to be fullymaterialized. Don Juan said that, for a spectator, who behaves exclusively basedupon the first attention without the intervention of intent, the \"mountain\"would appear as an entirely different skimming. It could appear as the skimming\"geometric form\" or \"amorphous spot of color\". For the skimming mountain to becompleted, the spectator must intend it, whether it is unconsciously through theurging force of the first ring of power, or premeditatedly, through thewarrior's training.Don Juan pointed out to me the three ways in which intent comes to us.The most predominating one is known by seers as \"the intent of the first ring ofpower\". This is a blind intent which comes to us by chance. It is as if we werein its way, or as if intent was in ours. Inevitably we find ourselves trapped inits net without having the least control of what is happening to us.The second way is when intent comes to us by its own. This requires aconsiderable amount of purpose; a sense of determination on our part. Only inour capability as warriors we can put ourselves voluntarily in the way ofintent: We summon it, so to speak. Don Juan explained to me that his insistencein being an impeccable warrior was nothing more than an effort to let intentknow that he is putting himself in its way.Don Juan used to say that warriors call this phenomenon \"power\". Thus when theyspeak of having personal power, they are referring to the intent that comes tothem voluntarily. The outcome, he used to say to me, can be described as thefacility to find new solutions; or the facility to affect people or events. Itis as if other possibilities, previously unknown by the warrior, suddenly becomeapparent. In this way, an impeccable warrior never plans anything ahead, but hisactions are so decisive that it seems as if the warrior had calculatedbeforehand each facet of his activity.The third way in which we find intent is the most rare and complex of the three.It occurs when intent allows us to harmonize with it. Don Juan described thisstate as the real moment of power; the culmination of a lifetime effort insearch of impeccability. Only supreme warriors obtain it, and as long as theyare in such state, intent lets itself be handled by them at will. It is as ifintent had fused in those warriors, and in doing so it transforms them into apure force without preconceptions. Seers call this state the \"intent of thesecond ring of power\", or \"will\". ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"5. The first ring of power can be stopped by a functional blocking of thecapability of building skimmings.Don Juan used to say that the function of the \"not-doings\" is to create anobstruction in the usual focus of our first attention. The not-doings are, inthis sense, maneuvers destined to prepare the first attention for the functionalblocking of the first ring of power, or, in other words, for the interruption ofintent.Don Juan explained to me that this functional blocking, which is the only methodto systematically use the latent capability of the first ring of power,represents a temporal interruption that the benefactor creates in the disciple'scapability for building skimmings. It is a premeditated and powerful artificialintrusion into the first attention in order to push it beyond the appearanceswhich the known skimmings present to us. This intrusion is accomplished byinterrupting the intent of the first ring of power.Don Juan used to say that in order to achieve this interruption, the benefactortreats intent as what it really is: a flux; a current of energy that caneventually be stopped or reoriented. An interruption of this nature, however,implies a commotion of such magnitude that can force the first ring of power tostop fully; a situation which is impossible to conceive under our normal lifeconditions. It is unthinkable to us that we can un-walk the steps we took whenwe consolidated our perception, but it is feasible that under the impact of thisinterruption we could place ourselves in a perceptual position very similar tothe one of our beginnings when the Eagle's commands were emanations which westill had not imbued with significance.Don Juan used to say that any procedure the benefactor could use to create thisinterruption must be intimately linked with his personal power. Therefore, abenefactor doesn't use any process to handle intent, but rather moves it andmakes it available to the apprentice trough his personal power. In my case, DonJuan achieved the functional blocking of my first ring of power through acomplex process which combined three methods: my ingestion of hallucinogenicplants, the manipulation of my body, and his maneuvering with intent itself.In the beginning Don Juan relied strongly upon the ingestion of hallucinogenicplants- apparently due to the persistence of my rational side. The effect wastremendous, and yet retarded the sought for interruption. The fact that I viewedthe plants as hallucinogenic offered my reason the perfect justification tocongregate all of its available resources to continue exerting control.I was at that time convinced that I could logically explain anything that I wasexperiencing including the inconceivable feats that Don Juan and Don Genaro usedto do to create the interruptions. I explained the interuptions as perceptualdistortions caused by the ingestion of hallucinogenics.Don Juan used to say that the most remarkable effect of the hallucinogenicplants every time I ingested them was something that I interpreted as thepeculiar feeling that everything around me oozed a surprising richness. Therewere colors, forms, details that I had never beheld before. Don Juan used thisincrement in my ability to perceive, and through a series of commands andcomments used to force me to enter a state of nervous restlessness.Afterwards he manipulated my body and made me shift from one side of awarenessto the other until I had created phantasmagorical visions or absolutely realscenes with three-dimensional creatures that could not possibly exist in thisworld.Don Juan explained to me that when the direct relation between intent and ourconstructed skimmings is broken, it cannot ever be repaired. From that moment onwe acquire the ability to catch a current of what he described as \"phantomintent\"; or the intent of the skimmings which are not present at the moment orplace of the interruption. This is to say that intent is put at our disposalthrough some aspect of our memory of the breaking.Don Juan asserted that with the interruption of the intent of the first ring ofpower we become receptive and moldable. A nagual can then introduce the intentof the second ring of power.Don Juan was convinced that children of a certain age find themselves in asimilar situation of receptivity. Being deprived of intent, they are ready to beimprinted with any intent which is available to the teachers who surround them.After my period of continious ingestion of hallucinogenic plants, Don Juantotally discontinuated its use. However, he obtained new and more dramaticinterruptions in me by manipulating my body, and making me shift states ofawareness, combining all this with maneuvers with intent itself. Through acombination of mesmerizing instructions and adequate comments, Don Juan createda current of \"phantom intent\" and I was lead to experience common skimmings assomething unimaginable. He conceptualized all this as \"glancing into theimmensity of the Eagle\".Don Juan masterfully lead me through countless interruptions of intent until hewas convinced, as a seer, that my body showed the effects of the functionalblocking of the first ring of power. He said that he could see a unusualactivity around the area of the shoulder blades. He described it as a littlehole that had formed exactly as if the luminosity was a muscular layercontracted by a nerve.To me, the effect of the functional blocking of the first ring of power was thatit managed to erase the certainty which I had all my life that what my sensesreported was \"real\". Quietly I entered a state of inner silence.Don Juan used to say that what gives warriors the extreme uncertainty that hisbenefactor had experienced at the end of his life- that resignation to failurethat don Juan himself was living- is the fact that one glance into the immensityof the Eagle leaves one without hope. Hope is the result of our familiarity withskimmings and the idea that we control them.In such moments only the warrior's way of life can help us to persevere in ourefforts to discover that which the Eagle has concealed from us; to persevere inour efforts without hope that we can get to understand what we discover. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"6. The second attention.Don Juan explained to me that the examination of the second attention must beginwith the realization that the force of the first ring of power, which boxes usin, is a physical, concrete edge. Seers have described it as a wall of fog; abarrier that can be systematically brought to our awareness by means of theblocking of the first ring of power. Then the barrier can be perforated by meansof the warrior's training.After perforating this wall of fog, one enters a broad intermediate state. Thetask of the warriors then consists in going through this barrier until theyreach the next divisory line, which also must be perforated in order to enterwhat it is properly the other self; or the second attention.Don Juan used to say that the two divisory lines are perfectly recognizable.When warriors perforate the wall of fog they feel that their bodies aresqueezed; or they feel an intense shaking in the cavity of their bodies,generally to the right of the stomach or through the middle part, from right toleft. When warriors perforate the second line, they feel an acute crack on theupper part of the body, something like the sound of a dry bough that is brokenin two.The two lines that box in both attentions, and individually seal them, are knownto seers as the parallel lines. These seal both attentions by means of the factthat they extend into infinity, without ever allowing the crossing unless theyare perforated.Between both lines there exists an area of specific awareness that seers calllimbo; or the world between the parallel lines. It is a real space between twohuge orders of the Eagle's emanations; emanations which are within the humanpossibilities of awareness. One is the level which creates the self of everydaylife, and the other is the level which creates the other self. Since the limbois a transitional zone, there both fields of emanations extend one upon theother. The fraction of the level which is known to us, that extends into thatarea, hooks a portion of the first ring of power; and the capability of thefirst ring of power to build skimmings makes us perceive a series of skimmingsin the limbo which are almost like those of everyday life except that theyappear grotesque, uncanny and contorted. In this manner the limbo has specificfeatures that do not change arbitrarily each time that one goes into it. Thereexist in it physical features which resemble the skimmings of everyday life.Don Juan sustained that the feeling of heaviness experienced in the limbo is dueto the growing burden that has been placed on the first attention. In the arealocated right behind the wall of fog we can still behave as we do normally: Itis as if we were in a grotesque but recognizable world.As we penetrate further into limbo beyond the wall of fog, it becomesprogressively difficult to recognize the features or to behave in terms of theknown self. He explained to me that it was possible then to make anything elseappear instead of the wall of fog; but that seers have opted for accentuatingthat which consumes less energy: to visualize the wall of fog does not demandany effort.What exists beyond the second divisory line is known by seers as the secondattention, or the other self, or the parallel world; and the action of goingthrough both edges is known as \"crossing the parallel lines\". Don Juan thoughtthat I could assimilate this concept more firmly if he described each dominionof awareness as a specific perceptual predisposition.He told me that in the territory of everyday awareness we are inescapablyentangled into the specific perceptual predisposition of the first attention.From the moment in which the first ring of power begins to build skimmings, theway of building them becomes our normal perceptual predisposition.Breaking the unifying force of the first attention implies to break the firstdivisory line. The normal perceptual predisposition passes then into theintermediate area which is between the parallel lines, and one keeps buildingalmost normal skimmings for some time. But as one approaches what seers call thesecond divisory line, the perceptual predisposition of the first attentionbegins to recede; it loses strength. Don Juan used to say that this transitionis marked by a sudden incapability of remembering or understanding what one isdoing.When one gets closer to the second divisory line, the second attention begins toact on the warriors who undertake the voyage. If they are inexperienced, theirawareness gets emptied; it goes blank. Don Juan held that this occurs becausethey are approaching a spectrum of the Eagle's emanations which has not yet asystematized perceptual predisposition. My experiences with la Gorda and thenagual woman beyond the wall of fog were an example of this incapability. Itraveled as far as the other self, but I couldn't account on what we had donefor the simple reason that my second attention was still unformulated and it didnot give me the opportunity of formulating all what I had perceived.Don Juan explained to me that one begins to activate the second ring of power byforcing the second attention to wake from its slumber. The functional blockingof the first ring of power achieves this.Then, the task of the teacher consists in recreating the condition which startedthe first ring of power; the condition of being saturated with intent. The firstring of power was put in motion by the force of the intent given by those whotaught me how to skim. As my teacher he was giving me, then, a new intent whichwould create a new perceptual environment.Don Juan said that it takes a lifetime of unceasing discipline which seers callunbending intent to prepare the second ring of power to be able to buildskimmings which belong to another level of the Eagle's emanations. For theperceptual predisposition of the parallel self to dominate is a feat of peerlessvalue which few warriors achieve. Silvio Manuel was one of those few.Don Juan warned me, however, that one must not attempt to deliberately cause theparallel self to dominate. Achievement in the second attention must be through anatural process which unfolds itself without much effort from our part. Heexplained to me that the reasoning behind this needed indifference lies on thepractical consideration that if the parallel self dominates, it simply becomesvery difficult to break in the quest for the third attention; and the goal thatwarriors actively pursuit is to break both perceptual predispositions to enterthe final freedom of the third attention. ### Six Explanatory Propositions: from \"The Eagle's Gift: Spanish Version\" - TheEnd ###"}]
