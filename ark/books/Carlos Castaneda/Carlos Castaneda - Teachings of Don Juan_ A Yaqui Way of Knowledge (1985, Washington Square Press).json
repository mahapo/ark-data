I thoughtthat my visit on that day was going to be in no way different from the scores oftimes I had gone to see him in the ten years I had been his apprentice. Theevents that took place on that day and on the following days, however, weremomentous to me. On that occasion my apprenticeship came to an end. This was notan arbitrary withdrawal on my part but a bona fide termination.I have already presented the case of my apprenticeship in two previous works:\"The Teachings of Don Juan\" and \"A Separate Reality\".My basic assumption in both books has been that the articulation [*articulation- the shape or manner in which things come together and a connectionis made] points in learning to be a sorcerer were the states of nonordinaryreality produced by the ingestion of psychotropic plants.In this respect don Juan was an expert in the use of three such plants: Daturainoxia, commonly known as jimpson weed; Lophorphora williamsii, known as peyote;and a hallucinogenic mushroom of the genus Psilocybe.My perception of the world through the effects of those psychotropics had beenso bizarre and impressive that I was forced to assume that such states were theonly avenue to communicating and learning what don Juan was attempting to teachme.That assumption was erroneous. [* erroneous- incorrect or based on an incorrectassumption; containing or characterized by error; innacurate]For the purposes of avoiding any misunderstandings about my work with don Juan Iwould like to clarify the following issues at this point.So far I have made no attempt whatsoever to place don Juan in a cultural milieu.[* milieu- the environmental condition] The fact that he considers himself to bea Yaqui Indian does not mean that his knowledge of sorcery is known to orpractised by the Yaqui Indians in general.All the conversations that don Juan and I have had throughout the apprenticeshipwere conducted in Spanish, and only because of his thorough command of thatlanguage was I capable of obtaining complex explanations of his system ofbeliefs.I have maintained the practice of referring to that system as sorcery; and Ihave also maintained the practice of referring to don Juan as a sorcerer becausethese were categories he himself used.Since I was capable of writing down most of what was said in the beginning of myapprenticeship, and everything that was said in the later phases of it, Igathered voluminous field notes. In order to render those notes readable andstill preserve the dramatic unity of don Juan's teachings, I have had to editthem. But what I have deleted is, I believe, immaterial to the points I want toraise.In the case of my work with don Juan, I have limited my efforts solely toviewing him as a sorcerer, and to acquiring membership in his knowledge.For the purpose of presenting my argument, I must first explain the basicpremise of sorcery as don Juan presented it to me. He said that for a sorcerer,the world of everyday life is not as real, or out there, as we believe it is.For a sorcerer, reality, or the world we all know, is only a description.For the sake of validating this premise, don Juan concentrated the best of hisefforts into leading me to a genuine conviction that what I held in mind as 'theworld at hand' was merely a description of the world; a description that hadbeen pounded into me from the moment I was born.He pointed out that everyone who comes into contact with a child is a teacherwho incessantly describes the world to that child, until the moment when thechild is capable of perceiving the world as it is described.According to don Juan, we have no memory of that portentous [* portentous- ofmomentous or ominous significance] moment, simply because none of us couldpossibly have had any point of reference to compare it to anything else.From that moment on, however, the child is a member. He or she knows thedescription of the world. Their membership becomes full-fledged, I suppose, whenthey are capable of making all the proper perceptual interpretations which, byconforming to that description, validate it.For don Juan, then, the reality of our day-to-day life consists of an endlessflow of perceptual interpretations which we, the individuals who share aspecific membership, have learned to make in common.The idea that the perceptual interpretations that make up our world have a flowis congruous with the fact that they run uninterruptedly; and they are rarely,if ever, open to question.In fact, the reality of the world we know is so taken for granted that the basicpremise of sorcery- that our reality is merely one of many descriptions- couldhardly be taken as a serious proposition.Fortunately, in the case of my apprenticeship, don Juan was not concerned at allwith whether or not I could take his proposition seriously.He proceeded to elucidate his points, in spite of my opposition, my disbelief,and my inability to understand what he was saying. Thus, as a teacher ofsorcery, don Juan endeavoured to describe the world to me from the very firsttime we talked. My difficulty in grasping his concepts and methods stemmed fromthe fact that the units of his description were alien and incompatible withthose of my own.His contention was that he was teaching me how to 'see' as opposed to merely'looking', and that 'stopping the world' was the first step to 'seeing'.For years I had treated the idea of 'stopping the world' as a cryptic metaphorthat really did not mean anything. It was only during an informal conversationthat took place towards the end of my apprenticeship that I came fully torealize its scope and importance as one of the main propositions of don Juan'sknowledge. Don Juan and I had been talking about different things in a relaxed andunstructured manner. I told him about a friend of mine and his dilemma with hisnine year old son. The child, who had been living with the mother for the pastfour years, was then living with my friend; and the problem was what to do withhim?According to my friend, the child was a misfit in school. He lackedconcentration and was not interested in anything. He was given to tantrums,disruptive behaviour, and to running away from home.\"Your friend certainly does have a problem,\" don Juan said, laughing.I wanted to keep on telling him all the 'terrible' things the child had done,but he interrupted me.\"There is no need to say any more about that poor little boy,\" he said. \"Thereis no need for you or for me to regard his actions in our thoughts one way oranother.\"His manner was abrupt and his tone was firm, but then he smiled.\"What can my friend do?\" I asked.\"The worst thing he could do is to force that child to agree with him,\" don Juansaid.\"What do you mean?\"\"I mean that that child shouldn't be spanked or scared by his father when hedoesn't behave the way he wants him to.\"\"How can he teach him anything if he isn't firm with him?\"\"Your friend should let someone else spank the child.\"\"He can't let anyone else touch his little boy!\" I said, surprised at hissuggestion.Don Juan seemed to enjoy my reaction and giggled.\"Your friend is not a warrior,\" he said. \"If he were, he would know that theworst thing one can do is to confront human beings bluntly.\"\"What does a warrior do, don Juan?\"\"A warrior proceeds strategically.\"\"I still don't understand what you mean.\"\"I mean that if your friend were a warrior he would help his child to 'stop theworld'.\"\"How can my friend do that?\"\"He would need personal power. He would need to be a sorcerer.\"\"But he isn't.\"\"In that case he must use ordinary means to help his son to change his idea ofthe world. It is not 'stopping the world', but it will work just the same.\"I asked him to explain his statements.\"If I were your friend,\" don Juan said, \"I would start by hiring someone tospank the little guy. I would go to skid row and hire the worst-looking man Icould find.\"\"To scare a little boy?\"\"Not just to scare a little boy, you fool. That little fellow must be stopped,and being beaten by his father won't do it.\"If one wants to stop our fellow men one must always be outside the circle thatpresses them. That way one can always direct the pressure.\"The idea was preposterous, but somehow it was appealing to me.Don Juan was resting his chin on his left palm. His left arm was propped againsthis chest on a wooden box that served as a low table. His eyes were closed buthis eyeballs moved. I felt he was looking at me through his closed eyelids. Thethought scared me.\"Tell me more about what my friend should do with his little boy,\" I said.\"Tell him to go to skid row and very carefully select an ugly-looking derelict,\"he went on. \"Tell him to get a young one; one who still has some strength leftin him.\"Don Juan then delineated a strange strategy. I was to instruct my friend to havethe man follow him or wait for him at a place where my friend would go with hisson. The man, in response to a prearranged cue to be given after anyobjectionable behaviour on the part of the child, was supposed to leap from ahiding place, pick the child up, and spank the living daylights out of him.\"After the man scares him, your friend must help the little boy regain hisconfidence, in any way he can. If he follows this procedure three or four times,I assure you that that child will feel differently towards everything. He willchange his idea of the world.\"\"What if the fright injures him?\"\"Fright never injures anyone. What injures the spirit is having someone alwayson your back, beating you, telling you what to do and what not to do.\"When that boy is more contained you must tell your friend to do one last thingfor him. He must find some way to get to a dead child, perhaps in a hospital, orat the office of a doctor. He must take his son there and show the dead child tohim. He must let him touch the corpse once with his left hand, on any placeexcept the corpse's belly. After the boy does that he will be renewed. The worldwill never be the same for him.\" I realized then that throughout the years of our association don Juan had beenemploying with me, although on a different scale, the same tactics he wassuggesting my friend should use with his son. I asked him about it. He said thathe had been trying all along to teach me how to 'stop the world'.\"You haven't yet,\" he said, smiling. \"Nothing seems to work, because you arevery stubborn. If you were less stubborn, however, by now you would probablyhave stopped the world with any of the techniques I have taught you.\"\"What techniques, don Juan?\"\"Everything I have told you to do was a technique for stopping the world.\"A few months after that conversation don Juan accomplished what he had set outto do. I stopped the world. HTML EDITOR:The events surrounding this accomplishment are described in Chapter 19,\"Stopping the World\".END HTML EDITOR That monumental event in my life compelled me to re-examine in detail my work often years. It became evident to me that my original assumption about the role ofpsychotropic plants was erroneous. They were not the essential feature of thesorcerer's description of the world, but were only an aid to cement, so tospeak, parts of the description which I had been incapable of perceivingotherwise. My insistence on holding on to my standard version of realityrendered me almost deaf and blind to don Juan's aims. Therefore, it was simplymy lack of sensitivity which had fostered their use.In reviewing the totality of my field notes I became aware that don Juan hadgiven me the bulk of the new description at the very beginning of ourassociation in what he called 'techniques for stopping the world'. I haddiscarded those parts of my field notes in my earlier works because they did notpertain to the use of psychotropic plants. I have now rightfully reinstated themin the total scope of don Juan's teachings and they comprise the first seventeenchapters of this work. The last three chapters are the field notes covering theevents that culminated in my 'stopping the world'.In summing up, I can say that when I began the apprenticeship there was anotherreality, that is to say, there was a sorcery description of the world which Idid not know.Don Juan, as a sorcerer and a teacher, taught me that description. The ten yearapprenticeship I have undergone consisted, therefore, in setting up that unknownreality by unfolding its description; adding increasingly more complex parts asI went along.The termination of the apprenticeship meant that I had learned a new descriptionof the world in a convincing and authentic manner; and thus I had become capableof eliciting a new perception of the world, which matched its new description.In other words, I had gained membership.Don Juan had stated that in order to arrive at seeing, one first had to stop theworld. Stopping the world was indeed an appropriate rendition of certain statesof awareness in which the reality of everyday life is altered because the flowof interpretation, which ordinarily runs uninterruptedly, has been stopped by aset of circumstances alien to that flow.In my case the set of circumstances alien to my normal flow of interpretationswas the sorcery description of the world. Don Juan's precondition for stoppingthe world was that one had to be convinced.In other words, one had to learn the new description in a total sense for thepurpose of pitting it against the old one, and in that way break the dogmaticcertainty which we all share; the certainty that the validity of ourperceptions, or our 'reality of the world' is not to be questioned.After stopping the world, the next step was seeing.Seeing, according to don Juan, meant what I would like to categorize asresponding to the perceptual solicitations of the world outside the descriptionwe have learned to call reality.My contention is that all these steps can only be understood in terms of thedescription to which they belong: And since it was a description that don Juanendeavoured to give me from the beginning, I must then let his teachings be theonly source of entrance into it. Thus, I have left don Juan's words to speak forthemselves. ================================================================ Part One - 'Stopping the World'"},{"pageContent":"1. Reaffirmations from the World Around Us \"I understand you know a great deal about plants, sir,\" I said to the old Indianin front of me.A friend of mine had just put us in contact and left the room, and we hadintroduced ourselves to each other. The old man had told me that his name wasJuan Matus.\"Did your friend tell you that?' he asked casually.\"Yes, he did.\"\"I pick plants, or rather, they let me pick them,\" he said softly.We were in the waiting room of a bus depot in Arizona. I asked him in veryformal Spanish if he would allow me to question him. I said, \"Would thegentleman [caballero] permit me to ask some questions?\"'Caballero', which is derived from the word 'caballo', horse, originally meanthorseman or a nobleman on horseback.He looked at me inquisitively.\"I'm a horseman without a horse,\" he said with a big smile and then he added,\"I've told you that my name is Juan Matus.\"I liked his smile. I thought that, obviously, he was a man that could appreciatedirectness, and I decided to boldly tackle him with a request.I told him I was interested in collecting and studying medicinal plants. I saidthat my special interest was the uses of the hallucinogenic cactus, peyote,which I had studied at length at the university in Los Angeles.I thought that my presentation was very serious. I was very contained, andsounded perfectly credible to myself.The old man shook his head slowly, and I, encouraged by his silence, added thatit would no doubt be profitable for us to get together and talk about peyote.It was at that moment that he lifted his head and looked me squarely in theeyes. It was a formidable look, yet it was not menacing or awesome in any way.It was a look that went through me. I became tongue-tied at once and could notcontinue with the harangues [* harangue- a loud bombastic declamation expressedwith strong emotion] about myself.That was the end of our meeting. Yet he left me on a note of hope. He said thatperhaps I could visit him at his house someday. It would be difficult to assess the impact of don Juan's look if my inventory ofexperience is not somehow brought to bear on the uniqueness of that event.When I began to study anthropology, and thus met don Juan, I was already anexpert in 'getting around'. I had left my home years before; and that meant, inmy evaluation, that I was capable of taking care of myself. Whenever I wasrebuffed, I could usually: cajole my way in, make concessions, argue, get angry,or if nothing succeeded, I would whine or complain.In other words, there was always something I knew I could do under thecircumstances. Never in my life had any human being stopped my momentum soswiftly and so definitely as don Juan did that afternoon. But it was not only amatter of being silenced. There had been times when I had been unable to say aword to my opponent because of some inherent respect I felt for him, but stillmy anger or frustration was manifested in my thoughts. Don Juan's look, however,numbed me to the point that I could not think coherently.I became thoroughly intrigued with that stupendous look and decided to searchfor him.I prepared myself for six months after that first meeting. I read up on the usesof peyote among the American Indians, especially about the peyote cult of theIndians of the Plains. I became acquainted with every work available, and when Ifelt I was ready I went back to Arizona. Saturday, 1960 December 17 I found don Juan's house after making long and taxing inquiries among the localIndians. It was early afternoon when I arrived and parked in front of it. I sawhim sitting on a wooden milk crate. He seemed to recognize me, and greeted me asI got out of my car.We exchanged social courtesies for a while, and then in plain terms, I confessedthat I had been very devious with him the first time we had met. I said I hadboasted that I knew a great deal about peyote, when in reality, I knew nothingabout it. He stared at me. His eyes were very kind.I told him that for six months I had been reading to prepare myself for ourmeeting; and that this time I really knew a great deal more.He laughed. Obviously there was something in my statement which was funny tohim. He was laughing at me and I felt a bit confused and offended.He apparently noticed my discomfort; and assured me that, although I had hadgood intentions, there was really no way to prepare myself for our meeting.I wondered if it would have been proper to ask whether that statement had anyhidden meaning, but I did not; yet he seemed to be attuned to my feelings andproceeded to explain what he had meant.He said that my endeavours reminded him of a story about some people a certainking had persecuted and killed once upon a time. He said that, in the story, the persecuted people were indistinguishable fromtheir persecutors except that they insisted on pronouncing certain words in apeculiar manner proper only to them. That flaw, of course, was the giveaway.The king posted roadblocks at critical points where an official would ask everyman passing by to pronounce a key word. Those who could pronounce it the way theking pronounced it would live, but those who could not were immediately put todeath.The point of the story was that one day a young man decided to prepare himselffor passing the roadblock by learning to pronounce the test-word just as theking liked it.Don Juan said, with a broad smile, that in fact it took the young man 'sixmonths' to master such a pronunciation. And then came the day of the great test.The young man very confidently came upon the roadblock and waited for theofficial to ask him to pronounce the word.At that point don Juan very dramatically stopped his recounting and looked atme. His pause was very studied and seemed a bit corny to me, but I played along.I had heard the theme of the story before. It had to do with Jews in Germany andthe way one could tell who was a Jew by the way they pronounced certain words. Ialso knew the punch line. The young man was going to get caught because theofficial had forgotten the key word and asked him to pronounce another wordwhich was very similar, but which the young man had not learned to saycorrectly.Don Juan seemed to be waiting for me to ask what happened, so I did.\"What happened to him?\" I asked, trying to sound naive and interested in thestory.\"The young man, who was truly foxy,\" he said, \"realized that the official hadforgotten the key word, and before the man could say anything else the young manconfessed that he had prepared himself for six months.\"Don Juan made another pause, and looked at me with a mischievous glint in hiseyes. This time he had turned the tables on me. The young man's confession was anew element and I no longer knew how the story would end.\"Well, what happened then?\" I asked, truly interested.\"The young man was killed instantly, of course,\" he said and broke into aroaring laughter. I liked very much the way he had entrapped my interest; and above all I likedthe way he had linked that story to my own case. In fact, he seemed to haveconstructed it to fit me. He was making fun of me in a very subtle and artisticmanner. I laughed with him.Afterwards, I told him that no matter how stupid I sounded, I was reallyinterested in learning something about plants.\"I like to walk a great deal,\" he said.I thought he was deliberately changing the topic of conversation to avoidanswering me. I did not want to antagonize him with my insistence. He asked meif I wanted to go with him on a short hike in the desert. I eagerly told himthat I would love to walk in the desert.\"This is no picnic,\" he said in a tone of warning.I told him that I wanted very seriously to work with him. I said that I neededinformation, any kind of information, on the uses of medicinal herbs, and that Iwas willing to pay him for his time and effort.\"You'll be working for me,\" I said. \"And I'll pay you wages.\"\"How much would you pay me?\" he asked.I detected a note of greed in his voice.\"Whatever you think is appropriate,\" I said.\"Pay me for my time... with your time,\" he said.I thought he was a most peculiar fellow. I told him I did not understand what hemeant. He replied that there was nothing to say about plants, thus to take mymoney would be unthinkable for him.He looked at me piercingly.\"What are you doing in your pocket?\" he asked, frowning. \"Are you playing withyour whanger?\"He was referring to my taking notes on a minute pad inside the enormous pocketsof my windbreaker.When I told him what I was doing he laughed heartily.I said that I did not want to disturb him by writing in front of him.\"If you want to write, write,\" he said. \"You don't disturb me.\" We hiked in the surrounding desert until it was almost dark. He did not show meany plants, nor did he talk about them at all. We stopped for a moment to restby some large bushes.\"Plants are very peculiar things,\" he said without looking at me.\" They arealive and they feel.\"At the very moment he made that statement a strong gust of wind shook the desertchaparral around us. The bushes made a rattling noise.\"Do you hear that?\" he asked me, putting his right hand to his ear as if he wereaiding his hearing. \"The leaves and the wind are agreeing with me.\"I laughed. The friend who had put us in contact had already told me to watch outbecause the old man was very eccentric. I thought the 'agreement with theleaves' was one of his eccentricities.We walked for a while longer, but he still did not show me any plants; nor didhe pick any of them. He simply breezed through the bushes touching them gently.Then he came to a halt, and sat down on a rock. He told me to rest and lookaround.I insisted on talking. Once more I let him know that I wanted very much to learnabout plants, especially peyote. I pleaded with him to become my informant inexchange for some sort of monetary reward.\"You don't have to pay me,\" he said. \"You can ask me anything you want. I willtell you what I know and then I will tell you what to do with it.\"He asked me if I agreed with the arrangement. I was delighted. Then he added acryptic statement: \"Perhaps there is nothing to learn about plants, becausethere is nothing to say about them.\"I did not understand what he had said or what he had meant by it.\"What did you say?\" I asked.He repeated the statement three times; and then the whole area was shaken by theroar of an Air Force jet flying low.\"There! The world has just agreed with me,\" he said, putting his left hand tohis ear.I found him very amusing. His laughter was contagious.\"Are you from Arizona, don Juan?\" I asked, in an effort to keep the conversationcentred around his being my informant. He looked at me and nodded affirmatively.His eyes seemed to be tired. I could see the white underneath his pupils. \"Wereyou born in this locality?\"He nodded his head again without answering me. It seemed to be an affirmativegesture, but it also seemed to be the nervous headshake of a person who isthinking.\"And where are you from yourself?\" he asked.\"I come from South America,\" I said.\"That's a big place. Do you come from all of it?\"His eyes were piercing again as he looked at me.I began to explain the circumstances of my birth, but he interrupted me.\"We are alike in this respect,\" he said. \"I live here now but I'm really a Yaquifrom Sonora.\"\"Is that so! I myself come from-\"He did not let me finish.\"I know, I know,\" he said. \"You are who you are, from wherever you are, as I ama Yaqui from Sonora.\"His eyes were very shiny and his laughter was strangely unsettling. He made mefeel as if he had caught me in a lie. I experienced a peculiar sensation ofguilt. I had the feeling he knew something that I did not know, or that I didnot want to tell.My strange embarrassment grew. He must have noticed it, for he stood up, andasked me if I wanted to go eat in a restaurant in town. Walking back to his home, and then driving into town made me feel better; but Iwas not quite relaxed. I somehow felt threatened, although I could not pinpointthe reason.I wanted to buy him some beer in the restaurant. He said that he never drank,not even beer. I laughed to myself: I did not believe him. The friend who hadput us in contact had told me that \"the old man was plastered out of his mindmost of the time\". I really did not mind if he was lying to me about notdrinking. I liked him. There was something very soothing about his person.I must have had a look of doubt on my face, for he then went on to explain thathe used to drink in his youth, but that one day he simply dropped it.\"People hardly ever realize that we can cut anything from our lives, any time,just like that.\" He snapped his fingers.\"Do you think that one can stop smoking or drinking that easily?\" I asked.\"Sure!\" he said with great conviction. \"Smoking and drinking are nothing.Nothing at all if we want to drop them.\"At that very moment the water that was boiling in the coffee percolator made aloud perking sound.\"Hear that!\" don Juan exclaimed with a shine in his eyes. \"The boiling wateragrees with me.\"Then he added after a pause, \"A man can get agreements from everything aroundhim.\"At that crucial instant the coffee percolator made a truly obscene gurglingsound.He looked at the percolator and softly said, \"Thank you,\" nodded his head, andthen broke into a roaring laughter.I was taken aback. His laughter was a bit too loud, but I was genuinely amusedby it all. My first real session with my 'informant' ended then. He said good-bye at thedoor of the restaurant. I told him I had to visit some friends and that I wouldlike to see him again at the end of the following week.\"When will you be home?\" I asked.He scrutinized me.\"Whenever you come,\" he replied.\"I don't know exactly when I can come.\"\"Just come then and don't worry.\"\"What if you're not in?\"\"I'll be there,\" he said, smiling, and walked away.I ran after him and asked him if he would mind my bringing a camera with me totake pictures of him and his house.\"That's out of the question,\" he said with a frown.\"How about a tape recorder? Would you mind that?\"\"I'm afraid there's no possibility of that either.\"I became annoyed and began to fret. I said I saw no logical reason for hisrefusal.Don Juan shook his head negatively.\"Forget it,\" he said forcefully. \"And if you still want to see me, don't evermention it again.\"I staged a weak final complaint. I said that pictures and recordings wereindispensable to my work. He said that there was only one thing which wasindispensable for anything we did. He called it 'the spirit'.\"One can't do without the spirit,\" he said. \"And you don't have it. Worry aboutthat and not about pictures.\"\"What do you...?\"He interrupted me with a movement of his hand, and walked backwards a few steps.\"Be sure to come back,\" he said softly, and waved good-bye. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"2. Erasing Personal History Thursday, 1960 December 22 Don Juan was sitting on the floor by the door of his house with his back againstthe wall. He turned over a wooden milk crate, and asked me to sit down and makemyself at home. I offered him some cigarettes. I had brought a carton of them.He said he did not smoke, but he accepted the gift. We talked about the coldnessof the desert nights and other ordinary topics of conversation.I asked him if I was interfering with his normal routine. He looked at me with asort of frown. He said he had no routines, and that I could stay with him allafternoon if I wanted to.I had prepared some genealogy and kinship charts that I wanted to fill out withhis help.I had also compiled from ethnographic literature a long list of culture traitsthat were purported to belong to the Indians of the area. I wanted to go throughthe list with him, and mark all the items that were familiar to him.I began with the kinship charts.\"What did you call your father?\" I asked.\"I called him Dad,\" he said with a very serious face.I felt a little bit annoyed, but I proceeded on the assumption that he had notunderstood.I showed him the chart, and explained that one space was for the father, andanother space was for the mother. I gave as an example the different words usedin English and in Spanish for father and mother.I thought that perhaps I should have taken mother first.\"What did you call your mother?\" I asked.\"I called her Mom,\" he replied in a naive tone.\"I mean what other words did you use to call your father and mother? How did youcall them?\" I said, trying to be patient and polite.He scratched his head, and looked at me with a stupid expression.\"Golly!\" he said. \"You got me there. Let me think.\"After a moment's hesitation he seemed to remember something and I got ready towrite.\"Well,\" he said, as if he were involved in serious thought, \"how else did I callthem? I called them 'Hey, hey, Dad! Hey, hey, Mom!'\"I laughed against my desire. His expression was truly comical, and at thatmoment I did not know whether he was a preposterous old man pulling my leg, orwhether he was really a simpleton. Using all the patience I had, I explained tohim that these were very serious questions, and that it was very important formy work to fill out the forms. I tried to make him understand the idea of agenealogy and personal history.\"What were the names of your father and mother?\" I asked.He looked at me with clear kind eyes.\"Don't waste your time with that crap,\" he said softly but with unsuspectedforce. I did not know what to say; it was as if someone else had uttered those words. Amoment before, he had been a fumbling stupid Indian scratching his head; andthen in an instant he had reversed the roles: I was the stupid one, and he wasstaring at me with an indescribable look that was not a look of arrogance, ordefiance, or hatred, or contempt. His eyes were kind and clear and penetrating.\"I don't have any personal history,\" he said after a long pause. \"One day Ifound out that personal history was no longer necessary for me, and, likedrinking, I dropped it.\"I did not quite understand what he meant by that. I suddenly felt ill at ease;threatened. I reminded him that he had assured me that it was all right to askhim questions. He reiterated that he did not mind at all.\"I don't have personal history any more,\" he said, and looked at me probingly.\"I dropped it one day when I felt it was no longer necessary.\"I stared at him, trying to detect the hidden meanings of his words.\"How can one drop one's personal history?\" I asked in an argumentative mood.\"One must first have the desire to drop it,\" he said. \"And then one must proceedharmoniously to chop it off, little by little.\"\"Why should anyone have such a desire?\" I exclaimed.I had a terribly strong attachment to my personal history. My family roots weredeep. I honestly felt that without them my life had no continuity or purpose.\"Perhaps you should tell me what you mean by dropping one's personal history,\" Isaid.\"To do away with it, that's what I mean,\" he replied cuttingly.I insisted that I must not have understood the proposition.\"Take you for instance,\" I said. \"You are a Yaqui. You can't change that.\"\"Am I?\" he asked, smiling. \"How do you know that?\"\"True!\" I said. \"I can't know that with certainty, at this point, but you knowit and that is what counts. That's what makes it personal history.\"I felt I had driven a hard nail in.\"The fact that I know whether I am a Yaqui or not,\" he replied, \"does not makeit personal history. Only when someone else knows it does it become personalhistory; and I assure you that no one will ever know that for sure.\" I had written down what he had said in a clumsy way. I stopped writing andlooked at him. I could not figure him out. I mentally ran through my impressionsof him: the mysterious and unprecedented way he had looked at me during ourfirst meeting; the charm with which he had claimed that he received agreementfrom everything around him; his annoying humour and his alertness; his look ofbona fide stupidity when I asked about his father and mother; and then theunsuspected force of his statements which had snapped me apart.\"You don't know what I am, do you?\" he said as if he were reading my thoughts.\"You will never know who or what I am, because I don't have a personal history.\"He asked me if I had a father. I told him I did. He said that my father was anexample of what he had in mind. He urged me to remember what my father thoughtof me.\"Your father knows everything about you,\" he said. \"So he has you all figuredout. He knows who you are and what you do, and there is no power on earth thatcan make him change his mind about you.\"Don Juan said that everybody that knew me had an idea about me, and that I keptfeeding that idea with everything I did.\"Don't you see?\" he asked dramatically. \"You must renew your personal history bytelling your parents, your relatives, and your friends everything you do. On theother hand, if you have no personal history, no explanations are needed. Nobodyis angry or disillusioned with your acts. And above all, no one pins you downwith their thoughts.\"Suddenly the idea became clear in my mind. I had almost known it myself, but Ihad never examined it. Not having personal history was indeed an appealingconcept- at least on the intellectual level.It gave me, however, a sense of loneliness which I found threatening anddistasteful. I wanted to discuss my feelings with him, but I kept myself incheck. Something was terribly incongruous in the situation at hand. I feltridiculous trying to get into a philosophical argument with an old Indian whoobviously did not have the 'sophistication' of a university student. Somehow hehad led me away from my original intention of asking him about his genealogy.\"I don't know how we ended up talking about this when all I wanted was somenames for my charts,\" I said, trying to steer the conversation back to the topicI wanted.\"It's terribly simple,\" he said. \"The way we ended up talking about it wasbecause I said that to ask questions about one's past is a bunch of crap.\"His tone was firm. I felt there was no way to make him budge, so I changed mytactics.\"Is this idea of not having personal history something that the Yaquis do?\" Iasked.\"It's something that I do.\"\"Where did you learn it?\"\"I learned it during the course of my life.\"\"Did your father teach you that?\"\"No. Let's say that I learned it by myself, and now I am going to give you itssecret so you won't go away empty-handed today.\"He lowered his voice to a dramatic whisper. I laughed at his histrionics. I hadto admit that he was stupendous at that. The thought crossed my mind that I wasin the presence of a born actor.\"Write it down,\" he said patronizingly. \"Why not? You seem to be morecomfortable writing.\"I looked at him, and my eyes must have betrayed my confusion. He slapped histhighs, and laughed with great delight.\"It is best to erase all personal history,\" he said slowly, as if giving me timeto write it down in my clumsy way, \"because that would make us free from theencumbering thoughts of other people.\"I could not believe that he was actually saying that. I had a very confusingmoment. He must have read in my face my inner turmoil and used it immediately.\"Take yourself, for instance,\" he went on saying. \"Right now you don't knowwhether you are coming or going. And that is so because I have erased mypersonal history. I have, little by little, created a fog around me and my life.And now nobody knows for sure who I am or what I do.\"\"But you yourself know who you are, don't you?\" I interjected.\"You bet I... don't,\" he exclaimed, and rolled on the floor, laughing at mysurprised look.He had paused long enough to make me believe that he was going to say that hedid know, as I was anticipating it. His subterfuge [* subterfuge- somethingintended to misrepresent the true nature of an activity] was very threatening tome. I actually became afraid.\"That is the little secret I am going to give you today,\" he said in a lowvoice. \"Nobody knows my personal history. Nobody knows who I am or what I do.Not even I.\" He squinted his eyes. He was not looking at me but beyond me over my rightshoulder. He was sitting cross-legged. His back was straight, and yet he seemedto be so relaxed.At that moment he was the very picture of fierceness. I fancied him to be anIndian chief; a 'red-skinned warrior' in the romantic frontier sagas of mychildhood. My romanticism carried me away, and the most insidious feeling ofambivalence [* ambivalence- mixed feelings or emotions] enveloped me. I couldsincerely say that I liked him a great deal, and in the same breath I could saythat I was deadly afraid of him.He maintained that strange stare for a long moment.\"How can I know who I am, when I am all this?\" he said, sweeping thesurroundings with a gesture of his head.Then he glanced at me and smiled.\"Little by little you must create a fog around yourself. You must eraseeverything around you until nothing can be taken for granted; until nothing isany longer for sure, or real.\"Your problem now is that you're too real. Your endeavours are too real. Yourmoods are too real. Don't take things so for granted. You must begin to eraseyourself.\"\"What for?\" I asked belligerently.It became clear to me then that he was prescribing behaviour for me. All my lifeI had reached a breaking point when someone attempted to tell me what to do. Themere thought of being told what to do put me immediately on the defensive.\"You said that you wanted to learn about plants,\" he said calmly. \"Do you wantto get something for nothing? What do you think this is? We agreed that youwould ask me questions, and I'd tell you what I know. If you don't like it,there is nothing else we can say to each other.\"His terrible directness made me feel peeved; and begrudgingly I conceded that hewas right.\"Let's put it this way then,\" he went on. \"If you want to learn about plants,since there is really nothing to say about them, you must, among other things,erase your personal history.\"\"How?\" I asked.\"Begin with simple things, such as not revealing what you really do. Then youmust leave everyone who knows you well. This way you'll build up a fog aroundyourself.\"\"But that's absurd,\" I protested. \"Why shouldn't people know me? What's wrongwith that?\"\"What's wrong is that once they know you, you are an affair taken for granted,and from that moment on you won't be able to break the tie of their thoughts. Ipersonally like the ultimate freedom of being unknown. No one knows me withsteadfast certainty- the way people know you, for instance.\"\"But that would be lying.\"\"I'm not concerned with lies or truths,\" he said severely. \"Lies are lies onlyif you have personal history.\"I argued that I did not like to deliberately mystify people or mislead them. Hisreply was that I misled everybody anyway.The old man had touched a sore spot in my life. I did not pause to ask him whathe meant by that, or how he knew that I mystified people all the time. I simplyreacted to his statement; defending myself by means of an explanation. I saidthat I was painfully aware that my family and my friends believed I wasunreliable, when in reality I had never told a lie in my life.\"You always knew how to lie,\" he said. \"The only thing that was missing was thatyou didn't know why to do it. Now you do.\"I protested.\"Don't you see that I'm really sick and tired of people thinking that I'munreliable?\" I said.\"But you are unreliable,\" he replied with conviction.\"Damn it to hell, man, I am not!\" I exclaimed.My mood, instead of forcing him into seriousness, made him laugh hysterically. Ireally despised the old man for all his cockiness. Unfortunately he was rightabout me. After a while I calmed down and he continued talking.\"When one does not have personal history,\" he explained, \"nothing that one sayscan be taken for a lie. Your trouble is that you have to explain everything toeverybody, compulsively, and at the same time you want to keep the freshness,the newness of what you do. Well, since you can't be excited after explainingeverything you've done, you lie in order to keep on going.\"I was truly bewildered by the scope of our conversation. I wrote down all thedetails of our exchange in the best way I could, concentrating on what he wassaying rather than pausing to deliberate on my prejudices or on his meanings.\"From now on,\" he said, \"you must simply show people whatever you care to showthem, but without ever telling exactly how you've done it.\"\"I can't keep secrets!\" I exclaimed. \"What you are saying is useless to me.\"\"Then change!\" he said cuttingly and with a fierce glint in his eyes.He looked like a strange wild animal. And yet he was so coherent in his thoughtsand so verbal. My annoyance gave way to a state of irritating confusion.\"You see,\" he went on, \"we only have two alternatives: We either take everythingfor sure and real, or we don't. If we follow the first, we end up bored to deathwith ourselves and with the world. If we follow the second, and erase personalhistory, we create a fog around us; a very exciting and mysterious state inwhich nobody knows where the rabbit will pop out- not even ourselves.\"I contended that erasing personal history would only increase our sensation ofinsecurity.\"When nothing is for sure we remain alert; perennially on our toes,\" he said.\"It is more exciting not to know which bush the rabbit is hiding behind than tobehave as though we know everything.\" He did not say another word for a very long time; perhaps an hour went by incomplete silence. I did not know what to ask. Finally he got up, and asked me todrive him to the nearby town.I did not know why but our conversation had drained me. I felt like going tosleep. He asked me to stop on the way, and told me that if I wanted to relax Ihad to climb to the flat top of a small hill on the side of the road, and liedown on my stomach with my head towards the east.He seemed to have a feeling of urgency. I did not want to argue; or perhaps Iwas too tired to even speak. I climbed the hill, and did as he had prescribed.I slept only two or three minutes, but it was sufficient to have my energyrenewed.We drove to the centre of town where he told me to let him off.\"Come back,\" he said as he stepped out of the car. \"Be sure to come back.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"3. Losing Self-importance I had the opportunity of discussing my two previous visits to don Juan with thefriend who had put us in contact. It was his opinion that I was wasting my time.I related to him, in every detail, the scope of our conversations. He thought Iwas exaggerating and romanticizing a silly old fogey.There was very little room in me for romanticizing such a preposterous old man.I sincerely felt that his criticisms about my personality had seriouslyundermined my liking him. Yet I had to admit that they had always been apropos,[* apropos- of an appropriate or pertinent nature] sharply delineated, and trueto the letter.The crux of my dilemma at that point was my unwillingness to accept that donJuan was very capable of disrupting all my preconceptions about the world; andmy unwillingness to agree with my friend who believed that \"the old Indian wasjust nuts\".I felt compelled to pay him another visit before I made up my mind. Wednesday, 1960 December 28 Immediately after I arrived at his house don Juan took me for a walk in thedesert chaparral. He did not even look at the bag of groceries that I hadbrought him. He seemed to have been waiting for me.We walked for hours. He did not collect or show me any plants. He did, however,teach me an 'appropriate form of walking'. He said that I had to curl my fingersgently as I walked so I would keep my attention on the trail and thesurroundings.He claimed that my ordinary way of walking was debilitating, and that one shouldnever carry anything in the hands. If things had to be carried, one should use aknapsack or any sort of carrying net or shoulder bag. His idea was that byforcing the hands into a specific position, one was capable of greater staminaand greater awareness.I saw no point in arguing and curled my fingers as he had prescribed, and kepton walking. My awareness was in no way different, nor was my stamina.We had started our hike in the morning and we stopped to rest around noon. I wasperspiring and tried to drink from my canteen, but he stopped me by saying thatit was better to have only a sip of water.He cut some leaves from a small yellowish bush, chewed them, and then gave mesome. He remarked that they were excellent, and that if I chewed them slowly mythirst would vanish. It did not, but I was not uncomfortable either.He seemed to have read my thoughts and explained that I had not felt thebenefits of the 'right way of walking' or the benefits of chewing the leavesbecause I was young and strong; and my body did not notice anything because itwas a bit stupid.He laughed. I was not in a laughing mood and that seemed to amuse him even more.He corrected his previous statement, saying that my body was not really stupid,but somehow dormant.At that moment an enormous crow flew right over us, cawing. That startled me andI began to laugh. I thought that the occasion called for laughter, but to myutter amazement he shook my arm vigorously and hushed me up. He had a mostserious expression.\"That was not a joke,\" he said severely, as if I knew what he was talking about.I asked for an explanation. I told him that it was incongruous that my laughingat the crow had made him angry when we had laughed at the coffee percolator.\"What you saw was not just a crow\", he exclaimed.\"But I saw it and it was a crow,\" I insisted.\"You saw nothing, you fool,\" he said in a gruff voice.His rudeness was uncalled for. I told him that I did not like to make peopleangry, and that perhaps it would be better if I left since he did not seem to bein a mood to have company.He laughed uproariously as if I were a clown performing for him. My annoyanceand embarrassment grew in proportion.\"You're very violent,\" he commented casually. \"You're taking yourself tooseriously.\"\"But weren't you doing the same?\" I interjected. \"Taking yourself seriously whenyou got angry at me?\"He said that to get angry at me was the farthest thing from his mind. He lookedat me piercingly.\"What you saw was not an agreement from the world,\" he said. \"Crows flying orcawing are never an agreement. That was an omen!\"\"An omen of what?\"\"A very important indication about you,\" he replied cryptically.At that very instant the wind blew the dry branch of a bush right to our feet.\"That was an agreement!\" he exclaimed and looked at me with shiny eyes, andbroke into a belly laugh.I had the feeling that he was teasing me by making up the rules of his strangegame as we went along. Thus it was all right for him to laugh, but not for me.My annoyance mushroomed again and I told him what I thought of him.He was not cross or offended at all. He laughed and his laughter caused me evenmore anguish and frustration. I thought that he was deliberately humiliating me.I decided right then that I had had my fill of 'field work'.I stood up and said that I wanted to start walking back to his house because Ihad to leave for Los Angeles.\"Sit down!\" he said imperatively. \"You get peeved like an old lady. You cannotleave now, because we're not through yet.\"I hated him. I thought he was a contemptuous man.He began to sing an idiotic Mexican folk song. He was obviously imitating somepopular singer. He elongated certain syllables and contracted others and madethe song into a most farcical affair. It was so comical that I ended uplaughing.\"You see, you laugh at the stupid song,\" he said. \"But the man who sings it thatway and those who pay to listen to him are not laughing. They think it isserious.\"\"What do you mean?\" I asked.I thought he had deliberately concocted the example to tell me that I hadlaughed at the crow because I had not taken it seriously, the same way I had nottaken the song seriously. But he baffled me again. He said I was like the singerand the people who liked his songs; conceited and deadly serious about somenonsense that no one in his right mind should give a damn about.He then recapitulated, [* recapitulated- summarized briefly] as if to refresh mymemory, all he had said before on the topic of 'learning about plants'. Hestressed emphatically that if I really wanted to learn, I had to remodel most ofmy behaviour.My sense of annoyance grew, until I had to make a supreme effort to even takenotes.\"You take yourself too seriously,\" he said slowly. \"You are too damn importantin your own mind. That must be changed! You are so goddamn important that youfeel justified to be annoyed with everything. You're so damn important that youcan afford to leave if things don't go your way. I suppose you think that showsyou have character. That's nonsense! You're weak, and conceited!\"I tried to stage a protest, but he did not budge. He pointed out that in thecourse of my life I had not ever finished anything because of that sense ofdisproportionate importance that I attached to myself.I was flabbergasted at the certainty with which he made his statements. Theywere true, of course, and that made me feel not only angry, but also threatened.\"Self-importance is another thing that must be dropped, just like personalhistory,\" he said in a dramatic tone.I certainly did not want to argue with him. It was obvious that I was at aterrible disadvantage: He was not going to walk back to his house until he wasready and I did not know the way. I had to stay with him. He made a strange and sudden movement: He sort of sniffed the air around him.His head shook slightly and rhythmically. He seemed to be in a state of unusualalertness. He turned and stared at me with a look of bewilderment and curiosity.His eyes swept up and down my body as if he were looking for something specific.Then he stood up abruptly and began to walk fast. He was almost running. Ifollowed him. He kept a very accelerated pace for nearly an hour. Finally he stopped by a rocky hill and we sat in the shade of a bush. Thetrotting had exhausted me completely, although my mood was better. It wasstrange the way I had changed. I felt almost elated; but when we had started totrot after our argument, I was furious with him.\"This is very weird,\" I said, \"but I feel really good.\"I heard the cawing of a crow in the distance. He lifted his finger to his rightear and smiled.\"That was an omen,\" he said.A small rock tumbled downhill, and made a crashing sound when it landed in thechaparral.He laughed out loud, and pointed his finger in the direction of the sound.\"And that was an agreement,\" he said.He then asked me if I was ready to talk about my self-importance. I laughed. Myfeeling of anger seemed so far away that I could not even conceive how I hadbecome so cross with him.\"I can't understand what's happening to me,\" I said. \"I got angry and now Idon't know why I am not angry any more.\"\"The world around us is very mysterious,\" he said. \"It doesn't yield its secretseasily.\"I liked his cryptic statements. They were challenging and mysterious. I couldnot determine whether they were filled with hidden meanings, or whether theywere just plain nonsense.\"If you ever come back to the desert here,\" he said, \"stay away from that rockyhill where we stopped today. Avoid it like the plague.\"\"Why? What's the matter?\"\"This is not the time to explain it,\" he said. \"Now we are concerned with losingself-importance. As long as you feel that you are the most important thing inthe world, you cannot really appreciate the world around you. You are like ahorse with blinders: all you see is yourself apart from everything else.\" He examined me for a moment.\"I am going to talk to my little friend here,\" he said, pointing to a smallplant.He knelt in front of it, and began to caress it and to talk to it. I did notunderstand what he was saying at first, but then he switched languages andtalked to the plant in Spanish. He babbled inanities for a while. Then he stoodup.\"It doesn't matter what you say to a plant,\" he said. \"You can just as well makeup words. What's important is the feeling of liking it, and treating it as anequal.\"He explained that a man who gathers plants must apologize every time for takingthem, and must assure them that someday his own body will serve as food forthem.\"So, all in all, the plant and ourselves are even,\" he said. \"Neither we northey are more or less important.\"Come on, talk to the little plant,\" he urged me. \"Tell it that you don't feelimportant any more.\"I went as far as kneeling in front of the plant, but I could not bring myself tospeak to it. I felt ridiculous and laughed. I was not angry, however.Don Juan patted me on the back, and said that it was all right; that at least Ihad contained my temper.\"From now on talk to the little plants,\" he said. \"Talk until you lose all senseof importance. Talk to them until you can do it in front of others.\"Go to those hills over there and practise by yourself.\"I asked if it was all right to talk to the plants silently in my mind.He laughed and tapped my head.\"No!\" he said. \"You must talk to them in a loud and clear voice if you want themto answer you.\" I walked to the area in question; laughing to myself about his eccentricities. Ieven tried to talk to the plants, but my feeling of being ludicrous wasoverpowering. After what I thought was an appropriate wait, I went back to wheredon Juan was. I had the certainty that he knew I had not talked to the plants.He did not look at me. He signalled me to sit down by him.\"Watch me carefully,\" he said. \"I'm going to have a talk with my little friend.\"He knelt down in front of a small plant, and for a few minutes he moved andcontorted his body; talking and laughing.I thought he was out of his mind.\"This little plant told me to tell you that she is good to eat,\" he said as hegot up from his kneeling position. \"She said that a handful of them would keep aman healthy. She also said that there is a batch of them growing over there.\"Don Juan pointed to an area on a hillside perhaps two hundred yards away.\"Let's go and find out,\" he said.I laughed at his histrionics. I was sure we would find the plants because he wasan expert in the terrain, and knew where the edible and medicinal plants were. As we walked towards the area in question he told me casually that I should takenotice of the plant because it was both a food and a medicine.I asked him, half in jest, if the plant had just told him that. He stoppedwalking and examined me with an air of disbelief. He shook his head from side toside.\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, laughing. \"Your cleverness makes you more silly than Ithought. How can the little plant tell me now what I've known all my life?\"He proceeded then to explain that he knew all along the different properties ofthat specific plant; that the plant had just told him that there was a batch ofthem growing in the area he had pointed to; and that she did not mind if he toldme that.Upon arriving at the hillside, I found a whole cluster of the same plants. Iwanted to laugh but he did not give me time. He wanted me to thank the batch ofplants. I felt excruciatingly self-conscious and could not bring myself to doit.He smiled benevolently and made another of his cryptic statements. He repeatedit three or four times as if to give me time to figure out its meaning.\"The world around us is a mystery,\" he said. \"And men are no better thananything else. If a little plant is generous with us, we must thank her, orperhaps she will not let us go.\"The way he looked at me when he said that gave me a chill. I hurriedly leanedover the plants and said, \"Thank you,\" in a loud voice.He began to laugh in controlled and quiet spurts. We walked for another hour, and then started on our way back to his house. At acertain time I dropped behind and he had to wait for me. He checked my fingersto see if I had curled them. I had not. He told me imperatively that whenever Iwalked with him I had to observe and copy his mannerisms or not come along atall.\"I can't be waiting for you as though you're a child,\" he said in a scoldingtone.That statement sunk me into the depths of embarrassment and bewilderment. Howcould it be possible that such an old man could walk so much better than I? Ithought I was athletic and strong, and yet he had actually had to wait for me tocatch up with him.I curled my fingers, and strangely enough I was able to keep his tremendous pacewithout any effort. In fact, at times I felt that my hands were pulling meforward.I felt elated. I was quite happy walking inanely with the strange old Indian. Ibegan to talk and asked repeatedly if he would show me some peyote plants. Helooked at me but did not say a word. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"4. Death Is an Adviser Wednesday, 1961 January 25 \"Would you teach me someday about peyote?\" I asked.He did not answer and, as he had done before, simply looked at me as if I werecrazy.I had mentioned the topic to him in casual conversation various times already,and every time he frowned and shook his head. It was not an affirmative or anegative gesture: It was rather a gesture of despair and disbelief.He stood up abruptly. We had been sitting on the ground in front of his house.An almost imperceptible shake of his head was the invitation to follow him.We went into the desert chaparral in a southerly direction. He mentionedrepeatedly as we walked that I had to be aware of the uselessness of myself-importance and of my personal history.\"Your friends,\" he said, turning to me abruptly, \"those who have known you for along time, you must leave them quickly.\"I thought he was crazy and his insistence idiotic, but I did not say anything.He peered at me and began to laugh.After a long hike we came to a halt. I was about to sit down to rest, but hetold me to go some twenty yards away and talk to a batch of plants in a loud andclear voice. I felt ill at ease and apprehensive. His weird demands were morethan I could bear, and I told him once more that I could not speak to plantsbecause I felt ridiculous. His only comment was that my feeling ofself-importance was immense. He seemed to have made a sudden decision, and saidthat I should not try to talk to plants until I felt easy and natural about it.\"You want to learn about them and yet you don't want to do any work,\" he saidaccusingly. \"What are you trying to do?\"My explanation was that I wanted bona fide information about the uses of plants,thus I had asked him to be my informant. I had even offered to pay him for histime and trouble.\"You should take the money,\" I said. \"This way we both would feel better. Icould then ask you anything I want to because you would be working for me- and Iwould pay you for it. What do you think of that?\"He looked at me contemptuously, and made an obscene sound with his mouth bymaking his lower lip and his tongue vibrate by exhaling with great force.\"That's what I think of it,\" he said and laughed hysterically at the look ofutmost surprise that I must have had on my face. It was obvious to me that he was not a man I could easily contend with. In spiteof his age, he was ebullient [* ebullient- joyously unrestrained] andunbelievably strong. I had had the idea that, being so old, he could have beenthe perfect 'informant' for me. Old people, I had been led to believe, made thebest informants because they were too feeble to do anything else except talk.Don Juan, on the other hand, was a miserable subject. I felt he was unmanageableand dangerous. The friend who had introduced us was right. He was an eccentricold Indian. And although he was not plastered out of his mind most of the time,as my friend had told me, he was worse yet: he was crazy.I again felt the terrible doubt and apprehension I had experienced before. Ithought I had overcome that. In fact, I had had no trouble at all convincingmyself that I wanted to visit him again.The idea had crept into my mind, however, that perhaps I was a bit crazy myselfwhen I realized that I liked to be with him. His idea that my feeling ofself-importance was an obstacle had really made an impact on me.But all that was apparently only an intellectual exercise on my part. The momentI was confronted with his odd behaviour I began to experience apprehension and Iwanted to leave. I said that I believed we were so different that there was no possibility of ourgetting along.\"One of us has to change,\" he said, staring at the ground. \"And you know who.\" He began humming a Mexican folk song, and then lifted his head abruptly andlooked at me. His eyes were fierce and burning. I wanted to look away or closemy eyes, but to my utter amazement I could not break away from his gaze.He asked me to tell him what I had seen in his eyes. I said that I saw nothing,but he insisted that I had to voice what his eyes had made me feel aware of. Istruggled to make him understand that the only thing his eyes made me aware ofwas my embarrassment; and that the way he was looking at me was verydiscomforting.He did not let go. He kept a steady stare. It was not an outright menacing ormean look; it was rather a mysterious but unpleasant gaze.He asked me if he reminded me of a bird.\"A bird?\" I exclaimed.He giggled like a child and moved his eyes away from me.\"Yes,\" he said softly. \"A bird, a very funny bird!\"He locked his gaze on me again and commanded me to remember. He said with anextraordinary conviction that he 'knew' I had seen that look before.My feelings of the moment were that the old man provoked me, against my honestdesire, every time he opened his mouth. I stared back at him in obviousdefiance. Instead of getting angry he began to laugh. He slapped his thigh andyelled as if he were riding a wild horse. Then he became serious and told methat it was of utmost importance that I stop fighting him and remember thatfunny bird he was talking about.\"Look into my eyes,\" he said.His eyes were extraordinarily fierce. There was a feeling about them thatactually reminded me of something, but I was not sure what it was. I ponderedupon it for a moment and then I had a sudden realization: It was not the shapeof his eyes nor the shape of his head, but some cold fierceness in his gaze thathad reminded me of the look in the eyes of a falcon. At the very moment of thatrealization, he was looking at me askew, and for an instant my mind experienceda total chaos. I thought I had seen a falcon's features instead of don Juan's.The image was too fleeting and I was too upset to have paid more attention toit.In a very excited tone I told him that I could have sworn I had seen thefeatures of a falcon on his face. He had another attack of laughter. I have seen the look in the eyes of falcons. I used to hunt them when I was aboy, and in the opinion of my grandfather I was good. He had a Leghorn chickenfarm and falcons were a menace to his business. Shooting them was not onlyfunctional but also 'right'. I had forgotten until that moment that thefierceness of their eyes had haunted me for years, but it was so far in my pastthat I thought I had lost the memory of it. \"I used to hunt falcons,\" I said.\"I know it,\" don Juan replied matter-of-factly.His tone carried such a certainty that I began to laugh. I thought he was apreposterous fellow. He had the gall to sound as if he knew I had huntedfalcons. I felt supremely contemptuous of him.\"Why do you get so angry?\" he asked in a tone of genuine concern.I did not know why. He began to probe me in a very unusual manner. He asked meto look at him again and tell him about the 'very funny bird' he reminded me of.I struggled against him, and out of contempt said that there was nothing to talkabout. Then I felt compelled to ask him why he had said he knew I used to huntfalcons.Instead of answering me, he again commented on my behaviour. He said I was aviolent fellow that was capable of 'frothing at the mouth' at the drop of a hat.I protested that that was not true. I had always had the idea I was rathercongenial and easygoing. I said it was his fault for forcing me out of controlwith his unexpected words and actions.\"Why the anger?\" he asked.I took stock of my feelings and reactions. I really had no need to be angry withhim.He again insisted that I should look into his eyes and tell him about the'strange falcon'. He had changed his wording. He had said before 'a very funnybird'. Then he substituted it with 'strange falcon'. The change in wordingsummed up a change in my own mood. I had suddenly become sad.He squinted his eyes until they were two slits and said in an overdramatic voicethat he was seeing a very strange falcon. He repeated his statement three timesas if he were actually seeing it there in front of him.\"Don't you remember it?\" he asked.I did not remember anything of the sort.\"What's strange about the falcon?\" I asked.\"You must tell me that,\" he replied.I insisted that I had no way of knowing what he was referring to. Therefore, Icould not tell him anything.\"Don't fight me!\" he said. \"Fight your sluggishness and remember.\"I seriously struggled for a moment to figure him out. It did not occur to methat I could just as well have tried to remember.\"There was a time when you saw a lot of birds,\" he said as though cueing me.I told him that when I was a child I had lived on a farm and had hunted hundredsof birds.He said that if that was the case, I should not have any difficulty rememberingall the funny birds I had hunted.He looked at me with a question in his eyes, as if he had just given me the lastclue.\"I have hunted so many birds,\" I said, \"that I can't recall anything aboutthem.\"\"This bird is special,\" he replied almost in a whisper. \"This bird is a falcon.\"I became involved again in figuring out what he was driving at. Was he teasingme? Was he serious?After a long interval he urged me again to remember. I felt that it was uselessfor me to try to end his play. The only other thing I could do was to join him.\"Are you talking about a falcon that I have hunted?\" I asked.\"Yes,\" he whispered with his eyes closed.\"So this happened when I was a boy?\"\"Yes.\"\"But you said you're seeing a falcon in front of you now.\"\"I am.\"\"What are you trying to do to me?\"\"I'm trying to make you remember.\"\"What? For heaven's sakes!\"\"A falcon swift as light,\" he said, looking at me in the eyes.I felt my heart had stopped.\"Now look at me,\" he said.But I did not. I heard his voice as a faint sound. Some stupendous recollectionhad taken me wholly. The white falcon! It all began with my grandfather's explosion of anger upon taking a count of hisyoung Leghorn chickens. They had been disappearing in a steady and disconcertingmanner. He personally organized and carried out a meticulous vigil, and afterdays of steady watching we finally saw a big white bird flying away with a youngLeghorn chicken in its claws.The bird was fast and apparently knew its route. It swooped down from behindsome trees, grabbed the chicken and flew away through an opening between twobranches. It happened so fast that my grandfather had hardly seen it, but I didand I knew that it was indeed a falcon. My grandfather said that if that was thecase it had to be an albino.We started a campaign against the albino falcon, and twice I thought I hadgotten it. It even dropped its prey, but it got away. It was too fast for me. Itwas also very intelligent: It never came back to hunt on my grandfather's farm.I would have forgotten about it had my grandfather not needled me to hunt thebird. For two months I chased the albino falcon all over the valley where Ilived. I learned its habits, and I could almost intuit its route of flight. Yetits speed and the suddenness of its appearance would always baffle me. I couldboast that I had prevented it from taking its prey, perhaps every time we hadmet, but I could never bag it.In the two months that I carried on the strange war against the albino falcon, Icame close to it only once. I had been chasing it all day and I was tired. I hadsat down to rest, and fell asleep under a tall eucalyptus tree.The sudden cry of a falcon woke me up. I opened my eyes without making any othermovement and I saw a whitish bird perched in the highest branches of theeucalyptus tree. It was the albino falcon. The chase was over. It was going tobe a difficult shot: I was lying on my back and the bird had its back turned tome. There was a sudden gust of wind and I used it to muffle the noise of liftingmy .22 long rifle to take aim. I wanted to wait until the bird had turned oruntil it had begun to fly so I would not miss it.But the albino bird remained motionless. In order to take a better shot I wouldhave needed to move and the falcon was too fast for that. I thought that my bestalternative was to wait. And I did, a long, interminable time. Perhaps whataffected me was the long wait, or perhaps it was the loneliness of the spotwhere the bird and I were: I suddenly felt a chill up my spine, and in anunprecedented action I stood up and left. I did not even look to see if the birdhad flown away.I never attached any significance to my final act with the albino falcon.However, it was terribly strange that I did not shoot it. I had shot dozens offalcons before. On the farm where I grew up, shooting birds, or hunting any kindof animal was a matter of course. Don Juan listened attentively as I told him the story of the albino falcon.\"How did you know about the white falcon?\" I asked when I had finished.\"I saw it,\" he replied.\"Where?\"\"Right here in front of you.\"I was not in an argumentative mood any more.\"What does all this mean?\" I asked.He said that a white bird like that was an omen, and that not shooting it downwas the only right thing to do.\"Your death gave you a little warning,\" he said with a mysterious tone. \"Italways comes as a chill.\"\"What are you talking about?\" I said nervously.He really made me nervous with his spooky talk.\"You know a lot about birds,\" he said. \"You've killed too many of them. You knowhow to wait. You have waited patiently for hours. I know that. I am seeing it.\" His words caused a great turmoil in me. I thought that what annoyed me the mostabout him was his certainty. I could not stand his dogmatic assuredness aboutissues in my own life that I was not sure of myself.I became engulfed in my feelings of dejection and I did not see him leaning overme until he actually had whispered something in my ear. I did not understand atfirst and he repeated it. He told me to turn around casually and look at aboulder to my left. He said that my death was there staring at me and if Iturned when he signalled me I might be capable of seeing it.He signalled me with his eyes. I turned and I thought I saw a flickeringmovement over the boulder. A chill ran through my body, the muscles of myabdomen contracted involuntarily and I experienced a jolt- a spasm. After amoment I regained my composure and I explained away the sensation of seeing theflickering shadow as an optical illusion caused by turning my head so abruptly.\"Death is our eternal companion,\" don Juan said with a most serious air. \"It isalways to our left, at an arm's length. It was watching you when you werewatching the white falcon: It whispered in your ear and you felt its chill, asyou felt it today. It has always been watching you. It always will until the dayit taps you.\"He extended his arm, and touched me lightly on the shoulder; and at the sametime he made a deep clicking sound with his tongue. The effect was devastating.I almost got sick to my stomach.\"You're the boy who stalked game, and waited patiently, as death waits. You knowvery well that death is to our left; the same way you were to the left of thewhite falcon.\"His words had the strange power to plunge me into an unwarranted terror. My onlydefence was my compulsion to commit to writing everything he said.\"How can anyone feel so important when we know that death is stalking us?\" heasked.I had the feeling my answer was not really needed. I could not have saidanything anyway. A new mood had possessed me.\"The thing to do when you're impatient,\" he proceeded, \"is to turn to your leftand ask advice from your death. An immense amount of pettiness is dropped ifyour death makes a gesture to you, or if you catch a glimpse of it, or if youjust have the feeling that your companion is there watching you.\"He leaned over again, and whispered in my ear that if I turned to my leftsuddenly, upon seeing his signal, I could again see my death on the boulder.His eyes gave me an almost imperceptible signal, but I did not dare to look.I told him that I believed him, and that he did not have to press the issue anyfurther because I was terrified. He had one of his roaring belly laughs.He replied that the issue of our death was never pressed far enough. I arguedthat it would be meaningless for me to dwell upon my death, since such a thoughtwould only bring discomfort and fear.\"You're full of crap!\" he exclaimed. \"Death is the only wise adviser that wehave. Whenever you feel, as you always do, that everything is going wrong andyou're about to be annihilated, turn to your death and ask if that is so. Yourdeath will tell you that you're wrong; that nothing really matters outside itstouch. Your death will tell you, 'I haven't touched you yet.'\"He shook his head and seemed to be waiting for my reply. I had none. My thoughtswere running rampant. He had delivered a staggering blow to my egotism. Thepettiness of being annoyed with him was monstrous in the light of my death.I had the feeling he was fully aware of my change of mood. He had turned thetide in his favour. He smiled and began to hum a Mexican tune.\"Yes,\" he said softly after a long pause. \"One of us here has to change, andfast. One of us here has to learn again that death is the hunter, and that it isalways to one's left. One of us here has to ask death's advice, and drop thecursed pettiness that belongs to men that live their lives as if death willnever tap them.\" We remained quiet for more than an hour, and then we started walking again. Wemeandered in the desert chaparral for hours. I did not ask him if there was anypurpose to it. It did not matter. Somehow he had made me recapture an oldfeeling; something I had quite forgotten; the sheer joy of just moving aroundwithout attaching any intellectual purpose to it.I wanted him to let me catch a glimpse of whatever I had seen on the boulder.\"Let me see that shadow again,\" I said.\"You mean your death, don't you?\" he replied with a touch of irony in his voice.For a moment I felt reluctant to voice it.\"Yes,\" I finally said. \"Let me see my death once again.\"\"Not now,\" he said. \"You're too solid.\"\"I beg your pardon?\"He began to laugh, and for some unknown reason his laughter was no longeroffensive and insidious as it had seemed in the past. I did not think that itwas different from the point of view of its pitch, its loudness, or the spiritof it: The new element was my mood. In view of my impending death my fears andannoyance were nonsense.\"Let me talk to plants then,\" I said.He roared with laughter.\"You're too good now,\" he said, still laughing. \"You go from one extreme to theother. Be still.\"There is no need to talk to plants unless you want to know their secrets, andfor that you need the most unbending intent. So save your good wishes.\"There is no need to see your death either. It is sufficient that you feel itspresence around you.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"5. Assuming Responsibility Tuesday, 1961 April 11 I arrived at don Juan's house in the early morning on Sunday, April 9.\"Good morning, don Juan,\" I said. \"Am I glad to see you!\"He looked at me, and broke into a soft laughter. He had walked to my car as Iwas parking it, and held the door open while I gathered some packages of foodthat I had brought for him.We walked to the house, and sat down by the door.This was the first time I had been really aware of what I was doing there. Forthree months I had actually looked forward to going back to the 'field'. It wasas if a time bomb set within myself had exploded, and suddenly I had rememberedsomething transcendental to me. I had remembered that once in my life I had beenvery patient and very efficient.Before don Juan could say anything I asked him the question that had beenpressing hard in my mind. For three months I had been obsessed with the memoryof the albino falcon. How did he know about it when I myself had forgotten?He laughed but did not answer. I pleaded with him to tell me.\"It was nothing,\" he said with his usual conviction. \"Anyone could tell thatyou're strange. You're just numb, that's all.\"I felt that he was again getting me off guard, and was pushing me into a cornerin which I did not care to be.\"Is it possible to see our death?\" I asked, trying to remain within the topic.\"Sure,\" he said, laughing. \"It is here with us.\"\"How do you know that?\"\"I'm an old man. With age, one learns all kinds of things.\"\"I know lots of old people, but they have never learned this. How come you did?\"\"Well, let's say that I know all kinds of things because I don't have a personalhistory; and because I don't feel more important than anything else; and becausemy death is sitting with me right here.\"He extended his left arm, and moved his fingers as if he were actually pettingsomething.I laughed. I knew where he was leading me. The old devil was going to clobber meagain- probably with my self-importance, but I did not mind this time. Thememory that I had once had a superb patience filled me with a strange, quieteuphoria that dispelled most of my feelings of nervousness and intolerancetowards don Juan. What I felt instead was a sensation of wonder about his acts. \"Who are you, really?\" I asked.He seemed surprised. He opened his eyes to an enormous size and blinked like abird, closing his eyelids as if they were a shutter. They came down and went upagain and his eyes remained in focus. His maneuver startled me and I recoiled;and he laughed with childlike abandon.\"For you I am Juan Matus, and I am at your service,\" he said with exaggeratedpoliteness.I then asked my other burning question: \"What did you do to me the first day wemet?\"I was referring to the look he had given me.\"Me? Nothing,\" he replied with a tone of innocence.I described to him the way I had felt when he had looked at me and howincongruous it had been for me to be tongue-tied by it.He laughed until tears rolled down his cheeks. I again felt a surge of animositytowards him. I thought that I was being so serious and thoughtful, and he wasbeing so 'Indian' in his coarse ways.He apparently detected my mood, and stopped laughing all of a sudden.After a long hesitation, I told him that his laughter had annoyed me because Iwas seriously trying to understand what had happened to me.\"There is nothing to understand,\" he replied, undisturbed. I reviewed for him the sequence of unusual events that had taken place since Ihad met him, starting with the mysterious look he had given me, to rememberingthe albino falcon and seeing on the boulder the shadow he had said was my death.\"Why are you doing all this to me?\" I asked.There was no belligerence in my question. I was only curious as to why it was mein particular.\"You asked me to tell you what I know about plants,\" he said.I noticed a tinge of sarcasm in his voice. He sounded as if he were humouringme.\"But what you have told me so far has nothing to do with plants,\" I protested.His reply was that it took time to learn about them.My feeling was that it was useless to argue with him. I realized then the totalidiocy of the easy and absurd resolutions I had made. While I was at home I hadpromised myself that I was never going to lose my temper or feel annoyed withdon Juan. In the actual situation, however, the minute he rebuffed me I hadanother attack of peevishness. I felt there was no way for me to interact withhim and that angered me.\"Think of your death now,\" don Juan said suddenly. \"It is at arm's length. Itmay tap you any moment, so really you have no time for crappy thoughts andmoods. None of us have time for that.\"Do you want to know what I did to you the first day we met? I saw you, and Isaw that you thought you were lying to me. But you weren't, not really.\"I told him that his explanation confused me even more. He replied that that wasthe reason he did not want to explain his acts, and that explanations were notnecessary. He said that the only thing that counted was action; acting insteadof talking. He pulled out a straw mat and lay down, propping his head up with a bundle. Hemade himself comfortable and then he told me that there was another thing I hadto perform if I really wanted to learn about plants.\"What was wrong with you when I saw you, and what is wrong with you now, is thatyou don't like to take responsibility for what you do,\" he said slowly, as if togive me time to understand what he was saying. \"When you were telling me allthose doings in the bus depot you were aware that they were lies. Why were youlying?\"I explained that my objective had been to find a 'key informant' for my work.Don Juan smiled and began humming a Mexican tune.\"When a man decides to do something, he must go all the way,\" he said, \"but hemust take responsibility for what he does. No matter what he does, he must knowfirst why he is doing it, and then he must proceed with his actions withouthaving doubts or remorse about them.\"He examined me. I did not know what to say. Finally I ventured an opinion,almost as a protest.\"That's an impossibility!\" I said.He asked me why, and I said that perhaps ideally that was what everybody thoughtthey should do. In practice, however, there was no way to avoid doubts andremorse.\"Of course there is a way,\" he replied with conviction.\"Look at me,\" he said. \"I have no doubts or remorse. Everything I do is mydecision and my responsibility. The simplest thing I do, to take you for a walkin the desert, for instance, may very well mean my death. Death is stalking me.Therefore, I have no room for doubts or remorse. If I have to die as a result oftaking you for a walk, then I must die.\"You, on the other hand, feel that you are immortal, and the decisions of animmortal man can be cancelled or regretted or doubted. In a world where death isthe hunter, my friend, there is no time for regrets or doubts. There is onlytime for decisions.\"I argued, in sincerity, that in my opinion that was an unreal world, because itwas arbitrarily made by taking an idealized form of behaviour and saying thatthat was the way to proceed. I told him the story of my father, who used to give me endless lectures aboutthe wonders of a healthy mind in a healthy body; and how young men should tempertheir bodies with hardships and with feats of athletic competition.He was a young man. When I was eight years old he was only twenty-seven. Duringthe summertime, as a rule, he would come from the city, where he taught school,to spend at least a month with me at my grandparents' farm where I lived. It wasa hellish month for me. I told don Juan one instance of my father's behaviourthat I thought would apply to the situation at hand.Almost immediately upon arriving at the farm, my father would insist on taking along walk with me at his side so we could talk things over; and while we weretalking, he would make plans for us to go swimming every day at six A.M. Atnight he would set the alarm for five-thirty to have plenty of time, because atsix sharp we had to be in the water. And when the alarm would go off in themorning, he would jump out of bed, put on his glasses, go to the window, andlook out.I had even memorized the ensuing monologue.\"Uhm... A bit cloudy today. Listen, I'm going to lie down again for just fiveminutes. O.K.? No more than five! I'm just going to stretch my muscles and fullywake up.\"He would invariably fall asleep again until ten; sometimes until noon.I told don Juan that what annoyed me was his refusal to give up his obviouslyphoney resolutions. He would repeat this ritual every morning until I wouldfinally hurt his feelings by refusing to set the alarm clock. \"They were not phony resolutions,\" don Juan said, obviously taking sides with myfather. \"He just didn't know how to get out of bed, that's all.\"\"At any rate,\" I said, \"I'm always leery of unreal resolutions.\"\"What would be a resolution that is real then?\" don Juan asked with a coy smile.\"If my father would have said to himself that he could not go swimming at six inthe morning, but perhaps at three in the afternoon.\"\"Your resolutions injure the spirit,\" don Juan said with an air of greatseriousness.I thought I even detected a note of sadness in his tone. We were quiet for along time. My peevishness had vanished. I thought of my father.\"He didn't want to swim at three in the afternoon. Don't you see?\" don Juansaid.His words made me jump.I told him that my father was weak, and so was his world of ideal acts that henever performed. I was almost shouting.Don Juan did not say a word. He shook his head slowly in a rhythmical way. Ifelt terribly sad. Thinking of my father always gave me a consuming feeling.\"You think you were stronger, don't you?\" he asked in a casual tone.I said I did. I began to tell him all the emotional turmoil that my father hadput me through, but he interrupted me.\"Was he mean to you?\" he asked.\"No.\"\"Was he petty with you?\"\"No.\"\"Did he do all he could for you?\"\"Yes.\"\"Then what was wrong with him?\"Again I began to shout that he was weak, but I caught myself and lowered myvoice. I felt a bit ludicrous being cross-examined by don Juan.\"What are you doing all this for?\" I said. \"We were supposed to be talking aboutplants.\"I felt more annoyed and despondent than ever. I told him that he had no businessor the remotest qualifications to pass judgement on my behaviour, and heexploded into a belly laugh.\"When you get angry you always feel righteous, don't you?\" he said, and blinkedlike a bird.He was right. I had the tendency to feel justified at being angry.\"Let's not talk about my father,\" I said, feigning a happy mood. \"Let's talkabout plants.\"\"No, let's talk about your father,\" he insisted. \"That is the place to begintoday. If you think that you were so much stronger than he, why didn't you goswimming at six in the morning in his place?\"I told him that I could not believe he was seriously asking me that. I hadalways thought that swimming at six in the morning was my father's business, andnot mine.\"It was also your business from the moment you accepted his idea,\" don Juansnapped at me.I said that I had never accepted it; that I had always known my father was nottruthful to himself. Don Juan asked me matter-of-factly why I had not voiced myopinions at the time.\"You don't tell your father things like that,\" I said as a weak explanation.\"Why not?\"\"That was not done in my house, that's all.\"\"You have done worse things in your house,\" he declared like a judge from thebench. \"The only thing you never did was to shine your spirit.\" There was such a devastating force in his words that they echoed in my mind. Hebrought all my defences down. I could not argue with him. I took refuge inwriting my notes,I tried a last feeble explanation, and said that all my life I had encounteredpeople of my father's kind who had, like my father, hooked me somehow into theirschemes; and as a rule I had always been left dangling.\"You are complaining,\" he said softly. \"You have been complaining all your lifebecause you don't assume responsibility for your decisions. If you would haveassumed responsibility for your father's idea of swimming at six in the morning,you would have swum, by yourself if necessary; or you would have told him to goto hell the first time he opened his mouth after you knew his devices. But youdidn't say anything. Therefore, you were as weak as your father.\"To assume the responsibility of one's decisions means that one is ready to diefor them.\"\"Wait, wait!\" I said. \"You are twisting this around.\"He did not let me finish. I was going to tell him that I had used my father onlyas an example of an unrealistic way of acting; and that nobody in his right mindwould be willing to die for such an idiotic thing.\"It doesn't matter what the decision is,\" he said. \"Nothing could be more orless serious than anything else. Don't you see? In a world where death is thehunter there are no small or big decisions. There are only decisions that wemake in the face of our inevitable death.\"I could not say anything. Perhaps an hour went by. Don Juan was perfectlymotionless on his mat although he was not sleeping.\"Why do you tell me all this, don Juan?\" I asked. \"Why are you doing this tome?\"He said, \"You came to me. No, that was not the case. You were brought to me; andI have had a gesture with you.\"\"I beg your pardon?\"\"You could have had a gesture with your father by swimming for him, but youdidn't, perhaps because you were too young. I have lived longer than you. I havenothing pending. There is no hurry in my life, therefore I can properly have agesture with you.\" In the afternoon we went for a hike. I easily kept his pace, and marvelled againat his stupendous physical prowess. He walked so nimbly and with such sure stepsthat next to him I was like a child. We went in an easterly direction.I noticed then that he did not like to talk while he walked. If I spoke to himhe would stop walking in order to answer me.After a couple of hours we came to a hill. He sat down and signalled me to sitby him. He announced in a mock-dramatic tone that he was going to tell me astory.He said that once upon a time there was a young man; a destitute Indian wholived among the white men in a city. He had no home; no relatives; no friends.He had come into the city to find his fortune and had found only misery andpain. From time to time he made a few cents working like a mule; barely enoughfor a morsel: otherwise he had to beg or steal food.Don Juan said that one day the young man went to the market place. He walked upand down the street in a haze; his eyes wild upon seeing all the good thingsthat were gathered there. He was so frantic that he did not see where he waswalking. He ended up tripping over some baskets, and fell on top of an old man.The old man had been carrying four enormous gourds, and had just sat down torest and eat. Don Juan smiled knowingly, and said that the old man found itquite strange that the young man had stumbled on him. He was not angry at beingdisturbed; but was amazed at why this particular young man had fallen on top ofhim.The young man, on the other hand, was angry and told the old man to get out ofhis way. The young man was not concerned at all about the ultimate reason fortheir meeting. He had not noticed that their paths had actually crossed.Don Juan mimicked the motions of someone going after something that was rollingover. He said that the old man's gourds had turned over and were rolling downthe street. When the young man saw the gourds, he thought he had found his foodfor the day.He helped the old man up and insisted on helping him carry the heavy gourds. Theold man told him that he was on his way to his home in the mountains. The youngman insisted on going with him, at least part of the way.The old man took the road to the mountains and as they walked, he gave the youngman part of the food he had bought at the market. The young man ate to hisheart's content. When he was quite satisfied, he began to notice how heavy thegourds were, and clutched them tightly.Don Juan opened his eyes and smiled with a devilish grin, and said that theyoung man asked, \"What do you carry in these gourds?\"The old man did not answer but told him that he was going to show him acompanion- or friend- who could alleviate the young man's sorrows; and give himadvice and wisdom about the ways of the world.Don Juan made a majestic gesture with both hands, and said that the old mansummoned the most beautiful deer that the young man had ever seen. The deer wasso tame that it came to him, and walked around him. It glittered and shone. Theyoung man was spellbound and knew right away that it was a 'spirit deer'. Theold man told him then, that if he wished to have that friend and its wisdom, allhe had to do was to let go of the gourds.Don Juan's grin portrayed ambition. He said that the young man's petty desireswere pricked upon hearing such a request. Don Juan's eyes became small anddevilish as he voiced the young man's question: \"What do you have in these fourenormous gourds?\"Don Juan said that the old man very serenely replied that he was carrying food:'pinole' and water. He stopped narrating the story and walked around in a circlea couple of times. I did not know what he was doing. But apparently it was partof the story. The circle seemed to portray the deliberations of the young man.Don Juan said that, of course, the young man had not believed a word. Hecalculated that if the old man, who was obviously a wizard, was willing to givea 'spirit deer' for his gourds, then the gourds must have been filled with powerbeyond belief.Don Juan contorted his face again into a devilish grin, and said that the youngman declared that he wanted to have the gourds. There was a long pause thatseemed to mark the end of the story. Don Juan remained quiet, yet I was sure hewanted me to ask about it, and I did.\"What happened to the young man?\"\"He took the gourds,\" he replied with a smile of satisfaction.There was another long pause. I laughed. I thought that this had been a real'Indian story'.Don Juan's eyes were shining as he smiled at me. There was an air of innocenceabout him. He began to laugh in soft spurts and asked me, \"Don't you want toknow about the gourds?\"\"Of course I want to know. I thought that was the end of the story.\"\"Oh no,\" he said with a mischievous light in his eyes. \"The young man took hisgourds, and ran away to an isolated place and opened them.\"\"What did he find?\" I asked.Don Juan glanced at me and I had the feeling he was aware of my mentalgymnastics. He shook his head and chuckled.\"Well,\" I urged him. \"Were the gourds empty?\"\"There was only food and water inside the gourds,\" he said. \"And the young man,in a fit of anger, smashed them against the rocks.\"I said that his reaction was only natural- anyone in his position would havedone the same.Don Juan's reply was that the young man was a fool who did not know what he waslooking for. He did not know what 'power' was, so he could not tell whether ornot he had found it. He had not taken responsibility for his decision, thereforehe was angered by his blunder. He expected to gain something and got nothinginstead.Don Juan speculated that if I were the young man and if I had followed myinclinations, I would have ended up angry and remorseful, and would, no doubt,have spent the rest of my life feeling sorry for myself for what I had lost.Then he explained the behaviour of the old man. He had cleverly fed the youngman so as to give him the 'daring of a satisfied stomach', thus the young manupon finding only food in the gourds smashed them in a fit of anger.\"Had the young man been aware of his decision and assumed responsibility forit,\" don Juan said, \"he would have taken the food, and would've been more thansatisfied with it. And perhaps he might even have realized that that food waspower too.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"6. Becoming a Hunter Friday, 1961 June 23 As soon as I sat down I bombarded don Juan with questions. He did not answer meand made an impatient gesture with his hand to be quiet. He seemed to be in aserious mood.\"I was thinking that you haven't changed at all in the time you've been tryingto learn about plants,\" he said in an accusing tone. He began reviewing in aloud voice all the changes of personality he had recommended I should undertake.I told him that I had considered the matter very seriously and found that Icould not possibly fulfill them because each of them ran contrary to my core.He replied that to merely consider them was not enough, and that whatever he hadsaid to me was not said just for fun.I again insisted that, although I had done very little in matters of adjustingmy personal life to his ideas, I really wanted to learn the uses of plants.After a long, uneasy silence I boldly asked him, \"Would you teach me aboutpeyote, don Juan?\"He said that my intentions alone were not enough, and that to know about peyote-he called it 'Mescalito' for the first time- was a serious matter. It seemedthat there was nothing else to say.In the early evening, however, he set up a test for me. He put forth a problemwithout giving me any clues to its solution: to find a beneficial place, orspot, in the area right in front of his door where we always sat to talk; a spotwhere I could allegedly feel perfectly happy and invigorated.During the course of the night, while I attempted to find the 'spot' by rollingon the ground, I twice detected a change of coloration on the uniformly darkdirt floor of the designated area. The problem exhausted me and I fell asleep onone of the places where I had detected the change in colour.In the morning don Juan woke me up, and announced that I had had a verysuccessful experience. Not only had I found the beneficial spot I was lookingfor, but I had also found its opposite, an enemy or negative spot; and thecolours associated with both. Saturday, 1961 June 24 We went into the desert chaparral in the early morning. As we walked, don Juanexplained to me that finding a 'beneficial' or an 'enemy' spot was an importantneed for a man in the wilderness. I wanted to steer the conversation to thetopic of peyote, but he flatly refused to talk about it. He warned me that thereshould be no mention of it unless he himself brought up the subject.We sat down to rest in the shade of some tall bushes in an area of thickvegetation. The desert chaparral around us was not quite dry yet. It was a warmday and the flies kept on pestering me, but they did not seem to bother donJuan. I wondered whether he was just ignoring them, but then I noticed they werenot landing on his face at all.\"Sometimes it is necessary to find a beneficial spot quickly out in the open,\"don Juan went on. \"Or maybe it is necessary to determine quickly whether or notthe spot where one is about to rest is a bad one. One time we sat to rest bysome hill, and you got very angry and upset. That spot was your enemy. A littlecrow gave you a warning, remember?\"I remembered that he had made a point of telling me to avoid that area in thefuture. I also remembered that I had become angry because he had not let melaugh.\"I thought that the crow that flew overhead was an omen for me alone,\" he said.\"I would never have suspected that the crows were friendly towards you too.\"\"What are you talking about?\"\"The crow was an omen,\" he went on. \"If you knew about crows you would haveavoided the place like the plague. Crows are not always available to givewarning though, and you must learn to find, by yourself, a proper place to campor to rest.\"After a long pause don Juan suddenly turned to me and said that in order to findthe proper place to rest all I had to do was to cross my eyes. He gave me aknowing look, and in a confidential tone told me that I had done precisely thatwhen I was rolling on his porch; and thus I had been capable of finding twospots and their colours. He let me know that he was impressed by myaccomplishment.\"I really don't know what I did,\" I said.\"You crossed your eyes,\" he said emphatically. \"That's the technique. You musthave done that, although you don't remember it.\"Don Juan then described the technique, which he said took years to perfect, andwhich consisted of gradually forcing the eyes to see separately the same image.The lack of image conversion entailed a double perception of the world. Thisdouble perception, according to don Juan, allowed one the opportunity of judgingchanges in the surroundings which the eyes were ordinarily incapable ofperceiving. Don Juan coaxed me to try it. He assured me that it was not injurious to thesight. He said that I should begin by looking in short glances, almost with thecorners of my eyes. He pointed to a large bush and showed me how. I had astrange feeling, seeing don Juan's eyes taking incredibly fast glances at thebush. His eyes reminded me of those of a shifty animal that cannot lookstraight.We walked for perhaps an hour while I tried not to focus my sight on anything.Then don Juan asked me to start separating the images perceived by each of myeyes. After another hour or so, I got a terrible headache and had to stop.\"Do you think you could find, by yourself, a proper place for us to rest?\" heasked.I had no idea what the criterion for a 'proper place' was. He patientlyexplained that looking in short glances allowed the eyes to pick out unusualsights.\"Such as what?\" I asked.\"They are not sights proper,\" he said. \"They are more like feelings. If you lookat a bush or a tree or a rock where you may like to rest, your eyes can make youfeel whether or not that's the best resting place.\"I again urged him to describe what those feelings were, but he either could notdescribe them, or he simply did not want to. He said that I should practise bypicking out a place, and then he would tell me whether or not my eyes wereworking.At one moment, I caught sight of what I thought was a pebble which reflectedlight. I could not see it if I focused my eyes on it, but, if I swept the areawith fast glances, I could detect a sort of faint glitter. I pointed out theplace to don Juan. It was in the middle of an open unshaded flat area devoid ofthick bushes. He laughed uproariously and then asked me why I had picked thatspecific spot. I explained that I was seeing a glitter.\"I don't care what you see,\" he said. \"You could be seeing an elephant. How youfeel is the important issue.\"I did not feel anything at all. He gave me a mysterious look. He said that hewished he could oblige me and sit down to rest with me there, but he was goingto sit somewhere else while I tested my choice.I sat down while he looked at me curiously from a distance of thirty or fortyfeet away. After a few minutes he began to laugh loudly. Somehow his laughtermade me nervous. It put me on edge. I felt he was making fun of me and I gotangry. I began to question my motives for being there. There was definitelysomething wrong in the way my total endeavour with don Juan was proceeding. Ifelt that I was just a pawn in his clutches.Suddenly don Juan charged at me at full speed, and pulled me by the arm;dragging me bodily for ten or twelve feet. He helped me to stand up, and wipedsome perspiration from his forehead. I noticed then that he had exerted himselfto his limit.He patted me on the back and said that I had picked the wrong place; and that hehad had to rescue me in a real hurry because he saw that the spot where I wassitting was about to take over my entire feelings.I laughed. The image of don Juan charging at me was very funny. He had actuallyrun like a young man. His feet moved as if he were grabbing the soft reddishdirt of the desert in order to catapult himself over me. I had seen him laughingat me, and then in a matter of seconds he was dragging me by the arm.After a while he urged me to continue looking for a proper place to rest. Wekept on walking, but I did not detect or 'feel' anything at all. Perhaps if Ihad been more relaxed I would have noticed or felt something. I had ceased,however, to be angry with him. Finally he pointed to some rocks and we came to ahalt.\"Don't feel disappointed,\" don Juan said. \"It takes a long time to train theeyes properly.\" I did not say anything. I was not going to be disappointed about something I didnot understand at all. Yet, I had to admit that three times already since I hadbegun to visit don Juan, I had become very angry and had been agitated to thepoint of being nearly ill while sitting on places that he called bad.\"The trick is to feel with your eyes,\" he said. \"Your problem now is that youdon't know what to feel. It'll come to you, though, with practice.\"\"Perhaps you should tell me, don Juan, what I am supposed to feel.\"\"That's impossible.\"\"Why?\"\"No one can tell you what you are supposed to feel. It is not heat, or light, orglare, or colour. It is something else.\"\"Can't you describe it?\"\"No. All I can do is give you the technique. Once you learn to separate theimages and see two of everything, you must focus your attention in the areabetween the two images. Any change worthy of notice would take place there inthat area.\"\"What kind of changes are they?\"\"That is not important. The feeling that you get is what counts. Every man isdifferent. You saw glitter today, but that did not mean anything because thefeeling was missing. I can't tell you how to feel. You must learn thatyourself.\" We rested in silence for some time. Don Juan covered his face with his hat, andremained motionless as if he were asleep.I became absorbed in writing my notes until he made a sudden movement that mademe jolt. He sat up abruptly and faced me, frowning.\"You have a knack for hunting,\" he said. \"And that's what you should learn;hunting. We are not going to talk about plants any more.\"He puffed out his jaws for an instant, then candidly added, \"I don't think weever have anyway... have we?\" and laughed. We spent the rest of the day walking in every direction while he gave me anunbelievably detailed explanation about rattlesnakes: the way they nest, the waythey move around, their seasonal habits, their quirks of behaviour.Then he proceeded to corroborate each of the points he had made, and finally hecaught and killed a large snake. He cut its head off, cleaned its viscera,skinned it, and roasted the meat.His movements had such a grace and skill that it was a sheer pleasure just to bearound him. I had listened to him and watched him spellbound. My concentrationhad been so complete that the rest of the world had practically vanished for me.Eating the snake was a hard reentry into the world of ordinary affairs. I feltnauseated when I began to chew a bite of snake meat. It was an ill-foundedqueasiness as the meat was delicious, but my stomach seemed to be rather anindependent unit. I could hardly swallow at all. I thought don Juan would have aheart attack from laughing so hard.Afterwards we sat down for a leisurely rest in the shade of some rocks. I beganto work on my notes, and the quantity of them made me realize that he had givenme an astonishing amount of information about rattlesnakes.\"Your hunter's spirit has returned to you,\" don Juan said suddenly and with aserious face. \"Now you're hooked.\"\"I beg your pardon?\"I wanted him to elaborate on his statement that I was hooked, but he onlylaughed and repeated it.\"How am I hooked?\" I insisted.\"Hunters will always hunt,\" he said. \"I am a hunter myself.\"\"Do you mean you hunt for a living?\"\"I hunt in order to live. I can live off the land, anywhere.\"He indicated the total surroundings with his hand.\"To be a hunter means that one knows a great deal,\" he went on. \"It means thatone can see the world in different ways. In order to be a hunter one must be inperfect balance with everything else, otherwise hunting would become ameaningless chore. For instance, today we took a little snake. I had toapologize to her for cutting her life off so suddenly and so definitely. I didwhat I did knowing that my own life will also be cut off someday in very muchthe same fashion; suddenly and definitely. So, all in all, we and the snakes areon a par. One of them fed us today.\"\"I had never conceived a balance of that kind when I used to hunt,\" I said.\"That's not true. You didn't just kill animals. You and your family all ate thegame.\"His statements carried the conviction of someone who had been there. He was, ofcourse, right. There had been times when I had provided the incidental wild meatfor my family.After a moment's hesitation I asked, \"How did you know that?\"\"There are certain things that I just know,\" he said. \"I can't tell you howthough.\"I told him that my aunts and uncles would very seriously call all the birds Iwould bag 'pheasants'.Don Juan said he could easily imagine them calling a sparrow a 'tiny pheasant'and added a comical rendition of how they would chew it. The extraordinarymovements of his jaw gave me the feeling that he was actually chewing a wholebird, bones and all.\"I really think that you have a touch for hunting,\" he said, staring at me, \"andwe have been barking up the wrong tree. Perhaps you will be willing to changeyour way of life in order to become a hunter.\"He reminded me that I had found out, with just a little exertion on my part,that in the world there were good and bad spots for me. He added that I had alsofound out the specific colours associated with them.\"That means that you have a knack for hunting,\" he declared. \"Not everyone whotries would find their colours and their spots at the same time.\"To be a hunter sounded very nice and romantic, but it was an absurdity to mesince I did not particularly care to hunt.\"You don't have to care to hunt or to like it,\" he replied to my complaint. \"Youhave a natural inclination. I think the best hunters never like hunting: They doit well, that's all.\"I said I had the feeling don Juan was capable of arguing his way out ofanything, and yet he maintained that he did not like to talk at all.\"It is like what I have told you about hunters,\" he said. \"I don't necessarilylike to talk. I just have a knack for it and I do it well. That's all.\"I found his mental agility truly funny.\"Hunters must be exceptionally tight individuals,\" he continued. \"A hunterleaves very little to chance. I have been trying all along to convince you thatyou must learn to live in a different way. So far I have not succeeded. Therewas nothing you could've grabbed on to. Now it's different. I have brought backyour old hunter's spirit. Perhaps through it you will change.\"I protested that I did not want to become a hunter. I reminded him that in thebeginning I had just wanted him to tell me about medicinal plants, but he hadmade me stray so far away from my original purpose that I could not clearlyrecall any more whether or not I had really wanted to learn about plants.\"Good,\" he said. \"Really good. If you don't have such a clear picture of whatyou want, you may become more humble.\"Let's put it this way. For your purposes it doesn't really matter whether youlearn about plants or about hunting. You've told me that yourself. You areinterested in anything that anyone can tell you. True?\"I had said that to him in trying to define the scope of anthropology, and inorder to draft him as my informant.Don Juan chuckled; obviously aware of his control over the situation.\"I am a hunter,\" he said, as if he were reading my thoughts. \"I leave verylittle to chance. Perhaps I should explain to you that I learned to be a hunter.I have not always lived the way I do now. At one point in my life, I had tochange.\"Now I'm pointing the direction to you. I'm guiding you. I know what I'm talkingabout. Someone taught me all this. I didn't figure it out for myself.\"\"Do you mean that you had a teacher, don Juan?\"\"Let's say that someone taught me to hunt the way I want to teach you now,\" hesaid, and quickly changed the topic. \"I think that once upon a time hunting was one of the greatest acts a man couldperform,\" he said. \"All hunters were powerful men. In fact, a hunter had to bepowerful to begin with in order to withstand the rigours of that life.\"Suddenly I became curious. Was he referring to a time perhaps prior to theConquest? I began to probe him.\"When was the time you are talking about?\"\"Once upon a time.\"\"When? What does 'once upon a time' mean?\"\"It means once upon a time, or maybe it means now, today. It doesn't matter. Atone time everybody knew that a hunter was the best of men. Now not everyoneknows that, but there are a sufficient number of people who do. I know it:someday you will. See what I mean?\"\"Do the Yaqui Indians feel that way about hunters? That's what I want to know.\"\"Not necessarily.\"\"Do the Pima Indians?\"\"Not all of them. But some.\"I named various neighbouring groups. I wanted to commit him to a statement thathunting was a shared belief and practice of some specific people. But he avoidedanswering me directly, so I changed the subject. \"Why are you doing all this for me, don Juan?\" I asked.He took off his hat and scratched his temples in feigned bafflement.\"I'm having a gesture with you,\" he said softly. \"Other people have had asimilar gesture with you; someday you yourself will have the same gesture withothers. Let's say that it is my turn.\"One day I found out that if I wanted to be a hunter worthy of self-respect, Ihad to change my way of life. I used to whine and complain a great deal. I hadgood reasons to feel shortchanged. I am an Indian and Indians are treated likedogs. There was nothing I could do to remedy that, so all I was left with was mysorrow. But then my good fortune spared me and someone taught me to hunt. And Irealized that the way I lived was not worth living... so I changed it.\"\"But I am happy with my life, don Juan. Why should I have to change it?\"He began to sing a Mexican song, very softly, and then hummed the tune. His headbobbed up and down as he followed the beat of the song.\"Do you think that you and I are equal?\" he asked in a sharp voice.His question caught me off guard. I experienced a peculiar buzzing in my ears asthough he had actually shouted his words, which he had not done. However, therehad been a metallic sound in his voice that was reverberating in my ears.I scratched the inside of my left ear with the small finger of my left hand. Myears itched all the time and I had developed a rhythmical nervous way of rubbingthe inside of them with the small finger of either hand. The movement was moreproperly a shake of my whole arm.Don Juan watched my movements with apparent fascination.\"Well... are we equals?\" he asked.\"Of course we're equals,\" I said.I was, naturally, being condescending. [* condescending- treating others witharrogance, or patronizing those considered inferior] I felt very warm towardshim even though at times I did not know what to do with him. Yet I still held inthe back of my mind, although I would never voice it, the belief that I- being auniversity student; a man of the sophisticated Western world- was superior to anIndian.\"No,\" he said calmly, \"we are not.\"\"Why, certainly we are,\" I protested.\"No,\" he said in a soft voice. \"We are not equals. I am a hunter and a warrior,and you are a pimp.\"My mouth fell open. I could not believe that don Juan had actually said that. Idropped my notebook, and stared at him dumbfoundedly; and then, of course, Ibecame furious.He looked at me with calm and collected eyes. I avoided his gaze. And then hebegan to talk. He enunciated his words clearly. They poured out smoothly anddeadly.He said that I was pimping for someone else; that I was not fighting my ownbattles, but the battles of some unknown people; that I did not want to learnabout plants or about hunting or about anything; and that his world of preciseacts and feelings and decisions was infinitely more effective than theblundering idiocy I called 'my life'.After he finished talking I was numb. He had spoken without belligerence orconceit, but with such power, and yet such calmness, that I was not even angryany more.We remained silent. I felt embarrassed and could not think of anythingappropriate to say. I waited for him to break the silence.Hours went by. Don Juan became motionless by degrees, until his body hadacquired a strange, almost frightening rigidity. His silhouette became difficultto make out as it got dark, and finally when it was pitch black around us, heseemed to have merged into the blackness of the stones. His state ofmotionlessness was so total that it was as if he did not exist any longer.It was midnight when I finally realized that he could and would stay motionlessthere in that wilderness in those rocks, perhaps forever if he had to. His worldof precise acts and feelings and decisions was indeed superior.I quietly touched his arm, and tears flooded me. ======================================================= "},{"pageContent":"7. Being Inaccessible Thursday, 1961 June 29 Again don Juan, as he had done every day for nearly a week, held me spellboundwith his knowledge of specific details about the behaviour of game.He first explained and then corroborated a number of hunting tactics based onwhat he called 'the quirks of quails'.I became so utterly involved in his explanations that a whole day went by and Ihad not noticed the passage of time. I even forgot to eat lunch. Don Juan madejoking remarks that it was quite unusual for me to miss a meal.By the end of the day, he had caught five quail in a most ingenious trap whichhe had taught me to assemble and set up.\"Two are enough for us,\" he said, and let three of them loose.He then taught me how to roast quail. I had wanted to cut some shrubs and make abarbecue pit the way my grandfather used to make it; lined with green branchesand leaves and sealed with dirt. But don Juan said that there was no need toinjure the shrubs since we had already injured the quail.After we finished eating, we walked very leisurely towards a rocky area. We saton a sandstone hillside and I said jokingly that if he would have left thematter up to me, I would have cooked all five of the quail, and that my barbecuewould have tasted much better than his roast.\"No doubt,\" he said. \"But if you would have done all that, we might have neverleft this place in one piece.\"\"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"What would have prevented us?\"\"The shrubs, the quail, everything around would have pitched in.\"\"I never know when you are talking seriously,\" I said. He made a gesture offeigned impatience and smacked his lips.\"You have a weird notion of what it means to talk seriously,\" he said. \"I laugha great deal because I like to laugh, yet everything I say is deadly seriouseven if you don't understand it. Why should the world be only as you think itis? Who gave you the authority to say so?\"\"There is no proof that the world is otherwise,\" I said. It was getting dark. I was wondering if it was time to go back to don Juan'shouse, but he did not seem to be in a hurry; and I was enjoying myself.The wind was cold. Suddenly don Juan stood up, and told me that we had to climbto the hilltop and stand up on an area clear of shrubs. \"Don't be afraid,\" he said. \"I'm your friend and I'll see that nothing badhappens to you.\"\"What do you mean?\" I asked, alarmed. Don Juan had the most insidious facilityto shift me from sheer enjoyment to sheer fright.\"The world is very strange at this time of the day,\" he said. \"That's what Imean. No matter what you see, don't be afraid.\"\"What am I going to see?\"\"I don't know yet,\" he said, peering into the distance towards the south.He did not seem to be worried. I also kept on looking in the same direction.Suddenly he perked up, and pointed with his left hand towards a dark area in thedesert shrubbery.\"There it is,\" he said, as if he had been waiting for something which hadsuddenly appeared.\"What is it?\" I asked.\"There it is,\" he repeated. \"Look! Look!\"I did not see anything, just the shrubs.\"It is here now,\" he said with great urgency in his voice. \"It is here.\"A sudden gust of wind hit me at that instant, and made my eyes burn. I staredtowards the area in question. There was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary.\"I can't see a thing,\" I said.\"You just felt it,\" he replied. \"Right now. It got into your eyes, and kept youfrom seeing.\"\"What are you talking about?\"\"I have deliberately brought you to a hilltop,\" he said. \"We are very noticeablehere, and something is coming to us.\"\"What? The wind?\"\"Not just the wind,\" he said sternly. \"It may seem to be wind to you, becausewind is all you know.\"I strained my eyes staring into the desert shrubs. Don Juan stood silently by mefor a moment. He then walked into the nearby chaparral, and began to tear somebig branches from the surrounding shrubs. He gathered eight of them, and made abundle. He ordered me to do the same, and to apologize to the plants in a loudvoice for mutilating them.When we had two bundles, he made me run with them to the hilltop, and lie downon my back between two large rocks. With tremendous speed, he arranged thebranches of my bundle to cover my entire body. Then he covered himself in thesame manner, and whispered through the leaves that I should watch how theso-called wind would cease to blow once we had become unnoticeable.At one moment, to my utter amazement, the wind actually ceased to blow as donJuan had predicted. It happened so gradually that I would have missed the changehad I not been deliberately waiting for it. For a while the wind had hissedthrough the leaves over my face, and then gradually it became quiet all aroundus.I whispered to don Juan that the wind had stopped, and he whispered back that Ishould not make any overt noise or movement because what I was calling the windwas not wind at all, but something that had a volition of its own, and couldactually recognize us.I laughed out of nervousness.In a muffled voice don Juan called my attention to the quietness around us. Hewhispered that he was going to stand up, and I should follow him, putting thebranches aside very gently with my left hand.We stood up at the same time. Don Juan stared for a moment into the distancetowards the south, and then turned around abruptly and faced the west.\"Sneaky. Really sneaky,\" he muttered, pointing to an area towards the southwest.\"Look! Look!\" he urged me.I stared with all the intensity I was capable of. I wanted to see whatever hewas referring to, but I did not notice anything at all; or rather, I did notnotice anything I had not seen before. There were just shrubs which seemed to beagitated by a soft wind: They rippled.\"It's here,\" don Juan said.At that moment I felt a blast of air in my face. It seemed that the wind hadactually begun to blow after we stood up. I could not believe it. There had tobe a logical explanation for it.Don Juan chuckled softly, and told me not to tax my brain trying to reason itout.\"Let's go gather the shrubs once more,\" he said. \"I hate to do this to theselittle plants, but we must stop you.\"He picked up the branches we had used to cover ourselves, and piled small rocksand dirt over them. Then, repeating the same movements we had made before, eachof us gathered eight new branches.In the meantime the wind kept on blowing ceaselessly. I could feel it rufflingthe hair around my ears. Don Juan whispered that once he had covered me I shouldnot make the slightest movement or sound. He very quickly put the branches overmy body and then he lay down and covered himself.We stayed in that position for about twenty minutes and during that time a mostextraordinary phenomenon occurred. The wind again changed from a hard continuousgust to a mild vibration. I held my breath, waiting for don Juan's signal.At a given moment, he gently shoved off the branches. I did the same and westood up. The hilltop was very quiet. There was only a slight, soft vibration ofleaves in the surrounding chaparral.Don Juan's eyes were fixedly staring at an area in the shrubs south of us.\"There it is again!\" he exclaimed in a loud voice.I involuntarily jumped, nearly losing my balance, and he ordered me in a loudimperative voice to look.\"What am I supposed to see?\" I asked desperately.He said that it, the wind or whatever, was like a cloud or a whorl that wasquite a way above the shrubs, twirling its way to the hilltop where we were.I saw a ripple forming on the bushes in the distance.\"There it comes,\" don Juan said in my ear. \"Look how it is searching for us.\"Right then a strong steady gust of wind hit my face as it had hit it before.This time, however, my reaction was different. I was terrified. I had not seenwhat don Juan had described, but I had seen a most eerie wave rippling theshrubs.I did not want to succumb to my fear and deliberately sought any kind ofsuitable explanation. I said to myself that there must be continuous aircurrents in the area, and don Juan, being thoroughly acquainted with the wholeregion, was not only aware of that, but was capable of mentally plotting theiroccurrence. All he had to do was to lie down, count, and wait for the wind totaper off; and once he stood up, he had only to wait again for its reoccurrence.Don Juan's voice shook me out of my mental deliberations. He was telling me thatit was time to leave. I stalled: I wanted to stay to make sure that the windwould taper off.\"I didn't see anything, don Juan,\" I said.\"You noticed something unusual though.\"\"Perhaps you should tell me again what I was supposed to see.\"\"I've already told you,\" he said. \"Something that hides in the wind and lookslike a whorl: a cloud, a mist, a face that twirls around.\"Don Juan made a gesture with his hands to depict a horizontal and a verticalmotion.\"It moves in a specific direction,\" he went on. \"It either tumbles or it twirls.A hunter must know all that in order to move correctly.\"I wanted to humour him, but he seemed to be trying so hard to make his pointthat I did not dare. He looked at me for a moment, and I moved my eyes away.\"To believe that the world is only as you think it is, is stupid,\" he said. \"Theworld is a mysterious place. Especially in the twilight.\"He pointed towards the wind with a movement of his chin.\"This can follow us,\" he said. \"It can make us tired or it might even kill us.\"\"That wind?\"\"At this time of the day, in the twilight, there is no wind. At this time thereis only power.\"We sat on the hilltop for an hour. The wind blew hard and constantly all thattime. Friday, 1961 June 30 In the late afternoon, after eating, don Juan and I moved to the area in frontof his door. I sat on my 'spot' and began working on my notes. He lay down onhis back with his hands folded over his stomach. We had stayed around the houseall day on account of the 'wind'. Don Juan explained that we had disturbed thewind deliberately, and that it was better not to fool around with it. I had evenhad to sleep covered with branches.A sudden gust of wind made don Juan get up in one incredibly agile jump.\"Damn it,\" he said. \"The wind is looking for you.\"\"I can't buy that, don Juan,\" I said, laughing. \"I really can't.\" I was notbeing stubborn. I just found it impossible to endorse the idea that the wind hadits own volition and was looking for me; or that it had actually spotted us andrushed to us on top of the hill. I said that the idea of a 'willful wind' was aview of the world that was rather simplistic.\"What is the wind then?\" he asked in a challenging tone.I patiently explained to him that masses of hot and cold air produced differentpressures, and that the pressure made the masses of air move vertically andhorizontally. It took me a long while to explain all the details of basicmeteorology.\"You mean that all there is to the wind is hot and cold air?\" he asked in a toneof bafflement.\"I'm afraid so,\" I said and silently enjoyed my triumph.Don Juan seemed to be dumbfounded. But then he looked at me and began to laughuproariously.\"Your opinions are final opinions,\" he said with a note of sarcasm. \"They arethe last word, aren't they? For a hunter, however, your opinions are pure crap.It makes no difference whether the pressure is one or two or ten. If you wouldlive out here in the wilderness, you would know that during the twilight thewind becomes power. A hunter that is worth his salt knows that, and actsaccordingly.\"\"How does he act?\"\"He uses the twilight and that power hidden in the wind.\"\"How?\"\"If it is convenient to him, the hunter hides from the power by covering himselfand remaining motionless until the twilight is gone and the power has sealed himinto its protection.\"Don Juan made a gesture of enveloping something with his hands.\"Its protection is like a...\"He paused in search of a word and I suggested 'cocoon'.\"That is right,\" he said. \"The protection of the power seals you like a cocoon.A hunter can stay out in the open and no puma or coyote or slimy bug couldbother him. A mountain lion could come up to the hunter's nose and sniff him,and if the hunter does not move, the lion would leave. I can guarantee you that.\"If the hunter, on the other hand, wants to be noticed, all he has to do is tostand on a hilltop at the time of the twilight and the power will nag him andseek him all night. Therefore, if a hunter wants to travel at night or if hewants to be kept awake, he must make himself available to the wind.\"Therein lies the secret of great hunters. To be available and unavailable atthe precise turn of the road.\"I felt a bit confused and asked him to recapitulate his point. Don Juan verypatiently explained that he had used the twilight and the wind to point out thecrucial importance of the interplay between hiding and showing oneself.\"You must learn to become deliberately available and unavailable,\" he said. \"Asyour life goes now, you are unwittingly available at all times.\"I protested. My feeling was that my life was becoming increasingly more and moresecretive. He said I had not understood his point; and that to be unavailabledid not mean to hide, or to be secretive, but to be inaccessible.\"Let me put it in another way,\" he proceeded patiently. \"It makes no differenceto hide if everyone knows that you are hiding.\"Your problems right now stem from that. When you are hiding, everyone knowsthat you are hiding, and when you are not, you are available for everyone totake a poke at you.\"I was beginning to feel threatened and hurriedly tried to defend myself.\"Don't explain yourself,\" don Juan said dryly. \"There is no need. We are fools,all of us, and you cannot be different. At one time in my life, I, like you,made myself available over and over again until there was nothing of me left foranything except perhaps crying. And that I did, just like yourself.\"Don Juan sized me up for a moment and then sighed loudly.\"I was younger than you, though,\" he went on, \"but one day I had enough and Ichanged. Let's say that one day, when I was becoming a hunter, I learned thesecret of being available and unavailable.\"I told him that his point was bypassing me. I truly could not understand what hemeant by being available. He had used the Spanish idioms 'ponerse al alcance'and 'ponerse en el medio del camino'; to put oneself within reach, and to putoneself in the middle of a trafficked way.\"You must take yourself away,\" he explained. \"You must retrieve yourself fromthe middle of a trafficked way. Your whole being is there, thus it is of no useto hide. You would only imagine that you are hidden. Being in the middle of theroad means that everyone passing by watches your comings and goings.\"His metaphor was interesting, but at the same time it was also obscure.\"You are talking in riddles,\" I said.He stared at me fixedly for a long moment and then began to hum a tune. Istraightened my back and sat attentively. I knew that when don Juan hummed aMexican tune he was about to clobber me. \"Hey,\" he said, smiling, and peering at me. \"Whatever happened to your blondefriend? That girl that you used to really like.\"I must have looked at him like a confounded idiot. He laughed with greatdelight. I did not know what to say.\"You told me about her,\" he said reassuringly.But I did not remember ever telling him about anybody, much less about a blondegirl.\"I've never mentioned anything like that to you,\" I said.\"Of course you have,\" he said as if dismissing the argument.I wanted to protest, but he stopped me, saying that it did not matter how heknew about her; that the important issue was that I had liked her.I sensed a surge of animosity towards him building up within myself.\"Don't stall,\" don Juan said dryly. \"This is a time when you should cut off yourfeelings of importance. You once had a woman, a very dear woman, and then oneday you lost her.\"I began to wonder if I had ever talked about her to don Juan. I concluded thatthere had never been an opportunity. Yet I might have. Every time he drove withme we had always talked incessantly about everything. I did not remembereverything we had talked about because I could not take notes while driving. Ifelt somehow appeased by my conclusions.I told him that he was right. There had been a very important blonde girl in mylife.\"Why isn't she with you?\" he asked.\"She left.\"\"Why?\"\"There were many reasons.\"\"There were not so many reasons. There was only one. You made yourself tooavailable.\"I earnestly wanted to know what he meant.He touched me. He seemed to be cognizant of the effect of his touch, andpuckered up his lips to hide a mischievous smile.\"Everyone knew about you two,\" he said with unshaken conviction.\"Was it wrong?\"\"It was deadly wrong. She was a fine person.\"I expressed the sincere feeling that his fishing in the dark was odious to me,especially the fact that he always made his statements with the assurance ofsomeone who had been at the scene, and had seen it all.\"But that's true,\" he said with a disarming candour. \"I have seen it all. Shewas a fine person.\"I knew that it was meaningless to argue, but I was angry with him for touchingthat sore spot in my life. I said that the girl in question was not such a fineperson after all, and that in my opinion she was rather weak.\"So are you,\" he said calmly. \"But that is not important. What counts is thatyou have looked for her everywhere. That makes her a special person in yourworld, and for a special person one should have only fine words.\"I felt embarrassed. A great sadness had begun to engulf me.\"What are you doing to me, don Juan?\" I asked. \"You always succeed in making mesad. Why?\"\"You are now indulging in sentimentality,\" he said accusingly.\"What is the point of all this, don Juan?\"\"Being inaccessible is the point,\" he declared. \"I brought up the memory of thisperson only as a means to show you directly what I couldn't show you with thewind.\"You lost her because you were accessible. You were always within her reach, andyour life was a routine one.\"\"No!\" I said. \"You're wrong. My life was never a routine.\"\"It was and it is a routine,\" he said dogmatically. \"It is an unusual routine,and that gives you the impression that it is not a routine; but I assure you itis.\"I wanted to sulk and get lost in moroseness, but somehow his eyes made me feelrestless. They seemed to push me on and on.\"The art of a hunter is to become inaccessible,\" he said. \"In the case of thatblonde girl it would've meant that you had to become a hunter and meet hersparingly; not the way you did. You stayed with her day after day, until theonly feeling that remained was boredom. True?\"I did not answer. I felt I did not have to. He was right.\"To be inaccessible means that you touch the world around you sparingly. Youdon't eat five quail; you eat one. You don't damage the plants just to make abarbecue pit. You don't expose yourself to the power of the wind unless it ismandatory. You don't use and squeeze people until they have shrivelled tonothing, especially the people you love.\"\"I have never used anyone,\" I said sincerely. But don Juan maintained that Ihad, and thus I could bluntly state that I became tired and bored with people.\"To be unavailable means that you deliberately avoid exhausting yourself andothers,\" he continued. \"It means that you are not hungry and desperate, like thepoor bastard that feels he will never eat again and devours all the food he can-all five quail!\"Don Juan was definitely hitting me below the belt. I laughed and that seemed toplease him. He touched my back lightly.\"A hunter knows he will lure game into his traps over and over again, so hedoesn't worry. To worry is to become accessible; unwittingly accessible. Andonce you worry, you cling to anything out of desperation; and once you cling,you are bound to get exhausted, or to exhaust whoever or whatever you areclinging to.\"I told him that in my day-to-day life it was inconceivable to be inaccessible.My point was, that in order to function, I had to be within reach of everyonethat had something to do with me.\"I've told you already that to be inaccessible does not mean to hide or to besecretive,\" he said calmly. \"It doesn't mean that you cannot deal with peopleeither. A hunter uses his world sparingly and with tenderness, regardless ofwhether the world might be things, or plants, or animals, or people, or power. Ahunter deals intimately with his world, and yet he is inaccessible to that sameworld.\"\"That's a contradiction,\" I said. \"He cannot be inaccessible if he is there inhis world, hour after hour, day after day.\"\"You did not understand,\" don Juan said patiently. \"He is inaccessible becausehe's not squeezing his world out of shape. He taps it lightly, stays for as longas he needs to, and then swiftly moves away leaving hardly a mark.\" =============================================================="},{"pageContent":"8. Disrupting the Routines of Life Sunday, 1961 July 16 We spent all morning watching some rodents that looked like fat squirrels. DonJuan called them water rats. He pointed out that they were very fast in gettingout of danger, but after they had outrun any predator, they had the terriblehabit of stopping, or even climbing a rock to stand on their hind legs to lookaround and groom themselves.\"They have very good eyes,\" don Juan said. \"You must move only when they are onthe run. Therefore, you must learn to predict when and where they will stop sothat you would also stop at the same time.\"I became engrossed in observing them and I had what would have been a field dayfor hunters as I spotted so many of them; and finally, I could predict theirmovements almost every time.Don Juan then showed me how to make traps to catch them. He explained that ahunter had to take time to observe their eating or their nesting places in orderto determine where to locate his traps. He would then set them during the night,and all he had to do the next day was to scare them off so they would scatteraway into his catching devices.We gathered some sticks and proceeded to build the hunting contraptions. I hadmine almost finished, and was excitedly wondering whether or not it would work,when suddenly don Juan stopped and looked at his left wrist as if he werechecking a watch which he had never had. He said that according to his timepieceit was lunchtime.I was holding a long stick which I was trying to make into a hoop by bending itin a circle. I automatically put it down with the rest of my huntingparaphernalia.Don Juan looked at me with an expression of curiosity. Then he made the wailingsound of a factory siren at lunchtime. I laughed. His siren sound was perfect. Iwalked towards him, and noticed that he was staring at me. He shook his headfrom side to side.\"I'll be damned,\" he said.\"What's wrong?\" I asked.He again made the long wailing sound of a factory whistle. \"Lunch is over,\" hesaid. \"Go back to work.\"I felt confused for an instant, but then I thought that he was joking, perhapsbecause we really had nothing to make lunch with. I had been so engrossed withthe rodents that I had forgotten we had no provisions. I picked up the stickagain, and tried to bend it. After a moment don Juan again blew his 'whistle'.\"Time to go home,\" he said.He examined his imaginary watch, and then looked at me and winked.\"It's five o'clock,\" he said with an air of someone revealing a secret.I thought that he had suddenly become fed up with hunting and was calling thewhole thing off. I simply put everything down and began to get ready to leave. Idid not look at him. I presumed that he also was preparing his gear. When I wasthrough I looked up and saw him sitting cross-legged a few feet away.\"I'm through,\" I said. \"We can go anytime.\"He got up and climbed a rock. He stood there, five or six feet above the ground,looking at me. He put his hands on either side of his mouth, and made a veryprolonged and piercing sound. It was like a magnified factory siren. He turnedaround in a complete circle, making the wailing sound.\"What are you doing, don Juan?\" I asked.He said that he was giving the signal for the whole world to go home. I wascompletely baffled. I could not figure out whether he was joking, or whether hehad simply flipped his lid. I watched him intently and tried to relate what hewas doing to something he may have said before. We had hardly talked at allduring the morning and I could not remember anything of importance.Don Juan was still standing on top of the rock. He looked at me, smiled andwinked again. I suddenly became alarmed. Don Juan put his hands on both sides ofhis mouth and let out another long whistle-like sound.He said that it was eight o'clock in the morning, and that I had to set up mygear again because we had a whole day ahead of us.I was completely confused by then. In a matter of minutes my fear had mounted toan irresistible desire to run away from the scene. I thought don Juan was crazy.I was about to flee when he slid down from the rock, and came to me, smiling.\"You think I'm crazy, don't you?\" he asked.I told him that he was frightening me out of my wits with his unexpectedbehaviour.He said that we were even. I did not understand what he meant. I was deeplypreoccupied with the thought that his acts seemed thoroughly insane.He explained that he had deliberately tried to scare me out of my wits with theheaviness of his unexpected behaviour because I myself was driving him up thewalls with the heaviness of my expected behaviour. He added that my routineswere as insane as his blowing his whistle.I was shocked and asserted that I did not really have any routines. I told himthat I believed my life was, in fact, a mess because of my lack of healthyroutines.Don Juan laughed and signalled me to sit down by him. The whole situation hadmysteriously changed again. My fear had vanished as soon as he had begun totalk.\"What are my routines?\" I asked.\"Everything you do is a routine.\"\"Aren't we all that way?\"\"Not all of us. I don't do things out of routine.\"\"What prompted all this, don Juan? What did I do or what did I say that made youact the way you did?\"\"You were worrying about lunch.\"\"I did not say anything to you. How did you know that I was worrying aboutlunch?\"\"You worry about eating every day around noontime, and around six in theevening, and around eight in the morning,\" he said with a malicious grin. \"Youworry about eating at those times even if you're not hungry.\"All I had to do to show your routine spirit was to blow my whistle. Your spiritis trained to work with a signal.\"He stared at me with a question in his eyes. I could not defend myself.\"Now you're getting ready to make hunting into a routine,\" he went on. \"You havealready set your pace in hunting: you talk at a certain time, eat at a certaintime, and fall asleep at a certain time.\"I had nothing to say. The way don Juan had described my eating habits was thepattern I used for everything in my life. Yet I strongly felt that my life wasless routine than that of most of my friends and acquaintances.\"You know a great deal about hunting now,\" don Juan continued. \"It'll be easyfor you to realize that a good hunter knows one thing above all: He knows theroutines of his prey. That's what makes him a good hunter.\"If you would remember the way I have proceeded in teaching you hunting, youwould perhaps understand what I mean. First I taught you how to make and set upyour traps. Then I taught you the routines of the game you were after, and thenwe tested the traps against their routines. Those parts are the outside forms ofhunting.\"Now I have to teach you the final and, by far, the most difficult part. Perhapsyears will pass before you can say that you understand it and that you're ahunter.\"Don Juan paused as if to give me time. He took off his hat, and imitated thegrooming movements of the rodents we had been observing. It was very funny tome. His round head made him look like one of those rodents.\"To be a hunter is not just to trap game,\" he went on. \"A hunter that is worthhis salt does not catch game because he sets his traps, or because he knows theroutines of his prey, but because he himself has no routines. This is hisadvantage. He is not at all like the animals he is after; fixed by heavyroutines and predictable quirks. He is free, fluid, unpredictable.\"What don Juan was saying sounded to me like an arbitrary and irrationalidealization. I could not conceive of life without routines. I wanted to be veryhonest with him and not just agree or disagree with him. I felt that what he hadin mind was not possible to accomplish by me or by anyone.\"I don't care how you feel,\" he said. \"In order to be a hunter you must disruptthe routines of your life. You have done well in hunting. You have learnedquickly, and now you can see that you are like your prey; easy to predict.\"I asked him to be specific and give me concrete examples.\"I am talking about hunting,\" he said calmly. \"Therefore I am concerned with thethings animals do: the places they eat; the place, the manner, the time theysleep; where they nest; how they walk. These are the routines I am pointing outto you so you can become aware of them in your own being.\"You have observed the habits of animals in the desert: they eat or drink atcertain places; they nest at specific spots; they leave their tracks in specificways. In fact, everything they do can be foreseen or reconstructed by a goodhunter.\"As I told you before, in my eyes you behave like your prey. Once in my lifesomeone pointed out the same thing to me, so you're not unique in that. All ofus behave like the prey we are after. That, of course, also makes us prey forsomething or someone else.\"Now, the concern of a hunter who knows all this is to stop being a preyhimself. Do you see what I mean?\"I again expressed the opinion that his proposition was unattainable.\"It takes time,\" don Juan said. \"You could begin by not eating I lunch everysingle day at twelve o'clock.\"He looked at me and smiled benevolently. His expression was very funny and mademe laugh.\"There are certain animals, however, that are impossible to track,\" he went on.\"There are certain types of deer, for instance, which a fortunate hunter mightbe able to come across, by sheer luck, once in his lifetime.\"Don Juan paused dramatically and looked at me piercingly. He seemed to bewaiting for a question, but I did not have any.\"What do you think makes them so difficult to find and so unique?\" he asked.I shrugged my shoulders because I did not know what to say.\"They have no routines,\" he said in a tone of revelation. \"That's what makesthem magical.\"\"A deer has to sleep at night,\" I said. \"Isn't that a routine?\"\"Certainly, if the deer sleeps every night at a specific time and in onespecific place. But those magical beings do not behave like that. In fact,someday you may verify this for yourself. Perhaps it'll be your fate to chaseone of them for the rest of your life.\"\"What do you mean by that?\"\"You like hunting: Perhaps someday, in some place in the world, your path maycross the path of a magical being and you might go after it.\"A magical being is a sight to behold. I was fortunate enough to cross pathswith one. Our encounter took place after I had learned and practised a greatdeal of hunting.\"Once, I was in a forest of thick trees in the mountains of central Mexico whensuddenly I heard a sweet whistle. It was unknown to me. Never in all my years ofroaming in the wilderness had I heard such a sound. I could not place it in theterrain. It seemed to come from different places. I thought that perhaps I wassurrounded by a herd or a pack of some unknown animals.\"I heard the tantalizing whistle once more. It seemed to come from everywhere. Irealized then my good fortune. I knew it was a magical being; a deer. I alsoknew that a magical deer is aware of the routines of ordinary men and theroutines of hunters.\"It is very easy to figure out what an average man would do in a situation likethat. First of all his fear would immediately turn him into a prey. Once hebecomes a prey, he has two courses of action left. He either flees or he makeshis stand. If he is not armed he would ordinarily flee into the open field torun for his life. If he is armed, he could get his weapon ready, and would thenmake his stand either by freezing on the spot, or by dropping to the ground.\"A hunter, on the other hand, when he stalks in the wilderness would never walkinto any place without figuring out his points of protection. Therefore, hewould immediately take cover. He might drop his poncho on the ground, or hemight hang it from a branch as a decoy; and then he would hide and wait untilthe game makes its next move.\"So, in the presence of the magical deer, I didn't behave like either. I quicklystood on my head, and began to wail softly. I actually wept tears and sobbed forsuch a long time that I was about to faint.\"Suddenly I felt a soft breeze. Something was sniffing my hair behind my rightear. I tried to turn my head to see what it was and tumbled down. I sat up andsaw a radiant creature staring at me. The deer looked at me, and I told him Iwould not harm him. Then the deer talked to me.\"Don Juan stopped and looked at me. I smiled involuntarily. The idea of a talkingdeer was quite incredible, to put it mildly.\"He talked to me,\" don Juan said with a grin.\"The deer talked?\"\"He did.\"Don Juan stood, and picked up his bundle of hunting paraphernalia.\"Did it really talk?\" I asked in a tone of perplexity.Don Juan roared with laughter.\"What did it say?\" I asked half in jest.I thought he was pulling my leg. Don Juan was quiet for a moment as if he weretrying to remember. Then his eyes brightened as he told me what the deer hadsaid.\"The magical deer said, 'Hello friend,'\" don Juan went on. \"And I answered,'Hello.' Then he asked me, 'Why are you crying?' and I said, 'Because I'm sad.'Then the magical creature came to my ear and said as clearly as I am speakingnow, 'Don't be sad.'\"Don Juan stared into my eyes. He had a glint of sheer mischievousness. He beganto laugh uproariously.I said that his dialogue with the deer had been sort of dumb.\"What did you expect?\" he asked, still laughing. \"I'm an Indian.\"His sense of humour was so outlandish that all I could do was laugh with him.\"You don't believe that a magical deer talks, do you?\"\"I'm sorry but I just can't believe things like that can happen,\" I said.\"I don't blame you,\" he said reassuringly. \"It's one of the darndest things.\" ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"9. The Last Battle on Earth Monday, 1961 July 24 Around mid-afternoon, after we had roamed for hours in the desert, don Juanchose a place to rest in a shaded area. As soon as we sat down he began talking.He said that I had learned a great deal about hunting, but I had not changed asmuch as he had wished.\"It's not enough to know how to make and set up traps,\" he said. \"A hunter mustlive as a hunter in order to draw the most out of his life. Unfortunately,changes are difficult and happen very slowly. Sometimes it takes years for a manto become convinced of the need to change. It took me years, but maybe I didn'thave a knack for hunting. I think for me the most difficult thing was to reallywant to change.\"I assured him that I understood his point. In fact, since he had begun to teachme how to hunt, I also had begun to reassess my actions. Perhaps the mostdramatic discovery for me was that I liked don Juan's ways. I liked don Juan asa person. There was something solid about his behaviour. The way he conductedhimself left no doubts about his mastery, and yet he had never exercised hisadvantage to demand anything from me.His interest in changing my way of life, I felt, was akin to an impersonalsuggestion, or perhaps it was akin to an authoritative commentary on myfailures. He had made me very aware of my failings, yet I could not see how hisways would remedy anything in me. I sincerely believed that, in light of what Iwanted to do in my life, his ways would have only brought me misery andhardship; hence the impasse. However, I had learned to respect his mastery,which had always been expressed in terms of beauty and precision.\"I have decided to shift my tactics,\" he said.I asked him to explain. His statement was vague and I was not sure whether ornot he was referring to me.\"A good hunter changes his ways as often as he needs,\" he replied. \"You knowthat yourself.\"\"What do you have in mind, don Juan?\"\"A hunter must not only know about the habits of his prey, he also must knowthat there are powers on this earth that guide men and animals and everythingthat is living.\"He stopped talking. I waited but he seemed to have come to the end of what hewanted to say.\"What kind of powers are you talking about?\" I asked after a long pause.\"Powers that guide our lives and our deaths.\"Don Juan stopped talking and seemed to be having tremendous difficulty indeciding what to say. He rubbed his hands and shook his head, puffing out hisjaws. Twice he signalled me to be quiet as I started to ask him to explain hiscryptic statements.\"You won't be able to stop yourself easily,\" he finally said. \"I know thatyou're stubborn, but that doesn't matter. The more stubborn you are the betterit'll be when you finally succeed in changing yourself.\"\"I am trying my best,\" I said.\"No. I disagree. You're not trying your best. You just said that because itsounds good to you. In fact, you've been saying the same thing about everythingyou do. You've been trying your best for years to no avail. Something must bedone to remedy that.\"I felt compelled, as usual, to defend myself. Don Juan seemed to aim, as a rule,at my very weakest points. I remembered then that every time I had attempted todefend myself against his criticisms I had ended up feeling like a fool. Istopped myself in the midst of a long explanatory speech.Don Juan examined me with curiosity and laughed. He said in a very kind tonethat he had already told me that all of us were fools. I was not an exception.\"You always feel compelled to explain your acts as if you were the only man onearth who's wrong,\" he said. \"It's your old feeling of importance. You have toomuch of it. You also have too much personal history. On the other hand, youdon't assume responsibility for your acts, you're not using your death as anadviser, and above all, you are too accessible. In other words, your life is asmessy as it was before I met you.\"Again I had a genuine surge of pride and wanted to argue that he was wrong. Hegestured me to be quiet.\"One must assume responsibility for being in a weird world,\" he said. \"We are ina weird world, you know.\"I nodded my head affirmatively.\"We're not talking about the same thing,\" he said. \"For you the world is weirdbecause if you're not bored with it you're at odds with it. For me the world isweird because it is: stupendous, awesome, mysterious, unfathomable.\"My interest has been to convince you that you must assume responsibility forbeing here, in this marvellous world, in this marvellous desert, in thismarvellous time. I wanted to convince you that you must learn to make every actcount since you are going to be here for only a short while; in fact, too shortfor witnessing all the marvels of it.\"I insisted that to be bored with the world or to be at odds with it was thehuman condition.\"So, change it,\" he replied dryly. \"If you do not respond to that challenge youare as good as dead.\"He dared me to name an issue- an item in my life that had engaged all mythoughts. I said art. I had always wanted to be an artist and for years I hadtried my hand at that. I still had the painful memory of my failure.\"You have never taken the responsibility for being in this unfathomable world,\"he said in an indicting tone. \"Therefore, you were never an artist, and perhapsyou'll never be a hunter.\"\"This is my best, don Juan.\"\"No. You don't know what your best is.\"\"I am doing all I can.\"\"You're wrong again. You can do better. There is one simple thing wrong withyou: You think you have plenty of time.\"He paused and looked at me as if waiting for my reaction.\"You think you have plenty of time,\" he repeated.\"Plenty of time for what, don Juan?\"\"You think your life is going to last forever.\"\"No. I don't.\"\"Then, if you don't think your life is going to last forever, what are youwaiting for? Why the hesitation to change?\"\"Has it ever occurred to you, don Juan, that I may not want to change?\"\"Yes, it has occurred to me. I did not want to change either; just like you.However, I didn't like my life. I was tired of it; just like you. Now I don'thave enough of it.\"I vehemently asserted that his insistence about changing my way of life wasfrightening and arbitrary. I said that I really agreed with him at a certainlevel, but the mere fact that he was always the master that called the shotsmade the situation untenable for me.\"You don't have time for this display, you fool,\" he said in a severe tone.\"This, whatever you're doing now, may be your last act on earth. It may verywell be your last battle. There is no power which could guarantee that you aregoing to live one more minute.\"\"I know that,\" I said with contained anger.\"No. You don't. If you knew that you would be a hunter.\"I contended that I was aware of my impending death, but that it was useless totalk or think about it since I could not do anything to avoid it.Don Juan laughed and said I was like a comedian going mechanically through aroutine.\"If this were your last battle on earth, I would say that you are an idiot,\" hesaid calmly. \"You are wasting your last act on earth in some stupid mood.\"We were quiet for a moment. My thoughts ran rampant. He was of course right.\"You have no time, my friend, no time. None of us have time,\" he said.\"I agree, don Juan, but-\"\"Don't just agree with me,\" he snapped. \"You must, instead of agreeing soeasily, act upon it. Take the challenge. Change.\"\"Just like that?\"\"That's right. The change I'm talking about never takes place by degrees. Ithappens suddenly. And you are not preparing yourself for that sudden act thatwill bring a total change.\"I believed he was expressing a contradiction. I explained to him that, if I werepreparing myself to change, I was certainly changing by degrees.\"You haven't changed at all,\" he said. \"That is why you believe you're changinglittle by little. Yet, perhaps you will surprise yourself someday by changingsuddenly and without a single warning. I know this is so, and thus I don't losesight of my interest in convincing you.\"I could not persist in my arguing. I was not sure of what I really wanted tosay. After a moment's pause don Juan went on explaining his point.\"Perhaps I should put it in a different way,\" he said. \"What I recommend you todo is to notice that we do not have any assurance that our lives will go onindefinitely. I have just said that change comes suddenly and unexpectedly, andso does death. What do you think we can do about it?\"I thought he was asking a rhetorical question, but he made a gesture with hiseyebrows urging me to answer.\"To live as happily as possible,\" I said.\"Right! But do you know anyone who lives happily?\"My first impulse was to say yes. I thought I could use a number of people I knewas examples. On second thought, however, I knew my effort would only be an emptyattempt at exonerating [* exonerating- pronouncing not guilty of charges]myself.\"No,\" I said. \"I really don't.\"\"I do,\" don Juan said. \"There are some people who are very careful about thenature of their acts. Their happiness is to act with the full knowledge thatthey don't have time. Therefore, their acts have a peculiar power; their actshave a sense of...\"Don Juan seemed to be at a loss for words. He scratched his temples and smiled.Then suddenly he stood up as if he were through with our conversation. Ibeseeched him to finish what he was telling me. He sat down and puckered up hislips.\"Acts have power,\" he said. \"Especially when the person acting knows that thoseacts are his last battle. There is a strange consuming happiness in acting withthe full knowledge that whatever one is doing may very well be one's last act onearth. I recommend that you reconsider your life and bring your acts into thatlight.\"I disagreed with him. Happiness for me was to assume that there was an inherentcontinuity to my acts; and that I would be able to continue doing, at will,whatever I was doing at the moment, especially if I was enjoying it. I told himthat my disagreement was not a banal [* banal- repeated too often; overfamiliarthrough overuse] one, but stemmed from the conviction that the world and myselfhad a determinable continuity.Don Juan seemed to be amused by my efforts to make sense. He laughed, shook hishead, and scratched his hair. Finally, when I talked about a 'determinablecontinuity', he threw his hat to the ground and stamped on it.I ended up laughing at his clowning.\"You don't have time, my friend,\" he said. \"That is the misfortune of humanbeings. None of us have sufficient time, and your continuity has no meaning inthis awesome, mysterious world.\"Your continuity only makes you timid,\" he said. \"Your acts cannot possibly havethe flair, the power, and the compelling force of the acts performed by a manwho knows that he is fighting his last battle on earth. In other words, yourcontinuity does not make you happy or powerful.\"I admitted that I was afraid of thinking I was going to die, and I accused himof causing great apprehension in me with his constant talk and concern aboutdeath.\"But we are all going to die,\" he said.He pointed towards some hills in the distance.\"There is something out there waiting for me, for sure; and I will join it, alsofor sure. But perhaps you're different, and death is not waiting for you atall.\"He laughed at my gesture of despair.\"I don't want to think about it, don Juan.\"\"Why not?\"\"It is meaningless. If it is out there waiting for me, why should I worry aboutit?\"\"I didn't say that you have to worry about it.\"\"What am I supposed to do then?\"\"Use it. Focus your attention on the link between you and your death withoutremorse or sadness or worrying. Focus your attention on the fact you don't havetime, and let your acts flow accordingly. Let each of your acts be your lastbattle on earth. Only under those conditions will your acts have their rightfulpower. Otherwise they will be, for as long as you live, the acts of a timidman.\"\"Is it so terrible to be a timid man?\"\"No it isn't if you are going to be immortal. But if you are going to die, thereis no time for timidity simply because timidity makes you cling to somethingthat exists only in your thoughts.\"That which you cling to soothes you while everything is at a lull, but then theawesome and mysterious world will open its mouth for you, as it will open forevery one of us; and then you will realize that your sure ways were not sure atall. Being timid prevents us from examining and exploiting our lot as men.\"\"It is not natural to live with the constant idea of our death, don Juan.\"\"Our death is waiting, and this very act we're performing now may well be ourlast battle on earth,\" he replied in a solemn voice.\"I call it a battle because it is a struggle. Most people move from act to actwithout any struggle or thought. A hunter, on the contrary, assesses every act;and since he has an intimate knowledge of his death, he proceeds judiciously asif every act were his last battle.\"Only a fool would fail to notice the advantage a hunter has over his fellowmen. A hunter gives his last battle its due respect. It's only natural that hislast act on earth should be the best of himself. It's pleasurable that way. Itdulls the edge of his fright.\"\"You are right,\" I conceded. \"It's just hard to accept.\"\"It'll take years for you to convince yourself, and then it'll take years foryou to act accordingly. I only hope you have time left.\"\"I get scared when you say that,\" I said.Don Juan examined me with a serious expression on his face.\"I've told you, this is a weird world,\" he said. \"The forces that guide men areunpredictable, awesome, yet their splendour is something to witness.\"He stopped talking and looked at me again. He seemed to be on the verge ofrevealing something to me, but he checked himself and smiled.\"Is there something that guides us?\" I asked.\"Certainly. There are powers that guide us.\"\"Can you describe them?\"\"Not really, except to call them forces, spirits, airs, winds, or anything likethat.\"I wanted to probe him further, but before I could ask anything else, he stoodup. I stared at him, flabbergasted. He had stood up in one single movement. Hisbody had simply jerked up, and he was on his feet.I was still pondering upon the unusual skill that would be needed in order tomove with such speed, when he told me in a dry tone of command to stalk arabbit, catch it, kill it, skin it, and roast the meat before the twilight.He looked up at the sky and said that I might have enough time. I automatically started off, proceeding the way I had done scores of times. DonJuan walked beside me, and followed my movements with a scrutinizing look. I wasvery calm and moved carefully, and I had no trouble at all in catching a malerabbit.\"Now kill it,\" don Juan said dryly.I reached into the trap to grab hold of the rabbit. I had it by the ears and waspulling it out when a sudden sensation of terror invaded me. For the first timesince don Juan had begun to teach me to hunt, it occurred to me that he hadnever taught me how to kill game. In the scores of times we had roamed in thedesert, he himself had only killed one rabbit, two quail, and one rattlesnake.I dropped the rabbit, and looked at don Juan. \"I can't kill it,\" I said.\"Why not?\"\"I've never done that.\"\"But you've killed hundreds of birds and other animals.\"\"With a gun, not with my bare hands.\"\"What difference does it make? This rabbit's time is up.\"Don Juan's tone shocked me. It was so authoritative and so knowledgeable that itleft no doubts in my mind that he knew that the rabbit's time was up.\"Kill it!\" he commanded with a ferocious look in his eyes.\"I can't.\"He yelled at me that the rabbit had to die. He said that its roaming in thatbeautiful desert had come to an end. I had no business stalling because thepower or the spirit that guides rabbits had led that particular one into my trapright at the edge of the twilight.A series of confusing thoughts and feelings overtook me as if the feelings hadbeen out there waiting for me. I felt with agonizing clarity the rabbit'stragedy; to have fallen into my trap. In a matter of seconds my mind sweptacross the most crucial moments of my own life; the many times I had been therabbit myself.I looked at it, and it looked at me. The rabbit had backed up against the sideof the cage. It was almost curled up, very quiet and motionless. We exchanged asombre glance, and that glance, which I fancied to be of silent despair,cemented a complete identification on my part.\"The hell with it,\" I said loudly. \"I won't kill anything. That rabbit goesfree.\"A profound emotion made me shiver. My arms trembled as I tried to grab therabbit by the ears. It moved fast and I missed. I again tried and fumbled oncemore.I became desperate. I had the sensation of nausea, and quickly kicked the trapin order to smash it and let the rabbit go free.The cage was unsuspectedly strong, and did not break as I thought it would. Mydespair mounted to an unbearable feeling of anguish. Using all my strength, Istamped on the edge of the cage with my right foot. The sticks cracked loudly.I pulled the rabbit out. I had a moment of relief which was shattered to bits inthe next instant. The rabbit hung limp in my hand. It was dead.I did not know what to do. I became preoccupied with finding out how it haddied.I turned to don Juan. He was staring at me. A feeling of terror sent a chillthrough my body.I sat down by some rocks. I had a terrible headache. Don Juan put his hand on myhead, and whispered in my ear that I had to skin the rabbit and roast it beforethe twilight was over.I felt nauseated.Don Juan very patiently talked to me as if he were talking to a child. He saidthat the powers that guided men or animals had led that particular rabbit to mein the same way they will lead me to my own death. He said the rabbit's deathhad been a gift for me in exactly the same way my own death will be a gift forsomething else.I was dizzy. The simple events of that day had crushed me. I tried to think thatit was only a rabbit. I could not, however, shake off the uncanny identificationI had had with it.Don Juan said that I needed to eat some of its meat, if only a morsel, in orderto validate my finding.\"I can't do that,\" I protested meekly.\"We are dregs in the hands of those forces,\" he snapped at me. \"So stop yourself-importance, and use this gift properly.\"I picked up the rabbit. It was warm.Don Juan leaned over and whispered in my ear, \"Your trap was his last battle onearth. I told you he had no more time to roam in this marvellous desert.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"10. Becoming Accessible to Power Thursday, 1961 August 17 As soon as I got out of my car, I complained to don Juan that I was not feelingwell.\"Sit down, sit down,\" he said softly and almost led me by the hand to his porch.He smiled and patted me on the back.Two weeks earlier on August 4, don Juan changed his tactics with me, as he hadsaid, and allowed me to ingest some peyote buttons. During the height of myhallucinatory experience I played with a dog that lived in the house where thepeyote session took place.Don Juan told me he had interpreted my interaction with the dog as a veryspecial event. He contended that at moments of power such as the one I had beenliving during the peyote session, the world of ordinary affairs did not exist,and nothing could be taken for granted; that the dog was not really a dog, butthe incarnation [* incarnation- the act of attributing human characteristics toa non-human thing] of Mescalito; the power or deity contained in peyote.The post-effects of that experience were a general sense of fatigue andmelancholy, plus the incidence of exceptionally vivid dreams and nightmares.\"Where's your writing gear?\" don Juan asked as I sat down on the porch.I had left my notebooks in my car. Don Juan walked back to the car and carefullypulled out my briefcase and brought it to my side.He asked if I usually carried my briefcase when I walked. I said I did.\"That's madness,\" he said. \"I've told you never to carry anything in your handswhen you walk. Get a knapsack.\"I laughed. The idea of carrying my notes in a knapsack was ludicrous. I told himthat ordinarily I wore a suit; and a knapsack over a three-piece suit would be apreposterous sight.\"Put your coat on over the knapsack,\" he said. \"It is better that people thinkyou're a hunchback than to ruin your body carrying all this around.\"He urged me to get out my notebook and write. He seemed to be making adeliberate effort to put me at ease.I complained again about the feeling of physical discomfort and the strangesense of unhappiness I was experiencing.Don Juan laughed and said, \"You're beginning to learn.\"We then had a long conversation. He said that Mescalito, by allowing me to playwith him, had pointed me out as a 'chosen man'; and that, although he wasbaffled by the omen because I was not an Indian, he was going to pass on to mesome secret knowledge. He said that he had had a 'benefactor' himself who taughthim how to become a 'man of knowledge'.I sensed that something dreadful was about to happen. The revelation that I wasdon Juan's chosen man, the unquestionable strangeness of his ways, and thedevastating effect that peyote had had on me all created a state of unbearableapprehension and indecision.But don Juan disregarded my feelings and recommended that I should only think ofthe wonder of Mescalito playing with me.\"Think about nothing else,\" he said. \"The rest will come to you of itself.\"He stood up and patted me gently on the head and said in a very soft voice, \"Iam going to teach you how to become a warrior in the same manner I have taughtyou how to hunt. I must warn you, though, just as learning how to hunt has notmade you into a hunter, nor will simply learning how to become a warrior makeyou one.\"I experienced a sense of frustration; a physical discomfort that bordered onanguish. I complained about the vivid dreams and nightmares I was having. DonJuan seemed to deliberate for a moment, and sat down again.\"They're weird dreams,\" I said.\"You've always had weird dreams,\" he retorted.\"I'm telling you, this time they are truly more weird than anything I've everhad.\"\"Don't concern yourself. They are only dreams. Like the dreams of any ordinarydreamer, they don't have power. So what's the use of worrying about them ortalking about them?\"\"They bother me, don Juan. Isn't there something I can do to stop them?\"\"Nothing. Let them pass,\" he said. \"Now it's time for you to become accessibleto power, and you are going to begin by tackling 'dreaming'.\"The tone of voice he used when he said dreaming made me think that he was usingthe word in a very particular fashion. I was pondering about a proper questionto ask when he began to talk again.\"I've never told you about dreaming, because until now I was only concerned withteaching you how to be a hunter,\" he said. \"A hunter is not concerned with themanipulation of power, therefore his dreams are only dreams. They might bepoignant, but they are not dreaming.\"A warrior, on the other hand, seeks power, and one of the avenues to power isdreaming. You may say that the difference between a hunter and a warrior is thata warrior is on his way to power, while a hunter knows nothing or very littleabout it.\"The decision as to who can be a warrior and who can only be a hunter is not upto us. That decision is in the realm of the powers that guide men.\"That's why your playing with Mescalito was such an important omen. Those forcesguided you to me. They took you to that bus depot, remember? Some clown broughtyou to me. A perfect omen. A clown pointing you out. So, I taught you how to bea hunter. And then the other perfect omen. Mescalito himself playing with you.See what I mean?\"His weird logic was overwhelming. His words created visions of myself succumbingto something awesome and unknown; something which I had not bargained for, andwhich I had not conceived existed even in my wildest fantasies.\"What do you propose I should do?\" I asked.\"Become accessible to power: Tackle your dreams,\" he replied, \"You call themdreams because you have no power. A warrior, being a man who seeks power,doesn't call them dreams. He calls them real.\"\"You mean he takes his dreams as being reality?\"\"He doesn't take anything as being anything else. What you call dreams are realfor a warrior.\"You must understand that a warrior is not a fool. A warrior is an immaculatehunter who hunts power. He's not drunk, or crazed, and he has neither the timenor the disposition to bluff, or to lie to himself, or to make a wrong move. Thestakes are too high for that. The stakes are his trimmed orderly life which hehas taken so long to tighten and perfect.\"He is not going to throw that away by making some stupid miscalculation; bytaking something for being something else.\"Dreaming is real for a warrior because in it he can act deliberately. He canchoose and reject. He can select from a variety of items those which lead topower; and then he can manipulate them and use them; while in an ordinary dream,he cannot act deliberately.\"\"Do you mean then, don Juan, that dreaming is real?\"\"Of course it is real.\"\"As real as what we are doing now?\"\"If you want to compare things, I can say that it is perhaps more real. Indreaming you have power. You can change things. You may find out countlessconcealed facts. You can control whatever you want.\" Don Juan's premises always had appealed to me at a certain level. I could easilyunderstand his liking the idea that one could do anything in dreams, but I couldnot take him seriously. The jump was too great.We looked at each other for a moment. His statements seemed insane; and yet, hewas, to the best of my knowledge, one of the most level-headed men I had evermet.I told him that I could not believe he took his dreams to be reality. Hechuckled as if he knew the magnitude of my untenable [* untenable- incapable ofbeing defended] position. Then he stood up without saying a word, and walkedinside his house.I sat for a long time in a state of stupor until he called me to the back of hishouse. He had made some corn gruel and handed me a bowl.I asked him about the time when one was awake. I wanted to know if he called itanything in particular, but he did not understand or did not want to answer.\"What do you call this, what we're doing now?\" I asked, meaning that what wewere doing was reality as opposed to dreams.\"I call it eating,\" he said and contained his laughter.\"I call it reality,\" I said. \"Because our eating is actually taking place.\"\"Dreaming also takes place,\" he replied, giggling. \"And so does hunting,walking, laughing.\"I did not persist in arguing. I could not, however, even if I stretched myselfbeyond my limits, accept his premise. He seemed to be delighted with my despair.As soon as we had finished eating, he casually stated that we were going to gofor a hike; but that we were not going to roam in the desert in the manner wehad done before.\"It's different this time,\" he said. \"From now on we're going to places ofpower. You're going to learn how to make yourself accessible to power.\"I again expressed my turmoil. I said I was not qualified for that endeavour.\"Come on, you're indulging in silly fears,\" he said in a low voice, patting meon the back and smiling benevolently. \"I've been catering to your hunter'sspirit. You like to roam with me in this beautiful desert. It's too late for youto quit.\"He began to walk into the desert chaparral. He signalled me with his head tofollow him.I could have walked to my car and left, except that I liked to roam in thatbeautiful desert with him. I liked the sensation which I experienced only in hiscompany; that this was indeed an awesome, mysterious, yet beautiful world. As hesaid, I was hooked. Don Juan led me to the hills towards the east. It was a long hike. It was a hotday. The heat, however, which ordinarily would have been unbearable to me wassomehow unnoticeable.We walked for quite a distance into a canyon until don Juan came to a halt andsat down in the shade of some boulders. I took some crackers out of my knapsack,but he told me not to bother with them.He said that I should sit in a prominent place. He pointed to a single almostround boulder ten or fifteen feet away and helped me climb to the top. I thoughthe was also going to sit there, but instead he just climbed part of the way inorder to hand me some pieces of dry meat. He told me with a deadly seriousexpression that it was power meat and should be chewed very slowly, and shouldnot be mixed with any other food. He then walked back to the shaded area, andsat down with his back against a rock.He seemed relaxed, almost sleepy. He remained in the same position until I hadfinished eating. Then he sat up straight, and tilted his head to the right. Heseemed to be listening attentively. He glanced at me two or three times, stoodup abruptly, and began to scan the surroundings with his eyes the way a hunterwould do.I automatically froze on the spot and only moved my eyes in order to follow hismovements. Very carefully he stepped behind some rocks, as if he were expectinggame to come into the area where we were. I realized then that we were in around covelike bend in the dry water canyon, surrounded by sandstone boulders.Don Juan suddenly came out from behind the rocks and smiled at me. He stretchedhis arms, yawned, and walked towards the boulder where I was. I relaxed my tenseposition and sat down.\"What happened?\" I asked in a whisper. He answered me, yelling, that there wasnothing around there to worry about.I felt an immediate jolt in my stomach. His answer was inappropriate; and it wasinconceivable to me that he would yell unless he had a specific reason for it.I began to slide down from the boulder, but he yelled that I should stay there awhile longer.\"What are you doing?\" I asked.He sat down and concealed himself between two rocks at the base of the boulderwhere I was, and then he said in a very loud voice that he had only been lookingaround because he thought he had heard something.I asked if he had heard a large animal. He put his hand to his ear and yelledthat he was unable to hear me, and that I should shout my words. I felt ill atease yelling, but he urged me in a loud voice to speak up.I shouted that I wanted to know what was going on, and he shouted back thatthere was really nothing around there. He yelled, asking if I could see anythingunusual from the top of the boulder. I said no, and he asked me to describe tohim the terrain towards the south.We shouted back and forth for a while, and then he signalled me to come down. Ijoined him and he whispered in my ear that the yelling was necessary to make ourpresence known because I had to make myself accessible to the power of thatspecific water hole.I looked around but I could not see the water hole. He pointed out that we werestanding on it.\"There's water here,\" he said in a whisper, \"and also power. There's a spirithere and we have to lure it out; perhaps it will come after you.\"I wanted to know more about the alleged spirit, but he insisted on totalsilence. He advised me to stay perfectly still, and not let out a whisper ormake the slightest movement to betray our presence.Apparently it was easy for him to remain in complete immobility for hours. Forme, however, it was sheer torture. My legs fell asleep, my back ached, andtension built up around my neck and shoulders. My entire body became numb andcold. I was in great discomfort when don Juan finally stood up. He just sprangto his feet, and extended his hand to me to help me stand up.As I was trying to stretch my legs, I realized the inconceivable easiness withwhich don Juan had jumped up after hours of immobility. It took quite some timefor my muscles to regain the elasticity needed for walking.Don Juan headed back for the house. He walked extremely slowly. He set up alength of three paces as the distance I should observe in following him. Hemeandered around the regular route, and crossed it four or five times indifferent directions. When we finally arrived at his house, it was lateafternoon.I tried to question him about the events of the day. He explained that talkingwas unnecessary. For the time being, I had to refrain from asking questionsuntil we were in a place of power.I was dying to know what he meant by that and I tried to whisper a question, buthe reminded me with a cold severe look that he meant business.We sat on his porch for hours. I worked on my notes. From time to time he handedme a piece of dry meat. Finally, it was too dark to write. I tried to thinkabout the new developments, but some part of myself refused to and I fellasleep. Saturday, 1961 August 19 Yesterday morning don Juan and I drove to town, and ate breakfast at arestaurant. He advised me not to change my eating habits too drastically.\"Your body is not used to power meat,\" he said. \"You'd get sick if you didn'teat your food.\"He himself ate heartily. When I joked about it, he simply said, \"My body likeseverything.\"Around noon, we hiked back to the water canyon. We proceeded to make ourselvesnoticeable to the spirit by 'noisy talk' and by a forced silence which lastedhours.When we left the place, instead of heading back to the house, don Juan took offin the direction of the mountains. We reached some mild slopes first, and thenwe climbed to the top of some high hills. There don Juan picked out a spot torest in the open unshaded area.He told me that we had to wait until dusk, and that I should conduct myself inthe most natural fashion which included asking all the questions I wanted. \"Iknow that the spirit is out there lurking,\" he said in a very low voice.\"Where?\"\"Out there, in the bushes.\"\"What kind of spirit is it?\"He looked at me with a quizzical expression and retorted, \"How many kinds arethere?\"We both laughed. I was asking questions out of nervousness.\"It'll come out at dusk,\" he said. \"We just have to wait.\"I remained quiet. I had run out of questions.\"This is the time when we must keep on talking,\" he said. \"The human voiceattracts spirits. There's one lurking out there now. We are making ourselvesavailable to it, so keep on talking.\"I experienced an idiotic sense of vacuity. [* vacuity- a region that is devoidof matte] I could not think of anything to say. He laughed and patted me on theback.\"You're truly a pill,\" he said. \"When you have to talk, you lose your tongue.Come on. Beat your gums.\"He made a hilarious gesture of beating his gums together, opening and closinghis mouth with great speed.\"There are certain things we will talk about from now on only at places ofpower,\" he went on. \"I have brought you here because this is your first trial.This is a place of power, and here we can talk only about power.\"\"I really don't know what power is,\" I said.\"Power is something a warrior deals with,\" he said. \"At first it's anincredible, far-fetched affair. It is hard to even think about it. This iswhat's happening to you now.\"Then power becomes a serious matter. One may not have it, or one may not evenfully realize that it exists, yet one knows that something is there; somethingwhich was not noticeable before.\"Next power is manifested as something uncontrollable that comes to oneself. Itis not possible for me to say how it comes, or what it really is. It is nothing,and yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes.And finally, power is something in oneself; something that controls one's actsand yet obeys one's command.\" There was a short pause. Don Juan asked me if I had understood. I felt ludicroussaying I did. He seemed to have noticed my dismay and chuckled.\"I am going to teach you right here the first step to power,\" he said as if hewere dictating a letter to me. \"I am going to teach you how to set up dreaming.\"He looked at me and again asked me if I knew what he meant. I did not. I washardly following him at all. He explained that to 'set up dreaming' meant tohave a concise and pragmatic control over the general situation of a dream,comparable to the control one has over any choice in the desert, such asclimbing up a hill or remaining in the shade of a water canyon.\"You must start by doing something very simple,\" he said. \"Tonight in yourdreams you must look at your hands.\"I laughed out loud. His tone was so factual that it was as if he were telling meto do something commonplace.\"Why do you laugh?\" he asked with surprise.\"How can I look at my hands in my dreams?\"\"Very simple. Focus your eyes on them just like this.\"He bent his head forward, and stared at his hands with his mouth open. Hisgesture was so comical that I had to laugh.\"Seriously, how can you expect me to do that?\" I asked.\"The way I've told you,\" he snapped. \"You can, of course, look at whatever youplease: your toes, or your belly, or your pecker, for that matter. I said yourhands because that was the easiest thing for me to look at. Don't think it's ajoke. Dreaming is as serious as seeing or dying or any other thing in thisawesome, mysterious world.\"Think about it as something entertaining. Imagine all the inconceivable thingsyou could accomplish. A man hunting for power has almost no limits in hisdreaming.\"I asked him to give me some pointers.\"There aren't any pointers,\" he said. \"Just look at your hands.\"\"There must be more that you could tell me,\" I insisted.He shook his head, and squinted his eyes, staring at me in short glances.\"Every one of us is different,\" he finally said. \"What you call pointers wouldonly be what I myself did when I was learning. We are not the same. We aren'teven vaguely alike.\"\"Maybe anything you'd say would help me.\"\"It would be simpler for you just to start looking at your hands.\"He seemed to be organizing his thoughts, and bobbed his head up and down.\"Every time you look at anything in your dreams it changes shape,\" he said aftera long silence. \"The trick in learning to set up dreaming is obviously not justto look at things, but to sustain the sight of them. Dreaming is real when onehas succeeded in bringing everything into focus. Then there is no differencebetween what you do when you sleep, and what you do when you are not sleeping.Do you see what I mean?\"I confessed that, although I understood what he had said, I was incapable ofaccepting his premise. I brought up the point that, in a civilized world, therewere scores of people who had delusions and could not distinguish what tookplace in the real world from what took place in their fantasies. I said thatsuch persons were undoubtedly mentally ill, and that my uneasiness increasedevery time he would recommend I should act like a crazy man.After my long explanation don Juan made a comical gesture of despair by puttinghis hands to his cheeks, and sighing loudly.\"Leave your civilized world alone,\" he said. \"Let it be! Nobody is asking you tobehave like a madman. I've already told you that a warrior has to be perfect inorder to deal with the powers he hunts. How can you conceive that a warriorwould not be able to tell things apart?\"On the other hand, you, my friend, who know what the real world is, wouldfumble and die in no time at all if you would have to depend on your ability fortelling what is real and what is not.\"I obviously had not expressed what I really had in mind. Every time I protestedI was simply voicing the unbearable frustration of being in an untenableposition.\"I am not trying to make you into a sick, crazy man,\" don Juan went on. \"You cando that yourself without my help. But the forces that guide us brought you tome, and I have been endeavouring to teach you to change your stupid ways andlive the strong clean life of a hunter. Then the forces guided you again, andtold me that you should learn to live the impeccable life of a warrior.Apparently you can't. But who can tell? We are as mysterious and as awesome asthis unfathomable world, so who can tell what you're capable of?\"There was an underlying tone of sadness in don Juan's voice. I wanted toapologize, but he began to talk again.\"You don't have to look at your hands,\" he said. \"Like I've said, pick anythingat all. But pick one thing in advance, and find it in your dreams. I said yourhands because they'll always be there.\"When they begin to change shape, you must move your sight away from them andpick something else; and then look at your hands again. It takes a long time toperfect this technique.\" I had become so involved in writing that I had not noticed that it was gettingdark. The sun had already disappeared over the horizon. The sky was cloudy andthe twilight was imminent. Don Juan stood up, and gave furtive glances towardsthe south.\"Let's go,\" he said. \"We must walk south until the spirit of the water holeshows itself.\"We walked for perhaps half an hour. The terrain changed abruptly, and we came toa barren area. There was a large round hill where the chaparral had burnt. Itlooked like a bald head.We walked towards it. I thought that don Juan was going to climb the mild slope,but he stopped instead and remained in a very attentive position. His bodyseemed to have tensed as a single unit, and shivered for an instant. Then herelaxed again and stood limply. I could not figure out how his body could remainerect while his muscles were so relaxed.At that moment a very strong gust of wind jolted me. Don Juan's body turned inthe direction of the wind, towards the west. He did not use his muscles to turn;or at least he did not use them the way I would use mine to turn. Don Juan'sbody seemed rather to have been pulled from the outside. It was as if someoneelse had arranged his body to face a new direction. I kept on staring at him. Helooked at me from the corner of his eye.The expression on his face was one of determination and purpose. All of hisbeing was attentive, and I stared at him in wonder. I had never been in anysituation that called for such a strange concentration.Suddenly his body shivered as though he had been splashed by a sudden shower ofcold water. He had another jolt and then he started to walk as if nothing hadhappened.I followed him. We flanked the naked hills on the east side until we were at themiddle part of it. He stopped there, turning to face the west.From where we stood, the top of the hill was not so round and smooth as it hadseemed to be from the distance. There was a cave, or a hole, near the top. Ilooked at it fixedly because don Juan was doing the same. Another strong gust ofwind sent a chill up my spine. Don Juan turned towards the south and scanned thearea with his eyes.\"There!\" he said in a whisper and pointed to an object on the ground.I strained my eyes to see. There was something on the ground, perhaps twentyfeet away. It was light brown, and as I looked at it, it shivered. I focused allmy attention on it. The object was almost round, and seemed to be curled. Infact, it looked like a curled up dog.\"What is it?\" I whispered to don Juan.\"I don't know,\" he whispered back as he peered at the object. \"What does it looklike to you?\"I told him that it seemed to be a dog.\"Too large for a dog,\" he said matter-of-factly.I took a couple of steps towards it, but don Juan stopped me gently. I stared atit again. It was definitely some animal that was either asleep or dead. I couldalmost see its head. Its ears protruded like the ears of a wolf. By then I wasdefinitely sure that it was a curled-up animal. I thought that it could havebeen a brown calf. I whispered that to don Juan. He answered that it was toocompact to be a calf. Besides, its ears were pointed.The animal shivered again and then I noticed that it was alive. I could actuallysee that it was breathing, yet it did not seem to breathe rhythmically. Thebreaths that it took were more like irregular shivers. I had a suddenrealization at that moment.\"It's an animal that is dying,\" I whispered to don Juan.\"You're right,\" he whispered back. \"But what kind of an animal?\"I could not make out its specific features. Don Juan took a couple of cautioussteps towards it. I followed him. It was quite dark by then, and we had to taketwo more steps in order to keep the animal in view.\"Watch out,\" don Juan whispered in my ear. \"If it is a dying animal, it may leapon us with its last strength.\"The animal, whatever it was, seemed to be on its last legs. Its breathing wasirregular. Its body shook spasmodically, but it did not change its curled upposition. At a given moment, however, a tremendous spasm actually lifted theanimal off the ground. I heard an inhuman shriek and the animal stretched itslegs. Its claws were more than frightening. They were nauseating. The animaltumbled on its side after stretching its legs, and then rolled on its back.I heard a formidable growl and don Juan's voice shouting, \"Run for your life.\"And that was exactly what I did. I scrambled towards the top of the hill withunbelievable speed and agility. When I was halfway to the top, I looked back andsaw don Juan standing in the same place. He signalled me to come down. I randown the hill.\"What happened?\" I asked, completely out of breath.\"I think the animal is dead,\" he said.We advanced cautiously towards the animal. It was sprawled on its back. As Icame closer to it, I nearly yelled with fright. I realized that it was not quitedead yet. Its body was still trembling. Its legs, which were sticking up in theair, shook wildly. The animal was definitely in its last gasps.I walked in front of don Juan. A new jolt moved the animal's body and I couldsee its head. I turned to don Juan, horrified. Judging by its body, the animalwas obviously a mammal, yet it had a beak like a bird.I stared at it in complete and absolute horror. My mind refused to believe it. Iwas dumbfounded. I could not even articulate a word. Never in my whole existencehad I witnessed anything of that nature. Something inconceivable was there infront of my very eyes. I wanted don Juan to explain that incredible animal, butI could only mumble to him. He was staring at me.I glanced at him, and glanced at the animal. Then something in me arranged theworld, and I knew at once what the animal was. I walked over to it and picked itup.It was a large branch of a bush. It had been burnt, and possibly the wind hadblown some burnt debris which got caught in the dry branch; and thus gave theappearance of a large bulging round animal. The colour of the burnt debris madeit look light brown in contrast with the green vegetation. I laughed at my idiocy and excitedly explained to don Juan that the wind blowingthrough it had made it look like a live animal. I thought he would be pleasedwith the way I had resolved the mystery, but he turned around and began walkingto the top of the hill. I followed him. He crawled inside the depression thatlooked like a cave. It was not a hole but a shallow dent in the sandstone.Don Juan took some small branches and used them to scoop up the dirt that hadaccumulated in the bottom of the depression.\"We have to get rid of the ticks,\" he said.He signalled me to sit down, and told me to make myself comfortable because wewere going to spend the night there.I began to talk about the branch, but he hushed me up.\"What you've done is no triumph,\" he said. \"You've wasted a beautiful power; apower that blew life into that dry twig.\"He said that a real triumph would have been for me to let go, and to follow thepower until the world had ceased to exist. He did not seem to be angry with meor disappointed with my performance. He repeatedly stated that this was only thebeginning; that it took time to handle power. He patted me on the shoulder, andjoked that earlier that day I was the person who knew what was real and what wasnot.I felt embarrassed. I began to apologize for my tendency of always being so sureof my ways.\"It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"That branch was a real animal and it was alive atthe moment the power touched it. Since what kept it alive was power, the trickwas, like in dreaming, to sustain the sight of it. See what I mean?\"I wanted to ask something else, but he hushed me up, and said that I shouldremain completely silent but awake all night; and that he alone was going totalk for a while.He said that the spirit, which knew his voice, might become subdued with thesound of it and leave us alone. He explained that the idea of making oneselfaccessible to power had serious overtones. Power was a devastating force thatcould easily lead to one's death, and had to be treated with great care.Becoming available to power had to be done systematically, but always with greatcaution.It involved making one's presence obvious by a contained display of loud talk orany other type of noisy activity, and then it was mandatory to observe aprolonged and total silence. A controlled outburst and a controlled quietnesswere the mark of a warrior.He said that properly I should have sustained the sight of the live monster fora while longer. In a controlled fashion, without losing my mind or becomingderanged with excitation or fear, I should have striven to 'stop the world'. Hepointed out that after I had run up the hill for dear life, I was in a perfectstate for stopping the world. Combined in that state were fear, awe, power anddeath. He said that such a state would be pretty hard to repeat.I whispered in his ear, \"What do you mean by stopping the world?\"He gave me a ferocious look before he answered that it was a technique practisedby those who were hunting for power; a technique by virtue of which the world aswe know it was made to collapse. ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"11. The Mood of a Warrior I drove up to don Juan's house on Thursday, 1961 August 31, and before I evenhad a chance to greet him, he stuck his head through the window of my car,smiled at me, and said, \"We must drive quite a distance to a place of power andit's almost noon.\"He opened the door of my car, sat down next to me in the front seat, anddirected me to drive south for about seventy miles. We then turned east on to adirt road and followed it until we had reached the slopes of the mountains. Iparked my car off the road in a depression don Juan picked because it was deepenough to hide the car from view. From there we went directly to the top of thelow hills by crossing a vast flat desolate area.When it got dark don Juan selected a place to sleep. He demanded completesilence.The next day we ate frugally and continued our journey in an easterly direction.The vegetation was no longer desert shrubbery, but thick green mountain bushesand trees.Around midafternoon, we climbed to the top of a gigantic bluff of conglomeraterock which looked like a wall. Don Juan sat down and signalled me to sit downalso.\"This is a place of enlightenment,\" he said after a moment's pause. \"This is theplace where warriors were buried a long time ago.\"At that instant a crow flew right above us, cawing. Don Juan followed its flightwith a fixed gaze.I examined the rock, and was wondering how and where the warriors had beenburied when he tapped me on the shoulder.\"Not here, you fool,\" he said, smiling. \"Down there.\" He pointed to the fieldright below us at the bottom of the bluff towards the east. He explained thatthe field in question was surrounded by a natural corral of boulders.From where I was sitting I saw an area which was perhaps a hundred yards indiameter and which looked like a perfect circle. Thick bushes covered itssurface, camouflaging the boulders. I would not have noticed its perfectroundness if don Juan had not pointed it out to me.He said that there were scores of such places scattered in the old world of theIndians. They were not exactly places of power, like certain hills or landformations which were the abode of spirits, but rather places of enlightenmentwhere one could be taught; where one could find solutions to dilemmas.\"All you have to do is come here,\" he said. \"Or spend the night on this rock inorder to rearrange your feelings.\"\"Are we going to spend the night here?\"\"I thought so, but a little crow just told me not to do that.\"I tried to find out more about the crow, but he hushed me up with an impatientmovement of his hand.\"Look at that circle of boulders,\" he said. \"Fix it in your memory, and thensomeday a crow will lead you to another one of these places. The more perfectits roundness is, the greater its power.\"\"Are the warriors' bones still buried here?\"Don Juan made a comical gesture of puzzlement, and then smiled broadly.\"This is not a cemetery,\" he said. \"Nobody is buried here. I said warriors wereonce buried here. I meant they used to come here to bury themselves for a night,or for two days, or for whatever length of time they needed to.\"I did not mean dead people's bones are buried here. I'm not concerned withcemeteries. There is no power in them. There is power in the bones of a warrior,though, but they are never in cemeteries. And there is even more power in thebones of a man of knowledge, yet it would be practically impossible to findthem.\"\"Who is a man of knowledge, don Juan?\"\"Any warrior could become a man of knowledge. As I told you, a warrior is animpeccable hunter that hunts power. If he succeeds in his hunting, he can be aman of knowledge.\"\"What do you...\"He stopped my question with a movement of his hand. He stood up, signalled me tofollow, and began descending on the steep east side of the bluff. There was adefinite trail in the almost perpendicular face, leading to the round area.We slowly worked our way down the perilous path. When we reached the bottomfloor, don Juan, without stopping at all, led me through the thick chaparral tothe middle of the circle. There he used some thick dry branches to sweep a cleanspot for us to sit. The spot was also perfectly round.\"I intended to bury you here all night,\" he said, \"but I know now that it is nottime yet. You don't have power. I'm going to bury you only for a short while.\"I became very nervous with the idea of being enclosed, and asked how he wasplanning to bury me. He giggled like a child, and began collecting dry branches.He did not let me help him, and said I should sit down and wait.He threw the branches he was collecting inside the clean circle. Then he made melie down with my head towards the east, put my jacket under my head, and made acage around my body. He constructed it by sticking pieces of branches about twoand a half feet in length in the soft dirt. The branches, which ended in forks,served as supports for some long sticks that gave the cage a frame and theappearance of an open coffin. He closed the boxlike cage by placing smallbranches and leaves over the long sticks, encasing me from the shoulders down.He let my head stick out with my jacket as a pillow.He then took a thick piece of dry wood and, using it as a digging stick, heloosened the dirt around me and covered the cage with it.The frame was so solid and the leaves were so well placed that no dirt cameinside. I could move my legs freely, and I could actually slide in and out.Don Juan said that ordinarily a warrior would construct the cage, and then slipinto it and seal it from the inside.\"How about the animals?\" I asked. \"Can they scratch the surface dirt and sneakinto the cage and hurt the man?\"\"No, that's not a worry for a warrior. It's a worry for you because you have nopower. A warrior, on the other hand, is guided by his unbending purpose and canfend off anything. No rat, or snake, or mountain lion could bother him.\"\"What do they bury themselves for, don Juan?\"\"For enlightenment and for power.\"I experienced an extremely pleasant feeling of peace and satisfaction. The worldat that moment seemed at ease. The quietness was exquisite and at the same timeunnerving. I was not accustomed to that kind of silence. I tried to talk but hehushed me.After a while the tranquillity of the place affected my mood. I began to thinkof my life and my personal history, and I experienced a familiar sensation ofsadness and remorse. I told him that I did not deserve to be there; that hisworld was strong and fair, and I was weak; and that my spirit had been distortedby the circumstances of my life.He laughed and threatened to cover my head with dirt if I kept on talking inthat vein. He said that I was a man. And like any man, I deserved everythingthat was a man's lot- joy, pain, sadness and struggle- and that the nature ofone's acts was unimportant as long as one acted as a warrior.Lowering his voice to almost a whisper, he said that if I really felt that myspirit was distorted I should simply fix it- purge it, make it perfect- becausethere was no other task in our entire lives which was more worthwhile. Not tofix the spirit was to seek death, and that was the same as to seek nothing sincedeath was going to overtake us regardless of anything.He paused for a long time and then he said with a tone of profound conviction,\"To seek the perfection of the warrior's spirit is the only task worthy of ourmanhood.\"His words acted as a catalyst. I felt the weight of my past actions as anunbearable and hindering load. I admitted that there was no hope for me. I beganto weep while talking about my life. I said that I had been roaming for such along time that I had become callous to pain and sadness, except on certainoccasions when I would realize my aloneness and my helplessness.He did not say anything. He grabbed me by the armpits and pulled me out of thecage. I sat up when he let go of me. He also sat down. An uneasy silence set inbetween us. I thought he was giving me time to compose myself. I took mynotebook and scribbled out of nervousness.\"You feel like a leaf at the mercy of the wind, don't you?\" he finally said,staring at me.That was exactly the way I felt. He seemed to empathize with me. He said that mymood reminded him of a song, and he began to sing in a low tone. His singingvoice was very pleasing and the lyrics carried me away:\"I'm so far awayfrom the sky where I was born.Immense nostalgia invades my thoughts.Now that I am so alone and sadlike a leaf in the wind,sometimes I want to weep,sometimes I want to laugh with longing.\" (Que lejos estoy del cielo donde he nacido. Inmensa nostalgia invade mipensamiento. Ahora que estoy tan solo y triste cual hoja al viento, quisierallorar, quisiera reir de sentimiento.) We did not speak for a long while. He finally broke the silence.\"Since the day you were born, one way or another, someone has been doingsomething to you,\" he said.\"That's correct,\" I said.\"And they have been doing something to you against your will.\"\"True.\"\"And by now you're helpless, like a leaf in the wind.\"\"That's correct. That's the way it is.\" I said that the circumstances of my lifehad sometimes been devastating.He listened attentively; but I could not figure out whether he was just beingagreeable, or was genuinely concerned until I noticed that he was trying to hidea smile.\"No matter how much you like to feel sorry for yourself, you have to changethat,\" he said in a soft tone. \"It doesn't jibe with the life of a warrior.\"He laughed and sang the song again but contorted the intonation of certainwords. The result was a ludicrous lament. He pointed out that the reason I hadliked the song was because in my own life I had done nothing else but find flawswith everything and lament.I could not argue with him. He was correct. Yet I believed I had sufficientreason to justify my feeling of being like a leaf in the wind.\"The hardest thing in the world is to assume the mood of a warrior,\" he said.\"It is of no use to be sad and complain, and feel justified in doing so,believing that someone is always doing something to us. Nobody is doing anythingto anybody, much less to a warrior.\"You are here with me because you want to be here. You should have assumed fullresponsibility by now so that the idea that you are at the mercy of the windwould be inadmissible.\"He stood up and began to disassemble the cage. He scooped the dirt back to wherehe had gotten it from and carefully scattered all the sticks in the chaparral.Then he covered the clean circle with debris, leaving the area as if nothing hadever touched it.I commented on his proficiency. He said that a good hunter would know that wehad been there no matter how careful he had been because the tracks of men couldnot be completely erased.He sat cross-legged and told me to sit down as comfortably as possible facingthe spot where he had buried me, and to stay put until my mood of sadness haddissipated.\"A warrior buries himself in order to find power, not to weep with self-pity,\"he said.I attempted to explain, but he made me stop with an impatient movement of hishead. He said that he had to pull me out of the cage in a hurry because my moodwas intolerable, and he was afraid that the place would resent my softness andinjure me.\"Self-pity doesn't jibe with power,\" he said. \"The mood of a warrior calls forcontrol over himself and at the same time it calls for abandoning himself.\"\"How can that be?\" I asked. \"How can he control and abandon himself at the sametime?\"\"It is a difficult technique,\" he said.He seemed to deliberate whether or not to continue talking. Twice he was on theverge of saying something, but he checked himself and smiled. \"You're not overyour sadness yet,\" he said. \"You still feel weak and there is no point intalking about the mood of a warrior now.\" Almost an hour went by in complete silence. Then he abruptly asked me if I hadsucceeded in learning the dreaming techniques he had taught me. I had beenpractising assiduously [* assidously- with care and persistence] and had beenable, after a monumental effort, to obtain a degree of control over my dreams.Don Juan had been very right in saying that one could interpret the exercises asbeing entertainment. For the first time in my life, I had been looking forwardto going to sleep.I gave him a detailed report of my progress.It had been relatively easy for me to learn to sustain the image of my handsafter I had learned to command myself to look at them. My visions, although notalways of my own hands, would last a seemingly long time until I would finallylose control and would become immersed in ordinary unpredictable dreams.I had no volition whatsoever over when I would give myself the command to lookat my hands, or to look at other items of the dreams. It would just happen. At agiven moment I would remember that I had to look at my hands and then at thesurroundings. There were nights, however, when I could not recall having done itat all.He seemed to be satisfied, and wanted to know what were the usual items I hadbeen finding in my visions. I could not think of anything in particular, and Istarted elaborating on a nightmarish dream I had had the night before.\"Don't get so fancy,\" he said dryly.I told him that I had been recording all the details of my dreams. Since I hadbegun to practise looking at my hands, my dreams had become very compelling andmy sense of recall had increased to the point that I could remember minutedetails. He said that to follow them was a waste of time because details andvividness were in no way important.\"Ordinary dreams get very vivid as soon as you begin to set up dreaming,\" hesaid. \"That vividness and clarity is a formidable barrier. And you are worse offthan anyone I have ever met in my life. You have the worst mania. You write downeverything you can.\"In all fairness, I believed what I was doing was appropriate. Keeping ameticulous record of my dreams was giving me a degree of clarity about thenature of the visions I had while sleeping.\"Drop it!\" he said imperatively. \"It's not helping anything. All you're doing isdistracting yourself from the purpose of dreaming, which is control and power.\"He lay down, and covered his eyes with his hat; and talked without looking atme.\"I'm going to remind you of all the dreaming techniques you must practise,\" hesaid. \"First you must focus your gaze on your hands as the starting point. Thenshift your gaze to other items, and look at them in brief glances. Focus yourgaze on as many things as you can. Remember that if you only glance briefly, theimages do not shift. Then go back to your hands.\"Every time you look at your hands you renew the power needed for dreaming, soin the beginning don't look at too many things. Four items will suffice everytime. Later on, you may enlarge the scope until you can cover all you want, butas soon as the images begin to shift and you feel you are losing control, goback to your hands.\"When you feel you can gaze at things indefinitely, you will be ready for a newtechnique. I'm going to teach you this new technique now, but I expect you toput it to use only when you are ready.\" He was quiet for about fifteen minutes. Finally, he sat up and looked at me.\"The next step in setting up dreaming is to learn to travel,\" he said. \"The sameway you have learned to look at your hands, you can will yourself to move; to goplaces. First you have to establish a place you want to go to. Pick a well-knownspot- perhaps your school, or a park, or a friend's house- then, will yourselfto go there.\"This technique is very difficult. You must perform two tasks: You must willyourself to go to the specific locale; and then, when you have mastered thattechnique, you have to learn to control the exact time of your travelling.\"As I wrote down his statements I had the feeling that I was really nuts. I wasactually taking down insane instructions, knocking myself out in order to followthem. I experienced a surge of remorse and embarrassment.\"What are you doing to me, don Juan?\" I asked, not really meaning it.He seemed surprised. He stared at me for an instant, and then smiled.\"You've been asking me the same question over and over. I'm not doing anythingto you. You are making yourself accessible to power. You're hunting it and I'mjust guiding you.\"He tilted his head to the side and studied me. He held my chin with one hand andthe back of my head with the other and then moved my head back and forth. Themuscles of my neck were very tense and moving my head reduced the tension.Don Juan looked up to the sky for a moment, and seemed to examine something init.\"It's time to leave,\" he said dryly and stood up. We walked in an easterly direction until we came upon a patch of small trees ina valley between two large hills. It was almost five P.M. by then. He casuallysaid that we might have to spend the night in that place. He pointed to thetrees and said that there was water around there.He tensed his body and began sniffing the air like an animal. I could see themuscles of his stomach contracting in very fast short spasms as he blew andinhaled through his nose in rapid succession. He urged me to do the same andfind out by myself where the water was.I reluctantly tried to imitate him. After five or six minutes of fast breathingI was dizzy, but my nostrils had cleared out in an extraordinary way and I couldactually detect the smell of river willows. I could not tell where they were,however.Don Juan told me to rest for a few minutes and then he started me sniffingagain. The second round was more intense. I could actually distinguish a whiffof river willow coming from my right. We headed in that direction and found, agood quarter of a mile away, a swamp-like spot with stagnant water. We walkedaround it to a slightly higher flat mesa. Above and around the mesa, thechaparral was very thick.\"This place is crawling with mountain lions and other smaller cats,\" don Juansaid casually, as if it were a commonplace observation.I ran to his side and he broke out laughing.\"Usually I wouldn't come here at all,\" he said. \"But the crow pointed out thisdirection. There must be something special about it.\"\"Do we really have to be here, don Juan?\"\"We do. Otherwise I would avoid this place.\"I had become extremely nervous. He told me to listen attentively to what he hadto say.\"The only thing one can do in this place is hunt lions,\" he said. \"So I'm goingto teach you how to do that.\"There is a special way of constructing a trap for water rats that live aroundwater holes. They serve as bait. The sides of the cage are made to collapse andvery sharp spikes are put along the sides. The spikes are hidden when the trapis up and they do not affect anything unless something falls on the cage, inwhich case the sides collapse and the spikes pierce whatever hits the trap.\"I could not understand what he meant but he made a diagram on the ground andshowed me that if the side sticks of the cage were placed on pivot-like hollowspots on the frame, the cage would collapse on to either side if somethingpushed its top.The spikes were pointed sharp slivers of hard wood which were placed all aroundthe frame and fixed to it.Don Juan said that usually a heavy load of rocks was placed over a net ofsticks, which were connected to the cage and hung way above it. When themountain lion came upon the trap baited with the water rats, it would usuallytry to break it by pawing it with all its might; then the slivers would gothrough its paws and the cat, in a frenzy, would jump up, unleashing anavalanche of rocks on top of him.\"Someday you might need to catch a mountain lion,\" he said. \"They have specialpowers. They are terribly smart, and the only way to catch them is by foolingthem with pain and with the smell of river willows.\"With astounding speed and skill he assembled a trap, and after a long wait hecaught three chubby squirrel-like rodents.He told me to pick a handful of willows from the edge of the swamp and made merub my clothes with them. He did the same. Then, quickly and skillfully, he wovetwo simple carrying nets out of reeds, scooped up a large clump of green plantsand mud from the swamp, and carried it back to the mesa where he concealedhimself.In the meantime the squirrel-like rodents had begun to squeak very loudly.Don Juan spoke to me from his hiding place and told me to use the other carryingnet, gather a good chunk of mud and plants, and climb to the lower branches of atree near the trap where the rodents were.Don Juan said that he did not want to hurt the cat or the rodents, so he wasgoing to hurl the mud at the lion if it came to the trap. He told me to be onthe alert, and hit the cat with my bundle after he had in order to scare itaway. He recommended I should be extremely careful not to fall out of the tree.His final instructions were to be so still that I would merge with the branches.I could not see where don Juan was. The squealing of the rodents becameextremely loud, and finally it was so dark that I could hardly distinguish thegeneral features of the terrain.I heard a sudden and close sound of soft steps and a muffled catlike exhalation;then a very soft growl, and the rodents ceased to squeak.It was right then that I saw the dark mass of an animal right under the treewhere I was. Before I could even be sure that it was a mountain lion, it chargedagainst the trap; but before the animal reached the cage, something hit it andmade it recoil. I hurled my bundle, as don Juan had told me to do. I missed, yetit made a very loud noise. At that instant don Juan let out a series ofpenetrating yells that sent chills through my spine, and the cat, withextraordinary agility, leaped to the mesa and disappeared.Don Juan kept on making the penetrating noises a while longer. Then he told meto come down from the tree, pick up the cage with the squirrels, run up to themesa, and get to where he was as fast as I could.In an incredibly short period of time, I was standing next to don Juan. He toldme to imitate his yelling as close as possible in order to keep the lion offwhile he dismantled the cage and let the rodents free.I began to yell, but could not produce the same effect. My voice was raspybecause of the excitation.He said I had to abandon myself and yell with real feeling because the lion wasstill around. Suddenly I fully realized the situation. The lion was real. I letout a magnificent series of piercing yells.Don Juan roared with laughter.He let me yell for a moment, and then he said we had to leave the place asquietly as possible because the lion was no fool, and was probably retracing itssteps back to where we were.\"He'll follow us for sure,\" he said. \"No matter how careful we are, we'll leavea trail as wide as the Pan American highway.\"I walked very close to don Juan. From time to time he would stop for an instantand listen. At one moment he began to run in the dark and I followed him with myhands extended in front of my eyes to protect myself from the branches.We finally got to the base of the bluff where we had been earlier. Don Juan saidthat if we succeeded in climbing to the top without being mauled by the lion wewere safe. He went up first to show me the way. We started to climb in the dark.I did not know how, but I followed him with dead sure steps. When we were nearthe top I heard a peculiar animal cry. It was almost like the mooing of a cow,except that it was a bit longer and coarser.\"Up! Up!\" don Juan yelled.I scrambled to the top in total darkness ahead of don Juan. When he reached theflat top of the bluff, I was already sitting catching my breath.He rolled on the ground. I thought for a second that the exertion had been toogreat for him, but he was laughing at my speedy climb.We sat in complete silence for a couple of hours and then we started back to mycar. Sunday, 1961 September 3 Don Juan was not in the house when I woke up. I worked over my notes, and hadtime to get some firewood from the surrounding chaparral before he returned. Iwas eating when he walked into the house. He began to laugh at what he called myroutine of eating at noon, but he helped himself to my sandwiches.I told him that what had happened with the mountain lion was baffling to me. Inretrospect, it all seemed unreal. It was as if everything had been staged for mybenefit. The succession of events had been so rapid that I really had not hadtime to be afraid. I had had enough time to act, but not to deliberate upon mycircumstances. In writing my notes, the question of whether I had really seenthe mountain lion came to mind. The dry branch was still fresh in my memory.\"It was a mountain lion,\" don Juan said imperatively.\"Was it a real flesh and blood animal?\"\"Of course.\"I told him that my suspicions had been roused because of the easiness of thetotal event. It was as if the lion had been waiting out there, and had beentrained to do exactly what don Juan had planned.He was unruffled by my barrage of sceptical remarks. He laughed at me.\"You're a funny fellow,\" he said. \"You saw and heard the cat. It was right underthe tree where you were. He didn't smell you and jump at you because of theriver willows. They kill any other smell, even for cats. You had a batch of themin your lap.\"I said that it was not that I doubted him, but that everything that had happenedthat night was extremely foreign to the events of my everyday life. For a while,as I was writing my notes, I even had had the feeling that don Juan may havebeen playing the role of the lion. However, I had to discard the idea because Ihad really seen the dark shape of a four legged animal charging at the cage, andthen leaping to the mesa.\"Why do you make such a fuss?\" he said. \"It was just a big cat. There must bethousands of cats in those mountains. Big deal. As usual, you are focusing yourattention on the wrong item. It makes no difference whatsoever whether it was alion or my pants. Your feelings at that moment were what counted.\"In my entire life I had never seen or heard a big wildcat on the prowl. When Ithought of it, I could not get over the fact that I had been only a few feetaway from one.Don Juan listened patiently while I went over the entire experience.\"Why the awe for the big cat?\" he asked with an inquisitive expression. \"You'vebeen close to most of the animals that live around here and you've never been soawed by them. Do you like cats?\"\"No, I don't.\"\"Well, forget about it then. The lesson was not on how to hunt lions, anyway.\"\"What was it about?\"\"The little crow pointed out that specific spot to me, and at that spot I sawthe opportunity of making you understand how one acts while one is in the moodof a warrior.\"Everything you did last night was done within a proper mood. You werecontrolled, and at the same time abandoned when you jumped down from the tree topick up the cage and run up to me. You were not paralyzed with fear. And then,near the top of the bluff when the lion let out a scream, you moved very well.I'm sure you wouldn't believe what you did if you looked at the bluff during thedaytime.\"You had a degree of abandon, and at the same time you had a degree of controlover yourself. You did not let go and wet your pants, and yet you let go andclimbed that wall in complete darkness. You could have missed the trail andkilled yourself. To climb that wall in darkness required that you had to hold onto yourself and let go of yourself at the same time. That's what I call the moodof a warrior.\"I said that whatever I had done that night was the product of my fear, and notthe result of any mood of control and abandon.\"I know that,\" he said, smiling. \"And I wanted to show you that you can spuryourself beyond your limits if you are in the proper mood. A warrior makes hisown mood. You didn't know that. Fear got you into the mood of a warrior. But nowthat you know about it, anything can serve to get you into it.\"I wanted to argue with him, but my reasons were not clear. I felt aninexplicable sense of annoyance.\"It's convenient to always act in such a mood,\" he continued. \"It cuts throughthe crap and leaves one purified. It was a great feeling when you reached thetop of the bluff, wasn't it?\"I told him that I understood what he meant, yet I felt it would be idiotic totry to apply what he was teaching me to my everyday life.\"One needs the mood of a warrior for every single act,\" he said. \"Otherwise onebecomes distorted and ugly. There is no power in a life that lacks this mood.Look at yourself. Everything offends and upsets you. You whine and complain andfeel that everyone is making you dance to their tune. You are a leaf at themercy of the wind. There is no power in your fife. What an ugly feeling thatmust be!\"A warrior, on the other hand, is a hunter. He calculates everything. That'scontrol. But once his calculations are over, he acts. He lets go. That'sabandon. A warrior is not a leaf at the mercy of the wind. No one can push him.No one can make him do things against himself or against his better judgement. Awarrior is tuned to survive, and he survives in the best of all possiblefashions.\"I liked his stance, although I thought it was unrealistic. It seemed toosimplistic for the complex world in which I lived.He laughed at my arguments and I insisted that the mood of a warrior could notpossibly help me overcome the feeling of being offended, or actually beinginjured by the actions of my fellow men- as in the hypothetical case of beingphysically harassed by a cruel and malicious person placed in a position ofauthority.He roared with laughter and admitted the example was apropos. \"A warrior couldbe injured but not offended,\" he said. \"For a warrior there is nothing offensiveabout the acts of his fellow men as long as he himself is acting within theproper mood.\"Last night you were not offended by the lion. The fact that it chased us didnot anger you. I did not hear you cursing it, nor did I hear you say that he hadno right to follow us. It could have been a cruel and malicious lion for all youknow. But that was not a consideration while you struggled to avoid it. The onlything that was pertinent was to survive. And that you did very well.\"If you would have been alone, and the lion had caught up with you and mauledyou to death, you would have never even considered complaining or feelingoffended by its acts.\"The mood of a warrior is not so farfetched for yours or anybody's world. Youneed it in order to cut through all the guff.\"I explained my way of reasoning. The lion and my fellow men were not on a parbecause I knew the intimate quirks of men while I knew nothing about the lion.What offended me about my fellow men was that they acted maliciously andknowingly.\"I know, I know,\" don Juan said patiently. \"To achieve the mood of a warrior isnot a simple matter. It is a revolution. To regard the lion and the water ratsand our fellow men as equals is a magnificent act of the warrior's spirit. Ittakes power to do that.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"12. A Battle of Power Thursday, 1961 December 28 Don Juan and I started on a journey very early in the morning. We drove southand then east to the mountains. Don Juan had brought gourds with food and water.We ate in my car before we started walking.\"Stick close to me,\" he said. \"This is an unknown region to you, and there is noneed to take chances. You are going in search of power, and everything you docounts. Watch the wind, especially towards the end of the day. Watch when itchanges directions, and shift your position so that I always shield you fromit.\"\"What are we going to do in these mountains, don Juan?\"\"You're hunting power.\"\"I mean what are we going to do in particular?\"\"There's no plan when it comes to hunting power. Hunting power or hunting gameis the same. A hunter hunts whatever presents itself to him. Thus he must alwaysbe in a state of readiness.\"You know about the wind, and now you may hunt power in the wind by yourself.But there are other things you don't know about which are, like the wind, thecentre of power at certain times and at certain places.\"Power is a very peculiar affair,\" he said. \"It is impossible to pin it down andsay what it really is. It is a feeling that one has about certain things. Poweris personal. It belongs to oneself alone.\"My benefactor, for instance, could make a person mortally ill by merely lookingat him. Women would wane away after he had set eyes on them. Yet he did not makepeople sick all the time, but only when his personal power was involved.\"\"How did he choose who to make sick?\"\"I don't know that. He didn't know it himself. Power is like that. It commandsyou and yet it obeys you.\"A hunter of power entraps it, and then stores it away as his personal finding.Thus, personal power grows, and you may have the case of a warrior who has somuch personal power that he becomes a man of knowledge.\"\"How does one store power, don Juan?\"\"That again is another feeling. It depends on what kind of a person the warrioris. My benefactor was a man of violent nature. He stored power through thatfeeling. Everything he did was strong and direct. He left me a memory ofsomething crushing through things. Everything that happened to him took place inthat manner.\"I told him I could not understand how power was stored through a feeling.\"There's no way to explain it,\" he said after a long pause. \"You have to do ityourself.\"He picked up the gourds with food and fastened them to his back. He handed me astring with eight pieces of dry meat strung on it and made me hang it from myneck.\"This is power food,\" he said.\"What makes it power food, don Juan?\"\"It is the meat of an animal that had power. A deer, a unique deer. My personalpower brought it to me. This meat will sustain us for weeks, months if need be.Chew little bits of it at a time, and chew it thoroughly. Let the power sinkslowly into your body.\"We began to walk. It was almost eleven A.M. Don Juan reminded me once more ofthe procedure to follow.\"Watch the wind,\" he said. \"Don't let it trip you. And don't let it make youtired. Chew your power food and hide from the wind behind my body. The windwon't hurt me. We know each other very well.\" He led me to a trail that went straight to the high mountains. The day wascloudy and it was about to rain. I could see low rain clouds and fog up above inthe mountains descending into the area where we were.We hiked in complete silence until about three o'clock in the afternoon. Chewingthe dry meat was indeed invigorating. Watching for sudden changes in thedirection of the wind became a mysterious affair to the point that my entirebody seemed to sense changes before they actually happened. I had the feelingthat I could detect waves of wind as a sort of pressure on my upper chest on mybronchial tubes. Every time I was about to feel a gust of wind, my chest andthroat would itch.Don Juan stopped for a moment and looked around. He appeared to be orientinghimself and then he turned to the right. I noticed that he was also chewing drymeat. I felt very fresh, and was not tired at all. The task of being aware ofshifts in the wind had been so consuming that I had not been aware of time.We walked into a deep ravine and then up one side to a small plateau on thesheer side of an enormous mountain. We were quite high; almost to the top of themountain.Don Juan climbed a huge rock at the end of the plateau and helped me up to it.The rock was placed in such a way as to look like a dome on top of precipitous[* precipitous- extremely steep] walls. We slowly walked around it. Finally Ihad to move around the rock on my seat, holding on to the surface with my heelsand hands. I was soaked in perspiration, and had to dry my hands repeatedly.From the other side I could see a very large shallow cave near the top of themountain. It looked like a hall that had been carved out of the rock. It wassandstone which had been weathered into a sort of balcony with two pillars.Don Juan said that we were going to camp there, and that it was a very safeplace because it was too shallow to be a den for lions or any other predators;too open to be a nest for rats; and too windy for insects. He laughed and saidthat it was an ideal place for men since no other living creatures could standit.He climbed up to it like a mountain goat. I marvelled at his stupendous agility.I slowly dragged myself down the rock on my seat and then tried to run up theside of the mountain in order to reach the ledge. The last few yards completelyexhausted me. I kiddingly asked don Juan how old he really was. I thought thatin order to reach the ledge the way he had done it, one had to be extremely fitand young.\"I'm as young as I want to be,\" he said. \"This again is a matter of personalpower. If you store power, your body can perform unbelievable feats. On theother hand, if you dissipate power, you'll be a fat old man in no time at all.\"The length of the ledge was oriented along an east-west line. The open side ofthe balcony-like formation was to the south. I walked to the west end. The viewwas superb. The rain had circumvented us. It looked like a sheet of transparentmaterial hung over the low land.Don Juan said that we had enough time to build a shelter. He told me to make apile of as many rocks as I could carry on to the ledge while he gathered somebranches for a roof.In an hour he had built a wall about a foot thick on the east end of the ledge.It was about two feet long and three feet high. He wove and tied some bundles ofbranches he had collected and made a roof, securing it on to two long poles thatended in forks. There was another pole of the same length that was affixed tothe roof itself and which supported it on the opposite side of the wall. Thestructure looked like a high table with three legs.Don Juan sat cross-legged under it, on the very edge of the balcony. He told meto sit next to him, to his right. We remained quiet for a while. Don Juan broke the silence. He said in a whisper that we had to act as ifnothing was out of the ordinary. I asked if there was something in particularthat I should do. He said that I should get busy writing and do it in such a waythat it would be as if I were at my desk with no worries in the world exceptwriting.At a given moment, he was going to nudge me and then I should look where he waspointing with his eyes. He warned me that no matter what I saw I should notutter a single word. Only he could talk with impunity because he was known toall the powers in those mountains.I followed his instructions, and wrote for over an hour. I became immersed in mytask. Suddenly I felt a soft tap on my arm, and saw don Juan's eyes and headmove to point out a bank of fog about two hundred yards away which wasdescending from the top of the mountain. Don Juan whispered in my ear with atone barely audible even at that close range.\"Move your eyes back and forth along the bank of fog,\" he said, \"but don't lookat it directly. Blink your eyes and don't focus them on the fog. When you see agreen spot on the bank of fog, point it out to me with your eyes.\"I moved my eyes from left to right along the bank of fog that was slowly comingdown to us. Perhaps half an hour went by. It was getting dark. The fog movedextremely slowly. At one moment I had the sudden feeling that I had detected afaint glow to my right. At first I thought that I had seen a patch of greenshrubbery through the fog. When I looked at it directly I did not noticeanything, but when I looked without focusing I could detect a vague greenisharea.I pointed it out to don Juan. He squinted his eyes and stared at it.\"Focus your eyes on that spot,\" he whispered in my ear. \"Look without blinkinguntil you see.\"I wanted to ask what I was supposed to see, but he glared at me as if to remindme that I should not talk.I stared again. The bit of fog that had come down from above hung as if it werea piece of solid matter. It was lined up right at the spot where I had noticedthe green tint. As my eyes became tired again and I squinted, I saw at first thebit of fog superimposed on the fog bank, and then I saw a thin strip of fog inbetween that looked like a thin unsupported structure; a bridge joining themountain above me and the bank of fog in front of me.For a moment I thought I could see the transparent fog, which was being blowndown from the top of the mountain, going by the bridge without disturbing it. Itwas as if the bridge were actually solid. At one instant the mirage became socomplete that I could actually distinguish the darkness of the part under thebridge proper, as opposed to the light sandstone colour of its side.I stared at the bridge, dumbfounded. And then I either lifted myself to itslevel, or the bridge lowered itself to mine. Suddenly I was looking at astraight beam in front of me. It was an immensely long, solid beam, narrow andwithout railings, but wide enough to walk on.Don Juan shook me by the arm vigorously. I felt my head bobbing up and down andthen I noticed that my eyes itched terribly. I rubbed them quite unconsciously.Don Juan kept on shaking me until I opened my eyes again. He poured some waterfrom his gourd into the hollow of his hand and sprinkled my face with it. Thesensation was very unpleasant. The coldness of the water was so extreme that thedrops felt like sores on my skin. I noticed then that my body was very warm. Iwas feverish.Don Juan hurriedly gave me some water to drink, and then splashed water on myears and neck.I heard a very loud, eerie and prolonged bird cry. Don Juan listened attentivelyfor an instant and then pushed the rocks of the wall with his foot and collapsedthe roof. He threw the roof into the shrubs and tossed all the rocks, one byone, over the side.He whispered in my ear, \"Drink some water and chew your dry meat. We cannot stayhere. That cry was not a bird.\"We climbed down the ledge and began to walk in an easterly direction. In no timeat all it was so dark that it was as if there were a curtain in front of myeyes. The fog was like an impenetrable barrier. I had never realized howcrippling the fog was at night. I could not conceive how don Juan walked. I heldon to his arm as if I were blind.Somehow I had the feeling I was walking on the edge of a precipice. My legsrefused to move on. My reason trusted don Juan and I was rationally willing togo on; but my body was not, and don Juan had to drag me in total darkness.He must have known the terrain to ultimate perfection. He stopped at a certainpoint and made me sit down. I did not dare let go of his arm. My body felt,beyond the shadow of a doubt, that I was sitting on a barren domelike mountainand if I moved an inch to my right I would fall beyond the tolerance point intoan abyss.I was absolutely sure I was sitting on a curved mountainside, because my bodymoved unconsciously to the right. I thought it did so in order to keep itsverticality, so I tried to compensate by leaning to the left against don Juan asfar as I could.Don Juan suddenly moved away from me and without the support of his body I fellon the ground. Touching the ground restored my sense of equilibrium. I was lyingon a flat area. I began to reconnoitre [* reconnoitre- explore] my immediatesurroundings by touch. I recognized dry leaves and twigs.There was a sudden flash of lightning that illuminated the whole area andtremendous thunder. I saw don Juan standing to my left, and saw huge trees and acave a few feet behind him.Don Juan told me to get into the hole. I crawled into it and sat down with myback against the rock.I felt don Juan leaning over to whisper that I had to be totally silent.There were three flashes of lightning, one after the other. In a glance I sawdon Juan sitting cross-legged to my left. The cave was a concave formation bigenough for two or three persons to sit in. The hole seemed to have been carvedat the bottom of a boulder. I felt that it had indeed been wise of me to havecrawled into it because if I had been walking, I would have knocked my headagainst the rock.The brilliancy of the lightning gave me an idea of how thick the bank of fogwas. I noticed the trunks of enormous trees as dark silhouettes against theopaque light grey mass of the fog.Don Juan whispered that the fog and the lightning were in cahoots with eachother and I had to keep an exhausting vigil because I was engaged in a battle ofpower. At that moment a stupendous flash of lightning rendered the whole sceneryphantasmagorical. The fog was like a white filter that frosted the light of theelectrical discharge and diffused it uniformly.The fog was like a dense whitish substance hanging between the tall trees, butright in front of me at ground level the fog was thinning out. I plainlydistinguished the features of the terrain. We were in a pine forest. Very talltrees surrounded us. They were so extremely big that I could have sworn we werein the redwoods if I had not previously known our whereabouts.There was a barrage of lightning that lasted several minutes. Each flash madethe features I had already observed more discernible. Right in front of me I sawa definite trail. There was no vegetation on it. It seemed to end in an areaclear of trees.There were so many flashes of lightning that I could not keep track of wherethey were coming from. The scenery, however, had been so profusely illuminatedthat I felt much more at ease. My fears and uncertainties had vanished as soonas there had been enough light to lift the heavy curtain of darkness. So whenthere was a long pause between the flashes of lightning, I was no longerdisoriented by the blackness around me.Don Juan whispered that I had probably done enough watching, and that I had tofocus my attention on the sound of thunder. I realized to my amazement that Ihad not paid any attention to thunder at all in spite of the fact that it hadreally been tremendous. Don Juan added that I should follow the sound, and lookin the direction where I thought it came from.There were no longer barrages of lightning and thunder but only sporadic flashesof intense light and sound. The thunder seemed to always come from my right. Thefog was lifting, and since I was already accustomed to the pitch black, I coulddistinguish masses of vegetation. The lightning and thunder continued, andsuddenly the whole right side opened up and I could see the sky.The electrical storm seemed to be moving towards my right. There was anotherflash of lightning and I saw a distant mountain to my extreme right. The lightilluminated the background, silhouetting the bulky mass of the mountain. I sawtrees on top of it. They looked like neat black cutouts superimposed on thebrilliantly white sky. I even saw cumulus clouds over the mountains.The fog had cleared completely around us. There was a steady wind and I couldhear the rustling of leaves in the big trees to my left. The electrical stormwas too distant to illuminate the trees, but their dark masses remaineddiscernible. The light of the storm allowed me to establish, however, that therewas a range of distant mountains to my right and that the forest was limited tothe left side.It seemed that I was looking down into a dark valley which I could not see atall. The range over which the electrical storm was taking place was on theopposite side of the valley.Then it began to rain. I pressed back against the rock as far as I could. My hatserved as a good protection. I was sitting with my knees to my chest and only mycalves and shoes got wet.It rained for a long time. The rain was lukewarm. I felt it on my feet. And thenI fell asleep. The noises of birds woke me up. I looked around for don Juan. He was not there.Ordinarily I would have pondered whether he had left me there alone, but theshock of seeing the surroundings nearly paralysed me.I stood up. My legs were soaking wet, the brim of my hat was soggy and there wasstill some water in it that spilled over me. I was not in a cave at all, butunder some thick bushes. I experienced a moment of unparalleled confusion. I wasstanding on a flat piece of land between two small dirt hills covered withbushes. There were no trees to my left and no valley to my right. Right in frontof me, where I had seen the path in the forest, there was a gigantic bush.I refused to believe what I was witnessing. The incongruency of my two versionsof reality made me grapple for any kind of explanation. It occurred to me thatit was perfectly possible that I had slept so soundly that don Juan might havecarried me on his back to another place without waking me.I examined the spot where I had been sleeping. The ground there was dry, and sowas the ground on the spot next to it, where don Juan had been.I called him a couple of times, and then had an attack of anxiety and bellowedhis name as loud as I could. He came out from behind some bushes. I immediatelybecame aware that he knew what was going on. His smile was so mischievous that Iended up smiling myself.I did not want to waste any time in playing games with him. I blurted out whatwas the matter with me. I explained as carefully as possible every detail of mynight long hallucinations. He listened without interrupting. He could not,however, keep a serious face and started to laugh a couple of times, but heregained his composure right away.I asked for his comments three or four times; he only shook his head as if thewhole affair was also incomprehensible to him.When I ended my account he looked at me and said, \"You look awful. Maybe youneed to go to the bushes.\"He cackled for a moment, and then added that I should take off my clothes andwring them out so they would dry.The sunlight was brilliant. There were very few clouds. It was a windy briskday.Don Juan walked away, telling me that he was going to look for some plants, andthat I should compose myself and eat something, and not call him until I wascalm and strong.My clothes were really wet. I sat down in the sun to dry. I felt that the onlyway for me to relax was to get out my notebook and write. I ate while I workedon my notes.After a couple of hours I was more relaxed and I called don Juan. He answeredfrom a place near the top of the mountain. He told me to gather the gourds andclimb up to where he was.When I reached the spot, I found him sitting on a smooth rock. He opened thegourds and served himself some food. He handed me two big pieces of meat.I did not know where to begin. There were so many things I wanted to ask. Heseemed to be aware of my mood and laughed with sheer delight.\"How do you feel?\" he asked in a facetious tone. I did not want to say anything.I was still upset. Don Juan urged me to sit down on the flat slab. He said thatthe stone was a power object and that I would be renewed after being there for awhile.\"Sit down,\" he commanded me dryly.He did not smile. His eyes were piercing. I automatically sat down.He said that I was being careless with power by acting morosely, and that I hadto put an end to it or power would turn against both of us and we would neverleave those desolate hills alive. After a moment's pause he casually asked, \"How is your dreaming?\"I explained to him how difficult it had become for me to give myself the commandto look at my hands. At first it had been relatively easy, perhaps because ofthe newness of the concept. I had had no trouble at all in reminding myself thatI had to look at my hands. But the excitation had worn off and some nights Icould not do it at all.\"You must wear a headband to sleep,\" he said. \"Getting a headband is a trickymanoeuvre. I cannot give you one because you yourself have to make it fromscratch. But you cannot make one until you have had a vision of it in dreaming.See what I mean?\"The headband has to be made according to the specific vision. And it must havea strip across it that fits tightly on top of the head. Or it may very well belike a tight cap. Dreaming is easier when one wears a power object on top of thehead. You could wear your hat or put on a cowl, [* cowl- a loose hood or hoodedrobe (as worn by a monk)] like a friar, and go to sleep, but those items wouldonly cause intense dreams, not dreaming.\"He was silent for a moment and then proceeded to tell me in a fast barrage ofwords that the vision of the headband did not have to occur only in dreaming. Itcould happen in states of wakefulness and as a result of any farfetched andtotally unrelated event such as watching the flight of birds, the movement ofwater, the clouds, and so on.\"A hunter of power watches everything,\" he went on. \"And everything tells himsome secret.\"\"But how can one be sure that things are telling secrets?\" I asked.I thought he may have had a specific formula that allowed him to make 'correct'interpretations.\"The only way to be sure is by following all the instructions I have been givingyou, starting from the first day you came to see me,\" he said. \"In order to havepower one must live with power.\"He smiled benevolently. He seemed to have lost his fierceness. He even nudged melightly on the arm.\"Eat your power food,\" he urged me.I began to chew some dry meat, and at that moment I had the sudden realizationthat perhaps the dry meat contained a psychotropic substance, hence thehallucinations. For a moment I felt almost relieved. If he had put something inthe meat, my mirages were perfectly understandable. I asked him to tell me ifthere was anything at all in the 'power meat'.He laughed but did not answer me directly. I insisted, assuring him that I wasnot angry or even annoyed, but that I had to know so I could explain the eventsof the previous night to my own satisfaction. I urged him, coaxed him, andfinally begged him to tell me the truth.\"You are quite cracked,\" he said, shaking his head in a gesture of disbelief.\"You have an insidious tendency. You persist in trying to explain everything toyour satisfaction.\"There is nothing in the meat except power. The power was not put there by me orby any other man but by power itself. It is the dry meat of a deer and that deerwas a gift to me in the same way a certain rabbit was a gift to you not too longago. Neither you nor I put anything in the rabbit. I didn't ask you to dry therabbit's meat, because that act required more power than you had. However, I didtell you to eat the meat. You didn't eat much of it, because of your ownstupidity.\"What happened to you last night was neither a joke nor a prank. You had anencounter with power. The fog, the darkness, the lightning, the thunder and therain were all part of a great battle of power. You had the luck of a fool. Awarrior would give anything to have such a battle.\"My argument was that the whole event could not be a battle of power because ithad not been real.\"And what is real?\" don Juan asked me very calmly.\"This, what we're looking at is real,\" I said, pointing to the surroundings.\"But so was the bridge you saw last night, and so was the forest and everythingelse.\"\"But if they were real where are they now?\"\"They are here. If you had enough power, you could call them back. Right now youcannot do that because you think it is very helpful to keep on doubting andnagging. It isn't, my friend. It isn't.\"There are worlds upon worlds, right here in front of us. And they are nothingto laugh at. Last night if I hadn't grabbed your arm, you would have walked onthat bridge whether you wanted to or not. And earlier I had to protect you fromthe wind that was seeking you out.\"\"What would have happened if you hadn't protected me?\"\"Since you don't have enough power, the wind would have made you lose your way,and perhaps even killed you by pushing you into a ravine. But the fog was thereal thing last night. Two things could have happened to you in the fog. Youcould have walked across the bridge to the other side, or you could have fallento your death. Either would have depended on power. One thing, however, wouldhave been for sure. If I had not protected you, you would have had to walk onthat bridge regardless of anything.\"That is the nature of power. As I told you before, it commands you, and yet itis at your command. Last night for instance, the power would have forced you towalk across the bridge, and then it would have been at your command to sustainyou while you were walking. I stopped you because I know you don't have themeans to use power, and without power the bridge would have collapsed.\"\"Did you see the bridge yourself, don Juan?\"\"No. I just saw power. It may have been anything. Power for you, this time, wasa bridge. I don't know why a bridge. We are most mysterious creatures.\"\"Have you ever seen a bridge in the fog, don Juan?\"\"Never. But that's because I'm not like you. I saw other things. My battles ofpower are very different from yours.\"\"What did you see, don Juan? Can you tell me?\"\"I saw my enemies during my first battle of power in the fog. You have noenemies. You don't hate people. I did at that time. I indulged in hating people.I don't do that any more. I have vanquished my hate, but at that time my hatenearly destroyed me.\"Your battle of power, on the other hand, was neat. It didn't consume you. Youare consuming yourself now with your own crappy thoughts and doubts. That's yourway of indulging yourself.\"The fog was impeccable with you. You have an affinity with it. It gave you astupendous bridge, and that bridge will be there in the fog from now on. It willreveal itself to you over and over, until someday you will have to cross it.\"I strongly recommend that from this day on you don't walk into foggy areas byyourself until you know what you're doing.\"Power is a very weird affair. In order to have it and command it, one must havepower to begin with. It's possible, however, to store it, little by little,until one has enough to sustain oneself in a battle of power.\"\"What is a battle of power?\"\"What happened to you last night was the beginning of a battle of power. Thescenes that you beheld were the seat of power. Someday they will make sense toyou. Those scenes are most meaningful.\"\"Can you tell me their meaning yourself, don Juan?\"\"No. Those scenes are your own personal conquest which you cannot share withanyone. But what happened last night was only the beginning; a skirmish. Thereal battle will take place when you cross that bridge. What's on the otherside? Only you will know that. And only you will know what's at the end of thattrail through the forest.\"But all that is something that may or may not happen to you. In order tojourney through those unknown trails and bridges one must have enough power ofone's own.\"\"What happens if one doesn't have enough power?\"\"Death is always waiting, and when the warrior's power wanes, death simply tapshim. Thus, to venture into the unknown without any power is stupid. One willonly find death.\"I was not really listening. I kept on playing with the idea that the dry meatmay have been the agent that had caused the hallucinations. It appeased me toindulge in that thought.\"Don't tax yourself trying to figure it out,\" he said as if he were reading mythoughts. \"The world is a mystery. This, what you're looking at, is not allthere is to it. There is much more to the world, so much more, in fact, that itis endless.\"So, when you're trying to figure it out, all you're really doing is trying tomake the world familiar. You and I are right here, in the world that you callreal, simply because we both know it. You don't know the world of power,therefore you cannot make it into a familiar scene.\"\"You know that I really can't argue your point,\" I said, \"but my mind can'taccept it either.\"He laughed and touched my head lightly.\"You're really crazy,\" he said. \"But that's all right. I know how difficult itis to live like a warrior. If you would have followed my instructions andperformed all the acts I have taught you, you would by now have enough power tocross that bridge. Enough power to see and to stop the world.\"\"But why should I want power, don Juan?\"\"You can't think of a reason now. However, if you would store enough power, thepower itself will find you a good reason. Sounds crazy, doesn't it?\"\"Why did you want power yourself, don Juan?\"\"I'm like you. I didn't want it. I couldn't find a reason to have it. I had allthe doubts that you have and never followed the instructions I was given, or Inever thought I did. Yet, in spite of my stupidity, I stored enough power andone day my personal power made the world collapse.\"\"But why would anyone wish to 'stop the world'?\"\"Nobody does, that's the point. It just happens. And once you know what it islike to stop the world, you realize there is a reason for it. You see, one ofthe arts of the warrior is to collapse the world for a specific reason, and thenrestore it again in order to keep on living.\"I told him that perhaps the surest way to help me would be to give me an exampleof a specific reason for collapsing the world.He remained silent for some time. He seemed to be thinking what to say.\"I can't tell you that,\" he said. \"It takes too much power to know that. Somedayyou will live like a warrior in spite of yourself. Then perhaps you will havestored enough personal power to answer that question yourself.\"I have taught you nearly everything a warrior needs to know in order to startoff in the world storing power by himself. Yet I know that you can't do that andI have to be patient with you. I know for a fact that it takes a lifelongstruggle to be by oneself in the world of power.\"Don Juan looked at the sky and the mountains. The sun was already on its descenttowards the west and rain clouds were rapidly forming on the mountains. I didnot know the time. I had forgotten to wind my watch. I asked don Juan if hecould tell the time of the day, and he had such an attack of laughter that herolled off the slab into the bushes.He stood up and stretched his arms, yawning. \"It is early,\" he said. \"We mustwait until the fog gathers on top of the mountain and then you must stand aloneon this slab, and thank the fog for its favours. Let it come and envelop you.I'll be nearby to assist, if need be.\"Somehow the prospect of staying alone in the fog terrified me. I felt idioticfor reacting in such an irrational manner.\"You cannot leave these desolate mountains without saying your thanks,\" he saidin a firm tone. \"A warrior never turns his back to power without atoning for thefavours received.\"He lay down on his back with his hands behind his head and covered his face withhis hat.\"How should I wait for the fog?\" I asked. \"What should I do?\"\"Write!\" he said through his hat. \"But don't close your eyes or turn your backto it.\"I tried to write, but I could not concentrate. I stood up and moved aroundrestlessly. Don Juan lifted his hat and looked at me with an air of annoyance.\"Sit down!\" he ordered me.He said that the battle of power had not yet ended, and that I had to teach myspirit to be impassive. Nothing of what I did should betray my feelings unless Iwanted to remain trapped in those mountains.He sat up and moved his hand in a gesture of urgency. He said that I had to actas if nothing was out of the ordinary because places of power, such as the onein which we were, had the potential of draining people who were disturbed. Andthus one could develop strange and injurious ties with a locale.\"Those ties anchor a man to a place of power, sometimes for a lifetime,\" hesaid. \"And this is not the place for you. You did not find it yourself. Sotighten your belt and don't lose your pants.\"His admonitions worked like a spell on me. I wrote for hours withoutinterruption. Don Juan went back to sleep and did not wake up until the fog was perhaps ahundred yards away, descending from the top of the mountain. He stood up andexamined the surroundings. I looked around without turning my back. The fog hadalready invaded the lowlands, descending from the mountains to my right. On myleft side the scenery was clear. The wind, however, seemed to be coming from myright and was pushing the fog into the lowlands as if to surround us.Don Juan whispered that I should remain impassive, standing where I was withoutclosing my eyes; and that I should not turn around until I was completelysurrounded by the fog. Only then was it possible to start our descent.He took cover at the foot of some rocks a few feet behind me.The silence in those mountains was something magnificent and at the same timeawesome. The soft wind that was carrying the fog gave me the sensation that thefog was hissing in my ears. Big chunks of fog came downhill like solid clumps ofwhitish matter rolling down on me. I smelled the fog. It was a peculiar mixtureof a pungent and fragrant smell. Then I was enveloped in it.I had the impression the fog was working on my eyelids. They felt heavy and Iwanted to close my eyes. I was cold. My throat itched and I wanted to cough butI did not dare. I lifted my chin up and stretched my neck to ease the cough, andas I looked up I had the sensation I could actually see the thickness of the fogbank. It was as if my eyes could assess the thickness by going through it. Myeyes began to close and I could not fight off the desire to fall asleep. I feltI was going to collapse on the ground any moment. At that instant don Juanjumped up and grabbed me by the arms and shook me. The jolt was enough torestore my lucidity.He whispered in my ear that I had to run downhill as fast as I could. He wasgoing to follow behind because he did not want to get smashed by the rocks thatI might turn over in my path. He said that I was the leader since it was mybattle of power, and that I had to be clear-headed and abandoned in order toguide us safely out of there.\"This is it,\" he said in a loud voice. \"If you don't have the mood of a warrior,we may never leave the fog.\"I hesitated for a moment. I was not sure I could find my way down from thosemountains.\"Run, rabbit, run!\" don Juan yelled, and shoved me gently down the slope.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"13. A Warrior's Last Stand Sunday, 1962 January 28 Around ten A.M. don Juan walked into his house. He had left at the crack ofdawn. I greeted him. He chuckled, and in a clowning mood he shook hands with meand greeted me ceremoniously.\"We're going to go on a little trip,\" he said. \"You're going to drive us to avery special place in search of power.\"He unfolded two carrying nets, placed two gourds filled with food in each ofthem, tied them with a thin rope, and handed me a net.We leisurely drove north some four hundred miles. Then we left the Pan Americanhighway, and took a gravel road towards the west. My car seemed to have been theonly car on the road for hours. As we kept on driving, I noticed that I couldnot see through my windshield. I strained desperately to look at thesurroundings, but it was too dark and my windshield was overlaid with crushedinsects and dust.I told don Juan that I had to stop to clean my windshield. He ordered me to goon driving even if I had to crawl at two miles an hour and stick my head out ofthe window to see ahead. He said that we could not stop until we had reached ourdestination.At a certain place he told me to turn to the right. It was so dark and dustythat even the headlights did not help much. I drove off the road with greattrepidation. I was afraid of the soft shoulders, but the dirt was packed.I drove for about one hundred yards at the lowest possible speed, and held thedoor open to look out. Finally don Juan told me to stop. He said that I hadparked right behind a huge rock that would shield my car from view.I got out of the car and walked around guided by the headlights. I wanted toexamine the surroundings because I had no idea where I was, but don Juan turnedoff the lights. He said loudly that there was no time to waste, and that Ishould lock my car so we could start on our way.He handed me my net with gourds. It was so dark that I stumbled and nearlydropped them. Don Juan ordered me in a soft firm tone to sit down until my eyeswere accustomed to the darkness.But my eyes were not the problem. Once I got out of my car I could see fairlywell. What was wrong was a peculiar nervousness that made me act as if I wereabsent-minded. I was glossing over everything.\"Where are we going?\" I asked.\"We're going to hike in total darkness to a special place,\" he said.\"What for?\"\"To find out for sure whether or not you're capable of continuing to huntpower.\"I asked him if what he was proposing was a test; and if I failed the test, wouldhe still talk to me and tell me about his knowledge.He listened without interrupting. He said that what we were doing was not atest, and that we were waiting for an omen. If the omen did not come, theconclusion would be that I had not succeeded in hunting power; in which case Iwould be free from any further imposition; free to be as stupid as I wanted. Hesaid that no matter what happened, he was my friend and he would always talk tome.Somehow I knew I was going to fail.\"The omen will not come,\" I said jokingly. \"I know it. I have a little power.\"He laughed and patted me on the back gently. \"Don't you worry,\" he retorted.\"The omen will come. I know it. I have more power than you.\"He found his statement hilarious. He slapped his thighs and clapped his handsand roared with laughter.Don Juan tied my carrying net to my back. He said that I should walk one stepbehind him, and step in his tracks as much as possible.In a very dramatic tone he whispered, \"This is a walk for power, so everythingcounts.\"He said that if I would walk in his footsteps, the power that he was dissipatingas he walked would be transmitted to me.I looked at my watch. It was eleven P.M.He made me line up like a soldier at attention. Then he pushed my right leg tothe front and made me stand as if I had just taken a step forward. He lined upin front of me in the same position, and then began to walk after repeating theinstructions that I should try to match his footsteps to perfection. He said ina clear whisper that I should not concern myself with anything else exceptstepping in his tracks. I should not look ahead or to the side, but at theground where he was walking. He started off at a very relaxed pace. I had no trouble at all following him. Wewere walking on relatively hard ground. For about thirty yards I maintained hispace and I matched his steps perfectly. Then I glanced to the side for aninstant, and the next thing I knew I had bumped into him.He giggled and assured me that I had not injured his ankle at all when I steppedon it with my big shoes, but if I were going to keep on blundering, one of uswould be a cripple by morning. Laughing, he said in a very low but firm voicethat he did not intend to get hurt by my stupidity and lack of concentration;and that if I stepped on him again I would have to walk barefoot.\"I can't walk without shoes,\" I said in a loud raspy voice.Don Juan doubled up with laughter, and we had to wait until he had stopped.He assured me again that he had meant what he said. We were journeying to tappower, and things had to be perfect.The prospect of walking in the desert without shoes scared me beyond belief. DonJuan joked that my family were probably the type of farmers that did not takeoff their shoes even to go to bed. He was right, of course. I had never walkedbarefoot, and to walk in the desert without shoes would have been suicidal forme.\"This desert is oozing power,\" don Juan whispered in my ear. \"There is no timefor being timid.\"We started walking again. Don Juan kept an easy pace. After a while, I noticedthat we had left the hard ground and were walking on soft sand. Don Juan's feetsank into it and left deep tracks.We walked for hours before don Juan came to a halt. He did not stop suddenly,but warned me ahead of time that he was going to stop so I would not bump intohim. The terrain had become hard again and it seemed that we were going up anincline.Don Juan said that if I needed to go to the bushes, I should do it because fromthen on we had a solid stretch without a single pause. I looked at my watch. Itwas one A.M.After a ten or fifteen minute rest, don Juan made me line up and we began towalk again. He was right. It was a dreadful stretch. I had never done anythingthat demanded so much concentration. Don Juan's pace was so fast, and thetension of watching every step mounted to such heights, that at a given moment Icould not feel that I was walking any more. I could not feel my feet or my legs.It was as if I were walking on air, and some force were carrying me on and on.My concentration had been so total that I did not notice the gradual change inlight. Suddenly I became aware that I could see don Juan in front of me. I couldsee his feet and his tracks instead of half guessing as I had done most of thenight.At a given moment, he unexpectedly jumped to the side and my momentum carried mefor about twenty yards further. As I slowed down my legs became weak and startedto shake until, finally, I collapsed on the ground.I looked up at don Juan, who was calmly examining me. He did not seem to betired. I was panting for breath and soaked in cold perspiration.Don Juan twirled me around in my lying position by pulling me by the arm. Hesaid that if I wanted to regain my strength, I had to lie with my head towardsthe east. Little by little I relaxed and rested my aching body. Finally I hadenough energy to stand up. I wanted to look at my watch, but he prevented me byputting his hand over my wrist. He very gently turned me around to face theeast, and said that there was no need for my confounded timepiece; that we wereon magical time; and that we were going to find out for sure whether or not Iwas capable of pursuing power.I looked around. We were on top of a very large high hill. I wanted to walktowards something that looked like an edge or a crevice in the rock, but donJuan jumped and held me down.He ordered me imperatively to stay on the place I had fallen until the sun hadcome out from behind some black mountain peaks a short distance away.He pointed to the east and called my attention to a heavy bank of clouds overthe horizon. He said that it would be a proper omen if the wind blew the cloudsaway in time for the first rays of the sun to hit my body on the hilltop.He told me to stand still with my right leg in front as if I were walking; andnot to look directly at the horizon, but to look without focusing.My legs became very stiff and my calves hurt. It was an agonizing position, andmy leg muscles were too sore to support me. I held on as long as I could. I wasabout to collapse. My legs were shivering uncontrollably when don Juan calledthe whole thing off. He helped me to sit down.The bank of clouds had not moved and we had not seen the sun rising over thehorizon.Don Juan's only comment was, \"Too bad.\"I did not want to ask right off what the real implications of my failure were.But knowing don Juan, I was sure he had to follow the dictum of his omens, andthere had been no omen that morning.The pain in my calves vanished, and I felt a wave of well-being. I began to trotin order to loosen up my muscles. Don Juan told me very softly to run up anadjacent hill and gather some leaves from a specific bush, and rub my legs inorder to alleviate the muscular pain.From where I stood, I could very plainly see a large lush green bush. The leavesseemed to be very moist. I had used them before. I never felt that they hadhelped me, but don Juan had always maintained that the effect of really friendlyplants was so subtle that one could hardly notice it; yet they always producedthe results they were supposed to.I ran down the hill and up the other. When I got to the top, I realized that theexertion had almost been too much for me. I had a hard time catching my breath,and my stomach was upset. I squatted and then crouched over for a moment until Ifelt relaxed.Then I stood up and reached over to pick the leaves he had asked me to. But Icould not find the bush. I looked around. I was sure I was on the right spot,but there was nothing in that area of the hilltop that even vaguely resembledthat particular plant. Yet that had to be the spot where I had seen it. Anyother place would have been out of range for anyone looking from where don Juanwas standing.I gave up the search and walked to the other hill. Don Juan smiled benevolentlyas I explained my mistake.\"Why do you call it a mistake?\" he asked.\"Obviously the bush is not there,\" I said.\"But you saw it, didn't you?\"\"I thought I did.\"\"What do you see in its place now?\"\"Nothing.\"There was absolutely no vegetation on the spot where I thought I had seen theplant. I attempted to explain what I had seen as a visual distortion; a sort ofmirage. I had really been exhausted. Because of my exhaustion, I may have easilybelieved I was seeing something that I expected to be there, but which was notthere at all.Don Juan chuckled softly and stared at me for a brief moment.\"I see no mistake,\" he said. \"The plant is there on that hilltop.\"It was my turn to laugh. I scanned the whole area carefully. There were no suchplants in view. What I had experienced was, to the best of my knowledge, ahallucination.Don Juan very calmly began to descend the hill, and signalled me to follow. Weclimbed together to the other hilltop, and stood right where I thought I hadseen the bush.I chuckled with the absolute certainty I was right. Don Juan also chuckled.\"Walk to the other side of the hill,\" don Juan said. \"You'll find the plantthere.\"I brought up the point that the other side of the hill had been outside my fieldof vision; that a plant may be there, but that that did not mean anything.Don Juan signalled me with a movement of his head to follow him. He walkedaround the top of the hill instead of going directly across, and dramaticallystood by a green bush without looking at it.He turned and looked at me. It was a peculiarly piercing glance.\"There must be hundreds of such plants around here,\" I said.Don Juan very patiently descended that other side of the hill with me trailingalong. We looked everywhere for a similar bush. But there was none in sight. Wecovered about a quarter of a mile before we came upon another plant.Without saying a word, don Juan led me back to the first hilltop. We stood therefor a moment and then he guided me on another excursion to look for the plantbut in the opposite direction. We combed the area and found two more bushes,perhaps a mile away. They had grown together and stuck out as a patch of intenserich green more lush than all the other surrounding bushes.Don Juan looked at me with a serious expression. I did not know what to think ofit.\"This is a very strange omen,\" he said.We returned to the first hilltop, making a wide detour in order to approach itfrom a new direction. He seemed to be going out of his way to prove to me thatthere were very few such plants around there. We did not find any of them on ourway. When we reached the hilltop we sat down in complete silence. Don Juanuntied his gourds.\"You'll feel better after eating,\" he said.He could not hide his delight. He had a beaming grin as he patted me on thehead. I felt disoriented. The new developments were disturbing, but I was toohungry and tired to really ponder upon them. After eating I felt very sleepy. Don Juan urged me to use the technique oflooking without focusing in order to find a suitable spot to sleep on thehilltop where I had seen the bush.I selected one. He picked up the debris from the spot, and made a circle with itthe size of my body. Very gently he pulled some fresh branches from the bushesand swept the area inside the circle. He only went through the motions ofsweeping: he did not really touch the ground with the branches. He then removedall the surface rocks from the area inside the circle and placed them in thecentre after meticulously sorting them by size into two piles of equal number.\"What are you doing with those rocks?\" I asked.\"They are not rocks,\" he said. \"They are strings. They will hold your spotsuspended.\"He took the smaller rocks and marked the circumference of the circle with them.He spaced them evenly; and with the aid of a stick, he secured each rock firmlyin the ground as if he were a mason.He did not let me come inside the circle, but told me to walk around and watchwhat he did. He counted eighteen rocks, and followed a counterclockwisedirection.\"Now run down to the bottom of the hill and wait,\" he said. \"And I will come tothe edge and see if you are standing in the appropriate spot.\"\"What are you going to do?\"\"I'm going to toss each of these strings to you,\" he said, pointing to the pileof bigger rocks. \"And you have to place them in the ground at the spot I willindicate in the same manner I have placed the other ones.\"You must be infinitely careful. When one is dealing with power, one has to beperfect. Mistakes are deadly here. Each of these is a string- a string thatcould kill us if we leave it around loose; so you simply can't make anymistakes. You must fix your gaze on the spot where I will throw the string. Ifyou get distracted by anything at all, the string will become an ordinary rockand you won't be able to tell it apart from the other rocks lying around.\"I suggested that it would be easier if I carried the strings downhill one at atime.Don Juan laughed and shook his head negatively.\"These are strings,\" he insisted, \"and they have to be tossed by me, and have tobe picked up by you.\"It took hours to fulfill the task. The degree of concentration needed wasexcruciating. Don Juan reminded me every time to be attentive and focus my gaze.He was right in doing so. To pick out a specific rock that came hurtlingdownhill, displacing other rocks in its way, was indeed a maddening affair.When I had completely closed the circle and walked back to the top, I thought Iwas about to drop dead. Don Juan had picked some small branches, and had mattedthe circle. He handed me some leaves and told me to put them inside my pantsagainst the skin of my umbilical region. He said that they would keep me warmand I would not need a blanket to sleep. I tumbled down inside the circle. Thebranches made a fairly soft bed and I fell asleep instantly. It was late afternoon when I woke up. It was windy and cloudy. The cloudsoverhead were compact cumulus clouds, but towards the west they were thin cirrusclouds. The sun shone on the land from time to time.Sleeping had renewed me. I felt invigorated and happy. The wind did not botherme. I was not cold. I propped my head up with my arms and looked around. I hadnot noticed before, but the hilltop was quite high. The view towards the westwas impressive. I could see a vast area of low hills and then the desert. Therewas a range of dark brown mountain peaks towards the north and east, and towardsthe south an endless expanse of land and hills and distant blue mountains.I sat up. Don Juan was not anywhere in sight. I had a sudden attack of fear. Ithought he may have left me there alone, and I did not know the way back to mycar. I lay down again on the mat of branches, and strangely enough myapprehension vanished. I again experienced a sense of quietness; an exquisitesense of well-being. It was an extremely new sensation to me. My thoughts seemedto have been turned off. I was happy. I felt healthy. A very quiet ebulliencefilled me.A soft wind was blowing from the west and swept over my body without I making mecold. I felt it on my face and around my ears like a gentle wave of warm waterthat bathed me and then receded and bathed me again. It was a strange state ofbeing that had no parallel in my busy and dislocated life. I began to weep, notout of sadness or self-pity, but out of some ineffable, inexplicable joy.I wanted to stay in that spot forever; and I may have had don Juan not come andyanked me out of the place.\"You've had enough rest,\" he said as he pulled me up.He led me very calmly on a walk around the periphery of the hilltop. We walkedslowly and in complete silence. He seemed to be interested in making me observethe scenery all around us. He pointed to clouds and mountains with a movement ofhis eyes or with a movement of his chin.The scenery in the late afternoon was superb. It evoked sensations of awe anddespair in me. It reminded me of sights in my childhood.We climbed to the highest point of the hilltop, a peak of igneous rock, and satdown comfortably facing the south with our backs against the rock. The endlessexpanse of land towards the south was truly majestic.\"Fix all this in your memory,\" don Juan whispered in my ear. \"This spot isyours. This morning you saw, and that was the omen. You found this spot byseeing. The omen was unexpected, but it happened. You are going to hunt powerwhether you like it or not. It is not a human decision; not yours or mine.\"Now, properly speaking, this hilltop is your place; your beloved place. Allthat is around you is under your care. You must look after everything here, andeverything will in turn look after you.\"In a joking way I asked if everything was mine. He said, \"Yes,\" in a veryserious tone. I laughed and told him that what we were doing reminded me of thestory of how the Spaniards that conquered the New World had divided the land inthe name of their king. They used to climb to the top of a mountain, and claimall the land they could see in any specific direction.\"That's a good idea,\" he said. \"I'm going to give you all the land you can see,not in one direction, but all around you.\"He stood up and pointed with his extended hand, turning his body around to covera complete circle.\"All this land is yours,\" he said.I laughed out loud.He giggled and asked me, \"Why not? Why can't I give you this land?\"\"You don't own this land,\" I said.\"So what? The Spaniards didn't own it either, and yet they divided it and gaveit away. So why can't you take possession of it in the same vein?\"I scrutinized him to see if I could detect the real mood behind his smile. Hehad an explosion of laughter and nearly fell off the rock.\"All this land, as far as you can see, is yours,\" he went on, still smiling.\"Not to use but to remember. This hilltop, however, is yours to use for the restof your life. I am giving it to you because you have found it yourself. It isyours. Accept it.\"I laughed, but don Juan seemed to be very serious. Except for his funny smile,he appeared to actually believe that he could give me that hilltop.\"Why not?\" he asked as if he were reading my thoughts.\"I accept it,\" I said half in jest.His smile disappeared. He squinted his eyes as he looked at me.\"Every rock and pebble and bush on this hill, especially on the top, is underyour care,\" he said. \"Every worm that lives here is your friend. You can usethem and they can use you.\"We remained silent for a few minutes. My thoughts were unusually scarce. Ivaguely felt that his sudden change of mood was foreboding to me, but I was notafraid or apprehensive. I just did not want to talk any more. Somehow, wordsseemed to be inaccurate and their meanings difficult to pinpoint. I had neverfelt that way about talking, and upon realizing my unusual mood I hurriedlybegan to talk.\"But what can I do with this hill, don Juan?\"\"Fix every feature of it in your memory. This is the place where you will comein dreaming. This is the place where you will meet with powers; where secretswill someday be revealed to you. You are hunting power and this is your place;the place where you will store your resources.\"It doesn't make sense to you now. So let it be a piece of nonsense for the timebeing.\" We climbed down the rock and he led me to a small bowl-like depression on thewest side of the hilltop. We sat down and ate there.Undoubtedly there was something indescribably pleasant for me on that hilltop.Eating, like resting, was an unknown exquisite sensation.The light of the setting sun had a rich, almost copperish, glow; and everythingin the surroundings seemed to be dabbed with a golden hue. I was given totallyto observing the scenery. I did not even want to think.Don Juan spoke to me almost in a whisper. He told me to watch every detail ofthe surroundings, no matter how small or seemingly trivial, especially thefeatures of the scenery that were most prominent in a westerly direction. Hesaid that I should look at the sun without focusing on it until it haddisappeared over the horizon.The last minutes of light, right before the sun hit a blanket of low clouds orfog, were, in a total sense, magnificent. It was as if the sun were inflamingthe earth, kindling it like a bonfire. I felt a sensation of redness in my face.\"Stand up!\" don Juan shouted as he pulled me up. He jumped away from me, andordered me in an imperative but urging voice to trot on the spot where I wasstanding.As I jogged on the same spot, I began to feel a warmth invading my body. It wasa copperish warmth. I felt it in my palate and in the roof of my eyes. It was asif the top part of my head were burning with a cool fire that radiated acopperish glow. Something in myself made me trot faster and faster as the sunbegan to disappear. At a given moment I truly felt I was so light that I couldhave flown away. Don Juan very firmly grabbed my right wrist. The sensationcaused by the pressure of his hand brought back a sense of sobriety andcomposure. I plunked down on the ground and he sat down by me.After a few minutes' rest, he quietly stood up, tapped me on the shoulder, andsignalled me to follow him. We climbed back again to the peak of igneous rockwhere we had sat before. The rock shielded us from the cold wind. Don Juan brokethe silence.\"It was a fine omen,\" he said. \"How strange. It happened at the end of the day.You and I are so different. You are more a creature of the night. I prefer theyoung brilliancy of the morning; or rather the brilliancy of the morning sunseeks me, but it shies away from you. On the other hand, the dying sun bathedyou. Its flames scorched you without burning you. How strange.\"\"Why is it strange?\"\"I've never seen it happen. The omen, when it happens, has always been in therealm of the young sun.\"\"Why is it that way, don Juan?\"\"This is not the time to talk about it,\" he said cuttingly. \"Knowledge is power.It takes a long time to harness enough power to even talk about it.\" I tried to insist, but he changed the topic abruptly. He asked me about myprogress in dreaming.I had begun to dream about specific places such as the school, and the houses ofa few friends.\"Were you at those places during the day or during the night?\" he asked.My dreams corresponded to the time of the day when I ordinarily was accustomedto being at those places- in the school during the day, at my friends' houses atnight.He suggested that I should try dreaming while I took a nap during the daytime,and find out if I could actually visualize the chosen place as it was at thetime I was dreaming. If I were dreaming at night, my visions of the localeshould be of nighttime. He said that what one experiences in dreaming has to becongruous with the time of the day when dreaming was taking place; otherwise thevisions one might have were not dreaming, but ordinary dreams.\"In order to help yourself you should pick a specific object that belongs to theplace you want to go to, and focus your attention on it,\" he went on. \"On thishilltop here, for instance, you now have a specific bush that you must observeuntil it has a place in your memory. You can come back here while dreamingsimply by recalling that bush, or by recalling this rock where we are sitting;or by recalling any other thing here. It is easier to travel in dreaming whenyou can focus on a place of power, such as this one.\"But if you don't want to come here, you may use any other place. Perhaps theschool where you go is a place of power for you. Use it. Focus your attention onany object there, and then find it in dreaming.\"From the specific object you recall, you must go back to your hands, and thento another object, and so on.\"But now you must focus your attention on everything that exists on this hilltopbecause this is the most important place of your life.\"He looked at me as if judging the effect of his words.\"This is the place where you will die,\" he said in a soft voice.I fidgeted nervously, changing sitting positions, and he smiled.\"I will have to come with you over and over to this hilltop,\" he said. \"Then youwill have to come by yourself until you're saturated with it; until the hilltopis oozing you. You will know the time when you are filled with it. This hilltop,as it is now, will then be the place of your last dance.\"\"What do you mean by my last dance, don Juan?\"\"This is the site of your last stand,\" he said. \"You will die here no matterwhere you are. Every warrior has a place to die. A place of his predilectionwhich is soaked with unforgettable memories; where powerful events left theirmark; a place where he has witnessed marvels; where secrets have been revealedto him; a place where he has stored his personal power.\"A warrior has the obligation to go back to that place of his predilection everytime he taps power in order to store it there. He either goes there by means ofwalking, or by means of dreaming.\"And finally, one day when his time on earth is up and he feels the tap of hisdeath on his left shoulder, his spirit which is always ready flies to the placeof his predilection, and there the warrior dances to his death.\"Every warrior has a specific form; a specific posture of power which hedevelops throughout his life. It is a sort of dance; a movement that he doesunder the influence of his personal power.\"If a dying warrior has limited power, his dance is short. If his power isgrandiose, his dance is magnificent. But regardless of whether his power issmall or magnificent, death must stop to witness his last stand on earth. Deathcannot overtake the warrior who is recounting the toil of his life for the lasttime until he has finished his dance.\"Don Juan's words made me shiver. The quietness, the twilight, and themagnificent scenery all seemed to have been placed there as props for the imageof a warrior's last dance of power.\"Can you teach me that dance even though I am not a warrior?\" I asked.\"Any man that hunts power has to learn that dance,\" he said. \"Yet I cannot teachyou now. Soon you may have a worthy opponent, and I will show you then the firstmovement of power. You must add the other movements yourself as you go onliving. Every new one must be obtained during a struggle of power. So, properlyspeaking, the posture, or the form of a warrior is the story of his life; adance that grows as he grows in personal power.\"\"Does death really stop to see a warrior dance?\"\"A warrior is only a man. A humble man. He cannot change the designs of hisdeath. But his impeccable spirit which has stored power after stupendoushardships can certainly hold his death for a moment; a moment long enough to lethim rejoice for the last time in recalling his power. We may say that that is agesture which death has with those who have an impeccable spirit.\"I experienced an overwhelming anxiety and I talked just to alleviate it. I askedhim if he had known warriors that had died, and in what way their last dance hadaffected their dying.\"Cut it out,\" he said dryly. \"Dying is a monumental affair. It is more thankicking your legs and becoming stiff.\"\"Will I too dance to my death, don Juan?\"\"Certainly. You are hunting personal power even though you don't live like awarrior yet. Today the sun gave you an omen. Your best production in your life'swork will be done towards the end of the day. Obviously you don't like theyouthful brilliancy of early light. Journeying in the morning doesn't appeal toyou. But your cup of tea is the dying sun; old, yellowish, and mellow. You don'tlike the heat. You like the glow.\"And thus you will dance to your death here, on this hilltop, at the end of theday. And in your last dance, you will tell of your struggle; of the battles youhave won, and of those you have lost. You will tell of your joys andbewilderments upon encountering personal power. Your dance will tell about thesecrets and about the marvels you have stored. And your death will sit here, andwatch you.\"The dying sun will glow on you without burning as it has done today. The windwill be soft and mellow, and your hilltop will tremble. As you reach the end ofyour dance, you will look at the sun, for you will never see it again in wakingor in dreaming. And then your death will point to the south. To the vastness.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"14. The Gait of Power Saturday, 1962 April 7 \"Is death a personage, don Juan?\" I asked as I sat down on the porch.There was an air of bewilderment in don Juan's look. He was holding a bag ofgroceries I had brought him. He carefully placed them on the ground, and satdown in front of me. I felt encouraged, and I explained that I wanted to know ifdeath was a person, or like a person when it watched a warrior's last dance.\"What difference does it make?\" don Juan asked.I told him that the image was fascinating to me and I want to know how he hadarrived at it; how he knew that that was so.\"It's all very simple,\" he said. \"A man of knowledge knows that death is thelast witness because he sees.\"\"Do you mean that you have witnessed a warrior's last dance yourself?\"\"No. One cannot be such a witness. Only death can do that. But I have seen myown death watching me, and I have danced to it as though I were dying. At theend of my dance, death did not point in any direction, and my place ofpredilection did not shiver saying goodbye to me; so my time on earth was not upyet, and I did not die. When all that took place, I had limited power and I didnot understand the designs of my own death, thus I believed I was dying.\"\"Was your death like a person?\"\"You're a funny bird. You think you are going to understand by asking questions.I don't think you will, but who am I to say?\"Death is not like a person. It is rather a presence. But one may also choose tosay that it is nothing, and yet it is everything. One will be right on everycount. Death is whatever one wishes.\"I am at ease with people, so death is a person for me. I am also given tomysteries, so death has hollow eyes for me. I can look through them. They arelike two windows, and yet they move like eyes move. And so I can say that deathwith its hollow eyes looks at a warrior while he dances for the last time onearth.\"\"But is that so only for you, don Juan, or is it the same for other warriors?\"\"It is the same for every warrior that has a dance of power, and yet it is not.Death witnesses a warrior's last dance, but the manner in which a warrior seeshis death is a personal matter. It could be anything: a bird, a light, a person,a bush, a pebble, a piece of fog, or an unknown presence.\"Don Juan's images of death disturbed me. I could not find adequate words tovoice my questions and I stammered. He stared at me, smiling, and coaxed me tospeak up.I asked him if the manner in which a warrior saw his death depended on the wayhe had been brought up. I used the Yuma and Yaqui Indians as examples. My ownidea was that culture determined the way in which one would envision death.\"It doesn't matter how one was brought up,\" he said. \"What determines the wayone does anything is personal power. A man is only the sum of his personalpower, and that sum determines how he lives and how he dies.\"\"What is personal power?\"\"Personal power is a feeling,\" he said. \"Something like being lucky. Or one maycall it a mood. Personal power is something that one acquires regardless ofone's origin. I already have told you that a warrior is a hunter of power, andthat I am teaching you how to hunt and store it.\"The difficulty with you, which is the difficulty with all of us, is to beconvinced. You need to believe that personal power can be used, and that it ispossible to store it; but you haven't been convinced so far.\"I told him that he had made his point, and that I was as convinced as I wouldever be.He laughed, and said, \"That is not the type of conviction I am talking about.\"He tapped my shoulder with two or three soft punches, and added with a cackle,\"I don't need to be humoured, you know.\"I felt obliged to assure him that I was serious.\"I don't doubt it,\" he said. \"But to be convinced means that you can act byyourself. It will still take you a great deal of effort to do that. Much morehas to be done. You have just begun.\" He was quiet for a moment. His face acquired a placid expression.\"It's funny the way you sometimes remind me of myself,\" he went on. \"I too didnot want to take the path of a warrior. I believed that all that work, was fornothing; and since we are all going to die what difference would it make to be awarrior?\"I was wrong. But I had to find that out for myself.\"Whenever you do realize that you are wrong, and that it certainly makes a worldof difference, you can say that you are convinced. Then you can proceed byyourself; and by yourself you may even become a man of knowledge.\"I asked him to explain what he meant by a man of knowledge.\"A man of knowledge is one who has followed truthfully the hardships oflearning,\" he said. \"A man who has, without rushing or faltering, gone as far ashe can in unravelling the secrets of personal power.\"He discussed the concept in brief terms and then discarded it as a topic ofconversation, saying that I should only be concerned with the idea of storingpersonal power.\"That's incomprehensible,\" I protested. \"I can't really figure out what you aredriving at.\"\"Hunting power is a peculiar event,\" he said. \"It first has to be an idea, thenit has to be set up, step by step, and then, bingo! It happens.\"\"How does it happen?\"Don Juan stood up. He began stretching his arms and arching his back like a cat.His bones, as usual, made a series of cracking sounds.\"Let's go,\" he said. \"We have a long journey ahead of us.\"\"But there are so many things I want to ask you,\" I said.\"We are going to a place of power,\" he said as he stepped inside his house. \"Whydon't you save your questions for the time we are there? We may have anopportunity to talk.\"I thought we were going to drive, so I stood up and walked to my car. But donJuan called me from the house, and told me to pick up my net with gourds. He waswaiting for me at the edge of the desert chaparral behind his house.\"We have to hurry up,\" he said. We reached the lower slopes of the western Sierra Madre mountains around threeP.M. It had been a warm day, but towards the late afternoon the wind becamecold. Don Juan sat down on a rock, and signalled me to do likewise.\"What are we going to do here this time, don Juan?\"\"You know very well that we're here to hunt power.\"\"I know that. But what are we going to do here in particular?\"\"You know that I don't have the slightest idea.\"\"Do you mean that you never follow a plan?\"\"Hunting power is a very strange affair,\" he said. \"There is no way to plan itahead of time. That's what's exciting about it. A warrior proceeds as if he hada plan though because he trusts his personal power. He knows for a fact that itwill make him act in the most appropriate fashion.\"I pointed out that his statements were somehow contradictory. If a warrioralready had personal power, why was he hunting for it?Don Juan raised his brows, made a gesture of feigned disgust, and said, \"You'rethe one who is hunting personal power, and I am the warrior who already has it.You asked me if I had a plan and I said that I trust my personal power to guideme and that I don't need to have a plan.\"We remained quiet for a moment, and then began walking again. The slopes werevery steep, and climbing them was very difficult and extremely tiring for me. Onthe other hand, there seemed to be no end to don Juan's stamina. He did not runor hurry. His walking was steady and tireless.I noticed that don Juan was not perspiring even after having climbed an enormousand almost vertical slope. When I reached the top of it, he was already therewaiting for me. As I sat down next to him, I felt that my heart was about toburst out of my chest. I lay on my back and perspiration literally poured frommy brows. Don Juan laughed out loud, and rolled me back and forth for a while.The motion helped me catch my breath.I told him that I was simply awed by his physical prowess. He said, \"I've beentrying to draw your attention to it all along.\"\"You're not old at all, don Juan!\"\"Of course not. I've been trying to make you notice it.\"\"How do you do it?\"\"I don't do anything. My body feels fine, that's all. I treat myself very well,therefore, I have no reason to feel tired or ill at ease. The secret is not inwhat you do to yourself, but rather in what you don't do.\"I waited for an explanation. He seemed to be aware of my incapacity tounderstand. He smiled knowingly and stood up.\"This is a place of power,\" he said. \"Find a place for us to camp here on thishilltop.\"I began to protest. I wanted him to explain what I should not do to my body. Hemade an imperative gesture.\"Cut the guff,\" he said softly. \"This time just act for a change. It doesn'tmatter how long it takes you to find a suitable place to rest. It might take youall night. It is not important that you find the spot either. The importantissue is that you try to find it.\"I put away my writing pad and stood up. Don Juan reminded me, as he had donecountless times whenever he had asked me to find a resting place, that I had tolook without focusing on any particular spot; squinting my eyes until my viewwas blurred.I began to walk, scanning the ground with my half-closed eyes. Don Juan walked afew feet to my right and a couple of steps behind me.I covered the periphery of the hilltop first. My intention was to work my way ina spiral to the centre. But once I had covered the circumference of the hilltop,don Juan made me stop. He said I was letting my preference for routines takeover.In a sarcastic tone, he added that I was certainly covering the whole areasystematically but in such a stagnant way that I would not be able to perceivethe suitable place. He added that he himself knew where it was, so there was nochance for improvizations on my part.\"What should I be doing instead?\" I asked.Don Juan made me sit down. He then plucked a single leaf from a number of bushesand gave them to me. He ordered me to lie down on my back and loosen my belt andplace the leaves against the skin of my umbilical region. He supervised mymovements and instructed me to press the leaves against my body with both hands.He then ordered me to close my eyes and warned me that if I wanted perfectresults, I should not lose hold of the leaves, nor open my eyes, nor try to situp when he shifted my body to a position of power.He grabbed me by the right armpit and swirled me around. I had an invincibledesire to peek through my eyelids, but don Juan put his hand over my eyes. Hecommanded me to concern myself only with the feeling of warmth that was going tocome from the leaves.I lay motionless for a moment, and then I began to feel a strange heat emanatingfrom the leaves. I first sensed it with the palms of my hands. Then the warmthextended to my abdomen, and finally it literally invaded my entire body. In amatter of minutes my feet were burning up with a heat that reminded me of timeswhen I had had a high temperature.I told don Juan about the unpleasant sensation and my desire to take off myshoes. He said that he was going to help me stand up; that I should not open myeyes until he told me to; and that I should keep pressing the leaves to mystomach until I had found the suitable spot to rest.When I was on my feet, he whispered in my ear that I should open my eyes, andthat I should walk without a plan, letting the power of the leaves pull me andguide me.I began to walk aimlessly. The heat of my body was uncomfortable. I believed Iwas running a high temperature and I became absorbed in trying to conceive bywhat means don Juan had produced it.Don Juan was walking behind me, and he suddenly let out a scream that nearlyparalysed me. He explained, laughing, that abrupt noises scare away unpleasantspirits.I squinted my eyes, and walked back and forth for about half an hour. In thattime the uncomfortable heat of my body turned into a pleasurable warmth. Iexperienced a sensation of lightness as I paced up and down the hilltop.I felt disappointed, however. I had somehow expected to detect some kind ofvisual phenomenon, but there were no changes whatsoever in the periphery of myfield of vision: no unusual colours, or glare, or dark masses.I finally became tired of squinting my eyes and opened them. I was standing infront of a small ledge of sandstone, which was one of the few barren rockyplaces on the hilltop. The rest was dirt with widely spaced small bushes. Itseemed that the vegetation had burned sometime before and the new growth was notfully mature yet. For some unknown reason, I thought that the sandstone ledgewas beautiful. I stood in front of it for a long time. Then I simply sat down onit.\"Good! Good!\" don Juan said, and patted me on the back.He then told me to carefully pull the leaves from under my clothes, and placethem on the rock.As soon as I had taken the leaves away from my skin, I began to cool off. I tookmy pulse. It seemed to be normal.Don Juan laughed and called me 'doctor Carlos', and asked me if I could alsotake his pulse. He said that what I had felt was the power of the leaves; andthat that power had cleared me, and had enabled me to fulfill my task.I asserted in all sincerity that I had done nothing in particular; that I satdown on that place because I was tired, and because I found the colour of thesandstone very appealing.Don Juan did not say anything. He was standing a few feet away from me. Suddenlyhe jumped back, and with incredible agility ran and leaped over some bushes to ahigh crest of rocks some distance away.\"What's the matter?\" I asked, alarmed.\"Watch the direction in which the wind will blow your leaves,\" he said. \"Countthem quickly. The wind is coming. Keep half of them and put them back againstyour belly.\"I counted twenty leaves. I stuck ten under my shirt, and then a strong gust ofwind scattered the other ten in a westerly direction. I had the eerie feeling asI saw the leaves being blown off that a real entity was deliberately sweepingthem into the amorphous mass of green shrubbery.Don Juan walked back to where I was, and sat down next to me on my left, facingthe south.We did not speak a word for a long time. I did not know what to say. I wasexhausted. I wanted to close my eyes, but I did not dare.Don Juan must have noticed my state, and said that it was all right to fallasleep. He told me to place my hands on my abdomen over the leaves, and try tofeel that I was lying suspended on the bed of strings that he had made for me onthe 'place of my predilection'. I closed my eyes, and a memory of the peace andplenitude I had experienced while sleeping on that other hilltop invaded me. Iwanted to find out if I could actually feel I was suspended, but I fell asleep. I woke up just before the sunset. Sleeping had refreshed and invigorated me. DonJuan had also fallen asleep. He opened his eyes at the same time I did. It waswindy, but I did not feel cold. The leaves on my stomach seemed to have acted asa furnace, a heater of some sort.I examined the surroundings. The place I had selected to rest was like a smallbasin. One could actually sit on it as on a long couch. There was enough of arock wall to serve as a backrest. I also found out that don Juan had brought mywriting pads and placed them underneath my head.\"You found the right place,\" he said, smiling. \"And the whole operation tookplace as I had told you it would. Power guided you here without any plan on yourpart.\" The warmth that had radiated from the leaves, and that had kept me in such acomfortable state without any blankets or extra thick clothing was an absorbingphenomenon for me.\"What kind of leaves did you give me?\" I asked.\"They were just leaves,\" don Juan said.\"Do you mean that I could grab leaves from any bush, and they would produce thesame effect on me?\"\"No. I don't mean that you yourself can do that. You have no personal power. Imean that any kind of leaves would help you, providing that the person who givesthem to you has power. What helped you today was not the leaves but power.\"\"Your power, don Juan?\"\"I suppose you could say that it was my power, although that is not reallyaccurate. Power does not belong to anyone. Some of us may gather it, and then itcould be given directly to someone else. You see, the key to stored power isthat it can be used only to help someone else store power.\"I asked him if that meant that his power was limited only to helping others.Don Juan patiently explained that he could use his personal power however hepleased- in anything he himself wanted- but when it came to giving it directlyto another person, it was useless unless that person utilized it for his ownsearch of personal power.\"Everything a man does hinges on his personal power,\" don Juan went on.\"Therefore, for one who doesn't have any, the deeds of a powerful man areincredible. It takes power to even conceive what power is.\"This is what I have been trying to tell you all along. I know you don'tunderstand; and not because you don't want to, but because you have very littlepersonal power.\"\"What should I do, don Juan?\"\"Nothing. Just proceed as you are now. Power will find a way.\"He stood up and turned around in a complete circle, staring at everything in thesurroundings. His body moved at the same time his eyes moved. The total effectwas that of a hieratic [* hieratic- highly restrained and formal] mechanical toythat turned in a complete circle in a precise and unaltered movement.I looked at him with my mouth open. He hid a smile, cognizant of my surprise.\"Today you are going to hunt power in the darkness of the day,\" he said and satdown.\"I beg your pardon?\"\"Tonight you'll venture into those unknown hills. In the darkness they are nothills.\"\"What are they?\"\"They are something else. Something unthinkable for you, since you have neverwitnessed their existence.\"\"What do you mean, don Juan? You always scare me with that spooky talk.\"He laughed and kicked my calf softly.\"The world is a mystery,\" he said. \"And it is not at all as you picture it.\"He seemed to reflect for a moment. His head bobbed up and down with a rhythmicalshake, then he smiled and added, \"Well, the world is also as you picture it, butthat's not all there is to it; there is much more to it. You have been findingthat out all along, and perhaps tonight you will add one more piece.\"His tone sent a chill through my body.\"What are you planning to do?\" I asked.\"I don't plan anything. All is decided by the same power that allowed you tofind this spot.\"Don Juan got up and pointed to something in the distance. I assumed that hewanted me to stand up and look. I tried to jump to my feet, but before I hadfully stood up, don Juan pushed me down with great force.\"I didn't ask you to follow me,\" he said in a severe voice. Then he softened histone and added, \"You're going to have a difficult time tonight, and you willneed all the personal power you can muster. Stay where you are and save yourselffor later.\"He explained that he was not pointing at anything, but just making sure thatcertain things were out there. He assured me that everything was all right, andsaid that I should sit quietly and get busy because I had a lot of time to writebefore total darkness set in the land. His smile was contagious and verycomforting.\"But what are we going to do, don Juan?\"He shook his head from side to side in an exaggerated gesture of disbelief.\"Write,\" he commanded me and turned his back to me. There was nothing else forme to do. I worked on my notes until it was too dark to write. Don Juan maintained the same position all the time I was working. He seemed tobe absorbed in staring into the distance towards the west. But as soon as Istopped, he turned to me and said in a joking tone that the only ways to shut meup were to give me something to eat, or make me write, or put me to sleep.He took a small bundle from his knapsack, and ceremoniously opened it. Itcontained pieces of dry meat. He handed me a piece, took another for himself,and began to chew on it. He casually informed me that it was power food whichboth of us needed on that occasion. I was too hungry to think about thepossibility that the dry meat may have contained a psychotropic substance. Weate in complete silence until there was no more meat. By that time it was quitedark.Don Juan stood up and stretched his arms and back. He suggested I should do thesame. He said it was a good practice to stretch the entire body after sleeping,sitting, or walking.I followed his advice and some of the leaves I had kept under my shirt slidthrough the legs of my pants. I wondered if I should try to pick them up, but hesaid to forget about it; that there was no longer any need for them, and that Ishould let them fall as they might.Then don Juan came very close to me and whispered in my right ear that I wassupposed to follow him at very close range and imitate everything he did. Hesaid that we were safe on the spot where we stood because we were, so to speak,at the edge of the night.\"This is not the night,\" he whispered, stomping on the rock where we werestanding. \"The night is out there.\"He pointed to the darkness all around us.He then checked my carrying net to see if the food gourds and my writing padswere secured. In a soft voice he said that a warrior always made sure thateverything was in proper order, not because he believed that he was going tosurvive the ordeal he was about to undertake, but because that was part of hisimpeccable behaviour.Instead of making me feel relieved, his admonitions created the completecertainty that my doom was approaching. I wanted to weep. Don Juan was, I wassure, completely aware of the effect of his words.\"Trust your personal power,\" he said in my ear. \"That's all one has in thiswhole mysterious world.\"He pulled me gently and we started to walk. He took the lead a couple of stepsahead of me. I followed him with my eyes fixed on the ground. Somehow I did notdare to look around, and focusing my sight on the ground made me feel strangelycalm. It almost mesmerized me.After a short walk don Juan stopped. He whispered that total darkness was near,and that he was going to get ahead of me, but was going to give me his positionby imitating the cry of a specific small owl. He reminded me that I already knewthat his particular imitation was raspy at the beginning and then it became asmellow as the cry of a real owl. He warned me to be deadly aware of other owlcries which did not bear that mark.By the time don Juan finished giving me all those instructions, I waspractically panic-stricken. I grabbed him by the arm, and would not let go. Ittook two or three minutes for me to calm myself enough so that I couldarticulate my words. A nervous ripple ran along my stomach and abdomen, and keptme from talking coherently.In a calm soft voice he urged me to get hold of myself because the darkness waslike the wind; an unknown entity at large that could trick me if I was notcareful. And I had to be perfectly calm in order to deal with it.\"You must let yourself go so your personal power will merge with the power ofthe night,\" he said in my ear.He said he was going to move ahead of me, and I had another attack of irrationalfear.\"This is insane,\" I protested.Don Juan did not get angry or impatient. He laughed quietly and said somethingin my ear which I did not quite understand.\"What did you say?\" I said loudly through chattering teeth.Don Juan put his hand over my mouth, and whispered that a warrior acted as if heknew what he was doing when in effect he knew nothing. He repeated one statementthree or four times, as if he wanted me to memorize it. He said, \"A warrior isimpeccable when he trusts his personal power regardless of whether it is smallor enormous.\"After a short wait he asked me if I was all right. I nodded and he went swiftlyout of sight with hardly a sound.I tried to look around. I seemed to be standing in an area of thick vegetation.All I could distinguish was the dark mass of shrubs, or perhaps small trees. Iconcentrated my attention on sounds, but nothing was outstanding. The whizzingof the wind muffled every other sound except the sporadic piercing cries oflarge owls and the whistling of other birds.I waited for a while in a state of utmost attention. And then came the raspyprolonged cry of a small owl. I had no doubt it was don Juan. It came from aplace behind me. I turned around and began to walk in that direction. I movedslowly because I felt inextricably encumbered by the darkness.I walked for perhaps ten minutes. Suddenly some dark mass jumped in front of me.I screamed and fell backward on my seat. My ears began buzzing. The fright wasso great that it cut my wind. I had to open my mouth to breathe.\"Stand up,\" don Juan said softly. \"I didn't mean to scare you. I just came tomeet you.\"He said that he had been watching my crappy way of walking and that when I movedin the darkness I looked like a crippled old lady trying to tiptoe between mudpuddles. He found this image funny and laughed out loud.He then proceeded to demonstrate a special way of walking in the darkness; a waywhich he called 'the gait of power'. He stooped over in front of me, and made merun my hands over his back and knees in order to get an idea of the position ofhis body. Don Juan's trunk was slightly bent forward, but his spine wasstraight. His knees were also slightly bent.He walked slowly in front of me so I could take notice that he raised his kneesalmost to his chest every time he took a step. Then he actually ran out of sightand came back again. I could not conceive how he could run in total darkness.\"The gait of power is for running at night,\" he whispered in my ear.He urged me to try it myself. I told him that I was sure I would break my legsfalling into a crevice or against a rock. Don Juan very calmly said that thegait of power was completely safe.I pointed out that the only way I could understand his acts was by assuming heknew those hills to perfection and thus could avoid the pitfalls.Don Juan took my head in his hands and whispered forcefully, \"This is the night.And it is power!\"He let go of my head. Then he added in a soft voice that at night the world wasdifferent, and that his ability to run in the darkness had nothing to do withhis knowledge of those hills. He said that the key to it was to let one'spersonal power flow out freely so it could merge with the power of the night.Once that power took over, there was no chance for a slip-up. He added, in atone of utmost seriousness, that if I doubted it I should consider for a momentwhat was taking place. For a man of his age to run in those hills at that hourwould be suicidal if the power of the night was not guiding him.\"Look!\" he said and ran swiftly out into the darkness and came back again.The way his body moved was so extraordinary that I could not believe what I wasseeing. He sort of jogged on the same spot for a moment. The manner in which helifted his legs reminded me of a sprinter doing preliminary warm-up exercises.He told me to follow him.I did it with utter constraint and uneasiness. With extreme care, I tried tolook where I was stepping, but it was impossible to judge distance.Don Juan came back and jogged by my side. He whispered that I had to abandonmyself to the power of the night and trust the little bit of personal power thatI had, or I would never be able to move with freedom. The darkness wasencumbering only because I relied on my sight for everything I did not knowingthat another way to move was to let power be the guide.I tried various times without success. I simply could not let go. The fear ofinjuring my legs was overpowering. Don Juan ordered me to keep on moving in thesame spot, and to try to feel as if I were actually using the gait of power.He said that he was going to run ahead, and that I should wait for his owl'scry. He disappeared in the darkness before I could say anything. I closed myeyes at times and jogged on the same spot with my knees and trunk bent forperhaps an hour. Little by little my tension began to ease up until I was fairlycomfortable. Then I heard don Juan's cry.I ran five or six yards in the direction where the cry came from, trying to'abandon myself', as don Juan had suggested. But stumbling into a bushimmediately brought back my feelings of insecurity.Don Juan was waiting for me and corrected my posture. He insisted I should firstcurl my fingers against my palms, stretching out the thumb and index of eachhand.He said that, in his opinion, I was just indulging myself in my feelings ofinadequacy since I knew for a fact that I could always see fairly well no matterhow dark the night was if I did not focus on anything but kept scanning theground right in front of me.He said the gait of power was similar to finding a place to rest. Both entaileda sense of abandon, and a sense of trust. The gait of power required that onekeep the eyes on the ground directly in front because even a glance to eitherside would produce an alteration in the flow of movement.He explained that bending the trunk forward was necessary in order to lower theeyes, and the reason for lifting the knees up to the chest was because the stepshad to be very short and safe. He warned me that I was going to stumble a greatdeal at first, but he assured me that with practice I could run as swiftly andas safely as I could in the daytime. For hours I tried to imitate his movements and get into the mood he recommended.He would very patiently jog on the same spot in front of me; or he would takeoff in a short run, and return to where I was so I could see how he moved. Hewould even push me, and make me run a few yards.Then he took off, and called me with a series of owl cries. In some inexplicableway I moved with an unexpected degree of self-confidence. To my knowledge, I haddone nothing to warrant that feeling, but my body seemed to be cognizant ofthings without thinking about them. For example, I could not really see thejagged rocks in my way, but my body always managed to step on the edges andnever in the crevices, except for a few mishaps when I lost my balance because Ibecame distracted.The degree of concentration needed to keep scanning the area directly in fronthad to be total. As don Juan had warned me, any slight glance to the side or toofar ahead altered the flow.I located don Juan after a long search. He was sitting by some dark shapes thatseemed to be trees. He came towards me and said that I was doing very well, butit was time to quit because he had been using his whistle long enough, and hewas sure that by then it could be imitated by others.I agreed that it was time to stop. I was nearly exhausted by my attempts. I feltrelieved and asked him who would imitate his cry.\"Powers, allies, spirits, who knows?\" he said in a whisper. He explained thatthose 'entities of the night' usually made very melodious sounds, but were at agreat disadvantage in reproducing the raspiness of human cries or birdwhistlings. He cautioned me to always stop moving if I ever heard such a sound,and to keep in mind all he had said because at some other time I might need tomake the proper identification.In a reassuring tone he said that I had a very good idea what the gait of powerwas like, and that in order to master it I needed only a slight push which Icould get on another occasion when we ventured again into the night. He pattedme on the shoulder and announced that he was ready to leave. \"Let's get out ofhere,\" he said and began running.\"Wait! Wait!\" I screamed frantically. \"Let's walk.\" Don Juan stopped, and tookoff his hat.\"Golly!\" he said in a tone of perplexity. \"We're in a fix. You know that Icannot walk in the dark. I can only run. I'll break my legs if I walk.\"I had the feeling he was grinning when he said that, although I could not seehis face. He added in a confidential tone that he was too old to walk, and thatthe little bit of the gait of power that I had learned that night had to bestretched to meet the occasion.\"If we don't use the gait of power we will be mowed down like grass,\" hewhispered in my ear.\"By whom?\"\"There are things in the night that act on people,\" he whispered in a tone thatsent chills through my body.He said that it was not important that I keep up with him because he was goingto give repeated signals of four owl cries at a time so I could follow him.I suggested that we should stay in those hills until dawn and then leave. Heretorted in a very dramatic tone that to stay there would be suicidal; and evenif we came out alive, the night would have drained our personal power to thepoint that we could not avoid being the victims of the first hazard of the day.\"Let's not waste any more time,\" he said with a note of urgency in his voice.\"Let's get out of here.\"He reassured me that he would try to go as slowly as possible. His finalinstructions were that I should try not to utter a sound, not even a gasp- nomatter what happened. He gave me the general direction we were going to go in,and began running at a markedly slower pace. I followed him. But no matter howslow he moved, I could not keep up with him, and he soon disappeared in thedarkness ahead of me.After I was alone, I became aware that I had adopted a fairly fast walk withoutrealizing it. That came as a shock to me. I tried to maintain that pace for along while, and then I heard don Juan's call a little bit to my right. Hewhistled four times in succession.After a very short while, I again heard his owl cry; this time to my far right.In order to follow it I had to make a forty-five degree turn. I began to move inthe new direction, expecting that the other three cries of the set would give mea better orientation.I heard a new whistle, which placed don Juan almost in the direction where wehad started. I stopped and listened. I heard a very sharp noise a short distanceaway; something like the sound of two rocks being struck against each other. Istrained to listen, and detected a series of soft noises as if two rocks werebeing struck gently.There was another owl's cry and then I knew what don Juan had meant. There wassomething truly melodious about it. It was definitely longer and even moremellow than a real owl's.I felt a strange sensation of fright. My stomach contracted as if something werepulling me down from the middle part of my body. I turned around and started tosemi-jog in the opposite direction.I heard a faint owl cry in the distance. There was a rapid succession of threemore cries. They were don Juan's. I ran in their direction. I felt that he musthave then been a good quarter of a mile away, and if he kept up that pace, Iwould soon be inextricably alone in those hills. I could not understand why donJuan would run ahead, when he could have run around me if he needed to keep thatpace.I noticed then that there seemed to be something moving with me to my left. Icould almost see it in the extreme periphery of my visual field. I was about topanic, but a sobering thought crossed my mind. I could not possibly see anythingin the dark. I wanted to stare in that direction but I was afraid to lose mymomentum.Another owl cry jolted me out of my deliberations. It came from my left. I didnot follow it because it was without a doubt the most sweet and melodious cry Ihad ever heard. It did not frighten me though. There was something veryappealing, or perhaps haunting, or even sad about it.Then a very swift dark mass crossed from left to right ahead of me. Thesuddenness of its movements made me look ahead. I lost my balance and crashednoisily against some shrubs. I fell down on my side, and then I heard themelodious cry a few steps to my left.I stood up, but before I could start moving forward again, there was another crymore demanding and compelling than the first. It was as if something therewanted me to stop and listen. The sound of that owl cry was so prolonged andgentle that it eased my fears. I would have actually stopped had I not heard atthat precise moment don Juan's four raspy cries. They seemed to be nearer. Ijumped and took off in that direction.After a moment I noticed again a certain flicker or a wave in the darkness to myleft. It was not a sight proper, but rather a feeling, and yet I was almost sureI was perceiving it with my eyes. It moved faster than I did, and again itcrossed from left to right, making me lose my balance. This time I did not falldown, and strangely enough not falling down annoyed me.I suddenly became angry, and the incongruency of my feelings threw me into truepanic. I tried to accelerate my pace. I wanted to give out an owl cry myself tolet don Juan know where I was, but I did not dare to disobey his instructions.At that moment some gruesome thing came to my attention. There was actuallysomething like an animal to my left, almost touching me. I jumped involuntarilyand veered to my right. The fright almost suffocated me. I was so intenselygripped by fear that there were no thoughts in my mind as I moved in thedarkness as fast as I could.My fear seemed to be a bodily sensation that had nothing to do with my thoughts.I found that condition very unusual.In the course of my life, my fears had always been mounted on an intellectualmatrix and had been engendered by threatening social situations, or by peoplebehaving towards me in dangerous ways.This time, however, my fear was a true novelty. It came from an unknown part ofthe world, and hit me in an unknown part of myself.I heard an owl cry very close and slightly to my left. I could not catch thedetails of its pitch, but it seemed to be don Juan's. It was not melodious. Islowed down. Another cry followed. The raspiness of don Juan's whistles wasthere, so I moved faster. A third whistle came from a very short distance away.I could distinguish a dark mass of rocks or perhaps trees. I heard another owl'scry and I thought that don Juan was waiting for me because we were out of thefield of danger. I was almost at the edge of the darker area when a fifth cryfroze me on the spot.I strained to see ahead into the dark area, but a sudden rustling sound to myleft made me turn around in time to notice a black object, blacker than thesurroundings, rolling or sliding by my side. I gasped and jumped away. I heard aclicking sound as if someone were smacking his lips, and then a very large darkmass lurched out of the darker area. It was square, like a door, perhaps eightto ten feet high.The suddenness of its appearance made me scream. For a moment my fright was allout of proportion, but a second later I found myself awesomely calm, staring atthe dark shape.My reactions were, as far as I was concerned, another total novelty. Some partof myself seemed to pull me towards the dark area with an eerie insistence,while another part of me resisted. It was as if I wanted to find out for sure onthe one hand, and on the other I wanted to run hysterically out of there.I barely heard don Juan's owl cries. They seemed to be very close by and theyseemed to be frantic; they were longer and raspier as though he was whistlingwhile he ran towards me.Suddenly I seemed to regain control of myself and was able to turn around; andfor a moment I ran just as don Juan had been wanting me to.\"Don Juan!\" I shouted when I found him. He put his hand on my mouth, andsignalled me to follow. We both jogged at a very comfortable pace until we cameto the sandstone ledge where we had been before. We sat in absolute silence on the ledge for about an hour until dawn. Then weate food from the gourds. Don Juan said that we had to remain on the ledge untilmidday, and we were not going to sleep at all, but were going to talk as ifnothing was out of the ordinary.He asked me to relate in detail everything that had happened to me from themoment he had left me. When I concluded my narration he stayed quiet for a longtime. He seemed to be immersed in deep thought.\"It doesn't look too good,\" he finally said. \"What happened to you last nightwas very serious, so serious that you cannot venture into the night alone anymore. From now on the entities of the night won't leave you alone.\"\"What happened to me last night, don Juan?\"\"You stumbled on some entities which are in the world, and which act on people.You know nothing about them because you have never encountered them. Perhaps itwould be more proper to call them entities of the mountains. They don't reallybelong to the night. I call them entities of the night because one can perceivethem in the darkness with greater ease.\"They are here around us at all times. In daylight, however, it is moredifficult to perceive them simply because the world is familiar to us, and thatwhich is familiar takes precedence. In the darkness, on the other hand,everything is equally strange, and very few things take precedence, so we aremore susceptible to those entities at night.\"\"But are they real, don Juan?\"\"Of course! They are so real that ordinarily they kill people, especially thosewho stray into the wilderness and have no personal power.\"\"If you knew they were so dangerous, why did you leave me alone there?\"\"There is only one way to learn, and that way is to get down to business. Toonly talk about power is useless. If you want to know what power is, and if youwant to store it, you must tackle everything yourself.\"The road of knowledge and power is very difficult and very long. You may havenoticed that I have not let you venture into the darkness by yourself until lastnight. You did not have enough power to do that. Now you do have enough to wagea good battle, but not enough to stay in the dark by yourself.\"\"What would happen if I did?\"\"You'll die. The entities of the night will crush you like a bug.\"\"Does that mean that I cannot spend a night by myself?\"\"You can spend the night by yourself in your bed, but not in the mountains.\"\"What about the flatlands?\"\"It applies only to the wilderness where there are no people around, especiallythe wilderness in high mountains. Since the natural abodes of the entities ofthe night are rocks and crevices, you cannot go to the mountains from now onunless you have stored enough personal power.\"\"But how can I store personal power?\"\"You are doing it by living the way I have recommended. Little by little you areplugging all your points of drainage. You don't have to be deliberate about itbecause power always finds a way. Take me as an example. I didn't know I wasstoring power when I first began to learn the ways of a warrior. Just like you,I thought I wasn't doing anything in particular, but that was not so. Power hasthe peculiarity of being unnoticeable when it is being stored.\"I asked him to explain how he had arrived at the conclusion that it wasdangerous for me to stay by myself in the darkness.\"The entities of the night moved along your left,\" he said. \"They were trying tomerge with your death. Especially the door that you saw. It was an opening, youknow, and it would have pulled you until you had been forced to cross it. Andthat would have been your end.\"I mentioned in the best way I could that I thought it was very strange thatthings always happened when he was around, and that it was as if he had beenconcocting all the events himself.The times I had been alone in the wilderness at night had always been perfectlynormal and uneventful. I had never experienced shadows or strange noises. Infact, I had never been frightened by anything.Don Juan chuckled softly, and said that everything was proof he had enoughpersonal power to call a myriad of things to his aid. I had the feeling heperhaps was hinting that he actually had called on some people as hisconfederates.Don Juan seemed to have read my thoughts and laughed out loud.\"Don't tax yourself with explanations,\" he said. \"What I said makes no sense toyou simply because you still don't have enough personal power. Yet you have morethan when you started, so things have begun to happen to you.\"You already had a powerful encounter with the fog and lightning. It is notimportant that you understand what happened to you that night. What's importantis that you have acquired the memory of it. The bridge and everything else yousaw that night will be repeated someday when you have enough personal power.\"\"For what purpose would all that be repeated, don Juan?\"\"I don't know. I am not you. Only you can answer that. We are all different.\"That's why I had to leave you by yourself last night, although I knew it wasmortally dangerous. You had to test yourself against those entities. The reasonI chose the owl's cry was because owls are the entities' messengers. To imitatethe cry of an owl brings them out. They became dangerous to you, not becausethey are naturally malevolent, but because you were not impeccable.\"There is something in you that is very chintzy and I know what it is. You arejust humouring me. You have been humouring everybody all along, and, of course,that places you automatically above everyone and everything.\"But you know yourself that that cannot be so. You are only a man, and your lifeis too brief to encompass all the wonders and all the horrors of this marvellousworld. Therefore, your humouring is chintzy. It cuts you down to a crappy size.\" I wanted to protest. Don Juan had nailed me as he had done dozens of timesbefore. For a moment I became angry. But, as it had happened before, writingdetached me enough so I could remain impassive.\"I think I have a cure for it,\" don Juan went on after a long interval. \"Evenyou would agree with me if you could remember what you did last night. You ranas fast as any sorcerer only when your opponent became unbearable. We both knowthat, and I believe I have already found a worthy opponent for you.\"\"What are you going to do, don Juan?\"He did not answer. He stood up and stretched his body. He seemed to contractevery muscle. He ordered me to do the same.\"You must stretch your body many times during the day,\" he said. \"The more timesthe better, but only after a long period of work or a long period of rest.\"\"What kind of opponent are you going to find for me?\" I asked.\"Unfortunately, only our fellow men are our worthy opponents,\" he said. \"Otherentities have no volition of their own, and one must go to meet them and lurethem out. Our fellow men, on the contrary, are relentless.\"We have talked long enough,\" don Juan said in an abrupt tone and turned to me.\"Before we leave you must do one more thing; the most important of all. I amgoing to tell you something right now to set your mind at ease about why you arehere.\"The reason you keep on coming to see me is very simple. Every time you haveseen me your body has learned certain things, even against your desire; andfinally your body now needs to come back to me to learn more.\"Let's say that your body knows that it is going to die, even though you neverthink about it. So I've been telling your body that I too am going to die, andbefore I do I would like to show your body certain things; things which youcannot give to your body yourself.For example, your body needs fright. It likes it. Your body needs the darknessand the wind. Your body now knows the gait of power and can't wait to try it.Your body needs personal power and can't wait to have it. So let's say then thatyour body returns to see me because I am its friend.\" Don Juan remained silent for a long while. He seemed to be struggling with histhoughts.Finally, he said, \"I've told you that the secret of a strong body is not in whatyou do to it but in what you don't do. \"Now it is time for you not to do whatyou always do. Sit here until we leave and 'not-do'.\"\"I don't follow you, don Juan.\"He put his hands over my notes, and took them away from me. He carefully closedthe pages of my notebook, secured it with its rubber band, and then threw itlike a disc far into the chaparral.I was shocked and began to protest, but he put his hand over my mouth. Hepointed to a large bush and told me to fix my attention, not on the leaves, buton the shadows of the leaves. He said that running in the darkness did not haveto be spurred by fear, but could be a very natural reaction of a jubilant bodythat knew how to not-do.He repeated over and over in a whisper in my right ear that to not-do what Iknew how to 'do' was the key to power. In the case of looking at a tree, what Iknew how to do was to focus immediately on the foliage. The shadows of theleaves, or the spaces in between the leaves were never my concern. His lastadmonitions were to start focusing on the shadows of the leaves on one singlebranch and then eventually work my way to the whole tree, and not to let my eyesgo back to the leaves because the first deliberate step to storing personalpower was to allow the body to not-do.Perhaps it was because of my fatigue or my nervous excitation, but I became soimmersed in the shadows of the leaves that by the time don Juan stood up I couldalmost group the dark masses of shadows as effectively as I normally grouped thefoliage. The total effect was startling. I told don Juan that I would like tostay longer.He laughed and patted me on my hat. \"I've told you,\" he said. \"The body likesthings like this.\" He then said that I should let my stored power guide methrough the bushes to my notebook. He gently pushed me into the chaparral.I walked aimlessly for a moment and then I came upon it. I thought that I musthave unconsciously memorized the direction in which don Juan had thrown it.He explained the event saying that I went directly to the notebook because mybody had been soaked for hours in not-doing. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"15. Not-Doing Wednesday, 1962 April 11 Upon returning to his house, don Juan recommended that I work on my notes as ifnothing had happened to me; and that I not mention or even be concerned with anyof the events I had experienced.After a day's rest he announced that we had to leave the area for a few daysbecause it was advisable to put distance between us and those 'entities'. Hesaid that they had affected me deeply, although I was not noticing their effectyet because my body was not sensitive enough. In a short while, however, I wouldfall seriously ill if I did not go to my 'place of predilection' to be cleansedand restored.We left before dawn and drove north. After an exhausting drive and a fast hike,we arrived at the hilltop in the late afternoon.Don Juan, as he had done before, covered the spot where I had once slept withsmall branches and leaves. Then he gave me a handful of leaves to put againstthe skin of my abdomen, and told me to lie down and rest. He fixed another placefor himself slightly to my left, about five feet away from my head, and he alsolaid down.In a matter of minutes, I began to feel an exquisite warmth and a sense ofsupreme well-being. It was a sense of physical comfort; a sensation of beingsuspended in mid-air. I could fully agree with don Juan's statement that the'bed of strings' would keep me floating. I commented on the unbelievable qualityof my sensory experience. Don Juan said in a factual tone that the 'bed' wasmade for that purpose.\"I can't believe that this is possible!\" I exclaimed.Don Juan took my statement literally and scolded me. He said he was tired of myacting as an ultimately important being that has to be given proof over and overthat the world is unknown and marvellous.I tried to explain that a rhetorical exclamation had no significance. Heretorted, that if that were so, I could have chosen another statement. It seemedthat he was seriously annoyed with me. I sat up halfway and began to apologize,but he laughed, and imitating my manner of speaking suggested a series ofhilarious rhetorical exclamations I could have used instead. I ended up laughingat the calculated absurdity of some of his proposed alternatives.He giggled and in a soft tone reminded me that I should abandon myself to thesensation of floating.The soothing feeling of peace and plenitude that I experienced in thatmysterious place aroused some deeply buried emotions in me. I began to talkabout my life. I confessed that I had never respected or liked anybody, not evenmyself, and that I had always felt I was inherently evil, and thus my attitudetowards others was always veiled with a certain bravado and daring.\"True,\" don Juan said. \"You don't like yourself at all.\"He cackled and told me that he had been 'seeing' while I talked. Hisrecommendation was that I should not have remorse for anything I had donebecause to isolate one's acts as being mean, or ugly, or evil was to place anunwarranted importance on the self.I moved nervously and the bed of leaves made a rustling sound. Don Juan saidthat if I wanted to rest I should not make my leaves feel agitated, and that Ishould imitate him and lie without making a single movement.He added that in his seeing he had come across one of my moods. He struggled fora moment, seemingly to find a proper word, and said that the mood in questionwas a frame of mind I continually lapsed into. He described it as a sort of trapdoor that opened at unexpected times and swallowed me.I asked him to be more specific. He replied that it was impossible to bespecific about seeing.Before I could say anything else he told me I should relax, but not fall asleep,and be in a state of awareness for as long as I could. He said that the bed ofstrings was made exclusively to allow a warrior to arrive at a certain state ofpeace and well-being.In a dramatic tone don Juan stated that well-being was a condition one had togroom; a condition one had to become acquainted with in order to seek it.\"You don't know what well-being is because you have never experienced it,\" hesaid.I disagreed with him. But he continued arguing that well-being was anachievement one had to deliberately seek. He said that the only thing I knew howto seek was a sense of disorientation, ill-being, and confusion.He laughed mockingly and assured me that in order to accomplish the feat ofmaking myself miserable I had to work in a most intense fashion; and that it wasabsurd I had never realized I could work just the same in making myself completeand strong.\"The trick is in what one emphasizes,\" he said. \"We either make ourselvesmiserable, or we make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same.\"I closed my eyes and relaxed again and began to feel I was floating. For a shortwhile it was as if I were actually moving through space, like a leaf. Althoughit was utterly pleasurable, the feeling somehow reminded me of times when I hadbecome sick and dizzy and would experience a sensation of spinning. I thoughtperhaps I had eaten something bad.I heard don Juan talking to me, but I did not really make an effort to listen. Iwas trying to make a mental inventory of all the things I had eaten that day,but I could not become interested in it. It did not seem to matter.\"Watch the way the sunlight changes,\" he said. His voice was clear. I thought itwas like water, fluid and warm.The sky was totally free of clouds towards the west and the sunlight wasspectacular. Perhaps the fact that don Juan was cueing me made the yellowishglow of the afternoon sun truly magnificent.\"Let that glow kindle you,\" don Juan said. \"Before the sun goes down today youmust be perfectly calm and restored because tomorrow, or the day after, you aregoing to learn not-doing.\"\"Learn not doing what?\" I asked.\"Never mind now,\" he said. \"Wait until we are in those lava mountains.\"He pointed to some distant, jagged, dark, menacing-looking peaks towards thenorth. Thursday, 1962 April 12 We reached the high desert around the lava mountains in the late afternoon. Inthe distance the dark brown lava mountains looked almost sinister. The sun wasvery low on the horizon, and shone on the western face of the solidified lavatinting its dark brownness with a dazzling array of yellow reflections.I could not keep my eyes away. Those peaks were truly mesmerizing.By the end of the day, the bottom slopes of the mountains were in sight. Therewas very little vegetation on the high desert. All I could see were cacti and akind of tall grass that grew in tufts.Don Juan stopped to rest. He sat down, carefully propped his food gourds againsta rock, and said that we were going to camp on that spot for the night. He hadpicked a relatively high place. From where I stood I could see quite a distanceaway all around us.It was a cloudy day and the twilight quickly enveloped the area. I becameinvolved in watching the speed with which the crimson clouds on the west fadedinto a uniform thick dark grey.Don Juan got up and went to the bushes. By the time he came back, the silhouetteof the lava mountains was a dark mass. He sat down next to me, and called myattention to what seemed to be a natural formation on the mountains towards thenortheast. It was a spot which had a colour much lighter than its surroundings.While the whole range of lava mountains looked uniformly dark brown in thetwilight, the spot he was pointing at was actually yellowish or dark beige.I could not figure out what it could be. I stared at it for a long time. Itseemed to be moving. I fancied it to be pulsating. When I squinted my eyes itactually rippled as if the wind were moving it.\"Look at it fixedly!\" don Juan commanded me. At one moment, after I hadmaintained my stare for quite a while, I felt that the whole range of mountainswas moving towards me. That feeling was accompanied by an unusual agitation inthe pit of my stomach. The discomfort became so acute that I stood up.\"Sit down!\" don Juan yelled, but I was already on my feet.From my new point of view, the yellowish formation was lower on the side of themountains. I sat down again without taking my eyes away, and the formationshifted to a higher place. I stared at it for an instant, and suddenly Iarranged everything into the correct perspective. I realized that what I hadbeen looking at was not in the mountains at all but was really a piece ofyellowish green cloth hanging from a tall cactus in front of me.I laughed out loud and explained to don Juan that the twilight had helped tocreate an optical illusion.He got up and walked to the place where the piece of cloth was hanging, took itdown, folded it, and put it inside his pouch.\"What are you doing that for?\" I asked.\"Because this piece of cloth has power,\" he said casually. \"For a moment youwere doing fine with it and there is no way of knowing what may have happened ifyou had remained seated.\" Friday, 1962 April 13 At the crack of dawn we headed for the mountains. They were surprisingly faraway. By midday we walked into one of the canyons. There was some water inshallow pools. We sat to rest in the shade of a hanging cliff.The mountains were clumps of a monumental lava flow. The solidified lava hadweathered over the millennia into a porous dark brown rock. Only a few sturdyweeds grew between the rocks and in the cracks.Looking up at the almost perpendicular walls of the canyon, I had a weirdsensation in the pit of my stomach. The walls were hundreds of feet high, andgave me the feeling that they were closing in on me. The sun was almostoverhead, slightly towards the southwest.\"Stand here,\" don Juan said, and he maneuvered my body until I was lookingtowards the sun.He told me to look fixedly at the mountain walls above me.The sight was stupendous. The magnificent height of the lava flow staggered myimagination. I began to wonder what a volcanic upheaval it must have been. Ilooked up and down the sides of the canyon various times. I became immersed inthe richness of colour in the rock wall. There were specks of every conceivablehue. There were patches of light grey moss or lichen in every rock. I lookedright above my head, and noticed that the sunlight was producing the mostexquisite reflections when it hit the brilliant specks of the solidified lava.I stared at an area in the mountains where the sunlight was being reflected. Asthe sun moved, the intensity diminished, then it faded completely.I looked across the canyon, and saw another area of the same exquisite lightrefractions. I told don Juan what was happening, and then I spotted another areaof light, and then another in a different place, and another, until the wholecanyon was blotched with big patches of light.I felt dizzy. Even if I closed my eyes I could still see the brilliant lights. Iheld my head in my hands and tried to crawl under the hanging cliff, but donJuan grabbed my arm firmly and imperatively told me to look at the walls of themountains, and try to figure out spots of heavy darkness in the midst of thefields of light.I did not want to look because the glare bothered my eyes. I said that what washappening to me was similar to staring into a sunny street through a window, andthen seeing the window frame as a dark silhouette everywhere else.Don Juan shook his head from side to side and began to chuckle. He let go of myarm, and we sat down again under the hanging cliff.I was jotting down my impressions of the surroundings when don Juan, after along silence, suddenly spoke in a dramatic tone.\"I have brought you here to teach you one thing,\" he said and paused. \"You aregoing to learn not-doing. We might as well talk about it because there is noother way for you to proceed. I thought you might catch on to not-doing withoutmy having to say anything. I was wrong.\"\"I don't know what you're talking about, don Juan.\"\"It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"I am going to tell you about something that isvery simple, but very difficult to perform. I am going to talk to you aboutnot-doing in spite of the fact that there is no way to talk about it because itis the body that does it.\"He stared at me in glances and then said that I had to pay the utmost attentionto what he was going to say.I closed my notebook, but to my amazement he insisted that I should keep onwriting.\"Not-doing is so difficult and so powerful that you should not mention it,\" hewent on. \"Not until you have stopped the world. Only then can you talk about itfreely if that's what you'd want to do.\"Don Juan looked around and then pointed to a large rock.\"That rock over there is a rock because of doing,\" he said.We looked at each other and he smiled. I waited for an explanation, but heremained silent. Finally I had to say that I had not understood what he meant.\"That's doing!\" he exclaimed.\"Pardon me?\"\"That's also doing.\"\"What are you talking about, don Juan?\"\"Doing is what makes that rock a rock, and that bush a bush. Doing is what makesyou yourself and me myself.\"I told him that his explanation did not explain anything. He laughed andscratched his temples.\"That's the problem with talking,\" he said. \"It always makes one confuse theissues. If one starts talking about doing, one always ends up talking aboutsomething else. It is better to just act.\"Take that rock for instance. To look at it is doing, but to see it isnot-doing.\"I had to confess that his words were not making sense to me.\"Oh yes they do!\" he exclaimed. \"But you are convinced that they don't becausethat is your doing. That is the way you act towards me and the world.\"He again pointed to the rock.\"That rock is a rock because of all the things you know how to do to it,\" hesaid. \"I call that doing. A man of knowledge, for instance, knows that the rockis a rock only because of doing, so if he doesn't want the rock to be a rock allhe has to do is not-doing. See what I mean?\"I did not understand him at all. He laughed and made another attempt atexplaining.\"The world is the world because you know the doing involved in making it so,\" hesaid. \"If you didn't know its doing, the world would be different.\"He examined me with curiosity. I stopped writing. I just wanted to listen tohim. He went on explaining that without that certain doing there would benothing familiar in the surroundings.He leaned over and picked up a small rock between the thumb and index of hisleft hand, and held it in front of my eyes.\"This is a pebble because you know the doing involved in making it into apebble,\" he said.\"What are you saying?\" I asked with a feeling of bona fide confusion.Don Juan smiled. He seemed to be trying to hide a mischievous delight.\"I don't know why you are so confused,\" he said. \"Words are your predilection.You should be in heaven.\"He gave me a mysterious look and raised his brows two or three times. Then hepointed again to the small rock he was holding in front of my eyes.\"I say that you are making this into a pebble because you know the doinginvolved in it,\" he said. \"Now, in order to stop the world you must stop doing.\"He seemed to know that I still had not understood and smiled, shaking his head.He then took a twig and pointed to the uneven edge of the pebble.\"In the case of this little rock,\" he went on, \"the first thing which doing doesto it is to shrink it to this size. So the proper thing to do, which a warriordoes if he wants to stop the world, is to enlarge a little rock, or any otherthing, by not-doing.\"He stood up and placed the pebble on a boulder and then asked me to come closerand examine it. He told me to look at the holes and depressions in the pebbleand try to pick out the minute detail in them. He said that if I could pick outthe detail, the holes and depressions would disappear and I would understandwhat not-doing meant.\"This damn pebble is going to drive you crazy today,\" he said.I must have had a look of bewilderment on my face. He looked at me and laugheduproariously. Then he pretended to get angry with the pebble, and hit it two orthree times with his hat.I urged him to clarify his point. I argued that it was possible for him toexplain anything he wanted to if he made an effort.He gave me a sly glance and shook his head as if the situation were hopeless.\"Sure I can explain anything,\" he said, laughing. \"But could you understand it?\"I was taken aback by his insinuation.\"Doing makes you separate the pebble from the larger boulder,\" he continued. \"Ifyou want to learn not-doing, let's say that you have to join them.\"He pointed to the small shadow that the pebble cast on the boulder, and saidthat it was not a shadow but a glue which bound them together. He then turnedaround and walked away, saying that he was coming back to check on me later. I stared at the pebble for a long time. I could not focus my attention on theminute detail in the holes and depressions, but the tiny shadow that the pebblecast on the boulder became a most interesting point. Don Juan was right. It waslike a glue. It moved and shifted. I had the impression it was being squeezedfrom underneath the pebble.When don Juan returned I related to him what I had observed about the shadow.\"That's a good beginning,\" he said. \"A warrior can tell all kinds of things fromthe shadows.\"He then suggested that I should take the pebble and bury it somewhere. \"Why?\" Iasked.\"You've been watching it for a long time,\" he said. \"It has something of younow. A warrior always tries to affect the force of doing by changing it intonot-doing. Doing would be to leave the pebble lying around because it is merelya small rock. Not-doing would be to proceed with that pebble as if it weresomething far beyond a mere rock.In this case, that pebble has soaked in you for a long time and now it is you.As such, you cannot leave it lying around, but must bury it. If you would havepersonal power, however, not-doing would be to change that pebble into a powerobject.\"\"Can I do that now?\"\"Your life is not tight enough to do that. If you would see, you would know thatyour heavy concern has changed that pebble into something quite unappealing.Therefore the best thing you can do is to dig a hole and bury it, and let theearth absorb its heaviness.\"\"Is all this true, don Juan?\"\"To say yes or no to your question is doing. But since you are learningnot-doing I have to tell you that it really doesn't matter whether or not allthis is true. It is here that a warrior has a point of advantage over theaverage man.An average man cares that things are either true or false, but a warriordoesn't. An average man proceeds in a specific way with things that he knows aretrue, and in a different way with things that he knows are not true. If thingsare said to be true, he acts and believes in what he does. But if things aresaid to be untrue, he doesn't care to act, or he doesn't believe in what hedoes.A warrior, on the other hand, acts in both instances. If things are said to betrue, he would act in order to do doing. If things are said to be untrue, hestill would act in order to do not-doing. See what I mean?\"\"No, I don't see what you mean at all,\" I said.Don Juan's statements put me in a belligerent mood. I could not make sense ofwhat he was saying. I told him it was gibberish. He mocked me, and said that Idid not even have an impeccable spirit in what I liked to do the most; talking.He actually made fun of my verbal command and found it faulty and inadequate.\"If you are going to be all mouth, be a mouth warrior,\" he said, and roared withlaughter.I felt dejected. My ears were buzzing. I experienced an uncomfortable heat in myhead. I was actually embarrassed and presumably red in the face.I stood up and went into the chaparral and buried the pebble.\"I was teasing you a little bit,\" don Juan said when I returned and sat downagain. \"And yet I know that if you don't talk you don't understand. Talking isdoing for you, but talking is not always appropriate. If you want to know what Imean by not-doing, you have to do a simple exercise. Since we are concerned withnot-doing it doesn't matter whether you do the exercise now or ten years fromnow.\"He made me lie down, and took my right arm and bent it at my elbow. Then heturned my hand until the palm was facing the front. He curved my fingers so myhand looked as if I were holding a door knob, and then he began to move my armback and forth with a circular motion that resembled the act of pushing andpulling a lever attached to a wheel.Don Juan said that a warrior executed that movement every time he wanted to pushsomething out of his body; something like a disease or an unwelcome feeling. Theidea was to push and pull an imaginary opposing force until one felt a heavyobject; a solid body stopping the free movements of the hand. In the case of theexercise, not-doing consisted in repeating it until one felt the heavy body withthe hand in spite of the fact that one could never believe it was possible tofeel it.I began moving my arm and in a short while my hand became ice cold. I had begunto feel a sort of mushiness around my hand. It was as if I were paddling throughsome heavy viscous liquid matter.Don Juan made a sudden movement and grabbed my arm to stop the motion. My wholebody shivered as though stirred by some unseen force. He scrutinized me as I satup, and then he walked around me before he sat back down on the place where hehad been.\"You've done enough,\" he said. \"You may do this exercise some other time, whenyou have more personal power.\"\"Did I do something wrong?\"\"No. Not-doing is only for very strong warriors, and you don't have the power todeal with it yet. Now you will only trap horrendous things with your hand. So doit little by little, until your hand doesn't get cold any more. Whenever yourhand remains warm you can actually feel the lines of the world with it.\"He paused as if to give me time to ask about the lines. But before I had achance to, he started explaining that there were infinite numbers of lines thatjoined us to things. He said that the exercise of not-doing that he had justdescribed would help anyone to feel a line that came out from the moving hand, aline that one could place or cast wherever one wanted to. Don Juan said thatthis was only an exercise, because the lines formed by the hand were not durableenough to be of real value in a practical situation.\"A man of knowledge uses other parts of his body to produce durable lines,\" hesaid.\"What parts of the body, don Juan?\"\"The most durable lines that a man of knowledge produces come from the middle ofthe body,\" he said. \"But he can also make them with his eyes.\"\"Are they real lines?\"\"Surely.\"\"Can you see them and touch them?\"\"Let's say that you can feel them. The most difficult part about the warrior'sway is to realize that the world is a feeling. When one is not-doing, one isfeeling the world, and one feels the world through its lines.\"He paused and examined me with curiosity. He raised his brows and opened hiseyes and then blinked. The effect was like the eyes of a bird blinking. Almostimmediately I felt a sensation of discomfort and queasiness. It was actually asif something was applying pressure to my stomach.\"See what I mean?\" don Juan asked and moved his eyes away.I mentioned that I felt nauseated and he replied in a matter-of-fact tone thathe knew it, and that he was trying to make me feel the lines of the world withhis eyes.I could not accept the claim that he himself was making me feel that way. Ivoiced my doubts. I could hardly conceive the idea that he was causing myfeeling of nausea since he had not in any physical way impinged on me.\"Not-doing is very simple but very difficult,\" he said. \"It is not a matter ofunderstanding it, but rather of mastering it. Seeing, of course, is the finalaccomplishment of a man of knowledge, and seeing is attained only when one has'stopped the world' through the technique of not-doing.\"I smiled involuntarily. I had not understood what he meant.\"When one does something with people,\" he said, \"the concern should be only withpresenting the case to their bodies. That's what I've been doing with you sofar; letting your body know. Who cares whether or not you understand?\"\"But that's unfair, don Juan. I want to understand everything. Otherwise, cominghere would be a waste of my time.\"\"A waste of your time!\" he exclaimed parodying my tone of voice. \"You certainlyare conceited.\"He stood up and told me that we were going to hike to the top of the lava peakto our right.The ascent to the top was an excruciating affair. It was actual mountainclimbing except that there were no ropes to aid and protect us. Don Juanrepeatedly told me not to look down. He actually had to pull me up bodily acouple of times after I had begun to slide down the rock. I felt terriblyembarrassed that don Juan, being so old, had to help me.I told him that I was in poor physical condition because I was too lazy to doany exercise. He replied that once one had arrived at a certain level ofpersonal power, exercise or any training of that sort was unnecessary since allone needed to be in an impeccable form was to engage oneself in not-doing. When we arrived at the top, I lay down. I was about to be sick. He rolled meback and forth with his foot as he had done once before. Little by little themotion restored my balance. But I felt nervous. It was as if I were somehowwaiting for the sudden appearance of something. I involuntarily looked two orthree times to each side. Don Juan did not say a word, but he also looked in thedirection I was looking.\"Shadows are peculiar affairs,\" he said all of a sudden. \"You must have noticedthat there is one following us.\"\"I haven't noticed anything of the sort,\" I protested in a loud voice.Don Juan said that my body had noticed our pursuer in spite of my stubbornopposition, and he assured me in a confident tone that there was nothing unusualabout being followed by a shadow.\"It is just a power,\" he said. \"These mountains are filled with them. It is justlike one of those entities that scared you the other night.\"I wanted to know if I could actually perceive it myself. He asserted that in thedaytime I could only feel its presence.I wanted an explanation of why he called it a shadow when obviously it was notlike the shadow of a boulder. He replied that both had the same lines, thereforeboth were shadows. He pointed to a long boulder standing directly in front of us.\"Look at the shadow of that boulder,\" he said. \"The shadow is the boulder, andyet it isn't. To observe the boulder in order to know what the boulder is, isdoing, but to observe its shadow is not-doing.\"Shadows are like doors; the doors of not-doing. A man of knowledge, forexample, can tell the innermost feelings of men by watching their shadows.\"\"Is there movement in them?\" I asked.\"You may say that there is movement in them, or you may say that the lines ofthe world are shown in them, or you may say that feelings come from them.\"\"But how could feelings come out of shadows, don Juan?\"\"To believe that shadows are just shadows is doing,\" he explained. \"That beliefis somehow stupid. Think about it this way: There is so much more to everythingin the world that obviously there must be more to shadows too. After all, whatmakes them shadows is merely our doing.\"There was a long silence. I did not know what else to say.\"The end of the day is approaching,\" don Juan said, looking at the sky. \"Youhave to use this brilliant sunlight to perform one last exercise.\"He led me to a place where there were two peaks the size of a man standingparallel to each other about four or five feet apart. Don Juan stopped ten yardsaway from them, facing the west. He marked a spot for me to stand on and told meto look at the shadows of the peaks. He said that I should watch them, and crossmy eyes in the same manner I ordinarily crossed them when scanning the groundfor a place to rest.He clarified his directions by saying that when searching for a resting placeone had to look without focusing, but in observing shadows one had to cross theeyes and yet keep a sharp image in focus. The idea was to let one shadow besuperimposed on the other by crossing the eyes. He explained that through thatprocess one could ascertain a certain feeling which emanated from shadows. Icommented on his vagueness, but he maintained that there was really no way ofdescribing what he meant.My attempt to carry out the exercise was futile. I struggled until I got aheadache. Don Juan was not at all concerned with my failure. He climbed to adomelike peak and yelled from the top, telling me to look for two small long andnarrow pieces of rock. He showed with his hands the size rock he wanted.I found two pieces and handed them to him. Don Juan placed each rock about afoot apart in two crevices. Then he made me stand above them facing the west,and told me to do the same exercise with their shadows.This time it was an altogether different affair. Almost immediately I wascapable of crossing my eyes and perceiving their individual shadows as if theyhad merged into one. I noticed that the act of looking without converging theimages gave the single shadow I had formed an unbelievable depth and a sort oftransparency. I stared at it bewildered. Every hole in the rock on the areawhere my eyes were focused was neatly discernible. The composite shadow whichwas superimposed on them was like a film of indescribable transparency.I did not want to blink for fear of losing the image I was so precariouslyholding. Finally, my sore eyes forced me to blink, but I did not lose the viewof the detail at all. In fact, by re-moistening my cornea the image became evenclearer. I noticed at that point that it was as if I were looking from animmeasurable height at a world I had never seen before. I also noticed that Icould scan the surroundings of the shadow without losing the focus of my visualperception.Then, for an instant, I lost the notion that I was looking at a rock. I feltthat I was landing in a world, vast beyond anything I had ever conceived. Thisextraordinary perception lasted for a second and then everything was turned off.I automatically looked up and saw don Juan standing directly above the rocks,facing me. He had blocked the sunlight with his body.I described the unusual sensation I had had, and he explained that he had beenforced to interrupt it because he saw that I was about to get lost in it. Headded that it was a natural tendency for all of us to indulge ourselves whenfeelings of that nature occur; and that by indulging myself in it I had almostturned not-doing into my old familiar doing. He said that what I should havedone was to maintain the view without succumbing [*succumb- consent reluctantly]to it because in a way that doing was a manner of succumbing.I complained that he should have told me beforehand what to expect and what todo, but he pointed out that he had no way of knowing whether or not I wouldsucceed in merging the shadows.I had to confess I was more mystified than ever about not-doing. Don Juan'scomments were that I should be satisfied with what I had done because for once Ihad proceeded correctly; that by reducing the world I had enlarged it; and that,although I had been far from feeling the lines of the world, I had correctlyused the shadow of the rocks as a door into not-doing.The statement that I had enlarged the world by reducing it intrigued me no end.The detail of the porous rock in the small area where my eyes were focused wasso vivid and so precisely defined, that the top of the round peak became a vastworld for me; and yet it was really a reduced vision of the rock. When don Juanblocked the light and I found myself looking as I normally would do, the precisedetail became dull. The tiny holes in the porous rock became bigger, the browncolour of the dried lava became opaque, and everything lost the shinytransparency that made the rock into a real world.Don Juan then took the two rocks, laid them gently into a deep crevice, and satdown cross-legged facing the west on the spot where the rocks had been. Hepatted a spot next to him to his left and told me to sit down.We did not speak for a long time. Then we ate, also in silence. It was only after the sun had set that he suddenly turned and asked me about myprogress in dreaming.I told him that it had been easy in the beginning, but that at the moment I hadceased altogether to find my hands in my dreams.\"When you first started dreaming you were using my personal power. That's why itwas easier,\" he said. \"Now you are empty. But you must keep on trying until youhave enough power of your own. You see, dreaming is the not-doing of dreams, andas you progress in your not-doing, you will also progress in dreaming.The trick is not to stop looking for your hands even if you don't believe thatwhat you are doing has any meaning. In fact, as I have told you before, awarrior doesn't need to believe, because as long as he keeps on acting withoutbelieving he is not-doing.\"We looked at each other for a moment. \"There is nothing else I can tell youabout dreaming,\" he continued. \"Everything I may say would only be not-doing.But if you tackle not-doing directly, you yourself would know what to do indreaming. To find your hands is essential, though, at this time, and I am sureyou will.\"\"I don't know, don Juan. I don't trust myself.\"\"This is not a matter of trusting anybody. This whole affair is a matter of awarrior's struggle; and you will keep on struggling, if not under your ownpower, then perhaps under the impact of a worthy opponent; or with the help ofsome allies, like the one which is already following you.\"I made a jerky involuntary movement with my right arm. Don Juan said that mybody knew much more than I suspected, because the force that had been pursuingus was to my right. He confided in a low tone of voice that twice that day theally had come so close to me that he had had to step in and stop it.\"During the day shadows are the doors of not-doing,\" he said. \"But at night,since very little doing prevails in the dark, everything is a shadow includingthe allies. I've already told you about this when I taught you the gait ofpower.\"I laughed out loud and my own laughter scared me.\"Everything I have taught you so far has been an aspect of not-doing,\" he wenton. \"A warrior applies not-doing to everything in the world, and yet I can'ttell you more about it than what I have said today. You must let your own bodydiscover the power and the feeling of not-doing.\"I had another fit of nervous cackling.\"It is stupid for you to scorn the mysteries of the world simply because youknow the doing of scorn,\" he said with a serious face.I assured him that I was not scorning anything or anyone, but that I was morenervous and incompetent than he thought.\"I've always been that way,\" I said. \"And yet I want to change, but I don't knowhow. I am so inadequate.\"\"I already know that you think you are rotten,\" he said. \"That's your doing. Nowin order to affect that doing I am going to recommend that you learn anotherdoing. From now on, and for a period of eight days, I want you to lie toyourself.Instead of telling yourself the truth, that you are ugly and rotten andinadequate, you will tell yourself that you are the complete opposite, knowingthat you are lying and that you are absolutely beyond hope.\"\"But what would be the point of lying like that, don Juan?\"\"It may hook you to another doing, and then you may realize that both doings arelies, unreal, and that to hinge yourself to either one is a waste of timebecause the only thing that is real is the being in you that is going to die. Toarrive at that being is the not-doing of the self.\" ================================================================= "},{"pageContent":"16. The Ring of Power Saturday, 14 April 1962 Don Juan felt the weight of our gourds and concluded that we had exhausted ourfood supply and that it was time to return home.I casually mentioned that it was going to take us at least a couple of days toget to his house.He said he was not going back to Sonora but to a border town where he had somebusiness to take care of.I thought we were going to start our descent through a water canyon, but donJuan headed towards the northwest on the high plateau of the lava mountains.After about an hour of walking he led me into a deep ravine which ended at apoint where two peaks almost joined. There was a slope there going almost to thetop of the range; a strange slope which looked like a slanted concave bridgebetween the two peaks.Don Juan pointed to an area on the face of the slope.\"Look there fixedly,\" he said. \"The sun is almost right.\"He explained that at midday the light of the sun could help me with not-doing.He then gave me a series of commands: to loosen all the tight garments I had on,to sit in a cross-legged position, and to look intently at the spot he hadspecified.There were very few clouds in the sky and none towards the west. It was a hotday and the sunlight beamed on the solidified lava. I kept a very close watchover the area in question.After a long vigil I asked what, specifically, I was supposed to look for.He made me be quiet with an impatient gesture of his hand.I was tired. I wanted to go to sleep. I half closed my eyes. They were itchingand I rubbed them, but my hands were clammy and the sweat made my eyes sting. Ilooked at the lava peaks through half-closed eyelids and suddenly the wholemountain was lit up.I told don Juan that if I squinted my eyes I could see the whole range ofmountains as an intricate array of light fibres.He told me to breathe as little as possible in order to maintain the view of thelight fibres, and not to stare intently into it, but to look casually at a pointon the horizon right above the slope.I followed his instructions and was able to hold the view of an interminableextension covered with a web of light.Don Juan said in a very soft voice that I should try to isolate areas ofdarkness within the field of light fibres; and after I found a dark spot, Ishould open my eyes and check where that spot was on the face of the slope.I was incapable of perceiving any dark areas. I squinted my eyes and then openedthem up various times.Don Juan drew closer to me and pointed to an area to my right, and then toanother one right in front of me.I tried to change the position of my body. I thought that perhaps if I shiftedmy perspective I would be able to perceive the supposed area of darkness he waspointing to;But don Juan shook my arm and told me in a severe tone to keep still and bepatient.I again squinted my eyes and once more saw the web of light fibres. I looked atit for a moment and then I opened my eyes wider.At that instant I heard a faint rumble: It could have easily have been explainedas the distant sound of a jet plane;And then, with my eyes wide open, I saw the whole range of mountains in front ofme as an enormous field of tiny dots of light.It was as if for a brief moment some metallic specks in the solidified lava werereflecting the sunlight in unison.Then the sunlight grew dim and was suddenly turned off, and the mountains becamea mass of dull dark brown rock. At the same time it also became windy and cold.I wanted to turn around to see if the sun had disappeared behind a cloud, butdon Juan held my head and did not let me move. HTML EDITOR:Whenever Juan holds Carlos's head, I wonder if Nestor is behind them,witnessing.END HTML EDITOR He said that if I turned I might catch a glimpse of an entity of the mountains;the ally that was following us.He assured me that I did not have the necessary strength to stand a sight ofthat nature:And then he added in a calculated tone, that the rumble I had heard was thepeculiar way in which an ally heralded its presence.He then stood up, and announced that we were going to start climbing up the sideof the slope.\"Where are we going?\" I asked.He pointed to one of the areas he had isolated as being a spot of darkness. Heexplained that 'not-doing' had allowed him to single out that spot as a possiblecentre of power, or perhaps as a place where power objects might be found.We reached the spot he had in mind after a painful climb. He stood motionlessfor a moment a few feet in front of me.I tried to come closer to him but he signalled me with his hand to stop.He seemed to be orienting himself. I could see the back of his head moving as ifhe were sweeping his eyes up and down the mountain, then with sure steps he ledthe way to a ledge.He sat down and began to wipe some loose dirt off the ledge with his hand. Hedug with his fingers around a small piece of rock that was sticking out,cleaning the dirt around it. Then he ordered me to dig it out.Once I had dislodged the piece of rock, he told me to immediately put it insidemy shirt because it was a power object that belonged to me. He said that he wasgiving it to me to keep, and that I should polish and care for it. Right after that we began our descent into a water canyon; and a couple of hourslater we were in the high desert at the foot of the lava mountains. Don Juanwalked about ten feet ahead of me and kept up a very good pace. We went southuntil just before sunset. A heavy bank of clouds in the west prevented us fromseeing the sun, but we paused until it had presumably disappeared over thehorizon.Don Juan changed directions then, and headed towards the southeast. We went overa hill;And as we got to the top of the hill, I spotted four men coming towards us fromthe south.I looked at don Juan. We had never encountered people in our excursions, and Idid not know what to do in a case like that.But don Juan did not seem to be concerned. He kept on walking as if nothing hadhappened.The men moved as if they were not in a hurry. They meandered towards where wewere in a leisurely way.When they were closer to us, I noticed that they were four young Indians.They seemed to recognize don Juan. He talked to them in Spanish. They were verysoft-spoken and treated him with great deference.Only one of them spoke to me.I asked don Juan in a whisper if I could also talk to them, and he nodded hishead affirmatively.Once I engaged them in conversation, they were very friendly and communicative;especially the one who had first spoken to me.They told me they were there in search of power quartz crystals. They said thatthey had been wandering around the lava mountains for several days, but they hadnot had any luck. Don Juan looked around and pointed to a rocky area about two hundred yards away.\"That's a good place to camp for a while,\" he said.He began to walk towards the rocks, and we all followed him.The area he had selected was very rugged. There were no bushes on it.We sat down on the rocks.Don Juan announced that he was going to go back into the chaparral to gather drybranches for a fire. I wanted to help him, but he whispered to me that this wasa special fire for those brave young men and he did not need my help.The young men sat down around me in a close cluster. One of them sat with hisback against mine. I felt a bit embarrassed.When don Juan returned with a pile of sticks, he commended them for theircarefulness. He told me that the young men were a sorcerer's apprentices; andthat it was the rule to make a circle and have two people back to back in thecentre when going on hunting parties for power objects.One of the young men asked me if I had ever found any crystals myself.I told him that don Juan had never taken me to look for them.Don Juan selected a place close to a big boulder, and started to make a fire.None of the young men moved to help him, but they watched him attentively. Whenall the sticks were burning, don Juan sat with his back against the boulder. Thefire was to his right.The young men apparently knew what was going on;But I did not have the faintest idea about the procedure to follow when one wasdealing with sorcerer's apprentices.I watched the young men. They sat facing don Juan, making a perfect half circle.I noticed then that don Juan was directly facing me; and two of the young menhad sat to my left, and the other two to my right.Don Juan began telling them that I was in the lava mountains to learn not-doingand that an ally had been following us.I thought that that was a very dramatic beginning and I was right.The young men changed positions and sat with their left legs tucked under theirseats. I had not observed how they were sitting before. I had assumed that theywere sitting the same way I was, cross-legged. A casual glance at don Juanrevealed to me that he was also sitting with his left leg tucked in.He made a barely perceptible gesture with his chin to point at my sittingposition. I casually tucked in my left leg.Don Juan had once told me that a sorcerer used that posture when things wereuncertain. However, it had always proved to be a very tiring position for me. Ifelt it was going to be a terrible imposition on me to remain seated in thatfashion for the duration of his talk.Don Juan seemed to be thoroughly aware of my handicap, so he explained in asuccinct manner to the young men that quartz crystals could be found in certainspecific spots in that area;And when they were found, they had to be coaxed to leave their abode by means ofspecial techniques.The crystals then became the man himself, and their power went beyond ourunderstanding.He said that ordinarily quartz crystals were found in clusters, and that it wasup to the man who had found them to choose five of the longest and best-lookingblades of quartz, and sever them from their matrix. The finder was responsiblefor carving and polishing them in order to make them pointed; and to make themfit perfectly to the size and shape of the fingers of his right hand.Then he told us that the quartz crystals were weapons used for sorcery; thatthey were usually hurled to kill, and that they penetrated the enemy's body; andthen returned to their owner's hand as though they had never left it.Next he talked about the search for the spirit that would turn the ordinarycrystals into weapons; and said that the first thing one had to do was to find apropitious [* propitious- presenting favourable circumstances] place to lure outthe spirit. That place had to be on a hilltop; and the place on the hilltopwasfound by sweeping the hand with the palm turned towards the earth until acertain heat was detected with the palm of the hand.A fire had to be made on that spot. Don Juan explained that the ally wasattracted by the flames, and manifested [* manifested- reveal its presence ormake an appearance] itself through a series of consistent noises.The person searching for an ally had to follow the direction of the noises untilthe ally revealed itself; and then the person had to wrestle it to the ground inorder to overpower it. It was at that point that one could make the ally touchthe crystals to imbue them with power.He warned us that there are other forces at large in those lava mountains;forces which do not resemble the allies. These forces do not make any noise, andappear only as fleeting shadows. They do not have any power beneficial to theperson at all. HTML EDITOR:The flyers; the predators. See Carlos' book, \"The Active Side of Infinity\"-Chapter: Mud Shadows[http://www.rarecloud.com/cc_html/cc_html_12/tasoi18.html].Note: This link will open in a new windowEND HTML EDITOR Don Juan said that a brilliantly coloured feather or some highly polished quartzcrystals would attract the attention of an ally; however, in the long run, anyobject whatever would be equally effective because the important part was not tofind the objects, but to find the force that would imbue them with power.He said, \"What's the use of having beautifully polished crystals if you neverfind the spirit giver of power?\"On the other hand, if you don't have the crystals, but do find the spirit; youmay put anything in his way to be touched. You could put your dicks in the wayif you can't find anything else.\"The young men giggled. The most daring of them, the one who talked to me first,laughed loudly.I noticed that don Juan had crossed his legs, and was sitting in a relaxedmanner. All the young men had also crossed their legs.I tried to slip casually into a more relaxed posture, but my left knee seemed tohave a pinched nerve or a sore muscle and I had to stand up and jog on the spotfor a few minutes.Don Juan made a joking comment. He said I was out of practice kneeling downbecause I had not been to confession in years; ever since I had begun runningaround with him.That produced a great commotion among the young men. They laughed in spurts.Some of them covered their faces and giggled nervously.\"I'm going to show you fellows something,\" don Juan said casually after theyoung men had stopped laughing.My incorrent guess was that he was going to let us see some power objects he hadin his pouch.For an instant I thought the young men were going to cluster around him becausethey made a sudden movement in unison. All of them bent forward a little bit, asif they were going to stand up;But then they all tucked their left legs in and went back to that mysteriousposition that was so hard on my knees.I tucked my left leg in as casually as possible. I found that if I did not siton my left foot, that is, if I kept a half-kneeling position, my knees did nothurt as much.Don Juan stood up and walked around the big boulder until he was out of sight.He must have fed the fire before he stood up while I was tucking in my legbecause new sticks chirped as they ignited, and long flames spurted out. Theeffect was extremely dramatic. The flames grew twice as big.Don Juan suddenly stepped out from behind the boulder and stood where he hadbeen sitting.I had a moment of bewilderment. Don Juan had put on a funny black hat. It hadpeaks on the side, by the ears, and it was round on top. It occurred to me thatit was actually a pirate's hat. He was wearing a long black coat with tails,fastened with a single shiny metallic button, and he had a peg leg.I laughed to myself. Don Juan really looked silly in his pirate's costume. Ibegan to wonder where he had gotten that outfit out there in the wilderness. Iassumed that it must have been hidden behind the rock. I commented to myselfthat all don Juan needed was a patch over his eye and a parrot on his shoulderto be the perfect stereotype of a pirate.Don Juan looked at every member of the group, sweeping his eyes slowly fromright to left. Then he looked up above us, and stared into the darkness behindus. He remained in that position for a moment, and then he went around theboulder and disappeared.I did not notice how he walked. Obviously he must have had his knee bent inorder to depict a man with a wooden leg. When he turned around to walk behindthe boulder, I should have seen his bent leg, but I was so mystified by his actsthat I did not pay any attention to details.The flames lost their strength at the very moment don Juan went around theboulder.I thought that his timing had been superb. He must have calculated how long itwould take for the sticks he had added to the fire to burn and had arranged hisappearance and exit according to that calculation.The change in the intensity of the fire was very dramatic.There was a ripple of nervousness among the young men.As the flames diminished in size, the young men went back in unison to across-legged sitting position.I expected don Juan to step out from behind the boulder right away and sit downagain, but he did not. He remained out of sight. I waited impatiently. The youngmen were sitting with an impassive look on their faces.I could not understand what don Juan had intended with all those histrionics.After a long wait I turned to the young man on my right and asked him in a lowvoice if any of the items don Juan had put on- the funny hat and the long tailcoat- and the fact he was standing on a peg leg had any meaning to him.The young man looked at me with a funny blank expression. He seemed confused.I repeated my question and the other young man next to him looked at meattentively in order to listen.They looked at each other seemingly in utter confusion.I said that to me the hat and the stump and the coat made him into a pirate.By then all four young men had come closer together around me. They giggledsoftly and fretted nervously. They seemed to be at a loss for words. The mostdaring of them finally spoke to me.He said that don Juan did not have a hat on, was not wearing a long coat, andwas certainly not standing on a stump, but that he had a black cowl or shawlover his head and a jet black tunic, like a friar's, that went all the way tothe ground.\"No!\" another young man exclaimed softly. \"He didn't have a cowl.\"\"That's right,\" the others said.The young man who had spoken first looked at me with an expression of totaldisbelief.I told them that we had to review what had happened very carefully and veryquietly. I said I was sure don Juan had wanted us to do so, and thus he had leftus alone.The young man who was to my extreme right said that don Juan was in rags. He hadon a tattered poncho, or some sort of Indian coat, and a most beat-up sombrero.He was holding a basket with things in it, but he was not sure what those thingswere. He added that don Juan was not really dressed as a beggar, but rather as aman who was coming back from an interminable journey loaded with strange things.The young man who had seen don Juan with a black cowl said that he had nothingin his hands, but that his hair was long and wild as if he were a wild man thathad just killed a friar; and had put on the friar's clothes, but could not hidehis wildness.The young man to my left chuckled softly and commented on the weirdness of itall. He said that he saw don Juan dressed as an important man who had justgotten off his horse. He had leather leggings for horseback riding, big spurs, awhip that he kept beating on his left palm, a Chihuahua hat with a conicalcrown, and two .45-calibre automatic pistols. He said that don Juan was thepicture of a well-to-do 'ranchero'.The young man to my extreme left laughed shyly and did not volunteer to revealwhat he had seen. I coaxed him, but the others did not seem to be interested. Heappeared to be rather too shy to talk.The fire was about to die out when don Juan came out from behind the boulder.\"We better leave the young men to their doings,\" he said to me. \"Bid themgood-bye.\"He did not look at them. He began to walk away slowly to give me time to saygood-bye.The young men embraced me.There were no flames in the fire, but the live coals reflected enough glare.Don Juan was like a dark shadow a few feet away, and the young men were a circleof neatly defined static silhouettes. They were like a row of jet black statuesset in a background of darkness.It was at that point that the total event had an impact on me. A chill ran up myspine. I caught up with don Juan. He told me in a tone of great urgency not toturn around to look at the young men, because at that moment they were a circleof shadows.My stomach felt a force coming from the outside. It was as if a hand had grabbedme. I screamed involuntarily. Don Juan whispered that there was so much power inthat area that it would be very easy for me to use the 'gait of power'.We jogged for hours. I fell down five times. Don Juan counted out loud everytime I lost my balance.Then he came to a halt.\"Sit down. Huddle against the rocks, and cover your belly with your hands,\" hewhispered in my ear. Sunday, 1962 April 15 As soon as there was enough light in the morning we started walking. Don Juanguided me to the place where I had left my car. I was hungry but I felt,otherwise, invigorated and well rested.We ate some crackers and drank some bottled mineral water I had in my car.I wanted to ask him some questions that were overwhelming me, but he put hisfinger to his lips.By mid-afternoon we were in the border town where he wanted me to leave him. Wewent to a restaurant to eat lunch. The place was empty. We sat at a table by awindow looking out at the busy main street and ordered our food.Don Juan seemed relaxed. His eyes shone with a mischievous glint. I feltencouraged, and began a barrage of questions. I mainly wanted to know about hisdisguise.\"I showed you a little bit of my not-doing,\" he said and his eyes seemed toglow.\"But none of us saw the same disguise,\" I said. \"How did you do that?\"\"It's all very simple,\" he replied. \"They were only disguises, becauseeverything we do is in some way merely a disguise. Everything we do, as I havetold you, is a matter of doing. A man of knowledge could hook himself toeveryone's doing and come up with weird things.\"But they are not weird, not really. They are weird only to those who aretrapped in doing.\"Those four young men and yourself are not aware yet of not-doing, so it waseasy to fool all of you.\"\"But how did you fool us?\"\"It won't make sense to you. There is no way for you to understand it.\"\"Try me, don Juan, please.\"\"Let's say that when every one of us is born we bring with us a little ring ofpower. That little ring is almost immediately put to use. So every one of us isalready hooked from birth and our rings of power are joined to everyone else's.In other words, our rings of power are hooked to the doing of the world in orderto make the world.\"\"Give me an example so I could understand it,\" I said.\"For instance, our rings of power, yours and mine, are hooked right now to thedoing in this room. We are making this room. Our rings of power are spinningthis room into being at this very moment.\"\"Wait, wait,\" I said. \"This room is here by itself. I am not creating it. I havenothing to do with it.\"Don Juan did not seem to be concerned with my argumentative protests. He verycalmly maintained that the room we were in was brought to being and was kept inplace because of the force of everybody's ring of power.\"You see,\" he continued, \"every one of us knows the doing of rooms because, inone way or another, we have spent much of our lives in rooms.\"A man of knowledge, on the other hand, develops another ring of power. I wouldcall it the ring of not-doing because it is hooked to not-doing. With that ring,therefore, he can spin another world.\"A young waitress brought our food and seemed to be suspicious of us. Don Juanwhispered that I should pay her to show her that I had enough money.\"I don't blame her for distrusting you,\" he said and roared with laughter. \"Youlook like hell.\"I paid the woman and tipped her, and when she left us alone I stared at don Juantrying to find a way to recapture the thread of our conversation. He came to myrescue.\"Your difficulty is that you haven't yet developed your extra ring of power.Your body doesn't know not-doing,\" he said.I did not understand what he had said. My mind was locked in quite a prosaicconcern. All I wanted to know was whether or not he had put on a pirate'soutfit.Don Juan did not answer but laughed uproariously. I begged him to explain.\"But I've just explained it to you,\" he retorted.\"You mean, that you didn't put on any disguise?\" I asked.\"All I did was to hook my ring of power to your own doing,\" he said. \"Youyourself did the rest as did the others.\"\"That's incredible!\" I exclaimed.\"We all have been taught to agree about doing,\" he said softly. \"You don't haveany idea of the power that that agreement brings with it.\"But, fortunately, not-doing is equally miraculous and powerful.\"I felt an uncontrollable ripple in my stomach. There was an unbridgeable abyssbetween my first-hand experience and his explanation. As an ultimate defence Iended up, as I had always done, with a tinge of doubt and distrust and with thequestion: What if don Juan was really in cahoots with the young men and hehimself had set it all up?I changed the subject and asked him about the four apprentices.\"Did you tell me that they were shadows?\" I asked.\"That's right.\"\"Were they allies?\"\"No. They were apprentices of a man I know.\"\"Why did you call them shadows?\"\"Because at that moment they had been touched by the power of not-doing, andsince they are not as green as you are, they shifted into something quitedifferent from what you know. I didn't want you to look at them for that reason.It would have only injured you.\"I did not have any more questions. I was not hungry either.Don Juan ate heartily and seemed to be in an excellent mood.But I felt dejected. Suddenly a consuming fatigue possessed me. I realized thatdon Juan's path was too arduous for me. I commented that I did not have thequalifications to become a sorcerer.\"Perhaps another meeting with Mescalito will help you,\" he said.I assured him that that was the farthest thing from my mind, and that I wouldnot even consider the possibility.\"Very drastic things have to happen to you in order for you to allow your bodyto profit from all you have learned,\" he said.I ventured the opinion that since I was not an Indian I was not really qualifiedto live the unusual life of a sorcerer.\"Perhaps,\" I said, \" if I could disentangle myself from all my commitments, Icould fare in your world a little better; or if I would go into the wildernesswith you and live there. As it is now, the fact I have a foot in both worldsmakes me useless in either.\"He stared at me for a long moment.\"This is your world,\" he said, pointing to the busy street outside the window.\"You are a man of that world. And out there, in that world, is your huntingground.\"There is no way to escape the doing of our world, so what a warrior does is toturn his world into his hunting ground.\"As a hunter, a warrior knows that the world is made to be used; so he usesevery bit of it. A warrior is like a pirate that has no qualms in taking andusing anything he wants; except that the warrior doesn't mind, or he doesn'tfeel insulted, when he is used and taken himself.\"================================================================="},{"pageContent":"17. A Worthy Opponent Tuesday, 1962 December 11 My traps were perfect. The setting was correct. I saw rabbits, squirrels andother rodents, quail, and birds; but I could not catch anything at all duringthe whole day.Don Juan had told me as we left his house in the early morning that I had towait that day for a 'gift of power'; an exceptional animal that might be luredinto my traps, and whose flesh I could dry for 'power food'.Don Juan seemed to be in a pensive mood. He did not make a single suggestion orcomment. Near the end of the day he finally made a statement.\"Someone is interfering with your hunting,\" he said.\"Who?\" I asked, truly surprised.He looked at me, smiled, and shook his head in a gesture of disbelief.\"You act as if you didn't know who,\" he said. \"And you've known who all day.\"I was going to protest, but I saw no point in it. I knew he was going to say 'laCatalina'; and if that was the kind of knowledge he was talking about, then hewas right: I did know who.\"We either go home now,\" he continued, \"or we wait until dark and use thetwilight to catch her.\"He appeared to be waiting for my decision.I wanted to leave so I began to gather some thin rope that I was using; butbefore I could voice my wish to leave, he stopped me with a direct command.\"Sit down,\" he said. \"It would be a simpler and more sober decision just toleave now, but this is a peculiar case and I think we must stay. This show isjust for you.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"Someone is interfering with you in particular, so that makes it your show. Iknow who and you also know who.\"\"You scare me,\" I said.\"Not me,\" he replied, laughing. \"That woman who is out there prowling is scaringyou.\"He paused as if he were waiting for the effect of his words to show on me. I hadto admit that I was terrified. Over a month before, I had a horrendous confrontation with a sorceress called'la Catalina'.I faced her, I had thought, at the risk of my life because don Juan hadconvinced me that she was after his life; and that he was incapable of fendingoff her onslaughts.After I came in contact with her, don Juan disclosed to me that she had neverreally been of any danger to him; and that the whole affair had been a trick;not in the sense of a malicious prank, but in the sense of a trap to ensnare me.His method was so unethical to me that I became furious with him.Upon hearing my angry outburst don Juan had begun to sing some Mexican tunes. Heimitated popular crooners and his renditions were so comical that I had ended uplaughing like a child. He entertained me for hours. I never knew he had such arepertoire of idiotic songs.\"Let me tell you something,\" he finally said. \"If you were not tricked, youwould never learn. The same thing happened to me, and it'll happen to anyone.The art of a benefactor is to take us to the brink. A benefactor can only pointthe way and trick.\"I tricked you before. You remember the way I recaptured your hunter's spirit,don't you? You yourself told me that hunting made you forget about plants. Youwere willing to do a lot of things in order to be a hunter; things you wouldn'thave done in order to learn about plants. Now you must do a lot more in order tosurvive.\"He stared at me and broke into a fit of laughter.\"This is all crazy,\" I said. \"We are rational beings.\"\"You're rational,\" he retorted. \"I am not.\"\"Of course you are,\" I insisted. \"You are one of the most rational men I haveever met.\"\"All right!\" he exclaimed. \"Let us not argue. I am rational, so what?\"I involved him in the argument of why it was necessary for two rational beingsto proceed in such an insane way, as we had proceeded with the lady witch.\"You're rational, all right,\" he said fiercely. \"And that means you believe thatyou know a lot about the world, but do you? Do you really? You have only seenthe acts of people. Your experiences are limited only to what people have doneto you or to others. You know nothing about this mysterious unknown world.\"He signalled me to follow him to my car, and we drove to the small Mexican townnear by.I did not ask what we were going to do. He made me park my car by a restaurant,and then we walked around the bus depot and the general store. Don Juan walkedon my right side, leading me.Suddenly I became aware that someone else was walking side by side with me to myleft, but before I had time to turn to look, don Juan made a fast and suddenmovement. He leaned forward, as if he were picking something from the ground,and then grabbed me by the armpit when I nearly stumbled over him. He dragged meto my car and did not let go of my arm even to allow me to unlock the door. Ifumbled with the keys for a moment. He shoved me gently into the car and thengot in himself.\"Drive slowly and stop in front of the store,\" he said.When I had stopped, don Juan signalled me with a nod of his head to look. LaCatalina was standing at the place where don Juan had grabbed me. I recoiledinvoluntarily.The woman took a couple of steps towards the car, and stood there defiantly. Iscrutinized her carefully, and concluded that she was a beautiful woman. She wasvery dark and had a plump body, but she seemed to be strong and muscular. Shehad a round full face with high cheekbones and two long braids of jet blackhair. What surprised me the most was her youth. She was at the most in her earlythirties.\"Let her come closer if she wants,\" don Juan whispered.She took three or four steps towards my car, and stopped perhaps ten feet away.We looked at each other. At that moment I felt there was nothing threateningabout her. I smiled and waved at her. She giggled as if she were a shy littlegirl, and covered her mouth. Somehow I felt delighted.I turned to don Juan to comment on her appearance and behaviour, and he scaredme half to death with a yell.\"Don't turn your back to that woman, damn it!\" he said in a forceful voice.I quickly turned to look at the woman. She had taken another couple of stepstowards my car, and was standing barely five feet away from my door. She wassmiling. Her teeth were big and white and very clean.There was something eerie about her smile, however. It was not friendly. It wasa contained grin. Only her mouth smiled. Her eyes were black and cold and werestaring at me fixedly.I experienced a chill all over my body. Don Juan began to laugh in a rhythmicalcackle. After a moment's wait the woman slowly backed away and disappeared amongpeople.We drove away, and don Juan speculated that if I did not tighten up my life andlearn, she was going to step on me as one steps on a defenceless bug.\"She is the worthy opponent I told you I had found for you,\" he said. Don Juan said that we had to wait for an omen before we knew what to do with thewoman who was interfering with my hunting.\"If we see or hear a crow, we'll know for sure that we can wait, and we'll alsoknow where to wait,\" he added.He slowly turned around in a complete circle, scanning all the surroundings.\"This is not the place to wait,\" he said in a whisper.We began to walk towards the east. It was already fairly dark. Suddenly twocrows flew out from behind some tall bushes and disappeared behind a hill. DonJuan said that the hill was our destination.Once we arrived there he circled it, and chose a place facing the southeast atthe bottom of the hill. He cleaned the dry twigs and leaves and other debrisfrom a circular spot five or six feet in diameter.I attempted to help him, but he refused me with a strong movement of his hand.He put his finger over his lips and made a gesture of silence.When he had finished he pulled me to the centre of the circle, made me face thesouth away from the hill, and whispered in my ear that I had to imitate hismovements. He began a sort of dance, making a rhythmical thump with his rightfoot, It consisted of seven even beats spaced by a cluster of three fast thumps.I tried to adapt myself to his rhythm and after a few clumsy attempts I was moreor less capable of reproducing the same thumping.\"What's this for?\" I whispered in his ear.He told me, also in a whisper, that I was thumping like a rabbit and that sooneror later the prowler would be attracted by the noise and would show up to seewhat was going on.Once I had copied the rhythm, don Juan ceased to thump himself, but had mecontinue, marking the pace with a movement of his hand.From time to time he would listen attentively, with his head slightly tilted tothe right, seemingly to pick out noises in the chaparral. At one point hesignalled me to stop and he remained in a most alert position. It was as if hewere ready to spring up and jump on an unknown and unseen assailant.Then he motioned me to continue the thumping. After a while he stopped me again.Every time I stopped, he listened with such a concentration that every fibre inhis body seemed to be tense to the point of bursting.Suddenly he jumped to my side and whispered in my ear that the twilight was atits full power.I looked around. The chaparral was a dark mass, and so were the hills and therocks. The sky was dark blue and I could not see the clouds any more. The wholeworld seemed to be a uniform mass of dark silhouettes which did not have anyvisible boundaries.I heard the eerie distant cry of an animal; a coyote, or perhaps a night bird.It happened so suddenly that I did not pay attention to it. But don Juan's bodyjerked a bit. I felt its vibration as he stood next to me.\"Here we go,\" he whispered. \"Thump again and be ready. She's here.\"I began to thump furiously, but don Juan put his foot over mine, and signalledme frantically to relax, and thump rhythmically.\"Don't scare her away,\" he whispered in my ear. \"Calm down, and don't lose yourmarbles.\"He again began to mark the pace of my thumping, and after the second time hemade me stop I heard the same cry again. This time it seemed to be the cry of abird which was flying over the hill.Don Juan made me thump once more.When I stopped, I heard a peculiar rustling sound to my left. It was the sound aheavy animal would make while moving about in the dry underbrush. The thought ofa bear crossed my mind, but then I realized that there were no bears in thedesert. I grabbed on to don Juan's arm. He smiled at me, and put his finger tohis mouth in a gesture of silence.I stared into the darkness towards my left, but he signalled me not to. Herepeatedly pointed directly above me, and then he made me turn around slowly andsilently until I was facing the dark mass of the hill.Don Juan kept his finger levelled at a certain point on the hill.I kept my eyes glued to that spot and suddenly, as if in a nightmare, a darkshadow leaped at me. I shrieked, and fell down to the ground on my back. For amoment the dark silhouette was superimposed against the dark blue sky, and thenit sailed through the air and landed beyond us in the bushes. I heard the soundof a heavy body crashing into the shrubs and then an eerie outcry.Don Juan helped me up, and guided me in the darkness to the place where I hadleft my traps. He made me gather and disassemble them. Then he scattered thepieces away in all directions. He performed all this without saying a singleword. We did not speak at all on our way back to his house. \"What do you want me to say?\" don Juan asked after I had urged him repeatedly toexplain the events I had witnessed a few hours before.\"What was it?\" I asked.\"You know darn well who it was,\" he said. \"Don't water it down with 'what wasit'? It is who it was that is important.\"I had worked out an explanation that seemed to suit me. The figure I had seenlooked very much like a kite that someone had let out over the hill whilesomeone else, behind us, had pulled it to the ground, thus the effect of a darksilhouette sailing through the air perhaps fifteen or twenty yards.He listened attentively to my explanation, and then laughed until tears rolleddown his cheeks.\"Quit beating around the bush,\" he said. \"Get to the point. Wasn't it a woman?\"I had to admit that when I fell down, and looked up, I saw the dark silhouetteof a woman with a long skirt leaping over me in a very slow motion. Thensomething seemed to have pulled the dark silhouette, and it flew over me withgreat speed and crashed into the bushes. In fact, that movement was what hadgiven me the idea of a kite.Don Juan refused to discuss the incident any further.The next day he left to fulfill some mysterious errand and I went to visit someYaqui friends in another community. Wednesday, 1962 December 12 As soon as I arrived at the Yaqui community, the Mexican storekeeper told methat he had rented a record player and twenty records from an outfit in CiudadObregon for the 'fiesta' he was planning to give that night in honour of theVirgin of Guadalupe.He had already told everybody that he had made all the necessary arrangementsthrough Julio, the travelling salesman who came to the Yaqui settlement twice amonth to collect instalments on a layaway plan for cheap articles of clothingwhich he had succeeded in selling to some Yaqui Indians.Julio brought the record player early in the afternoon, and hooked it to thedynamo that provided electricity for the store. He made sure that it worked.Then he turned up the volume to its maximum, reminded the storekeeper not totouch any knobs, and began to sort the twenty records.\"I know how many scratches each of them has,\" Julio said to the storekeeper.\"Tell that to my daughter,\" the storekeeper replied.\"You're responsible, not your daughter.\"\"Just the same, she's the one who'll be changing the records.\"Julio insisted that it did not make any difference to him whether she or someoneelse was going to actually handle the record player as long as the storekeeperpaid for any records that were damaged.The storekeeper began to argue with Julio.Julio's face became red. He turned from time to time to the large group of YaquiIndians congregated in front of the store and made signs of despair orfrustration by moving his hands or contorting his face in a grimace. Seeminglyas a final resort, Julio demanded a cash deposit.That precipitated another long argument about what constituted a damaged record.Julio stated with authority that any broken record had to be paid for in full,as if it were new. The storekeeper became angrier and began to pull out hisextension cords. He seemed bent upon unhooking the record player and cancellingthe party.He made it clear to his clients congregated in front of the store that he hadtried his best to come to terms with Julio. For a moment it seemed that theparty was going to fail before it had started.Bias, the old Yaqui Indian in whose house I was staying, made some derogatorycomments in a loud voice about the Yaquis' sad state of affairs that they couldnot even celebrate their most revered religious festivity, the day of the Virginof Guadalupe.I wanted to intervene and offer my help, but Bias stopped me. He said that if Iwere to make the cash deposit, the storekeeper himself would smash the records.\"He's worse than anybody,\" he said to me. \"Let him pay the deposit. He bleedsus, so why shouldn't he pay?\"After a long discussion in which, strangely enough, everyone present was infavour of Julio, the storekeeper hit upon terms which were mutually agreeable.He did not pay a cash deposit, but accepted responsibility for the records andthe record player.Julio's motorcycle left a trail of dust as he headed for some of the more remotehouses in the locality. Bias said that Julio was trying to get to his customersbefore they came to the store and spent all their money buying booze. As he wassaying this a group of Indians emerged from behind the store. Bias looked atthem, and began to laugh; and so did everyone else there.Bias told me that those Indians were Julio's customers that had been hidingbehind the store waiting for him to leave.The party began early. The storekeeper's daughter put a record on the turntableand brought the arm down. There was a terrible loud screech and a high pitchedbuzz, and then came a blasting sound of a trumpet and some guitars.The party consisted of playing the records at full volume. There were four youngMexican men who danced with the storekeeper's two daughters and three otheryoung Mexican women. The Yaquis did not dance. They watched with apparentdelight every movement the dancers made. They seemed to be enjoying themselvesjust watching, and gulping down cheap tequila.I bought individual drinks for everybody I knew. I wanted to avoid any feelingsof resentment. I circulated among the numerous Indians, and talked to them andthen offered them drinks.My pattern of behaviour worked until they realized I was not drinking at all.That seemed to annoy everyone at once. It was as if collectively they haddiscovered that I did not belong there. The Indians became very gruff and gaveme sly looks.The Mexicans, who were as drunk as the Indians, also realized at the same timethat I had not danced, and that appeared to offend them even more. They becamevery aggressive. One of them forcibly took me by the arm and dragged me closerto the record player. Another served me a full cup of tequila and wanted me todrink it all in one gulp and prove that I was a 'macho'.I tried to stall them and laughed idiotically as if I were actually enjoying thesituation. I said that I would like to dance first and then drink.One of the young men called out the name of a song.The girl in charge of the record player began to search in the pile of records.Although none of the women had openly been drinking, the girl seemed to be alittle tipsy, and had trouble fitting a record on the turntable.A young man said that the record she had selected was not a twist.She fumbled with the pile, trying to find the suitable one, and everybody closedin around her and left me. That gave me time to run behind the store, away fromthe lighted area, and out of sight.I stood about thirty yards away in the darkness of some bushes trying to decidewhat to do. I was tired. I felt it was time to get in my car and go back home. Ibegan to walk to Bias's house where my car was parked. I figured that if I droveslowly no one would notice that I was leaving.The people in charge of the record player were apparently still looking for therecord. All I could hear was the high-pitched buzzing of the loudspeaker; butthen came the blasting sound of a twist. I laughed out loud, thinking that theyhad probably turned to where I had been, and had found out that I disappeared.I saw some dark silhouettes of people walking in the opposite direction, goingtowards the store. We passed each other and they mumbled, \"Buenas noches.\"I recognized them and spoke to them. I told them that it was a great party.Before I came to a sharp bend in the road I encountered two other people who Idid not recognize, but I greeted them anyway.The blasting sound of the record player was almost as loud there on the road asit was in front of the store. It was a dark starless night, but the glare fromthe store lights allowed me to have a fairly good visual perception of mysurroundings. Bias's house was very near, and I accelerated my pace.I noticed then the dark shape of a person, sitting or perhaps squatting to myleft, at the bend of the road.I thought for an instant that it might have been one of the people from theparty who had left before I had. The person seemed to be defecating on the sideof the road. That seemed odd. People in the community went into the thick bushesto perform their bodily functions. I thought that whoever it was in front of memust have been drunk.I came to the bend and said, \"Buenas noches.\" The person answered me with aneerie, gruff, inhuman howl. The hair on my body literally stood on end. For asecond I was paralysed.Then I began to walk fast. I took a quick glance. I saw that the dark silhouettehad stood up halfway; it was a woman. She was stooped over, leaning forward. Shewalked in that position for a few yards and then she hopped. I began to runwhile the woman hopped like a bird by my side, keeping up with my speed. By thetime I arrived at Bias's house she was cutting in front of me and we had almosttouched.I leaped across a small dry ditch in front of the house, and crashed through theflimsy door.Bias was already in the house, and seemed unconcerned with my story.\"They pulled a good one on you,\" he said reassuringly. \"The Indians take delightin teasing foreigners.\"My experience had been so unnerving that the next day I drove to don Juan'shouse instead of going home as I had planned to do.Don Juan returned in the late afternoon. I did not give him time to say anythingbut blurted out the whole story, including Bias's commentary. Don Juan's facebecame sombre. Perhaps it was only my imagination, but I thought he was worried.\"Don't put so much stock in what Bias told you,\" he said in a serious tone. \"Heknows nothing of the struggles between sorcerers.\"You should have known that it was something serious the moment you noticed thatthe shadow was to your left. You shouldn't have run either.\"\"What was I supposed to do? Stand there?\"\"Right. When a warrior encounters his opponent, and the opponent is not anordinary human being, he must make his stand. That is the only thing that makeshim invulnerable.\"\"What are you saying, don Juan?\"\"I'm saying that you have had your third encounter with your worthy opponent.She's following you around, waiting for a moment of weakness on your part. Shealmost bagged you this time.\"I felt a surge of anxiety and accused him of putting me in unnecessary danger. Icomplained that the game he was playing with me was cruel.\"It would be cruel if this would have happened to an average man,\" he said. \"Butthe instant one begins to live like a warrior, one is no longer ordinary.\"Besides, I didn't find you a worthy opponent because I want to play with you,or tease you, or annoy you. A worthy opponent might spur you on. Under theinfluence of an opponent like la Catalina, you may have to make use ofeverything I have taught you. You don't have any other alternative.\"We were quiet for a while. His words had aroused a tremendous apprehension inme.He then wanted me to imitate as close as possible the cry I had heard after Ihad said \"Buenas noches\".I attempted to reproduce the sound and came up with some weird howling thatscared me. Don Juan must have found my rendition funny. He laughed almostuncontrollably.Afterwards he asked me to reconstruct the total sequence: the distance I ran,the distance the woman was from me at the time I encountered her, the distanceshe was from me at the time I reached the house, and the place where she hadbegun hopping.\"No fat Indian woman could hop that way,\" he said after assessing all thosevariables. \"They could not even run that far.\"He made me hop. I could not cover more than four feet each time, and if I werecorrect in my perception, the woman had hopped at least ten feet with each leap.\"Of course, you know that from now on you must be on the lookout,\" he said in atone of great urgency. \"She will try to tap you on your left shoulder during amoment when you are unaware and weak.\"\"What should I do?\" I asked.\"It is meaningless to complain,\" he said. \"What's important from this point onis the strategy of your life.\"I could not concentrate at all on what he was saying. I took notesautomatically. After a long silence, he asked if I had any pain behind my earsor in the nape of my neck. I said no; and he told me that if I had experiencedan uncomfortable sensation in either of those two areas, it would have meantthat I had been clumsy and that la Catalina had injured me.\"Everything you did that night was clumsy,\" he said. \"First of all, you went tothe party to kill time as though there is any time to kill. That weakened you.\"\"You mean I shouldn't go to parties?\"\"No, I don't mean that. You may go any place you wish, but if you do, you mustassume the full responsibility for that act. A warrior lives his lifestrategically. He would attend a party or a reunion like that only if hisstrategy calls for it. That means, of course, that he would be in total controland would perform all the acts that he deems necessary.\"He looked at me fixedly and smiled, then covered his face and chuckled softly.\"You are in a terrible bind,\" he said. \"Your opponent is on your trail and forthe first time in your life, you cannot afford to act helter-skelter. This timeyou will have to learn a totally different doing; the doing of strategy. Thinkof it this way. If you survive the onslaughts of la Catalina you will have tothank her someday for having forced you to change your doing.\"\"What a terrible way of putting it!\" I exclaimed. \"What if I don't survive?\"\"A warrior never indulges in thoughts like that,\" he said. \"When he has to actwith his fellow men, a warrior follows the doing of strategy, and in that doingthere are no victories or defeats. In that doing there are only actions.\"I asked him what the doing of strategy entailed.\"It entails that one is not at the mercy of people,\" he replied. \"At that party,for instance, you were a clown; not because it served your purposes to be aclown, but because you placed yourself at the mercy of those people. You neverhad any control, and thus you had to run away from them.\"\"What should I have done?\"\"Not go there at all, or else go there to perform a specific act.\"After horsing around with the Mexicans, you were weak, and la Catalina usedthat opportunity. So she placed herself in the road to wait for you.\"Your body knew that something was out of place, though, and yet you spoke toher. That was terrible. You must not utter a single word to your opponent duringone of those encounters. Then you turned your back to her. That was even worse.Then you ran away from her, and that was the worst thing you could have done!\"Apparently she is clumsy. A sorcerer that is worth her salt would have mowedyou down right then; the instant you turned your back and ran away.\"So far your only defence is to stay put and do your dance.\"\"What dance are you talking about?\" I asked.He said that the 'rabbit thumping' he had taught me was the first movement ofthe dance that a warrior groomed and enlarged throughout his life, and thenexecuted in his last stand on earth.I had a moment of strange sobriety and a series of thoughts occurred to me. Onone level it was clear that what had taken place between me and la Catalina thefirst time I had confronted her was real. La Catalina was real, and I could notdiscard the possibility that she was actually following me. On the other level,I could not understand how she was following me. This gave rise to the faintsuspicion that don Juan might be tricking me, and that he himself was somehowproducing the weird effects I had witnessed. Don Juan suddenly looked at the sky, and told me that there was still time to goand check the sorceress. He reassured me that we were running very little dangerbecause we were only going to drive by her house.\"You must confirm her shape,\" don Juan said. \"Then there won't be any doubtsleft in your mind one way or the other.\"My hands began to sweat profusely, and I had to dry them repeatedly with atowel. We got in my car. Don Juan directed me to the main highway, and then to awide unpaved road. I drove in the centre of it. Heavy trucks and tractors hadcarved deep trenches, and my car was too low to go on either the left or theright side of the road.We went slowly amid a thick cloud of dust. The coarse gravel which was used tolevel the road had lumped with dirt during the rains, and chunks of dry mudrocks bounced against the metal underside of my car, making loud explosivesounds.Don Juan told me to slow down as we were coming to a small bridge. There werefour Indians sitting there and they waved at us. I was not sure whether or not Iknew them. We passed the bridge and the road curved gently.\"That's the woman's house,\" don Juan whispered to me as he pointed with his eyesto a white house with a high bamboo fence all around it.He told me to make a U-turn and stop in the middle of the road, and wait to seeif the woman became suspicious enough to show her face.We stayed there perhaps ten minutes. I thought it was an interminable time. DonJuan did not say a word. He sat motionless, looking at the house.\"There she is,\" he said, and his body gave a sudden jump.I saw the dark foreboding silhouette of a woman standing inside the house,looking through the open door. The room was dark and that only accentuated thedarkness of the woman's silhouette.After a few minutes the woman stepped out of the darkness of the room. She stoodin the doorway and watched us. We looked at her for a moment, and then don Juantold me to drive on. I was speechless. I could have sworn that she was the womanI had seen hopping by the road in the darkness.About half an hour later when we had turned on to the paved highway, don Juanspoke to me.\"What do you say?\" he asked. \"Did you recognize the shape?\"I hesitated for a long time before answering. I was afraid of the commitmententailed in saying yes. I carefully worded my reply, and said that I thought ithad been too dark to be completely sure.He laughed and tapped me gently on my head.\"She was the one, wasn't she?\" he asked.He did not give me time to reply. He put a finger to his mouth in a gesture ofsilence and whispered in my ear that it was meaningless to say anything, andthat in order to survive la Catalina's onslaughts I had to make use ofeverything he had taught me. ================================================================= Part Two - Journey to Ixtlan In May of 1971 I paid don Juan the last visit of my apprenticeship.I went to see him on that occasion in the same spirit I had gone to see himduring the ten years of our association; that is to say, I was once againseeking the amenity of his company.His friend don Genaro, a Mazatec Indian sorcerer, was with him. I had seen bothof them during my previous visit six months earlier. I was considering whether or not to ask them if they had been together all thattime, when don Genaro explained that Genaro liked the northern desert so muchthat he had returned just in time to see me. Both of them laughed as if theyknew a secret.\"I came back just for you,\" don Genaro said.\"That's true,\" don Juan echoed.I reminded don Genaro that the last time I had been there, his attempts to helpme to 'stop the world' has been disastrous for me. That was my friendly way ofletting him know that I was afraid of him.He laughed uncontrollably, shaking his body and kicking his legs like a child.Don Juan avoided looking at me and also laughed.\"You're not going to try to help me any more, are you, don Genaro?\" I asked.My question threw both of them into spasms of laughter. Don Genaro rolled on theground, laughing, then lay on his stomach, and began to swim on the floor. WhenI saw him doing that I knew I was lost. At that moment, my body somehow becameaware that I had arrived at the end. I did not know what that end was. Mypersonal tendency to dramatize, and my previous experience with don Genaro mademe believe that it might be the end of my life.During my last visit to them, don Genaro had attempted to push me to the brinkof stopping the world. His efforts had been so bizarre and direct that don Juanhimself had told me to leave.Don Genaro's demonstrations of power were so extraordinary and so baffling thatthey forced me to a total re-evaluation of myself. I went home, reviewed thenotes that I had taken in the very beginning of my apprenticeship, and a wholenew feeling mysteriously set in on me; although I had not been fully aware of ituntil I saw don Genaro swimming on the floor.The act of swimming on the floor, which was congruous with other strange andbewildering acts he had performed in front of my very eyes, started as he waslying face down. He was first laughing so hard that his body shook as in aconvulsion. Then he began kicking. And finally, the movement of his legs becamecoordinated with a paddling movement of his arms. Don Genaro started to slide onthe ground as if he were lying on a board fitted with ball bearings. He changeddirections various times and covered the entire area of the front of don Juan'shouse, manoeuvring around me and don Juan.Don Genaro had clowned in front of me before, and every time he had done it donJuan had asserted that I had been on the brink of seeing. My failure to see wasa result of my insistence on trying to explain every one of don Genaro's actionsfrom a rational point of view.This time I was on guard, and when he began to swim, I did not attempt toexplain or understand the event. I simply watched him. Yet I could not avoid thesensation of being dumbfounded. He was actually sliding on his stomach andchest. My eyes began to cross as I watched him.I felt a surge of apprehension. I was convinced that if I did not explain whatwas happening I would see, and that thought filled me with an extraordinaryanxiety. My nervous anticipation was so great that in some way I was back at thesame point; locked once more in some rational endeavour.Don Juan must have been watching me. He suddenly tapped me. I automaticallyturned to face him, and for an instant I took my eyes away from don Genaro.When I looked at Genaro again, he was standing by me with his head slightlytilted and his chin almost resting on my right shoulder.I had a delayed startled reaction: I looked at him for a second and then Ijumped back.His expression of feigned surprise was so comical that I laughed hysterically. Icould not help being aware, however, that my laughter was unusual. My body shookwith nervous spasms originating from the middle part of my stomach. Don Genaroput his hand on my stomach and the convulsion-like ripples ceased.\"This little Carlos is always so exaggerated!\" he exclaimed as if he were afastidious [* fastidious- giving careful attention to detail; hard to please]man.Then he added, imitating don Juan's voice and mannerisms, \"Don't you know that awarrior never laughs that way?\"His caricature of don Juan was so perfect that I laughed even harder.Then both of them left together, and were gone for over two hours until aboutmidday.When they returned, they sat in the area in front of don Juan's house. They didnot say a word. They seemed to be sleepy, tired, and almost absent-minded. Theystayed motionless for a long time, yet they seemed to be so comfortable andrelaxed. Don Juan's mouth was slightly opened, as if he were really asleep, buthis hands were clasped over his lap and his thumbs moved rhythmically.I fretted and changed sitting positions for a while, then I began to feel asoothing placidity. [* placidity- a feeling of calmness] I must have fallenasleep. Don Juan's chuckle woke me up. I opened my eyes. Both of them werestaring at me.\"If you don't talk, you fall asleep,\" don Juan said, laughing.\"I'm afraid I do,\" I said.Don Genaro lay on his back and began to kick his legs in the air. I thought fora moment that he was going to start his disturbing clowning again, but he wentback right away to his cross-legged sitting position.\"There is something you ought to be aware of by now,\" don Juan said. \"I call itthe cubic centimetre of chance. All of us, whether or not we are warriors, havea cubic centimetre of chance that pops out in front of our eyes from time totime.\"The difference between an average man and a warrior is that the warrior isaware of this; and one of his tasks is to be alert, deliberately waiting, sothat when his cubic centimetre pops out he has the necessary speed- the prowessto pick it up.\"Chance, good luck, personal power, or whatever you may call it, is a peculiarstate of affairs. It is like a very small stick that comes out in front of us,and invites us to pluck it. Usually we are too busy, or too preoccupied, or justtoo stupid and lazy to realize that that is our cubic centimetre of luck. Awarrior, on the other hand, is always alert and tight and has the spring- thegumption necessary to grab it.\"\"Is your life very tight?\" don Genaro asked me abruptly.\"I think it is,\" I said with conviction.\"Do you think that you can pluck your cubic centimetre of luck?\" don Juan askedme with a tone of incredulity. [* incredulity- doubt about the truth ofsomething]\"I believe I do that all the time,\" I said.\"I think you are only alert about things you know,\" don Juan said.\"Maybe I'm kidding myself, but I do believe that nowadays I am more aware thanat any other time in my life,\" I said and really meant it.Don Genaro nodded his head in approval.\"Yes,\" he said softly, as if talking to himself. \"Little Carlos is really tight,and absolutely alert.\"I felt that they were humouring me. I thought that perhaps my assertion about myalleged condition of tightness may have annoyed them.\"I didn't mean to brag,\" I said.Don Genaro arched his eyebrows and enlarged his nostrils. He glanced at mynotebook and pretended to be writing.\"I think Carlos is tighter than ever,\" don Juan said to don Genaro.\"Maybe he's too tight,\" don Genaro snapped.\"He may very well be,\" don Juan conceded.I did not know what to interject at that point so I remained quiet. \"Do you remember the time when I jammed your car?\" don Juan asked casually.His question was abrupt and unrelated to what we had been talking about. He wasreferring to a time when I could not start the engine of my car until he said Icould.I remarked that no one could forget such an event.\"That was nothing,\" don Juan asserted in a factual tone.\"Nothing at all. True, Genaro?\"\"True,\" don Genaro said indifferently.\"What do you mean?\" I said in a tone of protest. \"What you did that day wassomething truly beyond my comprehension.\"\"That's not saying much,\" don Genaro retorted.They both laughed loudly, and then don Juan patted me on the back.\"Genaro can do something much better than jamming your car,\" he went on. \"True,Genaro?\"\"True,\" don Genaro replied, puckering up his lips like a child.\"What can he do?\" I asked, trying to sound unruffled.\"Genaro can take your whole car away!\" don Juan exclaimed in a booming voice.Then he added in the same tone, \"True, Genaro?\"\"True!\" don Genaro retorted in the loudest human tone I had ever heard.I jumped involuntarily. My body was convulsed by three or four nervous spasms.\"What do you mean, he can take my whole car away?\" I asked.\"What did I mean, Genaro?\" don Juan asked.\"You meant that I can get into his car, turn the motor on, and drive away,\" donGenaro replied with unconvincing seriousness.\"Take the car away, Genaro,\" don Juan urged him in a joking tone.\"It's done!\" don Genaro said, frowning and looking at me askew.I noticed that as he frowned his eyebrows rippled, making the look in his eyesmischievous and penetrating.\"All right,\" don Juan said calmly. \"Let's go down there and examine the car.\"\"Yes!\" don Genaro echoed. \"Let's go down there and examine the car.\"They stood up, very slowly. For an instant I did not know what to do, but donJuan signalled me to stand up.We began walking up the small hill in front of don Juan's house. Both of themflanked me with don Juan to my right and don Genaro to my left. They wereperhaps six or seven feet ahead of me, and always within my full field ofvision.\"Let's examine the car,\" don Genaro said again. Don Juan moved his hands as ifhe were spinning an invisible thread; don Genaro did likewise and repeated,\"Let's examine the car.\" They walked with a sort of bounce. Their steps werelonger than usual, and their hands moved as though they were whipping, orbatting some invisible objects in front of them. I had never seen don Juanclowning like that, and I felt almost embarrassed to look at him.We reached the hilltop, and I looked down to the area at the foot of the hillsome fifty yards away where I had parked my car. My stomach contracted with ajolt. The car was not there!I ran down the hill. My car was not anywhere in sight. I experienced a moment ofgreat confusion. I was disoriented.My car had been parked there since I had arrived early in the morning. Perhapshalf an hour before, I had come down to get a new pad of writing paper. At thattime I had thought of leaving the windows open because of the excessive heat,but the number of mosquitoes and other flying insects that abounded in the areahad made me change my mind. I had left the car locked as usual.I looked all around again. I refused to believe that my car was gone. I walkedto the edge of the cleared area.Don Juan and don Genaro joined me and stood by me doing exactly what I wasdoing; peering into the distance to see if the car was somewhere in sight. I hada moment of euphoria [* euphoria- a feeling of great (usually exaggerated)elation] that gave way to a disconcerting sense of annoyance. They seemed tohave noticed it and began to walk around me, moving their hands as if they wererolling dough in them.\"What do you think happened to the car, Genaro?\" don Juan asked in a meek tone.\"I drove it away,\" don Genaro said, and made the most astounding motion ofshifting gears and steering. He bent his legs as though he were sitting, andremained in that position for a few moments, obviously sustained only by themuscles of his legs. Then he shifted his weight to his right leg and stretchedhis left foot to mimic the action on the clutch. He made the sound of a motorwith his lips; and finally, to top everything, he pretended to have hit a bumpin the road and bobbed up and down, giving me the complete sensation of an ineptdriver that bounces without letting go of the steering wheel.Don Genaro's pantomime [* pantomime- a performance using gestures and bodymovements without words] was stupendous. Don Juan laughed until he was out ofbreath. I wanted to join them in their mirth, but I was unable to relax. I feltthreatened and ill at ease.An anxiety that had no precedence in my life possessed me. I felt I was burningup inside. I began kicking small rocks on the ground, and ended up hurling themwith an unconscious and unpredictable fury. It was as if the wrath was actuallyoutside of myself, and had suddenly enveloped me. Then the feeling of annoyanceleft me, as mysteriously as it had hit me. I took a deep breath and felt better.I did not dare to look at don Juan. My display of anger embarrassed me, but atthe same time I wanted to laugh. Don Juan came to my side, and patted me on theback. Don Genaro put his arm on my shoulder.\"It's all right,\" don Genaro said. \"Indulge yourself. Punch yourself in the noseand bleed. Then you can get a rock and knock your teeth out. It'll feel good!And if that doesn't help, you can mash your balls with the same rock on that bigboulder over there.\"Don Juan giggled. I told them that I was ashamed of myself for having behaved sopoorly. I did not know what had gotten into me. Don Juan said that he was sure Iknew exactly what was going on, that I was pretending not to know, and that itwas the act of pretending that made me angry.Don Genaro was unusually comforting. He patted my back repeatedly.\"It happens to all of us,\" don Juan said.\"What do you mean by that, don Juan?\" don Genaro asked. He was imitating myvoice, and mocking my habit of asking don Juan questions.Don Juan said some absurd things like, \"When the world is upside down, we areright side up; but when the world is right side up, we are upside down. Now whenthe world and we are right side up, we think we are upside down...\" He went onand on, talking gibberish while don Genaro mimicked my taking notes. He wrote onan invisible pad, enlarging his nostrils as he moved his hand, keeping his eyeswide open and fixed on don Juan. Don Genaro had caught on to my efforts to writewithout looking at my pad in order to avoid altering the natural flow ofconversation. His portrayal was genuinely hilarious.I suddenly felt very at ease, happy. Their laughter was soothing. For a moment,I let go and had a belly laugh.But then my mind entered into a new state of apprehension, confusion, andannoyance. I thought that whatever was taking place there was impossible. Infact, it was inconceivable according to the logical order by which I amaccustomed to judge the world at hand. Yet, as the perceiver, I perceived thatmy car was not there.The thought occurred to me, as it always had happened when don Juan hadconfronted me with inexplicable phenomena, [* phenomena- any state or processknown through the senses rather than by intuition or reasoning] that I was beingtricked by ordinary means. My mind had always, under stress, involuntarily andconsistently repeated the same construct.I began to consider how many confederates don Juan and don Genaro would haveneeded in order to lift my car and remove it from where I had parked it. I wasabsolutely sure that I had compulsively locked the doors; the handbrake was on;it was in gear; and the steering wheel was locked. In order to move it theywould have had to Lift it up bodily. That task would have required a labourforce that I was convinced neither of them could have brought together.Another possibility was that someone in agreement with them had broken into mycar, wired it, and driven it away. To do that would have required a specializedknowledge that was beyond their means. The only other possible explanation wasthat perhaps they were mesmerizing me. Their movements were so novel to me andso suspicious that I entered into a spin of rationalizations. I thought that ifthey were hypnotizing me, then I was in a state of altered consciousness.In my experience with don Juan I had noticed that in such states one isincapable of keeping a consistent mental record of the passage of time. Therehad never been an enduring order in matters of passage of time in all the statesof nonordinary reality I had experienced. My conclusion was that if I keptmyself alert a moment would come when I would lose my order of sequential time.As if, for example, I were looking at a mountain at a given moment, and then inmy next moment of awareness I found myself looking at a valley in the oppositedirection, but without remembering having turned around.I felt that if something of that nature would happen to me I could then explainwhat was taking place with my car, as perhaps, a case of hypnosis. I decidedthat the only thing I could do was to watch every detail with excruciatingthoroughness. \"Where's my car?\" I asked, addressing both of them.\"Where's the car, Genaro?\" don Juan asked with a look of utmost seriousness.Don Genaro began turning over small rocks and looking underneath them. He workedfeverishly over the whole flat area where I had parked my car. He actuallyturned over every rock. At times he would pretend to get angry, and would hurlthe rock into the bushes.Don Juan seemed to enjoy the scene beyond words. He giggled and chuckled, andwas almost oblivious to my presence.Don Genaro had just finished hurling a rock in a display of sham frustrationwhen he came upon a good-sized boulder, the only large and heavy rock in theparking area. He attempted to turn it over, but it was too heavy and too deeplyimbedded in the ground. He struggled and puffed until he was perspiring. Then hesat on the rock, and called don Juan to help him.Don Juan turned to me with a beaming smile and said, \"Come on. Let's give Genaroa hand.\"\"What's he doing?\" I asked.\"He's looking for your car,\" don Juan said in a casual and factual tone.\"For heaven's sake! How can he find it under the rocks?\" I protested.\"For heaven's sake, why not?\" don Genaro retorted and both of them roared withlaughter.We could not budge the rock. Don Juan suggested that we go to the house, andlook for a thick piece of wood to use as a lever.On our way to the house, I told them that their acts were absurd and thatwhatever they were doing to me was unnecessary.Don Genaro peered at me.\"Genaro is a very thorough man,\" don Juan said with a serious expression.\" He'sas thorough and meticulous as you are. You yourself said that you never leave astone unturned. He's doing the same.\"Don Genaro patted me on the shoulder, and said that don Juan was absolutelyright. Don Genaro said that, in fact, he wanted to be like me. He looked at mewith an insane glint and opened his nostrils.Don Juan clapped his hands, and threw his hat to the ground.After a long search around the house for a thick piece of wood, don Genaro founda long and fairly thick tree trunk; a part of a house beam. He put it across hisshoulders and we started back to the place where my car had been.As we were going up the small hill, and were about to reach a bend in the trailfrom where I would see the flat parking area, I had a sudden insight. Itoccurred to me that I was going to find my car before they did, but when Ilooked down there was no car at the foot of the hill.Don Juan and don Genaro must have understood what I had had in mind and ranafter me, laughing uproariously.Once we got to the bottom of the hill, they immediately went to work. I watchedthem for a few moments. Their acts were incomprehensible. They were notpretending that they were working: They were actually immersed in the task ofturning over a boulder to see if my car was underneath.That was too much for me, and I joined them. They puffed and yelled, and donGenaro howled like a coyote. They were soaked in perspiration. I noticed howterribly strong their bodies were, especially don Juan's. Next to them, I was aflabby young man.Very soon I was also perspiring copiously. [* copiously- in an abundant manner]Finally we succeeded in turning over the boulder and don Genaro examined thedirt underneath the rock with the most maddening patience and thoroughness.\"No. It isn't here,\" he announced.That statement brought both of them down to the ground with laughter.I laughed nervously. Don Juan seemed to have true spasms of pain. He covered hisface, and lay down as his body shook with laughter.\"In which direction do we go now?\" don Genaro asked after a long rest.Don Juan pointed with a nod of his head.\"Where are we going?\" I asked.\"To look for your car!\" don Juan said, and did not crack a smile.They again flanked me as we walked into the brush. We had only covered a fewyards when don Genaro signalled us to stop. He tiptoed to a round bush a fewsteps away, looked in the inside branches for a few moments, and said that thecar was not there.We kept on walking for a while, and then don Genaro made a gesture with his handto be quiet. He arched his back as he stood on his toes, and extended his armsover his head. His fingers were contracted like a claw. From where I stood, donGenaro's body had the shape of a letter S. He maintained that position for aninstant, and then virtually plunged headfirst on a long twig with dry leaves. Hecarefully lifted it up, examined it, and again remarked that the car was notthere.As we walked into the deep chaparral, he looked behind bushes. He climbed smallpaloverde trees to look into their foliage; only to conclude that the car wasnot there either.Meanwhile I kept a most meticulous mental record of everything I touched or saw.My sequential and orderly view of the world around me was as continuous as ithad always been. I touched rocks, bushes, and trees. I shifted my view from theforeground to the background by looking out of one eye, and then out of theother. By all calculations, I was walking in the chaparral as I had done scoresof times during my ordinary life.Next don Genaro lay down on his stomach, and asked us to do likewise. He restedhis chin on his clasped hands. Don Juan did the same. Both of them stared at aseries of small protuberances on the ground that looked like minute hills.Suddenly don Genaro made a sweeping movement with his right hand, and claspedsomething. He hurriedly stood up and so did don Juan. Don Genaro held hisclasped hand in front of us, and signalled us to come closer and look.Then he slowly began to open his hand. When it was half open, a big black objectflew away. The motion was so sudden and the flying object was so big that Ijumped back and nearly lost my balance. Don Juan propped me up.\"That wasn't the car,\" don Genaro complained. \"It was a goddarn fly. Sorry!\"Both of them scrutinized me. They were standing in front of me. They were notlooking directly at me, but out of the corners of their eyes. It was a prolongedlook.\"It was a fly, wasn't it?\" don Genaro asked me.\"I think so,\" I said.\"Don't think,\" don Juan ordered me imperiously. \"What did you see?\"\"I saw something as big as a crow flying out of his hand,\" I said.My statement was congruous with what I had perceived, and was not intended as ajoke; but they took it as perhaps the most hilarious statement that anyone hadmade that day. Both of them jumped up and down and laughed until they choked.\"I think Carlos has had enough,\" don Juan said. His voice sounded hoarse fromlaughing.Don Genaro said that he was about to find my car; that the feeling was gettinghotter and hotter. Don Juan said we were in a rugged area, and that to find thecar there was not a desirable thing.Don Genaro took off his hat, and rearranged the strap with a piece of stringfrom his pouch. Then he attached his woollen belt to a yellow tassel affixed tothe brim of the hat.\"I'm making a kite out of my hat,\" he said to me.I watched him and I knew he was joking. I had always considered myself to be anexpert on kites. When I was a child I used to make the most complex kites and Iknew that the brim of the straw hat was too brittle to resist the wind. Thehat's crown, on the other hand, was too deep and the wind would circulate insideit, making it impossible to lift the hat off the ground.\"You don't think it'll fly, do you?\" don Juan asked me.\"I know it won't,\" I said.Don Genaro was unconcerned, and finished attaching a long string to hiskite-hat.It was a windy day. Don Genaro ran downhill as don Juan held his hat. Then donGenaro pulled the string, and the darn thing actually flew.\"Look, look at the kite!\" don Genaro yelled.It bobbed a couple of times, but it remained in the air.\"Don't take your eyes off the kite,\" don Juan said firmly.For a moment I felt dizzy. Looking at the kite, I had had a completerecollection of another time. It was as if I were flying a kite myself as I usedto when it was windy in the hills of my home town.For a brief moment the recollection engulfed me, and I lost my awareness of thepassage of time.I heard don Genaro yelling something. I saw the hat bobbing up and down, andthen falling to the ground where my car was. It all took place with such speedthat I did not have a clear picture of what had happened. I became dizzy andabsent-minded. My mind held on to a very confusing image. I either saw donGenaro's hat turning into my car, or I saw the hat falling over on top of thecar. I wanted to believe the latter, that don Genaro had used his hat to pointat my car. Not that it really mattered; one thing was as awesome as the other,but just the same my mind hooked on that arbitrary detail in order to keep myoriginal mental balance.\"Don't fight it,\" I heard don Juan saying.I felt that something inside me was about to surface. Thoughts and images camein uncontrollable waves as if I were falling asleep. I stared at the cardumbfounded. It was sitting on a rocky flat area about a hundred feet away. Itactually looked as if someone had just placed it there. I ran towards it andbegan to examine it.\"Goddarnit!\" don Juan exclaimed. \"Don't stare at the car. Stop the world!\"Then as in a dream I heard him yelling, \"Genaro's hat! Genaro's hat!\"I looked at them. They were staring at me directly. Their eyes were piercing. Ifelt a pain in my stomach. I had an instantaneous headache, and got ill.Don Juan and don Genaro looked at me curiously. I sat by the car for a while.Then, quite automatically, I unlocked the door and let don Genaro get in theback seat. Don Juan followed him and sat next to him. I thought that was strangebecause don Juan usually sat in the front seat.I drove my car to don Juan's house in a sort of haze. I was not myself at all.My stomach was very upset, and the feeling of nausea demolished all my sobriety.I drove mechanically.I heard don Juan and don Genaro in the back seat laughing and giggling likechildren. I heard don Juan asking me, \"Are we getting closer?\"It was at that point that I took deliberate notice of the road. We were actuallyvery close to his house.\"We're about to get there,\" I muttered.They howled with laughter. They clapped their hands and slapped their thighs.When we arrived at the house I automatically jumped out of the car and openedthe door for them. Don Genaro stepped out first, and congratulated me for whathe said was the nicest and smoothest ride he had ever taken in his life. DonJuan said the same. I did not pay much attention to them.I locked my car and barely made it to the house. I heard don Juan and don Genaroroaring with laughter before I fell asleep.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"19. Stopping the World The next day, as soon as I woke up, I began asking don Juan questions.He had been cutting firewood in the back of his house, and don Genaro wasnowhere in sight.Don Juam said that there was nothing to talk about.I pointed out that I had succeeded in remaining aloof, and had observed donGenaro's swimming on the floor without wanting or demanding any explanationwhatsoever, but my restraint had not helped me to understand what was takingplace. Then, after the disappearance of the car, I became automatically lockedin seeking a logical explanation, but that did not help me either. I told donJuan that my insistence on finding explanations was not something that I hadarbitrarily devised myself, just to be difficult, but was something so deeplyingrained in me that it overruled every other consideration.\"It's like a disease,\" I said.\"There are no diseases,\" don Juan replied calmly. \"There is only indulging. Andyou indulge yourself in trying to explain everything. Explanations are no longernecessary in your case.\"I insisted that I could function only under conditions of order andunderstanding. I reminded him that I had drastically changed my personalityduring the time of our association, and that the condition that had made thatchange possible was that I had been capable of explaining to myself the reasonsfor that change.Don Juan laughed softly. He did not speak for a long time.\"You are very clever,\" he finally said. \"You go back to where you have alwaysbeen. This time you are finished though. You have no place to go back to. I willnot explain anything to you any more. Whatever Genaro did to you yesterday, hedid it to your body; so let your body decide what's what.\"Don Juan's tone was friendly, but unusually detached; and that made me feel anoverwhelming loneliness. I expressed my feelings of sadness. He smiled. Hisfingers gently clasped the top of my hand.\"We both are beings who are going to die,\" he said softly. \"There is no moretime for what we used to do. Now you must employ all the not-doing I have taughtyou, and stop the world.\"He clasped my hand again. His touch was firm and friendly. It was like areassurance that he was concerned, and had affection for me; and at the sametime, it gave me the impression of an unwavering purpose.\"This is my gesture for you,\" he said, holding the grip he had on my hand for aninstant. \"Now you must go by yourself into those friendly mountains.\" He pointedwith his chin to the distant range of mountains towards the southeast.He said that I had to remain there until my body told me to quit, and thenreturn to his house. He let me know that he did not want me to say anything, orto wait any longer by shoving me gently in the direction of my car.\"What am I supposed to do there?\" I asked.He did not answer, but looked at me, shaking his head.\"No more of that,\" he finally said.Then he pointed his finger to the southeast.\"Go there,\" he said cuttingly.I drove south and then east, following the roads I had always taken when drivingwith don Juan. I parked my car around the place where the dirt road ended, andthen I hiked on a familiar trail until I reached a high plateau. I had no ideawhat to do there. I began to meander, looking for a resting place.Suddenly I became aware of a small area to my left. It seemed that the chemicalcomposition of the soil was different on that spot, yet when I focused my eyeson it there was nothing visible that would account for the difference. I stood afew feet away and tried to 'feel' as don Juan had always recommended I shoulddo.I stayed motionless for perhaps an hour. My thoughts began to diminish bydegrees until I was no longer talking to myself. I then had a sensation ofannoyance. The feeling seemed to be confined to my stomach and was more acutewhen I faced the spot in question. I was repulsed by it, and felt compelled tomove away from it.I began scanning the area with crossed eyes, and after a short walk I came upona large flat rock. I stopped in front of it. There was nothing in particularabout the rock that attracted me. I did not detect any specific colour or anyshine on it, and yet I liked it. My body felt good. I experienced a sensation ofphysical comfort and sat down for a while. I meandered in the high plateau and the surrounding mountains all day withoutknowing what to do or what to expect. I came back to the flat rock at dusk. Iknew that if I spent the night there I would be safe.The next day I ventured farther east into the high mountains. By late afternoonI came to another even higher plateau. I thought I had been there before. Ilooked around to orient myself, but I could not recognize any of the surroundingpeaks.After carefully selecting a suitable place, I sat down to rest at the edge of abarren rocky area. I felt very warm and peaceful there. I tried to pour out somefood from my gourd, but it was empty. I drank some water. It was warm and stale.I thought that I had nothing else to do but to return to don Juan's house, andbegan to wonder whether or not I should start on my way back right away. I laydown on my stomach and rested my head on my arm. I felt uneasy and changedpositions various times until I found myself facing the west.The sun was already low. My eyes were tired. I looked down at the ground andcaught sight of a large black beetle. It came out from behind a small rockpushing a ball of dung twice its size. I followed its movements for a long time.The insect seemed unconcerned with my presence, and kept on pushing its loadover rocks, roots, depressions, and protuberances on the ground. For all I knew,the beetle was not aware that I was there. The thought occurred to me that Icould not possibly be sure that the insect was not aware of me. That thoughttriggered a series of rational evaluations about the nature of the insect'sworld as opposed to mine.The beetle and I were in the same world, and obviously the world was not thesame for both of us. I became immersed in watching it, and marvelled at thegigantic strength it needed to carry its load over rocks and down crevices.I observed the insect for a long time, and then I became aware of the silencearound me. Only the wind hissed between the branches and leaves of thechaparral. I looked up, turned to my left in a quick and involuntary fashion,and caught a glimpse of a faint shadow or a flicker on a rock a few feet away.At first I paid no attention to it, but then I realized that that flicker hadbeen to my left. I turned again suddenly, and was able clearly to perceive ashadow on the rock. I had the weird sensation that the shadow instantly sliddown to the ground, and the soil absorbed it as a blotter dries an ink blotch.A chill ran down my back. The thought crossed my mind that death was watching meand the beetle.I looked for the insect again, but I could not find it. I thought that it musthave arrived at its destination, and then had dropped its load into a hole inthe ground. I put my face against a smooth rock.The beetle emerged from a deep hole, and stopped a few inches away from my face.It seemed to look at me, and for a moment I felt that it became aware of mypresence; perhaps as I was aware of the presence of my death.I experienced a shiver. The beetle and I were not that different after all.Death, like a shadow, was stalking both of us from behind the boulder. I had anextraordinary moment of elation. The beetle and I were on a par. Neither of uswas better than the other. Our death made us equal.My elation and joy were so overwhelming that I began to weep. Don Juan wasright. He had always been right. I was living in a most mysterious world, andlike everyone else, I was a most mysterious being; and yet I was no moreimportant than a beetle.I wiped my eyes, and as I rubbed them with the back of my hand, I saw a man; orsomething which had the shape of a man. It was to my right about fifty yards. Isat up straight, and strained to see. The sun was almost on the horizon, and itsyellowish glow prevented me from getting a clear view. I heard a peculiar roarat that moment. It was like the sound of a distant jet plane. As I focused myattention on it, the roar increased to a prolonged sharp metallic whizzing, andthen it softened until it was a mesmerizing, melodious sound. The melody waslike the vibration of an electrical current.The image that came to my mind was that two electrified spheres were comingtogether; or two square blocks of electrified metal were rubbing against eachother, and then coming to rest with a thump when they were perfectly levelledwith each other.I again strained to see if I could distinguish the person that seemed to behiding from me, but I could only detect a dark shape against the bushes. Ishielded my eyes by placing my hands above them. The brilliancy of the sunlightchanged at that moment, and then I realized that what I was seeing was only anoptical illusion; a play of shadows and foliage. I moved my eyes away, and I saw a coyote calmly trotting across the field. Thecoyote was around the spot where I thought I had seen the man. It moved aboutfifty yards in a southerly direction, and then it stopped, turned, and beganwalking towards me.I yelled a couple of times to scare it away, but it kept on coming. I had amoment of apprehension. I thought that it might be rabid, and I even consideredgathering some rocks to defend myself in case of an attack.When the animal was ten to fifteen feet away I noticed that it was not agitatedin any way; on the contrary, it seemed calm and unafraid. It slowed down itsgait, coming to a halt barely four or five feet from me. We looked at eachother, and then the coyote came even closer.Its brown eyes were friendly and clear. I sat down on the rocks and the coyotestood almost touching me. I was dumbfounded. I had never seen a wild coyote thatclose, and the only thing that occurred to me at that moment was to talk to it.I began as one would talk to a friendly dog. And then I thought that the coyote'talked' back to me. I had the absolute certainty that it had said something. Ifelt confused, but I did not have time to ponder upon my feelings, because thecoyote talked again.It was not that the animal was voicing words the way I am accustomed to hearingwords being voiced by human beings. It was rather a feeling that it was talking,but it was not like a feeling that one has when a pet seems to communicate withits master either.The coyote actually said something. It relayed a thought and that communicationcame out in something quite similar to a sentence. I had said, \"How are you,little coyote?\"I thought I had heard the animal respond, \"I'm all right, and you?\" Then thecoyote repeated the sentence and I jumped to my feet.The animal did not make a single movement. It was not even startled by my suddenjump. Its eyes were still friendly and clear. It lay down on its stomach andtilted its head and asked, \"Why are you afraid?\"I sat down facing it, and I carried on the weirdest conversation I had ever had.Finally it asked me what I was doing there, and I said I had come there to stopthe world.The coyote said, \"Que bueno!\" and then I realized that it was a bilingualcoyote. The nouns and verbs of its sentences were in English, but theconjunctions and exclamations were in Spanish. The thought crossed my mind thatI was in the presence of a Chicano coyote. I began to laugh at the absurdity ofit all, and I laughed so hard that I became almost hysterical.Then the full weight of the impossibility of what was happening struck me and mymind wobbled. The coyote stood up and our eyes met. I stared fixedly into them.I felt they were pulling me and suddenly the animal became iridescent. It beganto glow.It was as if my mind were replaying the memory of another event that had takenplace ten years before when under the influence of peyote I witnessed themetamorphosis of an ordinary dog into an unforgettable iridescent being. It wasas though the coyote had triggered the recollection, and the memory of thatprevious event was summoned and became superimposed on the coyote's shape. Thecoyote was a fluid, liquid, luminous being. Its luminosity was dazzling.I wanted to cover my eyes with my hands to protect them, but I could not move.The luminous being touched me in some undefined part of myself, and my bodyexperienced such an exquisite indescribable warmth and well-being that it was asif the touch had made me explode. I became transfixed. I could not feel my feet,or my legs, or any part of my body; yet something was sustaining me erect.I have no idea how long I stayed in that position. In the meantime, the luminouscoyote and the hilltop where I stood melted away. I had no thoughts or feelings.Everything had been turned off, and I was floating freely.Suddenly I felt that my body had been struck, and then it became enveloped bysomething that kindled me. I became aware then that the sun was shining on me. Icould vaguely distinguish a distant range of mountains towards the west.The sun was almost over the horizon. I was looking directly into it and then Isaw the 'lines of the world'. I actually perceived the most extraordinaryprofusion of fluorescent white lines which crisscrossed everything around me.For a moment I thought that I was perhaps experiencing sunlight as it was beingrefracted by my eyelashes. I blinked and looked again. The lines were constant,and were superimposed on, or were coming through everything in the surroundings.I turned around and examined an extraordinarily new world. The lines werevisible and steady even if I looked away from the sun.I stayed on the hilltop in a state of ecstasy for what appeared to be an endlesstime, yet the whole event may have lasted only a few minutes, perhaps only aslong as the sun shone before it reached the horizon, but to me it seemed anendless time.I felt something warm and soothing oozing out of the world and out of my ownbody. I knew I had discovered a secret. It was so simple. I experienced anunknown flood of feelings. Never in my life had I had such a divine euphoria,such peace, such an encompassing grasp, and yet I could not put the discoveredsecret into words, or even into thoughts- but my body knew it.Then I either fell asleep, or I fainted. When I again became aware of myself, Iwas lying on the rocks. I stood up. The world was as I had always seen it. Itwas getting dark, and I automatically started on my way back to my car. Don Juan was alone in the house when I arrived the next morning. I asked himabout don Genaro, and he said that he was somewhere in the vicinity running anerrand. I immediately began to narrate to him the extraordinary experiences Ihad had. He listened with obvious interest.\"You have simply stopped the world,\" he commented after I had finished myaccount.We remained silent for a moment, and then don Juan said that I had to thank donGenaro for helping me. He seemed to be unusually pleased with me. He patted myback repeatedly and chuckled.\"But it is inconceivable that a coyote could talk,\" I said.\"It wasn't talk,\" don Juan replied.\"What was it then?\"\"Your body understood for the first time. But you failed to recognize that itwas not a coyote to begin with, and that it certainly was not talking the wayyou and I talk.\"\"But the coyote really talked, don Juan!\"\"Now look who is talking like an idiot. After all these years of learning, youshould know better. Yesterday you stopped the world and you might have evenseen. A magical being told you something, and your body was capable ofunderstanding it because the world had collapsed.\"\"The world was like it is today, don Juan.\"\"No, it wasn't. Today the coyotes do not tell you anything, and you cannot seethe lines of the world. Yesterday you did all that simply because something hadstopped in you.\"\"What was the thing that stopped in me?\"\"What stopped inside you yesterday was what people have been telling you theworld is like. You see, people tell us from the time we are born that the worldis such and such and so and so, and naturally we have no choice but to see theworld the way people have been telling us it is.\"We looked at each other.\"Yesterday the world became as sorcerers tell you it is,\" he went on. \"In thatworld coyotes talk, and so do deer, as I once told you, and so do rattlesnakesand trees and all other living beings. But what I want you to learn is seeing.\"Perhaps you know now that seeing happens only when one sneaks between theworlds; the world of ordinary people and the world of sorcerers. You are nowsmack in the middle point between the two. Yesterday you believed the coyotetalked to you.\"Any sorcerer who doesn't see would believe the same, but one who sees knowsthat to believe that is to be pinned down in the realm of sorcerers. By the sametoken, not to believe that coyotes talk is to be pinned down in the realm ofordinary men.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that neither the world of ordinary men nor the world ofsorcerers is real?\"\"They are real worlds. They could act upon you. For example, you could haveasked that coyote about anything you wanted to know, and it would have beencompelled to give you an answer. The only sad part is that coyotes are notreliable. They are tricksters. It is your fate not to have a dependable animalcompanion.\"Don Juan explained that the coyote was going to be my companion for life, andthat in the world of sorcerers to have a coyote friend was not a desirable stateof affairs. He said that it would have been ideal for me to have talked to arattlesnake since they were stupendous companions.\"If it were me,\" he added, \"I would never trust a coyote. But you are different,and you may even become a coyote sorcerer.\"\"What is a coyote sorcerer?\"\"One who draws a lot of things from his coyote brothers.\"I wanted to keep on asking questions, but he made a gesture to stop me.\"You have seen the lines of the world,\" he said. \"You have seen a luminousbeing. You are now almost ready to meet the ally. Of course you know that theman you saw in the bushes was the ally. You heard its roar like the sound of ajet plane. He'll be waiting for you at the edge of a plain, a plain I will takeyou to myself.\"We were quiet for a long time. Don Juan had his hands clasped over his stomach.His thumbs moved almost imperceptibly.\"Genaro will also have to go with us to that valley,\" he said all of a sudden.\"He is the one who has helped you to stop the world.\"Don Juan looked at me with piercing eyes.\"I will tell you one more thing,\" he said and laughed. \"It really does matternow. Genaro never moved your car from the world of ordinary men the other day.He simply forced you to look at the world like sorcerers do, and your car wasnot in that world.\"Genaro wanted to soften your certainty. His clowning told your body about theabsurdity of trying to understand everything. And when he flew his kite youalmost saw. You found your car, and you were in both worlds. The reason wenearly split our guts laughing was because you really thought you were drivingus back from where you thought you had found your car.\"\"But how did he force me to see the world as sorcerers do?\"\"I was with him. We both know that world. Once one knows that world, all oneneeds to bring it about is to use that extra ring of power I have told yousorcerers have. Genaro can do that as easily as snapping his fingers. He keptyou busy turning over rocks in order to distract your thoughts and allow yourbody to see.\"I told him that the events of the last three days had done some irreparabledamage to my idea of the world. I said that during the ten years I had beenassociated with him I had never been so moved, not even during the times I hadingested psychotropic plants.\"Power plants are only an aid,\" don Juan said. \"The real thing is when the bodyrealizes that it can see. Only then is one capable of knowing that the world welook at every day is only a description. My intent has been to show you that.Unfortunately, you have very little time left before the ally tackles you.\"\"Does the ally have to tackle me?\"\"There is no way to avoid it. In order to see, one must learn the way sorcererslook at the world; and thus the ally has to be summoned, and once that is doneit comes.\"\"Couldn't you have taught me to see without summoning the ally?\"\"No. In order to see one must learn to look at the world in some other fashion,and the only other fashion I know is the way of a sorcerer.\"================================================================"},{"pageContent":"20. Journey to Ixtlan Don Genaro returned around noon, and at don Juan's suggestion I drove the threeof us down to the range of mountains where I had been the day before. We hikedon the same trail I had taken, but instead of stopping in the high plateau as Ihad done we kept on climbing until we reached the top of the lower range ofmountains. Then we began to descend into a flat valley.We stopped to rest on top of a high hill. Don Genaro picked the spot. Iautomatically sat down as I have always done in their company with don Juan tomy right and don Genaro to my left; making a triangle.The desert chaparral had acquired an exquisite moist sheen. It was brilliantlygreen after a short spring shower.\"Genaro is going to tell you something,\" don Juan said to me all of a sudden.\"He is going to tell you the story of his first encounter with his ally. Isn'tthat so, Genaro?\"There was a tone of coaxing in don Juan's voice. Don Genaro looked at me andcontracted his lips until his mouth looked like a round hole. He curled histongue against his palate, and opened and closed his mouth as if he were havingspasms.Don Juan looked at him and laughed loudly. I did not know what to make out ofit.\"What's he doing?\" I asked don Juan.\"He's a hen!\" he said.\"A hen?\"\"Look, look at his mouth. That's the hen's ass and it is about to lay an egg.\"The spasms of don Genaro's mouth seemed to increase. He had a strange, crazylook in his eyes. His mouth opened up as if the spasms were dilating the roundhole. He made a croaking sound in his throat, folded his arms over his chestwith his hands bent inward, and then unceremoniously spat out some phlegm.\"Darn it! It wasn't an egg,\" he said with a concerned look on his face.The posture of his body and the expression on his face were so ludicrous that Icould not help laughing.\"Now that Genaro almost laid an egg, maybe he will tell you about his firstencounter with his ally,\" don Juan insisted.\"Maybe,\" don Genaro said, uninterested.I pleaded with him to tell me.Don Genaro stood up, stretched his arms and back. His bones made a crackingsound. Then he sat down again. \"I was young when I first tackled my ally,\" he finally said. \"I remember that itwas in the early afternoon. I had been in the fields since daybreak and I wasreturning to my house.\"Suddenly from behind a bush, the ally came out and blocked my way. He had beenwaiting for me and was inviting me to wrestle him. I began to turn around inorder to leave him alone but the thought came to my mind that I was strongenough to tackle him. I was afraid though. A chill ran up my spine and my neckbecame stiff as a board. By the way, that is always the sign that you're ready,I mean, when your neck gets hard.\"He opened up his shirt and showed me his back. He stiffened the muscles of hisneck, back, and arms. I noticed the superb quality of his musculature. It was asif the memory of the encounter had activated every muscle in his torso.\"In such a situation,\" he continued, \"you must always close your mouth.\"He turned to don Juan and said, \"Isn't that so?\"\"Yes,\" don Juan said calmly. \"The jolt that one gets from grabbing an ally is sogreat that one might bite off one's tongue or knock one's teeth out. One's bodymust be straight and well-grounded, and the feet must grab the ground.\"Don Genaro stood up and showed me the proper position: his body slightly bent atthe knees, his arms hanging at his sides with the fingers curled gently. Heseemed relaxed and yet firmly set on the ground. He remained in that positionfor an instant, and when I thought he was going to sit down he suddenly lungedforward in one stupendous leap as if he had springs attached to his heels.His movement was so sudden that I fell down on my back; but as I fell I had theclear impression that don Genaro had grabbed a man, or something which had theshape of a man.I sat up again. Don Genaro was still maintaining a tremendous tension all overhis body. Then he relaxed his muscles abruptly and went back to where he hadbeen sitting before and sat down.\"Carlos just saw your ally right now,\" don Juan remarked casually, \"but he'sstill weak and fell down.\"\"Did you?\" don Genaro asked in a naive tone and enlarged his nostrils.Don Juan assured him that I had 'seen' it.Don Genaro leaped forward again with such a force that I fell on my side. Heexecuted his jump so fast that I really could not tell how he had sprung to hisfeet from a sitting position in order to lunge forward.Both of them laughed loudly and then don Genaro changed his laughter into ahowling indistinguishable from a coyote's.\"Don't think that you have to jump as well as Genaro in order to grab yourally,\" don Juan said in a cautioning tone. \"Genaro jumps so well because he hashis ally to help him. All you have to do is to be firmly grounded in order tosustain the impact. You have to stand just like Genaro did before he jumped,then you have to leap forward and grab the ally.\"\"He's got to kiss his medallion first,\" don Genaro interjected.Don Juan, with feigned severity, said that I had no medallions.\"What about his notebooks?\" don Genaro insisted. \"He's got to do something withhis notebooks- put them down somewhere before he jumps- or maybe he'll use hisnotebooks to beat the ally.\"\"I'll be darned!\" don Juan said with seemingly genuine surprise. \"I have neverthought of that. I bet it'll be the first time an ally is beaten down to theground with notebooks.\"When don Juan's laughter and don Genaro's coyote howlings subsided we were allin a very fine mood.\"What happened when you grabbed your ally, don Genaro?\" I asked.\"It was a powerful jolt,\" don Genaro said after a moment's hesitation. He seemedto have been putting his thoughts in order.\"Never would I have imagined it was going to be like that,\" he went on. \"It wassomething, something, something... like nothing I can tell. After I grabbed itwe began to spin. The ally made me twirl, but I didn't let go. We spun throughthe air with such speed and force that I couldn't see any more. Everything wasfoggy. The spinning went on, and on, and on.\"Suddenly I felt that I was standing on the ground again. I looked at myself.The ally had not killed me. I was in one piece. I was myself! I knew then that Ihad succeeded. At long last I had an ally. I jumped up and down with delight.What a feeling! What a feeling it was!\"Then I looked around to find out where I was. The surroundings were unknown tome. I thought that the ally must have taken me through the air and dumped mesomewhere very far from the place where we started to spin.\"I oriented myself. I thought that my home must be towards the east, so I beganto walk in that direction. It was still early. The encounter with the ally hadnot taken too long.\"Very soon I found a trail and then I saw a bunch of men and women comingtowards me. They were Indians. I thought they were Mazatec Indians. Theysurrounded me and asked me where I was going. 'I'm going home to Ixtlan,' I saidto them. 'Are you lost?' someone asked. 'I am,' I said. 'Why?' 'Because Ixtlanis not that way. Ixtlan is in the opposite direction. We ourselves are goingthere,' someone else said. 'Join us!' they all said. 'We have food!'\"Don Genaro stopped talking and looked at me as if he were waiting for me to aska question.\"Well, what happened?\" I asked. \"Did you join them?\"\"No, I didn't,\" he said. \"Because they were not real. I knew it right away theminute they came to me. There was something in their voices- in theirfriendliness that gave them away; especially when they asked me to join them. SoI ran away. They called me and begged me to come back. Their pleas becamehaunting, but I kept on running away from them.\"\"Who were they?\" I asked.\"People,\" don Genaro replied cuttingly. \"Except that they were not real.\"\"They were like apparitions,\" [* apparition- a ghostly appearing figure] donJuan explained. \"Like phantoms.\"\"After walking for a while,\" don Genaro went on, \"I became more confident. Iknew that Ixtlan was in the direction I was going. And then I saw two men comingdown the trail towards me. They also seemed to be Mazatec Indians. They had adonkey loaded with firewood. They went by me and mumbled, 'Good afternoon.'\"'Good afternoon!' I said and kept on walking. They did not pay any attention tome and went their way. I slowed down my gait and casually turned around to lookat them. They were walking away unconcerned with me. They seemed to be real. Iran after them and yelled, 'Wait, wait!'\"They held their donkey and stood on either side of the animal, as if they wereprotecting the load.\"'I am lost in these mountains,' I said to them. 'Which way is Ixtlan?' Theypointed in the direction they were going. 'You're very far,' one of them said.'It is on the other side of those mountains. It'll take you four or five days toget there.' Then they turned around and kept on walking. I felt that those werereal Indians and I begged them to let me join them.\"We walked together for a while and then one of them got his bundle of food andoffered me some. I froze on the spot. There was something terribly strange inthe way he offered me his food. My body felt frightened, so I jumped back andbegan to run away. They both said that I would die in the mountains if I did notgo with them and tried to coax me to join them. Their pleas were also veryhaunting, but I ran away from them with all my might.\"I kept on walking. I knew then that I was on the right way to Ixtlan and thatthose phantoms were trying to lure me out of my way.\"I encountered eight of them. They must have known that my determination wasunshakeable. They stood by the road and looked at me with pleading eyes. Most ofthem did not say a word. The women among them, however, were more daring andpleaded with me. Some of them even displayed food and other goods that they weresupposed to be selling, like innocent merchants by the side of the road. I didnot stop nor did I look at them.\"By late afternoon I came to a valley that I seemed to recognize. It was somehowfamiliar. I thought I had been there before, but if that was so I was actuallysouth of Ixtlan.\"I began to look for landmarks to properly orient myself and correct my routewhen I saw a little Indian boy tending some goats. He was perhaps seven yearsold and was dressed the way I had been when I was his age. In fact, he remindedme of myself tending my father's two goats.\"I watched him for some time. The boy was talking to himself, the same way Iused to, then he would talk to his goats. From what I knew about tending goatshe was really good at it. He was thorough and careful. He didn't pamper hisgoats, but he wasn't cruel to them either.\"I decided to call him. When I talked to him in a loud voice he jumped up andran away to a ledge, and peeked at me from behind some rocks. He seemed to beready to run for his life. I liked him. He seemed to be afraid and yet he stillfound time to herd his goats out of my sight.\"I talked to him for a long time. I said that I was lost and that I did not knowmy way to Ixtlan. I asked the name of the place where we were and he said it wasthe place I had thought it was.\"That made me very happy. I realized I was no longer lost and pondered on thepower that my ally had in order to transport my whole body that far in less timethan it takes to bat an eyelash.\"I thanked the boy and began to walk away. He casually came out of his hidingplace and herded his goats into an almost unnoticeable trail. The trail seemedto lead down into the valley. I called the boy and he did not run away. I walkedtowards him and he jumped into the bushes when I came too close. I commended himon being so cautious and began to ask him some questions.\"'Where does this trail lead?' I asked.\"'Down,' he said.\"'Where do you live?'\"'Down there.'\"'Are there lots of houses down there?'\"'No, just one.'\"'Where are the other houses?'\"The boy pointed towards the other side of the valley with indifference, the wayboys his age do. Then he began to go down the trail with his goats.\"'Wait,' I said to the boy. 'I'm very tired and hungry. Take me to your folks.'\"'I have no folks,' the little boy said and that jolted me. I don't know why buthis voice made me hesitate. The boy, noticing my hesitation, stopped and turnedto me. 'There's nobody at my house,' he said. 'My uncle is gone and his wifewent to the fields. There is plenty of food. Plenty. Come with me.'\"I almost felt sad. The boy was also a phantom. The tone of his voice and hiseagerness had betrayed him. The phantoms were out there to get me but I wasn'tafraid. I was still numb from my encounter with the ally. I wanted to get mad atthe ally or at the phantoms but somehow I couldn't get angry like I used to, soI gave up trying. Then I wanted to get sad, because I had liked that little boy,but I couldn't, so I gave up on that too.\"Suddenly I realized that I had an ally and that there was nothing that thephantoms could do to me. I followed the boy down the trail. Other phantomslurched out swiftly and tried to make me trip over the precipices, but my willwas stronger than they were. They must have sensed that, because they stoppedpestering me. After a while they simply stood by my path. From time to time someof them would leap towards me, but I stopped them with my will. And then theyquit bothering me altogether.\" Don Genaro remained quiet for a long time.Don Juan looked at me.\"What happened after that, don Genaro?\" I asked.\"I kept on walking,\" he said factually.It seemed that he had finished his tale and there was nothing he wanted to add.I asked him why was the fact that they offered him food a clue to their beingphantoms.He did not answer. I probed further and asked whether it was a custom amongMazatec Indians to deny that they had any food, or to be heavily concerned withmatters of food.He said that the tone of their voices, their eagerness to lure him out, and themanner in which the phantoms talked about food were the clues; and that he knewthat because his ally was helping him. He asserted that by himself alone hewould have never noticed those peculiarities.\"Were those phantoms allies, don Genaro?\" I asked.\"No. They were people.\"\"People? But you said they were phantoms.\"\"I said that they were no longer real. After my encounter with the ally nothingwas real any more.\"We were quiet for a long time.\"What was the final outcome of that experience, don Genaro?\" I asked.\"Final outcome?\"\"I mean, when and how did you finally reach Ixtlan?\"Both of them broke into laughter at once.\"So that's the final outcome for you,\" don Juan remarked. \"Let's put it this waythen. There was no final outcome to Genaro's journey. There will never be anyfinal outcome. Genaro is still on his way to Ixtlan!\"Don Genaro glanced at me with piercing eyes, and then turned his head to lookinto the distance towards the south.\"I will never reach Ixtlan,\" he said.His voice was firm but soft, almost a murmur.\"Yet in my feelings... in my feelings sometimes I think I'm just one step fromreaching it. Yet I never will. In my journey I don't even find the familiarlandmarks I used to know. Nothing is any longer the same.\"Don Juan and don Genaro looked at each other. There was something so sad abouttheir look.\"In my journey to Ixtlan I find only phantom travellers,\" he said softly.I looked at don Juan. I had not understood what don Genaro had meant.\"Everyone Genaro finds on his way to Ixtlan is only an ephemeral [* ephemeral-short lived; lasting a very short time] being,\" don Juan explained. \"Take you,for instance. You are a phantom. Your feelings and your eagerness are those ofpeople. That's why he says that he encounters only phantom travellers on hisjourney to Ixtlan.\"I suddenly realized that don Genaro's journey was a metaphor.\"Your journey to Ixtlan is not real then,\" I said.\"It is real!\" don Genaro interjected. \"The travellers are not real.\"He pointed to don Juan with a nod of his head and said emphatically, \"This isthe only one who is real. The world is real only when I am with this one.\"Don Juan smiled. \"Genaro was telling his story to you,\" don Juan said, \"because yesterday youstopped the world, and he thinks that you also saw, but you are such a fool thatyou don't know it yourself. I keep on telling him that you are weird, and thatsooner or later you will see.\"At any rate, in your next meeting with the ally, if there is a next time foryou, you will have to wrestle with it and tame it. If you survive the shock,which I'm sure you will since you're strong and have been living like a warrior,you will find yourself alive in an unknown land.\"Then, as is natural to all of us, the first thing you will want to do is tostart on your way back to Los Angeles. But there is no way to go back to LosAngeles. What you left there is lost forever. By then, of course, you will be asorcerer, but that's no help. At a time like that what's important to all of usis the fact that everything we love or hate or wish for has been left behind.\"Yet the feelings in a man do not die or change, and the sorcerer starts on hisway back home knowing that he will never reach it; knowing that no power onearth, not even his death, will deliver him to the place, the things, the peoplehe loved. That's what Genaro told you.\"Don Juan's explanation was like a catalyst; [* catalyst- something that causesan important event to happen] the full impact of don Genaro's story hit mesuddenly when I began to link the tale to my own life.\"What about the people I love?\" I asked don Juan. \"What would happen to them?\"\"They would all be left behind,\" he said.\"But is there no way I could retrieve them? Could I rescue them and take themwith me?\"\"No. Your ally will spin you, alone, into unknown worlds.\"\"But I could go back to Los Angeles, couldn't I? I could take the bus or a planeand go there. Los Angeles would still be there, wouldn't it?\"\"Sure,\" don Juan said, laughing. \"And so will Manteca and Temecula and Tucson.\"\"And Tecate,\" don Genaro added with great seriousness.\"And Piedras Negras and Tranquitas,\" don Juan said, smiling.Don Genaro added more names and so did don Juan; and they became involved inenumerating a series of the most hilarious and unbelievable names of cities andtowns.\"Spinning with your ally will change your idea of the world,\" don Juan said.\"That idea is everything, and when that changes, the world itself changes.\"He reminded me that I had read a poem to him once and wanted me to recite it. Hecued me with a few words of it, and I recalled having read to him some poems ofJuan Ramon Jimenez. The particular one he had in mind was entitled 'El ViajeDefinitivo' (The Definitive Journey).I recited it. ...and I will leave. But the birds will stay, singing:and my garden will stay, with its green tree,with its water well. Many afternoons the skies will be blue and placid,and the bells in the belfry will chime,as they are chiming this very afternoon. The people who have loved me will pass away,and the town will burst anew every year. But my spirit will always wander nostalgicin the same recondite corner of my flowery garden. \"That is the feeling Genaro is talking about,\" don Juan said. \"In order to be asorcerer a man must be passionate. A passionate man has earthly belongings andthings dear to him- if nothing else, just the path where he walks.\"What Genaro told you in his story is precisely that. Genaro left his passion inIxtlan: his home, his people, all the things he cared for. And now he wandersaround in his feelings; and sometimes, as he says, he almost reaches Ixtlan. Allof us have that in common. For Genaro it is Ixtlan; for you it will be LosAngeles; for me...\"I did not want don Juan to tell me about himself. He paused as if he had read mymind.Genaro sighed and paraphrased the first lines of the poem.\"I left. And the birds stayed, singing.\"For an instant I sensed a wave of agony and an indescribable lonelinessengulfing the three of us. I looked at don Genaro and I knew that, being apassionate man, he must have had so many ties of the heart; so many things hecared for and left behind. I had the clear sensation that at that moment thepower of his recollection was about to landslide and that don Genaro was on theverge of weeping.I hurriedly moved my eyes away. Don Genaro's passion, his supreme loneliness,made me cry.I looked at don Juan. He was gazing at me.\"Only as a warrior can one survive the path of knowledge,\" he said. \"Because theart of a warrior is to balance the terror of being a man with the wonder ofbeing a man.\"I gazed at the two of them, each in turn. Their eyes were clear and peaceful.They had summoned a wave of overwhelming nostalgia, and when they seemed to beon the verge of exploding into passionate tears, they held back the tidal wave.For an instant I think I saw. I saw the loneliness of man as a gigantic wavewhich had been frozen in front of me, held back by the invisible wall of ametaphor.My sadness was so overwhelming that I felt euphoric. I embraced them.Don Genaro smiled and stood up. Don Juan also stood up and gently put his handon my shoulder.\"We are going to leave you here,\" he said. \"Do what you think is proper. Theally will be waiting for you at the edge of that plain.\"He pointed to a dark valley in the distance.\"If you don't feel that this is your time yet, don't keep your appointment,\" hewent on. \"Nothing is gained by forcing the issue. If you want to survive youmust be crystal clear and deadly sure of yourself.\"Don Juan walked away without looking at me, but don Genaro turned a couple oftimes, and urged me with a wink and a movement of his head to go forward. Ilooked at them until they disappeared in the distance; and then I walked to mycar and drove away. I knew that it was not my time, yet. ~ THE END ~"}]
