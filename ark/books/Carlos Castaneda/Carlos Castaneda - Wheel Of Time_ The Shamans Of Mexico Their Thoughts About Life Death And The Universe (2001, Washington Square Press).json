Thequotations were taken directly from the explanations given to me as ananthropologist by my teacher and mentor don Juan Matus, a Yaqui Indian shamanfrom Mexico. He belonged to a lineage of shamans that traced its origins all theway back to the shamans who lived in Mexico in ancient times.In the most effective manner he could afford, don Juan Matus ushered me into hisWorld, which was, naturally, the world of those shamans of antiquity. Don Juanwas, therefore, in a key position. He knew about the existence of another realmof reality; a realm which was neither illusory, nor the product of outbursts offantasy. For don Juan and the rest of his shaman companions- there were fifteenof them- the world of the shamans of antiquity was as real and as pragmatic asanything could be.This work started as a very simple attempt to collect a series of vignettes,sayings, and ideas from the lore of those shamans that would be interesting toread and think about. But once the work was in progress, an unforeseeable twistof direction took place: I realized that the quotations by themselves wereimbued with an extraordinary impetus. [* impetus- a force that moves somethingalong] They revealed a covert train of thought that had never been evident to mebefore. They were pointing out the direction that don Juan's explanations hadtaken over the thirteen years in which he guided me as an apprentice.Better than any type of conceptualization, the quotations revealed anunsuspected and unwavering line of action that don Juan had followed in order topromote and facilitate my entrance into his world. It became something beyond aspeculation to me that if don Juan had followed that line, this must have alsobeen the way in which his own teacher had propelled him into the world ofshamans.Don Juan Matus's line of action was his intentional attempt to pull me into whathe said was another cognitive system. By cognitive system, he meant the standarddefinition of cognition: the processes responsible for the awareness of everydaylife; processes which include memory, experience, perception, and the expert useof any given syntax. [* syntax- a systematic orderly arrangement] Don Juan'sclaim was that the shamans of ancient Mexico had indeed a different cognitivesystem than the average man's.Following all the logic and reasoning available to me as a student of the socialsciences, I had to reject his statement. I pointed out to don Juan time and timeagain that whatever he was claiming was preposterous. It was, to me, anintellectual aberration [* aberration- a state or condition markedly differentfrom the norm] at best.It took thirteen years of hard labor on his part and on mine to discombobulate[* discombobulate- be confusing or perplexing to; cause to be unable to thinkclearly] my trust in the normal system of cognition that makes the world aroundus comprehensible to us. This maneuver pushed me into a very strange state: astate of quasi-distrust in the otherwise implicit acceptance of the cognitiveprocesses of our daily world.After thirteen years of heavy onslaughts, I realized, against my very will, thatdon Juan Matus was indeed proceeding from another point of view. Therefore, theshamans of ancient Mexico must have had another system of cognition. To admitthis burned my very being. I felt like a traitor. I felt as if I were voicingthe most horrendous heresy.When he felt that he had overcome my worst resistance, don Juan drove his pointas far and as deep as he could into me, and I had to admit, withoutreservations, that in the world of shamans, shaman practitioners judged theworld from points of view which were indescribable to our conceptualizationdevices. For instance, they perceived energy as it flowed freely in theuniverse, energy free from the bindings of socialization and syntax; purevibratory energy. They called this act seeing.Don Juan's prime objective was to help me to perceive energy as it flows in theuniverse. In the world of shamans, to perceive energy in such a manner is thefirst mandatory step toward a more engulfing, freer view of a differentcognitive system. In order to elicit a seeing response in me, don Juan utilizedother foreign units of cognition.One of the most important units, he called the recapitulation, which consistedof a systematic scrutiny of one's life, segment by segment; an examination madenot in the light of criticism or finding flaw, but in the light of an effort tounderstand one's life, and to change its course. Don Juan's claim was that onceany practitioner has viewed his life in the detached manner that therecapitulation requires, there's no way to go back to the same life.To see energy as it flows in the universe meant, to don Juan, the capacity tosee a human being as a luminous egg or luminous ball of energy, and to be ableto distinguish, in that luminous ball of energy, certain features shared by menin common, such as a point of brilliance in the already brilliant luminous ballof energy. The claim of shamans was that it was on that point of brilliance,which those shamans called the assemblage point, that perception was assembled.They could extend this thought logically to mean that it was on that point ofbrilliance that our cognition of the world was manufactured. Odd as it may seem,don Juan Matus was right in the sense that this is exactly what happens.The perception of shamans, therefore, was subject to a different process thanthe perception of average men. Shamans claimed that perceiving energy directlyled them to what they called energetic facts. By energetic fact, they meant aview obtained by seeing energy directly that led to conclusions that were finaland irreducible. These facts couldn't be tampered with by speculation, or bytrying to fit them into our standard system of interpretation.Don Juan said that for the shamans of his lineage, it was an energetic fact thatthe world around us is defined by the processes of cognition, and thoseprocesses are not unalterable: they are learned, not givens. They are a matterof training, a matter of practicality and usage. This thought was extendedfurther, to another energetic fact: the processes of standard cognition are theproduct of our upbringing, no more than that.Don Juan Matus knew, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that whatever he was tellingme about the cognitive system of the shamans of ancient Mexico was a reality.Don Juan was among other things, a nagual, which meant, for shamanpractitioners, a natural leader; a person who was capable of viewing energeticfacts without detriment to his well-being. He was, therefore, capacitated tolead his fellow men successfully into avenues of thought and perceptionimpossible to describe.Considering all the facts that don Juan had taught me about his cognitive world,I arrived at the conclusion, which was the conclusion that he himself shared,that the most important unit of such a world was the idea of intent. For theshamans of ancient Mexico, Intent was a force they could visualize when they sawenergy as it flows in the universe. They considered it an all-pervasive forcethat intervened in every aspect of time and space. It was the impetus behindeverything; but what was of inconceivable value to those shamans was thatintent- a pure abstraction- was intimately attached to man. Man could alwaysmanipulate it. The shamans of ancient Mexico realized that the only way toaffect this force was through impeccable behavior. Only the most disciplinedpractitioner could attempt this feat.Another stupendous unit of that strange cognitive system was the shamans'understanding and usage of the concepts of time and space. For them, time andspace were not the same phenomena that form part of our lives by virtue of beingan integral part of our normal cognitive system. For the average man, thestandard definition of time is \"a nonspatial continuum in which events occur inapparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to thefuture.\" And space is defined as \"the infinite extension of thethree-dimensional field in which stars and galaxies exist; the universe.\"For the shamans of ancient Mexico, time was something like a thought; a thoughtthought by something unrealizable in its magnitude. The logical argument forthem was that man, being part of that thought which was thought by forcesinconceivable to his mentality, still retained a small percentage of thatthought; a percentage which under certain circumstances of extraordinarydiscipline could be redeemed.Space was, for those shamans, an abstract realm of activity. They called itinfinity, and referred to it as the sum total of all the endeavors of livingcreatures. Space was, for them, more accessible, something almost down-to-earth.It was as if they had a bigger percentage in the abstract formulation of space.According to the versions given by don Juan, the shamans of ancient Mexico neverregarded time and space as obscure abstracts the way we do. For them, both timeand space, although incomprehensible in their formulations, were an integralpart of man.Those shamans had another cognitive unit called the wheel of time. The way theyexplained the wheel of time was to say that time was like a tunnel of infinitelength and width, a tunnel with reflective furrows. Every furrow was infinite,and there were infinite numbers of them. Living creatures were compulsorilymade, by the force of life, to gaze into one furrow. To gaze into one furrowalone meant to be trapped by it; to live that furrow.A warrior's final aim is to focus, through an act of profound discipline, hisunwavering attention on the wheel of time in order to make it turn. Warriors whohave succeeded in turning the wheel of time can gaze into any furrow and drawfrom it whatever they desire. To be free from the spellbinding force of gazinginto only one of those furrows means that warriors can look in either direction:as time retreats or as it advances on them.Viewed in this manner, the wheel of time is an overpowering influence whichreaches through the life of the warrior and beyond, as is the case with thequotations of this book. They seem to be strung together by a coil that has alife of its own. That coil, explained by the cognition of shamans, is the wheelof time.Under the impact of the wheel of time, the aim of this book became, then,something that had not been part of my original plan. The quotations became theruling factor by themselves and in themselves, and the drive imposed on me bythem was one of staying as close as I possibly could to the spirit in which thequotations were given. They were given in the spirit of frugality and ultimatedirectness.Another thing that I tried unsuccessfully to do with the quotations was toorganize them into a series of categories that would make reading them easier.However, the categorization of the quotations became untenable. [* untenable-theories incapable of being defended or justified] There was no way of settingarbitrary categories of meaning that suited me personally to something soamorphous and so vast as a total cognitive world.The only thing that could be done was to follow the quotations, and let themcreate a sketch of the skeletal form of the thoughts and feelings that theshamans of ancient Mexico had about life, death, the universe, energy. They arereflections of how those shamans understood not only the universe, but theprocesses of living and coexisting in our world. And more important yet, theypoint out the possibility of handling two systems of cognition at once withoutany detriment to the self.================================================================= Quotations from \"The Teachings of Don Juan\" Power rests on the kind of knowledge that we hold.What is the sense of knowing useless things that will not prepare us for ourunavoidable encounter with the unknown? Nothing in this world is a gift. Whatever has to be learned must be learned thehard way. A person wisely goes to knowledge as he goes to war: wide-awake, with fear, withrespect, and with absolute assurance.Going to knowledge or going to war in any other manner is a mistake. Whoevermakes that mistake- if he or she lives through it- will regret the error.When we have fulfilled all four of these requisites- to be wide awake, to havefear, respect, and absolute assurance- there are no mistakes for which we willhave to account; under such conditions our actions lose the blundering qualityof the acts of a fool.If we fail or suffers a defeat, we will have lost only a battle, and there willbe no pitiful regrets over that. Dwelling upon the self too much produces a terrible fatigue. A person in thatposition is deaf and blind to everything else, and the fatigue itself makes uscease to see the marvels all around us. Every time we set ourselves to learn, we have to labor as hard as anyone can.The limits of our learning will be determined by our nature.Fear of knowledge is natural. All of us experience it. There is nothing we cando to avoid it. Yet no matter how frightening learning is, it is more terribleto think of us without knowledge. To be angry at people means that one considers their acts to be important. It isimperative to cease to feel that way. The acts of others cannot be importantenough to offset our only viable alternative before our unavoidable encounterwith infinity. Anything is one of a million paths. Therefore, as warriors we must always keepin mind that a path is only a path. If we feel that we should not follow it, wemust not stay with it under any conditions.Our decision to keep on a path or to leave it must be free of fear or ambition.We must look at every path closely and deliberately. There is a question that awarrior has to ask, mandatory: Does this path have a heart? All paths are the same. They lead nowhere. A path without a heart is neverenjoyable.On the other hand, a path with heart is easy: It does not make a warrior work atliking it. As long as a man follows a path with heart, he is one with it. I had the vanity to believe that I live in two worlds of men, but that was onlymy vanity. There is but one single world for us as men. We are men, and we mustfollow the world of men contentedly.Yet there is a world of happiness where there is no difference between thingsbecause there is no one there to ask about the difference. I have seen thatworld, but that is not the world of men. A man has four natural enemies: fear. clarity, power, and old age. Fear,clarity, and power can be overcome, but not old age. Its effect can bepostponed, but it can never be overcome.---------------------------------------------------- Commentary on \"The Teachings of Don Juan\"The essence of whatever don Juan said at the beginning of my apprenticeship isencapsulated in the abstract nature of the quotations selected from the firstbook, The Teachings of Don Juan. At the time of the events described in thatbook, don Juan spoke a great deal about allies, power plants, Mescalito, thelittle smoke, the wind, the spirits of rivers and mountains, the spirit of thechaparral, etc., etc. Later on when I questioned him about his emphasis on thoseelements, and why he wasn't using them anymore, he admitted unabashedly that atthe beginning of my apprenticeship, he had gone into all that pseudo-Indianshaman rigmarole for my benefit.I was flabbergasted. I wondered how he could make such a statement which I feltwas obviously not true. Yet he had really meant what he said about thoseelements of his world, and I was certainly the man who could attest to theveracity [* veracity- unwillingness to tell lies] of his words and moods.\"Don't take it so seriously,\" he said, laughing. \"It was very enjoyable for meto get into all that crap, and it was even more enjoyable because I knew that Iwas doing it for your benefit.\"\"For my benefit, don Juan? What kind of aberration [* aberration- a state orcondition markedly different from the norm] is this?\"\"Yes, for your benefit. I tricked you by holding your attention on items of yourworld which held a profound fascination for you, and you swallowed it hook, lineand sinker.\"All I needed was to get your undivided attention. But how could I have donethat when you had such an undisciplined spirit? You yourself told me time andtime again that you stayed with me because you found what I said about the worldfascinating.\"What you didn't know how to express was that the fascination that you felt wasbased on the fact that you vaguely recognized every element I was talking about.You thought that the vagueness was, of course, shamanism, and you went for it,meaning you stayed.\"\"Do you do this to everybody, don Juan?\"\"Not to everybody because not everybody comes to me, and above all, I'm notinterested in everybody. I was and I am interested in you; you alone.\"My teacher, the nagual Julian, tricked me in a similar way. He tricked me withmy sensuality and greed. He promised to get me all the beautiful women whosurrounded him, and he promised to cover me with gold. He promised me a fortune,and I fell for it.\"All the shamans of my lineage had been tricked that way since time immemorial.The shamans of my lineage are not teachers or gurus. They don't give a fig aboutteaching their knowledge. They want heirs to their knowledge, not people vaguelyinterested in their knowledge for intellectual reasons.\"Don Juan was right when he said that I had fallen for his maneuver fully. I hadbelieved that I had found the perfect shaman anthropological informant.This was the time when under don Juan's auspices, and due to his influence, Iwrote diaries and collected old maps that showed the locations of the YaquiIndian towns throughout the centuries beginning with the chronicles of theJesuits in the late 1700's. I recorded all those locations and I identified themost subtle changes, and began to ponder and wonder why the towns were shiftedto other locales, and why they were arranged in slightly different patternsevery time they were relocated. Pseudo-speculations about the reasons, andreasonable doubts overwhelmed me. I collected thousands of sheets of abbreviatednotes and possibilities, drawn from books and chronicles. I was a perfectstudent of anthropology. Don Juan spurred my fancy in every way he possiblycould.There are no volunteers on the warriors' path,\" don Juan said to me under theguise of an explanation. \"A man has to be forced into the warriors' path againsthis will.\"\"What do I do, don Juan, with the thousands of notes that you tricked me intocollecting?\" I asked him at the time.His answer was a direct shock to me. \"Write a book about them!\" he said. \"I amsure that if you begin to write it, you'll never make use of those notes,anyway. They are useless, but who am I to tell you that? Find out for yourself.But don't endeavor to write a book as a writer. Endeavor to do it as a warrior;as a shaman-warrior.\"\"What do you mean by that, don Juan?\"\"I don't know,\" he said. \"Find it out for yourself.\"He was absolutely right. I never used those notes. Instead I found myselfwriting unwittingly about the inconceivable possibilities of the existence ofanother system of cognition. ================================================================= Quotations from \"A Separate Reality\" A warrior knows that he is only a man. His only regret is that his life is soshort that he can't grab onto all the things that he would like to. But for him,this is not an issue: It's only a pity. Feeling important makes one heavy, clumsy and vain. To be a warrior one needs tobe light and fluid. When they are seen as fields of energy, human beings appear to be like fibers oflight; like white cobwebs; very fine threads that circulate from the head to thetoes. Thus to the eye of a seer, a person looks like an egg of circulatingfibers. Arms and legs are like luminous bristles bursting out in all directions. The seer sees that every man is in touch with everything else, not through hishands, but through a bunch of long fibers that shoot out in all directions fromthe center of his abdomen. Those fibers join a man to his surroundings: Theykeep his balance: They give him stability. When a warrior learns to see, he sees that a human being is a luminous eggwhether a beggar or a king. There is no way to change anything; or rather, whatcould be changed in that luminous egg? What? A warrior never worries about his fear. Instead, he thinks about the wonders ofseeing the flow of energy! The rest is frills, unimportant frills. Only a crackpot would undertake the task of becoming a man of knowledge of hisown accord. A sober-headed man has to be tricked into doing it. There are scoresof people who would gladly undertake the task, but those don't count. They areusually cracked. They are like gourds that look fine from the outside and yetthey would leak the minute you put pressure on them; the minute you filled themwith water. When a man is not concerned with seeing, things look very much the same to himevery time he looks at the world. When he learns to see, on the other hand,nothing is ever the same every time he sees it, and yet it is the same.To the eye of a seer, a man is like an egg. Every time he sees the same man hesees a luminous egg, yet it is not the same luminous egg. The shamans of ancient Mexico gave the name 'allies' to inexplicable forces thatacted upon them. They called them allies because they thought they could usethem to their hearts' content. That notion nearly proved fatal to those shamansbecause what they called an ally is a being without corporeal essence thatexists in the universe. Modern-day shamans call them inorganic beings. To ask what function the allies have is like asking what we men do in the world.We are here: That's all. The allies are here like us, and maybe they were herebefore us. The most effective way to live is as a warrior. A warrior may worry and thinkbefore making any decision, but once he makes it, he goes on his way free fromworries or thoughts knowing there will be a million other decisions stillawaiting him. That's the warriors' way. Warriors thinks of our death when things become unclear. The idea of death isthe only thing that tempers our spirit. Death is everywhere. It may be the headlights of a car on a hilltop in thedistance behind. They may remain visible for a while, and disappear into thedarkness as if they had been scooped away; only to appear on another hilltop,and then disappear again. Those are the lights on the head of death. Death putsthem on like a hat and then shoots off on a gallop, gaining on us, gettingcloser and closer. Sometimes it turns off its lights. But death never stops. A warrior must know first that his acts are useless, and yet, he must proceed asif he didn't know it. That's a shaman's controlled Folly. The eyes of man can perform two functions: one is seeing energy at large as itflows in the universe and the other is \"looking at things in this world.\"Neither of these functions is better than the other; however to train the eyesonly to look is a shameful and unnecessary loss. A warrior lives by acting, not by thinking about acting, nor by thinking aboutwhat he will think when he has finished acting. A warrior chooses a path with heart, any path with heart, and follows it; andthen he rejoices and laughs. He knows, because he sees, that his life will beover altogether too soon. He sees that nothing is more important than anythingelse. A warrior has no honor, no dignity, no family, no name, no country: He has onlylife to be lived. Under these circumstances, his only tie to his fellow men ishis controlled folly. Nothing being more important than anything else, a warrior chooses any act, andacts it out as if it mattered to him. His controlled folly makes him say thatwhat he does matters and makes him act as if it did, and yet he knows that itdoesn't. So when he fulfills his acts, he retreats in peace. Whether his actswere good or bad, or worked or didn't, is in no way part of his concern. A warrior may also choose to remain totally impassive and never act, and behaveas if being impassive really mattered to him. He would be rightfully true atthat too, because that would also be his controlled folly. There's no emptiness in the life of a warrior. Everything is filled to the brim,and everything is equal. An average man is too concerned with liking people or with being liked himself.A warrior likes, that's all. He likes whatever or whomever he wants, for thehell of it. A warrior takes responsibility for his acts; for the most trivial of his acts.An average man acts out his thoughts, and never takes responsibility for what hedoes. The average man is either victorious or defeated and, depending on that, hebecomes a persecutor or a victim. These two conditions are prevalent as long asone does not see. Seeing dispels the illusion of victory, or defeat, orsuffering. A warrior knows that he is waiting and what he is waiting for; and while hewaits he wants nothing, and thus whatever little thing he gets is more than hecan take.If he needs to eat, he finds a way because he is not hungry. If something hurtshis body, he finds a way to stop it because he is not in pain. To be hungry orto be in pain means that the man is not a warrior; and the forces of his hungerand pain will destroy him. Denying oneself is an indulgence. The indulgence of denying is by far the worst.It forces us to believe that we are doing great things, when in effect we areonly fixed within ourselves. Intent is not a thought, or an object, or a wish. Intent is what can make a mansucceed when his thoughts tell him that he is defeated. It operates independentof any warrior's indulgence. Intent is what makes him invulnerable. Intent iswhat sends a shaman through a wall, through space, to infinity. When a man embarks on the warriors' path he becomes aware, in a gradual manner,that ordinary life has been left forever behind. The means of the ordinary worldare no longer a buffer for him; and he must adopt a new way of life if he isgoing to survive. Every bit of knowledge that becomes power has death as its central force. Deathlends the ultimate touch, and whatever is touched by death indeed becomes power. Only the idea of death makes a warrior sufficiently detached so that he iscapable of abandoning himself to anything. He knows his death is stalking himand won't give him time to cling to anything, so he tries, without craving, allof everything. We are men and our lot is to learn and to be hurled into inconceivable newworlds. A warrior who sees energy knows that there is no end to the new worldsfor our experiencing. Don Juan told me, \"Death is a twirl; death is a shiny cloud over the horizon;death is me talking to you; death is you and your writing pad; death is nothing.Nothing! It is here, yet it isn't here at all.\" The spirit of a warrior is not geared to indulging and complaining, nor is itgeared to winning or losing. The spirit of a warrior is geared only to struggle,and every struggle is a warrior's last battle on earth. Thus the outcome mattersvery little to him. In his last battle on earth a warrior lets his spirit flowfree and clear. And as he wages his battle, knowing that his intent isimpeccable, a warrior laughs and laughs. We talk to ourselves incessantly about our world. In fact we maintain our worldwith our internal talk. And whenever we finish talking to ourselves aboutourselves and our world, the world is always as it should be. We renew it, werekindle it with life, we uphold it with our internal talk. Not only that, butwe also choose our paths as we talk to ourselves. Thus we repeat the samechoices over and over until the day we die because we keep on repeating the sameinternal talk over and over until the day we die.A warrior is aware of this and strives to stop his internal talk. The world is all that is encased here: life, death, people, and everything elsethat surrounds us. The world is incomprehensible. We won't ever understand it.We won't ever unravel its secrets. Thus we must treat the world as it is: asheer mystery. The things that people do cannot under any conditions be more important than theworld. And thus a warrior treats the world as an endless mystery and what peopledo as an endless folly. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commentary on \"A Separate Reality\"In the quotations drawn from A Separate Reality, the mood that the shamans ofancient Mexico affixed to all their intentional endeavors begins to show withremarkable clarity. Don Juan himself pointed out to me in talking about thoseold shamans that the aspect of their world which was of supreme interest tomodern practitioners was the razor-sharp awareness that those shamans haddeveloped about the universal force they called intent. They explained that thelink each of those men had with such a force was so neat and clean that theycould affect things to their hearts' content.Don Juan said that the intent of those shamans, developed to such a keenintensity, was the only aid modern practitioners had. He put it in more mundaneterms, and said that modern-day practitioners, if they were honest withthemselves, would pay whatever price to live under the umbrella of such anintent.Don Juan asserted that anyone who showed even the slightest interest in theworld of the shamans of antiquity was immediately drawn into the circle of theirrazor-sharp intent. Their intent was, for don Juan, something incommensurable [*incommensurable- impossible to measure or compare in value or size orexcellence] that none of us could successfully fight away. Besides, he reasoned,there was no necessity to fight away such an intent because it was the onlything that counted. It was the essence of the world of those shamans and theworld which modern-day practitioners coveted more than anything imaginable.The mood of the quotations from A Separate Reality is not something that Iarranged on purpose. It is a mood that surfaced independent of my aims andwishes. I could even say that it was contrary to what I had in mind. It was themysterious coil of the wheel of time hidden in the text of the book that hadsuddenly been activated, and it snapped into a state of tension; a tension thatdictated the direction of my endeavors.At the time of writing A Separate Reality, as far as my feelings about my workwere concerned, I could truthfully assert that I thought that I was happilyinvolved in doing anthropological fieldwork. My feelings and thoughts were asfar away from the world of the shamans of antiquity as anything could be.Don Juan had a different opinion. Being a seasoned warrior, he knew that Icouldn't possibly extricate myself from the magnetic pull that the intent ofthose shamans had created. I was drowning in it, whether or not I believed in itor wished for it. This state of affairs brought about a subliminal anxiety on mypart. It was not an anxiety I could define or pinpoint, or was even aware of. Itpermeated my acts without the possibility of my consciously dwelling on it, orseeking an explanation. In retrospect, I can only say that I was deadly afraid,although I couldn't determine what I was afraid of.I tried many times to analyze this sensation of fear, but I would immediatelyget fatigued;, bored. I would instantaneously find my inquiry groundless,superfluous, and I would end up abandoning it. I asked don Juan about my stateof being. I wanted his advice, his input.\"You are just afraid,\" he said. That's all there is to it. Don't look formysterious reasons for your fear. The mysterious reason is right here in frontof you within your reach. It is the intent of the shamans of ancient Mexico. Youare dealing with their world, and that world shows its face to you from time totime. Of course, you can't take that sight. Neither could I, in my time. Neithercould any one of us.\"\"You're talking in riddles, don Juan!\"\"Yes, I am, for the moment. It will be clear to you someday. At the present,it's idiotic to try to talk about it, or explain anything. Nothing of what I'mtrying to show you would make sense. Some inconceivable banality would makeinfinitely more sense to you at this moment.\"He was absolutely right. All my fears were triggered by some banality of which Iwas ashamed at the time, and am ashamed of now. I was afraid of demoniacalpossession. Such a fear had been encrusted in me very early in life. Anythingthat was inexplicable was naturally something evil; something malignant thataimed at destroying me.The more poignant don Juan's explanations of the world of the ancient shamansbecame, the greater my sensation of needing to protect myself. This sensationwas not something that could be verbalized. It was, rather than the need toprotect the self; the need to protect the veracity and the undeniable value ofthe world in which we human beings live.To me, my world was the only recognizable world. If it was threatened, there wasan immediate reaction on my part; a reaction that manifested itself in somequality of fear that I will be forever at a loss to explain: This fear wassomething one must feel in order to grasp its immensity. It was not the fear ofdying or of being hurt. It was, rather, something immeasurably deeper than that.It was so deep that any shaman practitioner would be at a loss trying even toconceptualize it.\"You have come, in a roundabout way, to stand directly in front of the warrior,\"don Juan said.At that time, he emphasized to no end the concept of the warrior. He said thatthe warrior was of course, much more than a mere concept. It was a way of life,and that way of life would be the only deterrent to fear, and the only channelwhich a practitioner could use to let the flow of his activity move on freely.Without the concept of the warrior, the stumbling blocks on the path ofknowledge were impossible to overcome.Don Juan defined the warrior as the fighter par excellence. It was a moodfacilitated by the intent of the shamans of antiquity; a mood into which any mancould enter.\"The intent of those shamans,\" don Juan said, \"was so keen- so powerful that itwould solidify the structure of the warrior in anyone who tapped it, even thoughthey might not be aware of it.\"In short, the warrior was, for the shamans of ancient Mexico, a unit of combatso tuned to the fight around him, so extraordinarily alert that in his purestform, that he needed nothing superfluous to survive.There was no necessity to make gifts to a warrior, or to prop him up with talkor actions, or to try to give him solace and incentive. All of those things wereincluded in the structure of the warrior itself. Since that structure wasdetermined by the intent of the shamans of ancient Mexico, they made sure thatanything foreseeable would be included.The end result was a fighter who fought alone, and who drew from his own silentconvictions all the impulse he needed to forge ahead; without complaints;without the necessity to be praised.Personally, I found the concept of the warrior fascinating, and, at the sametime, one of the most frightening things I had ever encountered. I thought itwas a concept that, if I adopted it, would bind me into servitude, and wouldn'tgive me the time or the disposition to protest, examine or complain. Complaininghad been my lifelong habit, and truthfully, I would have fought tooth and nailnot to give it up. I thought that complaining was the sign of a sensitive,courageous, forthright man who has no qualms in stating his facts, his likes anddislikes. If all of that was going to turn into a fighting organism, I stood tolose more than I could afford. These were my inner thoughts.And yet, I coveted the direction, the peace, and the efficiency of the warrior.One of the great aids that the shamans of ancient Mexico employed inestablishing the concept of the warrior was the idea of taking our death as acompanion; a witness to our acts.Don Juan said that once that premise is accepted in whatever mild form, a bridgeis formed which extends across the gap between our world of daily affairs, andsomething that is in front of us, but has no name; something that is lost in afog, and doesn't seem to exist; something so terribly unclear that it cannot beused as a point of reference; and yet, it is there, undeniably present.Don Juan claimed that the only being on earth capable of crossing over thatbridge was the warrior: silent in his struggle; undetainable because he hasnothing to lose; functional and efficacious [* efficacious- marked by qualitiesgiving the power to produce an intended effect] because he has everything togain. ================================================================= Quotations from \"Journey to Ixtlan\" We hardly ever realize that we can cut anything out of our lives, anytime, inthe blink of an eye. One shouldn't worry about taking pictures or making tape recordings. Those aresuperfluities of sedate lives. One should worry about the spirit, which isalways present. Personal history must be constantly renewed by telling parents, relatives, andfriends everything one does. On the other hand, for the warrior who has nopersonal history, no explanations are needed; nobody is angry or disillusionedwith his acts. And above all, on one pins him down with their thoughts and theirexpectations. When nothing is for sure we remain alert; perennially on our toes. It is moreexciting not to know which bush the rabbit is hiding behind than to behave asthough we knew everything. As long as a man feels that he is the most important thing in the world, hecannot really appreciate the world around him. He is like a horse with blinders;all he sees is himself, apart from everything else. Death is our eternal companion. It is always to our left, an arm's length behindus. Death is the only wise adviser that a warrior has. Whenever he feels thateverything is going wrong and he's about to be annihilated, he can turn to hisdeath and ask if that is so.His death will tell him that he is wrong; that nothing really matters outsideits touch. His death will tell him, 'I haven't touched you yet.' Whenever a warrior decides to do something, he must go all the way, but he musttake responsibility for what he does. No matter what he does, he must know firstwhy he is doing it, and then he must proceed with his actions without havingdoubts or remorse about them. In a world where death is the hunter, there is no time for regrets or doubts.There is only time for decisions.It doesn't matter what the decisions are. Nothing could be more or less seriousthan anything else. In a world where death is the hunter, there are no small orbig decisions. There are only decisions that a warrior makes in the face of hisinevitable death. A warrior must learn to be available and unavailable at the precise turn of theroad. It is useless for a warrior to be unwittingly available at all times, asit is useless for him to hide when everybody knows that he is hiding. For a warrior, to be inaccessible means that he touches the world around himsparingly, then moves away. He deliberately avoids exhausting himself andothers. He doesn't use and squeeze people until they have shriveled to nothing,especially the people he loves. Once a man worries, he clings to anything out of desperation; and once he clingshe is bound to get exhausted or to exhaust whomever or whatever he is clingingto. A warrior-hunter, on the other hand, knows he will lure game into his trapsover and over again, so he doesn't worry. To worry is to become accessible;unwittingly accessible. A warrior-hunter deals intimately with his world, and yet he is inaccessible tothat same world. He taps it lightly, stays for as long as he needs to, and thenswiftly moves away, leaving hardly a mark. To be a warrior-hunter is not just to trap game. A warrior-hunter does not catchgame because he sets his traps, or because he knows the routines of his prey,but because he himself has no routines. This is his advantage. He is not at alllike the animals he is after. They are fixed by heavy routines and predictablequirks. He is free, fluid, and unpredictable. For an average man, the world is weird because if he's not bored with it, he'sat odds with it. For a warrior, the world is weird because it is stupendous,awesome, mysterious, and unfathomable. A warrior assumes responsibility forbeing here in this marvelous world in this marvelous time. A warrior must learn to make every act count, since he is going to be here inthis world for only a short while, in fact, too short for witnessing all themarvels of it. Acts have power. Especially when the warrior acting knows that those acts arehis last battle. There is a strange consuming happiness in acting with the fullknowledge that whatever he is doing may very well be his last act on earth. A warrior focuses his attention on the link between himself and his death.Without remorse or sadness or worrying, he focuses his attention on the factthat he does not have time and let his acts flow accordingly. He lets each ofhis acts be his last battle on earth. Under those conditions, his acts havetheir rightful power.Otherwise his acts would be, for as long as he lives, the acts of a fool. A warrior-hunter knows that his death is waiting, and the very act he isperforming now may well be his last battle on earth. He calls it a battlebecause it is a struggle.Most people move from act to act without any struggle or thought.A warrior-hunter, on the contrary, assesses every act. He has an intimateawareness of his death, so he proceeds judiciously as if every act were his lastbattle.Only a fool would fail to notice the advantage a warrior-hunter has over hisfellow men.A warrior-hunter gives his last battle its due respect. It's only natural thathis last act on earth should be the best of himself. It's pleasurable that way.It dulls the edge of his fright. A warrior is an immaculate hunter who hunts power. He's not drunk or crazed, andhe has neither the time nor the disposition to bluff or to lie to himself; or tomake a wrong move. The stakes are too high for that. The stakes are his trimmedorderly life which he has taken so long to tighten and perfect. He is not goingto throw that away by making some stupid miscalculation; by mistaking somethingfor something else. A man, any man, deserves everything that is a man's lot: joy, pain, sadness, andstruggle.The nature of his acts is unimportant as long as he acts as a warrior. If hisspirit is distorted he should simply fix it- purge it, make it perfect- becausethere is no other task in our entire lives which is more worthwhile. Not to fixthe spirit is to seek death, and that is the same as to seek nothing, sincedeath is going to overtake us regardless of anything.To seek the perfection of the warrior's spirit is the only task worthy of ourtemporariness, and our manhood. The hardest thing in the world is to assume the mood of a warrior. It is of nouse to be sad and complain and feel justified in doing so; believing thatsomeone is always doing something to us.Nobody is doing anything to anybody, much less to a warrior. A warrior is a hunter. He calculates everything. That's control. Once hiscalculations are over, he acts. He lets go. That's abandon.A warrior is not a leaf at the mercy of the wind. No one can push him. No onecan make him do things against himself or against his better judgment. A warrioris tuned to survive, and he survives in the best of all possible fashions. A warrior is only a man; a humble man. He cannot change the designs of hisdeath. But his impeccable spirit, which has stored power after stupendoushardships, can certainly hold his death for a moment; a moment long enough tolet him rejoice for the last time in recalling his power. We may say that thatis a gesture which death has with those who have an impeccable spirit. It doesn't matter how one was brought up. What determines the way one doesanything is personal power. A man is only the sum of his personal power, andthat sum determines how he lives and how he dies. Personal power is a feeling. Something like being lucky. Or one may call it amood. Personal power is something that one acquires by means of a lifetime ofstruggle. A warrior acts as if he knows what he is doing, when in effect he knows nothing. A warrior doesn't know remorse for anything he has done because to isolate one'sacts as being mean, or ugly, or evil is to place an unwarranted importance onthe self.The trick is in what one emphasizes. We either make ourselves miserable, or wemake ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same. People tell us from the time we are born that the world is such and such and soand so, and naturally we have no choice but to accept that the world is the waypeople have been telling us it is. The art of a warrior is to balance the terror of being a man with the wonder ofbeing a man. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commentary on \"Journey to Ixtlan\"By the time I was writing Journey to Ixtlan, a most mysterious mood wasprevalent all around me. Don Juan Matus was applying some extremely pragmaticmeasures to my daily conduct. He had outlined some steps of action that hewanted me to follow rigorously. He had given me three tasks which had only thevaguest references to my world of everyday life, or to any other world.He wanted me to endeavor in my daily world to erase my personal history by anymeans conceivable. Then, he wanted me to stop my routines, and finally, hewanted me to dethrone my sense of self-importance.\"How am I going to accomplish all this, don Juan?\" I asked him.\"I have no idea,\" he responded. \"None of us has any idea of how to do thatpragmatically and effectively. Yet, if we start the work, we will accomplish itwithout ever knowing what came to aid us.The difficulty that you encounter is the same difficulty that I encounteredmyself,\" he went on. \"I assure you that our difficulty is born out of the totalabsence in our lives of the idea that would spur us to change.\"At the time that my teacher gave me this task, all I needed in order to make itwork was the idea that it could be done. Once I had the idea, I accomplished it,without knowing how. I recommend that you do the same.\"I went into the most contorted complaints, alluding to the fact that I was asocial scientist accustomed to practical directions that had substance to them;not to something vague which was dependent on magical solutions rather thanpractical means.\"Say whatever you want,\" don Juan responded, laughing. \"Once you're throughcomplaining, forget about your qualms and do what I have asked you to do.\"Don Juan was right. All that I needed, or rather, all that a mysterious part ofme which was not overt needed, was the idea. The 'me' that I had known throughall my life needed infinitely more than the idea. It needed coaching, spurring,direction. I became so intrigued by my success that the tasks of erasing myroutines, losing my self-importance and dropping my personal history became asheer delight.\"You are smack in front of the warriors' way,\" don Juan said by way ofexplanation for my mysterious success.Slowly and methodically, he had guided my awareness to focus more and moreintensely on an abstract elaboration of the concept of the warrior that hecalled the warriors' way; the warriors' path. He explained that the warriors'way was a structure of ideas established by the shamans of ancient Mexico.Those shamans had derived their construct by means of their ability to seeenergy as it flows freely in the universe. Therefore, the warriors' way was amost harmonious conglomerate of energetic facts; irreducible truths determinedexclusively by the direction of the flow of energy in the universe.Don Juan categorically stated that there was nothing about the warriors' waythat could be argued; nothing that could be changed. It was in itself and byitself a perfect structure, and whoever followed it was corralled by energeticfacts that admitted no argument: no speculation about their function and theirvalue.Don Juan said that those old shamans called it the warriors' way because itsstructure encompassed all the living possibilities that a warrior mightencounter on the path of knowledge. Those shamans were absolutely thorough andmethodical in their search for such possibilities. According to don Juan, theywere indeed capable of including in their abstract structure everything that ishumanly possible.Don Juan compared the warriors' way to an edifice, [* edifice- a structure thathas a roof and walls and stands more or less permanently in one place] with eachof the elements of this edifice being a propping device whose only function wasto sustain the psyche of the warrior in his role of shaman initiate, in order tomake his movements easy and meaningful. He stated unequivocally that thewarriors' way was the essential construct without which shaman initiates wouldbe shipwrecked in the immensity of the universe.Don Juan called the warriors' way the crowning glory of the shamans of ancientMexico. He viewed it as their most important contribution; the essence of theirsobriety.\"Is the warriors' way that overwhelmingly important, don Juan?\" I asked himonce.\"'Overwhelmingly important' is a euphemism. The warriors' way is everything. Itis the epitome of mental and physical health. I cannot explain it in any otherway. For the shamans of ancient Mexico to have created such a structure means tome that they were at the height of their power; the peak of their happiness; theapex of their joy.\"On the level of pragmatic acceptance or rejection in which I thought I wassubmerged at the time, to embrace the warriors' path thoroughly and unbiasedlywas nothing short of an impossibility for me. The more don Juan explained thewarriors' path, the more intense the sensation I had that he was indeed plottingto overthrow all my balance.Don Juan's guidance was, therefore, covert. It manifested itself with stupendousclarity, however, in the quotations drawn from Journey to Ixtlan. Don Juan hadadvanced on me in leaps and bounds at tremendous speed, without my being awareof it, and was suddenly breathing down my neck. I thought time and time againthat I was either on the verge of accepting, in a bona fide manner, theexistence of another cognitive system, or I was so thoroughly indifferent that Ididn't care whether it happened one way or the other.Of course, there was always the option of running away from all that, but itwasn't tenable. Somehow, don Juan's ministrations, or my heavy use of theconcept of the warrior had hardened me to the point that I was no longer thatafraid. I was caught, but really, it made no difference. All I knew was that Iwas there with don Juan for the duration. ================================================================= Quotations from \"Tales of Power\" The self-confidence of the warrior is not the self-confidence of the averageman. The average man seeks certainty in the eyes of the onlooker and calls thatself-confidence. The warrior seeks impeccability in his own eyes and calls thathumbleness. The average man is hooked to his fellow men, while the warrior ishooked only to infinity. There are lots of things a warrior can do at a certain time which he couldn't doyears before. Those things themselves did not change; what changed was his ideaof himself. The only possible course that a warrior has is to act consistently and withoutreservations. At a certain moment, he knows enough of the warriors' way to actaccordingly, but his old habits and routines may stand in his way. If a warrior is to succeed in anything, the success must come gently, with agreat deal of effort but with no stress or obsession. The internal dialogue is what grounds people in the daily world. The world issuch and such or so and so, only because we talk to ourselves about its beingsuch and such or so and so. The passageway into the world of shamans opens upafter the warrior has learned to shut off his internal dialogue. To change our idea of the world is the crux of shamanism. And stopping theinternal dialogue is the only way to accomplish it. When a warrior learns to stop the internal dialogue, everything becomespossible; the most far-fetched schemes become attainable. A warrior takes his lot, whatever it may be, and accepts it in ultimatehumbleness. He accepts in humbleness what he is, not as grounds for regret butas a living challenge. The humbleness of a warrior is not the humbleness of the beggar.The beggar falls to his knees at the drop of a hat, and scrapes the floor foranyone he deems to be higher; but at the same time, he demands that someonelower than him scrape the floor for him.On the other hand, the warrior lowers his head to no one, and at the same time,he doesn't permit anyone to lower his head to him. Solace, haven, fear: All of these are words which have created moods that we hadlearned to accept without ever questioning their value. Our fellow men are black magicians, and whoever is with them is a black magicianon the spot.Think for a moment. Can you deviate from the path that your fellow men havelined up for you? If you remain with them, your thoughts and your actions arefixed forever in their terms. That is slavery.The warrior, on the other hand, is free from all that. Freedom is expensive, butthe price is not impossible to pay. So, fear your captors; your masters. Don'twaste your time and your power fearing freedom. The flaw with words is that they always make us feel enlightened, but when weturn around to face the world they always fail us and we end up facing the worldas we always have, without enlightenment.For this reason, a warrior seeks to act rather than to talk. As a result, hegets a new description of the world- a new description where talking is not thatimportant, and where new acts have new reflections. A warrior considers himself already dead, so there is nothing for him to lose.The worst has already happened to him. Therefore he's clear and calm. Judginghim by his acts or by his words, one would never suspect that he has witnessedeverything. Knowledge is a most peculiar affair, especially for a warrior. Knowledge for awarrior is something that comes at once, engulfs him, and passes on. Knowledge comes to a warrior, it might be descrived, floating like specks ofgold dust; the same dust that covers the wings of moths. So for a warrior,knowledge is like being rained on by specks of golden dust. Whenever the internal dialogue stops, the world collapses, and extraordinaryfacets of ourselves surface as though they had been kept heavily guarded by ourwords. The world is unfathomable; as are we; as is every being that exists in theworld. Warriors do not win victories by beating their heads against walls, but byovertaking the walls. Warriors jump over walls: They don't demolish them. A warrior must cultivate the feeling that he has everything needed for theextravagant journey that is his life. What counts for a warrior is being alive.Life in itself is sufficient, self-explanatory and complete. Therefore, one maysay without being presumptuous that the experience of experiences is beingalive. An average man thinks that indulging in doubts and tribulations is the sign ofsensitivity, and spirituality. The truth of the matter is that the average manis the farthest thing imaginable from being sensitive. His puny reasondeliberately makes itself into a monster or a saint, but it is truthfully toolittle for such a big monster or saint mold. To be a warrior is not a simple matter of wishing to be one. It is rather anendless struggle that will go on to the very last moment of our lives. Nobody isborn a warrior, in exactly the same way that nobody is born an average man. Wemake ourselves into one or the other. A warrior dies the hard way. His death must struggle to take him. A warrior doesnot give himself to death so easily. Human beings are not objects. They have no solidity. They are round, luminousbeings. They are boundless. The world of objects and solidity is only adescription that was created to help them to make their passage on earthconvenient.Human beings' reason makes them forget that the description is only adescription, and before they realize it, human beings have entrapped thetotality of themselves in a vicious circle from which they rarely emerge intheir lifetimes. Human beings are perceivers, but the world that they perceive is an illusion: anillusion created by the description that was told to them from the moment theywere born. So in essence, the world that their reason wants to sustain is the world createdby a description and its dogmatic and inviolable rules, which their reasonlearns to accept and defend. Our concealed treasure as luminous beings is that we have something which isalmost never used: intent.The maneuver of shamans is similar to the maneuver of the average man. Both havea description of the world. The average man upholds it with his reason and theshaman upholds it with his intent. Both descriptions have their rules, but theadvantage of the shaman is that intent is more engulfing than reason. Only as a warrior can one withstand the path of knowledge. A warrior cannotcomplain or regret anything. His life is an endless challenge, and challengescannot possibly be considered as good or bad. Challenges are simply challenges. The basic difference between an ordinary man and a warrior is that a warriortakes everything as a challenge, while an ordinary man takes everything as ablessing or as a curse. The trump card of the warrior is that he believes without believing. Butobviously a warrior can't just say he believes and let it go at that. That wouldbe too easy. To just believe without any exertion would exonerate him fromexamining his situation.Whenever a warrior has to involve himself in matters of believing, he chooses.It's not that a warrior simply chooses to believes. A warrior has to believe.Having to believe in such a fashion is the warrior's expression of his innermostpredilection. Death is an indispensable ingredient in having to believe. Without the awarenessof death, we feel immortal, and everything becomes ordinary and trivial. Becauseof our awareness that death is stalking us, warriors come to see and realizethat the world is an unfathomable mystery. Power always makes a cubic centimeter of chance available to a warrior. Thewarrior's art is to be perennially fluid in order to pluck it. The average man is aware of everything only when he thinks he should be. Thecondition of a warrior, however, is to be aware of everything at all times. The totality of ourselves is a very mysterious affair. We need only a very smallportion of it to fulfill the most complex tasks of life. Yet when we die, we diewith the totality of ourselves. A rule of thumb for a warrior is that he makes his decisions so carefully thatnothing that may happen as a result of them can surprise him, much less drainhis power. When a warrior makes the decision to take action, he should be prepared to die.If he is prepared to die, there shouldn't be any pitfalls, any unwelcomesurprises, any unnecessary acts. Everything should gently fall into placebecause he is expecting nothing. A warrior, as a teacher, must first of all teach about the possibility of actingwithout believing; without expecting rewards- acting just for the hell of it.His success as a teacher depends on how well and how harmoniously he guides hiswards in this specific respect. In order to help his ward to erase personal history, the warrior as a teacherteaches three techniques: losing self-importance, assuming responsibility forone's acts, and using death as an adviser. Without the beneficial effect ofthese three techniques, erasing personal history would involve being shifty,evasive and unnecessarily dubious about oneself and one's actions. There is no way to get rid of self-pity for good: It has a definite place andcharacter in our lives; a definite facade which is recognizable. Thus, everytime the occasion arises, the facade of self-pity becomes active. It has ahistory. But if one changes the facade, one shifts its place of prominence. Onechanges facades by shifting the component elements of the facade itself.Self-pity is useful to the user because he feels important and deserving ofbetter conditions, better treatment, or because he is unwilling to assumeresponsibility for the acts that brought him to the state that elicitedself-pity. Changing the facade of self-pity means only that one has assigned a secondaryplace to a formerly important element. Self-pity is still a prominent feature,but it has now taken a position in the background.In the same fashion, the idea of one's impending death, the idea of a warrior'shumbleness, and the idea of taking responsibility for one's acts were all in thebackground at one time for a warrior without ever being used until the moment hebecame a warrior. A warrior acknowledges his pain, but he doesn't indulge in it. The mood of thewarrior who enters into the unknown is not one of sadness. On the contrary, he'sjoyful because he feels humbled by his great fortune, confident that his spiritis impeccable, and above all, is fully aware of his efficiency. A warrior'sjoyfulness comes from having accepted his fate, and from having truthfullyassessed what lies ahead of him. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commentary on \"Tales of Power\"Tales of Power is the mark of my ultimate downfall. At the time that the eventsnarrated in that book took place, I suffered a profound emotional upheaval; awarrior's breakdown. Don Juan Matus left this world, and left his fourapprentices in it. Each of those apprentices was approached personally by donJuan, and assigned a specific task. I considered the task given to me to be aplacebo that had no significance whatsoever in comparison to the loss.Not to see don Juan anymore could not be soothed by pseudo-tasks. My first pleawith don Juan had been, naturally, to tell him that I wanted to go with him.\"You are not ready, yet,\" he said. \"Let's be realistic.\"\"But I could make myself ready in the blink of an eye,\" I assured him.\"I don't doubt that. You'll be ready, but not for me. I demand perfectefficiency. I demand an impeccable intent, an impeccable discipline. You don'thave that yet. You will. You're coming to it, but you're not there yet.\"You have the power to take me, don Juan. Raw and imperfect.\"\"I suppose I do, but I won't, because it would be a shameful waste for you. Youstand to lose everything, take my word. Don't insist. Insisting is not in therealm of warriors.\"That statement was sufficient to stop me. Internally, however, I yearned to gowith him; to venture beyond the boundaries of everything that I knew as normaland real.When the moment came in which don Juan actually left the world, he turned intosome colored, vaporous luminosity. He was pure energy, flowing freely in theuniverse. My sensation of loss was so immense at that moment that I wanted todie. I disregarded everything don Juan had said, and without any hesitation, Iproceeded to throw myself off a precipice. I reasoned that if I did that, indeath, don Juan would have been obliged to take me with him, and save whateverbit of awareness was left in me.But for reasons that are inexplicable when viewed from the premises of my normalcognition, though explicable from the cognition of the shamans' world, I didn'tdie. I was left alone in the world of everyday life with my three cohorts;something which made my loneliness more poignant than ever.I saw myself as an agent provocateur, [* provocateur- a secret agent who incitessuspected persons to commit illegal acts] a spy of sorts, that don Juan had leftbehind for some obscure reasons. The quotations drawn from the corpus [* corpus-a collection of writings] of Tales of Power show the unknown quality of theworld, not the world of shamans, but the world of everyday life, which,according to don Juan, is as mysterious and rich as anything can be. All we needto pluck the wonders of this world of everyday life is enough detachment. Butmore than detachment, we need enough affection and abandon.\"A warrior must love this world,\" don Juan had warned me, \"in order for thisworld that seems so commonplace to open up and show its wonders.\"We were, at the time that he voiced this statement, in the desert of Sonora.\"It is a sublime feeling,\" he said, \"to be in this marvelous desert; to seethose ragged peaks of pseudo-mountains that were really made by the flow of lavaof long-gone volcanoes. It is a glorious feeling to find that some of thosenuggets of obsidian were created at such high temperatures that they stillretain the mark of their origin. They have power galore.\"To wander aimlessly in those ragged peaks and actually find a piece of quartzthat picks up radio waves is extraordinary. The only drawback to this marvelouspicture is that to enter into the marvels of this world, or into the marvels ofanother world, a man needs to be a warrior: calm, collected, indifferent,seasoned by the onslaughts of the unknown. You are not seasoned that way yet.Therefore, it is your duty to seek that fulfillment before you could talk aboutventuring into the infinite.\"I have spent thirty-five years of my life seeking the maturity of a warrior. Ihave gone to places that defy description seeking that sensation of beingseasoned by the onslaughts of the unknown. I went unobtrusively, unannounced,and I came back in the same fashion. The works of warriors are silent andsolitary, and when warriors go, or come back, they do it so inconspicuously thatnobody is the wiser. To seek a warrior's maturity in any other fashion would beostentatious, [* ostentatious- intended to attract notice and impress others]and therefore, inadmissible.The quotations from Tales of Power were the most poignant reminder to me thatthe intent of the shamans who lived in Mexico in ancient times was stillimpeccably at work. The wheel of time was moving inexorably around me, forcingme to look into grooves which one cannot talk about and still remain coherent.\"Suffice it to say,\" don Juan said to me once, \"that the immensity of thisworld, be it the shamans' world or the average man's, is so conspicuous thatonly an aberration could keep us from noticing it. Trying to explain to aberrantbeings what it is like to be lost in the grooves of the wheel of time is themost absurd thing that a warrior can undertake. Therefore, he makes sure thathis journeys are only the property of his condition of being a warrior.\" ================================================================ Quotations from \"The Second Ring of Power\" When one has nothing to lose, one becomes courageous. We are timid only whenthere is something we can still cling to. A warrior could not possibly leave anything to chance. He actually affects theoutcome of events by the force of his awareness and his unbending intent. If a warrior wants to pay back for all the favors he has received, and he has noone in particular to address his payment to, he can address it to the spirit ofman. That's always a very small account, and whatever one puts in it is morethan enough. After arranging the world in a most beautiful and enlightened manner, thescholar goes back home at five o'clock in the afternoon in order to forget hisbeautiful arrangement. The human form is a conglomerate of energy fields which exists in the universe,and which is related exclusively to human beings. Shamans call it the human formbecause those energy fields have been bent and contorted by a lifetime of habitsand misuse. A warrior knows that he cannot change, and yet he makes it his business to tryto change. The warrior is never disappointed when he fails to change. That's theonly advantage a warrior has over the average man. Warriors must be impeccable in their effort to change in order to scare andshake the human form away. After years of impeccability, a moment will come whenthe human form cannot stand it any longer and leaves. That is to say, a momentwill come when the energy fields contorted by a lifetime of habit arestraightened out. A warrior gets deeply affected, and can even die as a resultof this straightening out of energy fields, but an impeccable warrior alwayssurvives. The only freedom warriors have is to behave impeccably. Not only isimpeccability freedom; it is the only way to straighten out the human form. Any habit needs all its parts in order to function. If some parts are missing,the habit is disassembled. The fight is right here on this earth. We are human creatures. Who knows what'swaiting for us, or what kind of power we may have? The world of people goes up and down and people go up and down with their world;warriors have no business following the ups and downs of their fellow men. The core of our being is the act of perceiving, and the magic of our being isthe act of awareness. Perception and awareness are a single, functional,inextricable unit. We choose only once. We choose either to be warriors or to be ordinary men. Asecond choice does not exist. Not on this earth. The warriors' way offers a man a new life and that life has to be completelynew. He can't bring to that new life his ugly old ways. Warriors always take a first event of any series as the blueprint or the map ofwhat is going to develop for them subsequently. Human beings love to be told what to do, but they love even more to fight andnot do what they are told, and thus they get entangled in hating the one whotold them in the first place. Everybody has enough personal power for something. The trick for the warrior isto pull his personal power away from his weaknesses to his warrior's purpose. Everyone can see, and yet we choose not to remember what we see. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commentary on \"The Second Ring of Power\"Years went by before I wrote The Second Ring of Power. Don Juan was long gone,and the quotations from that book are memories of what he had said; memoriestriggered by a new situation, or a new development. Another player had appearedin my life. It was don Juan's cohort, Florinda Matus. All of don Juan'sapprentices understood that when don Juan left, Florinda was left behind tosomehow round up the last part of our training.\"Not until you are capable of taking orders from a woman without detriment toyour being will you be complete,\" don Juan had said. \"But that woman cannot bejust any woman. It must be somebody special, somebody who has power and aquality of ruthlessness that will not allow you to be the man-in-charge that youfancy yourself to be.\"Of course, I laughed off his statements. I thought he was definitely joking. Thetruth of the matter was that he wasn't joking at all. One day, FlorindaDonner-Grau and Taisha Abelar returned, and we went to Mexico. We went to adepartment store in the city of Guadalajara, and there, we found Florinda Matus,the most gorgeous woman I had ever seen: extremely tall- five feet eleven, lean,angular, with a beautiful face, old, and yet very young.\"Ah! There you are!\" she exclaimed, when she saw us. \"The Three Musketeers! ThePep Boys- Eenie, Meenie and Mo! I've been looking for you all over!\"And without any more to say, she took over. Florinda Donner-Grau, of course, wasdelighted beyond measure. Taisha Abelar was extremely reserved, as usual, and Iwas mortified, almost furious. I knew that the arrangement was not going towork. I was ready to clash with this woman the first time she opened her daringmouth and came up with phrases like \"Eenie, Meenie and Mo- the Pep Boys.\"Unsuspected things that I had in reserve, however, came to my aid, and preventedme from any reaction of wrath or annoyance, and I got along with Florindasuperbly better than I could have dreamed. She ruled us with an iron hand. Shewas the undisputed queen of our lives. She had the power and the detachment tocarry out her job of tuning us in the most subtle way. She didn't allow us todrown in self-pity or complaining if something was not quite to our liking. Shewas not at all like don Juan. She lacked his sobriety, but she had anotherquality that balanced her lack: she was as fast as anything could be. One glancewas sufficient for her to comprehend an entire situation, and to actinstantaneously in accordance with what was expected of her.One of her favorite ploys, which I enjoyed immensely, was to formally ask anaudience, or a group of people she was talking to, \"Does anyone here knowanything about the pressure and displacement of gases?\" She would ask such aquestion in true seriousness. And when the audience responded, \"No, no, wedon't,\" she would say, \"Then, I could say anything I want, true?!\"- and indeedshe would go ahead and say anything she wanted. She would actually sometimes saysuch ridiculous things that I would fall on the floor laughing.Her other classical question was, \"Does anyone here know anything about theretina of chimpanzees? No?\"- and Florinda would say barbarities about the retinaof chimpanzees. Never in my life had I enjoyed my time more thoroughly. I washer admirer and unbiased follower.I once had a fistula by the crest of the bone of my hip, a product of a fallthat I had taken years before into a ravine filled with cactus needles. Therehad been seventy-five needles stuck in my body. One of them either hadn't comeout completely or had left a residue of dirt or debris that years later produceda fistula.My doctor said, \"That's nothing. It is just a sack of pus that has to be lanced.It's a very simple operation. It would take a few minutes to clean it out.\"I consulted with Florinda, and she said, \"You are the nagual. You either cureyourself, or you die. No shades of meaning. No double behavior. For a nagual tobe lanced by a doctor- you must have lost your power. For a nagual to diefistulated? What a shame.\"Except for Florinda Donner-Grau and Taisha Abelar, the rest of don Juan'sapprentices didn't care at all for Florinda. She was a threatening figure. Shewas someone who never allowed them the freedom that they felt was their due. Shenever celebrated their pseudo-exploits of shamanism, and she stopped theiractivities every time they strayed from the warriors' path. In the corpus of TheSecond Ring of Power, that struggle of the apprentices is more than manifest.Don Juan's other apprentices were a lost lot, filled with egomaniacal outbursts,each one pulling in his own direction, each one asserting his or her value.Everything that took place in our lives from that time on was deeply influencedby Florinda Matus, and yet, she never took the front stand. She was always afigure in the background, wise, funny, ruthless. Florinda Donner-Grau and Ilearned to love her as we had never loved before, and when she left, she willedto Florinda Donner-Grau her name, her jewels, her money, her grace, hersavoir-faire. [* savoir-faire- social skill] I felt that I could never write abook about Florinda Matus, that if anybody ever did, it would have to beFlorinda Donner-Grau, her true heir, her daughter of daughters. I was, likeFlorinda Matus, only a figure in the background, put there by don Juan Matus tobreak the loneliness of a warrior, and enjoy my passage on earth. ================================================================ Quotations from \"The Eagle's Gift\" The art of dreaming is the capacity to utilize one's ordinary dreams andtransform them into controlled awareness by virtue of a specialized form ofattention called the dreaming attention. The art of stalking is a set of procedures and attitudes that enables a warriorto get the best out of any conceivable and every inconceivable situation. The recommendation for warriors is not to have any material things on which tofocus their power, but to focus it on the spirit; on the true flight into theunknown, not on trivialities.Everyone who wants to follow the warrior's path has to rid himself of thecompulsion to possess and hold onto things. Seeing is a bodily knowledge. The predominance of the visual sense in usinfluences this bodily knowledge and makes it seem to be eye-related. Losing the human form is like a spiral. It gives a warrior the freedom toremember himself as straight fields of energy and this in turn makes him evenfreer. A warrior knows that he is waiting, and he knows what he is waiting for; andwhile he waits, he feasts his eyes upon the world. A warrior's ultimateaccomplishment is to enjoy the joy of infinity. The course of a warrior's destiny is unalterable. The challenge is how far hecan go and how impeccable he can be within those rigid bounds. People's actions no longer affect a warrior when he has no more expectations ofany kind. A strange peace becomes the ruling force in his life. He has adoptedone of the concepts of a warrior's life- detachment. Detachment does not automatically mean wisdom, but it is, nonetheless, anadvantage because it allows the warrior to pause momentarily to reassesssituations; to reconsider one's position. In order to use that extra momentconsistently and correctly, however, a warrior has to struggle unyieldingly forthe duration of your life. I am already given to the power that rules my fate.And I cling to nothing, so I will have nothing to defend.I have no thoughts, so I will see.I fear nothing, so I will remember myself.Detached and at ease,I will dart past the Eagle to be free. It is much easier for warriors to fare well under conditions of maximum stressthan to be impeccable under normal circumstances. Human beings are two-sided. The right side encompasses everything the intellectcan conceive of. The left side is a realm of indescribable features; a realmimpossible to contain in words. The left side is perhaps comprehended, ifcomprehension is what takes place, with the total body; thus its resistance toconceptualization. [* conceptualization- inventing or contriving an idea orexplanation and formulating it mentally] All the faculties, possibilities, and accomplishments of shamanism, from thesimplest to the most astounding, are in the human body itself. The power that governs the destiny of all living beings is called the Eagle, notbecause it is an eagle or has anything to do with an eagle, but because itappears to the eye of the seer as an immeasurable jet-black eagle, standingerect as an eagle stands, its height reaching to infinity. The Eagle devours the awareness of all the creatures that, alive on earth amoment before and now dead, have floated to the Eagle's beak like a swarm offireflies to meet their owner; their reason for having had life.The Eagle disentangles these tiny flames, lays them flat, as a tanner stretchesout a hide, and then consumes them; for awareness is the Eagle's food. The Eagle, that power that governs the destinies of all living things, reflectsequally and at once all those living things. There is no way, therefore, for manto pray to the Eagle; to ask favors; to hope for grace. The human part of theEagle is too insignificant to move the whole. Every living thing has been granted the power, if it so desires, to seek anopening to freedom and go through it. It is evident to the seer who sees theopening, and to the creatures that go through it, that the Eagle has grantedthat gift in order to perpetuate awareness. To cross over to freedom does not mean eternal life as eternity is commonlyunderstood- that is, as living forever. Rather, warriors can keep theirawareness, which is ordinarily relinquished at the moment of dying.At the moment of crossing, the body in its entirety is kindled with knowledge.Every cell at once becomes aware of itself and also aware of the totality of thebody. The Eagle's gift of freedom is not a bestowal. Its a chance to have a chance. A warrior is never under siege. To be under siege implies that one has personalpossessions that could be blockaded. A warrior has nothing in the world excepthis impeccability, and impeccability cannot be threatened. The first principle of the art of stalking is that warriors choose theirbattleground. A warrior never goes into battle without knowing what thesurroundings are. To discard everything that is unnecessary is the second principle of the art ofstalking. A warrior doesn't complicate things. He aims at being simple. A warrior applies all the concentration he has to decide whether or not to enterinto battle, for any battle is a battle for his life.This is the third principle of the art of stalking. A warrior must be willingand ready to make his last stand here and now. But not in a helter-skelter way. A warrior relaxes and abandons himself. He fears nothing. Only then will thepowers that guide human beings open the road for a warrior and aid him.Only-then. That is the fourth principle of the art of stalking. When faced with odds that cannot be dealt with, warriors retreat for a moment.They let their minds meander. They occupy their time with something else.Anything would do. That is the fifth principle of the art of stalking. Warriors compress time. This is the sixth principle of the art of stalking. Evenan instant counts. In a battle for your life, a second is an eternity, aneternity that may decide the outcome. Warriors aim at succeeding, therefore theycompress time. Warriors don't waste an instant. In order to apply the seventh principle of the art of stalking, one has to applythe other six: a stalker never pushes himself to the front. He is always lookingon from behind the scenes. Applying these principles brings about three results. The first is that stalkerslearn never to take themselves seriously. They learn to laugh at themselves. Ifthey are not afraid of being a fool, they can fool anyone. The second is thatstalkers learn to have endless patience. Stalkers are never in a hurry, theynever fret. And the third is that stalkers learn to have an endless capacity toimprovise. Warriors face the oncoming time. Normally we face time as it recedes from us.Only warriors can change that and face time as it advances on them. Warriors have only one thing in mind: their freedom. To die and be eaten by theEagle is no challenge. On the other hand, to sneak around the Eagle and be freeis the ultimate audacity. When warriors talk about time, they are not referring to something which ismeasured by the movement of a clock. Time is the essence of attention. TheEagle's emanations are made out of time, and properly speaking, when a warriorenters into other aspects of the self, he is becoming acquainted with time. A warrior can no longer weep. His only expression of anguish is a shiver thatcomes from the very depths of the universe. It is as if one of the Eagle'semanations were made out of pure anguish, and when it hits a warrior, thewarrior's shiver is infinite. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commentary on \"The Eagle's Gift\"It was a remarkable sensation for me to examine the quotations drawn from TheEagle's Gift. I felt immediately the hard coil of the intent of the shamans ofancient Mexico working as vividly as ever. I knew then, beyond the shadow of adoubt, that the quotations from this book were ruled by their wheel of time.Further, I knew that this had been the case with everything I had done in thepast, such as writing The Eagle's Gift, and that it is the case with everythingI do, as in writing the present book.Since I am at a loss to elucidate this matter, the only option open to me is toaccept it in humbleness. The shamans of ancient Mexico did have anothercognitive system at work, and from the units of that cognitive system, theystill affect me today in the most positive, uplifting fashion.Due to the effort of Florinda Matus, who engaged me in learning the mostelaborate variations of standard shamanistic techniques devised by the shamansof ancient times, such as the recapitulation for instance, I was able to view myexperiences with don Juan with a force I never could have imagined.The corpus of my book, The Eagle's Gift, is the result of such views that I hadof don Juan Matus. For don Juan Matus, to recapitulate meant to relive andrearrange everything of one's life in one single sweep. He never bothered withthe minutiae of elaborate variations of that ancient technique. Florinda, on theother hand, had an entirely different meticulousness. She spent months coachingme to enter into aspects of recapitulating that I am to this day at a loss toexplain.\"It is the vastness of the warrior which you are experiencing,\" she explained.\"The techniques are there. Big deal. What is of supreme importance is the manusing them, and his desire to go all the way with them.\"To recapitulate don Juan in Florinda's terms resulted in views of don Juan ofthe most excruciating detail and meaning. It was infinitely more intense thantalking to don Juan himself had been.It was Florinda's pragmatism that gave me astounding insights into practicalpossibilities that were not in the least the concern of the nagual Juan Matus.Florinda, being a true woman pragmatist, had no illusions about herself; nodreams of grandeur. She said that she was a plower who could not afford to missa single turn of the way.\"A warrior must go very slowly,\" she recommended, \"and make use of everyavailable item on the warriors' path. One of the most remarkable items is thecapacity we all have as warriors to focus our attention with unwavering force onevents lived. Warriors can even focus it on people they have never met. The endresult of this deep focusing is always the same. It reconstructs the scene.Whole chunks of behavior, forgotten or brand new, make themselves available to awarrior. Try it.\"I followed her advice, and of course, I focused on don Juan, and I rememberedeverything that had transpired at any given moment. I remembered details that Ihad no business remembering. Thanks to the work of Florinda, I was able toreconstruct enormous chunks of activity with don Juan; as well as details oftremendous importance that had bypassed me completely.The spirit of the quotations from The Eagle's Gift was most shocking to mebecause the quotations revealed the profound emphasis that don Juan had put onthe items of his world; on the warriors' way as the epitome of humanaccomplishment. That drive had survived his person, and was as alive as ever.Sometimes, I sincerely felt that don Juan had never left. I got to the point ofactually hearing him moving around the house. I asked Florinda about it.She said, \"Oh, that's nothing. It's just the nagual Juan Matus's emptiness thatreaches out to touch you, no matter where his awareness is at the moment.\"Her answer left me more puzzled, more intrigued, and more despondent than ever.Although Florinda was the closest person to the nagual Juan Matus, they wereastoundingly different. One thing that they both shared was the emptiness oftheir persons. They were no longer people. Don Juan Matus did not exist as aperson. But what existed instead of his person was a collection of stories, eachof them apropos to the situation he was discussing; didactic stories and jokesthat bore the mark of his sobriety and his frugality.Florinda was the same. She had stories upon stories. But her stories were aboutpeople. They were like a high form of gossip, or gossip elevated, due to herimpersonality, to inconceivable heights of effectiveness and enjoyment.\"I want you to examine one man who bears a tremendous resemblance to you,\" shesaid one day to me. \"I want you to recapitulate him as if you had known him allyour life. This man was transcendental in the formation of our lineage. His namewas Elias, the nagual Elias. I call him 'the nagual who lost heaven.'\"The story is that the nagual Elias was reared by a Jesuit priest who taught himto read and write and to play the harpsichord. He taught him Latin. The nagualElias could read the scriptures in Latin as fluently as any scholar could. Hisdestiny was to be a priest, but he was an Indian, and Indians in those days didnot fit into clerical hierarchies. They were too awesome-looking, too dark, tooIndian. Priests were from the upper social classes; descendants of Spaniards,with white skin, blue eyes. They were handsome; presentable. The nagual Eliaswas a bear in comparison. But he struggled long, kindled by his mentor's promisethat God would see that he was accepted into the priesthood.\"He was the sexton [* sexton- an officer of the church who is in charge ofsacred objects] of the church where his mentor was the parish priest, and oneday, an actual witch walked in. Her name was Amalia. They say that she was awild card. Be that as it may, she ended up seducing the poor sexton, who fell sodeeply, so hopelessly in love with Amalia that he ended up in the hut of anagual man. In time, he became the nagual Elias, a figure to reckon with,cultured, well-read. It seemed that the niche of nagual was made for him. Itallowed him the anonymity and the effectiveness that was denied him in theworld.\"He was a dreamer, and so good at it that he covered the most recondite placesof the universe in a bodiless state. Sometimes he even brought back objects thathad attracted his eye because of the lines of their design; objects that wereincomprehensible. He called them 'inventions.' He had a whole collection ofthem.\"I want you to focus your recapitulation attention on those inventions,\"Florinda commanded me. \"I want you to end up sniffing them, and feeling themwith your hands, although you have never seen them except through what I amtelling you now. To do this focusing means to establish a point of reference, asin an algebraic equation in which something is calculated by playing on a thirdelement. You'll be able to see the nagual Juan Matus with infinite clarity,using someone else as a point of corroboration.\"The corpus of the book The Eagle's Gift is a review in depth of what don Juanhad done to me while he was in the world. The views that I had of don Juan dueto my new recapitulation skills- using the nagual Elias as a point ofcorroboration- were infinitely more intense than any views that I had of himwhile he was alive.The recapitulation views I was engaged in lacked the warmth of the living, butthey had instead the precision and the accuracy of inanimate objects that onecan examine to one's hearts content. ================================================================= Quotations from \"The Fire from Within\" There is no completeness without sadness and longing, for without them there isno sobriety, no kindness. Wisdom without kindness and knowledge without sobrietyare useless. Self-importance is man's greatest enemy. What weakens him is feeling offended bythe deeds and misdeeds of his fellow men. Self-importance requires that onespend most of one's life offended by something or someone. In order to follow the path of knowledge, one has to be very imaginative. On thepath of knowledge, nothing is as clear as we'd like it to be. If seers can hold their own in facing petty tyrants, they can certainly face theunknown with impunity, and then they can even withstand the presence of theunknowable. What seems natural is to think that a warrior who can hold his own in the faceof the unknown can certainly face petty tyrants with impunity. But that's notnecessarily so. What destroyed the superb warriors of ancient times was to relyon that assumption.Nothing can temper the spirit of a warrior as much as the challenge of dealingwith impossible people in positions of power. Only under those conditions canwarriors acquire the sobriety and serenity to withstand the pressure of theunknowable. The unknown is something that is veiled from man, shrouded perhaps by aterrifying context, but which, nonetheless, is within man's reach. The unknownbecomes the known at a given time. The unknowable, on the other hand, is theindescribable; the unthinkable; the unrealizable. It is something that willnever be known to us, and yet it is there; dazzling and at the same timehorrifying in its vastness. We perceive. This is a hard fact. But what we perceive is not a fact of the samekind because we learn what to perceive. Warriors say that we think there is a world of objects out there only because ofour awareness. But what's really out there are the Eagle's emanations; fluid,forever in motion, and yet unchanged; eternal. The deepest flaw of unseasoned warriors is that they are willing to forget thewonder of what they see. They become overwhelmed by the fact that they see andbelieve that it's their genius that counts. A seasoned warrior must be a paragonof discipline in order to override the nearly invincible laxness of our humancondition. More important than seeing itself is what warriors do with what theysee. One of the greatest forces in the lives of warriors is fear, because it spursthem to learn. For a seer, the truth is that all living beings are struggling to die. Whatstops death is awareness. The unknown is forever present, but it is outside the possibility of our normalawareness. The unknown is the superfluous part of the average man. And it issuperfluous because the average man doesn't have enough free energy to grasp it. The greatest flaw of human beings is to remain glued to the inventory of reason.Reason doesn't deal with man as energy. Reason deals with instruments thatcreate energy, but it has never seriously occurred to reason that we are betterthan instruments: We are organisms that create energy. We are bubbles of energy. Warriors who deliberately attain total awareness are a sight to behold. That isthe moment when they burn from within. The fire from within consumes them. Infull awareness they fuse themselves to the emanations of the Eagle at large, andglide into eternity. Once inner silence is attained, everything is possible. The way to stop talkingto ourselves is to use exactly the same method used to teach us to talk toourselves. We were taught compulsively and unwaveringly, and this is the way wemust stop it: compulsively and unwaveringly. Impeccability begins with a single act that has to be deliberate, precise, andsustained. If that act is repeated long enough, one acquires a sense ofunbending intent which can be applied to anything else. If that is accomplishedthe road is clear. One thing will lead to another until the warrior realizes hisfull potential. The mystery of awareness is darkness. Human beings reek of that mystery; ofthings which are inexplicable. To regard ourselves in any other terms ismadness. So a warrior doesn't demean the mystery of man by trying to rationalizeit. Realizations are of two kinds. One is just pep talk; great outbursts of emotionand nothing more. The other is the product of a shift of the assemblage point:It is not coupled with an emotional outburst, but with action. The emotionalrealizations come years later after warriors have solidified, by usage, the newposition of their assemblage points. The worst that could happen to us is that we have to die, and since that isalready our unalterable fate, we are free. Those who have lost everything nolonger have anything to fear. Warriors don't venture into the unknown out of greed. Greed works only in theworld of ordinary affairs. To venture into the terrifying loneliness of theunknown, one must have something other than greed: love. One needs love forlife; for intrigue; for mystery. One needs unquenchable curiosity and gutsgalore. A warrior thinks only of the mysteries of awareness: Mystery is all thatmatters. We are living beings. We have to die and relinquish our awareness. Butif we could change just a tinge of that, what mysteries must await us? Whatmysteries! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commentary on \"The Fire from Within\"The Fire from Within as a book was another of the end results of the influenceof Florinda Matus on my life. She guided me to focus this time on don Juan'steacher, the nagual Julian. Both Florinda and my detailed focusing on the manrevealed to me that the nagual Julian Osorio had been an actor of some merit-but more than an actor, he had been a licentious [* licentious- lacking moraldiscipline; especially sexually unrestrained] man, concerned exclusively withthe seduction of women; women of any kind with whom he came in contact duringhis theatrical presentations. He was so extremely licentious that ultimately,his health failed, and he became infected with tuberculosis.His teacher, the nagual Elias, found him one afternoon in an open field on theoutskirts of the city of Durango, seducing the daughter of a wealthy landowner.Due to the exertion, the actor began to hemorrhage, and the hemorrhage became soheavy that he was on the brink of dying. Florinda said that the nagual Elias sawthat there was no way for him to help him. To cure the actor was animpossibility, and the only thing that he could do as a nagual was to arrest thebleeding, which he did. He saw fit to make then a proposition to the actor.\"I'm leaving at five in the morning for the mountains,\" he said. \"Be at theentrance of the town. Don't fail. If you fail to come, you will die, sooner thanyou think. Your only recourse is to go with me. I'll never be able to cure you,but I will be able to deviate your inexorable walk to the abyss that marks theend of life. All of us human beings go inexorably into that abyss sooner orlater. I will head you off to walk the enormous extent of that crack, either tothe left or to the right of it. As long as you don't fall, you will live. You'llnever be well, but you'll live.\"The nagual Elias didn't have great expectations about the actor, who was lazy,slovenly, [* slovenly- negligent of neatness especially in dress and person;habitually dirty and unkempt] self-indulgent, and perhaps even a coward. Thenagual was quite surprised when the next day at five in the morning he found theactor waiting for him at the edge of the town. He took him to the mountains, andin time, the actor became the nagual Julian- a tubercular man who was nevercured, but who lived to be perhaps one hundred and seven years old, alwayswalking along the edge of the abyss.\"Of course, it is of supreme importance to you,\" Florinda said to me once, \"thatyou examine the walk of the nagual Julian along the edge of the abyss. Thenagual Juan Matus didn't care to know anything about it. To him, all of that wassuperfluous. You're not as talented as the nagual Juan Matus. Nothing can besuperfluous for you as a warrior. You must allow the thoughts, the feelings, andthe ideas of the shamans of ancient Mexico to come to you freely.\"Florinda was right. I don't have the splendor of the nagual Juan Matus. Just asshe had said, nothing could be superfluous to me. I needed every prop; everytwist. I could not afford to bypass any of the views or ideas of the shamans ofancient Mexico no matter how far-fetched they might have seemed to me.To examine the walk of the nagual Julian on the edge of the abyss meant that theability to focus my recollection could be extended to the feelings that thenagual Julian had about his most extraordinary struggle to remain alive. I wasshocked to the marrow of my bones to find out that the struggle of that man wasa second-to-second fight; with his terrifying habits of indulging and hisextraordinary sensuality pitted against his rigid adherence to survival.His fight was not sporadic. It was a most sustained, disciplined struggle toremain balanced. 'Walking on the edge of the abyss' meant the battle of awarrior enhanced to such a degree that every second counted. One single momentof weakness would have thrown the nagual Julian into that abyss.However, he kept his view, his emphasis, and his concern focused on whatFlorinda called the edge of the abyss, and the pressure eased. Whatever he wasviewing was not as desperate as what he was viewing when his old habits began totake hold of him. It seemed to me that when I looked at the nagual Julian atthose moments, I was recapitulating a different man; a man more peaceful, moredetached, and more collected. ================================================================= Quotations from \"The Power of Silence\" It isn't that a warrior learns shamanism as time goes by; rather, what he learnsas time goes by is to save energy. This energy will enable him to handle some ofthe energy fields which are ordinarily inaccessible to him. Shamanism is a stateof awareness; the ability to use energy fields that are not employed inperceiving the everyday-life world that we know. In the universe there is an immeasurable, indescribable force which shamans callintent, and absolutely everything that exists in the entire cosmos is attachedto intent by a connecting link. Warriors are concerned with discussing,understanding, and employing that connecting link. They are especially concernedwith cleaning it of the numbing effects brought about by the ordinary concernsof their everyday lives. Shamanism at this level can be defined as the procedureof cleaning one's connecting link to intent. Shamans are vitally concerned with their past, but not their personal past. Forshamans, their past is what other shamans in bygone days have accomplished. Theyconsult their past in order to obtain a point of reference. Only shamansgenuinely seek a point of reference in their past. For them, establishing apoint of reference means a chance to examine intent. The average man also examines the past. But it's his personal past he examinesfor personal reasons. He measures himself against the past, whether his personalpast or the past knowledge of his time, in order to find justifications for hispresent or future behavior; or to establish a model for himself. The spirit manifests itself to a warrior at every turn. However, this is not theentire truth. The entire truth is that the spirit reveals itself to everyonewith the same intensity and consistency, but only warriors are consistentlyattuned to such revelations. Warriors speak of shamanism as a magical, mysterious bird which has paused inits flight for a moment in order to give man hope and purpose. Warriors liveunder the wing of that bird which they call the bird of wisdom; the bird offreedom. For a warrior, the spirit is an abstract only because he knows it without wordsor even thoughts. It's an abstract because he can't conceive what the spirit is.Yet, without the slightest chance or desire to understand it, a warrior handlesthe spirit. He recognizes it, beckons it, entices it, becomes familiar with it,and expresses it with his acts. The average man's connecting link with intent is practically dead, and warriorsbegin with a link that is useless because it does not respond voluntarily. Inorder to revive that link, warriors need a rigorous, fierce purpose- a specialstate of mind called unbending intent. The power of man is incalculable: Death exists only because we have intended itsince the moment of our birth. However, the intent of death can be suspended bymaking the assemblage point change positions. The art of stalking is learning all the quirks of your disguise, and learningthem so well that no one will know you are disguised. For that you need to beruthless, cunning, patient and sweet. Ruthlessness should not be harshness,cunning should not be cruelty, patience should not be negligence, and sweetnessshould not be foolishness. Warriors have an ulterior purpose for their acts, which has nothing to do withpersonal gain. The average man acts only If there is the chance for profit.Warriors act not for profit, but for the spirit. The shaman seers of ancient times, through their seeing, first noticed that anyunusual behavior produced a tremor in the assemblage point. They soon discoveredthat if unusual behavior is practiced systematically and directed wisely, iteventually forces the assemblage point to move. Silent knowledge is nothing but direct contact with intent. Shamanism is a journey of return. A warrior returns victorious to the spirit,having descended into hell. And from hell he brings trophies. Understanding isone of his trophies. Warriors, because they are stalkers, understand human behavior to perfection.They understand, for instance, that human beings are creatures of inventory.Knowing the ins and cuts of a particular inventory is what makes a man a scholaror an expert in his field. Warriors know that when an average person's inventory fails, the person eitherenlarges his inventory or his world of self-reflection collapses. The averageperson is able to incorporate new items into his inventory if the new itemsdon't contradict the inventory's underlying order. But if the items contradictthat order, the person's mind collapses. The inventory is the mind. Warriorscount on this when they attempt to break the mirror of self-reflection. Warriors can never make a bridge to join the people of the world. But, if peopledesire to do so, they have to make a bridge to join warriors. In order for the mysteries of shamanism to be available to anyone, the spiritmust descend onto whoever is interested. The spirit lets its presence by itselfmove the man's assemblage point to a specific position. This precise spot isknown to shamans as the place of no pity. There really is no procedure involved in making the assemblage point move to theplace of no pity. The spirit touches the person and his assemblage point moves.It is as simple as that. What we need to do to allow magic to get hold of us is to banish doubts from ourminds. Once doubts are banished, anything is possible. Man's possibilities are so vast and mysterious that warriors, rather thanthinking about them, have chosen to explore them with no hope of everunderstanding them. Everything that warriors do is done as a consequence of a movement of theirassemblage points, and such movements are ruled by the amount of energy warriorshave at their command. Any movement of the assemblage point means a movement away from an excessiveconcern with the individual self. Shamans believe it is the position of theassemblage point which makes modern man a homicidal egotist; a being totallyinvolved with his self-image. Having lost hope of ever returning to the sourceof everything, the average man seeks solace in his selfishness. The thrust of the warriors' way is to dethrone self-importance. And everythingwarriors do is directed toward accomplishing this goal. Shamans have unmasked self-importance and found that it is self-pitymasquerading as something else. In the world of everyday life, one's word or one's decisions can be reversedvery easily. The only irrevocable thing in the everyday world is death. In theshamans' world, on the other hand, normal death can be countermanded, but notthe shamans' word. In the shamans' world decisions cannot be changed or revised.Once they have been made, they stand forever. One of the most dramatic things about the human condition is the macabreconnection between stupidity and self-reflection. It is stupidity that forcesthe average man to discard anything that does not conform with hisself-reflective expectations.For example, as average men, we are blind to the most crucial piece of knowledgeavailable to a human being: the existence of the assemblage point and the factthat it can move. For the rational man to hold steadfastly to his self-image ensures his abysmalignorance. He ignores the fact that shamanism is not incantations andhocus-pocus, but rather the freedom to perceive not only the world taken forgranted, but everything else that is humanly possible to experience. He tremblesat the possibility of freedom. And freedom is at his fingertips. Man's predicament is that he intuits his hidden resources, but he does not dareuse them. This is why warriors say that man's plight is the counterpoint betweenhis stupidity and his ignorance. Man needs now, more than ever, to be taught newideas that have to do exclusively with his inner world- not social ideas;shamans' ideas pertaining to man facing the unknown, and facing his personaldeath. Now, more than anything else, he needs to be taught the secrets of theassemblage point. The spirit listens only when the speaker speaks in gestures. And gestures do notmean signs or body movements, but acts of true abandon; acts of largesse; ofhumor. As a gesture for the spirit, warriors bring out the best of themselvesand silently offer it to the abstract. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Commentary on \"The Power of Silence\"The last book that I ever wrote about don Juan as a direct result of theguidance of Florinda Matus was called The Power of Silence; a title that waschosen by my editor. My title had been Inner Silence.At the time that I was working on the book, the views of the shamans of ancientMexico had become extremely abstract for me. Florinda tried her best to deviateme from my absorption in the abstract. She attempted to redirect my attention todifferent aspects of old shamanistic techniques, or she tried to divert me byshocking me with her scandalous behavior. But nothing was sufficient to deviateme from my seemingly inexorable drive.The Power of Silence is an intellectual review of the thoughts of the shamans ofancient Mexico in their most abstract guise. As I worked alone on the book, Iwas contaminated by the mood of those men; by their desire to know more in aquasi-rational way. Florinda explained that in the end, those shamans had becomeextremely cold and detached. Nothing warm existed for them anymore. They wereset in their quest: Their coldness as men was an effort to match the coldness ofinfinity. They had succeeded in changing their human eyes to match the cold eyesof the unknown.I sensed this in myself, and tried desperately to turn the tide. I haven'tsucceeded yet. My thoughts have become more and more like the thoughts of thosemen at the end of their quest. It is not that I don't laugh. Quite the contrary,my life is an endless joy. But at the same time, it is an endless, mercilessquest.Infinity will swallow me, and I want to be prepared for it. I don't wantinfinity to dissolve me into nothing because I hold human desires, warmaffection, and attachments, no matter how vague. More than anything else in thisworld, I want to be like those men. I never knew them. The only shamans I knewwere don Juan and his cohorts, and what they expressed was the furthest thingfrom the coldness that I intuit in those unknown men.Due to the influence that Florinda had on my life, I succeeded brilliantly inlearning to focus my unwavering attention on the mood of people I never knew.But as I focused my recapitulation attention on the mood of those shamans, I gottrapped by it without hope of ever extricating myself from their pull.Florinda didn't believe in the finality of my state. She humored me, and laughedat it openly.\"Your state only seems to be final,\" she said to me, \"but it isn't. A momentwill come when you will change venues. Perhaps you will chuck every thoughtabout the shamans of ancient Mexico. Perhaps you may even chuck the thoughts andviews of the very shamans you worked with so closely, like the nagual JuanMatus. You might refuse his being.\"You'll see. The warrior has no limits. His sense of improvisation is so acutethat he will make constructs out of nothing- not just mere empty constructs, butrather, something workable, and pragmatic.\"You'll see. It is not that you'll forget about them, but at one moment beforeyou plunge into the abyss- if you have the gall to walk along its edge, and ifyou have the daring not to deviate from it- you will then arrive at warriors'conclusions of an order and stability infinitely more suited to you than thefixation of the shamans of ancient Mexico.\"Florinda's words were like a handsome, hopeful prophecy. Perhaps she was right.She was of course right in asserting that the resources of a warrior have nolimits.The only flaw is that in order for me to have a different orderly view of theworld and myself, a view even more suited to my temperament, I have to walkalong the edge of the abyss, and I have doubts that I have the daring andstrength to accomplish that feat.But who is there to tell? ### \"The Wheel of Time\" - Copyright 1998 by Carlos Castaneda - The End ###"}]
