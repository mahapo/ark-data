Don Juan Matus's suggestion that I gather my memorable events was made as if itwere a casual suggestion; something that occurred to him on the spur of themoment.That was don Juan's style of teaching. He veiled the importance of certainmaneuvers behind the mundane. In this fashion, he hid the sting of finality.He presented his suggestion as if it were something no different from any otherconcern of my everyday life. As time went by, Don Juan revealed to me that the shamans of ancient Mexico hadconceived of this collection of memorable events as a bona-fide [* bona-fide-undertaken in good faith; not counterfeit or copied] device to stir caches ofenergy that exist within the self.The ancient shamans explained these caches as being composed of energy thatoriginates in the body itself, and becomes displaced and pushed out of reach bythe circumstances of our daily lives.In this sense for don Juan and the shamans of his lineage, the collection ofmemorable events was a means for redeploying their unused energy.The prerequisite for this collection was the genuine and all-consuming act ofputting together the sum total of one's emotions and realizations withoutsparing anything.According to don Juan, the shamans of his lineage were convinced that thecollection of memorable events was a vehicle for the emotional and energeticadjustment necessary for venturing, in terms of perception, into the unknown.Don Juan described the total goal of the shamanistic knowledge that he handledas the preparation for facing the definitive journey that every human being hasto take at the end of his or her life.He said that through their discipline and resolve, shamans were capable ofretaining their individual awareness and purpose after death.For shamans, the vague, idealistic state that modern man calls 'life afterdeath' is a concrete region filled to capacity with practical affairs of adifferent order, yet bearing a similar functional practicality to the practicalaffairs of our daily life.Don Juan considered that, for shamans, collecting the memorable events in theirlives was the preparation for their entrance into that concrete region whichthey called the active side of infinity. Don Juan and I had been talking one afternoon under his ramada: His ramada was aloose structure made of thin poles of bamboo. It looked like a roofed porch thatwas partially shaded from the sun, but that would not provide protection at allfrom the rain.There were some small, sturdy freight boxes there that served as benches. Theirfreight brands were faded, and appeared to be more ornament than identification.I was sitting on one of them. My back was against the front wall of the house.Don Juan was sitting on another box, and was leaning against a pole thatsupported the ramada.I had just driven in a few minutes earlier. It had been a daylong ride in hot,humid weather. I was nervous, fidgety, and sweaty.Don Juan began talking to me as soon as I had comfortably settled down on thebox. With a broad smile, he commented that overweight people hardly ever knewhow to fight fatness. The smile that played on his lips gave me an inkling thathe wasn't being facetious. He was just pointing out to me, in a most direct andat the same time indirect way, that I was overweight.I became so nervous that I tipped over the freight box on which I was sittingand my back banged very hard against the thin wall of the house. The impactshook the house to its foundations.Don Juan looked at me inquiringly, but instead of asking me if I was all right,he assured me that I had not cracked the house.Then he expansively explained to me that his house was a temporary dwelling forhim; that he really lived somewhere else.When I asked him where he really lived, he stared at me. HTML EDITOR:Carlos has already been to Juan's other house, but Carlos did not recall this atthe time.END HTML EDITOR His look was not belligerent: It was, rather, a firm deterrent to improperquestions.I didn't comprehend what he wanted. I was about to ask the same question again,but he stopped me.\"Questions of that sort are not asked around here,\" he said firmly. \"Askanything you wish about procedures or ideas. Whenever I'm ready to tell youwhere I live, if ever, I will tell you without your having to ask me.\"I instantly felt rejected. My face turned red involuntarily. I was definitelyoffended.Don Juan's explosion of laughter added immensely to my chagrin. Not only had herejected me, he had insulted me and then laughed at me.\"I live here temporarily,\" he went on, unconcerned with my foul mood, \"becausethis is a magical center. In fact, I live here because of you.\"That statement unraveled me. I couldn't believe it. I thought that he wasprobably saying that to ease my irritation at being insulted. Unable to containmy curiosity, I finally asked him, \"Do you really live here because of me?\"\"Yes,\" he said evenly. \"I have to groom you. You are like me. I will repeat toyou now what I have already told you.\"The quest of every nagual, or leader, in every generation of shamans, orsorcerers, is to find a new man or woman who, like himself, shows a doubleenergetic structure.\"I saw this feature in you when we were in the bus depot in Nogales. When I seeyour energy, I see two balls of luminosity superimposed, one on top of theother, and that feature binds us together. I can't refuse you any more than youcan refuse me.\"His words caused a most strange agitation in me. An instant before I had beenangry, but now I wanted to weep.He went on, saying that he wanted to start me off on something shamans calledthe warriors' way, backed by the strength of the area where he lived which wasthe center of very strong emotions and reactions. Warlike people had lived therefor thousands of years, soaking the land with their concern with war.He lived at that time in the state of Sonora in northern Mexico, about a hundredmiles south of the city of Guaymas. I always went there to visit him under theauspices of conducting my fieldwork.\"Do I need to enter into war, don Juan?\" I asked, genuinely worried after hedeclared that the concern with war was something that I would need someday. Ihad already learned to take everything he said with the utmost seriousness.\"You bet your boots,\" he replied, smiling. \"When you have absorbed all there isto be absorbed in this area, I'll move away.\"I had no grounds to doubt what he was saying, but I couldn't conceive of him asliving anywhere else. He was absolutely part of everything that surrounded him.His house, however, seemed indeed to be a temporary dwelling. It was a shacktypical of the Yaqui farmers. It was made out of wattle and daub with a flat,thatched roof. It had one big room for eating and sleeping, and had a rooflesskitchen in the back. \"It's very difficult to deal with overweight people,\" he said.It seemed to be a non sequitur, [* non sequitur- a reply that has no relevanceto what preceded it] but it wasn't. Don Juan was simply going back to thesubject he had introduced before I had interrupted him by hitting my back on thewall of his house.\"A minute ago, you hit my house like a demolition ball,\" he said, shaking hishead slowly from side to side. \"What an impact! An impact worthy of a portlyman.\"I had the uncomfortable feeling that he was talking to me from the point of viewof someone who had given up on me. I immediately took on a defensive attitude.He listened, smirking, to my frantic explanations that my weight was normal formy bone structure.\"That's right,\" he conceded facetiously. \"You have big bones. You could probablycarry thirty more pounds with great ease and no one, I assure you, no one wouldnotice. I would not notice.\"His mocking smile told me that I was definitely pudgy. He asked me then about myhealth in general, and I went on talking, desperately trying to get out of anyfurther comment about my weight. He changed the subject himself. \"What's new about your eccentricities and aberrations?\" he asked with a deadpanexpression.I idiotically answered that they were okay.Eccentricities and aberrations was how he labeled my interest in being acollector. At that time, I had taken up, with renewed zeal, something that I hadenjoyed doing all my life: collecting anything collectible. I collectedmagazines, stamps, records, World War II paraphernalia such as daggers, militaryhelmets, flags, etc.\"All I can tell you, don Juan, about my aberrations, is that I'm trying to sellmy collections,\" I said with the air of a martyr who is being forced to dosomething odious.\"To be a collector is not such a bad idea,\" he said as if he really believed it.\"The crux of the matter is not that you collect, but what you collect.\"You collect junk; worthless objects that imprison you as surely as your pet dogdoes. You can't just up and leave if you have your pet to look after, or if youhave to worry about what would happen to your collections if you were notaround.\"\"I'm seriously looking for buyers, don Juan, believe me,\" I protested.\"No, no, no. Don't feel that I'm accusing you of anything,\" he retorted. \"Infact, I like your collector's spirit. I just don't like your collections, that'sall.\"I would like, though, to engage your collector's eye. I would like to proposeto you a worthwhile collection.\"Don Juan paused for a long moment.He seemed to be in search of words; or perhaps it was only a dramatic,well-placed hesitation. He looked at me with a deep, penetrating stare.\"Every warrior, as a matter of duty, collects a special album,\" don Juan wenton, \"an album that reveals the warrior's personality; an album that attests tothe circumstances of his life.\"\"Why do you call this a collection, don Juan?\" I asked in an argumentative tone.\"Or an album, for that matter?\"\"Because it is both,\" he retorted. \"But above all, it is like an album ofpictures made out of memories; pictures made out of the recollection ofmemorable events.\"\"Are those memorable events memorable in some specific way?\" I asked.\"They are memorable because they have a special significance in one's life,\" hesaid. \"My proposal is that you assemble this album by putting in it the completeaccount of various events that have had profound significance for you.\"\"Every event in my life has had profound significance for me, don Juan!\" I saidforcefully, and felt instantly the impact of my own pomposity.\"Not really,\" he replied, smiling, apparently enjoying my reactions immensely.\"Not every event in your life has had profound significance for you.\"There are a few, however, that I would consider likely to have changed thingsfor you; to have illuminated your path. Ordinarily, events that change our pathare impersonal affairs, and yet are extremely personal.\"\"I'm not trying to be difficult, don Juan, but believe me, everything that hashappened to me meets those qualifications,\" I said, knowing that I was lying.Immediately after voicing this statement, I wanted to apologize, but don Juandidn't pay attention to me. It was as if I hadn't said a thing.He said, \"Don't think about this album in terms of banalities, or in terms of atrivial rehashing of your life experiences.\" I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and tried to quiet my mind. I was talkingto myself frantically about my insoluble problem.I most certainly didn't like to visit don Juan at all. In his presence, I feltthreatened. He verbally accosted me and didn't leave me any room whatsoever toshow my worth. I detested losing face every time I opened my mouth. I detestedbeing the fool.But there was another voice inside me; a voice that came from a greater depth;more distant; almost faint.In the midst of my barrages of dialogue, I heard myself saying that it was toolate for me to turn back.But it wasn't really my voice or my thoughts that I was experiencing. It was,rather, like an unknown voice that said I was too far gone into don Juan'sworld, and that I needed him more than I needed air.\"Say whatever you wish,\" the voice seemed to say to me, \"but if you were not theegomaniac that you are, you wouldn't be so chagrined.\"\"That's the voice of your other mind,\" don Juan said, just as if he had beenlistening to, or reading my thoughts.My body jumped involuntarily. My fright was so intense that tears came to myeyes. I confessed to don Juan the whole nature of my turmoil.\"Your conflict is a very natural one,\" he said. \"And believe you me, I don'texacerbate it that much. I'm not the type.\"I have some stories to tell you about what my teacher, the nagual Julian, usedto do to me. I detested him with my entire being.I was very young, and I saw how women adored him; gave themselves to him likeanything. And when I tried to say hello to them, they would turn against me likelionesses ready to bite my head off. They hated my guts and loved him. How doyou think I felt?\"\"How did you resolve this conflict, don Juan?\" I asked with more than genuineinterest.\"I didn't resolve anything,\" he declared. \"It, the conflict or whatever, was theresult of the battle between my two minds. Every one of us human beings has twominds.One is a foreign installation. It brings us conflict, self-assertion, doubts,and hopelessness.The other mind is totally ours. It is like a faint voice that always brings usorder, directness, and purpose.\"My fixation on my own mental concatenations [* concatenation- the state of beinglinked together as in a chain] was so intense that I completely missed what donJuan had said. I could clearly remember every one of his words, but they had nomeaning for me.Don Juan looked directly into my eyes, and very calmly repeated what he had justsaid.I was still incapable of grasping what he meant. I couldn't focus my attentionon his words.\"For some strange reason, don Juan, I can't concentrate on what you're tellingme,\" I said.\"I understand perfectly why you can't,\" he said, smiling expansively, \"and sowill you someday at the same time that you resolve the conflict of whether youlike me or not; the day you cease to be the me-me center of the world.\"In the meantime,\" he continued, \"let's put the topic of our two minds aside,and go back to the idea of preparing your album of memorable events. \"I should add that such an album is an exercise in discipline and impartiality.Consider this album to be an act of war.\"Don Juan's assertion that my conflict of both liking and not liking to see himwas going to end whenever I abandoned my egocentrism, was no solution for me.In fact, that assertion made me angrier. It frustrated me all the more. And whenI heard don Juan speak of the album as an act of war, I lashed out at him withall my poison.I said in a tone of protest, \"The idea that this is a collection of events isalready hard to understand. On top of all this, when you call it an album andyou say that such an album is an act of war, that is too much for me. It's tooobscure. Being obscure makes the metaphor lose its meaning.\"Don Juan replied calmly, \"How strange! It's the opposite for me. Such an albumbeing an act of war has all the meaning in the world for me. I wouldn't like myalbum of memorable events to be anything but an act of war.\"I wanted to argue my point further and explain to him that I did understand theidea of an album of memorable events, but that I objected to the perplexing wayhe was describing it. I thought of myself in those days as an advocate ofclarity and functionalism in the use of language.Don Juan didn't comment on my belligerent mood. He only nodded his head as if hewere fully agreeing with me.After a while, I either completely ran out of energy, or I got a gigantic surgeof it. All of a sudden without any effort on my part, I realized the futility ofmy outbursts. I felt embarrassed no end.I asked don Juan in earnest, \"What possesses me to act the way I do?\"At that instant I was utterly baffled. I was so shaken by my realization thatwithout any volition [* volition- the capability of conscious choice] on mypart, I began to weep.Don Juan said reassuringly, \"Don't worry about stupid details. Every one of us,male and female, is like this.\"I asked, \"Do you mean, don Juan, that we are naturally petty and contradictory?\"\"No,\" he replied. \"We are not naturally petty and contradictory. Our pettinessand contradictions are, rather, the result of a conflict that afflicts every oneof us. But only sorcerers are painfully and hopelessly aware of the conflict ofour two minds.\"Don Juan peered at me. His eyes were like two black charcoals.I said, \"You've been telling me on and on about our two minds, but my braincan't register what you are saying. Why?\"\"You'll get to know why in due time,\" he said. \"For the present, it will besufficient that I repeat to you what I have said before about our two minds.\"One mind we use daily for everything we do is a foreign installation.\"The other is our true mind; the product of all our life experiences; the onethat rarely speaks because it has been defeated and relegated to obscurity.\"I said, \"I think that the crux of the matter is that the concept of the mindbeing a foreign installation is so outlandish that my mind refuses to take itseriously.\" I felt that I had made a real discovery.Don Juan did not comment on what I had said. He continued explaining the issueof the two minds as if I hadn't said a word. He said, \"To resolve the conflict of the two minds is a matter of intending it.\"\"Intent is a force that exists in the universe. Sorcerers beckon intent byvoicing the word intent loud and clear. When sorcerers beckon intent, it comesto them and sets up the path for attainment. In this way, sorcerers alwaysaccomplish what they set out to do.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that sorcerers get anything they want, even if it issomething petty and arbitrary?\" I asked.\"No, I didn't mean that. Intent can be called, of course, for anything,\" hereplied, \"but sorcerers have found out, the hard way, that intent comes to themonly for something that is abstract. That's the safety valve for sorcerers;otherwise they would be unbearable.\"In your case, beckoning intent to resolve the conflict of your two minds, or tohear the voice of your true mind is not a petty or arbitrary matter- quite thecontrary. It is ethereal and abstract, and yet as vital to you as anything canbe.\" Don Juan paused for a moment and then he began to talk again about the album.\"My own album,\" he said, \"being an act of war, demanded a super-carefulselection.\"It is now a precise collection of the unforgetable moments of my life, andeverything that led me to those moments. I have concentrated in my collectionwhat has been, and will be meaningful to me. In my opinion, a warrior's album issomething most concrete; something so to-the-point that it is shattering.\"I had no clue as to what don Juan wanted, and yet I did understand him toperfection.He advised me to sit down, alone, and let my thoughts, memories, and ideas cometo me freely.He recommended that I make an effort to let the voice from the depths of mespeak out and tell me what to select.Don Juan told me then to go inside the house and lie down on a bed that I hadthere. It was made of wooden boxes and dozens of empty burlap sacks that servedas a mattress. My whole body ached, and when I lay on the bed it was actuallyextremely comfortable. I took don Juan's suggestions to heart and began to think about my past; lookingfor events that had left a mark on me. I soon realized that my assertion thatevery event in my life had been meaningful was nonsense.As I pressed myself to recollect, I found that I didn't even know where tostart. Through my mind ran endless disassociated thoughts and memories of eventsthat had happened to me, but I couldn't decide whether or not they had had anymeaning for me.The impression I got was that nothing had had any significance whatsoever. Itlooked as if I had gone through life like a corpse empowered to walk and talk,but not to feel anything.Having no concentration whatsoever to pursue the subject beyond a shallowattempt, I gave up and fell asleep. \"Did you have any success?\" don Juan asked me when I woke up hours later.Instead of being at ease after sleeping and resting, I was again moody andbelligerent.\"No, I didn't have any success!\" I barked.\"Did you hear that voice from the depths of you?\" he asked.\"I think I did,\" I lied.\"What did it say to you?\" he inquired in an urgent tone.\"I can't think of it, don Juan,\" I muttered.\"Ah, you are back in your daily mind,\" he said and patted me forcefully on theback. \"Your daily mind has taken over again. Let's relax it by talking aboutyour collection of memorable events.\"I should tell you that the selection of what to put in your album is not aneasy matter. This is the reason I say that making this album is an act of war.You have to remake yourself ten times over in order to know what to select.\"I clearly understood then, if only for a second, that I had two minds. However,the thought was so vague that I lost it instantly.What remained was just the sensation of an incapacity to fulfill don Juan'srequirement. Instead of graciously accepting my incapacity, though, I allowed itto become a threatening affair.The driving force of my life in those days was to appear always in a good light.To be incompetent was the equivalent of being a loser; something that wasthoroughly intolerable to me. Since I didn't know how to respond to thechallenge don Juan was posing, I did the only thing I knew how to do: I gotangry.I said, \"I've got to think a great deal more about this, don Juan. I've got togive my mind some time to settle on the idea.\"\"Of course, of course,\" don Juan assured me. \"Take all the time in the world,but hurry.\"Nothing else was said about the subject at that time. At home, I forgot about the album completely. But one day quite abruptly in themiddle of a lecture I was attending, the imperious [* imperious- dealingauthoritatively with affairs] command to search for the memorable events of mylife hit me like a bodily jolt. A nervous spasm shook my entire body from headto toe.I began to work in earnest. It took me months to rehash experiences in my lifethat I believed were meaningful to me. However, upon examining my collection, Irealized that I was dealing only with ideas that had no substance whatsoever.The events I remembered were just vague points of reference that I rememberedabstractly.Once again, I had the most unsettling suspicion that I had been reared just toact without ever stopping to feel anything. One of the vaguest events I recalled which I wanted to make memorable at anycost was the day I found out I had been admitted to graduate school at UCLA.Yet no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remember what I had been doing thatday. There was nothing interesting or unique that I remembered about that day,except for the idea that it had to be memorable. Entering graduate school shouldhave made me happy or proud of myself, but it didn't.Another sample in my collection was the day I almost got married to Kay Condor.Her last name wasn't really Condor, but she had changed it because she wanted tobe an actress. Her ticket to fame was that she actually looked like CaroleLombard.That day was memorable in my mind not so much because of the events that tookplace, but because she was beautiful and wanted to marry me. She was a headtaller than I was which made her all the more interesting to me.I was thrilled with the idea of marrying a tall woman in a church ceremony. Irented a gray tuxedo. The pants were quite wide for my height. They were notbell-bottoms. They were just wide, and that bothered me no end.Another thing that annoyed me immensely was that the sleeves of the pink shirt Ihad bought for the occasion were about three inches too long. I had to userubber bands to hold them up.Outside of that, everything was perfect until the moment when the guests and Ifound out that Kay Condor had gotten cold feet, and wasn't going to show up.Being a very proper young lady, she had sent me a note of apology by motorcyclemessenger.She wrote that she didn't believe in divorce, and that she couldn't commitherself for the rest of her days to someone who didn't quite share her views onlife. She reminded me that I snickered every time I said the name 'Condor';something that showed a total lack of respect for her person.She said that she had discussed the matter with her mother. Both of them lovedme dearly, but not enough to make me part of their family. She added that,bravely and wisely, we all had to cut our losses.My state of mind had been one of total numbness.When I tried to recollect that day, I couldn't remember whether I felt horriblyhumiliated at being left standing in front of a lot of people in my gray, rentedtuxedo with the wide-legged pants, or whether I was crushed because Kay Condordidn't marry me. These were the only two events I was capable of isolating with clarity. Theywere meager examples, but after rehashing them, I had succeeded in re-dressingthem as tales of philosophical acceptance. I thought of myself as a being whogoes through life with no real feelings, who has only intellectual views ofeverything.Taking don Juan's metaphors as models, I even constructed one of my own: a beingwho lives his life vicariously in terms of what it should be.I believed, for instance, that the day I was admitted to graduate school at UCLAshould have been a memorable day. Since it wasn't, I tried my best to imbue itwith an importance I was far from feeling.A similar thing happened with the day I nearly married Kay Condor. It shouldhave been a devastating day for me, but it wasn't. At the moment of recollectingit, I knew that there was nothing there and began to work as hard as I could toconstruct what I should have felt. The next time I went to don Juan's house, I presented to him my two samples ofmemorable events as soon as I arrived.\"This is a pile of nonsense,\" he declared. \"None of it will do. The stories arerelated exclusively to you as a person who thinks, feels, cries, or doesn't feelanything at all.\"The memorable events of a shaman's album are affairs that will stand the testof time because they have nothing to do with him, and yet he is in the thick ofthem. He'll always be in the thick of them, for the duration of his life, andperhaps beyond, but not quite personally.\"His words left me feeling dejected; totally defeated. I sincerely believed inthose days that don Juan was an intransigent [* intransigent- impervious topleas, persuasion, requests, or reason] old man who found special delight inmaking me feel stupid.He reminded me of a master craftsman I had met at a sculptor's foundry where Iworked while going to art school. The master artisan used to criticize and findflaws with everything his advanced apprentices did, and would demand that theycorrect their work according to his recommendations.His apprentices would turn around, and pretend to correct their work. Iremembered the glee of the master when upon being presented with the same workhe would say, \"Now you have a real thing!\"Don Juan, shaking me out of my recollection, said, \"Don't feel bad. In my time,I was in the same spot. For years, not only did I not know what to choose, Ithought I had no experiences to choose from. It seemed that nothing had everhappened to me.\"Of course, everything had happened to me, but in my effort to defend the ideaof myself, I had no time or inclination to notice anything.\"\"Can you tell me, don Juan, specifically, what is wrong with my stories? I knowthat they are nothing, but the rest of my life is just like that.\"\"I will repeat this to you,\" he said. \"The stories of a warrior's album are notpersonal. Your story of the day you were admitted to school is nothing but yourassertion about you as the center of everything. You feel, you don't feel; yourealize, you don't realize. Do you see what I mean? All of the story is justyou.\"I asked, \"But how can it be otherwise, don Juan?\"\"In your other story, you almost touch on what I want, but you turn it againinto something extremely personal. I know that you could add more details, butall those details would be an extension of your person and nothing else.\"I protested, saying, \"I sincerely cannot see your point, don Juan. Every storyseen through the eyes of the witness has to be, perforce, personal.\"\"Yes, yes, of course,\" he said, smiling, delighted as usual by my confusion.\"But then they are not stories for a warrior's album. They are stories for otherpurposes.\"The memorable events we are after have the dark touch of the impersonal. Thattouch permeates them. I don't know how else to explain this.\"I believed then that I had a moment of inspiration, and that I understood whathe meant by the dark touch of the impersonal. I thought that he meant somethinga bit morbid, and darkness meant that for me.I related to him a story from my childhood. One of my older cousins was in medical school. He was an intern, and one day hetook me to the morgue. He assured me that a young man owed it to himself to seedead people because that sight was very educational. It demonstrated thetransitoriness of life.He harangued me, on and on, in order to convince me to go. The more he talkedabout how unimportant we were in death, the more curious I became. I had neverseen a corpse, and in the end, my curiosity to see one overwhelmed me and I wentwith him.He showed me various corpses and succeeded in scaring me stiff. I found nothingeducational or illuminating about them. They were, outright, the mostfrightening things I had ever seen.As he talked to me, he kept looking at his watch as if he were waiting forsomeone who was going to show up at any moment. He obviously wanted to keep mein the morgue longer than my strength permitted. Being the competitive creaturethat I was, I believed that he was testing my endurance; my manhood.I clenched my teeth, and made up my mind to stay until the bitter end. Thebitter end came in ways that I had not dreamed of.A corpse that was covered with a sheet actually moved up with a rattle on themarble table where all the corpses were lying as if it were getting ready to situp. It made a burping sound that was so awful that it burned through me, andwill remain in my memory for the rest of my life.My cousin, the doctor, the scientist, explained that it was the corpse of a manwho had died of tuberculosis, and that his lungs had been eaten away by bacillithat had left enormous holes filled with air. He said that in cases like this,when the air changed temperature, it sometimes forced the body to sit up or atleast convulse.\"No, you haven't gotten it yet,\" don Juan said, shaking his head from side toside. \"It is merely a story about your fear. I would have been scared to deathmyself. However, being scared like that doesn't illuminate anyone's path. ButI'm curious to know what happened to you.\"\"I yelled like a banshee,\" I said. \"My cousin called me a coward; ayellow-belly, for hiding my face against his chest, and for getting sick to mystomach all over him.\" I had definitely hooked on to a morbid strand in my life. I came up with anotherstory about a sixteen year old boy I knew in high school who had a glandulardisease and grew to a gigantic height. His heart did not grow at the same rateas the rest of his body and one day he died of heart failure.I went with another boy to the mortuary out of morbid curiosity. The mortician,who was perhaps more morbid than the two of us, opened the back door, and let usin. He showed us his masterpiece. He had put the gigantic boy, who had been overseven feet, seven inches tall, into a coffin for a normal person by sawing offhis legs. He showed us how he had arranged his legs as if the dead boy wereholding them with his arms like two trophies.The fright I experienced then was comparable to the fright I had experienced inthe morgue as a child, but this new fright was not a physical reaction. It was areaction of psychological revulsion.\"You're almost there,\" don Juan said. \"However, your story is still toopersonal. It's revolting. It makes me sick, but I see great potential.\"Don Juan and I laughed at the horror found in situations of everyday life. Bythen I was hopelessly lost in the morbid strands I had caught and released. I told him then the story of my best friend, Roy Goldpiss. He actually had aPolish surname, but his friends called him Goldpiss because whatever he touched,he turned to gold. He was a great businessman.His talent for business made him a super-ambitious being. He wanted to be therichest man in the world. However, he found that the competition was too tough.According to him, doing business alone he couldn't possibly compete, forinstance, with the head of an Islamic sect who, at that time, got paid hisweight in gold every year. The head of the sect would fatten himself as much ashis body allowed him before he was weighed.Then my friend Roy lowered his sights to being the richest man in the UnitedStates. The competition in this sector was ferocious.He went down a notch: Perhaps he could be the richest man in California. He wastoo late for that, too. He gave up hope that with his chains of pizza and icecream parlors, he could ever rise in the business world to compete with theestablished families who owned California.He settled for being the richest man in Woodland Hills, the suburb of LosAngeles where he lived. Unfortunately for him, down the street from his houselived Mr. Marsh, who owned factories that produced A-one quality mattresses allover the United States, and he was rich beyond belief.Roy's frustration knew no limits. His drive to accomplish was so intense that itfinally impaired his health. One day he died from an aneurysm in his brain.His death brought, as a consequence, my third visit to a morgue or a mortuary.Roy's wife begged me, as his best friend, to make sure that the corpse wasproperly dressed.I went to the funeral parlor where I was led by a male secretary to the innerchambers. At the precise moment I arrived, the mortician was at a highmarble-topped table working on Roy's corpse which had already entered rigormortis.The mortician was forcefully pushing up the corners of the upper lip with theindex and little finger of his right hand while he held his middle fingeragainst his palm. As a grotesque smile appeared on Roy's dead face, themortician half-turned to me, and said in a servile tone, \"I hope all this is toyour satisfaction, sir.\"Roy's wife- it will never be known whether she liked him or not- decided to buryhim with all the garishness that, in her opinion, his life deserved. She hadbought a very expensive coffin; a custom-made affair that looked like atelephone booth. She had gotten the idea from a movie. Roy was going to beburied sitting, as if he were making a business call on the telephone.I didn't stay for the ceremony. I left in the midst of a most violent reaction;a mixture of impotence and anger; the kind of anger that couldn't be vented onanyone. \"You certainly are morbid today,\" don Juan commented, laughing. \"But in spite ofthat, or perhaps because of that, you're almost there. You're touching it.\"I never ceased to marvel at the way in which my mood changed every time I wentto see don Juan. I always arrived moody, grouchy, filled with self-assertionsand doubts. After a while, my mood would mysteriously change, and I would becomemore expansive by degrees until I was as calm as I had ever been.However, my new mood was always couched in my old vocabulary, and my usual wayof talking then was that of a totally dissatisfied person who is containinghimself from complaining out loud, but whose endless complaints are implied atevery turn of the conversation.\"Can you give me an example of a memorable event from your album, don Juan?\" Iasked in my habitual tone of veiled complaint. \"If I knew the pattern you wereafter, I might be able to come up with something. As it is, I am whistlinghopelessly in the dark.\"\"Don't explain yourself so much,\" don Juan said with a stern look in his eyes.\"Sorcerers say that in every explanation there is a hidden apology. So, when youare explaining why you cannot do this or that, you're really apologizing foryour shortcomings; hoping that whoever is listening to you will have thekindness to understand them.\"My most useful maneuver, when I was attacked, had always been to turn myattackers off by not listening to them. Don Juan, however, had the disgustingability to trap every bit of my attention. No matter how he attacked me, nomatter what he said, he always managed to have me riveted to his every word.On this occasion, what he was saying about me didn't please me at all because itwas the naked truth.I avoided his eyes. I felt, as usual, defeated, but it was a peculiar defeatthis time. It didn't bother me as it would have if it had happened in the worldof everyday life, or right after I had arrived at his house. After a very long silence, don Juan spoke to me again. \"I'll do better than giveyou an example of a memorable event from my album,\" he said. \"I'll give you amemorable event from your own life; one that should go for sure in yourcollection. Or I should say, if I were you, I would certainly put it in mycollection of memorable events.\"I thought don Juan was joking and I laughed stupidly.He said cuttingly, \"This is not a laughing matter. I am serious. You once toldme a story that fits the bill.\"\"What story is that, don Juan?\"\"The story of 'figures in front of a mirror,'\" he said. \"Tell me that storyagain. But tell it to me in all the detail you can remember.\"I began to retell the story in a cursory fashion.He stopped me and demanded a careful, detailed narration, starting at thebeginning.I tried again, but my rendition didn't satisfy him.\"Let's go for a walk,\" he proposed. \"When you walk, you are much more accuratethan when you're sitting down. It is not an idle idea that you should pace backand forth when you try to relate something.\"We had been sitting, as we usually did during the day, under the house ramada. Ihad developed a pattern: Whenever I sat there, I always did it on the same spotwith my back against the wall. Don Juan sat in various places under the ramada,but never on the same spot.We went for a hike at the worst time of the day; noon. He outfitted me with anold straw hat as he always did whenever we went out in the heat of the sun.We walked for a long time in complete silence. I tried to the best of my abilityto force myself to remember all the details of the story. It was mid afternoonwhen we sat down under the shade of some tall bushes, and I retold the fullstory. Years before, while I was studying sculpture in a fine arts school in Italy, Ihad a close friend, Eddie; a Scotsman who was studying art in order to become anart critic.What stood out most vividly in my mind about him, and had to do with the story Iwas telling don Juan, was the bombastic idea he had of himself. He thought hewas the most licentious, [* Licentious- lacking moral discipline; especiallysexually unrestrained] lusty, all-around scholar and craftsman; a man of theRenaissance. Licentious he was, but lustiness was something in completecontradiction to his bony, dry, serious person.He was a vicarious follower of the English philosopher Bertrand Russell anddreamed of applying the principles of logical positivism to art criticism. To bean all-around scholar and craftsman was perhaps his wildest fantasy because hewas a procrastinator. [* procrastinator- someone who postpones work especiallyout of laziness or habitual carelessness] Work was his nemesis. [* nemesis-something causing misery or death]His dubious specialty wasn't art criticism, but rather his personal knowledge ofall the prostitutes of the local bordellos of which there were plenty. Thecolorful and lengthy accounts he used to give me- in order to keep me, accordingto him, up to date about all the marvelous things he did in the world of hisspecialty- were delightful. It was not surprising to me, therefore, that one dayhe came to my apartment, all excited, nearly out of breath, and told me thatsomething extraordinary had happened to him and that he wanted to share it withme.\"I say, old man, you must see this for yourself!\" he said excitedly in theOxford accent he affected every time he talked to me. He paced the roomnervously. \"It's hard to describe, but I know it's something you willappreciate. Something the impression of which will last you for a lifetime. I amgoing to give you a marvelous gift for life. Do you understand?\"I understood that he was a hysterical Scotsman. It was always my pleasure tohumor him and tag along. I had never regretted it.\"Calm down, calm down, Eddie,\" I said. \"What are you trying to tell me?\"He related to me that he had been in a bordello, where he had found anunbelievable woman who did an incredible thing she called 'figures in front of amirror'. He assured me repeatedly, almost stuttering, that I owed it to myselfto experience this unbelievable event personally.\"I say, don't worry about money!\" he said, since he knew I didn't have any.\"I've already paid the price. All you have to do is go with me. Madame Ludmillawill show you her 'figures in front of a mirror.' It's a blast!\"In a fit of uncontrollable glee, Eddie laughed uproariously, oblivious to hisbad teeth, which he normally hid behind a tight-lipped smile or laugh. \"I say,it's absolutely great!\"My curiosity mounted by the minute. I was more than willing to participate inhis new delight. Eddie drove me to the outskirts of the city.We stopped in front of a dusty, badly kept building. The paint was peeling offthe walls. It had the air of having been a hotel at one time; a hotel that hadbeen turned into an apartment building. I could see the remnants of a hotel signthat seemed to have been ripped to pieces. On the front of the building therewere rows of dirty single balconies filled with flowerpots, or draped withcarpets put out to dry.At the entrance to the building were two dark, shady-looking men wearing pointedblack shoes that seemed too tight on their feet. They greeted Eddie effusively.They had black, shifty, menacing eyes. Both of them were wearing shinylight-blue suits, also too tight for their bulky bodies.One of them opened the door for Eddie. They didn't even look at me.We went up two flights of stairs on a dilapidated staircase that at one timemust have been luxurious.Eddie led the way and walked the length of an empty, hotel-like corridor withdoors on both sides. All the doors were painted in the same drab, dark, olivegreen. Every door had a brass number tarnished with age, and barely visibleagainst the painted wood.Eddie stopped in front of a door. I noticed the number 112 on it. He rappedrepeatedly. The door opened, and a round, short woman with bleached-blonde hairbeckoned us in without saying a word. She was wearing a red silk robe withfeathery, flouncy sleeves and red slippers with furry balls on top. Once we wereinside a small hall, and she had closed the door behind us, she greeted Eddie interribly accented English. \"Hallo, Eddie. You brought friend, eh?\"Eddie shook her hand, and then kissed it, gallantly. He acted as if he were mostcalm, yet I noticed his unconscious gestures of being ill at ease.\"How are you today, Madame Ludmilla?\" he said, trying to sound like an Americanand flubbing it.I never discovered why Eddie always wanted to sound like an American whenever hewas transacting business in those houses of ill repute. I had the suspicion thathe did it because Americans were known to be wealthy, and he wanted to establishhis rich man's bona fides with them.Eddie turned to me and said in his phony American accent, \"I leave you in goodhands, kiddo.\"He sounded so awful, so foreign to my ears, that I laughed out loud. MadameLudmilla didn't seem perturbed at all by my explosion of mirth. Eddie kissedMadame Ludmilla's hand again, and left.\"You speak English, my boy?\" she shouted as if I were deaf. \"You look Eyipcian,or perhaps Torkish.\"I assured Madame Ludmilla that I was neither, and that I did speak English. Sheasked me then if I fancied her 'figures in front of a mirror'. I didn't knowwhat to say. I just nodded my head affirmatively.\"I give you good show,\" she assured me. \"Figures in front of a mirror is onlyforeplay. When you are hot and ready, tell me to stop.\"From the small hall where we were standing we walked into a dark and eerie room.The windows were heavily curtained. There were some low-voltage light bulbs onfixtures attached to the wall. The bulbs were shaped like tubes and protrudedstraight out at right angles from the wall.There was a profusion of objects around the room: pieces of furniture like smallchests of drawers, antique tables and chairs, a roll-top desk set against thewall crammed with papers, pencils, rulers, and at least a dozen pairs ofscissors. Madame Ludmilla made me sit down on an old stuffed chair.\"The bed is in the other room, darling,\" she said, pointing to the other side ofthe room. \"This is my antisala. Here I give show to get you hot and ready.\"She dropped her red robe, kicked off her slippers, and opened the double doorsof two armoires standing side by side against the wall. Attached to the insideof each door was a full-length mirror.\"And now the music, my boy,\" Madame Ludmilla said, then cranked a Victrola thatappeared to be in mint condition, shiny, like new. She put on a record. Themusic was a haunting melody that reminded me of a circus march.\"And now my show,\" she said, and began to twirl around to the accompaniment ofthe haunting melody. The skin of Madame Ludmilla's body was tight, for the mostpart, and extraordinarily white; though she was not young. She must have been inher well-lived late forties.Her belly sagged, not a great deal, but a bit, and so did her voluminousbreasts. The skin of her face also sagged into noticeable jowls. She had a smallnose and heavily painted red lips. She wore thick black mascara. She brought tomind the prototype of an aging prostitute. Yet there was something childlikeabout her; a girlish abandon and trust; a sweetness that jolted me.\"And now, figures in front of a mirror,\" Madame Ludmilla announced while themusic continued.\"Leg, leg, leg!\" she said, kicking one leg up in the air, and then the other, intime with the music. She had her right hand on top of her head, like a littlegirl who is not sure that she can perform the movements.\"Turn, turn, turn!\" she said, turning like a top.\"Butt, butt, butt!\" she said then, showing me her bare behind like a cancandancer.She repeated the sequence over and over until the music began to fade when theVictrola's spring wound down. I had the feeling that Madame Ludmilla wastwirling away into the distance, becoming smaller and smaller as the musicfaded.Some despair and loneliness that I didn't know existed in me came to the surfacefrom the depths of my very being. It made me get up and run like a madman out ofthe room, down the stairs, out of the building, and into the street.Eddie was standing outside the door talking to the two men in light-blue shinysuits. Seeing me running like that, he began to laugh uproariously.\"Wasn't it a blast?\" he said, still trying to sound like an American. \"'Figuresin front of a mirror is only the foreplay.' What a thing! What a thing!\" The first time I had mentioned the story to don Juan, I had told him that I hadbeen deeply affected by the haunting melody and the old prostitute clumsilytwirling to the music; and I had been deeply affected also by the realization ofhow callous my friend was.When I had finished retelling my story to don Juan as we sat in the hills of arange of mountains in Sonora, I was shaking; mysteriously affected by somethingquite undefined.\"That story,\" don Juan said, \"should go in your album of memorable events. Yourfriend, without having any idea of what he was doing, gave you, as he himselfsaid, something that will indeed last you for a lifetime.\"I declared, \"I see this as a sad story, don Juan, but that's all.\"Don Juan replied, \"It is indeed a sad story, just like your other stories; butwhat makes it different and memorable to me is that it touches every one of ushuman beings; not just you, like your other tales.\"You see, like Madame Ludmilla, every one of us, young and old alike, is makingfigures in front of a mirror in one way or another. Tally what you know aboutpeople. Think of any human being on this earth, and you will know, without theshadow of a doubt, that no matter who they are, or what they think ofthemselves, or what they do, the result of their actions is always the same:senseless figures in front of a mirror.\" ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"A Tremor in the Air "},{"pageContent":"A Journey of PowerAt the time I met don Juan, I was a fairly studious anthropology student, and Iwanted to begin my career as a professional anthropologist by publishing as muchas possible. I was bent on climbing the academic ladder, and in my calculations,I had determined that the first step was to collect data on the uses ofmedicinal plants by the Indians of the southwestern United States. I first asked a professor of anthropology who had worked in that area for adviceabout my project. He was a prominent ethnologist [* ethnologist- ananthropologist who studies the division of humankind into races, their originsand distribution, and their distinctive characteristics] who had publishedextensively in the late thirties and early forties on the California Indians andthe Indians of the Southwest and Sonora, Mexico. He patiently listened to myexposition.My idea was to write a paper, call it 'Ethnobotanical Data', and publish it in ajournal that dealt exclusively with anthropological issues of the southwesternUnited States.I proposed to collect medicinal plants, take the samples to the Botanical Gardenat UCLA to be properly identified, and then describe why and how the Indians ofthe Southwest used them. I envisioned collecting thousands of entries. I evenenvisioned publishing a small encyclopedia on the subject.The professor smiled forgivingly at me. \"I don't want to dampen yourenthusiasm,\" he said in a tired voice, \"but I can't help commenting negativelyon your eagerness. Eagerness is welcome in anthropology, but it must be properlychanneled. We are still in the golden age of anthropology.\"It was my luck to study with Alfred Krober and Robert Lowie, two pillars ofsocial science. I haven't betrayed their trust. Anthropology is still the masterdiscipline. Every other discipline should stem from anthropology.\"The entire field of history, for example, should be called 'historicalanthropology,' and the field of philosophy should be called 'philosophicalanthropology.' Man should be the measure of everything. Therefore, anthropology,the study of man, should be the core of every other discipline. Someday, itwill.\"I looked at him, bewildered. He was, in my estimation, a totally passive,benevolent old professor who had recently had a heart attack. I seemed to havestruck a chord of passion in him.He continued, saying, \"Don't you think that you should pay more attention toyour formal studies? Rather than doing fieldwork, wouldn't it be better for youto study linguistics? We have in the department here one of the most prominentlinguists in the world. If I were you, I'd be sitting at his feet, catching anydrift emanating from him.\"We also have a superb authority in comparative religions. And there are someexceptionally competent anthropologists here who have done work on kinshipsystems in cultures all over the world from the point of view of linguistics,and from the point of view of cognition. You need a lot of preparation. To thinkthat you could do fieldwork now is a travesty. Plunge into your books, youngman. That's my advice.\" Stubbornly, I took my proposition to another professor; a younger one. He wasn'tin any way more helpful. He laughed at me openly. He told me that the paper Iwanted to write was a Mickey Mouse paper, and that it wasn't anthropology by anystretch of the imagination.\"Anthropologists nowadays,\" he said professorially, \"are concerned with issuesthat have relevance. Medical and pharmaceutical scientists have done endlessresearch on every possible medicinal plant in the world. There's no longer anybone to chew on there. Your kind of data collecting belongs to the turn of thenineteenth century. Now it's nearly two hundred years later. There is such athing as progress, you know.\"Then he proceeded to give me a definition and a justification of progress andperfectibility as two issues of philosophical discourse which he said were mostrelevant to anthropology.\"Anthropology is the only discipline in existence,\" he continued, \"which canclearly substantiate the concept of perfectibility and progress. Thank God thatthere's still a ray of hope in the midst of the cynicism of our times.\"Only anthropology can show the actual development of culture and socialorganization. Only anthropologists can prove to mankind beyond the shadow of adoubt the progress of human knowledge. Culture evolves, and only anthropologistscan present samples of societies that fit definite cubbyholes in a line ofprogress and perfectibility.\"That's anthropology for you! Not some puny fieldwork, which is not fieldwork atall, but mere masturbation.\" It was a blow on the head to me. As a last resort, I went to Arizona to talk toanthropologists who were actually doing field work there. By then, I was readyto give up on the whole idea. I understood what the two professors were tryingto tell me. I couldn't have agreed with them more. My attempts at doingfieldwork were definitely simpleminded.Yet I wanted to get my feet wet in the field. I didn't want to do only libraryresearch.In Arizona, I met with an extremely seasoned anthropologist who had writtencopiously on the Yaqui Indians of Arizona as well as those of Sonora, Mexico. Hewas extremely kind. He didn't run me down, nor did he give me any advice. Heonly commented that the Indian societies of the Southwest were extremelyisolationist, and that foreigners, especially those of Hispanic origin, weredistrusted, even abhorred, by those Indians. A younger colleague of his, however, was more outspoken. He said that I wasbetter off reading herbalists' books. He was an authority in the field, and hisopinion was that anything to be known about medicinal plants from the Southwesthad already been classified and talked about in various publications.He went as far as to say that the sources of any Indian curer of the day wereprecisely those publications rather than any traditional knowledge. He finishedme off with the assertion that if there still were any traditional curingpractices, the Indians would not divulge them to a stranger.\"Do something worthwhile,\" he advised me. \"Look into urban anthropology. There'sa lot of money for studies on alcoholism among Indians in the big city, forexample. Now that's something that any anthropologist can do easily. Go and getdrunk with local Indians in a bar.\"Then arrange whatever you find out about them in terms of statistics. Turneverything into numbers. Urban anthropology is a real field.\" There was nothing else for me to do except to take the advice of thoseexperienced social scientists. I decided to fly back to Los Angeles, but anotheranthropologist friend of mine named Bill let me know then that he was going todrive throughout Arizona and New Mexico, visiting all the places where he haddone work in the past, renewing in this fashion his relationships with thepeople who had been his anthropological informants.\"You're welcome to come with me,\" he said. \"I'm not going to do any work. I'mjust going to visit with them, have a few drinks with them, bullshit with them.I bought gifts for them- blankets, booze, jackets, ammunition for twenty-twocaliber rifles. My car is loaded with goodies.\"I usually drive alone whenever I go to see them, but by myself I always run therisk of falling asleep. You could keep me company, keep me from dozing off, ordrive a little bit if I'm too drunk.\"I felt so despondent that I turned him down.\"I'm very sorry, Bill,\" I said. \"The trip won't do for me, I see no point inpursuing this idea of fieldwork any longer.\"\"Don't give up without a fight,\" Bill said in a tone of paternal concern. \"Giveall you have to the fight, and if it licks you, then it's okay to give up, butnot before. Come with me and see how you like the Southwest.\"He put his arm around my shoulders. I couldn't help noticing how immensely heavyhis arm was. He was tall and husky, but in recent years his body had acquired astrange rigidity. He had lost his boyish quality. His round face was no longerfilled, youthful, the way it had been. Now it was a worried face.I believed that he worried because he was losing his hair, but at times itseemed to me that it was something more than that. And it wasn't that he wasfatter. His body was heavy in ways that were impossible to explain. I noticed itin the way that he walked, and got up, and sat down. Bill seemed to me to befighting gravity with every fiber of his being, in everything he did.Disregarding my feelings of defeat, I started on a journey with him. We visitedevery place in Arizona and New Mexico where there were Indians.One of the end results of this trip was that I found out that my anthropologistfriend had two definite facets to his person. He explained to me that hisopinions as a professional anthropologist were very measured, and congruous withthe anthropological thought of the day, but that as a private person, hisanthropological fieldwork had given him a wealth of experiences that he nevertalked about. These experiences were not congruous with the anthropologicalthought of the day because they were events that were impossible to catalog.During the course of our trip, he would invariably have some drinks with hisex-informants, and feel very relaxed afterward. I would take the wheel then anddrive as he sat in the passenger seat taking sips from his bottle of thirty yearold Ballantine's. It was then that Bill would talk about his uncatalogedexperiences.\"I have never believed in ghosts,\" he said abruptly one day. \"I never went infor apparitions and floating essences; voices in the dark. You know. I had avery pragmatic, serious upbringing. Science had always been my compass.\"But then, working in the field, all kinds of weird crap began to filter throughto me. For instance, I went with some Indians one night on a vision quest. Theywere going to actually initiate me by some painful business of piercing themuscles of my chest. They were preparing a sweat lodge in the woods.\"I had resigned myself to withstand the pain. I took a couple of drinks to giveme strength. And then the man who was going to intercede for me with the peoplewho actually performed the ceremony, yelled in horror, and pointed at a dark,shadowy figure walking toward us.\"When the shadowy figure came closer to me,\" Bill went on, \"I noticed that whatI had in front of me was an old Indian dressed in the weirdest getup you couldimagine. He had the parapherna of shamans. The man I was with that night faintedshamelessly at the sight of the old man.\"The old man came to me and pointed a finger at my chest. His finger was justskin and bone. He babbled incomprehensible things to me. By then, the rest ofthe people had seen the old man, and started to rush silently toward me.\"The old man turned to look at them, and every one of them froze. He haranguedthem for a moment. His voice was something unforgettable. It was as if he weretalking from a tube, or as if he had something attached to his mouth thatcarried the words out of him. I swear to you that I saw the man talking insidehis body, and his mouth broadcasting the words as a mechanical apparatus.\"After haranguing the men, the old man continued walking, past me, past them,and disappeared, swallowed by the darkness.\"Bill said that the plan to have an initiation ceremony went to pot. It was neverperformed; and the men, including the shamans in charge, were shaking in theirboots. He stated that they were so frightened that they disbanded and left.\"People who had been friends for years,\" Bill went on, \"never spoke to eachother again. They claimed that what they had seen was the apparition of anincredibly old shaman, and that it would bring bad luck to talk about it amongthemselves. In fact, they said that the mere act of setting eyes on one anotherwould bring them bad luck. Most of them moved away from the area.\"\"Why did they feel that talking to each other or seeing each other would bringthem bad luck?\" I asked him.\"Those are their beliefs,\" he replied. \"A vision of that nature means to themthat the apparition spoke to each of them individually. To have a vision of thatnature is, for them, the luck of a lifetime.\"\"And what was the individual thing that the vision told each of them?\" I asked.\"Beats me,\" he replied. \"They never explained anything to me. Every time I askedthem, they entered into a profound state of numbness. They hadn't seen anything;they hadn't heard anything.\"Years after the event, the man who had fainted next to me swore to me that hehad just faked the faint because he was so frightened that he didn't want toface the old man; and that what the old man had to say was understood byeverybody at a level other than language comprehension.\"Bill said that in his case, what the apparition voiced to him he understood ashaving to do with his health and his expectations in life.\"What do you mean by that?\" I asked him.\"Things are not that good for me,\" he confessed. \"My body doesn't feel well.\"\"But do you know what is really the matter with you?\" I asked.\"Oh, yes,\" he said nonchalantly. \"Doctors have told me. But I'm not gonna worryabout it, or even think about it.\"Bill's revelations left me feeling thoroughly uneasy. This was a facet of hisperson that I didn't know. I had always thought that he was a tough old cookie.I could never conceive of him as vulnerable. I didn't like our exchange. It was,however, too late for me to retreat. Our trip continued. On another occasion, he confided that the shamans of the Southwest were capableof transforming themselves into different entities, and that the categorizationschemes of 'bear shaman', or 'mountain lion shaman', etc., should not be takenas euphemisms or metaphors because they were not.\"Would you believe it,\" he said in a tone of great admiration, \"that there aresome shamans who actually become bears, or mountain lions, or eagles? I'm notexaggerating, nor am I fabricating anything when I say that once I witnessed thetransformation of a shaman who called himself 'River Man', or 'River Shaman', or'Proceeding from River: Returning to River.'\"I was out in the mountains of New Mexico with this shaman. I was driving forhim. He trusted me, and he was going in search of his origin- or so he said. Wewere walking along a river when he suddenly got very excited. He told me to moveaway from the shore to some high rocks, and hide there; put a blanket over myhead and shoulders, and peek through it so I would not miss what he was about todo.\"\"What was he going to do?\" I asked him, incapable of containing myself.\"I didn't know,\" he said. \"Your guess would have been as good as mine. I had noway of conceiving of what he was going to do. He just walked into the water,fully dressed. When the water reached him at mid-calf, because it was a wide butshallow river, the shaman simply vanished; disappeared.\"Prior to entering the water, he had whispered in my ear that I should godownstream and wait for him. He told me the exact spot to wait. I, of course,didn't believe a word of what he was saying, so at first I couldn't rememberwhere he had said I had to wait for him, but then I found the spot and I saw theshaman coming out of the water. It sounds stupid to say 'coming out of thewater.' I saw the shaman turning into water and then being remade out of thewater. Can you believe that?\"I had no comments on his stories. It was impossible for me to believe him, but Icould not disbelieve him either. He was a very serious man. The only possibleexplanation that I could think of was that as we continued our trip he drankmore and more every day. He had in the trunk of the car a box of twenty-fourbottles of Scotch for only himself. He actually drank like a fish.\"I have always been partial to the esoteric mutations of shamans,\" he said to meanother day. \"It's not that I can explain the mutations, or even believe thatthey take place, but as an intellectual exercise I am very interested inconsidering that mutations into snakes and mountain lions are not as difficultas what the water shaman did.\"It is at moments like this, when I engage my intellect in such a fashion, thatI cease to be an anthropologist and I begin to react, following a gut feeling.My gut feeling is that those shamans certainly do something that can't bemeasured scientifically or even talked about intelligently.\"For instance, there are cloud shamans who turn into clouds, into mist. I havenever seen this happen, but I knew a cloud shaman. I never saw him disappearingor turning into mist in front of my eyes as I saw that other shaman turning intowater right in front of me. But I chased that cloud shaman once, and he simplyvanished in an area where there was no place for him to hide. Although I didn'tsee him turning into a cloud, he disappeared. I couldn't explain where he went.There were no rocks or vegetation around the place where he ended up. I wasthere half a minute after he was, but the shaman was gone.\"I chased that man all over the place for information,\" Bill went on. \"Hewouldn't give me the time of day. He was very friendly to me, but that was all.\" Bill told me endless other stories about strife and political factions amongIndians in different Indian reservations; or stories about personal vendettas,animosities, friendships, etc., etc., which did not interest me in the least.On the other hand, his stories about shamans' mutations and apparitions hadcaused a true emotional upheaval in me. I was at once both fascinated andappalled by them. However, when I tried to think about why I was fascinated orappalled, I couldn't tell. All I could have said was that his stories aboutshamans hit me at an unknown, visceral [* visceral- obtained through intuitionrather than from reasoning or observation] level.Another realization brought by this trip was that I verified for myself that theIndian societies of the Southwest were indeed closed to outsiders. I finallycame to accept that I did need a great deal of preparation in the science ofanthropology, and that it was more functional to do anthropological fieldwork inan area with which I was familiar, or one in which I had an entree. When the journey ended, Bill drove me to the Greyhound bus depot in Nogales,Arizona, for my return trip to Los Angeles. As we were sitting in the waitingarea before the bus came, he consoled me in a paternal manner, reminding me thatfailures were a matter of course in anthropological fieldwork, and that theymeant only the hardening of one's purpose, or the coming to maturity of ananthropologist.Abruptly, he leaned over and pointed with a slight movement of his chin to theother side of the room. \"I think that old man sitting on the bench by the cornerover there is the man I told you about,\" he whispered in my ear. \"I am not quitesure because I've had him in front of me, face-to-face, only once.\"\"What man is that? What did you tell me about him?\" I asked.\"When we were talking about shamans and shamans' transformations, I told youthat I had once met a cloud shaman.\"\"Yes, yes, I remember that,\" I said. \"Is that man the cloud shaman?\"\"No,\" he said emphatically. \"But I think he is a companion or a teacher of thecloud shaman. I saw both of them together in the distance various times, manyyears ago.\"I did remember Bill mentioning in a very casual manner, although not in relationto the cloud shaman, that he knew about the existence of a mysterious old manwho was a retired shaman; an old Indian misanthrope [* misanthrope- someone whodislikes people in general] from Yuma who had once been a terrifying sorcerer.The relationship of the old man to the cloud shaman was never voiced by myfriend, but obviously it was foremost in Bill's mind to the point where hebelieved that he had told me about him.A strange anxiety suddenly possessed me and made me jump out of my seat. As if Ihad no volition of my own, I approached the old man and immediately began a longtirade on how much I knew about medicinal plants and shamanism among theAmerican Indians of the plains and their Siberian ancestors.As a secondary theme, I mentioned to the old man that I knew that he was ashaman. I concluded by assuring him that it would be thoroughly beneficial forhim to talk to me at length.\"If nothing else,\" I said petulantly, [* petulanty- in an easily irritated orannoyed manner] \"we could swap stories. You tell me yours and I'll tell youmine.\"The old man kept his eyes lowered until the last moment. Then he peered at me.\"I am Juan Matus,\" he said, looking me squarely in the eyes.My tirade shouldn't have ended by any means, but for no reason that I coulddiscern, I felt that there was nothing more I could have said. I wanted to tellhim my name. He raised his hand to the height of my lips as if to prevent mefrom saying it.At that instant, a bus pulled up to the bus stop. The old man muttered that itwas the bus he had to take, then he earnestly asked me to look him up so wecould talk with more ease and swap stories. There was an ironic smirk on thecomer of his mouth when he said that.With an incredible agility for a man his age- I figured he must have been in hiseighties- he covered, in a few leaps, the fifty yards between the bench where hewas sitting and the door of the bus. As if the bus had stopped just to pick himup, it moved away as soon as he had jumped in and the door had closed.After the old man left, I went back to the bench where Bill was sitting.\"What did he say, what did he say?\" he asked excitedly.\"He told me to look him up, and come to his house to visit,\" I said. \"He evensaid that we could talk there.\"\"But what did you say to him to get him to invite you to his house?\" hedemanded.I told Bill that I had used my best sales pitch, and that I had promised the oldman to reveal to him everything I knew from the point of view of my readingabout medicinal plants.Bill obviously didn't believe me. He accused me of holding out on him. \"I knowthe people around this area,\" he said belligerently, \"and that old man is a verystrange fart. He doesn't talk to anybody, Indians included. Why would he talk toyou; a perfect stranger? You're not even cute!\"It was obvious that Bill was annoyed with me. I couldn't figure out why though.I didn't dare ask him for an explanation. He gave me the impression of being abit jealous. Perhaps he felt that I had succeeded where he had failed.However, my success had been so inadvertent that it didn't mean anything to me.Except for Bill's casual remarks, I didn't have any conception of how difficultit was to approach that old man, and I couldn't have cared less. At the time, Ifound nothing remarkable in the exchange. It baffled me that Bill was so upsetabout it.\"Do you know where his house is?\" I asked him.\"I haven't the foggiest idea,\" he answered curtly. \"I have heard people fromthis area say that he doesn't live anywhere, that he just appears here and thereunexpectedly, but that's a lot of horse-shit. He probably lives in some shack inNogales, Mexico.\"\"Why is he so important?\" I asked him. My question made me gather enough courageto add, \"You seem to be upset because he talked to me. Why?\"Without any ado, he admitted that he was chagrined because he knew how uselessit was to try to talk to that man. \"That old man is as rude as anyone can be,\"he added. \"At best, he stares at you without saying a word when you talk to him.At other times, he doesn't even look at you. He treats you as if you didn'texist.\"The one time I tried to talk to him, he brutally turned me down. Do you knowwhat he said to me? He said, 'If I were you, I wouldn't waste my energy openingmy mouth. Save it. You need it.' If he weren't such an old fart, I would havepunched him in the nose.\"I pointed out to Bill that to call him an 'old' man was more a figure of speechthan an actual description.The Indian didn't really appear to be that old, although he was definitely old.He possessed a tremendous vigor and agility. I felt that Bill would have failedmiserably if he had tried to punch him in the nose. That old Indian waspowerful. In fact, he was downright scary.I didn't voice my thoughts. I let Bill go on telling me how disgusted he was atthe nastiness of that old man, and how he would have dealt with him had it notbeen for the fact that the old man was so feeble.\"Who do you think could give me some information about where he might live?\" Iasked him.\"Perhaps some people in Yuma,\" he replied, a bit more relaxed. \"Maybe the peopleI introduced you to at the beginning of our trip. You wouldn't lose anything byasking them. Tell them that I sent you to them.\" I changed my plans right then and instead of going back to Los Angeles, I wentdirectly to Yuma, Arizona. I saw the people to whom Bill had introduced me. Theydidn't know where the old Indian lived, but their comments about him inflamed mycuriosity even more.They said that he was not from Yuma, but from Sonora, Mexico, and that in hisyouth he had been a fearsome sorcerer who did incantations and put spells onpeople; but that he had mellowed with age, turning into an ascetic [* ascetic-someone who practices self denial as a spiritual discipline] hermit.They remarked that although he was a Yaqui Indian, he had once run around with agroup of Mexican men who seemed to be extremely knowledgeable about bewitchingpractices. They all agreed that they hadn't seen those men in the area for ages.One of the men added that the old man was contemporaneous with his grandfather,but that while his grandfather was senile and bedridden, the sorcerer seemed tobe more vigorous than ever. The same man referred me to some people inHermosillo, the capital of Sonora, who might know the old man and who might beable to tell me more about him. The prospect of going to Mexico was not at all appealing to me. Sonora was toofar away from my area of interest. Besides, I reasoned that I was better offdoing urban anthropology after all, and I went back to Los Angeles. But beforeleaving for Los Angeles, I canvassed the area of Yuma, searching for informationabout the old man. No one knew anything about him.As the bus drove to Los Angeles, I experienced a unique sensation. On the onehand, I felt totally cured of my obsession with fieldwork or my interest in theold man. On the other hand, I felt a strange nostalgia. It was, truthfully,something I had never felt before. Its newness struck me profoundly.It was a mixture of anxiety and longing, as if I were missing something oftremendous importance. I had the clear sensation as I approached Los Angelesthat whatever had been acting on me around Yuma had begun to fade with distance;but its fading only increased my unwarranted longing. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Intent of Infinity\"I want you\", don Juan said to me, \"to think deliberately about every detail ofwhat transpired between you and those two men, Jorge Campos and Lucas Coronado,who are the ones who really delivered you to me; and then tell me all about it.\"I found his request very difficult to fulfill, and yet I actually enjoyedremembering everything those two had said to me. Don Juan wanted every detailpossible; something that forced me to push my memory to its limits. In Yuma, Arizona, I had been given the names and addresses of some people inMexico who, I was told, might be able to shed light on the mystery of the oldman I had met in the bus depot.The story don Juan wanted me to recollect began in the city of to Guaymas, inSonora, Mexico.The people I went to see not only didn't know any retired old shaman, they evendoubted that such a man had ever existed.They were all filled to the brim, however, with scary stories about Yaquishamans, and about the belligerent general mood of the Yaqui Indians.They insinuated that perhaps in Vicam, a railroad-station town between thecities of Guaymas and Ciudad Obregon, I might find someone who could perhapssteer me in the proper direction.I asked them, \"Is there anyone in particular I could look up?\"One of the men suggested, \"Your best bet would be to talk to a field inspectorof the official government bank. The bank has a lot of field inspectors. Theyknow all the Indians of the area because the bank is the government institutionthat buys their crops. Every Yaqui is a farmer, and the proprietor of a parcelof land that he can call his own as long as he cultivates it.\"I asked, \"Do you know any field inspectors?\"They looked at each other, and smiled apologetically at me. They didn't knowany, but strongly recommended that I should approach one of those inspectors onmy own, and put my case to him. In Vicam Station, my attempts at making contact with the field inspectors of thegovernment bank were a total disaster. I met three of them, but when I told themwhat I wanted, every one of them looked at me with utter distrust.They immediately suspected that I was a spy sent there by the Yankees to causeproblems that they could not clearly define, but about which they made wildspeculations ranging from political agitation to industrial espionage. It wasthe unsubstantiated belief of everyone around that there were copper deposits inthe lands of the Yaqui Indians, and that the Yankees coveted them. After this resounding failure, I retreated to the city of Guaymas, and stayed ata hotel that was very close to a fabulous restaurant. I went to the restaurantthree times a day. The food was superb. I liked it so much that I stayed inGuaymas for over a week. I practically lived in the restaurant, and became, inthis manner, acquainted with the owner, Mr. Reyes.One afternoon while I was eating, Mr. Reyes came to my table with another manwhom he introduced to me as Jorge Campos- a full-blooded Yaqui Indianentrepreneur who had lived in Arizona in his youth, who spoke English perfectly,and who was more American than any American. Mr. Reyes praised him as a trueexample of how hard work and dedication could develop a person into anexceptional man.Mr. Reyes left and Jorge Campos sat down next to me, and immediately took over.He pretended to be modest, and denied all praise; but it was obvious that he wasas pleased as punch with what Mr. Reyes had said about him.At first sight, I had the clear impression that Jorge Campos was an entrepreneurof the particular kind that one finds in bars or on crowded corners of mainstreets trying to sell an idea; or simply trying to find a way to con people outof their savings.Mr. Campos was very pleasant looking, around six feet tall and lean, but with ahigh pot belly like a habitual drinker of hard liquor. He had a very darkcomplexion with a touch of green to it, and wore expensive blue jeans and shinycowboy boots with pointed toes and angular heels as if he needed to dig theminto the ground to stop being dragged by a lassoed steer.He was wearing an impeccably ironed gray plaid shirt. In its right pocket was aplastic pocket guard into which he had inserted a row of pens. I had seen thesame pocket guard among office workers who didn't want to stain their shirtpockets with ink.His attire also included an expensive looking fringed reddish brown suedejacket, and a tall Texas style cowboy hat.His round face was expressionless. He had no wrinkles even though he seemed tobe in his early fifties.For some unknown reason, I believed that he was dangerous.\"Very pleased to meet you, Mr. Campos,\" I said in Spanish, extending my hand tohim.\"Let's dispense with the formalities,\" he responded, also in Spanish, shaking myhand vigorously. \"I like to treat young people as equals regardless of agedifferences. Call me Jorge.\"He was quiet for a moment, no doubt assessing my reaction. I didn't know what tosay. I certainly didn't want to humor him, nor did I want to take him seriously.\"I'm curious to know what you're doing in Guaymas,\" he went on casually. \"Youdon't seem to be a tourist, nor do you seem to be interested in deep-seafishing.\"\"I am an anthropology student,\" I said, \"and I am trying to establish mycredentials with the local Indians in order to do some field research.\"\"And I am a businessman,\" he said. \"My business is to supply information; to bethe go-between. You have the need, I have the commodity. I charge for myservices. However, my services are guaranteed. If you don't get satisfaction,you don't have to pay me.\"\"If your business is to supply information,\" I said, \"I will gladly pay youwhatever you charge.\"\"Ah!\" he exclaimed. \"You certainly need a guide; someone with more educationthan the average Indian here to show you around. Do you have a grant from theUnited States government or from another big institution?\"\"Yes,\" I lied. \"I have a grant from the Esoterical Foundation of Los Angeles.\"When I said that, I actually saw a glint of greed in his eyes. \"Ah!\" heexclaimed again. \"How big is that institution?\"\"Fairly big,\" I said.\"My goodness! Is that so?\" he said, as if my words were an explanation that hehad wanted to hear. \"And now, may I ask you, if you don't mind, how big is yourgrant? How much money did they give you?\"\"A few thousand dollars to do preliminary fieldwork,\" I lied again, to see whathe would say.Relishing his words, he said, \"Ah! I like people who are direct. I am sure thatyou and I are going to reach an agreement. I offer you my services as a guideand as a key that can open many secret doors among the Yaquis. As you can see bymy general appearance, I am a man of taste and means.\"\"Oh, yes, definitely you are a man of good taste,\" I asserted.\"What I am saying to you,\" he said, \"is that for a small fee, which you willfind most reasonable, I will steer you to the right people; people to whom youcould ask any question you want. And for some very little more, I will translatetheir words to you, verbatim, into Spanish or English. I can also speak Frenchand German, but I have the feeling that those languages do not interest you.\"\"You are right, you are so very right,\" I said. \"Those languages don't interestme at all. But how much would your fees be?\"\"Ah! My fees!\" he said, and took a leather covered notebook out of his backpocket, and flipped it open in front of my face. He scribbled quick notes on it,flipped it closed again, and put it in his pocket with precision and speed. Iwas sure that he wanted to give me the impression of being efficient and fast atcalculating figures.\"I will charge you fifty dollars a day,\" he said, \"with transportation, plus mymeals. I mean, when you eat, I eat. What do you say?\"At that moment, he leaned over to me and, almost in a whisper, said that weshould shift into English because he didn't want people to know the nature ofour transactions. He began to speak to me then in something that wasn't Englishat all.I was at a loss. I didn't know how to respond. I began to fret nervously as theman kept on talking gibberish with the most natural air. He didn't bat aneyelash. He moved his hands in a very animated fashion and pointed around him asif he were instructing me.I didn't have the impression that he was speaking in tongues. I thought perhapshe was speaking the Yaqui language.When people came around our table and looked at us, I nodded and said to JorgeCampos, \"Yes, yes, indeed.\" At one point I said, \"You could say that again,\" andthis sounded so funny to me that I broke into a belly laugh.He also laughed heartily, as if I had said the funniest thing possible.He must have noticed that I was finally at my wits' end, and before I could getup and tell him to get lost, he started to speak Spanish again.\"I don't want to tire you with my silly observations,\" he said. \"But if I'mgoing to be your guide, as I think I am going to be, we will be spending longhours chatting. I was testing you just now, to see if you are a goodconversationalist. If I'm going to spend time with you driving, I need someoneby me who could be a good receptor and initiator. I'm glad to tell you that youare both.\"Then he stood up, shook my hand, and left. As if on cue, the owner came to my table, smiling and shaking his head from sideto side like a little bear.\"Isn't he a fabulous guy?\" he asked me.I didn't want to commit myself to a statement.Mr. Reyes volunteered that Jorge Campos was at that moment a go-between in anextremely delicate and profitable transaction. He said that some miningcompanies in the United States were interested in the iron and copper depositsthat belonged to the Yaqui Indians, and that Jorge Campos was there in line tocollect perhaps a five million dollar fee.I knew then that Jorge Campos was a con man. There were no iron or copperdeposits on the lands owned by the Yaqui Indians. If there had been any, privateenterprises would have already moved the Yaquis out of those lands and relocatedthem somewhere else.I said, \"He's fabulous; the most wonderful guy I ever met. How can I get intouch with him again?\"Mr. Reyes said, \"Don't worry about that. Jorge asked me all about you. He hasbeen watching you since you came. He'll probably come and knock on your doorlater today or tomorrow.\"Mr. Reyes was right. A couple of hours later, somebody woke me from my afternoonnap. It was Jorge Campos.I had intended to leave Guaymas in the early evening, and drive all night toCalifornia. I explained to him that I was leaving, but that I would come back ina month or so.\"Ah! But you must stay now that I have decided to be your guide,\" he said.\"I'm sorry, but we will have to wait for this because my time is very limitednow,\" I replied.I knew that Jorge Campos was a crook, yet I decided to reveal to him that Ialready had an informant who was waiting to work with me, and that I had met himin Arizona. I described the old man and said that his name was Juan Matus, andthat other people had characterized him as a shaman.Jorge Campos smiled at me broadly.I asked him if he knew the old man.\"Ah, yes, I know him,\" he said jovially. \"You may say that we are good friends.\"Without being invited, Jorge Campos came into the room and sat down at the tablejust inside the balcony.\"Does he live around here?\" I asked.\"He certainly does,\" he assured me.\"Would you take me to him?\"\"I don't see why not,\" he said. \"I would need a couple of days to make my owninquiries, just to make sure that he is there, and then we will go and see him.\"I knew that he was lying, yet I didn't want to believe it. I even thought thatmy initial distrust had perhaps been ill-founded. He seemed so convincing atthat moment.\"However,\" he continued, \"in order to take you to see the man, I will charge youa flat fee. My honorarium will be two hundred dollars.\"That amount was more than I had at my disposal. I politely declined, and saidthat I didn't have enough money with me.\"I don't want to appear mercenary,\" he said with his most winning smile, \"buthow much money can you afford? You must take into consideration that I have todo a little bribing. The Yaqui Indians are very private, but there are alwaysways. There are always doors that open with a magical key- money.\"In spite of all my misgivings, I was convinced that Jorge Campos was my entrynot only into the Yaqui world, but to finding the old man who had intrigued meso much. I didn't want to haggle over money. I was almost embarrassed to offerhim the fifty dollars I had in my pocket.\"I am at the end of my stay here,\" I said as a sort of apology, \"so I havenearly run out of money. I have only fifty dollars left.\"Jorge Campos stretched his long legs under the table, and crossed his armsbehind his head, tipping his hat over his face.\"I'll take your fifty dollars and your watch,\" he said shamelessly. \"But forthat money, I will take you to meet a minor shaman.\"Don't get impatient,\" he warned me, as if I were going to protest. \"We muststep carefully up the ladder, from the lower ranks to the man himself who Iassure you is at the very top.\"\"And when could I meet this minor shaman?\" I asked, handing him the money and mywatch.\"Right now!\" he replied as he sat up straight, and eagerly grabbed the money andthe watch. \"Let's go! There's not a minute to waste!\"We got into my car and he directed me to head off for the town of Potam, one ofthe traditional Yaqui towns along the Yaqui River.As we drove, he revealed to me that we were going to meet Lucas Coronado, a manwho was known for his sorcery feats, his shamanistic trances, and for themagnificent masks that he made for the Yaqui festivities of Lent.Then he shifted the conversation to the old man, and what he said was in totalcontradiction to what others had said to me about the man. While they haddescribed him as a hermit and retired shaman, Jorge Campos portrayed him as themost prominent curer and sorcerer of the area, a man whose fame had turned himinto a nearly inaccessible figure.He paused, like an actor, and then he delivered his blow: He said that to talkto the old man on a steady basis, the way anthropologists like to do, was goingto cost me at least two thousand dollars.I was going to protest such a drastic hike in price, but he anticipated me.\"For two hundred dollars, I could take you to him,\" he said. \"Out of those twohundred dollars, I would clear about thirty. The rest would go for bribes. Butto talk to him at length will cost more. You yourself could figure that out. Hehas actual bodyguards; people who protect him. I have to sweet-talk them andcome up with dough for them.\"In the end,\" he continued, \"I will give you a total account with receipts andeverything for your taxes. Then you will know that my commission for setting itall up is minimal.\"I felt a wave of admiration for him. He was aware of everything, even receiptsfor income tax. He was quiet for a while as if calculating his minimal profit. Ihad nothing to say. I was busy calculating myself, trying to figure out a way toget two thousand dollars. I even thought of really applying for a grant.I asked, \"But are you sure the old man would talk to me?\"\"Of course,\" he assured me. \"Not only would he talk to you, he's going toperform sorcery for you for what you pay him. Then you could work out anagreement with him as to how much you could pay him for further lessons.\"Jorge Campos kept silent again for a while, peering into my eyes.\"Do you think that you could pay me the two thousand dollars?\" he asked in atone so purposefully indifferent that I instantly knew it was a sham.\"Oh, yes, I can easily afford that,\" I lied reassuringly.He could not disguise his glee.\"Good boy! Good boy!\" he cheered. \"We're going to have a ball!\"I tried to ask him some general questions about the old man, but he forcefullycut me off. \"Save all this for the man himself. He'll be all yours,\" he said,smiling.He began to tell me then about his life in the United States and about hisbusiness aspirations; and to my utter bewilderment, since I had alreadyclassified him as a phony who didn't speak a word of English, he shifted intoEnglish.\"You do speak English!\" I exclaimed without any attempt at hiding my surprise.\"Of course I do, my boy,\" he said, affecting a Texan accent, which he carried onfor the duration of our conversation. \"I told you, I wanted to test you, to seeif you are resourceful. You are. In fact, you are quite clever, I may say.\"His command of English was superb, and he delighted me with jokes and stories. In no time at all, we were in Potam. He directed me to a house on the outskirtsof town. We got out of the car. He led the way, calling loudly in Spanish forLucas Coronado.We heard a voice from the back of the house that said, also in Spanish, \"Comeover here.\"There was a man behind a small shack, sitting on the ground, on a goatskin. Hewas holding a piece of wood with his bare feet while he worked on it with achisel and a mallet. By holding the piece of wood in place with the pressure ofhis feet, he had fashioned a stupendous potter's turning wheel, so to speak. Hisfeet turned the piece as his hands worked the chisel.I had never seen anything like this in my life. He was making a mask, hollowingit with a curved chisel. His control of his feet in holding the wood and turningit around was remarkable.The man was very thin. He had a thin face with angular features, highcheekbones, and a dark, copperish complexion. The skin of his face and neckseemed to be stretched to the maximum. He sported a thin, droopy mustache thatgave his angular face a malevolent slant. He had an aquiline nose with a verythin bridge, and fierce black eyes. His extremely black eyebrows appeared as ifthey had been drawn on with a pencil, and so did his jet black hair, combedbackward on his head.I had never seen a more hostile face. The image that came to mind looking at himwas that of an Italian poisoner of the era of the Medicis. The words 'truculent'[* truculent- defiantly aggressive] and 'saturnine' [* saturnine- bitter orscornful] seemed to be the most apt descriptions when I focused my attention onLucas Coronado's face.I noticed that while he was sitting on the ground holding the piece of wood withhis feet, the bones of his legs were so long that his knees came to hisshoulders. When we approached him, he stopped working and stood up. He wastaller than Jorge Campos, and as thin as a rail. As a gesture of deference tous, I suppose, he put on his guaraches.\"Come in, come in,\" he said without smiling.I had a strange feeling then that Lucas Coronado didn't know how to smile.\"To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?\" he asked Jorge Campos.\"I've brought this young man here because he wants to ask you some questionsabout your art,\" Jorge Campos said in a most patronizing tone. \"I vouched thatyou would answer his questions truthfully.\"\"Oh, that's no problem, that's no problem,\" Lucas Coronado assured me, sizing meup with his cold stare.He shifted into a different language then, which I presumed to be Yaqui. He andJorge Campos got into an animated conversation that lasted for some time. Bothof them acted as if I did not exist. Then Jorge Campos turned to me.\"We have a little problem here,\" he said. \"Lucas has just informed me that thisis a very busy season for him since the festivities are approaching; so he won'tbe able to answer all the questions that you ask him, but he will at anothertime.\"\"Yes, yes, most certainly,\" Lucas Coronado said to me in Spanish. \"At anothertime, indeed; at another time.\"\"We have to cut our visit short,\" Jorge Campos said, \"but I'll bring you backagain.\"As we were leaving, I felt moved to express to Lucas Coronado my admiration forhis stupendous technique of working with his hands and feet. He looked at me asif I were mad, his eyes widening with surprise.\"You've never seen anyone working on a mask?\" he hissed through clenched teeth.\"Where are you from? Mars?\"I felt stupid. I tried to explain that his technique was quite new to me. Heseemed ready to hit me on the head.Jorge Campos said to me in English that I had offended Lucas Coronado with mycomments. He had understood my praise as a veiled way of making fun of hispoverty. My words had been to him an ironic statement of how poor and helplesshe was.\"But it's the opposite,\" I said. \"I think he's magnificent!\"\"Don't try to tell him anything like that,\" Jorge Campos retorted. \"These peopleare trained to receive and dispense insults in a most covert form. He thinksit's odd that you run him down when you don't even know him, and make fun of thefact that he cannot afford a vise to hold his sculpture.\"I felt totally at a loss. The last thing I wanted was to foul up my onlypossible contact. Jorge Campos seemed to be utterly aware of my chagrin.\"Buy one of his masks,\" he advised me.I told him that I intended to drive to Los Angeles in one lap, without stopping,and that I had just sufficient money to buy gasoline and food.\"Well, give him your leather jacket,\" he said matter-of-factly in aconfidential, helpful tone. \"Otherwise, you're going to anger him, and all he'llremember about you will be your insults. But don't tell him that his masks arebeautiful. Just buy one.\"When I told Lucas Coronado that I wanted to trade my leather jacket for one ofhis masks, he grinned with satisfaction. He took the jacket, and put it on. Hewalked to his house, but before he entered, he did some strange gyrations. Heknelt in front of some sort of religious altar, and moved his arms as if tostretch them, and rubbed his hands on the sides of the jacket.He went inside the house, and brought out a bundle wrapped in newspapers whichhe handed to me. I wanted to ask him some questions. He excused himself, sayingthat he had to work; but added that if I wanted, I could come back at anothertime.On the way back to the city of Guaymas, Jorge Campos asked me to open thebundle. He wanted to make sure that Lucas Coronado had not cheated me. I didn'tcare to open the bundle. My only concern was the possibility that I could comeback by myself to talk to Lucas Coronado. I was elated.\"I must see what you have,\" Jorge Campos insisted. \"Stop the car, please. Notunder any conditions, or for any reasons whatsoever would I endanger my clients.You paid me to render some services to you. That man is a genuine shaman, andtherefore very dangerous. Because you have offended him, he may have given you awitchcraft bundle. If that's the case, we have to bury it quickly in this area.\"I felt a wave of nausea, and stopped the car. With extreme care, I took out thebundle. Jorge Campos snatched it out of my hands, and opened it. It containedthree beautifully made traditional Yaqui masks.Jorge Campos mentioned, in a casual, disinterested tone, that it would be onlyproper that I give him one of them.I reasoned that since he had not yet taken me to see the old man, I had topreserve my connection with him. I gladly gave him one of the masks.\"If you allow me to choose, I would rather take that one,\" he said, pointing.I told him to go ahead. The masks didn't mean anything to me. I had gotten whatI was after. I would have given him the other two masks as well, but I wanted toshow them to my anthropologist friends.\"These masks are nothing extraordinary,\" Jorge Campos declared. \"You can buythem in any store in town. They sell them to tourists there.\"I had seen the Yaqui masks that were sold in the stores in town. They were veryrude masks in comparison to the ones I had, and Jorge Campos had indeed pickedout the best.I left him in the city and headed for Los Angeles. Before I said good-bye, hereminded me that I practically owed him two thousand dollars because he wasgoing to start his bribing and working toward taking me to meet the big man.\"Do you think that you could give me my two thousand dollars the next time youcome?\" he asked daringly.His question put me in a terrible position. I believed that to tell him thetruth, that I doubted it, would have made him drop me. I was convinced then thatin spite of his patent greed, he was my usher.In a noncommittal tone, I said, \"I will do my best to have the money.\"\"You gotta do better than that, boy,\" he retorted forcefully, almost angrily.\"I'm going to spend money on my own setting up this meeting, and I must havesome reassurance on your part. I know that you are a very serious young man. Howmuch is your car worth? Do you have the pink slip?\"I told him what my car was worth, and that I did have the pink slip, but heseemed satisfied only when I gave him my word that I would bring him the moneyin cash on my next visit. Five months later, I went back to Guaymas to see Jorge Campos. Two thousanddollars at that time was a considerable amount of money, especially for astudent. I thought that if perhaps he were willing to take partial payments, Iwould be more than happy to commit myself to pay that amount in installments.I couldn't find Jorge Campos anywhere in Guaymas. I asked the owner of therestaurant. He was as baffled as I was about his disappearance.\"He has just vanished,\" he said. \"I'm sure he went back to Arizona, or to Texas,where he has business.\"I took a chance, and went to see Lucas Coronado by myself. I arrived at hishouse at midday. I couldn't find him either.I asked his neighbors if they knew where he might be. They looked at mebelligerently and didn't dignify me with an answer.I left, but went by his house again in the late afternoon. I didn't expectanything at all. In fact, I was prepared to leave for Los Angeles immediately.To my surprise, Lucas Coronado was not only there, but was extremely friendly tome. He frankly expressed his approval on seeing that I had come without JorgeCampos who he said was an outright pain in the ass. He complained that JorgeCampos, to whom he referred as a renegade Yaqui Indian, took delight inexploiting his fellow Yaquis.I gave Lucas Coronado some gifts that I had brought him, and bought from himthree masks, an exquisitely carved staff, and a pair of rattling leggings madeout of the cocoons of some insects from the desert; leggings which the Yaquisused in their traditional dances. Then I took him to Guaymas for dinner.I saw him every day for the five days that I remained in the area, and he gaveme endless amounts of information about the Yaquis, their history and socialorganization, and the meaning and nature of their festivities. I was having suchfun as a field-worker that I even felt reluctant to ask him if he knew anythingabout the old shaman.Overcoming second thoughts, I finally asked Lucas Coronado if he knew the oldman whom Jorge Campos had assured me was such a prominent shaman. Lucas Coronadoseemed perplexed. He assured me that, to his knowledge, no such man had everexisted in that part of the country, and that Jorge Campos was a crook who onlywanted to cheat me out of my money.Hearing Lucas Coronado deny the existence of that old man had a terrible,unexpected impact on me. In one instant, it became evident to me that I reallydidn't give a damn about field-work. I only cared about finding that old man.I knew then that meeting the old shaman had indeed been the culmination ofsomething that had nothing to do with my desires, aspirations, or even thoughtsas an anthropologist.I wondered more than ever who in the hell that old man was. Without anyinhibitory checks, I began to rant and yell in frustration. I stomped on thefloor.Lucas Coronado was quite taken aback by my display. He looked at me, bewildered,and then started to laugh. I had no idea that he could laugh.I apologized to him for my outburst of anger and frustration. I couldn't explainwhy I was so out of sorts. Lucas Coronado seemed to understand my quandary.He said, \"Things like that happen in this area.\"I had no idea to what he was referring, nor did I want to ask him. I was deadlyafraid of the easiness with which he took offense. A peculiarity of the Yaquiswas the facility they had to feel offended. They seemed to be perennially ontheir toes, looking out for insults that were too subtle to be noticed by anyoneelse.He continued, saying, \"There are magical beings living in the mountains aroundhere, and they can act on people. They make people go veritably mad. People rantand rave under their influence, and when they finally calm down, exhausted, theydon't have any clue as to why they exploded.\"I asked, \"Do you think that's what happened to me?\"\"Definitely,\" he replied with total conviction. \"You already have apredisposition to going bonkers at the drop of a hat, but you are also verycontained. Today, you weren't contained. You went bananas over nothing.\"\"It isn't over nothing,\" I assured him. \"I didn't know it until now, but to methat old man is the driving force of all my efforts.\"Lucas Coronado kept quiet, as if in deep thought. Then he began to pace up anddown.\"Do you know any old man who lives around here, but is not quite from thisarea?\" I asked him.He didn't understand my question. I had to explain to him that the old Indian Ihad met was perhaps like Jorge Campos; a Yaqui who had lived somewhere else.Lucas Coronado explained that the surname Matus was quite common in that area,but that he didn't know any Matus whose first name was Juan. He seemeddespondent. Then he had a moment of insight, and stated that because the man wasold, he might have another name, and that perhaps he had given me a workingname; not his real one.\"The only old man I know,\" he went on, \"is Ignacio Flores's father. He comes tosee his son from time to time, but he comes from Mexico City. Come to think ofit, he's Ignacio's father, but he doesn't seem that old. But he's old. Ignacio'sold, too. His father seems younger, though.\"He laughed heartily at his realization. Apparently, he had never thought aboutthe youth of the old man until that moment. He kept on shaking his head, as ifin disbelief. I, on the other hand, was elated beyond measure.\"That's the man!\" I yelled without knowing why.Lucas Coronado didn't know where Ignacio Flores actually lived, but he was veryaccommodating. He directed me to drive to a nearby Yaqui town where he foundIgnacio Flores for me. Lucas Coronado had warned me that Ignacio Flores had been a career soldier inhis youth, and that he still had the bearing of a military man.Ignacio Flores was a big, corpulent man, perhaps in his mid-sixties. He had anenormous mustache. That and the fierceness of his eyes made him, for me, thepersonification of a ferocious soldier. He had a dark complexion. His hair wasstill jet black in spite of his years.His forceful, gravelly voice seemed to be trained solely to give commands. I hadthe impression that he had been a cavalry man.He walked as if he were still wearing spurs, and for some strange reasonimpossible to fathom, I heard the sound of spurs when he walked.Lucas Coronado introduced me to him, and said that I had come from Arizona tosee his father whom I had met in Nogales. Ignacio Flores didn't seem surprisedat all.\"Oh yes,\" he said. \"My father travels a great deal.\" Without any otherpreliminaries, he directed us to where we could find his father. He didn't comewith us; I thought out of politeness. He excused himself and marched away as ifhe were keeping step in a parade. I prepared myself to go to the old man's house with Lucas Coronado. Instead, hepolitely declined. He wanted me to drive him back to his house.\"I think you found the man you were looking for, and I feel that you should bealone,\" he said.I marveled at how extraordinarily polite these Yaqui Indians were, and yet atthe same time, so fierce. I had been told that the Yaquis were savages who hadno qualms about killing anyone. As far as I was concerned, though, their mostremarkable feature was their politeness and consideration.I drove to the house of Ignacio Flores's father, and there I found the man I waslooking for. At the end of my account, I said to don Juan, \"I wonder why Jorge Campos liedand told me that he knew you.\"\"He didn't lie to you,\" don Juan said with the conviction of someone who wascondoning Jorge Campos's behavior. \"He didn't even misrepresent himself. Hethought you were an easy mark, and was going to cheat you. He couldn't carry outhis plan, though, because infinity overpowered him. Do you know that hedisappeared soon after he met you, never to be found?\"Jorge Campos was a most meaningful personage for you,\" he continued. \"You willfind in whatever transpired between the two of you a sort of guiding blueprint-because he is the representation of your life.\"\"Why? I'm not a crook!\" I protested.He laughed, as if he knew something that I didn't. The next thing I knew, Ifound myself in the midst of an extensive explanation of my actions, my ideals,and my expectations.However, a strange thought urged me to consider with the same fervor with whichI was explaining myself, that under certain circumstances I might be like JorgeCampos. I found the thought inadmissible, and I used all my available energy totry to disprove it. However, down in the depths of myself, I didn't care toapologize if I were like Jorge Campos.When I voiced my dilemma, don Juan laughed so hard that he choked, many times.\"If I were you,\" he commented, \"I'd listen to my inner voice. What differencewould it make if you were like Jorge Campos: a crook! He was a cheap crook. Youare more elaborate. This is the power of the recounting. This is why sorcerersuse it. It puts you into contact with something that you didn't even suspectexisted in you.\"I wanted to leave right then. Don Juan knew exactly how I felt.\"Don't listen to the superficial voice that makes you angry,\" he saidcommandingly. \"Listen to that deeper voice that is going to guide you from nowon; the voice that is laughing. Listen to it! And laugh with it. Laugh! Laugh!\"His words were like a hypnotic command to me. Against my will, I began to laugh.Never had I been so happy. I felt free; unmasked.Don Juan said, \"Recount to yourself the story of Jorge Campos, over and over.You will find endless wealth in it. Every detail is part of a map. It is thenature of infinity, once we cross a certain threshold, to put a blueprint infront of us.\"He peered at me for a long time, but he didn't merely glance as before. He gazedintently at me.He finally said, \"One deed which Jorge Campos couldn't avoid performing was toput you in contact with the other man, Lucas Coronado, who is as meaningful toyou as Jorge Campos himself; maybe even more.In the course of recounting the story of those two men, I had realized that Ihad spent more time with Lucas Coronado than with Jorge Campos; however, ourexchanges had not been as intense, and were marked by enormous lagoons ofsilence. Lucas Coronado was not by nature a talkative man, and by some strangetwist, whenever he was silent he managed to drag me with him into that state.\"Lucas Coronado is the other part of your map,\" don Juan said. \"Don't you findit strange that he is a sculptor, like yourself; a super-sensitive artist whowas, like yourself at one time, in search of a sponsor for his art? He lookedfor a sponsor just like you looked for a woman; a lover of the arts, who wouldsponsor your creativity.\"I entered into another terrifying struggle. This time my struggle was between myabsolute certainty that I had not mentioned this aspect of my life to him, thefact that all of it was true, and the fact that I was unable to find anexplanation for how he could have obtained this information.Again, I wanted to leave right away. But once more, the impulse was overpoweredby a voice that came from a deep place. Without any coaxing, I began to laughheartily. Some part of me, at a profound level, didn't give a hoot about findingout how don Juan had gotten that information. The fact that he had it, and haddisplayed it in such a delicate but conniving manner was a delightful maneuverto witness. It was of no consequence that the superficial part of me got angryand wanted to leave.\"Very good,\" don Juan said to me, patting me forcefully on the back, \"verygood.\"He was pensive for a moment, as if he were perhaps seeing things invisible tothe average eye.\"Jorge Campos and Lucas Coronado are the two ends of an axis,\" he said. \"Thataxis is you; at one end, a ruthless, shameless, crass mercenary who takes careof himself; hideous, but indestructible. At the other end, a super-sensitive,tormented artist, weak and vulnerable.\"That should have been the map of your life, were it not for the appearance ofanother possibility; the one that opened up when you crossed the threshold ofinfinity. You searched for me, and you found me; and so, you did cross thethreshold.\"The intent of infinity told me to look for someone like you. I found you, thusI crossed the threshold myself.\"The conversation ended at that point. Don Juan went into one of his habituallong periods of total silence.It was only at the end of the day when we had returned to his house and we weresitting under his ramada cooling off from the long hike we had taken, that hebroke his silence.Don Juan went on, saying, \"In your recounting of what happened between you andJorge Campos, and you and Lucas Coronado, I found, and I hope you did, too, avery disturbing factor.\"For me, it's an omen. It points to the end of an era, meaning that whatever wasstanding there cannot remain. Very flimsy elements brought you to me. None ofthem could stand on their own. This is what I drew from your recounting.\"I remembered that don Juan had revealed to me one day that Lucas Coronado wasterminally ill. He had some health condition that was slowly consuming him.\"I have sent word to him through my son Ignacio about what he should do to curehimself,\" don Juan went on, \"but he thinks it's nonsense and doesn't want tohear it. It isn't Lucas's fault. The entire human race doesn't want to hearanything. They hear only what they want to hear.\"I remembered that I had prevailed upon don Juan to tell me what I could say toLucas Coronado to help him alleviate his physical pain and mental anguish. DonJuan not only told me what to tell him, but asserted that if Lucas Coronadowanted to, he could easily cure himself.Nevertheless, when I delivered don Juan's message, Lucas Coronado looked at meas if I had lost my mind. Then he shifted into a brilliant, and, had I been aYaqui, a deeply insulting portrayal of a man who is bored to death by someone'sunwarranted insistence. I thought that only a Yaqui Indian could be so subtle.\"Those things don't help me,\" he finally said defiantly, angered by my lack ofsensibility. \"It doesn't really matter. We all have to die. But don't you darebelieve that I have lost hope. I'm going to get some money from the governmentbank. I'll get an advance on my crops, and then I'll get enough money to buysomething that will cure me, ipso facto. [* ipso facto- by the fact itself] It'sname is Vi-ta-mi-nol.\"\"What is Vitaminol?\" I had asked.\"It's something that's advertised on the radio,\" he said with the innocence of achild. \"It cures everything. It's recommended for people who don't eat meat orfish or fowl every day. It's recommended for people like myself who can barelykeep body and soul together.\"In my eagerness to help Lucas Coronado, I committed right then the biggestblunder imaginable in a society of such hypersensitive beings as the Yaquis: Ioffered to give him the money to buy Vitaminol. His cold stare was the measureof how deeply I had hurt him. My stupidity was unforgivable. Very softly, LucasCoronado said that he was capable of affording Vitaminol himself.I went back to don Juan's house. I felt like weeping. My eagerness had betrayedme.\"Don't waste your energy worrying about things like that,\" don Juan said coldly.\"Lucas Coronado is locked in a vicious cycle, but so are you. So is everyone. Hehas Vitaminol, which he trusts will cure everything, and resolve every one ofhis problems. At the moment, he can't afford it, but he has great hopes that heeventually will be able to.\"Don Juan peered at me with his piercing eyes. \"I told you that Lucas Coronado'sacts are the map of your life,\" he said. \"Believe you me, they are. LucasCoronado pointed out Vitaminol to you, and he did it so powerfully and painfullythat he hurt you and made you weep.\"Don Juan stopped talking then. It was a long and most effective pause. \"Anddon't tell me that you don't understand what I mean,\" he said. \"One way oranother, we all have our own version of Vitaminol.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"Who Was Don Juan Matus, Really?The part of my account of meeting don Juan that he didn't want to hear about wasmy feelings and impressions on that fateful day when I walked into his house:the contradictory clash between my expectations and the reality of thesituation, and the effect that was caused in me by a cluster of the mostextravagant ideas I had ever heard.\"That is more in the line of confession than in the line of events,\" he had saidto me once when I tried to tell him about all this.\"You couldn't be more wrong, don Juan,\" I began, but I stopped. Something in theway he looked at me made me realize that he was right. Whatever I was going tosay could have sounded only like lip service, flattery. What had taken place onour first real meeting, however, was of transcendental importance to me, anevent of ultimate consequence. During my first encounter with don Juan, in the bus depot in Nogales, Arizona,something of an unusual nature had happened to me, but it had come to mecushioned in my concerns with the presentation of the self. I had wanted toimpress don Juan, and in attempting to do so I had focused all my attention onthe act of selling my wares, so to speak. It was only months later that astrange residue of forgotten events began to appear.One day, out of nowhere, and with no coaxing or coaching on my part, Irecollected with extraordinary clarity something that had completely bypassed meduring my actual encounter with don Juan. When he had stopped me from tellinghim my name, he had peered into my eyes and had numbed me with his look. Therewas infinitely more that I could have said to him about myself. I could haveexpounded on my knowledge and worth for hours if his look hadn't completely cutme off.In light of this new realization, I reconsidered everything that had happened tome on that occasion. My unavoidable conclusion was that I had experienced theinterruption of some mysterious flow that kept me going; a flow that had neverbeen interrupted before, at least not in the manner in which don Juan had doneit.When I tried to describe to any of my friends what I had physically experienced,a strange perspiration began to cover my entire body; the same perspiration thatI had experienced when don Juan had given me that look. I had been, at thatmoment, not only incapable of voicing a single word, but incapable of having asingle thought.For some time after, I dwelled on the physical sensation of this interruptionfor which I found no rational explanation. I argued for a while that don Juanmust have hypnotized me, but then my memory told me that he hadn't given anyhypnotic commands, nor had he made any movements that could have trapped myattention.In fact, he had merely glanced at me. It was the intensity of that glance thathad made it appear as if he had stared at me for a long time. It had obsessedme, and had rendered me discombobulated at a deep physical level. When I finally had don Juan in front of me again, the first thing I noticedabout him was that he didn't look at all as I had imagined him during all thetime I had tried to find him. I had fabricated an image of the man I had met atthe bus depot, which I perfected every day by allegedly remembering moredetails.In my mind, he was an old man, still very strong and nimble, yet almost frail.The man facing me was muscular and decisive. He moved with agility, but notnimbleness. His steps were firm, and, at the same time, light. He exudedvitality and purpose.My composite memory was not at all in harmony with the real thing. I thought hehad short, white hair and an extremely dark complexion. His hair was longer, andnot as white as I had imagined. His complexion was not that dark either. I couldhave sworn that his features were birdlike, because of his age. But that was notso either. His face was full, almost round. In one glance, the most outstandingfeature of the man looking at me was his dark eyes, which shone with a peculiar,dancing glow.Something that had bypassed me completely in my prior assessment of him was thefact that his total countenance was that of an athlete. His shoulders werebroad, his stomach flat. He seemed to be planted firmly on the ground. There wasno feebleness to his knees, no tremor in his upper limbs. I had imagineddetecting a slight tremor in his head and arms, as if he were nervous andunsteady. I had also imagined him to be about five feet six inches tall, threeinches shorter than his actual height.Don Juan had not seemed surprised to see me. I wanted to tell him how difficultit had been for me to find him. I would have liked to be congratulated by him onmy titanic efforts, but he just laughed at me, teasingly.\"Your efforts are not important,\" he said. \"What's important is that you foundmy place. Sit down, sit down,\" he said, enticing me, pointing to one of thefreight boxes under his ramada, and patting me on my back; but it wasn't afriendly pat.It felt like he had slapped me on the back although he never actually touchedme. His quasi-slap created a strange, unstable sensation, which appearedabruptly and disappeared before I had time to grasp what it was.What was left in me as a result was a strange peace. I felt at ease. My mind wascrystal clear. I had no expectations; no desires. My usual nervousness andsweaty hands- the marks of my existence- were suddenly gone.\"Now you will understand everything I am going to say to you,\" don Juan said tome, looking into my eyes as he had done in the bus depot.Ordinarily, I would have found his statement perfunctory, perhaps rhetorical,but when he said it, I could only assure him repeatedly and sincerely that Iwould understand anything he said to me. He looked me in the eyes again with aferocious intensity.\"I am Juan Matus,\" he said, sitting down on another freight box, a few feetaway, facing me. \"This is my name, and I voice it because, with it, I am makinga bridge for you to cross over to where I am.\"He stared at me for an instant before he started talking again.\"I am a sorcerer,\" he went on. \"I belong to a lineage of sorcerers that haslasted for twenty-seven generations. I am the 'nagual' of my generation.\"He explained to me that the leader of a party of sorcerers like himself wascalled the nagual, and that this was a generic term applied to a sorcerer ineach generation who had some specific energetic configuration that set him apartfrom the others- not in terms of superiority or inferiority, or anything of thelike, but in terms of the capacity to be responsible.\"Only the nagual,\" he said, \"has the energetic capacity to be responsible forthe fate of his cohorts. Every one of his cohorts knows this, and they accede.[* accede- agree; submit; yield] The nagual can be a man or a woman. In the timeof the sorcerers who were the founders of my lineage, women were, by rule, thenaguals. Their natural pragmatism- the product of their femaleness- led mylineage into pits of practicalities from which they could barely emerge. Then,the males took over, and led my lineage into pits of imbecility from which weare barely emerging now.\"Since the time of the nagual Lujan, who lived about two hundred years ago,\" hewent on, \"there has been a joint nexus of effort, shared by a man and a woman.The nagual man brings sobriety; the nagual woman brings innovation.\"I wanted to ask him at this point if there was a woman in his life who was thenagual, but the depth of my concentration didn't allow me to formulate thequestion. Instead, he himself formulated it for me.\"Is there a nagual woman in my life?\" he asked. \"No, there isn't any. I am asolitary sorcerer. I have my cohorts, though. At the moment, they are notaround.\"A thought came with uncontainable vigor into my mind. At that instant, Iremembered what some people in Yuma had told me about don Juan running with aparty of Mexican men who seemed to be very versed in sorcery maneuvers.\"To be a sorcerer,\" don Juan continued, \"doesn't mean to practice witchcraft, orto work to affect people, or to be possessed by demons. To be a sorcerer meansto reach a level of awareness that makes inconceivable things available.The term 'sorcery' is inadequate to express what sorcerers do, and so is theterm 'shamanism.' The actions of sorcerers are exclusively in the realm of theabstract; the impersonal. Sorcerers struggle to reach a goal that has nothing todo with the quests of an average man. Sorcerers' aspirations are to reachinfinity, and to be conscious of it.\"Don Juan continued, saying that the task of sorcerers was to face infinity, andthat they plunged into it daily, as a fisherman plunges into the sea. It wassuch an overwhelming task that sorcerers had to state their names beforeventuring into it. He reminded me that, in Nogales, he had stated his namebefore any interaction had taken place between us. He had, in this manner,asserted his individuality in front of the infinite.I understood with unequaled clarity what he was explaining. I didn't have to askhim for clarifications. My keenness of thought should have surprised me, but itdidn't at all.I knew at that moment that I had always been crystal clear, merely playing dumbfor someone else's benefit.\"Without you knowing anything about it,\" he continued, \"I started you on atraditional quest. You are the man I was looking for. My quest ended when Ifound you, and yours when you found me now.\"Don Juan explained to me that, as the nagual of his generation, he was in searchof an individual who had a specific energetic configuration, adequate to ensurethe continuity of his lineage. He said that at a given moment, the nagual ofeach generation for twenty-seven successive generations had entered into themost nerve-racking experience of their lives: the search for succession.Looking me straight in the eyes, he stated that what made human beings intosorcerers was their capacity to perceive energy directly as it flows in theuniverse, and that when sorcerers perceive a human being in this fashion, theysee a luminous ball, or a luminous egg-shaped figure.His contention was that human beings are not only capable of seeing energydirectly as it flows in the universe, but that they actually do see it, althoughthey are not deliberately conscious of seeing it.He made right then the most crucial distinction for sorcerers; the distinctionbetween the general state of being aware, and the particular state of beingdeliberately conscious of something.He categorized all human beings as possessing awareness, in a general sense,which permits them to see energy directly, and he categorized sorcerers as theonly human beings who were deliberately conscious of seeing energy directly.He then defined awareness as 'energy', and energy as constant flux; a luminousvibration that was never stationary, but always moving of its own accord.He asserted that when a human being was seen, he was perceived as a conglomerateof energy fields held together by the most mysterious force in the universe: abinding, agglutinating, vibratory force that holds energy fields together in acohesive unit.He further explained that the nagual was a specific sorcerer in each generationwhom the other sorcerers were able to see, not as a single luminous ball but asa set of two spheres of luminosity fused, one over the other.\"This feature of doubleness,\" he continued, \"permits the nagual to performmaneuvers that are rather difficult for an average sorcerer. For example, thenagual is a connoisseur of the force that holds us together as a cohesive unit.The nagual could place his full attention, for a fraction of a second, on thatforce, and numb the other person.\"I did that to you at the bus depot because I wanted to stop your barrage of me,me, me, me, me, me, me. I wanted you to find me, and cut the crap.\"The sorcerers of my lineage maintained,\" don Juan went on, \"that the presenceof a double being-a nagual- is sufficient to clarify things for us. What's oddabout it, is that the presence of the nagual clarifies things in a veiledfashion. It happened to me when I met the nagual Julian, my teacher. Hispresence baffled me for years because every time I was around him, I could thinkclearly, but when he moved away, I became the same idiot that I had always been.\"I had the privilege,\" don Juan went on, \"of actually meeting and dealing withtwo naguals.\"For six years, at the request of the nagual Elias, who was the teacher of thenagual Julian, I went to live with him. The nagual Elias is the one who rearedme, so to speak. It was a rare privilege. I had a ringside seat for watchingwhat a nagual really is.\"The nagual Elias and the nagual Julian were two men of tremendously differenttemperaments. The nagual Elias was quieter, and lost in the darkness of hissilence.\"The nagual Julian was bombastic; a compulsive talker. It seemed that he livedto dazzle women. There were more women in his life than one would care to thinkabout.\"Yet both of them were astoundingly alike in that there was nothing inside them.They were empty. The nagual Elias was a collection of astounding, hauntingstories of regions unknown. The nagual Julian was a collection of stories thatwould have anybody in stitches, sprawled on the ground laughing.\"Whenever I tried to pin down 'the man' in them, the real man, the way I couldpinpoint 'the man' in my father, or 'the man' in everybody I knew, I foundnothing. Instead of a real person inside them, there was a bunch of storiesabout persons unknown. Each of the two men had his own flair, but the end resultwas just the same: emptiness; an emptiness that reflected not the world, butinfinity.\"Don Juan went on explaining that the moment one crosses a peculiar threshold ininfinity, either deliberately or, as in my case, unwittingly, everything thathappens to one from then on is no longer exclusively in one's own domain, butenters into the realm of infinity.\"When we met in Arizona, both of us crossed a peculiar threshold,\" he continued.\"And this threshold was not decided by either one of us, but by infinity itself.\"Infinity is everything that surrounds us.\" He said this and made a broadgesture with his arms. \"The sorcerers of my lineage call it infinity, thespirit, the dark sea of awareness, and say that it is something that exists outthere and rules our lives.\"I was truly capable of comprehending everything he was saying, and yet I didn'tknow what the hell he was talking about. I asked if crossing the threshold hadbeen an accidental event, born of unpredictable circumstances ruled by chance.He answered that his steps and mine were guided by infinity, and thatcircumstances that seemed to be ruled by chance were in essence ruled by theactive side of infinity. He called it intent.\"What put you and me together,\" he went on, \"was the intent of infinity. It isimpossible to determine what this intent of infinity is, yet it is there, aspalpable as you and I are.\"Sorcerers say that it is a tremor in the air. The advantage of sorcerers is toknow that the tremor in the air exists, and to know to acquiesce to it withoutany further ado. For sorcerers, there's no pondering, wondering, or speculating.\"They know that all they have is the possibility of merging with the intent ofinfinity, and they just do it.\" Nothing could have been clearer to me than those statements. As far as I wasconcerned, the truth of what he was telling me was so self-evident that itdidn't permit me to ponder how such absurd assertions could have sounded sorational. I knew that everything that don Juan was saying was not only a truism,but I could corroborate it by referring to my own being. I knew about everythingthat he was saying. I had the sensation that I had lived every twist of hisdescription.Our interchange ended then. Something seemed to deflate inside me.It was at that instant that the thought crossed my mind that I was losing mymarbles. I had been blinded by weird statements and had lost every conceivablesense of objectivity. Accordingly, I left don Juan's house in a real hurry,feeling threatened to the core by an unseen enemy. Don Juan walked me to my car,fully cognizant of what was going on inside me.\"Don't worry,\" he said, putting his hand on my shoulder. You're not going crazy.What you felt was a gentle tap of infinity.\"As time went by, I was able to corroborate what don Juan had said about his twoteachers. Don Juan Matus was exactly as he had described those two men to be. Iwould go as far as saying that he was an extraordinary blend of both of them; onthe one hand, extremely quiet and introspective; on the other, extremely openand funny.The most accurate statement about what a nagual is, which he voiced the day Ifound him, was that a nagual is empty, and that that emptiness doesn't reflectthe world, but reflects infinity.Nothing could have been more true than this in reference to don Juan Matus. Hisemptiness reflected infinity. There was no boisterousness on his part, orassertions about the self. There was not a speck of a need to have eithergrievances or remorse.His was the emptiness of a 'warrior-traveler', seasoned to the point where hedoesn't take anything for granted; a warrior traveler who doesn't underestimateor overestimate anything; a quiet, disciplined fighter whose elegance is soextreme that no one, no matter how hard they try to look, will ever find theseam where all that complexity has come together. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The End of an EraThe Deep Concerns of Everyday LifeI went to Sonora to see don Juan. I had to discuss with him the most seriousevent of that moment in my life. I needed his advice.When I arrived at his house, I barely went through the formality of greetinghim. I sat down and blurted out my turmoil.\"Calm down, calm down,\" don Juan said. \"Nothing can be that bad!\"\"What's happening to me, don Juan?\" I asked. It was a rhetorical question on mypart.\"It is the workings of infinity,\" he replied. \"Something happened to your way ofperceiving the day you met me. Your sensation of nervousness is due to thesubliminal realization that your time is up.\"You are aware of it, but not deliberately conscious of it. You feel the absenceof time, and that makes you impatient.\"I know this, for it happened to me and to all the sorcerers of my lineage. At agiven time, a whole era in my life or their lives ended. Now it's your turn. Youhave simply run out of time.\"He demanded then a total account of whatever had happened to me. He said that ithad to be a full account, sparing no details. He wasn't after sketchydescriptions. He wanted me to air the full impact of what was troubling me.\"Let's have this talk, as they say in your world, by the book,\" he said. \"Let usenter into the realm of formal talks.\" Don Juan explained that the shamans of ancient Mexico had developed the idea offormal versus informal talks, and used both of them as devices for teaching andguiding their disciples. Formal talks were, for them, summations that they madefrom time to time of everything that they had taught or said to their disciples.Informal talks were daily elucidations in which things were explained withoutreference to anything but the phenomenon itself under scrutiny.\"Sorcerers keep nothing to themselves,\" he continued. \"To empty themselves inthis fashion is a sorcerers' maneuver. It leads them to abandon the fortress ofthe self.\" I began my story, telling don Juan that the circumstances of my life had neverpermitted me to be introspective. As far back in my past as I ccould remember,my daily life had been filled to the brim with pragmatic problems that hadclamored for immediate resolution.I remembered that my favorite uncle had told me that he was appalled at havingfound out that I had never received a gift for Christmas or for my birthday. Ihad come to live in my father's family's home not too long before my uncle madethat statement. He commiserated with me about the unfairness of my situation. Heeven apologized, although it had nothing to do with him.\"It is disgusting, my boy,\" he said, shaking with feeling. \"I want you to knowthat I am behind you one hundred percent whenever the moment comes to redresswrongdoings.\"He insisted over and over that I had to forgive the people who had wronged me.From what he said, I formed the impression that he wanted me to confront myfather with his finding and accuse him of indolence and neglect, and then, ofcourse, forgive him.My uncle failed to see that I didn't feel wronged at all. What he was asking meto do required an introspective nature that would make me respond to the barbsof psychological mistreatment once they were pointed out to me. I assured myuncle that I was going to think about it, but not at the moment; because, atthat very instant my girlfriend was signaling me desperately to 'hurry up' fromthe living room where she was waiting for me.I never had the opportunity to think about it, but my uncle must have talked tomy father because I got a gift from him; a package neatly wrapped up with ribbonand all, and a little card that said \"Sorry.\" I curiously and eagerly ripped thewrappings.There was a cardboard box, and inside it there was a beautiful toy; a tiny boatwith a winding key attached to the steam pipe. It could be used by children toplay with while they took baths in the bathtub. My father had thoroughlyforgotten that I was already fifteen years old, and was for all practicalpurposes a man. Then, as I reached my adult years, I was still incapable of seriousintrospection. So it was quite a novelty when one day, years later, I foundmyself in the throes of a strange emotional agitation which seemed to increaseas time went by. I discarded it, attributing it to natural processes of the mindor the body; processes that enter into action periodically for no reason at all,or are perhaps triggered by biochemical processes within the body itself. Ithought nothing of it.However, the agitation increased and its pressure forced me to believe that Ihad arrived at a moment in life when what I needed was a drastic change. Therewas something in me that demanded a rearrangement of my life. This urge torearrange everything was familiar. I had felt it in the past, but it had beendormant for a long time.I was committed to studying anthropology, and this commitment was so strong thatnot to study anthropology was never part of my proposed drastic change. Itdidn't occur to me to drop out of school and do something else. The first thingthat came to mind was that I needed to change schools, and go somewhere else faraway from Los Angeles.Before I undertook a change of that magnitude, I wanted to test the waters, soto speak. I enrolled in a full summer load of classes at a school in anothercity. The most important course, for me, was a class in anthropology taught by aforemost authority on the Indians of the Andean region. It was my belief that ifI focused my studies on an area that was emotionally accessible to me, I wouldhave a better opportunity to do anthropological field-work in a serious mannerwhen the time came. I considered my knowledge of South America as giving me abetter entree into any given Indian society there.At the same time that I registered for school, I got a job as a researchassistant to a psychiatrist who was the older brother of one of my friends. Hewanted to do a content analysis of excerpts from some innocuous [* innocuous-unlikely to harm or disturb anyone] tapes of 'question and answer' sessions withyoung men and women about their problems arising from overwork in school,unfulfilled expectations, not being understood at home, frustrating loveaffairs, etc. The tapes were over five years old and were going to be destroyed,but before they were, random numbers were allotted to each reel, and following atable of random numbers, reels were picked by the psychiatrist and his researchassistants, and were scanned for excerpts that could be analyzed.On the first day of class in the new school, the anthropology professor talkedabout his academic bona fides and dazzled his students with the scope of hisknowledge and his publications. He was a tall, slender man in his mid-forties,with shifty blue eyes. What struck me the most about his physical appearance wasthat his eyes were rendered enormous behind glasses for correctingfar-sightedness, and each of his eyes gave the impression that it was rotatingin an opposite direction from the other when he moved his head as he spoke. Iknew that that couldn't be true: It was, however, a very disconcerting image. Hewas extremely well dressed for an anthropologist, who in my day were famous fortheir super-casual attire. Archaeologists, for example, were described by theirstudents as creatures lost in carbon-14 dating who never took a bath.However, for reasons unbeknownst to me, what really set him apart wasn't hisphysical appearance, or his erudition, but his speech pattern. He pronouncedevery word as clearly as anyone I had ever heard, and emphasized certain wordsby elongating them. He had a markedly foreign intonation, but I knew that it wasan affectation. [* affectation- a deliberate pretence or exaggerated display] Hepronounced certain phrases like an Englishman and others like a revivalistpreacher.He fascinated me from the start despite his enormous pomposity. [* pomposity-ack of elegance as a consequence of being puffed up with vanity] [* - ] Hisself-importance was so blatant that it ceased to be an issue after the firstfive minutes of his class; classes which were always bombastic displays ofknowledge cushioned in wild assertions about himself. His command of theaudience was sensational. None of the students I talked to felt anything butsupreme admiration for this extraordinary man. I earnestly thought thateverything was moving along nicely, and that this move to another school inanother city was going to be easy and uneventful, but thoroughly positive. Iliked my new surroundings.At my job, I became completely engrossed in listening to the tapes to the pointwhere I would sneak into the office, and listen not to excerpts, but to entiretapes. What fascinated me beyond measure, at first, was the fact that I heardmyself speaking in every one of those tapes.As the weeks went by and I heard more tapes, my fascination turned to sheerhorror. Every line that was spoken, including the psychiatrist's questions, wasmine. Those people were speaking from the depths of my own being.The revulsion that I experienced was something unique for me. Never had Idreamed that I could be repeated endlessly in every man or woman I heardspeaking on the tapes. My sense of individuality, which had been ingrained in mefrom birth, tumbled down hopelessly under the impact of this colossal discovery.I began then an odious process of trying to restore myself. I unconsciously madea ludicrous attempt at introspection. I tried to wriggle out of my predicamentby endlessly talking to myself. I rehashed in my mind all the possiblerationales that would support my sense of uniqueness, and then I talked out loudto myself about them. I even experienced something quite revolutionary to me;waking myself up many times by my loud talking in my sleep, discoursing about myvalue and distinctiveness.Then, one horrifying day, I suffered another deadly blow. In the wee hours ofthe night, I was woken up by an insistent knocking on my door. It wasn't a mild,timid knock, but what my friends called a 'Gestapo knock'. The door was about tocome off its hinges. I jumped out of bed and opened the peephole. The person whowas knocking on the door was my boss, the psychiatrist. My being his youngerbrother's friend seemed to have created an avenue of communication with him. Hehad befriended me without any hesitation, and there he was on my doorstep. Iturned on the light and opened the door.\"Please come in,\" I said. \"What happened?\"It was three o'clock in the morning, and by his livid expression, and his sunkeneyes, I knew that he was deeply upset. He came in and sat down. His pride andjoy, his black mane of longish hair, was falling all over his face. He didn'tmake any effort to comb his hair back, the way he usually wore it. I liked himvery much because he was an older version of my friend in Los Angeles, withblack, heavy eyebrows, penetrating brown eyes, a square jaw, and thick lips. Hisupper lip seemed to have an extra fold inside, which at times, when he smiled ina certain way, gave the impression that he had a double upper lip. He alwaystalked about the shape of his nose, which he described as an impertinent, pushynose. I thought he was extremely sure of himself, and opinionated beyond belief.He claimed that in his profession those qualities were winning cards.\"What happened!\" he repeated with a tone of mockery, his double upper liptrembling uncontrollably. \"Anyone can tell that everything has happened to metonight.\"He sat down in a chair. He seemed dizzy, disoriented, looking for words. He gotup and went to the couch, slumping down on it.\"It's not only that I have the responsibility of my patients,\" he went on, \"butmy research grant, my wife and kids, and now another fucking pressure has beenadded to it, and what burns me up is that it was my own fault, my own stupidityfor putting my trust in a stupid cunt!\"I'll tell you, Carlos,\" he continued, \"there's nothing more appalling,disgusting, fucking nauseating than the insensitivity of women. I'm not a womanhater, you know that! But at this moment it seems to me that every single cuntis just a cunt! Duplicitous [* duplicitous- arked by deliberate deceptivenessespecially by pretending one set of feelings and acting under the influence ofanother] and vile!\"I didn't know what to say. Whatever he was telling me didn't need affirmation orcontradiction. I wouldn't have dared to contradict him anyway. I didn't have theammunition for it. I was very tired. I wanted to go back to sleep, but he kepton talking as if his life depended on it.\"You know Theresa Manning, don't you?\" he asked me in a forceful, accusatorymanner.For an instant, I believed that he was accusing me of having something to dowith his young, beautiful, student secretary. Without giving me time to respond,he continued talking.\"Theresa Manning is an asshole. She's a schnook! A stupid, inconsiderate womanwho has no incentive in life other than balling anyone with a bit of fame andnotoriety. I thought she was intelligent and sensitive. I thought she hadsomething, some understanding, some empathy, something that one would like toshare, or hold as precious all to oneself. I don't know, but that's the picturethat she painted for me, when in reality she's lewd and degenerate, and, I mayadd, incurably gross.\"As he kept on talking, a strange picture began to emerge. Apparently, thepsychiatrist had just had a bad experience involving his secretary.\"Since the day she came to work for me,\" he went on, \"I knew that she wasattracted to me sexually, but she never came around to saying it. It was all inthe innuendos and the looks. Well, fuck it! This afternoon I got sick and tiredof pussyfooting around, and I came right to the point. I went up to her desk andsaid, 'I know what you want, and you know what I want.'\"He went into a great, elaborate rendition of how forcefully he had told her thathe expected her in his apartment across the street from school at 11:30 P.M.,and that he did not alter his routines for anybody; that he read and worked anddrank wine until one o'clock, at which time he retired to the bedroom. He keptan apartment in town as well as the house he and his wife and children lived inin the suburbs.\"I was so confident that the affair was going to pan out; turn into somethingmemorable,\" he said and sighed. His voice acquired the mellow tone of someoneconfiding something intimate. \"I even gave her the key to my apartment,\" hesaid, and his voice cracked.\"Very dutifully, she came at eleven-thirty,\" he went on. \"She let herself inwith her own key, and sneaked into the bedroom like a shadow. That excited meterribly. I knew that she wasn't going to be any trouble for me. She knew herrole. She probably fell asleep on the bed. Or maybe she watched TV. I becameengrossed in my work, and I didn't care what the fuck she did. I knew that I hadher in the bag.\"But the moment I came into the bedroom,\" he continued, his voice tense andconstricted, as if he were morally offended, \"Theresa jumped on me like ananimal and went for my dick. She didn't even give me time to put down the bottleand the two glasses I was carrying. I had enough presence of mind to put my twoBaccarat glasses on the floor without breaking them. The bottle flew across theroom when she grabbed my balls as if they were made out of rocks. I wanted tohit her. I actually yelled in pain, but that didn't faze her. She giggledinsanely, because she thought I was being cute and sexy. She said so, as if toplacate me.\"Shaking his head with contained rage, he said that the woman was so friggin'eager and utterly selfish that she didn't take into account that a man needs amoment's peace, he needs to feel at ease, at home, in friendly surroundings.Instead of showing consideration and understanding, as her role demanded,Theresa Manning pulled his sexual organs out of his pants with the expertise ofsomeone who had done it hundreds of times.\"The result of all this shit,\" he said, \"was that my sensuality retreated inhorror. I was emotionally emasculated. My body abhorred that fucking woman,instantly. Yet my lust prevented me from throwing her out in the street.\"He said that he decided then that instead of losing face by his impotence,miserably, the way he was bound to, he would have oral sex with her, and makeher have an orgasm- put her at his mercy- but his body had rejected the woman sothoroughly that he couldn't do it.\"The woman was not even beautiful anymore,\" he said, \"but plain. Whenever she'sdressed up, the clothes that she wears hide the bulges of her hips. She actuallylooks okay. But when she's naked, she's a sack of bulging white flesh! Theslenderness that she presents when she's clothed is fake. It doesn't exist.\"Venom poured out of the psychiatrist in ways that I would never have imagined.He was shaking with rage. He wanted desperately to appear cool, and kept onsmoking cigarette after cigarette.He said that the oral sex was even more maddening and disgusting, and that hewas just about to vomit when the friggin' woman actually kicked him in thebelly, rolled him out of his own bed onto the floor, and called him an impotentfaggot.At this point in his narration, the psychiatrist's eyes were burning withhatred. His mouth was quivering. He was pale.\"I have to use your bathroom,\" he said. \"I want to take a bath. I am reeking.Believe it or not, I have pussy breath.\"He was actually weeping, and I would have given anything in the world not to bethere. Perhaps it was my fatigue, or the mesmeric quality of his voice, or theinanity of the situation that created the illusion that I was listening not tothe psychiatrist but to the voice of a male supplicant [* supplicant- onepraying humbly for something] on one of his tapes complaining about minorproblems turned into gigantic affairs by talking obsessively about them. Myordeal ended around nine o'clock in one morning. It was time for me to go toclass and time for the psychiatrist to go and see his own shrink.I went to class then, highly charged with a burning anxiety and a tremendoussensation of discomfort and uselessness. There, I received the final blow; theblow that caused my attempt at a drastic change to collapse. No volition of myown was involved in its collapse. It just happened; not only as if it had beenscheduled, but as if its progression had been accelerated by some unknown hand.The anthropology professor began his lecture about a group of Indians from thehigh plateaus of Bolivia and Peru, the Aymara. He called them the \"ey-MEH-ra,\"elongating the name as if his pronunciation of it was the only accurate one inexistence. He said that the making of chicha- which is pronounced \"CHEE-cha,\"but which he pronounced \"CHAHI-cha,\" an alcoholic beverage made from fermentedcorn- was in the realm of a sect of priestesses who were considered semidivineby the Aymara. He said, in a tone of revelation, that those women were in chargeof making the cooked corn into a mush ready for fermentation by chewing andspitting it, adding in this manner an enzyme found in human saliva. The wholeclass shrieked with contained horror at the mention of human saliva.The professor seemed to be tickled pink. He laughed in little spurts. It was thechuckle of a nasty child. He went on to say that the women were expert chewers,and he called them the \"chahi-cha chewers.\" He looked at the front row of theclassroom, where most of the young women were sitting, and he delivered hispunch line.\"I was p-r-r-rivileged,\" he said with a strange quasi-foreign intonation, \"to beasked to sleep with one of the chahi-cha chewers. The art of chewing thechahi-cha mush makes them develop the muscles around their throat and cheeks tothe point that they can do wonders with them.\"He looked at his bewildered audience and paused for a long time, punctuating thepause with his giggles. \"I'm sure you get my drift,\" he said, and went into fitsof hysterical laughter.The class went wild with the professor's innuendo. The lecture was interruptedby at least five minutes of laughter and a barrage of questions that theprofessor declined to answer, emitting more silly giggles.I felt so compressed by the pressure of the tapes, the psychiatrist's story, andthe professor's \"chahi-cha chewers\" that in one instantaneous sweep I quit thejob, quit school, and drove back to L.A. \"Whatever happened to me with the psychiatrist and the professor ofanthropology,\" I said to don Juan, \"has plunged me into an unknown emotionalstate. I can only call it introspection. I've been talking to myself withoutstop.\"\"Your malady is a very simple one,\" don Juan said, shaking with laughter.Apparently my situation delighted him. It was a delight I could not share,because I failed to see the humor in it.\"Your world is coming to an end,\" he said. \"It is the end of an era for you. Doyou think that the world you have known all your life is going to leave youpeacefully- without any fuss or muss? No! It will wriggle underneath you, andhit you with its tail.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The View I Could Not StandLos Angeles had always been home for me. My choice of Los Angeles had not beenvolitional. To me, staying in Los Angeles has always been the equivalent ofhaving been born there, perhaps even more than that. My emotional attachment toit has always been total. My love for the city of Los Angeles has always been sointense, so much a part of me, that I have never had to voice it. I have neverhad to review it or renew it, ever.I had, in Los Angeles, my family of friends. They were to me part of myimmediate milieu, meaning that I had accepted them totally, the way I hadaccepted the city. One of my friends made the statement once, half in fun, thatall of us hated each other cordially. Doubtless, they could afford feelings likethat themselves, for they had other emotional arrangements at their disposal,like parents and wives and husbands. I had only my friends in Los Angeles.For whatever reason, I was each one's confidant. [* confidant- someone to whomprivate matters are confided] Every one of them poured out to me their problemsand vicissitudes. [* vicissitudes- variations in circumstances or fortunes or inthe development of something] My friends were so close to me that I had neveracknowledged their problems or tribulations as anything but normal. I could talkfor hours to them about the very same things that had horrified me in thepsychiatrist and his tapes.Furthermore, I had never realized that every one of my friends was astoundinglysimilar to the psychiatrist and the professor of anthropology. I had nevernoticed how tense my friends were. All of them smoked compulsively, like thepsychiatrist, but it had never been obvious to me because I smoked just as muchmyself and was just as tense.Their affectation [* affectation- a deliberate pretence or exaggerated display]in speech was another thing that had never been apparent to me, although it wasthere. They always affected a twang of the western United States, but they werevery aware of what they were doing.Nor had I ever noticed their blatant innuendos about a sensuality that they wereincapable of feeling, except intellectually.The real confrontation with myself began when I was faced with the dilemma of myfriend Pete. He came to see me, all battered. He had a swollen mouth, and a redand swollen left eye that had obviously been hit and was turning blue already.Before I had time to ask him what had happened to him, he blurted out that hiswife, Patricia, had gone to a real estate brokers' convention over the weekend,in relation to her job, and that something terrible had happened to her. The wayPete looked, I thought that perhaps Patricia had been injured, or even killed,in an accident.\"Is she all right?\" I asked, genuinely concerned.\"Of course she's all right,\" he barked. \"She's a bitch and a whore, and nothinghappens to bitch whores except that they get frigged, and they like it!\"Pete was rabid. He was shaking, nearly convulsing. His bushy, curly hair wassticking out every which way. Usually, he combed it carefully and slicked hisnatural curls into place. Now, he looked as wild as a Tasmanian devil.\"Everything was normal until today,\" my friend continued. \"Then, this morning,after I came out of the shower, she snapped a towel at my naked butt, and that'swhat made me aware of her shit! I knew instantly that she'd been friggingsomeone else.\"I was puzzled by his line of reasoning. I questioned him further. I asked himhow snapping a towel could reveal anything of this sort to anybody.\"It wouldn't reveal anything to assholes!\" he said with pure venom in his voice.\"But I know Patricia, and on Thursday, before she went to the brokers'convention, she could not snap a towel! In fact, she has never been able to snapa towel in all the time we've been married. Somebody must have taught her to doit, while they were naked! So I grabbed her by the throat and choked the truthout of her! Yes! She's frigging her boss!\"Pete said that he went to Patricia's office to have it out with her boss, butthe man was heavily protected by bodyguards. They threw him out into the parkinglot. He wanted to smash the windows of the office, throw rocks at them, but thebodyguards said that if he did that, he'd land in jail, or even worse, he'd geta bullet in his head.\"Are they the ones who beat you up, Pete?\" I asked him.\"No,\" he said, dejected. \"I walked down the street and went into the salesoffice of a used car lot. I punched the first salesman who came to talk to me.The man was shocked, but he didn't get angry. He said, 'Calm down, sir, calmdown! There's room for negotiation.' When I punched him again in the mouth, hegot pissed off. He was a big guy, and he hit me in the mouth and the eye andknocked me out.\"When I came to my senses,\" Pete continued, \"I was lying on the couch in theiroffice. I heard an ambulance approaching. I knew they were coming for me, so Igot up and ran out. Then I came to see you.\"He began to weep uncontrollably. He got sick to his stomach. He was a mess. Icalled his wife, and in less than ten minutes she was in the apartment. Shekneeled in front of Pete, and swore that she loved only him; that everythingelse she did was pure imbecility, [* imbecility- retardation more severe than amoron but not as severe as an idiot] and that theirs was a love that was amatter of life or death: The others were nothing. She didn't even remember them.Both of them wept to their hearts' content, and of course they forgave eachother. Patricia was wearing sunglasses to hide the hematoma by her right eyewhere Pete had apparently hit her: Pete was left-handed. Both of them wereoblivious to my presence, and when they left, they didn't even know I was there.They just walked out, leaving the door open, hugging each other.Life seemed to continue for me as it always had. My friends acted with me asthey always did. We were, as usual, involved in going to parties, or the movies,or just simply 'chewing the fat', or looking for restaurants where they offered'all you can eat' for the price of one meal.However, despite this pseudo-normality, a strange new factor seemed to haveentered my life. As the subject who was experiencing it, it appeared to me that,all of a sudden, I had become extremely narrow-minded. I had begun to judge myfriends in the same way I had judged the psychiatrist and the professor ofanthropology. Who was I, anyway, to set myself up in judgment of anyone else?I felt an immense sense of guilt. To judge my friends created a mood previouslyunknown to me. But what I considered to be even worse was that not only was Ijudging them, I was finding their problems and tribulations astoundingly banal.[* banal- repeated too often; overfamiliar through overuse]I was the same man. They were my same friends. I had heard their complaints andrenditions of their situations hundreds of times, and I hadn't ever feltanything except a deep identification with whatever I had been listening to. Myhorror at discovering this new mood in myself was staggering.The aphorism [* aphorism- a short instructive phrase] that 'when it rains itpours' couldn't have been more true for me at that moment in my life.The total disintegration of my way of life came when my friend Rodrigo Cummingsasked me to take him to the Burbank airport. From there he was going to fly toNew York. It was a very dramatic and desperate maneuver on his part. Heconsidered it his damnation to be caught in Los Angeles.For the rest of his friends, it was a big joke, and a fact, that he had tried todrive across country to New York various times; and every time he had tried todo it, his car had broken down. Once, he had gone as far as Salt Lake Citybefore his car collapsed. It needed a new motor and he had to junk it there.Most of the time, his cars petered out in the suburbs of Los Angeles.\"What happens to your cars, Rodrigo?\" I asked him once, driven by truthfulcuriosity.\"I don't know,\" he replied with a veiled sense of guilt. And then, in a voiceworthy of the professor of anthropology in his role of revivalist preacher, hesaid, \"Perhaps it is because when I hit the road, I accelerate because I feelfree. I usually open all my windows. I want the wind to blow on my face. I feelthat I'm a kid in search of something new.\"It was obvious to me that his cars, which were always jalopies, were no longercapable of speeding, and he just simply burned their motors out.From Salt Lake City, Rodrigo had returned to Los Angeles, hitchhiking. Ofcourse, he could have hitchhiked to New York, but it had never occurred to him.Rodrigo seemed to be afflicted by the same condition that afflicted me: anunconscious passion for Los Angeles which he wanted to refuse at any cost.Another time, his car was in excellent mechanical condition. It could have madethe whole trip with ease, but Rodrigo was apparently not in any condition toleave Los Angeles. He drove as far as San Bernadino, where he went to see amovie- The Ten Commandments. This movie, for reasons known only to Rodrigo,created in him an unbeatable nostalgia for L.A. He came back, and wept, tellingme how the shagging city of Los Angeles had built a fence around him that didn'tlet him go through. His wife was delighted that he hadn't gone.His girlfriend, Melissa, was even more delighted, although also chagrined [*chagrined- feeling or caused to feel uneasy and self-conscious] because she hadto give back the dictionaries that he had given her.His last desperate attempt to reach New York by plane was rendered even moredramatic because he borrowed money from his friends to pay for the ticket. Hesaid that in this fashion, since he didn't intend to repay them, he was makingsure that he wouldn't come back.I put his suitcases in the trunk of my car and headed with him for the Burbankairport. He remarked that the plane didn't leave until seven o'clock. It wasearly afternoon, and we had plenty of time to go and see a movie. Besides, hewanted to take one last look at Hollywood Boulevard; the center of our lives andactivities.We went to see an epic in Technicolor and Cinerama. It was a long, excruciatingmovie that seemed to rivet Rodrigo's attention. When we got out of the movie, itwas already getting dark. I rushed to Burbank in the midst of heavy traffic. Hedemanded that we go on surface streets rather than the freeway, which was jammedat that hour. The plane was just leaving when we reached the airport. That wasthe final straw. Meek and defeated, Rodrigo went to a cashier and presented histicket to get his money back. The cashier wrote down his name and gave him areceipt and said that his money would be sent within six to twelve weeks fromTennessee, where the accounting offices of the airline were located.We drove back to the apartment building where we both lived. Since he hadn'tsaid good-bye to anybody this time, for fear of losing face, nobody had evernoticed that he had tried to leave one more time. The only drawback was that hehad sold his car. He asked me to drive him to his parents' house, because hisdad was going to give him the money he had spent on the ticket.His father had always been, as far back as I could remember, the man who hadbailed Rodrigo out of every problematic situation that he had ever gotten into.The father's slogan was 'Have no fear, Rodrigo Senior is here!' After he heardRodrigo's request for a loan to pay his other loan, the father looked at myfriend with the saddest expression that I had ever seen. He was having terriblefinancial difficulties himself.Putting his arm around his son's shoulders, he said, \"I can't help you thistime, my boy. Now you should have fear, because Rodrigo Senior is no longerhere.\"I wanted desperately to identify with my friend, to feel his drama the way Ialways had, but I couldn't. I only focused on the father's statement. It soundedto me so final that it galvanized me.I sought don Juan's company avidly. I left everything pending in Los Angeles andmade a trip to Sonora. I told him about the strange mood that I had entered intowith my friends. Sobbing with remorse, I said to him that I had begun to judgethem.\"Don't get so worked up over nothing,\" don Juan said calmly. \"You already knowthat a whole era in your life is coming to an end, but an era doesn't reallycome to an end until the king dies.\"\"What do you mean by that, don Juan?\"\"You are the king, and you are just like your friends. That is the truth thatmakes you shake in your boots. One thing you can do is to accept it at facevalue, which, of course, you can't do. The other thing you can do is to say, 'Iam not like that, I am not like that,' and repeat to yourself that you are notlike that. I promise you, however, that a moment will come when you will realizethat you are like that.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Unavoidable AppointmentThere was something that kept nagging at me in the back of my mind: I had toanswer a most important letter I'd received, and I had to do it at any cost. Myanthropologist friend who was responsible for my meeting don Juan Matus hadwritten me a letter a couple of months earlier. He wanted to know how I wasdoing in my studies of anthropology, and urged me to pay him a visit.What had prevented me from doing it was a mixture of indolence [* indolence-inactivity resulting from a dislike of work] and a deep desire to please. Icomposed three long letters. On rereading each of them, I found them so trite [*trite- repeated too often; overfamiliar through overuse] and obsequious [*obsequious- attempting to win favour from influential people by flattery] that Itore them up.I couldn't express in them the depth of my gratitude; the depth of my feelingsfor him. I rationalized my delay in answering with a genuine resolve to go tosee him, and tell him personally what I was doing with don Juan Matus; but Ikept postponing my imminent trip because I wasn't sure what it was that I wasdoing with don Juan. I wanted someday to show my friend real results. As it was,I had only vague sketches of possibilities, which, in his demanding eyes,wouldn't have been anthropological fieldwork anyway.One day I found out that he had died. His death brought to me one of thosedangerous silent depressions. I had no way to express what I felt because what Iwas feeling was not fully formulated in my mind. It was a mixture of dejection,despondency, and abhorrence at myself for not having answered his letter; fornot having gone to see him.I paid a visit to don Juan Matus soon after that. On arriving at his house, Isat down on one of the crates under his ramada and tried to search for wordsthat would not sound banal to express my sense of dejection over the death of myfriend. For reasons incomprehensible to me, don Juan knew the origin of myturmoil, and the overt reason for my visit to him.\"Yes,\" don Juan said dryly. \"I know that your friend, the anthropologist whoguided you to meet me, has died. For whatever reasons, I knew exactly the momenthe died. I saw it.\"His statements jolted me to my foundations.\"I saw it coming a long time ago. I even told you about it, but you disregardedwhat I said. I'm sure that you don't even remember it.\" I remembered every word he had said, but it had no meaning for me at the time hehad said it.Don Juan had stated that a detail deeply related to our meeting, but not part ofit, was the fact that he had seen my anthropologist friend as a dying man.\"I saw death as an outside force already opening your friend,\" he had said tome. \"Every one of us has an energetic fissure, an energetic crack below thenavel. That crack, which sorcerers call the gap, is closed when a man is in hisprime.\"He had said that, normally, all that is discernible to the sorcerer's eye is atenuous discoloration in the otherwise whitish glow of the luminous sphere. Butwhen a man is close to dying, that gap becomes quite apparent. He had assured methat my friend's gap was wide open.\"What is the significance of all this, don Juan?\" I had asked perfunctorily.\"The significance is a terminal one,\" he had replied. \"The spirit was signalingto me that something was coming to an end. I thought it was my life that wascoming to an end, and I accepted it as gracefully as I could.It dawned on me much, much later that it wasn't my life that was coming to anend, but my entire lineage.\" I didn't know what he was talking about. But how could I have taken all thatseriously? As far as I was concerned, it was, at the time he said it, likeeverything else in my life; just talk.\"Your friend himself told you, though not in so many words, that he was dying,\"don Juan said. \"You acknowledged what he was saying just as you acknowledgedwhat I said; but in both cases, you chose to bypass it.\"I had no comments to make. I was overwhelmed by what he was saying. I wanted tosink into the crate I was sitting on; to disappear, swallowed up by the earth.\"It's not your fault that you bypass things like this,\" he went on. \"It's youth.You have so many things to do, so many people around you. You are not alert. Younever learned to be alert, anyway.\"In the vein of defending the last bastion [* bastion- a stronghold into whichpeople could go for shelter during a battle] of myself- my idea that I waswatchful- I pointed out to don Juan that I had been in life and death situationsthat required my quick wit and vigilance. It wasn't that I lacked the capacityto be alert, but that I lacked the orientation for setting an appropriate listof priorities. Therefore, everything was either important or unimportant to me.\"To be alert doesn't mean to be watchful,\" don Juan said. \"For sorcerers, to bealert means to be aware of the true underlying fabric of the everyday world thatseems extraneous [* extraneous- not essential] to the interaction of the moment.\"On the trip that you took with your friend before you met me, you noticed onlythe details that were obvious. You didn't notice how his death was absorbinghim, and yet something in you knew it.\"I began to protest, to tell him that what he was saying wasn't true.\"Don't hide yourself behind banalities,\" [* banalities- obvious or oftenrepeated remarks] he said in an accusing tone. \"Stand up, if only for the momentyou are with me. Assume responsibility for what you know.\"Don't get lost in the extraneous threads of the world around you; or inunimportant distractions from what's really going on in the fabric around you.If you hadn't been so concerned with yourself and your problems, you would haveknown that that was his last trip. You would have noticed that he was closinghis accounts; seeing the people who helped him; saying good-bye to them.\"Your anthropologist friend had talked to me once,\" don Juan went on. \"Iremembered him so clearly that I wasn't surprised at all when he brought you tome at that bus depot.\"I couldn't help him when he had talked to me. He wasn't the man I was lookingfor, but I wished him well from my sorcerer's emptiness, from my sorcerer'ssilence.\"For this reason, I know that on his last trip, he was saying thank you to thepeople who counted in his life.\"I admitted to don Juan that he was so very right, that there had been so manydetails that I had been aware of, but that they hadn't meant a thing to me atthe time; such as, for instance, my friend's ecstasy in watching the sceneryaround us. He would stop the car just to watch, for hours on end, the mountainsin the distance, or the riverbed, or the desert.I discarded this as the idiotic sentimentality of a middle-aged man. I even madevague hints to him that perhaps he was drinking too much. He told me that indire cases a drink would allow a man a moment of peace and detachment, a momentlong enough to savor something unrepeatable.\"That was, for a fact, the trip for his eyes only,\" don Juan said. \"Sorcererstake such a trip, and, in it, nothing counts except what their eyes can absorb.Your friend was unburdening himself of everything superfluous.\"I confessed to don Juan that I had disregarded what he had said to me about mydying friend because, at an unknown level, I had known that it was true.\"Sorcerers never say things idly,\" he said. \"I am most careful about what I sayto you or to anybody else. The difference between you and me is that I don'thave any time at all, and I act accordingly. You, on the other hand, believethat you have all the time in the world, and you act accordingly. The end resultof our individual behaviors is that I measure everything I do and say, and youdon't.\"I conceded that he was right, but I assured him that whatever he was saying didnot alleviate my turmoil, or my sadness. I blurted out then, uncontrollably,every nuance of my confused feelings. I told him that I wasn't in search ofadvice. I wanted him to prescribe a sorcerer's way to end my anguish. I believedI was really interested in getting from him some natural relaxant, an organicValium, and I said so to him. Don Juan shook his head in bewilderment.\"You are too much,\" he said. \"Next you're going to ask for a sorcerer'smedication to remove everything annoying from you, with no effort at all on yourpart- just the effort of swallowing whatever is given. The more awful the taste,the better the results. That's your Western man's motto. You want results- onepotion and you're cured.\"Sorcerers face things in a different way,\" don Juan continued. \"Since theydon't have any time to spare, they give themselves fully to what's in front ofthem.\"Your turmoil is the result of your lack of sobriety. You didn't have thesobriety to thank your friend properly. That happens to every one of us. Wenever express what we feel, and when we want to, it's too late, because we haverun out of time.\"It's not only your friend who ran out of time. You, too, ran out of it.\"You should have thanked him profusely in Arizona. He took the trouble to takeyou around, and whether you understand it or not, in the bus depot he gave youhis best shot. But the moment when you should have thanked him, you were angrywith him- you were judging him: He was nasty to you, or whatever.\"And then you postponed seeing him. In reality, what you did was to postponethanking him. Now you're stuck with a ghost on your tail. You'll never be ableto pay what you owe him.\"I understood the immensity of what he was saying. Never had I faced my actionsin such a light. In fact, I had never thanked anyone, ever.Don Juan pushed his barb even deeper. \"Your friend knew that he was dying,\" hesaid. \"He wrote you one final letter to find out about your doings. Perhapsunbeknownst to him, or to you, you were his last thought.\"The weight of don Juan's words was too much for my shoulders. I collapsed. Ifelt that I had to lie down. My head was spinning. Maybe it was the setting. Ihad made the terrible mistake of arriving at don Juan's house in the lateafternoon. The setting sun seemed astoundingly golden, and the reflections onthe bare mountains to the east of don Juan's house were gold and purple. The skydidn't have a speck of a cloud. Nothing seemed to move. It was as if the wholeworld were hiding, but its presence was overpowering. The quietness of theSonoran desert was like a dagger. It went to the marrow of my bones. I wanted toleave, to get in my car and drive away. I wanted to be in the city; to get lostin its noise.\"You are having a taste of infinity,\" don Juan said with grave finality. \"I knowit, because I have been in your shoes. You want to run away, to plunge intosomething human, warm, contradictory, stupid, who cares? You want to forget thedeath of your friend.\"But infinity won't let you.\" His voice mellowed. \"It has gripped you in itsmerciless clutches.\"\"What can I do now, don Juan?\" I asked.\"The only thing you can do,\" don Juan said, \"is to keep the memory of yourfriend fresh; to keep it alive for the rest of your life and perhaps evenbeyond. Sorcerers express, in this fashion, the thanks that they can no longervoice. You may think it is a silly way, but that's the best sorcerers can do.\"It was my own sadness, doubtless, which made me believe that the typicallyebullient [* ebullient- joyously unrestrained] don Juan was as sad as I was. Idiscarded the thought immediately. That couldn't be possible.\"Sadness, for sorcerers, is not personal,\" don Juan said, again erupting into mythoughts. \"It is not quite sadness. It's a wave of energy that comes from thedepths of the cosmos, and hits sorcerers when they are receptive; when they arelike radios capable of catching radio waves.\"The sorcerers of olden times, who gave us the entire format of sorcery,believed that there is sadness in the universe, as a force, or a condition; likelight; like intent. And that this perennial force acts especially on sorcerers-particularly because they no longer have any defensive shields. They cannot hidebehind their friends or their studies. They cannot hide behind love, or hatred,or happiness, or misery. They can't hide behind anything.\"The condition of sorcerers,\" don Juan went on, \"is that sadness, for them, isabstract. It doesn't come from coveting or lacking something, or fromself-importance. It doesn't come from me. It comes from infinity. The sadnessyou feel for not thanking your friend is already leaning in that direction.\"My teacher, the nagual Julian,\" he went on, \"was a fabulous actor. He actuallyworked professionally in the theater. He had a favorite story that he used totell in his theater sessions. He used to push me into terrible outbursts ofanguish with it. He said that it was a story for warriors who had everything andyet felt the sting of the universal sadness. I always thought he was telling itfor me, personally.\" Don Juan then paraphrased his teacher, telling me that the story referred to aman suffering from profound melancholy.The man went to see the best doctors of his day and every one of those doctorsfailed to help him. He finally came to the office of a leading doctor, a healerof the soul.The doctor suggested to his patient that perhaps he could find solace, and theend of his melancholy, in love. The man responded that love was no problem forhim, that he was loved perhaps like no one else in the world.The doctor's next suggestion was that maybe the patient should undertake avoyage and see other parts of the world. The man responded that, withoutexaggeration, he had been in every corner of the world.The doctor recommended hobbies like the arts, sports, etc. The man responded toevery one of his recommendations in the same terms: He had done that and had hadno relief.The doctor suspected that the man was possibly an incurable liar. He couldn'thave done all those things, as he claimed. But being a good healer, the doctorhad a final insight.\"Ah!\" the doctor exclaimed. \"I have the perfect solution for you, sir. You mustattend a performance of the greatest comedian of our day. He will delight you tothe point where you will forget every twist of your melancholy. You must attenda performance of the Great Garrick!\"Don Juan said that the man looked at the doctor with the saddest look you canimagine, and said, \"Doctor, if that's your recommendation, I am a lost man andhave no cure. I am the Great Garrick.\" ============================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Breaking PointInner silence is a state of profound quietude.Don Juan defined inner silence as a state of being in which thoughts werecanceled out, and I could function from a level other than that of dailyawareness. He stressed that inner silence meant the suspension of the perennialcompanion of thoughts; the suspension of my internal dialogue.\"The old sorcerers,\" don Juan said, \"called this state inner silence because itis a state in which perception does not depend on using the senses as we areaccustomed to. What is at work during inner silence is another faculty that manhas; the faculty that makes him a magical being; the very faculty that has beencurtailed- not by man himself, but by some extraneous influence.\"\"What is this extraneous influence that curtails the magical faculty of man?\" Iasked.\"That,\" don Juan replied, \"is the topic for a future explanation, and is not asubject of our present discussion, even though it is indeed a most seriousaspect of the sorcery of the shamans of ancient Mexico.\"Inner silence,\" he continued, \"is the stand from which everything stems insorcery. In other words, everything we do leads to that stand, which, likeeverything else in the world of sorcerers, doesn't reveal itself unlesssomething gigantic shakes us.\" Don Juan said that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico devised endless ways to shakethemselves, or other sorcery practitioners at their foundations in order toreach that coveted state of inner silence. They considered the most farfetchedacts, which may seem totally unrelated to the pursuit of inner silence- such asjumping into waterfalls or spending nights hanging upside down from the topbranch of a tree- to be key methods that brought inner silence into being.Following the rationales [* rationale- an explanation of the fundamental factsthat logically justifies some premise or conclusion] of the sorcerers of ancientMexico, don Juan stated categorically [* categorically- in an unqualifiedmanner; unconditionally] that inner silence was accrued; [* accrue- grow byaddition: come into the possession of] accumulated. [* accumulate- collect orgather]In my case, he struggled to guide me to construct a core of inner silence inmyself, and then add to it, second by second on every occasion I practiced it.He explained that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico discovered that eachindividual had a different threshold of inner silence in terms of time; meaningthat inner silence must be kept by each one of us for the length of time of ourspecific threshold before it can work.\"What did those sorcerers consider the sign that inner silence is working, donJuan?\" I asked.\"Inner silence works from the moment you begin to accrue it,\" he replied. \"Whatthe old sorcerers were after was the final, dramatic, end result of reachingthat individual threshold of silence. Some very talented practitioners need onlya few minutes of silence to reach that coveted goal. Others, less talented, needlong periods of silence, perhaps more than one hour of complete quietude, beforethey reach the desired result. The desired result is what the old sorcererscalled stopping the world; the moment when everything around us ceases to bewhat it's always been.\"This is the moment when sorcerers return to the true nature of man,\" don Juanwent on. \"The old sorcerers also called it total freedom. It is the moment when'man the slave' becomes 'man the free being' capable of feats of perception thatdefy our linear imagination.\"Don Juan assured me that inner silence is the avenue that leads to a truesuspension of judgment- to a moment when sensory data emanating from theuniverse at large ceases to be interpreted by the senses; a moment whencognition ceases to be the force which, through usage and repetition, decidesthe nature of the world.\"Sorcerers need a breaking point for the workings of inner silence to set in,\"don Juan said. \"The breaking point is like the mortar that a mason puts betweenbricks. It's only when the mortar hardens that the loose bricks become astructure.\"From the beginning of our association, don Juan had drilled into me the valueand the necessity of inner silence. I did my best to follow his suggestions byaccumulating inner silence second by second. I had no means to measure theeffect of this accumulation, nor did I have any means to judge whether or not Ihad reached any threshold. I simply aimed doggedly at accruing it, not just toplease don Juan, but because the act of accumulating it had become a challengein itself. One day, don Juan and I were taking a leisurely stroll in the main plaza ofHermosillo. It was the early afternoon of a cloudy day. The heat was dry, andactually very pleasant. There were lots of people walking around. There werestores around the plaza. I had been to Hermosillo many times, and yet I hadnever noticed the stores. I knew that they were there, but their presence wasnot something I had been consciously aware of. I couldn't have made a map ofthat plaza if my life depended on it. That day, as I walked with don Juan, I wastrying to locate and identify the stores. I searched for something to use as amnemonic [* mnemonic- involved in aiding the memory] device that would stir myrecollection for later use.\"As I have told you before, many times,\" don Juan said, jolting me out of myconcentration, \"every sorcerer I know, male or female, sooner or later arrivesat a breaking point in their lives.\"\"Do you mean that they have a mental breakdown or something like that?\" I asked\"No, no,\" he said, laughing. \"Mental breakdowns are for persons who indulge inthemselves. Sorcerers are not persons. What I mean is that at a given moment,the continuity of their lives has to break in order for inner silence to set inand become an active part of their structures.\"It's very, very important,\" don Juan went on, \"that you yourself deliberatelyarrive at that breaking point, or that you create it artificially, andintelligently.\"\"What do you mean by that, don Juan?\" I asked, caught in his intriguingreasoning.\"Your breaking point\" he said, \"is to discontinue your life as you know it. Youhave done everything I told you, dutifully and accurately. If you are talented,you never show it. That seems to be your style. You're not slow, but you act asif you were. You're very sure of yourself, but you act as if you were insecure.You're not timid, and yet you act as if you were afraid of people. Everythingyou do points at one single spot; your need to break all that, ruthlessly.\"\"But in what way, don Juan? What do you have in mind?\" I asked, genuinelyfrantic.\"I think everything boils down to one act,\" he said. \"You must leave yourfriends. You must say good-bye to them, for good. It's not possible for you tocontinue on the warriors' path carrying your personal history with you, andunless you discontinue your way of life, I won't be able to go ahead with myinstruction.\"\"Now, now, now, don Juan,\" I said, \"I have to put my foot down. You're askingtoo much of me. To be frank with you, I don't think I can do it. My friends aremy family; my points of reference.\"\"Precisely, precisely,\" he remarked. \"They are your points of reference.Therefore, they have to go. Sorcerers have only one point of reference:infinity.\"\"But how do you want me to proceed, don Juan?\" I asked in a plaintive voice. Hisrequest was driving me up the wall.\"You must simply leave,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"Leave any way you can.\"\"But where would I go?\" I asked.\"My recommendation is that you rent a room in one of those chintzy hotels youknow,\" he said. \"The uglier the place, the better. If the room has drab greencarpet, and drab green drapes, and drab green walls, so much the better- a placecomparable to that hotel I showed you once in Los Angeles.\"I laughed nervously at my recollection of a time when I was driving with donJuan through the industrial side of Los Angeles, where there were onlywarehouses and dilapidated hotels for transients. One hotel in particularattracted don Juan's attention because of its bombastic name: Edward theSeventh. We stopped across the street from it for a moment to look at it.\"That hotel over there,\" don Juan said, pointing at it, \"is to me the truerepresentation of life on Earth for the average person. If you are lucky, orruthless, you will get a room with a view of the street, where you will see thisendless parade of human misery. If you're not that lucky, or that ruthless, youwill get a room on the inside, with windows to the wall of the next building.Think of spending a lifetime torn between those two views, envying the view ofthe street if you're inside, and envying the view of the wall if you're on theoutside, tired of looking out.\"Don Juan's metaphor bothered me no end, for I had taken it all in.Now, faced with the possibility of having to rent a room in a hotel comparableto the Edward the Seventh, I didn't know what to say or which way to go.\"What do you want me to do there, don Juan?\" I asked.\"A sorcerer uses a place like that to die,\" he said, looking at me with anunblinking stare. \"You have never been alone in your life. This is the time todo it. You will stay in that room until you die.\"His request scared me, but at the same time, it made me laugh.\"Not that I'm going to do it, don Juan,\" I said, \"but what would be the criteriato know that I'm dead?- unless you want me to actually die physically.\"\"No,\" he said, \"I don't want your body to die physically. I want your person todie. The two are very different affairs. In essence, your person has very littleto do with your body. Your person is your mind, and believe you me, your mind isnot yours.\"\"What is this nonsense, don Juan, that my mind is not mine?\" I heard myselfasking with a nervous twang in my voice.\"I'll tell you about that subject someday,\" he said, \"but not while you'recushioned by your friends.\"The criteria that indicates that a sorcerer is dead,\" he went on, \"is when itmakes no difference to him whether he has company or whether he is alone. Theday you don't covet the company of your friends, whom you use as shields, that'sthe day that your person has died. What do you say? Are you game?\"\"I can't do it, don Juan,\" I said. \"It's useless that I try to lie to you. Ican't leave my friends.\"\"It's perfectly all right,\" he said, unperturbed. My statement didn't seem toaffect him in the least. \"I won't be able to talk to you anymore, but let's saythat during our time together you have learned a great deal. You have learnedthings that will make you very strong, regardless of whether you come back oryou stray away.\"He patted me on the back and said good-bye to me. He turned around and simplydisappeared among the people in the plaza, as if he had merged with them. For aninstant, I had the strange sensation that the people in the plaza were like acurtain that he had opened and then disappeared behind. The end had come, as dideverything else in don Juan's world: swiftly and unpredictably. Suddenly, theend of don Juan's world was upon me. I was in the throes [* throes- violentpangs of suffering] of it, and I didn't even know how I had gotten into it.I should have been crushed. Yet I wasn't. I didn't know why, but I was elated. Imarveled at the facility with which everything had ended. Don Juan was indeed anelegant being. There were no recriminations or anger or anything of that sort atall. I got in my car and drove, happy as a lark. I was ebullient. Howextraordinary that everything had ended so swiftly, I thought, so painlessly. My trip home was uneventful. In Los Angeles, being in my familiar surroundings,I noticed that I had derived an enormous amount of energy from my last exchangewith don Juan. I was actually very happy, very relaxed, and I resumed what Iconsidered to be my normal life with renewed zest. All my tribulations with myfriends, and my realizations about them, everything that I had said to don Juanin reference to this, were thoroughly forgotten. It was as if something haderased all that from my mind. I marveled a couple of times at the facility I hadin forgetting something that had been so meaningful; and in forgetting it sothoroughly.Everything was as expected. There was one single inconsistency in the otherwiseneat paradigm [* paradigm- systematic arrangement: the generally acceptedperspective of a particular discipline at a given time] of my new old life: Idistinctly remembered don Juan saying to me that my departing from thesorcerers' world was purely academic, and that I would be back.I remembered writting down every word of our exchange. According to my normallinear reasoning and memory, don Juan had never made those statements. How couldI remember things that had never taken place? I pondered uselessly. Mypseudo-recollection was strange enough to make a case for it, but then I decidedthat there was no point in reflecting on it. As far as I was concerned, I wasout of don Juan's milieu.Following don Juan's suggestions in reference to my behavior with those who hadfavored me in any way, I had come to a earthshaking decision for myself: Iresolved to honor and to thank my friends before it was too late.One incident involving my friend Rodrigo, however, toppled my new paradigm andsent it tumbling down to its total destruction.My attitude toward Rodrigo changed radically when I vanquished mycompetitiveness with him. I found out that it was the easiest thing in the worldfor me to project 100 percent into whatever Rodrigo did. In fact, I was exactlylike him, but I didn't know it until I stopped competing with him: Then thetruth emerged for me with maddening vividness.One of Rodrigo's foremost wishes was to finish college. Every semester, heregistered for school and took as many courses as was permitted. Then, as thesemester progressed, he dropped them one by one. Sometimes he would withdrawfrom school altogether. At other times he would keep one three-unit course allthe way through to the bitter end.During the most recent semester, he had kept a course in sociology because heliked it. The final exam was approaching. He told me that he had three weeks tostudy; to read the textbook for the course. He thought that that was anexorbitant [* exorbitant- greatly exceeding bounds of reason or moderation]amount of time to read merely six hundred pages. He considered himself somethingof a speed reader, with a high level of retention; in his opinion, he had anearly 100 percent photographic memory.He thought he had a great deal of time before the exam, so he asked me if Iwould help him recondition his car for his paper route. He wanted to take theright door off in order to throw the paper through that opening with his righthand instead of over the roof with his left.I pointed out to him that he was left-handed, to which he retorted that amonghis many abilities, which none of his friends noticed, was that of beingambidextrous. [* ambidextrous- qually skilful with each hand] He was right aboutthat: I had never noticed it myself.After I helped him to take the door off, he decided to rip out the roof lining,which was badly torn. He said that his car was in optimum mechanical condition,and so he was going to take it to Tijuana, Mexico- which, as a good Angeleno ofthe day, he called 'TJ'- to have it relined for a few bucks.\"We could use a trip,\" he said with glee. He even selected the friends he wouldlike to take. \"In TJ, I'm sure that you'll go to look for used books, becauseyou're an asshole. The rest of us will go to a bordello. I know quite a few.\"It took us a week to rip out all the lining and sand the metal surface toprepare it for its new lining. Rodrigo had two weeks left to study then, and hestill considered that to be too much time.He engaged me then in helping him paint his apartment and redo the floors. Ittook us over a week to paint it and sand the hardwood floors. He didn't want topaint over the wallpaper in one room. We had to rent a machine that removedwallpaper by applying steam to it.Naturally, neither Rodrigo nor I knew how to use the machine properly, and webotched the job horrendously. We ended up having to use Topping; a very finemixture of plaster of paris and other substances that gives a wall a smoothsurface.After all these endeavors, Rodrigo ended up having only two days left to cramsix hundred pages into his head. He went frantically into an all-day andall-night reading marathon, with the help of amphetamines. [* amphetamine- acentral nervous system stimulant that increases energy and decreases appetite]Rodrigo did go to school the day of the exam, and did sit down at his desk, anddid get the multiple-choice exam sheet.What he didn't do was stay awake to take the exam. His body slumped forward, andhis head hit the desk with a terrifying thud.The exam had to be suspended for a while. The sociology teacher becamehysterical, and so did the students sitting around Rodrigo. His body was stiffand icy cold. The whole class suspected the worst: They thought he had died of aheart attack. Paramedics were summoned to remove him. After a cursoryexamination, they pronounced Rodrigo profoundly asleep and took him to ahospital to sleep the effect of the amphetamines off. My projection into Rodrigo Cummings was so total that it frightened me. I wasexactly like him. The similarity became untenable to me. In an act of what Iconsidered to be total, suicidal nihilism, [* nihilism- a revolutionary doctrinethat advocates destruction of the social system for its own sake] I rented aroom in a dilapidated hotel in Hollywood.The carpets were green and had terrible cigarette burns that had obviously beensnuffed out before they turned into full-fledged fires. It had green drapes anddrab green walls. The blinking sign of the hotel shone all night through thewindow.I ended up doing exactly what don Juan had requested, but in a roundabout way. Ididn't do it to fulfill any of don Juan's requirements or with the intention ofpatching up our differences. I did stay in that hotel room for months on end,until my person, like don Juan had proposed, died; or at least until ittruthfully made no difference to me whether I had company or I was alone.After leaving the hotel, I went to live alone, closer to school. I continued mystudies of anthropology, which had never been interrupted, and I started a veryprofitable business with a lady partner.Everything seemed perfectly in order until one day when the realization hit melike a kick in the head that I was going to spend the rest of my life worryingabout my business, or worrying about the phantom choice between being anacademic or a businessman, or worrying about my partner's foibles andshenanigans.True desperation pierced the depths of my being. For the first time in my life,despite all the things that I had done and seen, I had no way out. I wascompletely lost. I seriously began to toy with the idea of the most pragmaticand painless way to end my days.One morning, a loud and insistent knocking woke me up. I thought it was thelandlady, and I was sure that if I didn't answer, she would enter with herpasskey.I opened the door, and there was don Juan! I was so surprised that I was numb. Istammered and stuttered, incapable of saying a word. I wanted to kiss his hand,to kneel in front of him. Don Juan came in and sat down with great ease on theedge of my bed.\"I made the trip to Los Angeles,\" he said, \"just to see you.\"I wanted to take him to breakfast, but he said that he had other things toattend to, and that he had only a moment to talk to me. I hurriedly told himabout my experience in the hotel. His presence had created such havoc that notfor a second did it occur to me to ask him how he had found out where I lived. Itold don Juan how intensely I regretted having said what I had in Hermosillo.\"You don't have to apologize,\" he assured me. \"Every one of us does the samething. Once, I ran away from the sorcerers' world myself, and I had to nearlydie to realize my stupidity.\"The important issue is to arrive at a breaking point in whatever way, andthat's exactly what you have done. Inner silence is becoming real for you. Thisis the reason I am here in front of you, talking to you. Do you see what Imean?\"I thought I understood what he meant. I thought that he had intuited or read,the way he read things in the air, that I was at my wits' end and that he hadcome to bail me out.\"You have no time to lose,\" he said. \"You must dissolve your business enterprisewithin an hour, because one hour is all I can afford to wait- not because Idon't want to wait, but because infinity is pressing me mercilessly. Let's saythat infinity is giving you one hour to cancel yourself out.\"For infinity, the only worthwhile enterprise of a warrior is freedom. Any otherenterprise is fraudulent. Can you dissolve everything in one hour?\"I didn't have to assure him that I could. I knew that I had to do it. Don Juantold me then that once I had succeeded in dissolving everything, he was going towait for me at the marketplace in a town in Mexico. In my effort to think aboutthe dissolution of my business, I overlooked what he was saying. He repeated itand, of course, I thought he was joking.\"How can I reach that town, don Juan? Do you want me to drive, to take a plane?\"I asked.\"Dissolve your business first,\" he commanded. \"Then the solution will come. Butremember, I'll be waiting for you only for an hour.\"He left the apartment, and I feverishly endeavored to dissolve everything I had.Naturally, it took me more than an hour, but I didn't stop to consider thisbecause once I had set the dissolution of the business in motion, its momentumcarried me.It was only when I was through that the real dilemma faced me. I knew then thatI had failed hopelessly. I was left with no business, and no possibilities ofever reaching don Juan.I went to my bed and sought the only solace I could think of: quietude; silence.In order to facilitate the advent of inner silence, don Juan had taught me a wayto sit down on my bed, with the knees bent and the soles of the feet touching,the hands pushing the feet together by holding the ankles. He had given me athick dowel that I always kept at hand wherever I went. It was cut to afourteen-inch length to support the weight of my head if I leaned over and putthe dowel on the floor between my feet, and then placed the other end, which wascushioned, on the spot in the middle of my forehead. Every time I adopted thisposition, I fell sound asleep in a matter of seconds.I must have fallen asleep with my usual facility because I dreamed that I was inthe Mexican town where don Juan had said he was going to meet me. I had alwaysbeen intrigued by this town. The marketplace was open one day a week, and thefarmers who lived in the area brought their products there to be sold.What fascinated me the most about that town was the paved road that led to it.At the very entrance to the town, it went over a steep hill. I had sat manytimes on a bench by a stand that sold cheese, and had looked at that hill. Iwould see people who were coming into town with their donkeys and their loads,but I would see their heads first; as they kept approaching I would see more oftheir bodies, until the moment they were on the very top of the hill, when Iwould see their entire bodies. It seemed to me always that they were emergingfrom the earth, either slowly or very fast, depending on their speed.In my dream, don Juan was waiting for me by the cheese stand. I approached him.\"You made it from your inner silence,\" he said, patting me on the back. \"You didreach your breaking point. For a moment, I had begun to lose hope. But I stuckaround, knowing that you would make it.\"In that dream, we went for a stroll. I was happier than I had ever been. Thedream was so vivid, so terrifyingly real, that it left me no doubts that I hadresolved the problem, even if my resolving it was only a dream-fantasy.Don Juan laughed, shaking his head. He had definitely read my thoughts. \"You'renot in a mere dream,\" he said, \"but who am I to tell you that? You'll know ityourself someday- that there are no dreams from inner silence- because you'llchoose to know it.\"================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Measurements of Cognition'The end of an era' was, for don Juan, an accurate description of a process thatshamans go through in dismantling the structure of the world they know in orderto replace it with another way of understanding the world around them. Don JuanMatus, as a teacher, endeavored from the very instant we met to introduce me tothe cognitive world of the shamans of ancient Mexico.The term 'cognition' was, for me at that time, a bone of tremendous contention.I understood it as the process by which we recognize the world around us.Certain things fall within the realm of that process and are easily recognizedby us all. Other things don't, and remain, therefore, as oddities, things forwhich we nave no adequate comprehension.Don Juan maintained, from the start of our association, that the world of thesorcerers of ancient Mexico was different from ours; not in a shallow way, butdifferent in the way in which the process of cognition was arranged.He maintained that in our world, our cognition requires the interpretation ofsensory data.He said that the universe is composed of an infinite number of energy fieldsthat exist in the universe at large as luminous filaments. Those luminousfilaments act on man as an organism. The response of the organism is to turnthose energy fields into sensory data. Sensory data is then interpreted, andthat interpretation becomes our cognitive system.My understanding of cognition forced me to believe that all humans respond topressure from the world at large using a universal [* universal- a behavioralconvention or pattern characteristic of all members of a particular culture orof all human beings] process; similar to language being a universal process.I reasoned that, just as there is a different syntax for every language,naturally there must simply be a slightly different arrangement for every systemof cognitive interpretation in the world.What I desperately wanted don Juan to say was that their different cognitivesystem was the equivalent of having a different language but that it was alanguage nonetheless.Don Juan's assertion that the shamans of ancient Mexico had a differentcognitive system, however, was for me equivalent to saying that they had adifferent way of communicating that had nothing to do with language.'The end of an era' meant to don Juan that the units of a foreign cognition werebeginning to take hold. The units of my normal cognition, no matter how pleasantand rewarding I felt they had been for me, were beginning to fade. A gravemoment in the life of a thinking man! Perhaps my most cherished unit was my academic life. Unenlightened as I was,anything that threatened my academia I felt as a threat to the very core of mybeing; especially if the attack was veiled or unnoticed.And so it happened with a professor in whom I had put all my trust, ProfessorLorca.I had enrolled in Professor Lorca's course on cognition because he wasrecommended to me as one of the most brilliant academics in existence.Professor Lorca was rather handsome, with blond hair neatly combed to the side.His forehead was smooth, wrinkle-free, giving the appearance of someone who hadnever worried in his life. His clothes were extremely well tailored. He didn'twear a tie; a feature that gave him a boyish look. He would put on a tie only toface important people.On my memorable first class with Professor Lorca, I was bewildered and nervousat seeing how he paced back and forth for minutes that stretched themselves intoan eternity for me. Professor Lorca kept on moving his thin, clenched lips upand down, adding immensities to the tension he was generating in thatclosed-window, stuffy room. Suddenly, he stopped walking. He stood in the centerof the room, a few feet from where I was sitting, and, banging a carefullyrolled newspaper on the podium, he began to talk.\"It'll never be known...\" he began.Everyone in the room at once started anxiously taking notes.\"It'll never be known,\" he repeated, \"what a toad is feeling while he sits atthe bottom of a pond and interprets the toad world around him.\" His voicecarried a tremendous force and finality. \"So, what do you think this thing is?\"He waved the newspaper over his head.He went on to read to the class an article in the newspaper in which the work ofa biologist was reported. The scientist was quoted as describing what frogs feltwhen insects swam above their heads.\"This article shows the carelessness of the reporter, who has obviouslymisquoted the scientist,\" Professor Lorca asserted with the authority of a fullprofessor.\"A scientist, no matter how shoddy his work might be, would never allow himselfto anthropomorphize [* anthropomorphize- ascribe human features to something]the results of his research, unless, of course, he's a nincompoop.\"With this as an introduction, he delivered a most brilliant lecture on theinsular [* insular- suggestive of the isolated life of an island] quality of ourcognitive system; or the cognitive system of any organism, for that matter.He brought to me, in his initial lecture, a barrage of new ideas and made themextremely simple, ready for use.The most novel idea to me was that every individual of every species on thisearth interprets the world around it, using data reported by its specializedsenses. He asserted that human beings cannot even imagine what it must be like,for example, to be in a world ruled by echolocation, [* echolocation-determining the location of something by measuring the time it takes for an echoto return from it] as in the world of bats, where any inferred point ofreference could not even be conceived of by the human mind.He made it quite clear that, from that point of view, no two cognitive systemscould be alike among species.As I left the auditorium at the end of the hour and a half lecture, I felt thatI had been bowled over by the brilliance of Professor Lorca's mind. From thenon, I was his confirmed admirer. I found his lectures more than stimulating andthought provoking. His were the only lectures I had ever looked forward toattending. All his eccentricities meant nothing to me in comparison with hisexcellence as a teacher and as an innovative thinker in the realm of psychology.When I first attended the class of Professor Lorca, I had been working with donJuan Matus for almost two years. It was a well established pattern of behaviorwith me, accustomed as I was to routines, to tell don Juan everything thathappened to me in my everyday world.On the first opportunity I had, I related to him what was taking place withProfessor Lorca. I praised Professor Lorca to the skies and told don Juanunabashedly that Professor Lorca was my role model. Don Juan seemed veryimpressed with my display of genuine admiration, yet he gave me a strangewarning.\"Don't admire people from afar,\" he said. \"That is the surest way to createmythological beings. Get close to your professor, talk to him, see what he'slike as a man. Test him. If your professor's behavior is the result of hisconviction that he is a being who is going to die, then everything he does, nomatter how strange, must be premeditated and final. If what he says turns out tobe just words, he's not worth a hoot.\"I was insulted no end by what I considered to be don Juan's callousness. Ithought he was a little bit jealous of my feelings for Professor Lorca. Oncethat thought was formulated in my mind I felt relieved: I understood everything.\"Tell me, don Juan,\" I said to end the conversation on a different note, \"whatis a being that is going to die, really? I have heard you talk about it so manytimes, but you haven't actually defined it for me.\"\"Human beings are beings that are going to die,\" he said.\"Sorcerers firmly maintain that the only way to have a grip on our world, and onwhat we do in it, is by fully accepting that we are beings on the way to dying.Without this basic acceptance, our lives, our doings, and the world in which welive are unmanageable affairs.\"\"But is the mere acceptance of this so far-reaching?\" I asked in a tone ofquasi-protest.\"You bet your life!\" don Juan said, smiling. \"However, it's not the mereacceptance that does the trick. We have to embody that acceptance and live itall the way through. Sorcerers throughout the ages have said that the view ofour death is the most sobering view that exists.What is wrong with us human beings, and has been wrong since time immemorial, [*immemorial- long past; beyond the limits of memory or tradition or recordedhistory] is that without ever stating it in so many words, we believe that wehave entered the realm of immortality. We behave as if we were never going todie- an infantile arrogance. But even more injurious than this sense ofimmortality is what comes with it: the sense that we can engulf [* engulf- flowover or cover completely] this inconceivable universe with our minds.\"A most deadly juxtaposition [* juxtaposition- a side-by-side position] of ideashad me mercilessly in its grip: don Juan's wisdom and Professor Lorca'sknowledge. Both were difficult, obscure, all-encompassing, and most appealing.There was nothing for me to do except follow the course of events and go withthem wherever they might take me.I followed to the letter don Juan's suggestion about approaching ProfessorLorca. I tried for the whole semester to get close to him; to talk to him. Iwent religiously to his office during his office hours, but he never seemed tohave any time for me. But even though I couldn't speak to him, I admired himunbiasedly. I even accepted that he would never talk to me. It didn't matter tome. What mattered were the ideas that I gathered from his magnificent classes.I reported to don Juan all my intellectual findings. I had done extensivereading on cognition. Don Juan Matus urged me, more than ever, to establishdirect contact with the source of my intellectual revolution.\"It is imperative that you speak to him,\" he said with a note of urgency in hisvoice. \"Sorcerers don't admire people in a vacuum. They talk to them. They getto know them. They establish points of reference. They compare.\"What you are doing is a little bit infantile. You are admiring from a distance.It is very much like what happens to a man who is afraid of women. Finally, hisgonads overrule his fear and compel him to worship the first woman who says'hello' to him.\"I tried doubly hard to approach Professor Lorca, but he was like an impenetrablefortress. When I talked to don Juan about my difficulties, he explained thatsorcerers viewed any kind of activity with people, no matter how minute orunimportant, as a battlefield. In that battlefield, sorcerers performed theirbest magic; their best effort.He assured me that the trick to being at ease in such situations, a thing thathad never been my forte, was to face our opponents openly.He expressed his abhorrence of timid souls who shy away from interaction to thepoint where even though they interact, they merely infer or deduce, in terms oftheir own psychological states, what is going on without actually perceivingwhat is really going on. They interact without ever being part of theinteraction.\"Always look at the man who is involved in a tug of war with you,\" he continued.\"Don't just pull the rope. Look up and see his eyes. You'll know then that he isa man, just like you. No matter what he's saying, no matter what he's doing,he's shaking in his boots, just like you. A look like that renders the opponenthelpless, if only for an instant. Deliver your blow then.\"One day, luck was with me: I cornered Professor Lorca in the hall outside hisoffice.\"Professor Lorca,\" I said, \"do you have a free moment so I could talk to you?\"\"Who in the hell are you?\" he said with the most natural air, as if I were hisbest friend and he were merely asking me how I felt that day.Professor Lorca was as rude as anyone could be, but his words didn't have theeffect of rudeness on me. He grinned at me with tight lips, as if encouraging meto leave or to say something meaningful.\"I am an anthropology student, Professor Lorca,\" I said. \"I am involved in afield situation where I have the opportunity to learn about the cognitive systemof sorcerers.\"Professor Lorca looked at me with suspicion and annoyance. His eyes seemed to betwo blue points filled with spite. He combed his hair backward with his hand, asif it had fallen on his face.\"I work with a real sorcerer in Mexico,\" I continued, trying to encourage aresponse. \"He's a real sorcerer, mind you. It has taken me over a year just towarm him up so he would consent to talk to me.\"Professor Lorca's face relaxed. He opened his mouth and, waving a most delicatehand in front of my eyes, as if he were twirling pizza dough with it, he spoketo me. I couldn't help noticing his enameled gold cuff links, which matched hisgreenish blazer to perfection.\"And what do you want from me?\" he said.\"I want you to hear me out for a moment,\" I said, \"and see if whatever I'm doingmay interest you.\"He made a gesture of reluctance and resignation with his shoulders, opened thedoor of his office, and invited me to come in. I knew that I had no time at allto waste and I gave him a very direct description of my field situation. I toldhim that I was being taught procedures that had nothing to do with what I hadfound in the anthropological literature about shamanism.He moved his lips for a moment without saying a word. When he spoke, he pointedout that the flaw of anthropologists in general had been that they never allowthemselves sufficient time to become fully cognizant of all the nuances of theparticular cognitive system used by the people they are studying.He defined 'cognition' as a system of interpretation, which through usage makesit possible for individuals to utilize, with the utmost expertise, all thenuances of meaning that make up the particular social milieu underconsideration.Professor Lorca's words illuminated the total scope of my field-work. Withoutgaining command of all the nuances of the cognitive system of the shamans ofancient Mexico, it would have been thoroughly superfluous for me to formulateany idea about that world. If Professor Lorca had not said another word to me,what he had just voiced would have been more than sufficient. What followed wasa marvelous discourse on cognition.\"Your problem,\" Professor Lorca said, \"is that the cognitive system of oureveryday world with which we are all familiar, virtually from the day we areborn, is not the same as the cognitive system of the sorcerers' world.\"This statement created a state of euphoria in me. I thanked Professor Lorcaprofusely, and assured him that there was only one course of action in my case:to follow his ideas through hell or high water.\"What I have told you, of course, is general knowledge,\" he said as he usheredme out of his office. \"Anyone who reads is aware of what I have been tellingyou.\"We parted almost friends. My account to don Juan of my success in approachingProfessor Lorca was met with a strange reaction. Don Juan seemed, on the onehand, to be elated, and on the other, concerned.\"I have the feeling that your professor is not quite what he claims to be,\" hesaid. \"That's, of course, from a sorcerer's point of view. Perhaps it would bewise to quit now, before all this becomes too involved and consuming. One of thehigh arts of sorcerers is to know when to stop. It appears to me that you'vegotten from your professor all you can get from him.\"I immediately reacted with a barrage of defenses on behalf of Professor Lorca.Don Juan calmed me down. He said that it wasn't his intention to criticize orjudge anybody, but that to his knowledge, very few people knew when to quit, andeven fewer knew how to actually utilize their knowledge.In spite of don Juan's warnings, I didn't quit. Instead, I became ProfessorLorca's faithful student, follower, and admirer. He seemed to take a genuineinterest in my work, although he felt frustrated no end with my reluctance andinability to formulate clear-cut concepts about the cognitive system of thesorcerers' world.One day, Professor Lorca formulated for me the concept of the scientist-visitorto another cognitive world. He conceded that he was willing to be open-minded,and as a social scientist toy with the possibility of a different cognitivesystem.He envisioned an actual research in which protocols would be gathered andanalyzed. Problems of cognition would be devised and given to the shamans I knewto measure, for instance, their capacity to focus their cognition on two diverseaspects of behavior. He thought that the test would begin with a simple paradigmin which they would try to comprehend and retain written text that they readwhile they played poker. The test would escalate, to measure, for instance,their capacity to focus their cognition on complex things that were being saidto them while they slept, and so on. Professor Lorca wanted a linguisticanalysis to be performed on the shamans' utterances. He wanted an actualmeasurement of their responses in terms of their speed and accuracy, and othervariables that would become prevalent as the project progressed.Don Juan veritably laughed his head off when I told him about Professor Lorca'sproposed measurements of the cognition of shamans.\"Now, I truly like your professor,\" he said. \"But you can't be serious aboutthis idea of measuring our cognition. What could your professor get out ofmeasuring our responses? He'll get the conviction that we are a bunch of morons,because that's what we are. We cannot possibly be more intelligent, faster thanthe average man.\"It's not his fault, though, to believe he can make measurements of cognitionacross worlds. The fault is yours. You have failed to express to your professorthat when sorcerers talk about the cognitive world of the shamans of ancientMexico they are talking about things for which we have no equivalent in theworld of everyday life.\"For instance, perceiving energy directly as it flows in the universe is a unitof cognition that shamans live by. They see how energy flows, and they followits flow.\"If its flow is obstructed, they move away to do something entirely different.Shamans see lines in the universe. Their art, or their job, is to choose theline that will take them perception-wise to regions that have no name. You cansay that shamans react immediately to the lines of the universe. They see humanbeings as luminous balls, and they search in them for their flow of energy.Naturally, they react instantly to this sight. It's part of their cognition.\"I told don Juan that I couldn't possibly talk about all this to Professor Lorcabecause I hadn't done any of the things that he was describing. My cognition hadremained the same.\"Ah!\" he exclaimed. \"It's simply that you haven't had the time yet to embody theunits of cognition of the shamans' world.\"I left don Juan's house more confused than ever. There was a voice inside methat virtually demanded that I end all endeavors with Professor Lorca.I understood how right don Juan was when he said to me once that thepracticalities that scientists were interested in were conducive to buildingmore and more complex machines.They were not the practicalities that changed an individual's life course fromwithin. They were not geared to reaching the vastness of the universe as apersonal, experiential affair.The stupendous machines in existence, or those in the making, were culturalaffairs, the attainment of which had to be enjoyed vicariously, even by thecreators of those machines themselves. The only reward for them was monetary.In pointing out all of that to me, don Juan had succeeded in placing me in amore inquisitive frame of mind. I really began to question the ideas ofProfessor Lorca, something I had never done before. Meanwhile, Professor Lorcakept spouting astounding truths about cognition. Each declaration was moresevere than the preceding one and, therefore, more incisive.At the end of my second semester with Professor Lorca, I had reached an impasse.There was no way on earth for me to bridge the two lines of thought: don Juan'sand Professor Lorca's. They were on parallel tracks.I understood Professor Lorca's drive to qualify and quantify the study ofcognition. Cybernetics was just around the comer at that time, and the practicalaspect of the studies of cognition was a reality.But so was don Juan's world, which could not be measured with the standard toolsof cognition. I had been privileged to witness it, in don Juan's actions, but Ihadn't experienced it myself. I felt that that was the drawback that madebridging those two worlds impossible.I told all this to don Juan on one of my visits to him. He said that what Iconsidered to be my drawback, and therefore the factor that made bridging thesetwo worlds impossible, wasn't accurate. In his opinion, the flaw was somethingmore encompassing than one man's individual circumstances.\"Perhaps you can recall what I said to you about one of our biggest flaws asaverage human beings,\" he said.I couldn't recall anything in particular. He had pointed out so many flaws thatplagued us as average human beings that my mind reeled.\"You want something specific,\" I said, \"and I can't think of it.\"\"The big flaw I am talking about,\" he said, \"is something you ought to bear inmind every second of your existence. For me, it's the issue of issues, which Iwill repeat to you over and over until it comes out of your ears.\"After a long moment, I gave up any further attempt to remember.\"We are beings on our way to dying,\" he said. \"We are not immortal, but webehave as if we were. This is the flaw that brings us down as individuals andwill bring us down as a species someday.\"Don Juan stated that the sorcerers' advantage over their average fellow men isthat sorcerers know that they are beings on their way to dying and they don'tlet themselves deviate from that knowledge. He emphasized that an enormouseffort must be employed in order to elicit and maintain this knowledge as atotal certainty.\"Why is it so hard for us to admit something that is so truthful?\" I asked,bewildered by the magnitude of our internal contradiction.\"It's really not man's fault,\" he said in a conciliatory tone. \"Someday, I'lltell you more about the forces that drive a man to act like an ass.\"There wasn't anything else to say. The silence that followed was ominous. Ididn't even want to know what the forces were that don Juan was referring to.\"It is no great feat for me to assess your professor at a distance,\" don Juanwent on. \"He is an immortal scientist. He is never going to die. And when itcomes to any concerns about dying, I am sure that he has taken care of themalready. He has a plot to be buried in, and a hefty life insurance policy thatwill take care of his family. Having fulfilled those two mandates, he doesn'tthink about death anymore. He thinks only about his work.\"Professor Lorca makes sense when he talks,\" don Juan continued, \"because he isprepared to use words accurately. But he's not prepared to take himselfseriously as a man who is going to die. Being immortal, he wouldn't know how todo that.\"It makes no difference what complex machines scientists can build. The machinescan in no way help anyone face the unavoidable appointment: the appointment withinfinity.\"The nagual Julian used to tell me,\" he went on, \"about the conquering generalsof ancient Rome. When they would return home victorious, gigantic parades werestaged to honor them.\"Displaying the treasures that they had won, and the defeated people that theyhad turned into slaves, the conquerors paraded; riding in their war chariots.Riding with them was always a slave whose job was to whisper in their ear thatall fame and glory is but transitory.\"If we are victorious in any way,\" don Juan went on, \"we don't have anyone towhisper in our ear that our victories are fleeting.\"Sorcerers, however, do have the upper hand. As beings on their way to dying,they have someone whispering in their ear that everything is ephemeral. Thewhisperer is death; the infallible advisor; the only one who won't ever tell youa lie.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"Saying Thank You\"Warrior travelers don't leave any debts unpaid,\" don Juan said.\"What are you talking about, don Juan?\" I asked.\"It is time that you square certain indebtedness you have incurred in the courseof your life,\" he said. \"Not that you will ever pay in full, mind you, but youmust make a gesture. You must make a token payment in order to atone; [* atone-make amends for] in order to appease [* appease- gain the good will of]infinity.\"You told me about your two friends who meant so much to you, Patricia Turnerand Sandra Flanagan. It's time for you to go and find them, and to make to eachof them one gift in which you spend everything you have. You have to make twogifts that will leave you penniless. That's the gesture.\"\"I don't know where they are, don Juan,\" I said, almost in a mood of protest.\"To find them is your challenge. In your search for them, you will not leave anystone unturned.\"What you intend to do is something very simple, and yet nearly impossible. Youwant to cross over the threshold of personal indebtedness and in one sweep befree in order to proceed. If you cannot cross that threshold, there won't be anypoint in trying to continue with me.\"\"But where did you get the idea of this task for me?\" I asked. \"Did you inventit yourself because you think it is appropriate?\"\"I don't invent anything,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"I got this task frominfinity itself. It's not easy for me to say all this to you. If you think thatI'm enjoying myself pink with your tribulations, you're wrong.\"The success of your mission means more to me than it does to you. If you fail,you have very little to lose. What? Your visits to me. Big deal. But I wouldlose you, and that means to me losing either the continuity of my lineage or thepossibility of your closing it with a golden key.\"Don Juan stopped talking. He always knew when my mind became feverish withthoughts.\"I have told you over and over that warrior travelers are pragmatists,\" he wenton. \"They are not involved in sentimentalism, or nostalgia, or melancholy. Forwarrior travelers, there is only struggle, and it is a struggle with no end.\"If you think that you have come here to find peace, or that this is a lull inyour life, you're wrong. This task of paying your debts is not guided by anyfeelings that you know about. It is guided by the purest sentiment; thesentiment of a warrior traveler who is about to dive into infinity. And justbefore he does, he turns around to say thank you to those who favored him.\"You must face this task with all the gravity it deserves,\" he continued. \"It isyour last stop before infinity swallows you. In fact, unless a warrior traveleris in a sublime state of being, infinity will not touch him with a ten footpole. So, don't spare yourself. Don't spare any effort. Push it mercilessly, butelegantly, all the way through.\" I had met the two people don Juan had referred to as 'my two friends who meantso much to me' while going to junior college. I used to live in the garageapartment of the house belonging to Patricia Turner's parents.In exchange for room and board, I took care of vacuuming the pool, raking theleaves, putting the trash out, and making breakfast for Patricia and myself. Iwas also the handyman in the house as well as the family chauffeur. I drove Mrs.Turner to do her shopping, and I bought liquor for Mr. Turner, which I had tosneak into the house and then into his studio.He was an insurance executive who was a solitary drinker. He had promised hisfamily that he was not going to touch the bottle ever again after some seriousfamily altercations due to his excessive drinking.He confessed to me that he had tapered off enormously, but that he needed a swigfrom time to time. His studio was, of course, off limits to everybody except me.I was supposed to go in to clean it, but what I really did was hide his bottlesinside a beam that appeared to support an arch in the ceiling in the studio, butthat was actually hollow. I had to sneak the bottles in, and sneak the emptiesout and dump them at the market.Patricia was a drama and music major in college and a fabulous singer. Her goalwas to sing in musicals on Broadway. It goes without saying that I fell headover heels in love with Patricia Turner. She was very slim and athletic, abrunette with angular features, and was about a head taller than I am; myultimate requisite for going bananas over any woman.I seemed to fulfill a deep need in her; the need to nurture someone, especiallyafter she realized that her daddy trusted me implicitly. She became my littlemommy. I couldn't even open my mouth without her consent. She watched me like ahawk. She even wrote term papers for me, read textbooks, and gave me synopses ofthem.And I liked it, but not because I wanted to be nurtured. I don't think that thatneed was ever part of my cognition. I relished the fact that she did it. Irelished her company.She used to take me to the movies daily. She had passes to all the big movietheaters in Los Angeles that had been given to her father courtesy of some moviemoguls. Mr. Turner never used them himself. He felt that it was beneath hisdignity to flash movie passes.The movie clerks always made the recipients of such passes sign a receipt.Patricia had no qualms about signing anything, but sometimes the nasty clerkswanted Mr. Turner to sign. When I went to do that, they were not satisfied withonly the signature of Mr. Turner. They demanded a driver's license.One of them, a sassy young guy, made a remark that cracked him up, and me, too,but which sent Patricia into a fit of fury.\"I think you're Mr. Turd,\" he said with the nastiest smile you could imagine,\"not Mr. Turner.\"I could have sloughed off the remark, but then he subjected us to the profoundhumiliation of refusing us entrance to see Hercules starring Steve Reeves.Usually, we went everywhere with Patricia's best friend, Sandra Flanagan, wholived next door with her parents. Sandra was quite the opposite of Patricia. Shewas just as tall, but her face was round, with rosy cheeks and a sensuous mouth.She was healthier than a raccoon.She had no interest in singing. She was only interested in the sensual pleasuresof the body. She could eat and drink anything and digest it; and the featurethat finished me off about her was that after she had polished off her ownplate, she managed to do the same with mine; a thing that, being a picky eater,I had never been able to do in all my life.She was also extremely athletic, but in a rough, wholesome way. She could punchlike a man and kick like a mule.As a courtesy to Patricia, I used to do the same chores for Sandra's parentsthat I did for hers: vacuuming their pool, raking the leaves from their lawn,taking the trash out on trash day, and incinerating papers and flammable trash.That was the time in Los Angeles when the air pollution was increased by the useof backyard incinerators.Perhaps it was because of the proximity, or the ease of those young women that Iended up madly in love with both of them.I went to seek advice from a very strange young man who was my friend; Nicholasvan Hooten. He had two girlfriends, and he lived with both of them; apparentlyin a state of bliss. He began by giving me, he said, the simplest advice: how tobehave in a movie theater if you had two girlfriends.He said that whenever he went to a movie with his two girlfriends, all hisattention was always centered on whoever sat to his left. After a while, the twogirls would go to the bathroom and, on their return, he would have them changethe seating arrangement. Anna would sit where Betty had been sitting, and nobodyaround them was the wiser.He assured me that this was the first step in a long process of breaking thegirls into a matter-of-fact acceptance of the trio situation; Nicholas wasrather corny, and he used that trite French expression: menage a trois.I followed his advice and went to a theater that showed silent movies on FairfaxAvenue in Los Angeles with Patricia and Sandy. I sat Patricia to my left andpoured all my attention on her. They went to the bathroom, and when theyreturned I told them to switch places. I started then to do what Nicholas vanHooten had advised, but Patricia would not put up with any nonsense like that.She stood up and left the theater, offended, humiliated, and raving mad. Iwanted to run after her and apologize, but Sandra stopped me.\"Let her go,\" she said with a poisonous smile. \"She's a big girl. She has enoughmoney to get a taxi and go home.\"I fell for it and remained in the theater kissing Sandra, rather nervously, andfilled with guilt. I was in the middle of a passionate kiss when I felt someonepulling me backward by the hair. It was Patricia. The row of seats was loose andtilted backward. Athletic Patricia jumped out of the way before the seats wherewe were sitting crashed on the row of seats behind. I heard the frightenedscreams of two movie watchers who were sitting at the end of the row, by theaisle.Nicholas van Hooten's tip was miserable advice. Patricia, Sandra, and I returnedhome in absolute silence. We patched up our differences, in the midst of veryweird promises, tears- the works.The outcome of our three sided relationship was that, in the end, we nearlydestroyed ourselves. We were not prepared for such an endeavor. We didn't knowhow to resolve the problems of affection, morality, duty, and social mores.I couldn't leave one of them for the other, and they couldn't leave me. One day,at the climax of a tremendous upheaval, and out of sheer desperation, all threeof us fled in different directions, never to see one another again.I felt devastated. Nothing of what I did could erase their impact on my life. Ileft Los Angeles and got busy with endless things in an effort to placate mylonging.Without exaggerating in the least, I can sincerely say that I fell into thedepths of hell- I believed- never to emerge again. If it hadn't been for the influence that don Juan had on my life and my person,I would never have survived my private demons. I told don Juan that I knew thatwhatever I had done was wrong; that I had no business engaging such wonderfulpeople in such sordid, stupid shenanigans that I had no preparation to face.\"What was wrong,\" don Juan said, \"was that the three of you were lostegomaniacs. Your self-importance nearly destroyed you. If you don't haveself-importance, you have only feelings.\"Humor me,\" he went on, \"and do the following simple and direct exercise thatcould mean the world to you: Remove from your memory of those two girls anystatements that you make to yourself such as 'She said this or that to me, andshe yelled, and the other one yelled, at me!' and remain at the level of yourfeelings. If you hadn't been so self-important, what would you have had as theirreducible residue?\"\"My unbiased love for them,\" I said, nearly choking.\"And is it less today than it was then?\" don Juan asked.\"No, it isn't, don Juan,\" I said in truthfulness, and I felt the same pang ofanguish that had chased me for years.\"This time, embrace them from your silence,\" he said. \"Don't be a meagerasshole. Embrace them totally for the last time. But intend that this is thelast time on Earth. Intend it from your darkness. If you are worth your salt,\"he went on, \"when you make your gift to them, you'll sum up your entire lifetwice. Acts of this nature make warriors airborne, almost vaporous.\" Following don Juan's commands, I took the task to heart. I realized that if Ididn't emerge victorious, don Juan was not the only one who was going to loseout. I would also lose something, and whatever I was going to lose was asimportant to me as what don Juan had described as being important to him. I wasgoing to lose my chance to face infinity and be conscious of it.The memory of Patricia Turner and Sandra Flanagan put me in a terrible frame ofmind. The devastating sense of irreparable loss that had chased me all theseyears was as vivid as ever. When don Juan exacerbated that feeling, I knew for afact that there are certain things that can remain with us, in don Juan's terms,for life and perhaps beyond. I had to find Patricia Turner and Sandra Flanagan.Don Juan's final recommendation was that if I did find them, I could not staywith them. I could have time only to atone; to envelop each of them with all theaffection I felt; without the angry voices of recrimination, self-pity, oregomania.I embarked on the colossal task of finding out what had become of them, wherethey were. I began by asking questions of the people who knew their parents.Their parents had moved out of Los Angeles, and nobody could give me a lead asto where to find them. There was no one to talk to. I thought of putting apersonal ad in the paper. But then I thought that perhaps they had moved out ofCalifornia. I finally had to hire a private investigator. Through hisconnections with official offices of records and whatnot, he located them withina couple of weeks.They lived in New York, a short distance from one other, and their friendshipwas as close as it had ever been. I went to New York and tackled Patricia Turnerfirst. She hadn't made it to stardom on Broadway the way she had wanted to, butshe was part of a production. I didn't want to know whether it was in thecapacity of a performer or as management.I visited her in her office. She didn't tell me what she did. She was shocked tosee me. What we did was just sit together and hold hands and weep. I didn't tellher what I did either. I said that I had come to see her because I wanted togive her a gift that would express my gratitude, and that I was embarking on ajourney from which I did not intend to come back.\"Why such ominous words?\" she asked, apparently genuinely alarmed. \"What are youplanning to do? Are you ill? You don't look ill.\"\"It was a metaphorical statement,\" I assured her. \"I'm going back to SouthAmerica, and I intend to seek my fortune there. The competition is ferocious,and the circumstances are very harsh, that's all. If I want to succeed, I willhave to give all I have to it.\"She seemed relieved, and hugged me. She looked the same, except much bigger,much more powerful, more mature, very elegant. I kissed her hands and the mostoverwhelming affection enveloped me. Don Juan was right. Deprived ofrecriminations, all I had were feelings.\"I want to make you a gift, Patricia Turner,\" I said. \"Ask me anything you want,and if it is within my means, I'll get it for you.\"\"Did you strike it rich?\" she said and laughed. \"What's great about you is thatyou never had anything, and you never will. Sandra and I talk about you nearlyevery day. We imagine you parking cars, living off women, et cetera, et cetera.I'm sorry, we can't help ourselves, but we still love you.\"I insisted that she tell me what she wanted. She began to weep and laugh at thesame time.\"Are you going to buy me a mink coat?\" she asked me between sobs.I ruffled her hair and said that I would.\"If you don't like it, you take it back to the store and get the money back,\" Isaid.She laughed and punched me the way she used to. She had to go back to work, andwe parted after I promised her that I would come back again to see her, but thatif I didn't, I wanted her to understand that the force of my life was pulling meevery which way, yet I would keep the memory of her in me for the rest of mylife and perhaps beyond.I did return, but only to see from a distance how they delivered the mink coatto her. I heard her screams of delight.That part of my task was finished. I left, but I wasn't vaporous, the way donJuan had said I was going to be. I had opened up an old wound and it had startedto bleed.It wasn't quite raining outside: It was a fine mist that seemed to penetrate allthe way to the marrow of my bones.Next, I went to see Sandra Flanagan. She lived in one of the suburbs of New Yorkthat is reached by train. I knocked on her door. Sandra opened it and looked atme as if I were a ghost. All the color drained out of her face. She was morebeautiful than ever, perhaps because she had filled out and looked as big as ahouse.\"Why, you, you, you!\" she stammered, not quite capable of articulating my name.She sobbed, and she seemed indignant and reproachful for a moment. I didn't giveher the chance to continue. My silence was total. In the end, it affected her.She let me in and we sat down in her living room.\"What are you doing here?\" she said, quite a bit calmer. \"You can't stay! I'm amarried woman! I have three children! And I'm very happy in my marriage.\"Shooting her words out rapidly, like a machine gun, she told me that her husbandwas very dependable, not too imaginative but a good man, that he was notsensual, that she had to be very careful because he tired very easily when theymade love, that he got sick easily and sometimes couldn't go to work, but thathe had managed to produce three beautiful children, and that after her thirdchild, her husband, whose name seemed to be Herbert, had just simply quit. Hedidn't have it anymore, but it didn't matter to her.I tried to calm her down by assuring her over and over that I had come to visither only for a moment, that it was not my intention to alter her life or tobother her in any way. I described to her how hard it had been to find her.\"I have come here to say good-bye to you,\" I said, \"and to tell you that you arethe love of my life. I want to make you a token gift, a symbol of my gratitudeand my undying affection.\"She seemed to be deeply affected. She smiled openly the way she used to. Theseparation between her teeth made her look childlike. I commented to her thatshe was more beautiful than ever, which was the truth to me.She laughed and said that she was going on a strict diet, and if she had knownthat I was coming to see her, she would have started her diet a long time ago.But she would start now, and I would find her the next time as lean as she hadalways been.She reiterated the horror of our life together and how profoundly affected shehad been. She had even thought, in spite of being a devout Catholic, ofcommitting suicide, but she had found in her children the solace that sheneeded. Whatever we had done were quirks of youth that would never be vacuumedaway, but had to be swept under the rug.When I asked if there was some gift that I could make to her as a token of mygratitude and affection for her, she laughed and said exactly what PatriciaTurner had said: that I didn't have a pot to piss in, nor would I ever have one,because that's the way I was made. I insisted that she name something.\"Can you buy me a station wagon where all my children could fit?\" she said,laughing. \"I want a Pontiac, or an Oldsmobile, with all the trimmings.\"She said that knowing in her heart of hearts that I could not possibly make hersuch a gift. But I did.I drove the dealer's car, following him as he delivered the station wagon to herthe next day, and from the parked car where I was hiding, I heard her surprise.But congruous with her sensual being, her surprise was not an expression ofdelight. It was a bodily reaction, a sob of anguish, of bewilderment. She cried,but I knew that she was not crying because she had received the gift. She wasexpressing a longing that had echoes in me. I crumpled in the seat of the car.On my train ride to New York, and my flight to Los Angeles, the feeling thatpersisted was that my life was running out: It was running out of me likeclutched sand. I didn't feel in any way liberated or changed by saying thank youand good-bye.Quite the contrary, I felt the burden of that weird affection more deeply thanever. I felt like weeping. What ran through my mind over and over were thetitles that my friend Rodrigo Cummings had invented for books that were never tobe written. He specialized in writing titles.His favorite was \"We'll All Die in Hollywood\": Another was \"We'll Never Change\":And my favorite, the one that I bought for ten dollars, was \"From the Life andSins of Rodrigo Cummings.\" All those titles played in my mind. I was RodrigoCummings, and I was stuck in time and space, and I did love two women more thanmy life, and that would never change. And like the rest of my friends, I woulddie in Hollywood.I told don Juan all of this in my report of what I considered to be mypseudo-success. He discarded it shamelessly. He said that what I felt was merelythe result of indulging and self-pity, and that in order to say good-bye andthank you, and really mean it and sustain it, sorcerers had to remakethemselves.\"Vanquish your self-pity right now,\" he demanded. \"Vanquish the idea that youare hurt and what do you have as the irreducible residue?\"What I had as the irreducible residue was the feeling that I had made myultimate gift to both of them. Not in the spirit of renewing anything, orharming anyone, including myself, but in the true spirit that don Juan had triedto point out to me- in the spirit of a warrior traveler whose only virtue, as hehad said, is to keep alive the memory of whatever has affected him; whose onlyway to say thank you and good-bye was by this act of magic: of storing in hissilence whatever he has loved. ================================================================= Beyond Syntax"},{"pageContent":"The UsherI was in don Juan's house in Sonora, sound asleep in my bed, when he woke me up.I had stayed up practically all night, mulling over concepts that he hadexplained to me.\"You have rested enough,\" he said firmly, almost gruffly, as he shook me by theshoulders. \"Don't indulge in being fatigued. Your fatigue is more than fatigue.Its a desire not to be bothered. Something in you resents being bothered. Butit's most important that you exacerbate that part of you until it breaks down.Let's go for a hike.\"Don Juan was right. There was some part of me that resented immensely beingbothered. I wanted to sleep for days and not think about don Juan's sorceryconcepts anymore. Thoroughly against my will, I got up and followed him. DonJuan had prepared a meal, which I devoured as if I hadn't eaten for days, andthen we walked out of the house and headed east, toward the mountains. I hadbeen so dazed that I hadn't noticed that it was early morning until I saw thesun, which was right above the eastern range of mountains. I wanted to commentto don Juan that I had slept all night without moving, but he hushed me. He saidthat we were going to go on an expedition to the mountains to search forspecific plants.\"What are you going to do with the plants you are going to collect, don Juan?\" Iasked him as soon as we had started off.\"They are not for me,\" he said with a grin. \"They are for a friend of mine, abotanist and pharmacist. He makes potions with them.\"\"Is he a Yaqui, don Juan? Does he live here in Sonora?\" I asked.\"No, he isn't a Yaqui, and he doesn't live here in Sonora. You'll meet himsomeday.\"\"Is he a sorcerer, don Juan?\"\"Yes, he is,\" he replied dryly.I asked him then if I could take some of the plants to be identified at theBotanical Garden at UCLA.\"Surely, surely!\" he said.I had found out in the past that whenever he said \"surely,\" he didn't mean it.It was obvious that he had no intention whatsoever of giving me any specimensfor identification. I became very curious about his sorcerer friend, and askedhim to tell me more about him, perhaps describe him, telling me where he livedand how he got to meet him.\"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\" don Juan said, as if I were a horse. \"Hold it, holdit! Who are you? Professor Lorca? Do you want to study his cognitive system?\"We went deep into the arid foothills. Don Juan walked steadily for hours. Ithought that the task of the day was going to be just to walk. He finallystopped and sat down on the shaded side of the foothills.\"It is time that you start on one of the biggest projects of sorcery,\" don Juansaid.\"What is this project of sorcery that you're talking about, don Juan?\" Iinquired.\"It's called the recapitulation,\" he said. \"The old sorcerers used to call itrecounting the events of your life, and for them, it started as a simpletechnique; a device to aid them in remembering what they were doing and sayingto their disciples. For their disciples, the technique had the same value: Itallowed them to remember what their teachers had said and done to them. It tookterrible social upheavals, like being conquered and vanquished several times,before the old sorcerers realized that their technique had far-reachingeffects.\"\"Are you referring, don Juan, to the Spanish conquest?\" I asked.\"No,\" he said. \"That was just the icing on the cake. There were other upheavalsbefore that, more devastating. When the Spaniards got here, the old sorcerersdidn't exist any longer. The disciples of those who had survived other upheavalswere very cagey by then. They knew how to take care of themselves. It is thatnew crop of sorcerers who renamed the old sorcerers' technique recapitulation.\"There's an enormous premium on time,\" he continued. \"For sorcerers in general,time is of the essence. The challenge I am faced with is that in a very compactunit of time I must cram into you everything there is to know about sorcery asan abstract proposition, but in order to do that I have to build the necessaryspace in you.\"\"What space? What are you talking about, don Juan?\"\"The premise of sorcerers is that in order to bring something in, there must bea space to put it in,\" he said. \"If you are filled to the brim with the items ofeveryday life, there's no space for anything new. That space must be built. Doyou see what I mean? The sorcerers of olden times believed that therecapitulation of your life made that space. It does, and much more, of course.\"The way sorcerers perform the recapitulation is very formal,\" he went on. \"Itconsists of writing a list of all the people they have met, from the present tothe very beginning of their lives. Once they have that list, they take the firstperson on it and recollect everything they can about that person. And I meaneverything, every detail. It's better to recapitulate from the present to thepast, because the memories of the present are fresh, and in this manner, therecollection ability is honed. What practitioners do is to recollect andbreathe. They inhale slowly and deliberately, fanning the head from right toleft, in a barely noticeable swing, and exhale in the same fashion.\"He said that the inhalations and exhalations should be natural. If they were toorapid, one would enter into something that he called tiring breaths; breathsthat required slower breathing afterward in order to calm down the muscles.\"And what do you want me to do, don Juan, with all this?\" I asked.\"You begin making your list today,\" he said. \"Divide it by years, byoccupations, arrange it in any order you want to, but make it sequential, withthe most recent person first, and end with Mommy and Daddy. And then, remembereverything about them. No more ado than that. As you practice, you will realizewhat you're doing.\"On my next visit to his house, I told don Juan that I had been meticulouslygoing through the events of my life, and that it was very difficult for me toadhere to his strict format and follow my list of persons one by one.Ordinarily, my recapitulation took me every which way. I let the events decidethe direction of my recollection.What I did, which was volitional, was to adhere to a general unit of time. Forinstance, I had begun with the people in the anthropology department, but I letmy recollection pull me to anywhere in time, from the present to the day Istarted attending school at UCLA.I told don Juan that an odd thing I'd found out, which I had completelyforgotten, was that I had no idea that UCLA existed until one night when mygirlfriend's roommate from college came to Los Angeles and we picked her up atthe airport. She was going to study musicology at UCLA.Her plane arrived in the early evening, and she asked me if I could take her tothe campus so she could take a look at the place where she was going to spendthe next four years of her life. I knew where the campus was, for I had drivenpast its entrance on Sunset Boulevard endless times on my way to the beach. Ihad never been on the campus, though.It was during the semester break. The few people that we found directed us tothe music department. The campus was deserted, but what I witnessed subjectivelywas the most exquisite thing I have ever seen. It was a delight to my eyes. Thebuildings seemed to be alive with some energy of their own.What was going to be a very cursory visit to the music department turned out tobe a gigantic tour of the entire campus. I fell in love with UCLA. I mentionedto don Juan that the only thing that marred my ecstasy was my girlfriend'sannoyance at my insistence on walking through the huge campus.\"What the hell could there be in here?\" she yelled at me in protest. \"It's as ifyou have never seen a university campus in your life! You've seen one, you'veseen them all. I think you're just trying to impress my friend with yoursensitivity!\"I wasn't, and I vehemently told them that I was genuinely impressed by thebeauty of my surroundings. I sensed so much hope in those buildings, so muchpromise, and yet I couldn't express my subjective state.\"I have been in school nearly all my life,\" my girlfriend said through clenchedteeth, \"and I'm sick and tired of it! Nobody's going to find shit in here! Allyou find is guff, and they don't even prepare you to meet your responsibilitiesin life.\"When I mentioned that I would like to attend school here, she became even morefurious.\"Get a job!\" she screamed. \"Go and meet life from eight to five, and cut thecrap! That's what life is: a job from eight to five, forty hours a week! Seewhat it does to you! Look at me- I'm super educated now, and I'm not fit for ajob.\"All I knew was that I had never seen a place so beautiful. I made a promise thenthat I would go to school at UCLA, no matter what, come hell or high water. Mydesire had everything to do with me, and yet it was not driven by the need forimmediate gratification. It was more in the realm of awe.I told don Juan that my girlfriend's annoyance had been so jarring to me that itforced me to look at her in a different light, and that to my recollection, thatwas the first time ever that a commentary had aroused such a deep reaction inme. I saw facets of character in my girlfriend that I hadn't seen before, facetsthat scared me stiff.\"I think I judged her terribly,\" I said to don Juan. \"After our visit to thecampus, we drifted apart. It was as if UCLA had come between us like a wedge. Iknow that it's stupid to think this way.\"\"It isn't stupid,\" don Juan said. \"It was a perfectly valid reaction. While youwere walking on the campus, I am sure that you had a bout with intent. Youintended being there, and anything that was opposed to it you had to let go.\"But don't overdo it,\" he went on. \"The touch of warrior travelers is verylight, although it is cultivated. The hand of a warrior traveler begins as aheavy, gripping, iron hand but becomes like the hand of a ghost, a hand made ofgossamer. [* gossamer- filaments from a web that was spun by a spider: net oftransparent fabric with a loose open weave and an extremely fine texture]Warrior travelers leave no marks, no tracks. That's the challenge for warriortravelers.'\"Don Juan's comments made me sink into a deep, morose state of recriminationsagainst myself, for I knew, from the little bit of my recounting, that I wasextremely heavy-handed, obsessive, and domineering. I told don Juan about myruminations.\"The power of the recapitulation,\" don Juan said, \"is that it stirs up all thegarbage of our lives and brings it to the surface.\"Then don Juan delineated the intricacies of awareness and perception, which werethe basis of the recapitulation. He began by saying that he was going to presentan arrangement of concepts that I should not take as sorcerers' 'theories' underany conditions, because it was an arrangement formulated by the shamans ofancient Mexico as a result of seeing energy directly as it flows in theuniverse.He warned me that he would present the units of this arrangement to me withoutany attempt at classifying them or ranking them by any predetermined standard.\"I'm not interested in classifications,\" he went on. \"You have been classifyingeverything all your life. Now you are going to be forced to stay away fromclassifications.\"The other day, when I asked you if you knew anything about clouds, you gave methe names of all the clouds and the percentage of moisture that one shouldexpect from each one of them. You were a veritable weatherman. But when I askedyou if you knew what you could do with the clouds personally, you had no ideawhat I was talking about.\"Classifications have a world of their own,\" he continued. \"After you begin toclassify anything, the classification becomes alive, and it rules you. But sinceclassifications never started as energy giving affairs, they always remain likedead logs. They are not trees; they are merely logs.\"He explained that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico saw that the universe at largeis composed of energy fields in the form of luminous filaments. They sawzillions of them, wherever they turned to see. They also saw that those energyfields arrange themselves into currents of luminous fibers, streams that areconstant, perennial forces in the universe, and that the current or stream offilaments that is related to the recapitulation was named by those sorcerers'the dark sea of awareness', and also 'the Eagle'.He stated that those sorcerers also found out that every creature in theuniverse is attached to the dark sea of awareness at a round point of luminositythat was apparent when those creatures were perceived as energy. On that pointof luminosity, which the sorcerers of ancient Mexico called the assemblagepoint, don Juan said that perception was assembled by a mysterious aspect of thedark sea of awareness.Don Juan asserted that on the assemblage point of human beings, zillions ofenergy fields from the universe at large, in the form of luminous filaments,converge and go through it. These energy fields are converted into sensory data,and the sensory data is then interpreted and perceived as the world we know.Don Juan further explained that what turns the luminous fibers into sensory datais the dark sea of awareness. Sorcerers see this transformation and call it theglow of awareness; a sheen that extends like a halo around the assemblage point.He warned me then that he was going to make a statement which, in theunderstanding of sorcerers, was central to comprehending the scope of therecapitulation.Putting an enormous emphasis on his words, he said that what we call the sensesin organisms is nothing but degrees of awareness. He maintained that if weaccept that the senses are the dark sea of awareness, we have to admit that theinterpretation that the senses make of sensory data is also the dark sea ofawareness.He explained at length that to face the world around us in the terms that we dois the result of the interpretation system of mankind with which every humanbeing is equipped. He also said that every organism in existence has to have aninterpretation system that permits it to function in its surroundings.\"The sorcerers who came after the apocalyptic upheavals I told you about,\" hecontinued, \"saw that at the moment of death, the dark sea of awareness suckedin, so to speak, through the assemblage point, the awareness of livingcreatures. They also saw that the dark sea of awareness had a moment's, let'ssay, hesitation when it was faced with sorcerers who had done a recounting oftheir lives. Unbeknownst to them, some had done it so thoroughly that the darksea of awareness took their awareness in the form of their life experiences, butdidn't touch their life force.Sorcerers had found out a gigantic truth about the forces of the universe: Thedark sea of awareness wants only our life experiences, not our life force.\"The premises of don Juan's elucidation were incomprehensible to me. Or perhapsit would be more accurate to say that I was vaguely and yet deeply cognizant ofhow functional the premises of his explanation were.\"Sorcerers believe,\" don Juan went on, \"that as we recapitulate our lives, allthe debris, as I told you, comes to the surface. We realize our inconsistencies,our repetitions, but something in us puts up a tremendous resistance torecapitulating. Sorcerers say that the road is free only after a giganticupheaval, after the appearance on our screen of the memory of an event thatshakes our foundations with its terrifying clarity of detail. It's the eventthat drags us to the actual moment that we lived it. Sorcerers call that eventthe usher, because from then on every event we touch on is relived, not merelyremembered.\"Walking is always something that precipitates memories,\" don Juan went on. \"Thesorcerers of ancient Mexico believed that everything we live we store as asensation on the backs of the legs. They considered the backs of the legs to bethe warehouse of man's personal history. So, let's go for a walk in the hillsnow.\" We walked until it was almost dark.\"I think I have made you walk long enough,\" don Juan said when we were back athis house, \"to have you ready to begin this sorcerers' maneuver of finding anusher: an event in your life that you will remember with such clarity that itwill serve as a spotlight to illuminate everything else in your recapitulationwith the same, or comparable, clarity.\"Do what sorcerers call recapitulating pieces of a puzzle. Something will leadyou to remember the event that will serve as your usher.\"He left me alone, giving me one last warning. \"Give it your best shot,\" he said.\"Do your best.\"I was extremely silent for a moment, perhaps due to the silence around me. Iexperienced, then, a vibration, a sort of jolt in my chest. I had difficultybreathing, but suddenly something opened up in my chest that allowed me to takea deep breath, and a total view of a forgotten event of my childhood burst intomy memory, as if it had been held captive and was suddenly released. I was at my grandfather's studio, where he had a billiard table, and I wasplaying billiards with him. I was almost nine years old then. My grandfather wasquite a skillful player, and compulsively he had taught me every play he knewuntil I was good enough to have a serious match with him. We spent endless hoursplaying billiards. I became so proficient at it that one day I defeated him.From that day on, he was incapable of winning. Many a time I deliberately threwthe game, just to be nice to him, but he knew it and would become furious withme. Once, he got so upset that he hit me on the top of the head with the cue.To my grandfather's chagrin and delight, by the time I was nine years old, Icould make carom after carom without stopping. He became so frustrated andimpatient in a game with me once that he threw down his cue and told me to playby myself. My compulsive nature made it possible for me to compete with myselfand work the same play on and on until I got it perfectly.One day, a man notorious in town for his gambling connections, the owner of abilliards house, came to visit my grandfather. They were talking and playingbilliards as I happened to enter the room. I instantly tried to retreat, but mygrandfather grabbed me and pulled me in.\"This is my grandson,\" he said to the man.\"Very pleased to meet you,\" the man said. He looked at me sternly, and thenextended his hand, which was the size of the head of a normal person.I was horrified. His enormous burst of laughter told me that he was cognizant ofmy discomfort. He told me that his name was Falelo Quiroga, and I mumbled myname.He was very tall, and extremely well dressed. He was wearing a double-breastedblue pinstriped suit with beautifully tapered trousers. He must have been in hisearly fifties then, but he was trim and fit except for a slight bulge in hismidsection. He wasn't fat; he seemed to cultivate the look of a man who is wellfed and is not in need of anything. Most of the people in my hometown weregaunt. They were people who labored hard to earn a living and had no time forniceties. Falelo Quiroga appeared to be the opposite. His whole demeanor wasthat of a man who had time only for niceties.He was pleasant-looking. He had a bland, well-shaven face with kind blue eyes.He had the air and the confidence of a doctor. People in my town used to saythat he was capable of putting anyone at ease, and that he should have been apriest, a lawyer, or a doctor instead of a gambler. They also used to say thathe made more money gambling than all the doctors and lawyers in town puttogether made by working.His hair was black, and carefully combed. It was obviously thinningconsiderably. He tried to hide his receding hairline by combing his hair overhis forehead. He had a square jaw and an absolutely winning smile. He had big,white teeth, which were well cared for; the ultimate novelty in an area wheretooth decay was monumental. Two other remarkable features of Falelo Quiroga, forme, were his enormous feet and his handmade, black patent-leather shoes. I wasfascinated by the fact that his shoes didn't squeak at all as he walked back andforth in the room. I was accustomed to hearing my grandfather's approach by thesqueak of the soles of his shoes.\"My grandson plays billiards very well,\" my grandfather said nonchalantly toFalelo Quiroga. \"Why don't I give him my cue and let him play with you while Iwatch?\"\"\"This child plays billiards?\" the big man asked my grandfather with a laugh.\"Oh, he does,\" my grandfather assured him. \"Of course, not as well as you do,Falelo. Why don't you try him? And to make it interesting for you, so you won'tbe patronizing my grandson, let's bet a little money. What do you say if we betthis much?\"He put a thick wad of crumpled-up bills on the table and smiled at FaleloQuiroga, shaking his head from side to side as if daring the big man to take hisbet.\"My oh my, that much, eh?\" Falelo Quiroga said, looking at me questioningly. Heopened his wallet then and pulled out some neatly folded bills. This, for me,was another surprising detail. My grandfather's habit was to carry his money inevery one of his pockets, all crumpled up. When he needed to pay for something,he had to straighten out the bills in order to count them.Falelo Quiroga didn't say it, but I knew that he felt like a highway robber. Hesmiled at my grandfather and, obviously out of respect for him, he put his moneyon the table. My grandfather, acting as the arbiter, set the game at a certainnumber of caroms and flipped a coin to see who would start first. Falelo Quirogawon.\"You better give it all you have, without holding back,\" my grandfather urgedhim. \"Don't have any qualms about demolishing this twerp and winning my money!\"Falelo Quiroga, following my grandfather's advice, played as hard as he wasable, but at one point he missed one carom by a hair. I took the cue. I thoughtI was going to faint, but seeing my grandfather's glee- he was jumping up anddown- calmed me, and besides, it irked me to see Falelo Quiroga about to splithis sides laughing when he saw the way I held the cue. I couldn't lean over thetable, as billiards is normally played, because of my height. But mygrandfather, with painstaking patience and determination, had taught me analternative way of playing. By extending my arm all the way back, I held the cuenearly above my shoulders, to the side.\"What does he do when he has to reach the middle of the table?\" Falelo Quirogaasked, laughing.\"He hangs on the edge of the table,\" my grandfather said matter-of-factly. \"It'spermissible, you know.\"My grandfather came to me and whispered through clenched teeth that if I triedto be polite and lose he was going to break all the cues on my head. I knew hedidn't mean it. This was just his way of expressing his confidence in me.I won easily. My grandfather was delighted beyond description, but strangelyenough, so was Falelo Quiroga. He laughed as he went around the pool table,slapping its edges. My grandfather praised me to the skies. He revealed toQuiroga my best score, and joked that I had excelled because he had found theway to lure me to practice: coffee with Danish pastries.\"You don't say, you don't say!\" Quiroga kept repeating. He said good-bye; mygrandfather picked up the bet money, and the incident was forgotten. Mygrandfather promised to take me to a restaurant and buy me the best meal intown, but he never did. He was very stingy. He was known to be a lavish spenderonly with women.Two days later, two enormous men affiliated with Falelo Quiroga came to me atthe time that I got out from school and was leaving.\"Falelo Quiroga wants to see you,\" one of them said in a guttural tone. \"Hewants you to go to his place and have some coffee and Danish pastries with him.\"If he hadn't said coffee and Danish pastries, I probably would have run awayfrom them. I remembered then that my grandfather had told Falelo Quiroga that Iwould sell my soul for coffee and Danish pastries. I gladly went with them.However, I couldn't walk as fast as they did, so one of them, the one whose namewas Guillermo Falcon, picked me up and cradled me in his huge arms. He laughedthrough crooked teeth.\"You better enjoy the ride, kid,\" he said. His breath was terrible. \"Have youever been carried by anyone? Judging by the way you wriggle, never!\" He giggledgrotesquely.Fortunately, Falelo Quiroga's place was not too far from the school. Mr. Falcondeposited me on a couch in an office. Falelo Quiroga was there, sitting behind ahuge desk. He stood up and shook hands with me. He immediately had some coffeeand delicious pastries brought to me, and the two of us sat there chattingamiably about my grandfather's chicken farm. He asked me if I would like to havemore pastries, and I said that I wouldn't mind if I did. He laughed, and hehimself brought me a whole tray of unbelievably delicious pastries from the nextroom.After I had veritably gorged myself, he politely asked me if I would considercoming to his billiards place in the wee hours of the night to play a couple offriendly games with some people of his choice. He casually mentioned that aconsiderable amount of money was going to be involved.He openly expressed his trust in my skill, and added that he was going to payme, for my time and my effort, a percentage of the winning money. He furtherstated that he knew the mentality of my family. They would have found itimproper that he give me money, even though it was pay. So he promised to putthe money in the bank in a special account for me, or more practical yet, hewould cover any purchase that I made in any of the stores in town, or the food Iconsumed in any restaurant in town.I didn't believe a word of what he was saying. I knew that Falelo Quiroga was acrook, a racketeer. I liked, however, the idea of playing billiards with peopleI didn't know, and I struck a bargain with him.\"Will you give me some coffee and Danish pastries like the ones you gave metoday?\" I said.\"Of course, my boy,\" he replied. \"If you come to play for me, I will buy you thebakery! I will have the baker bake them just for you. Take my word.\"I warned Falelo Quiroga that the only drawback was my incapacity to get out ofmy house. I had too many aunts who watched me like hawks, and besides, mybedroom was on the second floor.\"That's no problem,\" Falelo Quiroga assured me. \"You're quite small. Mr. Falconwill catch you if you jump from your window into his arms. He's as big as ahouse! I recommend that you go to bed early tonight. Mr. Falcon will wake you upby whistling and throwing rocks at your window. You have to watch out, though!He's an impatient man.\"I went home in the midst of the most astounding excitation. I couldn't go tosleep. I was quite awake when I heard Mr. Falcon whistling and throwing smallpebbles against the glass panes of the window. I opened the window. Mr. Falconwas right below me, on the street.\"Jump into my arms, kid,\" he said to me in a constricted voice, which he triedto modulate into a loud whisper. \"If you don't aim at my arms, I'll drop you andyou'll die. Remember that. Don't make me run around. Just aim at my arms. Jump!Jump!\"I did, and he caught me with the ease of someone catching a bag of cotton. Heput me down and told me to run. He said that I was a child awakened from a deepsleep, and that he had to make me run so I would be fully awake by the time Igot to the billiards house.I played that night with two men, and I won both games. I had the most deliciouscoffee and pastries that one could imagine. Personally, I was in heaven. It wasaround seven in the morning when I returned home. Nobody had noticed my absence.It was time to go to school. For all practical purposes, everything was normalexcept for the fact that I was so tired that I couldn't keep my eyes open allday.From that day on, Falelo Quiroga sent Mr. Falcon to pick me up two or threetimes a week, and I won every game that he made me play. And faithful to hispromise, he paid for anything that I bought, including meals at my favoriteChinese restaurant, where I used to go daily. Sometimes, I even invited myfriends, whom I mortified no end by running out of the restaurant screaming whenthe waiter brought the bill. They were amazed at the fact that they were nevertaken to the police for consuming food and not paying for it.What was an ordeal for me was that I had never conceived of the fact that Iwould have to contend with the hopes and expectations of all the people who beton me. The ordeal of ordeals, however, took place when a crack player from anearby city challenged Falelo Quiroga and backed his challenge with a giant bet.The night of the game was an inauspicious [* inauspicious- contrary to yourinterests or welfare] night. My grandfather became ill and couldn't fall asleep.The entire family was in an uproar. It appeared that nobody went to bed. Idoubted that I had any possibility of sneaking out of my bedroom, but Mr.Falcon's whistling and the pebbles hitting the glass of my window were soinsistent that I took a chance and jumped from my window into Mr. Falcon's arms.It seemed that every male in town had congregated at the billiards place.Anguished faces silently begged me not to lose. Some of the men boldly assuredme that they had bet their houses and all their belongings.One man, in a half-joking tone, said that he had bet his wife; if I didn't win,he would be a cuckold [* cuckold- a man whose wife committed adultery] thatnight, or a murderer. He didn't specify whether he meant he would kill his wifein order not to be a cuckold, or me, for losing the game.Falelo Quiroga paced back and forth. He had hired a masseur to massage me. Hewanted me relaxed. The masseur put hot towels on my arms and wrists and coldtowels on my forehead. He put on my feet the most comfortable, soft shoes that Ihad ever worn. They had hard, military heels and arch supports. Falelo Quirogaeven outfitted me with a beret to keep my hair from falling in my face, as wellas a pair of loose overalls with a belt.Half of the people around the billiard table were strangers from another town.They glared at me. They gave me the feeling that they wanted me dead.Falelo Quiroga flipped a coin to decide who would go first. My opponent was aBrazilian of Chinese descent, young, round-faced, very spiffy and confident. Hestarted first, and he made a staggering amount of caroms. I knew by the color ofhis face that Falelo Quiroga was about to have a heart attack, and so were theother people who had bet everything they had on me.I played very well that night, and as I approached the number of caroms that theother man had made, the nervousness of the ones who had bet on me reached itspeak. Falelo Quiroga was the most hysterical of them all. He yelled at everybodyand demanded that someone open the windows because the cigarette smoke made theair unbreathable for me. He wanted the masseur to relax my arms and shoulders.Finally, I had to stop everyone, and in a real hurry, I made the eight caromsthat I needed to win. The euphoria of those who had bet on me was indescribable.I was oblivious to all that, for it was already morning and they had to take mehome in a hurry.My exhaustion that day knew no limits. Very obligingly, Falelo Quiroga didn'tsend for me for a whole week. However, one afternoon, Mr. Falcon picked me upfrom school and took me to the billiards house. Falelo Quiroga was extremelyserious. He didn't even offer me coffee or Danish pastries. He sent everybodyout of his office and got directly to the point. He pulled his chair close tome.\"I have put a lot of money in the bank for you,\" he said very solemnly. \"I amtrue to what I promised you. I give you my word that I will always look afteryou. You know that! Now, if you do what I am going to tell you to do, you willmake so much money that you won't have to work a day in your life. I want you tolose your next game by one carom. I know that you can do it. But I want you tomiss by only a hair. The more dramatic, the better.\"I was dumbfounded. All of this was incomprehensible to me. Falelo Quirogarepeated his request and further explained that he was going to bet anonymouslyall he had against me, and that that was the nature of our new deal.\"Mr. Falcon has been guarding you for months,\" he said. \"All I need to tell youis that Mr. Falcon uses all his force to protect you, but he could do theopposite with the same strength.\"Falelo Quiroga's threat couldn't have been more obvious. He must have seen in myface the horror that I felt, for he relaxed and laughed.\"Oh, but don't you worry about things like that,\" he said reassuringly, \"becausewe are brothers.\"This was the first time in my life that I had been placed in an untenableposition. I wanted with all my might to run away from Falelo Quiroga, from thefear that he had evoked in me. But at the same time, and with equal force, Iwanted to stay. I wanted the ease of being able to buy anything I wanted fromany store, and above all, the ease of being able to eat at any restaurant of mychoice, without paying. I was never confronted, however, with having to chooseone or the other.Unexpectedly, at least for me, my grandfather moved to another area, quitedistant. It was as if he knew what was going on, and he sent me ahead ofeveryone else. I doubted that he actually knew what was taking place. It seemedthat sending me away was one of his usual intuitive actions.Don Juan's return brought me out of my recollection. I had lost track of time. Ishould have been famished but I wasn't hungry at all. I was filled with nervousenergy. Don Juan lit a kerosene lantern and hung it from a nail on the wall. Itsdim light cast strange, dancing shadows in the room. It took a moment for myeyes to adjust to the semidarkness.I entered then into a state of profound sadness. It was a strangely detachedfeeling, a far-reaching longing that came from that semidarkness, or perhapsfrom the sensation of being trapped. I was so tired that I wanted to leave, butat the same time, and with the same force, I wanted to stay.Don Juan's voice brought me a measure of control. He appeared to know the reasonfor and the depth of my turmoil, and modulated his voice to fit the occasion.The severity of his tone helped me to gain control over something that couldeasily have turned into a hysterical reaction to fatigue and mental stimulation.\"To recount events is magical for sorcerers,\" he said. \"It isn't just tellingstories. It is seeing the underlying fabric of events. This is the reasonrecounting is so important and vast.\"At his request, I told don Juan the event I had recollected.\"How appropriate,\" he said, and chuckled with delight. \"The only commentary Ican make is that warrior travelers roll with the punches. They go wherever theimpulse may take them. The power of warrior travelers is to be alert, to getmaximum effect from minimal impulse. And above all, their power lies in notinterfering.Events have a force, a gravity of their own, and travelers are just travelers.Everything around them is for their eyes alone. In this fashion, travelersconstruct the meaning of every situation without ever asking how it happenedthis way or that way.\"Today, you remembered an event that sums up your total life,\" he continued.\"You are always faced with a situation that is the same as the one that younever resolved. You never really had to choose whether to accept or rejectFalelo Quiroga's crooked deal.\"Infinity always puts us in this terrible position of having to choose,\" he wenton. \"We want infinity, but at the same time, we want to run away from it. Youwant to tell me to go and jump in a lake, but at the same time you are compelledto stay. It would be infinitely easier for you to just be compelled to stay.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Interplay of Energy on the HorizonThe clarity the usher brought a new impetus to my recapitulation. A new moodreplaced the old one. From then on, I began to recollect events in my life withmaddening clarity. It was exactly as if a barrier had been built inside me thathad kept me holding rigidly on to meager and unclear memories, and the usher hadsmashed it.My memory faculty had been for me, prior to that event, a vague way of referringto things that had happened, but which I wanted most of the time to forget.Basically, I had no interest whatsoever in remembering anything of my life.Therefore, I honestly saw absolutely no point in this futile exercise ofrecapitulating, which don Juan had practically imposed on me. For me, it was achore that tired me instantly and did nothing but point out my incapacity forconcentrating.I had dutifully made, nevertheless, lists of people, and I had engaged in ahaphazard effort of quasi-remembering my interactions with them. My lack ofclarity in bringing those people into focus didn't dissuade me. I fulfilled whatI considered to be my duty, regardless of the way I really felt.With practice, the clarity of my recollection improved, I thought remarkably. Iwas able to descend, so to speak, on certain choice events with a fair amount ofkeenness that was at once scary and rewarding. After don Juan presented me withthe idea of the usher, however, the power of my recollection became somethingfor which I had no name.Following my list of people made the recapitulation extremely formal andexigent, the way don Juan wanted it. But from time to time, something in me gotloose; something that forced me to focus on events unrelated to my list; eventswhose clarity was so maddening that I was caught and submerged in them, perhapseven more intensely than I had been when I had lived the experiences themselves.Every time I recapitulated in such a fashion, I had a degree of detachment whichallowed me to see things I had disregarded when I had really been in the throesof them.The first time in which the recollection of an event shook me to my foundationshappened after I had given a lecture at a college in Oregon. The students incharge of organizing the lecture took me and another anthropology friend of mineto a house to spend the night.I was going to go to a motel, but they insisted, for our comfort, on taking usto this house. They said that it was in the country, and there were no noises,the quietest place in the world, with no telephones, no interference from theoutside world. I, like the fool that I was, agreed to go with them. Don Juan hadnot only warned me to always be a solitary bird, he had demanded that I observehis recommendation, something that I did most of the time, but there wereoccasions when the gregarious creature in me took the upper hand.The committee took us to the house, quite a distance from Portland, of aprofessor who was on sabbatical. Very swiftly, they turned on the lights insideand outside of the house, which was located on a hill with spotlights all aroundit. With the spotlights on, the house must have been visible from five milesaway. After that, the committee took off as fast as they could, some-thing thatsurprised me because I thought they were going to stay and talk. The house was awooden A-frame, small, but very well constructed. It had an enormous living roomand a mezzanine above it where the bedroom was. Right above, at the apex of theA-frame, there was a life-size crucifix hanging from a strange rotating hinge,which was drilled into the head of the figure. The spotlights on the wall werefocused on the crucifix. It was quite an impressive sight, especially when itrotated, squeaking as if the hinge needed oil.The bathroom of the house was another sight. It had mirrored tiles on theceiling, the walls, and the floor, and it was illuminated with a reddish light.There was no way to go to the bathroom without seeing yourself from everyconceivable angle. I enjoyed all those features of the house, which seemed to mestupendous.When the time came for me to go to sleep, however, I encountered a seriousproblem because there was only one narrow, hard, quite monastic bed and myanthropologist friend was close to having pneumonia, wheezing and retchingphlegm every time he coughed. He went straight for the bed and passed out. Ilooked for a place to sleep. I couldn't find one. That house was barren ofcomforts. Besides, it was cold. The committee had turned on the lights, but notthe heater. I looked for the heater. My search was fruitless, as was my searchfor the switch to the spotlights or to any of the lights in the house, for thatmatter. The switches were there on the walls, but they seemed to be overruled bythe effect of some main switch. The lights were on, and I had no way to turnthem off.The only place I could find to sleep was on a thin throw rug, and the only thingI found with which I could cover myself was the tanned hide of a giant Frenchpoodle. Obviously, it had been the pet of the house and had been preserved; ithad shiny black-marble eyes and an open mouth with the tongue hanging out. I putthe head of the poodle skin toward my knees. I still had to cover myself withthe tanned rear end, which was on my neck. Its preserved head was like a hardobject between my knees, quite unsettling! If it had been dark, it wouldn't havebeen as bad. I gathered a bundle of washcloths and used them as a pillow. I usedas many as possible to cover the hide of the French poodle the best way I could.I couldn't sleep all night.It was then, as I lay there cursing myself silently for being so stupid and notfollowing don Juan's recommendation, that I had the first maddeningly clearrecollection of my entire life. I had recollected the event that don Juan hadcalled the usher with equal clarity, but my tendency had always been to halfdisregard what happened to me when I was with don Juan, on the basis that in hispresence anything was possible. This time, however, I was alone.Years before I met don Juan, I had worked painting signs on buildings. My boss'sname was Luigi Palma. One day Luigi got a contract to paint a sign, advertisingthe sale and rental of bridal gowns and tuxedos, on the back wall of an oldbuilding. The owner of the store in the building wanted to catch the eye ofpossible customers with a large display. Luigi was going to paint a bride andgroom, and I was going to do the lettering. We went to the flat roof of thebuilding and set up a scaffold.I was quite apprehensive although I had no overt reason to be so. I had painteddozens of signs on high buildings. Luigi thought that I was beginning to beafraid of heights, but that my fear was going to pass. When the time came tostart working, he lowered the scaffold a few feet from the roof and jumped ontoits flat boards. He went to one side, while I stood on the other in order to betotally out of his way. He was the artist.Luigi began to show off. His painting movements were so erratic and agitatedthat the scaffold moved back and forth. I became dizzy. I wanted to go back tothe flat roof, using the pretext that I needed more paint and other painters'paraphernalia. I grabbed the edge of the wall that fringed the flat roof andtried to hoist myself up, but the tips of my feet got stuck in the boards of thescaffold.I tried to pull my feet and the scaffold toward the wall; the harder I pulled,the farther away I pushed the scaffold from the wall. Instead of helping meuntangle my feet, Luigi sat down and braced himself with the cords that attachedthe scaffold to the flat roof. He crossed himself and looked at me in horror.From his sitting position, he knelt, weeping quietly as he recited the Lord'sPrayer.I held on to the edge of the wall for dear life. What gave me the desperatestrength to endure was the certainty that if I was in control, I could keep thescaffold from moving farther and farther away. I wasn't going to lose my gripand fall thirteen floors to my death.Luigi, being a compulsive taskmaster to the bitter end, yelled to me, in themidst of tears, that I should pray. He swore that both of us were going to fallto our deaths, and that the least we could do was to pray for the salvation ofour souls. For a moment, I deliberated about whether it was functional to pray.I opted to yell for help. People in the building must have heard my yelling andsent for the firemen. I sincerely thought that it had taken only two or threeseconds after I began to yell for the firemen to come onto the roof and grabLuigi and me and secure the scaffold.In reality, I had hung on to the side of the building for at least twentyminutes. When the firemen finally pulled me onto the roof, I had lost anyvestige of control. I vomited on the hard floor of the roof, sick to my stomachfrom fear and the odious smell of melted tar. It was a very hot day; the tar onthe cracks of the scratchy roofing sheets was melting in the heat.The ordeal had been so frightening and embarrassing that I didn't want toremember it, and I ended up hallucinating that the firemen had pulled me into awarm, yellow room. They had then put me in a supremely comfortable bed, and Ihad fallen peacefully asleep, safe, wearing my pajamas, delivered from danger. My second recollection was another blast of incommensurable force. I was talkingamiably to a group of friends when, for no apparent reason I could account for,I suddenly lost my breath under the impact of a thought; a memory which wasvague for an instant, and then became an engrossing experience. Its force was sointense that I had to excuse myself and retreat for a moment to a corner.My friends seemed to understand my reaction. They disbanded without anycomments.What I was remembering was an incident that had taken place in my last year ofhigh school.My best friend and I used to walk to school, passing a big mansion with a blackwrought iron fence at least seven feet high and ending in pointed spikes. Behindthe fence was an extensive, well-kept green lawn, and a huge, ferocious Germanshepherd dog.Every day, we used to tease the dog and let him charge at us. He stoppedphysically at the wrought iron fence, but his rage seemed to cross over to us.My friend delighted in engaging the dog every day in a contest of mind overmatter. He used to stand a few inches from the dog's snout which protrudedbetween the iron bars at least six inches into the street, and my friend wouldbare his teeth, just like the dog did.\"Yield, yield!\" my friend shouted every time. \"Obey! Obey! I am more powerfulthan you!\"His daily displays of mental power, which lasted at least five minutes, neveraffected the dog, outside of leaving him more furious than ever. My friendassured me daily, as part of his ritual, that the dog was either going to obeyhim or die in front of us of heart failure brought about by rage. His convictionwas so intense that I believed that the dog was going to drop dead any day.One morning, when we came around, the dog wasn't there. We waited for a moment,but he didn't show up. Then we saw him, at the end of the extensive lawn. Heseemed to be busy there, so we slowly began to walk away. From the corner of myeye, I noticed that the dog was running at full speed, toward us. When he wasperhaps six or seven feet from the fence, he took a gigantic leap over it. I wassure that he was going to rip his belly on the spikes. He barely cleared themand fell onto the street like a sack of potatoes.I thought for a moment that he was dead, but he was only stunned. Suddenly, hegot up, and instead of chasing after the one who had brought about his rage, heran after me. I jumped onto the roof of a car, but the car was nothing for thedog. He took a leap and was nearly on top of me. I scrambled down and climbedthe first tree that was within reach, a flimsy little tree that could barelysupport my weight. I was sure that it would snap in the middle, sending me rightinto the dog's jaws to be mauled to death.In the tree, I was nearly out of his reach. But the dog jumped again, andsnapped his teeth, catching me by the seat of my pants and ripping them. Histeeth actually nicked my buttocks. The moment I was safe at the top of the tree,the dog left. He just ran up the street, perhaps looking for my friend.At the infirmary in school, the nurse told me that I had to ask the owner of thedog for a certificate of rabies vaccination.\"You must look into this,\" she said severely. \"You may have rabies already. Ifthe owner refuses to show you the vaccination certificate, you are within yourrights to call the police.\"I talked to the caretaker of the mansion where the dog lived. He accused me ofluring the owner's most valuable dog, a pedigreed animal, out into the street.\"You better watch out, boy!\" he said in an angry tone. \"The dog got lost. Theowner will send you to jail if you keep on bothering us.\"\"But I may have rabies,\" I said in a sincerely terrified tone.\"I don't give a shit if you have the bubonic plague,\" the man snapped. \"Scram!\"\"I'll call the police,\" I said.\"Call whoever you like,\" he retorted. \"You call the police, and we'll turn themagainst you. In this house, we have enough clout to do that!\"I believed him, so I lied to the nurse and said that the dog could not be found,and that it had no owner.\"Oh my god!\" the woman exclaimed. \"Then brace yourself for the worst. I may haveto send you to the doctor.\" She gave me a long list of symptoms that I shouldlook for or wait for until they manifested themselves. She said that theinjections for rabies were extremely painful, and that they had to beadministered subcutaneously on the area of the abdomen.\"I wouldn't wish that treatment on my worst enemy,\" she said, plunging me into ahorrid nightmare.What followed was my first real depression. I just lay in my bed feeling everyone of the symptoms enumerated by the nurse. I ended up going to the schoolinfirmary, and begging the woman to give me the treatment for rabies, no matterhow painful. I made a huge scene. I became hysterical. I didn't have rabies, butI had totally lost my control. I related to don Juan my two recollections in all their detail, sparing nothing.He didn't make any comments. He nodded a few times.\"In both recollections, don Juan,\" I said, feeling myself the urgency of myvoice, \"I was as hysterical as anyone could be. My body was trembling. I wassick to my stomach.\"I don't want to say it was as if I were in the experiences, because that's notthe truth. I was in the experiences themselves both times. And when I couldn'ttake them anymore, I jumped into my life now. For me, that was a jump into thefuture. I had the power of going over time. My jump into the past was notabrupt. The event developed slowly, as memories do. It was at the end that I didjump abruptly into the future: my life now.\"\"Something in you has begun to collapse for sure,\" he finally said. \"It has beencollapsing all along, but it repaired itself very quickly every time itssupports failed. My feeling is that it is now collapsing totally.\"After another long silence, don Juan explained that the sorcerers of ancientMexico believed that, as he had told me already, we had two minds, and only oneof them was truly ours. I had always understood don Juan as saying that therewere two parts to our minds, and one of them was always silent becauseexpression was denied to it by the force of the other part. Whatever don Juanhad said, I had taken as a metaphorical way to explain, perhaps, the apparentdominance of the left hemisphere of the brain over the right, or something ofthe like.\"There is a secret option to the recapitulation,\" don Juan said.\"Just like I told you that there is a secret option to dying, an option thatonly sorcerers take. In the case of dying, the secret option is that humanbeings could retain their life force and relinquish only their awareness, theproduct of their lives.\"In the case of the recapitulation, the secret option that only sorcerers takeis to choose to enhance their true minds.\"The haunting memory of your recollections,\" he went on, \"could come only fromyour true mind, whereas, the other mind that we all have and share is, I wouldsay, a cheap model; economy strength; one size fits all.\"But this is a subject that we will discuss later. What is at stake now is theadvent of a disintegrating force. But not a force that is disintegrating you- Idon't mean it that way.\"It is disintegrating what the sorcerers call the foreign installation, whichexists in you and in every other human being. The natural result of the forcethat is descending on you and is disintegrating your foreign installation isthat it pulls a sorcerer out of their syntax.\"I had listened carefully to don Juan, but I couldn't say that I had understoodwhat he had said. For some strange reason, which was to me as unknown as thecause of my vivid recollections, I couldn't ask him any questions.\"I know how difficult it is for you,\" don Juan said all of a sudden, \"to dealwith this facet of your life. Every sorcerer that I know has gone through it.The males going through it suffer infinitely more damage than the females. Isuppose it's the condition of women to be more durable.\"The sorcerers of ancient Mexico, acting as a group, tried their best tobuttress the impact of this disintegrating force. In our day, we have no meansof acting as a group, so we must brace ourselves to face in solitude a forcethat will sweep us away from language because there is no way to describeadequately what is going on.\"Don Juan was right in that I was at a loss for explanations or ways ofdescribing the effect that those recollections had had on me. Don Juan had toldme that sorcerers face the unknown in the most common incidents one can imagine.When they are confronted with the unknown, and cannot interpret what they areperceiving, they have to rely on an outside source for direction. Don Juan hadcalled that source infinity, or the voice of the spirit, and had said that ifsorcerers don't try to be rational about what can't be rationalized, the spiritunerringly [* unerringly- without making errors] tells them what's what.Don Juan had guided me to accept the idea that infinity was a force that had avoice, which in a sense is true, but not altogether accurate; and he had guidedme to accept that infinity was conscious of itself, which for all practialpurposes is accurate.Consequently, he had prepared me to be ready to listen to that voice and actefficiently always, but without antecedents, [* antecedents- precedingoccurrences] using as little as possible the railings of the a priori. [* apriori- hypothesis or theory rather than experiment and direct experience] I waited impatiently for the voice of the spirit to tell me the meaning of myrecollections, but nothing happened.Then one day, I was in a bookstore when a girl recognized me and came over totalk to me. She was tall and slim, and had an insecure, little girl's voice. Iwas trying to make her feel at ease when I was suddenly accosted by aninstantaneous energetic change.It was as if an alarm had been triggered in me, and as it had happened in thepast, without any volition on my part whatsoever, I recollected anothercompletely forgotten event in my life.The memory of my grandparents' house flooded me. It was a veritable avalanche sointense that it was devastating, and once more, I had to retreat to a corner. Mybody shook, as if I had taken a chill.I must have been eight years old. My grandfather was talking to me. He had begunby telling me that it was his utmost duty to set me straight. I had two cousinswho were my age: Alfredo and Luis. My grandfather demanded mercilessly that Iadmit that my cousin Alfredo was really beautiful. In my vision, I heard mygrandfather's raspy, constricted voice.\"Alfredo doesn't need any introductions,\" he had said to me on that occasion.\"He needs only to be present and the doors will fly open for him becauseeverybody practices the cult of beauty. Everybody likes beautiful people. Theyenvy them, but they certainly seek their company. Take it from me. I amhandsome, wouldn't you say?\"I sincerely agreed with my grandfather. He was certainly a very handsome man,small-boned, with laughing blue eyes and an exquisitely chiseled face withbeautiful cheekbones. Everything seemed to be perfectly balanced in his face-hisnose, his mouth, his eyes, his pointed jaw. He had blond hair growing on hisears, a feature that gave him an elflike appearance. He knew everything abouthimself, and he exploited his attributes to the maximum. Women adored him;first, according to him, for his beauty, and second, because he posed no threatto them. He, of course, took full advantage of all this.\"Your cousin Alfredo is a winner,\" my grandfather went on. \"He will never haveto crash a party because he'll be the first one on the list of guests. Have youever noticed how people stop in the street to look at him, and how they want totouch him?\"He's so beautiful that I'm afraid he's going to turn out to be an asshole, butthat's a different story. Let us say that he'll be the most welcome asshole youhave ever met.\"My grandfather compared my cousin Luis with Alfredo. He said that Luis washomely, and a little bit stupid, but that he had a heart of gold. And then hebrought me into the picture.\"If we are going to proceed with our explanation,\" he continued, \"you have toadmit in sincerity that Alfredo is beautiful and Luis is good. Now, let's takeyou. You are neither handsome nor good. You are a veritable son of a bitch.Nobody's going to invite you to a party. You'll have to get used to the ideathat if you want to be at a party, you will have to crash it. Doors will neverbe open for you the way they will be open for Alfredo for being beautiful, andfor Luis for being good, so you will have to get in through the window.\"His analysis of his three grandsons was so accurate that he made me weep withthe finality of what he had said. The more I wept, the happier he became. Hefinished his case with a most deleterious admonition.\"There's no need to feel bad,\" he said, \"because there's nothing more excitingthan getting in through the window. To do that, you have to be clever and onyour toes. You have to watch everything, and be prepared for endlesshumiliations.\"If you have to go in through the window,\" he went on, \"it's because you'redefinitely not on the list of guests; therefore, your presence is not welcome atall, so you have to work your butt off to stay. The only way I know is bypossessing everybody. Scream! Demand! Advise! Make them feel that you are incharge! How could they throw you out if you're in charge?\"Remembering this scene caused a profound upheaval in me. I had buried thisincident so deeply that I had forgotten all about it. What I had remembered allalong, however, was his admonition to be in charge, which he must have repeatedto me over and over throughout the years.I didn't have a chance to examine this event, or ponder it, because anotherforgotten memory surfaced with the same force. In it, I was with the girl I hadbeen engaged to. At that time, both of us were saving money to be married andhave a house of our own. I heard myself demanding that we have a joint checkingaccount; I wouldn't have it any other way. I felt an imperative need to lectureher on frugality. I heard myself telling her where to buy her clothes, and whatthe top affordable price should be.Then I saw myself giving driving lessons to her younger sister and goingveritably berserk when she said that she was planning to move out of herparents' house. Forcefully, I threatened her with canceling my lessons. Shewept, confessing that she was having an affair with her boss. I jumped out ofthe car and began kicking the door.However, that was not all. I heard myself telling my fiancee's father not tomove to Oregon, where he planned to go. I shouted at the top of my voice that itwas a stupid move. I really believed that my reasonings against it wereunbeatable.I presented him with budget figures in which I had meticulously calculated hislosses. When he didn't pay any attention to me, I slammed the door and left,shaking with rage. I found my fiancee in the living room, playing her guitar. Ipulled it out of her hands and yelled at her that she embraced the guitarinstead of playing it, as if it were more than an object.My desire to impose my will extended all across the board. I made nodistinctions. Whoever was close to me was there for me to possess and mold,following my whims.I didn't have to ponder anymore the significance of my vivid visions because anunquestionable certainty invaded me as if coming from outside me.It told me that my weak point was the idea that I had to be the man in thedirector's chair at all times. It had been a deeply ingrained concept with methat I not only had to be in charge, but I had to be in control of anysituation.The way in which I had been brought up had reinforced this drive, which musthave been arbitrary at its onset, but had turned, in my adulthood, into a deepnecessity.I was aware, beyond any doubt, that what was at stake was infinity. Don Juan hadportrayed it as a conscious force that deliberately intervenes in the lives ofsorcerers. And now it was intervening in mine. I knew that infinity was pointingout to me, through the vivid recollection of those forgotten experiences, theintensity and the depth of my drive for control, and thus preparing me forsomething transcendental to myself.I knew with frightening certainty that something was going to bar anypossibility of my being in control, and that I needed, more than anything else,sobriety, fluidity, and abandon in order to face the things that I felt werecoming to me.Naturally, I told all this to don Juan, elaborating to my heart's content on myspeculations and inspirational insights about the possible significance of myrecollections.Don Juan laughed good-humoredly. \"All this is psychological exaggeration on yourpart, wishful thinking,\" he said. \"You are, as usual, seeking explanations withlinear cause and effect.\"Each of your recollections becomes more and more vivid, more and more maddeningto you, because as I told you already, you have entered an irreversible process.Your true mind is emerging, waking up from a state of lifelong lethargy.\"Infinity is claiming you,\" he continued. \"Whatever means it uses to point thatout to you cannot have any other reason, any other cause, any other value thanthat. What you should do, however, is to be prepared for the onslaughts ofinfinity. You must be in a state of continuously bracing yourself for a blow oftremendous magnitude. That is the sane, sober way in which sorcerers faceinfinity.\"Don Juan's words left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I actually sensed theassault coming on me, and feared it. Since I had spent my entire life hidingbehind some superfluous activity, I immersed myself in work. I gave lectures inclasses taught by my friends in different schools in southern California. Iwrote copiously. I could say without exaggeration that I threw dozens ofmanuscripts into the garbage can because they didn't fulfill an indispensablerequirement that don Juan had described to me as the mark of something that isacceptable by infinity.He had said that everything I did had to be an act of sorcery; an act free fromencroaching expectations, fears of failure, hopes of success; free from the'cult of me'. Eeverything I did had to be impromptu; a work of magic where Ifreely opened myself to the impulses of the infinite.One night, I was sitting at my desk preparing myself for my daily activity ofwriting. I felt a moment of grogginess. I thought that I was feeling dizzybecause I had gotten up too quickly from my mat where I had been doing myexercises.My vision blurred. I saw yellow spots in front of my eyes. I thought I was goingto faint. The fainting spell got worse. There was an enormous red spot in frontof me. I began to breathe deeply, trying to quiet whatever agitation was causingthis visual distortion.I became extraordinarily silent, to the point where I noticed that I wassurrounded by impenetrable darkness. The thought crossed my mind that I hadfainted. However, I could feel the chair, my desk. I could feel everythingaround me from inside the darkness that surrounded me.Don Juan had said that the sorcerers of his lineage considered that one of themost coveted results of inner silence was a specific interplay of energy, whichis always heralded by a strong emotion. He felt that my recollections were themeans to agitate me to the extreme, where I would experience this interplay.Such an interplay manifested itself in terms of hues that were projected on anyhorizon in the world of everyday life, be it a mountain, the sky, a wall, orsimply the palms of the hands. He had explained that this interplay of huesbegins with the appearance of a tenuous brushstroke of lavender on the horizon.In time, this lavender brushstroke starts to expand until it covers the visiblehorizon, like advancing storm clouds.He assured me that a dot of a peculiar, rich, pomegranate red shows up, as ifbursting from the lavender clouds. He stated that as sorcerers become moredisciplined and experienced, the dot of pomegranate expands and finally explodesinto thoughts or visions, or in the case of a literate man, into written words;sorcerers either see visions engendered by energy, hear thoughts being voiced aswords, or read written words.That night at my desk, I didn't see any lavender brushstrokes, nor did I see anyadvancing clouds. I was sure that I didn't have the discipline that sorcerersrequire for such an interplay of energy, but I had an enormous dot ofpomegranate red in front of me. This enormous dot, without any preliminaries,exploded into disassociated words that I read as if they were on a sheet ofpaper coming out of a typewriter. The words moved at such tremendous speed infront of me that it was impossible to read anything. Then I heard a voicedescribing something to me. Again, the speed of the voice was wrong for my ears.The words were garbled, making it impossible to hear anything that would makesense.As if that weren't enough, I began to see liverish scenes like one sees indreams after a heavy meal. They were baroque, dark, ominous. I began to twirl,and I did so until I got sick to my stomach. The whole event ended there. I feltthe effect of whatever had happened to me in every muscle of my body. I wasexhausted. This violent intervention had made me angry and frustrated.I rushed to don Juan's house to tell him about this happening. I sensed that Ineeded his help more than ever.\"There's nothing gentle about sorcerers or sorcery,\" don Juan commented after heheard my story. \"This was the first time that infinity descended on you in sucha fashion. It was like a blitz. It was a total takeover of your faculties.Insofar as the speed of your visions is concerned, you yourself will have tolearn to adjust it. For some sorcerers, that's the job of a lifetime. But fromnow on, energy will appear to you as if it were being projected onto a moviescreen.\"Whether or not you understand the projection,\" he went on, \"is another matter.In order to make an accurate interpretation, you need experience. Myrecommendation is that you shouldn't be bashful, and you should begin now. Readenergy on the wall! Your true mind is emerging, and it has nothing to do withthe mind that is a foreign installation. Let your true mind adjust the speed. Besilent, and don't fret, no matter what happens.\"\"But, don Juan, is all this possible? Can one actually read energy as if it werea text?\" I asked, overwhelmed by the idea.\"Of course it's possible!\" he retorted. \"In your case, it's not only possible,it's happening to you.\"\"But why reading it, as if it were a text?\" I insisted, but it was a rhetoricalinsistence.\"It's an affectation on your part,\" he said. \"If you read the text, you couldrepeat it verbatim. However, if you tried to be a viewer of infinity instead ofa reader of infinity, you would find that you could not describe whatever youwere viewing, and you would end up babbling inanities, incapable of verbalizingwhat you witness. The same thing if you tried to hear it. This is, of course,specific to you. Anyway, infinity chooses. The warrior-traveler simplyacquiesces to the choice.\"But above all,\" he added after a calculated pause, \"don't be overwhelmed by theevent because you cannot describe it. It is an event beyond the syntax of ourlanguage.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"Journeys Through the Dark Sea of Awareness\"We can speak a little more clearly now about inner silence \" don Juan said.His statement was such a non sequitur [* non sequitur- a reply that has norelevance to what preceded it] that it startled me. He had been talking to meall afternoon about the vicissitudes [* vicissitudes- a variation incircumstances or fortune at different times ] that the Yaqui Indians hadsuffered after the big Yaqui wars of the twenties, when they were deported bythe Mexican government from their native homeland in the state of Sonora, innorthern Mexico, to work in sugarcane plantations in central and southernMexico. The Mexican government had had problems with endemic [* endemic-anything resembling a disease and constantly present to greater or lesser extentin a particular locality] wars with the Yaqui Indians for years. Don Juan toldme some astounding, poignant Yaqui stories of political intrigue and betrayal,deprivation and human misery.I had the feeling that don Juan was setting me up for something because he knewthat those stories were my 'cup of tea', so to speak. I had at that time anexaggerated sense of social justice and fair play.\"Circumstances around you have made it possible for you to have more energy,\" hewent on. \"You have started the recapitulation of your life; you have looked atyour friends for the first time as if they were in a display window; you arrivedat your breaking point, all by yourself, driven by your own needs; you canceledyour business; and above all, you have accrued enough inner silence. All ofthese made it possible for you to make a journey through the dark sea ofawareness.\"Meeting me in that town of our choice was that journey,\" he continued. \"I knowthat a crucial question almost reached the surface in you, and that for aninstant, you wondered if I really came to your house. My coming to see youwasn't a dream for you. I was real, wasn't I?\"\"You were as real as anything could be,\" I said.I had nearly forgotten about those events, but I remembered that it did seemstrange to me that he had found my apartment. I had discarded my astonishment bythe simple process of assuming that he had asked someone for my new address,although, if I had been pressed, I wouldn't have been able to come up with theidentity of anyone who would have known where I lived.\"Let us clarify this point,\" he continued. \"In my terms, which are the terms ofthe sorcerers of ancient Mexico, I was as real as I could have been, and assuch, I actually went to your place from my inner silence to tell you about therequisite of infinity, and to warn you that you were about to run out of time.And you, in turn, from your inner silence, veritably went to that town of ourchoice to tell me that you had succeeded in fulfilling the requisite ofinfinity.\"In your terms, which are the terms of the average man, it was a dream-fantasyin both instances. You had a dream-fantasy that I came to your place withoutknowing the address, and then you had a dream-fantasy that you went to see me.As far as I'm concerned, as a sorcerer, what you consider your dream-fantasy ofmeeting me in that town was as real as the two of us talking here today.\"I confessed to don Juan that there was no possibility of my framing those eventsin a pattern of thought proper to Western man. I said that to think of them interms of dream-fantasy was to create a false category that couldn't stand upunder scrutiny, and that the only quasi-explanation that was vaguely possiblewas another aspect of his knowledge: dreaming.\"No, it is not dreaming,\" he said emphatically. \"This is something more direct,and more mysterious. By the way, I have a new definition of dreaming for youtoday, more in accordance with your state of being.\"Dreaming is the act of changing the point of attachment with the dark sea ofawareness. If you view it in this fashion, it's a very simple concept, and avery simple maneuver. It takes all you have to realize it, but it's not animpossibility, nor is it something surrounded with mystical clouds.\"Dreaming is a term that has always bugged the hell out of me,\" he continued,\"because it weakens a very powerful act. It makes the act sound arbitrary. Itgives it a sense of being a fantasy, and this is the only thing it is not. Itried to change the term myself, but it's too ingrained.\"Maybe someday you could change it yourself, although, as with everything elsein sorcery, I am afraid that by the time you could actually do it, you won'tgive a damn about it because it won't make any difference what it is calledanymore.\"Don Juan had explained at great length, during the entire time that I had knownhim, that dreaming was an art, discovered by the sorcerers of ancient Mexico, bymeans of which ordinary dreams were transformed into bona-fide entrances toother worlds of perception. He advocated, in any way he could, the advent ofsomething he called dreaming attention, which was the capacity to pay a specialkind of attention, or to place a special kind of awareness on the elements of anordinary dream.I had followed meticulously all his recommendations and had succeeded incommanding my awareness to remain fixed on the elements of a dream. The ideathat don Juan proposed was not to set out deliberately to have a desired dream,but to fix one's attention on the component elements of whatever dream presenteditself.Then don Juan had showed me energetically what the sorcerers of ancient Mexicoconsidered to be the origin of dreaming: the displacement of the assemblagepoint. He said that the assemblage point was displaced very naturally duringsleep, but that to see the displacement was a bit difficult because it requiredan aggressive mood, and that such an aggressive mood had been the predilectionof the sorcerers of ancient Mexico. Those sorcerers, according to don Juan, hadfound all the premises of their sorcery by means of this mood.\"It is a very predatory mood,\" don Juan went on. \"It's not difficult at all toenter into it, because man is a predator by nature. You could see, aggressively,anybody in this little village, or perhaps someone far away, while they areasleep; anyone would do for the purpose at hand. What's important is that youarrive at a complete sense of indifference. You are in search of something, andyou are out to get it. You're going to go out looking for a person, searchinglike a feline, like an animal of prey, for someone to descend on.\"Don Juan had told me, laughing at my apparent chagrin, that the difficulty withthis technique was the mood, and that I couldn't be passive in the act ofseeing, for the sight was not something to watch but to act upon.It might have been the power of his suggestion, but that day, when he had toldme all this, I felt astoundingly aggressive. Every muscle of my body was filledto the brim with energy, and in my dreaming practice I did go after someone. Iwas not interested in who that someone might have been. I needed someone who wasasleep, and some force I was aware of, without being fully conscious of it, hadguided me to find that someone.I never knew who the person was, but while I was seeing that person, I felt donJuan's presence. It was a strange sensation of knowing that someone was with meby an undetermined sensation of proximity that was happening at a level ofawareness that wasn't part of anything that I had ever experienced. I could onlyfocus my attention on the individual at rest. I knew that he was a male, but Idon't know how I knew that. I knew that he was asleep because the ball of energythat human beings ordinarily are was a little bit flat. It was expandedlaterally.And then I saw the assemblage point at a position different from the habitualone, which is right behind the shoulder blades. In this instance, it had beendisplaced to the right of where it should have been, and a bit lower. Icalculated that in this case it had moved to the side of the ribs. Another thingthat I noticed was that there was no stability to it. It fluctuated erraticallyand then abruptly went back to its normal position. I had the clear sensationthat, obviously, my presence, and don Juan's, had awakened the individual. I hadexperienced a profusion of blurred images right after that, and then I woke upback in the place where I had started.Don Juan had also told me all along that sorcerers were divided into two groups:one group was dreamers; the other was stalkers. The dreamers were those who hada great facility for displacing the assemblage point. The stalkers were thosewho had a great facility for maintaining the assemblage point fixed on that newposition. Dreamers and stalkers complemented each other, and worked in pairs,affecting one another with their given proclivities. [* proclivities- naturalinclinations]Don Juan had assured me that the displacement and the fixation of the assemblagepoint could be realized at will by means of the sorcerers' iron-handeddiscipline. He said that the sorcerers of his lineage believed that there wereat least six hundred points within the luminous sphere that we are, that whenreached at will by the assemblage point, can each give us a totally inclusiveworld; meaning that, if our assemblage point is displaced to any of those pointsand remains fixed on it, we will perceive a world as inclusive and total as theworld of everyday life, but a different world nevertheless.Don Juan had further explained that the art of sorcery is to manipulate theassemblage point and make it change positions at will on the luminous spheresthat human beings are. The result of this manipulation is a shift in the pointof contact with the dark sea of awareness, which brings as its concomitant adifferent bundle of zillions of energy fields in the form of luminous filamentsthat converge on the assemblage point.The consequence of new energy fields converging on the assemblage point is thatawareness of a different sort than that which is necessary for perceiving theworld of everyday life enters into action, turning the new energy fields intosensory data, sensory data that is interpreted and perceived as a differentworld because the energy fields that engender it are different from the habitualones.Don Juan had asserted that an accurate definition of sorcery as a practice wouldbe to say that sorcery is the manipulation of the assemblage point for purposesof changing its focal point of contact with the dark sea of awareness, thusmaking it possible to perceive other worlds.Don Juan had said that the art of the stalkers enters into play after theassemblage point has been displaced. Maintaining the assemblage point fixed inits new position assures sorcerers that they will perceive whatever new worldthey enter in its absolute completeness, exactly as we do in the world ofordinary affairs. For the sorcerers of don Juan's lineage, the world of everydaylife was but one fold of a total world consisting of at least six hundred folds.Don Juan went back again to the topic under discussion: my journeys through thedark sea of awareness. He said that what I had done from my inner silence wasvery similar to what is done in dreaming when one is asleep. However, whenjourneying through the dark sea of awareness, there was no interruption of anysort caused by going to sleep, nor was there any attempt whatsoever atcontrolling one's attention while having a dream. The journey through the darksea of awareness entailed an immediate response. There was an overpoweringsensation of the here and now. Don Juan lamented the fact that some idioticsorcerers had given the name dreaming-awake to this act of reaching the dark seaof awareness directly, making the term dreaming even more ridiculous.\"When you thought that you had the dream-fantasy of going to that town of ourchoice,\" he continued, \"you had actually placed your assemblage point directlyon a specific position on the dark sea of awareness that allows the journey.Then the dark sea of awareness supplied you with whatever was necessary to carryon that journey. There's no way whatsoever to choose that place at will.Sorcerers say that inner silence selects it unerringly. Simple, isn't it?\"He explained to me then the intricacies of choice. He said that choice, forwarrior-travelers, was not really the act of choosing, but rather the act ofacquiescing elegantly to the solicitations of infinity.\"Infinity chooses,\" he said. \"The art of the warrior-traveler is to have theability to move with the slightest insinuation; the art of acquiescing to everycommand of infinity. For this, a warrior-traveler needs prowess, strength, andabove everything else, sobriety. All those three put together give, as a result,elegance!\"After a moment's pause, I went back to the subject that intrigued me the most.\"But it's unbelievable that I actually went to that town, don Juan, in body andsoul,\" I said.\"It is unbelievable, but it's not unlivable,\" he said. \"The universe has nolimits, and the possibilities at play in the universe at large are indeedincommensurable. So don't fall prey to the axiom, 'I believe only what I see,'because it is the dumbest stand one can possibly take.\"Don Juan's elucidation had been crystal clear. It made sense, but I didn't knowwhere it made sense; certainly not in my daily world of usual affairs. Don Juanassured me then, unleashing a great trepidation in me, that there was only oneway in which sorcerers could handle all this information: to taste it throughexperience, because the mind was incapable of taking in all that stimulation.\"What do you want me to do, don Juan?\" I asked.\"You must deliberately journey through the dark sea of awareness,\" he replied,\"but you'll never know how this is done. Let's say that inner silence does it,following inexplicable ways; ways that cannot be understood, but onlypracticed.\"Don Juan had me sit down on my bed and adopt the position that fostered innersilence. I usually fell asleep instantly whenever I adopted this position.However, when I was with don Juan, his presence always made it impossible for meto fall asleep; instead, I entered into a veritable state of complete quietude.This time, after an instant of silence, I found myself walking. Don Juan wasguiding me by holding my arm as we walked.We were no longer in his house. We were walking in a Yaqui town I had never beenin before. I knew of the town's existence; I had been close to it many times,but I had been made to turn around by the sheer hostility of the people wholived around it. It was a town where it was nearly impossible for a stranger toenter. The only non-Yaquis who had free access to that town were the supervisorsfrom the federal bank because of the fact that the bank bought the crops fromthe Yaqui farmers. The endless negotiations of the Yaqui farmers revolved aroundgetting cash advances from the bank on the basis of a near-speculation processabout future crops.I instantly recognized the town from the descriptions of people who had beenthere. As if to increase my astonishment, don Juan whispered in my ear that wewere in the Yaqui town in question. I wanted to ask him how we had gotten there,but I couldn't articulate my words. There were a large number of Indians talkingin argumentative tones. Tempers seemed to flare. I didn't understand a word ofwhat they were saying, but the moment I conceived of the thought that I couldn'tunderstand, something cleared up. It was very much as if more light went intothe scene. Things became very defined and neat, and I understood what the peoplewere saying although I didn't know how. I didn't speak their language. The wordswere definitely understandable to me, not singularly, but in clusters, as if mymind could pick up whole patterns of thought.I could say in earnest that I got the shock of a lifetime, not so much because Iunderstood what they were saying but because of the content of what they weresaying. Those people were indeed warlike. They were not Western men at all.Their propositions were propositions of strife, warfare, strategy. They weremeasuring their strength, their striking resources, and lamenting the fact thatthey had no power to deliver their blows. I registered in my body the anguish oftheir impotence. All they had were sticks and stones to fight high-technologyweapons. They mourned the fact that they had no leaders. They coveted, more thananything else one could imagine, the rise of some charismatic fighter who couldgalvanize them.I heard then the voice of cynicism; one of them expressed a thought that seemedto devastate everyone equally, including me, for I seemed to be an indivisiblepart of them. He said that they were defeated beyond salvation, because if at agiven moment one of them had the charisma to rise up and rally them, he would bebetrayed because of envy and jealousy and hurt feelings.I wanted to comment to don Juan on what was happening to me, but I couldn'tvoice a single word. Only don Juan could talk.\"The Yaquis are not unique in their pettiness,\" he said in my ear. \"It is acondition in which human beings are trapped, a condition that is not even human,but imposed from the outside.\"I felt my mouth opening and closing involuntarily as I tried desperately to aska question that I could not even conceive of. My mind was blank, void ofthoughts. Don Juan and I were in the middle of a circle of people, but none ofthem seemed to have noticed us. I did not record any movement, reaction, orfurtive glance that may have indicated that they were aware of us.The next instant, I found myself in a Mexican town built around a railroadstation, a town located about a mile and a half east of where don Juan lived.Don Juan and I were in the middle of the street by the government bank.Immediately afterward, I saw one of the strangest sights I had ever been witnessto in don Juan's world. I was seeing energy as it flows in the universe, but Iwasn't seeing human beings as spherical or oblong blobs of energy. The peoplearound me were, in one instant, the normal beings of everyday life, and in thenext instant, they were strange creatures. It was as if the ball of energy thatwe are were transparent; it was like a halo around an insectlike core. That coredid not have a primate's shape. There were no skeletal pieces, so I wasn'tseeing people as if I had X-ray vision that went to the bone core. At the coreof people there were, rather, geometric shapes made of what seemed to be hardvibrations of matter. That core was like letters of the alphabet. A capital Tseemed to be the main structural support. An inverted thick L was suspended infront of the T; the Greek letter for delta, which went almost to the floor, wasat the bottom of the vertical bar of the T, and seemed to be a support for thewhole structure. On top of the letter T, I saw a ropelike strand, perhaps aninch in diameter; it went through the top of the luminous sphere, as if what Iwas seeing were indeed a gigantic bead hanging from the top like a drooping gem.Once, don Juan had presented to me a metaphor to describe the energetic union ofstrands of human beings. He had said that the sorcerers of ancient Mexicodescribed those strands as a curtain made from beads strung on a string. I hadtaken this description literally, and thought that the string went through theconglomerate of energy fields that we are from head to toe. The attaching stringI was seeing made the round shape of the energy fields of human beings look morelike a pendant. I didn't see, however, any other creature being strung by thesame string. Every single creature that I saw was a geometrically patternedbeing that had a sort of string on the upper part of its spherical halo. Thestring reminded me immensely of the segmented wormlike shapes that some of ussee with the eyelids half closed when we are in sunlight.Don Juan and I walked in the town from one end to the other, and I saw literallyscores of geometrically patterned creatures. My ability to see them was unstablein the extreme. I would see them for an instant, and then I would lose sight ofthem and I would be faced with average people.Soon, I became exhausted, and I could see only normal people. Don Juan said thatit was time to go back home, and again, something in me lost my usual sense ofcontinuity. I found myself in don Juan's house without having the slightestnotion as to how I had covered the distance from the town to the house.I lay down in my bed and tried desperately to recollect, to call back my memory,to probe the depths of my very being for a clue as to how I had gone to theYaqui town, and to the railroad-station town. I didn't believe that they hadbeen dream-fantasies, because the scenes were too detailed to be anything butreal, and yet they couldn't possibly have been real.\"You're wasting your time,\" don Juan said, laughing. \"I guarantee you that youwill never know how we got from the house to the Yaqui town, and from the Yaquitown to the railroad station, and from the railroad station to the house. Therewas a break in the continuity of time. That is what inner silence does.\"He patiently explained to me that the interruption of that flow of continuitythat makes the world understandable to us is sorcery. He remarked that I hadjourneyed that day through the dark sea of awareness, and that I had seen peopleas they are, engaged in people's business. And then I had seen the strand ofenergy that joins specific lines of human beings.Don Juan reiterated to me over and over that I had witnessed something specificand inexplicable. I had understood what people were saying, without knowingtheir language, and I had seen the strand of energy that connected human beingsto certain other beings, and I had selected those aspects through an act ofintending it.He stressed the fact that this intending I had done was not something consciousor volitional. The intending had been done at a deep level, and had been ruledby necessity. I had needed to become cognizant of some of the possibilities ofjourneying through the dark sea of awareness, and my inner silence had guidedintent- a perennial force in the universe- to fulfill that need. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"Inorganic AwarenessAt a given moment in my apprenticeship, don Juan revealed to me the complexityof his life situation. He had maintained, to my chagrin and despondency, that helived in the shack in the state of Sonora, Mexico, because that shack depictedmy state of awareness. I didn't quite believe that he really meant that I was someager, nor did I believe that he had other places to live, as he was claiming.It turned out that he was right on both counts. My state of awareness was verymeager, and he did have other places where he could live, infinitely morecomfortable than the shack where I had first found him. Nor was he the solitarysorcerer that I had thought him to be. He was leader of a group of fifteen otherwarrior travelers: ten women and five men.My surprise was gigantic when he took me to his house in central Mexico, wherehe and his companion sorcerers lived.\"Did you live in Sonora just because of me, don Juan?\" I asked him, unable tostand the responsibility which filled me with guilt and remorse and a sensationof worthlessness. \"Well, I didn't actually live there,\" he said, laughing. \"Ijust met you there.\"\"But-but-but you never knew when I was coming to see you, don ]uan,\" I said. \"Ihad no means to let you know!\"\"Well, if you remember correctly,\" he said, \"there were many, many times whenyou didn't find me. You had to sit patiently and wait for me, for dayssometimes.\"\"Did you fly from here to Guaymas, don Juan?\" I asked him in earnest. I thoughtthat the shortest way would have been to take a plane.\"No, I didn't fly to Guaymas,\" he said with a big smile. \"I flew directly, tothe shack where you were waiting.\"I knew that he was purposefully telling me something that my linear mind couldnot understand or accept; something that was confusing me no end. I was at thelevel of awareness, in those days, when I asked myself incessantly a fatalquestion: What if all that don Juan says is true?I didn't want to ask him any more questions, because I was hopelessly lost,trying to bridge our two tracks of thought and action.In his new surroundings, don Juan began painstakingly to instruct me in a morecomplex facet of his knowledge; a facet that required all my attention; a facetin which merely suspending judgment was not enough. This was the time when I hadto plummet down into the depths of his knowledge. I had to cease to beobjective, and at the same time I had to desist from being subjective.One day, I was helping don Juan clean some bamboo poles in the back of hishouse. He asked me to put on some working gloves, because, he said, thesplinters of bamboo were very sharp and easily caused infections. He directed meon how to use a knife to clean the bamboo. I became immersed in the work. Whendon Juan began to talk to me, I had to stop working in order to pay attention.He told me that I had worked long enough, and that we should go into the house.He asked me to sit down in a very comfortable armchair in his spacious, almostempty living room. He gave me some nuts, dried apricots, and slices of cheese,neatly arranged on a plate. I protested that I wanted to finish cleaning thebamboo. I didn't want to eat. But he didn't pay attention to me. He recommendedthat I nibble slowly and carefully, for I would need a steady supply of food inorder to be alert and attentive to what he was going to tell me.\"You already know,\" he began, \"that there exists in the universe a perennialforce, which the sorcerers of ancient Mexico called the dark sea of awareness.While they were at the maximum of their perceiving power, they saw somethingthat made them shake in their pantaloonies, if they were wearing any. They sawthat the dark sea of awareness is responsible not only for the awareness oforganisms, but also for the awareness of entities that don't have an organism.\"\"What is this, don Juan, beings without an organism that have awareness?\" Iasked, astonished, for he had never mentioned such an idea before.\"The old shamans discovered that the entire universe is composed of twinforces,\" he began, \"forces that are at the same time opposed and complementaryto each other. It is inescapable that our world is a twin world. Its oppositeand complementary world is one populated by beings that have awareness, but notan organism. For this reason, the old shamans called them inorganic beings.\"\"And where is this world, don Juan?\" I asked, munching unconsciously on a pieceof dried apricot.Here, where you and I are sitting,\" he replied matter-of-factly, but laughingoutright at my nervousness. \"I told you that it's our twin world, so it'sintimately related to us. The sorcerers of ancient Mexico didn't think like youdo in terms of space and time. They thought exclusively in terms of awareness.Two types of awareness coexist without ever impinging on each other, becauseeach type is entirely different from the other. The old shamans faced thisproblem of coexistence without concerning themselves with time and space. Theyreasoned that the degree of awareness of organic beings and the degree ofawareness of inorganic beings were so different that both could coexist with themost minimal interference.\"\"Can we perceive those inorganic beings, don Juan?\" I asked. \"We certainly can,\"he replied. \"Sorcerers do it at will. Average people do it, but they don'trealize that they're doing it because they are not conscious of the existence ofa twin world. When they think of a twin world, they enter into all kinds ofmental masturbation, but it has never occurred to them that their fantasies havetheir origin in a subliminal knowledge that all of us have: that we are notalone.\"I was riveted by don Juan's words. Suddenly, I had become voraciously hungry.There was an emptiness in the pit of my stomach. All I could do was to listen ascarefully as I could, and eat.\"The difficulty with your facing things in terms of time and space,\" hecontinued, \"is that you only notice if something has landed in the space andtime at your disposal, which is very limited.\"Sorcerers, on the other hand, have a vast field on which they can notice ifsomething extraneous has landed. Lots of entities from the universe at large,entities that possess awareness but not an organism, land in the field ofawareness of our world, or the field of awareness of its twin world, without anaverage human being ever noticing them. The entities that land on our field ofawareness, or the field of awareness of our twin world, belong to other worldsthat exist besides our world and its twin. The universe at large is crammed tothe brim with worlds of awareness, organic and inorganic.\"Don Juan continued talking and said that those sorcerers knew when inorganicawareness from other worlds besides our twin world had landed in their field ofawareness. He said that as every human being on this earth would do, thoseshamans made endless classifications of different types of this energy that hasawareness. They knew them by the general term inorganic beings.\"Do those inorganic beings have life like we have life?\" I asked.\"If you think that life is to be aware, then they do have life,\" he said. \"Isuppose it would be accurate to say that if life can be measured by theintensity, the sharpness, the duration of that awareness, I can sincerely saythat they are more alive than you and I.\"\"Do those inorganic beings die, don Juan?\" I asked.Don Juan chuckled for a moment before he answered. \"If you call death thetermination of awareness, yes, they die. Their awareness ends. Their death israther like the death of a human being, and at the same time, it isn't, becausethe death of human beings has a hidden option. It is something like a clause ina legal document, a clause that is written in tiny letters that you can barelysee. You have to use a magnifying glass to read it, and yet it's the mostimportant clause of the document.\"\"What's the hidden option, don Juan?\"\"Death's hidden option is exclusively for sorcerers. They are the only ones whohave, to my knowledge, read the fine print. For them, the option is pertinentand functional. For average human beings, death means the termination of theirawareness, the end of their organisms.\"For the inorganic beings, death means the same: the end of their awareness. Inboth cases, the impact of death is the act of being sucked into the dark sea ofawareness, Their individual awareness, loaded with their life experiences,breaks its boundaries, and awareness as energy spills out into the dark sea ofawareness.\"\"But what is death's hidden option that is picked up only by sorcerers, donJuan?\" I asked.\"For a sorcerer, death is a unifying factor. Instead of disintegrating theorganism, as is ordinarily the case, death unifies it.\"\"How can death unify anything?\" I protested.\"Death for a sorcerer,\" he said, \"terminates the reign of individual moods inthe body. The old sorcerers believed it was the dominion of the different partsof the body that ruled the moods and the actions of the total body; parts thatbecome dysfunctional drag the rest of the body to chaos, such as, for instance,when you yourself get sick from eating junk. In that case, the mood of yourstomach affects everything else. Death eradicates the dominion of thoseindividual parts. It unifies their awareness into one single unit.\"\"Do you mean that after they die, sorcerers are still aware?\" I asked.\"For sorcerers, death is an act of unification that employs every bit of theirenergy. You are thinking of death as a corpse in front of you, a body on whichdecay has settled. For sorcerers, when the act of unification takes place, thereis no corpse. There is no decay.\"Their bodies in their entirety have been turned into energy, energy possessingawareness that is not fragmented. The boundaries that are set up by theorganism, boundaries which are broken down by death, are still functioning inthe case of sorcerers, although they are no longer visible to the naked eye.\"I know that you are dying to ask me,\" he continued with a broad smile, \"ifwhatever I'm describing is the soul that goes to hell or heaven. No, it is notthe soul. What happens to sorcerers, when they pick up that hidden option ofdeath, is that they turn into inorganic beings, very specialized, high-speedinorganic beings, beings capable of stupendous maneuvers of perception.Sorcerers enter then into what the shamans of ancient Mexico called theirdefinitive journey. Infinity becomes their realm of action.\"\"Do you mean by this, don Juan, that they become eternal?\"\"My sobriety as a sorcerer tells me,\" he said, \"that their awareness willterminate, the way inorganic beings' awareness terminates, but I haven't seenthis happen. I have no firsthand knowledge of it. The old sorcerers believedthat the awareness of this type of inorganic being would last as long as theearth is alive. The earth is their matrix. As long as it prevails, theirawareness continues. To me, this is a most reasonable statement.\"The continuity and order of don Juan's explanation had been, for me, superb. Ihad no way whatsoever in which to contribute. He left me with a sensation ofmystery and unvoiced expectations to be fulfilled.On my next visit to don Juan, I began my conversation by asking him eagerly aquestion that was foremost in my mind.\"Is there a possibility, don Juan, that ghosts and apparitions really exist?\"\"Whatever you may call a ghost or an apparition,\" he said, \"when it isscrutinized by a sorcerer, boils down to one issue- it is possible that any ofthose ghostlike apparitions may be a conglomeratation of energy fields that haveawareness, and which we turn into things we know. If that's the case, then theapparitions have energy. Sorcerers call them energy generating configurations.Or, no energy emanates from them, in which case they are phantasmagoricalcreations, usually of a very strong person- strong in terms of awareness.\"One story that intrigued me immensely,\" don Juan continued, \"was the story youtold me once about your aunt. Do you remember it?\" I had told don Juan that when I was fourteen years old I had gone to live in myfather's sister's house. She lived in a gigantic house that had three patioswith living accommodations in between each of them- bedrooms, living rooms, etc.The first patio was very austere, cobblestoned. They told me that it was acolonial house and this first patio was where horse-drawn carriages had gone in.The second patio was a beautiful orchard zigzagged by brick lanes of Moorishdesign and filled with fruit trees.The third patio was covered with flowerpots hanging from the eaves of the roof,birds in cages, and a colonial-style fountain in the middle of it with runningwater, as well as a large area fenced with chicken wire, set aside for my aunt'sprized fighting cocks, her predilection in life.My aunt made available to me a whole apartment right in front of the fruitorchard. I thought I was going to have the time of my life there. I could eatall the fruit that I wanted. No one else in the household touched the fruit ofany of those trees, for reasons that were never revealed to me.The household was composed of my aunt, a tall, round-faced chubby lady in herfifties, very jovial, a great raconteur, and full of eccentricities that she hidbehind a formal facade and the appearance of devout Catholicism. There was abutler, a tall, imposing man in his early forties who had been a sergeant-majorin the army and had been lured out of the service to occupy the better-paidposition of butler, bodyguard, and all-around man in my aunt's house. His wife,a beautiful young woman, was my aunt's companion, cook, and confidante. Thecouple also had a daughter, a chubby little girl who looked exactly like myaunt. The likeness was so strong that my aunt had adopted her legally.Those four were the quietest people I had ever met. They lived a very sedatelife, punctuated only by the eccentricities of my aunt, who, on the spur of themoment, would decide to take trips, or buy promising new fighting cocks, trainthem, and actually have serious contests in which enormous sums of money wereinvolved. She tended her fighting cocks with loving care, sometimes all daylong. She wore thick leather gloves and stiff leather leggings to keep thefighting cocks from spurring her.I spent two stupendous months living in my aunt's house. She taught me music inthe afternoons, and told me endless stories about my family's ancestors. Myliving situation was ideal for me because I used to go out with my friends anddidn't have to report the time I came back to anybody. Sometimes I used to spendhours without falling asleep, lying on my bed. I used to keep my window open tolet the smell of orange blossoms fill my room. Whenever I was lying there awake,I would hear someone walking down a long corridor that ran the length of thewhole property on the north side, joining all the patios of the house. Thiscorridor had beautiful arches and a tiled floor. There were four light bulbs ofminimal voltage that dimly illuminated the corridor, lights that were turned onat six o'clock every evening and turned off at six in the morning.I asked my aunt if anyone walked at night and stopped at my window, becausewhoever was walking always stopped by my window, turned around, and walked backagain toward the main entrance of the house.\"Don't trouble yourself with nonsense, dear,\" my aunt said, smiling. \"It'sprobably my butler, making his rounds. Big deal! Were you frightened?\"\"No, I was not frightened,\" I said, \"I just got curious, because your butlerwalks up to my room every night. Sometimes his steps wake me up.\"She discarded my inquiry in a matter-of-fact fashion, saying that the butler hadbeen a military man and was habituated to making his rounds, as a sentry would.I accepted her explanation.One day, I mentioned to the butler that his steps were just too loud, and askedif he would make his rounds by my window with a little more care so as to let mesleep.\"I don't know what you're talking about!\" he said in a gruff voice.\"My aunt told me that you make your rounds at night,\" I said.\"I never do such a thing!\" he said, his eyes flaring with disgust.\"But who walks by my window then?\"\"Nobody walks by your window. You're imagining things. Just go back to sleep.Don't go around stirring things up. I'm telling you this for your own good.\"Nothing could have been worse for me in those years than someone telling me thatthey were doing something for my own good. That night, as soon as I began tohear the footsteps, I got out of my bed and stood behind the wall that led tothe entrance of my apartment. When I calculated that whoever was walking was bythe second bulb, I just stuck my head out to look down the corridor. The stepsstopped abruptly, and there was no one in sight. The dimly illuminated corridorwas deserted. If somebody had been walking there, they wouldn't have had time tohide because there was no place to hide. There were only bare walls.My fright was so immense that I woke up the whole household screaming my headoff. My aunt and her butler tried to calm me down by telling me that I wasimagining all that, but my agitation was so intense that both of them sheepishlyconfessed, in the end that something which was unknown to them walked in thathouse every night. Don Juan had said that it was almost surely my aunt who walked at night. That isto say, some aspect of her awareness over which she had no volitional control.He believed that this phenomenon obeyed a sense of playfulness or mystery thatshe cultivated. Don Juan was sure that it was not a far-fetched idea that myaunt, at a subliminal level, was not only making all those noises happen, butthat she was capable of much more complex manipulations of awareness. Don Juanhad also said that to be completely fair, he had to admit the possibility thatthe steps were the product of inorganic awareness.Don Juan said that the inorganic beings who populated our twin world wereconsidered, by the sorcerers of his lineage, to be our relatives. Those shamansbelieved that it was futile to make friends with our inorganic family membersbecause the demands levied on us for such friendships were always exorbitant. Hesaid that that type of inorganic being, who are our first cousins, communicatewith us incessantly, but that their communication with us is not at the level ofconscious awareness. In other words, we know all about them in a subliminal way,while they know all about us in a deliberate, conscious manner.\"The energy from our first cousins is a drag!\" don Juan went on. \"They are asfucked up as we are. Let's say that the organic and inorganic beings of our twinworlds are the children of two sisters who live next door to each other. Theyare exactly alike although they look different. They cannot help us, and wecannot help them. Perhaps we could join together, and make a fabulous familybusiness corporation, but that hasn't happened. Both branches of the family areextremely touchy and take offense over nothing, a typical relationship betweentouchy first cousins. The crux of the matter, the sorcerers of ancient Mexicobelieved, is that both human beings and inorganic beings from the twin worldsare profound egomaniacs.\"According to don Juan, another classification that the sorcerers of ancientMexico made of the inorganic beings was that of scouts, or explorers, and bythis they meant inorganic beings that came from the depths of the universe, andwhich were possessors of awareness infinitely sharper and faster than that ofhuman beings.Don Juan asserted that the old sorcerers had spent generations polishing theirclassification schemes, and their conclusions were that certain types ofinorganic beings from the category of scouts or explorers, because of theirvivaciousness, were akin to man. They could make liaisons and establish asymbiotic relation with men. The old sorcerers called these kinds of inorganicbeings the allies.Don Juan explained that the crucial mistake of those shamans with reference tothis type of inorganic being was to attribute human characteristics to thatimpersonal energy and to believe that they could harness it. They thought ofthose blocks of energy as their helpers, and they relied on them withoutcomprehending that, being pure energy, they didn't have the power to sustain anyeffort.\"I've told you all there is to know about inorganic beings,\" don Juan saidabruptly. \"The only way you can put this to the test is by means of directexperience.\"I didn't ask him what he wanted me to do. A deep fear made my body rattle withnervous spasms that burst like a volcanic eruption from my solar plexus andextended down to the tips of my toes and up to my upper trunk.\"Today, we will go to look for some inorganic beings,\" he announced.Don Juan ordered me to sit on my bed and adopt again the position that fosteredinner silence, I followed his command with unusual ease. Normally, I would havebeen reluctant, perhaps not overtly, but I would have felt a twinge ofreluctance nonetheless.I had a vague thought that by the time I sat down, I was already in a state ofinner silence. My thoughts were no longer clear. I felt an impenetrable darknesssurrounding me, making me feel as if I were falling asleep. My body was utterlymotionless, either because I had no intention of setting up any commands to moveor because I just couldn't formulate them.A moment later, I found myself with don Juan, walking in the Sonoran desert. Irecognized the surroundings. I had been there with him so many times that I hadmemorized every feature of it. It was the end of the day, and the light of thesetting sun created in me a mood of desperation. I walked automatically, awarethat I was feeling in my body sensations that were not accompanied by thoughts.I was not describing to myself my state of being. I wanted to tell this to donJuan, but the desire to communicate my bodily sensations to him vanished in aninstant.Don Juan said, very slowly, and in a low, grave voice, that the dry riverbed onwhich we were walking was a most appropriate place for our business at hand, andthat I should sit on a small boulder, alone, while he went and sat on anotherboulder about fifty feet away. I didn't ask don Juan, as I ordinarily wouldhave, what I was supposed to do. I knew what I had to do. I heard then therustling steps of people walking through the bushes that were sparsely scatteredaround. There wasn't enough moisture in the area to allow the heavy growth ofunderbrush. Some sturdy bushes grew there, with a space of perhaps ten orfifteen feet between them.I saw then two men approaching. They seemed to be local men, perhaps YaquiIndians from one of the Yaqui towns in the vicinity. They came and stood by me.One of them nonchalantly asked me how I had been. I wanted to smile at him,laugh, but I couldn't. My face was extremely rigid. Yet I was ebullient. Iwanted to jump up and down, but I couldn't. I told him that I had been fine.Then I asked them who they were. I said to them that I didn't know them, and yetI sensed an extraordinary familiarity with them- One of the men said,matter-of-factly, that they were my allies.I stared at them, trying to memorize their features, but their features changed.They seemed to mold themselves to the mood of my stare. No thoughts wereinvolved. Everything was a matter guided by visceral sensations. I stared atthem long enough to erase their features completely, and finally, I was facingtwo shiny blobs of luminosity that vibrated. The blobs of luminosity did nothave boundaries. They seemed to sustain themselves cohesively from within. Attimes, they became flat, wide. Then they would take on a verticality again, atthe height of a man.Suddenly, I felt don Juan's arm hooking my right arm and pulling me from theboulder. He said that it was time to go. The next moment, I was in his houseagain, in central Mexico, more bewildered than ever.\"Today, you found inorganic awareness, and then you saw it as it really is,\" hesaid. \"Energy is the irreducible residue of everything. As far as we areconcerned, to see energy directly is the bottom line for a human being. Perhapsthere are other things beyond that, but they are not available to us.\"Don Juan asserted all this over and over, and every time he said it, his wordsseemed to solidify me more and more, to help me return to my normal state.I told don Juan everything I had witnessed; everything I had heard. Don Juanexplained to me that I had succeeded that day in transforming theanthropomorphic shape of the inorganic beings into their essence: impersonalenergy aware of itself.\"You are now in the position of having embodied the realization,\" he said, \"thatit is our cognition, which is in essence an interpretation system, that curtailsour resources. Our cognitive interpretation system is what tells us what theparameters of our possibilities are. And since we have been using that system ofinterpretation all our lives, we cannot possibly dare to go against its dictums.\"The energy of those inorganic beings pushes us,\" don Juan went on, \"and weinterpret that push as we may, depending on our mood. The most sober thing todo, for a sorcerer, is to relegate those entities to an abstract level: Thefewer interpretations sorcerers make, the better off they are.\"From now on,\" he continued, \"whenever you are confronted with the strange sightof an apparition, hold your ground and gaze at it with an inflexible attitude.If it is an inorganic being, your interpretation of it will fall off like deadleaves. If nothing happens, it is just a chicken-shit aberration of your mind,which is not your mind anyway.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Clear ViewFor the first time in my life, I had found myself in a total quandary [*quandary- a state of uncertainty or perplexity] as to how to behave in theworld. The world around me had not changed. It definitely stemmed from a flaw inme.Don Juan's personal influence upon me, and my deep engagement in all theactivities stemming from his practices were taking their toll on me; causing inme a serious incapacity to deal with my fellow men.I had examined my problem and concluded that my flaw was my compulsion tomeasure everyone using don Juan as a yardstick.Don Juan was, in my estimate, a being who lived his life professionally in everyaspect of the term. Every one of his acts, no matter how insignificant, counted.I, on the other hand, was surrounded by people who believed that they wereimmortal beings; people who contradicted themselves every step of the way. Theywere beings whose acts could never be accounted for.It was an unfair game. The cards were stacked against the people I encountered.I had become accustomed to don Juan's unalterable behavior; to his total lack ofself-importance; and to the unfathomable scope of his intellect.Very few of the people I knew were even aware that there existed another patternof behavior that fostered those qualities. Most of them knew only the behavioralpattern of self-reflection, which renders men weak and contorted.Consequently, I was having a very difficult time in my academic studies. I waslosing sight of them. I tried desperately to find a rationale that would justifymy academic endeavors.The only thing that came to my aid and gave me a connection, however flimsy, toacademia was the recommendation that don Juan had made to me once that warriortravelers should have a romance with knowledge, in whatever form knowledge waspresented.Don Juan had defined the concept of warrior travelers by saying that it referredto sorcerer seers who traveled in the dark sea of awareness as total freedomwarriors.He had added that all human beings were travelers of the dark sea of awarenesswhether they were aware of it or not; and that this Earth can be considered as astation on their journey.And for extraneous [* extraneous- not pertinent to the matter underconsideration] reasons, which don Juan didn't care to divulge at the time, thebulk of the travelers have interrupted their voyage.He said that human beings were caught in a sort of eddy; a current that went incircles, giving them the impression of moving while they were, in essence,stationary.He maintained that sorcerers were the only opponents of whatever force kepthuman beings prisoners, and that by means of their discipline sorcerers brokeloose from its grip and continued their journey of awareness. What precipitated the final chaotic upheaval in my academic life was myincapacity to focus my interest on topics of anthropological concern that didn'tmean a hoot to me, not because of their lack of appeal but because they weremostly matters where words and concepts had to be manipulated, as in a legaldocument, to obtain a given result that would establish precedents. It wasargued that human knowledge is built in such a fashion, and that the effort ofevery individual was a building block in constructing a system of knowledge.The example that was put to me was that of the legal system by which we live,and which is of invaluable importance to us. However, my romantic notions at thetime impeded me from conceiving of myself as a 'barrister [* barrister- a lawyerwho speaks in the higher courts of law] at anthropology'.I had bought, lock, stock, and barrel, the concept that anthropology should bethe matrix of all human endeavor, or the measure of man.Don Juan, a consummate pragmatist, a true 'warrior traveler' of the unknown,said that I was full of prunes. He said that it didn't matter that theanthropological topics proposed to me were maneuvers of words and concepts, thatwhat was important was the exercise of discipline.\"It doesn't make any difference,\" he said to me one time, \"how good a reader youare, and how many wonderful books you can read. What's important is that youhave the discipline to read what you don't want to read. The crux of thesorcerers' exercise of going to school is in what you refuse, not in what youaccept.\" I decided to take some time off from my studies and went to work in the artdepartment of a company that made decals. My job engaged my efforts and thoughtsto their fullest extent. My challenge was to carry out the tasks assigned to meas perfectly and as rapidly as I could. To set up the vinyl sheets with theimages to be processed by silk-screening into decals was a standard procedurethat wouldn't admit of any innovation, and the efficiency of the worker wasmeasured by exactness and speed.I became a workaholic and enjoyed myself tremendously.The director of the art department and I became fast friends. He practicallytook me under his wing. His name was Ernest Lipton. I admired and respected himimmensely. He was a fine artist and a magnificent craftsman.His flaw was his softness, his incredible consideration for others, whichbordered on passivity.For example, one day we were driving out of the parking lot of a restaurantwhere we had eaten lunch. Very politely, he waited for another car to pull outof the parking space in front of him. The driver obviously didn't see us andbegan to back out at a considerable speed.Ernest Lipton could easily have blown his horn to attract the man's attention towatch where he was going. Instead, he sat, grinning like an idiot as the guycrashed into his car. Then he turned and apologized to me. \"Gee, I could haveblown my horn,\" he said, \"but it's so frigging loud, it embarrasses me.\"The guy who had backed up into Ernest's car was furious and had to be placated.\"Don't worry,\" Ernest said. \"There is no damage to your car. Besides, you onlysmashed my headlights; I was going to replace them anyway.\"Another day, in the same restaurant, some Japanese people, clients of the decalcompany and Ernest Lipton's guests for lunch, were talking animatedly to us,asking questions. The waiter came with the food and cleared the table of some ofthe salad plates, making room, the best way he could on the narrow table, forthe huge hot plates of the entree.One of the Japanese clients needed more space. He pushed his plate forward. Thepush set Ernest's plate in motion and it began to slide off the table. Again,Ernest could have warned the man, but he didn't. He sat there grinning until theplate fell in his lap.On another occasion, I went to his house to help him put up some rafters overhis patio, where he was going to let a grape vine grow for partial shade andfruit. We prearranged the rafters into a huge frame and then lifted one side andbolted it to some beams. Ernest was a tall, very strong man, and using a lengthof two-by-four as a hoisting device, he lifted the other end for me to fit thebolts into holes that were already drilled into the supporting beams. But beforeI had a chance to put in the bolts there was an insistent knock on the door andErnest asked me to see who it was while he held the frame of rafters.His wife was at the door with her grocery packages. She engaged me in a lengthyconversation and I forgot about Ernest. I even helped her to put her groceriesaway. In the middle of arranging her celery bundles, I remembered that my friendwas still holding the frame of rafters, and knowing him, I knew that he wouldstill be at the job, expecting everybody else to have the consideration that hehimself had.I rushed desperately to the backyard, and there he was on the ground. He hadcollapsed from the exhaustion of holding the heavy wooden frame. He looked likea rag doll. We had to call his friends to lend a hand and hoist up the frame ofrafters- he couldn't do it anymore. He had to go to bed. He thought for surethat he had a hernia.The classic story about Ernest Lipton was that one day he went hiking for theweekend in the San Bernardino Mountains with some friends. They camped in themountains for the night.While everybody was sleeping, Ernest Lipton went to the bushes, and being such aconsiderate man, he walked some distance from the camp so as not to botheranybody. He slipped in the darkness and rolled down the side of the mountain. Hetold his friends afterward that he knew for a fact that he was falling to hisdeath at the bottom of the valley.He was lucky in that he grabbed on to a ledge with the tips of his fingers. Heheld on to it for hours, searching in the dark with his feet for any support,because his arms were about to give in- he was going to hold on until his death.By extending his legs as wide as he could, he found tiny protuberances in therock that helped him to hold on. He stayed stuck to the rock, like the decalsthat he made, until there was enough light for him to realize that he was only afoot from the ground.\"Ernest, you could have yelled for help!\" his friends complained.\"Gee, I didn't think there was any use,\" he replied. \"Who could have heard me? Ithought I had rolled down at least a mile into the valley. Besides, everyone wasasleep.\"The final blow came for me when Ernest Lipton, who spent two hours dailycommuting back and forth from his house to the shop, decided to buy an economycar, a Volkswagen Beetle, and began measuring how many miles he got per gallonof gasoline.I was extremely surprised when he announced one morning that he had reached 125miles per gallon. Being a very exact man, he qualified his statement, sayingthat most of his driving was not done in the city, but on the freeway, althoughat the peak hour of traffic, he had to slow down and accelerate quite often. Aweek later, he said that he had reached the 250 miles per gallon mark.This marvelous event escalated until he reached an unbelievable figure: 645miles to a gallon. His friends told him that he should enter this figure intothe logs of the Volkswagen company. Ernest Lipton was as pleased as punch, andgloated, saying that he wouldn't know what to do if he reached the thousand-milemark. His friends told him that he should claim a miracle.This extraordinary situation went on until one morning when he caught one of hisfriends, who for months had been playing the oldest gag in the book on him,adding gasoline to his tank. Every morning he had been adding three or four cupsso that Ernest's gas gauge was never on empty.Ernest Lipton was nearly angry. His harshest comment was, \"Gee! Is this supposedto be funny?\"I had known for weeks that his friends were playing that gag on him, but I wasunable to intervene. I felt that it was none of my business. The people who wereplaying the gag on Ernest Lipton were his lifelong friends. I was a newcomer.When I saw his look of disappointment and hurt, and his incapacity to get angry,I felt a wave of guilt and anxiety. I was facing again an old enemy of mine. Idespised Ernest Lipton, and at the same time, I liked him immensely. He washelpless.The real truth of the matter was that Ernest Lipton looked like my father. Histhick glasses and his receding hairline, as well as the stubble of graying beardthat he could never quite shave completely, brought my father's features tomind. He had the same straight, pointed nose and pointed chin. But seeing ErnestLipton's inability to get angry and punch the jokers in the nose was what reallyclinched his likeness to my father for me and pushed it beyond the threshold ofsafety.I remembered how my father had been madly in love with the sister of his bestfriend. I spotted her one day in a resort town, holding hands with a young man.Her mother was with her as a chaperone. The girl seemed so happy. The two youngpeople looked at each other, enraptured. As far as I could see, it was younglove at its best.When I saw my father, I told him, relishing every instant of my recounting withall the malice of my ten years, that his girlfriend had a real boyfriend. He wastaken aback. He didn't believe me.\"But have you said anything at all to the girl?\" I asked him daringly- \"Does sheknow that you are in love with her?\"\"Don't be stupid, you little creep!\" he snapped at me. \"I don't have to tell anywoman any shit of that sort!\" Like a spoiled child, he looked at me petulantly,his lips trembling with rage.\"She's mine! She should know that she's my woman without my having to tell heranything!\"He declared all this with the certainty of a child who has had everything inlife given to him without having to fight for it.At the apex of my form, I delivered my punch line. \"Well,\" I said, \"I think sheexpected someone to tell her that, and someone has just beaten you to it.\"I was prepared to jump out of his reach and run because I thought he would slashat me with all the fury in the world, but instead, he crumpled down and began toweep. He asked me, sobbing uncontrollably, that since I was capable of anything,would I please spy on the girl for him and tell him what was going on?I despised my father beyond anything I could say, and at the same time I lovedhim with a sadness that was unmatched. I cursed myself for precipitating thatshame on him.Ernest Lipton reminded me of my father so much that I quit my job, alleging thatI had to go back to school. I didn't want to increase the burden that I alreadycarried on my shoulders. I had never forgiven myself for causing my father thatanguish, and I had never forgiven him for being so cowardly.I went back to school and began the gigantic task of reintegrating myself intomy studies of anthropology. What made this reintegration very difficult was thefact that if there was someone I could have worked with with ease and delightbecause of his admirable touch, his daring curiosity, and his willingness toexpand his knowledge without getting flustered or defending. indefensiblepoints, it was someone outside my department, an archaeologist. It was becauseof his influence that I had become interested in fieldwork in the first place.Perhaps because of the fact that he actually went into the field, literally todig out information, his practicality was an oasis of sobriety for me. He wasthe only one who had encouraged me to go ahead and do field-work because I hadnothing to lose.\"Lose it all, and you'll gain it all,\" he told me once, the soundest advice thatI ever got in academia. If I followed don Juan's advice, and worked towardcorrecting my obsession with self-reflection, I veritably had nothing to loseand everything to gain. But this possibility hadn't been in the cards for me atthat time.When I told don Juan about the difficulty I encountered in finding a professorto work with, I thought that his reaction to what I said was vicious. He calledme a petty fart, and worse. He told me what I already knew: that if I were notso tense, I could have worked successfully with anybody in academia, or inbusiness.\"'Warrior travelers' don't complain,\" don Juan went on. \"They take everythingthat infinity hands them as a challenge. A challenge is a challenge. It isn'tpersonal. It cannot be taken as a curse or a blessing. A warrior-traveler eitherwins the challenge or the challenge demolishes him. It's more exciting to win,so win!\"I told him that it was easy for him or anyone else to say that, but to carry itout was another matter, and that my tribulations were insoluble because theyoriginated in the incapacity of my fellow men to be consistent.\"It's not the people around you who are at fault,\" he said. \"They cannot helpthemselves. The fault is with you, because you can help yourself, but you arebent on judging them, at a deep level of silence. Any idiot can judge. If youjudge them, you will only get the worst out of them. All of us human beings areprisoners, and it is that prison that makes us act in such a miserable way. Yourchallenge is to take people as they are! Leave people alone.\"\"You are absolutely wrong this time, don Juan,\" I said. \"Believe me, I have nointerest whatsoever in judging them, or entangling myself with them in any way.\"\"You do understand what I'm talking about,\" he insisted doggedly. \"If you're notconscious of your desire to judge them,\" he continued, \"you are in even worseshape than I thought. This is the flaw of warrior-travelers when they begin toresume their journeys. They get cocky, out of hand.\"I admitted to don Juan that my complaints were petty in the extreme. I knew thatmuch. I said to him that I was confronted with daily events, events that had thenefarious quality of wearing down all my resolve, and that I was embarrassed torelate to don Juan the incidents that weighed heavily on my mind.\"Come on,\" he urged me. \"Out with it! Don't have any secrets from me. I'm anempty tube. Whatever you say to me will be projected out into infinity.\"\"All I have are miserable complaints,\" I said. \"I am exactly like all the peopleI know. There's no way to talk to a single one of them without hearing an overtor a covert complaint.\"I related to don Juan how in even the simplest dialogues my friends managed tosneak in an endless number of complaints, such as in a dialogue like this one:\"How is everything, Jim?\"\"Oh, fine, fine, Cal.\" A huge silence would follow.I would be obliged to say, \"Is there something wrong, Jim?\"\"No! Everything's great. I have a bit of a problem with Mel, but you know howMel is-selfish and shitty. But you have to take your friends as they come, true?He could, of course, have a little more consideration. But what the heck. He'shimself. He always puts the burden on you- take me or leave me. He's been doingthat since we were twelve, so it's really my fault. Why in the heck do I have totake him?\"\"Well, you're right, Jim, you know Mel is very hard, yes. Yeah!\"\"Well, speaking of shitty people, you're no better than Mel, Cal. I can nevercount on you,\" etc. Another classic dialogue was:\"How are you doing, Alex? How's your married life?\"\"Oh, just great. For the first time, I'm eating on time, home-cooked meals, butI'm getting fat. There's nothing for me to do except watch TV. I used to go outwith you guys, but now I can't. Theresa doesn't let me. Of course, I could tellher to go and shag herself, but I don't want to hurt her. I feel content, butmiserable.\"And Alex had been the most miserable guy before he got married. He was the onewhose classic joke was to tell his friends, every time we ran into him, \"Hey,come to my car, I want to introduce you to my bitch.\"He enjoyed himself pink with our crushed expectations when we would see thatwhat he had in his car was a female dog. He introduced his 'bitch' to all hisfriends. We were shocked when he actually married Theresa, a long-distancerunner. They met at a marathon when Alex fainted. They were in the mountains,and Theresa had to revive him by any means.So she pissed on his face. After that, Alex was her prisoner. She had marked herterritory. His friends used to say, \"Her pissy prisoner.\" His friends thoughtshe was the true bitch who had turned weird Alex into a fat dog.Don Juan and I laughed for a while. Then he looked at me with a seriousexpression.\"These are the ups and downs of daily living,\" don Juan said. \"You win, and youlose, and you don't know when you win or when you lose. This is the price onepays for living under the rule of self-reflection. There is nothing that I cansay to you, and there's nothing that you can say to yourself.I could only recommend that you not feel guilty because you're an asshole, butthat you strive to end the dominion of self-reflection. Go back to school. Don'tgive up yet.\"My interest in remaining in academia was waning considerably. I began to live onautomatic pilot. I felt heavy, despondent.However, I noticed that my mind was not involved. I didn't calculate anything,or set up any goals or expectations of any sort. My thoughts were not obsessive,but my feelings were. I tried to conceptualize this dichotomy [* dichotomy- aclassification into two opposed parts or subclasses] between a quiet mind andturbulent [* turbulent- characterized by unrest or disorder] feelings. It was inthis frame of mindlessness and overwhelmed feelings that I walked one day fromHaines Hall, where the anthropology department was, to the cafeteria to eat mylunch.I was suddenly accosted by a strange tremor. I thought I was going to faint, andI sat down on some brick steps. I saw yellow spots in front of my eyes. I hadthe sensation that I was spinning. I was sure that I was going to get sick to mystomach. My vision became blurry, and finally I couldn't see a thing. Myphysical discomfort was so total and intense that it didn't leave room for asingle thought.I had only bodily sensations of fear and anxiety mixed with elation, and astrange anticipation that I was at the threshold of a gigantic event. They weresensations without the counterpart of thought. At a given moment, I no longerknew whether I was sitting or standing. I was surrounded by the mostimpenetrable darkness one can imagine, and then, I saw energy as it flowed inthe universe.I saw a succession of luminous spheres walking toward me or away from me. I sawthem one at a time, as don Juan had always told me one sees them. I knew theywere different individuals because of their differences in size.I examined the details of their structures. Their luminosity and their roundnesswere made of fibers that seemed to be stuck together. They were thin or thickfibers. Every one of those luminous figures had a thick, shaggy covering. Theylooked like some strange, luminous, furry animals, or gigantic round insectscovered with luminous hair.What was the most shocking thing to me was the realization that I had seen thosefurry insects all my life. Every occasion on which don Juan had made medeliberately see them seemed to me at that moment to be like a detour that I hadtaken with him. I remembered every instance of his help in making me see peopleas luminous spheres, and all of those instances were set apart from the bulk ofseeing to which I was having access now.I knew then, as beyond the shadow of a doubt, that I had perceived energy as itflows in the universe all my life, on my own, without anybody's help. Such arealization was overwhelming to me. I felt infinitely, vulnerable, frail. Ineeded to seek cover; to hide somewhere.It was exactly like the dream that most of us seem to have at one time oranother in which we find ourselves naked and don't know what to do. I felt morethan naked; I felt unprotected, weak, and I dreaded returning to my normalstate. In a vague way, I sensed that I was lying down. I braced myself for myreturn to normality. I conceived of the idea that I was going to find myselflying on the brick walk, twitching convulsively, surrounded by a whole circle ofspectators.The sensation that I was lying down became more and more accentuated. I feltthat I could move my eyes. I could see light through my closed eyelids, but Idreaded opening them. The odd part was that I didn't hear any of those peoplethat I imagined were around me. I heard no noise at all. At last, I venturedopening my eyes. I was on my bed, in my office apartment by the corner ofWilshire and Westwood boulevards.I became quite hysterical upon finding myself in my bed. But for some reasonthat was beyond my grasp, I calmed down almost immediately. My hysteria wasreplaced by a bodily indifference, or by a state of bodily satisfaction,something like what one feels after a good meal.However, I could not quiet my mind. It had been the most shocking thingimaginable for me to realize that I had perceived energy directly all my life.How in the world could it have been possible that I hadn't known? What had beenpreventing me from gaining access to that facet of my being? Don Juan had saidthat every human being has the potential to see energy directly. What he hadn'tsaid was that every human being already sees energy directly but doesn't knowit.I put that question to a psychiatrist friend. He couldn't shed any light on myquandary. He thought that my reaction was the result of fatigue andoverstimulation. He gave me a prescription for Valium and told me to rest.I hadn't dared mention to anyone that I had woken up in my bed without beingable to account for how I had gotten there. Therefore, my haste to see don Juanwas more than justified. I flew to Mexico City as soon as I could, rented a car,and drove to where he lived.\"You've done all this before!\" don Juan said, laughing, when I narrated mymind-boggling experience to him. \"There are only two things that are new. One isthat now you have perceived energy all by yourself. What you did was to stop theworld, and then you realized that you have always seen energy as it flows in theuniverse, as every human being does, but without knowing it deliberately. Theother new thing is that you have traveled from your inner silence all byyourself.\"You know, without my having to tell you, that anything is possible if onedeparts from inner silence. This time your fear and vulnerability made itpossible for you to end up in your bed, which is not really that far from theUCLA campus. If you would not indulge in your surprise, you would realize thatwhat you did is nothing, nothing extraordinary for a warrior traveler.\"But the issue which is of the utmost importance isn't knowing that you havealways perceived energy directly, or your journeying from inner silence, but,rather, a twofold affair.\"First, you experienced something which the sorcerers of ancient Mexico calledthe clear view, or losing the human form; the time when human pettinessvanishes, as if it had been a patch of fog looming over us, a fog that slowlyclears up and dissipates.\"But under no circumstances must you consider this accomplishment as an end.\"The sorcerers' world is not an immutable [* immutable- not subject orsusceptible to change] world like the world of everyday life, where they tellyou that once you reach a goal, you remain a winner forever.\"In the sorcerers' world, to arrive at a certain goal means that you have simplyacquired the most efficient tools to continue your fight, which, by the way,will never end.\"The second part of this twofold matter is that you experienced the mostmaddening question for the hearts of human beings. You expressed it yourselfwhen you asked yourself the questions: 'How in the world could it have beenpossible that I didn't know that I had perceived energy directly all my life?What had been preventing me from gaining access to that facet of my being?'\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"Mud ShadowsTo sit in silence with don Juan was one of the most enjoyable experiences Iknew.We were comfortably sitting on some stuffed chairs in the back of his house inthe mountains of central Mexico. It was late afternoon. There was a pleasantbreeze. The sun was behind the house, at our backs. Its fading light createdexquisite shades of green in the big trees in the backyard.There were big trees growing around his house, and beyond it, which obliteratedthe sight of the city where he lived. This always gave me the impression that Iwas in the wilderness; a different wilderness than the barren Sonoran desert,but wilderness nonetheless.\"Today, we're going to discuss a most serious topic in sorcery,\" don Juan saidabruptly, \"and we're going to begin by talking about the energy body.\" He had described the energy body to me countless times, saying that it was aconglomerate of energy fields; the mirror image of the conglomerate of energyfields that makes up the physical body when it is seen as energy that flows inthe universe.He had said that the energy body was smaller, more compact, and of heavierappearance than the luminous sphere of the physical body.Don Juan had explained that the body and the energy body were two conglomeratesof energy fields compressed together by some strange agglutinating [*agglutinating- strung or clumped together] force.He had emphasized no end that this force that binds that group of energy fieldstogether was, according to the sorcerers of ancient Mexico, the most mysteriousforce in the universe.His personal estimation was that this force was the pure essence of the entirecosmos; the sum total of everything there is.He had asserted that the physical body and the energy body were the onlycounterbalanced energy configurations in our realm as human beings. He accepted,therefore, no other dualism in our lives than the one between these two.The dualism between body and mind, or spirit and flesh, he considered to be amere concatenation [* concatenation- a linking together as in a chain] of themind, emanating from our minds without any energetic foundation.Don Juan had said that by means of discipline, it is possible for anyone tobring the energy body closer to the physical body.Normally, the distance between the two is enormous.Once the energy body is within a certain range which varies for each of usindividually, through discipline anyone can forge it into the exact replica oftheir physical body; that is to say, a three-dimensional, solid being; hence thesorcerers' idea of the other or the double.By the same token, through the same processes of discipline, anyone can forgetheir three-dimensional, solid physical body to be a perfect replica of theirenergy body; that is to say, an ethereal charge of energy invisible to the humaneye, as all energy is.When don Juan had told me all about this, my reaction had been to ask him if hewas describing a mythical proposition.He had replied that there was nothing mythical about sorcerers. Sorcerers werepractical beings, and what they described was always something quite sober anddown-to-earth.According to don Juan, the difficulty in understanding what sorcerers did wasthat they proceeded from a different cognitive system. Sitting at the back of his house in central Mexico that day, don Juan said thatthe energy body was of key importance in whatever was taking place in my life.He saw that it was an energetic fact that my energy body, instead of moving awayfrom me as normally happens, was approaching me with great speed.\"What does it mean that it's approaching me?\" I asked.Smiling, don Juan said, \"It means that something is going to knock the daylightsout of you. A tremendous degree of control is going to come into your life, butnot your control; the energy body's control.\"I asked, \"Do you mean that some outside force will control me?\"\"There are scores of outside forces controlling you at this moment,\" don Juanreplied. \"The control that I am referring to is something outside the domain oflanguage.\"It is your control and at the same time it is not. It cannot be classified, butit can certainly be experienced. And above all, it can certainly be manipulated.\"Remember this: This control can be manipulated to your total advantage, ofcourse, which is not your advantage, but the energy body's advantage.\"However, the energy body is you. So we could go on forever like dogs bitingtheir own tails trying to describe this. Language is inadequate. All theseexperiences are beyond syntax.\" Darkness had descended very quickly. The foliage of the trees that had beenglowing green a little while before was now very dark and heavy.Don Juan said that if I paid close attention to the darkness of the foliagewithout focusing my eyes, and if I sort of looked at it from the corner of myeye, I would see a fleeting shadow crossing my field of vision.He said, \"This is the appropriate time of day for doing what I am asking you todo. It takes a moment to engage the necessary attention in you to do it. Don'tstop until you catch that fleeting black shadow.\"I did see some strange fleeting black shadow projected on the foliage [*foliage- the leaf-like parts of plants responsible for photosynthesis] of thetrees. It was either one shadow going back and forth, or there were variousfleeting shadows moving from left to right, right to left and straight up in theair.They looked like fat black fish to me; enormous fish. It was as if giganticswordfish were flying in the air. I was engrossed in the sight.Then, finally, it scared me. Although, it became too dark to see the foliage, Icould still see the fleeting black shadows.\"What is it, don Juan?\" I asked. \"I see fleeting black shadows all over theplace.\"\"Ah,\" he said, \"that's the universe at large; incommensurable, nonlinear, andoutside the realm of syntax.\"The sorcerers of ancient Mexico were the first ones to see those fleetingshadows, so the sorcerers followed them around. They saw them as you're seeingthem, and they saw them as energy that flows in the universe.\"And those sorcerers discovered something transcendental.\" [* transcendental-existing outside of or not in accordance with nature]He stopped talking and looked at me. His pause was perfectly placed. He stoppedtalking when I was hanging by a thread.I asked, \"What did they discover, don Juan?\"\"They discovered that we have a companion for life,\" he said, as clearly as hecould. \"We have a predator that came from the depths of the cosmos, and tookover the rule of our lives. Human beings are its prisoners. The predator is ourlord and master.\"It has rendered us docile; helpless. If we want to protest, it suppresses ourprotest. If we want to act independently, it demands that we don't do so.\"It was very dark around us, and that seemed to curtail any expression on mypart. If it had been daylight, I would have laughed my head off. In the dark, Ifelt quite inhibited.\"It's pitch black around us,\" don Juan said, \"but if you look out of the cornerof your eye, you will still see fleeting shadows jumping all around you.\"He was right. I could still see them. Their movement made me dizzy. Don Juanturned on the light, and that seemed to dissipate everything.Don Juan said, \"You have arrived, by your effort alone, to what the shamans ofancient Mexico called the topic of topics.\"I have been beating around the bush all this time, insinuating to you thatsomething is holding us prisoner. Indeed we are held prisoner! This was anenergetic fact for the sorcerers of ancient Mexico.\"\"Why has this predator taken over in the fashion that you're describing, donJuan?\" I asked. \"There must be a logical explanation.\"\"There is an explanation,\" don Juan replied, \"which is the simplest explanationin the world.\"They took over because we are food for them, and they squeeze us mercilesslybecause we are their sustenance.\"Just as we rear chickens in chicken coops, gallineros, the predators rear us inhuman coops, humaneros. Therefore, their food is always available to them.\"I felt that my head was shaking violently from side to side. I could not expressmy profound sense of unease and discontentment, but my body moved to bring it tothe surface. I shook from head to toe without any volition on my part.I heard myself saying, \"No, no, no, no. This is absurd, don Juan. What you'resaying is something monstrous. It simply can't be true, for sorcerers, or foraverage men, or for anyone.\"\"Why not?\" don Juan asked calmly. \"Why not? Because it infuriates you?\"\"Yes, it infuriates me,\" I retorted. \"Those claims are monstrous!\"\"Well,\" he said, \"you haven't heard all the claims yet. Wait a bit longer andsee how you feel.\"I'm going to subject you to a blitz. That is, I'm going to subject your mind totremendous onslaughts; and you cannot get up and leave because you're caught.Not because I'm holding you prisoner, but because something in you will preventyou from leaving while another part of you is going to go truthfully berserk. Sobrace yourself!\"There was something in me which I felt was a 'glutton for punishment'. He wasright. I wouldn't have left the house for the world; and yet I didn't like onebit the inanities he was spouting.Don Juan said, \"I want to appeal to your analytical mind. Think for a moment,and tell me how you would explain the contradiction between the intelligence ofman the engineer, and the stupidity of his systems of beliefs; or the stupidityof his contradictory behavior.\"Sorcerers believe that the predators have given us our systems of beliefs; ourideas of good and evil; our social mores. The predators are the ones who set upour hopes and expectations, and dreams of success or failure. They have given uscovetousness, [* covetousness- an envious eagerness to possess something] greed,and cowardice. It is the predators who make us complacent, routinary, andegomaniacal.\"\"But how can they do this, don Juan?\" I asked, somehow angered further by whathe was saying. \"Do they whisper all that in our ears while we are asleep?\"\"No, they don't do it that way. That's idiotic!\" don Juan said, smiling. \"Theyare infinitely more efficient and organized than that.\"In order to keep us obedient, meek and weak, the predators engaged themselvesin a stupendous maneuver- stupendous, of course, from the point of view of afighting strategist; a horrendous maneuver from the point of view of those whosuffer it.\"They gave us their mind! Do you hear me? The predators give us their mind whichbecomes our mind. The predators' mind is baroque, contradictory, morose, andfilled with the fear of being discovered any minute now.\"I know that even though you have never suffered hunger,\" he went on, \"you havefood anxiety which is none other than the anxiety of the predator who fears thatany moment now its maneuver is going to be uncovered, and its food is going tobe denied.\"Through the mind, which after all is their mind, the predators inject into thelives of human beings whatever is convenient for them. The predators ensure inthis manner a degree of security to act as a buffer against their fear.\"\"It's not that I can't accept all this at face value, don Juan,\" I said. \"Icould, but there's something so odious about it that it actually repels me. Itforces me to take a contradictory stand.\"If it's true that they eat us, how do they do it?\"Don Juan had a broad smile on his face. He was as pleased as punch.He explained that sorcerers see infant human beings as strange, luminous ballsof energy covered from the top to the bottom with a glowing coat something likea plastic cover that is adjusted tightly over their cocoon of energy.He said that that glowing coat of awareness was what the predators consumed, andthat when a human being reached adulthood, all that was left of that glowingcoat of awareness was a narrow fringe that went from the ground to the top ofthe toes. That fringe permitted mankind to continue living, but only barely.As if I were in a dream, I heard don Juan explaining that, to his knowledge, manwas the only species that had the glowing coat of awareness outside thatluminous cocoon. Therefore, he became easy prey for an awareness of a differentorder; such as the heavy awareness of the predator.He then made the most damaging statement he had made so far. He said that thisnarrow fringe of awareness was the epicenter of self-reflection where man wasirremediably caught.By playing on our self-reflection, which is the only point of awareness left tous, the predators create flares of awareness that they proceed to consume in aruthless, predatory fashion.They give us inane problems that force those flares of awareness to rise, and inthis manner they keep us alive in order for them to be fed with the energeticflare of our pseudo-concerns.There must have been something in what don Juan was saying which was sodevastating to me that at that point I actually got sick to my stomach.After a moment's pause long enough for me to recover, I asked don Juan, \"But whyis it that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico and all sorcerers today, althoughthey see the predators, don't do anything about it?\"\"There's nothing that you and I can do about it,\" don Juan said in a grave, sadvoice. \"All we can do is discipline ourselves to the point where they will nottouch us.\"How can you ask your fellow men to go through those rigors of discipline?They'll laugh and make fun of you; and the more aggressive ones will beat theshit out of you- and not so much because they don't believe it.\"Down in the depths of every human being, there is an ancestral, visceral [*visceral- obtained through intuition rather than from reasoning or observation]knowledge about the predators' existence.\"My analytical mind swung back and forth like a yo-yo. It left me and came back,and left me and came back again. Whatever don Juan was proposing waspreposterous, incredible.At the same time, it was a most reasonable thing; so simple. It explained everykind of human contradiction I could think of.But how could one have taken all this seriously? Don Juan was pushing me intothe path of an avalanche that would take me down forever.I felt another wave of a threatening sensation. The wave didn't stem from me,yet it was attached to me. Don Juan was doing something to me, mysteriouslypositive and terribly negative at the same time. I sensed it as an attempt tocut a thin film that seemed to be glued to me.His eyes were fixed on mine in an unblinking stare. He moved his eyes away, andbegan to talk without looking at me anymore.\"Whenever doubts plague you to a dangerous point,\" he said, \"do somethingpragmatic about it. Turn off the light. Pierce the darkness; find out what youcan see.\"He got up to turn off the lights. I stopped him.\"No, no, don Juan,\" I said, \"don't turn off the lights. I'm doing okay.\"What I felt then was a most unusual, for me, fear of the darkness. The merethought of it made me pant. I definitely knew something viscerally, [* visceral-relating to or affecting internal organs collectively rather than from reasoningor observation] but I wouldn't dare touch it, or bring it to the surface, not ina million years!\"You saw the fleeting shadows against the trees,\" don Juan said, sitting backagainst his chair. \"That's pretty good. I'd like you to see them inside thisroom. You're not seeing anything. You're just merely catching fleeting images.You have enough energy for that.\"I feared that don Juan would get up anyway and turn off the lights, which hedid. Two seconds later, I was screaming my head off. Not only did I catch aglimpse of those fleeting images, I heard them buzzing by my ears.Don Juan doubled up with laughter as he turned on the lights.\"What a temperamental fellow!\" he said. \"A total disbeliever, on the one hand;and a total pragmatist on the other.\"You must arrange this internal fight, otherwise you're going to swell up like abig toad and burst.\"Don Juan kept on pushing his barb deeper and deeper into me. \"The sorcerers ofancient Mexico,\" he said, \"saw the predator. They called it the flyer because itleaps through the air. It is not a pretty sight. It is a big shadow,impenetrably dark, a black shadow that jumps through the air. Then, it landsflat on the ground.\"The sorcerers of ancient Mexico were quite ill at ease with the idea of when itmade its appearance on Earth. They reasoned that man must have been a completebeing at one point, with stupendous insights and feats of awareness that aremythological legends nowadays. And then everything seems to disappear, and wehave now a sedated man.\"I wanted to get angry and call him a paranoiac, but somehow the righteousnessthat was usually just underneath the surface of my being wasn't there.Something in me was beyond the point of asking myself my favorite question: Whatif all that he said is true? At the moment he was talking to me that night, inmy heart of hearts, I felt that all of what he was saying was true, but at thesame time and with equal force, I felt that all that he was saying was absurdityitself.\"What are you saying, don Juan?\" I asked feebly. My throat was constricted. Icould hardly breathe.\"What I'm saying is that what we have against us is not a simple predator. It isvery smart and organized. It follows a methodical system to render us useless.Man, the magical being that he is destined to be, is no longer magical. He's anaverage piece of meat. There are no more dreams for man but the dreams of ananimal who is being raised to become a piece of meat: trite, conventional,imbecilic.\"Don Juan's words were eliciting a strange, bodily reaction in me comparable tothe sensation of nausea. It was as if I were going to get sick to my stomachagain. But the nausea was coming from the bottom of my being, from the marrow ofmy bones. I convulsed involuntarily.Don Juan shook me by the shoulders forcefully. I felt my neck wobbling back andforth under the impact of his grip. The maneuver calmed me down at once. I feltmore in control.\"This predator,\" don Juan said, \"which, of course, is an inorganic being, is notaltogether invisible to us as other inorganic beings are. I think as children wedo see it, but we decide it's so horrific that we don't want to think about it.\"Children, of course, could insist on focusing on the sight, but everybody elsearound them dissuades them from doing so.Continuing, he said, \"The only alternative left for mankind is discipline.Discipline is the only deterrent.\"But by discipline I don't mean harsh routines. I don't mean waking up everymorning at five-thirty and throwing cold water on yourself until you're blue.\"Sorcerers understand discipline as the capacity to face with serenity odds thatare not included in our expectations. For sorcerers, discipline is an art; theart of facing infinity without flinching; not because they are strong and tough,but because they are filled with awe.\"\"In what way would the sorcerers' discipline be a deterrent to the flyers?\" Iasked.Don Juan scrutinized my face as if to discover any signs of my disbelief. Hesaid, \"Sorcerers say that discipline makes the glowing coat of awarenessunpalatable to the flyer.\"The result is that the predators become bewildered. An inedible glowing coat ofawareness is not part of their cognition, I suppose. After being bewildered,they don't have any recourse other than refraining from continuing theirnefarious [* nefarious- extremely wicked] task.He continued, saying, \"If the predators don't eat our glowing coat of awarenessfor a while, it will keep on growing. Simplifying this matter to the extreme, Ican say that sorcerers, by means of their discipline, push the predators awaylong enough to allow their glowing coat of awareness to grow beyond the level ofthe toes. Once it goes beyond the level of the toes, it grows back to itsnatural size.\"The sorcerers of ancient Mexico used to say that the glowing coat of awarenessis like a tree. If it is not pruned, it grows to its natural size and volume. Asawareness reaches levels higher than the toes, tremendous maneuvers ofperception become a matter of course.\"The grand trick of those sorcerers of ancient times,\" don Juan continued, \"wasto burden the flyers' mind with discipline.\"Sorcerers found out that if they taxed the flyers' mind with inner silence, theforeign installation would flee, and give any one of the practitioners involvedin this maneuver the total certainty of the mind's foreign origin.\"The foreign installation comes back, I assure you, but not as strong; and aprocess begins in which the fleeing of the flyers' mind becomes routine untilone day it flees permanently.\"That's the day when you have to rely on your own devices which are nearly zero.A sad day indeed! There's no one to tell you what to do. There's no mind offoreign origin to dictate the imbecilities you're accustomed to.\"My teacher, the nagual Julian, used to warn all his disciples,\" don Juancontinued, \"that this was the toughest day in a sorcerer's life for the realmind that belongs to us.\"The sum total of our experience after a lifetime of domination has beenrendered shy, insecure, and shifty.\"Personally, I would say that the real battle of sorcerers begins at thatmoment. The rest is merely preparation.\"I became genuinely agitated. I wanted to know more, and yet a strange feeling inme clamored for me to stop. It alluded to dark results and punishment, somethinglike the wrath of God descending on me for tampering with something veiled byGod himself. I made a supreme effort to allow my curiosity to win.I heard myself say, \"What-what-what do you mean, by taxing the flyers' mind?\"\"Discipline taxes the foreign mind no end,\" he replied. \"So, through theirdiscipline, sorcerers vanquish the foreign installation.\"I was overwhelmed by his statements. I believed that don Juan was eithercertifiably insane or that he was telling me something so awesome that it frozeeverything in me.I noticed, however how quickly I rallied my energy to deny everything he hadsaid. After an instant of panic, I began to laugh, as if don Juan had told me ajoke. I even heard myself saying, \"Don Juan, don Juan, you're incorrigible!\" [*incorrigible- not capable of being affected by correction or punishment]Don Juan seemed to understand everything I was experiencing. He shook his headfrom side to side, and raised his eyes to the heavens in a gesture of mockdespair.He said, \"I am so incorrigible, that I am going to give the flyers' mind whichyou carry inside you one more jolt. I am going to reveal to you one of the mostextraordinary secrets of sorcery. I am going to describe to you a finding thattook sorcerers thousands of years to verify and consolidate.\"He looked at me, smiled maliciously, and said, \"The flyers' mind flees foreverwhen a sorcerer succeeds in grabbing on to the vibrating force that holds ustogether as a conglomerate of energy fields. If a sorcerer maintains thatpressure long enough, the flyers' mind flees in defeat. And that's exactly whatyou are going to do; hold on to the energy that binds you together.\"I had the most inexplicable reaction I could have imagined. Something in meactually shook, as if it had received a jolt. I entered into a state ofunwarranted fear, which I immediately associated with my religious background.Don Juan looked at me from head to toe.\"You are fearing the wrath of God, aren't you?\" he said. \"Rest assured, that'snot your fear. It's the flyers' fear, because it knows that you will do exactlyas I'm telling you.\"His words did not calm me at all. I felt worse. I was actually convulsinginvoluntarily, and I had no means to stop it.\"Don't worry,\" don Juan said calmly. \"I know for a fact that those attacks wearoff very quickly. The flyer's mind has no concentration whatsoever.\"After a moment, everything stopped as don Juan had predicted. To say again thatI was bewildered is a euphemism. [* euphemism- an inoffensive expression that issubstituted for one that is considered offensive]This was the first time in my life ever, with don Juan or alone, that I didn'tknow whether I was coming or going.I wanted to get out of the chair and walk around, but I was deathly afraid. Iwas filled with rational assertions, and at the same time I was filled with aninfantile fear.I began to breathe deeply as a cold perspiration covered my entire body. I hadsomehow unleashed on myself a most godawful sight: black, fleeting shadowsjumping all around me wherever I turned.I closed my eyes and rested my head on the arm of the stuffed chair. \"I don'tknow which way to turn, don Juan,\" I said. \"Tonight, you have really succeededin getting me lost.\"Don Juan said, \"You're being torn by an internal struggle.\"Down in the depths of you, you know that you are incapable of refusing theagreement that an indispensable part of you, your glowing coat of awareness, isgoing to serve as an incomprehensible source of nourishment to, naturally,incomprehensible entities.\"And another part of you will stand against this situation with all its might.\"The sorcerers' revolution,\" he continued, \"is that they refuse to honoragreements in which they did not participate.\"Nobody ever asked me if I would consent to being eaten by beings of a differentkind of awareness. My parents just brought me into this world to be food, likethemselves, and that's the end of the story.\"Don Juan stood up from his chair and stretched his arms and legs. \"We have beensitting here for hours. It's time to go into the house. I'm going to eat. Do youwant to eat with me?\"I declined. My stomach was in an uproar.\"I think you'd better go to sleep,\" he said. \"The blitz has devastated you.\"I didn't need any further coaxing. I collapsed onto my bed, and fell asleep likethe dead.At home, as time went by, the idea of the flyers became one of the mainfixations of my life. I got to the point where I felt that don Juan wasabsolutely right about them. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't discard hislogic.The more I thought about it, and the more I talked to and observed myself, andmy fellow men, the more intense the conviction that something was rendering usincapable of any activity or any interaction or any thought that didn't have theself as its focal point.My concern, as well as the concern of everyone I knew or talked to, was theself.Since I couldn't find any explanation for such universal homogeneity, I believedthat don Juan's line of thought was the most appropriate way of elucidating thephenomenon.I went as deeply as I could into readings about myths and legends. In reading, Iexperienced something I had never felt before: Each of the books I read was aninterpretation of myths and legends. In each one of those books, a homogeneousmind was palpable.The styles differed, but the drive behind the words was homogeneously the same:Even though the theme was something as abstract as myths and legends, theauthors always managed to insert statements about themselves. The homogeneousdrive behind every one of those books was not the stated theme of the book.Instead, it was self-service. I had never felt this before.I attributed my reaction to don Juan's influence. The unavoidable question thatI posed to myself was: Is he influencing me to see this, or is there really aforeign mind dictating everything we do?I lapsed, perforce, into denial again, and I went insanely from denial toacceptance to denial. Something in me knew that whatever don Juan was driving atwas an energetic fact; but something equally important in me knew that all ofthat was guff.The end result of my internal struggle was a sense of foreboding; the sense ofsomething imminently dangerous coming at me.I made extensive anthropological inquiries into the subject of the flyers inother cultures, but I couldn't find any references to them anywhere. Don Juanseemed to be the only source of information about this matter. The next time I saw him, I instantly jumped to talk about the flyers.I said, \"I have tried my best to be rational about this subject matter, but Ican't. There are moments when I fully agree with you about the predators.\"\"Focus your attention on the fleeting shadows that you actually see,\" don Juansaid with a smile.I told don Juan that those fleeting shadows were going to be the end of myrational life. I saw them everywhere.Since I had left his house, I was incapable of going to sleep in the dark. Tosleep with the lights on did not bother me at all. The moment I turned thelights off, however, everything around me began to jump. I never saw completefigures or shapes. All I saw were fleeting black shadows.\"The flyers' mind has not left you,\" don Juan said. \"It has been seriouslyinjured. It's trying its best to rearrange its relationship with you. Butsomething in you is severed forever. The flyer knows that. The real danger isthat the flyers' mind may win by getting you tired and forcing you to quit byplaying the contradiction between what it says and what I say.\"You see, the flyers' mind has no competitors,\" don Juan continued. \"When itproposes something, it agrees with its own proposition, and it makes you believethat you've done something of worth.\"The flyers' mind will say to you that whatever Juan Matus is telling you ispure nonsense, and then the same mind will agree with its own proposition, 'Yes,of course, it is nonsense,' you will say. That's the way they overcome us.\"The flyers are an essential part of the universe,\" he went on, \"and they mustbe taken as what they really are- awesome, monstrous. They are the means bywhich the universe tests us.\"We are energetic probes created by the universe,\" he continued as if he wereoblivious to my presence, \"and it's because we are possessors of energy that hasawareness that we are the means by which the universe becomes aware of itself.\"The flyers are the implacable [* implacable- incapable of being more favourablyinclined, or gaining the good will of] challengers. They cannot be taken asanything else. If we succeed in doing that, the universe allows us to continue.\"I wanted don Juan to say more. But he said only, \"The blitz ended the last timeyou were here. There's only so much to be said about the flyers. It's time foranother kind of maneuver.\" I couldn't sleep that night. I fell into a light sleep in the early hours of themorning until don Juan dragged me out of my bed and took me for a hike in themountains.Where he lived, the configuration of the land was very different from that ofthe Sonoran desert, but he told me not to indulge in comparison; that afterwalking for a quarter of a mile, every place in the world was just the same.He said, \"Sightseeing is for people in cars. They go at great speed without anyeffort on their part. Sightseeing is not for walkers.\"For instance, when you are riding in a car, you may see a gigantic mountainwhose sight overwhelms you with its beauty. The sight of the same mountain willnot overwhelm you in the same manner if you look at it while you're going onfoot. It will overwhelm you in a different way, especially if you have to climbit or go around it.\"It was very hot that morning. We walked on a dry riverbed. One thing that thisvalley and the Sonoran desert had in common was their millions of insects. Thegnats and flies all around me were like dive-bombers that aimed at my nostrils,eyes, and ears. Don Juan told me not to pay attention to their buzzing.\"Don't try to disperse them with your hand,\" he uttered in a firm tone. \"Intendthem away. Set up an energy barrier around you. Be silent, and from your silencethe barrier will be constructed. Nobody knows how this is done. It is one ofthose things that the old sorcerers called energetic facts. Shut off yourinternal dialogue. That's all it takes.\"I want to propose a weird idea to you,\" don Juan went on as he kept walkingahead of me.I had to accelerate my steps to be closer to him so as not to miss anything hesaid.\"I have to stress,\" he said, \"that this is a weird idea that will find endlessresistance in you. I will tell you beforehand that you won't accept it easily.But the fact that it's weird should not be a deterrent. You are a socialscientist. Therefore, your mind is always open to inquiry, isn't that so?\"Don Juan was shamelessly making fun of me. I knew it, but it didn't bother me.Perhaps due to the fact that he was walking so fast and I had to make atremendous effort to keep up with him, his sarcasm just sloughed off me, andinstead of making me feisty, it made me laugh.My undivided attention was focused on what he was saying, and the insects eitherstopped bothering me because I had intended a barrier of energy around me, orbecause I was so busy listening to don Juan that I didn't care about theirbuzzing around me anymore.\"The weird idea,\" he said slowly, measuring the effect of his words, \"is thatevery human being on this earth seems to have exactly the same reactions, thesame thoughts, the same feelings. They seem to respond in more or less the sameway to the same stimuli. Those reactions seem to be sort of fogged up by thelanguage they speak, but if we scrape that off, they are exactly the samereactions that besiege every human being on Earth.\"I would like you to become curious about this, as a social scientist, ofcourse, and see if you could formally account for such homogeneity.\" Don Juan collected a series of plants. Some of them could hardly be seen. Theyseemed to be more in the realm of algae, moss. I held his bag open, and wedidn't speak anymore. When he had enough plants, he headed back for his house,walking as fast as he could. He said that he wanted to clean and separate thoseplants, and put them in a proper order before they dried up too much.I was deeply involved in thinking about the task he had delineated for me. Ibegan by trying to review in my mind if I knew of any articles or papers writtenon this subject. I thought that I would have to research it, and I decided tobegin my research by reading all the works available on 'national character'. Igot enthusiastic about the topic, in a haphazard way, and I really wanted tostart for home right away because I wanted to take his task to heart; but beforewe reached his house, don Juan sat down on a high ledge overlooking the valley.He didn't say anything for a while. He was not out of breath. I couldn'tconceive of why he had stopped to sit down.\"The task of the day for you,\" he said abruptly, in a foreboding tone, \"is oneof the most mysterious things of sorcery, something that goes beyond language;beyond explanations.\"We went for a hike today, and we talked because the mystery of sorcery must becushioned in the mundane. It must stem from nothing, and go back again tonothing. That's the art of warrior travelers; to go through the eye of a needleunnoticed.\"So, brace yourself by propping your back against this rock wall, as far aspossible from the edge. I will be by you, in case you faint or fall down.\"\"What are you planning to do, don Juan?\" I asked, and my alarm was so patentthat I noticed it, and lowered my voice.\"I want you to cross your legs, and enter into inner silence,\" he said. \"Let'ssay that you want to find out what articles you could look for to discredit orsubstantiate what I have asked you to do in your academic milieu. Enter intoinner silence, but don't fall asleep. This is not a journey through the dark seaof awareness. This is seeing from inner silence.\"It was rather difficult for me to enter into inner silence without fallingasleep. I fought a nearly invincible desire to fall asleep.I succeeded, and found myself looking at the bottom of the valley from animpenetrable darkness around me. And then, I saw something that chilled me tothe marrow of my bones. I saw a gigantic shadow, perhaps fifteen feet across,leaping in the air and then landing with a silent thud. I felt the thud in mybones, but I didn't hear it.\"They are really heavy,\" don Juan said in my ear. He was holding me by the leftarm, as hard as he could.I saw something that looked like a mud shadow wiggle on the ground, and thentake another gigantic leap, perhaps fifty feet long, and land again, with thesame ominous silent thud.I fought not to lose my concentration. I was frightened beyond anything I couldrationally use as a description. I kept my eyes fixed on the jumping shadow onthe bottom of the valley.Then I heard a most peculiar buzzing, a mixture of the sound of flapping wingsand the buzzing of a radio whose dial has not quite picked up the frequency of aradio station, and the thud that followed was something unforgettable. It shookdon Juan and me to the core- a gigantic black mud shadow had just landed by ourfeet.\"Don't be frightened,\" don Juan said imperiously. \"Keep your inner silence andit will move away.\"I was shivering from head to toe. I had the clear knowledge that if I didn'tkeep my inner silence alive, the mud shadow would cover me up like a blanket andsuffocate me.Without losing the darkness around me, I screamed at the top of my voice. Neverhad I been so angry, so utterly frustrated. The mud shadow took another leap,clearly to the bottom of the valley. I kept on screaming, shaking my legs. Iwanted to shake off whatever might come to eat me. My state of nervousness wasso intense that I lost track of time. Perhaps I fainted. When I came to my senses, I was lying in my bed in don Juan's house. There was atowel, soaked in icy-cold water, wrapped around my forehead. I was burning withfever. One of don Juan's female cohorts rubbed my back, chest, and forehead withrubbing alcohol, but this did not relieve me. The heat I was experiencing camefrom within myself. It was wrath and impotence that generated it.Don Juan laughed as if what was happening to me was the funniest thing in theworld. Peals of laughter came out of him in an endless barrage.\"I would never have thought that you would take seeing a flyer so much toheart,\" he said.He took me by the hand, and led me to the back of his house where he dunked mein a huge tub of water, fully clothed- shoes, watch, everything.\"My watch, my watch!\" I screamed.Don Juan twisted with laughter. \"You shouldn't wear a watch when you come to seeme,\" he said. \"Now you've fouled up your watch!\"I took off my watch, and put it by the side of the tub. I remembered that it waswaterproof and that nothing would happen to it.Being dunked in the tub helped me enormously. When don Juan pulled me out of thefreezing water, I had gained a degree of control.\"That sight is preposterous!\" I kept on repeating, unable to say anything else.The predator don Juan had described was not something benevolent. [* benevolent-intending or showing kindness] It was enormously heavy, gross, indifferent. Ifelt its disregard for us. Doubtless, it had crushed us ages ago, making us, asdon Juan had said, weak, vulnerable, and docile.I took off my wet clothes, covered myself with a poncho, sat in my bed, andveritably wept my head off; but not for myself. I had my wrath, and my unbendingintent not to let them eat me.I wept for my fellow men, especially for my father. I never knew until thatinstant that I loved him so much.\"He never had a chance,\" I heard myself repeating, over and over, as if thewords were not really mine. My poor father, the most considerate being I knew,so tender, so gentle, so helpless. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"Starting on the Definitive Journey"},{"pageContent":"The Jump into the AbyssThere was only one trail leading to the flat mesa. Once we were on the mesaitself, I realized that it was not as extensive as it had appeared when I hadlooked at it from a distance. The vegetation on the mesa was not different fromthe vegetation below: faded green woody shrubs that had the ambiguous appearanceof trees.At first, I didn't see the chasm. It was only when don Juan led me to it that Ibecame aware that the mesa ended in a precipice. It wasn't really a mesa, butmerely the flat top of a good-sized mountain. The mountain was round and erodedon its east and south faces. However, on part of its west and north sides, itseemed to have been cut with a knife. From the edge of the precipice, I was ableto see the bottom of the ravine, perhaps six hundred feet below. It was coveredwith the same woody shrubs that grew everywhere.A whole row of small mountains to the south and to the north of that mountaintopgave the clear impression that they had been part of a gigantic canyon, millionsof years old, dug out by a no longer existing river. The edges of that canyonhad been erased by erosion. At certain points they had been leveled with theground. The only portion still intact was the area where I was standing.\"It's solid rock,\" don Juan said as if he were reading my thoughts. He pointedwith his chin toward the bottom of the ravine. \"If anything were to fall downfrom this edge to the bottom, it would get smashed to flakes on the rock, downthere.\"This was the initial dialogue between don Juan and myself that day on thatmountaintop. Prior to going there, he had told me that his time on Earth hadcome to an end. He was leaving on his definitive journey.His statements were devastating to me. I truly lost my grip, and entered into ablissful state of fragmentation, perhaps similar to what people experience whenthey have a mental breakdown. But there was a core fragment of myself thatremained cohesive: the me of my childhood. The rest was vagueness, incertitude.I had been fragmented for so long that to become fragmented once again was theonly way out of my devastation.A most peculiar interplay between different levels of my awareness took placeafterward. Don Juan, his cohort don Genaro, two of his apprentices, Pablito andNestor, and I had climbed to that mountaintop. Pablito, Nestor, and I were thereto take care of our last task as apprentices: to jump into an abyss, a mostmysterious affair which don Juan had explained to me at various levels ofawareness, but which has remained an enigma [* enigma- something that bafflesunderstanding and cannot be explained] to me to this day.Don Juan jokingly said that I should get my writing pad and start taking notesabout our last moments together. He gently poked me in the ribs and assured me,as he hid his laughter, that it would have been only proper since I had startedon the warrior' travelers' path by taking notes.Don Genaro cut in and said that other warrior travelers before us had stood onthat same flat mountaintop before embarking on their journey to the unknown.Don Juan turned to me and in a soft voice said that soon I would be enteringinto infinity by the force of my personal power, and that he and don Genaro werethere only to bid me farewell. Don Genaro cut in again and said that I was therealso to do the same for them.\"Once you have entered into infinity,\" don Juan said, \"you can't depend on us tobring you back. Your decision is needed then. Only you can decide whether or notto return. I must also warn you that few warrior travelers survive this type ofencounter with infinity. Infinity is enticing beyond belief. A warrior travelerfinds that to return to the world of disorder, compulsion, noise, and pain is amost unappealing affair. You must know that your decision to stay or to returnis not a matter of a reasonable choice, but a matter of intending it.\"If you choose not to return,\" he continued, \"you will disappear as if the earthhad swallowed you. But if you choose to come back, you must tighten your beltand wait like a true warrior traveler until your task, whatever it might be, isfinished; either in success or in defeat.\"A very subtle change began to take place in my awareness then. I started toremember faces of people, but I wasn't sure I had met them. Strange feelings ofanguish and affection started to mount.Don Juan's voice was no longer audible. I longed for people I sincerely doubtedI had ever met. I was suddenly possessed by the most unbearable love for thosepersons, whoever they may have been. My feelings for them were beyond words, andyet I couldn't tell who they were. I only sensed their presence, as if I hadlived another life before, or as if I were feeling for people in a dream. Isensed that their outside forms shifted: They began by being tall and ended uppetite. What was left intact was their essence; the very thing that produced myunbearable longing for them.Don Juan came to my side and said to me, \"The agreement was that you remain inthe awareness of the daily world.\" His voice was harsh and authoritative. \"Todayyou are going to fulfill a concrete task,\" he went on, \"the last link of a longchain; and you must do it in your utmost mood of reason.\"I had never heard don Juan talk to me in that tone of voice. He was a differentman at that instant, yet he was thoroughly familiar to me. I meekly obeyed himand went back to the awareness of the world of everyday life. I didn't know thatI was doing this, however. To me, it appeared, on that day, as if I hadacquiesced to don Juan out of fear and respect.Don Juan spoke to me next in the tone I was accustomed to. What he said was alsovery familiar. He said that the backbone of a warrior traveler is humbleness andefficiency; acting without expecting anything, and withstanding anything thatlies ahead of him.I went at that point through another shift in my level of awareness. My mindfocused on a thought, or a feeling of anguish. I knew then that I had made apact with some people to die with them, and I couldn't remember who they were. Ifelt, without the shadow of a doubt, that it was wrong that I should die alone.My anguish became unbearable.Don Juan spoke to me. \"We are alone,\" he said. \"That's our condition, but to diealone is not to die in loneliness.\"I took big gulps of air to erase my tension. As I breathed deeply, my mindbecame clear.\"The great issue with us males is our frailty,\" he went on. \"When our awarenessbegins to grow, it grows like a column, right on the midpoint of our luminousbeing, from the ground up. That column has to reach a considerable height beforewe can rely on it.\"At this time in your life, as a sorcerer, you easily lose your grip on your newawareness. When you do that, you forget everything you have done and seen on thewarrior travelers' path because your consciousness shifts back to the awarenessof your everyday life.\"I have explained to you that the task of every male sorcerer is to reclaimeverything he has done and seen on the warrior travelers' path while he was onnew levels of awareness. The problem of every male sorcerer is that he easilyforgets because his awareness loses its new level and falls to the ground at thedrop of a hat.\"\"I understand exactly what you're saying, don Juan,\" I said.\"Perhaps this is the first time I have come to the full realization of why Iforget everything, and why I remember everything later. I have always believedthat my shifts were due to a personal pathological condition: I know now whythese changes take place, yet I can't verbalize what I know.\"\"Don't worry about verbalizations,\" don Juan said. \"You'll verbalize all youwant in due time. Today, you must act on your inner silence; on what you knowwithout knowing. You know to perfection what you have to do, but this knowledgeis not quite formulated in your thoughts yet.\"On the level of concrete thoughts or sensations, all I had were vague feelingsof knowing something that was not part of my mind. I had, then, the clearestsense of having taken a huge step down: Something seemed to have dropped insideme. It was almost a jolt. I knew that I had entered into another level ofawareness at that instant.Don Juan told me then that it is obligatory that a warrior traveler say good-byeto all the people he leaves behind. He must say his good-bye in a loud and clearvoice so that his shout and his feelings will remain forever recorded in thosemountains.I hesitated for a long time, not out of bashfulness, but because I didn't knowwhom to include in my thanks. I had completely internalized the sorcerers'concept that warrior travelers can't owe anything to anyone.Don Juan had drilled a sorcerers' axiom into me: \"Warrior travelers payelegantly, generously, and with unequaled ease every favor, every servicerendered to them. In this manner, they get rid of the burden of being indebted.\"I had paid, or I was in the process of paying, everyone who had honored me withtheir care or concern. I had recapitulated my life to such an extent that I hadnot left a single stone unturned. I truthfully believed in those days that Ididn't owe anything to anyone. I expressed my beliefs and hesitation to donJuan.Don Juan said that I had indeed recapitulated my life thoroughly, but he addedthat I was far from being free of indebtedness.\"How about your ghosts?\" he went on. \"Those you can no longer touch?\"He knew what he was talking about. During my recapitulation, I had recounted tohim every incident of my life. Out of the hundreds of incidents that I relatedto him, he had isolated three as samples of indebtedness that I incurred veryearly in life, and added to that, my indebtedness to the person who wasinstrumental in my meeting him. I had thanked my friend profusely, and I hadsensations that something out there acknowledged my thanks. The other three hadremained stories from my life; stories of people who had given me aninconceivable gift, and whom I had never thanked. One of these stories had to do with a man I'd known when I was a child. His namewas Mr. Leandro Acosta. He was my grandfather's arch-enemy; his true nemesis. [*nemesis- something causing misery or death]My grandfather had accused this man repeatedly of stealing chickens from hischicken farm. The man wasn't a vagrant, but someone who did not have a steady,definite job. He was a maverick of sorts, a gambler, a master of many trades:handyman, self-styled curer, hunter and provider of plant and insect specimensfor local herbalists and curers and any kind of bird or mammal life fortaxidermists or pet shops.People believed that he made tons of money, but that he couldn't keep it orinvest it. His detractors and friends alike believed that he could haveestablished the most prosperous business in the area, doing what he knew best-searching for plants and hunting animals- but that he was cursed with a strangedisease of the spirit that made him restless; incapable of tending to anythingfor any length of time.One day, while I was taking a stroll on the edge of my grandfather's farm, Inoticed that someone was watching me from between the thick bushes at theforest's edge. It was Mr. Acosta. He was squatting inside the bushes of thejungle itself. He would have been totally out of sight had it not been for mysharp eight year old eyes.\"No wonder my grandfather thinks that he comes to steal chickens,\" I thought. Ibelieved that no one else but me could have noticed him: He was utterlyconcealed by his motionlessness. I had caught the difference between the bushesand his silhouette by feeling rather than sight. I approached him. The fact thatpeople rejected him so viciously, or liked him so passionately, intrigued me noend.\"What are you doing there, Mr. Acosta?\" I asked daringly.\"I'm taking a shit while I look at your grandfather's farm,\" he said, \"so youbetter scram before I get up unless you like the smell of shit.\"I moved away a short distance. I wanted to know if he was really doing what hewas claiming. He was. He got up. I thought he was going to leave the bush andcome onto my grandfather's land and perhaps walk across to the road, but hedidn't. He began to walk inward, into the jungle.\"Hey, hey, Mr. Acosta!\" I yelled. \"Can I come with you?\"I noticed that he had stopped walking. It was again more a feeling than anactual sight because the bush was so thick.\"You can certainly come with me if you can find an entry into the bush,\" hesaid.That wasn't difficult for me. In my hours of idleness, I had marked an entryinto the bush with a good-sized rock. I had found out through an endless processof trial and error that there was a crawling space there, which if I followedfor three or four yards turned into an actual trail on which I could stand upand walk.Mr. Acosta came to me and said, \"Bravo, kid! You've done it. Yes, come with meif you want to.\"That was the beginning of my association with Mr. Leandro Acosta. We went ondaily hunting expeditions. Our association became so obvious- since I was gonefrom the house from dawn to sunset without anybody ever knowing where I went-that finally my grandfather admonished me severely.\"You must select your acquaintances,\" he said, \"or you will end up being likethem. I will not tolerate this man affecting you in any way imaginable. He couldcertainly transmit to you his elan, [* - a feeling of strong eagerness;distinctive and stylish elegance; enthusiastic and assured vigour andliveliness] yes. And he could influence your mind to be just like his: useless.I'm telling you, if you don't put an end to this, I will. I'll send theauthorities after him on charges of stealing my chickens, because you know damnwell that he comes every day and steals them.\"I tried to show my grandfather the absurdity of his charges. Mr. Acosta didn'thave to steal chickens. He had the vastness of that jungle at his command. Hecould have drawn from that jungle anything he wanted. But my argumentsinfuriated my grandfather even more.I realized then that my grandfather secretly envied Mr. Acosta's freedom, andMr. Acosta was transformed for me by this realization from a nice hunter intothe ultimate expression of what is at the same time both forbidden and desired.I attempted to curtail my encounters with Mr. Acosta, but the lure was just toooverwhelming for me. Then, one day, Mr. Acosta and three of his friends proposedthat I do something that Mr. Acosta had never done before: catch a vulturealive, uninjured.He explained to me that the vultures of the area, which were enormous with afive to six-foot wingspan, had seven different types of flesh in their bodies;and each one of those seven types served a specific curative purpose. He saidthat the desired state was that the vulture's body not be injured. The vulturehad to be killed by tranquilizer, not by violence. It was easy to shoot them,but in that case, the meat lost its curative value.So the art was to catch them alive, a thing that he had never done. He hadfigured out, though, that with my help and the help of his three friends he hadthe problem licked. He assured me that his was a natural conclusion arrived atafter hundreds of occasions on which he had observed the behavior of vultures.\"We need a dead donkey in order to perform this feat; something which we have,\"he declared ebulliently.He looked at me, waiting for me to ask the question of what would be done withthe dead donkey. Since the question was not asked, he proceeded.\"We remove the intestines, and we put some sticks in there to keep the roundnessof the belly.\"The leader of the turkey vultures is the king: He is the biggest; the mostintelligent,\" he went on. \"No sharper eyes exist. That's what makes him a king.He'll be the one who will spot the dead donkey, and the first who will land onit. He'll land downwind from the donkey to really smell that it is dead. Theintestines and soft organs that we are going to draw out of the donkey's bellywe'll pile by his rear end, outside. This way, it looks like a wild cat hasalready eaten some of it.\"Then, lazily, the vulture will come closer to the donkey. He'll take his time.He'll come hopping-flying, and then he will land on the dead donkey's hip andbegin to rock the donkey's body. He would turn it over if it were not for thefour sticks that we will stake into the ground as part of the armature. He'llstand on the hip for a while: That will be the clue for other vultures to comeand land there in the vicinity. Only when he has three or four of his companionsdown with him will the king vulture begin his work.\"\"And what is my role in all this, Mr. Acosta?\" I asked.\"You hide inside the donkey,\" he said with a deadpan expression. \"Nothing to it.I give you a pair of specially designed leather gloves, and you sit there andwait until the king turkey vulture rips the anus of the dead donkey open withhis enormous powerful beak and sticks his head in to begin eating. Then you grabhim by the neck with both hands and don't let go.\"My three friends and I will be hiding on horseback in a deep ravine. I'll bewatching the operation with binoculars. When I see that you have grabbed theking vulture by the neck, we'll come at full gallop and throw ourselves on topof the vulture and subdue him.\"\"Can you subdue that vulture, Mr. Acosta?\" I asked him. Not that I doubted hisskill, I just wanted to be assured.\"Of course I can!\" he said with all the confidence in the world. \"We're allgoing to be wearing gloves and leather leggings. The vulture's talons are quitepowerful. They could break a shinbone like a twig.\"There was no way out for me. I was caught; nailed by an exorbitant excitation.My admiration for Mr. Leandro Acosta knew no limits at that moment. I saw him asa true hunter; resourceful, cunning, knowledgeable.\"Okay, let's do it then!\" I said.\"That's my boy!\" said Mr. Acosta. \"I expected as much from you.\" He had put athick blanket behind his saddle, and one of his friends just lifted me up andput me on Mr. Acosta's horse, right behind the saddle, sitting on the blanket.\"Hold on to the saddle,\" Mr. Acosta said, \"and as you hold on to the saddle,hold the blanket, too.\"We took off at a leisurely trot. We rode for perhaps an hour until we came tosome flat, dry, desolate lands. We stopped by a tent that resembled a vendor'sstand in a market. It had a flat roof for shade. Underneath that roof was a deadbrown donkey. It didn't seem that old. It looked like an adolescent donkey.Neither Mr. Acosta nor his friends explained to me whether they had found orkilled the dead donkey. I waited for them to tell me, but I wasn't going to ask.While they made the preparations, Mr. Acosta explained that the tent was inplace because vultures were on the lookout from huge distances out there,circling very high, out of sight, but certainly capable of seeing everythingthat was going on.\"Those creatures are creatures of sight alone,\" Mr. Acosta said. \"They havemiserable ears, and their noses are not as good as their eyes. We have to plugevery hole of the carcass. I don't want you to be peeking out of any hole,because they will see your eye and never come down. They must see nothing.\"They put some sticks inside the donkey's belly and crossed them, leaving enoughroom for me to crawl in. At one moment I finally ventured the question that Iwas dying to ask.\"Tell me, Mr. Acosta, this donkey surely died of illness, didn't he? Do youthink its disease could affect me?\"Mr. Acosta raised his eyes to the sky. \"Come on! You cannot be that dumb.Donkey's diseases cannot be transmitted to man. Let's live this adventure andnot worry about stupid details. If I were shorter, I'd be inside that donkey'sbelly myself. Do you know what it is to catch the king of turkey buzzards?\"I believed him. His words were sufficient to set up a cloak of unequaledconfidence over me. I wasn't going to get sick and miss the event of events.The dreaded moment came when Mr. Acosta put me inside the donkey. Then theystretched the skin over the armature and began to sew it closed. They left,nevertheless, a large area open at the bottom, against the ground, for air tocirculate in. The horrendous moment for me came when the skin was finally closedover my head like the lid of a coffin. I breathed hard, thinking only about theexcitement of grabbing the king of vultures by the neck.Mr. Acosta gave me last minute instructions. He said that he would let me knowby a whistle that resembled a birdcall when the king vulture was flying aroundand when it had landed, so as to keep me informed and prevent me from frettingor getting impatient. Then I heard them pulling down the tent, followed by theirhorses galloping away. It was a good thing that they hadn't left a single spaceopen to look out from because that's what I would have done. The temptation tolook up and see what was going on was nearly irresistible.A long time went by in which I didn't think of anything. Then I heard Mr.Acosta's whistling and I presumed the king vulture was circling around. Mypresumption turned to certainty when I heard the flapping of powerful wings, andthen suddenly, the dead donkey's body began to rock as if it were in awindstorm. Then I felt a weight on the donkey's body, and I knew that the kingvulture had landed on the donkey and was not moving anymore. I heard theflapping of other wings and the whistling of Mr. Acosta in the distance. Then Ibraced myself for the inevitable. The body of the donkey began to shake assomething started to rip the skin.Then, suddenly, a huge, ugly head with a red crest, an enormous beak, and apiercing, open eye burst in. I yelled with fright and grabbed the neck with bothhands. I think I stunned the king vulture for an instant because he didn't doanything, which gave me the opportunity to grab his neck even harder, and thenall hell broke loose.He ceased to be stunned and began to pull with such force that I was smashedagainst the structure, and in the next instant I was partially out of thedonkey's body, armature and all, holding on to the neck of the invading beastfor dear life.I heard Mr. Acosta's galloping horse in the distance. I heard him yelling, \"Letgo, boy, let go, he's going to fly away with you!\"The king vulture indeed was going to either fly away with me holding on to hisneck or rip me apart with the force of his talons. The reason he couldn't reachme was because his head was sunk halfway into the viscera and the armature. Histalons kept slipping on the loose intestines and they never actually touched me.Another thing that saved me was that the force of the vulture was involved inpulling his neck out from my clasp and he could not move his talons far forwardenough to really injure me. The next thing I knew, Mr. Acosta had landed on topof the vulture at the precise moment that my leather gloves came off my hands.Mr. Acosta was beside himself with joy. \"We've done it, boy, we've done it!\" hesaid. \"The next time, we will have longer stakes on the ground that the vulturecannot yank out, and you will be strapped to the structure.\"My relationship with Mr. Acosta had lasted long enough for us to catch avulture. Then my interest in following him disappeared as mysteriously as it hadappeared and I never really had the opportunity to thank him for all the thingsthat he had taught me. Don Juan said that he had taught me the patience of a hunter at the best time tolearn it; and above all, he had taught me to draw from solitariness all thecomfort that a hunter needs.\"You cannot confuse solitude with solitariness,\" don Juan explained to me once.\"Solitude for me is psychological, of the mind. Solitariness is physical. One isdebilitating, the other comforting.\"For all this, don Juan had said, I was indebted to Mr. Acosta forever whether ornot I understood indebtedness the way warrior travelers understand it. The second person don Juan thought I was indebted to was a ten year old childI'd known growing up. His name was Armando Velez. Just like his name, he wasextremely dignified, and starchy; a little old man. I liked him very muchbecause he was firm and yet very friendly. He was someone who could not easilybe intimidated. He would fight anyone if he needed to, and yet he was not abully at all.The two of us used to go on fishing expeditions. We used to catch very smallfish that lived under rocks and had to be gathered by hand. We would put thetiny fish we caught to dry in the sun and eat them raw, all day sometimes.I also liked the fact that he was very resourceful and clever as well as beingambidextrous. He could throw a rock with his left hand farther than with hisright. We had endless competitive games in which, to my ultimate chagrin, healways won. He used to sort of apologize to me for winning by saying, \"If I slowdown and let you win, you'll hate me. It'll be an affront to your manhood. Sotry harder.\"Because of his excessively starchy behavior, we used to call him 'Senor Velez',but the 'Senor' was shortened to 'Sho', a custom typical of the region in SouthAmerica where I come from.One day, Sho Velez asked me something quite unusual. He began his request,naturally, as a challenge to me. \"I bet anything,\" he said, \"that I knowsomething that you wouldn't dare do.\"\"What are you talking about, Sho Velez?\"\"You wouldn't dare go down a river in a raft.\"\"Oh yes I would. I've done it in a flooded river. I got stranded on an islandfor eight days once. They had to drift food to me.\"This was the truth. My other best friend was a child nicknamed Crazy Shepherd.We got stranded in a flood on an island once; with no way for anyone to rescueus. Townspeople expected the flood to overrun the island and kill us both. Theydrifted baskets of food down the river in the hope that they would land on theisland, which they did. They kept us alive in this fashion until the water hadsubsided enough for them to reach us with a raft and pull us to the banks of theriver.\"No, this is a different affair,\" Sho Velez continued with his erudite [*erudite- having or showing profound knowledge] attitude. \"This one implies goingon a raft on a subterranean river.\"He pointed out that a huge section of a local river went through a mountain.That subterranean section of the river had always been a most intriguing placefor me. Its entrance into the mountain was a foreboding cave of considerablesize, always filled with bats and smelling of ammonia. Children of the area weretold that it was the entrance to hell: sulfur fumes, heat, stench.\"You bet your friggin' boots, Sho Velez, that I will never go near that river inmy lifetime!\" I said, yelling. \"Not in ten lifetimes! You have to be reallycrazy to do something like that.\"Sho Velez's serious face got even more solemn. \"Oh,\" he said, \"then I will haveto do it all by myself. I thought for a minute that I could goad you into goingwith me. I was wrong. My loss.\"\"Hey, Sho Velez, what's with you? Why in the world would you go into thathellish place?\"\"I have to,\" he said in his gruff little voice. \"You see, my father is as crazyas you are, except that he is a father and a husband. He has six people whodepend on him. Otherwise, he would be as crazy as a goat. My two sisters, my twobrothers, my mother and I depend on him. He is everything to us.\"I didn't know who Sho Velez's father was. I had never seen him. I didn't knowwhat he did for a living. Sho Velez revealed that his father was a businessman,and that everything that he owned was on the line, so to speak.\"My father has constructed a raft and wants to go. He wants to make thatexpedition. My mother says that he's just letting off steam, but I don't trusthim,\" Sho Velez continued. \"I have seen your crazy look in his eyes. One ofthese days, he'll do it, and I am sure that he'll die. So, I am going to takehis raft and go into that river myself. I know that I will die, but my fatherwon't.\"I felt something like an electric shock go through my neck, and I heard myselfsaying in the most agitated tone one can imagine, \"I'll do it, Sho Velez, I'lldo it. Yes, yes, it'll be great! I'll go with you!\"Sho Velez had a smirk on his face. I understood it as a smirk of happiness atthe fact that I was going with him, not at the fact that he had succeeded inluring me. He expressed that feeling in his next sentence. \"I know that if youare with me, I will survive,\" he said.I didn't care whether Sho Velez survived or not. What had galvanized me was hiscourage. I knew that Sho Velez had the guts to do what he was saying. He andCrazy Shepherd were the only gutsy kids in town. They both had something that Iconsidered unique and unheard of: courage. No one else in that whole town hadany. I had tested them all. As far as I was concerned, every one of them wasdead, including the love of my life, my grandfather. I knew this without theshadow of a doubt when I was ten. Sho Velez's daring was a staggeringrealization for me. I wanted to be with him to the bitter end.We made plans to meet at the crack of dawn, which we did, and the two of uscarried his father's lightweight raft for three or four miles out of town, intosome low, green mountains to the entrance of the cave where the river becamesubterranean. The smell of bat manure was overwhelming. We crawled on the raftand pushed ourselves into the stream. The raft was equipped with flashlights,which we had to turn on immediately. It was pitch black inside the mountain andhumid and hot. The water was deep enough for the raft and fast enough that wedidn't need to paddle.The flashlights would create grotesque shadows. Sho Velez whispered in my earthat perhaps it was better not to look at all, because it was truly somethingmore than frightening. He was right; it was nauseating, oppressive. The lightsstirred bats so that they began to fly around us, flapping their wingsaimlessly. As we traveled deeper into the cave, there were not even batsanymore, just stagnant air that was heavy and hard to breathe. After what seemedlike hours to me, we came to a sort of pool where the water was very deep: Ithardly moved. It looked as if the main stream had been dammed.\"We are stuck,\" Sho Velez whispered in my ear again. \"There's no way for theraft to go through, and there's no way for us to go back.\"The current was just too great for us to even attempt a return trip. We decidedthat we had to find a way out. I realized then that if we stood on top of theraft, we could touch the ceiling of the cave, which meant that the water hadbeen dammed almost all the way to the top of the cave. At the entrance it wascathedral-like, maybe fifty feet high. My only conclusion was that we were ontop of a pool that was about fifty feet deep.We tied the raft to a rock and began to swim downward into the depths, trying tofeel for a movement of water, a current. Everything was humid and hot on thesurface but very cold a few feet below. My body felt the change in temperatureand I became frightened; a strange animal fear that I had never felt before. Isurfaced. Sho Velez must have felt the same. We bumped into each other on thesurface.\"I think we're close to dying,\" he said solemnly.I didn't share his solemnity or his desire to die. I searched frantically for anopening. Floodwaters must have carried rocks that had created a dam. I found ahole big enough for my ten-year-old body to go through. I pulled Sho Velez downand showed the hole to him. It was impossible for the raft to go through it. Wepulled our clothes from the raft and tied them into a very tight bundle and swamdownward with them until we found the hole again and went through it.We ended up on a water slide, like the ones in an amusement park. Rocks coveredwith lichen and moss allowed us to slide for a great distance without beinginjured at all. Then we came into an enormous cathedral-like cave, where thewater continued flowing, waist deep. We saw the light of the sky at the end ofthe cave and waded out. Without saying a word, we spread out our clothes and letthem dry in the sun, then headed back for town. Sho Velez was nearlyinconsolable because he had lost his father's raft.\"My father would have died there,\" he finally conceded. \"His body would neverhave gone through the hole we went through. He's too big for it. My father is abig, fat man,\" he said. \"But he would have been strong enough to walk his wayback to the entrance.\"I doubted it. As I remembered, at times, due to the inclination, the current wasastoundingly fast. I conceded that perhaps a desperate, big man could havefinally walked his way out with the aid of ropes and a lot of effort.The issue of whether Sho Velez's father would have died there or not was notresolved then, but that didn't matter to me. What mattered was that for thefirst time in my life I had felt the sting of envy. Sho Velez was the only beingI have ever envied in my life. He had someone to die for, and he had proved tome that he would do it: I had no one to die for, and I had proved nothing atall.In a symbolic fashion, I gave Sho Velez the total cake. His triumph wascomplete. I bowed out. That was his town, those were his people, and he was thebest among them as far as I was concerned. When we parted that day, I spoke abanality that turned out to be a deep truth when I said, \"Be the king of them,Sho Velez. You are the best.\"I never spoke to him again. I purposely ended my friendship with him. I feltthat this was the only gesture I could make to denote how profoundly I had beenaffected by him. Don Juan believed that my indebtedness to Sho Velez was imperishable, that hewas the only one who had ever taught me that we must have something we could diefor before we could think that we have something to live for.\"If you have nothing to die for,\" don Juan said to me once, \"how can you claimthat you have something to live for? The two go hand in hand, with death at thehelm.\"The third person don Juan thought I was indebted to beyond my life and my deathwas my grandmother on my mother's side. In my blind affection for mygrandfather- the male- I had forgotten the real source of strength in thathousehold: my very eccentric grandmother.Many years before I came to their household, she had saved a local Indian frombeing lynched. He had been accused of being a sorcerer. Some irate young menwere actually hanging him from a tree on my grandmother's property. She cameupon the lynching and stopped it. All the lynchers seemed to have been hergodsons and they wouldn't dare go against her. She pulled the man down and tookhim home to cure him. The rope had already cut a deep wound on his neck.His wounds healed, but he never left my grandmother's side. He claimed that hislife had ended the day of the lynching, and that whatever new life he had nolonger belonged to him: It belonged to her. Being a man of his word, hededicated his life to serving my grandmother. He was her valet, major-domo, [*'major-domo'- the chief steward or butler of a great household] and counselor.My aunts said that it was he who had advised my grandmother to adopt a newbornorphan child as her son, something that they resented more than bitterly. When Icame into my grandparents' house, my grandmother's adopted son was already inhis late thirties; and she had sent him to study in France.One afternoon, out of the blue, a most elegantly dressed husky man got out of ataxi in front of the house. The driver carried his leather suitcases to thepatio. The husky man tipped the driver generously.I noticed in one glance that the husky man's features were very striking. He hadlong, curly hair, long, curly eyelashes. He was extremely handsome without beingphysically beautiful. His best feature was, however, his beaming, open smile,which he immediately turned on me.\"May I ask your name, young man?\" he said with the most beautiful stage voice Ihad ever heard.The fact that he had addressed me as young man had won me over instantly. \"Myname is Carlos Aranha, sir,\" I said, \"and may I ask in turn, what is yours?\"He made a gesture of mock surprise. He opened his eyes wide and jumped backwardas if he had been attacked. Then he began to laugh uproariously.At the sound of his laughter, my grandmother came out to the patio. When she sawthe husky man, she screamed like a small girl and threw her arms around him in amost affectionate embrace. He lifted her up as if she weighed nothing andtwirled her around. I noticed then that he was very tall. His huskiness hid hisheight. He actually had the body of a professional fighter. He seemed to noticethat I was eyeing him. He flexed his biceps.\"I've done some boxing in my day, sir,\" he said, thoroughly aware of what I wasthinking.My grandmother introduced him to me. She said that he was her son Antoine; herbaby; the apple of her eye. She said that he was a dramatist; a theaterdirector; a writer; a poet.The fact that he was so athletic was his winning ticket with me.I didn't understand at first that he was adopted. I noticed, however, that hedidn't look at all like the rest of the family. While every one of the membersof my family were corpses that walked, he was alive; vital from the inside out.We hit it off marvelously. I liked the fact that he worked out every day,punching a bag. I liked immensely that, not only did he punch the bag, he kickedit, too, in the most astounding style; a mixture of boxing and kicking. His bodywas as hard as a rock.One day Antoine confessed to me that his only fervent desire in life was to be awriter of note.\"I have everything,\" he said. \"Life has been very generous to me. The only thingI don't have is the only thing I want: talent. The muses do not like me. Iappreciate what I read, but I cannot create anything that I like to read. That'smy torment; I lack the discipline or the charm to entice the muses, so my lifeis as empty as anything can be.\"Antoine went on to tell me that the one reality that he had was his mother. Hecalled my grandmother his bastion, [* bastion- a group that defends a principle;a stronghold into which people could go for shelter during a battle] hissupport, his twin soul. He ended up by voicing a very disturbing thought to me.He said, \"If I didn't have my mother, I wouldn't live.\"I realized then how profoundly tied he was to my grandmother. All the horrorstories that my aunts had told me about the spoiled child Antoine becamesuddenly very vivid for me. My grandmother had really spoiled him beyondsalvation.Yet they seemed so very happy together. I saw them sitting for hours on end; hishead on her lap as if he were still a child. I had never heard my grandmotherconverse with anybody for such lengths of time.Abruptly, one day Antoine started to produce a lot of writing. He began todirect a play at the local theater, a play that he had written himself. When itwas staged, it became an instant success. His poems were published in the localpaper. He seemed to have hit a creative streak.But only a few months later it all came to an end. The editor of the town'spaper publicly denounced Antoine: He accused him of plagiarism and published inthe paper the proof of Antoine's guilt.My grandmother, of course, would not hear of her son's misbehavior. Sheexplained it all as a case of profound envy. Every one of those people in thattown was envious of the elegance; the style of her son. They were envious of hispersonality; of his wit. Indeed, he was the personification of elegance andsavoir faire.But he was a plagiarist for sure. There was no doubt about it.Antoine never explained his behavior to anyone. I liked him too much to ask himanything about it. Besides, I didn't care. His reasons were his reasons, as faras I was concerned.But something was broken: From then on, our lives moved in leaps and bounds, soto speak. Things changed so drastically in the house from one day to the nextthat I grew accustomed to expect anything; the best or the worst.One night my grandmother walked into Antoine's room in a most dramatic fashion.There was a look of hardness in her eyes that I had never seen before. Her lipstrembled as she spoke.\"Something terrible has happened, Antoine,\" she began.Antoine interrupted her. He begged her to let him explain.She cut him off abruptly. \"No, Antoine, no,\" she said firmly. \"This has nothingto do with you. It has to do with me. At this very difficult time for you,something of greater importance yet has happened. Antoine, my dear son, I haverun out of time.\"I want you to understand that this is inevitable,\" she went on. \"I have toleave, but you must remain. You are the sum total of everything that I have donein this life. Good or bad, Antoine, you are all I am. Give life a try. In theend, we will be together again anyway. Meanwhile, however, 'do', Antoine: Do.Whatever, it doesn't matter what, as long as you do.\"I saw Antoine's body as it shivered with anguish. I saw how he contracted histotal being; all the muscles of his body; all his strength. It was as if he hadshifted gears from his problem, which was like a river, to the ocean.\"Promise me that you won't die until you die!\" she shouted at him.Antoine nodded his head.My grandmother, the next day, on the advice of her Indian sorcerer counselor,sold all her holdings, which were quite sizable, and turned the money over toher son Antoine. And the following day, very early in the morning, the strangestscene that I had ever witnessed took place in front of my ten year old eyes; themoment in which Antoine said good-bye to his mother. It was a scene as unreal asthe set of a moving picture; unreal in the sense that it seemed to have beenconcocted; written down somewhere; created by a series of adjustments that awriter makes and a director carries out.The patio of my grandparents' house was the setting. Antoine was the mainprotagonist; his mother the leading actress. Antoine was traveling that day. Hewas going to the port. He was going to catch an Italian liner and go over theAtlantic to Europe on a leisurely cruise. He was as elegantly dressed as ever. Ataxi driver was waiting for him outside the house, blowing the horn of his taxiimpatiently. I had witnessed Antoine's last feverish night when he tried as desperately asanyone can try to write a poem for his mother.\"It is crap,\" he said to me. \"Everything that I write is crap. I'm a nobody.\"I assured him, even though I was nobody to assure him, that whatever he waswriting was great. At one moment, I got carried away and stepped over certainboundaries I should never have crossed.\"Take it from me, Antoine,\" I yelled. \"I am a worse nobody than you! You have amother. I have nothing. Whatever you are writing is fine.\"Very politely, he asked me to leave his room. I had succeeded in making him feelstupid; having to listen to advice from a nobody kid. I bitterly regretted myoutburst. I would have liked him to keep on being my friend. Antoine had his elegant overcoat neatly folded, draped over his right shoulder.He was wearing a most beautiful green suit of English cashmere.My grandmother spoke. \"You have to hurry up, dear,\" she said. \"Time is of theessence. You have to leave. If you don't, these people will kill you for themoney.\"She was referring to her daughters, and their husbands, who were beyond furywhen they found out that their mother had quietly disinherited them; and thatthe hideous Antoine, their arch-enemy, was going to get away with everythingthat was rightfully theirs.\"I'm sorry I have to put you through all this,\" my grandmother apologized. \"But,as you know, time is independent of our wishes.\"Antoine spoke with his grave, beautifully modulated voice. He sounded more thanever like a stage actor. \"It'll take but a minute, Mother,\" he said. \"I'd liketo read something that I have written for you.\"It was a poem of thanks. When he had finished reading, he paused. There was sucha wealth of feeling in the air; such a tremor.\"It was sheer beauty, Antoine,\" my grandmother said, sighing. \"It expressedeverything that you wanted to say. Everything that I wanted to hear.\" She pausedfor an instant. Then her lips broke into an exquisite smile.\"Plagiarized, Antoine?\" she asked.Antoine's smile in response to his mother was equally beaming. \"Of course,Mother,\" he said. \"Of course.\"They embraced, weeping. The horn of the taxi sounded more impatient yet. Antoinelooked at me where I was hiding under the stairway. He nodded his head slightly,as if to say, \"Good-bye. Take care.\"Then he turned around, and without looking at his mother again, he ran towardthe door. He was thirty-seven years old, but he looked like he was sixty, heseemed to carry such a gigantic weight on his shoulders. He stopped before hereached the door, when he heard his mother's voice admonishing him for the lasttime.\"Don't turn around to look, Antoine,\" she said. \"Don't turn around to look,ever. Be happy, and do. Do! There is the trick. Do!\"The scene filled me with a strange sadness that lasts to this day; a mostinexplicable melancholy that don Juan explained as my first-time knowledge thatwe do run out of time.The next day my grandmother left with her 'counselor/ manservant/ valet' on ajourney to a mythical place called Rondonia, where her sorcerer-helper was goingto elicit her cure. My grandmother was terminally ill, although I didn't knowit.She never returned, and don Juan explained the selling of her holdings andgiving them to Antoine as a supreme sorcerers' maneuver executed by hercounselor to detach her from the care of her family. They were so angry withMother for her deed that they didn't care whether or not she returned. I had thefeeling that they didn't even realize that she had left. On the top of that flat mountain, I recollected those three events as if theyhad happened only an instant before. When I expressed my thanks to those threepersons, I succeeded in bringing them back to that mountaintop. At the end of myshouting, my loneliness was something inexpressible. I was weepinguncontrollably.Don Juan very patiently explained to me that loneliness is inadmissible in awarrior. He said that warrior travelers can count on one being on which they canfocus all their love; all their care: this marvelous Earth, the mother, thematrix, the epicenter of everything we are and everything we do; the very beingto which all of us return; the very being that allows warrior travelers to leaveon their definitive journey.Don Genaro proceeded to perform then an act of magical intent for my benefit.Lying on his stomach, he executed a series of dazzling movements. He became ablob of luminosity that seemed to be swimming as if the ground were a pool.Don Juan said that it was Genaro's way of hugging the immense earth, and that inspite of the difference in size, the earth acknowledged Genaro's gesture. Thesight of Genaro's movements, and the explanation of them replaced my lonelinesswith sublime joy.\"I can't stand the idea that you are leaving, don Juan,\" I heard myself saying.The sound of my voice and what I had said made me feel embarrassed. When I beganto sob, involuntarily, driven by self-pity, I felt even more chagrined. \"What isthe matter with me, don Juan?\" I muttered. \"I'm not ordinarily like this.\"\"What's happening to you is that your awareness is on your toes again,\" hereplied, laughing.Then I lost any vestige of control and gave myself fully to my feelings ofdejection and despair.\"I'm going to be left alone,\" I said in a shrieking voice. \"What's going tohappen to me? What's going to become of me?\"\"Let's put it this way,\" don Juan said calmly. \"In order for me to leave thisworld and face the unknown, I need all my strength, all my forbearance, all myluck; but above all, I need every bit of a warrior traveler's guts of steel. Toremain behind and fare like a warrior traveler, you need everything of what Imyself need. To venture out there, the way we are going to, is no joking matter;but neither is it to stay behind.\"I had an emotional outburst, and kissed his hand.\"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\" he said. \"Next thing you're going to make a shrine for myguaraches!\"The anguish that gripped me turned from self-pity to a feeling of unequaledloss. \"You are leaving!\" I muttered. \"My god! Leaving forever!\"At that moment don Juan did something to me that he had done repeatedly sincethe first day I had met him. His face puffed up as if the deep breath he wastaking inflated him. He tapped my back forcefully with the palm of his left handand said, \"Get up from your toes! Lift yourself up!\"In the next instant, I was once again coherent, complete, in control. I knewwhat was expected of me. There was no longer any hesitation on my part, or anyconcern about myself. I didn't care what was going to happen to me when don Juanleft. I knew that his departure was imminent. He looked at me, and in that lookhis eyes said it all.\"We will never be together again,\" he said softly. \"You don't need my helpanymore; and I don't want to offer it to you because if you are worth your saltas a warrior traveler, you'll spit in my eye for offering it to you.\"Beyond a certain point, the only joy of a warrior traveler is his aloneness. Iwouldn't like you to try to help me either. Once I leave, I am gone. Don't thinkabout me, for I won't think about you. If you are a worthy warrior traveler, beimpeccable! Take care of your world. Honor it: Guard it with your life!\"He moved away from me. The moment was beyond self-pity or tears or happiness. Heshook his head as if to say good-bye, or as if he were acknowledging what Ifelt.\"Forget the self and you will fear nothing in whatever level of awareness youfind yourself to be,\" he said.He had an outburst of levity. He teased me for the last time on this Earth.\"I hope you find love!\" he said.He raised his palm toward me and stretched his fingers like a child, thencontracted them against the palm.\"Ciao,\" he saidI knew that it was futile to feel sorry or to regret anything; and that it wasas difficult for me to stay behind as it was for don Juan to leave. Both of uswere caught in an irreversible energetic maneuver that neither of us could stop.Nevertheless, I wanted to join don Juan, follow him wherever he went. Thethought crossed my mind that perhaps if I died, he would take me with him.I saw then how don Juan Matus, the nagual, led the fifteen other seers who werehis companions- his wards, his delight- one by one to disappear in the haze ofthat mesa toward the north.I saw how every one of them turned into a blob of luminosity, and together theyascended and floated above the mountaintop like phantom lights in the sky. Theycircled above the mountain once, as don Juan had said they would do: their lastsurvey; the one for their eyes only; their last look at this marvelous Earth.And then they vanished.I knew what I had to do. I had run out of time. I took off at my top speedtoward the precipice and leaped into the abyss. I felt the wind on my face for amoment, and then the most merciful blackness swallowed me like a peacefulsubterranean river. ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"The Return TripI was vaguely aware of the loud noise of a motor that seemed to be racing in astationary position. I thought that the attendants were fixing a car in theparking lot at the back of the building where I had my office/apartment. Thenoise became so intense that it finally caused me to wake up.I silently cursed the boys who ran the parking lot for fixing their car rightunder my bedroom window. I was hot, sweaty, and tired. I sat up on the edge ofmy bed, then had the most painful cramps in my calves. I rubbed them for amoment. They seemed to have contracted so tightly that I was afraid that I wouldhave horrendous bruises.I automatically headed for the bathroom to look for some liniment. I couldn'twalk. I was dizzy. I fell down; something that had never happened to me before.When I had regained a minimum of control, I noticed that I wasn't worried at allabout the cramps in my calves. I had always been a near hypochondriac. Anunusual pain in my calves such as the one I was having now would ordinarily havethrown me into a chaotic state of anxiety.I went then to the window to close it, although I couldn't hear the noiseanymore. I realized that the window was locked and that it was dark outside. Itwas night! The room was stuffy.I opened the windows. I couldn't understand why I had closed them. The night airwas cool and fresh. The parking lot was empty. It occurred to me that the noisemust have been made by a car accelerating in the alley between the parking lotand my building. I thought nothing of it anymore, and went to my bed to go backto sleep, I lay across it with my feet on the floor. I wanted to sleep in thisfashion to help the circulation in my calves, which were very sore, but I wasn'tsure whether it would have been better to keep them down, or perhaps lift themup on a pillow.As I was beginning to rest comfortably and fall asleep again, a thought came tomy mind with such ferocious force that it made me stand up in one single reflex.I had jumped into an abyss in Mexico! The next thought that I had was aquasi-logical deduction: Since I had jumped into the abyss deliberately in orderto die, I must now be a ghost.How strange, I thought, that I should return, in ghostlike form, to myoffice/apartment on the corner of Westwood and Wilshire in Los Angeles after Ihad died. No wonder my feelings were not the same. But if I were a ghost, Ireasoned, why would I have felt the blast of fresh air on my face, or the painin my calves?I touched the sheets of my bed: They felt real to me. So did its metal frame. Iwent to the bathroom. I looked at myself in the mirror.By the looks of me, I could easily have been a ghost. I looked like hell. Myeyes were sunken, with huge black circles under them. I was dehydrated, or dead.In an automatic reaction, I drank water straight from the tap. I could actuallyswallow it. I drank gulp after gulp, as if I hadn't drunk water for days.I felt my deep inhalations. I was alive! By god, I was alive! I knew it beyondthe shadow of a doubt, but I wasn't elated, as I should have been.A most unusual thought crossed my mind then: I had died and revived before. Iwas accustomed to it: It meant nothing to me. The vividness of the thought,however, made it into a quasi-memory. It was a quasi-memory that didn't stemfrom situations in which my life had been endangered. It was something quitedifferent from that.It was, rather, a vague knowledge of something that could never have happened,and had no reason whatsoever to be in my thoughts.And yet, there was no doubt in my mind that I had jumped into an abyss inMexico. I was now in my apartment in Los Angeles, over three thousand miles fromwhere I had jumped, with no recollection whatsoever of having made the returntrip.In an automatic fashion, I ran the water in the tub and sat in it. I didn't feelthe warmth of the water: I was chilled to the bone. Don Juan had taught me thatat moments of crisis, such as this one, one must use running water as acleansing factor. I remembered this and got under the shower. I let the warmwater run over my body for perhaps over an hour.I wanted to think calmly and rationally about what was happening to me but Icouldn't. Thoughts seemed to have been erased from my mind. I was thoughtlessyet I was filled to capacity with sensations that came to my whole body inbarrages that I was incapable of examining. All I was able to do was to feeltheir onslaughts and let them go through me.The only conscious choice I made was to get dressed and leave. I went to eatbreakfast; something I always did at any time of the day or night, at Ship'sRestaurant on Wilshire, a block away from my office/apartment.I had walked from my office to Ship's so many times that I knew every step ofthe way. The same walk this time was a novelty for me. I didn't feel my steps.It was as if I had a cushion under my feet, or as if the sidewalk were carpeted.I practically glided.I was suddenly at the door of the restaurant after what I thought might havebeen only two or three steps. I knew that I could swallow food because I haddrunk water in my apartment. I also knew that I could talk because I had clearedmy throat and cursed while the water ran on me. I walked into the restaurant asI had always done. I sat at the counter and a waitress who knew me came to me.\"You don't look too good today, dear,\" she said. \"Do you have the flu?\"\"No,\" I replied, trying to sound cheerful. \"I've been working too hard. I'vebeen up for twenty-four hours straight writing a paper for a class. By the way,what day is today?\"She looked at her watch and gave me the date, explaining that she had a specialwatch that was a calendar, too, a gift from her daughter. She also gave me thetime: 3:15 A.M.I ordered steak and eggs, hash browned potatoes, and buttered white toast. Whenshe went away to fill my order, another wave of horror flooded my mind: Had itbeen only an illusion that I had jumped into that abyss in Mexico, at twilightthe previous day? But even if the jump had been only an illusion, how could Ihave returned to L.A. from such a remote place only ten hours later? Had I sleptfor ten hours? Or was it that it had taken ten hours for me to fly, slide,float, or whatever to Los Angeles? To have traveled by conventional means to LosAngeles from the place where I had jumped into the abyss was out of thequestion, since it would have taken two days just to travel to Mexico City fromthe place where I had jumped.Another strange thought emerged in my mind. It had the same clarity of myquasi-memory of having died and revived before; and the same quality of beingtotally foreign to me: My continuity was now broken beyond repair.I had really died, one way or another, at the bottom of that gully. It wasimpossible to comprehend my being alive; having breakfast at Ship's. It wasimpossible for me to look back into my past and see the uninterrupted line ofcontinuous events that all of us see when we look into the past.The only explanation available to me was that I had followed don Juan'sdirectives; I had moved my assemblage point to a position that prevented mydeath, and from my inner silence I had made the return journey to L.A. There wasno other rationale for me to hold on to.For the first time ever, this line of thought was thoroughly acceptable to me,and thoroughly satisfactory. It didn't really explain anything, but it certainlypointed out a pragmatic procedure that I had tested before in a mild form when Imet don Juan in that town of our choice; and this thought seemed to put all mybeing at ease.Vivid thoughts began to emerge in my mind. They had the unique quality ofclarifying issues. The first one that erupted had to do with something that hadplagued me all along. Don Juan had described it as a common occurrence amongmale sorcerers: my incapacity to remember events that had transpired while I wasin states of heightened awareness.Don Juan had explained heightened awareness as a minute displacement of myassemblage point, which he achieved, every time I saw him, by actually pushingforcefully on my back. He helped me, with such displacements, to engage energyfields that were ordinarily peripheral to my awareness.In other words, the energy fields that were usually on the edge of my assemblagepoint became central to it during that displacement. A displacement of thisnature had two consequences for me: an extraordinary keenness of thought andperception; and the incapacity to remember, once I was back in my normal stateof awareness, what had transpired while I had been in that other state.My relationship with my cohorts had been an example of both of theseconsequences. I had cohorts; don Juan's other apprentices; companions for mydefinitive journey. I interacted with them only in heightened awareness. Theclarity and scope of our interaction was supreme.The drawback for me was that in my daily life they were only poignantquasi-memories that drove me to desperation with anxiety and expectations. Icould say that I lived my normal life on the perennial lookout for somebody whowas going to appear all of a sudden in front of me; perhaps emerging from anoffice building; perhaps turning a corner and bumping into me. Wherever I went,my eyes darted everywhere, ceaselessly and involuntarily, looking for people whodidn't exist and yet existed like no one else.While I sat at Ship's that morning, everything that had happened to me inheightened awareness, to the most minute detail, in all the years with don Juanbecame again a continuous memory without interruption.Don Juan had lamented that a male sorcerer, who is the nagual, perforce had tobe fragmented because of the bulk of his energetic mass. He said that in eachfragment lived a specific range of a total scope of activity; and the eventsthat the male sorcerer had experienced in each fragment had to be joined somedayto give a complete, conscious picture of everything that had taken place in histotal life.Looking into my eyes, he had told me that that unification takes years toaccomplish, and that he had been told of cases of naguals who never reached thetotal scope of their activities in a conscious manner, and lived fragmented.What I experienced that morning at Ship's was beyond anything I could haveimagined in my wildest fantasies. Don Juan had said to me time after time thatthe world of sorcerers was not an immutable world, where the word is final, andunchanging; but that it's a world of eternal fluctuation where nothing should betaken for granted.The jump into the abyss had modified my cognition so drastically that it allowednow the entrance of possibilities both portentous and indescribable.But anything that I could have said about the unification of my cognitivefragments would have paled in comparison to the reality of it. That fatefulmorning at Ship's, I experienced something infinitely more potent than I did theday that I saw energy as it flows in the universe for the first time- the daythat after having been on the campus of UCLA, I ended up in the bed of myoffice/apartment without actually going home in the fashion my cognitive systemdemanded in order for the whole event to be real.In Ship's, I integrated all the fragments of my being. I had acted in each oneof them with perfect certainty and consistency, and yet I had had no idea that Ihad done that. I was, in essence, a gigantic puzzle, and to fit each piece ofthat puzzle into place produced an effect that had no name.I sat at the counter at Ship's, perspiring profusely, pondering uselessly, andobsessively asking questions that couldn't be answered: How could all this bepossible? How could I have been fragmented in such a fashion? Who are we really?Certainly not the people all of us have been led to believe we are. I hadmemories of events that had never happened, as far as some core of myself wasconcerned. I couldn't even weep.\"A sorcerer weeps when he is fragmented,\" don Juan had said to me once. \"Whenhe's complete, he's taken by a shiver that has the potential, because it is sointense, of ending his life.\"I was experiencing such a shiver! I doubted that I would ever meet my cohortsagain. It appeared to me that all of them had left with don Juan. I was alone.I wanted to think about it; to mourn my loss; to plunge into a satisfyingsadness the way I had always done. I couldn't. There was nothing to mourn;nothing to feel sad about. Nothing mattered. All of us were warrior travelers,and all of us had been swallowed by infinity.All along, I had listened to don Juan talk about the warrior traveler. I hadliked the description immensely, and I had identified with it on a purelyemotional basis. Yet I had never felt what he really meant by that, regardlessof how many times he had explained his meaning to me.That night, at the counter of Ship's, I knew what don Juan had been talkingabout. I was a warrior traveler. Only energetic facts were meaningful for me.All the rest were trimmings that had no importance at all.That night, while I sat waiting for my food, another vivid thought erupted in mymind. I felt a wave of empathy, a wave of identification with don Juan'spremises. I had finally reached the goal of his teachings: I was one with him asI had never been before.It had never been the case that I had been just fighting don Juan or hisconcepts, which were revolutionary for me because they didn't fulfill thelinearity of my thoughts as a Western man.Rather, it was that don Juan's precision in presenting his concepts had alwaysscared me half to death. His efficiency had appeared to be dogmatism. It wasthat appearance that had forced me to seek elucidations, and had made me act,all along, as if I had been a reluctant believer.Yes, I had jumped into an abyss, I said to myself, and I didn't die becausebefore I reached the bottom of that gully I let the dark sea of awarenessswallow me. I surrendered to it without fears or regrets. And that dark sea hadsupplied me with whatever was necessary for me not to die, and to end up in mybed in L.A. This explanation would have explained nothing to me two days before.At three in the morning, in Ship's, it meant everything to me.I banged my hand on the table as if I were alone in the room. People looked atme and smiled knowingly. I didn't care.My mind was focused on an insoluble dilemma: I was alive despite the fact that Ihad jumped into an abyss in order to die ten hours before. I knew that such adilemma could never be resolved. My normal cognition required a linearexplanation in order to be satisfied, and linear explanations were not possible.That was the crux of the interruption of continuity. Don Juan had said that thatinterruption was sorcery. I knew this now, as clearly as I was capable of.How right don Juan had been when he had said that in order for me to staybehind, I needed all my strength, all my forbearance, and above all, a warriortraveler's guts of steel.I wanted to think about don Juan, but I couldn't. Besides, I didn't care aboutdon Juan. There seemed to be a giant barrier between us.I truly believed at that moment that the foreign thought that had beeninsinuating itself to me since I had woken up was true: I was someone else. Anexchange had taken place at the moment of my jump.Otherwise, I would have relished the thought of don Juan: I would have longedfor him. I would have even felt a twinge of resentment because he hadn't takenme with him. That would have been my normal self. I truthfully wasn't the same.This thought gained momentum until it invaded all my being. Any residue of myold self that I may have retained vanished then.A new mood took over. I was alone! Don Juan had left me inside a dream as hisagent provocateur. I felt my body begin to lose its rigidity: It becameflexible, by degrees, until I could breathe deeply and freely. I laughed outloud. I didn't care that people were staring at me and weren't smiling thistime. I was alone, and there was nothing I could have done about it!I had the physical sensation of actually entering into a passageway; apassageway that had a force of its own. It pulled me in. It was a silentpassageway. Don Juan was that passageway; quiet and immense.This was the first time ever that I felt that don Juan was void of physicality.There was no room for sentimentality or longing. I couldn't possibly have missedhim because he was there as a depersonalized emotion that lured me in.The passageway challenged me. I had a sensation of ebullience; ease. Yes, Icould travel that passageway, alone or in company, perhaps forever. And to dothis was not an imposition for me, nor was it a pleasure.It was more than the beginning of the definitive journey; the unavoidable fateof a warrior-traveler. It was the beginning of a new era. I should have beenweeping with the realization that I had found that passageway, but I wasn't. Iwas facing infinity at Ship's! How extraordinary! I felt a chill on my back. Iheard don Juan's voice saying that the universe was indeed unfathomable.At that moment, the back door of the restaurant, the one that led to the parkinglot, opened and a strange character entered: a man perhaps in his early forties,disheveled and emaciated, but with rather handsome features. I had seen him foryears roaming around UCLA, mingling with the students. Someone had told me thathe was an outpatient of the nearby Veterans' Hospital. He seemed to be mentallyunbalanced. I had seen him time after time at Ship's, huddled over a cup ofcoffee, always at the same end of the counter. I had also seen how he waitedoutside, looking through the window, watching for his favorite stool to becomevacant if someone was sitting there.When he entered the restaurant, he sat at his usual place, and then he looked atme. Our eyes met. The next thing I knew, he had let out a formidable scream thatchilled me, and everyone present, to the bone.Everyone looked at me, wide-eyed, some of them with unchewed food in theirmouths. Obviously, they thought I had screamed. I had set up the precedents bybanging the counter and then laughing out loud.The man jumped off his stool and ran out of the restaurant, turning back tostare at me while, with his hands, he made agitated gestures over his head.I succumbed to an impulsive urge and ran after the man. I wanted him to tell mewhat he had seen in me that had made him scream. I overtook him in the parkinglot and asked him to tell me why he had screamed. He covered his eyes andscreamed again, even louder. He was like a child, frightened by a nightmare,screaming at the top of his lungs. I left him and went back to the restaurant.\"What happened to you, dear?\" the waitress asked with a concerned look. \"Ithought you ran out on me.\"\"I just went to see a friend,\" I said.The waitress looked at me, and made a gesture of mock annoyance and surprise.\"Is that guy your friend?\" she asked.\"The only friend I have in the world,\" I said.And that was the truth, if I could define 'friend' as someone who sees throughthe veneer that covers you and knows where you really come from. ### \"The Active Side of Infinity\" - Copyright 1998 by Carlos Castaneda - The End###"}]
